03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's embarrassing.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Where does this one come in?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
What better way for a swimmer to disappear?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Uncle Stewart, why did you do it?

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I bet you kids are starving.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Zoinks, that's for me.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Hey, what's this?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Scooby Dooze was here.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
The whole turkey?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Gone?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Scooby, here we go!

03:57.000 --> 04:15.000
Are we doing the stand-through in the city of the age?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Yes, two days ago.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
One side to the receiver.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
This is Kigo, biological, high resistance, low noise, information brief brought to you.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
High biologists don't understand.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It's the 1st of October, 2020.

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
They are still slowly fighting our way out of this wet paper bag of a spectrum of debate.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
It's taken a while, though, because a lot of people have been deceived.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
A lot of people have been deceived by an illusion of consensus created by people on the internet and on TV.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
All with the idea of misleading the young.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And that's the spell we've got to break.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
That's where we've got to take this, and that's how we've got to think about it.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
We've got to go back to things we've known for decades, if not generations.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Make sure that this history is not lost.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
And the way to get it back is to take it from these charlatans, that's correct.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
We must take back power from these charlatans.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Because the brick wall is visible at the back of the theater.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
It's only a question of what are you going to do about it now?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
What are you going to do about it now?

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
What if I was to tell you there was no spread in New York City that infectious clones were the only real threat

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
that placebo badges were likely distributed in their transfections in healthy mammals?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
It's dumb.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
What if I was to tell you the protocols were murder?

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
The gain of function is a mythology in that this Scooby-Doo mystery is actually a real thing.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And that the players are just spectacularly committed to lies.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Wouldn't that make a lot more sense?

06:35.000 --> 06:46.000
A lot simpler than some complex idea about adding nucleic acids to a chain of other nucleic acids

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
and then suddenly it's endowed with the ability to disrupt an entire planet?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Because that's really the story we've been told, right?

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
Is that a DNA molecule created in a laboratory is able to disrupt the economy and cultures

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
and health systems of a planet?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Are you listening to this?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Are you hearing this?

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
We are being told that a combination, yeah, get out of here, Captain.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
A combination of amino acids, sorry, my bad.

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
A combination of nucleic acids in a ribonucleic acid chain is capable of creating a bioweapon

07:42.000 --> 07:53.000
that if released could disrupt the social and economic framework of an entire species

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
which up until that point was doing just fine.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, that's really a Star Trek-level story that they've told us.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
It's a weapon that's as Kim.com said when he was alive with Andrew Huff or whoever it was

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
that he was talking to, that it's much better than a nuclear weapon.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I mean, you can kill billions of people. This is a planet-wide power.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It's the biological equivalent to a Death Star.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Only you don't destroy the real estate.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
I mean, we are talking dream-team-level biology here.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
And so it's a spectacular narrative that needs disruption.

08:38.000 --> 08:46.000
Sorry for that audio cut being so drastically quick there, right back to the crickets.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Don't take the bait on TV and social media. It is getting quite hectic out there.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
That's because the Scooby-Doo is starting to fall apart on the inside

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
and they're starting to understand that people are starting to really get it,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
that they've been lied to.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And that's really enough for most people, right? Because they've had this gut feeling for a long time.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
They've had all these anecdotal things that just don't add up in their head.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
And so if you give them this pretty easy to understand explanation

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
with a combination of power and money and comfort and any other number of things

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
like prestige among your peers, lots of people do stupid stuff.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
And in this case, you know, they've worked on this for a couple of decades.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
And some of the people that are involved in it probably really don't understand how bad it is.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
But it's bad because we've been lied to for a very long time about the pandemic potential of coronaviruses

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
and with good reason because once this mythology is settled in,

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
then this combination of patents and products can be used to control us for the next decade or decade and a half.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
Unlike any time in history, patents have come to market without, like in the bio-text sphere,

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
without elaborate time frame needed for research and development and testing and approval.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
Instead, they've been brought to market en masse under the pretext of an emergency

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
and because they've been so widely distributed and accepted as working,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
most of these patents are probably going to go on forward.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
These products are going to be gone forward, maybe in new versions.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
But nevertheless, you're going to have testing.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
You're going to have these products that are going to be going forward

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
that are going to be testing for other things using the same methodologies.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
We're going to have mRNA shots with lipid nanoparticles for other targets,

10:51.000 --> 11:04.000
and so this whole collection of new ideas and their sort of legal control exerted on the market

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
by setting a sort of industry standard for what's coming in the future,

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
and then using the pandemic to leverage these technologies into place

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
without this normal extended regulatory hoops to jump through all this other stuff.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Now, a couple of that in with the fact that during the deployment of this,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
there were probably lots of different people producing different formulations,

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
and so with careful record-keeping, the best formulations, the best methodologies

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
could be kept track of, could be noted, and moving forward,

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
perhaps the widespread devastation could be reduced,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
and this all goes along well with people who are just selling the product,

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
just selling, just pushing, and with the full belief that this stuff works,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
kind of like Theranos.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
When in reality, the people that actually understand the biology

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
are first and foremost concerned with the idea of the transfection

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
such a long-lived animal as a human, it's just not really a viable technology

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
because of the cascade of possibilities that exist in a long-lived animal

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
and the cascade of possibilities that exist in an animal,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
yeah, well, in an animal as complex as a human,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
and I'm not really sure how to codify exactly how complex we are,

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
but suffice it to say that it's easier to make a genetic knockout mouse

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
than it is to make a genetic knockout rat genetically modified monkeys

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
are even harder to make, and it is the complexity of the animal,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and the brain, and the immune system, and everything.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
As you go up the evolutionary ladder, and as you get longer lifespans,

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
it seems in many of these mammals that in order for that pattern integrity

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
to sustain itself for that long, you either need to have a very slow metabolism

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
like a reptile, or if you're going to be high metabolism like a mammal,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
then you're going to have to have enzymes and homeostatic mechanisms

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
that are far beyond that required in a mouse where generationally,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
it doesn't matter if they get cancer.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
And so this is really the crux also of understanding the danger

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
of a lot of these applications, which appear to work in mice,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
appear to work in an animal model.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
In an animal model where the animal is not evaluated for its long-term health,

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
is an evaluated for subtle pains and aches and all these things

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
that a child or a teenager or an adult would, of course,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
be aware of, complain about, and experience.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
How do you go about evaluating the side effects of transfection

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
in an animal model for whom the only outward signs are tumors or death?

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
So this is really the sort of extraordinary jump that we've made at this point,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
all under the pretense that this is a gain of function virus,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
most likely leaked from a laboratory, maybe even on purpose.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
And so at least they tried something, at least we got lucky,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and some of the shots worked, or some of the people were protected,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
or some of the people got antibodies.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And it's these people who have misled us.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
And as they've misled us, they've misled us about very specific things,

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
which have led us down this path of figuring it out.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
And that's the part that gets me the most frustrated,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
is that we've been misled to think that we are figuring it out,

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
and I'm one of those people who dedicated a year and a half of my life

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
to trying to spread the message of this is what we've got to figure out.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
We've got to figure out who did this, where it came from.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
It's very important.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
And a couple times I decided that it wasn't important where it came from

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
because of the biology that they were telling us.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
And a couple times I became convinced by other people that no,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
maybe it is really important to figure it out.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
In the end, I've come to the conclusion that there isn't anything to figure out.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
And in fact, it's that urge to figure it out, which was the trap,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
that they tried to suck everyone into.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And if you didn't get sucked into it, that's fine.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
You were most likely going to believe it was natural and didn't want to get sucked into it

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
was a scary discussion.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
But if you did get sucked into it, it was almost inevitable that you would come

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
to the conclusion that this was a lab leak.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
The only question of whether or not it was a lab leak of a natural virus

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
from a bad cave in the Mojang province of China,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
or whether it was a genetically altered or some kind of chimeric virus

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
or a virus with a genetically altered spike protein

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
with inserts from HIV that was released inadvertently in a Wuhan laboratory

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
or maybe brought to the market in Wuhan.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
And so this is the story that people have been figuring out for the last three years.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I've been trying to figure that out.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
You are forced to accept the faith of the Scooby-Doo episode.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
And the faith of the Scooby-Doo episode is there's a novel virus.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
We had to shut down.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
My goodness, thank goodness we did.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
And although we had no idea what to do about it,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
we had no idea what medicines would work.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
Warp speed brought about a mRNA vaccine

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
that saved the day, that saved millions of lives,

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
and that, you know, the adenovirus ones, they didn't work so well

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
because people got some clots, so they pulled those off the market.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
And we saw that they lied about where this virus came from

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
and those lies seemed to reveal the same thing

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
that that leaked diffuse proposal seems to reveal,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
and that is that the United States couldn't make it here

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
because the laws were changed and the regulations were changed

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
and so they shipped this over to China

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
and made this in a lab in China.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
And the diffuse proposal shows clearly that they were going to insert

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
fear and cleavage sites into lots of different bat viruses

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and then spray them back into caves.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
So it makes perfect sense that EcoHealth Alliance did this

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
with USAID money in cooperation with the lab in Wuhan

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
because that's where it leaked from.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
John Stewart could even figure it out.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
But then we debated about it and argued about it

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
and insisted that that's ridiculous for two and a half years

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
or a year and a half to get everybody fired up.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
And in reality, misinformation and disinformation

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
is carrying people to believe things that are untrue.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And vaccinations is a perfect example of it.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Like any.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
And so taking an extreme position like this

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
person did is part of this narrative.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
It gets people, the extreme positions,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
define the space within which people are arguing

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and make it much more likely for people to take a central position

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
between those two, whatever extremes they are.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
And of course then the extreme positions are,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
on one hand, you have Trudeau and Sam Harris saying,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
oh my goodness, you people are idiots.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
And on the other hand, you have people saying that Robert F.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
Kennedy Jr. and ICANN network and CHD are crazy anti-vaxxers

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
who don't believe in medicine.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
And so then somewhere in between here,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
you decide, well, there's obviously a virus.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I mean, there are obviously other ones

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
that would be arguing about then if there wasn't a virus.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
That's the debate.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And that's the perfect reason why these people took such extreme positions

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
that made everybody go, oh,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
it's the exact same effect that Trump has on some people,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
but they did it with the biology

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
and the absurdity of the certainty

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
that none of these people could have had.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Think about this as a couple of weeks ago.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
A week ago or two weeks ago,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
so many of us would like to leave it in the past,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
but cases are once again on the rise.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So when will new booster shots roll out?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And Thompson asked the CDC director.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
This summer, most Americans left COVID in the past,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
gathering together once again, mask-free.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
But tonight, signs of a COVID resurgence.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Across the country, COVID hospitalizations

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
jumped more than 14% in the most recent week.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I mean, that could have been, sorry.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You know, but that could have been anybody.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
That could have been anybody on that cart.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
We don't even know what hospital or where that was

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
or what year that video was shot.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I'll play that a little bit. Sorry about that.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
COVID is making a comeback this summer,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
so many of us would like to leave it in the past,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
but cases are once again on the rise.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
So when will new booster shots roll out?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And Thompson asked the CDC director.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
This summer, most Americans left COVID in the past.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
This is from about, I think, two weeks ago, or maybe three,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
but the point is the same.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
They're running.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
They've been running up the story again,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and they're continuing to do it now.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
We can look at that.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But far lower than pandemic levels,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
What's behind this uptick in COVID that we're seeing?

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
The main driver of this is a variant that's relatively newer

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
to the scene, EG5.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
It's easier to give and get, so that makes it kind of easier

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
to pass along.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
It's been almost a year since the last COVID booster came out.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
The new COVID booster is expected to be approved by the FDA,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
and then we will make recommendations from the CDC

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
probably by the second or third week of September.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Will it protect against this new strain?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
The booster is tailored to what we are seeing circulating now.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Critics say the federal government is behind once again.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
People knew there was going to be a COVID resurgence,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
so why don't we have a booster today?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Why do we have to wait until next month?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
The way we go about doing our, just like we do with our flu shots,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
right, we make sure that we're looking at the ways

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
in which the virus changed.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
They look at and evaluate that.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
The FDA is doing its work.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
We likely will see this as an annual COVID shot,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
just like the flu shot.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Just in time for Paul, when we'll also face RSV.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Can you take the flu shot, the COVID booster and the RSV vaccine

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
all at once?

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
So for flu and COVID, yes, RSV again is only available for older adults.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
That's one where I'd say talk to your doctor about what's right for you.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
So until the new COVID booster comes, get prepared,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
stock up on at home test.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
They do cover that new strain.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Keep a mask handy in case you're in a crowded place,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
and most of all, get your shots.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
COVID flu and RSV all by Halloween to give yourself

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
your best chance of staying healthy.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So she said it right there, right?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
She told everybody you get all of your shots.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
No age, no nothing.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Don't see your doctor.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Just get all your shots like you're a, I don't know,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
a dog going to a pound or something.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
It's impressive.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
The way that they're pushing it now, have a mask in case you're in

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
crowded position.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I mean, it's impressive.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And this is 2023.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
This isn't a year ago or something like that.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Either the COVID never went away.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
All right.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
And thank you.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That's pretty scary.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Thanks for watching.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Are you?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
So here's, here's Sam Harris, what I was talking about.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Dial up the, the deadliness of the pathogen.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
You know, give us something like, you know, airborne Ebola.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Now the reason why, oops, darn it, I'm a little, little weak on the

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
trigger here tonight.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
You know, but.

23:45.000 --> 23:54.000
So he says, he says, dial up the, the deadliness of the pathogen.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
You know, give us something like, you know, airborne Ebola.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Airborne Ebola.

24:00.000 --> 24:09.000
So we heard, um, Robert Malone talk about airborne Ebola with

24:09.000 --> 24:17.000
even Hatfield, we heard, um, I've heard actually also, uh, who's

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
the guy from Minnesota, um, Ulster home has also talked about

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
airborne Ebola and I'm sure I actually have heard someone else say

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
something like airborne Ebola.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
So you can almost be sure at some point that, uh, that's going to

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
come into the story.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
It's, it's ridiculous for him to have mentioned it, but maybe just

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
because he listens to those podcasts too.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't know.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
So his, uh, man, I'm really blowing it with this because my

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
head's in the way.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
So in this video, the interesting thing about what Sam says is that

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
he says, if everything was perfect or if this was super dangerous,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
then nobody would be able to, uh, object to taking vaccines.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
And it's really just like saying, you know, if, if we could implant a

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
chip in your head that was the size of a human hair and was

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
completely inert, guaranteed not to hurt you, but could make you

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
super smart, uh, and, and live for a hundred years, there would be

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
nobody on the earth who wouldn't take it, especially if it did

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
only cost 50 cents.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Okay.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
You're right about all.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
They were right about that.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
If you, if you had a little chip the size of a human hair that you

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
could implant on somebody's head that didn't have to go in the head

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
that could make somebody super smart and it only cost 50 cents,

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
then you would be crazy not to have one.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yes.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
That's so what?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
That, that, what does that even mean?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And so he says, well, you know, if there's a airborne Ebola that's

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
65% deadly or you have super safe vaccines, then there'll be no

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
excuse not to take them.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
So what if intramuscular injection of any combination of

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
substances in order to ignore, uh, augment the immune system is

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
dumb?

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
What if you just look at how the immune system is arranged and

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
look at how it operates and realize that you need to interact

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
with that a barrier and that we need to reformulate and rethink

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
our attempting to vaccinate and then really make choices about

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
and, and with what and against what we vaccinate.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
And, and I think this is really the issue here because a lot of

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
money is made.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
A lot of guaranteed money is made.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
And it's a, you know, it's something that people don't want to

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
lose just like monopolies on antibodies or something that a lot

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
of people didn't want to lose.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
But now that they're gone, anybody that wants to make antibodies can

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
probably make them as long as they got good enough lawyers, they can

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
make whatever they want now.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And that's probably part of what's happening here.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
So in this case, you're just going to hear Sam Harris talk like an

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
absolute moron.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
But again, what is the point?

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
The point is to take this extreme position so that all of us feel

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
very natural taking a position in between his and the other extreme.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
And as long as the narrative control mechanism makes it very

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
easy for people who are kind of passively looking to see what the

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
other end of the, of the spectrum is, you're trapped.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
As soon as you see crazy people over here at anti-vaxxers on one side

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
and on the other side, you see crazy people like Sam Harris.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You're trapped in between them.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
You got no power.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's no problem at all.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
You'll take a digital ID and digital currency when the time comes.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Jobged up.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
And we need to be on the outside of that spectrum.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
We need to be on the outside of that spectrum where we understand that

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
the biology that keeps people there is nonsense.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
The people, the biology that he's going to talk about right now is

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
completely mythological.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
And the biology that is described disingenuously about the people

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
who are anti-vaxx is also, it's not plausible.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
It's crazy.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
And so you try to create this trap that's based on two really crazy

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
positions you can't take anyway so that you take this one in between.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
You know, if you don't let trans kids be trans kids and you're a,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
you hate kids or something like that.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
It's a ridiculous, it's a ridiculous position to take.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
But these ridiculous positions create this, create these spaces of debate

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
that are hypothetical and real to the people inside of them,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
but ridiculous on their face.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
They, to keep and get us to argue about this,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
this, what he talks about is ridiculous.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
But that's his job.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
And I'm taking a lot of time because I really want to make this point that

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
it's not always the position that these people take.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It's where they shine the flashlight.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
And if there's enough space over there for the flashlight to go all the way over

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
to another cavern, and it's a cavern that doesn't lead out,

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
then why not, that's why they say why not shine my flashlight over there?

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
And so he's going to shine his flashlight way over there where there's

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
airborne Ebola and it's killing 50% of the kids and listen to this.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
And bodies of kids are piling up in the street shining his light over

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
that hypothetical cavern over there and making us walk over there and explore it.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Now, I'm not suggesting making us go over there and explore it.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
But what I'm saying is, is that having this person promoted on the Internet,

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
getting attention, people listening to him, is his words going through people's heads

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
and occupying one of those 39,000 thoughts that they have every day.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
And that's been going on for decades.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
And so this extreme position doesn't seem as extreme as it sounds to us

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
because there are people out there who think exactly like Sam.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
And if you read these comments, you will see that lots of people think like him.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
Obviously, I don't, but it's important to hear how extreme this position is.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
Oh boy, I'm still failing miserably at directing my own show today.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Horrible.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
Come on, really?

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
This is like flunky town here.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
But dial up the deadliness of the pathogen.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
Give us something like airborne Ebola that incubates for a month.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
You don't know you have it, and you're what you walk around spreading it,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
and it's got a 75% fatality rate, and it's mostly killing kids.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
No one gets to make that choice anymore.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean, then literally the cops come in and vaccinate you.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
Now, notice one of the things that he extended there very much longer than

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
even the ridiculous stories that we were told was the asymptomatic spread of the virus.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
It incubates for a month where you spread the virus and you don't know you're spreading it.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
That part of the mythology, the fact that he even has it in there, in my mind,

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
already tells you that this is a planted story because he's reinforcing asymptomatic spread

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
even with his dumbassery.

32:19.000 --> 32:25.000
And so when people hear this and share it on social media, they're not even aware of the fact

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
that Sam Harris' dumbassery is still reinforcing asymptomatic spread,

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
and you just think that asymptomatic spread for a month would be ridiculous.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
That's crazy biology.

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
But asymptomatic spread for a week with COVID is fine, right?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
No.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It's not right.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
But that's the magic spell that happens even when people take the ridiculous positions

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
that Trudeau does and that Sam does.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
Listen carefully, see if you can find other examples of that where the mythology is reinforced

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
even by his ridiculousness.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
25% fatality rate, and it's mostly that incubates for a month.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
You don't know you have it and you're what you walk around spreading it, and it's got

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
a 75% fatality rate, and it's mostly killing kids.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
No one gets to make that choice anymore.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
I mean, then literally the cops come in and vaccinate you.

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
And I would say that all of us would agree to that.

33:33.000 --> 33:41.000
It's pretty funny because he purports to be so smart, but imagine what he just said.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
It's a 75% fatality rate, but it incubates for a month and you can spread it.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
So after a month, where is it?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Is it everywhere?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Once it gets on an airplane, right?

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
I mean, how many times did it have to get on an airplane in a month?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Is it everywhere?

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Isn't every like 75% of the people dead are infected already by the end of the one?

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
What scenario is that where warps speed in nine months gets us anywhere?

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Warps speed in nine weeks.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I mean, it's just, it's silly talk, right?

34:16.000 --> 34:24.000
But again, what I'm trying to say is that what Sam Harris is reinforcing is how wide

34:24.000 --> 34:35.000
the potential is that an RNA molecule could go anywhere from infecting millions of people

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
in three years and killing millions, or it could incubate for a month and spread without

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
symptoms and also kill 75% of the people it infects.

34:48.000 --> 34:58.000
And so the hypothetical parameter space that a virus can occupy has just been expanded greatly

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
by Sam Harris' dumbassery.

35:02.000 --> 35:11.000
He's reinforced the idea that asymptomatic spread is possible by giving you a ridiculous

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
scenario of asymptomatic spread.

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
But then nonetheless, if you argue with him about it, even in your head subconsciously,

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
you're accepting the existence of that principle.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
And that goes the same with the lethality of the virus being 75%.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
And the consequences of that and the potential of that and how would that work?

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
That an RNA molecule can be 75% lethal to those mammals exposed to it?

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
What kind of weakness would be built into our immune system if that was the case?

35:46.000 --> 35:54.000
What kind of diabolical, sinister, synthetic thing would be able to do that?

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
Just think about that, the absurdity of it, and yet he's very happy to spew that out.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
Why? Because it pushes this narrative faith down the road.

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
If you don't accept the existence of viruses and you accept that they can be released and go around the world,

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
and the only debate is how bad can they really be, then you're ruleable.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
Your kids will be ruleable by this mythology because they just have to tell you a scarier story next time.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
They just have to turn the screws a little tighter next time because you've already accepted

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
that the boogeyman is there.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
And that's not that there are no viruses, it's that viruses can't pandemic.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
RNA molecules don't do this, not even when they're really nicely coded.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Let's keep listening to his absurdity because it's important to learn from it.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
The moment, again, that you turn up the lethality on the pathogen,

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
you turn up the effectiveness of the vaccine, you turn down the risk of the vaccine,

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
give me a truly safe vaccine where there's not even one documented case of vaccine injury, right?

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
So then you just have to be completely crazy to be worried about being vaccinated.

37:11.000 --> 37:17.000
So what's interesting about this position is then you have to almost be crazy to be worried about vaccination.

37:17.000 --> 37:25.000
So then if there are people who are vaccine injured and it's not an insignificant number of people,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
then you're not so crazy to be worried about it.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
And so in a way, he sort of slips up here, right?

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
He kind of looks like a dipshit if you think about it.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
But again, it's the absurdity of it that's important so that no matter who talks about it,

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
no matter who discusses it, whether this ball gets thrown to Tim Poole, he can say dumb stuff about it.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
The narrative will never be questioned.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
This ball can be tossed to Brett Weinstein.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Brett Weinstein can say, boy, it's too bad.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
My friend Sam Harris is such a moron now.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He's really brainwashed.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
And the narrative will never be questioned there.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Either they're all on the faith.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The ball can be thrown to someone like Sam Cedar.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And he can whine even more about how Sam Harris gets picked on all the time.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
This makes perfect sense to me.

38:16.000 --> 38:25.000
And so the entire time this conversation of him that getting made fun of is actually a tool

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
for all these other little people on the internet to amplify the same ideas

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
and to talk about what these ideas mean or don't mean, just like I'm doing except

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
they don't reveal the fact that this keeps you on the faith that there was a novel virus.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
We had to do something.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
mRNA did something.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
And it was gain a function so it could come again.

38:50.000 --> 39:00.000
I'm trying to explain to you why absurd behavior like this can exist and can be useful for them.

39:00.000 --> 39:09.000
Because this gets clicks, this gets listens, this gets complaints, this gets retweets, this gets quoted.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
And so doing, you're solving the mystery.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
You're in the argument.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
You're buying the premise that there are viruses that they can go around the world.

39:20.000 --> 39:29.000
It's only a question of how many people die or who's vulnerable, who's got the antibodies and who doesn't.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And it might be about mandating stuff.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
Maybe you don't like mandating, but he's just saying if it's really dangerous and things work really well,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
then what's wrong with mandates?

39:39.000 --> 39:47.000
And once again, you're trapped.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
And so you've got to be really careful not to get trapped in this Scooby-Doo because if you do,

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
then very quickly they're going to change the way you think about the rest of the way a respiratory disease develops

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
and what causes it.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
You're going to be very quickly bamboozled in not thinking about all cause mortality anymore.

40:04.000 --> 40:12.000
You're going to be very quickly bamboozled into thinking about antibodies and not the actual way that your immune system works.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
And with regard to immunization and vaccination, they'll be the same thing.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
You're going to be bamboozled into thinking that mRNA is not bad in principle.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
That's their goal.

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
You may have seen this video in Japan that are investigating the effects.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
Tonight we're getting to you guys.

40:35.280 --> 40:40.000
I will be here in 1.35 days.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
I'll talk to a few guys about the settings.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
The settings we've experienced are very quickly done.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
When you look at all of theallel seminars we're going to use for immunization.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
So just think about it carefully.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.760
Now, of course, this is kind of a fringy group, and so it's not clear to me how much traction this

41:02.760 --> 41:08.760
is really getting a mainstream Japan. Maybe we can find out from Kevin McCarran if he's covering

41:08.760 --> 41:13.240
any of this. Maybe somebody can let me know in the chat. But it does seem they're starting to

41:13.240 --> 41:19.320
realize a little too late that they were told to do something they shouldn't have been told to do.

41:19.960 --> 41:25.880
This, of course, has happened all around the world. And so it'll be interesting to see how that

41:25.880 --> 41:32.200
all rolls out again. These things, of course, allowed all of these other bad things to happen,

41:32.200 --> 41:38.040
and that's also part of the Scooby-Doo because they're not talking about how many people have

41:38.040 --> 41:43.720
been damaged by Remdesivir. There are currently two suits that I've been made aware of. One,

41:43.720 --> 41:50.600
which has to do with glass being in the Remdesivir preparation. And another one has to do with kidney

41:51.640 --> 41:55.480
malfunction, not being listed in the possible side effects of Remdesivir.

41:57.560 --> 42:03.960
But none of the suits are really going after the idea that Remdesivir is not appropriate for

42:03.960 --> 42:10.520
anything. The Remdesivir shouldn't have been given to anyone or anything like that. So I'm not

42:10.520 --> 42:17.080
really sure if those suits are going to do anything for everyone. But again, nobody's really

42:17.080 --> 42:24.200
trying to solve this. Where did this order to not use antibiotics come from? How widespread was

42:24.200 --> 42:29.640
it around the United States? Where was Remdesivir used and how widespread was it applied? Is it

42:29.640 --> 42:36.440
still being applied now and why? How many people were ventilated and never came out of their vent?

42:37.080 --> 42:43.400
We got to try and figure some of this stuff out, but right now we're not really trying to

42:43.400 --> 42:48.520
figure it out. That's the point. And again, they're not talking about certain things. That's how you

42:48.520 --> 42:55.000
get kept on the Scooby-Doo. If you don't talk about PCR and you're not talking about masking and

42:55.000 --> 42:59.960
lockdown and spread the lack of spread, if you're not talking about all this list,

43:00.760 --> 43:06.840
pretty much daily as part of your explanation for fifth-generation warfare,

43:06.840 --> 43:12.040
then you're not really explaining what fifth-generation warfare is all about. It's about

43:12.040 --> 43:18.920
creating monsters. It's about creating Scooby-Doo's so that the people think they're figuring stuff

43:18.920 --> 43:23.400
out and that people are getting caught and that the bad guys are going to jail

43:23.720 --> 43:33.640
and slowly but surely that Scooby-Doo thing is starting to change to like, you know,

43:34.200 --> 43:42.040
oh, they're using directed energy weapons to burn the shore of Maui and they're blowing up

43:42.040 --> 43:49.080
chemical trains in Ohio and they're polluting the waters and they're doing all this stuff because

43:49.080 --> 43:53.000
they're going to ruin all this stuff because they want us to run out of all of our stuff and

43:54.040 --> 44:02.760
maybe all of these things are true but in reality, in reality, the way that we check out is this

44:03.960 --> 44:09.480
because once we get rid of this public health thing, once that thing is all gone and we root

44:09.480 --> 44:16.760
that out of our system, most of the rot will be exposed. Most of the rotten people, most of the

44:16.840 --> 44:23.400
rotten programs, most of the rotten impotuses inside of that bureaucracy will be exposed

44:24.440 --> 44:28.200
and they want us to think about these other things. They want us to be worried about this other

44:28.200 --> 44:35.960
stuff but it's primarily our need to rein in our public health, the Department of Homeland Security,

44:36.760 --> 44:42.120
control our borders, get back control of our country again but definitely get back control

44:42.120 --> 44:47.800
of our biology because if we keep debating about viruses and we keep debating about

44:48.360 --> 44:53.880
gain of function and we keep debating about this stuff until we're done debating it,

44:54.440 --> 45:01.160
then all of these things will be out of our control by then. That's their plan even as they

45:01.160 --> 45:05.080
point to the who and say, see the who is doing it, the who's doing it. No, anybody could step

45:05.080 --> 45:10.920
out of the who whenever we wanted to. They want you to believe that if the who signed some papers

45:11.000 --> 45:16.040
or we signed some papers, it's like signing in blood and Satan is sitting at the table so once

45:16.040 --> 45:23.720
you do that, it's over. And I refuse to believe that that's the way the who is or the sepe is or

45:23.720 --> 45:29.640
the wef is. If we can get our act together as a country and just decide that we're going to lead

45:29.640 --> 45:38.120
the way out and we're going to try and figure out the out of our fiscal destructive position

45:38.120 --> 45:43.800
that we're in. Maybe there is no way out of it but goodness knows we need to extract some of the

45:43.800 --> 45:51.720
money that's been stolen from us from the oligarchs that stole it from us. We need to correct this

45:51.720 --> 45:57.000
wrong. We need to correct this wrong because there's, we don't know what's going on anymore.

45:57.960 --> 46:04.680
The average person on the street doesn't know what's going on anymore. Everything is corrupted,

46:04.680 --> 46:13.640
everything is a show. All the world's a stage and they lied to us about this pandemic and we need

46:13.640 --> 46:22.680
people to understand this maybe this year. Didn't I have it here? Didn't it? Oh yeah, sorry. So,

46:22.680 --> 46:26.360
you know, this is the way I'm going to I'm going to keep telling everybody to say it.

46:27.960 --> 46:33.160
And let's go on to the let's go on to the video. What's going on here? Why was the video not here?

46:34.040 --> 46:37.480
Sorry, I'm going to skip ahead here and see if I go there. Sorry.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.880
Here we go.

46:52.760 --> 47:00.200
And Philip Buckholt. So, this is a guy who I think confirmed a lot of the analysis that was done by

47:00.280 --> 47:07.880
Dr. Kevin McKernan. I shouldn't say Dr. Kevin McKernan because he didn't get his doctorate,

47:07.880 --> 47:11.400
but what difference does it make? He's earned his doctorate. So,

47:13.720 --> 47:23.880
Kevin McKernan, the guy who found the DNA in the vaccine shots that he was sent. It's interesting

47:23.880 --> 47:30.120
to note that the story of how he got the vaccines that he tested and found the DNA

47:30.120 --> 47:40.440
plasmid in has varied. The original story that I heard twice was that for an experiment that he

47:40.440 --> 47:52.280
was doing for his cannabis genetics company, he needed a polyA RNA control. And if you know

47:52.360 --> 47:57.480
anything about RNA, you know that if you wanted to get taken up by the ribosome, it needs to have

47:57.480 --> 48:09.480
a polyA tail for some reason. And so he needed a control and an anonymous person sent him

48:10.120 --> 48:17.480
vaccine miles in the mail. And that was very curious. He used them as a control and just because

48:17.480 --> 48:24.040
he used them as a control, they were also therefore in the sequencing reaction, you see.

48:24.840 --> 48:30.360
So the story is that he didn't even mean to sequence the vaccine. It's just that he got the

48:30.360 --> 48:37.960
vaccine and he was using it for a polyA RNA control. And then because it was already in there, it got

48:38.040 --> 48:49.000
sequenced. And when he sequenced it, he noticed that there wasn't just the spike protein RNA in

48:49.000 --> 48:57.400
there, but he noticed an SV40 promoter in that that led him to realize that it was DNA in there,

48:57.400 --> 49:02.920
I believe, could be wrong. He could have found DNA some other way and then look for something that

49:03.000 --> 49:07.960
he expected by being there like an easy one like that. I'm not sure exactly what direction it went.

49:07.960 --> 49:13.480
So let's listen to how he confirmed this. He's a pretty good guy. I think this is like 43 minutes,

49:13.480 --> 49:18.360
so I'm going to speed it up just a little. He's a good speaker though, so there's no reason to speed

49:18.360 --> 49:28.600
it up too much just to make it peppy. So a little bit of what am I doing here? For those of you

49:28.600 --> 49:34.360
who don't know me, my name is Philip McCall. I have a PhD in biochemistry, molecular biology.

49:35.400 --> 49:39.400
I'm a cancer gene jock. Basically, I do cancer genomics research at the University of South Carolina.

49:39.960 --> 49:44.040
And what that means is that I'm kind of an expert on all the ways that the human genome can get

49:44.040 --> 49:48.120
fussed with during your lifetime and which of those things cause cancer and which ones don't.

49:48.120 --> 49:53.480
Okay. So technically, that means that I'm very, very skilled in the art of DNA sequencing.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.040
Okay, I can figure out the sequence of things that I didn't know what I was looking for.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.680
And I'm also pretty good when I say I, I mean, the people in my laboratory, you're not going to

50:00.680 --> 50:04.600
hear their names, but there's a group of people that do this excellent work. We're really good at

50:05.640 --> 50:09.960
detecting foreign pieces of DNA in places where they're not supposed to be, even if they're low

50:09.960 --> 50:17.480
levels. And we use those skills during the pandemic to, we invented the COVID test that many of you

50:17.480 --> 50:21.320
did a spit test. Okay, that came out of my lab because we were really good at that kind of stuff.

50:21.320 --> 50:28.360
And so I've earned a fair amount of respect in the state of South Carolina and in this body because

50:28.360 --> 50:32.120
we did a ton of COVID testing in the middle of the night when people were afraid and we told them,

50:32.120 --> 50:36.840
no, you don't have COVID in your home or yes, you do. So my qualifications to comment on this are

50:36.840 --> 50:39.720
both technical and kind of relational in the state of South Carolina.

50:45.080 --> 50:48.920
It leads me to believe that he might be a very interesting person to talk to because he said

50:48.920 --> 50:55.400
that he was testing for COVID, which means very likely he designed his own PCR test for it, which

50:55.400 --> 51:01.480
is cool. Because a lot of the people that were in academic biology at the time, we're all saying

51:01.480 --> 51:06.440
that, yeah, we could all do this on our benches. And then we'd save all this time waiting for these

51:06.440 --> 51:13.480
tests to be released. We could just do it. And the government definitely didn't want that to happen.

51:14.280 --> 51:19.240
I'll cut to a very narrow theme here, but it does touch on lots of these regulatory issues.

51:19.240 --> 51:23.800
And I'll leave it to you to expand on those if you want to. I'll try to stay in this narrow lane

51:24.600 --> 51:29.880
of some problems in the Pfizer vaccine as a case study for places in which regulatory oversight

51:29.880 --> 51:35.720
could be improved. Alright, so first of all, let me say that my interpretation of the literature is

51:35.720 --> 51:40.680
that the Pfizer vaccine did a pretty good job of keeping people from dying, but it did a terrible

51:40.680 --> 51:46.360
job of stopping the pandemic. The early publications showed that it stopped infection,

51:46.360 --> 51:50.040
but that only lasted for like a month. Could you pull the mic a little closer to you,

51:50.040 --> 51:53.240
staff's telling me having trouble getting you on the recording? Okay, thank you.

51:54.440 --> 51:58.520
In my professional evaluation of the literature, the Pfizer vaccine did a pretty good job of keeping

51:58.520 --> 52:03.640
people out of the cemetery, but it sucked at stopping the pandemic. And it was the best of

52:03.720 --> 52:10.520
lucky options that we had. And I still believe that it was deployed mostly in good faith,

52:11.080 --> 52:16.040
but there were a lot of shortcuts taken because the house was on fire and we could do a better

52:16.040 --> 52:19.400
job next time from the lessons that we're going to learn here. That's my own personal view of this,

52:20.120 --> 52:25.160
but I'm also my philosophical bent here is, I'm sure many of you've heard of Occam's razor,

52:25.160 --> 52:28.520
right? Choose the simplest of explanations. Well, there's another one called Hanlon's razor,

52:28.520 --> 52:32.280
which is never a tribute malice to that which can be better explained by incompetence. And so,

52:32.280 --> 52:36.120
I'm trying to be gracious here in many circumstances. There could be malice underneath,

52:36.120 --> 52:40.120
but I'm trying to see just incompetence to be gracious. So the Pfizer.

52:41.320 --> 52:50.120
So it's important to point out that for reasons beyond me, he thinks that after reviewing the

52:50.120 --> 52:57.240
literature and his professional opinion, the mRNA kept people alive, kept people out of the hospital,

52:57.240 --> 53:03.560
kept people out of the grave. And there's no evidence for that in Denny Rancor's data,

53:03.560 --> 53:10.520
none at all. Not only is there none at all, but he probably had access to it because this is like,

53:10.520 --> 53:18.360
you know, a month ago. So it's absurd to say that in his public, you know, he's a pharmacist.

53:18.360 --> 53:22.120
He says it himself. He's not an epidemiologist. It's, you know, I'm sure he's smart.

53:22.920 --> 53:28.840
But where's your data? If you're going to say this, kept people alive is a very big claim

53:31.160 --> 53:37.640
that it didn't really stop infection for very long. I mean, it was deployed in good faith

53:38.360 --> 53:45.480
after 45 minutes of design consideration. And all it was rushed. We could do it better next time.

53:45.560 --> 53:52.680
Is this any? Is there anything here that even comes close to going off script?

53:54.440 --> 54:01.240
Because I don't hear it. So far, there's a virus. It's spreading around the world like wildfire

54:01.240 --> 54:07.480
even now. And we had to do something and we rushed it, but the mRNA kept people out of the grave.

54:08.200 --> 54:17.720
A vaccine is contaminated with plasmid DNA. It's not just mRNA. It's got bits of DNA in it.

54:17.720 --> 54:23.320
This DNA is the DNA vector that was used as the template for the in vitro transcription reaction

54:23.320 --> 54:28.680
when they made the mRNA. I know this is true because I sequenced it in my own lab. The vials of

54:28.680 --> 54:32.440
Pfizer vaccine that were given out here in Columbia, one of my colleagues was in charge of that

54:32.440 --> 54:37.000
vaccination program in the College of Pharmacy. And for reasons that I still don't understand,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.080
he kept every single vial. So I got a whole freezer full of the empty vials. Well, the empty

54:41.080 --> 54:44.600
vials have a little tiny bit in the bottom of them. He gave them all to me and I looked at them.

54:44.600 --> 54:48.600
We had two batches that were given out here in Columbia. And I checked these two batches

54:48.600 --> 54:53.800
and I checked them by sequencing. And I sequenced all the DNA that was in the vaccine. And I can

54:53.800 --> 54:58.600
see what's in there. And it's surprising that there's any DNA in there. And you can kind of work out

54:58.600 --> 55:03.560
what it is and how it got there. And I'm kind of alarmed about the possible consequences of this,

55:03.560 --> 55:08.120
both in terms of human health and biology, but you should be alarmed about the regulatory

55:08.120 --> 55:14.600
process that allowed it to get there. So this DNA, in my view, it could be causing some of the

55:14.600 --> 55:18.920
rare but serious side effects like death from cardiac arrest. There's a lot of cases now of

55:18.920 --> 55:24.440
people having suspicious death after vaccine. It's hard to prove what caused it is just, you know,

55:24.440 --> 55:33.960
temporally associated. And this DNA is a plausible mechanism. Okay. This DNA can and likely will

55:33.960 --> 55:39.000
integrate into the genomic DNA of cells that got transfected with the vaccine mix. This is just

55:39.000 --> 55:42.680
the way it works. We do this in the lab all the time. We take pieces of DNA, we mix them up with a

55:42.680 --> 55:47.880
lipid complex like the Pfizer vaccine is in, we pour it onto cells and a lot of it gets into the

55:47.880 --> 55:53.240
cells and a lot of it gets into the DNA of those cells. And that's called transformation. And if

55:53.240 --> 56:00.040
you do it with with an RNA, it's called transfection. And you should say that.

56:00.920 --> 56:05.800
Teach everybody, make it plain and simple. We know all this works. This is how we do it.

56:06.600 --> 56:11.160
These are the terms. They should have told you that the adenovirus was a transformation

56:12.040 --> 56:18.200
and the lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA and it was a transfection. It becomes a permanent fixture

56:18.200 --> 56:24.040
of the cell. It's not just a temporary thing. It is in that cell and all of its progeny from now

56:24.040 --> 56:29.560
on forevermore on in. So that's why I'm kind of alarmed about this DNA being in the vaccine.

56:29.560 --> 56:34.520
It's different from RNA because it can be permanent. This is a real hazard for genome

56:34.520 --> 56:39.640
modification of long-lived somatic cells like stem cells. And it could cause theoretically.

56:39.640 --> 56:44.440
This is all a theoretical concern, but it's pretty reasonable based on solid molecular biology

56:44.520 --> 56:49.080
that it could cause a sustained autoimmunetact or that tissue. It's also a very real theoretical

56:49.080 --> 56:53.800
risk of future cancer in some people. Depending on where in the genome this foreign piece of DNA

56:53.800 --> 56:58.440
lands, it can interrupt a tumor suppressor or activate an oncogene. I think it'll be rare,

56:58.440 --> 57:01.720
but I think the risk is not zero and it may be high enough that we are to figure out if this

57:01.720 --> 57:07.320
is happening or not. And again, the autoimmunity thing is not my wheelhouse. I'm not an immunologist,

57:07.320 --> 57:11.560
but the cancer risk is. That's my bag. I know this is a thing and it is a possibility.

57:12.360 --> 57:18.600
Okay, a little nerdy science here at the center. Okay, so I'm just going to hit this off at the

57:18.600 --> 57:27.880
past while I'm going to turn the page soon. He said DNA contamination could cause the cardiac

57:27.880 --> 57:34.440
arrest, the deaths. It could be integrated into cells. It could cause the autoimmune response to

57:34.440 --> 57:40.920
those tissues. It could cause cancer in those tissues by interrupting tumor suppressors, etc.

57:41.880 --> 57:49.800
Now, what I want you to see here is that I don't think there's any reason to think that a

57:50.680 --> 57:58.680
codon optimized chemically altered pseudo uridine optimized, whatever you want to call it, RNA

57:59.320 --> 58:09.400
packaged in liposomes and injected in the muscle could be discounted as being the cause of this

58:09.480 --> 58:17.560
as well. But here we have a guy listing everything that we think the mRNA is doing and more

58:18.440 --> 58:24.120
and saying that the DNA could explain all of these things, which means what?

58:25.960 --> 58:29.320
Which means if we hadn't rushed it, the RNA could be great.

58:30.680 --> 58:33.800
Like what a great technology it would have been if we wouldn't have blown it.

58:34.760 --> 58:40.040
Be very careful, ladies and gentlemen, because it is very enticing to think that we have another

58:40.040 --> 58:48.280
ally here now. Great. He's on our team. The DNA is a contaminant. It's a story, ladies and gentlemen.

58:48.280 --> 58:55.160
The DNA is a contaminant. The DNA is a contaminant is one of the reasons why they knew this was

58:55.160 --> 59:01.160
not a therapy that was ready for mainstream, that was ready for healthy humans. Can you hear me?

59:02.120 --> 59:08.440
That's the reality. The fact of the matter is, is that these molecular biologists all around the

59:08.440 --> 59:15.240
world know that you can't separate completely the plasmid from the RNA that you generate from it.

59:15.880 --> 59:21.240
You can try really hard. You can digest the DNA, but it doesn't get it all out of there.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.520
And especially when you go from nanograms to kilograms of production.

59:26.840 --> 59:36.920
Just think breaking bad, small batch blue crystals, giant batch of blue crystals. It's different.

59:38.920 --> 59:41.400
It's part of what made that story a little bit me.

59:44.040 --> 59:51.080
But we are really talking about something very special here because it's not wrong. He is not

59:51.160 --> 59:58.600
wrong to be excited about there being DNA in there. But it's not unexpected. What's

59:59.560 --> 01:00:05.560
what's unexpected is that people are so silly as to think that this isn't part of the panoply

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:12.200
of reasons why this would never work. But it's not the most important one. The most important one is,

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:20.360
as I've said many times before, the most important one is that...

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:33.480
Oops. Now what did I do? Where to go? What the hell? Boy, I'm really, I'm really failing you guys.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:39.480
I really apologize. That's really terrible. I was supposed to go here. And so you've really

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.000
got to say this. You've got to say the transfection isn't immunization. That you can't augment the

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.560
immune system from the inside. That's what I think we should be saying all the time.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.840
Okay. Let's listen more.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.520
Told dogma of molecular biology is that DNA gets transcribed into RNA. Okay. And then RNA

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:04.040
gets translated into protein. This is just how life runs. Why does this matter? Well,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.480
for the purposes of this discussion, DNA is a long-lived information storage device.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.480
Okay. What you were born with, you're going to die with and have some of your kids. DNA lasts

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.520
for hundreds of thousands of years, and it can last for generations if you pass it on to your kids.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.840
Right? So alterations to the DNA, they stick around. RNA, by its nature, is temporary. It

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:30.360
doesn't last. And that feature of RNA was part of the sales pitch for the vaccine. The

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.640
pseudo-urettine was supposed to make the RNA last a little bit longer. But still, it's a

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.400
transient phenomenon. We're talking hours to days. Okay. And then proteins. Once proteins are made,

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.960
they also don't last forever. They last for hours to days. But something that makes its way into

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.160
DNA has the potential to lack. See, so he's already also saying that RNA is only around for hours

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.720
to days. But we know that's not true with this, this altered RNA. We don't know how long it stays

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:02.520
around. The crazy stories tell us it's around for as long as they've looked for it. And the other

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.280
end of the crazy story is that it's only around for days. And so again, they're sculpting this

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:14.120
narrative. But the narrative really is that the RNAs find the RNA is temporary. The RNA is not

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.680
dangerous relative to DNA. The DNA is much worse. Now there's DNA and they're all bets are off,

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.000
blah, blah, blah, blah. But we said this was going to happen like a year and a half ago,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.920
maybe even more than that, maybe even two years ago now, we said this was going to happen.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:40.280
That they were going to blame contamination, incompleteness, contaminated RNA, bad lipid

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.800
nanoparticle, bad spike protein, they were going to blame something so that they could say but

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.360
the transfection were great. Best for a very long time, maybe a lifetime.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.120
So this is a picture of the sequencing read that the sequencing run that I did in the lab

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.040
from a couple of batches of the Pfizer vaccine. And all those little bitty lines here are the

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.200
little tiny pieces of DNA that are in the vaccine. They don't belong there. They're just not part

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.120
of the sales picture of the marketing campaign. And they're there. There's a lot of them. This

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.480
little graph here in the middle is the size distribution that peaks around 100 base pairs,

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:17.080
120 base pairs. So the DNA pieces that just dawned on me, do you think that they can convince

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.680
everybody that took a shot to get sequenced to track this down? It says underneath here,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.880
we should sequence a few hundred people and find out if this DNA ever got into the human genome.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.600
Could they trick people into thinking that, yeah, you should definitely get your gene sequence.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.400
You should get your genome sequenced right away. We'll pay for it for free because we're trying

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.360
to track down this possible integration. Boy, that would be a funny one, wouldn't it?

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.640
They're in the vaccine are short little pieces, 100, 120. There's some that are about 500 base

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.560
pairs, a few that are even 5,000. But most of them are around 100 base pairs. Why is this important?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:03.720
Because the probability of a DNA piece of DNA integrating into the human genome is unrelated to

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.000
its size. So your genome risk is just a function of how many particles there are. So it's like,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.080
you know, if you shoot a shotgun at a washboard, if you shoot a slug, you have some probability

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.360
of hitting it and they shoot buckshot. You have a bigger probability of hitting it with some shot,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.040
right? All these little pieces of DNA that are in the vaccine are analogous to buckshot.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:27.960
You have many, many thousands of opportunities to modify a cell of a vaccinated person.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.680
The pieces are very small because during the process, they chopped them up to try to make

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.840
them go away. But they actually increased the hazard of genome modification in the process.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:45.880
That's how this got here. In my view, somebody should go about sequencing DNA samples from stem

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.480
cells of people who are vaccinated and find out if this theoretical risk has happened or not.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.240
I think this is a real serious oversight, regulatory oversight that happened at the federal level,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.280
and somebody should force this to happen somewhere. Dr. McArthur, are you capable of doing that?

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.760
Yeah, we do that kind of thing. But in order for it to be trustworthy by the public,

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.600
this has to be done by lots of people. I'll talk to you more about that later.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.200
Yeah, this is our deal. This is why I know this should have been done at the federal level.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:22.280
So we took all these pieces of DNA and we used them to glue together what the source DNA must have

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.600
been. This is kind of, again, this is what we do in the lab all the time. And all these little

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.680
little red and green lines here, these are all in a bit, little pieces of DNA. This must have

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.160
100,000 pieces of DNA in this sequencing run. And you can put them all back together and see

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.520
what they came from is this circle over here. It's a plasmid that you can go shopping online

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:46.440
to buy from Agilent. And it's clear that Pfizer took this plasmid and then they cloned spike into

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.080
it. And they used it in a process called in vitro transcription translation, in vitro transcription,

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:58.280
where you feed an RNA polymerase, this plasmid, and it makes a whole bunch of mRNA copies for you.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.760
And then you take this mRNA, you mix it with the lipid nanoparticle transfection reagent,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.600
and now you've got your mRNA vaccine, but they failed to get the DNA out before they did.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.800
So you understand that basically he's describing the exact same way that pieces of an infectious

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.480
clone would be made before they're ligated together to produce the whole RNA.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:26.760
It's the same plasmid DNA, grown at quantity in a bacteria, and then produced or mixed together

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:33.080
with a master mix transcription translation enzyme, and then you get your RNA. So listen to

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:40.520
him say it again, because it's nice to hear him explain how you take a plasmid DNA, which could

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:47.720
easily code for a coronavirus. In this case, it's coding for the coronavirus spike, and you make a

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:54.840
lot of mRNA after you grow the plasmid in translation in vitro transcription, where you feed an RNA

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.800
polymerase, this plasmid, and it makes a whole bunch of mRNA copies for you.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.280
And then you take this mRNA, you mix it with the lipid nanoparticle transfection reagent,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.040
and now you've got your mRNA vaccine, but they failed to get the DNA out before they did this.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.040
So these little pieces, they did make some effort to chop it up, so all these little pieces of

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.520
the plasmid got packaged in with the RNA. That's clear as day what happened just from the forensics

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:22.280
of looking at the DNA sequencing. A little bit of a regulatory note here. The way you do RNA

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.720
transcription, in vitro transcription reactions, you have to give it a DNA template. And you can

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.360
give it a DNA template that is just a synthetic piece of DNA that is only the instructions to make

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.880
the RNA, and that's what was done for getting the emergency use authorization and the clinical

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.360
trial. That's called process one, if you look up that kind of stuff. They made a PCR product of

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.720
just the bits that they wanted, and then they did the in vitro transcription, made a bunch of

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:51.480
RNA of that. There was no plasmid DNA to contaminate the stuff that was used for the trial. But that

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.600
making that PCR product doesn't scale the way. So you see he's talking very clearly about

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.560
what Vincent Rancin Yellow talked about at the beginning of the pandemic, how fascinating it was

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:09.080
that they were scaling up from nanograms on a bench to kilograms in a vat. And this is what

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:15.400
he's describing the original batches in the trials and the data that he just defended, by the way.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:23.320
The product that was injected into those people and was likely distributed on movie sets,

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.760
it distributed anywhere where they didn't want to hurt people or wanted to be sure they were

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:36.840
giving them the best product. It would have been done that way. They would have made the DNA sequence

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:44.840
synthetically, so that there was none of this plasmid stuff. There was no possibility of

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.520
contamination in that way, and then they would just do it all synthetically. You can do that

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.920
for nanograms, you can do that for treating one cancer patient, but you can't do it for treating

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.720
a bit, making a billion shots. Think about the scale there that they purport to have done,

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.240
because they're just so badass. They went from being able to make small batch,

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:17.640
you know, really microbrewery type stuff, like a single cappuccino for a really sick guy with a

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:26.920
very unique genetic condition to making that cappuccino for everyone. It's just crazy.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:34.920
But like I said, and like other people I think I see pointed out, he did defend the trial data,

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:43.480
he didn't question it at all. And so he's clearly not questioning where we are or where we went.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.720
I also saw it pointed out in the chat that he was actually not only was he testing, but he was

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:55.000
testing a lot of people and helped make a few products for testing. Probably still own some

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.280
patents on testing methodologies and those will go forward, maybe even in a patent pool

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:06.600
distributed by the who. So keep in mind, ladies and gentlemen, what's happening here.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:14.760
It is very likely that there is a patent pool of countermeasures that include diagnostics,

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:22.600
that include vaccines and the technologies used to make them, bottle them, create them.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:33.960
And countless other patents that are bundled together and are being distributed by world

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.880
governments to set a new industry standard on all of these things that they will then leverage

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:49.800
as medical industry standards to enforce testing, to enforce the continued existence of COVID,

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.600
to enforce the continued funding and pushing of shots.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:05.800
This is not going away. This was the plan all along. This was a shift, a permanent shift that

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.920
if we don't stop it, it will be permanent. And in a way, we don't need to stop it. We just need

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:17.160
to step away from it because if we don't need to replace that system with something else,

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.240
right, we just need to get out of it. All right, let's listen. Sorry.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.280
That was necessary to vaccinate the whole world. So a cheaper way to scale up the production of

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.600
this template is to clone that PCR product into this plasma vector, put the plasma vector into

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.880
bacteria and then you can grow up big vats of the bacteria. They make a lot of the plasma DNA

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.600
for you and use that plasma DNA as the template to drive this transcription reaction to make your

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:45.640
RNA. And that's where how the contamination ended up in the production batches, even though it was

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.320
not in the stuff that was used for the authorization trials. So I know it's a little bit of nerdy

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.600
science, but it has regulatory implications for you guys. So it's interesting because there's a

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.120
new paper out that analyzes that data and shows what Steve Kirsch was kind of pushing a long time

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.960
ago, which is that more people were killed in the control group after on masking or sorry,

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.720
in the experimental group that got the shots versus the people who didn't get the shots.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:19.640
And there is a new paper out. It's a it's a pre-print that will probably cover this week in a journal club

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:26.200
as we try to get into the swing of things again. And I think this will be really important to

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.080
acknowledge that this person is not really talking about that at all. In fact, glossing over that

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.760
well-known fact that they unblinded the trial. They gave everybody that wanted it in the control

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:46.200
group, the transfection. And in that group of people, then a few more people died,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.840
which put it at a total of during the study period, 14 people died in the control group.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.000
They were unvaccinated and 20 died in the control group.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:06.440
So, you know, they say that's insignificant, but it's definitely not good. And he's glossing over

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.200
that right now and not saying it at all.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.160
We can we can measure the quantity of this stuff pretty easy in the lab. This is we're good at

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.240
doing this kind of stuff. This is the same we made a little PC, a colleague of mine at MIT made,

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:27.240
you know, from who used to work for the Broad Institute at MIT, he made a little PCR test.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.640
And we cloned it here. This is similar to the PCR test that you all took for the spit test.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.360
Okay, same same idea and same expertise behind it. And we can quantify exactly how much of the

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.640
stuff is in a vaccine or any other tissue. And, you know, I estimate that there were

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.840
about 2 billion copies of the one piece that we're looking for in every dose.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.640
And if you look back at that map, I showed you where it's all these little the little piece

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.600
that we're looking for is just that little bit right there. Okay. But if you see 2 billion copies

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.680
of this, there's about 200 billion of everything else. So what this means is that there's probably

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:10.840
about 200 billion pieces of this plasma DNA in each dose of the vaccine. And it's encapsulated

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.360
in this lipid nanoparticle. So it's ready to be delivered inside the cell. Okay, this is a bad idea.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.360
My conclusions from this, we should check a bunch of people.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.960
My conclusions from this are actually learn how to run PowerPoint.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.320
We should check a bunch of vaccinated people getting tissue samples, especially if we focus

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.600
on harmed people, but that's not necessary. We could also just focus on regular unharmed people

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.480
and see if this plasma DNA is integrating into the genomes of any of their stem cells. It leaves

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.880
a calling card that is there. One of the reasons why I'm focusing on this is because

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:54.200
it's kind of different from a lot of the other imagined harms where you can't really prove it.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.000
You can be suspicious because of the timing, but you can't really prove it. This one,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.160
you can prove it because it leaves a calling card. Okay, now that's really nice, but keep in mind

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:10.280
the one general mechanism that we've talked about time and time again, make sure you understand

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:21.160
that he's not able to blame this mechanism on the shot, sorry, the DNA. And that mechanism is

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:28.840
the mechanism that that Sukhrat Bhakti really codified best. It is the mechanism if I draw

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:36.120
the inside of a capillary here, okay, with endothelial cells beating these rectangles,

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:43.800
which of course is terrible. And so you have blood flow this way. Then when these cells get

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.520
transfected and they're very likely to get transfected, because again, these are cells that are

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:55.080
are experiencing a lot of local fluid pressure here. And so this is supposed to be where the

01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:00.280
lipid nanoparticle will come into contact with membrane the most. And of course, the surface

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:08.680
area of your capillaries in your body is ginormous. When these cells are expressing spike protein,

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:17.640
the first shot, they will be attacked by the immune system and removed. And you hope that the spike

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:23.240
protein is presented to the immune system and you develop antibodies to it. And this would be

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:32.760
the first shot. The second shot and beyond will give you spike protein down here. And you will

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:40.040
have antibodies that stick to it. And those antibodies can bring in a cytotoxic T cell response. They

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.640
could bring in a a natural killer cell response, a neutrophil response. They could bring in the

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.960
complement system. And they can also cause complement to cling to the outside of the cell

01:16:51.960 --> 01:17:00.840
if there's enough spike protein. And that can cause clotting, micro clotting or just playing

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:08.040
clotting. And so this general mechanism will occur irrespective of whether the special spike

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.560
protein is there or whether it's a frog protein or or another membrane bond protein that's not

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:19.640
supposed to be there. There's a good chance that transfection into the muscle that leaks out into

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:27.560
your into circulation will will transfect endothelial cells and you'll get this possibility for every

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:33.800
subsequent exposure to the transfection because it will express that protein again in the presence

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:40.840
of those antibodies. That's a very different effect than what we've been talking about with regard

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.120
with regard to this, what what he's been saying with the DNA. And why is that important just to

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:54.280
acknowledge that it's this time when these cells are destroyed that neutrophils will come along,

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:04.520
should be neutra, neutra. Is it pH? I think it's pH, right? Neutrophils,

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:12.200
something's not compiled there, right? Neutrophils will come along and they destroy things with

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:21.320
enzymes. Those enzymes will release. These cells are flexible. These cells contain fibers in them

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.240
that make them flexible. And when the neutrophils come along to dissolve these guys, they have a

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:35.240
very special neutrophil elastase, which is a neutrophil enzyme. Elastase is the enzyme

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.160
that can destroy some of those fibers. And then those fibers are now floating around

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:48.680
and part of this cleanup. And so again, you hope that your cells won't present those

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.560
self-antigens to T cells and find a T cell that will recognize them. You hope that they're only

01:18:53.560 --> 01:19:01.080
going to present the S protein. But when those fibers are released and they're building up,

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:08.520
they don't necessarily get cleared. And that seems to be these fibrous clots that are found in some

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:14.200
of these people that are dead. So it could be that a lot of endothelial cells are being destroyed

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:23.160
each shot or on the deadly shot. And that that fibrin that's released when the neutrophil

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:30.120
elastase is dissolving endothelial cells is part of that clotting mechanism as well.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.200
And so again, this has nothing to do with DNA integration or anything like that because this

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:45.480
is just expression of a foreign protein driven by transfection. And so I need, I'm hoping that

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:54.200
you can keep in mind how general this is up here, how general this is versus how the DNA is a very

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:59.400
it's an interesting thing. I'm no doubt about it and could be devastating and ugly and yucky. But

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.400
if the DNA integrates into your endothelial cells, your endothelial cells are not going to be passed

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.480
onto your children. So the real danger would be if it integrated into your gametes, into your

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:18.360
eggs or into your sperm. And that's very testable, obviously, especially with sperm,

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:25.880
to a certain extent, at least it should be. And it you have all the eggs that you're ever going to

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:32.680
have as a woman. So as a girl, so that's extremely terrifying from the perspective of young women

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:39.480
being exposed to DNA contamination. So there you have very much dangerous crazy things.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:46.280
But it's important to understand that this mechanism above, which was really best and first described

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:52.040
by Sukhir Bhakti is a mechanism that is completely independent of the spike protein being extra

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:58.200
toxic, extra dangerous, having any clotting factors coded into it or whatever other magic you want to

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:05.000
say, because it doesn't matter what protein you express via transfection. If it's transmembrane

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:12.600
and it sticks out and you do it repeatedly, that endothelial cells are going to be the target of

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.400
this, this clearance, this autoimmunity is potentially there. And also the clotting is always there. The

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.520
more shots you take, the more possible it is, I think. And we may see that as we move forward

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.000
as we get people with four or five shots. Who knows?

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:39.400
You find it in the stem cells of harmed people. It's equivalent to finding a certain type of lid

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.480
in someone who is now dead. It's pretty reasonable to assume that that's what caused it.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:51.320
The royal we, meaning you guys should insist that the FDA force Pfizer to get the DNA out of the

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:57.240
booster and all future versions of this vaccine. I'm a real fan of this platform. Okay. I think

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:03.640
it has the potential to treat cancers. I really believe that this platform is revolutionary and

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:10.120
in your lifetime, there will be mRNA vaccines against antigens in your unique cancer. Okay.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.680
And but they got to get this problem fixed. Okay. And I right now, I think the financial incentives

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.400
are too great to just keep on rolling with it. And it's going to take some encouragement to get it

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:25.640
out. The regulation that allowed this DNA to be there in the first place. I don't think that this

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:32.040
amounts there actually exceed the regulation limits. In some batches, it may. In the two batches that

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.160
I looked at, one of them, it was just under the limit and one, it was just over the limit. My

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.920
colleague in Boston has looked at a fair number of other batches. And there's a handful that are

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.400
super high and there's a handful that are super low. But the fact that there is a regulatory threshold

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:49.400
for amount of DNA allowed in the vaccine is a throwback to an era when we were talking about

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.720
vaccines that were like a recombinant protein that you are a dead virus, you know, attenuated virus

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:59.560
produced in CFO cells or something like that. And the DNA that might be in it is naked DNA.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.800
And you might have a little bit in the vaccine. That's not a problem because naked DNA gets

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.880
chewed up immediately upon vaccination. And there's no real mechanism for it to get inside the cells.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.680
And they inappropriately applied that regulatory limit to this new kind of vaccine where everything

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:17.080
is encapsulated in a slip and nanoparticle is basically packaged in a synthetic virus able

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.040
to dump its contents into a cell. So I'm thinking Hanlon's razor here. Okay, I don't think there

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:27.320
was anything nefarious here. I think it was just kind of a dumb oversight. And it's going to take,

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.480
because the financial incentives are so great to just, you know, sweep it under the rug and the

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.440
career incentives of people that approve this are going to be, there's nothing wrong here,

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:40.120
you know, it's going to take some encouragement to make people prove that it's okay. But I really

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.680
believe this was an inappropriate application of an old school regulation to a new kind of

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.440
vaccine. And who knows, maybe we'll check a bunch of people and we'll find out for sure that this

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.840
is indeed not a problem. And that will do the public good if we prove that. Mr. Chairman.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.560
So that's pretty spectacular. I mean, he's giving them the opportunity to prove that it's

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.320
not bad. So we could do some papers and publish some stuff and this, this whole rumor could go away.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.160
But he believes in this technology and he doesn't want this technology to be ruined or lost.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:20.280
And so tell me you hear it. Tell me you see exactly what I see. A guy who has been interested

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.880
in the virus since the very beginning. He gave us a number of testing platforms so that we,

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.600
we definitely had a mystery to solve. And we definitely had bad guys to catch

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.000
because his tests prove it.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:39.480
Wow.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.920
I mean, he said it in spades. It's just, it's crazy. It's just absolutely crazy. I don't know

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.000
how else to say it. I mean, they're doing exactly what we expected them to do.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.840
And it's not even a little bit off right now. And so now the only question is how can we get ahead

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.320
and stop the dominoes from falling is right now we're right at where it's like we're in a drone

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.960
and we're watching the dominoes fall and we're following it right as the dominoes hit the next

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:19.880
domino. But we're not quite able to stop that one. So the question is how we can leap frog ahead

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.680
a few dominoes and then knock one out of the way or something so that this whole thing just ends.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.840
I think that's really kind of a way we need to think about it.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.120
Does that mean we need to teach our children?

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.760
Does that mean we need to save the children? I think that's what it means.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.520
We've got to think farther ahead the next year. That's for sure. We don't need to save the next

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:54.200
election. We need to save the next generation. We need to save our kids. We need within the next

01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:03.640
five years we need a group of kids to go into college not believing this or better yet not going

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:14.680
to college. How's that for a big statement? We need to raise a kid's kids not to need to go to college.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.200
We need to figure out a way for them to do it without it or do it at another means.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.880
Maybe they can all take classes at the Jordan Peterson online university and combine that with

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:33.880
Prager and whatever Brett Weinstein's going to do. I don't know what the answers are ladies and

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.200
gentlemen but I know that we are being bamboozled. We are being fooled and every time somebody new

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.680
steps up to the mic it seems like they just stay on script. Okay.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400
Thank you.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:53.000
Dr. We appreciate all that you're saying although we don't understand most of what you're saying.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Sorry. I have a limited amount of time somewhere down there agreeing a lot so you must have been

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:04.920
a chemistry major or something but what is going to help us is to know what you can do like

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.320
checking a bunch of vaccinated people. Of course that's what I can do right but we

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.600
are not going to have any authority over the FDA to force Pfizer to do something.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.560
I mean that's a federal issue unless you can explain to me how we could do something at a

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.800
state level you know some of this is going to have to be taken up by our congressmen right.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.520
So just whatever your remaining comments are just keep in mind that I understand what we can do

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.280
and really these technical things you're throwing out as a senator from Greenville's

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.680
already mentioned we're going to throw right back at you because there's no you're the expert

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.520
so if someone's going to do this testing I don't know who would find to do it

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.680
well other than someone like you. I can do it lots of other people can do it. I've had a lot

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:54.840
of corners and pharmacists from different states contact me I posted all this on Twitter right

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.760
and so people will private message me and say I'd like to send you some samples and then they say

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.560
oops state regulations will not allow our coroner to send any samples for this so there are some

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:10.360
policy issues that can the trouble is is if you look for the integration of this DNA and you

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.040
don't find it what does it mean doesn't mean you didn't look in the right place that you sampled

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:26.760
the wrong part of the thigh like what I don't even know what I think this is is again one of these

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.960
kind of scooby-doo unmaskings where here's the bad guy over here we better solve that puzzle now

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.560
and it won't get us any farther down the road because we're not questioning the spread of the

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.960
virus we're not questioning the protocols we're not questioning the biology of transfection at all

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.520
we're really not questioning anything if we follow this narrative we follow this story we

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:56.840
chase this shiny object that none other than Kevin McCurnan put in front of us

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:03.560
and he only put it in front of us after I started talking about clones and the scooby-doo

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:10.200
and before that everything was great and he was on my stream twice and he was telling me all about

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:18.120
how the PCR had had primers that made little dimers and that the RNA was in pure because of

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:26.680
the smear on the gel there is a big game of foot ladies and gentlemen and we are

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:34.920
very very close to tying the game are you with me are you with me we're very very close to

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:42.040
tying this game we've got to keep the pressure up we've got to keep working we've got to keep

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:49.000
showing up every day for our family and friends we've got to keep showing up every day for our

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:57.720
family and friends and we've got to keep from letting them recite the faith letting them be

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:05.400
bamboozled into the faith because it's very easy to be bamboozled and trapped into thinking

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:12.120
that one of these tv scenarios is still really not that ridiculous because it fits I mean I was

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.960
sick you were sick my neighbor was sick so obviously there was something

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:24.600
it's a very enticing trap but the conflated background signal is the best explanation the

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:32.520
widest net doesn't have to have specifics I'm just very sure that they have absolutely zero data

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:40.680
before 2020 about the prevalence of any of these RNA signals they have no idea what these PCR tests

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:46.200
would have found in 2019 and how many people would have tested positive without being a

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:56.360
symptomatic at all meaning we don't know whether this is noise or not most likely it is most likely

01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:01.320
it's a signal of noise that they characterized very well before the pandemic so they knew exactly

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:08.200
what was there and how to use it do you understand what I'm saying most likely they characterized

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.920
the noise that was there already a long time ago so that during the pandemic they would know how

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:19.080
to use it that's what Nathan Wolf was doing that's what the eco-health alliance was doing

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.160
characterizing this background so that maybe an endemic coronavirus could be blamed I don't know

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:35.240
if that's what the background really is biologically maybe we haven't been able to track coronaviruses

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.800
before this we can find them if you call it what we do finding them

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.120
but we can't track and trace them like we claim to suddenly be able to do with this one just because

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:53.880
it's so novel protocols were murder and transfection is in medicine it could have been an infectious

01:31:53.880 --> 01:32:00.520
clone I think an infectious clone is a very good plausible explanation of how a genuine sequence

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:08.200
could have genuinely be found using PCR to amplify them even if it's 99 primer pairs you could get a

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:15.240
really robust signal across lots of primer pairs if you had seeded the pandemic with an infectious

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:24.440
clone and maybe an infectious clone would actually make people have a kind of recognizable suite of

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.760
symptoms maybe not I don't know but I definitely know if you needed the seeding of a molecular

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:36.040
signal that molecular biologists around the world would say holy shit there's a pandemic

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:44.280
that's how you do it infectious clone a transfection agent releases another way of saying that because

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:51.480
when you spray RNA into people's lungs or put it in their drinking water or or spray it in the air

01:32:51.880 --> 01:33:00.440
then you're transfecting them so conflated background signals where we are protocols were

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:06.760
murder and transfection is not medicine and that holds true to you if you don't believe in viruses

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:12.120
but of course that's a really ridiculous statement because viruses are a very tiny fraction of the

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:19.320
total signal at that size scale because all of our tissues communicate with signals at that time

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:26.120
scale that include DNA and RNA and proteins and all the mammals and all the plants and all the

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:33.800
fungi and all the bacteria that we know also communicate with particles, vesicles and other

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.680
things at that time scale or size scale that are very hard to separate from one another

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.920
and virology would like you to believe that when they spin stuff down and it's that size in the

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
sucrose gradient the only thing that's there are us only viruses here

01:33:53.080 --> 01:34:00.360
when in reality they know that that fraction it goes down the farthest in that sucrose gradient

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:09.320
is full of exosomes full of vesicles full of protein blobs full of things of the same size

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:16.600
scale not of all of which are these crazy viruses that's what Nathan Wolf was selling as his big

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:24.600
thing that he could explore this crazy unknown place and find unknown life forms

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.880
there's a conflated background signal ladies and gentlemen leak release lies it doesn't even

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.960
matter because the protocols were murder and transfection is not medicine these people have

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:41.400
fooled us into believing that it is medicine they've fooled us into believing that there is a novel

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:48.600
virus they fooled us into believing that gain of function is real in order to invert our

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.320
sovereignty and take it away from our children come on ladies and gentlemen they caused this stuff

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.440
by inverting the way we think

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:04.040
this graph was never shown to us just this one down here in the bottom and they just

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.480
used the red one that's it went from zero and went up to something and they were just tacking on

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:16.920
stuff that they killed people with bad protocols and bad tests if they needed a signal if you need

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:24.760
a signal it's a clone that's all you need is a clone

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:31.720
i don't know if it's all about the genetic data but it's it's a lot about that and it's about

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:36.600
convincing your kids right it's not about you they don't need you your old all your data that's

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.720
useful is gone they don't want to they can't tell all you got here without the data from before

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.320
but they've got to convince your kids that when they have kids they should be giving up their data

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.280
that's what this is about i know it's crazy but that's how they work that's their time frame their

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:59.000
time scale their time horizon they've got this plan for a lot farther than you think so if you

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:06.120
want to turn this cruise ship around it's going to be a long process we got to get untied we got to

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:12.280
get back to the bridge we got to disable the autopilot we got to slow the ship down

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:21.880
and then we can start turning the rudder ladies and gentlemen please join me at giga-ohm biological

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:29.960
and that's dot com and then giga-ohm dot bio for communications for support thank you very much

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:36.200
transfection is not immunization it's the first of october 2023 i never dreamed i would still be

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.040
using this slide stop all transfections and humans because they are trying to eliminate the control

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:48.680
group by any means necessary i never thought i'd be using this slide in 2023 but it's still fully

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:54.840
relevant and it will remain relevant until the truth really is out there this has been giga-ohm

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.640
biological a high resistance low noise information brought to you by a biologist thanks for joining

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:06.120
me sorry i was late i'll see you again tomorrow night maybe tomorrow afternoon but tomorrow for

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:22.040
sure because we do a show every day here at giga-ohm biological thanks very much

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:53.160
so

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:28.120
My one wheel has a flat, I was filming today, I got a flat, not so any way, but I think I have a solution, I'm in the mail tomorrow.
