00:59.107 --> 01:09.295
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

01:10.035 --> 01:11.997
It's measles plus.

01:12.117 --> 01:17.621
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

01:17.921 --> 01:19.883
It's just a big hassle in the end.

01:23.018 --> 01:36.237
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.801
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

01:48.617 --> 01:50.282
Hi, this is JC on a Bike.

01:50.783 --> 01:53.351
I'm going to start a new series called JC in the Woods.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.902
This series is going to be a storytelling series.

01:57.102 --> 02:00.044
It's a little bit of American history and a little bit of modern history.

02:00.565 --> 02:06.630
And the idea is to try and relay some of the things that I've been studying and reading about since I was a teenager.

02:07.510 --> 02:13.295
A lot of these things in history are called conspiracy theories, but actually what they are are real history.

02:13.795 --> 02:15.316
So what does the New World Order want?

02:15.597 --> 02:17.078
They want to end nation states.

02:17.198 --> 02:21.001
They've always wanted to end nation states and bring in one world government.

02:21.341 --> 02:27.166
That one world government has always been spookily attached to the United Nations.

02:27.486 --> 02:30.348
And so it wouldn't surprise me if that's in the end the way that we go.

02:30.768 --> 02:35.812
We will crash the euro, a fiat currency, newly instituted about 20 years ago.

02:36.112 --> 02:40.796
We will crash the American dollar, because that's also a fiat currency.

02:41.196 --> 02:46.100
And then we will have most of the population of the Western world asking for a solution.

02:46.440 --> 02:50.183
And that solution will be a one world government with a new one world currency.

02:51.112 --> 02:52.393
Let's talk about it in the woods.

03:07.926 --> 03:11.849
So I want to tell you this story about my roommate, the conspiracy theorist.

03:13.931 --> 03:15.952
He told me a story about the New World Order.

03:16.953 --> 03:19.996
The New World Order is a cabal of loosely organized groups

03:20.760 --> 03:25.643
which use the power of fractional reserve banking to control governments around the world.

03:26.343 --> 03:36.389
Fractional reserve banking is the idea that a bank only needs to have X amount of money in its vaults in order to loan out X times 10 amount of money to people in charge interest.

03:37.029 --> 03:52.166
If you're not familiar with how fractional reserve banking works, I suggest you google it before you watch the rest of this film, simply because the whole story that I'm about to tell you is based on the idea that governments around the world are controlled by fractional reserve banking.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.748
I want to tell you guys a story.

03:54.642 --> 04:00.364
And it's a story about a roommate of mine that I had in college in the early 90s.

04:00.424 --> 04:01.604
I graduated from high school in 1990.

04:03.205 --> 04:06.606
And so I met this guy in Chicago when I went to university there.

04:07.286 --> 04:11.428
And this guy was already a very big conspiracy theorist at 18 years old.

04:12.928 --> 04:20.290
And he got me really into trying to read about alternative interpretations of modern political events.

04:20.330 --> 04:25.412
He got me into JFK, into the Oklahoma City bombing.

04:25.432 --> 04:29.673
He introduced me to Ted Gunderson and guys like Mike Rupert who were

04:30.513 --> 04:49.208
Guys that seem pretty credible sources that had either worked for the FBI or in Mike Rupert's case had worked for the LAPD for a long time and had come out as sort of anti-government conspiracy people that were suggesting that law enforcement and the FBI and the government were working together to sort of

04:50.189 --> 04:52.971
control society by alternative means.

04:53.511 --> 05:05.558
Mostly by using fractional reserve banking and other means of control like drugs and sex and this kind of thing to control Congress and to control the government.

05:06.359 --> 05:09.561
Where this story begins is with things like the Bilderberg Group.

05:10.294 --> 05:11.675
and the Bohemian Grove.

05:12.036 --> 05:19.041
These kinds of conspiracy theories that revolved around a pyramid of groups that a lot of times ended with the Illuminati at the top.

05:19.682 --> 05:25.567
These groups, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, these groups exist.

05:26.027 --> 05:35.895
And they exist in some sort of organizational structure which has for a long time been documented by a number of different people in a number of different books.

05:36.395 --> 05:46.866
And these have always been labeled as kind of crazy, but the interesting thing is, and through all of these conspiracy theories, it's a it's a cabal of people that are controlling the left and the right.

05:47.287 --> 05:56.757
And so all the conspiracy theories that I knew when I was younger, and including the one that this roommate of mine told me about, were conspiracy theories that involved

05:57.403 --> 06:00.005
group of people controlling the left and the right.

06:00.425 --> 06:10.511
And so conspiracy theorists were outside of the dichotomy that was the functioning, you know, United States government theater that we all are sort of bamboozled by at the moment.

06:13.772 --> 06:26.600
All of these things get me thinking about, you know, what would my old roommate have said was going on right now if he were experiencing the coronavirus quarantine?

06:31.184 --> 06:33.466
And I think it has to come back to the NWO.

06:33.666 --> 06:34.927
What is the New World Order?

06:35.007 --> 06:36.408
What was the New World Order?

06:38.630 --> 06:41.832
And by the New World Order, we're talking about the thing that George H.W.

06:41.872 --> 06:45.035
Bush spoke about in front of the United Nations way back when.

06:45.055 --> 06:46.376
It might have been 1996 already.

06:56.024 --> 07:00.749
And as we think about this stuff, you really need to remember your history.

07:00.989 --> 07:03.872
If you don't remember your history, then none of this stuff will make sense.

07:05.133 --> 07:11.419
But if you remember your history, and you go back, piece by piece, this stuff just falls together.

07:11.459 --> 07:15.183
And the most parsimonious explanation is that the theater is still in business.

07:16.224 --> 07:17.285
And it's the same theater.

07:30.868 --> 07:40.874
Now you can go back 20 or 40 years and find books which talk about the step-by-step process by which they were going to introduce the New World Order.

07:41.654 --> 07:47.798
And it started a long time ago with putting the dollar as a fiat currency rather than having it tied to gold.

07:49.779 --> 08:02.095
One of the parts of this story that's really interesting is that for a long time people have claimed that one of the reasons why Kennedy was shot was because he was trying to put the dollar back on a silver standard and they didn't want that.

08:13.030 --> 08:31.698
Anyway, the point is that back in the 90s, they were telling all kinds of stories about how this cabal of rich people, connected people, were controlling governments using a combination of pedophilia, sex, drugs, and money, and that through bribery and blackmail, most of the U.S.

08:31.758 --> 08:32.899
Congress was controlled.

08:33.839 --> 08:46.828
This was the conspiracy theory that was going around in the 1990s and this was tied together with the Oklahoma City bombing as being largely staged and later on has 9-11 being largely staged.

08:47.209 --> 08:54.854
A number of people don't know some of those details about 9-11 that still strike us all as odd to this day because we don't talk about them anymore.

08:55.274 --> 08:57.516
There's no footage of the plane that hit the Pentagon.

08:57.817 --> 09:07.486
There's no evidence that a plane did hit the Pentagon because there were no seats or no engines removed from the crash, even though these are things that usually don't get destroyed when a plane hits the ground.

09:07.986 --> 09:19.357
And furthermore, there was this Building 7 problem that no one ever really talks about anymore, but Building 7 is one of the best examples of a part of a story that gets eliminated the moment that it doesn't really jive

09:19.757 --> 09:21.159
with the intended narrative.

09:21.660 --> 09:26.066
And Building 7 is probably one of the more interesting structural failures ever caught on film.

09:26.426 --> 09:27.768
So if you haven't seen it, Google it.

09:27.808 --> 09:28.328
It's really fun.

09:29.680 --> 09:35.022
If you're not really familiar with the 9-11 conspiracy theories, I'm not really going to rehash those here.

09:35.702 --> 09:42.205
But if you want to get started with it, you want to look for the plane at the Pentagon, and you want to look for what happened with Building 7.

09:43.205 --> 09:48.968
Most of the current accounts of 9-11 don't really talk about Building 7 anymore, and Building 7 is the one where really

09:49.668 --> 09:51.068
the laws of physics are broken.

09:51.749 --> 10:02.411
If you want to search it, specifically look for the size of the steel beams that were used in that building and why they were used and what was underneath that building and why that building was so strongly built.

10:04.592 --> 10:13.714
Like it or not, the effects of 9-11 were a very big boon for all of those industries that Eisenhower warned us about all those years ago.

10:19.011 --> 10:20.913
Then you say to yourself, well, Jay, come on.

10:21.493 --> 10:23.275
That's not a very scary conspiracy.

10:24.196 --> 10:26.718
That rich people use money to control politicians?

10:27.359 --> 10:28.180
That's no big deal.

10:29.461 --> 10:31.422
But it's not just controlling politicians.

10:31.563 --> 10:38.589
The story in the conspiracy theory is that they control governments, and by governments then they control society.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.212
Societies are the world.

10:42.136 --> 10:57.763
So global governance in this NWO conspiracy model has a group of people not connected to the Democrats or the Republicans or the Labor Party or the Tories, but that work above and beyond these silly divisions that we fight about.

11:00.284 --> 11:09.769
And the thing that is really creepy about this is that the New World Order, as it was codified in the 80s and 90s when I was into this when I was younger,

11:10.683 --> 11:14.105
The New World Order wanted a few things already back then.

11:14.125 --> 11:20.710
I think one of the things that you can really look up if you haven't seen it is Aaron Russo's movie.

11:21.330 --> 11:31.017
If you don't know who Aaron Russo is, he's a director from the 90s and made a lot of movies for Hollywood before he became friends with one of the Rockefellers.

11:31.698 --> 11:34.780
And the Rockefeller boy told him the plan.

11:37.714 --> 11:54.045
And that plan is to chip us all, to get rid of cash, and to have us have a chip under our skin that is our identification chip, that also has our money on it, with the idea that if they wanted to make us drop out of society, if they wanted to turn us off, they could.

11:57.427 --> 11:58.428
This is in that movie.

11:59.809 --> 12:00.970
I can't remember what it's called.

12:01.070 --> 12:07.394
America... I'm flashing it up on the screen now because, of course, I looked it up before I posted this video.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.671
And coronavirus easily fits into this narrative.

12:14.871 --> 12:25.035
It's one of the things that was suggested already 10 years ago as a method of ushering in the last two bits of the New World Order.

12:26.836 --> 12:29.797
And the last two bits of the New World Order are the craziest ones.

12:31.798 --> 12:34.439
The last two bits are a cashless economy.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.782
And of course they want to get rid of end-to-end encryption.

12:38.822 --> 12:40.083
That's what the EARN IT Act is.

12:40.363 --> 12:55.334
If you look up the EARN IT Act right now, you already find that Congress is working on it right now to get rid of end-to-end encryption on our phones so that they can read and monitor your messages all the time.

12:57.095 --> 13:02.959
But the other thing that the New World Order wants is a cashless economy, and they want to get rid of nation states.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.081
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

13:06.112 --> 13:08.655
Now you're talking about the United Nations conspiracy.

13:08.695 --> 13:10.157
Yeah, yeah, that's the same one.

13:10.998 --> 13:22.112
The one that we've been talking about for 40 years, that the United Nations was going to be called in to take over America, and we would surrender our sovereignty to the United Nations.

13:23.336 --> 13:35.865
Well, imagine a scenario where a global pandemic takes down the EU and America all at once, and we're begging them for a global government led by the United Nations.

13:38.046 --> 13:43.930
They're going to get rid of the elections, because of course we can't have an election now.

13:44.010 --> 13:44.991
It's already happening.

13:45.011 --> 13:46.572
The primaries are being cancelled.

13:53.852 --> 13:55.013
And so I think it started.

13:55.033 --> 14:21.068
I mean, what a wonderful, exciting time to be in America when this kind of stuff, when everything aligns so well with the history conspiracy theory that people have been telling for 40 or 80 years about how the Federal Reserve Bank is just actually a cabal of privately owned banks controlled by privately owned banks.

14:23.038 --> 14:31.520
And these private owners of our banks control all the world's governments with a combination of money, drugs, and women.

14:34.381 --> 14:47.284
Now, they've let out a nice, convenient biocontagion, and they are amplifying the panic of it as much as they possibly can.

14:50.945 --> 14:51.825
And we will be left

14:53.263 --> 14:56.705
with China and Russia against the rest of the world.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.467
If you don't think it's happening, just watch and make sure it doesn't.

15:02.107 --> 15:03.287
I hope it doesn't happen.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.869
But I'm telling you, that's what they want to happen.

15:06.449 --> 15:09.290
They want... We'll actually be left with India.

15:10.651 --> 15:13.212
But that was one definitely wrong thing there.

15:13.232 --> 15:13.472
Whoops.

15:14.949 --> 15:15.610
to chip you.

15:15.970 --> 15:24.319
They want to put a chip in your hand so that they can scan you whenever they want to scan you, and your medical records will be there, your behavior records will be there.

15:24.679 --> 15:32.227
They will be able to track where you go, follow your movements, and turn off your money and contact with society whenever they want to.

15:33.188 --> 15:34.029
That's their plan.

15:34.489 --> 15:37.112
That's the big scary part of the NWO.

15:37.978 --> 15:42.300
Now, if you don't think that's happening, then you don't have to worry about the coronavirus being a hoax.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.741
It's probably just a virus, and we need to be terrified.

15:48.462 --> 15:53.084
Hi, this is JC on a bike, called in to take over a can.

15:56.726 --> 16:02.468
And we will be left with China and Russia against the rest of the world.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.267
If you don't think it's happening, just watch and make sure it doesn't.

16:07.887 --> 16:09.068
I hope it doesn't happen.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.651
But I'm telling you, that's what they want to happen.

16:12.231 --> 16:13.632
They want to chip you.

16:13.993 --> 16:18.797
They want to put a chip in your hand so that they can scan you whenever they want to scan you.

16:18.857 --> 16:20.439
And your medical records will be there.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.320
Your behavior records will be there.

16:22.701 --> 16:30.207
They will be able to track where you go, follow your movements, and turn off your money and contact with society whenever they want to.

16:31.168 --> 16:32.029
That's their plan.

16:32.489 --> 16:35.211
That's the big scary part of the NWO.

16:35.992 --> 16:40.255
Now, if you don't think that's happening, then you don't have to worry about the coronavirus being a hoax.

16:40.675 --> 16:43.697
It's probably just a virus, and we need to be terrified.

16:45.038 --> 16:45.779
But what if it's not?

16:47.520 --> 16:48.501
What if this is a plan?

16:50.182 --> 16:53.484
What if this is the final stage of that plan?

16:54.285 --> 16:58.188
The plan that people have been talking about since the 50s and 60s.

16:59.690 --> 17:03.072
The plan that people have been talking about since Kennedy was shot.

17:04.173 --> 17:07.736
The plan that people have been talking about since the Oklahoma City bombing.

17:08.977 --> 17:15.141
The plan that people have been talking about since the League of Nations was instituted, followed by the United Nations.

17:16.342 --> 17:21.265
The plan that people have been talking about since the IMF was first instituted.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.107
And the World Bank.

17:23.967 --> 17:28.711
The plan that everybody's been talking about that originated with the Rothschilds.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.372
What if this plan is real?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.755
And what if the coronavirus is a part of it?

17:36.836 --> 17:40.739
That's the scary story of real human history.

17:44.281 --> 17:46.723
Not everything perfect there, but it wasn't too bad.

17:47.564 --> 17:49.765
I would have to say that's not too bad.

17:49.866 --> 17:51.347
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.928
This is GigaOM Biological.

17:54.769 --> 17:58.312
It's a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

17:58.372 --> 17:59.273
I'll see you in a few minutes.

18:15.069 --> 18:24.291
Honestly, I agree with the person in the chat who said that the cell phone is the chip in your hand because in reality, we're all happily carrying it already, I think.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.531
I don't care how you get there.

18:25.551 --> 18:28.291
I don't care what you do to get there.

18:28.311 --> 18:30.872
The goal is to win.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.503
What time is it?

18:36.563 --> 18:37.323
Game time!

18:37.423 --> 18:37.683
Woo!

18:44.505 --> 18:47.666
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, it's an interesting battle we're in right now.

18:47.686 --> 18:49.626
We do need to keep our wits about us.

18:49.826 --> 18:58.628
We do need to love our neighbors, stay focused on the biology, and definitely not take the bait on social media as we struggle through our daily ride.

18:59.288 --> 19:01.129
The daily grind is never going to go away.

19:02.189 --> 19:10.156
And I think the best way we can think about it is what Solar Fire said, you have to think of the cell phone as already basically a chip in your hand.

19:10.836 --> 19:19.003
It can already be measuring an awful lot, especially with regard to what you're thinking every day and how you react to thoughts that are put in front of you.

19:19.043 --> 19:26.269
And that's why I keep saying we got to get our kids off of social media before they completely acquiesce to that programming.

19:26.869 --> 19:30.192
before we lose control of what's in front of them.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.653
We've already lost control of what's in front of their eyes.

19:33.234 --> 19:40.599
And so please understand how imperative this is, how important it is that this is the most important non-compliance.

19:40.639 --> 19:54.170
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason nor an answer.

19:55.050 --> 20:02.813
And you can say the same thing about pandemics and gain-of-function, that we've been fooled into believing, into teaching our kids if we don't get out of this trap.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.053
That is the trick.

20:04.133 --> 20:13.276
We have to teach this stuff to our kids so we can still choose to opt out by teaching them a new model of biology which precludes this nonsense.

20:13.956 --> 20:27.360
And that's why GigaOM is the biology they choose to ignore, because we have, I think, a monopoly on that idea, a monopoly on that new model, because they can't afford to take it from us.

20:28.121 --> 20:30.802
It's the truth that will set you free, I think.

20:32.322 --> 20:37.264
And we're in the process of making it into a high school slash freshman biology course.

20:38.064 --> 20:44.287
And at that point, we'll roll it out publicly and all of you will be able to enjoy it, share it, and push it around.

20:44.707 --> 20:47.328
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooley.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.269
I'm chief biologist at Gigoloan Biological.

20:49.309 --> 20:52.270
I come to you live out of the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

20:52.690 --> 20:57.352
The occasional bouncing you hear is the working out of my son in the garage with a basketball or two.

20:58.453 --> 21:05.700
You can find the work of my academic career on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, using my last name, my first two initials.

21:06.081 --> 21:18.094
You can also find a lot of my ideas contorted and distorted by a traitorous American author on Substack called Jessica Hockett, writing under the Substack Woodhouse 76.

21:19.736 --> 21:38.598
She has fake dialogues with Claire Craig of Heart and Pierre Corey, formerly of FLCCC, now the IMA, and also with Mike Yeadon, the guy from Pfizer, and Jay Bhattacharya, our current Health and Human Services Secretary, who claimed many times to have learned more biology from me than anyone else during the pandemic, and now

21:39.119 --> 21:40.421
Doesn't seem to need to call me.

21:40.481 --> 21:49.690
By the way, the YouTube channel JC on a Bike is currently under a strike and has been suddenly limited because apparently I don't have sufficient channel history.

21:52.120 --> 22:10.746
And so uh because of that reason I'm now streaming on my second channel JC in the woods and so if you would do me a favor and go ahead and go to youtube and and subscribe to that channel because that will also help me there because there's only like 170 who have found that and then while you're at it you can look up JC on the hardwood

22:11.286 --> 22:17.751
And also subscribe to that channel because that's where a lot of the new biology is going to show up very, very soon.

22:18.732 --> 22:24.697
We seem to have to spread it a little around and let me just say it very clearly from the corner here.

22:24.817 --> 22:26.238
Hopefully I did this already.

22:26.859 --> 22:27.559
No, I didn't.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.100
Darn.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.601
Let me set that up quick.

22:31.681 --> 22:33.342
I didn't do it on either computer.

22:33.362 --> 22:38.985
Now that's really some serious, some serious negligent production here.

22:39.045 --> 22:40.125
I apologize for that.

22:40.165 --> 22:44.688
I do need to lower this to A. Then at least this one should work while I goof around.

22:44.748 --> 22:45.068
Nope.

22:45.388 --> 22:46.329
It's not either.

22:46.489 --> 22:46.929
Focus.

22:47.169 --> 22:47.569
Darn it.

22:49.911 --> 22:50.951
Sorry about this guys.

22:51.011 --> 22:53.632
I'm really just not at my game here.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.075
Let me see if I can switch this on and then focus again.

22:59.088 --> 23:00.009
on my hand.

23:04.931 --> 23:08.532
So, yeah, what was I saying there?

23:08.572 --> 23:09.733
I don't even remember anymore.

23:11.013 --> 23:14.375
Anyway, this is all a work in progress.

23:14.775 --> 23:16.316
I've helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:16.356 --> 23:18.116
write his Wuhan cover-up book.

23:18.156 --> 23:21.398
If you look in that book, in the acknowledgments page, you can find my name.

23:21.938 --> 23:35.416
along with a lot of other names of people, especially at the first paragraph of the acknowledgements page, that know that most or all of the stuff that I teach regularly on my stream, I was already teaching everybody at Children's Health Defense at the end of 2023.

23:36.838 --> 23:48.044
So there are just a few rock solid home runs contained in that book, just from the perspective of the acknowledgements page and all of that being basically a witness list.

23:48.525 --> 23:53.728
And number two, just the contents of the book and especially the kinds of things that I added in there.

23:54.608 --> 23:58.390
And again, a good friend of mine is Jay Bhattacharya, although

23:59.671 --> 24:09.915
He often defers to me as the biologist in the last interview I did with him and has told me many times over the course of the pandemic that he's learned more biology from me than anybody else.

24:10.795 --> 24:12.596
He just can't really tell you what that is.

24:13.296 --> 24:19.258
It's kind of like how Panda and Woodhouse 76 and Nick Hudson all behave with regard to

24:19.858 --> 24:21.079
to what they've learned from me.

24:22.059 --> 24:44.569
This is really unfortunately a stream from an American out of America and so a lot of times it's going to be hard for you as a foreigner to really hear what I'm saying because you will inevitably see an incredibly distorted picture of what's happening in America and an overemphasis and relevance of Donald Trump and his many minions

24:45.509 --> 24:47.430
and the show that they put on.

24:47.490 --> 24:49.490
They are very good at putting on a show.

24:50.070 --> 24:59.012
And I'm sure that social media around the world is very good at amplifying that show as part of an ongoing breakdown of the American democracy.

24:59.052 --> 25:02.353
And I assure you, that is an intentional illusion.

25:02.493 --> 25:05.354
And if so, if you're from the Netherlands, from the UK, from Australia,

25:05.954 --> 25:22.430
know that they murdered people in America in 2020 and they told you that it was a coming pandemic in the same way they're now sort of smearing the American democracy on all sides and then telling you that it's the collapse of America when in fact it's much more complicated than that.

25:22.870 --> 25:29.711
This is a plan that's been long on the way, and it has a lot to do with the national security priority around the Human Genome Project.

25:29.751 --> 25:41.533
So please remember that the advice of this stream, I'm glad you found yourself here, is to stay focused on the biology and what we can know and what they can't.

25:42.333 --> 25:48.535
Don't take the bait on social media, which is more and more transforming into a message of get off of social media.

25:48.955 --> 25:50.815
And finally, love your neighbor, and that means

25:51.255 --> 25:58.960
and getting to know them, getting to understand their values, getting to understand who they are so that we can start to take stock of what communities we live in.

25:59.381 --> 26:13.230
And if it's not possible for you to do that, you might consider the fact that you might be in a tragically dangerous situation should there be even a brief interruption of the power, water, or supply chain.

26:13.791 --> 26:16.673
Because these are all relatively

26:18.163 --> 26:20.386
reasonable possibilities at this stage.

26:20.586 --> 26:33.564
If for no other reason, then we are slowly transitioning into a period where the kind of beehive level of activity and consumerism is going to be no longer possible simply because a lot of those links in the chain are going to become weaker.

26:34.485 --> 26:48.037
And so our economies are going to necessarily have to become smaller and more local and our systems in terms of the United States are going to have to become more local.

26:48.898 --> 26:57.025
And the idea that we have to make iPhones in America is kind of a ridiculous concept for the simple fact that we don't even need iPhones in America.

26:57.895 --> 27:00.699
I mean, we don't need to make them, period.

27:01.260 --> 27:12.458
And I think that's kind of the, once you realize that, then why do we need to worry about all the manufacturing that's in China when we don't even need most things that are made in China?

27:13.419 --> 27:14.300
We might like them.

27:14.980 --> 27:16.141
Our kids might like them.

27:16.621 --> 27:22.405
They might sell if we put them on shelves, but in no way, shape or form do they benefit us as a society.

27:23.285 --> 27:29.609
Maybe they make our garage sales more interesting or they give people in America a lot more things to collect.

27:29.749 --> 27:33.351
But I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I think there's a very easy way out.

27:33.391 --> 27:36.813
It's not a tragic thing at all what we see ourselves faced with.

27:38.274 --> 27:58.305
And so the way this works is that people Support this stream and I mean there's a couple people that just hit home runs every month that I'm not even really allowed to say their names but together with with a few people my family's able to make it and so, you know the reason why a thousand

28:00.306 --> 28:03.290
subscribers isn't even necessary is because of those people.

28:04.591 --> 28:16.384
And in reality, if you think about, you know, I only really need 500 subscribers on Sendowl giving me $10 a month for whatever PDF about biology I would start to put out soon.

28:17.082 --> 28:19.383
And that would already cover everything for my family.

28:19.403 --> 28:21.724
And we wouldn't need to complain about anything anymore.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.625
Just say, thank you.

28:23.745 --> 28:36.751
And in fact, right now I'm in a position, quite frankly, because of the 120 people that are subscribed, plus these king producer donor people that give me, some of them give me $1,000 a month.

28:36.851 --> 28:37.592
Think about that.

28:38.732 --> 28:40.993
So that's the actual math, right?

28:41.033 --> 28:46.156
If you have three of those people giving you somewhere between five and a thousand a month,

28:47.097 --> 28:48.437
500 and a thousand a month.

28:48.577 --> 28:51.778
And then you have a hundred people giving you $10 a month.

28:51.818 --> 28:53.938
That's pretty much rent and bills.

28:55.438 --> 29:01.179
If you make it fit hard, occasionally cover a gap with a credit card.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.820
That's the magic of this stream.

29:03.860 --> 29:05.960
There's nothing else here.

29:06.400 --> 29:10.261
No wellness company, no commercial about some oil.

29:10.361 --> 29:11.581
I'm not selling gold.

29:11.721 --> 29:15.482
I don't have any solutions for your long-term monetary problems.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.949
I'm never gonna tell you to buy Bitcoin.

29:18.749 --> 29:29.751
All I'm going to try and do is develop a high school biology course that can contribute to a new direction for our children, which is a pretty bold statement, but I don't think it is.

29:29.831 --> 29:34.872
I think all of these ideas have been out there and available and just crushed.

29:36.133 --> 29:43.854
And now is the time when, you know, standing on the shoulders of giants and using the tools of the slavers

29:45.061 --> 29:46.762
I think we can invert the tables.

29:47.642 --> 29:56.527
And it is by empowering people to understand, not to tell them they're wrong, but to show them a better idea.

29:56.587 --> 30:00.529
That's exactly what Buckminster Fuller said.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.030
You can't tell people that their model is wrong.

30:03.070 --> 30:04.751
You have to offer them a better one.

30:04.791 --> 30:08.853
And that's what I really am asking for your support to do.

30:09.013 --> 30:13.575
So if you have a way or a possibility, please go to GigaOMBiological.com.

30:15.176 --> 30:16.277
and find a way to do that.

30:16.957 --> 30:21.619
If you go to gigaohmbiological.com, I think that's there, yeah.

30:22.139 --> 30:24.360
You can see there's a live stream link.

30:25.501 --> 30:32.704
There's the Scooby-Doo link there is the one where I wrote this review in 2021 with that Piper Stover lady.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.586
And why isn't it playing anymore?

30:41.498 --> 30:47.502
Anyway, if you scroll down on this website, you can see a schedule that I will start to follow again.

30:47.562 --> 30:49.243
I'm trying to do five days a week.

30:49.423 --> 30:52.325
And then now I'm going to try and get back on that schedule with some of the things.

30:53.805 --> 30:56.047
And yeah, this is an independent bright web.

30:57.128 --> 30:58.069
presentation.

30:58.329 --> 31:05.435
It's one of the few just grassroots, you know, grinding it out one man shows.

31:06.516 --> 31:16.884
There's Mark Housatonic, Mark Kulak out of Boston, there's a guy out of New York by the name of Joe Marshall, and then I don't know really anybody else.

31:17.424 --> 31:39.151
Everybody else has got a rumble contract or a sponsor or several sponsors or just does a podcast on I can or blaze TV or some other bullshit No one else is trying to do what Mark and I and Joe are doing and and we are all just Americans And Joe sends me bushmeat.

31:39.331 --> 31:43.793
That's about all I you know, that's the interactions I've had with Joe, but Joe did come for the

31:44.293 --> 31:49.857
for the in-person GigaOM meeting and I have absolutely no doubts about him as an American patriot.

31:50.898 --> 31:55.421
And the same as the same way that I feel for Mark Kulak, I've met him several times in person.

31:56.321 --> 32:00.845
He has stayed a consistent man of honesty and integrity and

32:02.481 --> 32:18.056
I don't have any other people to compare him to because the people that I know that had the kind of integrity that Mark and Joe have shown me over the last couple years, especially Mark, the only one I knew is Nathan and he's dead.

32:19.215 --> 32:25.318
And so these are very rare individuals in a world full of performers.

32:25.578 --> 32:29.741
And that's why I think the concept of an independent bright web is very important.

32:29.761 --> 32:35.344
You need to understand that everyone on the internet save a very, very, very select few.

32:36.659 --> 32:54.080
are are are performers they are paid to do it they are set up not to fail they have a probably even heard us say as this understanding don and so i wanted to pick up where we left off yesterday by just showing a few more minutes of this shit show as they admit with their

32:54.858 --> 32:56.579
with their shit-rolling beetle here.

32:57.819 --> 33:14.724
These people, of course, I've said many times, are masquerading as some kind of intellectual hero couple, when in reality, at best, to save their family any long-term suffering, we could say that they are scripted fools.

33:15.404 --> 33:23.067
They have been asked to talk about certain things at certain times and not ask questions, and they have chosen to do that.

33:23.287 --> 33:24.127
And here we are,

33:24.747 --> 33:43.331
five years later with the vast majority of young adults transfected at least twice because they effectively ruined any resistance to the narrative of a novel virus, maybe from a laboratory, possibly with odd laboratory adjustments or inserts.

33:44.131 --> 33:52.893
All of these narratives were perpetuated by these people and allowed the college kids to be fully bamboozled that something was happening.

33:53.573 --> 33:58.040
that something happened and that they had to take measures to protect their grandparents.

33:58.180 --> 34:07.454
These people, Naomi Wolf, all of CHD, they're all responsible for it because they all did not save people from it.

34:08.137 --> 34:17.382
They all believed in the asymptomatic transmission, the novel signal, the PCR testing, the overcycling, they all amplified the same bullshit script.

34:17.402 --> 34:25.227
And that's not by accident in the same way that it's not by accident that every government in the world was saying build back better on camera.

34:25.988 --> 34:36.334
It's just that the build back better on camera made you think that that was the script when in reality, the entire narrative on social media was scripted

34:37.225 --> 34:45.632
by a multinational security, national security organization, a military organization to try and get maximum compliance.

34:46.573 --> 34:53.359
It was another reiteration of a similar operation, but scaled up on a global scale.

34:53.859 --> 34:59.524
And it includes actors on social media, witting and unwitting, witting and unwitting actors.

35:01.914 --> 35:11.923
on that injecting a vaccine or a pseudo vaccine in this case into your arm was likely to be a pseudo vaccine.

35:11.963 --> 35:13.464
This is like four days ago.

35:13.584 --> 35:21.711
So this is the jackass that in 2021, I described very succinctly the problem and I'm going to do it again here.

35:22.292 --> 35:22.612
Okay.

35:24.254 --> 35:25.355
It's him in there.

35:26.315 --> 35:27.717
The problem is, is that

35:28.689 --> 35:35.059
There was an opportunity, and there still remains an opportunity to, wow.

35:35.519 --> 35:36.000
Kidda!

35:37.863 --> 35:38.804
I gotta close the door.

35:38.824 --> 35:40.988
I didn't think he was gonna do double-weighted balls.

35:58.976 --> 36:03.301
Honestly, I never thought I would say double-weighted balls on live streaming.

36:03.341 --> 36:05.984
But anyway, the door's closed now.

36:06.104 --> 36:08.387
So, what I wanted to do was point out that these

36:15.578 --> 36:25.660
This script cannot be explained any other way because I had explained to them why it was so important to say transfection.

36:25.700 --> 36:31.202
And the reason is very, very important for all of my viewers to understand.

36:31.282 --> 36:37.563
I don't know if I've said it enough times in all the repetition that I do, but I want to make it very clear.

36:38.303 --> 36:44.905
There are hundreds, more likely there are probably tens of thousands

36:45.871 --> 36:47.212
Listen to that number carefully.

36:47.312 --> 37:08.505
Tens of thousands of professional, academic, actively working professional biologists and biochemists that use one form of transformation or transfection, many perhaps, in their daily, weekly, monthly experiments.

37:10.106 --> 37:14.609
That means that there are potentially tens of thousands of academic,

37:15.575 --> 37:38.016
professionals that should have known that using lipid nanoparticles to transfect humans via intramuscular injection was one of the most absurd methodological concepts to ever be proposed as a

37:39.676 --> 37:43.837
Let's say, well, we have no choice but to just do it because this is such an emergency.

37:43.897 --> 38:00.721
There were tens of thousands and there remain tens of thousands of academic biologists that could listen to me talk and say what I'm saying and repeat it in their head and go, holy shit, he's right.

38:03.234 --> 38:04.354
It wouldn't take them very long.

38:04.554 --> 38:25.101
Almost every neuroscientist that works on an animal model is transfecting it in some way or another to put optogenetics in their head, to upregulate the expression of a protein, to make certain neurons glow in the dark so that they can look at them later, or even glow in the dark in real time so that they can image their calcium signals.

38:25.141 --> 38:27.762
And all of these experiments are terminal.

38:28.602 --> 38:29.542
They do damage.

38:30.042 --> 38:32.283
And they require transfection.

38:34.400 --> 38:43.310
And the only difference between those experiments and what was done with the mRNA is that they put it in the muscle.

38:44.611 --> 38:52.400
There is no magic Peter Cullis special formulation of lipid nanoparticle that's safe because that is a lie.

38:53.301 --> 38:54.922
But it's just one of the lies.

38:55.646 --> 38:58.967
because it was always transfection.

38:59.507 --> 39:02.908
It was always transformation with the adenovirus.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.829
And there is no joke here.

39:06.169 --> 39:14.411
These people could have helped me get this out to the entire community of academic biologists.

39:14.591 --> 39:23.154
And I still believe that the vast majority of them, if they heard it in the right way, would go, wow, I never thought about it like that.

39:24.938 --> 39:30.441
At the time, at the University of Pittsburgh, I couldn't get anyone to hear it, so maybe I'm wrong.

39:32.101 --> 39:46.868
But I'm telling you, this is the kink in the armor that had to be prevented and protected and paneled over with this performance, and specifically with Brett Weinstein, who was hooked up with me by Piper Stover.

39:49.790 --> 39:56.595
who no one cares about, who Kevin McCairn didn't care about, Kevin McKernan never bothered to care about.

39:56.635 --> 40:01.218
They all just kind of ignored the fact that I wrote a review with Piper Stover.

40:01.238 --> 40:09.084
I mean, the whole reason why I got connected with Brett Weinstein was because I wrote the review and he read it.

40:09.104 --> 40:14.288
I mean, it's crazy this, it's crazy what we're dealing with here.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.450
These people are imposters.

40:17.446 --> 40:33.679
imposters of the highest order because they haven't even become the cat herders that they are with the apparent social reach that they have by merit.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.261
They have been given it.

40:37.582 --> 40:45.708
They have had it programmed for them in the same way that YouTube is now just programmed against me, I guess, because I have not sufficient channel history.

40:49.591 --> 40:54.093
So let's listen to what these geniuses said after the, you know, it's the spike protein.

40:54.193 --> 40:55.174
I got a prediction.

40:55.234 --> 40:56.754
It's going to be the spike protein.

40:56.774 --> 41:05.058
They're going to blame it on the spike protein instead of all the things that I thought of myself about the, about the vaccines or these pseudo vaccines.

41:05.458 --> 41:08.920
This is a pseudo adult and his pseudo adult wife.

41:09.841 --> 41:22.710
be very low quality in terms of creating immunity to the disease because what you really want is immunity on your surface, on your mucosal surfaces where you contract the disease.

41:23.651 --> 41:31.676
But what I came to understand is that actually what they delivered was guaranteed not to work in the way that they claimed that it did work.

41:31.837 --> 41:34.218
It was guaranteed not to control the spread of the disease.

41:35.615 --> 41:43.727
because by injecting it into your arm rather than having you inhale it onto your mucosa or something along those lines,

41:44.790 --> 42:06.441
It can only prevent the virus from moving between your cells, which means... And so now understand very, very distinctly that what this is, is the exact immunology that I was teaching him in 2021, which I've now through further study and review, have refuted.

42:08.402 --> 42:23.814
Further inspection of the whole idea of what viruses are and aren't and how these signals are derived and how they are reproduced led me to understand that virology is largely just transfection and transformation in animal models and cell culture.

42:24.254 --> 42:31.000
And they pretend that these are self-replicating constructs, but they don't ever really able to show that.

42:32.125 --> 42:39.167
But what I do know and what I've learned very, very well is that they do have the ability to make large quantities of pure DNA.

42:40.188 --> 42:50.311
And they can take those pure DNA quantities and clean them up pretty well and then use a commercial enzyme to convert them to fairly reliable concentration of RNA.

42:50.391 --> 42:58.054
And that RNA would be sufficient to do a lot of the experiments that I understood I was doing as a neuroscientist.

42:59.411 --> 43:07.274
It would also be more than sufficient to accomplish what they claim to have accomplished, which is produce this transfection for billions of people.

43:08.355 --> 43:15.078
The trouble is, had they done that and done it faithfully, then a lot more people would be noticeably ill, sick, or dead.

43:16.138 --> 43:25.042
And so the only explanation for that is that they, of course, met this ridiculous manufacturing quota and provided it so quickly because, of course, it's easy.

43:25.582 --> 43:26.643
They use placebo.

43:27.892 --> 43:50.486
But what Brett Weinstein is going to do here is say nothing about anything to do with the novel virus, the sequencing of it, the PCR used to detect it, nor is he going to question anything to do with its existence, the functionality of these other drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine on solving the novel virus.

43:51.306 --> 43:55.429
But he's also not going to question the idea that there are lots of other respiratory viruses.

43:57.415 --> 43:59.517
including other gain-of-function viruses.

44:01.138 --> 44:05.741
Listen carefully, because this is scripted bullshit.

44:05.761 --> 44:09.004
It's after you've already got an infection.

44:09.944 --> 44:14.187
Now, on the one hand, you could say, oh, my God, how did they miss that?

44:14.227 --> 44:17.270
Do they really understand immunology this poorly?

44:18.330 --> 44:19.311
And the answer is no.

44:20.352 --> 44:21.733
This is a feature, not a bug.

44:22.373 --> 44:23.394
So this is your consideration?

44:26.308 --> 44:39.557
putting together what I now understand, having come to learn about mucosal surfaces having separate immunity, the fact that an injection is not in a position to prevent contraction of a respiratory virus, and every time they tell you.

44:39.838 --> 44:44.261
I mean, is he going to have Joe Leon to tell us that the antibodies can't cross the

44:44.901 --> 44:51.966
the lung-blood barrier, and so since they can't cross the lung-blood barrier and reach the mucus, then it's stupid to have antibodies in your blood.

44:52.406 --> 44:59.070
Is he actually gonna have Joe Leon really soon to talk about the linkage theory and how that explains everything?

45:00.431 --> 45:02.953
Maybe he'll have Marc Giraudoux on first.

45:03.794 --> 45:04.154
Who knows?

45:05.083 --> 45:06.245
Oh, there's a respiratory virus.

45:06.285 --> 45:07.086
Get this injection.

45:07.126 --> 45:07.767
You should ask them.

45:07.867 --> 45:15.738
Why would you be delivering me the antigen or whatever else in this form if my mucosa is where I'm supposed to become immune?

45:15.798 --> 45:17.741
Show me that that can even work because it can't.

45:19.183 --> 45:20.144
So the point is,

45:21.118 --> 45:26.520
He can't keep it straight in his head without looking down at his notebook all the time, because these thoughts aren't even his own.

45:26.660 --> 45:32.623
You know, he might have scribbled it down after somebody was on the phone with him, but this is such a level of bullshittery.

45:33.263 --> 45:34.024
It's remarkable.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.105
He hasn't even mastered this shit yet.

45:38.306 --> 45:45.349
People who are longtime listeners of Dark Horse will remember that we had multiple discussions on what I called the game of Pharma.

45:46.121 --> 46:00.291
that we learned during COVID, that there were certain moves that were happening, but there are moves that pharma has been developing for decades, where how often does pharma have a... So in this narrative, it's pharma.

46:00.531 --> 46:04.334
In Sasha Lantupova's narrative, it's the DOD that wants to kill us.

46:04.454 --> 46:10.318
In this one, it's pharma that wants to make us as sick as possible to make as much money off of us as possible.

46:11.039 --> 46:14.822
Can you hear the kind of, you know, dumb, simple,

46:16.238 --> 46:43.870
explanation that this is like how little progress he's actually made in understanding what's going on here if he if he still doesn't understand that pharmaceutical companies really like they make a fraction a tiny it's an order of magnitude even two orders of magnitude less than the most powerful companies in the world and you're worried about pharma and that pharma is orchestrating all of this stuff i mean this is a full-blown

46:47.225 --> 46:47.645
Wow.

46:47.745 --> 46:48.686
I mean, what a joke.

46:49.607 --> 46:54.570
A patent on some molecule that has some plausible benefit.

46:54.590 --> 46:55.170
Okay.

46:55.370 --> 46:55.930
Oh, great.

46:56.031 --> 46:56.751
You've got a drug.

46:56.991 --> 46:57.311
Cool.

46:58.392 --> 46:58.752
What now?

46:59.233 --> 47:01.214
Well, let's look at the competing drugs.

47:01.254 --> 47:06.597
We're going to have to make it seem like those competing drugs are less effective than our drugs.

47:06.617 --> 47:08.758
We have to make our drug look more effective than it is.

47:08.979 --> 47:10.680
Those drugs look less effective than they are.

47:12.819 --> 47:19.564
He's actually telling a story about drugs here, but what he's really saying is how a vaccine could come to market.

47:20.444 --> 47:23.146
Drugs don't have to show they're better than other drugs.

47:23.206 --> 47:24.987
They just have to get approved for safety.

47:26.328 --> 47:27.849
And they say that they do what they do.

47:27.870 --> 47:29.651
They don't have to be better than something else.

47:31.510 --> 47:34.513
I mean, that is absolutely preposterous.

47:34.553 --> 47:38.877
The only thing that is held to that standard is a vaccine.

47:38.897 --> 47:46.425
And then, of course, it's held to that standard from the perspective of antibodies or some measurable immune, what do they call it?

47:46.545 --> 47:52.090
Immune surrogate immunity, you know, some surrogate marker of immunity.

47:53.792 --> 48:04.526
This is really an interesting and remarkable script that he's on, and I think he's actually not sophisticated enough to understand that this is just wrong.

48:04.667 --> 48:05.348
It's just dumb.

48:06.810 --> 48:08.892
And we need to see his reading.

48:09.452 --> 48:12.515
Look at him make our drug look safer than it is.

48:12.575 --> 48:15.398
We need to make those drugs look dangerous than they are.

48:15.418 --> 48:19.081
So there's just sort of a sort of set of moves that you have to be able to accomplish.

48:19.141 --> 48:21.823
And pharma has mechanisms for doing each of these.

48:21.943 --> 48:28.188
So, for example, how do you how do you make your drug look safe?

48:28.809 --> 48:31.651
Well, here's one way you don't do the test yourself.

48:32.852 --> 48:34.474
that seems like that would remove control.

48:34.754 --> 48:36.616
Well, no, what it does is it removes your fingerprints.

48:37.236 --> 48:41.941
You've got a group of companies that will run your safety test for you.

48:41.961 --> 48:54.552
So here they're going to tell us now that what the Pfizer's safety trials went weak because it was farmed out to a different firm and so that's not fair or that's how it happened?

48:55.473 --> 48:57.154
Is that really where he's going to go with this?

48:58.083 --> 49:03.745
It's not that dissimilar to what Brian Hooker was saying in 2020 about, you know, they're not doing enough trials.

49:03.765 --> 49:04.965
They're not doing enough people.

49:05.045 --> 49:06.065
It's under tested.

49:06.125 --> 49:07.726
Isn't that what they're saying right now?

49:07.806 --> 49:10.647
That the mRNAs just weren't tested well enough.

49:10.707 --> 49:11.807
We just don't know enough.

49:11.847 --> 49:13.068
We just need more data.

49:15.148 --> 49:21.210
Holy cow, I gotta just roll this back just a little bit because I think I had something in my head and I lost it for a second.

49:21.230 --> 49:21.690
I wanna find it.

49:21.710 --> 49:22.590
Right, contractors.

49:23.431 --> 49:23.931
Here's one way.

49:25.014 --> 49:26.015
You don't do the test yourself.

49:26.495 --> 49:26.976
Oh, yeah.

49:27.196 --> 49:28.797
That seems like that would remove control.

49:29.097 --> 49:49.034
So it's interesting that Sasha Latupova, this what I would I would probably characterize as an abusive mom for her allowing the use of her daughter while she was underage to make her into some kind of Internet phenomenon or allow her to become one that would eventually be

49:49.654 --> 50:15.991
Promoted on Alex Jones in 2019 There are some really awful gross videos that she made when she was underage apparently with the permission of and even funding or or assistance from the mom and some Monetarily way because she has a narrator and an editor and it would take me weeks to make the kinds of videos that she was making when she was in high school and so it's really diabolical that someone as

50:17.632 --> 50:32.489
as certifiably nasty as Sasha Latapova would be promoted by the Epoch Times and CHD with multiple interviews on CHD with Polly and Meryl, as well as on the Defender podcast twice with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:32.529 --> 50:32.989
himself.

50:34.891 --> 50:45.600
wittingly or unwittingly promoting the mom of somebody who's clearly some kind of agent who, by her own daughter's admission, voted for Clinton.

50:45.660 --> 50:54.827
And the interesting thing about her is the reason why she's a retired pharma executive is because she sold a company to Pfizer, not that dissimilar to Mike Eden, actually.

50:55.988 --> 50:59.030
The reason why he was retired is because Pfizer bought his company.

51:00.591 --> 51:01.212
I mean, it's a...

51:02.315 --> 51:04.296
Maybe I'm wrong about Mike Eden, I don't even care.

51:04.736 --> 51:26.930
The point is, is that Sasha Latupova is this absolute huge kink in their armor because she's a Ukrainian who funded a company that developed a way to screen people for a cardiac signal that would make trials, make clinical trials more successful for pharmaceutical companies.

51:27.010 --> 51:31.453
And she sold that technology that she developed with taxpayer money

51:32.549 --> 51:41.074
on taxpayer dime using public data from the University of Rochester with funding she got from Democrats.

51:44.249 --> 51:45.290
and sold it to Pfizer.

51:45.330 --> 51:47.611
That's exactly what they're describing right here.

51:47.651 --> 51:51.454
The despicable nature of how pharmaceutical companies work.

51:51.494 --> 51:52.554
Give me a fricking break.

51:52.594 --> 51:53.995
They're all one show.

51:54.356 --> 51:59.259
They're all one little on line only.

51:59.879 --> 52:06.563
Substack, Rumble, Locals, and X. That's where these people exist.

52:07.484 --> 52:13.248
The moment you stop paying attention to those places as relevant, especially X,

52:14.329 --> 52:15.471
Just get off of it.

52:16.312 --> 52:19.036
The only reason why I go there is to subvert it.

52:19.177 --> 52:29.533
And at some point in time, no one's gonna be able to, maybe it's already now that no one can see me and I shouldn't waste another minute on that stupid platform, but you definitely shouldn't.

52:32.025 --> 52:33.906
Well, no, what it does is it removes your fingerprints.

52:34.526 --> 52:39.929
You've got a group of companies that will run your safety test for you, right?

52:39.989 --> 52:40.609
Contractors.

52:41.530 --> 52:51.594
And they know that in order to survive in their business, which is doing experiments on behalf of some large pharma corporation, the pharma corporation has to get the answer that it wants.

52:51.955 --> 52:56.677
So they're in competition with each other to figure out ways to deliver the answer that pharma wants.

52:57.217 --> 53:03.663
So, any company that doesn't, any company that does the test straight and comes back with evidence that the drug is dangerous, they're not getting hired again.

53:03.963 --> 53:09.488
So, you can expect an entire little industry that always spits out the result that pharma pays for, right?

53:10.849 --> 53:11.089
Okay.

53:11.409 --> 53:16.514
So, giving a shot in the arm to prevent a respiratory virus.

53:17.575 --> 53:21.018
Well, guaranteed to fail, which means

53:22.267 --> 53:27.809
there will be no control of the spread of the virus that causes people to want the shot that reduces the severity.

53:28.649 --> 53:29.970
Virus, virus, virus.

53:30.010 --> 53:31.070
The virus exists.

53:31.270 --> 53:32.550
Transmission exists.

53:32.771 --> 53:33.831
Viruses exist.

53:34.171 --> 53:35.471
RNA can pandemic.

53:35.572 --> 53:36.912
It killed millions of people.

53:36.972 --> 53:39.593
We should wear woodshop goggles and bandanas.

53:41.413 --> 53:46.275
Seriously, this is a monster and it is a monster on a script.

53:46.395 --> 53:48.656
And if he's not a monster, he's a moron.

53:51.431 --> 53:51.591
Right?

53:51.771 --> 53:52.812
That's the simple fact.

53:53.092 --> 54:00.316
If they're selling a product, which when you and I talked a bit about this earlier this week, you correctly said not a vaccine.

54:00.476 --> 54:01.697
It's a treatment, right?

54:01.717 --> 54:03.158
It's a treatment that you take in advance.

54:03.218 --> 54:04.599
It's not a vaccine.

54:04.719 --> 54:05.919
It's a transfection.

54:05.979 --> 54:17.306
Heather, you agreed with me in 2022, a year after I taught you this on signal, you treacherous coward.

54:19.226 --> 54:21.667
a phylactic treatment, but it's a treatment, right?

54:21.707 --> 54:25.189
What you're doing is you're just reducing, you know, your symptoms of the disease.

54:25.209 --> 54:28.630
You're not reducing the fact that he is saying that it works.

54:30.991 --> 54:34.073
He is actually saying that it works.

54:34.213 --> 54:35.273
Please see this.

54:36.814 --> 54:42.297
You had an infection or that you will pass it on to somebody else, which is exactly what pharma would want.

54:43.437 --> 54:47.299
So anyway, I thought that was, you know, it's,

54:48.039 --> 54:53.078
But symptom reduction doesn't tend to be behind a prescription wall.

54:54.833 --> 54:59.496
Well, and we tend to have that just available on the shelves and there's a lot of competition.

55:00.577 --> 55:07.020
And if if only your doctor can tell you, OK, you can you can get this, get this now.

55:07.040 --> 55:12.704
And, you know, of course, everything they were widely and forcibly available, these these covid shots.

55:12.784 --> 55:17.307
But many people are much more likely to say, yes, that's for me.

55:18.528 --> 55:27.195
if it comes with the imprimatur of a doctor as opposed to, well, I was at Rite Aid and I chose this thing among seven possible treatments because I just feel awful and I wanted to feel better.

55:27.972 --> 55:28.212
Right.

55:28.892 --> 55:35.276
It also isn't going to be... It's very hard to make the argument for a mandate, right?

55:35.296 --> 55:37.517
You have to reach... For treatment, yes.

55:37.557 --> 55:37.777
Right.

55:37.857 --> 55:38.377
For treatment.

55:38.557 --> 55:41.399
What's more, what other battle did we end up fighting?

55:41.819 --> 55:49.963
Well, we fought a battle over ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which were both very effective at reducing the severity of disease.

55:50.083 --> 55:53.665
Now, ivermectin, at least, and probably hydroxychloroquine as well,

55:54.265 --> 56:00.712
have utility in preventing infection also, but imagine that you actually allowed the marketplace to work.

56:01.892 --> 56:09.955
And you had some people who had a newfangled shot based on an unproven technology that could only ever reduce symptoms.

56:10.355 --> 56:14.457
And then you had some tried and true drugs that had a great safety profile.

56:14.857 --> 56:18.319
Can you imagine that this is really May 30?

56:19.079 --> 56:22.260
We are at the end of May, almost the beginning of June 2025.

56:24.929 --> 56:33.031
five years after Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch would come on his podcast and almost say the same bullshit.

56:35.612 --> 56:40.593
If he doesn't say we have to mandate ivermectin here, that would be the only thing he would leave out, right?

56:40.673 --> 56:42.174
But he's probably going to say that too.

56:42.907 --> 56:58.640
that um you know that actually resulted in people who got sick not getting very sick or other people avoiding the disease altogether if you were going to mandate something you'd mandate ivermectin anyway i told you holy shit

57:00.535 --> 57:08.339
I guess I'm just coming to realize the elaborate nature of the racket.

57:09.120 --> 57:24.949
And I also was prone to, or I was led to revisit a conversation that you and I have talked about before between a former member of parliament, this was back when he was a member of parliament, Rob Ruse,

57:26.210 --> 57:30.193
who had a famous interaction with a Pfizer exec.

57:30.373 --> 57:31.755
Can you play that one for us, Jan?

57:32.195 --> 57:41.884
Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?

57:43.625 --> 57:45.967
If not, please say it clearly.

57:46.288 --> 57:49.991
If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?

57:50.876 --> 57:53.658
And I really want straight answer, yes or no.

57:53.978 --> 57:55.039
And I'm looking forward to it.

57:55.179 --> 57:55.379
Thank you.

57:55.619 --> 57:56.420
That's a Dutch guy.

57:56.440 --> 57:57.761
Thank you very much.

57:58.421 --> 57:59.162
Maybe Belgium.

58:00.182 --> 58:06.006
Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it's entered the market?

58:06.347 --> 58:09.769
She said stopping immunization before it entered the market.

58:09.789 --> 58:11.590
So I don't really know what this, this is weird.

58:12.251 --> 58:12.471
No.

58:13.471 --> 58:20.116
These, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.

58:20.695 --> 58:24.837
And from that point of view, we had to do everything at risk.

58:26.977 --> 58:31.619
So she's a bit unclear there and quite tone deaf.

58:31.919 --> 58:35.260
But what she says is, no, they didn't know whether or not it blocked transmission.

58:35.640 --> 58:38.481
In fact, they hadn't even looked because they were moving at the speed of science.

58:39.322 --> 58:42.963
When the real translation and response and specifically responsive to the market.

58:44.163 --> 58:46.044
I remember this.

58:46.104 --> 58:47.585
We talked about it at the time, I believe.

58:47.905 --> 58:50.126
The speed of science bit is extraordinary.

58:50.166 --> 58:53.027
That's akin to follow the science.

58:53.067 --> 59:00.150
Like, okay, you just revealed that you're using science as a political battering ram rather than as an actual tool of human understanding.

59:00.210 --> 59:04.632
But they're also prioritizing the market over the actual science.

59:04.972 --> 59:05.192
Right.

59:05.252 --> 59:06.673
In fact, the market is all there is.

59:07.053 --> 59:11.015
And if you think about what she says, oh no, we didn't even test it.

59:11.635 --> 59:13.736
Because think about it from their perspective.

59:15.197 --> 59:18.719
This is the central narrative that I was hitting at before.

59:18.959 --> 59:21.440
And I just want to make sure that I keep hitting at it here.

59:22.061 --> 59:26.343
The idea that this needed testing, that's wrong.

59:27.964 --> 59:30.265
The idea that, wow, we didn't test it enough.

59:31.670 --> 59:32.771
That's also wrong.

59:33.011 --> 59:44.418
And the reason why, and there are tens of thousands of academic biologists around the Western world, and some probably in China too, if they can understand English, that should have known better.

59:45.370 --> 01:00:03.065
Because once they heard that they were using a proprietary lipid nanoparticle to transfect people to a spike protein or any protein, all the alarm bells in your general biology head should have gone off and you should have said, well, how in the hell is that going to work?

01:00:05.737 --> 01:00:14.599
And there are a million questions that you should have had based on your experiences with the limitations of it on your own experimental bench.

01:00:15.159 --> 01:00:26.242
But unfortunately, these two jackasses are not people who can do that because they didn't do research that used transfection or transformation.

01:00:26.262 --> 01:00:28.043
They barely did any research at all.

01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:32.464
They did, you know, they did ecology trips.

01:00:33.908 --> 01:00:35.250
and specimen collection.

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:48.467
It's a different kind of research than the kind of research where you're looking at the role of a molecule in a metabolic pathway, or you're trying to look at the role of a protein in the function of a cell.

01:00:48.948 --> 01:01:00.594
These are very different questions that are on a different level of analysis, and a different level of methodological tool set, and a different level of understanding of the biological complexities that we face.

01:01:00.994 --> 01:01:13.641
And so these clowns, while they pretend to be, you know, the only systems people, or complex systems are different than complicated systems, or some other bullshit that they say, they have no concept

01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:41.927
of where this rubber meets the road with regard to molecular biology and genetics and biology and the whole idea of what I'm trying to transmit which is that we are a pattern integrity that involves a complex levels of symbiosis that cannot be distilled down to we all have a molecular ancestor and therefore everybody is just molecules in chemistry which is what this book insists is true.

01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:51.101
We just haven't figured out the rules of how physics and chemistry work out into the homecoming queen loving the homecoming king.

01:01:56.805 --> 01:02:12.997
I may spend a significant amount of the remaining of my life trying to bring to the attention of the rest of the world the extent to which this guy is a charlatan.

01:02:14.096 --> 01:02:16.138
and deserves a punch in the mouth.

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:22.123
It deserves rotten fruit thrown at him anytime he goes in public.

01:02:23.264 --> 01:02:29.329
He should be the victim of jeers and boos when he goes in public.

01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:32.291
That's the kind of fake fraud.

01:02:33.812 --> 01:02:38.776
This is the worst kind of intellectual pseudo-adult.

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.859
And one of the worst examples on the internet.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.588
He should be ashamed of himself.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:49.991
His whole family should be ashamed of what he is and basically what he's made of his marriage.

01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:52.072
This is a farce.

01:02:52.993 --> 01:02:54.173
Well, A, it's not going to work.

01:02:54.393 --> 01:02:55.454
So what's the test going to be?

01:02:55.514 --> 01:03:01.557
If they do a test that investigates whether or not it blocks transmission, what they're going to find out is that it doesn't.

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:08.041
And if that's what they find out, that erodes their argument or governmental mandates.

01:03:09.016 --> 01:03:10.298
So they would much rather not.

01:03:10.418 --> 01:03:11.800
So it's governmental mandates.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.143
It's testing whether or not it's transmission or not.

01:03:14.183 --> 01:03:20.792
We are talking about the exact same bullshit that these people convinced us to talk about in 2020.

01:03:21.733 --> 01:03:24.337
And once you see it, you should be very angry.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:40.853
Once you see it, you should be very apologetic to your kids because if you ever believed in this guy or that woman or children's health defense list of heroes, and now it's this visible and you're not going to do something pretty amazing.

01:03:41.294 --> 01:03:43.936
You're not going to turn around your social media accounts.

01:03:43.956 --> 01:03:52.024
You're not going to start calling these people out or sending them emails or start to, you know, really show people that you know what's going on.

01:03:54.844 --> 01:03:56.085
Because that's the way you do it.

01:03:56.906 --> 01:03:59.568
It's not as simple as Trump good or Trump bad.

01:03:59.648 --> 01:04:02.791
It's not as simple as RFK good or RFK bad.

01:04:03.332 --> 01:04:17.425
It's about understanding that a much of modern American history is bent around a mythology that hides the fact that they are trying and preparing to invert our children from sovereign individuals into experimental animals.

01:04:19.764 --> 01:04:26.229
know the answer to that question when privately, I'm betting they did know the answer to that question because they designed a shot that couldn't possibly work.

01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:27.109
Why did they do that?

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:31.232
They designed a shot that couldn't possibly work because it's great for business.

01:04:31.813 --> 01:04:34.255
So it's all about the Benjamins, he says.

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:36.216
It's all about the Benjamins.

01:04:36.356 --> 01:04:37.197
What a joke.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:53.424
So no question about the PCR, no question about establishing PCR as an entire set of medical diagnostics that's never gonna come under the scrutiny of the FDA, which probably should evaluate every one of them as an individual medical device.

01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:04.947
That sound refers to the fact that that means that everybody in the United States is basically losing the FDA's

01:05:07.327 --> 01:05:23.637
supervision over an entire body of medical diagnostics, all of which provide income, and more importantly, provide an endless remnant stream that is primarily composed of DNA of the person that got tested.

01:05:25.978 --> 01:05:35.864
It's exactly what the Human Genome Project would need once the sequencing technology had become sufficiently cheap and high enough resolution

01:05:37.054 --> 01:05:56.286
And number two, once they had the data infrastructure to store that data in a common data set, common data format, then they could proceed with telling everybody that you need to test and proceed with this using an emergency to establish a gold standard that has never been established.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:06:03.031
The gold standard of identifying a virus remains PCR tests, which are all proprietary bullshit.

01:06:04.423 --> 01:06:15.519
And these people are not going to say anything about it because his dad, his part of the original conception and removing of the teeth of whatever the FDA would have been had Estes Kefauver had his way.

01:06:18.427 --> 01:06:22.210
His brother is an IP advisor to Peter Thiel.

01:06:22.731 --> 01:06:35.763
They are in cooperation with IP experts Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, and Goldman Sachs operatives Steve Bannon and Aaron Seery.

01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:39.847
It's all one malevolent show designed to take down the FDA

01:06:40.607 --> 01:06:48.409
or to neuter it in a way where effectively the diagnostic standard of PCR would be established without anybody realizing it.

01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:55.971
Now we're even tracking measles with PCR and nobody gives a shit, especially the FDA run by Marty Makary.

01:06:57.412 --> 01:07:01.913
Especially the FDA run by with Vinay Prasad.

01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:09.033
And, you know, many of us have intuited this on other topics.

01:07:09.673 --> 01:07:12.334
Do these people really want to cure diseases?

01:07:12.914 --> 01:07:15.995
Well, that reduces the market for their products.

01:07:16.396 --> 01:07:22.878
So it seems fairly clear that evolution itself is going to shape an industry.

01:07:22.918 --> 01:07:30.000
Here he is again, trying to portray it as an evolutionary process, which means it's basically out of our control.

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.041
How can we stop it?

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.424
How could we ever stop it if it's just a natural phenomenon?

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:38.747
It looks like evolution is just going to work.

01:07:38.807 --> 01:07:41.950
It's almost like the market is just a natural phenomenon, right?

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.433
An evolutionary thing that you can't control.

01:07:45.484 --> 01:07:59.488
that fails to cure diseases and comes up with a, you know, proliferating arsenal of treatments that plausibly work at arbitrary risk to your health, right?

01:07:59.528 --> 01:08:03.990
In fact, especially since we have a relatively small number of these pharma giants,

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:11.871
If they cause health problems, then chances are that the drug your doctor gives you for the side effect is going to be from one of them, too.

01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:15.552
So, you know, it's a racket from one end to the other.

01:08:15.752 --> 01:08:33.455
This is a this is the most it would be funny to contrast this discussion right here with the discussion that Joe Rogan and Alex Alex Berenson had about pharma, because they Joe Rogan and Alex Berenson agreed that

01:08:33.615 --> 01:08:36.477
Pharma has done so much good stuff.

01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:39.239
They've cured so many diseases.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.101
They make so many good drugs.

01:08:42.221 --> 01:08:45.343
I mean, they have done so much good for us.

01:08:46.463 --> 01:08:48.044
It's a remarkable little clip.

01:08:48.305 --> 01:08:49.946
Organized of organized crimes.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:09:13.389
and uh anyway it's painful to be trying to understand the way this works as a biologist or presumably as a doctor right because you so hard realize you have to translate what they're saying oh it's so hard give us a you know a needle borne uh inoculant a needle borne inoculant

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.343
Wow, I mean that's...

01:09:25.865 --> 01:09:26.906
for a respiratory disease.

01:09:26.966 --> 01:09:30.329
It's not like inhaled vaccines don't exist.

01:09:30.889 --> 01:09:32.070
They do, right?

01:09:32.471 --> 01:09:36.915
And it's not as if there aren't things for which you would vaccinate with a needle, you know?

01:09:37.355 --> 01:09:37.755
Rabies.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:42.539
Rabies gets introduced into your tissue by an animal that bites you.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.942
So you don't want the immunity on your mucosal surface.

01:09:46.123 --> 01:09:47.944
You want the immunity in your tissues.

01:09:48.465 --> 01:09:53.329
So there's all kinds of arguments for different modes, but why would they have chosen the wrong mode?

01:09:54.142 --> 01:09:55.183
That's the thing.

01:09:55.243 --> 01:09:59.546
They chose the wrong mode because, well, the purpose of a system is what it does.

01:09:59.606 --> 01:10:02.808
And the purpose of pharma is to sell pharmaceuticals.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:13.176
And pharmaceuticals get sold when you have a plausible argument for governmental mandates and recommendations, not when you're actually effective.

01:10:13.236 --> 01:10:16.918
In fact, if you were actually effective at doing what vaccines are supposed to do,

01:10:17.739 --> 01:10:20.761
then you'd put yourself out of that part of the market.

01:10:21.322 --> 01:10:22.863
There's your own market.

01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:29.887
And of course, they weren't going to do that because they're not on our team.

01:10:31.008 --> 01:10:31.448
No, they weren't.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:34.250
They're not on our team, he says.

01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:37.993
What an interesting choice of words for this jackass.

01:10:39.605 --> 01:10:41.246
Well, you prompted me to think a number of things there.

01:10:42.527 --> 01:10:59.135
One is we deserve, at the very least, a taxonomy of what would be the right mode of delivery for an actually safe and effective vaccine for all of the lists of diseases for which we are hoping to have a safe and effective vaccine.

01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:06.019
And I think anything that's vectored by a biting insect, probably an injection in the arm is the right thing.

01:11:06.299 --> 01:11:11.002
So we don't have, as far as I know, a dengue vaccine, or malaria vaccine, but yellow fever.

01:11:11.022 --> 01:11:14.183
That, you know, a shot in the arm.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:26.451
A shot in the arm is still, my friend Heather Haying, so aspecific and so dumb, shows how little understanding she still has.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.944
Because there are subcutaneous injections.

01:11:31.005 --> 01:11:33.548
You could even imagine a cutaneous injection.

01:11:33.788 --> 01:11:38.194
And yes, you can imagine an intramuscular injection.

01:11:38.234 --> 01:11:42.519
And all of those, curiously enough, qualify as a shot in the arm.

01:11:43.321 --> 01:11:44.041
You dumb ass.

01:11:45.325 --> 01:12:04.262
I mean, this is so remarkable to think that their rhetoric, that their specific use of terms, their ability to explain things clearly, their vocabulary choice has not gotten better, hasn't gotten more consistent, hasn't gotten closer to accurate.

01:12:04.382 --> 01:12:09.447
Instead, it's gotten worse and worse and dumber and dumber.

01:12:10.765 --> 01:12:13.008
I mean, they are running out of script.

01:12:13.308 --> 01:12:16.392
Something is going wrong here because this is awful.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:22.540
I mean, if they were to play this back and listen to themselves, they can't think, you know, let's high five.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.042
That was a great episode.

01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:24.803
I mean,

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:34.148
if it were safe and effective, put that aside for the moment, would be the right mechanism of delivery.

01:12:34.169 --> 01:12:41.574
But anything respiratory, flu, any coronaviruses, COVID-19, is not.

01:12:42.415 --> 01:12:43.155
Simply is not.

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:55.004
And then another thing, and I did not plan to talk about this today, and I'm not going to read any of it, but speaking of ivermectin, ivermectin came up for me in a totally different context this week.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.195
I'm not even going to let that go.

01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:02.198
But speaking of Ivermectin, holy cow, what a bunch of dorks.

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:14.988
Ladies and gentlemen, I think there's a better explanation for why governments behave the way they do and why leaders say the things that they say into the camera.

01:13:15.088 --> 01:13:22.894
And that is because we are at a pivotal moment in the history of humankind, of people on Earth.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:36.862
And it is most aptly understood if you can start to think in terms of population pyramids and the consequences of a healthy versus unhealthy population pyramid.

01:13:37.984 --> 01:13:40.325
We may even need to do a whole program about that.

01:13:40.926 --> 01:13:57.755
But first find on my website under the link stuff, which is at the top of the page and also at the bottom of every page, where you can download this PDF from McKinsey Global Institute about the population pyramids around the world and why they present such a problem.

01:13:57.855 --> 01:14:01.377
Why would they need to murder all these old people in Scotland?

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.377
Why would they do that?

01:14:02.457 --> 01:14:04.658
Why would they need to murder old people in America?

01:14:04.698 --> 01:14:05.519
Why would they do that?

01:14:06.039 --> 01:14:26.371
And the reason is very, very clear if you see the population data from the 90s, and then as the time moves forward, because what you will see is an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was clearly visible in the population pyramid on both sides after World War II, because this is when they had big families.

01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:31.774
And then they spent decades discouraging us from having children.

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:42.459
They spent decades telling us that there was a problem about, you know, we're gonna run out of resources and we're gonna eat the planet and we're gonna burn it up.

01:14:43.299 --> 01:14:50.422
And so they spent decades, decades messaging against that.

01:14:50.482 --> 01:14:58.125
Now, what you see here, of course, is although there is a population here, it's not as bad as it could be.

01:14:58.165 --> 01:14:59.005
It could be like this.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:09.812
but it's gonna get there as we move up this pyramid, or sorry, as we get it playing again, you're gonna see that this bar doesn't move out too much.

01:15:12.233 --> 01:15:13.393
Stays right about there.

01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:17.795
And so our population, ooh, now it's going down.

01:15:18.256 --> 01:15:18.556
See it?

01:15:19.156 --> 01:15:20.076
See it's going down.

01:15:20.236 --> 01:15:21.037
Oh, that's not good.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:21.997
That's not good.

01:15:22.057 --> 01:15:29.541
That right there is already, we are already in 2000, I think 15 below replacement population growth.

01:15:30.529 --> 01:15:40.814
And so knowing that, it makes more sense than why they would be bringing immigrants in, because the economy is gonna require that they have a replacement population.

01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:44.076
Otherwise, the beehive won't have bees in all parts of it.

01:15:45.196 --> 01:15:45.916
That's all you need.

01:15:45.956 --> 01:15:48.318
That's the only analogy you need to have in it.

01:15:48.398 --> 01:15:55.081
And think if you have this giant beehive that's the size of your backyard, and then you take half the bees out of it, well, what's gonna happen?

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:58.374
There's not going to be honey in all the cells anymore.

01:15:58.414 --> 01:16:01.516
There's not going to be little pupae in all the cells anymore.

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.398
And half of the beehive will go to waste.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.725
And that's not that dissimilar to what will happen in China to all those giant cities that they built for nothing.

01:16:13.186 --> 01:16:19.731
All those buildings that they have right now that might be full, aren't going to be full forever because they don't have the kids to replace those.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:28.306
And a very similar phenomenon is happening in Russia, that's happening in Canada, that's happening all around in Europe.

01:16:28.386 --> 01:16:42.037
And so immigration is part of the solution to that problem on their paperwork, but it's actually a terrible alternative because what that does, of course, is ruins the fabric of society from a cultural perspective, but they knew that too.

01:16:43.318 --> 01:16:48.222
That was all part of this global plan that I was talking about in the woods as well.

01:16:49.699 --> 01:16:52.145
What is very difficult is to attribute.

01:16:53.311 --> 01:17:21.314
a name to the people that are doing this because of course the whole idea is to hide behind all of these front groups so that you think oh it's the Zionists or oh it's the it's the uh i don't know the the globalists or whatever they call them the the satanists or the luciferian people or the illuminati or they have all these different faces that they put on this but it just has to be a bunch of of ruthless rich people who understand how to think in that time frame

01:17:21.974 --> 01:17:31.103
understand how to think in terms of, well, who's going to be here in 100 years and have privy to that data so that they can sit people down at a table and say, look,

01:17:31.877 --> 01:17:40.919
We need to cooperate with India and make an alliance with India because they're going to be the dominant global population, maybe the global consumer population.

01:17:40.939 --> 01:17:45.180
We're going to want to ship stuff to them in 20 or 40 years.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.881
We're going to be asking for them to come to our country to work.

01:17:49.961 --> 01:17:52.621
And so we want to have a good relationship with them.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:18:00.063
And we don't need China anymore because in 50 years, China is not going to be able to do all the manufacturing that they're doing now.

01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:02.625
and their system is going to fall apart.

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:19.482
So, you know, this whole idea that nobody sees this coming, nobody thought about this, this is the lie that social media is perpetuating because there was a huge biological signal coming and all they had to do was lie to us about it.

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:22.826
And the way that they lied to us about it was put performers on social media.

01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:28.714
And not just one, not just many, but groups of them with a coordinated script.

01:18:29.295 --> 01:18:31.975
And sometimes multiple groups coordinated together.

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:41.138
Sometimes, you know, accounts from other countries appear on the internet to resemble some kind of illusion of consensus which spans countries' borders.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:42.539
But that's just an illusion.

01:18:44.622 --> 01:18:51.124
that's created on social media because you think social media is some kind of global representation of reality when it's not.

01:18:51.884 --> 01:18:58.045
It's a military program designed to control the thoughts that you think as long as you're on the platform.

01:18:59.326 --> 01:19:07.688
And that is how they were able to take this list of ways that they murdered people and obfuscated the population pyramid biology and

01:19:09.389 --> 01:19:18.135
created the illusion of a pandemic, which all of these people believe in still, including woodshop goggles bandana man, Brett Weinstein.

01:19:19.008 --> 01:19:22.830
That is a presentation from this week.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:27.832
And so, I do think that Grace's dad is making progress.

01:19:27.912 --> 01:19:33.774
I do think that he's gonna maybe win some decision about the fact that the protocols were murdered.

01:19:33.834 --> 01:19:37.476
Will we go back and review how many people are murdered?

01:19:37.516 --> 01:19:39.877
Will it be a giant class action lawsuit?

01:19:40.157 --> 01:19:40.837
I doubt it.

01:19:42.118 --> 01:19:42.678
I doubt it.

01:19:42.758 --> 01:19:43.398
I think this is...

01:19:44.699 --> 01:20:00.034
Worst case scenario, it's much worse than that, that this is going to fail, that it's being sabotaged by people like Mendenhall, who I've had a conversation with before, and I'm not really convinced that he's a total good guy, but maybe he's just one of these dudes who doesn't get it.

01:20:00.094 --> 01:20:01.796
Maybe he doesn't know what strict scrutiny is.

01:20:03.497 --> 01:20:12.019
Anyway, I think if you're going to watch anybody else on the internet, you should try to watch Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS, Housatonic Live.

01:20:12.979 --> 01:20:15.360
I think his archive on the internet is bar none.

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:23.542
One of the best tools to try and figure out how this team of performers is organized and under whose mentorship they have been brought to us.

01:20:24.202 --> 01:20:26.483
I think that's one of the most important contributions that

01:20:27.552 --> 01:20:34.734
Mark has made to my understanding is that I really understand the common ancestry of this thinking.

01:20:36.495 --> 01:20:40.036
I have read quite a few of the books that these people say are good.

01:20:41.096 --> 01:20:49.559
I have read quite a few of the philosophers that these people follow, like Teilhard de Chardin, and I really do think that

01:20:50.191 --> 01:21:03.916
there is starting to become a good crystal picture of the distortion that's possible just based on this teaching kids that DNA and evolution are real things with real consequences.

01:21:03.936 --> 01:21:08.278
You know, like evolution plus DNA means that's all you are.

01:21:08.738 --> 01:21:10.298
So you got to get off social media.

01:21:10.358 --> 01:21:12.079
You got to get your kids off of social media.

01:21:12.119 --> 01:21:13.880
I know that this is going to be a long process

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.022
but I am already running a soapbox.

01:21:17.102 --> 01:21:18.283
You could run a soapbox.

01:21:18.423 --> 01:21:19.985
I'm already running a peer tube.

01:21:20.025 --> 01:21:21.066
You could run a peer tube.

01:21:21.466 --> 01:21:27.952
And I think more importantly, we need other people to take that lead so that I can link my peer tube to their peer tube.

01:21:27.972 --> 01:21:30.234
We can link our soapbox to theirs, et cetera.

01:21:31.155 --> 01:21:33.076
And it doesn't necessarily need to be soapbox.

01:21:33.537 --> 01:21:35.118
Just remember, this is all they had.

01:21:36.019 --> 01:21:40.663
This is one of the most damning pieces of evidence out there right now, the existence of this man.

01:21:41.724 --> 01:22:02.478
because this man engaged in years and years of meddling with my family by producing content on rumble sometimes three or four hours long often in cooperation with another American trader named Charles Rixey and these guys are part of the same show that Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:08.740
and Dr. Jordan Vaughn are all one malevolent show.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.901
Dr. Jordan Vaughn, I think, was just on Dr. Drew.

01:22:12.481 --> 01:22:15.261
It's all one big joke at this stage.

01:22:15.281 --> 01:22:23.724
The only thing they have now is your continued use of social media platforms where the only people you will see are the ones they want you to see.

01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:32.251
But these are damning pieces of evidence if you see a timeline like this and can't draw conclusions about how they control the narrative.

01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:43.243
Because ending this would have been as simple as telling people that it wasn't appropriate for healthy humans, and we knew that, and that tens of thousands of academic biologists could have done known that.

01:22:44.104 --> 01:22:52.389
because of social media apparently are unable to learn what I've learned by myself that Brian Hooker knew already in 2013.

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:55.171
He was vaccine damaged.

01:22:55.531 --> 01:23:00.395
He was neurologically damaged in condition that we will not call autism.

01:23:00.555 --> 01:23:02.096
I don't like the word autism.

01:23:02.996 --> 01:23:04.037
He was vaccine damaged.

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:08.640
He was neurologically damaged in condition that we will not call

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:14.252
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:23:16.052 --> 01:23:16.752
And I have lied.

01:23:16.772 --> 01:23:17.813
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:18.773
I don't want to lie.

01:23:19.253 --> 01:23:20.593
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:23:20.713 --> 01:23:21.733
I try not to be a liar.

01:23:21.773 --> 01:23:22.613
I don't want to be a liar.

01:23:23.194 --> 01:23:25.934
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:23:31.575 --> 01:23:35.656
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:23:37.486 --> 01:23:38.187
And I have lied.

01:23:38.207 --> 01:23:39.248
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:23:39.268 --> 01:23:40.189
I don't want to lie.

01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:42.050
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.191
I try not to be a liar.

01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:44.052
I don't want to be a liar.

01:23:44.633 --> 01:23:47.335
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:55.690
I am not lying when I say that I think that this Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:55.750 --> 01:24:13.880
at HHS secretary was the culmination of a long-standing plan and script that was put together by Tony Lyons and Steve Bannon a while ago, orchestrated biologically by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Merrill Nass, and orchestrated legally by people like

01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:29.236
Bret Weinstein's father and Mary Holland and the other lawyers that are doing nothing at Children's Health Defense and ICANN, like fellow Goldman Sachs man Aaron Seery.

01:24:29.276 --> 01:24:35.522
And so Bret Weinstein's position as a clown in service to this

01:24:36.623 --> 01:24:41.485
just has to do with his family ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:41.845 --> 01:24:49.467
and their father's work to define the FDA despite Estes Kefauver's desires.

01:24:50.068 --> 01:24:51.308
This is for all the marbles.

01:24:51.328 --> 01:24:53.149
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.669
And I actually think that we might have

01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:08.355
We might have Mary Talley Bowden's attention on X right now so I'm going to repost the interview that I did with her on the Batcave and then I might do a study hall of it tomorrow depending on what it is.

01:25:09.295 --> 01:25:12.177
I honestly don't remember what we talked about because it was so long ago.

01:25:12.197 --> 01:25:12.837
It was in the same

01:25:13.537 --> 01:25:16.938
I think it was in the same year, just after I talked to Kevin McKernan.

01:25:18.259 --> 01:25:27.242
And so she's on Twitter right now, pretending that she doesn't know who I am or complaining that I'm anonymous on Twitter, which is kind of funny.

01:25:28.163 --> 01:25:30.724
So anyway, we've got her attention.

01:25:30.744 --> 01:25:32.344
We're gonna try and send her a couple links.

01:25:32.364 --> 01:25:36.326
So I'm gonna upload that in a little while, after I get off the stream here.

01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:38.927
And remember that- And me and Mary are out there saying,

01:25:39.987 --> 01:25:42.969
Me and Mary are out there saying, this guy's a clown.

01:25:43.409 --> 01:25:45.050
He's definitely part of the performance.

01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:47.952
That's why he's out there at Bitcoin conferences and stuff like that.

01:25:48.812 --> 01:25:51.894
There's no doubt in my mind that he's been given a script and he's following it.

01:25:51.934 --> 01:25:57.218
That's why he's promoting all the same people that I have been lambasting as traitors.

01:25:57.718 --> 01:26:03.321
The scripted bullshit that he put on this stream included Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:03.842 --> 01:26:05.903
And this clown, one of the guys that

01:26:06.543 --> 01:26:10.145
I mean, this has so many layers of clown, it's not even funny.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.406
And he was just recruited by Robert Malone in the UK.

01:26:12.966 --> 01:26:18.849
And then this dude, Kevin McKernan, you know, the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project.

01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:21.690
They're all part of the same show, I assure you.

01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:24.432
And the scripted bullshit for what?

01:26:24.452 --> 01:26:26.034
Well, it's for the Human Genome Project.

01:26:26.094 --> 01:26:30.959
It's to preserve the bad biology 101 that we're supposed to teach to our kids.

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:35.583
That you are nothing but the consequence of your genes and that evolution is real.

01:26:36.044 --> 01:26:37.946
And yes, it's been a long, strange trip.

01:26:38.006 --> 01:26:43.031
I've tried very, very hard to make friends and colleagues with these people to try and understand what they're thinking.

01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:46.835
and help them progress in their own thinking and they haven't been able to do it.

01:26:47.275 --> 01:27:06.754
And that's why I find myself all alone here trying to offer you a new bottle of Biology 101 and asking for your support while my former best friend, I guess, good buddy, super nice guy is the head of the NIH, which is kind of scary.

01:27:08.285 --> 01:27:16.847
The best place to find my guest today would have been in the office he had occupied for more than two decades in an out-of-the-way corner of the Stanford campus.

01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:23.689
And when he came to the door, he would have been wearing his favorite item of clothing, a Stanford hoodie.

01:27:24.989 --> 01:27:33.151
Today, that man is the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya on Uncommon Knowledge Now.

01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:52.093
Isn't it a shame that they've used Thomas Sowell to kind of make this like a, it's almost like you have a Pavlovian response to this music and you think, oh my gosh, I'm finally going to hear a good interview.

01:27:56.036 --> 01:27:57.277
Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:28:01.902
I'm Peter Robinson, a native of India, Jayanta Bhattacharya.

01:28:02.002 --> 01:28:02.902
Did I get that close?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:04.404
I can't pronounce it myself.

01:28:05.485 --> 01:28:07.647
He can't pronounce it himself.

01:28:09.426 --> 01:28:09.846
Shit.

01:28:11.026 --> 01:28:14.307
Jayanta Bhattacharya moved to the United States with his family when he was a child.

01:28:14.948 --> 01:28:31.472
After growing up in Southern California, Dr. Bhattacharya enrolled in Stanford University, where he earned his undergraduate degree, his master's degree, his MD, and his doctorate in economics, and then- I'm not even sure that's possible.

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:40.427
Every university I've ever been at, every program I've ever applied to, everything I've ever heard as advice was that you gotta go somewhere else.

01:28:41.307 --> 01:28:45.070
He can't stay here, but he stayed there for everything?

01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:47.592
It doesn't even really make sense.

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:52.167
became a member of the Stanford faculty.

01:28:52.807 --> 01:29:07.016
During the COVID lockdown, Dr. Bhattacharya helped to write the Great Barrington Declaration, a document that opposed the lockdowns, calling instead for focus protection, that is concentrating efforts on those most at risk while reopening schools and places of work.

01:29:08.017 --> 01:29:13.701
So he wanted to punish the old people and he wanted to inject the old people and let everybody else run.

01:29:14.727 --> 01:29:22.069
Taking this position, Dr. Bhattacharya found himself censored on social media and under attack from public health officials.

01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:34.253
The then director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, referred to Dr. Bhattacharya as, direct quotation, a fringe epidemiologist, close quote.

01:29:34.613 --> 01:29:41.495
Could have just redacted that under national security, you know, just don't want them to know what I said.

01:29:41.535 --> 01:29:43.236
They could have redacted that, but they didn't.

01:29:44.244 --> 01:29:45.385
That's the thing you need to see.

01:29:45.425 --> 01:29:52.491
There is nothing stopping anyone from redacting anything from a FOIA because nobody's checking afterward.

01:29:52.951 --> 01:29:59.296
It's not like there's this whole committee and they can do a replay and say, okay, is it fair that they did this?

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:00.620
Come on.

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:01.601
Stop lying.

01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:03.242
This is all part of the show.

01:30:03.282 --> 01:30:08.686
This is as dumb as saying that the diffuse proposal is obviously a real leak and we learned something from it.

01:30:09.327 --> 01:30:09.887
Come on.

01:30:10.668 --> 01:30:17.252
This is the kind of stupid shit that they have laid down for five years that everybody has bought into as part of the Scooby-Doo.

01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:29.361
Then came the election of Donald Trump and the new director of the National Institutes of Health is the fringe epidemiologist, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.

01:30:30.492 --> 01:30:32.053
Jay, welcome back to Uncommon Knowledge.

01:30:32.533 --> 01:30:33.374
Thank you for having me, Peter.

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:40.659
In the interest of full disclosure, I suppose we may as well admit that we've been friends for a quarter of a century.

01:30:41.099 --> 01:30:41.920
A little longer than that.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:42.800
Oh, stop.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.441
Stop there.

01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:44.361
We're both old, Peter.

01:30:44.601 --> 01:30:45.122
Stop there.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:50.285
And for that matter, that you and I, I was with you when you picked out that very suit.

01:30:51.006 --> 01:30:53.988
For your information, five days before Jay left

01:30:54.994 --> 01:30:57.135
Palo Alto to move to Washington.

01:30:57.575 --> 01:31:06.120
We had a conversation, and I discovered that he owned exactly two suits, and that one was a suit his mother had bought for him when he was on the high school debate team.

01:31:06.581 --> 01:31:08.902
So we went to a shop and bought some suits.

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:13.124
OK, so Jay, this leads to my very first overarching question.

01:31:14.485 --> 01:31:18.027
You arrived at Stanford University in 1985 at the age of 17.

01:31:19.388 --> 01:31:22.750
Aside from a couple of very brief stints, you ran for a while.

01:31:23.595 --> 01:31:35.379
But aside from a couple of brief stints at Rand, holy shit, you spent your entire life at Stanford University.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.341
I once asked you what was the biggest outfit you had ever overseen.

01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:44.383
And you thought for a moment and said, I had six researchers working on a project once.

01:31:45.603 --> 01:31:47.704
Here you sit in a suit.

01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:57.677
Director of the National Institutes of Health, an agency with over 20,000 employees, and a budget of $48 billion.

01:31:59.318 --> 01:32:02.340
Jerry, I say this as a friend.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.281
What do you think you're doing?

01:32:05.163 --> 01:32:10.892
You know, Peter, the key thing I've learned since I've taken office is you have to get help.

01:32:11.113 --> 01:32:16.401
You have to get people who know how to do the things that I know I know I don't know how to do.

01:32:16.502 --> 01:32:19.066
I wonder if Robert Malone's helping him with anything.

01:32:21.906 --> 01:32:32.551
And that's been probably the best surprise for me is the number of amazing, excellent people that I've found to help me accomplish the impossible.

01:32:32.991 --> 01:32:37.533
So step one in running an organization that large is to find good people and learn how to delegate.

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:38.093
Yeah.

01:32:38.493 --> 01:32:40.414
Okay, and that's been easy for you, somehow.

01:32:40.494 --> 01:32:41.234
You have no choice.

01:32:41.294 --> 01:32:43.896
When you're running an organization with 20,000 people, you have to delegate.

01:32:44.076 --> 01:32:51.599
But the key thing, I think, is to provide a vision, a clear direction about where I would like to see the organization go.

01:32:51.659 --> 01:32:52.860
And there are real challenges.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.041
I'm sure you're going to ask me about that.

01:32:56.081 --> 01:32:56.481
Yes, I will.

01:32:56.521 --> 01:32:59.743
That the NIH faces in light of what happened during the pandemic.

01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:10.518
And so I view that as my primary job, to convey both to the organization, but also it's not just a corporation or something like that.

01:33:10.799 --> 01:33:11.479
It's a government.

01:33:11.659 --> 01:33:14.982
It's the most important biomedical research institute in the world.

01:33:15.503 --> 01:33:17.464
It's a part of the federal government.

01:33:18.185 --> 01:33:19.426
It answers to the American people.

01:33:19.926 --> 01:33:26.792
So I have to convey not just to the people who work there, but to the American taxpayers who

01:33:26.912 --> 01:33:32.173
So we have a surgeon general who went to Stanford Medical School and dropped out of a residency.

01:33:33.793 --> 01:33:35.194
That's also something here.

01:33:35.254 --> 01:33:36.514
We have Vivek Murthy.

01:33:36.634 --> 01:33:39.175
Murthy was also an Indian guy.

01:33:39.655 --> 01:33:43.515
Yeah, there's a lot of things connecting now.

01:33:43.715 --> 01:33:47.396
We have to defend that $48 billion to the American people.

01:33:49.037 --> 01:33:53.758
You and I have talked on this show half a dozen times about the COVID experience.

01:33:53.958 --> 01:33:55.838
So we needn't go into that at great length now.

01:33:57.179 --> 01:34:04.382
but it forms the background of, as I understand it, but it forms the background of all you're thinking about the NIH.

01:34:04.962 --> 01:34:13.265
So what I take as the central lessons of the lockdown is that the lockdown itself was an overreach.

01:34:13.566 --> 01:34:16.127
But why is the NIH responsible for that?

01:34:16.267 --> 01:34:17.987
I don't understand what this even means.

01:34:18.067 --> 01:34:19.088
What is he talking about?

01:34:19.248 --> 01:34:20.368
What is this bullshit?

01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:22.669
Am I wrong?

01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:24.590
What has the NIH got to do with this?

01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:26.651
That the public health officials

01:34:27.967 --> 01:34:43.619
were acting at least in large measure on political calculation and not entirely on science, that much of what they portrayed as science wasn't science, and that they got one big thing after another wrong.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.563
So you put up on X, you put up a post shortly after you were nominated.

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:53.847
I am honored and humbled by President Donald Trump's nomination of the next NIH director

01:34:54.727 --> 01:35:00.528
We will reform American scientific institutions so that they are worthy of trust.

01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.662
So who are those scientific institutions?

01:35:04.722 --> 01:35:06.543
Is he talking about universities?

01:35:06.683 --> 01:35:09.945
Because that's, I don't get it.

01:35:10.025 --> 01:35:11.065
What is he talking about?

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:18.109
What institutions can he reform as NIH director?

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:19.549
Can you put anything in the chat?

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:20.290
What can he do?

01:35:20.770 --> 01:35:21.730
How's the project going?

01:35:22.871 --> 01:35:24.912
We've made some progress, but there's still a long way to go.

01:35:25.752 --> 01:35:30.315
Let's just say, I had actually been studying the NIH as a matter of my own research.

01:35:31.397 --> 01:35:34.218
for a long while before the pandemic.

01:35:34.498 --> 01:35:37.740
And so I had identified some problems.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:43.562
I mean, this is not all that novel because a lot of people identified the same problems.

01:35:43.642 --> 01:35:54.847
The fact that the NIH is responsible for addressing a crisis in the scientific community of people being unable to replicate basic work.

01:35:55.889 --> 01:36:01.085
Okay, so we've already moved on from reforming the scientific agencies or institutions.

01:36:01.165 --> 01:36:01.366
What

01:36:02.455 --> 01:36:03.616
These are magic words.

01:36:03.696 --> 01:36:05.556
These are enchantments that mean nothing.

01:36:06.157 --> 01:36:12.980
But they're big words that for the average American in their daily grind, it's just like, OK, whatever.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.040
OK, that's fine.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.641
He's a dude.

01:36:15.941 --> 01:36:29.547
I'd worked on measuring the sort of inherent risk aversion of the NIH research portfolio, which often avoided

01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:37.823
investments in things that would potentially have enormous benefits but risk becoming failed projects.

01:36:37.983 --> 01:36:40.588
The goal is to have every single project succeed.

01:36:40.969 --> 01:36:44.075
If you have that, the whole portfolio as a whole is a failure.

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:46.231
because you haven't made the big advances.

01:36:47.031 --> 01:36:49.652
This is all stuff I've worked on before the pandemic.

01:36:50.032 --> 01:36:53.053
So he's talking kind of like the EU, you got to take more risks.

01:36:53.133 --> 01:36:55.094
You got to fund more projects that fail.

01:36:55.254 --> 01:36:56.194
Oh boy, here we go.

01:36:56.254 --> 01:36:57.114
This is even worse.

01:36:57.354 --> 01:36:58.415
I want to come to all of that.

01:36:59.055 --> 01:37:00.896
Could I also, this is the layman here.

01:37:01.716 --> 01:37:05.362
This is the layman sitting back in California watching NIH and watching you.

01:37:05.983 --> 01:37:14.737
But before we depart from the COVID experience altogether, one of the things that always struck me, I don't think I ever asked you about this actually, but you conducted a study

01:37:15.851 --> 01:37:16.991
You've got some donor to give you $5,000.

01:37:17.391 --> 01:37:20.412
The princely sum, as I recall, of five grand.

01:37:20.452 --> 01:37:21.133
Wasn't that what it was?

01:37:21.153 --> 01:37:23.453
You're talking about the seroprevalence?

01:37:23.473 --> 01:37:24.173
Yes, yes.

01:37:24.373 --> 01:37:33.216
So you conducted a study in March of 2020 asking, wait a minute, let's see if we can find out just how infectious this thing is.

01:37:33.636 --> 01:37:36.617
Oh, so Jay Bhattacharya is the final author on that.

01:37:37.748 --> 01:37:39.649
Let's find out how infectious it is.

01:37:39.729 --> 01:37:41.410
Let's measure seroprevalence.

01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:50.793
Let's tell everybody and agree with everybody that seroprevalence is a evidence of infection, evidence of spread, evidence of a novel virus.

01:37:50.953 --> 01:37:55.035
Look at this carefully and see it for the treachery that it is.

01:37:55.675 --> 01:37:56.716
He is on a script.

01:37:57.436 --> 01:37:58.717
He's going with the script.

01:37:59.197 --> 01:38:00.377
They're reading the script.

01:38:02.058 --> 01:38:06.080
So you tested people in Santa Clara County and you discovered that it was

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:11.979
more infectious, but less lethal than the public health authorities understood.

01:38:12.419 --> 01:38:13.741
And it has always struck me.

01:38:14.582 --> 01:38:16.103
Look at that face.

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:19.147
He knows he's lying.

01:38:20.769 --> 01:38:25.033
That whole study was probably bullshit and probably he was put there to do it.

01:38:25.314 --> 01:38:28.097
It was part of the whole operation from the very beginning.

01:38:28.971 --> 01:38:38.173
that this whole line of trajectory through all of this pandemic was absolutely scripted, very, very scripted.

01:38:39.434 --> 01:38:46.135
Not that dissimilar to how Vinay Prasad and ZDogg and Marty McCarty were scripted for those four years.

01:38:46.195 --> 01:38:51.877
Took a year off and then started running for office in 2024 once the opportunity was there.

01:38:51.997 --> 01:38:52.957
It's really gross.

01:38:53.797 --> 01:38:56.478
Right there, this strange,

01:38:57.483 --> 01:39:05.729
failing NIH, CDC, we are talking about budgets of tens of billions of dollars a year.

01:39:06.309 --> 01:39:13.715
And yet it fell to Jay Bhattacharya and some donor who was willing to pop five grand to conduct the first such study.

01:39:14.055 --> 01:39:21.360
I don't remember it being so obvious as it is right now to me that Jay Bhattacharya is nothing more than a guy on a script.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.782
It is absolutely spectacular.

01:39:25.134 --> 01:39:29.739
Why wasn't NIH conducting studies all over the country?

01:39:29.799 --> 01:39:31.802
Why didn't they have good data by that point?

01:39:32.202 --> 01:39:35.185
That was a failure of the public health establishment in this country.

01:39:35.666 --> 01:39:37.168
They should have conducted that study.

01:39:37.328 --> 01:39:38.409
Immediately, shouldn't they?

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:39.410
In February 2020.

01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:44.334
They should have had measures of how widespread the disease was much earlier.

01:39:44.955 --> 01:39:53.681
I wrote an op-ed, which actually you helped me design, because I'd never written an op-ed before, to say that in the Wall Street Journal in March of 2020.

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:56.943
To say, look, we don't know how widespread the disease is.

01:39:57.163 --> 01:40:01.527
It's a vitally important fact that we need to know to design the right policy.

01:40:01.547 --> 01:40:01.807
Yes.

01:40:03.168 --> 01:40:05.670
And let's immediately learn that.

01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:06.991
Let's conduct a study to do that.

01:40:07.631 --> 01:40:10.152
That $5,000, by the way, it was to Stanford, not to me.

01:40:10.452 --> 01:40:12.012
I saw $0 of it myself.

01:40:13.572 --> 01:40:16.993
The fact that the public health establishment failed it.

01:40:17.974 --> 01:40:20.574
I mean, he had to go back to the funding part again, right?

01:40:20.594 --> 01:40:21.994
The $5,000 part.

01:40:22.315 --> 01:40:23.235
Oh, my gosh.

01:40:23.795 --> 01:40:28.436
It should have been a signal that there was something deeply wrong with how the public health.

01:40:28.456 --> 01:40:28.916
From the get-go.

01:40:28.976 --> 01:40:29.456
From the beginning.

01:40:29.476 --> 01:40:29.656
All right.

01:40:30.156 --> 01:40:30.797
Replication.

01:40:30.817 --> 01:40:36.378
This is one of the three big initiatives that you've spoken about that you intend to undertake at NIH.

01:40:37.210 --> 01:40:38.251
A couple of quotations.

01:40:38.952 --> 01:40:39.713
Again, this is me.

01:40:40.073 --> 01:40:41.375
You know what a layman I am.

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:45.520
I'm just trying to figure out what is this business about replication?

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.881
Here's quotation number one.

01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:48.823
This comes from a 2005 paper.

01:40:49.284 --> 01:40:54.410
This is 20 years ago by your Stanford colleague and friend, John Ioannidis.

01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:56.592
Quote, it can be proven

01:40:57.335 --> 01:41:00.238
that most claimed research findings are false.

01:41:00.479 --> 01:41:05.204
Notice that that guy is the other author on the paper of seroprevalence.

01:41:05.224 --> 01:41:07.407
So both of them published that paper.

01:41:07.467 --> 01:41:12.793
They were both put in place at the beginning, wittingly or unwittingly, absolutely for certain.

01:41:13.193 --> 01:41:17.138
Maybe Jay Bhattacharya's job was to rope this guy in.

01:41:19.167 --> 01:41:19.988
Let me repeat that.

01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:25.414
It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false.

01:41:25.554 --> 01:41:26.475
Close quote.

01:41:27.376 --> 01:41:37.967
From a 2021 article in Science, the Reproducibility Project Cancer Biology set out to reproduce experiments from 53 high-profile papers published between 2010 and 2012

01:41:39.989 --> 01:41:46.873
Consistent with replication efforts in other areas of science, original positive results could only be replicated 40% of the time.

01:41:47.414 --> 01:41:50.976
Only 5 of the 53 papers had results that could be fully reproduced."

01:41:51.717 --> 01:41:55.319
Let me make one statement here just to make sure you understand what's going on.

01:41:55.379 --> 01:41:59.201
There are different ways of reproducing things and there are different levels of

01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:01.762
of this problem.

01:42:02.702 --> 01:42:12.789
And I'm going to toot my own horn here and say that I was able to accomplish a methodology and measurements that very few people were able to accomplish.

01:42:13.409 --> 01:42:20.494
Even if I was to tell you all the equipment that I used and all the tricks that I had, you would need to train with me.

01:42:21.423 --> 01:42:25.666
in order to do the experiments that I did in the same way that I did them.

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:29.369
Because if you didn't, you would inevitably probably fail.

01:42:29.469 --> 01:42:43.239
And that's true for a lot of neurobiological experiments because the experiments are and the parameters of how they measure it and what they're measuring and how they train the animals is extremely relevant to the results that they get.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.903
And so the replication crisis is a problem.

01:42:48.923 --> 01:42:50.424
I agree, it's a problem.

01:42:51.024 --> 01:42:57.769
But it is a problem that exists in certain parts of science, in certain sections of science.

01:42:57.809 --> 01:43:04.274
There are large swaths of biology that are still producing useful data about useful questions.

01:43:04.334 --> 01:43:07.896
It's just that these people aren't making any money off of those questions.

01:43:07.936 --> 01:43:10.218
And those questions can't be used to enslave people.

01:43:11.909 --> 01:43:13.450
the answers to those questions.

01:43:14.091 --> 01:43:22.938
And so make it very clear, this is a, the replication crisis is a crisis that's not quite the same as what they're going to make it up to be.

01:43:23.398 --> 01:43:26.681
It's mostly a crisis of using probability

01:43:27.361 --> 01:43:30.503
to show something is true when it's not.

01:43:30.984 --> 01:43:39.310
And that's something that my friend Matt Briggs works on all the time and is teaching a course about that we were gonna audit, but we didn't because these people haven't stopped.

01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:45.475
And Bobby got HHS and this guy got on at the head of NIH.

01:43:45.515 --> 01:43:48.857
So I don't know how I can stop.

01:43:50.138 --> 01:43:52.660
So Ioannidis says, 20 years ago,

01:43:55.182 --> 01:44:00.164
The scientific establishment is letting colleagues get away with it.

01:44:00.704 --> 01:44:03.005
Nobody's repeating anybody else's experiments.

01:44:03.886 --> 01:44:07.407
And then a dozen, 15 years later, we get more studies saying, you know what?

01:44:08.368 --> 01:44:10.649
We've tried 53 studies.

01:44:11.009 --> 01:44:12.370
These results are all over the place.

01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:13.270
We can't replicate them.

01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:19.853
This is the most basic work that the scientific establishment does, science.

01:44:21.611 --> 01:44:25.192
Testing results, making sure that we know what we think we know.

01:44:25.452 --> 01:44:26.693
Am I losing my mind?

01:44:26.733 --> 01:44:28.753
This strikes me as obvious.

01:44:30.214 --> 01:44:32.054
And it takes you to say so?

01:44:32.114 --> 01:44:36.135
Well, I mean, brilliant people like John Ioannidis have been saying this, as you say, for decades.

01:44:37.236 --> 01:44:40.837
Let me describe the fundamental problem.

01:44:41.197 --> 01:44:44.418
There's some very flashy things having to do with scientific fraud.

01:44:46.331 --> 01:44:48.813
that are part of the problem but are not the root problem.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:57.599
So that Alzheimer's research is... For instance, or the... That's obviously... Remember, this is a guy who's a member of the broken science group.

01:44:57.959 --> 01:45:07.765
I met him at several broken science meetings where Matt Briggs or William Briggs is the statistician guy there, spoke many times.

01:45:09.042 --> 01:45:14.583
This guy knows exactly what's wrong with academic science, and he knows its p-values.

01:45:14.763 --> 01:45:21.644
He knows that it's hypothesis testing the null hypothesis illusion.

01:45:22.644 --> 01:45:23.264
Be fraudulent.

01:45:23.364 --> 01:45:25.005
Yes, there's scientific fraud.

01:45:25.025 --> 01:45:31.866
But the root problem is that we have a scientific culture that doesn't recognize how difficult science actually is.

01:45:32.366 --> 01:45:37.647
And it punishes failure too sharply and has the wrong standards of truth.

01:45:38.972 --> 01:45:40.033
Those are the fundamental reasons.

01:45:40.053 --> 01:45:42.435
So let me just tease that apart in just a bit.

01:45:43.116 --> 01:45:46.098
So first, let's start with the standards of truth.

01:45:46.738 --> 01:45:54.925
A paper that is published in a peer-reviewed journal, folks think that that means that if it's published in a top peer-reviewed journal, therefore, it must be true.

01:45:55.005 --> 01:45:56.006
That's what I've always thought.

01:45:56.046 --> 01:45:57.727
And that's actually inaccurate.

01:45:58.288 --> 01:45:59.569
So the peer-reviewed process

01:46:00.779 --> 01:46:02.120
What happens is I write a paper.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.701
Everybody in science has known that for decades.

01:46:04.781 --> 01:46:09.923
I was told that over half of nature papers get proven wrong in the five years following it.

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:12.444
So it's not like we didn't know this already.

01:46:12.904 --> 01:46:14.825
And again, it's a hamster wheel.

01:46:14.985 --> 01:46:17.125
We knew this in the 90s for shit's sake.

01:46:18.626 --> 01:46:19.546
I'll send it to a journal.

01:46:19.786 --> 01:46:25.949
If I'm lucky, the journal editor will send it out to two or three peer reviewers chosen by the editor.

01:46:27.513 --> 01:46:29.995
There's games played to try to influence the editor.

01:46:30.035 --> 01:46:33.097
If they're friendly with the editor, they'll send it to friendly peer reviewers.

01:46:33.797 --> 01:46:42.963
The peer reviewers themselves might read the paper, look for logical errors, maybe have some questions that they want addressed, but they won't actually replicate the results of the paper.

01:46:43.403 --> 01:46:45.404
They won't have the data to produce the paper.

01:46:45.424 --> 01:46:46.405
They're just reading the paper.

01:46:46.425 --> 01:46:48.166
They're not looking at the actual data.

01:46:48.426 --> 01:46:51.168
It's very, very rare, almost unheard of in biomedicine.

01:46:51.368 --> 01:46:53.349
There's nothing wrong with that in theory.

01:46:53.709 --> 01:47:12.460
If the paper is written well, the experiments are done well, and I can give you countless examples of it in neuroscience where papers are done well, the results are not exaggerated or extrapolated beyond their significance, and a little tiny progress is made in understanding what a protein might do in this little experimental model.

01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:25.022
They're not necessarily making any great gains in understanding, but I do think they're producing little pieces of knowledge that help us understand a little bit better how irreducibly complex we are.

01:47:27.412 --> 01:47:38.639
It's the research that purports to solve big mysteries, purports to answer big questions, purports to have solved very complex concepts.

01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:45.504
Those are the kinds of things that are not reproducible and are totally bullshit.

01:47:45.604 --> 01:47:49.847
And again, they don't seem to be able to distinguish those differences.

01:47:49.927 --> 01:47:52.368
This is really, really sad.

01:47:52.829 --> 01:47:55.691
For the peer reviewers to review the data themselves.

01:47:56.511 --> 01:48:03.135
And so then if the peer reviewer signs off, the editor signs off, you get to publish in a peer review journal, that doesn't mean that the result is right.

01:48:03.195 --> 01:48:07.537
It just means it's passed through this peer review process, which doesn't check to see if the results are reproducible.

01:48:09.881 --> 01:48:12.724
It doesn't mean the results are correct.

01:48:12.844 --> 01:48:17.668
It just means that the establishment has signed off on it.

01:48:18.569 --> 01:48:20.030
Wow.

01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:32.541
It's funny because Frontiers in Neuroscience is a journal started by Henry Markram in Switzerland, the Blue Brain Project guy.

01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:48.469
Who you're probably not familiar with but at some point in time that was a really big deal a billion euro project funded by the EU and that guy actually What it what was I shoot now I would thought of something else

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.101
I actually thought of a cafe.

01:48:51.462 --> 01:48:54.964
You get a CV filled with peer-reviewed papers.

01:48:54.984 --> 01:48:55.685
Oh, yeah.

01:48:55.965 --> 01:48:56.346
That's right.

01:48:56.386 --> 01:48:57.687
That's what I was going to say.

01:48:59.048 --> 01:49:18.603
I started thinking of a cafe called The Chateau in Lausanne, Switzerland, which if you ever have the chance to be in Switzerland and go to Lausanne and just walk around and find The Chateau and have a pizza and have the Neapolitano pizza,

01:49:19.657 --> 01:49:25.582
and tell me that for a brief period of time, you're not just in the perfect place.

01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:28.425
Like, it'll feel like that.

01:49:28.765 --> 01:49:33.769
It's a mountain village with mountain people and young people.

01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:42.157
And if you have a beer and a pizza in that place, I don't know if there's a more

01:49:43.627 --> 01:49:50.515
I just, one of the best places that I've ever been and some of the best memories I've ever had are in Lausanne, Switzerland.

01:49:50.555 --> 01:49:51.857
And anyway, that's...

01:49:54.082 --> 01:49:58.206
Actually, I asked my wife to marry me in Lausanne, Switzerland with a shitty ring.

01:49:59.187 --> 01:50:01.068
But what was I going to say?

01:50:01.088 --> 01:50:01.309
Yes.

01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:13.440
Henry Markram, this guy, started this journal, Frontiers in Neuroscience, because he wanted to have a journal where replication could be done and would be published.

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.063
Not funded, of course, but at least it would be published.

01:50:17.083 --> 01:50:18.945
I don't know if that's ever actually where it went.

01:50:19.545 --> 01:50:26.850
Frontiers in Neuroscience just became another journal, I think, although the peer review was supposed to be better and they were trying to improve on it as well.

01:50:27.271 --> 01:50:37.958
And don't forget that one of the things that Kevin McKernan has in his back pocket is a Bitcoin slash crypto slash, what is it called?

01:50:39.519 --> 01:50:43.142
Blockchain solution to peer review.

01:50:44.224 --> 01:50:47.209
and peer review publishing under blockchain review.

01:50:47.630 --> 01:50:56.145
Don't forget that Matt Crawford and Kevin McKernan have presented that idea in multiple ways.

01:51:00.114 --> 01:51:01.235
It's filled with peer-reviewed papers.

01:51:01.255 --> 01:51:04.176
That's why I have a position at Stanford, or had a position at Stanford University.

01:51:04.376 --> 01:51:06.418
So you're telling me I should be much less impressed by your work?

01:51:06.438 --> 01:51:08.219
You absolutely should be much less impressed by it.

01:51:08.259 --> 01:51:10.300
Not just my work, but by everything.

01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:13.682
Now, fundamentally, the scientific process is hard.

01:51:15.874 --> 01:51:23.818
the published peer-reviewed literature then will have some results that are false positives.

01:51:23.938 --> 01:51:30.662
And when I say that, what I mean is that they're published, you think they're true because they're published, but they're not true.

01:51:30.982 --> 01:51:33.323
And that paper that you cited by John Enidis.

01:51:33.963 --> 01:51:36.244
But see, that's not how science works.

01:51:36.304 --> 01:51:42.968
This is a very disingenuous way to describe how academics read other academics' papers.

01:51:44.668 --> 01:51:47.529
All academics are aware that exaggeration occurs.

01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:52.111
All academics are aware that you try to tie your research to the most important things.

01:51:52.552 --> 01:52:08.218
You know, if you're gonna do nicotine research, you almost inevitably are gonna start every abstract or every introduction or every grant proposal with the idea that the WHO says that tobacco is the number one cause of health related blah, blah, blah, and costs billions of dollars every year.

01:52:09.919 --> 01:52:11.500
I know because I used to do it.

01:52:12.458 --> 01:52:20.403
If you're going to work on Angelman syndrome and you're going to work on a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, you're not going to say that you're trying to save Angelman syndrome kids.

01:52:20.803 --> 01:52:28.929
You're going to try and tell them that this has ramifications for everything from Parkinson's disease to autism, to spectrum disorder, to ADHD.

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:35.213
And so my research on, on Angelman's disease is important for all of these problems of humanity.

01:52:36.803 --> 01:52:50.673
And so when scientists read other scientists' work, not only are they scrutinizing the experimental results, but they're scrutinizing the claims that these scientists make about the experimental results, ramifications.

01:52:52.074 --> 01:53:01.942
And we all take each other with a grain of salt, especially the review articles, especially these nature articles where people are just trying to make their new lab or their new name.

01:53:04.016 --> 01:53:09.719
So yes, it's a problem, but it's not the same problem that he's describing here.

01:53:09.739 --> 01:53:11.639
And it's remarkable.

01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:23.465
It makes a very convincing claim, just based on the standards of how we decide what scientific research can get published, that a large chunk of the published peer-reviewed literature is probably false.

01:53:24.201 --> 01:53:26.144
Not intentionally, it's just hard to do science.

01:53:26.224 --> 01:53:29.329
I may have a result, and I think it's true.

01:53:29.489 --> 01:53:31.572
I've done some investigation into it.

01:53:32.674 --> 01:53:37.261
I've done some statistics on it, which is what he should have said.

01:53:38.022 --> 01:53:38.963
Big failure there.

01:53:41.052 --> 01:53:44.615
It might not be true, because maybe I made some error that I didn't realize.

01:53:44.795 --> 01:53:49.618
No, it's because you use p-values to declare it true.

01:53:50.158 --> 01:53:53.260
You are part of the broken science initiative.

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:55.081
You ought to know this.

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:58.243
Wow.

01:53:58.823 --> 01:54:00.825
I mean, that is like, what do you want?

01:54:02.341 --> 01:54:06.043
What was he invited to all those barbecues for?

01:54:06.103 --> 01:54:17.368
What did he sit there and listen to all those lectures for if he didn't absorb the big simple message that using p-values to prove things or create facts is bullshit?

01:54:18.356 --> 01:54:21.637
We need to have models and then they need to be verified.

01:54:22.317 --> 01:54:24.238
And we're not doing that in science.

01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:25.038
Wow.

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:26.878
Holy cow.

01:54:27.539 --> 01:54:31.580
Maybe the thing is just a lot of things just happen and you haven't thought of everything.

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.321
The right standard of truth in science then isn't

01:54:36.141 --> 01:54:40.564
is one paper making a claim, and it's peer-reviewed, and it's published in a top journal.

01:54:40.885 --> 01:54:48.810
The right standard of truth is, do other independent research teams, asking the same question, using different methodology, do they arrive at the same conclusion?

01:54:49.231 --> 01:54:52.813
And if lots and lots of research teams arrive at the same conclusion, then we just have something.

01:54:53.013 --> 01:54:53.294
Yeah.

01:54:53.734 --> 01:54:57.216
So you mentioned, for instance, that Santa Clara syrup problem study that I conducted.

01:54:57.477 --> 01:55:00.139
It was a very controversial result, very early in the pandemic.

01:55:00.859 --> 01:55:10.441
But dozens of other research teams around the world asking the same question in different settings, in different places, found results that are roughly congruent with that result.

01:55:10.781 --> 01:55:14.862
Roughly congruent, asking the same bad question.

01:55:17.162 --> 01:55:18.463
Make sure you understand that.

01:55:19.123 --> 01:55:23.944
Asking the same bad question based on the same bad assumptions.

01:55:26.381 --> 01:55:28.064
He's not telling you the truth here.

01:55:28.545 --> 01:55:31.569
He's narrative control master play right here.

01:55:32.441 --> 01:55:38.983
The fact that the paper was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, I mean, I was glad it was published, but that's not what makes it true.

01:55:39.003 --> 01:55:49.166
What makes it true is the independent replication by dozens of other research teams that found very similar results in places where people are older, they tend to get higher death rates.

01:55:49.326 --> 01:55:52.086
In places where people are younger, they tend to get lower death rates.

01:55:52.106 --> 01:55:55.687
We were kind of right in the middle, because we were looking at people who weren't in nursing homes.

01:55:58.719 --> 01:56:01.662
I like the point that SixGirl is making in the chat.

01:56:01.702 --> 01:56:09.488
You see, peer review is actually much more dangerous for what it probably doesn't allow to be published than what gets published.

01:56:09.628 --> 01:56:14.453
And that part of the problem is much more dangerous than what he's talking about.

01:56:14.973 --> 01:56:16.634
And think about that point.

01:56:16.775 --> 01:56:19.697
That is an excellent, excellent point in the chat.

01:56:19.777 --> 01:56:20.318
Well done.

01:56:20.338 --> 01:56:22.680
It's a thing where everybody learns science and

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.141
you know, they first introduced the science in fourth grade, they learned about replication.

01:56:26.601 --> 01:56:32.423
But the entirety of the scientific infrastructure is set up to not have that as the standard of truth.

01:56:33.763 --> 01:56:38.865
Okay, so that strikes me as mad, and it makes me, I mean,

01:56:39.682 --> 01:56:51.426
this is, I'm here to represent the angry American public, that billions upon billions of dollars get spent on this year in and year out, and nobody does double checking, is essentially what you're saying.

01:56:51.666 --> 01:56:55.067
But you're also saying to me, American public, calm down.

01:56:55.807 --> 01:56:56.667
Science is hard.

01:56:57.228 --> 01:57:07.551
Scientists are in some way or another, you could almost describe them as victims of a process, of a procedure, and we need to change the institutional approach

01:57:08.618 --> 01:57:09.718
of the research project.

01:57:09.738 --> 01:57:16.420
Now, my argument would be that we need to change the way that we apprentice science.

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:18.660
The whole postdoc system is stupid.

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:33.483
The only person who apparently benefits from having five postdocs is Jessica Rose because she's allowed to go around for the last five years and claim that we're five degrees as opposed to five consecutive failures to get tenure track.

01:57:34.755 --> 01:57:37.777
That's the extent to which this lie is occurring.

01:57:38.277 --> 01:57:44.240
That dude is promoted by people like Jessica Rose who have masqueraded as an academic gone rogue.

01:57:44.681 --> 01:57:48.863
When in reality, she's a failed academic who couldn't have gotten tenure if she tried.

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:53.646
That's the reality of where we are.

01:57:54.786 --> 01:57:59.689
This guy is as big a fraud as Jessica Rose and probably as manufactured.

01:58:01.287 --> 01:58:02.128
throughout the country.

01:58:02.268 --> 01:58:02.809
Is that correct?

01:58:02.829 --> 01:58:03.329
That's correct.

01:58:03.369 --> 01:58:04.270
How are you going to do that?

01:58:04.671 --> 01:58:06.313
So a few things.

01:58:06.353 --> 01:58:07.574
I like you so much, Jay.

01:58:07.594 --> 01:58:10.898
I almost believe that if anybody were going to do it, you're going to do it.

01:58:11.098 --> 01:58:12.239
How can you take this on?

01:58:12.539 --> 01:58:14.802
It sounds huge.

01:58:15.603 --> 01:58:19.287
I think first, if there's going to be an institution that does it, it's got to be the National Institute of Health.

01:58:19.887 --> 01:58:21.948
So you're sitting in the right chair.

01:58:21.988 --> 01:58:26.189
Yeah, so it funds a tremendous amount of science.

01:58:26.349 --> 01:58:29.209
And I don't want to paint a too bleak a picture.

01:58:29.549 --> 01:58:34.931
There are real advances that science has made, funded by the NIH, for instance, that have improved human health.

01:58:35.331 --> 01:58:35.671
Yes.

01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:37.271
Behold!

01:58:37.511 --> 01:58:41.692
Within the pool of scientific papers, not everything is false.

01:58:42.992 --> 01:58:47.354
We just have systems that don't necessarily distinguish true from false often enough.

01:58:47.654 --> 01:58:48.974
That's the fundamental problem.

01:58:51.838 --> 01:58:52.519
So here's what you do.

01:58:52.739 --> 01:58:58.823
First, you have to make it so that replication is a viable path for a career.

01:58:59.863 --> 01:59:01.084
Every scientist does that.

01:59:01.364 --> 01:59:07.208
A real paper is supposedly doing the replication as part of the experiment.

01:59:07.228 --> 01:59:08.809
So this is really wacky.

01:59:09.807 --> 01:59:12.832
are just selling a lie here, an absolute lie.

01:59:12.872 --> 01:59:14.975
This is where your doctorate in economics comes in.

01:59:15.235 --> 01:59:17.278
Yeah, it's just incentive structures.

01:59:17.498 --> 01:59:23.066
You create systems that... He has a doctorate in the science of economics.

01:59:23.146 --> 01:59:24.368
I mean, seriously, this is...

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:37.050
And that makes him an MD, PhD, which is really unbelievable.

01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:40.834
Provide the incentives in the right direction, you'll get the results in the right direction.

01:59:41.014 --> 01:59:43.156
That's basic economics, I guess.

01:59:44.578 --> 01:59:47.080
So you have to award.

01:59:48.425 --> 01:59:52.347
high-profile research grants to scientists who creatively do replication work.

01:59:52.888 --> 01:59:56.990
They identify what are the key claims in the literature that need replication.

01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:05.095
By the way, if you talk to drug developers, they'll tell you this, that they do this, they do private replication, because they don't trust the published biomedical literature.

02:00:05.515 --> 02:00:06.816
So they'll privately replicate.

02:00:07.016 --> 02:00:13.480
Are you telling me that the drug people are much more, like, they're much...

02:00:16.927 --> 02:00:19.189
Oh my gosh, what is happening?

02:00:19.249 --> 02:00:24.673
The key results before they decide to invest tens of millions of dollars in development.

02:00:24.693 --> 02:00:27.875
So replication is taking place, but it's in a haphazard and private way.

02:00:28.215 --> 02:00:28.355
Yes.

02:00:29.636 --> 02:00:30.157
OK.

02:00:30.197 --> 02:00:30.957
OK, so that's one.

02:00:30.977 --> 02:00:38.603
You have to incentivize replication by rewarding it with high profile grants from an institution with prestige like the NIH.

02:00:38.743 --> 02:00:39.864
And you can do that at NIH?

02:00:39.944 --> 02:00:40.564
I'm going to do that.

02:00:40.724 --> 02:00:40.924
OK.

02:00:41.265 --> 02:00:44.507
Second, you have to have a place to publish the replication work.

02:00:44.747 --> 02:00:49.449
Because right now, if you send your replication work to a top journal, there's no chance of it being published.

02:00:49.469 --> 02:00:50.269
They'll say it's not original.

02:00:52.010 --> 02:01:03.914
So you have to have a high-profile place where people can publish the replication work, where it's easily searchable so that people can, like, get a... Isn't it weird that Henry Markram had this idea, like, really back in 2003?

02:01:06.021 --> 02:01:06.582
That's weird.

02:01:07.082 --> 02:01:12.367
Sense of like how many of these, I have a result in the literature I think is, I would hope is true.

02:01:12.888 --> 02:01:20.375
I can go check the journal or the literature and they'll give me a report back of how often it's been tested for replication, how often it's been replicated.

02:01:20.575 --> 02:01:24.119
So you can fund, can you establish the American Replication Review?

02:01:24.139 --> 02:01:25.800
Yeah, we'll think about it.

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.523
And if this is in every medical library across the country.

02:01:28.843 --> 02:01:38.371
Yeah, and we'll make it searchable using these new AI methods that allow us to pull together what the literature is actually saying.

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:43.755
It's a huge search engine, is what it turned out to be.

02:01:43.795 --> 02:01:52.923
And then third, and this is probably the most important, when scientists now are approached by somebody who wants to replicate their result, they view it as a threat.

02:01:54.144 --> 02:02:00.767
They say, oh my gosh, they're trying to undermine my reputation by trying to check my work.

02:02:00.987 --> 02:02:04.249
But it's not a threat, it's actually... No, they never think that way.

02:02:04.349 --> 02:02:15.354
Most of the time they do things like what Max Delbruck did, was that they host a workshop every year to teach everybody what they're doing so that people do replicate it, so that people do use their methods.

02:02:16.516 --> 02:02:22.921
That's why you do a postdoc, is you're going to study with somebody so that you can build on and replicate their work.

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:28.186
This is another just absolute jackassery mythology he's laying down here.

02:02:29.146 --> 02:02:30.327
This is just wrong.

02:02:31.208 --> 02:02:32.009
It's wrong.

02:02:32.289 --> 02:02:34.331
This is not how science is done.

02:02:34.351 --> 02:02:37.013
This is not how academics behave.

02:02:37.573 --> 02:02:38.754
This is bullshit.

02:02:39.255 --> 02:02:40.596
This is extraordinary.

02:02:41.727 --> 02:02:42.267
in honor.

02:02:42.868 --> 02:02:47.110
You have an idea that is worthy of some other scientist checking you.

02:02:47.650 --> 02:02:53.193
That's a mark of honor for you because you're making a claim that's important for science.

02:02:53.413 --> 02:02:55.935
This is not how this works.

02:02:56.055 --> 02:02:59.477
Understand that science is much more about methodology.

02:03:00.492 --> 02:03:05.656
That's what molecular biology is all about, doing it the best way, getting the high fidelity results.

02:03:05.716 --> 02:03:07.098
That's what neuroscience is about.

02:03:07.138 --> 02:03:08.779
That's what all science is about.

02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:11.922
It's about new methodologies and using them correctly.

02:03:12.322 --> 02:03:13.783
That's what drives science.

02:03:16.686 --> 02:03:27.835
And to think that it's any other way, it just means that you've never done science because at some point when you do science, you're going to have to choose a set of methodological tools and then become a master in them.

02:03:29.252 --> 02:03:30.233
Otherwise, what are you going to do?

02:03:30.293 --> 02:03:37.960
Just send out little, little, do little samples using, using, I don't know, a seroprevalence test and then claim you're doing science.

02:03:39.522 --> 02:03:41.584
Ah, now you see it.

02:03:42.364 --> 02:03:43.966
He didn't do any science.

02:03:44.446 --> 02:03:50.232
He got $5,000 to do a survey that included a blood test.

02:03:51.294 --> 02:03:53.215
And then he's pretending he did science.

02:03:53.255 --> 02:03:55.995
There's no methodology that he's developed.

02:03:56.376 --> 02:04:09.820
He hasn't become a master of anything like electrophysiology or biophysics at the cellular level or measuring individual ion channels, which are all skills that I built over a 20-year career of being a biologist.

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:17.822
And therefore, I have a skill set that I can apply to a whole plethora of questions in a whole plethora of experimental models.

02:04:18.262 --> 02:04:19.583
That's how science works.

02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:32.931
It's not some MD-PhD economist buying a bunch of seroprevalence tests that are really just proprietary versions of a pregnancy test and then going out and asking everybody to give a sample.

02:04:33.812 --> 02:04:34.993
That's not science.

02:04:36.254 --> 02:04:38.877
That's bullshittery and performance art.

02:04:39.997 --> 02:04:54.643
for a national security operation that ultimately put him in control of, or as a puppet, as a dude in a mouse suit in front of what now is the NIH slash frickin...

02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:57.960
Chuck E. Cheese's.

02:04:58.300 --> 02:04:59.361
Look at me, for example.

02:05:00.741 --> 02:05:02.542
People have tried to copy you all the time, Peter.

02:05:02.582 --> 02:05:02.982
They just all fail.

02:05:03.002 --> 02:05:03.482
That's the problem.

02:05:03.542 --> 02:05:04.122
It's not worth it.

02:05:06.123 --> 02:05:07.123
So how do you change those?

02:05:07.143 --> 02:05:08.283
That's a mindset.

02:05:08.583 --> 02:05:09.804
Yeah, so they're what you do.

02:05:10.644 --> 02:05:12.824
So let's just talk about baseball, right?

02:05:12.884 --> 02:05:19.466
So suppose- This is not a problem that needs solving, but now he's going to give an analogy for the problem that he's going to solve.

02:05:19.746 --> 02:05:20.667
Oh my gosh.

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:24.588
Suppose that all we measured was stolen bases.

02:05:25.088 --> 02:05:25.248
Right.

02:05:25.888 --> 02:05:33.851
What you'd have is slow runners trying to steal bases all the time and get caught stealing in the hopes that they could have a few stolen bases.

02:05:34.431 --> 02:05:35.492
If that's what you get paid on.

02:05:35.612 --> 02:05:36.812
Exactly.

02:05:36.992 --> 02:05:41.274
But if you measure caught stealings and stolen bases, it'll only be the good.

02:05:42.394 --> 02:05:44.535
So the people who are really fast, they'll try to steal bases.

02:05:44.835 --> 02:05:45.115
Got it.

02:05:46.536 --> 02:05:52.238
I guess this guy is not a threat to my reigning king as the king of analogies.

02:05:52.358 --> 02:05:54.038
This guy is not a threat at all.

02:05:54.098 --> 02:05:55.239
What is this shit?

02:05:56.019 --> 02:05:56.740
Yikes.

02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:02.185
Right now, the way it measures productivity for scientists are on two bases.

02:06:02.765 --> 02:06:07.149
How many papers you've published and how many citations you got to the papers you published.

02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:15.156
If you think about they are, it's like how much volume of science do you produce and how much influence do you have in the scientific community.

02:06:15.236 --> 02:06:20.121
So to put it crudely, that's rewarding pure self-promotion.

02:06:22.755 --> 02:06:29.540
I mean, it does produce some... No, because those metrics don't include the times when you cite your own paper, dumbass.

02:06:31.602 --> 02:06:41.450
This is an H-factor discussion, and H-factor is a pretty interesting metric of your contributions to science, and my H-factor wipes the floor with anybody on that map.

02:06:42.511 --> 02:06:45.354
Compare my H-factor to somebody like Jessica Rose.

02:06:45.414 --> 02:06:48.116
Compare my H-factor to somebody like Kevin McCairn.

02:06:50.683 --> 02:06:57.990
Scientists are excellent, they produce real work that advances, but it doesn't aim the incentives in the right direction.

02:06:58.270 --> 02:07:07.339
So if you measure pro-social behavior, like if you approach me to do replication, replicate my work, and I share my data with you.

02:07:08.119 --> 02:07:09.660
You should get credit for that.

02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:13.301
There should be like a, okay, I've hit a home run, right?

02:07:14.801 --> 02:07:16.242
Do you see what he's laying down here?

02:07:16.302 --> 02:07:25.405
He's laying down a social credit system for peer review, a social credit system for scientific publication.

02:07:25.565 --> 02:07:32.187
It sounds very much like he's laying the ideological framework for maybe, I don't know, some kind of

02:07:34.808 --> 02:07:39.230
blockchain monitoring of scientific progress?

02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:40.950
Interesting.

02:07:41.891 --> 02:07:44.612
Is my work being approached for application at all?

02:07:44.652 --> 02:07:45.212
That's an honor.

02:07:45.492 --> 02:07:46.152
Let's measure that.

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:49.673
Is my work actually replicated?

02:07:49.893 --> 02:07:51.914
That's another thing we potentially could measure.

02:07:51.954 --> 02:07:55.455
He is on a script provided by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

02:07:55.635 --> 02:07:57.076
I have no doubt in my mind.

02:07:57.136 --> 02:08:02.378
Now that he's talking like this, this is exactly what I predicted 10 minutes ago.

02:08:03.098 --> 02:08:09.280
This is the blockchain peer-review solution that Kevin McKernan has been parading around.

02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:10.600
This is it.

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:12.341
You can see it very clearly.

02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:14.901
He's reading a script from Robert Malone and McKernan.

02:08:14.961 --> 02:08:15.662
We were right.

02:08:16.002 --> 02:08:17.342
100% right.

02:08:18.422 --> 02:08:20.243
If you make measures like that,

02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:25.821
And you reward that kind of pro-social behavior, you'll get it.

02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:26.823
You reward the effort.

02:08:27.404 --> 02:08:32.494
You reward the scientists who have the courage to take on hard problems and conduct experiments.

02:08:33.619 --> 02:08:36.442
We're going to use blockchain to determine who gets funding.

02:08:36.482 --> 02:08:37.203
You're going to see it.

02:08:37.383 --> 02:08:38.984
It's going to be awesome.

02:08:39.024 --> 02:08:43.569
Even if it's wrong, that's the other flip side.

02:08:43.829 --> 02:08:47.592
I assume you're going to ask me about innovation because that's the flip side.

02:08:48.513 --> 02:08:53.358
It's common in Silicon Valley for people to start a company that fails.

02:08:53.618 --> 02:08:55.800
Failure is rewarded in Silicon Valley.

02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:58.583
That is the key to the success of Silicon Valley, right?

02:08:58.683 --> 02:09:01.546
We punish failure too much in science.

02:09:02.047 --> 02:09:04.109
The flip side of the replication problem.

02:09:04.349 --> 02:09:06.051
Okay, so let's go on and talk about this.

02:09:06.912 --> 02:09:13.619
Here's another of your big three initiatives, as I understand it, is keeping NIH right at the scientific frontier.

02:09:14.502 --> 02:09:19.566
from a May, 2023 paper by Paula Steven and Chiara Franzoni to whom I apologize.

02:09:19.626 --> 02:09:27.692
I mean, that first paper that he published as Housatonic has dropped in the chat a couple of times, it's $5,000.

02:09:27.733 --> 02:09:37.280
We need to find out where that came from and whether or not it's associated with Robert Malone or any of his associates, because that paper was promoted by his associates as it was released.

02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:41.784
And this guy asked me to not talk about Robert Malone anymore.

02:09:42.404 --> 02:09:46.687
three times in person in 2020, three.

02:09:49.489 --> 02:09:52.331
Please tell me someone in America is hearing me.

02:09:52.431 --> 02:09:56.354
And I don't care if you vote left or right or center or don't vote at all.

02:09:56.835 --> 02:10:01.338
Please just tell me you hear me and you understand that we are in a very malevolent trap.

02:10:01.358 --> 02:10:02.959
I'm sure I mispronounced both names.

02:10:03.499 --> 02:10:06.462
For the building a better NIH project, quote,

02:10:07.302 --> 02:10:14.707
A number of scientists have expressed concern that the National Institutes of Health is risk averse and becoming increasingly so.

02:10:15.328 --> 02:10:23.593
Some think the heavy emphasis placed on demonstrating feasibility of the proposed research is responsible for the risk aversion.

02:10:24.374 --> 02:10:30.898
More generally, there is the perception that the probability of success plays an important role in the evaluation process."

02:10:31.039 --> 02:10:31.879
Close quote.

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:32.640
OK.

02:10:33.962 --> 02:10:44.769
So in other words, as the American public has gotten sicker and sicker, we'll come to that increase in chronic disease, NIH has become more and more risk averse.

02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:49.873
People only put studies forward for funding that they're pretty sure will work.

02:10:52.234 --> 02:10:53.155
So what are you going to do about that?

02:10:53.655 --> 02:10:53.836
Right.

02:10:53.876 --> 02:10:57.158
So that's going to take a culture change in science.

02:11:00.243 --> 02:11:01.403
There's some concrete things you can do.

02:11:01.443 --> 02:11:03.985
So for instance, you mentioned how we evaluate grants, right?

02:11:04.025 --> 02:11:26.361
So in the 2000 teens, the NIH would have... Don't forget that one of the CV bullet points that Robert Malone regularly put out during his coming out parties on the internet for COVID was that he was responsible for like $50 billion in grant funding because he sits on all of these grant review committees.

02:11:28.436 --> 02:11:32.040
as a requirement to evaluate grants, you had to have an active grant.

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.242
Now you say to yourself, oh, well, why not?

02:11:34.262 --> 02:11:35.923
You have people with lots of expertise.

02:11:35.943 --> 02:11:37.705
You have to demonstrate expertise to evaluate grants.

02:11:38.045 --> 02:11:50.958
If you think about it, what that does is it makes people who have a vested interest in the current way of thinking into the position for deciding whether challenges to that way of thinking will be funded or not.

02:11:52.372 --> 02:11:53.173
make you no sense.

02:11:53.873 --> 02:11:57.857
What you want is regular turnover in ideas in science.

02:11:58.037 --> 02:11:59.398
Most of the ideas are going to be wrong.

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:00.199
Science is hard.

02:12:00.699 --> 02:12:12.910
But if you don't have that regular turnover and the ability for early career investigators with bright new ideas to try their ideas out early, try their ideas out at all, you're not going to make progress in science.

02:12:13.450 --> 02:12:14.530
Jay, I'm very struck.

02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:22.853
You and I both live, in some ways, neither you nor I, well, neither you nor I is a venture capitalist, but we both live surrounded by Silicon Valley.

02:12:23.213 --> 02:12:26.994
And your comparison to Silicon Valley a moment ago, I found very striking.

02:12:27.814 --> 02:12:30.535
So in the valley right now, what's happening is AI.

02:12:32.202 --> 02:12:35.665
And we have a new crop of Stanford students graduating.

02:12:35.765 --> 02:12:37.606
You and I both have friends among the students.

02:12:37.646 --> 02:12:39.087
We live and work among these kids.

02:12:40.028 --> 02:12:47.833
And I'm struck at how astonishingly easy it is for some bright kid to get a degree in computer science.

02:12:48.274 --> 02:12:55.179
If you've got a doctorate in computer science and an idea, you can get $100,000 like that from a VC firm.

02:12:55.579 --> 02:12:57.440
They're just saying, go ahead.

02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:58.021
You're smart.

02:12:59.127 --> 02:12:59.988
Take a whack at it.

02:13:00.289 --> 02:13:00.950
Give it a try.

02:13:01.230 --> 02:13:15.050
Now, that may be the wrong way to approach science, but the notion of youth constantly being funded to develop technological ways of monitoring or wasting people's time.

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:17.041
That's it.

02:13:17.982 --> 02:13:21.205
Yes, they get funded, but they don't get funded to teach people.

02:13:21.265 --> 02:13:23.267
They don't get funded to free people.

02:13:23.327 --> 02:13:25.489
They don't get funded to empower people.

02:13:26.010 --> 02:13:29.273
They get funded to monitor and enslave them.

02:13:30.714 --> 02:13:36.420
And you have to have an idea of a way to monitor people's time or occupy people's time.

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.602
And then, sure, you can get funding.

02:13:39.332 --> 02:13:47.297
Remember, funding is essentially monopoly money to begin with because banks can create it out of thin air using fractional reserve banking.

02:13:49.497 --> 02:14:08.549
In March of 2020, the biologist that would eventually figure out the biology of the pandemic was already cued in on the finances of it all, or at least aware that this illusion was happening, and a long-standing illusion that money is something that describes merit.

02:14:09.029 --> 02:14:12.791
You know, because Elon Musk is rich because he's smart.

02:14:14.672 --> 02:14:16.814
Jeff Bezos is rich because he's smart.

02:14:16.874 --> 02:14:18.955
Steve Kirsch is rich because he's smart.

02:14:31.952 --> 02:14:35.934
Jay Bhattacharya is NIH director because he's smart.

02:14:39.236 --> 02:14:46.339
Portfolios of ideas being undertaken, modest funding, but enough funding to get them, enough funding to find out an answer.

02:14:46.379 --> 02:14:47.440
Will this idea work?

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.601
If that idea works, come back to us for more money.

02:14:50.221 --> 02:14:55.104
Knowing that 90% of any investment portfolio will go belly up.

02:14:57.065 --> 02:14:57.205
So,

02:14:58.655 --> 02:15:01.916
So that's because Silicon Valley makes a lot of money that way.

02:15:01.936 --> 02:15:07.877
That's because the incentives are quite clearly set up to, how do you do that in science?

02:15:08.397 --> 02:15:15.579
I mean, just to put a fine point on what you just said, if you have a portfolio of 50 projects that you funded, and 49 of them fail utterly.

02:15:15.599 --> 02:15:16.619
No, we're talking about NIH now.

02:15:16.639 --> 02:15:19.080
I'm talking about both science and Silicon Valley.

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.661
And 49 of them failed.

02:15:20.741 --> 02:15:21.501
It's weird, right?

02:15:21.541 --> 02:15:33.968
Because how do they fail when Kevin McKernan went on the Danny Jones podcast and said that, you know, most scientific grants are already done when they're submitted because they have to be, otherwise they wouldn't get funded.

02:15:34.828 --> 02:15:40.455
Wow, that's weird because he's saying that most of the grants fail.

02:15:41.136 --> 02:15:46.281
Like, but if they already were done before they were funded, then how could they fail?

02:15:46.802 --> 02:15:51.688
It's really like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, but he's just reading a bullshit script.

02:15:53.012 --> 02:15:55.973
from the 50th Cures Type 2 Diabetes.

02:15:56.373 --> 02:15:57.534
That's a successful portfolio.

02:15:57.554 --> 02:15:58.934
You've done something for humanity.

02:15:59.054 --> 02:15:59.274
Yes.

02:15:59.294 --> 02:16:01.315
I don't care that the 49 projects failed.

02:16:02.216 --> 02:16:03.536
They were ex ante good ideas.

02:16:03.556 --> 02:16:05.237
In fact, congratulations to them for trying.

02:16:05.397 --> 02:16:05.857
Exactly.

02:16:06.917 --> 02:16:08.298
They will have learned something.

02:16:08.338 --> 02:16:08.538
Yeah.

02:16:08.618 --> 02:16:14.680
Right now what happens is the evaluation of grants, you have to demonstrate with preliminary data.

02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:20.903
If you're going to get a big investment from the NIH, you have to demonstrate preliminary data that the idea that you're proposing is likely to work.

02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:23.821
How do you do that in advance before you actually do the work?

02:16:24.902 --> 02:16:32.508
They do it with previous grant money and institutional funds and foundation money.

02:16:32.948 --> 02:16:35.751
They scrounge it together with their startup funds.

02:16:36.653 --> 02:16:40.635
This guy has no idea what he's talking about because he's never tried to do it.

02:16:41.395 --> 02:16:41.675
I did.

02:16:42.156 --> 02:16:44.257
I was trying to do it at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:16:44.537 --> 02:16:46.358
I was working on my own R01 grant.

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:49.219
I was trying to get the attention of the faculty to give my own room.

02:16:49.739 --> 02:16:54.622
I got almost a half a million dollars of free equipment by asking people for it.

02:16:55.062 --> 02:16:59.544
After I had bought all of this equipment with lots of grants around the world, they gave it to me.

02:17:00.663 --> 02:17:02.684
Yes, me, at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:17:02.744 --> 02:17:06.785
All they would have had to do was just give me an extra room and a student and I would have never been here.

02:17:08.405 --> 02:17:09.605
They really blew it with me.

02:17:10.186 --> 02:17:11.366
They really blew it with me.

02:17:11.386 --> 02:17:24.910
So what happens is scientists, and this is something I learned as part of the grantsmanship tools of becoming a successful scientist, do some- The grantsmanship tools of becoming a successful scientist.

02:17:25.710 --> 02:17:26.770
Holy shit.

02:17:27.310 --> 02:17:29.211
This guy is such an imposter.

02:17:33.942 --> 02:17:40.621
He is such an imposter, it makes me ill to think that I took pictures with him and thought that he was going to help me at some point.

02:17:40.982 --> 02:17:41.223
Work.

02:17:43.271 --> 02:17:44.672
that you know that ends up working.

02:17:44.732 --> 02:17:45.312
How did that happen?

02:17:45.532 --> 02:17:46.953
Then propose to do that work.

02:17:47.253 --> 02:17:49.154
Get the funding support for that proposed work.

02:17:49.174 --> 02:17:50.855
Hey, there's somebody in the chat over there.

02:17:50.956 --> 02:17:51.616
Nice to see you.

02:17:51.696 --> 02:17:54.458
And then try to work on the next project with the funding you get.

02:17:55.338 --> 02:18:04.003
It's fundamentally a system designed to reward incremental progress at best.

02:18:05.264 --> 02:18:08.186
Its aim is to say, look, all 50 projects I funded worked.

02:18:09.369 --> 02:18:11.050
and therefore it's a successful portfolio.

02:18:11.391 --> 02:18:15.654
But a portfolio where all 50 projects you funded work... How do they work?

02:18:15.734 --> 02:18:17.976
Because they find a significant p-value.

02:18:18.036 --> 02:18:24.420
You see, this broken science student doesn't seem to get it, or he's purposefully obfuscating the simple truth.

02:18:25.021 --> 02:18:33.387
That the way that we do science, with null hypotheses that are bullshit to begin with, is the fundamental failure.

02:18:33.467 --> 02:18:35.329
And it's not all science.

02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:36.810
It's just an awful lot of it.

02:18:37.958 --> 02:18:41.340
is not a successful portfolio, even though every single project worked.

02:18:42.661 --> 02:18:51.886
It's a failed portfolio in the sense that you ex ante didn't take sufficient, you were too risk averse in what you invested in.

02:18:52.526 --> 02:18:56.028
And so you have to have a tolerance for failure.

02:18:56.048 --> 02:19:05.213
And for young scientists, contrary to Silicon Valley, where you said, like you said, young, early career people can get investments early to test their ideas out.

02:19:06.113 --> 02:19:11.054
In biomedical sciences, it is commonplace for a researcher to be.

02:19:11.154 --> 02:19:21.956
It is not possible for someone to wander into a biology department, do a PhD, and in four years have sufficient understanding in order to develop their own research line.

02:19:22.036 --> 02:19:23.217
That is not possible.

02:19:23.297 --> 02:19:24.157
It never happens.

02:19:24.637 --> 02:19:30.778
Nobody comes into a grad school saying, I've got a list of questions that I want to ask because I've been reading since I was four.

02:19:31.798 --> 02:19:34.499
You inevitably must apprentice.

02:19:35.404 --> 02:19:46.850
you might have an interest, you might have a general idea that you'd rather study the brain as opposed to the GI tract, but that does not fundamentally change you need to apprentice.

02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:55.695
So now he's gonna say, we should end the apprentice system and just give people their own money to buy whatever shit they want and teach themselves whatever they need to learn.

02:19:56.616 --> 02:20:01.340
in their mid-40s before they can have any chance of getting a large NIH grant.

02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.042
You have mid-40s?

02:20:04.662 --> 02:20:08.025
How about the beginning of my 50s, you asshole?

02:20:08.986 --> 02:20:10.587
He knows me.

02:20:11.668 --> 02:20:18.133
He knows that I got fired from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine after working with a Nobel Prize winner a few years earlier.

02:20:18.674 --> 02:20:23.398
He knows that I got fired by CHD after working with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

02:20:23.458 --> 02:20:24.999
for a whole year earlier than that.

02:20:27.102 --> 02:20:33.926
And he just ignores me and my family because he's exactly where he's supposed to be from the moment he was recruited to do the Santa Clara study.

02:20:35.427 --> 02:20:45.052
Postdoc after postdoc after postdoc, where you're essentially doing the bidding of a senior scientist for a decade or more of your youth.

02:20:45.092 --> 02:20:46.633
It wasn't always like this.

02:20:46.873 --> 02:20:48.114
It's an apprenticeship.

02:20:48.174 --> 02:20:49.235
That's how it works.

02:20:49.994 --> 02:20:57.417
You think you can just go to tech school and then get out and start making knives and sell them for $3,000 each because you're a custom knife maker?

02:20:57.817 --> 02:20:59.138
That's not how this works.

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:03.720
This is just a guy who doesn't, any clue what he's talking about.

02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:05.661
Just talking bullshit right now.

02:21:06.121 --> 02:21:08.022
I'm sorry, but this is, again, I'm just being the layman.

02:21:08.762 --> 02:21:10.262
That sounds like a medieval guild.

02:21:11.023 --> 02:21:15.405
That sounds like a closed shop protecting itself.

02:21:15.585 --> 02:21:17.486
I'm sorry to say, protecting itself.

02:21:20.243 --> 02:21:20.743
It's broken.

02:21:21.183 --> 02:21:22.044
And I want to fix it.

02:21:22.064 --> 02:21:24.204
And people have recognized this is broken for a long time.

02:21:24.244 --> 02:21:29.386
But I think the NIH- There have to be all kinds of good people within the system who, in some sense, know better.

02:21:29.506 --> 02:21:29.786
Yeah.

02:21:30.106 --> 02:21:31.767
I mean, but again, the incentives are set up.

02:21:32.327 --> 02:21:34.867
And they take really good care of their postdocs.

02:21:34.928 --> 02:21:36.888
And they pay their postdocs really well.

02:21:36.968 --> 02:21:39.689
And they fight for their postdocs to get extra space.

02:21:39.729 --> 02:21:45.631
Yes, there are a lot of faculty members who take very good care of their apprentices.

02:21:45.811 --> 02:21:47.311
It doesn't look like it on paper.

02:21:47.351 --> 02:21:49.472
They can't pay them as much as they would like to.

02:21:50.714 --> 02:21:53.014
But it's not what they're saying here.

02:21:54.175 --> 02:21:55.335
It's a terrible system.

02:21:55.475 --> 02:21:56.675
It doesn't work very well.

02:21:56.835 --> 02:21:59.076
People need to be paid more at the lower levels.

02:21:59.516 --> 02:22:02.416
But the way that they train people is not wrong.

02:22:05.017 --> 02:22:06.117
What they fund is wrong.

02:22:06.717 --> 02:22:09.518
How much money they spend on bad null hypotheses.

02:22:09.558 --> 02:22:10.718
Yes, that's all wrong.

02:22:11.718 --> 02:22:16.459
But he's not really describing the problem in an honest way.

02:22:16.559 --> 02:22:19.760
He's characterizing it very, very ineptly.

02:22:21.809 --> 02:22:27.113
to reward a successful project rather than to reward successful portfolios.

02:22:27.213 --> 02:22:32.618
It's set up to create a vast, you know, sort of high.

02:22:32.638 --> 02:22:37.762
And so if you don't understand project and portfolio in this context, I guess he's just talking over your head.

02:22:37.982 --> 02:22:40.044
I mean, come on, this is just jackassery.

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:45.568
Hierarchies where people at the bottom of the hierarchy are feeding into your ideas rather than

02:22:45.748 --> 02:22:47.349
I need to get lunch, ladies and gentlemen.

02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:49.810
Don't forget that your consciousness is prime real estate.

02:22:49.850 --> 02:22:57.333
If you let people like Jay Bhattacharya determine what you're thinking about and really think that he's saying something profound, you are already enslaved.

02:22:57.393 --> 02:23:08.758
Get off of Rumble, get off of X, get off of these more perverted places where you have no idea who you're talking to, like Telegram and Signal, big Signal chats.

02:23:09.218 --> 02:23:10.259
Just get rid of all of it.

02:23:11.087 --> 02:23:13.508
You know, you can send emails to me and your family and friends.

02:23:13.588 --> 02:23:14.208
It works great.

02:23:14.608 --> 02:23:18.209
Ladies and gentlemen, bad biology is the trap that we're in.

02:23:18.289 --> 02:23:20.830
Evolution because DNA is the central lie.

02:23:21.730 --> 02:23:25.251
Endemicity is one of these myths that based on that lie.

02:23:25.911 --> 02:23:27.012
It's for all the marbles.

02:23:27.052 --> 02:23:30.013
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

02:23:30.033 --> 02:23:37.695
If you want to see through it, understand there's an irreducible complex background composed of genetic signals that come from bacteria and the phages they produce.

02:23:38.155 --> 02:23:50.205
And that irreducibly complex background could have been distorted as a novel spread simply using a nonspecific set of PCR tests, which they most certainly used and put out over 200 of them in the USA alone.

02:23:50.225 --> 02:23:52.767
200 EUA tests all off the market now.

02:23:53.167 --> 02:23:58.031
And if you use their tests to find their ghosts, you weren't finding real ghosts and you were never a ghostbuster.

02:23:58.512 --> 02:24:00.133
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being here.

02:24:00.173 --> 02:24:02.014
Intramuscular injection is still dumb.

02:24:02.575 --> 02:24:07.219
RNA still can't pandemic and transfecting heavy people is still a crime because

02:24:07.719 --> 02:24:09.541
The population pyramids are real.

02:24:09.601 --> 02:24:10.322
Thanks for being here.

02:24:10.342 --> 02:24:11.604
I hope you have a great weekend.

02:24:11.784 --> 02:24:14.287
I don't think I'm streaming this weekend, but you never know.

02:24:14.808 --> 02:24:18.873
There might be a surprise and otherwise I'll be back on Monday for another thunderous week.

02:24:19.874 --> 02:24:22.477
And maybe some Biology 101 finally again.

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:28.202
I think I kind of pounded this nail deep enough into the wall.

02:24:28.522 --> 02:24:30.383
I don't know if it's going to come back out or not though.

02:24:30.743 --> 02:24:31.723
That's what keeps happening.

02:24:32.224 --> 02:24:39.147
The nails, I'm pounding all the nails into the deck on one side and then I walk over to the other side of the deck and all those nails are out again.

02:24:39.667 --> 02:24:50.132
And so as long as this show of traders who I have a personal relationship with, and incidentally a personal vendetta with many of them, this show's never going away.

02:24:51.733 --> 02:24:54.799
I hope your family is well.

02:24:54.839 --> 02:24:56.041
I hope you have a great weekend.

02:24:56.061 --> 02:24:59.908
And I hope you stay off of social media as much as possible.

02:25:00.329 --> 02:25:01.091
Thanks for being here.

02:25:02.012 --> 02:25:02.894
Love you all very much.

02:25:03.315 --> 02:25:03.695
See you soon.

02:25:17.197 --> 02:25:25.704
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate the disease.

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:34.251
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.
