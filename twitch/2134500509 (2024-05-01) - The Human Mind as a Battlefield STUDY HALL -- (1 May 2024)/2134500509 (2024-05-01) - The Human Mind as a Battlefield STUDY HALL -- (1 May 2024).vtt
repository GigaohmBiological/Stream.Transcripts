WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.320
.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.320
That's one, too.

00:46.720 --> 00:52.000
Sorry I'm late, ladies and gentlemen, we're getting right started. I'm gonna do just a very brief introduction

00:54.240 --> 00:56.240
and then we're gonna go

00:58.320 --> 01:00.320
I

01:29.080 --> 01:51.120
Yes, Mark is putting out some absolutely fantastic content lately. It's just reading

01:51.680 --> 01:59.480
It's just research really actually anyone, you know could have done if they just maybe paid a subscription to newspapers.com and

02:00.120 --> 02:03.400
Did the right searches? But

02:04.520 --> 02:06.520
Mark is in the batting cage

02:08.880 --> 02:13.160
Yeah, taking the covers off that's all I got to say mark is in the batting cage

02:13.800 --> 02:15.600
Yeah, I

02:17.600 --> 02:21.700
Don't know what to say if mark if Doc Malick is booting you off his sub stack

02:21.700 --> 02:26.520
It's exactly where you want to be. I think there's there's not much else to say there. I'm not gonna

02:27.080 --> 02:33.320
I'm not gonna do any of that bull in a china shop stuff anymore. I'm gonna let the biology speak for itself

02:33.320 --> 02:35.320
I think we we are really

02:35.320 --> 02:41.200
If this is you know, we're doing very very well

02:41.200 --> 02:43.560
We're about to drop some people on their faces

02:43.880 --> 02:50.440
And so it's not a question of if it's just a question of when and so I think if we just move cautiously and

02:51.360 --> 02:53.560
Keep our feet firmly underneath us

02:54.680 --> 03:00.700
Don't don't get off balance in any way. I think everything is gonna be just fine in the next couple months

03:00.700 --> 03:02.700
We're gonna make some serious

03:02.700 --> 03:07.400
Serious progress. Don't forget. I'm on the website of the red pill Expo at this stage

03:08.940 --> 03:13.460
listed on the same list of speakers as Mickey Willis and and

03:14.940 --> 03:15.980
and

03:15.980 --> 03:17.980
Andrew Kaufman

03:18.100 --> 03:20.100
think about the

03:20.180 --> 03:22.180
extreme irony of that

03:22.180 --> 03:24.180
the extreme I

03:25.060 --> 03:26.820
don't know

03:26.820 --> 03:32.300
craziness that in four years plus of trying to push this stuff out that

03:32.700 --> 03:40.900
Yeah, that's that's where we are. Anyway, 28 people watching. Thank you very much for being here. Let's get started

04:02.700 --> 04:29.780
The latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario

04:32.860 --> 04:34.860
I think that's a really

04:35.220 --> 04:42.140
Excellent idea Jeff. We've been I have been trying to come up with something that fits that for a while

04:42.500 --> 04:49.900
And I've got a couple things in the works as far as a PDF goes lots of people have taken a crack at that but

04:50.820 --> 04:58.660
the PDF from GIGO and biological and the past couple weeks three weeks four weeks of work that Mark and I have been doing

04:59.500 --> 05:07.300
And I don't mean it in any other way than to saying that I'm just really happy to be in this fight together with Mark and with Jessica

05:07.300 --> 05:10.720
and with Nick Hudson and with Jonathan Hengler and

05:11.540 --> 05:13.540
Wolfgang Wodach and

05:13.780 --> 05:15.780
Mike Eden

05:15.980 --> 05:20.780
The list of people that we that we consider part of our little team

05:21.460 --> 05:25.180
Has now really it's it's a very very

05:25.940 --> 05:30.620
Solid list of people who understand the argument we're making we're so busy lying

05:30.620 --> 05:37.940
We don't even recognize the truth no more than society. We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

05:40.140 --> 05:44.460
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

05:45.740 --> 05:50.700
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar

05:50.700 --> 05:54.980
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important

05:55.180 --> 05:57.180
Not to be a liar

06:17.580 --> 06:19.980
I hope you mean you have to mute that part with

06:20.820 --> 06:22.820
With Tucker

06:23.060 --> 06:27.200
Because I love that dude one that that that thing really rings well with me

06:27.780 --> 06:34.940
Have the harkonans telling you and I think it's just really a sort of scientific discipline from what I understand

06:50.140 --> 06:54.580
It's Tucker's admission. It's not his whining. It's it is admission

06:55.540 --> 06:59.460
There's no clearer way to say that you're a liar by saying that you're a liar

07:01.860 --> 07:07.260
How much more succinctly could one say it than five times repeating that I'm a liar

07:07.260 --> 07:11.540
I don't want to be but I am it's perfect. It's absolutely perfect

07:12.380 --> 07:21.220
Hey, I got to push this button over here in order for this to work

07:31.980 --> 07:39.820
Okay, so we are gonna we are gonna try and truncate this a little bit because the idea again is to

07:41.540 --> 07:46.960
Well dispel this enchantment, and so I think repetitive repeating

07:48.100 --> 07:52.340
Repeating messages are actually very important for the people who come for the first time

07:52.340 --> 07:58.340
I know it's kind of annoying if I show up late and then I also have to run

07:59.300 --> 08:01.700
45 slides or or whatever this is

08:02.780 --> 08:05.100
But but these messages are important

08:06.060 --> 08:13.820
Because we've been consistently putting these messages out with these people's faces underlying them for almost

08:14.460 --> 08:16.460
four and a half four years now

08:17.580 --> 08:23.780
And to think that in all that time a message so succinct and so clear a

08:25.220 --> 08:28.580
message so patriotic and and and

08:29.380 --> 08:34.860
Focused on the truth could have been lost in the noise that they created

08:38.300 --> 08:42.100
Like lost in the noise that these people created

08:42.980 --> 08:43.820
and

08:43.820 --> 08:50.900
The noise is of course all to disguise this plan that's been in the works for a very long time to invert our sovereignty

08:51.620 --> 08:53.460
into experimental

08:53.460 --> 08:59.620
Animal status so that they can feed our biological data into the as yet

09:00.300 --> 09:02.300
non-existing AI that will

09:02.300 --> 09:06.220
that will solve all of humanity's problems and so the

09:06.900 --> 09:15.100
the show on on social media featuring a eyes latest greatest achievements in art and in

09:15.540 --> 09:18.620
in language and and cliff notes

09:19.580 --> 09:22.260
Is part of this illusion?

09:23.460 --> 09:30.020
And as hard as it is for a lot of people to accept it is one hundred percent in illusion

09:33.020 --> 09:38.500
And the illusion goes back a few decades because this illusion of

09:39.260 --> 09:41.260
understanding of high fidelity

09:42.060 --> 09:48.820
Understanding of the biology that underlies health and disease this mythology has been building

09:49.140 --> 09:56.140
For decades and unfortunately our parents were completely under its spell and more importantly

09:56.140 --> 09:58.140
they were under its spell because

09:58.660 --> 10:06.100
It wasn't it wasn't used against them in the same way that it has been used against us in the overt

10:07.820 --> 10:14.220
Malevolent way that it's been used against us in our lifetime in the form of the childhood vaccine schedule

10:14.220 --> 10:18.020
And in our lifetimes in the form of pandemics

10:19.820 --> 10:23.300
But once we gave power to the charlatans

10:23.500 --> 10:30.020
It's very difficult to get it back, especially if we inherited it this way and we did we have to admit

10:30.020 --> 10:33.540
I'm 52 years old. We inherited the world

10:34.100 --> 10:39.500
where these charlatans and their mythology was the prevailing narrative and

10:40.300 --> 10:43.540
There are people who have tried to fight against it

10:44.020 --> 10:51.260
There are people who have have touched part of this elephant and and paid the the the highest price

10:52.220 --> 10:58.980
And then there are people who claim to be patriots and who actually are part of the

10:59.580 --> 11:05.700
controlled demolition of America, and I don't think that's a message that you can repeat too often because

11:06.060 --> 11:09.580
You know, it's gonna take my kids of being aware of it

11:09.580 --> 11:15.340
It's gonna take more college kids than are aware of it right now in order to turn this cruise ship around

11:17.820 --> 11:23.740
We're gonna need some adults to be able to play the role of teacher and mentor

11:26.380 --> 11:33.780
And and and keep people away from social media keep people away from the nightly news and keep people away from the

11:34.420 --> 11:35.820
PBS news

11:35.820 --> 11:37.820
history of America and

11:37.980 --> 11:41.320
Point people back in the way of the truth

11:42.020 --> 11:46.900
What American history really is what the American economy really is what what?

11:47.500 --> 11:54.060
fractional reserve banking really is as far as as a possible weaponized source of control

11:55.460 --> 12:01.060
And why Jeffrey Epstein and stories of Jeffrey Epstein's Island might be used to obscure

12:01.420 --> 12:04.660
The power of weaponized piles of money

12:05.340 --> 12:10.700
Like the Vatican for example one of the oldest and probably largest weaponized piles of money

12:11.980 --> 12:14.660
Let's stay focused on the biology for now though

12:15.620 --> 12:20.100
And let's not take their bait on social media that includes crazy sub stacks

12:21.220 --> 12:23.220
And let's love our neighbors

12:25.300 --> 12:32.260
And let's share this stream if you don't mind and if you've got the means and you're sitting at home with more money

12:32.340 --> 12:34.340
Then you know what to do with

12:34.340 --> 12:37.980
Feel free, you know, if you've already subscribed to Twitter

12:38.300 --> 12:42.820
If you've already you're paying for people's sub stack within by all means, please

12:43.780 --> 12:51.060
Go to gig ome biological and see if you can also support this work because I think it's one of the few places where you can get

12:51.740 --> 12:58.860
An objective look at the fifth generation warfare that's being waged upon us and our children

12:59.860 --> 13:08.540
One place where people are gonna call it like it is fifth generation warfare is the coordinated lying

13:09.300 --> 13:11.140
to the populace

13:11.140 --> 13:16.140
Let's say that again. The fifth generation warfare that you need to be afraid of is

13:18.100 --> 13:24.260
Coordinated lying and that's what we have here. We have people that have coordinatedly lied to you

13:24.980 --> 13:28.340
And even faked rivalries between one another

13:29.060 --> 13:33.540
And the reason why is because you know this picture would be better

13:35.060 --> 13:41.020
This picture would actually be better testing one to this picture would actually be better if we did this

13:42.100 --> 13:47.300
This is really what we're dealing with right now, and if we don't do this

13:48.620 --> 13:51.820
We're never gonna break free. That's what I know for sure

13:54.540 --> 13:59.100
Well, you can see that I did not wash my face this morning with a cold

13:59.660 --> 14:05.080
Rag of water. I look a little shiny. Sorry about that. This this ten o'clock show

14:06.500 --> 14:09.020
Ten o'clock show is gonna take a little adjustment

14:09.700 --> 14:15.740
I'm gonna keep doing it though because it's really invigorating to have the whole afternoon to prepare for the next day to look

14:15.740 --> 14:17.740
Into things to follow up

14:17.740 --> 14:20.820
And I think this this work that we've been doing

14:21.660 --> 14:24.340
with regard to the

14:26.180 --> 14:34.380
With regard to prions and and virology and the Baltimore class of education scheme and the infectious cycle

14:34.940 --> 14:39.140
Is really paying off. I'm so excited. I'm just so excited

14:50.820 --> 14:52.820
You

15:04.500 --> 15:12.260
Now it might go to the wrong slide because I didn't change that I bet because I wasn't gonna planning to do that whole beginning

15:13.340 --> 15:15.340
Oh, no, we're good

15:15.580 --> 15:20.540
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga on biological high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists

15:20.540 --> 15:22.540
It is the first of May

15:22.780 --> 15:28.080
2024 in May of 2020. I was already suggesting that a background signal might be

15:28.540 --> 15:36.140
Misconstrued as spread and that previous immunity to previous RNA viruses was likely sufficient in that we shouldn't listen to these people

15:36.940 --> 15:38.940
And it's now

15:40.060 --> 15:45.580
21 22 23 24 it's technically four years later

15:46.940 --> 15:48.940
And although the sophisticated

15:49.940 --> 15:54.740
Biological understanding of the of the most parsimonious explanation

15:55.740 --> 16:02.340
For what has happened over the last five years almost is is in front of us now. It's five years

16:04.860 --> 16:07.660
Five years of coordinated lying

16:08.620 --> 16:11.340
has brought us to where we are today and

16:12.860 --> 16:18.700
I think it is still relevant to always start the show within traumascular injection of any combination of substances with the

16:18.940 --> 16:20.940
Antibogmenting the immune system is dumb

16:21.500 --> 16:27.340
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and thousands of biological faculty members in the United States

16:27.820 --> 16:31.020
And around the world should have done known better should have spoken up

16:31.660 --> 16:33.660
Should have waved their arms

16:33.660 --> 16:40.860
Unfortunately, there were only a few of us who did and RNA cannot pandemic is something that anyone with a PhD in biology

16:41.420 --> 16:45.740
Should be able to rub their little beard for a little while and think wow, that's a pretty clever way of

16:46.620 --> 16:49.260
Challenging my notions of what I understand

16:51.260 --> 16:56.220
And then maybe they should use PubMed and start looking into it and pull their head out

16:56.940 --> 16:57.740
It's

16:57.740 --> 16:59.740
2024

17:00.140 --> 17:06.620
Stop hiding within your own little field in your own little question your own little subunit

17:07.980 --> 17:13.980
And start asking big questions about biology because we are being enslaved by this mythology

17:14.460 --> 17:16.460
And we need your help

17:19.500 --> 17:26.780
So the hypothesis that we have if you're still with us is that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus

17:26.780 --> 17:29.740
But there was none. In fact, it was a hot background

17:30.540 --> 17:36.220
In fact, it was nonspecific PCR tests. In fact, it was probably nonspecific lateral flow tests

17:36.620 --> 17:39.980
it was probably nonspecific PCR primers that were

17:40.780 --> 17:45.900
Were hand-waved into a signal that was already there

17:47.740 --> 17:52.700
But it's a crime. We've called the police. We don't have to explain the motives of the criminal

17:52.700 --> 17:55.820
We don't have to explain the plan and unfortunately

17:56.300 --> 18:00.540
That's what we've been tricked into doing for the last four years and responding to these

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
so-called dissidents

18:03.980 --> 18:08.940
What's exactly happened then mr. Cooley? Well, you know, I don't know these people are lying about it

18:08.940 --> 18:11.500
And I think you might be coordinated lying with them

18:12.860 --> 18:14.860
That's where we are

18:15.740 --> 18:22.620
To think that governments and non-governmental organizations like the who are interested in taking over the world

18:23.500 --> 18:27.740
And yet somehow or another they wouldn't have people on both sides playing for them

18:28.700 --> 18:35.260
Like they wouldn't have enough money to plant a few people inside of I don't know some organization here or an organization there

18:35.900 --> 18:37.900
Maybe

18:38.380 --> 18:42.300
Actually inspire a few dissident movements or support a few substacks

18:43.420 --> 18:47.980
In order to make sure that their control over where this narrative went

18:48.940 --> 18:50.700
Was pretty dominant

18:50.700 --> 18:56.860
You don't think that in addition to censoring a few people on twitter and facebook that they would have actually not

18:57.100 --> 19:04.140
Propped up a few people right away from the beginning to make sure that they had people on their team in both places or all places

19:05.660 --> 19:13.180
Can we really still be that naive at this point to believe that it's just governments and it's just fauci versus rann paul

19:13.260 --> 19:18.620
It's just hekel health alliance and usad versus the people who want to tell the truth

19:18.700 --> 19:23.660
Really? Do you really believe it's just corporations trying to take advantage of a money hose

19:25.660 --> 19:31.340
It has nothing to do with the weaponized piles of money that have existed for four or five hundred years on earth

19:35.740 --> 19:40.620
Come on ladies and gentlemen, can we wake up and apologize to our children for being so naive?

19:51.180 --> 19:53.180
I don't know. I think

19:53.180 --> 19:59.020
I think this is probably going to be the wrong slide. So i'm just going to escape out of here right now assuming that it is

20:00.300 --> 20:04.700
Um, and we're just going to start this thingy mobov that i've got planned

20:06.220 --> 20:09.660
Uh, I found another video of

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
Of

20:14.060 --> 20:16.060
James Giordano

20:17.020 --> 20:19.900
And I had put it in my list

20:20.700 --> 20:23.100
Of possible study halls a long time ago

20:23.100 --> 20:26.780
I don't know when because I I edit the same document all the time as this list

20:27.660 --> 20:33.820
Um, and what's interesting is is that since I had put it in the list and it has to be since I put it in the list

20:34.700 --> 20:36.700
Um, it has become unlisted

20:37.420 --> 20:43.500
Which is interesting. So I don't know how long we've been hammering home the idea that James Giordano

20:44.140 --> 20:45.740
um

20:45.740 --> 20:52.620
Is an interesting figure because he's a forward facing public outspoken person on the internet about these

20:53.580 --> 20:55.740
Mythologies and these worst case scenarios, right?

20:55.740 --> 20:57.740
I

21:00.700 --> 21:04.140
Coffee's almost gone and it's actually still warm. So hold on one second

21:08.940 --> 21:16.220
Anything that can ruin the hour that follows it. It's cold cup of coffee. Um, so what I find interesting about it is again

21:16.300 --> 21:19.340
Was that this this si PRI?

21:20.460 --> 21:25.100
Video has been made unlisted since I found it, which is kind of interesting

21:25.180 --> 21:28.300
Um, and of course James Giordano is the guy that you know

21:28.300 --> 21:32.700
He says you just see the few cases here and there with something that makes people complain

21:33.260 --> 21:37.100
And then the rest of it you just use the internet and let all the wild

21:37.580 --> 21:42.700
Speculation about what's going on and let non specific tests do the rest of the work

21:43.420 --> 21:48.140
Let asymptomatic transmission and the rumor of it do the rest of the work

21:48.140 --> 21:54.540
That's basically the story that he told in 2017 and that everybody really wants to ignore

21:55.900 --> 21:57.900
And the only people that are

21:58.460 --> 22:03.740
Not really ignoring it are trying to twist it around and say see James Giordano admits it

22:03.740 --> 22:05.740
It's the DoD that did it

22:07.740 --> 22:14.060
One of the problems and I'll just say it very quickly one of the problems with saying the DoD did it is that the DoD doesn't do things

22:14.060 --> 22:16.060
They're not told to do

22:17.100 --> 22:22.940
The chain of command doesn't end at the DoD and no matter what anybody wants to tell you the chain of command goes far

22:22.940 --> 22:25.260
That the buck doesn't stop there so to speak

22:27.340 --> 22:33.260
And so don't be drawn in to think that the DoD solves the question or you pulled the mask off now

22:33.820 --> 22:37.580
When ditra is still there when the state department is still there when the

22:38.380 --> 22:44.460
entire department of health and human services is there to declare the emergency in the first place and the entire administrative

22:44.940 --> 22:50.060
Body of the president and everybody below including the director of national intelligence is all there

22:51.020 --> 22:54.620
Why in the world would you stop at see it's the DoD?

23:01.180 --> 23:05.260
I see that's what I had going over there. That's why that was down. Sorry about that

23:05.820 --> 23:11.020
So we're going to watch this video because I think we're probably going to find some interesting things in it and more importantly

23:11.580 --> 23:14.060
Because I think it's a nice

23:15.020 --> 23:16.380
break

23:16.380 --> 23:19.900
From the studying that we've been doing and I've been doing in the background

23:19.900 --> 23:21.260
I've actually

23:21.260 --> 23:24.140
Accomplished a lot more than what we've shown in the past

23:24.780 --> 23:28.380
Few days or weeks with regard to prions and protein folding

23:28.940 --> 23:31.020
amyloidosis and

23:31.020 --> 23:33.020
Priana genesis

23:33.340 --> 23:35.340
I've been working

23:35.340 --> 23:37.100
um, and so

23:37.100 --> 23:43.180
If there's anybody out there who's waiting for me to drop the ball on these subjects or to make a mistake that

23:43.820 --> 23:48.460
Do you think that you're going to be able to distort into CJ's gone full?

23:49.900 --> 23:51.740
Full crazy town

23:51.740 --> 23:56.860
You're going to be sorely disappointed by the end of the month of May the

23:57.980 --> 23:59.980
the illusion

24:01.100 --> 24:03.100
and the mysteries

24:03.100 --> 24:05.100
and the

24:05.100 --> 24:12.540
Sort of edge of our understanding with regard to prions and protein folding and and virology and RNA fidelity

24:13.180 --> 24:14.300
And all of this stuff

24:14.300 --> 24:18.540
I think we're going to be very close to having a pretty succinct answer to these questions

24:19.020 --> 24:21.020
In the context of what we know and don't know

24:21.500 --> 24:29.020
What people have said and not said and what is plausible in the context of other biology because that's the main issue here

24:30.060 --> 24:31.500
Is that people

24:31.500 --> 24:32.380
I don't know

24:32.380 --> 24:38.140
This is one of these rants where it just comes out of nowhere, but a lot of these people I've convinced you are convinced us

24:38.620 --> 24:42.300
To focus on other things other than the details of this biology

24:42.300 --> 24:48.940
And I'm afraid that we are right and we have been right all along when we say that the way out is biology

24:49.420 --> 24:53.340
All we have to do is just do the work that's necessary

24:53.900 --> 24:57.340
To really find out what are these people know and what don't they know

24:58.220 --> 25:02.220
We can look at their papers. We can look at what they've published. We can look at what they've said

25:03.020 --> 25:07.740
We can make little cartoons that correspond to what they've said and what they've found

25:09.100 --> 25:15.260
And if those cartoons don't tell a story that ends with you only need one pre-on

25:17.020 --> 25:24.540
If those stories that they tell don't end in see us you can design a protein to be an amyloidogenic protein

25:26.780 --> 25:28.780
If that's not true

25:30.620 --> 25:35.100
Then you will have to come to the conclusion that the people that have been pushing these stories

25:35.660 --> 25:37.420
four years

25:37.500 --> 25:40.940
in the context of covid and decades before that

25:41.820 --> 25:43.420
are medlers

25:43.420 --> 25:48.860
They are people who are involved in something else other than america

25:49.900 --> 25:51.900
and

25:51.900 --> 25:53.900
peaceful existence

25:55.180 --> 25:57.180
Because that's what all of us are involved in

25:57.740 --> 25:59.740
I'm just a very normal guy

26:00.220 --> 26:07.340
Who if possible would love to have a kind of normal job with colleagues that I wanted to high five every day

26:07.420 --> 26:09.420
I

26:10.460 --> 26:12.460
Work that I was proud of

26:14.700 --> 26:17.820
And be able to coach basketball and and and watch

26:20.140 --> 26:24.300
A show or go to a basketball game or or or

26:25.340 --> 26:28.540
Go to my daughters pianos recital but

26:29.260 --> 26:30.220
not

26:30.220 --> 26:34.940
Concerned about people dying on other planet on other continents

26:35.420 --> 26:37.420
not concerned about

26:37.420 --> 26:42.940
Stealing of thousands of or or hundreds of of billions of dollars

26:43.740 --> 26:47.020
Not worried about whether a war was real or not

26:49.340 --> 26:53.100
Not worried about whether immigration was going to destroy the futino

26:56.060 --> 27:00.380
That's me and and and yet somehow or another we are here now

27:01.340 --> 27:06.700
Where all of us are are asking these crazy questions and thinking about these crazy ideas

27:07.100 --> 27:10.780
instead of worrying about basketball practice and piano recitals

27:11.820 --> 27:13.820
and the local school board meeting

27:14.780 --> 27:16.780
And that's by design

27:17.980 --> 27:25.020
And the human mind as a battlefield is a wonderful title that accentuates what's really happening here

27:25.980 --> 27:32.540
And all we have to do is pull back and realize that this we put our heads inside of a box

27:32.540 --> 27:34.540
That's filled with this cacophony

27:35.260 --> 27:40.140
this cacophony about Ukraine and Israel and and and

27:40.620 --> 27:42.620
covid and mandates and

27:43.580 --> 27:45.580
free speech and censorship and

27:46.860 --> 27:53.980
Transhumanism and and transgender rights and all you got to do is pull your head out of that box and it'll all stop

27:55.900 --> 27:57.900
And

27:57.900 --> 28:01.580
None of those are questions that you need answers to you already have the answers

28:04.060 --> 28:06.620
Those aren't the most important questions for our day

28:09.340 --> 28:14.060
The most important questions for our day is how do we if not

28:16.140 --> 28:18.540
Make the lives of the people around us better

28:19.340 --> 28:22.300
How do we understand how

28:22.860 --> 28:29.100
To pull other people's heads out of that box and I think the way to pull other people's heads out of that box is to show them

28:29.580 --> 28:33.500
That this box has been in construction for a very very long time

28:33.900 --> 28:38.060
And remember what we did yesterday. I'm glad this flowed into my head this way

28:38.380 --> 28:44.220
Remember what we did yesterday do not forget that the title is a little deceptive when it says ransand yellow and virology

28:44.620 --> 28:46.620
It was also the spars document

28:49.020 --> 28:54.860
And the spars document is that as I characterized it yesterday this public facing brochure

28:55.500 --> 28:58.540
Of a program that has a classified part

28:59.580 --> 29:03.500
That has a closed doors part that has a lanyards only part

29:05.260 --> 29:16.860
And that part includes the population control part the reduced birth rate part the increased collection of data part the screening of babies part all of that shit

29:19.260 --> 29:20.780
And

29:20.780 --> 29:25.900
The need for maximum compliance the need for uniformed messaging

29:25.900 --> 29:31.020
The need to lie to the public in order to assure that we get to these endpoints

29:32.780 --> 29:39.980
And as the spars document lays out, it's not a plan that was a couple months where oh my gosh

29:40.060 --> 29:42.700
There's a novel virus. We've got it back to truck up

29:42.700 --> 29:44.700
And

29:44.700 --> 29:50.140
Then a few months later the alarm goes off and somebody declares all clear like Brett Weinstein zero

29:50.700 --> 29:53.020
COVID has been reached and shoots a flare

29:54.460 --> 29:58.620
The spars document outlined a decade long story

30:01.020 --> 30:06.220
And if you think of the spars document as a public facing brochure of an actual secret plan

30:06.620 --> 30:10.060
Then that secret plan would also be a decade long plan

30:10.540 --> 30:12.540
And

30:12.540 --> 30:19.100
You can think of James Giordano as a public facing salesperson for what surely has

30:19.740 --> 30:25.820
Also a secret component a lanyard only component a for your eyes only component

30:26.940 --> 30:31.420
Otherwise, how in the hell could it be that this guy is all over the internet and it's no problem for them

30:32.860 --> 30:39.980
The same reason why the spars document has been around for a few years and it's no problem for them because it's a public facing brochure

30:40.620 --> 30:42.620
for a secret plan a

30:43.260 --> 30:45.420
Back room plan

30:46.140 --> 30:50.540
Just like you know at every corporation there are discussions in the boardroom that are pretty brutal

30:51.740 --> 30:55.180
And that don't take into account the well-being of every worker or every

30:55.660 --> 30:58.060
Contractor or whatever because it's all about profit

30:58.300 --> 31:03.180
You know dang well that we are governed in that way, you know dang well that banks think that way

31:03.580 --> 31:06.780
You know dang well that private equity funds think that way

31:07.340 --> 31:13.900
They all think of us as consumers the word consumers means sheep

31:22.700 --> 31:28.380
Let's listen to this and see if we can cheer ourselves up with it because I do think that James Giordano is a wonderful speaker

31:28.700 --> 31:32.700
super energetic and he gets me really excited about the level of

31:33.500 --> 31:34.540
malevolent

31:34.540 --> 31:36.540
Bamboozlement that has been

31:37.660 --> 31:40.300
That has been unleashed upon us over these many many years

31:40.620 --> 31:45.020
And I still don't know why I left and I still don't have my damn water bottle

31:46.060 --> 31:48.460
I'm gonna have to send out a smoke signal for that

31:49.660 --> 31:54.460
I'm gonna just gonna hit play and I might speed it up. It's an hour long and it's 11

31:55.900 --> 32:00.220
And fearless not doing a class today. So technically we can just watch it. It's gonna be a long one

32:00.940 --> 32:02.940
Um, here we go

32:02.940 --> 32:04.940
I

32:04.940 --> 32:06.940
I

32:28.940 --> 32:34.860
See this thing in the chat. I just wanted to comment on it m tam fisher says universities now are private trust funds

32:35.020 --> 32:37.500
Not education centers. I want you to think about that

32:37.900 --> 32:39.900
How did those trust funds come to exist?

32:40.380 --> 32:44.380
They want you to believe it's just because they've got a lot of really rich people that

32:44.620 --> 32:48.460
Graduated from there and then decided to donate some of their money to the university

32:52.140 --> 32:57.740
Of course all of these weaponized piles of money that you are correct that these universities are

32:58.220 --> 33:00.700
Were created because the us government

33:01.660 --> 33:04.380
Subsidize them with Pell grants

33:04.940 --> 33:08.220
Subsidize them with student loans a lot of these people

33:08.700 --> 33:14.940
Like my dumb self went to a private university and got half of the tuition paid by a Pell grant

33:15.180 --> 33:17.260
And so it seemed like wow that's interesting

33:17.260 --> 33:22.300
It's basically the same amount of money as the university of wisconsin-madison. I might as well go there

33:25.020 --> 33:27.740
And now we're supposed to blame all of those kids

33:28.700 --> 33:32.300
Which I admit I'm dumb. I went there and signed a piece of paper

33:32.540 --> 33:36.780
But I also had another kid on the other side of the table that was only 24 years old

33:36.780 --> 33:41.980
That was a financial aid advisor that was telling me to sign that piece of paper because everybody's doing it

33:41.980 --> 33:49.180
And every person that signed that piece of paper was another person that was bringing in about 45 thousand dollars in that time

33:49.980 --> 33:53.340
To that university in the form of grants and loans

33:53.980 --> 33:56.140
all subsidized by the us government

33:56.780 --> 34:02.380
And now we're supposed to blame those kids for wanting a college education that they were brainwashed into believing

34:02.380 --> 34:05.740
Was their only way to climb the ladder since they were a child?

34:06.380 --> 34:09.500
Because their parents were brainwashed into giving them that information

34:10.540 --> 34:14.060
And now that system wants you to blame those kids for their student loans

34:14.060 --> 34:16.940
Even though they were told that was the only way to go forward

34:17.580 --> 34:24.540
And there were all these programs government programs to make it really easy for kids that didn't have a plan to go to that college anyway

34:25.500 --> 34:33.740
Where they're paying their deans hundreds of thousands of dollars a year where they're paying their their football coaches millions of dollars a year

34:33.740 --> 34:39.740
Their basketball coaches millions of dollars a year. But oh these giant piles of weaponized money

34:39.740 --> 34:42.860
They're all good. They're great. They're just from big donors

34:45.020 --> 34:47.420
This is the illusion that they've got us in

34:47.980 --> 34:52.940
The limited spectrum of debate. Oh, you can bitch about student loans and whether they're fair or not

34:53.500 --> 34:56.700
Or whether it's fair to pay them off for people or not

34:57.020 --> 35:04.540
And just forget about the fact that what they really did what those really represent is a giant subsidy over the past 25 or 30 years

35:04.940 --> 35:06.940
for the universities

35:08.540 --> 35:12.780
Because the the result wasn't a bunch of rich middle-class americans, right?

35:14.300 --> 35:17.980
The investment in the universities resulted in powerful universities

35:19.340 --> 35:21.500
That are now on board with this shit

35:23.340 --> 35:25.340
So

35:25.340 --> 35:28.540
Please see that student loan debate for what it is

35:29.500 --> 35:34.540
It's just a limited spectrum of debate. That's like a shouting match between two things that don't matter

35:35.740 --> 35:37.740
What we should have been saying is that wow

35:38.140 --> 35:40.780
They we let my our parents let

35:41.340 --> 35:46.540
The government and universities sucker us into this thing and sign on the dotted line

35:46.940 --> 35:51.340
When in reality it was just a race to see how many kids can we get to sign this

35:51.820 --> 35:55.100
Because the government's going to give them money and we are going to get it all

35:55.580 --> 35:58.620
So how many people can we get to sign these papers? I don't know. Let's see

35:59.100 --> 36:02.380
We've got 25 years to see how many people we can get to sign that

36:05.980 --> 36:08.940
And it's not very much different here with the biosecurity state

36:08.940 --> 36:11.900
How many years have been they working to get people to sign on to this?

36:12.220 --> 36:19.180
How many how many years have been they working to get people on board that they knew weren't going to rock the boat that accepted everything about this

36:19.180 --> 36:20.780
That we're all about it

36:20.780 --> 36:23.980
Has a way of governing people as a system of being a part of it

36:27.180 --> 36:30.540
And now you see why the university system doesn't like a guy like me

36:31.260 --> 36:34.620
Through me out never gave me tenure. I never stood a chance

36:38.300 --> 36:41.260
It's a great point. Thank you for bringing it up. Sorry. I went nuts

36:42.940 --> 36:46.860
Guaranteed funding means schools can cost as much as they want. Absolutely

36:47.180 --> 36:51.260
How else do you think columbia gets away with charging $62,000 a year?

36:53.260 --> 36:57.820
Absolutely, that's the way and I got sucked into it too. I'm not happy about it

36:57.820 --> 37:01.900
I'm not complaining about it. I'm just saying I know from firsthand experience

37:01.900 --> 37:07.420
How easy it is to go into a financial aid office at 18 years old in a city that's

37:07.900 --> 37:14.060
Five hours away from where you grew up and sign a piece of paper that says yeah, I'll pay back that in four years

37:17.340 --> 37:19.340
It's extremely easy

37:20.460 --> 37:22.300
Because they were

37:22.300 --> 37:25.340
They were doing it. That was their business model. The more the better

37:25.420 --> 37:30.220
That's why they could send these representatives to your high school with a fancy slide show

37:31.900 --> 37:36.860
They only had to get one or two students at every school they went to in order for that to be worth it

37:37.340 --> 37:39.340
It's an entire

37:39.340 --> 37:41.820
Four years of tuition. Don't you see it?

37:42.220 --> 37:44.220
I

37:45.740 --> 37:50.060
Imagine if you had a product that the government was willing to fund people

37:50.620 --> 37:54.060
Loans and grants in order to in order to buy it

37:54.860 --> 37:57.740
And all you got to do is sell it imagine that

38:00.140 --> 38:04.220
Then imagine that kids have been told this is going to be the greatest four years of your life

38:04.220 --> 38:07.340
Where you get to cheer for football teams and drink beer for four years

38:07.740 --> 38:10.220
Imagine that combination of things

38:10.940 --> 38:13.180
And then and then blaming the kids for it

38:17.100 --> 38:19.420
That's how messed up they have us in our heads

38:19.820 --> 38:26.300
And now imagine how easy it would be to get us to believe that there was a virus when there probably was already just a background that they're lying about

38:29.740 --> 38:33.180
It's just incredible. I mean if they lie together if they work together

38:33.580 --> 38:37.500
They could convince us of almost anything. That's where we really need to understand

38:37.980 --> 38:40.460
We start that's the baseline here

38:42.140 --> 38:46.620
If your parents work together to lie to you as a kid you're done that you're going to believe that

38:49.740 --> 38:54.940
If your teachers work together to lie to you whatever they lie to you about at school, it's going to be tough to break

38:57.740 --> 39:01.420
And if the people on tv and social media coordinated the lie to you

39:02.300 --> 39:06.140
Because of a national security priority that everyone accept the fact that a

39:06.620 --> 39:08.860
Pandemic occurred hey global

39:09.980 --> 39:15.900
National security priority that everyone accepted a pandemic occurred and that it was okay not only that but it was

39:16.460 --> 39:22.700
A plan to lie to you about it in a very coordinated fashion with a limited spectrum of debate with bad guys and good guys

39:23.260 --> 39:25.260
Both working for the state

39:27.260 --> 39:30.620
Now you're starting to get an idea of what fifth generation warfare really is

39:31.660 --> 39:34.220
And why they tell you that you can never figure it out

39:37.100 --> 39:39.740
Well, I'm telling you you can figure it out

39:40.860 --> 39:45.500
I'm telling you you can figure it out by understanding that it is simply coordinated lying

39:46.220 --> 39:54.140
And people pretending to oppose one another pretending to have an argument pretending to take a stand pretending to be a whistleblower

39:57.180 --> 40:01.820
And it's a combination of all these pretenders that has brought us where we are to where we

40:02.620 --> 40:08.620
The vast majority of the population think that they solve the mystery along with everybody else that it looks like the us

40:09.180 --> 40:13.420
Actually funded the research that led to the eventual

40:15.820 --> 40:17.820
Seating of the pandemic

40:20.380 --> 40:22.380
All right, sorry

40:22.380 --> 40:24.380
Just the way it is

40:24.380 --> 40:26.380
I'm going to go here and

40:27.180 --> 40:35.500
A warm welcome to the technology day of the Stockholm security conference and the session on the human mind as a battlefield

40:36.380 --> 40:43.180
I'm sibilabel the director of studies for armament and disarmament here at sipri the Stockholm international peace research institute

40:43.660 --> 40:49.500
And for those of you who are joining for the first time we have four thematic days of this Stockholm security conference

40:49.820 --> 40:53.340
Yesterday we focused on international law tomorrow

40:53.420 --> 40:58.940
It will be strategies and doctrines and on Thursday. We will focus on the protection of civilians

40:59.500 --> 41:04.620
And we will be concluding the conference with a peace prize ceremony in iper belgian

41:05.180 --> 41:09.500
Which will connect the battlefields of the past with the battlefields of the future

41:10.620 --> 41:18.620
Today we have one more session which will be on current trends in missile technology and missile proliferation will be which will be just after this one

41:18.940 --> 41:24.940
But now onto the human mind and just like the quantum technology sessions earlier today

41:25.340 --> 41:28.940
We will now zoom in on one technology area and explore

41:29.180 --> 41:34.300
implications for current warfare and for future warfare and like quantum

41:34.620 --> 41:39.980
It's a very complex. It's a very fast moving area with many interconnections to different technologies

41:40.460 --> 41:45.500
And many of us in the arms control community have come across terms like brain hacking

41:45.660 --> 41:50.380
Neuraling human announcement super soldiers brain computer interfaces

41:50.940 --> 41:56.620
Some of it we've seen science fiction movies some of it we've heard about in the real world and we're all trying to make sense of it

41:57.260 --> 42:00.380
And trying to figure out what's hype what are we missing?

42:00.940 --> 42:02.780
um, what

42:02.780 --> 42:07.580
Of the applications that we think are science fiction are actually real and where is it the other way around?

42:08.140 --> 42:11.260
So we are very lucky to have with us today

42:11.740 --> 42:14.540
one of the world's leading experts on this issue

42:15.340 --> 42:21.980
And I should also say that unfortunately professor knoll had to cancel his participation this morning due to unforeseen

42:22.140 --> 42:24.140
And unforeseeable circumstances

42:24.620 --> 42:30.460
But we have with us professor judano who could actually fill all day and actually all week I believe on this topic

42:30.940 --> 42:37.340
So there will be um plenty to explore in the next hour or so. I'll just say if you weren't about his background

42:37.740 --> 42:43.340
So he is professor of neurology iochemistry and ethics at jolston university

42:43.820 --> 42:47.900
And also a bioethicist of the defense medical ethics center

42:48.620 --> 42:53.100
He's a fellow both at the us naval academy at the naval more college

42:53.660 --> 43:00.300
And science advisory fellow of the joint staff at the pentagon and direct of the institute for bio defense research

43:00.460 --> 43:02.940
And has written many books around this on this subject

43:03.420 --> 43:06.700
So i'm sure you'll agree with me that we are very lucky

43:07.340 --> 43:09.500
to have him with us at this session

43:10.300 --> 43:11.180
So

43:11.180 --> 43:18.620
Dr professor jodana will first give an introductory presentation about the state of play current potential future military applications

43:19.180 --> 43:22.620
And then there will be a chance for you to ask questions

43:23.580 --> 43:28.940
I would ask you for that to use the q&a function and not to use it for statements

43:29.020 --> 43:31.020
Please only put in questions

43:31.100 --> 43:35.420
And I will then draw on that pool of questions and put them to jimbo

43:35.980 --> 43:39.420
The q&a section, but would that now over to you jim?

43:40.140 --> 43:44.540
Thank you very much mr. spower and so again, thank you to each and all of you for having me here

43:44.620 --> 43:47.420
It's a privilege and an honor to present at this forum

43:47.500 --> 43:53.500
And I think the title of the forum is very important. I mean not just the brain or the mind as the 21st century

43:53.820 --> 43:54.780
Battlescape

43:54.780 --> 43:59.260
But also the implications of what current science and technology can do

43:59.900 --> 44:01.900
The way it may be used

44:01.900 --> 44:07.740
the way it most likely will be used and what that infers for stances of preparedness readiness

44:08.300 --> 44:13.500
And the sustainability for peace particularly given the the very influential role

44:14.220 --> 44:20.380
That the brain mind will play in a variety of subtle influences in the way we think feel and act

44:21.020 --> 44:23.260
and perhaps a larger question is

44:23.980 --> 44:29.260
What needs to be done in terms of multinational engagement guidance and oversight?

44:29.340 --> 44:37.260
So as to maintain an ethical course forward while being very realistic and appreciating the multinational nature of the enterprise

44:38.700 --> 44:43.900
If we consider neuroscience and technology to be evermore so he kind of fight entity

44:44.300 --> 44:49.260
Hello, I mean doesn't he just kind of say it already right there. Isn't he just saying that it's an international?

44:49.980 --> 44:51.420
enterprise

44:51.420 --> 44:53.420
So it's a global effort

44:53.820 --> 44:55.820
And the human mind is the battlefield

44:56.620 --> 44:59.500
It's a global effort to convince us of something

45:01.980 --> 45:07.580
And again, remember this is the public facing brochure of something that actually has a very

45:08.460 --> 45:13.420
Large classified component. I'm sure of it. Obviously. I mean, why could you argue that it doesn't?

45:14.300 --> 45:20.380
And this guy's job is to provide the public facing component and probably also the part of the

45:21.420 --> 45:22.780
the

45:22.780 --> 45:25.180
closed session component as well

45:25.660 --> 45:27.660
At least he's probably more aware of it than we are

45:28.780 --> 45:30.780
But to the extent to which

45:30.780 --> 45:36.060
What behind the scenes is super technology and scary nanobots

45:36.700 --> 45:42.780
and advanced AI versus a bunch of people who are coordinatively lying about those things

45:43.900 --> 45:48.780
Is really up for grabs and I would argue that we should always err on the side

45:49.340 --> 45:53.660
Of exaggeration and lies because as peter teals so eloquently said

45:54.060 --> 45:59.500
The specialization and a lot of these fields has made it very easy for people to lie and exaggerate

45:59.500 --> 46:05.100
And so that's where he starts with regard to thinking about these things from quantum physics all the way up to

46:05.660 --> 46:08.300
What I would call virology is also right in there

46:08.300 --> 46:10.300
And

46:10.300 --> 46:13.020
See how exciting this is now because we're able to really

46:13.820 --> 46:16.620
Work through this in a way that that keeps people

46:17.500 --> 46:18.940
objective

46:18.940 --> 46:24.780
And keeps people able to keep their eye on the ball which is reminding people over and over again remember

46:25.660 --> 46:27.980
Coordinated like not just one liar

46:28.620 --> 46:34.700
But a liar who is telling a lie which harmonizes with other lies

46:35.340 --> 46:37.340
It's

46:37.820 --> 46:39.820
It's a very very

46:40.300 --> 46:44.300
Magic spell that's why I call it an enchantment lies that harmonize

46:44.940 --> 46:50.380
With other lies are very convincing especially if mixed in there are a couple chords of truth

46:52.540 --> 46:54.540
And this guy is one of the masters

46:55.260 --> 46:57.260
And

46:57.260 --> 46:59.260
We refer to this as neuro

46:59.660 --> 47:03.740
S&T and the reason for that is quite simple in that there's a relative

47:04.620 --> 47:06.620
Inseparability between the science

47:07.180 --> 47:13.500
That is to say the understanding and and insights that we gain to the mechanisms of the nervous system in the brain

47:13.500 --> 47:18.300
And what that infers for the functions of brain most broadly construed to be mind

47:18.860 --> 47:22.940
But perhaps more metaphysically if not practically construed to be

47:23.500 --> 47:24.780
identity

47:24.780 --> 47:25.740
self

47:25.740 --> 47:26.860
decisions

47:26.860 --> 47:28.140
feelings

47:28.140 --> 47:33.100
And the expression of same in a variety of interactions from the personal to the political

47:34.220 --> 47:40.140
But over and above I would argue that that because we are a pattern integrity the sacred biology

47:41.020 --> 47:42.780
dictates

47:42.780 --> 47:44.780
That these things are not separable

47:45.500 --> 47:52.060
So it's interesting for example that around the world you can find lots of institutes that are called the so-and-so brain mind

47:52.220 --> 47:53.900
institute

47:53.900 --> 47:57.580
As if brain and mind is something that we can talk about as separate

47:58.060 --> 47:59.180
entities

47:59.180 --> 48:05.260
That one doesn't come from the other or isn't part of the other or isn't the same thing or whatever it is

48:05.740 --> 48:08.460
This is a part of that magic spell which is

48:09.020 --> 48:15.260
Designed to take a little peg away or drop the level of reverence that you have

48:15.980 --> 48:19.980
For what you are as a a sacred bee

48:20.620 --> 48:26.060
And that brain mind idea has been going around for a very long time and for a very long time

48:26.060 --> 48:29.260
I was under its spell and so that's why I feel a very

48:30.060 --> 48:32.700
Important need to pause it there because brain mind

48:33.340 --> 48:39.740
Anytime you hear someone say that is already a duopoly which suggests a kind of

48:41.020 --> 48:42.540
lack of

48:42.540 --> 48:47.660
sophistication that you can pull the brain away and study it like a clock without

48:48.140 --> 48:50.140
Really having to address

48:50.700 --> 48:51.500
the

48:51.500 --> 48:56.540
Question of mind or experience or consciousness or soul or spirituality

48:57.020 --> 49:01.500
And that is a that that in and of itself is an enchantment. So be very aware of that

49:02.780 --> 49:08.220
Above that is that this science has given the ability to assess the brain

49:09.500 --> 49:11.420
access the brain

49:11.420 --> 49:13.260
And affect the brain

49:13.260 --> 49:16.940
And the science those last two are completely wrong we can measure things

49:17.660 --> 49:19.420
but we can't

49:19.420 --> 49:23.740
Read it and we can't program it. So that's that's that's impressive

49:24.380 --> 49:26.380
Has been capableized by

49:26.940 --> 49:30.380
Capable eyes tool set. He said to capitalize

49:31.740 --> 49:33.740
By an increasing

49:34.300 --> 49:36.300
A toolkit set of technologies

49:36.780 --> 49:41.500
Those technologies have allowed us to advance certain theoretical constructs about the brain

49:42.140 --> 49:44.140
But have also taken us to the limit

49:44.620 --> 49:51.020
Of our capabilities to assess and affect the brain and therefore have prompted the development of new tools

49:52.300 --> 49:54.460
So what that affords us

49:54.460 --> 49:59.740
Is the actual capability to harness and engage neuroscience and its technologies

50:00.380 --> 50:05.260
in what has increasingly become known as integrative scientific convergence

50:06.140 --> 50:09.260
Relative desiling of the physical

50:09.820 --> 50:11.500
natural life

50:11.500 --> 50:17.900
I have heard a lot of people talking about bio-convergence and and sending me things that you got to talk about bio-convergence

50:18.540 --> 50:19.420
um

50:19.420 --> 50:24.300
The very short thing would be for me that bio-convergence is another one of these

50:25.340 --> 50:28.460
Enchantments that if you think about it and try to understand it

50:29.020 --> 50:32.460
you are you are accepting its relevance and

50:33.500 --> 50:40.220
What's what's bio-convergence mean unless you really allow them to put shit in your head or implant stuff under your skin?

50:40.300 --> 50:42.300
What is it then otherwise?

50:42.300 --> 50:44.060
Bio-convergence is not

50:44.060 --> 50:51.020
Carrying around a cell phone even though they would like you to believe that that's that's part of bio-convergence. This thing still remains a tool

50:51.900 --> 50:53.900
It's a very very small

50:54.380 --> 50:55.900
laptop

50:55.900 --> 50:59.740
That if you put the right apps on it can also be kind of annoying

51:00.380 --> 51:01.420
um

51:01.420 --> 51:05.660
But if you just think about what this is it's just a connected little iPad

51:06.300 --> 51:09.260
that you can put annoying things on or

51:09.820 --> 51:11.820
Mentally disabling things on

51:12.700 --> 51:13.900
Um

51:13.900 --> 51:15.900
This is not bio-convergence yet

51:16.460 --> 51:20.780
Um, even if you put earphones in your head, it's not really bio-convergence yet

51:21.500 --> 51:25.740
Um, what they want you to think is that that's uh, that's a normal

51:27.420 --> 51:30.540
Uh a continuous let's say a continuous progression

51:31.100 --> 51:37.740
They want you to believe that you're already on the progression so you might as well accept the future stages of that progression

51:38.540 --> 51:42.220
And that's the illusion the enchantment and the lie

51:42.860 --> 51:46.060
Bio-convergence doesn't happen unless we allow it to happen

51:46.460 --> 51:48.940
Bio-convergence isn't an inevitability

51:49.900 --> 51:53.900
Convergence hasn't already happened because people took back seats

51:56.380 --> 51:59.740
And bio-convergence isn't happening because we have cell phones

51:59.820 --> 52:06.460
Bio-convergence is an a concept that's supposed to give you the idea that you're already on some slippery slope

52:06.460 --> 52:09.580
So you might as well just lay back and slide. No

52:10.860 --> 52:12.620
be careful

52:12.620 --> 52:14.620
And social sciences

52:14.780 --> 52:20.700
In those ways that provide a more three-dimensional understanding of what the brain and its functions are

52:21.580 --> 52:24.780
And how the brain and its functions can be assessed

52:25.900 --> 52:27.900
accessed and effective

52:28.300 --> 52:30.300
And the nature of those effects

52:30.540 --> 52:32.540
Smart supositories

52:33.180 --> 52:37.340
Smart supositories, you know, the thing is they could get people to use those now

52:38.220 --> 52:41.020
I think that would be the old maybe we should get the

52:41.660 --> 52:48.300
What is it the the babylon b should do a story about a uh an ai that you can put up

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
Instead of a pin

52:52.060 --> 52:58.060
I think most probably is aimed at what I would consider to be the quote low hanging fruit in other words

52:58.380 --> 53:04.700
Much of the driver of contemporary neuroscience and technology is aimed at biomedical purposes

53:05.020 --> 53:06.060
If you will

53:06.060 --> 53:09.660
Relatively benevolent ends wanting to do good

53:10.300 --> 53:16.140
To improve the human condition to reduce the human predicament of disease

53:16.940 --> 53:22.220
Injury and perhaps even the frailties that are a consequence of our finitude and aging

53:23.020 --> 53:29.020
But please understand to paraphrase the works of philosopher alistair macIntyre

53:29.580 --> 53:31.340
We have to ask

53:31.340 --> 53:33.100
What good?

53:33.100 --> 53:35.020
Which rationale?

53:35.020 --> 53:37.020
Who's justice?

53:37.020 --> 53:41.740
What we may see whoever the proverbial we are as being a viable good

53:42.460 --> 53:45.980
Can also be seen in certain ways as providing inequities

53:46.700 --> 53:48.700
inequalities or in some cases

53:49.500 --> 53:51.100
Frank engagements

53:51.100 --> 53:53.100
Arms and burdens to others

53:53.500 --> 53:57.100
I mean, I have a nice way of summarizing this a while ago

53:57.100 --> 54:03.660
I used to say that there are two types of people in the limited spectrum of debate. There are either these

54:04.780 --> 54:06.780
stupid complicated people

54:07.820 --> 54:13.180
And I think one example might be judy mikovits another example might be james giordano

54:13.180 --> 54:18.300
otherwise, it's the dumb simple people like paul off it or or

54:19.500 --> 54:21.500
Or angi rasmuson or

54:23.980 --> 54:25.980
Who are other dumb simple people

54:29.180 --> 54:31.020
You know, it's just a very simple solution

54:31.020 --> 54:31.820
duh

54:31.820 --> 54:35.980
And then the other people have like all these big words and all this stuff to say

54:36.060 --> 54:39.500
I still don't know if he said anything real other than trying to justify

54:39.980 --> 54:41.980
himself as an ethicist and

54:41.980 --> 54:48.060
the fact that he can he can dissect the ethical questions down to sub questions and sub questions of

54:49.020 --> 54:50.620
It's pretty impressive

54:50.620 --> 54:56.460
But over and above that understand if we can use any science in the Jordan Peterson of Georgetown

54:56.460 --> 54:58.460
That's a great one

54:58.460 --> 55:00.860
It really is only a case of how we define good

55:01.740 --> 55:10.220
And then whether or not that science and technology can be used in a way that is withheld from others to prevent them from accessing those goods and enjoying those goods

55:11.100 --> 55:13.100
Or can be inverted

55:13.500 --> 55:17.980
As a consequence be used to incur burdens risks and harms to others

55:18.060 --> 55:19.100
Okay, we gotta speak

55:19.100 --> 55:23.980
So what we can see is that by understanding the brain and the pretty girls it gives us the capability

55:24.540 --> 55:26.380
Of affecting human activities

55:26.380 --> 55:28.860
I mean individual group and perhaps even population levels

55:29.660 --> 55:33.580
And these effects can influence a variety of postures including postures towards peace

55:34.460 --> 55:36.460
Postures of vulnerability and volatility

55:37.500 --> 55:39.500
Postures of violence and bellicosity

55:39.900 --> 55:45.340
And of course, I think it becomes critical to understand that like any science and technology throughout human history

55:46.060 --> 55:50.540
The capability of potential and the allure of using cutting edge science and technology

55:51.020 --> 55:57.260
In ways that could be leveraged in a variety of competitive engagements from the economic all the way to the bellicose

55:58.140 --> 55:59.740
Is reality

55:59.740 --> 56:03.100
So if we consider those ways that these realities are enacted

56:03.500 --> 56:10.860
We must understand the existing domains in which neuroscience and technologies are employed in what was formally referred to as NSI

56:11.500 --> 56:14.940
Applications national security intelligence and defense operations

56:15.260 --> 56:18.780
National security misnomer with that because in some ways

56:21.180 --> 56:23.180
National what are these here

56:23.500 --> 56:31.260
Well, there's a bit of a misnomer national security intelligence and defense opera national security intelligence and defense operations

56:33.420 --> 56:35.420
All these acronyms

56:35.900 --> 56:39.180
When do you think this talk is from it's from 2021

56:41.260 --> 56:46.620
This is during the pandemic he's talking like this as if the pandemic isn't going on as if we didn't

56:47.100 --> 56:50.780
This is the stock home security conference in 2021

56:53.500 --> 56:57.660
This was uploaded December 15th 2021 almost 2022

57:01.020 --> 57:06.940
Coordinated lying across the entire spectrum of the limited spectrum of debate

57:07.580 --> 57:15.420
Coordinated lying even these lies are coordinated with some of the lies about the vaccine schedule that are being told

57:15.820 --> 57:20.700
These lies are coordinated with the opposition to the vaccines the opposition

57:21.260 --> 57:27.580
To the vaccine schedule that seems to always fight for free speech rather than just say the vaccine schedules criminal

57:27.580 --> 57:40.140
How many times have you heard somebody say I just want I just want randomized controlled trials for vaccines? I just want vaccines tested

57:46.060 --> 57:48.620
I only woke up two years ago, ladies and gentlemen

57:48.620 --> 57:51.820
I'm still pulling my head out, but I'm telling you a lot of these people who

57:52.380 --> 57:57.100
Claim that they are the dissident that they are the resistance that they

57:57.580 --> 57:59.980
Have risked life and limb

58:01.100 --> 58:05.420
They have put everything on the line because this is for all the marbles they're liars

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
And they are part of this coordinated

58:12.860 --> 58:15.020
Harmonized set of lies

58:19.260 --> 58:23.260
Remember it's many weaponized piles of money. They're not dumb

58:23.980 --> 58:27.100
They don't just control a few news broadcasts

58:28.380 --> 58:31.020
They haven't just started doing this since they were

58:31.660 --> 58:34.620
You know since they declared it or since they got lucky

58:37.820 --> 58:39.820
Nothing happened in 2020

58:40.860 --> 58:42.700
That wasn't planned

58:42.700 --> 58:47.020
Nothing happened in 2020 wasn't already on a list

58:48.940 --> 58:50.940
Of acts

58:51.900 --> 58:53.900
It's a theater show

58:55.500 --> 59:01.260
And the fact that this guy can give this talk at the end of 2021 at the beginning of 2022

59:02.460 --> 59:06.140
And have not mentioned anything to do with the pandemic yet at all

59:07.980 --> 59:14.780
Is almost a direct admission to me that the pandemic is in and of itself exactly what he is going to explain right here

59:15.180 --> 59:18.220
it is a war on the human mind it is a

59:19.020 --> 59:24.460
A a national security intelligence and defense operation

59:27.660 --> 59:32.700
Designed to convince the global population that something happened that did not happen

59:33.500 --> 59:38.060
So that they can be governed by that misunderstanding that mythology forever

59:40.300 --> 59:41.820
Operations

59:41.820 --> 59:46.460
Well, there's a bit of a misnomer with that because in some ways it whitewashes the scenario

59:47.340 --> 59:53.100
Perhaps more appropriate is to understand how neuroscience is in their technologies can be employed in warfare

59:53.660 --> 59:56.860
Intelligence and what various collectives view to be

59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.500
agendas and initiatives of national security whatever nations they may be

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.300
Here I alluded to some of the wonderful work

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.900
I had the privilege and honor of undertaking with my colleagues of the European Union human brain

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:15.180
Projects focal group the European Union human brain project. So he's really not just an American

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:24.220
He's connected to other global interests other weaponized piles of money other other other political interests

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.580
George town

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.060
On dual use brain science and a nod

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.140
Professor dr. Katinka Evers of

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.180
In Sweden as well as any of my colleagues that were participatory in that working group

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:47.020
But I think what becomes important to understand is a consequence of some of the results of our working group deep dive

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.660
Is that the ability to surveil?

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.700
Oversea guide and perhaps govern the brain sciences

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:59.180
Is highly contingent upon the understanding that these brain sciences are multinational in their enterprise and in their effect?

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.540
And so the discourse must widen and in many cases is de-electic

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.700
Please understand

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.980
At this point in time there are a number of neuroscientific tools and technologies

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:14.380
That are viable if not already updated into warfare intelligence and national security operations and agendas

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.300
Nothing i'm about to tell you science fictional

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.820
It is all science fact in terms of what is currently available or is what at high technological readiness level

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.740
So it's to be made available for the next two to five years. Wow. All right. How can we use these techniques and technologies?

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.140
Let's hear it any aspect of medicine and in this case we need to consider military medicine

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.700
I feel like he's about to show me all kinds of different timeshares that I can choose from

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:43.340
But when we're considering military medicine, it's not just a question of what we can do to treat those members of the military

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.900
When in fact they are injured or or ill

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.980
But what can we do?

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.580
Preventatively

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.540
Here we see a gray zone arising working if you will

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:58.620
Left of bang where bang is some event that induces trauma insult injury or change

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.020
Can we work to the left of that?

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.780
Can we for example employ the neuro sciences and technologies in areas of preventative military occupational medicine?

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.820
To restore what we may consider to be hope

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.540
an acronym for maintaining health

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.780
instilling

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.820
operational and occupational protection and enabling

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:23.820
These personnel to do their job affect those missions more capably and effectively and did you hear that? Did you hear that?

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.620
Isn't that funny military occupational medicine?

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.620
um

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.340
Is it just the enchantment that this guy can cast is oh, sorry

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220
his spectacular?

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.660
Military occupational medicine is what he means by that is augmenting soldiers

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.660
Maybe make it so that they can't feel emotion for a few weeks

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.740
Maybe so that they don't feel any remorse for a few weeks. These are the kinds of things that he's imagining. It's pretty impressive

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.380
Those ways that will enhance their survivability

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:01.340
Keep them protected and ultimately may also affect the way they interact with competitors or adversaries

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.940
hope

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.300
HOP what are we hoping to do when we consider

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.020
Operational and occupational protection and enabling the combat warfighter

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.500
the intelligence operator

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.060
military personnel of all types to do their jobs better

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.580
Well, this then gives rise to the idea of what constitutes optimization

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:25.980
What constitutes enhancement if in fact optimization and enhancement differs from some form of treatment

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.020
Particularly when healthy individuals are involved and what are the implications?

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:34.700
For taking individuals beyond some stated norm and is that not on one level or another

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:42.380
The implicit if not explicit goal of almost any professions training and certainly military intelligence train to be the best of the best

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:48.700
To do those jobs well and to do them in a way that provides some advantage to one's own forces

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.420
Against other forces whoever they may be

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.460
Which gets us back to the idea of what is good

01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:02.060
If a military what is any or some operational national security institution or organization for ports to be able to protect

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:09.260
The ideology ideals ways of life things that are held viable the kin kit the polis or some political

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:16.860
Agency or organization then that's held as a viable good and can be used to justify the applications of these types of techniques and technologies

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.620
Perhaps in some of more gray zone operations the neuroscience is can also be paired to intelligence operations

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.820
To afford increased cognitive capability for intelligence operators and systems to be linked to computational systems

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.500
So as to be able to discern more accurately what may be an intelligence viable signal from what may be noise

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.900
Whether that's a human intelligence signal intelligence communication intelligence

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.060
And of course the issue there becomes what are we actually doing?

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.140
Can we also not only affect the way we perceive and gain intelligence?

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.620
But can we use this in a proactive way?

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.420
In other words for psychological or what's now referred to as neuro cognitive operations nco's

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.100
To create more viable narratives propaganda if you will

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.300
Images to therefore create impressions

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:05.340
Experiences in others that affect them in certain ways that we now have a deeper understanding

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.180
Maybe we could stage an event in New York City hospitals where we

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.260
Made it seem like through a combination of fraud and

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.220
And getting rid of a lot of people that were already sick

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:22.700
We could create the illusion of a pandemic and then say that it was the start of something very deadly and get everybody to lock down

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:28.540
And then we can show them some images from around the world of people passing out and give them the experience

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:34.540
Holy shit. Did you hear what he just said? I'm gonna go back and play it again. It was so good

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.620
That's incredible

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.100
To be linked to computational system

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:46.220
So as to be able to discern more accurately what may be an intelligence viable signal from what may be noise

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.020
Whether that's a human intelligence signal intelligent

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:53.660
You mean like a podcast with real reach that you might need to you know co-opt

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:59.100
Maybe a message or or a or a person that you need to co-opt

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.740
You could use an algorithm to find that you could use programming and social media

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.500
To make sure that those people had reach only where you wanted to have it

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.860
Or you could make sure that you got somebody in front of them

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:15.500
That could step in front of them and claim to be an expert doing a bunch of analysis

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.060
For example like have sashilatapova step in front of somebody like katherine watt

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.220
And pretend that she did all the research and never mentioned katherine watt again

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.580
Take over the narrative of it's the d o d

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.460
And then we can put her all over the internet and let katherine watt sit at home

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.340
And pretend that and feel comfortable that sash is representing me very well

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.300
When in reality she's not

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:47.420
When reality she's part of this this thing this show this theater

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.820
Interestingly, this is in stock home

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.420
In 2022. I wonder if we looked up when

01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.500
when

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.140
sashilatapova was on stage with maryll nass and robert malone

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.260
When maryll nass said something about the state the department and robert malone almost visibly

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.500
I wonder when that was that might have been in 2022. Isn't that weird

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.660
It's all one big show ladies and gentlemen

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:25.580
And the show has lots of of different acts and different stages

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.820
And so if you're in this

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.380
Group of people following this group of people through this part of the bureaucracy

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.220
You would have seen this part of the show if you were in australia

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.940
And you were a nurse you would have seen that part of the show

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:44.300
And if you were in japan and you were a street vendor you would have seen that part of the show

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.620
And all the show is different but all the show

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:56.540
Somewhere inside of every one of these shows are the same group of people with the same core message

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.540
There was a virus that killed millions of people probably came from a lab

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.260
That's why we should control demolish america

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:09.100
And turn to a global system because these these countries by themselves they don't work

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.180
They're just they're just a big problem

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.540
And so collectively you have bankers doing it you have

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.500
You have representatives and senators doing it you have presidential candidates doing it

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.100
They're all part of it

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.620
They're all part of this

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.980
Weaponized piles of money global governance structure and they all want a bigger piece of the pie

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.260
They all know that this ship is sinking

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.580
And so we've got to come together as the peasants

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.460
We've got to come together as the people that are renting our house

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:51.020
We've got to come together as the people that only have five hundred and thirty four dollars in their bank account at the start of a month

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.340
Legends communication intelligence

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.340
And of course the issue there becomes what are we actually doing?

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.420
Can we also not only affect the way we perceive and gain intelligence?

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.820
But can we use this in a proactive way?

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.780
In other words for psychological or what's now referred to as neurocognitive operations nco's

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.460
To create more viable narratives propaganda if you will

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.660
Images to therefore create impressions

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.060
Experiences in others that affect them in certain ways that we now have a deeper

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.220
Understanding of how we can affect the brain to elicit emotional

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.860
Behavioral and perhaps even community and cultural responses. And what does that mean?

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.540
On one it's a funny conversation to have with my chat

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:46.780
And I do think that you know, james giro dino's message isn't going to be that great

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.660
So we don't have to necessarily always listen to this

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.460
I do think that we the people really are only hope and I do think the very idea of money itself

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.180
Maybe one of the ultimate weapons. I absolutely agree fiat money is an ultimate weapon

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:07.100
And I do think that there's something earlier that I said that is really relevant to this discussion that we are considered consumers

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.540
People who buy stuff

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:21.180
And that's our function in american society in capitalist society. I'm not saying capitalism is good or bad or communism is good or bad

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.260
I'm saying that

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.420
our culture is not

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.300
singing and dancing and music and

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.860
sport and

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.060
and

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.060
Well-being

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:42.780
Irrespective of what we might be led to believe it is our culture is consumerism our culture is materialism our culture is having things

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.340
That other people can see

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:52.060
And so when we fight for america, we want to be very careful about what we're fighting for because i'm not fighting for that

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.620
I'm fighting for

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:03.340
sport. I'm fighting for dance. I'm fighting for jazz music. I'm fighting for live music. I'm fighting for

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.060
chorus and choir

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.260
concert band and symphonies

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.260
I'm fighting for comedy

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.140
and

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:22.700
Genuine science that's not preparean falsification of null hypotheses. I'm fighting for big ideas

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.380
and big visions of the future imagining things that

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.340
aren't and why not

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.540
And a lot of these people aren't doing that a lot of these people are just telling a story

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.020
And no matter where they go and what message they give they're always telling the same story

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:46.700
It's not a message of hope. It's a message of giving up on america. It's not a message of hope

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:50.540
It's a it's a message of giving up on your neighbor. It's not a message of hope

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.100
It's a message of of doom and gloom

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.980
And that's not what giga ohm biological is about that's not the faith that I have

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.780
That's not the feeling I have that's not the hope that I have

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.940
That's not the world that I see when I look into the eyes of my children

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:15.340
I see a world of a lot of strife and turmoil a lot of lies and frustration to come

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.700
But I also see a lot of light

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:24.940
Because this stuff doesn't even make any sense anymore. This stuff is just ridiculous now

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:35.660
And and and the beauty is is that there is real biology out there. There's real stuff out there

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.300
There's a real world out there and we just have to take it back

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.140
We just have to where did I say in the beginning got to pull your head out of that box

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.060
Where all that noise is

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.380
Listen for the birds again

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.060
Listen to your kids play the piano again. Listen to the squeak of the shoes on the basketball floor again

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.340
Listen to the sound of a shovel in the dirt again

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.060
Listen to the sound of a lawn mower or your favorite music

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:07.260
That's where we're going, baby. That's where we're going

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.340
We're going back and we're going forward at the same time. We're going left or right

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.300
Or we're going sideways. We're going not where they want us to go

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580
We're going to lead ourselves

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.820
away from this

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.860
Transhuman nightmare that they want us to accept as just the

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.700
Inevitable reality slippery slope that we're on that's ridiculous

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:34.780
Half of this stuff doesn't even exist even though he just insisted that all of us is his reality right now or in the next five years

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:42.700
You mean like curtweilers curtweilers says that in 15 years there will be no disease and he can upload his brain into a computer or AI

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:50.140
It's just a different time frame a different time scale to try and bully you into accepting these concepts. Let's do it

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.100
Certainly, I think that the idea

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.580
The intent and perhaps the hope is that by better understanding the way our brains work

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.940
Will gain greater insight and appreciation for those things we have in common

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:08.060
Be able to bridge our differences and in so doing facilitate improved communication to avoid the escalation to volatility

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.060
Should we do that?

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:17.180
Solarius. Oh my gosh. That's really funny. That's very similar to saying we turned over all our decision-making to machines

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:24.780
Hoping that we would be happier and in reality all we did was turn over our decision-making to the men that control the machines

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:29.100
That's exactly what he's talking about. It's fantastic

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.220
Hey, I love it say it again basketball and the loss of american fundamentalism

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.500
This is a

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:43.740
Basketball and NBA basketball is a microcosm of that. You know the reason why you should never compare

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.820
Michael Jordan and his colleagues to the basketball players of now

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.380
the main reason

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.700
Because the rules of the game are the same anymore

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.180
If the rules of the game aren't the same anymore

01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:05.340
Then how can we compare the players of the 80s and the 90s to the players of the 2000s? It's just not there anymore

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:12.300
Because sport isn't what it used to be anymore because they are undermining our culture

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.980
They are undermining our identity and they are undermining our sense of right and wrong

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.980
That's why the NBA the rules don't get stricter

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.620
Wouldn't you think they would get stricter?

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.260
You know like when you move the lines back also the lines mean more

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.740
Then they do when you're a kid

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:39.900
Maybe you could let kids have an extra half step until they're 12 and then take it away

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.780
But instead we give extra steps to the guys that make millions of dollars a year

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:54.060
You see the irony of that it's it's the exact same thing that we're doing in every other facet of our culture

01:15:54.060 --> 01:16:01.100
Every other facet of our perceived reality is being inverted and undermined in exactly the same way

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:08.140
And the challenge is to be able to pull back pull back far enough to see that it's all the same

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.460
It's all one giant inversion

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.060
And that what that's what makes it easy for you to

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:20.940
Focus on and get trapped in one of these small little bubbles and think that wow

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:25.660
This is the most important thing to fight about right now. We better protest about Gaza

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:33.820
It's an amazing enchantment ladies and gentlemen

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:38.620
And this guy is kind of more or less explaining it and really flowery language

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:43.580
What they've done to us over the course of the last four years in a global effort

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:49.420
a national security intelligence and defense operation that was actually a

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:54.860
neuropsychological operation and whatever he whatever thing he used for that

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.380
So

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.980
Wow ladies and gentlemen, isn't it fun to be here now where we're a couple dominoes ahead of the story

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.300
and

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:10.460
As long as we don't get distracted by the shiny objects that are flying around

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.300
That we can actually keep moving forward and start to more succinctly

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:19.660
Every day have something to teach our children have some way of counteracting

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.460
Of opposing this nonsense. It's it's really feels good

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.940
He polyanish

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:33.740
Because the reality is that these tools and techniques offer viable and in some cases estimated valuable capability

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:36.700
To be able to assess and modify the thoughts

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:44.140
Actions and therefore overall stature of others the operational definition if you will of a weapon

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:49.580
Taken from the Oxford English dictionary a weapon is simply a means of contending against others

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.340
far more colloquially

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.420
We see this in bellicose framework. In other words, it means to

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.460
Use the words bellicose twice

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:03.180
Come on, dude. The definition of a weapon is some means of influence deterrence

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.460
And the question then becomes kind of brain sciences be weaponized in those ways that may be

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.020
Less lethal or non-lethal

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.700
Yet their influence be overwhelmingly more powerful in that the effects are getting at the essence of what it means to be

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.180
A relatively inviolable space of the self of identity of mind

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.180
Of being able to assess and perhaps control thoughts emotions and behaviors

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:26.380
remotely

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.460
And it's so being influenced postures of individuals groups collectives and perhaps popular

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.420
How could you control things remotely?

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.180
Could you do it with the internet?

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.540
Could you do it with coordinated lying on the internet? What about coordinated lying plus

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.140
Calm

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:49.420
Coordinated programming of what people see online. I wonder if you could control what people think and perceive by doing that

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:56.380
It doesn't have to be nanobots ladies and gentlemen. It doesn't have to be nanobots that are sprayed from an airplane

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
Can just be coordinated liars

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:03.100
Stick into the same story for many many years

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.380
And then when the fire alarm goes off they can say yeah, it's what we told you

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.780
I

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:18.780
We are breaking through ladies and gentlemen because we actually hit our face on the brick wall while we were running

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.180
And then they told us that that's not a brick wall

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.300
And we didn't believe them

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.220
And here we are

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.740
It's fun times ladies and gentlemen fun times. Thanks for being here with me

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:39.020
Is there some line that's being crossed there whereby this cognitive liberty is being attributed upon to paraphrase

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.820
The words of my colleague Nia Farahani at the University of Pennsylvania

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.660
Well, I think if we understand weapon in that context

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:52.380
We can then frame the brain sciences into those domains and those tools if you will that could be weaponized in such ways

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.780
Generally, we can parse these into two

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:57.180
Non-mutual exclusive and interactive domains

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:03.020
The assessment neuro technologies which include things like various forms of neuroimaging neurophysiological recording

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.900
Neurogenomics neurogenetics epigenetics and phenotypics

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.500
Neuro proteomics and the use of neuro big data

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.380
Which went coupled to decision technologies machining an AI

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:17.820
Creates an omnibus juggernaut of capability to not only acquire data and utilize data

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.620
An omnibus or jogger knot of capability like

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.220
The guy like eats a thesaurus for breakfast or something

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:33.260
But also to manipulate the data itself whereby assessment immediately can turn into effect

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.500
This then brings us into the realm of the interventional neuro technologies

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:45.180
And perhaps worse and foremost if not easiest is the ability to use extant systems of computational technology and engineering together with decision

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.980
Technologies big data acquisition and use in various forms of soft to hard AI

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.460
To manipulate the data themselves and by manipulating the data on large scales

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.100
It may be possible to literally paint a new reality of what an individual is

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:05.820
To can plant information in the large scale databanks make individuals appear to have certain neurological or psychiatric conditions

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.500
To affect their capability to do their job by virtue of if you will their profile their their data profile

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.820
By affecting aspects of their metadata so that they're regarded and perhaps treated in different ways

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:19.740
economically socially well terribly politically

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.620
But wait, there's more

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.380
The more we know

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.220
The further we can go

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:31.820
And one of the existing concerns is that the ubiquity of what's called bio data particularly neuro bio data

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:36.620
Create certain vulnerabilities and target abilities to be able to create precision pathogens

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:41.420
Now those pathogens need not be the traditional drugs bugs or toxins

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:48.940
They can also be certain devices that can be drugs bugs and toxins now he's going to get into his little groove again about certain things but

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.340
um

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:57.740
What what I want to say here are novel pharmaceuticals that's just spraying stuff or lacing things poisoning people

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.700
and not a neuro microbiologicals

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.260
um could be something like

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.220
uh

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.980
a

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:10.620
A bacterial infection that also secretes some kind of neurotoxin

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.820
Organic neurotoxins again are just chemicals

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.500
um

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.140
Neurotechnological is not even a word

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.740
Um, but he would like you to think it is cyber linked neurocog manipulation

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.220
Right now that's just cell phones and apps and social media

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.740
Um

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:37.260
I think he's talking about maybe internet linked type things. It's all again. This is bamboozlement. This is enchantment

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.340
I don't like the word bamboozlement as much as I like an enchantment. That's what people do when they have the

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:45.980
the tongue of a serpent

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.380
They're enchanters

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.340
And some people I'm sure have characterized me as an enchanter because he's such a slick talker

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.860
He's you know, it's a fake thing, but it this is different

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:07.020
What you experience here is someone trying to understand making mistakes as I do it and expressing a love of biology

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.300
Um that has existed in my life my whole life and I don't know what else to do with it

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:17.740
So I complain on the internet about the misrepresentation of biology all over the place

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:24.300
And I didn't realize that that was my calling until this stupid pandemic happened and then only then did I

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:29.020
Awakened from the slumber that I was in as an academy jishian

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:37.580
So I made a lot of mistakes and and shouted about a lot of the wrong things for 2020 and 21

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:41.020
But I also said a lot of the right things in that time

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:47.820
And was encouraged to say a lot of the wrong things by some of the people that are still meddling with us today

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.700
That's why I can't stop

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:54.620
I've really seen it from inside. I've talked to these people shake their hands

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:58.940
Taking selfies with them and had them lie to me or backstab me later

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:03.580
It's kind of personal for me

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.140
I try to keep it as objective as possible. I would really like to interview this dude someday

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.220
Be tuned to individual parameters of anthropometry physiology

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.260
To differentially affect individuals in a variety of ways

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.740
To direct or compromise their capability

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:23.420
I think we're at a low at the moment because we are so dead on balls accurate and actually a couple

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:30.380
Domino's ahead of them. That's why the the things that are happening right now in sub stack are happening right now on sub stack

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:36.620
People keep writing silly sub stacks without saying the right names or without

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.420
Without summarizing in an honest way

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:48.780
And now they're overextending themselves. They look like fools and so it's all just really a matter of time

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:55.100
You just have to keep letting them go farther and farther over the over the tips of their skis

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.420
That's that's my that's my plan

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:04.300
Nobody right now has warranted a a stream about any particular person anymore

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.060
Because they're making such fools of themselves and the list is very long

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:13.260
All of these people seem to say almost exclusively useless stuff lately

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:19.900
And if it's not useless stuff, it's the stuff that's on the slide with the with the um

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.380
with the dune

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.220
sound effects

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.260
novel virus millions dead gain a function yada yada

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.540
It's incredible

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:35.260
And what's fun is to hear it in 2022 this guy gave this talk

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:43.020
And anybody that took him seriously obviously took the gain a function lab leak seriously obviously

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:49.500
They believe that's real. This is this is totally a lie that harmonizes very well with that

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.660
And

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:56.860
Of course the story of a gain a function virus that we had to do something about

01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:03.900
And transfection was rushed and process one was different than process two is also a lie that harmonizes very well

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.300
I'm sorry, but you know sometimes

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:14.140
There's nothing else to do but keep repeating the truth over and over again

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:21.500
And the truth is is that these people are harmonizing liars. It's like a very macabre barbershop quartet

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.820
The thought emotion and action and the tenor is is

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:34.940
Is Francis Collins and the baritone is james giardano and the base is uh

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.020
Is uh, maybe peter hotez. I don't know

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.620
Putting all of these together we see a new toolkit

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:47.100
That essentially engages not only those domains that have been well addressed by

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.780
Current language of the biological toxins weapons conventions chemical weapons conventions and various declarations of signatory treaties

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:59.340
But in some ways sidestep that as I hope to show you which which may as we've called for them together with our international colleagues

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.620
Necessitate a revisiting if not revision of the language scope and tenor of these existing conventions and trees

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:11.020
New drugs for example that are able to penetrate the brain space far more capable at much lower doses

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:17.900
Is he for example linking pharmaceutical no to nano-engineered scaffolds my cells chaperones that allow

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:24.540
Facial pentate my cells my cells is a word that I learned from robert melon. Actually, that's just a big nano particle

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:29.900
That's funny prints into the brain space sometimes through means that can be rather clandestine or covert

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.660
inhalation transdermally and doing so with higher specificity

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:39.900
In fact in some cases targeting these inhaling or going through your skin and you don't even know it

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.380
That's great

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:48.380
Pharmaceuticals to be able to work in key individuals or groups of individuals based upon an understanding of their pharmacogenomics and dynamics

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:54.460
Here too, we see the ability to generate novel microbiologicals whether that may be bacteria fungi

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.260
Viruses and increasingly there is a worry about the potential weaponization of prions

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.820
That based upon individual collective and population information to develop

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.460
Weaponizing of prions he said

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:13.500
That's fantastic. Oh my gosh. That's fantastic

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.140
Holy shit whether that that's amazing fungi

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.940
Viruses and increasingly there is a worry about the potential weaponization of prions

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.580
That based upon individual

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:39.500
Or more global more universal creating if you will bellicose value in affecting relatively benign

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:44.220
The general population a conversation you'll have later in your conference

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:51.100
As well, we can utilize various methods of gene editing and synthetic biology to develop organic neurotoxes that are far more stable

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:59.420
Less labile more effective and can be used with precision particularly if and when delivered through the variety of unmanned vehicles aerial ground or sea based

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:04.780
And a variety of technological devices that can be used to augment or change cognitive Oh my gosh

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:11.340
That's brilliant. It would be so much cheaper to start spraying people with DDT and arsenic again

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:18.460
Seriously, this is wonderful. I can't believe he said it. It could already end the stream right now. It's like

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:25.740
This is it. This was the whole reason why this was in my study hall list from I don't know how long it's been there

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:31.980
And how long it got things got piled on top of it. I have not watched it. This is just

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.740
Awesome. I don't even know what he's going to say for the next 45 minutes, but it can't be better than that

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:43.580
Things that can be donned or docked for example transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation vagal nerve stimulation

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:48.860
And there is a robust move forward to create implantable devices

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.500
That are non-invasive or minimally invasive in their implantation methods

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:59.100
So as to create next generation neuromodulation that allows real-time access to read from the living brain

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.740
And write into the living brain

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:07.820
opening read and write into the brain is the dumbest lie they can tell

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.340
I just I am as a neuroscientist. It just makes me want to puke

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:22.780
Because that is like that is so many decades away that we shouldn't probably even use the word decades

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:32.060
It is just ridiculous to think read and write into the brain. That is the most absurd thing

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:42.060
Can you imagine saying listen carefully? Can you imagine saying that you could drill a hole in the side of your your pc

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.380
And usefully read and write to it

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:50.540
Do you think there's any way that you could

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:58.460
Usefully penetrate your laptop with a series of probes and wires through a hole that you create

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.340
In order to write and read to that laptop how hard would that be to do?

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:12.060
Knowing that we know all about the laptop. We know all about it. We have the schematics. It would still be pretty hard to do

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:19.660
It would be pretty really hard to do. I want you to think about that very freaking carefully

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.900
It would be very hard to do

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.180
And he just said

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:35.580
He just said it that we're going to be able to do that with our brain

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.020
Come on

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:43.740
Such capacity with this ability. I think also comes

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.940
Necessary and authentic anticipation and in some cases anxieties and apprehensions

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.260
Please understand please understand that it's very different

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:56.940
Read and write in the brain is not the same as

01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:03.020
Implanting something that will get an infection or cause an immune reaction or a stroke five years from now

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.100
That in the in the short term can be stimulated to get you hungry

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:16.220
Or can be stimulated to sexually arouse you or can stimulate you to need to act or or uh get angry

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.140
Yes, we can rudimentary

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:28.300
Rutamentarily stimulate parts of the brain to create certain behavioral patterns or certain impetuses. Yes, we can do that

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.660
That's not reading and writing from the brain

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.820
That's not usefully augmenting intelligence

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:38.620
That's not correcting depression

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:43.740
That's not any of the things that are implied in this enchantment

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:50.380
And so the reason why if you feel a little negative energy here, it's because this is where I spent

01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:56.700
The last 25 years focusing my love of biology on the question of how does the brain work

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:03.340
When I ran into what I considered to be the irreducible complexity of our sacred biology

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.980
I often met neuroscientists who said no, that's easy. We can make a model of it

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.020
No, that's easy

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.340
We can make a model of it

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:20.940
And I have been unable to express the amount of frustration that I've had in

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:26.860
In neurobiology these these past 15 or 18 years working as an academy justion

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:31.980
Not being able to express this appreciation for what we can't know

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:37.020
And the irreverence of all these people that keep talking about how we're going to know it

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:48.380
So that's why I'm here. That's why I'm not giving up on this. That's why I feel like I've got to develop this message rather than give up on it

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:57.260
Because there is a sacred biology to have reverence for there is a sacred biology that's worth trying to understand as much as we can

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.900
There is a sacred biology that if expressed correctly and understood correctly

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:09.900
Could result in more reverence for who we are and who our grandchildren are and what our well-being should be

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:19.260
And that's not this message, of course, that's not what James Giordano's message is, but that's also not what Robert Malone's message is

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:25.260
That's also not what Pierre Corrie message is. That's also what not Tony Fauci's message is or

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:30.700
Or any of these other people who purport to be on one side or the other of a limited spectrum of debate about

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:34.940
Whether or not the spike protein was a pre-on gate of function protein or not

01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:46.220
We are making huge progress ladies and gentlemen thanks to people like James Giordano and also everybody that supports this stream

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.060
Had a lot of you smartasses in the chat. I love it

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:56.540
That the neuroscientists in the development of neurotechnology is not the province of if you will a given few

01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:06.300
At present there are multiple large-scale national level brain science initiatives that are pouring billions of currency units into projects in the brain sciences

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:11.180
Again, the most notable direction of these the driver clearly is

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:17.420
Explicit those things that are benevolent wanting to do good reduce the burden of human predicament and disease injury capability

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.540
But that capability curve exists along a spectrum

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.700
And here too, the ability to utilize the brain sciences to improve our quality of life

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:32.380
Endor to use the brain sciences in preventive ways immediately allows us to confront again the idea of occupational preventive military intelligence medicine

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.780
Super soldiers proverbial super spooks the intelligence operator

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.580
But recall here too. What is my good may not necessarily be your good

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:46.060
What I and my kin and kiss hold to be valuable defensible

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.180
May not in fact be what yours defines to be so

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:56.220
And so the use of advancing tools science and technology inclusive of the brain and cognitive sciences in those initiatives and agendas

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:59.820
That can be used in defensive ways or in some cases

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.620
Offensive ways to decapableize others to reduce their will their willingness

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.660
Decapableize others

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.420
Decapableize. I mean that's uh

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.740
That

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.580
That's a pretty bad word

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:25.180
In my mind, but that's what they did to us in order to remove our ability to exercise informed consent, which includes saying no

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.700
They decapableized us

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:38.540
They decapableized us of exact ex of exercising informed consent another great James Giordano summary statement

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:42.380
They decapableized us of making informed

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:49.340
Decisions about transfection informed decisions about lockdown and their relevance or danger for us

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:54.140
They decapableized us and they decapableized us not with

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:59.580
neurotoxins or nanobots, but with careful coordinated lying

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:06.940
Perhaps the cognitive and physical capabilities which advance towards some level of volatility or violence

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.340
Is very very real

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:17.340
But more than that what becomes important to understand is that the underlying philosophies ethics anthropologies and therefore limitations and constraints on the brain sciences

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:22.220
In terms of researching their translation into various practices inclusive of those it could be used for military medicine

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:29.020
And to be used for military warfare intelligence operations different. He's not mk ultra and he's the guy that records the

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:33.980
The recordings that they play for people who are being mk ultra

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:36.780
As a consequence of culture

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:42.940
You know that large scale initiatives of brain sciences are multinational. There's an increasing asian effort to be sure that is explicit

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.380
This is advancing develop nations and giving them certain capabilities to leverage the brain sciences in and across

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:57.820
Fusions of governmental initiatives research initiatives and commercial initiatives that very very least could leverage the brain sciences and economic ways to create new balances of power

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:01.500
On medical markets and perhaps even lifestyle if not military markets

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.940
As well, what we're seeing is a rise in what has been colloquial referred to as neuro hacking

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:14.300
I wonder if I played this guy at night in my headphones if I would gain his is magnificent vocabulary

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:18.300
Do it yourself community, which not it's not problematic per se

01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:27.100
But it's certainly vulnerable to influence and manipulation by state actors and non state actors and the development of proxies both state and non state proxies

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.620
Oh

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:33.100
Stage and non state actors state and non state proxies

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:39.180
Maybe like flcc or the american front line doctors or the wellness company or

01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.700
dare I say

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.300
I can

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:49.100
Children's health defense or some of the people in those organizations

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.060
Dare I say that I think I do

01:38:54.940 --> 01:39:03.740
dare I say that that some of the political parties in america might be part of these state and non state actors and they might even fund proxies

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:11.820
dare I say that non state actors like large weaponized piles of money might fund proxies in order to

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:18.540
wrestle power away from national governments or state governments or to

01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:23.660
influence the state or local governments. I mean interestingly

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:26.300
he's saying all of the truth

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:29.980
out loud in big enough words so that

01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:32.700
skilled tv watchers won't catch it

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
but people on the inside will

01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:41.340
people that are privy to the the lanyard discussions people that are privy to the

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:46.620
to the to the classified websites they understand exactly what he's saying

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.580
and what he's not saying

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.580
which a lot of

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:57.500
things that I've learned one of the biggest lessons that I've learned in the pandemic is that everything is an admission

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.100
and you should think a bit like a lawyer in that sense everything is admission

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:09.500
and what you don't say or say both of them there are admissions

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:15.020
and one of the things that I think frustrates a lot of people is when they are

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:21.660
not thinking clear enough to understand that everything being said is an admission

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:29.580
and if you read people's sub stacks for example with that in mind the insistence

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.140
on certainty about certain certain things becomes an admission

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:39.420
within the global neuroscience community and do it yourself community that can be

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:43.980
manipulated in those ways to affect sovereign states through the infiltration of capabilities

01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.980
within those states jurisdictions difficulty if you will to monitor for example here in the

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.580
united states there is a directed program with our federal bureau of investigation

01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:55.820
to work with the do it yourself neuro hacking community in cooperation with interpol

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.380
so as to maintain the stringency rigor and if you will ethical probity of that community and

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:03.100
render them somewhat more resistance to infiltration

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:09.180
I do think there's a lot to communication that is nonverbal and I do think that that is

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:15.180
very maladaptively if I'm going to try and talk like him for a second

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:20.700
maladaptively augmented by social media and our cyber presence in other words

01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:25.420
you and I talking in this way is not as bad as listening to him

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:30.460
because you and I have an ongoing relationship and you kind of know

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:38.220
you know my mannerisms and my my tendencies and so you you may feel some

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:43.260
connection to knowing when I'm hiding something or knowing when I'm not telling

01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:47.500
everything that I should be or when I'm in a bad mood or this kind of thing and so there's a lot

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.100
of nonverbal communication that's occurring between us because of our

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.460
ongoing relationship that doesn't occur when you meet somebody for the first time in a Zoom meeting

01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:00.060
and allows and I would go back to the Peter Thiel thing

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:07.420
allows lies and exaggeration to exist in greater quantity and greater proportion because personal

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:13.180
contact makes that more difficult I don't think it's 80 percent but I do think that that's one of

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:18.620
the reasons why I remind you every once in a while with a slide with a lot of selfies

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:24.780
to remind you that I have met these people in person they've shaken my hand and that means

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:33.180
some of them have lied to me to my face and I would argue that one of the gifts that you get

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:40.620
if your if your parents are abusive one of the gifts that you get if you have then

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:52.620
don't have the optimal childhood is that you have suspicion of adults and you know that adults lie

01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:59.260
and if you as a child find out that adults lie even the adults that you trusted the most

01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:04.540
then you grow up with a very good sense of when people are lying to you you almost have this

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:11.100
gut instinct I sweat different and I get a little feeling at the top of my head when somebody's

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:17.820
lying to me it's very strange and some of these people have lied to me and only later did I actually

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:22.060
figure it out that wow they really did they freaking looked me in the eye they said a bunch of shit

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:26.860
that wasn't true and hoped that I would accept it and even better they hoped that I would go and

01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:34.060
shout it from my stream and occasionally I have and then realize later that it's a mistake that's

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.460
the kind of experience that I bring to this if you're joining me for the first time and gotten

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:44.380
this far that a lot of other people don't bring because I've trusted everybody I've given everybody

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:48.300
the benefit of the doubt over the last four and a half years and been bitten most of the time

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:54.940
James Giordano is a gift that doesn't stop giving though I can just keep watching videos of him

01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:58.780
and he says things that are worth millions of dollars and so this is no different this has

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:03.820
been a great stream so far by various actors and agents who may have capricious if not nefarious

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:10.140
intent but I think it's also important to understand that these different cultures different countries

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:15.260
bring to the table different histories different needs different values different philosophies

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.660
and very often those histories are longstanding and these philosophies anthropologies and values

01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:25.740
established distinct ethics and those ethics may be far more permissive than we whoever we may be

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:30.940
would like and in other cases it affords opportunities for things like research tourism can't get it done

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:36.380
here go there well what does that mean is that ethics dumping or is that simply ethical heterogeneity

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:40.940
but clearly what it does is it re-establishes the capability for leveraging the brain sciences

01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:46.060
in ways that can be used in multinational relations that range from the economic as I said earlier

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:50.380
all the way to the velocos wow I mean he's just saying it without saying it we could work

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:56.460
together to screw people over if we wanted to and maybe we will with a group of non-state

01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:01.660
actors and state actors and state proxies and non-state proxies he said it right there

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:14.060
we could in 2022 he's saying oh boy I mean really it's becoming easier much of the neuroscience

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:18.140
is shared in international form and I'm not making any proposition to decrease that but I think

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.740
there is a need for increased responsible conduct of research inclusive of its dissemination and

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.540
sharing to be able to understand what's being shared and how it might be used not very different than

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:31.660
the the the advocating for a control I gain a function research because we don't know what

01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:36.060
they're doing and we don't want them sharing it with everybody there are a number of tools

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:39.100
and methods that are available off the shelf and as I mentioned previously there are dedicated

01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:44.060
efforts by nations and nations in their proxies towards not only developing these capabilities

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:47.500
and brain sciences that could be weaponized but actually putting them into play as recent

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:51.020
evidence would show a case of point such things like no but Chuck the use of a variety of organic

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:55.020
toxins and the still somewhat controversial consideration of the use of various types of

01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:59.900
neurologically directed energies so I think it becomes important to recognize that these things

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.980
are ready for prime time the technological readiness level has been indeed acknowledged

01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:08.380
and appreciated by a number of worldwide groups not only ours working with the new brain project

01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:12.700
health organization UNESCO most recently NATO the national academies here in the United

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:19.580
I mean what NATO UNESCO the United Nations World Health Organization can you list any other bad

01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:25.980
guys that we would rather not cooperate with like holy shit on a shingle indeed acknowledged

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:30.380
and appreciated by a number of worldwide groups not only ours working with the new brain project

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:35.100
health organization UNESCO most recently NATO the national academies here in the United States

01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:41.020
National Research Council all of them recognizing the viability potential bellicose value and realities

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:46.220
of neuroscience and technology as tools what does bellicose value mean does that mean that it can

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:50.860
hurt people or it can be really loud and obnoxious what does he mean by that he said bellicose too

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:56.860
often to I can't ignore it anymore warfare intelligence in national Havana syndrome could be legit but

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:03.180
don't think of it as mind control think of it as maybe they can send a a focused beam of energy

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:08.700
into somebody's brain and it can hurt them I mean is it would it be strange if they could make a

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:14.060
commercial sized microwave and focus it on a on a on a room that it would bother your brain

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:18.620
would that would that surprise you at all that's not the same as remote control

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:26.220
and he can say all these big words but you know if they have a microwave gun that can kill neurons

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:30.860
with heating and that's not a very fancy technology that's not very special

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:37.340
and you could call it neuro something something but it's in reality it's a microwave beam

01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:43.580
I mean and that's where I think this stuff gets distorted I think that's what this guy's job is

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:54.620
is to imply that chemicals toxins and focused energy are equivalent to AI control read writing

01:47:54.620 --> 01:48:00.060
in the brain and and behavioral modification on a mass scale it's not the same

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:11.580
one doesn't imply the existence of the other but he is very capable of his of of enchanting

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.340
his listeners so that those are considered all part of the same thing

01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:20.540
some of the more recent discourse for example by the Nuffield Council some of the work of our

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:24.220
group not only with the human brain project but with others have addressed those ways that

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:27.340
you might be able to surveil and oversee these initiatives and agendas

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:33.340
but there is also a sticking point if one of the recommendations and I think perhaps a viable

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:38.540
recommendation is that the brain sciences shall not be up taken into those agendas explicitly

01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:43.420
by those countries who sort of embargo will push back on these intents we have to appreciate

01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:47.420
not only would that does idiosyncratically within a country or community but what are the

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.460
benefits if not burdens risks and perhaps threats systemically because a lack of commitment to

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:57.980
neuroscientific technological research development testing does not in any way preclude others

01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:03.420
research and I would argue dude for peace that actually the people that push the the human genome

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:09.580
project are also fake it until we make it salesman I would say that the people that pushed the viral

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:17.180
causes of of chronic chronic fatigue syndrome are fake it till we make it salesman that mark

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:23.820
actually identified a pre judy mikovitz make it fake it till you make it salesman on the exact

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:30.940
same subject that actually trained under hilly rickoprowski fake it till you make it has become

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:37.500
something that our kids think is how adults do it it's not how I did it it's not how my dad did it

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:42.620
it's not how my grandma did it it's not how my grandparents did it but somehow or another

01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.620
this culture has kind of taken over

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:54.140
we're not faking it until we make it we were a biologist I was a biologist with a 20-year

01:49:54.140 --> 01:50:01.980
career in neurobiology that kind of snuck through a Nobel prize-winning lab in 2014

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:11.340
I mean I'm not I'm not anyone without a CV I'm an absolute legitimate biologist bringing legitimate

01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:18.300
questions to the floor about this stuff and being ignored for four years being misled for

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.820
four years being being played with for four years

01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.220
and I'm mad about it because I think they're after our kids and they're after our grandkids and

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:37.420
and very few people seem to be mad enough about it to do anything so I'm trying to bring that

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:42.380
biology out and I think that James Giordano is a wonderful background on which to bring it out

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:52.300
because this is a fake it until you make it fake and they have faked biosecurity and bioterrorism

01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:55.660
and pandemics they have faked it until they made it

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:04.460
they faked all of that stuff that potential they faked it and then they made it

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:10.380
and now they've got to double down on the fake otherwise they won't have made it where they've

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:16.620
already made it you see this is it right here they have to stick to it the coordinated harmonizing

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:24.780
lies must be respected otherwise the whole illusion falls apart and the since the illusion goes back

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:30.780
not to 2020 the illusion goes back all the way to the special cancer virus program

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:38.220
when they thought that they could irradiate things to increase the speed of evolution

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.540
when they were all one department

01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:51.340
development testing and perhaps application and translational use initiatives in some cases

01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:54.940
may augment it and this gets us to the difficulty of global sure

01:51:55.900 --> 01:52:01.420
conventions Helsinki biological toxins and weapons conventions are having a difficult time

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:05.660
dealing with some of these non-conventional techniques and technologies very often international

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:11.020
treaties don't necessarily guarantee cooperation but more than that the extant verbiage of many

01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:15.900
of these treaties has only begin to scrape the surface as to the categorical diversity of the

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:22.220
way of its neuroscientific tools and technology I would rather say that what AI and large language

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:27.980
models have done and should have done for us is to reveal that language itself is an illusion

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:35.980
language itself is a sort of limited spectrum of ideas and the more we allow the precision

01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:43.980
of our language to be reduced from a a college level to a 12th grade level to an 8th grade level

01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:52.380
to a sixth grade level we have the inability to express ourselves the inability to express

01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:58.860
our reverence for that which we can't understand because we are now trapped not only in a limited

01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:04.220
spectrum of ideas but a limited spectrum of words with which to juggle those ideas

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:12.060
and so large language models if they've exposed anything for me they've exposed the fact that

01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:19.020
language is part of the way that they got us they dumbed us down we don't talk the way that

01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:26.780
they used to talk at the start of the ninth of the 20th century just go and look for yourself after

01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:34.140
this stream for a speech when Ronald Reagan was still running for office as the governor of

01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:41.900
California and you will find a level of language that's simply not found on television anymore you

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:49.820
will find a level of sophisticated discussion about fine points and details and humor that you

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:55.020
won't find in any political speech ever again in America if they have their way

01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:02.620
and that's for me what large language models have shown me is that the more the less words we have

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:08.700
to play with the more simple it is to make shit up to lie about it and to distort the truth within

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:14.460
this limited spectrum of debate that is also reinforced by this limited spectrum of vocabulary

01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:20.780
and concepts it's extraordinary to me great comment. Apologies could be developed in use

01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:26.700
the BTWC and CWC don't explicitly prohibit medical use occupational preventive medical use

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:31.660
commercial or proprietary use in the development of particular tools and technologies that can

01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:36.460
be employed in commercial testing inclusive of commercial testing for example of organic

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:41.740
materials to assess their vulnerability in the workspace or in some cases the research development

01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:46.700
test evaluation and use of neuro technologies is latter point was specifically addressed by

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:51.340
the Australia delegation the Australia group at the review conference of the biological toxins

01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.620
and weapons conventions a couple of years ago and so this is coming to the fore increasingly and

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:58.220
I'm encouraged by that but I think what we're really facing here is that neuroscience and

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.940
technology can be likened to an international super speedway a formula one race multiple lanes

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:08.380
multiple vehicles a very very high technological prowess and capability a rapid pace relatively

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:15.500
big prizes. Now what I would suggest is that a very similar story is that bird too loud that

01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:22.940
Robin is going bananas a very similar story has been told about AI and the biological

01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:32.220
space let's say the biological reality in that and here hear me out for a second that China has

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:38.860
been collecting medical data and genetic data from their more homogenous population genetically

01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:46.140
for a longer time than we have and so if he was to tell a story in a secret meeting what he would

01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:52.700
say is America we are so far behind because this is a race and the Chinese because of their

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:59.980
system because of their totalitarian control the UK because of their their their nationalized

01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:07.260
medical system and and Israel because of their nationalized medical system because of certain

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:14.460
databases in the United States we have the opportunity to catch up and if we don't if we continue to

01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:21.260
ignore this race we will fall behind forever and the only way we're going to catch up is to do

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:28.460
something drastic and that might include orchestrating a pandemic to make sure that the sovereignty

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:33.900
that Americans consider their own is permanently erased by an emergency a crisis that we all agree

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:38.860
happens that we all agree could happen again and so we can catch up in this race

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:47.740
just consider that a possibility remember I'm calling the cops I don't know why the criminals

01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.420
are doing what they're doing and I don't have a good explanation because I ain't them I don't

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:57.500
have a copy of the plan but there's lots of good explanations that are right in front of our face

01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:06.060
that don't involve magic tricks that don't involve you know secret technology they just involve

01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:16.220
a wonderfully orchestrated coordinated harmonized list of lies again that range from the financial

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:20.780
all the way to global hegemony is and the ability to influence and exert forces in a variety of

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:24.540
different domains again from the economic to the bellicose and there were risks and hazards risks

01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:28.380
and hazards that are inherent to the technology and those that are derived from its various

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:33.820
uses and military operations although very often exist in some level of limited transparency

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:39.580
in an open society must have some level of responsibility and communication to the public

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:43.980
that it vows to protect the question then becomes if we're going to enter the race and we already

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:48.940
have are there race rules and restrictions well our group working together with others here

01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:52.380
in the United States and internationally have proposed if you're going to get on the racetrack

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:57.100
you need some rules to get on the ramp you propose something called the on ramp approach

01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:01.260
the operational neurotechnology risk assessment and mitigation paradigm and I provide those

01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:06.540
references for you written large and over it involves a general six r approach that then drills down

01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:10.220
into specific questions that must be asked I would argue this is stupid complicated

01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:16.700
you're making questions about ethics about personal and individual sovereignty sovereignty

01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:21.660
over children sovereignty over data sovereignty over medical data sovereignty over genetics

01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:29.500
and sovereignty over your grandchildren as being irrelevant and breaking down into a lot of big

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:35.820
words and a lot of subtext that actually just completely sidesteps the idea that we have any

01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:39.980
sovereignty over ourselves or any sovereignty over our future 80 sovereignty over our children

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:45.500
and and that's what's happening here I see just an enchantment and this might be an

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:50.460
enchantment aimed at people that are already within the bureaucracy that already understand

01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:55.340
and have been at secret meetings before and so can fill in some of the blanks that you and I can't

01:58:56.860 --> 01:59:03.420
but one of the blanks here is kind of a lookaway doctrine we know that that military and and

01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:07.740
government intelligence agencies often function on a lookaway doctrine if you don't know what's

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:13.340
going on in that room and you don't ask any questions then what does it matter and so again

01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:18.780
that's just the tip of the iceberg of what is not being said here but what is being said is that

01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:28.140
we're going to obfuscate the simple ethical ideas of informed consent and sovereignty

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:33.580
by never using those words by never talking about those things how can he be an ethicist

01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:40.380
he's no difference than then Tony Fauci's wife who can give an entire talk about bioethics without

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:48.140
ever once saying informed consent and here we have another person who parades himself as being a

01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:56.620
bioethicist but never ever says informed consent even Robert Malone says he's actually a bioethicist

01:59:56.620 --> 02:00:03.580
but in all that bioethics in it running through his veins he's never bothered to explain that

02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:08.780
transfection was always criminally negligent and healthy humans it should have never been given

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:13.980
to children he sat on a beach and kind of made it a gray area as to whether kids should take it or

02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:20.780
not which also of course was an admission or an implication that adults and old people sure they

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:27.820
should take it they're at more danger of covid than you are barefoot on a beach

02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:35.260
it's all part of the same coordinated line he has probably been in a few meetings with

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:41.900
James Giordano at one point or another in his illustrious career serving this global governance

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.700
weaponized pile of money structured

02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:53.340
once you see them ladies and gentlemen it's you can't unsee them and that's what we're doing here

02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:58.940
one by one people are going to come to see it they're going to pull their head out of this box where

02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:02.460
all these people are telling these loud stories about what they did

02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:09.100
selling an ivermectin book selling a book about lies my government told me

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:14.700
publishing a book about the covid virus and in the beginning of the pandemic but not really

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:20.140
publishing it anywhere else not really pushing it at all it's all lies ladies and gentlemen they're

02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:28.140
all liars working for one non-profit that's supposedly fighting for for autistic kids around

02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:33.100
the world and then starting another profit that's non-profit that's supposed to fight the who and

02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:39.340
all the while years and years later nobody's even mentioned the prep act or strict liability or

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:47.020
the seventh amendment violation that the prep act subtext represents years and years and now

02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:52.220
we're on to our second second non-profit fighting the who and still we're not saying that it's

02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.860
essentially just the criminal vaccine schedule that they're protecting essentially just the idea

02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:02.140
that we have defeated disease with vaccines that they're protecting that none of them actually

02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:06.380
question Robert Malone, Meryl Nasse, I mean they none of them question it.

02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:16.300
Who else doesn't question it? Brett Weinstein, his wife, Peter Thiel, Eric Weinstein, Jordan Peterson,

02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:25.740
who else doesn't question it? Do any of them usefully question it or do they talk about free speech

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:35.820
randomize control trials and not say strict liability not say strike the prep act not say

02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:44.540
seventh amendment violation none of them do none of them that have had much longer than the pandemic

02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.820
to figure it out. Meryl Nasse could have pulled her head out and said it anytime she wanted to

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:56.380
in the last 10 years that she's been taking money from this opposition. She could have just said

02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:00.300
that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal just compared to any other country and that's

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:05.980
where we should start she could have said it she hasn't anyone there could have said it they haven't

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:14.780
question very clearly find a video where one of these people has said it the United States

02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:17.820
vaccine schedule is criminal compared to another country

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:27.900
they haven't said it they've said that the mandates are wrong that censoring people on the internet

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:38.780
is wrong health freedom is right it's all part of the same coordinated harmonized list of lies

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:45.580
where none of them step on each other's toes where all of them pretend to stop one part of the

02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:49.820
train but none of them get in each other's way so it looks really convincing.

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:59.500
And key context of framing that must be appreciated it demands responsibility for realistic assessment

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:03.660
of the technology not science fiction there are plenty of real things that need to be addressed

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:08.460
reviewed in some cases guided evaluating research and viable uses in practice what

02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:12.780
constitutes dual use research of concern but does not what constitutes gain of function research

02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:18.300
of concern and what does not. Responsive to the burdens and defects not only idiosyncratically

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:23.500
among individuals and collectives but perhaps systemically as well given certain harms of omission

02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:28.540
or commission revising that it's two hours I think I'm going to leave it here and maybe I'll watch

02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:33.020
some of this at double speed and see if there's anything worth pulling out as highlights I don't

02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:37.100
want to make this video too long and I don't want to test peer tubes ability to put it up I'm going

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:43.820
to see if I can get two hours again. For the 72 people who have joined me this morning

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:49.740
on this show thank you very much for being here thank you very much for taking the time to share

02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:55.580
my work and to be here and participate in the chat I'm getting better at being able to read

02:04:55.580 --> 02:05:00.460
the chat quick see if there's anything worth commenting about and then going on and so please

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:07.900
keep coming please keep typing please keep sending the emails it's all going to get better and better

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:14.780
and better in this month because it has to because my family needs to make this work I need to make

02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:18.460
this work and I really believe this is what I'm supposed to be doing so thank you very much

02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:26.460
look forward to some more broken science initiative content. Matt Briggs has been working hard to

02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:34.780
start to put a general big picture of probability course together and I've been diligently following

02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:41.180
a long and listening and trying to figure out how I can help or summarize or or maybe recap some of

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:45.980
the stuff that he's doing and I think he's kind of learning as he goes to because this is a course

02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:50.300
that he hasn't you know already outlined from the beginning to the end but it's kind of improvising

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:54.060
his way through it and I think that was what it also makes it a little more entertaining so you

02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:59.100
can find those on Twitter if you haven't found them already and other than that I guess I would

02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:06.140
say thank you very much for joining me and we will be here again faithfully tomorrow

02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:19.740
and I guess I'll put this one up as the last slide. Did that work? Yes. Although my computer is

02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:27.580
cranking like it's not very happy. I don't know what happened there. Ladies and gentlemen thank

02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:32.460
you very much for being here thank you very much for participating and I will definitely see you

02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:38.220
tomorrow again at 10 10. I'm going to try to get sharper and sharper and sharper. The actual goal

02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:46.380
in terms of 10 10 is to start the music and the slideshow or some other placeholder at 10 o'clock

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:52.700
so that I'm really sharp at 10 10 and you don't necessarily need to watch the whole

02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:58.940
introduction to get there at 10 10 so that the people who are necessarily are frustrated with

02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:04.060
the show starting and then having a four or five minute introduction won't need to be as frustrated.

02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:12.380
Thank you very very very very very very very much it's really encouraging and thank you again

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:17.020
for for sharing my work and I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:32.300
We're going to summarize that stuff that we've learned about virology and pre-ons and then

02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:39.180
in the coming week or so and we'll put together a succinct slide set that's kind of an update to

02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:47.820
the old maximum slide set and and we've been following way behind on slidesets and so

02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:54.460
May is the the month where that's going to start again. It is a little more work for me in the sense

02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:00.780
of I've got to be ahead of myself and and have two decks I have to have this deck and then I have

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:05.580
to have the deck that could be made into a PDF because as you can imagine with all the moving

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:11.580
nonsense and with all the extra stuff that's on these decks making a PDF of this deck is not

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:16.460
really useful. It becomes a giant document with a lot of moving parts that aren't all embedded

02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:23.260
and so I have to make a separate deck that summarizes the deck that I use and so anyway we need to do

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:30.060
a pre-ons deck we need to do a virology deck we need to do an immunology deck and we need to do a

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:36.780
RNA cannot pandemic summary deck and so those are all little mini courses that's what I've been

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:42.620
trying to threaten as a mini course and so these videos and these study halls have all been

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:52.780
preparation for that mini course and in the background I have actually been assembling for

02:08:52.780 --> 02:09:03.660
example I've been assembling pre-on reviews and all the papers that I want to use in the coming

02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:10.380
courses we have pre-ons we have a couple other things in there that we need to learn we need to

02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:15.260
know what these words mean like amyloidosis and pre-onogenesis and what they don't mean so that

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:19.900
we can understand when we're being bamboozled and when we aren't so again thank you very much and

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:27.180
I'll see you again soon
