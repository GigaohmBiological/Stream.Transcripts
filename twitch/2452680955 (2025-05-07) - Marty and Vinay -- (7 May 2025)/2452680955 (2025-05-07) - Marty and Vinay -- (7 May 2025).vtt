WEBVTT

00:22.946 --> 00:24.347
Test one, two, testing.

00:24.367 --> 00:25.208
Good morning, everybody.

00:25.248 --> 00:25.968
How are you doing?

00:26.008 --> 00:26.989
Welcome to the show.

00:33.983 --> 00:36.184
Baa Baa Baa Baa

01:06.135 --> 01:34.053
Come with me, come with me And we shall run across the sky Illuminate the night I will try and guide you To better times, brighter days Don't be afraid to go Up the ladder to the roof Where we can see heaven much better Go up the ladder to the roof

01:41.883 --> 01:42.824
Stay with me.

01:43.124 --> 01:43.965
Stay with me.

01:44.005 --> 01:44.906
Stay with me.

01:45.186 --> 01:48.188
And we shall let expression ring.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.490
Hear freedom in us singing.

01:51.571 --> 01:53.672
Whoa, memory.

01:53.812 --> 01:56.174
A broken dream.

01:56.254 --> 02:00.737
Don't you know, don't you know that long feet away.

02:01.638 --> 02:08.243
You'll go up the ladder to the room where we can see heaven much better.

02:08.283 --> 02:09.804
Go up the ladder to the room

02:16.459 --> 02:19.762
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go?

02:45.387 --> 03:12.106
Up the ladder to the roof Where we can see heaven much better Up the ladder to the roof We can be closer to heaven Up the ladder to heaven Come on and go Up the ladder to heaven Come on and go

03:23.878 --> 03:25.438
I don't know if that's everybody's taste.

03:25.478 --> 03:26.599
Those are the nylons.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.119
They're from like the 90s.

03:28.259 --> 03:33.060
I think that, I don't know when that was released, but anyway, that's up the ladder to the roof.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.361
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.821
This is Giga Ohm Biological.

03:36.881 --> 03:41.122
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooey coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

03:41.982 --> 03:45.023
I am in fact, the chief biologist of Giga Ohm Biological.

03:45.503 --> 03:50.564
You can find the stain of my academic work back when I was an academy magician on PubMed.

03:51.224 --> 03:53.166
using my last name and my first two initials.

03:53.186 --> 04:09.123
You can also see a lot of my work misrepresented on the substack Woodhouse 76, where they try to have fake arguments with people like Claire Craig from Hart or Pierre Corey from what was the FLCCC and now is the IMA.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.307
They also, you know, have arguments or discussions with Mike Eden and

04:13.767 --> 04:16.388
and pretend to be Jay Bhattacharya's long-lost friend.

04:17.548 --> 04:39.576
Anyway, the point is, is that you can also see sort of where I've been because not only did I get fired from a university medical school for speaking out about the pandemic, but when then I learned enough biology to know exactly how bad it was, Children's Health Defense actually let me go, which is really odd because I have a unblemished track record of good service as a

04:40.376 --> 04:46.060
as a scientific advisor to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which culminated in the publishing of the Wuhan coverup.

04:46.560 --> 04:53.104
And after CHD hired me, apparently I became some kind of meddler and a shithead that they fired me.

04:53.564 --> 04:54.365
I don't know what to say.

04:54.385 --> 04:58.987
I've also been to a few barbecues with a guy by the name of Jay Bhattacharya.

04:59.027 --> 05:01.189
I think he's got a job somewhere now.

05:01.749 --> 05:07.172
And anyway, he knows a lot about what I've done over the last five years, because we've talked about it over tacos.

05:07.252 --> 05:07.773
It's crazy.

05:08.773 --> 05:14.498
Anyway, let's start the show here in December of 2021 with our friends.

05:16.599 --> 05:19.742
I think you'll recognize ZDogg there on the left.

05:20.482 --> 05:30.650
And Vinay Prasad, a guy who's going to be the head of the Center for Biologics Research something something at the FDA, which is an extraordinary position.

05:31.531 --> 05:50.383
for someone to get as a result of essentially being both apparently a tenure-track professor at Stanford and also an avid YouTuber and often sidekick of ZDogg, a long track record of some serious

05:51.980 --> 05:53.701
some serious bad YouTube videos.

05:53.841 --> 06:00.723
Anyway, uh, without further ado, I'm sure you can already, uh, I gotta, I don't even know if I did this.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.743
I gotta see if I, I don't think I did this.

06:02.823 --> 06:04.244
I gotta set this one up here.

06:04.264 --> 06:09.945
I'm pretty sure I'm going to need to do this because I didn't do it.

06:10.105 --> 06:13.466
So I'll go like this and yep, exactly what I thought.

06:13.486 --> 06:15.067
I'm going to make that a little bigger.

06:16.229 --> 06:19.653
And then I'm going to focus in on where I'm sitting with a book.

06:19.894 --> 06:25.581
This is just a little trick you do when you don't have a guy helping you out, some kind of producer behind the scenes.

06:26.442 --> 06:32.910
I don't know if you want to read this book or anything like that, but I'll use this book to focus it just so I can see where my head's going to be.

06:32.930 --> 06:33.972
There we go.

06:36.121 --> 06:56.008
there he is hello this is december 24 2021 excuse me and i'm gonna enjoy my coffee and take some notes or laugh or whatever it is it's gonna happen here of course in december of 2021 is one of the first times maybe the first times i think it's one of the first times that marty mccarty

06:56.628 --> 07:16.947
will join ZDogg and Vinay and there's all kinds of interesting things that will be spilled number one in this video that I heard when I was pre-listening to it while I was getting stuff ready and going back and forth trying to get my water bottle whatever it doesn't matter I have it playing in the background so I can kind of get where they're gonna go what the vibe of the video is

07:17.607 --> 07:22.050
And I heard that Marty is actually from Egypt, which is so cool.

07:22.150 --> 07:22.971
I didn't know that.

07:22.991 --> 07:26.693
I don't think they made a big deal about that when they were confirming him.

07:30.396 --> 07:31.857
Coffee is just a little cold.

07:32.762 --> 07:35.563
boiling water to coffee from this morning.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.865
And I guess that was a failed alchemy experiment.

07:38.965 --> 07:41.426
Anyway, it'll be good enough because it's in a thermal mug.

07:41.486 --> 07:42.367
Don't worry about me.

07:42.407 --> 07:43.047
I'll be fine.

07:43.107 --> 07:43.908
Thanks for joining me.

07:43.968 --> 07:44.428
Here we go.

07:44.448 --> 07:48.030
Oh gosh, I'm afraid to be honest.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.071
I'm quite afraid to hit the arrow.

07:50.991 --> 07:57.114
Hey guys, it's ZDoggMD, VPMD Vinay Prasad, Marty McCary.

07:57.354 --> 07:57.835
Three M's.

07:58.215 --> 07:59.235
Three M's.

07:59.275 --> 08:00.336
Good to see you guys.

08:00.356 --> 08:05.058
Dude, we're the three horsemen of the COVID apocalypse according to pretty much everybody.

08:05.098 --> 08:06.339
We're doing a show, we're going to talk about all things.

08:06.359 --> 08:10.821
We're going to talk about therapeutics, boosters, we're going to talk about Omicron.

08:11.181 --> 08:16.065
I like to say I put the accent on the wrong syllable because it sounds more like a Decepticon than ever.

08:16.806 --> 08:18.767
And we're going to talk about why we're sitting so close together.

08:20.449 --> 08:25.893
I mean, the number of jokes already is really kind of atrocious, is it not?

08:26.614 --> 08:33.960
I'm going to sit down here small for a little bit so that you can copy down my address where you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to get a little

08:34.620 --> 08:40.282
Velcro tactical patch of giga ohm biological or a couple stickers to put on your car or your water bottle.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.343
And that zip code is 15102.

08:45.204 --> 08:46.944
They're going for a comedy show here.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.906
They're trying to project a very specific energy.

08:52.412 --> 09:09.646
And of course, what I've been trying to teach everyone for a long time, and I hope that I'm making it very clear, if you do what I do, or Mark Kulak does, or what Joe Marshall does, and you go on screen all by yourself, you better darn well have something to say.

09:11.010 --> 09:22.695
Now, I can see where there's gonna be lots of people, of course, who are gonna pretend like I have had nothing to say for five years, but those of you who have been following me and have been here for five years know where we are.

09:23.155 --> 09:40.542
This is a crucial tipping point where people that we have seen coming, people that we have looked at their timeline and seen them coming, and it's really remarkable that we are at a stage where not only is this guy getting a very high appointment in the FDA,

09:42.005 --> 09:49.792
But Stephen Hatfield is going to be a pandemic advisor to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

09:51.393 --> 09:52.354
Whatever that means.

09:54.315 --> 09:56.577
Whatever it means when you're the advisor to the

09:57.614 --> 09:59.615
to the mouse at Chuck E. Cheese.

09:59.755 --> 10:09.418
Like, it's crazy where we are, and I'm very frightened by where we are, but at the same time, I think it's really important that we stay centered.

10:10.158 --> 10:16.060
And since this is the ball that they want to put in front of us, we don't want to play the ball in the way that they want us to play it.

10:16.100 --> 10:26.523
We have to play it our way, and our way is going back in time and looking at what these people were saying in 2020 and 2021 when the murder was happening in America.

10:27.657 --> 10:28.858
He doesn't have a third microphone.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.398
He doesn't have a third microphone.

10:30.418 --> 10:32.960
You know, my supporters fund the show and they're cheap.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.380
They're so cheap.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.161
All these resources.

10:35.581 --> 10:37.622
Yeah, we're right on the show.

10:37.642 --> 10:39.763
Is this an unboosted contact?

10:39.863 --> 10:44.445
We're unmasked, unboosted, and unrepentant, Marty.

10:47.026 --> 10:55.491
I mean, is this not already pretty macabre, given where we are now, where I think all these guys would say, well, I would have, I would have, I don't know if I would,

10:57.853 --> 11:00.774
They're laughing about not being boosted.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.835
It ain't going to get better.

11:04.856 --> 11:06.016
Well, I'm an unboosted male.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.497
That's my preferred pronoun, by the way.

11:07.537 --> 11:08.317
Oh, is that your pronoun?

11:08.377 --> 11:09.158
Unboosted male?

11:09.218 --> 11:09.398
Yes.

11:09.558 --> 11:11.879
I wonder if he said that at his confirmation hearing.

11:15.810 --> 11:22.334
My pronouns are it, they, those, and currently unboosted because I got Moderna, which apparently kicks ass.

11:22.974 --> 11:23.855
It's a good vaccine.

11:24.495 --> 11:24.615
I'm 48.

11:24.995 --> 11:26.636
I don't have a lot of comorbidities.

11:26.776 --> 11:28.817
I have some clotting stuff, but I've never clotted.

11:28.877 --> 11:31.339
It's just like theoretical, 23andMe, thank you very much.

11:31.379 --> 11:32.419
So how about you?

11:32.479 --> 11:32.940
You boosted?

11:33.980 --> 11:38.443
So he just plugged 23andMe as telling him he has a propensity for clotting.

11:40.844 --> 11:44.586
So he's telling us a genetic story about the propensity for clotting?

11:45.874 --> 11:55.379
when in the future there will be a story about the mRNA shot causing clotting or the vaccine causing clotting or the virus causing clotting.

11:56.599 --> 11:59.741
And of course, right now they're talking about the virus causing clotting.

12:03.303 --> 12:08.205
And mixing them all together with very little precision on purpose.

12:09.246 --> 12:10.346
In 2021, ladies and gentlemen,

12:13.953 --> 12:17.214
This is at the end of the two years of murder.

12:17.234 --> 12:32.079
I mean, let's just, I'm gonna escape for a second here and I'm gonna go to a slide that has the calendar on it with the deaths.

12:35.260 --> 12:36.861
Hopefully this video won't start.

12:37.861 --> 12:41.302
If it does, I'll pause it right away.

12:43.109 --> 12:48.032
So I'm going to show you a video later in another show, or maybe today, depending on how well this goes.

12:48.072 --> 12:52.535
I don't think it's going to go well enough for me to get this far from April of 2017.

12:54.276 --> 12:58.319
But where we're talking about right now is the end of 2020.

13:00.840 --> 13:06.624
Here you can see on the bottom the, let me get my, you can see on the bottom here, the little stripes that represent the year.

13:07.145 --> 13:10.267
So we're at the end of 2021, which is right here.

13:10.327 --> 13:12.108
So there's still a spring of murder.

13:12.955 --> 13:13.655
It's going to happen.

13:14.656 --> 13:19.098
We're right here, December of 2021, when these guys are talking.

13:19.378 --> 13:24.200
So there's still a little murder left to happen, but quite a bit of murder has already happened.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.622
And any of these guys have had a year to figure it out.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.384
And they are instead laughing about not being boosted, right?

13:31.484 --> 13:33.245
That's where we are in this little shtick.

13:34.695 --> 13:35.616
And it's pretty dark.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.636
It's definitely, definitely dark.

13:37.916 --> 13:45.459
I mean, look at the way that they decided to thumbnail the video and start the video with this intense laughter.

13:45.499 --> 13:51.781
I'll play it again just for the, for it to emphasize how macabre it is that there is a pandemic going on.

13:51.861 --> 13:57.183
They have been, they have been bullying healthcare workers and old people

13:58.917 --> 14:04.363
and college kids into fully accepting this narrative about a novel virus.

14:04.423 --> 14:09.027
College kids are masking, they're testing every week, they're isolating if they test positive.

14:10.629 --> 14:20.519
And the Saturday Night Live is about to make fun of the fact that the old people get the good vaccines and the young people are gonna get what's left, and it's Johnson and Johnson.

14:21.957 --> 14:32.873
This is all kind of the timeframe where we're at right now, where this is the winter of severe disease and death for the unvaccinated.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.275
That's the winter that this is.

14:35.297 --> 14:36.018
Think about that.

14:43.021 --> 14:49.144
Hey guys, it's ZDoggMD, VPMD Vinay Prasad, Marty McCary.

14:49.384 --> 14:49.865
Three M's.

14:50.245 --> 14:50.925
Three M's.

14:50.945 --> 14:51.565
Good to see you guys.

14:51.946 --> 14:52.626
Good to see you Marty.

14:52.646 --> 14:57.108
We're the three horsemen of the COVID apocalypse according to pretty much everybody.

14:57.128 --> 14:58.389
We're doing a show, we're gonna talk about all things.

14:58.409 --> 15:02.851
We're gonna talk about therapeutics, boosters, we're gonna talk about Omicron.

15:03.211 --> 15:08.094
I like to say I put the accent on the wrong syllable because it sounds more like a Decepticon than ever.

15:08.814 --> 15:10.795
And we're gonna talk about why we're sitting so close together.

15:10.815 --> 15:12.256
Why don't you start?

15:12.336 --> 15:13.517
He doesn't have a third microphone.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.277
You don't have a third microphone.

15:15.518 --> 15:17.659
My supporters fund the show and they're cheap.

15:17.739 --> 15:19.059
They're so cheap.

15:19.120 --> 15:19.840
All these resources.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.281
You guys boosted being that close.

15:22.301 --> 15:24.442
Is this an unboosted contact?

15:24.542 --> 15:28.244
We're unmasked, unboosted, and unrepentant, Marty.

15:29.961 --> 15:31.223
I mean, let's be realistic.

15:31.283 --> 15:34.848
How far are we away from him having a spot in his department?

15:37.912 --> 15:39.414
I mean, why would it be absurd?

15:40.175 --> 15:41.077
Marty hired him.

15:45.273 --> 15:46.434
Well, I'm an unboosted male.

15:46.474 --> 15:47.894
That's my preferred pronoun, by the way.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.575
Oh, is that your pronoun, unboosted male?

15:49.635 --> 15:56.859
Yes, my pronouns are it, they, those, and currently unboosted because I got Moderna, which apparently kicks ass.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.380
It's a good vaccine.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.161
I'm 48, I don't have a lot of comorbidities.

16:01.302 --> 16:03.343
I have some clotting stuff, but I've never clotted.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.864
It's just like theoretical, 23andMe, thank you very much.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.465
So how about you, are you boosted?

16:07.765 --> 16:08.705
You know too much about yourself.

16:09.726 --> 16:11.427
It's a HIPAA violation to ask someone if they're,

16:12.877 --> 16:14.758
Yeah, nevermind, nevermind, you don't have to say it.

16:14.778 --> 16:16.319
Privacy is dead, my friend.

16:16.339 --> 16:17.519
Privacy is dead right now.

16:17.539 --> 16:19.280
But I do see that people do say that.

16:19.320 --> 16:19.940
That's not true.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.981
You can of course ask anyone their status, but no, I haven't gotten my booster yet.

16:24.462 --> 16:28.003
You mean this week you haven't gotten, because you do weekly boosters, I'm sure, right?

16:28.023 --> 16:29.744
Well, eventually we're all going to have to keep boosting.

16:29.884 --> 16:36.327
You know, my vaccine card looks like one of those frequent flyer coffee cards where they punch the hole.

16:36.707 --> 16:43.509
Like I boosted here, and boosted here, and boosted here, and when I get 10 boosters, Fauci sends me a Fauci bobblehead that says, I am the science.

16:43.809 --> 16:48.110
I'm getting my booster sent with the GNC nutrition vitamins.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.411
They have the same evidence.

16:56.873 --> 17:00.514
I mean, do you understand what's happening here?

17:02.972 --> 17:17.683
They're making jokes like at such a rapid fire pace between each other to try and create an illusion of consensus that number one, number one, that this is not scripted, which it most certainly is.

17:18.464 --> 17:19.825
It most certainly is scripted.

17:23.327 --> 17:27.050
They've either rehearsed it or they've looked over the questions or they know the answers.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.451
It's, this is gross.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.892
These are three actors.

17:30.913 --> 17:32.174
They are auditioning.

17:33.117 --> 17:38.819
for the roles that they now have in the state theater that is whatever the Trump administration is.

17:39.919 --> 17:40.960
This is quite frightening.

17:41.220 --> 17:44.261
I don't like being this kind of messenger, but this is real.

17:45.421 --> 17:46.642
It's plain as day.

17:47.922 --> 17:49.503
There's no other way to explain this.

17:49.543 --> 17:58.726
This is an active audition done December 21 with a given script that they know they can't use incorrectly

17:59.710 --> 18:10.584
and with big ideas they know they're supposed to laugh at, big ideas they know they're supposed to confuse and confound, and irrelevant things that they're supposed to argue about.

18:11.245 --> 18:13.407
I can guarantee it, and I haven't watched it.

18:14.229 --> 18:17.792
I listened to it from the bathroom for about 10 minutes.

18:17.832 --> 18:19.453
So we're almost done with what I saw.

18:19.493 --> 18:19.873
Or listened to.

18:19.913 --> 18:25.697
What are the odds we are canceled now with the three time canceling incumbents?

18:25.737 --> 18:29.040
I get yelled at for platforming each one of you separately.

18:29.540 --> 18:34.784
Now all we need to do is bring Jay Bhattacharya and Monica Gandhi here and we'll have like the horsemen of the apocalypse.

18:35.325 --> 18:36.585
And Twitter will just melt.

18:36.645 --> 18:37.746
It will just turn into goo.

18:37.866 --> 18:42.490
Did he just say Jay Bhattacharya and that, oh my gosh.

18:46.994 --> 18:50.616
Oh my gosh, I mean it's, I just don't even, I don't even know where to start.

18:51.697 --> 18:52.758
It's just remarkable.

18:52.798 --> 18:57.461
It's like every sentence I should really pause it to point out what he just said and how remarkable it is.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.963
He just said Jay Bhattacharya's name.

19:02.363 --> 19:05.026
So, the booster thing, what is the deal with that, Marty?

19:05.947 --> 19:15.776
Yeah, everybody forgot that the FDA external experts voted down boosters for everybody by a 16 to 2 vote just nine weeks ago.

19:16.516 --> 19:22.262
And then all of a sudden, there's a variant that came maybe from South Africa,

19:23.539 --> 19:30.609
And the immediate first response we have is we got to boost every single adult even if they had a natural immunity from prior infection.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.372
It's almost as if we've come.

19:33.693 --> 19:41.183
There's no association whatsoever between boosting a young healthy person and Omicron because we haven't done we haven't data on.

19:41.203 --> 19:42.424
We don't know anything about it, right?

19:42.444 --> 19:43.165
Yeah, we know nothing.

19:43.245 --> 19:47.889
I mean, I think that's the paradox of what they were saying, was they were saying that, you know, we don't know anything about this.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.853
At the same time, we have information that changes our booster recommendation.

19:51.873 --> 19:52.714
Both those things can't be true.

19:52.754 --> 19:55.857
If you have no new information about the variant, you can't change your recommendation.

19:56.197 --> 19:57.879
So what's the primary message here?

19:57.919 --> 19:58.800
Does anybody hear it?

20:00.081 --> 20:06.207
There is a new variant called Omicron, and all three of these geniuses agree on that.

20:09.144 --> 20:10.467
I hope you can really see that.

20:10.527 --> 20:20.586
That's really important, that this whole debate and their charming demeanor and banter, there is an underlying assumption in it.

20:21.687 --> 20:42.133
that if your dad or your mom or your brother, who's never seen my show before, nevermind watched it for five years, if they see this, then that underlying assumption is what gets put into their head as they try to listen to the conversation and understand what these people are saying.

20:42.773 --> 20:49.555
Because the underlying assumptions of a conversation like this are precisely the enchantment.

20:50.595 --> 21:04.106
And so if this conversation is scripted well enough, the enchantment can almost be like 99% effective on the people that watch it, provided they don't have the requisite knowledge to know that they're full of shit.

21:06.207 --> 21:11.171
Just imagine three guys talking about poker and how to win poker if you don't play poker.

21:12.072 --> 21:17.937
Just imagine three guys talking about how to juice up a sport bike if you're not a mechanic.

21:19.127 --> 21:25.731
Just think about three guys talking about how to choose the right deer rifle if you're not a hunter.

21:27.071 --> 21:38.998
Think about that because that's what these three guys are doing with respect to the existence of a virus, the necessity of a response, and whether or not it's good doesn't even matter.

21:40.740 --> 21:43.222
and the relevance of vaccination.

21:43.502 --> 21:44.503
They're all three.

21:44.563 --> 21:49.246
Those assumptions are just rock solid through this whole comedy routine.

21:49.647 --> 21:51.288
And that is the enchantment.

21:51.408 --> 21:54.070
And that is why this is an audition.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.672
You should see it as an audition.

21:57.092 --> 21:59.814
They are demonstrating how valuable they could be.

22:05.097 --> 22:07.118
And the better they do, the higher they rise.

22:07.198 --> 22:10.358
And these guys are now at the FDA.

22:10.378 --> 22:19.341
Otherwise, you could have changed it three weeks ago, but there's a reason why they voted against it.

22:19.561 --> 22:20.861
You want to get into that?

22:21.041 --> 22:24.662
Why did they not say a 20-year-old man who doesn't work in healthcare?

22:24.862 --> 22:33.525
You know, so they did have an allowance for 18 and up if you worked in healthcare, but if you don't work in healthcare, the committee did not want those people to be boosted nine weeks ago, as you say.

22:34.517 --> 22:39.579
We're blurring, you know, when people say boost people who are over, who are over age.

22:39.720 --> 22:46.723
They are talking about whether someone needs a third hit in the head from a baseball bat.

22:50.385 --> 22:54.066
And debating whether or not it's appropriate for what age group.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.468
You have to see it for what it is.

22:57.188 --> 23:01.290
The underlying assumption here is that they are debating a relevant medicine.

23:04.778 --> 23:05.999
65.

23:04.978 --> 23:05.999
Yes, definitely.

23:06.019 --> 23:08.139
At least that'll reduce their risk, right?

23:08.179 --> 23:11.120
And by the way, it's important to quantify what that reduction is.

23:11.581 --> 23:16.782
It's a tenfold reduction in hospitalization from an already very low risk of hospitalization.

23:16.822 --> 23:21.144
So what is the risk of hospitalization in a fully vaccinated American?

23:22.227 --> 23:25.248
According to the CDC website, it's one in 26,000.

23:25.408 --> 23:28.349
It's 3.8 per 100,000 per week.

23:28.789 --> 23:30.350
And that was at the peak of Delta, by the way.

23:30.390 --> 23:31.730
That was early September.

23:32.871 --> 23:44.315
Again, reinforcing the fact that there are variants that we can track and that those variants can have different attributes depending on the precise sequence of their RNA.

23:44.855 --> 23:45.555
Stop lying!

23:47.745 --> 23:58.972
For sure, the thing about it is, is this surgeon doesn't know jack all about those ideas and could not get up to a whiteboard and explain himself about this.

23:59.093 --> 24:00.513
He is following a script.

24:00.954 --> 24:02.655
He's saying what he's told to say.

24:03.095 --> 24:09.079
And that's what people who go to medical school and succeed are really good at doing.

24:09.640 --> 24:14.583
They're good at remembering flow charts and giving you the right answer in the right circumstances.

24:15.714 --> 24:25.759
And so they're also really good semi-fake improvisational actors, because depending on the scenario, they know to say yes, but instead of no.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.361
It's a real magic trick, ladies and gentlemen.

24:31.462 --> 24:33.783
It's a little neuro-linguistic programming.

24:33.843 --> 24:42.727
It's a little bit of stage, you know, stage acting, and it's a whole lot of practice on the same script.

24:45.782 --> 25:06.468
It's absolutely no different than how I progressed from being a guy who thought it was a lab leak and needed to teach everybody about what viruses were and what gain of function was to realizing that that was the trap and understanding that there's no real biological basis for those ideas other than all these people agree there is.

25:08.968 --> 25:10.809
It took me five years to get there.

25:12.609 --> 25:14.390
And do you see a genuine

25:16.363 --> 25:25.049
let's say journey from 2020 when we didn't know what was going on to 2000, the end of 2021.

25:25.630 --> 25:28.632
Do you see a guys that have been on a journey?

25:29.533 --> 25:33.576
Do you see guys that have lost things because they spoke up?

25:34.937 --> 25:37.959
Where's the happiness here?

25:38.519 --> 25:41.181
The, you know, snappiness here.

25:42.382 --> 25:43.403
There's no loss.

25:45.657 --> 25:46.977
There's no bleak outlook.

25:48.258 --> 25:50.399
There's no nothing.

25:51.419 --> 25:57.201
This is like a discussion about the weather and whether or not the wind mattered for the America's Cup or not.

25:57.881 --> 25:58.841
It's remarkable.

26:00.482 --> 26:02.302
There's no compassion here.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.164
Old people have died alone for a year and a half.

26:08.264 --> 26:13.406
More than 150,000 Americans have died of opiates in the last two years.

26:17.725 --> 26:22.030
And all they can do is discuss the variants and make funny names about them?

26:23.371 --> 26:26.394
And now these guys are supposed to be the adults in the room?

26:27.395 --> 26:28.356
Come on, guys.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.519
America needs to wake up.

26:32.756 --> 26:44.404
So if I told you, hey, you've got a level of protection where the risk of hospitalization is one in 26,000, I'm going to give you the option to lower that to one in 260,000.

26:45.325 --> 26:46.986
Some people might say yes.

26:47.466 --> 26:55.552
Other people might say there are side effects and ultra rare serious complications.

26:55.692 --> 26:58.174
I'm OK with the risk tolerance of one in 26,000.

26:58.935 --> 27:00.576
By the way, who is that one person?

27:00.996 --> 27:05.033
I am, just wanted to acknowledge for free reign in the chat.

27:07.191 --> 27:14.996
I do think that they rolled out J&J first and And the other one what was it in in the UK?

27:16.277 --> 27:17.878
Come on, somebody put it in the chat.

27:17.898 --> 27:19.059
What was the one in the UK?

27:19.079 --> 27:25.002
It was the same kind of thing, but it would had a different name They rolled out those first on purpose.

27:25.162 --> 27:30.466
Yes AstraZeneca they rolled those out first on purpose because

27:31.306 --> 27:40.850
They knew already they were going to withdraw those as part of a show to say, hey, you know, we said we were serious about safety and look at us.

27:41.290 --> 27:45.091
We're withdrawing a whole emergency product line.

27:45.472 --> 27:47.352
You know, that's definitely part of the show.

27:47.713 --> 27:55.476
Out of every 26,000, the only state that gives us a breakdown of breakthrough hospitalizations, North Dakota.

27:56.856 --> 28:00.620
tells us the average age is 73 and the average age of a breakthrough death is 80.

28:03.622 --> 28:09.247
And if you look at a population of 80 year olds, their time to death in general is not that long.

28:09.687 --> 28:14.511
So it's kind of like, what are we really doing in terms of vaccinating healthy young people?

28:14.551 --> 28:17.274
Their time to death is not that long.

28:20.734 --> 28:24.118
So he's kind of thinking about the population pyramid in a way.

28:24.498 --> 28:28.422
He's kind of touching on talking points that the population pyramid speaks to.

28:28.983 --> 28:39.494
Is this an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that's being misconstrued as an RNA pandemic to create a crisis that doesn't exist and only a little murder and lies would be necessary?

28:39.614 --> 28:41.296
Only a few actors in place.

28:42.742 --> 28:44.202
Can you see it, ladies and gentlemen?

28:44.242 --> 28:45.083
Can you see it?

28:45.603 --> 28:47.383
People in terms of boosters, right?

28:47.703 --> 28:53.405
Look, I understand the argument to vaccinate healthy young people as a herd effect and a community benefit.

28:53.445 --> 28:56.426
And also some of those kids will actually get sick.

28:57.086 --> 28:57.886
Isn't that awesome?

28:57.966 --> 29:00.627
I understand the need to vaccinate healthy people.

29:01.187 --> 29:05.553
That is spectacular because that's the exact opposite of what I am arguing now.

29:06.153 --> 29:15.986
Thanks to five years of study, I don't believe that intramuscular injection is a logical way nor a rational way to deliver any combination of substances and call it medicine.

29:18.795 --> 29:23.657
And whether or not this guy is sophisticated enough to understand it, I kind of doubt it.

29:24.077 --> 29:27.818
I think he's happy to go along because it's a simple thing to understand.

29:27.898 --> 29:31.059
It's a simple cartoon to teach other people.

29:31.779 --> 29:36.981
I know because I did it for a couple years thinking that I really learned this stuff.

29:37.021 --> 29:41.783
And I read all these figures and all these papers about virology.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.003
So I know how this works.

29:46.803 --> 29:50.085
It took a really long time for me to be able to step back.

29:50.145 --> 30:09.418
And so it's going to take a lot of work for us to put together a book or a set of texts that's going to allow people to read it and try to step back, especially because so many people have read books like this and heard people like this talk, where for the last 20 minutes,

30:10.629 --> 30:14.151
The underlying assumptions are the vaccine schedule is amazing.

30:14.211 --> 30:15.532
The new vaccine works.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.194
It's just a question of whether you need a booster or not.

30:19.855 --> 30:20.735
COVID is real.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.336
The variants are real.

30:22.976 --> 30:25.458
And Omicron is apparently less dangerous than Delta.

30:27.870 --> 30:31.954
be a small number, but they'll get sick and they'll clog up the hospitals and that kind of thing.

30:31.974 --> 30:33.476
And they'll expose grandma and so on.

30:33.516 --> 30:36.479
But that's why you vaccinate them with the two doses.

30:36.499 --> 30:37.540
With the primary series, right?

30:37.560 --> 30:38.080
Exactly.

30:38.140 --> 30:45.708
But I guess, Marty, your point is, and the figures you're giving, that I think if anything, somebody might say that those are like the upper bound figures of risk reduction from boosting, right?

30:46.008 --> 30:50.813
You're talking about, I think, Israeli data is what it sounds like to me, like the Israeli real world data for that figure.

30:50.933 --> 30:59.279
On the tenfold reduction that comes out of Israel, on the rate of breakthrough hospitalizations being one in 26,000, that's right from the CDC's website.

30:59.579 --> 31:11.668
But those are right from the CDC's website, but it's Israeli data, the data that they had a whole, you know, they had a central system already and they offered it to Pfizer freely.

31:11.748 --> 31:14.509
Like, let Israel be the laboratory of the world.

31:15.430 --> 31:25.873
And now the CDC is using that data to justify its recommendations to the American public that somehow or another the hospitalizations went down in people that took the vaccine.

31:25.893 --> 31:27.714
But who didn't take the vaccine in Israel?

31:31.295 --> 31:35.096
There were lines around the block that they showed us on the internet.

31:37.042 --> 31:39.644
We were supposed to think it was unfair that they got it first.

31:39.684 --> 31:40.664
Don't you remember this?

31:40.724 --> 31:43.086
You gotta keep this in mind, ladies and gentlemen.

31:43.126 --> 31:45.247
They played us like a fiddle.

31:46.428 --> 31:47.649
And these guys helped.

31:47.849 --> 31:53.893
That's why he is in the FDA right now and just hired that brown-haired child.

31:55.399 --> 31:59.403
people with medical conditions, special situations, or very old people.

31:59.743 --> 32:11.553
But your point is well taken, which is that people should know that the people who we think should be boosted, older people, people were older, older people in this age group, that that that's the kind of ballpark risks you're talking about.

32:11.613 --> 32:11.973
That's right.

32:12.094 --> 32:13.074
Now you start to extract.

32:13.134 --> 32:13.815
Here's the thing.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.898
And this is why I'm still optimistic as an American.

32:17.765 --> 32:19.226
They are doing this on purpose.

32:19.286 --> 32:21.707
They are putting somebody like Marty there on purpose.

32:21.727 --> 32:24.268
They're putting somebody like him in there on purpose.

32:24.308 --> 32:27.849
They're putting someone like Hatfield in his position on purpose.

32:28.329 --> 32:31.751
And unfortunately they put Bobby Kennedy in his position on purpose.

32:32.991 --> 32:36.293
Because in those positions, they basically have to do what they're told.

32:36.893 --> 32:46.697
If they want to rise, if they want to be in the next administration, if they want to be appointed somewhere else, or if they would like to get a job with big pharma,

32:48.183 --> 32:49.764
They're going to have to do what they're told.

32:51.326 --> 32:57.410
And these guys are just very happy to be budding members of the ruling class in their own mind.

32:58.051 --> 33:01.193
I assure you, these are not public servants.

33:01.374 --> 33:03.595
These guys do not have an agenda in mind.

33:04.056 --> 33:10.521
If you asked Vinay Prasad, what would you do if we put you at the head of the Center for Biologics and Research or whatever the hell it's called?

33:11.562 --> 33:12.563
What would he, why?

33:12.583 --> 33:13.624
Why him?

33:17.790 --> 33:20.773
You want to give him funding to do his podcast, I get that.

33:23.736 --> 33:30.602
But I don't understand what the argument would be for a guy who's published papers that are absolutely meaningless, like lots of them.

33:31.603 --> 33:33.946
Look at his PubMed record versus mine.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.007
Just compare them.

33:36.084 --> 33:39.925
One of us was a basic scientist and never represented himself as anything else.

33:40.405 --> 33:49.567
And the other one has gone from being a podcaster and a basically fraudulent academic to the FDA.

33:51.627 --> 34:01.509
By working during the pandemic with a guy like him, it's really dark times in America.

34:05.697 --> 34:09.499
And a lot of it has to do with how we are under the trap of social media.

34:09.979 --> 34:14.622
There's no way for me to compete with them if I have to compete with them on YouTube.

34:14.702 --> 34:15.583
There's just no way.

34:15.643 --> 34:20.305
The same 300 people are going to see this livestream that have seen all the other ones and none more.

34:20.946 --> 34:24.668
Every day I lose 2 YouTube subscribers and gain 2.

34:25.388 --> 34:26.449
Every single day.

34:28.015 --> 34:30.078
You can just see the line go like this.

34:30.118 --> 34:35.704
There's never going to be a continuous rise of subscribers for GigaOM Biological.

34:35.725 --> 34:46.117
It doesn't matter how funny I get or how varied the programming becomes because there is a block

34:47.125 --> 34:49.809
on people being able to see this unless they are given it.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.892
And so if you wanna help this stream, you gotta give it away.

34:52.932 --> 34:54.374
You gotta post it places.

34:54.855 --> 34:58.459
You gotta go to my Twitter and retweet everything that I tweet.

34:59.020 --> 35:05.909
Anything that you don't like, don't retweet it, but just you have to do the work of sharing my stuff because I can't do it.

35:06.789 --> 35:15.018
I can be live on Rumble, live on YouTube, live on my own website, and my own website will always get consistently more and more and more hits.

35:15.639 --> 35:17.662
Every other website, it stays the same.

35:18.923 --> 35:20.044
That's the remarkable thing.

35:20.084 --> 35:23.648
The only growth I've ever seen was when I finally started my own PeerTube.

35:24.457 --> 35:32.001
Before that, there was no growth on Twitter, no growth on YouTube, no growth anywhere that I tried to put stuff.

35:32.221 --> 35:36.184
Even Twitch, I'm still stuck at 3,100 followers.

35:36.304 --> 35:37.084
Think about this.

35:37.725 --> 35:41.127
This is the real kind of censorship that goes on.

35:41.167 --> 35:45.289
If you get to go on Tucker Carlson and complain about censorship, you're not being censored.

35:46.696 --> 35:55.408
If you're regularly named as one of the top 12 spreaders of misinformation in America by all of the morning news programs, you're not being censored.

36:00.535 --> 36:03.238
I belate that to a 25-year-old who's healthy.

36:04.278 --> 36:07.161
Can you give us a sense of the numerical risk reduction for such a person?

36:07.362 --> 36:09.524
I mean, the initial risk is probably as low to zero as you can.

36:09.544 --> 36:10.185
Well, that's right.

36:10.225 --> 36:21.878
If it's one in 26,000 overall, and we know people with a risk profile like- I mean, think about how exhausting this would be for your mom and dad to try and think, oh, wow, if I have to learn this.

36:22.850 --> 36:26.733
to understand what you do, son, I guess I don't really, I don't know.

36:27.093 --> 36:38.061
Or more importantly, imagine you're in my parents' position and they think that my son is arrogant for trying to think that he can argue with these people.

36:39.421 --> 36:40.362
We know our son.

36:44.365 --> 36:46.706
And that's because they're on social media too.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.748
They're watching television all the time.

36:50.242 --> 37:00.889
So all the way in 2021, they were already ready to just say, you know what, you lost your job at a university and you want us to believe you're the right guy?

37:00.969 --> 37:01.589
I like, come on.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.732
The whole world says there's a pandemic right now.

37:06.212 --> 37:09.915
And we're supposed to pretend you're supposed, you're pretending that, you know, what's happening.

37:09.995 --> 37:10.355
Come on.

37:16.274 --> 37:17.735
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen.

37:17.776 --> 37:26.805
We are exactly where I thought we would be, but the characters that are rising to the top are just, I can't, I didn't expect it to be this blatant.

37:27.927 --> 37:30.990
Olin Powell had, are those people.

37:31.490 --> 37:42.882
Then what does that tell you about how skewed it is on the other end towards younger and healthy people, yet UMass Amherst just announced they're going to require boosters for every student.

37:42.902 --> 37:49.268
So you've got young, healthy people who arguably could have been okay with maybe one dose,

37:49.648 --> 37:57.910
Now remember, the vast majority of these are placebo, or even more, you can imagine that the boosters were placebo, just to make sure.

37:57.930 --> 38:05.952
And that's part of the reason why you would definitely want to be aware of what you took, and everybody would want to see it.

38:06.012 --> 38:11.733
Because you wouldn't want to give three or four live doses to somebody, because I assure you, that would be the end.

38:14.448 --> 38:16.249
And that's the remarkable thing about this.

38:16.509 --> 38:26.475
The other data that they are getting is maybe there is a subpopulation of humans that isn't so reactive to transfection or something like that, and they can find those people.

38:26.975 --> 38:27.356
I don't know.

38:28.496 --> 38:31.018
I don't think that's very likely, to be very honest.

38:33.099 --> 38:36.261
I'm just trying to say that there are a lot of other questions that they could ask.

38:37.512 --> 38:46.379
if you throw away the assumption that all the doses are the same, or that they tried to make all the doses the same, because they most assuredly did not.

38:47.079 --> 38:56.586
The only way that the vaccine schedule has existed, the way that has existed in America up until now, is that many of those vaccines must be placebo.

38:59.388 --> 39:00.349
There's no other way.

39:01.850 --> 39:05.733
And if that sounds like a tall tale, I assure you,

39:07.498 --> 39:11.899
you need to do a couple years more work before you're going to be able to argue with it.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.420
I'm sure it's correct.

39:17.140 --> 39:24.382
I mean, depending on what you look at, but they've got natural immunity half the time, if they check for it.

39:24.822 --> 39:29.523
And now we're going to take people with natural immunity who have two doses and say you must get a third dose.

39:29.783 --> 39:30.744
OK, so there you go.

39:30.784 --> 39:32.524
That's the whole narrative, right?

39:32.664 --> 39:34.164
Natural immunity is real.

39:34.765 --> 39:36.045
You can check for it.

39:37.699 --> 39:41.182
And then two doses plus a booster, we should debate that right now.

39:45.226 --> 39:48.448
Now, I don't know what else is in this video.

39:48.488 --> 39:50.170
I want to play it as long as possible.

39:50.190 --> 39:59.738
But of course, there's another video that comes about two months after in March of 2022, that's just as upbeat and just as trying to be comedic routine.

39:59.758 --> 40:01.179
And I want to watch that one as well.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.862
before I give my brain a break in order to come here.

40:05.522 --> 40:13.848
There's this term, have to, must, that's used in such a loose way.

40:14.288 --> 40:15.769
What is that quantified risk?

40:16.529 --> 40:18.971
Maybe you're okay with the one in 26,000 risk.

40:19.511 --> 40:23.594
Maybe you're okay with the one in 100,000 risk if that's what it is skewed towards healthy people.

40:24.154 --> 40:28.317
The idea that you have to, or you must, that's the language we hear.

40:28.797 --> 40:32.858
Okay, so now we're going to start talking about the idea of mandates.

40:33.339 --> 40:44.342
And also, I want to go back to these numbers that he's throwing out and point out that, in my humble opinion, these numbers are used as bait.

40:45.423 --> 40:58.307
And they're bait because later on, these people can use those numbers or point to those numbers as part of the information required in order for someone to have informed consent.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.551
Well, we have to tell people what the risk is.

41:03.292 --> 41:09.215
That's not what informed consent is, in my humble opinion, and I think my opinion might be an expert one.

41:10.096 --> 41:24.784
Informed consent is understanding the risks, not understanding the modeled probability of the risk, not the estimated probability of the risk.

41:26.145 --> 41:27.986
You need to understand the nature

41:28.979 --> 41:29.599
of the risk.

41:30.740 --> 41:35.043
And that means understanding all of the information that can be available.

41:35.604 --> 41:50.394
And for someone to take the time and make the effort to make sure that you understand all of the information available, so that you understand the nature of the risk, not the calculated mathematical relative values of the risks.

41:53.612 --> 42:01.478
And so this is another enchantment that these three guys are very, very, very good at projecting.

42:03.260 --> 42:15.189
That these numbers are real, that you can calculate these numbers, and that these numbers might be part of the brochure titled Informed Consent on COVID Vaccination if the FDA were doing its job.

42:16.310 --> 42:16.990
Stop lying!

42:20.373 --> 42:21.194
And it's not honest.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.654
And we've seen this paternalism.

42:24.836 --> 42:27.137
You cannot accept any risk of a mild infection.

42:27.617 --> 42:30.799
We've seen that level of paternalism before in medicine.

42:30.819 --> 42:33.141
Matter of fact, we see it all throughout medicine.

42:33.161 --> 42:39.264
Like we couldn't allow women to have home pregnancy tests because we have to tell them the results.

42:39.284 --> 42:40.945
By the way, it was all men saying that.

42:42.046 --> 42:44.007
And you know, Marty, the other point that you made.

42:44.067 --> 42:47.029
The perfect illusion of consensus.

42:48.910 --> 42:54.956
Hmm, I should really find the time point of that and record that for a sound effect, wow.

43:07.509 --> 43:09.251
I think it's as close to zero as you can get.

43:09.351 --> 43:09.771
Yeah, right.

43:09.791 --> 43:11.853
Yeah, and there's no provision to even look at that.

43:12.053 --> 43:19.640
And the other thing is, I think this all dovetails into this overall culture of safetyism that has emerged, especially on college campuses.

43:19.660 --> 43:25.846
It's like, on college campuses- So we went from paternalism to safetyism now, which I find extraordinary.

43:25.886 --> 43:32.632
Like, this is not precise use of language.

43:34.315 --> 43:36.777
This is extraordinarily awful.

43:37.717 --> 43:59.791
And you need to see it as extraordinarily awful in order to put into accurate perspective the danger that America is in, given the fact that this man is now at a very influential office, supposedly, in the FDA, thanks to being appointed by the guy on the other side of the table, the Egyptian named Marty McCarty.

44:01.312 --> 44:03.173
It's unsafe to use words.

44:04.215 --> 44:10.378
Like, the one thing that we have as humans that prevent actual violence and damage.

44:10.538 --> 44:13.019
Like, instead of violence, we- It averts violence.

44:13.079 --> 44:13.760
It averts violence.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.281
We have words to avert punching each other in the face.

44:16.801 --> 44:19.963
But there are words that are the equivalent of punching someone in the face.

44:20.023 --> 44:31.168
Well, of course they're gonna say, you need two vaccines plus a booster, plus you probably should go out and get naturally infected with Omicron, which may be less severe, just to be sure, and then maybe we'll let you in.

44:31.588 --> 44:37.352
If your little shaved ice punch card is all the holes are punched, you must, right?

44:38.112 --> 44:53.962
You see that study out of Germany that of all young people age five through 17, just keep listing all the studies and all the details of the studies and make it as complicated as possible because you don't actually have a message other than that there is a novel virus.

44:54.582 --> 44:55.963
It can be sequenced.

44:56.043 --> 44:57.384
People are dying from it.

44:57.424 --> 44:58.965
It's just a question of how many.

44:59.505 --> 45:01.887
And the only way we know is if we use PCR.

45:01.967 --> 45:04.309
So I guess we'll just have to go on with it.

45:05.490 --> 45:09.314
Not a single death from COVID in a healthy person.

45:09.994 --> 45:13.858
All 100% of the deaths were clustered in people with a comorbid condition.

45:14.518 --> 45:21.664
So two years of arguing about whether or not it's just other sick people that are dying or old people are dying or fat people are dying.

45:22.125 --> 45:24.587
And here comes the big one, of course, fat people are dying.

45:25.162 --> 45:33.207
Now I've heard the CDC data is that it is three quarters of the deaths in the under 11 age group was comorbid conditions.

45:33.227 --> 45:34.628
Let me tell you something about the CDC.

45:34.968 --> 45:39.591
Most of their studies would not qualify for a seventh grade science fair project.

45:42.012 --> 45:45.114
None of them have been published in any medical journal for a reason.

45:45.834 --> 45:48.575
The conclusions cannot be made from the data.

45:48.635 --> 45:51.737
The two crack studies they put out on natural immunity.

45:52.317 --> 45:57.339
I mean, how does the medical establishment not pile on to those studies?

45:57.699 --> 46:05.743
Well, that's a good conversation because one of the studies is the one if correct me if I'm wrong, it's like among people with natural immunity, some of them chose to be vaccinated, some didn't.

46:05.883 --> 46:06.223
That's right.

46:06.283 --> 46:10.445
And both groups had like almost negligible rates of getting SARS-CoV-2.

46:10.565 --> 46:11.046
Very, very low.

46:11.066 --> 46:11.906
Less than 0.01.

46:12.086 --> 46:12.226
Right.

46:12.266 --> 46:16.288
But the group that chose to get vaccinated had a slightly even lower rate than the group that didn't.

46:16.348 --> 46:16.528
Yeah.

46:16.668 --> 46:17.709
But again, they're choosing.

46:17.729 --> 46:18.549
They're very different people.

46:18.589 --> 46:19.650
And it was a two month window.

46:19.670 --> 46:20.350
And it was a two month window.

46:20.370 --> 46:24.072
In one state of Kentucky, even though they have data on all 50 states for the whole pandemic.

46:24.192 --> 46:25.434
And they won't release the reinfection.

46:25.454 --> 46:25.654
I see.

46:25.674 --> 46:30.120
So you're saying that of all the places they could have looked, they're only looking in one place, one narrow snapshot fishing.

46:30.300 --> 46:30.500
Yes.

46:30.700 --> 46:39.431
And I guess the point is, the reason it's a flawed study is that you don't know it was the it was the vaccination that did it versus the characteristics of the type of people who sought back.

46:39.451 --> 46:40.493
So they're going to be more careful.

46:40.533 --> 46:40.793
Yeah.

46:40.833 --> 46:42.155
But to your point, quickly, before

46:42.435 --> 46:57.408
So the real flaws of the study, of course, are that they're using PCR to find something that PCR can't find and pretending that it's a high-fidelity marker that they can use to verify whether or not people are reinfected with something that PCR can never justify they're infected with.

46:57.928 --> 47:01.251
And these three guys all agree that PCR works to do that.

47:02.252 --> 47:03.833
Otherwise, the paper would mean nothing.

47:07.594 --> 47:22.403
I hope you can see how important it is that on the primary sort of strategy card for Gigaohm Biological, I'm always trying to get you to come back to what is the presupposition of this whole conversation.

47:22.823 --> 47:33.190
The presupposition of this whole conversation is that we are tracking, can track, and will continue to track a novel RNA sequence in the wild.

47:35.356 --> 47:44.523
And we're using PCR and sometimes 105 PCR reactions to either track it or sequence it.

47:47.505 --> 47:52.669
And the variants originally are a virus out of Wuhan.

47:53.050 --> 47:55.992
The change to the Delta and now is the Omicron.

47:57.605 --> 47:59.706
That is exactly where this is.

47:59.866 --> 48:05.607
And you can't forget this history because I had already lost my job for a whole year.

48:05.687 --> 48:13.850
I had already been writing letters to the people that I worked with in other labs trying to say, hey, dudes, don't transfect yourself, please.

48:18.391 --> 48:26.293
I actually got a letter back from one of my colleagues saying that they just, they thought that I made a very,

48:29.158 --> 48:37.625
well-thought-out argument, but they disagreed with my conclusions and thanked me very much for my letter and hoped that my family was fine.

48:39.146 --> 48:40.327
And that's kind of where I left it.

48:43.410 --> 48:48.514
It's remarkable, really, the amount of respect and personal

48:51.872 --> 49:00.775
I mean, that was a pretty respectable human being that I sent a letter to, begging him to understand that something wasn't right.

49:01.655 --> 49:06.657
And no one else but him responded, and he responded in a very gentlemanly way.

49:09.277 --> 49:10.878
I almost was tempted to write back.

49:11.998 --> 49:18.620
It was all in the same December, November, because December of 2021 is when

49:21.860 --> 49:27.307
Kevin McKernan came on my stream and talked to me about the RNA and about how the RNA wasn't going to be pure.

49:29.971 --> 49:37.280
That there was this tale in the fractionization that said that there were a lot of little tiny RNAs in there.

49:38.015 --> 49:54.795
Of course, Catherine in the chat and a few other people are advanced enough in their biology to know that there's a lot of small RNAs in our cells that are doing work, and they are referred to in the literature as micro RNAs.

49:56.357 --> 50:04.541
It's one of these things that because we know it's there, doesn't mean that we understand it or can estimate its value to the system.

50:04.581 --> 50:16.926
We just know that there are examples of micro RNAs and small interfering RNAs, there's a technique that has evolved from it.

50:17.916 --> 50:21.319
Um, where, where RNA is used to regulate RNA basically.

50:21.359 --> 50:27.465
And so we don't understand how this system works, even if we can open up the watch and pull out different gears.

50:27.485 --> 50:29.167
Look at this one's a different shape thing.

50:29.787 --> 50:32.190
Yeah, it is, but you don't know how it worked in the watch.

50:35.633 --> 50:36.554
And that's the trick.

50:37.875 --> 50:42.840
You can take apart a watch piece by piece and you still don't know jack all about how it works.

50:44.741 --> 50:48.482
And if you're not very, very careful, you're not gonna be able to put it back together.

50:48.522 --> 50:56.946
And even if you put it back together and successfully get it to close, there's still a decent chance that it ain't gonna run like it did before you took it apart.

50:59.366 --> 51:08.810
And biologists aren't taking apart a watch with 416 parts that are all pieces of metal or rubies.

51:11.476 --> 51:18.778
They're taking apart something that's made of molecules and chemicals.

51:21.092 --> 51:31.622
and somehow small leftover bacteria organelles and all kinds of other things that we've come to have a sort of rudimentary understanding of how they work together.

51:31.662 --> 51:32.503
But that's about it.

51:32.543 --> 51:42.372
We can explain to our kids what we think we see under a microscope and some of the experiments that we've done to justify what we think we see under a microscope.

51:42.412 --> 51:44.154
And that's about as far as we've gotten.

51:46.667 --> 51:51.828
And the reality is we've taught our kids the wrong lines for where the individual starts.

51:52.648 --> 51:57.509
We've told our kids the wrong sort of model for how to think of themselves.

51:58.369 --> 52:08.451
And so a whole generation of children is growing up believing that they are just the chemical and physical consequences of a thing called the genome and their genes.

52:11.312 --> 52:12.672
And it's an absolute lie.

52:14.551 --> 52:28.279
And it takes away almost all of what is sacred about us and our experience on earth, our little tiny time that we're supposed to use as wisely as possible, not scrolling.

52:30.820 --> 52:32.481
These guys are now in charge.

52:32.621 --> 52:39.185
And so if we can see them for who they are, then we can also see our government for what it is.

52:40.846 --> 52:42.487
We can step back as a people

52:44.229 --> 52:45.571
And I don't know what we will do then.

52:45.631 --> 52:47.273
Can we put new people in there?

52:47.374 --> 52:50.418
I don't know if there's enough new people to put in there.

52:51.540 --> 52:53.863
I don't know if there are enough good people to put in there.

52:53.883 --> 52:57.709
But what I need you to see right now is that what cannot

52:59.192 --> 53:22.235
There's no other explanation other than to see that these are guys who have agreed to go to Disney World and put on the Donald Duck suit, to put on the Mickey Mouse costume, to put on the Goofy costume, and the Snow White costume, and the Snow White head, and go around and not talk to anybody, just shake the mask and take pictures with people.

53:27.268 --> 53:30.529
And if you do talk, you know, I guess you have to stay exactly on script.

53:30.589 --> 53:34.070
But in this case, you know, the analogy would be that you don't talk.

53:34.110 --> 53:42.272
You just shake and move your head side to side and get in the picture and put your big thumbs up and make funny jokes without talking.

53:45.112 --> 53:48.673
These are the people that are at the FDA now.

53:48.753 --> 53:51.654
This is a red alert, America, a red alert.

53:56.325 --> 53:57.487
Did I do something wrong there?

53:57.507 --> 54:01.093
Oh man, I think I did.

54:01.393 --> 54:03.978
Sorry, I gotta see if I can start that again.

54:05.911 --> 54:09.494
Sometimes if I'm starting and stopping it too often, it'll... I'll just sit down here.

54:09.594 --> 54:12.156
Hey guys, it's ZDoggMD, VP.

54:12.576 --> 54:14.478
Walk around a restaurant, do you need to wear the mask?

54:14.518 --> 54:15.699
When it's best ventilation.

54:15.719 --> 54:16.299
Yeah, right, right.

54:16.319 --> 54:18.981
Sit down, that's when... When you sit down next to all these people.

54:19.001 --> 54:23.545
Sit down, talk for two hours, loud, yapping, singing songs in the bar.

54:24.025 --> 54:25.406
That's okay, because you're sitting down.

54:26.127 --> 54:26.627
Much smaller.

54:26.887 --> 54:30.450
And to somebody who's already had natural immunity in addition to a vaccination, it's probably verging on zero.

54:30.610 --> 54:30.750
Yep.

54:30.991 --> 54:32.632
Okay, that's the argument of an individual risk.

54:32.992 --> 54:38.275
Now what about for the person out there who says that at least some part of boosting is for a communal benefit.

54:39.155 --> 54:47.879
So therefore the 20 year old kid in IT who's staying in his house all day, he should go and get a booster because maybe it'll help my grandmother.

54:47.899 --> 54:48.800
What are your thoughts on that?

54:49.500 --> 54:50.841
I think it's a reasonable argument.

54:51.181 --> 54:56.703
I think I think there's value to getting increasing your immune protection to reduce community transmission.

54:56.743 --> 55:03.485
But remember, the peak level of viral shedding was equal in vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the recent Lancet study.

55:03.645 --> 55:06.186
It's just the window was more narrow.

55:06.847 --> 55:08.727
I hope you can see this is an audition.

55:09.708 --> 55:10.908
How well can he do it?

55:12.369 --> 55:14.630
And all of these people were auditioning.

55:14.710 --> 55:17.971
I think that's the most important, important, important thing to see.

55:20.717 --> 55:27.540
given a script, encouraged on the script, and told that if you do well enough, you never know how far this is gonna go.

55:28.041 --> 55:40.787
You might have a book, you might have a position in the Trump administration, and you should be behind X, you should be behind Y. You don't think that that's what Latipo did?

55:42.007 --> 55:46.850
You don't think that that's what Ryan Cole is doing as he considers running for governor of Idaho?

55:47.210 --> 55:49.791
You don't think that that's maybe what Peter McCullough

55:51.260 --> 55:54.164
has essentially accomplished as the head of the wellness company.

55:54.525 --> 56:02.535
You don't think that's what Doc Malik wanted when he sent that email to the wellness company saying, I'll be your European head, I need $10,000 a month.

56:12.352 --> 56:14.433
This is not a game anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

56:14.453 --> 56:16.195
This is treachery.

56:16.295 --> 56:24.400
This is America being controlled, demolished by people that are being put in place that should not be there, should not be there.

56:25.921 --> 56:26.922
What are we going to do next?

56:26.982 --> 56:29.404
Appoint Jessica Rose to somewhere in the CDC?

56:32.324 --> 56:33.305
in somebody vaccinated.

56:33.325 --> 56:35.146
I would, you wanna say something?

56:35.166 --> 56:42.451
No, I was just gonna say, and then you have to weigh that communal benefit against the communal cost, which is days missed of work from having side effects from the booze.

56:42.511 --> 56:52.278
Think about how many variables my parents have to weigh if they listen to these guys and how easy it will be for them to just say, okay, just whatever.

56:52.358 --> 56:57.221
Tell me what I have to do so I can get back to my Green Bay Packer football game.

57:00.745 --> 57:08.110
booster, potential myocarditis, those kind of things we have to also factor in when you're holistically looking at, well, this is a policy decision now.

57:08.330 --> 57:19.737
Yeah, I'm with Z on this because I think that it is okay, I think, to have policy that is driven by community benefit as long as the individual recipient is not suffering a decrement in their health.

57:20.157 --> 57:28.484
And I do worry when you're talking about upper-bound benefits in a 25-year-old who's getting the third Moderna, that the upper-bound hospitalization benefit is basically as close to zero as you can get.

57:28.764 --> 57:31.566
But the risk of myocarditis, it's not gonna be one in 5,000, I don't think.

57:31.647 --> 57:34.349
It might be less, because that's what the data has emerged so far.

57:34.549 --> 57:37.772
But it's not gonna be zero, and it might exceed the benefit of hospitalization.

57:38.032 --> 57:42.636
So you can't ask a young person to literally take a harm for a societal benefit.

57:42.656 --> 57:43.396
That is theoretical.

57:43.496 --> 57:47.900
I mean, these people who talk about what the pandemic might be if we boost versus if we don't,

57:48.220 --> 57:52.384
They're the same people who made a bunch of models that, last I checked, ain't very accurate.

57:52.404 --> 57:53.745
They ain't very accurate.

57:53.805 --> 57:58.369
It's the same geniuses that told people they can't visit their loved ones as they're dying in the ICU.

57:58.489 --> 57:59.711
Yeah, they were not just geniuses.

57:59.751 --> 58:01.692
They were real humanitarians, those people.

58:02.113 --> 58:09.660
And, you know... I mean, just trying hard as possible to make jokes whenever they can.

58:11.556 --> 58:12.957
It's just hilarious, isn't it?

58:13.017 --> 58:15.819
That we separated all these old people and let them die alone.

58:15.879 --> 58:17.100
It's just so funny, isn't it?

58:17.140 --> 58:17.761
Wow, that's great.

58:18.481 --> 58:19.122
Just awesome.

58:19.722 --> 58:24.145
On top of that, there's this argument, well, you're gonna hurt grandma by not boosting, right?

58:24.185 --> 58:30.490
Which is a very specious argument because the grandmas you're gonna hurt elected not to get vaccinated, most of them.

58:30.690 --> 58:31.611
Oh, okay, that's an interesting.

58:31.631 --> 58:35.614
Yeah, so they've already made their decision on where they want risk to be, which is fine.

58:35.814 --> 58:36.214
That's fine.

58:36.715 --> 58:37.656
And you're gonna take that risk?

58:37.676 --> 58:38.416
That's fine.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.998
Your risk in that age group is not the worst.

58:41.238 --> 58:42.259
Whoa!

58:42.439 --> 58:51.567
That guy has just said that the only grandmothers you're gonna kill are the grandmas that chose not to get vaccinated, and that's their choice anyway.

58:52.048 --> 58:56.992
They knew the risk of not getting vaccinated, and so if they die, tough shit.

58:57.652 --> 58:58.873
Stop lying!

58:59.754 --> 59:00.515
Wow!

59:01.115 --> 59:03.017
That was remarkable.

59:03.858 --> 59:04.759
What a monster.

59:05.695 --> 59:22.947
What a, it's not even really a monster, unless you think of it as kind of like a, like a monster on Sesame Street in a big costume that his mouth can move open really big with big eyes, but that's it.

59:23.047 --> 59:27.010
You know, that monster, his mouth goes like this big.

59:27.851 --> 59:32.194
That's this guy right here, Z-Dog, wow.

59:33.789 --> 59:35.550
you know, one in 26,000, right?

59:35.630 --> 59:36.771
It's considerably higher.

59:36.831 --> 59:47.938
If you wanted to make a yin-yang of the pandemic, what you would do is you'd take this guy's head and you'd take Kevin McCarron's head and you'd kind of swirl them together.

59:47.958 --> 59:53.141
And that would be the ultimate sort of yin-yang of the pandemic.

59:53.541 --> 59:57.264
It's this extreme on one side and Kevin McCarron on the other.

59:59.085 --> 01:00:00.485
Wow, that is perfect.

01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:01.326
But still, right?

01:00:01.366 --> 01:00:13.591
And it's the same thing, you know, in the early days, I'd always say your risk of getting, if you're in your 20s, your risk of dying in a car accident is something like 10 times or two times higher than your risk of dying of COVID, whereas it inverts when you get older.

01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:15.392
So, you know, we just don't understand risk well.

01:00:15.672 --> 01:00:19.374
Somebody, and- It inverts when you get older.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:27.322
I'm going to get a pile of criticism for saying this.

01:00:27.342 --> 01:00:32.029
You think what you're going to say now is going to get... All the stuff you've been saying is going to get you a pile.

01:00:32.269 --> 01:00:33.591
You're going to get a deluge now.

01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:36.996
Have you ever seen a more forced laugh in your life?

01:00:37.096 --> 01:00:39.119
I mean, audition, audition.

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.446
The man has no self-insight at all.

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:48.330
I've never been criticized for anything I've ever said, but now I will.

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:56.016
And that is in the New England Journal of Medicine paper on vaccine complications.

01:00:57.156 --> 01:00:57.856
Somebody died.

01:00:57.876 --> 01:01:03.419
A 22-year-old died in that group of 134 people who got myocarditis.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:09.062
That was in Israel, a country 1 38th our size.

01:01:09.642 --> 01:01:17.946
And that's the one case that's documented, that's confirmed that we know of, and I'm not making my own conclusions about it.

01:01:18.346 --> 01:01:20.747
I'm just telling you what was in the New England Journal of Medicine.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:21.908
But why is that so important?

01:01:22.677 --> 01:01:26.079
Well, if we take that number and extrapolate it to the U.S.

01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:31.603
population, are we prepared to extrapolate that number of deaths from vaccination

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:37.311
And how does that compare with the deaths from COVID in healthy people?

01:01:37.351 --> 01:01:37.632
Correct.

01:01:37.772 --> 01:01:52.740
And I think, Marty, to your point, two things can... So now he's saying that as long as what, those deaths are significantly different, as long as a lot more people died of COVID than died of the shot, then it's all right.

01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:57.843
I want you to think very carefully about that because that is what that little

01:01:59.372 --> 01:02:00.393
Weasel just said.

01:02:01.173 --> 01:02:06.276
I'll even go back to make sure that you can hear it because it was, it's pretty treacherous to say that.

01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:08.977
I got to get my head out of the way for a second while I use this.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.760
Why isn't it doing there?

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:17.601
Come on.

01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:20.543
Well, oh no, I know why because it's not running.

01:02:20.663 --> 01:02:20.943
Sorry.

01:02:22.028 --> 01:02:22.969
It can be true at the same time.

01:02:23.189 --> 01:02:34.739
The people who want to identify in that group of 134 people who got myocarditis, that was in Israel, a country 1 38th our size.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:39.043
And that's the one case that's documented, that's confirmed that we know of.

01:02:39.363 --> 01:02:43.626
And I'm not making my own conclusions about it.

01:02:44.047 --> 01:02:46.429
I'm just telling you what was in the New England Journal of Medicine.

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:47.590
But why is that so important?

01:02:48.359 --> 01:02:57.386
Well, if we take that number and extrapolate it to the US population, are we prepared to extrapolate that number of deaths from vaccination?

01:02:59.267 --> 01:03:03.030
And how does that compare with the deaths from COVID in healthy people?

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:03.330
Correct.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:07.253
And I think, Marty, to your point, two things can be true at the same time.

01:03:07.453 --> 01:03:15.679
The people who want to, I think, have you not talked so much about myocarditis, they say things that is true, which is that it's mostly mild.

01:03:15.999 --> 01:03:17.260
But all adverse events

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.341
exist on a continuum, a spectrum.

01:03:19.361 --> 01:03:20.241
COVID's mostly mild.

01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:21.662
You could say that, right.

01:03:21.742 --> 01:03:22.242
Oh, don't say that.

01:03:22.402 --> 01:03:24.323
You said so many dangerous things, Marty.

01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:24.744
Keep going.

01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:29.206
But that doesn't mean, but your point is well taken, that it's not just what happens to most people.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.647
It's what happens to the tail people.

01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:34.809
It's what happens to that, you know, there's a distribution of events and most myocarditis will be mild.

01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:35.409
Thank goodness.

01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:36.609
Most will self resolve.

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.931
Some will have a long-term late gadolinium enhancement.

01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:45.134
We don't really know what LGE means on T2-weighted MRs. We don't really have the full implications.

01:03:45.914 --> 01:03:56.938
He just dropped a bunch of ridiculously complicated stuff to try and tell you that there's a way to measure the deposition of something called gallium in the heart.

01:03:57.078 --> 01:04:01.820
And if it deposits there, it can be an indication that some of the muscle has been damaged.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:10.303
And they've also made the argument that myocarditis can completely heal, which quite a few cardiologists disagree with.

01:04:11.587 --> 01:04:21.693
And none of these guys are cardiologists, but they're very certain that mild myocarditis is something that anybody can get over, which is so not true.

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:26.416
And how's mild myocarditis for an old person?

01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:32.799
I mean, what are they talking about here other than the script that they've been given?

01:04:32.839 --> 01:04:35.201
And we're going to bounce back and forth these ideas.

01:04:36.321 --> 01:04:37.662
And here are the talking points.

01:04:37.722 --> 01:04:38.883
Let's just have fun, right?

01:04:38.903 --> 01:04:40.564
Just don't forget to have fun.

01:04:41.718 --> 01:04:45.041
Will some lead to chronic arrhythmia, chronic cardiac disturbance?

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.623
Will some lead to shortened life expectancy down the road?

01:04:48.283 --> 01:04:54.749
But what we do know for sure is that it does have the potential to have catastrophic short-term failure and death, as in this case report from Israel.

01:04:55.129 --> 01:04:59.352
And that should give people some caution that it's not all mild, it's mostly mild.

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:03.456
Just like COVID is not all benign, it's largely a lot of people recover.

01:05:03.916 --> 01:05:14.122
Right, and I think to put a little container around this Chernobyl activity, which I love, we're not trying to invoke fear by saying, oh, potentially there's an arrhythmia.

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:18.484
We're just saying, listen, you have to think about all these things when you're looking at a risk-benefit for a population.

01:05:18.524 --> 01:05:21.246
And I'll add another piece here that a lot of people don't talk about.

01:05:21.266 --> 01:05:23.367
Again, risk-benefit for a population.

01:05:23.427 --> 01:05:26.208
So we're not talking about the sovereign individual.

01:05:26.248 --> 01:05:30.491
We're not talking about the principle of the perfect child, the perfect,

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:41.153
pattern integrity that doesn't need the ham-fisted augmentation of an injection in the muscle.

01:05:41.433 --> 01:05:46.877
It's just remarkable when you see it now after so many years of really understanding.

01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:51.901
And the darkness that was present at this time, I mean, it's awful.

01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:54.003
Talk about, because I get the emails, right?

01:05:54.043 --> 01:05:56.365
So these people are- I don't read them.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.465
Yeah, you don't read them?

01:05:58.346 --> 01:06:00.508
Life is great, life is great when you don't read the emails.

01:06:00.528 --> 01:06:04.752
I gotta say this, I've been increasing my meditation amount to like two, three, four hours a day.

01:06:04.812 --> 01:06:07.414
I get up at like four and meditate for two hours in a day.

01:06:07.434 --> 01:06:08.235
Yeah, I know, minutes.

01:06:08.535 --> 01:06:09.096
Well, that's the best.

01:06:09.276 --> 01:06:12.819
I mean, the real actual quality meditation is one minute of thoughtless space.

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:16.523
The rest is all just me watching my thoughts and getting angry about something someone said on Twitter.

01:06:16.963 --> 01:06:21.746
But since that's happened, I look at email less and I try to batch them and only do them on the weekends.

01:06:21.766 --> 01:06:24.828
So I'll sit for three hours and I'll go through 400 emails.

01:06:24.988 --> 01:06:31.893
And what I read is young people who've maybe had COVID, maybe they've gotten the first two doses.

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:33.894
Now they're talking about boosters.

01:06:34.014 --> 01:06:36.535
And number one, they have deep needle fear.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:38.416
So there's something that conditioned them when they were young.

01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:41.077
They got stuck five times at once, which is all fine.

01:06:41.117 --> 01:06:43.338
But now they have this terrifying piece of needle fear.

01:06:43.578 --> 01:06:46.059
They are worried about myocarditis because they have some family history.

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:48.040
So their anxiety levels through the roof.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.581
The media's already stoked their anxiety fear contagion.

01:06:51.182 --> 01:06:53.943
And they're asking me, what should I do?

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:54.963
I'm scared to do it.

01:06:55.023 --> 01:06:56.104
I'm scared not to do it.

01:06:56.524 --> 01:06:57.945
And this has a cost.

01:06:58.385 --> 01:07:00.146
Yeah, I can't go to college unless I do it.

01:07:00.646 --> 01:07:01.927
Yeah, that I think is problematic.

01:07:02.087 --> 01:07:06.669
And I mean, to Zubin's point, I guess I- It's not very problematic.

01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:09.290
All we had to do was tell kids not to go.

01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:11.331
Just take a year off.

01:07:12.452 --> 01:07:13.632
Stand up for yourself.

01:07:13.912 --> 01:07:14.693
You're an adult.

01:07:15.453 --> 01:07:16.554
Don't go to college.

01:07:16.634 --> 01:07:17.734
That's what I would have done.

01:07:17.754 --> 01:07:21.696
And anybody could have given their kids that advice.

01:07:21.796 --> 01:07:25.218
I tried to tell Piper Stover to give her kids that advice.

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:32.472
I told everybody that in 2021, don't go back to college then.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:35.933
Why do you have to go back?

01:07:40.696 --> 01:07:52.561
But of course the whole point was to get the college kids to have to make that really awful choice between do you want to party and go to football games and basketball games and maybe meet your, the love of your life.

01:07:54.224 --> 01:08:02.950
Because let's face it, nobody is so desperate to start their bachelors in accounting that they have to go to college this fall.

01:08:05.632 --> 01:08:08.694
Especially after four years of high school with AP classes.

01:08:08.754 --> 01:08:09.515
Give me a break.

01:08:09.555 --> 01:08:11.196
You couldn't have done something else?

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.280
This is the reality.

01:08:18.444 --> 01:08:22.647
This whole idea that, oh, now, you know, kids have to go back to college.

01:08:22.687 --> 01:08:27.090
It's just a question of whether or not certain colleges are going to require boosters or not.

01:08:27.691 --> 01:08:30.693
It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen, that we fell for it.

01:08:32.503 --> 01:08:36.224
when it would have been over in an instant if everybody would have just said, you know what?

01:08:36.304 --> 01:08:50.148
You want to require my adult children, my adult children that are going to your university for 20 to $50,000 a year, taking out loans to go to your shitty university.

01:08:50.608 --> 01:08:52.268
And now you're going to treat them like that.

01:08:52.308 --> 01:08:54.109
Well, then they're just not going to go this year.

01:08:57.202 --> 01:09:04.268
And somehow or another, no parent in America that had that idea ever got that message out.

01:09:04.448 --> 01:09:12.795
Social media just seemed to be completely devoid of parents who could have seen through this bullshit enough to at least say, you know what?

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.538
Let's just stay home this year.

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:22.604
I want you to think about that very carefully because of course these guys are all part of that.

01:09:25.959 --> 01:09:30.762
These young, charming, YouTube promoted people are part of that.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:38.207
And they're still part of it now because they're not going back and realizing that, wow, there was a really simple solution.

01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:49.094
And they'll never go back to find out that there was a guy who got fired from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was trying to offer that solution.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:55.141
I wanna also be clear that I'm a huge proponent of vaccination.

01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:55.741
Yeah, both of us are.

01:09:55.781 --> 01:09:56.402
Yeah, we both are.

01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:03.909
The reason is you can be a proponent for something, but recognize that there are always populations or groups where you need to have a lighter touch.

01:10:04.329 --> 01:10:09.074
And in this case, for instance, other countries around the world, they're not using Moderna under 30, right?

01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:09.734
Such as Germany, Denmark.

01:10:09.754 --> 01:10:10.355
That's right, right.

01:10:10.395 --> 01:10:11.336
They're not using Moderna, why?

01:10:11.616 --> 01:10:14.159
because they say we have Pfizer, and Pfizer has less myocarditis than Moderna.

01:10:14.179 --> 01:10:16.921
So why would we take more myocarditis when you get most- They recommend against it.

01:10:17.502 --> 01:10:25.450
Now they're telling you a story about, you know, that some of these vaccines are appropriate for some ages and different countries are doing different things.

01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:30.355
And so obviously this is an argument, a discussion that needs to be had.

01:10:30.795 --> 01:10:32.137
Stop lying!

01:10:35.266 --> 01:10:35.566
against it.

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:37.167
Some countries explicitly against it.

01:10:37.187 --> 01:10:38.268
Some countries don't even let you get it.

01:10:38.288 --> 01:10:41.750
Some countries let you get it if you choose to opt into it, but different strategies.

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:44.772
But this country, you know, or nothing, it's all or nothing.

01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:48.014
And it's three, it's three or three or you're not quote fully vaccinated.

01:10:48.034 --> 01:10:49.175
You know, that's, that's a problem.

01:10:49.235 --> 01:10:54.178
And you know, what's really interesting is you can't talk about masking a two and three year old as a question

01:10:54.798 --> 01:10:56.659
But the WHO says don't do it.

01:10:57.199 --> 01:11:01.581
So the US, if- Yeah, but Steve Hadfield says to do it.

01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:08.484
Steve Hadfield said we should have been masking Barney the dinosaur in 2020 so that kids would not be so scared of masks.

01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:16.008
He said we should wear an apron when we treat our sick kids and make them use a separate toilet.

01:11:16.128 --> 01:11:20.950
I feel like we've lost the ability to even have the- Because there's so much virus in their stool.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:36.271
If there is a signal in their stool, it's from a bacteriophage or bacteria, not from something called a coronavirus, I can tell you that for sure.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:42.798
This course about it, because of the same thing you talked about, where there's a narrative that has to be kind of pushed.

01:11:42.818 --> 01:11:44.981
And I don't know how this became a narrative.

01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:47.273
What happened here?

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:52.214
And of course, this is neuro-linguistic programming.

01:11:52.854 --> 01:11:57.235
What is the underlying assumption that your brain hears when he talks like this?

01:11:59.156 --> 01:12:01.036
It's that he's not part of the narrative.

01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:04.497
He doesn't understand how this became a narrative.

01:12:05.857 --> 01:12:13.779
And so your brain starts to hear a sort of, oh, well, I guess I can trust this guy then because he's breaking me out of the narrative.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:25.153
But of course, he didn't break you out of the narrative because the real narrative is that PCR works to track a novel signal in the background, a novel signal carried by RNA.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:32.944
And this mythology alone is the justification for everything else.

01:12:33.244 --> 01:12:47.535
All the way to transfecting and transforming old people in 2020, and then moving up and on down the line of ages, all the way to the childhood vaccine was precisely possible because of three clowns like this.

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:55.461
Creating an illusion of consensus that these are the questions to ask, these are the most rational answers,

01:12:56.468 --> 01:12:59.155
and they're breaking the narrative of the state.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:10.304
Well, I've talked to public health officials behind the scenes.

01:13:10.464 --> 01:13:11.965
You know, I'm in the Washington, D.C.

01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:12.285
area.

01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:14.406
And here's here's something that they argue.

01:13:14.486 --> 01:13:18.088
And it's not a it's not a completely flawed argument.

01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:19.549
It's just one I disagree with.

01:13:19.609 --> 01:13:23.931
And that is there is value to a very simple, streamlined message.

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:29.273
In other words, vaccinate everybody, ignore natural immunity, just vaccinate everybody.

01:13:29.634 --> 01:13:35.717
And maybe that simplicity of the messaging will result in more vaccinations among those who don't have natural immunity.

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:42.282
I disagree with that because I believe we should be 100% honest with people and not be so paternalistic.

01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.745
And we've again seen this in so many areas of medicine.

01:13:45.765 --> 01:13:54.993
That's the second time he said it's paternalism or paternalistic so clearly that's on the talking point merry-go-round or hamster wheel depending on how you want to see it.

01:13:55.373 --> 01:13:56.273
That isn't up to this day.

01:13:56.293 --> 01:13:59.615
We're seeing with the booster conversation, you must, have to.

01:14:00.055 --> 01:14:01.636
How about quantifying that risk to them?

01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:08.079
And the other thing they say is that... Quantifying the risk is not informed consent.

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:11.040
Make sure you hear that many, many times over.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.442
Quantifying the risk is not informed consent.

01:14:19.161 --> 01:14:28.049
But with the kids, you know, sure, yes, maybe for a child who's had COVID, they don't need to vaccinate.

01:14:28.489 --> 01:14:31.512
But there are those with comorbidities, and we really want to get them vaccinated.

01:14:31.552 --> 01:14:33.613
So do a universal vaccine policy.

01:14:33.633 --> 01:14:35.195
But you know what's simple?

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:40.861
If you're tiling a room, it's simple to just use the tiles that come from the store.

01:14:41.181 --> 01:14:45.826
But when you get to the corners of the room, you got to start cutting the tiles or you're going to have some problems on the corners.

01:14:46.186 --> 01:14:48.629
And so, you know, simplicity can be a problem.

01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:52.333
It can be such a problem that there are groups of people who are actually hurt by simplicity.

01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:53.233
And you lose credibility.

01:14:53.774 --> 01:14:54.735
I mean, should we do mammograms?

01:14:54.835 --> 01:15:11.428
Groups of people are hurt by simplicity is a very interestingly close argument to the idea that, you know, we need to screen everybody genetically before we're going to know what medicines are appropriate for who, because not all medicines work for everybody.

01:15:11.968 --> 01:15:13.069
Very similar to the 2007... 17? 17?

01:15:18.094 --> 01:15:22.139
2017 argument of Kevin McKernan in the video we watched a couple days ago.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.781
Remarkably close.

01:15:24.522 --> 01:15:26.765
For all men and women, including children.

01:15:26.785 --> 01:15:27.626
Just to keep it simple.

01:15:27.646 --> 01:15:28.087
Keep it simple.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:28.708
Keep it simple.

01:15:28.848 --> 01:15:30.110
What are you saying, Marty?

01:15:30.631 --> 01:15:32.052
Listen, this is not breast tissue.

01:15:32.193 --> 01:15:32.653
It's muscle.

01:15:33.574 --> 01:15:36.396
Are you suggesting that kids don't need a colonoscopy?

01:15:36.416 --> 01:15:38.017
Are you gonna just let them die?

01:15:38.037 --> 01:15:44.262
I would just do the genetic test on their stool to rule out the possibility of colon cancer, which doesn't exist.

01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:49.746
I'm glad you're anti-colon cancer in children because for a second there, I thought you wanted to just let them die.

01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:58.032
Colon cancer is one of those things that has risen over the course of the transfection era in children.

01:15:58.332 --> 01:15:59.833
Interesting thing to joke about in 2021.

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:01.976
You know what?

01:16:02.637 --> 01:16:04.158
You're dangerous.

01:16:04.238 --> 01:16:06.459
The other thing I want to say, Marty, though, about this is this is America.

01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:12.023
So we have a certain cultural set of norms around not having the government tell us everything that we're supposed to do.

01:16:12.123 --> 01:16:14.905
So pros and cons of that for sure.

01:16:15.185 --> 01:16:16.166
But this is America.

01:16:16.246 --> 01:16:19.308
So Americans don't like when people aren't.

01:16:20.148 --> 01:16:23.811
Americans don't like is how you talk when you're not an American.

01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:30.968
Americans don't like is how you talk when you're not an American.

01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:37.910
I bet you can go through all the hours of my stream and I would never have once spoken in that way because I am an American.

01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:39.951
My kids are Americans.

01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:45.312
My kids live in America and I want my grandkids to live in America.

01:16:45.412 --> 01:16:47.053
So I guess I'm an American.

01:16:49.413 --> 01:16:51.814
And I give a shit a lot about what happens in America.

01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:55.742
This guy is awful.

01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:57.823
Just direct, like, hey, here's the deal.

01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.105
Here's the nuance, right?

01:16:59.305 --> 01:17:00.005
Hey, you know what?

01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:05.049
We're asking you not to wear masks because there aren't enough freaking masks for the people who really need them.

01:17:05.289 --> 01:17:06.190
Let's just say that.

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.550
Right.

01:17:06.671 --> 01:17:09.513
Instead of what Fauci did, the flip-flop and so on.

01:17:09.573 --> 01:17:10.494
Surface transmission.

01:17:11.014 --> 01:17:15.317
Yeah, all the geniuses that kept loved ones out of the ICU.

01:17:15.337 --> 01:17:19.080
It was good that you scanned your menu for that QR code, because that's what keeps you safe at night, right?

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:19.461
You know what?

01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:23.884
and the hygiene theater of putting your mask on until you sit down and then taking it off.

01:17:24.384 --> 01:17:25.645
Only when you walk- He looks up.

01:17:25.885 --> 01:17:27.807
I wonder if there's actually cue cards.

01:17:28.087 --> 01:17:30.949
I think that there might be somebody cue carding them.

01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:38.794
And so, you know, flashing something up or maybe it comes up on a screen, but I bet it's just a guy with a little whiteboard that he can write something on.

01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:40.335
I shit you not.

01:17:40.596 --> 01:17:41.216
I can see it.

01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:41.776
Look.

01:17:42.637 --> 01:17:43.858
He's not looking at Marty.

01:17:43.878 --> 01:17:45.479
He's looking over the head of Marty.

01:17:45.519 --> 01:17:46.620
Do you see this shit?

01:17:47.605 --> 01:17:48.846
This is really awful.

01:17:48.926 --> 01:17:51.389
This is worse than I thought.

01:17:51.849 --> 01:17:53.030
It's really scary.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:14.207
to the current pandemic, if you were in the White House, you know, you might view it as like anything that gets the cases, and maybe this can lead to the case discussion we wanna talk about, anything that can get cases down is something we ought to pursue.

01:18:14.707 --> 01:18:17.009
Considerably higher, but still, right?

01:18:17.049 --> 01:18:29.277
And it's the same thing, you know, in the early days, I would always say your risk of getting, if you're in your 20s, your risk of dying in a car accident is something like 10 times or two times higher than your risk of dying of COVID, whereas it inverts when you get older.

01:18:29.437 --> 01:18:30.558
So, you know, we just don't understand.

01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:32.219
Okay, I went back a little too far.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.563
I'm going to get a pile of criticism first.

01:18:36.584 --> 01:18:37.485
I'll try to base it.

01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:40.308
You think what you're going to say now is going to get... Mostly mild.

01:18:40.468 --> 01:18:43.291
Just like COVID is not... Who don't have natural immunity.

01:18:43.912 --> 01:18:47.456
I disagree with that because I believe we should be 100% honest with people.

01:18:47.516 --> 01:18:48.057
Yeah, that's good.

01:18:48.097 --> 01:18:49.799
And not be so paternalistic.

01:18:50.419 --> 01:18:53.620
And we've, again, seen this in so many areas of medicine.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.780
Watch where he looks, no.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.420
You must have to.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.461
How about quantifying that risk to them?

01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:00.301
See if we can see it more often.

01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:15.664
And the other thing they say is that with the kids, you know, sure, yes, maybe for a child who's had COVID, they don't need to vaccinate, but there are those with comorbidities and we really want to get them vaccinated, so do a universal vaccine policy.

01:19:16.564 --> 01:19:17.304
But you know what's simple?

01:19:17.644 --> 01:19:22.945
If you're tiling a room, it's simple to just use the tiles that come from the store.

01:19:23.265 --> 01:19:27.906
But when you get to the corners of the room, you gotta start cutting the tiles or you're gonna have some problems on the corners.

01:19:28.266 --> 01:19:30.706
And so simplicity can be a problem.

01:19:30.987 --> 01:19:34.547
It can be such a problem that there are groups of people who are actually hurt by simplicity.

01:19:34.727 --> 01:19:44.969
Okay, so remember, this is a good one to review because this is essentially what James Lyons Wyler would argue, that there are genetic and environmental causes of these damages.

01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:51.952
There is a vulnerability that could be there and it's on the fringes of the population because most people aren't hurt at all.

01:19:52.993 --> 01:19:53.733
It's rare.

01:19:53.954 --> 01:20:04.919
And the rarity is not because sometimes intramuscular injection goes catastrophically wrong and sometimes it doesn't go wrong and it goes wrong over a much longer timescale.

01:20:05.039 --> 01:20:08.401
No, it's because these people are genetic variants.

01:20:10.202 --> 01:20:14.865
Anecdotal, you know, far parts of the curve.

01:20:15.734 --> 01:20:16.394
Lose credibility.

01:20:16.414 --> 01:20:20.637
I mean, should we do mammograms for all men and women, just to keep it simple?

01:20:20.777 --> 01:20:21.278
Keep it simple.

01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.258
Keep it simple.

01:20:22.378 --> 01:20:23.659
What are you saying, Marty?

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.601
Listen, this is not breast tissue.

01:20:25.741 --> 01:20:26.221
It's muscle.

01:20:27.142 --> 01:20:29.964
Are you suggesting that kids don't need a colonoscopy?

01:20:30.004 --> 01:20:31.585
Are you going to just let them die?

01:20:31.605 --> 01:20:37.829
I would just do the genetic test on their stool to rule out the possibility of colon cancer, which doesn't exist.

01:20:37.869 --> 01:20:43.312
I'm glad you're anti colon cancer and children, because for a second there, I thought I wanted to just let them die.

01:20:43.613 --> 01:20:44.053
You know what?

01:20:44.693 --> 01:20:45.314
You're dangerous.

01:20:46.114 --> 01:20:48.515
The other thing I want to say, Marty, though, about this is this is America.

01:20:48.555 --> 01:20:54.055
So we have a certain cultural set of norms around not having the government tell us everything that we're supposed to do.

01:20:54.175 --> 01:20:56.956
So pros and cons of that, for sure.

01:20:57.236 --> 01:20:58.196
But this is America.

01:20:58.296 --> 01:21:02.497
So Americans don't like when people are just direct.

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:03.977
Like, hey, here's the deal.

01:21:04.137 --> 01:21:05.237
Here's the nuance, right?

01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:06.158
Hey, you know what?

01:21:06.678 --> 01:21:11.199
We're asking you not to wear masks because there aren't enough freaking masks for the people who really need them.

01:21:11.439 --> 01:21:13.399
Let's just say that instead of what,

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.640
Fauci did the flip-flop and so on.

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.640
Surface transmission.

01:21:18.801 --> 01:21:21.543
All the geniuses that kept loved ones out of the ICU.

01:21:21.563 --> 01:21:25.285
But good thing you scanned your menu for that QR code, because that's what keeps you safe at night, right?

01:21:25.365 --> 01:21:25.905
You know what?

01:21:26.285 --> 01:21:30.027
And the hygiene theater of putting your mask on until you sit down, and then taking it off.

01:21:30.547 --> 01:21:32.830
Only when you walk around a restaurant do you need to wear the mask.

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:35.913
When it's best ventilation.

01:21:36.354 --> 01:21:41.900
Sit down, talk for two hours loud, yapping, singing songs in the bar.

01:21:42.381 --> 01:21:43.782
That's okay because you're sitting down.

01:21:43.842 --> 01:21:45.384
But can I offer one more suggestion about

01:21:45.764 --> 01:21:57.792
I mean, one narrative for why these policies are wrong in these places, and I do think that it's not just you and me and Zubin to some degree and Cody Meissner and Walid and some other people who think that there's some problems on the margin with these policies.

01:21:58.493 --> 01:22:00.434
One explanation is that they're trying to keep things really simple.

01:22:01.014 --> 01:22:01.254
Okay.

01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:04.076
Another explanation is that there is a tension.

01:22:04.316 --> 01:22:04.777
What do you think?

01:22:04.917 --> 01:22:06.278
I'm posing this as a question to you.

01:22:07.346 --> 01:22:12.031
There's a tension between what is good politics and what is good medicine.

01:22:12.712 --> 01:22:26.487
And from a political calculation, if you are somebody whose future is tied to the current pandemic, if you're in the White House, you might view it as like anything that gets the cases, and maybe this can lead to the case discussion we wanna talk about.

01:22:26.847 --> 01:22:30.008
Anything that can get cases down is something we ought to pursue.

01:22:30.889 --> 01:22:37.392
And you don't think about it the way a doctor thinks about it, which is like for this 16-year-old boy in my office who I've documented he had COVID and he recovered from COVID.

01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:40.133
And he's an athlete who's poised to get a college scholarship.

01:22:40.273 --> 01:22:42.134
And he already got one dose of the vaccine.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.354
Should I give him the second dose?

01:22:43.434 --> 01:22:43.594
No.

01:22:43.874 --> 01:22:44.255
OK, right.

01:22:44.475 --> 01:22:45.215
That's what a doctor would say.

01:22:45.295 --> 01:22:45.815
I think you're right.

01:22:45.975 --> 01:22:48.856
I think if you're really honest, most pediatricians would say that for such a boy.

01:22:49.077 --> 01:22:49.537
Absolutely.

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:50.077
Absolutely.

01:22:50.417 --> 01:22:50.517
OK.

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:51.838
But now you're the White House.

01:22:52.518 --> 01:22:54.559
Now what's the risk benefit to you in the White House?

01:22:54.839 --> 01:22:58.061
Because if this kid goes out there and he ends up getting the sniffles and he gets a swab and it's.

01:22:58.081 --> 01:23:01.702
I don't really think we need to keep going with this one if I'm gonna hit the other one for a little while.

01:23:01.762 --> 01:23:03.583
And I do wanna do that before I end.

01:23:04.043 --> 01:23:06.625
It's only 1237, so I do still have time.

01:23:07.545 --> 01:23:09.506
You can find this on YouTube.

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:10.286
It's very easy.

01:23:10.326 --> 01:23:12.047
I'm not gonna give you the link, but you can find it.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:15.449
This is the one where they talk about Omicron and that's in the title.

01:23:15.469 --> 01:23:19.270
So you can find that when you look up ZDogg and Vinay and Marty.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:19.851
It's positive.

01:23:21.372 --> 01:23:33.664
Now, I just want to be clear, I don't think all of the people in this picture are bad guys, but I do think that all of these people in particular are aware of me.

01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:42.792
And that makes them somewhat suspicious because they are going along with the rest of the people in this picture.

01:23:43.723 --> 01:23:55.368
Now I am very aware that it only takes half of the people in the picture to be in on it for the rest of them to be essentially enchanted by the ones that are in on it.

01:23:56.408 --> 01:24:07.177
If this guy and this guy and this girl get on stage and all lie together and then introduce her and they all tell you a story, it's gonna be very hard for you to see through it.

01:24:07.577 --> 01:24:17.365
If they invite some of these people to a private hotel and they have a little conference together and they meet at breakfast, then it's gonna be very hard for them to see through.

01:24:17.425 --> 01:24:19.927
And now these people are enchanted by these people.

01:24:19.947 --> 01:24:23.250
And before you know it, they can work together to enchant the people at the top.

01:24:24.639 --> 01:24:30.003
And I don't know who belongs at the top up there where they're just Truman showed into a position.

01:24:30.663 --> 01:24:33.024
But I do think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:33.085 --> 01:24:39.229
has been Truman showed into a position that he doesn't even understand how out of his depth he is.

01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:48.535
I think Jay Bhattacharya is another person who has been Truman showed into a position and wanted somehow or another to

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:54.603
You know, I mean, there's a game being played here and it's not about the truth.

01:24:54.683 --> 01:24:58.966
It's about going along to get along and then you can be part of the ruling elite.

01:24:59.806 --> 01:25:05.610
And that's what you see happening with Vinay and probably will happen with ZDogg for all we know.

01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:15.116
I mean, it's crazy right now how bold they are being by putting someone like Steven Hatfield, the original suspect of the anthrax leaks or attacks in 2001,

01:25:19.349 --> 01:25:36.580
The guy who was associated with Ebola in Rhodesia, a guy who declared that he really didn't like Merrill Nass when he was on Tommy's podcast with Robert Malone and was on stage with almost all of these people in 2023 in Romania in November.

01:25:44.457 --> 01:25:45.857
I mean, it's there.

01:25:45.998 --> 01:25:52.700
You can see it right now that these people are part of a fake global something.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:55.500
They are funded by Big Pharma.

01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:59.802
They are funded by Merck or Goldman Sachs or something.

01:26:00.562 --> 01:26:04.323
And they are using and demonstrating the power of social media.

01:26:04.723 --> 01:26:12.766
Because if you let these people loose on social media and you amplify their accounts, you are going to get a very good result.

01:26:14.281 --> 01:26:25.248
And that good result is where we are right now, because you don't know who Brandy Vaughn is, you've never heard of Mark Kulak, you don't know who Joe Marshall is, and you don't know who I am.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:34.633
Even though I wrote a book with the guy at the top, who most of these people agree is an absolute hero in the perfect position to save us.

01:26:36.634 --> 01:26:39.296
And you know, with Jay Bhattacharya at his side, how could he fail?

01:26:45.029 --> 01:26:54.254
This is all being done for the Human Genome Project, the longest running global cooperative network of data collectors there ever has been.

01:26:56.335 --> 01:27:07.200
Because China is in the same population pyramid trap that we are, they have a very, very big interest, a vested interest in being able to manage it just like we do.

01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:14.272
There's an exchange going on here or something like that.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:25.160
We are being sold out to higher powers, to weaponized piles of money that even the Communist Party of China is subject to.

01:27:26.881 --> 01:27:29.163
The ruling people in Russia are subject to.

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:30.544
Everybody's subject to it.

01:27:31.685 --> 01:27:32.866
The EU is part of it.

01:27:35.347 --> 01:27:36.989
The Human Genome Project is the

01:27:37.967 --> 01:27:42.329
the longest running human project or human endeavor ever.

01:27:43.429 --> 01:28:00.695
Because it essentially started with, by its conception, and then a absolutely international effort to assemble the computing power, the computer storage, the network capabilities, the machine learning algorithms,

01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:18.780
and the molecular biological tools necessary to sample the entire human population while it is at a size which might be mathematically relevant to a machine learning algorithm figuring something out that we have no hope of figuring out.

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.161
That's their plan.

01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:27.075
And they're gonna stick to it because they believe that maybe the machine learning algorithm doesn't exist.

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.457
Maybe we don't have this key piece of data.

01:28:29.817 --> 01:28:31.579
Maybe something's gonna fall out then.

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:33.840
They know that they're not there yet.

01:28:33.921 --> 01:28:35.842
So they have to build the infrastructure.

01:28:36.883 --> 01:28:39.886
They can't just decide, well, I guess it's not gonna work.

01:28:39.946 --> 01:28:43.389
So why would we build the infrastructure to store that much data?

01:28:43.929 --> 01:28:46.631
Why would we try to invent the processors that could do that?

01:28:46.732 --> 01:28:46.972
No.

01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:57.101
NVIDIA is not for making AI videos faster and more cool so that they can make fake movies of people.

01:28:59.122 --> 01:29:01.563
All this technology is bent on one goal.

01:29:02.644 --> 01:29:04.865
Absolutely, positively one goal.

01:29:08.687 --> 01:29:11.388
All of these PSYOPs are bent on one goal.

01:29:11.408 --> 01:29:15.630
9-11 was bent on the same goal.

01:29:17.073 --> 01:29:20.015
Probably AIDS had this goal in mind.

01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:23.138
The narrative had this goal in mind.

01:29:23.579 --> 01:29:27.222
I don't know how to break it to you, but we're there.

01:29:29.143 --> 01:29:30.685
We are absolutely there.

01:29:34.968 --> 01:29:42.795
It's a spectacular commitment to lies and beautiful computer graphics generated to make sure that staying committed to those lies is easy.

01:29:43.789 --> 01:29:48.992
With videos like this, it's very easy for ZDogg to have discussions about seroprevalence.

01:29:49.552 --> 01:30:08.643
With videos like this, it's very easy to have discussions about the relevance of RNA and its reaching dendritic cells because you can show this cartoon of RNA reaching a dendritic cell and then everybody will just accept it, including ZDogg, including Vinay Prasad, including the surgeon Marty McCarty.

01:30:11.607 --> 01:30:15.369
I don't think any of them is a Native American person.

01:30:15.829 --> 01:30:18.591
Like, I really don't think.

01:30:18.651 --> 01:30:21.952
I think if you checked out, you would find that all of their parents are foreigners.

01:30:22.913 --> 01:30:27.015
If they were born in the United States, they're first generation born in the United States.

01:30:27.055 --> 01:30:29.196
And I would not be surprised if they weren't born here.

01:30:30.837 --> 01:30:32.378
Am I sounding like a nationalist?

01:30:32.438 --> 01:30:40.642
I guess I am, but there are a lot of mutts in America like me with a multi-ethnic background that need to stand up for themselves as Americans.

01:30:42.011 --> 01:30:49.337
Because the narrative on television is that America is a bunch of white people and a bunch of black people and a bunch of Hispanics, and they're all pissed at each other.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.939
And that's not the reality at all.

01:30:54.201 --> 01:30:57.604
The reality is, is that there's a very mixed bag of Americans.

01:30:59.805 --> 01:31:05.070
And dividing us on white and black and Hispanic is really convenient for them.

01:31:07.011 --> 01:31:08.993
And that's also why they bring those people on.

01:31:11.075 --> 01:31:14.257
It's exactly the question they want you asking.

01:31:14.297 --> 01:31:15.178
Where do I fit in?

01:31:15.258 --> 01:31:16.398
You're an American.

01:31:16.519 --> 01:31:17.659
That's where you fit in.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.701
You're a member of your own community.

01:31:20.761 --> 01:31:21.722
That's where you fit in.

01:31:25.484 --> 01:31:26.945
And you're a citizen of your state.

01:31:27.105 --> 01:31:27.966
That's where you fit in.

01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:45.177
There's no need for there to be white communities and black communities any more than there's a need to have people who are cheering for the Chicago Cubs never socialize with people who cheer for the Chicago White Sox.

01:31:45.217 --> 01:31:46.258
That would be absurd.

01:31:48.499 --> 01:31:54.561
And over the last 10 or 15 years, they've used social media and mainstream media to convince us that that's normal.

01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:59.782
that America should be divided when it wasn't that way when I was a kid.

01:32:00.642 --> 01:32:02.523
It wasn't that way when I was a kid.

01:32:10.705 --> 01:32:12.086
That's the end of that video, sorry.

01:32:13.518 --> 01:32:13.879
Marty!

01:32:13.899 --> 01:32:16.040
Welcome back, man.

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:16.961
It's good to see you, Marty.

01:32:16.981 --> 01:32:18.682
We just launched right into it.

01:32:18.702 --> 01:32:20.443
VP, ZD, MM.

01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:22.444
Double M. Great to see you guys.

01:32:22.765 --> 01:32:26.247
With the three horsemen are back to cause harm in the universe.

01:32:26.367 --> 01:32:27.548
I had so much fun last time.

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:31.671
So many people came up to me and said, you know, it was just fun to watch the interaction and banter.

01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:32.551
People like the show.

01:32:32.671 --> 01:32:33.412
People like the show.

01:32:33.452 --> 01:32:37.014
People come up to me with like a white glove and slap me across the face.

01:32:37.194 --> 01:32:38.595
Challenge me to a duel, dude.

01:32:38.635 --> 01:32:40.337
Who are these people that are talking to you?

01:32:40.357 --> 01:32:41.657
They're racist if they're using a white glove.

01:32:41.778 --> 01:32:42.118
Exactly.

01:32:42.478 --> 01:32:44.579
Thank you, there's an equity issue here.

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.901
I think people learned something last time.

01:32:47.941 --> 01:32:49.322
They may have decreased in knowledge.

01:32:49.342 --> 01:32:50.342
No, no, they learned.

01:32:50.382 --> 01:32:52.183
You were dropping facts on their head, Marty.

01:32:52.203 --> 01:32:53.604
They weren't ready to hear them.

01:32:53.644 --> 01:32:54.384
Hey, I'm a fact guy.

01:32:54.544 --> 01:32:56.205
You're a fact guy.

01:32:56.225 --> 01:32:57.906
We're all in the news business, I know, right?

01:32:58.026 --> 01:32:58.686
In the news business.

01:32:58.746 --> 01:33:01.028
I've had faxes dropped on my head.

01:33:01.188 --> 01:33:01.728
That's the difference.

01:33:02.048 --> 01:33:10.593
You know, it's funny, knowledge can neither be created nor destroyed according to the first law of thermodynamics, and yet we managed to destroy knowledge in the last episode we did.

01:33:11.553 --> 01:33:14.235
You know how you can add these arbitrary titles to what you are?

01:33:14.375 --> 01:33:19.358
You know, like most people decided to add epidemiologists to their, you know, credentials.

01:33:19.438 --> 01:33:20.459
I'm a eucronologist now.

01:33:20.479 --> 01:33:22.460
Trust me, I'm an epidemiologist.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.441
Right, eucronologist.

01:33:23.461 --> 01:33:25.522
That's a new specialty that's emerging on Twitter.

01:33:25.762 --> 01:33:26.303
Yeah, I see them.

01:33:27.515 --> 01:33:29.776
So my latest is I'm adding fact checker.

01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:31.497
Oh, of course.

01:33:31.697 --> 01:33:33.618
You guys can be fact checkers, too.

01:33:33.778 --> 01:33:37.299
I'm you have to already have a strong point of view and be unwilling to reconsider it.

01:33:37.339 --> 01:33:38.500
That's the key.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.380
That's a key thing.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.600
You have to have strong opinions.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:41.561
Yes.

01:33:41.681 --> 01:33:42.701
Actually, this is important.

01:33:42.801 --> 01:33:51.385
So a friend of mine, Daniel Schmachtenberger, wrote a piece on his Concilius Projects dot org website about the dangers of fact checking.

01:33:52.005 --> 01:33:53.966
And seriously, so we know we're in.

01:33:55.137 --> 01:33:56.660
I really like this comment right here.

01:33:56.801 --> 01:34:02.794
Ever notice how Maha is make America healthy again instead of make Americans healthy again?

01:34:02.894 --> 01:34:04.297
Very, very nice comment.

01:34:04.337 --> 01:34:04.698
Well done.

01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:10.572
Information ecology that's so fractured, you don't even know what's true anymore.

01:34:10.592 --> 01:34:11.873
Like, I don't know, are the Ukrainians winning?

01:34:11.933 --> 01:34:12.573
Are they losing?

01:34:13.374 --> 01:34:13.995
Am I bald?

01:34:14.035 --> 01:34:14.595
Do I have hair?

01:34:15.356 --> 01:34:16.097
It's not clear.

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:21.301
So there are three kind of things that you can do with fact-checking that can mislead people, even with real facts.

01:34:21.782 --> 01:34:26.225
And one is the failure to contextualize the fact, right?

01:34:26.265 --> 01:34:27.046
So we see this all the time.

01:34:27.066 --> 01:34:27.707
Like, here's a study.

01:34:27.847 --> 01:34:32.391
The study shows, without a doubt, that masking a two-year-old prevents apocalypse.

01:34:34.381 --> 01:34:35.462
It's a parachute, ZDogg.

01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:36.202
It's a parachute.

01:34:36.262 --> 01:34:39.544
If you don't study a parachute, you just know it works.

01:34:39.564 --> 01:34:42.586
You selectively did choose things you don't want to study.

01:34:42.847 --> 01:34:43.827
You call them parachute.

01:34:44.107 --> 01:34:44.568
Of course.

01:34:44.708 --> 01:34:45.368
Issues, right?

01:34:45.588 --> 01:34:45.949
That's right.

01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:47.650
It's a hallmark of medicine.

01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:52.273
You know, we've published a couple of papers on this where we looked at people who claim their medical practice is like a parachute.

01:34:52.713 --> 01:34:55.695
And it's almost always something that could easily be assessed.

01:34:55.855 --> 01:34:59.798
And 50% of the time, it has already been studied in a randomized study, proving it ain't no parachute.

01:35:00.459 --> 01:35:07.244
So people listening may not know, the parachute argument is when you say, well, we don't do a randomized control trial with parachutes.

01:35:07.324 --> 01:35:09.907
It's just so obvious that they're effective.

01:35:09.947 --> 01:35:18.114
So people selectively use that to say, look, I believe in this medical dogma and there's no need to study it because it's like a parachute.

01:35:18.474 --> 01:35:18.914
Exactly.

01:35:19.295 --> 01:35:19.715
Exactly.

01:35:19.935 --> 01:35:21.517
And so the parachute of masks

01:35:22.077 --> 01:35:22.677
for two-year-olds.

01:35:22.977 --> 01:35:25.458
Cloth masks.

01:35:25.478 --> 01:35:25.898
The good one.

01:35:25.998 --> 01:35:28.239
The one that everyone's wearing.

01:35:28.259 --> 01:35:32.941
But the truth is the majority of people in this country who wore masks to this day, it's still cloth.

01:35:33.401 --> 01:35:37.743
The last people in America forced to wear cloth masks are kids two through five.

01:35:38.543 --> 01:35:40.303
In New York City and other places.

01:35:40.344 --> 01:35:43.225
Servers, waiters, staff.

01:35:43.505 --> 01:35:44.525
The least powerful people.

01:35:44.665 --> 01:36:01.614
yeah the defense speaking of least powerful defenseless people so my daughter a middle schooler age 14 they just got rid of the mask mandate public schools here yet every single child in her school wears a mask they don't want to piss off he's looking at two people what happened one above marty teachers great and one to the left to the right of z dog unions where they say

01:36:01.914 --> 01:36:04.195
You know what, it's okay if schools closed for a year.

01:36:04.535 --> 01:36:07.036
If they don't catch up with their timetables, that's okay.

01:36:07.196 --> 01:36:14.799
But what they did learn was what was important, like the words coup and insurrection, which it's really, school is not about accomplishing knowledge.

01:36:14.839 --> 01:36:19.881
It's about understanding your social purpose, diversity and inclusion, and social justice.

01:36:20.622 --> 01:36:25.424
Greatest domestic policy failure of this pandemic in the US, there are many failures.

01:36:25.764 --> 01:36:28.605
We'll have to have a contest for which, but I'd say the greatest is school closure, one year.

01:36:29.312 --> 01:36:40.255
Yeah, I would say that's number one, school closures, forced cloth masks on kids, ignoring natural immunity, surface transmission instead of aerosolized virus, the interval between the two doses.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:41.675
That's another one, yeah.

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:42.055
That's a good one.

01:36:42.475 --> 01:36:45.556
I mean, we closed schools, but we didn't close universities.

01:36:45.636 --> 01:36:46.336
Think about that.

01:36:48.156 --> 01:36:48.376
Right?

01:36:48.637 --> 01:36:51.357
We closed schools, but we didn't close universities.

01:36:51.397 --> 01:36:52.738
And we really didn't close schools.

01:36:52.778 --> 01:36:54.558
We just sent kids home with iPads.

01:36:56.434 --> 01:36:58.997
And these three doctors don't see that as a problem.

01:36:59.037 --> 01:37:00.539
That couldn't have damaged anybody.

01:37:00.579 --> 01:37:01.860
That didn't put anybody behind.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.762
They just talked through it as being silly in 2022.

01:37:04.783 --> 01:37:05.304
Those were my kids.

01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:14.963
But that's it.

01:37:15.003 --> 01:37:16.663
That's a partial list.

01:37:16.683 --> 01:37:18.003
That's an opening salvo.

01:37:18.023 --> 01:37:18.744
Okay, I see.

01:37:18.804 --> 01:37:21.524
Yeah, draconian hospital visitation policies.

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:22.544
Yeah, we talked about that.

01:37:22.744 --> 01:37:23.845
Boosters for children.

01:37:23.905 --> 01:37:26.285
Boosters for young people with no data to support.

01:37:26.305 --> 01:37:26.985
Oh, that's true.

01:37:27.065 --> 01:37:30.466
And you want to boost in the most young people and not boost the elderly.

01:37:30.506 --> 01:37:31.706
That was apparently the new strategy.

01:37:31.726 --> 01:37:34.267
Basically, the one size fits all thirst.

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:35.067
That wasn't good.

01:37:35.187 --> 01:37:38.628
Public health officials want a single message to apply to everybody.

01:37:38.868 --> 01:37:44.132
But that's what they say is their justification for why they have this backwards protocol.

01:37:44.372 --> 01:37:46.334
But the truth is, there's so much complexity already.

01:37:46.614 --> 01:37:51.838
For instance, if you got Pfizer, you got 30 micrograms, two doses, 21 days apart, that's what they wanted.

01:37:51.998 --> 01:37:53.199
But if you got Moderna, it was 100.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.261
28 days apart.

01:37:55.781 --> 01:38:03.325
And then initially the Moderna EUA for booster was after six months, Pfizer was five, but then they homogenized that using Pfizer data for Moderna.

01:38:04.446 --> 01:38:06.867
So my point is just, and then J&J was initially one dose.

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:07.288
He has kids.

01:38:07.308 --> 01:38:09.289
And of course they wanted mRNA booster after the one dose.

01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:12.351
My point is just that we have always tolerated complexity.

01:38:12.731 --> 01:38:19.295
The problem is for the complexity, they don't want to acknowledge natural immunity complexity or the fact that younger people have lower risks than older people.

01:38:20.115 --> 01:38:30.297
Younger people having lower risk than old people and natural immunity is the only script that people like Mike Yeadon had from the very beginning.

01:38:30.417 --> 01:38:32.538
Very similar to what this guy's saying now.

01:38:33.278 --> 01:38:41.740
Mike Yeadon was there in the very beginning to argue for natural immunity and for there being a difference between the risk for old people and young people, which

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:55.987
Like it or not, reinforces the existence of the virus, reinforces the existence of a novel pathogen that can be detected by PCR and can be sequenced if you have enough of the primer pairs.

01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:16.893
This is the one way to see through all of these people because if they wanted to get rid of this illusion, they would always go back to the basis of it, which is that in order to have this argument, you must accept that PCR works to track a free-range RNA in the background

01:39:19.306 --> 01:39:30.111
of a human being's microbiome of the biology around us, which is absolutely flooded with genetic signals from bacteria.

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:31.532
Flooded.

01:39:33.237 --> 01:39:49.473
There is absolutely no way that these rudimentary PCR reactions are capable of pulling out a signal that is useful in diagnosing the presence of a much larger RNA molecule, because that is the mythology.

01:39:51.375 --> 01:39:57.661
That by amplifying a small sequence with a set of primers from a background

01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:08.888
that you have indicated that there is a presence of a sequence that is 10 times or 100 times longer than the amplicon that they found.

01:40:10.549 --> 01:40:26.953
We found Once Upon a Time on a little scrap of paper, so we're gonna assume that a Charles Dickens novel is in your lungs in many, many, many, many, many, many copies because we found Once Upon a Time in cycle 22.

01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:39.276
And so there's all kinds of ways that a nefarious group of people that wanted to create the illusion of something could create it.

01:40:39.637 --> 01:40:51.625
Because about the only thing they can do is make reasonably short sequences of pure DNA and put it in places.

01:40:53.166 --> 01:40:56.388
And then they could find it with PCR and it would work really well.

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:59.871
And even, even Carey Mullis would agree that, oh yeah, they found it.

01:41:01.584 --> 01:41:06.388
But the argument that they're making is that it's on a background that doesn't matter.

01:41:06.949 --> 01:41:14.955
And that's why they can use such a rudimentary thing as a PCR test with a single amplicon and a single pair of primers.

01:41:17.678 --> 01:41:25.144
Because they're finding a signal that is equivalent to the sentence, once upon a time, in a library full of fiction books.

01:41:28.939 --> 01:41:44.002
And that is the most inadequate analogy I've come up with in probably five years to describe how irreducibly complex this genetic background of signaling is and how much they have to get us to ignore.

01:41:44.502 --> 01:41:50.023
And that is why they tell us stories exclusively about RNA that infect us.

01:41:51.503 --> 01:41:53.164
It's very likely that there are no

01:41:54.996 --> 01:41:56.965
RNA that infect us.

01:41:57.568 --> 01:41:58.954
Think about that for a second.

01:42:00.785 --> 01:42:03.447
they don't want to acknowledge, then they say, you can't handle that complexity.

01:42:03.627 --> 01:42:07.550
You can handle all the complexity we want you to handle, but not the complexity that we don't.

01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:10.332
And this, again, is how you lie with facts.

01:42:10.712 --> 01:42:15.856
So the idea that you decontextualize a fact, you take it out of the context.

01:42:15.956 --> 01:42:25.744
Once again, this is a kind of military psyop, because what you see here is somebody who's purporting to explain what's being done to us.

01:42:27.264 --> 01:42:32.947
how they're using facts to get us to do what they want to, even though they're, it's nefarious.

01:42:33.568 --> 01:42:53.199
It's very similar, but less extreme than what Robert Malone has toured the world and written a book published by CHD and Skyhorse Publishing about how the Cywar works and why he was on stage with Sasha Latupova and that Mahaltra guy from the UK and Meryl Nass.

01:42:54.079 --> 01:43:00.544
on stage in Stockholm in January of 2023, all with those people saying that you're never going to figure out who it is.

01:43:01.384 --> 01:43:06.267
You have no hope of figuring out who it is, because it is the Psywar of America.

01:43:06.308 --> 01:43:15.374
And they showed the video of the Psywar advertisement for America's army.

01:43:16.434 --> 01:43:27.606
Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Sasha Latupova, and Aseem Malhotra did that in Sweden with Mike Palmer from the Doctors for COVID Ethics in 2023.

01:43:27.966 --> 01:43:32.251
These are all traitors to Earth's grandchildren.

01:43:33.032 --> 01:43:34.213
That's how bad this is.

01:43:34.253 --> 01:43:35.895
They're all doing it.

01:43:41.308 --> 01:43:42.610
You're never gonna figure it out.

01:43:43.331 --> 01:43:46.235
And if you do, it's this guy who's gonna tell you what's going on.

01:43:46.335 --> 01:43:47.817
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:48.458 --> 01:43:49.680
That's how they pretend.

01:43:52.234 --> 01:43:53.595
Well, what were the limitations of the study?

01:43:53.615 --> 01:43:54.856
What are the limitations of the data set?

01:43:54.936 --> 01:43:57.137
What is the actual context of this civilization?

01:43:57.177 --> 01:43:58.758
You're putting this data into all of that.

01:43:58.978 --> 01:44:04.061
You take it out and you go, hey, did you know the study showed that masking a two-year-old means less COVID?

01:44:04.441 --> 01:44:06.603
It's like, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

01:44:06.623 --> 01:44:08.304
So that's one way to lie with facts.

01:44:08.404 --> 01:44:12.326
And we've been lied to with facts, I think, for a lot of this, don't you think?

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:14.467
On all sides of this, COVIDian and COVIDiate side.

01:44:14.687 --> 01:44:18.870
You're using data now and facts and taboo.

01:44:20.006 --> 01:44:29.642
It's actually scary because what we've been lied to about is actually that there is a health freedom movement in America, an anti-vax movement in America, because that's what we've been lied about.

01:44:29.682 --> 01:44:30.343
There isn't one.

01:44:31.493 --> 01:44:33.154
There is no health freedom movement.

01:44:33.595 --> 01:44:40.140
This guy, this guy, and the other guy, Marty, are not part of a health freedom movement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:40.741
at their head.

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:44.344
What you saw was a very elaborate theater.

01:44:45.144 --> 01:44:48.087
It was ultimately designed to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:48.147 --> 01:44:52.070
into a position of power, but I think they kind of tricked him.

01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:59.476
I think they probably got him really fired up about running for president, all the while knowing he didn't have a chance because he wasn't in the script.

01:45:00.959 --> 01:45:09.624
And they probably even published this book with the intention of making sure that Bobby believed in himself because other people believed in him.

01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:17.108
So much so that they wrote a book about how he could become president by being an independent candidate and joining the ticket of somebody else.

01:45:17.188 --> 01:45:20.029
And lo and behold, that almost happened.

01:45:23.071 --> 01:45:23.831
And this book is from 2008.

01:45:29.642 --> 01:45:38.548
And now these guys are getting power at the FDA, which I think is one organization that they definitely want to change drastically its mandate.

01:45:39.417 --> 01:45:42.019
from safe and effective medical devices.

01:45:42.079 --> 01:45:48.604
They don't want that anymore because there's still a vulnerability there that this whole PCR illusion can be dismissed by the FDA.

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:56.371
If the FDA were to just focus on, okay, let's go back and look and see how many of those tests actually did anything.

01:45:56.431 --> 01:45:59.453
And let's see what we spent our money on, but they never will.

01:46:01.295 --> 01:46:02.676
Not unless we make it happen.

01:46:04.155 --> 01:46:13.497
But there were over 220 EUA-granted tests in America that defined the very illusion that these guys are sure exists.

01:46:14.297 --> 01:46:25.159
A novel virus killing thousands, if not millions, that the vaccine has saved people from, kept them out of the hospital, and it's the grandmothers that didn't choose to get the vaccine.

01:46:25.179 --> 01:46:26.200
That's their own risk.

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.900
They chose to do that.

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:30.000
Those are the only grandmothers that are gonna die.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.041
That's what they said in the episode two months before this one.

01:46:33.951 --> 01:46:35.093
You really shouldn't be doing that.

01:46:35.113 --> 01:46:44.946
You should just come up with a, you should meet with the marketing department and come up with an easy message that everyone will be able to follow without asking any questions.

01:46:44.966 --> 01:46:46.888
You know, I heard this interesting analysis.

01:46:46.948 --> 01:46:48.510
Burger King, have it your way.

01:46:49.051 --> 01:46:49.311
Yes.

01:46:49.331 --> 01:46:49.611
Brilliant.

01:46:49.732 --> 01:46:50.572
Learn from the king.

01:46:50.752 --> 01:46:51.093
Yes.

01:46:51.393 --> 01:46:51.673
Yes.

01:46:51.893 --> 01:46:52.714
That guy had it right.

01:46:52.754 --> 01:46:56.536
He was a little dysmorphic, a little shady looking, a little frightening to children.

01:46:57.057 --> 01:46:58.338
But there's a Burger King avatar.

01:46:58.438 --> 01:46:59.318
Oh, I remember now.

01:46:59.378 --> 01:47:00.459
It's a weird dude.

01:47:00.499 --> 01:47:01.180
Weird looking dude.

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.181
Dude, just grill the burgers and shut up.

01:47:03.201 --> 01:47:04.942
Man, I'll go with Grimace any day over that Burger King.

01:47:04.962 --> 01:47:05.503
Dude, Grimace.

01:47:05.543 --> 01:47:05.843
Grimace.

01:47:05.863 --> 01:47:06.183
That guy.

01:47:06.263 --> 01:47:07.464
OK, let me tell you about Grimace real quick.

01:47:07.504 --> 01:47:07.824
He's purple.

01:47:07.844 --> 01:47:08.425
That's McDonald's, isn't it?

01:47:08.485 --> 01:47:08.885
Yeah, it's Mickey D's.

01:47:08.905 --> 01:47:09.305
It's McDonald's.

01:47:09.325 --> 01:47:09.786
It's Mickey D's.

01:47:09.806 --> 01:47:10.546
You're shifting here.

01:47:10.766 --> 01:47:13.608
Grimace had central obesity, purple striae.

01:47:13.809 --> 01:47:14.789
He was a little psychotic.

01:47:14.849 --> 01:47:15.670
Type 2 diabetes.

01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:17.331
He had type 2 diabetes.

01:47:17.371 --> 01:47:18.772
He's cushingoid.

01:47:19.172 --> 01:47:20.312
He had adrenal storm.

01:47:21.913 --> 01:47:22.714
Some kind of storm.

01:47:23.074 --> 01:47:24.655
Lots of storms going on in there.

01:47:24.695 --> 01:47:28.497
Yeah, we can do a sleeve or a gastric bypass on him.

01:47:28.557 --> 01:47:29.718
No, why don't you get to the source?

01:47:29.758 --> 01:47:30.598
Take away the adrenal.

01:47:30.618 --> 01:47:33.900
No, we don't want to deal with the underlying issues that bring people to care.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.442
Listen, ever since the Hamburglar had his ripple, it's been downhill since then.

01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:41.363
Don't talk about food as medicine and school lunch programs.

01:47:41.883 --> 01:47:45.603
We only talk about surgical outcomes after bariatric surgery.

01:47:46.364 --> 01:47:58.506
That's a good point that in many ways, like the fact that as a culture, you know, we've never really dealt with the obesity epidemic at the root level of, you know, the kinds of processed foods we feed kids and the terrible school lunch programs we offer.

01:47:58.866 --> 01:48:01.106
And we want to deal with it with this kind of last ditch solution.

01:48:01.126 --> 01:48:05.067
A lot of ways is kind of similar to COVID-19, not getting to the root causes.

01:48:05.227 --> 01:48:05.787
That's right.

01:48:05.807 --> 01:48:05.947
Yeah.

01:48:06.207 --> 01:48:26.227
And that's the exciting thing right now, people, doctors, I find are dying to reach out into the community, get out of the bounds of the walls of the hospital, where they treat things at the end, you know, last stages of illness, and start to talk about cooking classes for people with diabetes, and stress management, and

01:48:27.128 --> 01:48:34.352
sleep medicine applied to high blood pressure management, you know, stuff beyond just sort of the whack-a-mole once they come in with the problem.

01:48:34.392 --> 01:48:35.593
So that's, that's an exciting trend.

01:48:35.873 --> 01:48:37.014
And it does apply to COVID.

01:48:37.634 --> 01:48:45.979
The interesting thing I heard about COVID recently from an HIV scientist was that we all bring our biases to any problem in medicine, right?

01:48:46.059 --> 01:48:47.841
We all have our approach.

01:48:47.881 --> 01:48:52.343
I mean, basically... Is that like a, is that like military intelligence?

01:48:52.683 --> 01:48:52.884
Like,

01:48:56.192 --> 01:48:57.633
Wow, that's really funny.

01:48:57.693 --> 01:48:58.154
I'm sorry.

01:48:58.614 --> 01:49:00.716
I think it's very funny.

01:49:01.616 --> 01:49:06.801
The people in charge of COVID policy, the people making all the decisions, are basically HIV doctors.

01:49:08.062 --> 01:49:11.124
And so with HIV, there was no natural immunity.

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:19.691
So interesting, right, that he's citing something that we've cited before, that it's interesting how all of these people have trained with Fauci on HIV.

01:49:20.802 --> 01:49:26.454
So they either have to be so naive as to accept that, you know, you're just baking cakes.

01:49:26.514 --> 01:49:31.885
So you just go ahead and we'll tell you what cakes to bake and you'll rise in the thing.

01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:35.291
or they're actually read in on the narrative.

01:49:35.331 --> 01:49:38.074
And I don't think there are very many people that are read in on the narrative.

01:49:38.114 --> 01:49:49.943
I'm not sure, but I think that, for example, Walensky, her commitment to the lie suggests to me that she was probably read in on the narrative and knows to a certain extent what the lie is.

01:49:51.204 --> 01:49:55.848
I think Redfield definitely knows that HIV was a lie.

01:49:57.209 --> 01:49:59.570
I'm sure that Robert Gallo has to know.

01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:04.914
I'm sure that somebody like Horowitz, you know, this guy right here, he knows it's a lie.

01:50:05.354 --> 01:50:11.098
That's why he wrote a giant book about HIV and all the other viruses that were going to come and get us.

01:50:11.118 --> 01:50:12.299
This guy knows it's a lie.

01:50:12.859 --> 01:50:15.541
That's why this book is still a tome.

01:50:16.261 --> 01:50:29.188
and why his video questioning Robert Gallo about carcinogenic feline viruses and the little words are coming down, that's why that video was seen by everybody in the last five years.

01:50:34.051 --> 01:50:41.655
I mean, I also really believe that Kerry Mullis was kind of an unwitting participant in this as well.

01:50:41.715 --> 01:50:42.535
I don't think that

01:50:45.276 --> 01:50:57.164
Joshua Lederberg can be so close to him in terms of timeline and position and yet never mentioned in the narrative about Cary Mullis.

01:50:57.224 --> 01:50:58.625
It's just, there's too many.

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:02.928
And then also having him connected to the 9-11 Commission.

01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:06.631
And I mean, I just, it goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:07.091 --> 01:51:07.872
We have them.

01:51:08.673 --> 01:51:10.514
We have them by the short hairs right now.

01:51:11.618 --> 01:51:17.081
With HIV, the risk was equally distributed in the population in their mind.

01:51:17.322 --> 01:51:22.525
That's at least direct quote from Dr. Fauci during the AIDS epidemic was that everybody is at risk.

01:51:24.166 --> 01:51:29.609
So, you know, here you have an infection where there is natural immunity, it's effective, it's real.

01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:36.193
Here you have an infection where- Here you have an infection where you have natural immunity and it's real.

01:51:37.374 --> 01:51:39.936
There's no way, there's no reason to talk like that.

01:51:41.286 --> 01:52:02.418
except that he's on a script and he's supposed to hit these marks just like Kevin McKernan did last year in that stream that I played a couple days ago at the end where he says there is an RNA hit it it can be sequenced it can be moved from person to person and it does cause something something like it it's it was remarkable

01:52:03.933 --> 01:52:10.301
There's a 10,000-fold difference in the risk between an older person with comorbidity and a young, healthy teenager.

01:52:11.242 --> 01:52:19.632
And yet, so that natural bias, it's not suggesting people weren't well-intended, but they're bringing maybe the biases from that HIV perspective.

01:52:20.313 --> 01:52:23.458
in managing that epidemic to COVID.

01:52:36.517 --> 01:52:37.938
You don't mandate things.

01:52:38.838 --> 01:52:39.839
You teach people.

01:52:39.879 --> 01:52:43.260
You give them the tools, resources, and autonomy to make these decisions, and then they do it.

01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:45.882
We never forced condoms on gay men.

01:52:45.922 --> 01:52:47.403
We never forced abstinence on you.

01:52:47.683 --> 01:52:53.746
We had conversations with them as grownups, and we haven't really done that very well in COVID.

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:59.369
In fact, we understand risk so badly to circle back to my daughter's story in the classroom.

01:52:59.409 --> 01:53:00.889
So everybody's wearing masks.

01:53:01.009 --> 01:53:03.131
My daughter says, well, she feels pressured to do it, so she's fine.

01:53:03.151 --> 01:53:03.671
She doesn't have a problem.

01:53:03.691 --> 01:53:04.691
Even though there's no requirement.

01:53:04.971 --> 01:53:05.712
There's no requirement.

01:53:06.252 --> 01:53:08.074
It's the polite thing to do, Marty.

01:53:08.334 --> 01:53:10.316
Everybody is double and triple vaccinated.

01:53:10.336 --> 01:53:12.238
Do they know what life is like without a mask?

01:53:12.299 --> 01:53:14.521
I mean, some kids that are four or five years old.

01:53:14.681 --> 01:53:21.068
My daughter entered middle school as a teenager in COVID and has never, I mean, had a year of a year of remote class.

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:29.131
And then, so the teacher, so one student has the audacity to take their mask off in the class.

01:53:29.671 --> 01:53:41.356
The teacher said, Billy Bob, or whatever your name is, if you're gonna take your mask off, I'm not comfortable with that because I'm high risk, she's my age, triple vaccinated, or she or she.

01:53:41.717 --> 01:53:45.078
And I'm gonna put you next to the door.

01:53:45.698 --> 01:53:49.340
So I'm gonna move you, says this to the whole class, move you to the door.

01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:52.882
Why the door, not the window?

01:53:53.382 --> 01:53:57.484
By the way, all the windows are open in the classroom in the winter.

01:53:57.604 --> 01:53:59.965
So these three guys accept that the masks work.

01:54:00.986 --> 01:54:02.627
They have to accept that the masks work.

01:54:02.667 --> 01:54:04.568
They're not taking any stance on it at all.

01:54:04.608 --> 01:54:05.448
This is in March of 2022.

01:54:06.869 --> 01:54:10.151
And this video goes on and on and on.

01:54:10.231 --> 01:54:14.073
How is it possible that he's at the head of the FDA right now?

01:54:14.953 --> 01:54:16.154
How is it possible?

01:54:18.358 --> 01:54:20.379
You have to excel through the open window.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.641
Because they're high risk.

01:54:24.721 --> 01:54:26.442
Wait, hold on.

01:54:26.462 --> 01:54:27.262
So they put him by the door.

01:54:27.282 --> 01:54:28.403
They put him by the door.

01:54:28.423 --> 01:54:29.263
Where the air is stagnant.

01:54:29.283 --> 01:54:31.464
Where the air is stagnant.

01:54:31.565 --> 01:54:34.866
And my daughter comes home and tells me this story, and she's like, yeah, I feel really bad for this kid.

01:54:35.106 --> 01:54:36.447
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:54:36.827 --> 01:54:38.688
I'm like, you're a smart girl.

01:54:38.928 --> 01:54:42.010
But you know who did is the person who doesn't understand risk.

01:54:42.750 --> 01:54:44.011
And that's what we're getting at here.

01:54:45.276 --> 01:54:48.777
And so again, as I said before, I think it's an important point from this stream.

01:54:49.257 --> 01:54:57.159
These guys are making the subconscious argument to everybody listening to this, that informed consent involves understanding the risks.

01:54:57.779 --> 01:55:01.159
And so you need a mathematical representation of all the risks.

01:55:01.259 --> 01:55:04.580
And then only then can you make an informed choice.

01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:13.342
It has nothing to do with understanding the nature of the risk, nothing to understanding the nature of the risk by understanding the biology of the argument.

01:55:14.755 --> 01:55:23.720
Because you see, if the argument is that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is a great way to augment your immune system, that's not a good argument.

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:32.064
And then to say that, well, we're gonna do that for a novel virus that we can't even prove exists, now that's a doubly, triply bad argument, you see?

01:55:32.405 --> 01:55:40.289
And instead of getting down to the root of the root of the root of the bullshit, these guys are debating whether or not certain age groups should get boosted or not.

01:55:41.621 --> 01:55:50.645
And whether or not masks, mask mandates, or is there pressure, or, you know, putting the kid by the door, oh, maybe you should exhale out the window, ha, ha, ha.

01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:55.127
It's as malevolent as possible.

01:55:56.567 --> 01:55:58.648
because it is a military exercise.

01:55:58.668 --> 01:56:00.748
You wanna know what the military exercise was?

01:56:00.848 --> 01:56:03.089
It's the script that these three guys are on.

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:07.070
It's the script that Sasha Latupova is on with regard to batches.

01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:15.153
It is the script with regard to the contamination of the Pfizer shot with a plasmid from manufacturing.

01:56:15.253 --> 01:56:23.456
These are the military script that this is on to get maximum compliance out of our children.

01:56:24.397 --> 01:56:36.360
please understand there is not a way to bring this with a lot of sunshine and laughter if you understand how the dangerous position that my country is in

01:56:38.804 --> 01:56:44.868
But don't you feel like, you know, we've conditioned, I mean, we've conditioned the teacher into believing this in a few ways.

01:56:44.928 --> 01:56:45.509
Number one.

01:56:45.809 --> 01:56:46.810
It's not their fault, yeah.

01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:48.231
Yeah, I don't think it's the teacher's fault.

01:56:48.251 --> 01:56:49.451
I mean, it's kind of a cultural thing.

01:56:49.551 --> 01:56:51.413
Like, where would I trace the root to?

01:56:51.813 --> 01:56:54.275
I mean, obviously, anxiety was through the roof in March and April 2020.

01:56:54.315 --> 01:56:56.176
People wanted to do something.

01:56:56.456 --> 01:57:02.900
And even though the entire preexisting body of evidence was quite critical of cloth masking, which is why the WHO and CDC didn't recommend it initially.

01:57:03.721 --> 01:57:07.964
Cloth masking, again, we're throwing in details that don't matter.

01:57:09.346 --> 01:57:09.607
Right?

01:57:09.787 --> 01:57:10.750
Oh, maybe it's just N95.

01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:12.253
Oh, I don't know, man.

01:57:12.313 --> 01:57:12.915
Oh, wow.

01:57:14.841 --> 01:57:17.982
People wanted to do something, and there was a strong advocacy movement.

01:57:18.162 --> 01:57:23.424
There's been a great article about this called The Mask Debacle in Tablet Magazine, and it really kind of unpacks some of the history here.

01:57:23.884 --> 01:57:30.186
And so then people jumped aboard, but of course, to jump aboard and make a switch this big, you kind of gotta be a propagandist and kind of really sell it.

01:57:30.506 --> 01:57:33.207
And then quickly, by the summer, masks were a symbol of virtue.

01:57:33.427 --> 01:57:37.948
Trump didn't wear his, and of course, he's the bad guy, he's the horrible person, so we wanted to do the opposite of him.

01:57:38.228 --> 01:57:41.009
So in the liberal place where we're located,

01:57:41.269 --> 01:57:42.510
Anything Trump does, we'll do the opposite.

01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:43.070
We'll do the opposite.

01:57:43.090 --> 01:57:45.171
And really hard to prove how much better we are than him.

01:57:45.451 --> 01:57:46.932
Obviously, that's the philosophy.

01:57:47.172 --> 01:57:48.693
And so then this person digs in more.

01:57:48.713 --> 01:57:52.915
They're in a culture where everyone they're talking to talks about how important the mask is.

01:57:53.095 --> 01:57:57.098
And then the next thing they know, they're behaving the way, if you really stand out.

01:57:57.158 --> 01:58:07.203
It sounds like they understand exactly how Bannon's script is going to herd as many conservative cats as possible into a fake health freedom movement.

01:58:08.444 --> 01:58:12.789
It sounds like they understand very well what the goal of this operation is to do.

01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.971
I can think about it.

01:58:18.251 --> 01:58:19.772
It's quite cruel that a teacher would.

01:58:20.172 --> 01:58:22.594
Oh, it's to single out a child to make them feel.

01:58:22.694 --> 01:58:23.554
You know, I can imagine this.

01:58:23.774 --> 01:58:24.655
I feel bad for this kid, too.

01:58:24.755 --> 01:58:25.756
Yeah, yeah.

01:58:25.796 --> 01:58:26.576
Here's the thing.

01:58:26.696 --> 01:58:27.277
And the kids, right?

01:58:27.897 --> 01:58:28.477
It's right.

01:58:30.099 --> 01:58:30.539
Doesn't hurt.

01:58:30.559 --> 01:58:32.180
They're all vaccinated in that school, right?

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.921
Oh, they're all boosted.

01:58:33.941 --> 01:58:34.822
Except for my daughter.

01:58:34.842 --> 01:58:38.224
Don't tell the museum.

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:38.804
Oh, yeah.

01:58:41.266 --> 01:58:42.667
Don't tell the museum staff.

01:58:51.365 --> 01:58:58.173
I'm not very good at faking laughter, so maybe I'll just use the laugh track and I'll just try to go along with it.

01:58:58.333 --> 01:58:59.475
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:59:05.579 --> 01:59:10.624
Where is he looking?

01:59:10.664 --> 01:59:22.155
The museums are having their own panel to discuss the Moderna data the drop today because you want the museum the museum should be the first person to decide on the new vaccine data and then let's go to tell me about this data tell me about this data what's going on with Moderna you want to talk about that

01:59:22.615 --> 01:59:25.758
I was going to say, distorted perception of risk out there.

01:59:25.818 --> 01:59:32.864
So did you see the study of a journalist who studied bicyclers in Palo Alto?

01:59:33.504 --> 01:59:41.831
And he found that 46 percent were wearing a mask while riding their bike, but only right by Stanford campus.

01:59:41.851 --> 01:59:42.712
He was at an intersection.

01:59:42.732 --> 01:59:44.713
And only 17 percent were wearing a helmet.

01:59:48.474 --> 01:59:50.715
So there's this completely distorted perception of risk.

01:59:51.095 --> 01:59:58.678
And you're being, I think, appropriately kind in saying people have a distorted perception of risk because of the messaging that's being sent out.

01:59:59.078 --> 02:00:09.402
Sonia Sotomayor probably truly believes- What you need to see is that what they are doing is essentially selling Twitter, selling Facebook, selling YouTube.

02:00:09.682 --> 02:00:10.182
It works.

02:00:10.976 --> 02:00:12.217
Look what we were able to do.

02:00:12.637 --> 02:00:17.560
What do you think that toilet paper rush at the beginning of the pandemic was all about?

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:31.629
It was about demonstrating to the elites, demonstrating to the ruling class that social media had so much power, we could make people fight over toilet paper in the fricking supermarket.

02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:40.514
And we can make Americans believe that people are fighting about toilet paper so they will go fight about it because they need toilet paper too.

02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:46.552
And this has been demonstration after demonstration after demonstration.

02:00:46.592 --> 02:00:50.153
Look at how we can make people behave the way we want them to behave.

02:00:50.634 --> 02:00:53.035
And it's not being done by edicts.

02:00:53.235 --> 02:00:55.015
It's being done by social media.

02:00:55.396 --> 02:00:57.357
It's being done by fake podcasts.

02:00:59.457 --> 02:01:11.683
Fake podcasts are the most dangerous because if there are three actors that are coordinating their lying, anyone, anyone, no matter how smart you are, does not have a chance if you trust them.

02:01:13.407 --> 02:01:14.602
You don't have a chance.

02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:19.572
There were 100,000 kids in the hospital.

02:01:19.612 --> 02:01:21.313
Are you saying that number was a little off, Marty?

02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:23.555
Well, I think it was 1,300 at the time.

02:01:23.575 --> 02:01:26.216
And no one's a little lower than 100,000.

02:01:26.437 --> 02:01:30.920
The thing is, the CDC still can't tell us how many were for COVID versus with COVID.

02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:35.022
They just acknowledged they were wrong about the number of children who have passed away with this virus.

02:01:35.062 --> 02:01:35.443
Oh, yeah.

02:01:35.483 --> 02:01:36.263
They cut it by 24%.

02:01:36.924 --> 02:01:41.206
The total COVID death tally in the United States, the CDC just cut by 24%.

02:01:41.587 --> 02:01:44.128
And they still can't tell us how many were for COVID.

02:01:44.148 --> 02:01:45.289
We're not talking about something fancy.

02:01:45.309 --> 02:01:45.890
No fancy math.

02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:46.630
We're talking about counting.

02:01:47.571 --> 02:01:49.912
But how do you count?

02:01:52.553 --> 02:01:59.837
They're not really aware of how you count and that counting could be distorted because of financial incentives.

02:01:59.877 --> 02:02:01.878
They're not aware of any of that.

02:02:01.898 --> 02:02:06.321
They're not aware of the incentive to fake death certificates because you could get like $35,000 a pop.

02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:11.652
I'm going to play devil's advocate.

02:02:11.852 --> 02:02:12.893
No children should die.

02:02:12.913 --> 02:02:14.435
Of course, children don't die.

02:02:14.495 --> 02:02:14.676
Right.

02:02:14.756 --> 02:02:16.518
And children die from more than COVID.

02:02:16.538 --> 02:02:21.825
They die from profound isolation and mental illness and homicide and suicide.

02:02:22.426 --> 02:02:23.187
And opioids.

02:02:28.366 --> 02:02:31.049
They die from not knowing their times table.

02:02:31.089 --> 02:02:32.930
In other words, poor education is correlated.

02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:33.751
That's been proven.

02:02:33.811 --> 02:02:45.222
Many studies show that failure to attain these traditional educational outcomes, like mathematics and reading, are profoundly tied to life expectancy and upward mobility in these things.

02:02:45.282 --> 02:02:46.323
That's health.

02:02:46.863 --> 02:02:47.944
Learning your times table is health.

02:02:48.044 --> 02:02:49.826
It's a type of health to get around in this world.

02:02:50.086 --> 02:02:57.055
And so they're not acknowledging that setting back the entire American population of children a couple of years in school is not a problem.

02:02:57.576 --> 02:03:00.139
Again, it sounds like the plan is right on target.

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:01.600
I agree.

02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:04.481
Especially if you're Asian or Indian.

02:03:04.861 --> 02:03:07.522
We were born knowing it.

02:03:07.782 --> 02:03:09.863
I'll kill you if you don't learn your times table.

02:03:09.983 --> 02:03:10.663
I mean, it's a help.

02:03:10.743 --> 02:03:12.063
It's an existential risk.

02:03:12.083 --> 02:03:14.844
My dad would always kind of make special equations for us to study at home.

02:03:14.864 --> 02:03:16.605
And he's like, why are they only teaching you one variable?

02:03:16.625 --> 02:03:18.245
You know, let's get another variable in there.

02:03:18.285 --> 02:03:19.986
Come on, let's make it a little harder.

02:03:20.106 --> 02:03:21.666
But to your point, Marty.

02:03:22.786 --> 02:03:30.869
I would really be interested to see a mathematical discussion between Matt Crawford and these three about differential equations.

02:03:31.954 --> 02:03:34.775
or even just, you know, equations with more than one variable.

02:03:34.816 --> 02:03:35.876
I would love to see it.

02:03:36.036 --> 02:03:40.298
I would love to see them discuss the solution of a polynomial equation.

02:03:40.398 --> 02:03:41.399
Holy crap.

02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.180
Oh, helmet wearing a mask.

02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:48.122
You know, maybe there's no reason to protect a brain that's not working when it's right.

02:03:48.763 --> 02:03:52.504
Oh, well, Marty, but the bottom line is those those helmets have big holes in them.

02:03:52.524 --> 02:03:53.805
They're going to let virus right through.

02:03:53.885 --> 02:03:55.466
Why would you waste your time wearing that?

02:03:57.362 --> 02:04:03.167
But I just gave this talk at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, SGO.

02:04:03.227 --> 02:04:04.068
That must have been fun.

02:04:04.308 --> 02:04:04.648
It was good.

02:04:05.289 --> 02:04:06.150
I actually bet it was a lot.

02:04:06.250 --> 02:04:07.111
I learned a ton.

02:04:07.151 --> 02:04:10.173
When I'm at these meetings and specialties outside of my own, I learn a ton.

02:04:10.253 --> 02:04:11.054
I love learning.

02:04:11.154 --> 02:04:15.578
And so they were telling me about some of the new chemotherapy pathways.

02:04:16.338 --> 02:04:20.042
I was talking to some folks about the uterus transplant operation.

02:04:20.062 --> 02:04:22.544
Apparently they've done 20 of these at Baylor.

02:04:23.284 --> 02:04:29.107
and they transplant the uterus, the individual gets pregnant, and then they remove the uterus afterwards.

02:04:29.207 --> 02:04:30.588
Oh, so you don't get rejection and all that.

02:04:30.628 --> 02:04:31.869
Yeah, you don't have to deal with the immunosuppressants.

02:04:32.369 --> 02:04:33.409
I mean, it's amazing.

02:04:33.449 --> 02:04:34.830
We have a protocol at Johns Hopkins.

02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:36.031
Is that for men?

02:04:37.792 --> 02:04:38.832
Is that for men?

02:04:41.213 --> 02:04:42.374
What are they talking about?

02:04:43.519 --> 02:04:46.541
and to start this.

02:04:46.782 --> 02:04:50.144
So could a male get a uterine transplant?

02:04:50.244 --> 02:04:52.446
I mean, a genetically male.

02:04:52.686 --> 02:04:53.687
How dare you ask that?

02:04:53.827 --> 02:04:55.968
Actually, I asked the same question when I heard this.

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:58.270
Yeah, of course you did.

02:04:58.330 --> 02:05:00.212
There would be no other reason not to do it.

02:05:02.914 --> 02:05:07.677
There would be no other reason to do that in a woman.

02:05:07.717 --> 02:05:08.638
That's just remarkable.

02:05:08.658 --> 02:05:09.259
I'm for ZDoggMD.

02:05:12.614 --> 02:05:13.014
We need more Zs.

02:05:13.034 --> 02:05:14.235
There's got to be some vetting process.

02:05:14.255 --> 02:05:14.776
Yeah.

02:05:14.856 --> 02:05:16.157
We need more Zs in the world.

02:05:16.217 --> 02:05:16.717
Yes, we do.

02:05:16.757 --> 02:05:17.177
Definitely.

02:05:17.377 --> 02:05:18.318
So what's the answer to that question?

02:05:18.338 --> 02:05:21.320
So there's discussion about it, but it's not part of any current protocol.

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.623
But I guess even if they did that, they'd have to do a lot of hormone regulation too?

02:05:25.143 --> 02:05:25.964
Yeah.

02:05:25.984 --> 02:05:27.805
Wasn't this covered in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?

02:05:28.185 --> 02:05:28.445
Oh, yeah.

02:05:28.465 --> 02:05:29.446
It was called Twins.

02:05:29.526 --> 02:05:30.006
Wasn't it?

02:05:30.067 --> 02:05:30.807
No, it wasn't Twins.

02:05:32.208 --> 02:05:33.189
I forget, but it was awesome.

02:05:33.209 --> 02:05:34.250
I thought it was a Schwarzenegger.

02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:37.673
You know, anything that Schwarzenegger does is scientifically perfectly accurate.

02:05:37.793 --> 02:05:39.015
Did you see his talk thing on Russia?

02:05:39.035 --> 02:05:39.855
Oh, it was crazy awesome.

02:05:39.875 --> 02:05:40.496
It was really good.

02:05:40.676 --> 02:05:42.258
He's like, listen to my friends in Russia.

02:05:42.738 --> 02:05:43.899
Hear me now and believe me later.

02:05:43.919 --> 02:05:45.320
They are lying to you.

02:05:45.501 --> 02:05:46.762
Putin is a bad man.

02:05:46.782 --> 02:05:49.204
But it was a great story, that inspirational story.

02:05:49.224 --> 02:05:50.465
Does he wear a helmet when he bites?

02:05:50.505 --> 02:05:51.907
I don't know if there's helmets that large.

02:05:53.524 --> 02:05:54.004
for Arnold?

02:05:54.284 --> 02:05:59.447
You just if you wear a lot of masks, I mean, it functions as a helmet.

02:06:00.007 --> 02:06:05.609
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have a great message for that's for everyone.

02:06:05.649 --> 02:06:07.610
But I do have a message that is for anyone.

02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:08.951
And the message is very simple.

02:06:09.011 --> 02:06:17.635
People were put in place on social media to make sure that the damage from transformation and transfection could be effectively blamed on the novel virus spike protein.

02:06:18.959 --> 02:06:23.922
Those people are behind a Truman show that has placed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:23.982 --> 02:06:48.514
into a position of power, Marty McCarty in a position of power, Binet Prasad in a position of power, and Jay Bhattacharya, Jayanta Bhattacharya, in a position of power, all because the Human Genome Project is moving very quickly to its next stage, where medical records will be stored en masse on a giant database, and then AI will be used

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:55.536
to interface those records with the genomes that have been collected throughout the pandemic, or something like that.

02:06:55.676 --> 02:07:02.879
I don't work for the Department of Energy, so I can't really tell you what their plan is, but I am sure that this is not over.

02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:10.942
I am sure, thanks to Mark Kulak, that it is very likely that the Human Genome Project was right dead center in the middle of 9-11.

02:07:12.864 --> 02:07:14.005
Terrorists my ass.

02:07:14.506 --> 02:07:24.959
That's the reason why nobody talks about Brandy Vaughn and why nobody talks about the six million votes that autism was worth in the UK when Polly Tommy was on 90 billboards in her bra.

02:07:31.630 --> 02:07:48.779
It's the same reason why Suzanne Humphreys is in front of us not saying what she needs to say or rather saying exactly what she needs to say instead of saying that there's a huge difference between ingestion and injection and there's no way to justify injection of any combination of substances as a medicine.

02:07:49.879 --> 02:07:52.620
She is put in place specifically not to say that.

02:07:53.361 --> 02:07:55.922
Just like Mary Holland is put in place.

02:07:56.522 --> 02:07:59.344
Just like this clown was put in place.

02:08:00.996 --> 02:08:03.238
here in Pennsylvania and has been with us before.

02:08:03.278 --> 02:08:06.060
We appreciate him coming back to the Capitol today to share his expertise.

02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:13.665
Dr. Lyons-Weiler is a research scientist, author, and president and CEO of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge.

02:08:13.725 --> 02:08:15.246
Thank you, doctor, for coming.

02:08:16.287 --> 02:08:16.687
Thank you.

02:08:17.207 --> 02:08:25.233
Representative Metcalf, I want to thank the media for being here and thank everyone online for sharing this across all social platforms.

02:08:26.276 --> 02:08:29.939
I'm an objective research scientist and I have two main points that I want to drive home.

02:08:29.979 --> 02:08:31.380
The first one is the number 21%.

02:08:32.241 --> 02:08:34.723
I want you to remember that number and write it down.

02:08:34.743 --> 02:08:37.765
It's a very, very important number to you if you're an American citizen.

02:08:38.246 --> 02:08:44.550
The second thing, and I'll get to that in a minute, the second thing that I want to say is I'm not here in support of any particular bill.

02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:48.353
I run a not-for-profit and I can't say yay or nay on my opinion.

02:08:48.393 --> 02:08:52.937
What my personal opinion is is muted and I don't mind that, but I can condemn

02:08:53.376 --> 02:09:04.207
the politicization of your health, the politicization and the commoditization of the American citizen's health, Pennsylvania citizen's health is not a commodity.

02:09:04.608 --> 02:09:09.092
It is neither a monetary commodity nor is it a political commodity.

02:09:09.653 --> 02:09:10.694
And shame on you.

02:09:11.184 --> 02:09:23.612
If you have changed your position or held on to a position in the light of evidence from data from studies that tell you that your position is wrong simply because you disagree with President Trump, shame on you.

02:09:24.013 --> 02:09:24.993
You're hurting people.

02:09:25.333 --> 02:09:26.554
You're hurting society.

02:09:26.814 --> 02:09:28.015
You're destroying businesses.

02:09:28.395 --> 02:09:28.996
Shame on you.

02:09:29.556 --> 02:09:30.417
Is it not obvious?

02:09:32.344 --> 02:09:33.664
Is it not obvious?

02:09:34.545 --> 02:09:46.648
This is a guy who before the pandemic argued that vaccine preventable diseases were circulating asymptomatically among people who were vaccinated because that's how vaccines work.

02:09:47.848 --> 02:09:59.371
He is a guy who wrote a book about the environmental and genetic causes of autism to obfuscate the fact that no intramuscular injection is justified as medicine.

02:10:01.212 --> 02:10:04.054
and that the entire idea of a vaccine is a lie.

02:10:07.137 --> 02:10:19.127
And here he is in February of 2020, pretending to be on Trump's team, pretending to do something like speak out, and these people are somehow there pretending to listen to him.

02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:24.211
Now that I got that out, I can talk about some science.

02:10:25.332 --> 02:10:28.535
Okay, historically, coronaviruses

02:10:29.341 --> 02:10:32.523
Vaccines for coronaviruses have had a terrible safety record.

02:10:34.405 --> 02:10:38.868
There is a condition known as disease enhancement due to pathogenic priming.

02:10:39.728 --> 02:10:57.360
And this was discovered in vaccinated animals in past vaccine safety studies when they did conduct vaccine safety studies on animals on coronavirus vaccines where vaccinated animals got more serious disease after being vaccinated and then when they acquired an infection from the wild type vaccine.

02:10:58.106 --> 02:11:02.367
More of animals got serious infections, serious conditions, and more animals died.

02:11:04.348 --> 02:11:19.672
In my peer-reviewed research paid for the citizens of the United States of America through donations to IPAC, prior to the development of any COVID vaccines, I found that all but one of the proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 virus have what we call unsafe epitopes.

02:11:21.243 --> 02:11:30.407
right, which are parts of proteins that are capable of causing immune conditions, autoimmune conditions and immune responses against proteins in our own body.

02:11:31.067 --> 02:11:34.329
This is peer reviewed research, and I'll be happy to provide the press with.

02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:36.049
I'm sorry, I see this is wrong.

02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:38.370
It's not February of it's not February.

02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:39.171
It's October.

02:11:39.431 --> 02:11:39.751
Sorry.

02:11:39.931 --> 02:11:41.572
I don't know why I didn't change that.

02:11:42.152 --> 02:11:42.892
I had it changed.

02:11:42.932 --> 02:11:43.172
Sorry.

02:11:43.252 --> 02:11:43.933
It's October.

02:11:44.973 --> 02:11:46.754
Their reference after this.

02:11:47.611 --> 02:11:58.434
About a third of the proteins that might be targeted by autoimmune conditions by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, either through infection or injection, target the immune system.

02:11:59.054 --> 02:12:07.697
But from the start, it looks like this virus has evolved the ability to attack our immune system as part of its disease-causing capacity.

02:12:08.437 --> 02:12:11.098
This pathogenic priming, I predicted.

02:12:11.858 --> 02:12:14.859
It's funny because actually the echo means that there's nobody there.

02:12:15.802 --> 02:12:21.108
In my study, which parts of the human body would likely be most affected by pathogenic priming?

02:12:21.449 --> 02:12:27.396
And now studies by medical physicians, by medical teams around the world are confirming my predictions.

02:12:27.917 --> 02:12:32.743
This is not simply a respiratory virus with respiratory symptoms.

02:12:33.143 --> 02:12:35.366
This affects many tissues across the body.

02:12:35.908 --> 02:12:38.029
There is no vaccine yet in October of 2020.

02:12:38.449 --> 02:12:40.149
He's only talking about the virus.

02:12:40.309 --> 02:12:43.350
And there's some grave concern if you're going to get infected.

02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:47.191
But where's the grave concern if you're going to be injected with these same proteins?

02:12:47.572 --> 02:12:55.594
Not a single, to my knowledge, not a single vaccine manufacturer took heed of my warning to remove those unsafe epitopes from the vaccines.

02:12:56.192 --> 02:13:01.636
before they formulated their vaccines, in spite of being... So you can take out the dangerous epitopes.

02:13:01.716 --> 02:13:16.727
If you'd have just taken out the prion protein, if you'd have just taken out the amyloidogenic protein, the anterotoxin B homology, or the HIV inserts, if you'd have just taken out the fear and cleavage site, then everything would be fine.

02:13:19.089 --> 02:13:21.850
What a remarkable argument to be making in October of 2020.

02:13:24.431 --> 02:13:31.275
The guy that CHD puts on stage at every single event that they've ever put on that I've been aware of.

02:13:32.416 --> 02:13:37.079
That's on stage regularly with Mary Holland since like 2015.

02:13:41.282 --> 02:13:42.582
America needs your help.

02:13:43.243 --> 02:13:47.185
Americans need help waking up to see the trap that they're in.

02:13:47.245 --> 02:13:51.048
There is a fake health freedom, fake anti-vax movement

02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:57.913
And one of the victims of it, one of the puppets of it, one of the I don't know what's of it is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:58.994 --> 02:14:04.918
He emailed my study with a plea to please consider taking out those unsafe epitopes.

02:14:05.698 --> 02:14:09.941
Your body has 500,000 peptides throughout your life.

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:13.584
The coronavirus has something like 28 proteins.

02:14:13.624 --> 02:14:20.409
What's the probability that there's going to be many proteins that match at small segments of immunogenic epitopes, very high?

02:14:22.059 --> 02:14:27.281
We now have results from front runner vaccines from these hybrid trials where they skipped over the animals trials.

02:14:27.881 --> 02:14:42.706
FDA, in absolutely ignoring safety margin in a stunning decision, decided to allow Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers to skip the most important step in vaccine safety for coronavirus, which is the animal trials.

02:14:43.227 --> 02:14:47.108
No, this is completely wrong and then we'll end the show.

02:14:47.668 --> 02:14:49.449
It is transfection.

02:14:50.345 --> 02:14:50.665
Okay.

02:14:51.426 --> 02:14:53.487
It's, it's, it's transfection.

02:14:53.527 --> 02:14:59.371
We already know what happens in animals because we use it all the time on the bench in academia.

02:14:59.931 --> 02:15:01.172
No trials required.

02:15:02.033 --> 02:15:05.575
You could have asked any academic biologist that did what I did.

02:15:06.135 --> 02:15:08.097
How well does this work as a vaccine?

02:15:08.117 --> 02:15:10.138
And we would have said, that would be absurd.

02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:14.661
We kill every animal that we transfect.

02:15:21.897 --> 02:15:24.541
Ladies and gentlemen, these people were put in place.

02:15:24.641 --> 02:15:25.462
They are liars.

02:15:25.482 --> 02:15:26.924
They are traitors.

02:15:26.964 --> 02:15:29.248
They are traitors to our grandchildren.

02:15:29.308 --> 02:15:37.840
They have perpetuated a myth about a novel virus and all the variables we have to consider, all the different risks we have to measure and quantify.

02:15:38.661 --> 02:15:42.002
When in reality, they're all playing for the same team, the Human Genome Project.

02:15:42.022 --> 02:15:43.082
That's why Kevin's there.

02:15:43.122 --> 02:15:44.122
That's why Claire's there.

02:15:44.142 --> 02:15:45.303
That's why Jessica's there.

02:15:45.343 --> 02:15:47.023
That's why Robert's there.

02:15:47.063 --> 02:15:48.204
That's why Meryl is there.

02:15:48.264 --> 02:15:49.704
They're all part of the same team.

02:15:50.164 --> 02:15:54.965
And this team goes all the way back when this scheme was conceived.

02:15:55.005 --> 02:15:56.666
It's a national security

02:15:57.774 --> 02:15:58.174
issue.

02:15:58.575 --> 02:16:00.837
It is a national security priority.

02:16:00.877 --> 02:16:02.778
It is part of the national defense.

02:16:03.419 --> 02:16:08.062
And Mark's book, Germs, stated it exactly.

02:16:08.122 --> 02:16:12.426
Mark's book is one of the only books that even mentions Joshua Lederberg.

02:16:13.146 --> 02:16:17.109
That alone should put it on the outskirts of the tiles.

02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:19.091
Right, Vinay?

02:16:22.113 --> 02:16:24.135
This is one seamless narrative

02:16:25.595 --> 02:16:29.776
And it's been seamless at least, at least since George H.W.

02:16:29.816 --> 02:16:30.096
Bush.

02:16:34.098 --> 02:16:36.699
But the Vaccine Act was with Reagan, I think, in 84.

02:16:38.619 --> 02:16:39.520
And where are we now?

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.981
The FLCCC has renamed themselves the Independent Medical Alliance.

02:16:44.481 --> 02:16:49.723
They stand on the integrity of one man, this guy, Merrick,

02:16:52.216 --> 02:16:57.338
And of course they chose other people with very confusing names so that you would never really hear Merrick's name.

02:16:58.479 --> 02:16:59.799
Merrick is actually a hero.

02:16:59.879 --> 02:17:05.982
Paul Merrick is the guy who figured out that you can treat people with sepsis with a big dose of vitamin C and it works.

02:17:08.924 --> 02:17:13.586
And so they put Pierre Kory on him very early and Pierre Kory and him started this.

02:17:13.646 --> 02:17:20.949
And Pierre Kory has been touring with him around the world and letting him say what he needs to say on stage, but always standing in front of him

02:17:22.679 --> 02:17:26.140
And it's still happening today because of course this guy's now standing in front of him.

02:17:26.201 --> 02:17:27.321
Who's else in this picture?

02:17:27.861 --> 02:17:29.522
Look who else is in this picture.

02:17:29.922 --> 02:17:43.408
There's the pathologist from Duke and good friend of Brett Weinstein, who was in the signal chat with me in 2021 with Brett Weinstein when I told them all of this.

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.543
and then ignored it for the last four years.

02:17:47.203 --> 02:17:55.534
This guy was promoted on PBS NewsHour in 2008 as a ex-pharma exec who was gonna become a homesteader.

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:57.797
Sounds an awful lot like Robert Malone.

02:17:59.858 --> 02:18:05.040
This is the duped, I think very duped Byron Bridle.

02:18:05.601 --> 02:18:08.562
He has been very much in need of being controlled.

02:18:09.022 --> 02:18:12.644
One of the people in this picture that's controlling him is this Mumpert lady here.

02:18:12.724 --> 02:18:18.406
Mumpert works for CHD, and she's made the argument that we need genetically specific vaccines.

02:18:18.446 --> 02:18:20.807
That's the reason why kids get injured in the first place.

02:18:21.728 --> 02:18:22.428
They're back there.

02:18:23.655 --> 02:18:24.595
That's Ryan Cole.

02:18:24.655 --> 02:18:31.676
He was in front of a lot of churches with Lee Min Yan and Robert Malone and Karmadoc.

02:18:31.956 --> 02:18:32.797
Like, come on.

02:18:33.777 --> 02:18:36.697
And then we have this Lindsay lady.

02:18:36.757 --> 02:18:39.578
She's also been touring around the world with these people lately.

02:18:39.638 --> 02:18:43.839
It's all just, only has to be a few people that really are in on it.

02:18:45.019 --> 02:18:48.339
Like, who is that guy that took over for Pierre Cory?

02:18:48.439 --> 02:18:48.999
Come on.

02:18:49.399 --> 02:18:52.240
And then these people all have fellows.

02:18:53.390 --> 02:18:55.690
And they give them money every month, a stipend.

02:18:58.951 --> 02:18:59.171
Whoa.

02:18:59.191 --> 02:19:04.492
I think somebody sprayed something into the room here.

02:19:05.452 --> 02:19:11.053
And now, this week, they have the mac daddy of them all.

02:19:12.513 --> 02:19:22.555
They have Andrew Wakefield on with Paul Merrick to make sure that once and for all, they can finally, you know, get this guy the justice and karma he deserves.

02:19:23.885 --> 02:19:25.686
It's all the same show, ladies and gentlemen.

02:19:25.786 --> 02:19:27.567
This is for all the children of Earth.

02:19:27.627 --> 02:19:28.587
It's for all the marbles.

02:19:28.627 --> 02:19:31.068
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:43.354
If you want to see through it, you got to figure out what this bad biology is and clean it out of your head and replace it with something else so that you can understand how they've used a background to bamboozle us.

02:19:43.414 --> 02:19:45.956
And if we don't teach the children the truth,

02:19:46.956 --> 02:20:10.707
They will be enslaved by this and we can teach the truth very simply ladies and gentlemen, they use non-specific PCR tests to misconstrue a Irreducibly complex background into something very specific that was evolving and could be tracked by this non-specific PCR test it's a lie and people like Vinay Prasad and ZDogg and Marty McCarty have never had the

02:20:11.167 --> 02:20:18.173
and the biological wherewithal to question this, and that is because that's precisely why they've been chosen.

02:20:18.413 --> 02:20:20.395
RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen.

02:20:20.815 --> 02:20:25.679
It's May 5th, 2025, and it still remains something that none of these people can say.

02:20:26.059 --> 02:20:31.404
That using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real, and nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

02:20:32.551 --> 02:20:34.833
They use placebos to make this shit safe.

02:20:34.933 --> 02:20:37.315
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:20:37.355 --> 02:20:38.636
My name's Jonathan Cooey.

02:20:39.056 --> 02:20:41.198
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:20:41.218 --> 02:20:42.059
I'm happy to be here.

02:20:42.079 --> 02:20:43.279
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:20:43.299 --> 02:20:46.762
I just can't believe that this is where we are.

02:20:46.822 --> 02:20:48.083
Thanks very much for being here.

02:20:48.103 --> 02:20:49.685
Come on, baby.

02:20:49.705 --> 02:20:51.346
Whoa, you shot me in the back.
