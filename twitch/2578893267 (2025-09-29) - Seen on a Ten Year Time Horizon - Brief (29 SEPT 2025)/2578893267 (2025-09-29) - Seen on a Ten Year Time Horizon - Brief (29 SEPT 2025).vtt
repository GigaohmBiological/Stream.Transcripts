WEBVTT

01:26.711 --> 01:28.731
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

01:29.392 --> 01:35.453
This is Giga Home Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by biologists where we stay focused on the biology.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.933
We don't take the bait on social media and we love our neighbors.

01:40.154 --> 01:42.854
Today's show is going to be another guess who and when.

01:42.874 --> 01:44.574
We're going to start out with that right away.

01:45.575 --> 01:52.756
And then we'll do frontline from 2015, which I think is very instructive for understanding where we are.

01:53.676 --> 02:03.423
as seen on a 10-year time horizon, and I think that's the best way to start trying to envision how this was pulled on us.

02:04.284 --> 02:17.474
It is a 10-year theater, if not 20, but the recent theater and the recent cast were thrown in front of us repeatedly on a 10-year time frame on these same issues, with these same questions,

02:18.234 --> 02:24.597
and these same debate points with no progress in between those 10 year, in that 10 year time frame.

02:25.217 --> 02:26.277
That's not possible.

02:27.618 --> 02:32.400
The only way that that is possible is because of, yeah, the steak knives aren't very sharp.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.001
And they, they tend not to cut, it's a long shipping time.

02:37.402 --> 02:41.043
So don't get too excited about the steak knives.

02:41.523 --> 02:42.844
And then clean up in aisle four.

02:42.904 --> 02:43.104
I mean,

02:44.352 --> 02:48.578
It's only getting worse, and it's exactly how I predicted it.

02:48.658 --> 02:50.480
Unfortunately, I saw it very late.

02:51.882 --> 02:56.969
But the extent to which Bret Weinstein and these people represent a trap...

02:59.162 --> 03:01.324
Is now just really extraordinary to me.

03:01.364 --> 03:03.025
So that's what we're gonna do today.

03:03.105 --> 03:04.185
Thanks very much for joining me.

03:04.225 --> 03:18.175
Thanks for being here I'm gonna try and do it as quick as I can and get done In two hours from now because that is when I need to be in the car and on my way to the gym Thanks for being here again, and I will see you again shortly.

03:18.195 --> 03:27.041
I think what I want is this one And then I want this one

03:28.558 --> 03:29.059
Look at this.

03:29.159 --> 03:30.681
I'm starting to get better at it.

03:32.444 --> 03:34.027
I Think I think that's what I wanted.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.531
Yes Great

03:50.086 --> 03:51.667
I think truth is good for kids.

03:52.088 --> 03:55.870
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:56.391 --> 03:58.052
We want everybody to feel good.

03:58.152 --> 04:00.374
That's not the way life is.

04:05.738 --> 04:07.159
We've got to be a little serious here.

04:07.179 --> 04:11.262
I don't like to take it that way.

04:11.302 --> 04:16.185
I'd like to have some music over this, but I think it's a little more important to point out exactly

04:17.142 --> 04:21.584
what we've been trying to say one time to try and make it very clear.

04:22.745 --> 04:26.627
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:26.647 --> 04:29.148
And I have lied.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.209
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.169
I don't want to lie.

04:31.650 --> 04:32.990
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:33.110 --> 04:34.131
I try not to be a liar.

04:34.151 --> 04:35.011
I don't want to be a liar.

04:35.572 --> 04:38.293
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:38.934 --> 05:00.863
What we are suggesting is that Fifth Generation Warfare consists of a long-time horizon theater, a national security theater where actors are scripted on a need-to-know basis and they span both sides of this ridiculous argument about the biology of immunizations and public health and pandemics.

05:01.543 --> 05:02.064
This is a

05:03.447 --> 05:05.609
It's a very crucial thing to understand.

05:05.669 --> 05:13.157
We are suggesting that in order to understand what happened, you have to see when Tulsi Gabbard was inserted and how.

05:13.798 --> 05:17.842
Very similar to how Pete Buttigieg was inserted into the time

05:19.929 --> 05:20.409
What is that?

05:21.410 --> 05:35.619
The timeline and how, how all of these people arrived on stage and how they were recruited, absorbed by, or specifically put in place in order to play the role that they're playing cannot be underestimated.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.662
Their connections go back decades.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.263
And that's the problem.

05:40.403 --> 05:49.309
If you are working with people that you've known for more than 20 years, then you can trust them in a way that otherwise you could never trust somebody else.

05:50.049 --> 05:58.073
And that's the real important thing to understand here is that we're dealing with a network of people that trusts one another very much.

05:58.273 --> 06:02.175
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

06:03.996 --> 06:04.696
And I have lied.

06:04.716 --> 06:05.757
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:05.777 --> 06:06.717
I don't want to lie.

06:07.198 --> 06:08.538
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

06:08.638 --> 06:09.679
I try not to be a liar.

06:09.719 --> 06:10.559
I don't want to be a liar.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.881
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:15.082 --> 06:19.064
And so if you understand this, then you understand why this is really important.

06:21.107 --> 06:40.336
a lonely quest by a solitary genius, isolated from the world, frantically scribbling equations on a scrap of paper, and then shouting eureka and running out onto the street to tell the world about the discovery.

06:41.376 --> 06:45.538
There is no question that phenomena like that happened in the history of science.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.019
But in truth,

06:47.964 --> 06:54.999
Things that make a difference in the real world have features which are kind of hard to make a good movie out of.

07:06.428 --> 07:12.073
The new strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan City, China over a month ago.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.135
There are now more than 220 confirmed cases.

07:14.275 --> 07:20.220
We don't quite know how serious the disease is, how it's going to spread.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.983
Now there are reports of human-to-human transmission.

07:25.024 --> 07:27.647
So when was this video made and produced?

07:27.747 --> 07:30.109
What video, what is this a teaser for?

07:31.425 --> 07:32.686
It's kind of confusing, right?

07:32.726 --> 07:36.348
It's like hard to tell what time period did this come from?

07:37.228 --> 07:46.494
Again, the reason why it's starting to become hard to discern where have these videos come from in the timeframe is because all the actors are the same.

07:46.914 --> 07:48.355
All the arguments are the same.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.056
All the framing is the same.

07:51.637 --> 07:57.420
It's almost like, wait, how the hell did I step out of the time machine at the wrong place?

07:58.100 --> 07:58.801
What's going on?

08:01.331 --> 08:04.373
times more lethal than the seasonal flu.

08:04.414 --> 08:09.818
World Health Organization hit the alarm button, declaring coronavirus a pandemic.

08:09.858 --> 08:13.601
We have rang the alarm bell loud and clear.

08:13.761 --> 08:17.504
We instantaneously understood that mRNA had really high potential

08:35.535 --> 08:42.378
I saw that mRNA is a technology which could be adaptable to our vision to develop vaccines.

08:43.459 --> 08:45.860
Back then they were playing with all sorts of different technologies.

08:46.060 --> 08:50.382
As soon as I got that vial, bang, everything worked.

08:53.223 --> 08:53.944
I'm sorry, what?

08:54.384 --> 08:57.025
As soon as I got that vial, bang, everything worked?

08:57.085 --> 09:00.567
What's that guy doing in the same video as those other people?

09:01.377 --> 09:02.677
What the hell is going on here?

09:06.858 --> 09:08.619
So then we thought, well, this is interesting.

09:09.359 --> 09:12.940
Perhaps we can find ways of delivering the drugs.

09:13.300 --> 09:17.381
And of course, immediately I offered him that I will make that RNA for you.

09:17.521 --> 09:19.081
And that's how we started.

09:20.002 --> 09:22.062
A lot of people were very skeptical about that.

09:22.702 --> 09:24.543
You know, they didn't think it would work.

09:29.530 --> 09:36.376
I saw that mRNA is a technology which could be adaptable to our vision to develop vaccines.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.839
Back then they were playing with all sorts of different technologies.

09:40.219 --> 09:41.901
mRNA is a technology?

09:42.904 --> 09:46.227
I kind of thought it was this natural thing that was in all of our cells.

09:46.308 --> 09:49.691
And so mRNA is now a technology?

09:49.811 --> 09:54.055
Is that because of the M1 methyl, N1 methyl pseudouridine?

09:54.115 --> 09:55.096
Is it M1 methyl?

09:55.116 --> 09:55.837
I don't know anymore.

09:56.177 --> 09:57.419
It's so ridiculous.

10:00.143 --> 10:12.711
It's so ridiculous that that guy, Robert Malone, the guy behind Meryl Nass and CHD and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:12.791 --> 10:21.356
for the last probably decade or more, scripting their ridiculous narrative about a big top tent of health freedom.

10:23.294 --> 10:31.299
These people are frauds and they are frauds that were very specifically put in place to trap anybody that would question a narrative.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.141
Anybody that would question the narrative.

10:35.182 --> 10:39.105
And so it's very questionable at this point what's being covered up and what isn't.

10:40.202 --> 10:45.727
What I know for sure is that a trap was set for people who wouldn't believe what they were told to believe.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.769
And that trap was executed.

10:48.849 --> 11:05.583
It was a net that was trolling for like 10 years, catching all the people who would question what they are told and put them into all one basket with Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Del Bigtree and Aaron Seery and all of these clowns.

11:07.025 --> 11:08.446
I know it with my bones.

11:13.092 --> 11:17.394
As soon as I got that vial, bang, everything worked.

11:18.635 --> 11:20.396
So then we thought, well, this is interesting.

11:21.156 --> 11:24.738
Perhaps we can find ways of delivering the drugs.

11:25.078 --> 11:28.659
And of course, immediately I offered him that I will make that RNA.

11:28.820 --> 11:37.384
It's almost like Robert Malone made it work, and then Peter Cullis made it work, and then she said, well, I can make the mRNA, and then they did it.

11:37.924 --> 11:39.745
It's almost like magic.

11:40.876 --> 11:43.377
All these people are now in the same freaking film?

11:43.998 --> 11:44.878
Are you kidding me?

11:44.958 --> 11:49.941
This is 2025, ladies and gentlemen.

11:49.961 --> 11:51.402
2025, the film's coming out.

11:52.483 --> 11:56.265
All four of those people are on the front of this poster.

11:58.726 --> 12:00.307
And that's how we started.

12:01.207 --> 12:03.809
A lot of people were very skeptical about that.

12:03.929 --> 12:05.750
You know, they didn't think it would work.

12:07.884 --> 12:12.527
They take that technology, tweak it a little bit to make it work in the COVID vaccines.

12:14.769 --> 12:19.952
They take that technology and tweak it a little bit to make it work in the COVID technologies.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.714
It's, it's remarkable.

12:23.975 --> 12:24.955
Why is that not working?

12:25.916 --> 12:26.577
Talk to me, Goose.

12:28.037 --> 12:29.298
There we go.

12:38.413 --> 12:43.197
The aim was very clear, to develop a vaccine as fast as possible.

12:45.779 --> 12:48.901
The genetic COVID vaccines, they're not working.

12:57.348 --> 12:58.269
The Messenger.

12:58.289 --> 13:00.270
It's the name of the movie.

13:03.873 --> 13:05.014
It's the name of the movie.

13:07.358 --> 13:10.259
It's coming out with all of those four people on the front.

13:13.220 --> 13:15.801
The story of MRNA, are you kidding me?

13:15.821 --> 13:32.728
I don't care how many people watch it, the existence of that movie alone reveals that this is a multinational military operation and the vast majority of that military might is focused on controlling the narrative.

13:33.088 --> 13:36.950
The questions that people ask, the arguments that people have,

13:38.365 --> 13:40.246
and the myths that people propagate.

13:40.306 --> 13:41.347
That's what this is.

13:41.407 --> 13:47.250
And that's why I know, I know that these people are national security actors.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.811
They don't deserve our respect.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.852
They deserve our scorn.

13:51.512 --> 13:53.193
They should be removed from power.

13:53.273 --> 14:01.097
They should not receive any more quarter million dollar a year salaries from any more nonprofits that shouldn't exist.

14:01.137 --> 14:06.160
Those are probably nonprofits that are being protected by and funded by the government and pharma.

14:07.537 --> 14:10.878
That's why Children's Health Defense doesn't tell you where they get their money.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.958
And I have 96 subscribers.

14:15.779 --> 14:16.639
That's the reason.

14:17.099 --> 14:27.161
Because they are part of this national security script that spans nations probably loosely orchestrated around NATO and the State Department.

14:30.182 --> 14:31.242
I'm almost sure of it.

14:32.551 --> 14:34.072
but it doesn't really matter.

14:34.792 --> 14:38.515
What matters is, is that the pandemic didn't happen as they said.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.197
There's a population pyramid that explains what happened.

14:42.257 --> 14:46.760
There's a loss of control of pneumonia that explains what happened.

14:46.780 --> 14:53.064
There's a great decrease in the use of antibiotics across the Western world that explains it.

14:53.584 --> 14:59.528
And there is this motivation, of course, to manage that population pyramid that potentially explains it.

14:59.568 --> 15:00.889
There's nothing else needed.

15:01.892 --> 15:11.158
But then of course there's this really inconvenient, I don't know, half a million, 600,000, are we up to 750,000 Americans killed by opioids in the last six years yet?

15:11.679 --> 15:12.419
Maybe it's higher.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.141
And we just don't talk about that.

15:16.282 --> 15:27.529
And think about that, even if it's like half as many people killed by drugs on the street as by a virus that we couldn't contain, it's still a pretty big fricking problem, isn't it?

15:29.130 --> 15:29.851
Apparently not.

15:35.677 --> 15:38.118
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but I think we have them.

15:39.399 --> 15:40.399
I think we have them.

15:40.459 --> 15:41.480
I think it's visible.

15:41.500 --> 15:57.388
I think the same little Hollywood narrative network that was recruited and used after 9-11 was built upon and perfected and honed as a weapon.

15:58.453 --> 16:15.102
until 2015 when they started putting in place this anti-vax movement and really trying to gain control of this narrative so that it could be effectively under control at the start of the pandemic.

16:15.642 --> 16:21.005
So I'm talking about 2015 now being a time when they decided that, okay, they had to go.

16:21.025 --> 16:21.966
Don't take Tylenol.

16:22.594 --> 16:23.214
Don't take it.

16:23.435 --> 16:24.896
With Tylenol, don't take it.

16:24.976 --> 16:25.996
They had to go all in.

16:26.457 --> 16:27.738
Don't use Tylenol.

16:27.878 --> 16:28.859
Don't take Tylenol.

16:29.119 --> 16:30.740
Don't take Tylenol.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.521
Fight like hell not to take it.

16:32.721 --> 16:33.782
I think you shouldn't take it.

16:33.942 --> 16:35.143
Don't take Tylenol.

16:35.363 --> 16:36.684
The baby goes, gets a shot.

16:36.724 --> 16:38.806
They say, here, take a cup of Tylenol.

16:38.866 --> 16:39.706
I've heard that for years.

16:39.726 --> 16:39.967
Take Tylenol.

16:39.987 --> 16:48.633
So this is just a small example, the Jimmy Kimmel thing, the Kimmy Jimmel thing, is just a small example of what they can accomplish.

16:49.313 --> 16:56.937
With social media because everybody goes along with the lemming, you know wave this way wave that way He was fired.

16:56.997 --> 17:16.288
He's back on it's not that much different than what everybody that was Supposedly censored during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, then they went to gab then they went to locals I lost my youtube subscribers, whatever that was also an orchestrated way an orchestrated way to steer people to those people and

17:17.185 --> 17:21.747
to give them the air of credibility that, oh, well, they're censored.

17:21.787 --> 17:23.007
They must be telling the truth.

17:23.067 --> 17:27.009
And that was also something that they pushed themselves.

17:28.450 --> 17:31.331
And so, like I said, these people are kind of like cat herders.

17:31.991 --> 17:36.753
And the more cats they herd, the more successful they are to their bosses.

17:38.112 --> 17:48.908
And at the top of these pyramids of cat herders are these chief cat herders, like Steve Bannon, like, I guess, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:51.581 --> 17:52.401
But there are more.

17:52.522 --> 17:54.282
Del Bigtree played that role.

17:54.363 --> 18:02.347
And then as we went into COVID, of course, they needed a lot more cat herders to contain this, this not movement.

18:02.527 --> 18:03.828
It's not a movement.

18:03.888 --> 18:08.190
That's why they needed so many people on the internet that appealed to so many different people.

18:08.770 --> 18:12.432
Old men with glasses, old men that were bald, old men with beards.

18:13.713 --> 18:27.484
women with scratchy voices, muscle heads that are bald and smoke pipes or cigars, and I don't know, Canadians that sit in fancy suits with their legs crossed and talk about responsibility.

18:27.524 --> 18:38.593
They came up with this theater, this Lollapalooza of liars that were all scripted and designed to troll the internet for people who didn't believe what they were told.

18:39.460 --> 18:44.561
and bring them together under this conservative resistance, whatever, we can't separate them.

18:45.321 --> 18:48.422
They're trying to separate us and break up the movement, that kind of shit.

18:48.842 --> 18:50.622
And it was all an illusion.

18:50.682 --> 18:59.424
Meryl Nass has been involved for 20 years under the tutelage of Robert Malone, under the tutelage of Steve Hatfill.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.445
They go back a long ways.

19:04.841 --> 19:12.448
That's why on the Tommy podcast, when both Robert Malone and Steve Hadfield were on there talking about, you know, who got vetted for what, you know, U.S.

19:12.588 --> 19:19.935
Emirate and DITRA and whatever, and who sleeps on whose couch, they just happened to mention Meryl Nass.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.718
And Steven Hadfield just happened to say, oh, I don't like her.

19:27.222 --> 19:28.483
As if that wasn't scripted.

19:29.599 --> 19:34.602
but it's an admission because it's an admission that Steve Hatfield knows who the hell she is.

19:36.363 --> 19:54.394
And that is impossible to explain because again, unless you know that Steve Hatfield, you know, the guy who told us that Barney the dinosaur should mask up and that we should wear a rubber apron when we treat our sick kids in 2020, that guy was the original suspect of the anthrax bombing after 9-11.

19:54.414 --> 19:58.877
You know, the bioterrorist attack, the terror attack that would have been

20:00.148 --> 20:11.079
The one that Mark has done such a good job of laying out some alternative ideas on that nobody seemed to stumble on, despite how amazingly obvious it is.

20:11.239 --> 20:15.963
Once we started looking in the right place, it's like, whoops, all these weird things line up.

20:16.043 --> 20:17.084
Isn't that strange?

20:19.667 --> 20:23.571
And there's not just a few, ladies and gentlemen, these are scripted actors.

20:24.983 --> 20:28.145
We've been bamboozled because they've been scripted for so long.

20:28.185 --> 20:38.652
You know, the measles thing in Samoa and all that stuff is not just history with a big H. It's history with a little H. Or no, it's the other way around.

20:38.693 --> 20:41.955
It's not history with a little H. It's history with a big H and a trademark.

20:50.795 --> 20:51.676
birds chirping

21:09.758 --> 21:12.980
He's an evolutionary biologist turned celebrity atheist.

21:13.040 --> 21:21.484
He's sold millions of books since he published The Selfish Gene in 1976, and his last big hit was The God Delusion, which came out in 2004.

21:22.285 --> 21:27.768
But after all that best-selling success, do people buy into his brand of anti-religious belief?

21:27.828 --> 21:31.309
Do they agree with him that religion amounts to a pernicious virus?

21:31.349 --> 21:35.912
To find out, I've come to St Paul's Cathedral to survey a random flock.

21:36.974 --> 21:51.865
Well, I can see where he's coming from, but however, I think that religion, although it does have some bits that I think it could lose, it gives people a purpose to keep going.

21:52.205 --> 21:59.951
And I think now, if you look at what's happening particularly in the Middle East now, a lot of it is religion-bound.

22:00.551 --> 22:05.255
I'm afraid, I was brought up as a Catholic, but I'm afraid I've got very little time for that as well now.

22:06.363 --> 22:07.363
You're thoroughly lapsed.

22:07.764 --> 22:10.284
I have pretty thoroughly lapsed, yes.

22:10.685 --> 22:11.745
Do you believe in God?

22:12.405 --> 22:12.665
Yeah.

22:14.386 --> 22:16.267
Enough to go to one of these places every once in a while?

22:16.427 --> 22:18.448
Well, every once in a while, but I wouldn't say I was a Christian.

22:19.168 --> 22:20.048
What would you say you were?

22:21.929 --> 22:22.889
Festive at Christmas.

22:23.149 --> 22:23.469
OK.

22:24.370 --> 22:25.310
He still wouldn't like you.

22:25.890 --> 22:31.993
Fanatical religion is a virus, potentially, but religion in itself has a lot of good things about it.

22:32.113 --> 22:32.433
Such as?

22:34.661 --> 22:40.403
believing there's a greater purpose, life after death, those kind of things that make us feel warm.

22:41.724 --> 22:44.866
I just want to be kind of introspective on this.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.326
This is more than 10 years ago.

22:46.386 --> 22:48.367
This is around 2015 as well.

22:48.407 --> 22:49.668
It might be a little earlier than that.

22:51.329 --> 22:56.291
And I want to be a little, just let's be biologically objective here.

22:56.812 --> 23:00.834
Religion is a virus, meaning that some ideas, apparently,

23:02.422 --> 23:10.071
are so catchy that we can't really control their effect and they can actually become endemic.

23:10.852 --> 23:13.755
Essentially, they just come and we can't get rid of them.

23:13.895 --> 23:15.958
They just are here and we're stuck with them.

23:17.475 --> 23:31.661
Now I want you to see that that's the actual biological analogy that these people are engaging with when he asks them, you know, this certain dude says that religion is a pernicious virus, what do you think about that?

23:33.222 --> 23:38.985
So it's the implication of the question, the presuppositions of the question include viral spread.

23:39.885 --> 23:45.588
And the only question is whether or not religion is also kind of like that, you know, just a pain in the ass,

23:46.724 --> 24:02.037
molecule of thought that, if it has the right fear and cleavage sites, or the right HIV inserts, or I guess the right book, or the right phrases, or the right psalms, or the right verses, that, you know, we're just screwed.

24:02.777 --> 24:08.442
Holy shit, never write those down again, but they wrote them down thousands of years ago, and now we're stuck with them.

24:08.502 --> 24:11.725
That is the actual implication here.

24:11.845 --> 24:12.946
Just keep that in mind.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.389
...warm and fuzzy inside, but... What if it's a load of rubbish?

24:18.310 --> 24:19.050
No one can prove that.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.231
Do you have faith yourself?

24:21.012 --> 24:23.053
Uh... Is there someone upstairs?

24:23.934 --> 24:24.214
Yes.

24:25.415 --> 24:31.159
Richard Dawkins, you've talked a lot... See, so the idea is, is that religion couldn't be a good idea.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.282
Religion couldn't be good philosophy.

24:35.171 --> 24:37.532
Religion couldn't be useful philosophy.

24:37.712 --> 24:57.997
It is philosophy that is so pernicious that it goes viral so nasty so Out of our control because it's just they're so enticing these ideas are so enticing You know the I guess the 88 virgin myth is so enticing that people just can't help but blow themselves up It must be that right?

24:58.962 --> 25:09.785
And that's the remarkable assumption about this discussion, that religion exists despite its uselessness, despite it doing no good.

25:10.705 --> 25:25.349
It just always happens that when we find these people in the forest, they believe something about their world besides a phylogeny about trees and some story about ecosystems and food webs.

25:26.149 --> 25:26.890
Like what in the world?

25:28.710 --> 25:31.151
Are we talking about here when we talk like this?

25:31.251 --> 25:53.621
Because that is suggesting that the philosophies behind religion and the exploration of these, I don't know what you want to call them, schools of thought, are all just, again, random things that are just there because we think and we say words and we put words together and sometimes those words, you know, they're so nice together that they just stick around.

25:54.361 --> 25:55.562
It's so stupid!

25:57.577 --> 26:01.279
in terms of religion being a pernicious virus.

26:01.299 --> 26:08.844
When you talk in those sort of emotional, quite visceral terms, are you doing that to sort of raise hackles and therefore heighten the debate, do you think?

26:09.790 --> 26:11.932
I don't think I've talked a lot about it being pernicious.

26:11.972 --> 26:13.733
I'm not even sure I ever used the word pernicious.

26:13.753 --> 26:14.894
But virus is a word you've definitely used.

26:14.914 --> 26:15.715
Certainly virus.

26:16.595 --> 26:20.678
And the point there is really not the pernicious aspect, although I actually think it is pernicious.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.441
The point there is that it's infectious.

26:24.121 --> 26:33.328
It's something that grips the mind in the same way as a virus, a conventional virus grips the body, in that it takes control

26:34.649 --> 26:38.592
and it does so, the better to propagate itself.

26:38.812 --> 26:44.355
But in choosing words like that, or on occasion, I've read that you've said you despise organized religion.

26:44.495 --> 26:49.819
You know, the moment that you don't have a preacher that can sell it, it's over.

26:50.719 --> 27:00.886
If you just drop Bibles out of airplanes, they don't just convert the country that you drop them in because they're so convincing.

27:01.940 --> 27:09.265
You know, because the word of God is so convincing that if you drop it on people and they read it, well, it's done.

27:09.505 --> 27:10.626
There's my work is done.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.828
You read six pages of the Bible, you're done.

27:12.988 --> 27:13.468
It's over.

27:14.229 --> 27:19.493
As long as you read the right pages, maybe, I don't know, maybe you can make cliff notes of it and then it'll be that powerful.

27:19.573 --> 27:21.514
No, not at all.

27:24.516 --> 27:25.797
It's not at all like that.

27:27.238 --> 27:29.260
It's much more complicated than that.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.302
and yet they want to distill it down to a virus.

27:34.422 --> 27:42.407
It's something that, you know, if we just could pull our heads out and inoculate everybody against it, religion would disappear.

27:42.967 --> 27:45.529
The need to know would disappear.

27:46.729 --> 27:58.636
The obvious nature of the irreducible complexity of our world would just disappear once you inoculated everybody against this dumb idea of religion, as if religion even means anything as a word.

28:01.104 --> 28:12.909
with this guy who has just as much faith in the chemical and physical laws of the universe being able to explain his existence as a person who has faith that there is a creator behind it.

28:14.009 --> 28:16.890
The exact same amount of faith is necessary.

28:16.950 --> 28:28.155
It's just that he's tricked himself into believing that the data or the observations that he's made are evidence of something that they are not.

28:29.147 --> 28:39.039
And I suspect it's because he's not sophisticated enough to read into a lot of the details of these biological myths, and has accepted them on their face.

28:39.340 --> 28:47.991
Like, you know, the central dogma, DNA goes to RNA goes to protein, is something that he would say means that evolution is real.

28:50.452 --> 29:09.812
And the fact of the matter is, because he said yes, virus for sure, probably means already back then, at this time, he was already on this script, where he needed to convince people that viruses can go around the world, viruses can do stuff all by themselves, they hijack the system for their own benefit, is what he just said.

29:09.832 --> 29:12.095
A disbelief, actually.

29:13.012 --> 29:16.334
They're very emotive terms for someone from an academic background.

29:16.374 --> 29:18.955
Are you doing that because you feel it's in the interest?

29:19.856 --> 29:21.237
I don't actually think it is pernicious.

29:21.837 --> 29:23.998
The point there is that it's infectious.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.139
In the debate, do you think?

29:27.060 --> 29:29.201
I don't think I've talked a lot about it being pernicious.

29:29.241 --> 29:31.002
I'm not even sure I ever used the word pernicious.

29:31.022 --> 29:32.163
But virus is a word you've definitely used.

29:32.183 --> 29:33.003
Certainly virus.

29:33.864 --> 29:37.946
And the point there is really not the pernicious aspect, although I actually think it is pernicious.

29:38.546 --> 29:40.668
The point there is that it's infectious.

29:41.388 --> 29:55.852
It's something that grips the mind in the same way as a virus, a conventional virus grips the body, in that it takes control and it does so the better to propagate itself.

29:56.072 --> 29:59.973
But in choosing words like that- I mean, that is just absurd.

30:00.533 --> 30:01.994
It's so absurd.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.254
It's like, really?

30:03.274 --> 30:03.334
Wow.

30:04.574 --> 30:09.956
Or on occasion, I've read that you've said you despise organized religion or religious belief, actually.

30:10.913 --> 30:14.235
They're very emotive terms for someone from an academic background.

30:14.275 --> 30:20.378
Are you doing that because you feel it's in the interest of the cause that you're pursuing, that debate is quite highly charged?

30:20.418 --> 30:22.218
I wonder if they're as emotive as you think they are.

30:24.359 --> 30:37.886
I suspect that because we've all been brought up with this sort of culture of respecting religion, that anything comparatively mild sounds more... Have we been brought up in a culture that respects religion?

30:40.734 --> 30:41.454
Is that what it is?

30:41.554 --> 30:51.578
Because see, again, he's trying to make it seem as though the culture itself didn't have religion or that religion wasn't a universal thing only a short while ago.

30:52.738 --> 30:55.539
That's kind of, for me, where this all starts.

30:57.080 --> 31:03.602
The idea of not being that religious when I was a kid didn't mean you didn't believe in God.

31:03.642 --> 31:10.224
It just meant you kind of didn't go to church and maybe your relationship with God was private.

31:11.089 --> 31:17.392
You know, maybe you were one of these people that only prayed when it when it was really, you know, scary and you only did it alone.

31:17.492 --> 31:18.112
I don't know.

31:19.333 --> 31:27.316
But he's talking as though, you know, our society assumes that there's no God and we just kind of respect religion.

31:27.856 --> 31:29.457
But actually, that's not the case at all.

31:29.517 --> 31:32.398
He's from a society where there is a state religion.

31:32.518 --> 31:36.260
So by definition in the UK, God exists.

31:38.961 --> 31:40.422
And so it's strange because

31:41.593 --> 31:47.077
The way that he speaks about it is, I believe, out of two sides of his mouth.

31:47.197 --> 31:56.322
And it feels very dishonest, like a very rehearsed, it's like a rehearsed enchantment.

31:57.403 --> 31:59.965
Or outspoken than it really is.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.327
Do you really despise religious belief?

32:04.418 --> 32:12.642
I despise people who believe something without evidence and then go out and take action, which damages other people.

32:13.103 --> 32:13.423
Wow.

32:13.543 --> 32:28.671
So what about if you, like, for example, said that DNA proves evolution and therefore it's okay to take control of the evolution of the species and, you know, lie to people to govern them?

32:30.592 --> 32:35.594
Would that qualify as people who have faith in something with no evidence really to back it up?

32:36.294 --> 32:46.377
Because since we've sequenced the genome in 2000 or 2005 or whenever it was, Francis Collins announced it for the sixth time, we still haven't really made the progress they said.

32:46.417 --> 32:52.299
And the reason why is because the central dogma has turned out to be largely an exaggeration.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.741
Are there proteins that appear to be coded in DNA?

32:57.101 --> 32:57.361
Yes.

32:58.712 --> 33:06.437
Are there RNA transcripts that appear to be transcribed into, sorry, translated into proteins?

33:06.957 --> 33:08.418
Yes, that appears to be true.

33:09.519 --> 33:14.442
But does RNA go back into the nucleus?

33:14.482 --> 33:15.803
Yes, that appears to be true.

33:16.303 --> 33:21.366
Do ribosomes exist inside of mitochondria?

33:21.406 --> 33:21.986
Yes, they do.

33:22.046 --> 33:23.667
Do mitochondria have their own genome?

33:23.707 --> 33:24.288
Yes, they do.

33:26.159 --> 33:44.390
So what do we really know about the trajectory across time of our development into an adult and then our sort of homeostasis through adulthood?

33:44.430 --> 33:48.412
And it's not really even homeostasis because we change throughout adulthood.

33:48.552 --> 33:52.295
Older men are built differently than younger men because there's a continuum

33:53.308 --> 33:54.509
growing that happens.

33:54.649 --> 34:01.153
And it's because of, you know, you use it or you lose it, but also you can get more, et cetera, et cetera, what you ate.

34:01.793 --> 34:02.694
What's happening there?

34:02.734 --> 34:04.675
Where is that coded in the genome?

34:04.715 --> 34:06.256
Of course, we have no idea.

34:07.597 --> 34:18.703
Our assumption is, is that the laws of chemistry and physics plus proteins jiggling around in a electromagnetic soup of water molecules is a sufficient set of laws

34:20.103 --> 34:28.309
to cause the self-assembly of proteins into all the cell types and tissues and systems that we are dependent on and call ourselves.

34:30.410 --> 34:33.993
And we're supposed to just assume that that's gonna eventually all be true.

34:34.974 --> 34:46.702
Assume that it's eventually all gonna be true because it appears as though some sequences in DNA encode for the RNA that can be translated into the proteins.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.023
You see how ridiculous it is?

34:51.084 --> 34:53.065
How much more they have to explain?

34:54.206 --> 35:03.956
Nevermind the fact that we're still not talking about the immune system relative to the microbiome that is an essential part of what and who we are.

35:07.459 --> 35:14.606
It's just remarkable to me that these ideas all go back to a time when people on faith

35:16.849 --> 35:45.801
Assumed that we found DNA and therefore we were about to have all the rules of life and That's why all those Manhattan scientists Manhattan project scientists went into biology and started studying bacteria and bacteriophages the simplest expression of DNA and they thought they were going to be able to discern the basic meanings or the basic workings of life and inheritance and heredity and evolution at that scale and they failed and

35:47.284 --> 35:48.445
These men failed.

35:50.286 --> 35:51.446
They found out a lot.

35:51.746 --> 35:53.647
They've created a lot of useful tools.

35:54.368 --> 36:00.931
I mean, there's no question that something like antibody phage display is a very useful tool.

36:06.732 --> 36:21.417
but instead now we're told stories about animal viruses, animal viruses, and we're told myths about how religion is just like an animal virus and it hijacks your cells and it works for its own spreading.

36:22.797 --> 36:24.518
And it's just absurd, it's absurd.

36:30.717 --> 36:31.037
Yes.

36:31.657 --> 36:40.020
So I despise people whose belief in religion is so firm and so unshakable that they actually think it justifies killing people.

36:40.060 --> 36:41.340
And there are, of course, many people like that.

36:41.360 --> 36:46.942
But your average devout worshipper who's sitting in a pew of a Sunday morning, you clearly don't despise them.

36:47.102 --> 36:47.842
No, of course I don't.

36:47.962 --> 36:48.122
No.

36:48.362 --> 36:49.423
What are your feelings towards them?

36:50.103 --> 36:53.704
Well, I mean, they're harmless, especially Church of England.

36:53.744 --> 36:54.804
I mean, they're harmless.

36:54.844 --> 36:57.985
I don't have strong feelings one way or the other.

36:58.225 --> 36:59.706
No, of course I don't despise them.

37:00.882 --> 37:03.345
Here's the thing, I am an agnostic.

37:05.468 --> 37:09.012
I have thought about the tenets certainly of Christian belief.

37:10.411 --> 37:15.574
And as far as believing in God is concerned, sort of found them wanting, or myself unable to be convinced.

37:16.094 --> 37:19.676
But I still think, I can't possibly know whether God exists or not anymore.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.537
I mean, am I being sort of, what's the word?

37:22.557 --> 37:25.839
Oh, you know, weak-willed, guilty of not having the courage of my convictions.

37:25.919 --> 37:28.440
No, I mean, I'm an agnostic too in that sense.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.242
In The God Delusion, I made a seven point scale.

37:32.362 --> 37:37.685
One was total conviction that there is a God, and seven is total conviction that there isn't.

37:38.105 --> 37:39.286
And I put myself as a six.

37:40.186 --> 37:45.227
And so this is him representing himself as a scientist because no scientist knows for sure.

37:45.747 --> 37:47.448
You could never know anything for sure.

37:47.528 --> 37:50.328
So I'm not a seven, but I'm a six.

37:52.108 --> 37:58.270
And so you'll hear him in a second say that he would also be a six about fairies and werewolves, but of course that's just dumb.

37:59.490 --> 38:08.572
That whole idea that fairies or leprechauns are the same as, as a, I don't know what, a higher intelligence,

38:09.619 --> 38:24.503
that could be responsible for the absolutely absurdly unlikely existence of all that we see around us and its incredible interwovenness.

38:25.923 --> 38:35.986
Again, the whole assumption here, remember, is that a lightning bolt in a mud puddle and then chemistry and physics for billions of years resulted in what we have on Earth.

38:37.253 --> 38:42.575
Listen to that very carefully, because I used to accept that as a very beautiful idea.

38:43.215 --> 38:44.935
I now see it as kind of absurd.

38:46.176 --> 38:53.138
But it is a rock, a certain distance from a star, so that water can be liquid.

38:53.918 --> 39:03.681
And then that cycle repeats over and over again, where some of the water becomes solid and liquid and solid and liquid, and it can also be a gas in the air.

39:04.602 --> 39:07.344
which is a huge amount of water content.

39:07.404 --> 39:26.435
This atmosphere and water on the earth then circulated around, orbited around this sun at this distance with these, with this cyclic nature for so long that this is the result, that all of the beauty around us is the result.

39:26.516 --> 39:30.398
You know, it's just kind of like you waited long enough on the beach and before you know it,

39:31.078 --> 39:35.021
There it was, like a whole, I don't know, Lego train set.

39:37.623 --> 39:41.827
And it covers the whole beach and it's just trains everywhere and Legos everywhere.

39:41.907 --> 39:44.148
You just waited long enough and there it is.

39:44.228 --> 39:47.211
That's the laws of the universe did that.

39:48.365 --> 39:52.590
Except it's not a Lego train set made of plastic with some little motors in it.

39:53.191 --> 40:04.283
It's insects, and angiosperms, and fungi, and all of the mammals on Earth, all of the life in the oceans, all the birds.

40:05.478 --> 40:08.500
all the reptiles, the tree frogs, it's all of that stuff.

40:08.820 --> 40:24.149
And just because all of those things have DNA and that DNA codes for proteins, these people are assuming that physics and chemistry can explain everything.

40:25.630 --> 40:31.654
That there are no emergent properties, that there are no emergent properties of emergent properties.

40:33.547 --> 40:37.189
because bacteria and fungi and all these things all have DNA.

40:37.249 --> 40:37.729
That's it.

40:38.069 --> 40:42.011
And everything else is just assumed to be going to fall into place.

40:42.612 --> 40:47.434
We are just not sophisticated enough, haven't done the experiments yet, but it's all gonna fall into place.

40:47.994 --> 41:02.362
Yet all of these things that they describe as having evolved from that rock with water on it, all of these things, all of these things,

41:05.020 --> 41:08.581
are here just because of that rock and just because of that star.

41:08.641 --> 41:09.481
It's nothing else.

41:09.521 --> 41:20.344
And so that is much more extraordinary than just waiting on a beach and hoping that eventually there's going to be Lego trains there or Swiss watches or even Nike shoes.

41:22.805 --> 41:29.507
And if Nike shoes did appear on the beach, you wouldn't think that that was the result of, you know, the seasons and the tides.

41:31.943 --> 41:44.729
And at some point we're gonna have to accept the fact that these people have as much faith in the idea that chemistry and physics can explain everything as the people who believe that there is a creator.

41:50.511 --> 41:53.853
And in some ways there's a lot less assumption there.

41:56.494 --> 41:58.255
And certainly there's a lot more reverence.

41:59.537 --> 42:20.127
because in his model of the world, where it is just a rock, a good handy distance from a certain size star and a billion or so, four billion or so years, is that that requires so much perfection.

42:21.147 --> 42:22.248
Imagine that

42:25.836 --> 42:34.224
Just try to imagine it because it's molecules being in the right place at the right time consistently for four billion years.

42:34.345 --> 42:38.449
It's a lot of very good designs that for whatever reason never made it.

42:40.086 --> 42:58.835
In fact, I think that if you did a little simple computer simulation with the rules of evolution that him and Brett Weinstein believe in, there would have been, had to have been, so many magnificent random mutations that we've never actually managed to stick around that it wouldn't even make sense.

43:00.476 --> 43:04.378
The parameter space must be extraordinary that evolution has explored.

43:04.478 --> 43:06.139
Think about how stupid that is.

43:08.530 --> 43:15.692
It also means, of course, that, you know, we could have had intelligent dinosaurs that were skateboarding, but instead we wound up with intelligent apes.

43:16.372 --> 43:22.114
It's all this kind of stuff that this guy believes because DNA.

43:25.235 --> 43:26.315
That's where we are.

43:27.376 --> 43:32.237
And he can sound as condescending as he wants to, but he has as much faith as them.

43:33.985 --> 43:37.426
because he doesn't even understand the limits of his own understanding.

43:37.466 --> 43:39.326
That's the remarkable thing about it.

43:39.406 --> 43:45.507
He is certain about a lot more things than he's willing to admit.

43:47.288 --> 43:51.589
Okay, so that's kind of agnostic, but veering towards atheists.

43:51.849 --> 43:57.910
And I would be a six with respect to fairies and pixies and werewolves and things like that.

43:59.150 --> 44:01.471
But there are people who will say, because they're agnostic,

44:02.503 --> 44:04.445
That puts them absolutely right in the middle.

44:04.505 --> 44:08.868
The probability of there being a God and there not being a God is exactly 50-50.

44:09.268 --> 44:14.192
And that, I think, is the wrong sort of agnostic to be, because I think you can sort of put a probability figure on it.

44:14.553 --> 44:15.573
No, you really can't.

44:15.834 --> 44:26.782
And if you did put a probability figure on it, you would have said that Max Delbruck and Joshua Lederberg and Leo Szilard and all those guys were going to figure it out.

44:26.842 --> 44:29.584
You would have thought that by the time these

44:30.385 --> 44:36.307
The essays that make up this book were actually out that they would already know all the rules.

44:36.847 --> 44:37.567
But they didn't.

44:39.027 --> 44:40.247
They couldn't figure them out.

44:41.268 --> 44:47.149
For shit's sake, there is a book on my shelf that is titled The Bacteriophage Lambda.

44:50.750 --> 44:51.430
A whole book.

44:51.590 --> 44:54.111
It's as big as the prion disease book.

44:56.872 --> 44:58.333
But it's irrelevant biology.

44:58.373 --> 45:08.561
It's irrelevant that all of these Manhattan Project scientists studied their whole lives, and they didn't crack the puzzle, and that's no big deal.

45:13.725 --> 45:25.395
It's the most important overlooked aspect of our biological and scientific history, this weird transition from the we're going to solve it all in about 10 years

45:26.274 --> 45:32.379
let's get to it, roll up our sleeves, and then really, it's just.

45:38.183 --> 45:43.267
You can say, well, I think a God is very unlikely, but I can't actually disprove it.

45:43.307 --> 45:47.590
So I'm not a seven, I'm a 6.5 or something like that.

45:47.851 --> 45:49.092
And that's where I would put myself.

45:49.532 --> 45:52.955
What about the fact that religion in terms of its institutional influence,

45:53.675 --> 45:54.195
persists.

45:54.436 --> 45:56.657
How much does that irritate you?

45:56.957 --> 46:11.146
It's weird that those countries that have the trappings of theocracy remaining, like Britain, because we have bishops in the House of Lords and we have lots and lots of faith schools and the Queen is the head of the Church of England.

46:12.987 --> 46:19.792
It's an odd thing that those countries, like Britain, like the Scandinavian countries, which have an established church, seem to be the least religious.

46:20.432 --> 46:34.081
And a country like America, which has written into its constitution the separation between church and state, a wall of separation, as Jefferson called it, is one of the most religious countries, the most religious country in the Western world.

46:34.621 --> 46:38.504
So there's an odd negative correlation with what you might naively expect.

46:38.984 --> 46:40.125
How do you explain that, do you think?

46:41.411 --> 46:42.994
Well, various explanations have been offered.

46:43.034 --> 46:53.672
I mean, one explanation is that in a country like Britain, where religion is part of the establishment, it's become sort of boring.

46:55.076 --> 47:00.799
Whereas in America, where there's a wall of separation, religion has become free enterprise.

47:01.499 --> 47:10.383
And so you have many churches with their own television stations, their own creches to look after the children, their own gyms.

47:10.403 --> 47:12.684
They've become huge commercial enterprises.

47:13.044 --> 47:22.426
tax-free, by the way, which helps, with the televangelists having private Lear jets to jet around in and fleets of posh cars and things.

47:22.546 --> 47:23.546
It's not team biscuits.

47:24.606 --> 47:41.789
It's a very, very big business religion in America, whereas in Britain, it's become... So what I find funny is that nobody... I never thought of it until very recently, but it is strange that these Christian preachers that we know are fake

47:43.153 --> 47:44.754
These giant preachers.

47:45.014 --> 47:53.317
I had an experience with one at Willow Creek in in The Chicagoland area Bill Hybels was his name.

47:53.377 --> 48:04.382
He's absolutely a fraud there's a guy in Texas who I'm who has some fame because he had like a He has like a big stadium.

48:04.542 --> 48:06.383
I don't know and he didn't offer it to the

48:07.043 --> 48:08.964
to the hurricane victims or something like that.

48:09.004 --> 48:22.031
I can't remember that guy's story but I have a friend who actually went down to Texas to meet that guy and paid money to like shake his hand and then the guy was a total like obviously a zero right like

48:22.771 --> 48:30.355
These people are absolute frauds, and so the idea that they have jets and they have these big churches is not by accident.

48:30.395 --> 48:33.396
It's not because, oh, they're just so good at selling.

48:33.496 --> 48:37.818
It's because they are, in my humble opinion, probably government-supported.

48:39.141 --> 48:42.224
They are probably enabled by dark sources of money.

48:42.725 --> 48:44.066
That's what gives them the jets.

48:44.147 --> 48:46.649
That's what gives them this huge presence.

48:46.709 --> 48:51.415
And then that's what allows them to do the things that they do with the huge staff and whatever.

48:52.015 --> 48:54.418
It's not because of the power of God.

48:54.498 --> 48:55.099
I'm sorry.

48:55.119 --> 48:58.122
I know this is a very risky thing to say, but I,

49:01.127 --> 49:18.981
I fooled around with being a member of an evangelical church when I was in college and this is Willow Creek in Illinois and I went so far as to be on stage and supposedly being baptized by this Bill Heibel and he wouldn't even touch my forehead.

49:20.102 --> 49:22.644
I knew what I was looking at while I was on stage.

49:24.460 --> 49:41.849
I knew on stage, it was the most religious experience I've ever had in my life as a Catholic kid on stage at Willow Creek Church when I knew for sure 100% that it was, was Bill Heibel was a liar, like completely a fraud.

49:44.330 --> 49:45.071
And it's sad.

49:45.091 --> 49:46.931
I just feel like I have to say it.

49:47.531 --> 49:50.292
And I will say it until the day I die.

49:50.352 --> 49:53.873
I know for sure that that's what I was shown or saw.

49:54.854 --> 49:56.854
And he did not touch my forehead.

49:56.934 --> 49:58.395
He did not touch me at all.

49:58.515 --> 49:58.955
And I think

49:59.515 --> 50:03.998
The only thing I know for sure is that he looked me right in the eye and I looked him right back without blinking.

50:04.478 --> 50:18.248
So what I'm trying to suggest to you is, is that America has been under attack for some time and that a lot of this stuff that he's even talking about now with these preachers and how it's gone crazy in America is by design.

50:18.308 --> 50:20.129
And where are we now, 10 years later?

50:20.549 --> 50:24.512
We're talking about the American nationalist Christian movement, right?

50:24.572 --> 50:27.114
The Christian nationalist movement and they're terrorists.

50:27.574 --> 50:29.115
That's by design.

50:35.037 --> 50:38.578
Thoughts are boring and people don't really take it very seriously one way or the other.

50:39.138 --> 50:41.238
Politics is very reluctant to go anywhere near this.

50:42.038 --> 50:46.760
I mean, in terms of the solutions to some of what you're talking about, the only place we can look is to politics.

50:47.340 --> 50:48.480
The state has to act.

50:49.420 --> 50:51.101
Perhaps things have to be legislated for.

50:52.658 --> 50:56.662
And yet, I mean, there was a hell of a fuss when Ed Miliband recently said he was an atheist.

50:56.902 --> 50:59.604
There's a source of, it goes back to what you said before, I think, about not offending.

50:59.624 --> 51:05.209
Don't forget that Dawkins was on stage with Brett Weinstein in 2015, debating evolution.

51:05.309 --> 51:11.734
And some people will play clips where Brett Weinstein supposedly kills him, you know, wastes him with his big theories.

51:11.794 --> 51:15.997
And in others where Dawkins can't stand and dunks on Brett Weinstein.

51:16.037 --> 51:19.821
And that actually is now, of course, being promoted by Pangburn.

51:20.481 --> 51:30.764
the same people who put Dan Wilson, Dan Farina, or Dave Farina, Pierre Cory, and Steve Kirsch on stage together like a week ago.

51:32.444 --> 51:46.988
And of course, I don't know if you missed it or not, but on Piers Morgan on X and wherever else Piers Morgan is, Piers Morgan had Brett Weinstein on just a couple of days ago about the mRNA shot, followed by Dave Farina,

51:48.018 --> 51:55.288
Professor Dave explains the guy who was just on stage dunking on Corey and Kirsch for an hour with Dan Wilson.

51:55.348 --> 52:04.021
So if you can't see that this is all one theater with various actors on both sides of a ridiculous narrative,

52:06.482 --> 52:07.923
I think this show isn't for you.

52:07.983 --> 52:09.305
This show isn't for everyone.

52:09.345 --> 52:17.693
It's for anyone that wants to see the truth, but it's not for everyone because it is hard to see the script on a 10-year timeline or a 10-year time horizon.

52:17.713 --> 52:19.635
It's hard to even think that way.

52:20.255 --> 52:21.997
Some people might not even want to try.

52:27.222 --> 52:33.771
And then I suppose my question, given the amount of energy you expend on this issue, how you aim to get over that?

52:33.811 --> 52:39.459
Because it does stand in the way of society achieving the sort of shape that someone like you would like it to achieve.

52:39.479 --> 52:42.963
Yes, and my colleague Dan Dennett coined the phrase belief in belief.

52:43.944 --> 52:48.787
Lots and lots of people are not religious themselves, but they've got a vague idea it's a good thing that other people are.

52:49.007 --> 52:50.968
It's very patronizing and condescending, by the way.

52:50.988 --> 52:55.770
It's sort of the attitude, well, you and I, of course, are too intelligent to be religious, but the common people need it.

52:56.390 --> 52:58.151
And there are a lot of people who actually think that.

52:58.191 --> 53:00.532
A lot of people think that we need religion in order to be moral.

53:01.093 --> 53:05.795
There are a lot of people who think that... What if I just said you need humility in order to be moral?

53:07.560 --> 53:15.369
Humility in the face of future generations, humility in the face of our children, and humility in the face of our grandchildren.

53:16.350 --> 53:21.436
And what we owe them in terms of the world that they will inherit, what we should be trying to build for them.

53:22.297 --> 53:22.878
What about that?

53:26.488 --> 53:32.931
If you took religion away, people would start, you know, rushing around, smashing shop windows and robbing and raping and things like that.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.532
No evidence for that whatever.

53:34.552 --> 53:35.973
I mean, absolutely none.

53:36.273 --> 53:41.795
So I think one important thing we've got to do is to prise apart religion from morality.

53:41.836 --> 53:46.718
It's absolute nonsense to say that you need religion in order to be moral.

53:46.958 --> 53:50.100
And so I think that would be one major step we could take.

53:50.500 --> 53:54.802
You don't need to send your child to a faith school in order to instill in that child

53:55.302 --> 53:57.403
a sense of morality, a sense of good citizenship.

53:58.063 --> 54:02.985
A sense of morality and a sense of good citizenship is still not choosing the right words.

54:05.325 --> 54:07.686
It's really about humility, in my humble opinion.

54:07.746 --> 54:19.450
It's really about humility in the face of the unknown and the irreducibly complex, and the short period of time that we are on Earth to try and interact with it.

54:21.451 --> 54:39.976
It's just now more and more clear to me as a 53 year old man and a father of three kids that we are on the earth for way too little time to have believed the things that we believe and been certain about the things we are certain about.

54:39.996 --> 54:47.158
The only reason why we are so certain about those things are the same reason why religious fanatics are so certain about what they are certain about.

54:49.423 --> 54:51.245
And so at the heart of this is a humility.

54:52.045 --> 54:54.847
Religious fanaticism is not humility.

54:57.910 --> 55:09.379
And I think that until people start speaking with the right terms, talking in the right ways, then they are still going to be perpetuating the direction that this awful cruise ship is going.

55:10.500 --> 55:13.382
And they won't be doing anything meaningful to change it.

55:15.700 --> 55:36.810
For whatever reason, even in a secular country like this, we have arrived at a point where there's a sort of latent belief within the popular consciousness that to be scientific is to somehow be sort of desiccated and dry and to miss out on the magic and mystery of one's experiences and the world and so on.

55:36.870 --> 55:38.091
You dispute that, right?

55:38.311 --> 55:39.211
Not only dispute it.

55:39.231 --> 55:41.312
I mean, it's just the exact opposite of the truth.

55:41.893 --> 55:42.893
Science is wonderful.

55:42.933 --> 55:43.874
Science is amazing.

55:44.854 --> 55:47.475
The fact that you could understand why you exist.

55:47.535 --> 55:49.296
Who could not be turned on?

55:49.336 --> 55:50.797
Who could not be excited by that?

55:51.117 --> 55:54.878
Who would ever want to live in the world?

55:57.379 --> 55:58.540
I don't know why that happened.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.281
I have to get out of there and play this again.

56:01.301 --> 56:05.263
I think it's probably because I paused it or maybe I had this timed wrong.

56:05.303 --> 56:07.223
Let me just set the animations different here.

56:10.024 --> 56:13.546
Put it on click and then I will restart this and play the end of it.

56:17.751 --> 56:25.934
It's a very, very big business, religion in America, whereas in Britain, to say that you need religion in order to be moral.

56:26.154 --> 56:28.595
And so I think that's not only disputed.

56:28.655 --> 56:30.716
I mean, it's just the exact opposite of the truth.

56:31.296 --> 56:32.276
Science is wonderful.

56:32.336 --> 56:33.277
Science is amazing.

56:34.257 --> 56:50.364
The fact that you could understand why you exist, who could not be turned on, who could not be excited by that, who would ever want to live in a world where you live your life, you go to work, you go to the office, whatever it is, you go to the football match, and this goes on year after year, and then you die.

56:51.004 --> 56:54.706
and you don't have any understanding of why you were there in the first place.

56:55.087 --> 56:56.888
That's desiccated, that's dry.

56:57.228 --> 57:14.840
What is not dry and desiccated is coming into the world as it were awakening in the world and awakening in the fullest sense of seeing the universe, seeing the stars, seeing down a microscope, seeing what's inside every single cell, seeing what's inside the brain and marveling

57:15.720 --> 57:27.068
at this wonderful gift of life that we have, albeit temporally, marveling at this gift of understanding why we exist and rejoicing in it for as long as we do exist.

57:27.228 --> 57:31.111
See, that's the funny thing is, why do we exist then?

57:31.171 --> 57:38.856
Because chemistry and physics and the rock was a certain distance from the sun and stayed there for a billion years, pretty steady.

57:40.779 --> 57:52.864
I mean, that's right, there's enough water, there were some other minerals, and then sunshine and rain and sunshine and rain for a billion years, round and round, and now we're here?

57:52.884 --> 57:57.867
And that gave us purpose, that gives us understanding?

57:57.887 --> 58:02.889
Do you see?

58:02.909 --> 58:06.390
Do you see how remarkably vapid it is?

58:06.430 --> 58:07.431
He's full of shit.

58:08.936 --> 58:12.880
He's representing it as though all the answers are right there and it's not.

58:12.920 --> 58:18.625
All the assumptions are right there because his assumption is evolution is real because they found DNA.

58:21.360 --> 58:26.003
That means that chemistry and physics can explain everything, and that's why we're here.

58:26.043 --> 58:40.373
We're just really lucky that this particular rock had as much water on it as it had, and was just the right distance from the star that it orbits that we're able to have a shitload of liquid water that's pretty warm.

58:41.994 --> 58:44.095
And organic molecules like warm water.

58:44.976 --> 58:46.497
So, you know, lucky us, right?

58:50.083 --> 58:59.447
Basically anywhere else water is liquid at a certain distance from the Sun Potentially with enough energy being fed into the system.

58:59.988 --> 59:02.529
I guess we could have dinosaurs somewhere else then right?

59:05.650 --> 59:17.716
No ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry, but the the rabbit hole is very very deep There's a reason why dinosaurs are kids toys Richard Dawkins, thank you very much

59:20.054 --> 59:20.976
What time is it?

59:21.056 --> 59:21.778
Game time!

59:26.874 --> 59:28.454
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

59:28.494 --> 59:33.856
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

59:35.096 --> 59:43.618
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where intramuscular injection is dumb, RNA cannot pandemic, transfection is a crime, and autism is a myth.

59:44.418 --> 59:49.539
GigaOM Biological is part of a larger movement on the Internet known as the Independent Bright Web.

59:51.059 --> 59:52.760
Seek them out where you can find them.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.100
Get off of social media because we're not there.

59:55.120 --> 59:59.221
And if we are there, I'm there in a very sarcastic way.

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.862
So don't expect me to be a gentleman on social media.

01:00:04.022 --> 01:00:06.043
This is about finding a way out.

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.604
And the way out is getting off of social media.

01:00:09.384 --> 01:00:14.405
We do have three websites, gigaohmbiological.com, stream.gigaohm.bio, where the stream is found.

01:00:14.905 --> 01:00:35.372
And gigaom.bio, a soapbox, a lot like Truth Social or Blue Sky, but it's our own little thing and you can go there and follow other people just like you can on any other Mastodon-based server as well, so don't be shy, because if you don't know why the cheese is free on social media, you're probably trapped.

01:00:36.492 --> 01:00:40.894
And this is the place where you can find the biology that everybody ignores.

01:00:45.794 --> 01:00:46.855
It's just one big cast.

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:49.677
Once you see it that way, it's actually not that scary anymore.

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:54.481
What you need to realize, though, is that not everybody needs to understand the script.

01:00:55.529 --> 01:01:07.398
even understand that the script is there, but they just need to have enough people in place that trust and will stick to the script that everybody else on stage will follow it, because that's what actors do.

01:01:08.019 --> 01:01:13.483
That's what, you know, people that are working together on a news program in a discussion will also do.

01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:19.628
I'm very serious when I say that I want to make America real again because I think that's our only way out.

01:01:19.688 --> 01:01:20.869
Making America real again

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:25.835
is telling the truth about autism spectrum disorder and arguing about it effectively.

01:01:26.336 --> 01:01:32.624
And that means that we call it what it is, a myth, and we use words to describe what that myth allows.

01:01:32.724 --> 01:01:37.229
It actually prevents people from questioning intramuscular injection in particular.

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:41.473
It prevents people from questioning RNA virology in particular.

01:01:41.853 --> 01:01:45.716
And it prevents people from questioning public health in general.

01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:46.997
And that's really a problem.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:52.241
And they have amplified this with pandemics and gain of function.

01:01:53.202 --> 01:02:00.787
These myths also serve the same purpose to prevent people from arguing about the right things, asking the right questions.

01:02:00.947 --> 01:02:02.809
And so here we are.

01:02:03.769 --> 01:02:05.431
Give me some music, for goodness sakes.

01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:12.810
Here we are, and yes, the truth will set you free, but you gotta find it, you gotta learn it.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:13.650
It takes work.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:20.153
Anything worth having, anything worth learning takes work, okay?

01:02:20.753 --> 01:02:27.155
You're not gonna get a good jump shot by showing up at the gym a few days a week, and then once it looks okay, you stop.

01:02:27.796 --> 01:02:35.819
You're not gonna get a handle on this multi-decade military operation unless you do the work.

01:02:36.758 --> 01:02:39.999
And that means regularly working to show your children the truth.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:47.403
If they watch TV or social media, you better not be letting them do it alone, because the cheese is free there for a reason.

01:02:47.543 --> 01:02:49.124
It is a military weapon.

01:02:49.884 --> 01:02:52.305
That's the truth you need to show your kids.

01:02:53.005 --> 01:02:58.188
It's not a very good truth, but once you tell it to them a few times, they will accept it.

01:02:59.141 --> 01:03:02.622
they will accept it because it is the truth, and they will start to see it.

01:03:03.382 --> 01:03:21.848
Especially if you point it out while they're watching their favorite TikTok video, or their favorite TikTok influencer, and show them how to stay focused on the biology, not take the bait on social media to love your neighbor, then maybe social media for them can be useful if they're only talking to their friends.

01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.469
But then in that case, they need a soapbox.

01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:27.011
In that case, they need a peer tube to share videos on.

01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:32.695
In that case, they need a forum that you host and they host on their own server.

01:03:33.655 --> 01:03:34.816
Totally easy.

01:03:36.817 --> 01:03:37.998
As long as you stay focused.

01:03:39.279 --> 01:03:47.825
But RFK is a scripted actor and behind him are a number of other scripted actors and I know because I've interacted with all of them, they've all tried to play me.

01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:53.740
over the last six years, and I got so far as to getting into... Don't take Tylenol.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.141
Don't take it.

01:03:55.161 --> 01:04:02.547
I got so far as to get into RFK's book as an expert, and now I consider the book slander in a way.

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:05.009
I'm ashamed that I'm in that book.

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:09.714
I was fooled because I thought he was a real guy, and I thought I was helping a real guy.

01:04:10.374 --> 01:04:11.435
It turns out I wasn't.

01:04:11.635 --> 01:04:15.278
I was helping a scripted actor, and that's why he doesn't talk to me anymore.

01:04:16.072 --> 01:04:23.395
That's why they have this very inconvenient problem of me being listed in that book but not talking about them nicely anymore.

01:04:23.955 --> 01:04:26.676
That's because they are engaged in fifth generation warfare.

01:04:27.116 --> 01:04:32.818
That's why there actually is a Children's Health Defense Fund that can be confused with Children's Health Defense.

01:04:33.379 --> 01:04:36.520
That's why there is an American Academy of Pediatrics.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.921
That's why there is an American College of Physicians.

01:04:38.981 --> 01:04:41.682
That's why there is a heart and a brownstone

01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:45.964
and a Federation of American Scientists and American Humanist Association.

01:04:46.385 --> 01:04:52.108
All of these are part of the 5th Generation Warfare that's being deployed on us.

01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:53.028
You want to get off of it?

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.489
Download PeerTube.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.291
There you can find my videos and Mark's.

01:04:57.971 --> 01:04:59.132
You won't have to log in.

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:00.693
It won't take any data.

01:05:00.873 --> 01:05:02.254
It will play flawlessly.

01:05:03.494 --> 01:05:07.157
And you will not be served up Russell Brand in your next video.

01:05:07.177 --> 01:05:11.179
You will not be interrupted by an Ivermectin advertisement.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:16.677
You will just get the content that we are making and providing.

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:18.758
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:20.019
This is GeekOwned Biological.

01:05:20.119 --> 01:05:21.500
Biology is the way.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.641
I have quite a long introduction here.

01:05:23.701 --> 01:05:25.101
Maybe I should just skip it.

01:05:25.341 --> 01:05:28.543
Or, I think we're going to cut one of these videos out anyway.

01:05:30.484 --> 01:05:35.832
It's been a long, long time since we have been working on this.

01:05:36.412 --> 01:05:37.674
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:37.694 --> 01:05:41.680
This is GeekOwn Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by Biologist.

01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.363
We are here seeking the truth together.

01:05:46.415 --> 01:05:51.259
truth together about the pandemic means the truth of the Human Genome Project.

01:05:51.399 --> 01:05:55.702
It means the truth about a lot of things that are all tied up in this illusion.

01:05:56.363 --> 01:06:07.792
I know that this illusion spans for much more than the last six years, but the last six years is still fully available on the internet and you can explore the track record of anybody that you think is a hero.

01:06:08.592 --> 01:06:11.795
And chances are pretty good if you're on the red team,

01:06:12.515 --> 01:06:15.877
The heroes that you have been following are scripted frauds.

01:06:16.158 --> 01:06:17.058
And that's a problem.

01:06:18.079 --> 01:06:26.044
Because you might have seen through Alex Jones or Laura Loomer, or you might have even seen through, I don't know, Latipo in Florida.

01:06:26.264 --> 01:06:30.527
Or even Robert Malone never really tickled your fancy as somebody that you believed.

01:06:30.567 --> 01:06:35.110
It doesn't mean that you didn't believe in a lot of other people, and it doesn't mean that you didn't ultimately vote for Trump.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:48.220
And that's the problem because the illusion is that this is a evenly divided country where half the country is fighting for Trump and believes that there's an elite pedophile network, but it doesn't include Trump.

01:06:49.061 --> 01:06:52.003
They believe that COVID was real because lots of people died from it.

01:06:52.043 --> 01:06:58.928
And they believe that the vaccines work, but have also injured some people because maybe there's a DNA contamination.

01:06:59.229 --> 01:07:02.311
And so both sides are kind of right, but not really.

01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:04.493
And that's why the red team is so fired up.

01:07:05.073 --> 01:07:06.455
supporting Trump and RFK.

01:07:06.475 --> 01:07:15.067
And the blue team, of course, thinks that this is just Mother Nature, and it could be a lab virus that was originally from Mother Nature, but that doesn't matter.

01:07:15.468 --> 01:07:21.195
They were doing the necessary work to protect us from this imminent threat that was always there, and includes bioweapons.

01:07:21.874 --> 01:07:25.077
But Trump is the culmination of everything wrong in the world.

01:07:25.537 --> 01:07:34.545
And somehow or another, despite our best efforts, this criminal liar and rapist got elected twice in two non-consecutive terms.

01:07:35.005 --> 01:07:38.608
And despite our best efforts, he's now in charge and driving the bus.

01:07:39.068 --> 01:07:46.094
So Trump is also an elite pedophile and part of this network that's kind of controlled, but not really because they're mostly on the red team, I guess.

01:07:46.555 --> 01:07:49.377
And COVID was real and the vaccine, of course, vaccines work.

01:07:50.885 --> 01:07:52.487
This is a trap, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:53.908
These two teams are a trap.

01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:56.751
These two teams believe in the same biology.

01:07:56.791 --> 01:08:05.240
They believe that because we found DNA a long time ago, that evolution is real and therefore it's only a matter of time and pressure.

01:08:07.745 --> 01:08:13.830
that we discover the laws of physics and chemistry that ultimately govern our lives and are responsible for our existence.

01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:18.334
You know, the sun and the earth and that little thing down there that's spinning.

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:25.640
It's just like, you know, a planet goes around a planet or goes around a star long enough at a consistent distance.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.843
And, you know, billions of years later, there's technology in Swiss watches.

01:08:29.883 --> 01:08:30.704
That's the idea.

01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:41.415
And I don't think it's that much different than, you know, sitting at a tropical beach and waiting for a Lego train to show up.

01:08:42.475 --> 01:08:44.456
It's just as absurd.

01:08:45.096 --> 01:08:58.619
Even when there are Lego trains on the planet already, expecting them to show up, eventually sort themselves out on a beach just because, you know, that's the way the world works, it would be ridiculous.

01:09:00.043 --> 01:09:11.770
But I think it's a lot more likely than the current laws of physics and chemistry, and I guess consistent sunlight on a rock, a wet rock, is enough to explain our existence.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:15.052
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.

01:09:16.333 --> 01:09:18.734
And I say that as a lifelong biologist.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:28.380
I just think we have overextended this and used this as an excuse to manage population pyramids, to govern with murder, to govern with lies,

01:09:30.182 --> 01:09:58.412
to govern with unbridled immigration, to govern with social media, to govern with confusion, to govern with fear, ultimately to take over the evolution of the species, or at least try, because it's a moral goal, depending on your morals, depending on your time horizon, depending on what your ultimate goal is, and whether or not you think that all people should, it's all there.

01:10:00.219 --> 01:10:02.700
It's the Human Genome Project, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.701
It is the ultimate goal of taking over the evolution of the species.

01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:11.543
And some people just aren't smart enough to participate in that movement.

01:10:13.283 --> 01:10:15.704
Some people just need to be told what to see.

01:10:16.824 --> 01:10:19.625
And other people won't even be able to see it when they're told.

01:10:22.046 --> 01:10:25.127
So these people who have absolute conviction

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:30.123
that evolution is real because we discovered DNA.

01:10:31.165 --> 01:10:33.730
These people are responsible for where we are now.

01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:37.559
These people are working together to make this

01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:56.260
this humanity move in the direction of transhumanism and of godlessness and of lack of anything sacred and certainly inverting our time frame so that our time horizon so that we never make plans with our kids about what kind of world we want to build for our grandkids.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.161
We don't want to plan that way.

01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:03.382
They plan that way, but we because of social media are planning exactly the opposite.

01:11:03.422 --> 01:11:06.023
It's just thinking about the Amazon delivery

01:11:07.423 --> 01:11:08.584
time window, and that's it.

01:11:09.645 --> 01:11:10.586
Are you prime or not?

01:11:10.686 --> 01:11:12.087
You know, five days or one day.

01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:21.935
And so it's been murder and lies for a while now, but not depopulation.

01:11:21.975 --> 01:11:23.736
That's already built into the system.

01:11:23.776 --> 01:11:25.497
It's just kind of cleaning up the pyramid.

01:11:25.998 --> 01:11:29.220
It's about the grandchildren of Earth, yes, but it's about enslaving them.

01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:33.924
It's about them willingly submitting to slavery.

01:11:35.885 --> 01:11:55.434
That's why Israel and Gaza is so ridiculous and that's why all the people that we are told we're supposed to respect are gay or are trans or are just dumb like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and Peter Thiel are just kind of dumb on camera, you know?

01:11:57.281 --> 01:12:06.047
And then they have like Alex Karp posing with the Prime Minister of the UK about digital ID and stuff like that.

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:14.713
It's just, it's all a big theater and it's gonna go in the direction that they want it to go until we all stop watching the theater.

01:12:15.213 --> 01:12:21.157
If you're on social media telling everybody to stay off of and not get a digital ID, you're not helping.

01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:27.525
You can tweet all day long about, I will not comply and do not get a digital ID.

01:12:27.565 --> 01:12:31.428
That message is just saying the digital ID is coming.

01:12:31.468 --> 01:12:32.949
It's just an announcement inverted.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:42.255
And since they plan to bring out digital ID and use it to enforce the internet, then the only way to make digital ID irrelevant is to get off the internet.

01:12:44.414 --> 01:12:51.036
There will always be other ways, paper and whatever, to apply and to file and whatever.

01:12:51.096 --> 01:12:52.536
That's always going to be the case.

01:12:52.756 --> 01:12:55.577
God, it's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's always going to be the case.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:13:04.620
But it is the use of social media that will ultimately allow them to attempt to coerce the population into accepting it.

01:13:05.475 --> 01:13:12.798
If they have to, they'll tell us a bunch of stories about kids that committed suicide because of the anonymous harassment on the internet.

01:13:12.838 --> 01:13:19.920
And so we've got to at least have everybody have an ID to be on the internet and on social media to make social media safe and everybody accountable.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:44.413
It's one of the narratives that will work, whatever narrative works, but the only one that breaks that, the only one that breaks it completely is if we just get off the internet, not the internet necessarily, but get off social media and make our own platforms using very simple open source platform, you know, code bases like Soapbox, like PeerTube, and then just start building.

01:13:44.793 --> 01:13:45.213
That's it.

01:13:46.394 --> 01:13:50.116
Server by server, instance by instance, mirror by mirror.

01:13:52.697 --> 01:14:05.440
Instead of putting our time into the profile page on X and the profile page on Instagram and the profile page on Facebook and trying to update those regularly, just build your own fricking website.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:16.561
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s and I've got all kinds of books that show it.

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:19.782
Transfection of healthy humans is a crime.

01:14:19.902 --> 01:14:24.644
It's actually an old technology that any academic biologist worth their weight in is

01:14:26.344 --> 01:14:38.947
should have definitely done known better and said and spoke out at the beginning of the pandemic and a failure to do so is essentially a failure to have principles or to be the biologist they claim to be at the start of the pandemic.

01:14:39.127 --> 01:14:50.029
RNA cannot pandemic is also something that at least one other academic biologist should have gotten to by now and the only reason why they haven't is because social media is very effective at

01:14:50.769 --> 01:14:56.592
at doing what it does and the vast majority of people do not see on their own.

01:14:58.013 --> 01:15:02.116
The vast majority of people only see what they are shown.

01:15:04.557 --> 01:15:11.161
And so what has been accomplished over the last years is the identification of people who can see on their own.

01:15:12.472 --> 01:15:19.179
Like Mark, like myself, like maybe Joe Marshall, like maybe Dan Cohen, I don't know.

01:15:19.259 --> 01:15:25.825
But it's identified all the people who are easily moved versus more difficult to move.

01:15:26.386 --> 01:15:29.148
Easily coerced or harder to coerce.

01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:33.873
Easier to bamboozle, harder to bamboozle.

01:15:35.905 --> 01:15:40.930
And I would suggest to you that I'm one of the few people that's made it all the way to Camp 5 and is about to summit.

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:48.438
Because every time three or four of these people started texting my wife and coming to my house, I saw through their lies.

01:15:49.158 --> 01:15:55.124
And I got all the way to Robert Malone and Jay Bhattacharya and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:56.547 --> 01:15:58.709
I mean, the list is long.

01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:09.379
Many of them are multi-millionaires, and they all were recruited to help distract me and my family from the truth, which is right here on this screen.

01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:18.047
And now I can bring it to you over the next few weeks in a lovely biological course

01:16:19.497 --> 01:16:48.332
that will essentially bring anyone that wants to to an understanding of how this happened, what the shortcomings are of this central dogma, and why any high school teacher that wanted to could teach this irreducible complexity and the central dogma at the same time while honestly depicting the limits of the central dogma and the failure of the Manhattan Project's physicists to crack the code

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:56.987
and how the code still hasn't really been cracked, and what the impetus would be for lying about cracking the code.

01:16:59.662 --> 01:17:21.261
What is necessary to crack the code, given what we know about cracking chess or cracking Go, the game, for example, could also be part of this curriculum that high school teachers could teach their kids to understand this irreducible complexity and how we might attempt to make progress in understanding more of it, not solving it.

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:29.694
But pushing back the veil a little bit more for the benefit of all mankind is still, obviously, a very noble pursuit.

01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:43.243
But it is the religious-like fervor that we will soon know it all that is currently, in my mind, the most dangerous force on Earth.

01:17:44.704 --> 01:17:50.267
And that is really what Dawkins represented to me in that video, is an uncertainty

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:54.711
A certainty that belongs on the set of Star Trek, not on Earth.

01:17:55.292 --> 01:18:00.679
A certainty that belongs on a sitcom, but not on Earth as a professor.

01:18:02.602 --> 01:18:04.204
We should be able to see that.

01:18:04.325 --> 01:18:07.249
We should be able to see past it, but they're not real people.

01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:38.099
That's why he also, in his wise biology, didn't tell you that they saw this coming in the population pyramid already back in the 90s, and that a little bit of murder and lies here, a little bit of manslaughter and lies, a little bit of, you know, mistreated pneumonia is all that would really be needed in order to manage that population pyramid blip enough to be able to cry to the other countries on earth using social media to show that something terrible was happening in America, and therefore, it's real.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:46.148
I think it's really vital that we take stock in what happens with regard to timeframes.

01:18:46.849 --> 01:18:47.950
And so we are really here.

01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:52.916
2013 is where Joe Rogan was on the Sci-Fi Channel telling us all about pandemics.

01:18:52.956 --> 01:18:56.119
This is also the year when Brian Hooker still wouldn't use the word autism.

01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:57.360
He didn't like the word autism.

01:18:58.081 --> 01:18:59.681
His son was vaccine damaged.

01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:04.102
He was neurologically damaged by multiple injections during inflammation.

01:19:04.582 --> 01:19:08.923
And so then we transitioned to around 2015 and Brian Hooker's song changes.

01:19:09.003 --> 01:19:11.764
Now his son has autism and it was caused by vaccines.

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:17.965
And then we have him in this movie partly produced by Pauly Tommy.

01:19:18.005 --> 01:19:19.546
It said, so they're movie makers.

01:19:19.606 --> 01:19:21.146
They make money from movies.

01:19:23.527 --> 01:19:24.447
She was an actor.

01:19:25.819 --> 01:19:38.390
She was on 90 billboards bringing awareness to autism and swinging 6 million votes in the UK before she came to America to do the same thing on a longer timescale using Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.472
as a potential presidential candidate back then.

01:19:42.697 --> 01:19:44.037
ICANN gets involved.

01:19:44.298 --> 01:19:53.660
ICANN again posing with photographs and on the cover of magazines with Dell and with Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:01.302
So Polly Tommy being a part of Children's Health Defense now is a further admission that this is all one malevolent show.

01:20:01.362 --> 01:20:10.145
Maybe Children's Health Defense and ICANN and everything, this is all just a buildup with a long-term vision about what was to come.

01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:19.317
a crisis moment when the anti-vax, anti-public health, skeptical movement would need to be militarily controlled.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:33.930
And that's why these people were put in place, these organizations were created or renamed, and the people that are there are there, and took the stances that they took in 2020, including Brian Hooker.

01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:49.036
who explained to everybody what antibodies were, and explained to everybody what viruses are, and told everybody that he's got 16 years of biological experience working for labs and, you know, being an anti-vax, and so you can trust me.

01:20:52.658 --> 01:20:54.958
I just want to build a big top tent of health freedom.

01:20:56.259 --> 01:20:57.540
I don't want mandates.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.362
Oh yeah, and in 2020, Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark died.

01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:08.770
So this timeline is pretty extraordinary.

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:10.011
You can tell if someone's lying.

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:14.193
I know that these people are lying because I tried my best to work with them.

01:21:14.273 --> 01:21:15.814
I tried my best to help them.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:18.836
I tried my best to teach them what I knew or found out.

01:21:19.356 --> 01:21:22.218
And all of these people, he's now NIH director.

01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:29.226
and he had an infectious clone lecture from me a couple times over taco and beer.

01:21:29.687 --> 01:21:38.457
These people are friends from decades ago on the man show where they used to watch women jump around on trampolines.

01:21:40.302 --> 01:22:03.511
These people go back decades and they were all recruited, all part of this to hide the murder and lies and to transition from a governance by lies and myths, newspapers and magazines and on TV talk shows to transitioning to podcasts, which would be again, deployed across the internet to isolate people.

01:22:05.919 --> 01:22:25.772
to categorize people, to fractionate a movement that would ultimately come together under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Mary Holland, and Brian Hooker, and Suzanne Humphreys.

01:22:26.812 --> 01:22:32.596
Like, it's absurd that those are the people that are on Joe Rogan, along with Donald Trump,

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:34.410
and J.D.

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:42.293
Vance, and Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk, and Ian Carroll.

01:22:43.553 --> 01:22:52.755
It can only be explained by a military operation because Joe Rogan, as entertaining as his idiocy is, is not worth $250 million to Spotify.

01:22:52.775 --> 01:22:53.856
There's no fricking way.

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:06.545
Don't forget, it was $200 million, like right before the pandemic.

01:23:06.585 --> 01:23:10.668
And then in 2024, he renewed it for 250 million more.

01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:12.670
It's impossible.

01:23:13.431 --> 01:23:14.892
They don't have to pay him that.

01:23:15.293 --> 01:23:17.915
Where is he gonna go if he doesn't go to Spotify?

01:23:17.975 --> 01:23:18.596
YouTube?

01:23:19.096 --> 01:23:21.158
Is he gonna go to Rumble and get more money?

01:23:21.658 --> 01:23:23.320
That's just stupid.

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:27.271
Until you see it's fake.

01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:29.572
Until you see it's just part of the show.

01:23:30.293 --> 01:23:38.658
Where a kind of level of success is thrown in your face that's absolutely positively impossible for anyone else.

01:23:39.258 --> 01:23:43.841
Creating, interviewing, you know, editing on the internet could never get there.

01:23:43.901 --> 01:23:46.023
Not in a billion years.

01:23:46.743 --> 01:23:48.524
But Joe Rogan got there between 2013 and 2019.

01:23:48.564 --> 01:23:49.705
I guess because he's just such a badass.

01:24:00.051 --> 01:24:01.752
We've fallen for it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:01.832 --> 01:24:07.695
That's why PBS NewsHour promotes substacks and podcasts and everybody is in.

01:24:08.116 --> 01:24:10.497
Everybody is in because it's the same theater.

01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:13.939
So let's look at the timeline, go back in time.

01:24:25.745 --> 01:24:32.471
I'll warn you right now I'm gonna have to cut it short and we'll pick it up again tomorrow or tonight and finish this one way or another.

01:24:32.491 --> 01:24:37.556
What a cute little baby.

01:24:46.141 --> 01:24:56.485
This is 2015, and we are showing a C-section mom, as far as I can tell, because Fearla has delivered three babies in my presence, and at least once she had an epidural.

01:24:57.145 --> 01:25:07.429
And although the epidural does help, I think there's no question that this lady is feeling nothing, because you don't have that face with an epidural, I assure you.

01:25:07.609 --> 01:25:08.409
At least Fearla didn't.

01:25:15.658 --> 01:25:16.820
A new life begins.

01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:29.155
Out of her mother's womb, Rachel Murphy is now surrounded by a new world filled with countless germs.

01:25:30.877 --> 01:25:33.420
Modern medicine will do what it can to protect her.

01:25:35.953 --> 01:25:40.954
First and foremost, I would hope her breastfeeding mom will do all that she can to protect her.

01:25:40.994 --> 01:25:41.474
It's weird.

01:25:41.534 --> 01:25:52.497
And her mom's immune system, you know, that's the already starting terrible with a C-section and the scary world that wants to kill the baby.

01:25:54.037 --> 01:25:55.318
Just a tiny little stick.

01:25:55.658 --> 01:26:00.319
Barely an hour old, Rachel gets her first shot against hepatitis B.

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:07.510
Those mother suckers in Pittsburgh put that in two shots and Freddie, like, as they caught her.

01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:09.511
It was frickin' gross.

01:26:11.632 --> 01:26:18.815
This is the first of up to 35 inoculations she will get in the next six years of her life to fight 14 diseases.

01:26:24.337 --> 01:26:28.558
Public health doctors celebrate vaccines as one of medicine's shining achievements.

01:26:31.001 --> 01:26:33.143
They've increased our lifespan by 30 years.

01:26:33.363 --> 01:26:35.705
Hib would cause 20,000 to 25,000 cases a year.

01:26:35.945 --> 01:26:36.246
Gone.

01:26:36.486 --> 01:26:39.368
Hib was one of the worst vaccines ever.

01:26:39.448 --> 01:26:50.018
The Hib titer vaccine, which was pulled from the market, was essentially a small Hib haemophilus B antigen

01:26:51.294 --> 01:26:53.976
conjugated to the diphtheria toxin.

01:26:54.176 --> 01:26:55.277
I shit you not.

01:26:55.938 --> 01:26:56.738
You can look that up.

01:26:57.018 --> 01:27:00.861
I mean, polio would paralyze, you know, tens of thousands of children every year.

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:01.502
Gone.

01:27:01.522 --> 01:27:05.985
I mean, diphtheria was the most common killer of teenagers in the 1920s.

01:27:06.246 --> 01:27:06.666
Gone.

01:27:06.946 --> 01:27:10.089
I mean, you know, the vaccines, the benefit of vaccines is clear.

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.803
Well, there's now 16 diseases that are preventable by vaccination for children.

01:27:16.924 --> 01:27:22.408
14 of those are diseases that we vaccinate infants and young children for, and two of them are diseases that we vaccinate adolescents.

01:27:23.048 --> 01:27:27.771
From my point of view, being able to prevent 16 diseases by vaccination is a really good thing.

01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:31.854
But not everyone agrees.

01:27:32.674 --> 01:27:39.299
Across America, the CDC has discovered certain communities where parents are hesitating to vaccinate their children.

01:27:40.857 --> 01:27:42.718
One is Ashland, Oregon.

01:27:48.802 --> 01:27:49.922
This is our neighborhood.

01:27:50.643 --> 01:27:52.544
We love it because we can walk everywhere.

01:27:53.484 --> 01:27:57.406
Ashland is a very safe town compared to almost every place else in America.

01:27:57.927 --> 01:28:01.549
It's a college town, the home of an... That's just so dark.

01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:03.070
It's 2015.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:07.112
Like, everywhere else in America isn't safe except for my town?

01:28:07.172 --> 01:28:08.373
Like, that is so dumb.

01:28:08.493 --> 01:28:08.713
Wow.

01:28:09.544 --> 01:28:19.712
Shakespeare Festival, where a well-off, educated population has easy access to alternative medicines, an organic food co-op, and yoga centers.

01:28:22.134 --> 01:28:23.355
Go get him!

01:28:25.837 --> 01:28:26.717
Jennifer Margulis.

01:28:27.118 --> 01:28:32.542
A food co-op and yoga centers, along with acoustic guitar in the background all the time.

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:37.561
Writer with a PhD in English literature, is the mother of four children.

01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:45.223
When my daughter was born in 1999, the nurse bustled in with her tray and said, okay, it's time for your hepatitis B vaccine.

01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:51.544
And I looked at my daughter and I looked at the nurse and I said, isn't hepatitis B a sexually transmitted disease?

01:28:52.144 --> 01:28:57.386
And I said, why am I supposed to vaccinate my newborn baby against a sexually transmitted disease?

01:28:57.626 --> 01:28:59.126
And the nurse got really mad.

01:29:00.086 --> 01:29:10.916
Margulis went on to research and write about vaccines, and in 2009 published a long article about the vaccine debate in Mothering Magazine, a magazine promoting a natural lifestyle.

01:29:11.216 --> 01:29:13.919
Why are we giving children so many vaccines?

01:29:14.279 --> 01:29:19.284
They get four times the number of vaccines than I got when I was a child growing up in the 70s.

01:29:19.864 --> 01:29:22.847
As a parent, I would rather see my child

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:33.652
get a natural illness and contract that the way that illnesses have been contracted for at least 200,000 years that Homo sapiens have been around, I'm not afraid of my children getting chickenpox.

01:29:33.732 --> 01:29:35.894
There are reasons that children get sick.

01:29:36.354 --> 01:29:38.296
Getting sick is not a bad thing.

01:29:39.977 --> 01:29:45.821
In common with many other Ashland parents, Margulis decided not to fully vaccinate her other children.

01:29:48.954 --> 01:29:51.656
Ashland has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.

01:29:52.577 --> 01:29:57.820
An estimated 28% of its children lack some or all of their recommended vaccines.

01:29:58.161 --> 01:30:00.863
So shouldn't there be like a serious death rate here?

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:06.507
Shouldn't there be a serious... Because remember, this is a crucial point, okay?

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.788
This is crucial.

01:30:08.553 --> 01:30:15.134
Remember that we are now told in 2025 that vaccines never stopped spread.

01:30:15.174 --> 01:30:35.178
We were told in 2019 by James Lyons Weiler that all vaccines don't stop spread, that actually in vaccinated populations, the same virus that you're vaccinated against is transmitting asymptomatically between these people who are vaccinated because they just don't get sick.

01:30:38.919 --> 01:30:43.442
Like that's what we're told how vaccines actually work now in 2025.

01:30:43.742 --> 01:30:44.643
They don't prevent.

01:30:45.243 --> 01:30:46.744
They don't make things go away.

01:30:47.225 --> 01:30:52.008
The smallpox vaccine made things go away, but the polio vaccine can't.

01:30:52.328 --> 01:30:53.809
The measles vaccine can't.

01:30:55.050 --> 01:31:01.114
None of these vaccines can make things go away anymore because you're actually an asymptomatic carrier when you're vaccinated.

01:31:01.154 --> 01:31:02.195
That's not unusual.

01:31:03.697 --> 01:31:06.598
You see, this is 2015.

01:31:06.699 --> 01:31:09.200
We will not hear that in this video at all.

01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:17.224
So we're going to need today the DTAP number five, your final polio.

01:31:17.724 --> 01:31:23.287
Pediatrician Dr. Donna Bradshaw-Walters worries that these parents... The fifth DTAP shot.

01:31:23.407 --> 01:31:24.207
Think about that.

01:31:24.327 --> 01:31:25.208
What kind of...

01:31:26.377 --> 01:31:28.758
antigen needs five exposures.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:30.619
Like that's a remarkable thing.

01:31:30.699 --> 01:31:35.301
Parents may unwittingly bring back diseases that haven't been seen for decades.

01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:42.665
They might bring back those diseases, but how would they do it unless they're always there?

01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:48.008
And if they're always there, then maybe the vaccines are protective somehow.

01:31:48.548 --> 01:31:54.831
You see, we've got to be, we've got to be open to the possibility that something is happening.

01:31:56.459 --> 01:32:01.621
We've got to be open enough to consider all the possibilities, even if we're going to come to the conclusion that it ain't.

01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:04.822
You got to at least have your mind open to it.

01:32:04.862 --> 01:32:06.763
This is February of 2015.

01:32:06.823 --> 01:32:12.686
Just listen to what they say and don't say in 2015.

01:32:13.626 --> 01:32:21.389
Because the trap is still being created and made and honed and constructed at this time.

01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:26.291
The possibility of an outbreak is real.

01:32:27.051 --> 01:32:28.112
here in Ashland.

01:32:28.692 --> 01:32:34.135
We are not living in a bubble, especially in this day and age of international travel.

01:32:35.035 --> 01:32:53.185
Our Shakespeare Festival draws people from all over the world and it's just a matter of time before someone comes to here from another area who is unimmunized and who has the disease and brings that disease into our community.

01:32:55.461 --> 01:33:02.625
There are many pro-vaccine parents in Ashland who agree, like Lori Anderson, whose adopted son Evan is fully vaccinated.

01:33:03.265 --> 01:33:05.186
It's an outbreak waiting to happen.

01:33:06.046 --> 01:33:10.068
And so I don't just care about my own child.

01:33:10.128 --> 01:33:20.113
My child may be well protected because of his vaccination, but I hate to see people get hurt, injured, die, have to be quarantined, isolated.

01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:22.814
Of course, her child is an adopted black kid.

01:33:22.874 --> 01:33:23.995
Like, seriously?

01:33:25.856 --> 01:33:29.339
because of an outbreak that is preventable with a vaccine.

01:33:33.562 --> 01:33:39.827
All they have to do is sign an exemption and their kid is exempt from immunization before they go to school.

01:33:40.487 --> 01:33:42.308
I would try not to be angry.

01:33:42.328 --> 01:33:44.250
I hope it doesn't get contentious.

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.711
It will, though.

01:33:45.731 --> 01:33:48.353
It will get contentious if there's an outbreak.

01:33:48.993 --> 01:33:55.277
if vaccinated children start to get breakthrough disease because of the high rate of unvaccinated children.

01:33:55.377 --> 01:34:02.561
So the vaccinated kids could also get sick because the unvaccinated kids are so selfish, you see?

01:34:03.624 --> 01:34:06.226
It's exactly the same bullshit narrative.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:09.228
The vaccine only protects people if everybody takes it.

01:34:09.768 --> 01:34:13.411
If people don't take it, then essentially it doesn't work anymore.

01:34:13.471 --> 01:34:13.951
Do you see?

01:34:13.971 --> 01:34:15.232
Do you see?

01:34:15.672 --> 01:34:19.655
So what do the changes inside of vaccinated people's bodies mean?

01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:24.098
Other than, I guess, a statistical decrease across the whole population.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.801
It's ridiculous.

01:34:29.141 --> 01:34:30.042
It's ridiculous.

01:34:31.723 --> 01:34:33.384
It probably will get ugly.

01:34:37.717 --> 01:34:42.739
The CDC tracks outbreaks of infectious diseases around the country from its center in Atlanta.

01:34:43.459 --> 01:34:47.580
In 2008, for example, there were numerous small pockets of infection.

01:34:49.121 --> 01:34:53.742
One involving measles erupted in an under-vaccinated area of San Diego.

01:34:55.603 --> 01:34:58.264
Like most measles outbreaks, it came from abroad.

01:35:00.658 --> 01:35:04.240
Maybe Brandy Vaughn brought it with her when she moved back to California.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.120
Holy shit.

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:10.163
Infected seven-year-old returned from a family vacation in Switzerland on January 15th.

01:35:12.604 --> 01:35:14.545
The child gave measles to two siblings.

01:35:15.165 --> 01:35:18.346
So he got measles in Switzerland because Switzerland doesn't vaccinate?

01:35:18.386 --> 01:35:20.747
What the f... So dumb.

01:35:21.488 --> 01:35:26.490
And collectively, they infected classmates at the San Diego Cooperative Charter School in Linda Vista.

01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:31.654
A visit to the Children's Clinic of La Jolla spread the infection to four others.

01:35:32.835 --> 01:35:38.021
One of these, an infant, flew on a plane to Hawaii, where she was intercepted and quarantined.

01:35:39.182 --> 01:35:43.507
Her fellow 250 passengers had to be contacted and tracked.

01:35:44.288 --> 01:35:47.652
Dr. Wilma Wooten is San Diego County's public health officer.

01:35:48.339 --> 01:36:00.764
This entire process resulted in exposures of almost 1,000 individuals, 90 with no proof of immunization, 73 were quarantined, 12... Wooten!

01:36:00.844 --> 01:36:01.585
Yeah, baby!

01:36:01.605 --> 01:36:03.866
I don't feel like I gotta do something about that.

01:36:04.006 --> 01:36:07.707
I mean, seriously, like, Wooten, nice name.

01:36:07.727 --> 01:36:08.908
I love it.

01:36:10.185 --> 01:36:12.988
That is a nice, nice name.

01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:15.570
I didn't get it quick enough.

01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:18.413
I wanted to play a Victor Wooten clip there, but I didn't get it there.

01:36:19.114 --> 01:36:22.717
Victor Wooten is maybe the best bass player to ever walk on planet Earth.

01:36:22.757 --> 01:36:26.501
Additional actual cases of measles in San Diego.

01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:41.558
Public health officials determined that what allowed measles to enter the community was the number of vaccine-hesitant parents who took advantage of the personal belief exemption allowed by California.

01:36:43.283 --> 01:36:46.286
school principals find themselves caught on the front lines.

01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:59.999
The fact is that some families choose not to immunize their children and then there are families who have children who are particularly medically sensitive and they're in jeopardy because they could get sick from unimmunized children.

01:37:00.059 --> 01:37:03.403
So it's a very emotional issue on both sides.

01:37:05.769 --> 01:37:11.132
It is the exact same narrative for more than two decades now.

01:37:11.212 --> 01:37:13.053
That's how you can see that it's bullshit.

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:16.175
Infrastructure is committed to preventing such outbreaks.

01:37:17.036 --> 01:37:25.920
The National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, large vaccine manufacturers.

01:37:26.621 --> 01:37:29.783
The mainstream medical establishment speaks with one voice.

01:37:30.768 --> 01:37:34.772
Vaccines are a public health miracle far too valuable to put at risk.

01:37:35.292 --> 01:37:37.915
A public health miracle.

01:37:38.015 --> 01:37:40.837
I mean, talk about going all in on this shit.

01:37:40.977 --> 01:37:41.838
That's amazing.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.784
Emilio Amini has spent his life making vaccines in America's pharmaceutical companies.

01:37:49.585 --> 01:37:51.487
He heads Pfizer's vaccine operation.

01:37:54.537 --> 01:37:56.278
People haven't seen these diseases in a while.

01:37:56.578 --> 01:38:07.005
So people become complacent, they don't vaccinate, and what they wind up doing is putting their children and themselves in considerable risk of a severe disease and infection.

01:38:07.666 --> 01:38:12.509
Polio, even though people aren't worried about it because they haven't seen much of it, it's still present in many parts of the world.

01:38:12.769 --> 01:38:16.432
And it can easily be introduced into a non-vaccinated population.

01:38:16.512 --> 01:38:22.516
And from what we've seen in other parts of the world, once it's introduced, it will spread very rapidly and cause a lot of disease.

01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:25.171
The fear, my friends, is polio.

01:38:25.612 --> 01:38:29.335
But soon, perhaps within a year, there may be a vaccine.

01:38:29.735 --> 01:38:30.676
Thanks for visiting with us.

01:38:31.416 --> 01:38:32.678
Hey, kids, how about saying goodbye, huh?

01:38:32.998 --> 01:38:35.019
Wow, they used Hollywood all the way back then.

01:38:35.079 --> 01:38:35.800
Isn't that funny?

01:38:36.621 --> 01:38:36.981
Say bye-bye.

01:38:37.001 --> 01:38:37.702
Say bye-bye.

01:38:37.942 --> 01:38:52.714
When I was a child and the big scare was polio, where you would see your friends playing ball outside with you, baseball and basketball, and all of a sudden get sick and be in bed, be in an iron lung, and then come out with a

01:38:53.274 --> 01:39:06.120
deformity, a serious limp or a serious physical disability, that is absolutely frozen in your mind as a very scary scenario.

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.081
I think we're compelled by our own fears.

01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:14.064
And certainly my parents, who grew up in the 1920s and 30s and 40s, saw these infections.

01:39:14.104 --> 01:39:15.184
They saw what they could do.

01:39:15.244 --> 01:39:16.925
For them, vaccines was an easy sell.

01:39:17.688 --> 01:39:26.431
Paul Offit is a pediatrician and co-inventor of a vaccine against rotavirus, a pathogen that causes serious fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

01:39:26.451 --> 01:39:28.672
I grew up in the 1950s and 60s.

01:39:28.732 --> 01:39:29.432
I saw measles.

01:39:29.493 --> 01:39:30.113
I had measles.

01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:30.653
I had mumps.

01:39:30.733 --> 01:39:31.553
I had German measles.

01:39:31.793 --> 01:39:33.194
I mean, I knew what those diseases could do.

01:39:33.254 --> 01:39:35.935
I watched my friends also be sickened by those diseases.

01:39:36.195 --> 01:39:38.096
And so for me, vaccines was an easy sell.

01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:43.878
I think for people now, young mothers today not only don't see these diseases, they didn't even grow up with these diseases.

01:39:43.938 --> 01:39:46.239
So for them, vaccination becomes a matter of faith.

01:39:46.974 --> 01:39:48.876
But the faith of some parents has eroded.

01:39:49.676 --> 01:39:59.565
Offit, for example, is seen in some quarters not as a hero for inventing a successful vaccine, but as a self-interested entrepreneur whom skeptics call Dr. Profit.

01:40:00.025 --> 01:40:01.947
They all have this guy, Paul Offit.

01:40:02.207 --> 01:40:03.088
You guys know him?

01:40:06.331 --> 01:40:09.934
And he is the poster child for the term biostitute.

01:40:10.194 --> 01:40:11.115
Does not disclose

01:40:11.257 --> 01:40:17.151
For such critics, the fact that vaccines have made Offit rich is enough to discount what he is saying.

01:40:18.074 --> 01:40:20.860
But Offit, a prolific author, makes no apologies.

01:40:21.337 --> 01:40:36.147
I'm the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine, a vaccine that I made in collaboration with Merck, and it's a vaccine which has caused a dramatic decrease in this country in hospitalization and has caused already a dramatic decrease in hospitalization and death in some countries in the developing world.

01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:37.288
I'm enormously proud of that.

01:40:37.308 --> 01:40:40.610
I would argue that I have an expertise in rotavirus.

01:40:40.650 --> 01:40:42.452
Do you also financially benefit from that?

01:40:44.814 --> 01:40:47.356
I know this isn't going to sell, but it doesn't matter.

01:40:47.577 --> 01:40:50.059
It doesn't matter whether I financially benefited or not.

01:40:50.099 --> 01:40:56.986
The only thing that mattered is, did the vaccine that we created at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia do what it was claimed to do?

01:40:57.106 --> 01:40:59.648
Has it prevented hospitalization and suffering and death?

01:40:59.688 --> 01:41:01.350
And the answer to that question is yes.

01:41:02.789 --> 01:41:08.710
It's a mistake that we have a vaccine against rotavirus, the vaccine that Paul Offit helped to develop.

01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:12.311
In the third world, maybe people are dying of rotavirus.

01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:18.052
But in this country, you have to do backflips to show a death toll of people from rotavirus.

01:41:18.192 --> 01:41:25.494
Well, one of the bitter ironies of vaccination is it carries with it the problems of its own success.

01:41:26.033 --> 01:41:34.298
Author and bioethicist Arthur Kaplan runs a special program at UPenn on the... Bioethicist Arthur Kaplan!

01:41:34.578 --> 01:41:41.062
I'm wondering if this is the same bioethicist that Robert Malone claimed was his mentor.

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.223
Holy shit.

01:41:43.863 --> 01:41:57.290
Mark, we need to figure that out because I never actually heard that guy's name, but he definitely claimed that he had a bioethics advisor or mentor that he talked about the Jesse Gelsinger case with.

01:41:58.090 --> 01:41:58.671
Oh boy.

01:41:58.871 --> 01:41:59.431
Oh boy.

01:41:59.631 --> 01:42:00.111
Oh boy.

01:42:01.072 --> 01:42:03.153
The ethical issues surrounding vaccines.

01:42:03.675 --> 01:42:08.216
Many parents are not thinking about the risk side of disease because they don't see those diseases.

01:42:08.316 --> 01:42:11.937
They've never seen any child rendered deaf by the mumps.

01:42:12.037 --> 01:42:19.360
They've never seen somebody... I just got a real-time thing that we are

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.062
downloading more video from our website than we've ever downloaded before.

01:42:25.102 --> 01:42:31.985
We've actually reached a cap of sorts and we might have to pay more money to our host server.

01:42:32.025 --> 01:42:35.226
So thank you very much for downloading the app and watching our work.

01:42:35.346 --> 01:42:38.888
It's really kicking ass and that's okay with me.

01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:40.109
I like that a lot.

01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:43.251
We have downloaded a lot today.

01:42:43.311 --> 01:42:44.091
It's very exciting.

01:42:44.111 --> 01:42:45.012
There's a lot of watchers.

01:42:45.472 --> 01:42:47.053
Who's had a case of polio.

01:42:47.493 --> 01:42:48.233
I had polio.

01:42:48.433 --> 01:42:52.735
I was in the hospital paralyzed legs and neck for about a year.

01:42:52.915 --> 01:42:56.297
So I know firsthand what the polio epidemic looked like.

01:42:56.377 --> 01:43:02.860
I was sort of at the last outbreak before the vaccines really came online and eliminated it.

01:43:03.757 --> 01:43:08.780
Vaccine-preventable diseases like polio have become vanishingly rare in the United States.

01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:12.903
So rare, in fact, that most younger doctors have never seen a case.

01:43:16.445 --> 01:43:21.348
This is one of the few places where you can see what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.

01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:26.971
This is a case of pertussis, also known as whooping cough.

01:43:28.052 --> 01:43:30.153
The audience is made up of paramedic students.

01:43:30.595 --> 01:43:31.195
She can't breathe.

01:43:32.056 --> 01:43:36.478
And that's horrifying for any patient of any age to discover that your airway has closed and you can't inhale.

01:43:36.498 --> 01:43:42.861
The teacher, Dr. Cynthia Christophany, is a pediatric intensivist who treats children in need of critical care.

01:43:43.681 --> 01:43:50.965
She decided several years ago to document the rare cases of vaccine-preventable illness that turned up in her Portland, Oregon, ICU.

01:43:51.905 --> 01:43:55.787
She uses the footage to teach other medics how to recognize these diseases.

01:43:58.157 --> 01:44:07.499
I'm old enough to have seen most of the serious life-threatening illnesses that are largely suppressed and some almost eradicated by the modern vaccines.

01:44:07.859 --> 01:44:13.421
I want to know what the prevalence is at her hospital versus at other hospitals in America because I'm not feeling this.

01:44:13.801 --> 01:44:16.041
Something about it is a little sketch.

01:44:17.082 --> 01:44:18.602
This baby was a victim of rotavirus.

01:44:20.435 --> 01:44:23.477
There's major fluid deficiency in this child's tissues.

01:44:24.237 --> 01:44:26.279
Actually kills over half a million humans annually.

01:44:26.899 --> 01:44:28.500
Most of them elsewhere on the planet.

01:44:29.161 --> 01:44:33.583
The community recollection for these diseases has largely disappeared.

01:44:33.864 --> 01:44:39.427
And so the parents of younger kids who are of vaccine age are unlikely to have had any personal experience.

01:44:39.707 --> 01:44:49.894
And unless the grandparents or others can tell them what it was like and happen to have had knowledge of somebody who had a severe complication, it's easier to imagine that these diseases eradicated.

01:44:51.075 --> 01:44:53.617
Those pox are actually something probably none of you have ever seen.

01:44:53.657 --> 01:44:54.477
They're chicken pox.

01:44:54.738 --> 01:44:58.400
This patient had one of the common or potentially lethal complications of chicken pox.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.381
He got strep sepsis from an infected lesion.

01:45:00.922 --> 01:45:04.484
This child came as close to dying of chicken pox as you can come without doing it.

01:45:04.945 --> 01:45:11.449
And so I encourage you to remember that chicken pox also can cause fatalities, even though most people used to think of it as a rite of passage in childhood.

01:45:11.989 --> 01:45:12.830
And we all got it.

01:45:15.072 --> 01:45:16.032
You can do better than that.

01:45:16.152 --> 01:45:16.873
There is a vaccine.

01:45:18.697 --> 01:45:19.578
This one's a scary one.

01:45:20.278 --> 01:45:23.040
This is Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis.

01:45:23.701 --> 01:45:27.084
And he was actually the last patient I ever saw with this disease.

01:45:27.204 --> 01:45:31.067
I can tell you, it was the scourge of pediatrics when I was in training because there was no vaccine.

01:45:31.647 --> 01:45:34.049
But beware, it could come back if people stop vaccinating.

01:45:36.246 --> 01:45:38.947
Why are we giving children so many vaccines?

01:45:39.288 --> 01:45:49.173
There's no more polio in the United States, and there's no more diphtheria in the United States, and no one, no child has contracted wild polio since 1979.

01:45:49.213 --> 01:45:51.374
In February of 2015, Brandy Vaughn is just getting started.

01:45:51.414 --> 01:45:52.035
Just keep that in mind.

01:45:59.167 --> 01:46:00.548
She was not on this show.

01:46:00.609 --> 01:46:01.970
She's not in the United States.

01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:05.173
So when do we take polio off the vaccine schedule?

01:46:05.493 --> 01:46:07.115
When do we say fantastic?

01:46:07.175 --> 01:46:08.236
The vaccine worked.

01:46:08.677 --> 01:46:09.538
We figured it out.

01:46:09.598 --> 01:46:11.339
We don't have a polio epidemic anymore.

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:13.522
Let's stop vaccinating against polio.

01:46:14.289 --> 01:46:24.151
As vaccine-preventable diseases have become less visible, some Americans have become more concerned about the risks posed by vaccines than by the diseases they prevent.

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:39.234
Public health officials like NIH's Anthony Fauci have struggled with how to communicate the risks of vaccines without causing undue fear of common side effects such as mild fevers and serious adverse events that are extremely rare.

01:46:39.605 --> 01:46:44.029
To say that there is no risk in any vaccine would not be truthful.

01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:47.673
What is the risk of injecting something into someone's arm?

01:46:48.514 --> 01:46:58.324
The risk is that a certain proportion of people will get swelling and a little bit of pain lasting from an hour to a day.

01:46:58.644 --> 01:47:01.026
That is a very acceptable risk.

01:47:02.142 --> 01:47:08.513
A very, very, very small percentage of people will get an allergic reaction.

01:47:08.693 --> 01:47:13.782
Namely, there's a component of the vaccine that they didn't realize that they were allergic to.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:23.113
And then there's a subset of a very, very, very, very small percentage of those who actually could get a serious reaction.

01:47:23.273 --> 01:47:27.815
But if you look at that, the risk of that is so minuscule.

01:47:27.976 --> 01:47:34.939
See, so the idea is, in my humble opinion, that vaccine injury is extremely rare on all sides.

01:47:35.819 --> 01:47:44.304
It might be less rare in America than it is in other Western nations because of the frequency with which we engage in intramuscular injection.

01:47:44.924 --> 01:48:04.951
But even here, the then and now head of that, you know, the whole thing cannot explain to you that there is a pretty big functional systemic biological difference between injecting cutaneously, swallowing something, inhaling something or injecting intramuscularly or IV.

01:48:06.371 --> 01:48:13.394
And those differences have huge consequences in terms of dosage and temporal exposure and the way in which

01:48:13.939 --> 01:48:23.743
They interact or not interact with the liver, and when they interact with the liver, when they interact with the kidneys, when they meet the immune system, and in what context.

01:48:24.884 --> 01:48:26.505
And these are not subtle things.

01:48:26.565 --> 01:48:30.766
These are essential things to how our biology works.

01:48:30.986 --> 01:48:35.108
And these people are on a script to avoid ever revealing that.

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:41.111
It is instead a full court press to make everyone believe,

01:48:41.891 --> 01:49:09.535
evolution is real because of DNA and that we understand or soon we will understand everything because evolution is real because of DNA I'm gonna leave it right here and come back after basketball and try to do a little bit more and otherwise most certainly okay I'm getting a phone call here I'm just gonna listen to it hello sir so what we know about Emilio Amini is that as a senior scientist at

01:49:10.467 --> 01:49:11.548
Merck Corporation.

01:49:12.128 --> 01:49:26.217
He was along with, I think, collaborating with David Baltimore in February of 2001, according to a Wall Street Journal article titled Merck Starts Human Trials of Its New AIDS Vaccine.

01:49:26.597 --> 01:49:26.957
Oops.

01:49:28.418 --> 01:49:35.122
And it's noteworthy that Merck's new experimental vaccine at the time, like other partial protein vaccines,

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.761
than the so-called killer T cells.

01:49:41.981 --> 01:49:48.964
And it builds on earlier experiment that Merck vaccine that uses a so-called naked DNA.

01:49:49.565 --> 01:49:50.265
Nice.

01:49:51.903 --> 01:49:53.404
was licensed from Vykal.

01:49:54.245 --> 01:49:59.329
So he was at Merck doing a pre-911 HIV vaccine.

01:49:59.730 --> 01:50:03.933
Something that would be helpful, by the way, in case the military needs to be protected against anthrax.

01:50:04.294 --> 01:50:04.694
I don't know.

01:50:05.174 --> 01:50:15.423
And they were using technology from Vykal, which is where both Inder Verma and Robert Malone and the late John Wolf had their patents from.

01:50:16.223 --> 01:50:18.404
Hey, thanks for calling in, fella.

01:50:18.504 --> 01:50:20.905
I don't know who you are, but you seem to be a pretty smart guy.

01:50:21.765 --> 01:50:23.946
You should look up Mark Kulak on the internet.

01:50:23.986 --> 01:50:24.886
He's pretty smart, too.

01:50:24.906 --> 01:50:25.946
You sound a lot like him.

01:50:28.007 --> 01:50:28.607
Kulak?

01:50:28.647 --> 01:50:29.828
That sounds like a Polish dude.

01:50:30.088 --> 01:50:30.188
Yeah.

01:50:30.228 --> 01:50:31.388
I wouldn't trust him.

01:50:31.408 --> 01:50:31.648
Bye.

01:50:31.728 --> 01:50:31.949
Later.

01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.389
Later.

01:50:33.129 --> 01:50:33.669
All right, guys.

01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:35.150
I'll see you in a few minutes.

01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:36.830
I've got to eat my sandwich and get out of here.

01:50:38.811 --> 01:50:39.891
Thank you very much for being here.

01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:40.972
I'll see you again soon, right?

01:50:40.992 --> 01:50:41.472
I'll be back.

01:50:42.172 --> 01:50:44.293
I'll most likely be back after basketball.
