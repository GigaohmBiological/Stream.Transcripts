WEBVTT

00:17.824 --> 00:17.888
you

01:24.873 --> 01:28.837
Run into the tunnel.

01:28.937 --> 01:32.240
You have to go as fast as you can.

01:34.922 --> 01:36.484
You can trust me.

01:37.004 --> 01:39.867
It's real.

01:40.007 --> 01:42.369
It's real.

01:42.509 --> 01:44.251
Full speed Kevin.

01:47.907 --> 01:52.410
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

02:13.152 --> 02:16.633
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

02:16.893 --> 02:17.934
But this one is pretty cool.

02:18.294 --> 02:21.015
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

02:21.755 --> 02:25.016
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

02:25.616 --> 02:28.077
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

02:28.117 --> 02:33.098
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

02:33.398 --> 02:35.839
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

02:35.859 --> 02:38.080
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

02:43.658 --> 02:56.003
At UNC Gilling School of Global Public Health, we work on coronavirus, which infect many different kinds of mammals and birds and are notoriously good at jumping from wild animals to cause devastating infections in humans.

02:56.564 --> 03:02.566
One recent example of this is MERS coronavirus, which was discovered to have jumped from bats to camels to humans in 2012.

03:02.606 --> 03:10.910
To date, MERS has caused over 2,000 cases globally, and 4 in 10 people who get infected with MERS die from the infection.

03:12.051 --> 03:24.039
As we saw with the global epidemic of SARS coronavirus in 2003, air travel of MERS-infected persons from the Middle East has carried the virus to 27 countries, including South Korea, where there are almost 200 MERS cases.

03:24.739 --> 03:27.741
To date, there are no treatments for any human coronavirus.

03:28.742 --> 03:39.169
In collaboration with Gilead Sciences and Vanderbilt School of Medicine, we've discovered an experimental antiviral drug called GS5734, which can prevent SARS coronavirus disease in mice

03:39.614 --> 03:41.857
even if given after infection has been established.

03:53.922 --> 03:57.263
And maybe, even in the future, if a novel coronavirus were to emerge.

03:57.883 --> 04:00.964
This work was published today in Science Translational Medicine.

04:01.184 --> 04:09.567
The study is important because this is the first drug that's been shown to work against highly pathogenic emerging coronaviruses.

04:10.347 --> 04:14.448
And it has high potential to work in human settings.

04:28.936 --> 04:36.848
John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

04:37.368 --> 04:41.094
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.

04:43.012 --> 04:59.356
But the GN1 is very, very alarming because the mutations are no longer restricted to spike protein, which indicates enhanced activity of CTLs to diminish viral infectiousness.

05:00.156 --> 05:10.239
And that CTL activity is responsible for the decline of T cells that in fact boost the non-neutralizing antibodies that prevent virulence.

05:10.959 --> 05:34.138
So that is what I've been predicting all the time, that ultimately this evolution would inevitably lead to the emergence of a highly virulent variant that would cause waves of hospitalization and severe disease in highly vaccinated countries.

05:34.298 --> 05:38.942
Of course, always the same, only in highly vaccinated countries, right?

05:40.501 --> 05:41.302
So that's a relief.

05:45.887 --> 05:49.811
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:51.613 --> 05:52.314
And I have lied.

05:52.334 --> 05:53.375
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.336
I don't want to lie.

05:54.817 --> 05:56.178
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

05:56.278 --> 05:57.319
I try not to be a liar.

05:57.339 --> 05:58.180
I don't want to be a liar.

05:58.741 --> 06:01.464
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:03.626 --> 06:05.547
the specialization should make you suspicious.

06:06.227 --> 06:12.471
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

06:12.911 --> 06:14.872
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

06:14.892 --> 06:17.414
And that's sort of my starting bias.

06:23.370 --> 06:43.535
I'm going to kind of narrate the beginning here because I want to make it very clear from the beginning, anyone tuning in for the first time, the absolute clear message is that the populist right in America has been captured by a group of actors that have created an illusion of consensus about a lab leak, gain-of-function virus.

06:44.415 --> 07:05.025
And if you want to rescue your family and friends from this fake populist movement, it is going to require a lot of biology and it's going to require accepting that a lot of people that you might think or your family and friends might think are good guys are actually wittingly or unwittingly participating in this.

07:06.825 --> 07:07.106
It is a

07:08.436 --> 07:12.279
manipulation of our society that is occurring here.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.580
And not everybody knows.

07:13.920 --> 07:20.625
A lot of people in academic biology are just wholly unaware, just like I was five years ago.

07:21.066 --> 07:26.530
And so there is hope that more people can be brought to realize how we've been manipulated.

07:27.050 --> 07:31.273
But it's going to be very difficult because there are active traitors

07:32.196 --> 07:50.348
that have been put in place to curate this narrative about a novel virus, to get in front of people like Byron Bridle, to make sure that Byron Bridle focused on the transfection and did not realize or come to realize that the novel virus narrative was the trap.

07:51.009 --> 07:58.374
And so Byron Bridle is another person who's probably unwittingly participating because these three guys ganged up on him.

07:59.326 --> 08:01.547
And these three guys have ganged up on me before.

08:01.907 --> 08:05.288
And so I know that these people are traitors.

08:05.448 --> 08:17.453
I know that they are selling out our grandkids just in the same way that Steve Bannon and this guy would sell out our grandkids and have been for the last 10 years or more.

08:18.313 --> 08:21.635
They are manipulating this unseen mechanism of society.

08:22.611 --> 08:27.996
And they constitute part of an invisible government that is the true ruling power of our country.

08:28.036 --> 08:30.559
They're just herding cats.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.662
And they're using social media to do it.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.144
That's the most frightening part.

08:35.224 --> 08:42.130
These actors were put in place on social media to curate the skepticism.

08:43.129 --> 08:53.055
of the novel virus to fuel a narrative that accepted the novel virus and even accepted the fact that it was likely a lab leak or even a bioweapon.

08:53.075 --> 09:05.663
And the reason why was so that the transfection would never be blamed for all of the harm that it was expected to do over time as they slowly transitioned

09:06.784 --> 09:14.227
our already criminal vaccine schedule in America to to transfection.

09:14.727 --> 09:18.548
Professor said very good because the question was very good.

09:19.348 --> 09:27.131
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic.

09:27.231 --> 09:30.072
There was no pandemic and there will be no pandemic.

09:30.772 --> 09:30.872
And

09:33.923 --> 09:37.205
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

09:37.445 --> 09:37.905
It can't.

09:38.546 --> 09:42.308
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.391
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

09:47.911 --> 09:51.193
And I would argue that that's absolutely absurd.

09:51.433 --> 09:59.958
If RNA cannot pandemic, then this is the most important basic biology lesson that we can give to our grandkids.

10:00.618 --> 10:08.804
because this succinct three-word phrase is enough to dispel the entire public health narrative.

10:09.744 --> 10:19.411
And so it is striking to me that both of these doctors think that we shouldn't waste time talking about it if indeed Jay is right, RNA cannot pandemic.

10:26.161 --> 10:30.164
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

10:30.184 --> 10:31.925
That's a very nice compliment.

10:31.965 --> 10:32.626
Thank you very much.

10:32.686 --> 10:33.887
Can you hear me better now or not?

10:34.247 --> 10:35.808
Yes, much better.

10:35.848 --> 10:44.295
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

10:44.615 --> 10:48.178
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

10:48.458 --> 10:52.001
And despite the fact that it's very, very likely what happened,

10:52.761 --> 10:56.184
Are you going to do the CD and tape analogy?

10:56.244 --> 10:58.826
Because that really really hit home for me.

10:59.491 --> 11:15.002
Despite the fact that she even really loves the analogy to describe it that it kept her up at night She has never promoted those ideas as mine even though that she will later you will see her on a stream with me and Robert F Kennedy jr.

11:15.182 --> 11:23.809
And Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Tess Laurie they will not these people will not admit these organizations will not admit that any

11:24.680 --> 11:40.033
good biological idea that they have had, they have diluted, they have titrated, they have obfuscated the truth by not telling you what Brandy Vaughn said best in 2016 already before any of these people were on the scene.

11:42.415 --> 11:46.038
It is extraordinary where we are because it can be seen.

11:46.138 --> 11:50.442
The illusion and the team, worst case scenario, can be seen.

11:51.303 --> 11:52.504
They are visible right now.

11:55.595 --> 12:01.529
These are not post-docs or not post-secondary degrees, and she and they know this.

12:02.662 --> 12:12.608
If you are not familiar with the SPARS pandemic exercise document and what I'm referring to when I say EpiGirl, you don't understand what Steve Kirsch is doing.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.710
You don't understand what Jessica Rose is doing.

12:15.750 --> 12:31.019
You don't understand what a lot of these people are being set up to do by others that are actors, the ones that all agree to accept her CV as five post-secondary degrees.

12:34.366 --> 12:52.792
I mean, it is maximum absurdity that all of these people seem to ignore that, including these skeptics who supposedly are working actively to expose these people in the background as fake virology-pushing public health puppets.

12:53.592 --> 13:03.995
And yet, for some reason, the only person that these six people have managed to ever attack in the last five years and publicly say is a puppet is myself.

13:05.387 --> 13:10.110
Kevin McCairn is a guy who I think was recruited specifically to deal with me.

13:10.130 --> 13:17.094
And he very quickly in 2020 knew that these other people were really going to be important.

13:17.135 --> 13:26.781
These other international actors, these other American actors with book deals and with grants and these kinds of things.

13:27.594 --> 13:31.917
And so the illusion of consensus created by T. Morris Gay Scenario... I'm not sure exactly who he is.

13:32.037 --> 13:33.418
His name is J.J.

13:33.558 --> 13:34.019
Cooey.

13:34.239 --> 13:38.522
...is one that revolves around the idea that they never say murder.

13:38.562 --> 13:41.364
They're never going to tell you that they murdered people in America.

13:42.091 --> 13:43.973
to create the illusion of a pandemic.

13:44.033 --> 13:50.400
They locked down Australia and didn't murder people to create the illusion of a pandemic happening in America.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.962
None of those people are going to say that.

13:52.042 --> 13:57.288
None of these people are going to say it, even though I've been trying to tell them that for almost three years now.

13:58.117 --> 14:13.328
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest distillation of what the- I think it's very important to understand that I don't take it very lightly to say that I think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:13.508 --> 14:17.631
is being misled by his advisors and the people behind the scenes.

14:18.131 --> 14:24.956
I don't think he's sophisticated enough to understand that for his entire life, he has been a Truman Show victim.

14:27.003 --> 14:30.916
And in this particular case, with this particular biology, these people are lying.

14:30.956 --> 14:33.303
Now, this one... So, for what it's worth, I mean...

14:34.321 --> 14:36.102
It's such a chaotic scene.

14:36.362 --> 14:42.785
Before I let it play, this one is especially important because this is a person who overplayed her hand several times.

14:42.825 --> 14:56.632
I think made several key miscalculations because this might be a bench warming team that was brought on to try and keep me busy and persuade me that there were other people worth talking to.

14:57.352 --> 15:02.775
And so I wasted more than a year and a half on these three people that have all turned out to be traitors as well.

15:03.886 --> 15:11.571
Now what's important here is that in this particular voicemail, she is going to refer to a substack named Sage Hanna.

15:12.591 --> 15:21.016
Say that it's a he, but she's not really sure who runs the substack, and then also claim that that substack threatened her with her life.

15:21.697 --> 15:32.263
Now the important thing to understand about Sage Hanna, the anonymous substack hero, is that that is one of the few substacks that has occasionally cited my work.

15:33.615 --> 15:45.687
And I would bet dollars to donuts that if you go to Sagehana and try to find the last time that substack cited my work as being seminal to understanding the illusion of the pandemic, I think you'll strike out.

15:46.889 --> 16:16.377
because it is very likely that just like Jiki Leaks was actually part of the same illusion, and that's why these people were so adamant that I should hate Jiki Leaks, it's also probably these people or their associates that run the substack Sagehana, and that's why every once in a while that substack was able to cite me or to say something that I said was interesting, but not quite absorb the whole message, the simple message,

16:16.937 --> 16:22.641
that intramuscular injection is dumb, that RNA cannot pandemic, and that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal.

16:23.201 --> 16:39.091
And so Jessica Hockett, an American faker, coordinating with these international traders, who lost three of my presentations that I gave to Panda, these people would also like you to believe that they're against Sage Hana.

16:42.754 --> 16:44.635
Oh, I guess I got to push play again here.

16:48.235 --> 16:50.876
You know, I don't follow very many people anymore.

16:50.896 --> 17:10.161
I just follow like 22 if I follow somebody I Trust them, you know as far as like I know as much as it depends on my knowledge and sense of things you know that that it's not that I agree with everything that person says necessarily, but That person is they are who they say they are.

17:10.541 --> 17:14.342
They are authentic if you know

17:16.389 --> 17:21.473
I admit that I'm biased because I know that, especially Jonathan Engler, I know him well.

17:22.378 --> 17:26.219
So, and have, you know, for a year plus.

17:26.980 --> 17:30.361
So... I mean, a year plus, what a great friendship they have.

17:30.401 --> 17:38.383
If Jonathan Engler turns out to be, you know, something that he's not, or some kind of manipulator, I mean, I would be devastated.

17:38.403 --> 17:44.345
I would be absolutely devastated and probably, you know, quit this whole thing and be like, okay, then I don't know anybody.

17:44.665 --> 17:45.766
Then I can't tell anything.

17:46.546 --> 17:53.473
So that doesn't mean that you have to see it the same way You know Martin saying like as much as far as I so think about how?

17:53.573 --> 18:02.362
Non-committal that is if I'm saying that these people are traitors to America and she says well, I don't see it that way But you don't have to see it the way that I see it

18:03.669 --> 18:06.051
This is the maximum bullshit.

18:06.351 --> 18:17.581
This is the maximum level of malevolence that you see here because it's contradictory, it's flirting, it's hilarious, it's Valley Girl, it's liars, okay?

18:18.141 --> 18:22.885
And I have their private messages, their direct messages, their voicemails.

18:23.506 --> 18:28.810
And if I were to publish all of those, these people would beyond a shadow of a doubt be revealed

18:29.651 --> 18:58.845
as the meddling liars that they are so it is extraordinary to me that they go on writing their substacks and pretending like I have never existed in their lives because those days are coming where all of this will be revealed and Jessica Hockett will be revealed to the American public and to the entire world that cares that she was always playing against us just like Nick Hudson just like Jonathan Engler

19:02.091 --> 19:05.154
I am making accusations that I do not take lightly.

19:05.294 --> 19:20.546
I am making accusations against people that have meddled with me and my ability to make a living, my ability to run a business based out of biological consulting and teaching on the internet and content creation.

19:21.067 --> 19:31.095
These people have actively meddled against that while taking probably laundered money from Substack, which could be revealed in an investigation.

19:34.437 --> 19:37.178
book deals, all kinds of other crap.

19:37.478 --> 19:38.359
Listen carefully.

19:38.379 --> 19:39.039
I know.

19:40.620 --> 19:47.682
Martin and Norman Fenton are putting, you know, they put their sub-stacks over the past four years into a book.

19:47.742 --> 20:02.428
I mean, I've read the, I skimmed the book, and the chapter, or excuse me, that paper that they, that Jonathan and Martin just wrote, where they included your work, it's going into that book.

20:04.591 --> 20:08.535
and content that I wrote with them is going into that book.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.618
Martin's in the academic world.

20:11.719 --> 20:14.922
He was finishing marking up papers this week.

20:16.323 --> 20:18.906
He does play things a little closer to

20:20.421 --> 20:40.975
The best right that that is the way he is on on social media, but my experiences with him have been very good so yeah, if those guys are like playing me or using me or Recall, please recall that this is a married woman with a with a restaurateur husband Who lives in Chicago apparently?

20:41.935 --> 20:46.258
Whose restaurateur husband and herself used to live in Northern Virginia, I believe I

20:49.446 --> 21:09.454
She's leaving like eight minute voicemail messages on another man's phone who she's never met in person and also having relationships with other men across the ocean that she doesn't know and swears that they must be good guys because I've bad friends with these guys for like a year.

21:12.315 --> 21:14.756
Just try to keep in context what's going on here.

21:15.566 --> 21:19.849
What they did what they are willing to do over the course of many many months.

21:19.989 --> 21:28.554
They will just lie to people Who knows right again, I don't know what I don't know what to say but

21:30.559 --> 21:38.907
I would continue, I can't tell you what to do, but I would continue to give them, I recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt.

21:38.927 --> 21:46.775
This is after me telling her that they are traitors to American grandchildren and they are liars to her and me and everybody.

21:47.916 --> 21:50.599
After I told her this, this is her response.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.923
Until there's really, really good reason not to.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.811
Catherine Watt's an interesting one for me.

22:00.032 --> 22:03.412
I mean, I replied to her on Sage Hanna's sub-stack.

22:03.832 --> 22:10.893
I actually blocked Sage Hanna, but, cause he, you know, told me he didn't care if I got shot in the head or, you know, some kind of crazy nonsense.

22:10.933 --> 22:12.514
I have no idea who runs that sub-stack.

22:13.294 --> 22:16.974
I think Catherine's legitimate.

22:17.034 --> 22:23.636
I don't understand the role of Sasha Latupova a hundred percent, but I've been honest about that with people about what I think is going on there.

22:26.116 --> 22:26.336
Again,

22:28.317 --> 22:40.102
Again, trying to explain to her that Sasha Latupova is a traitor to our grandchildren, and here she is coping, pretending that, well, you know, I've already said I don't know what Sasha's doing.

22:40.782 --> 22:43.964
Just like I already said that I kind of like Jonathan and Nick.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.965
This is the most ridiculously

22:48.206 --> 23:05.905
huge incriminating voicemail that there is if you realize that this is like one day after she released the video of herself, her friend Hugh Astin, and myself presenting to Ron Johnson's staff after two years of waiting.

23:07.091 --> 23:09.632
She finally got their attention on Twitter.

23:09.652 --> 23:16.794
It wasn't me who got invited to a meeting to present, even though Ron Johnson called me three years before this.

23:17.635 --> 23:23.857
I never got invited until good old Jessica Hockett got a hearing with some staff members.

23:23.897 --> 23:30.459
And then she released that video, sent this ridiculous voicemail to me, and then called Mark Kulak.

23:31.584 --> 23:45.827
told him that she was afraid and was gonna call the cops on him and at the same time sent me an email with an ultimatum about, you know, maybe we should have a sit down with you and Jonathan Engler and we can clear all this up right now, but you should choose sides.

23:51.027 --> 23:54.570
Ladies and gentlemen, they have spread their butter over too much bread.

23:55.311 --> 24:00.996
These people are so transparently traitors, so transparently liars.

24:01.576 --> 24:09.924
After five years, their cognitive understanding and ability to explain what happened has so poorly progressed

24:10.464 --> 24:16.588
that this is a voicemail from a woman who has left X completely.

24:16.828 --> 24:17.388
And why?

24:17.908 --> 24:23.872
Because she wants to get rid of the direct messages that I've already screenshot daily.

24:24.994 --> 24:30.738
These are the kind of amateurs that we are playing with because they actually think that we didn't know.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.421
They actually think that we weren't already keeping track of them.

24:35.241 --> 24:48.250
How else could we possibly have so much data on them if we weren't already listening and keeping track of their inconsistencies, their incongruencies, their inability to promote anybody but each other.

24:49.832 --> 24:50.872
These are traitors.

24:51.153 --> 24:52.974
They belong in jail.

24:54.924 --> 25:04.752
Everybody on this screen belongs in jail or in witness protection after having turned in and told what happened.

25:06.174 --> 25:07.995
That is the accusation.

25:08.055 --> 25:09.196
That is what I want.

25:09.276 --> 25:12.279
That is what the message of GigaOM Biological is.

25:12.819 --> 25:22.808
If that doesn't jive with you or it doesn't ring true with you, it's good to get out now because the stream is, this is not going away.

25:23.356 --> 25:35.242
head down, I'm really trying to focus on what I'm doing and what I do well as much as possible because I believe that that will bring the best result.

25:35.422 --> 25:45.647
And you've been really formative for me and I think a lot of other people and you've taken the hits, not just with the clone stuff or the possibilities of

25:46.377 --> 25:54.279
you know, building a biological bridge there with the clone, but you've been helpful in helping people see who some of these players really are.

25:54.299 --> 25:59.560
You know, I think that in some ways is probably your best, you know, biggest contribution.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.741
And I've tried to honor that and cite you where and when I can.

26:02.861 --> 26:09.402
So, you know, I only know who I am and I'm legit.

26:09.422 --> 26:11.343
Okay.

26:11.383 --> 26:11.763
Have a good day.

26:14.591 --> 26:26.900
It's pathetic, really, because none of them will ever mention that supplementary oxygen all by itself in a healthy human being can induce ARDS, which could lead to pneumonia.

26:29.422 --> 26:40.251
Ventilators were used to stop the spread, but also to apply oxygen in the same way a lack of antibiotic use in that scenario would be murder.

26:41.594 --> 26:55.979
and the multi-year opioid crisis allowed to go wild for 2020, 21, and 22 is never mentioned as a source of the decreasing life expectancy in America.

26:56.019 --> 27:10.124
More importantly, it was actually specifically cited by both Pierre Cory and the trader Jessica Rose as not being the source of the decrease in life expectancy, which is extraordinary as far as admissions go.

27:13.936 --> 27:20.219
And that's why none of these people for five years have ever been able to explain why PCR is a diagnostic is a fraud.

27:20.259 --> 27:28.282
Instead, many of them were very upfront and out in front explaining exactly how it works and why overcycling might be a problem.

27:31.844 --> 27:36.266
None of them will ever explain Brandy Vaughn's absolutely

27:37.631 --> 27:44.117
acidic comparison between ingestion and injection of a pharmaceutical.

27:44.157 --> 27:47.420
This acidic, meaning it just dissolves all the other arguments.

27:48.281 --> 27:49.882
You don't have to go any farther than that.

27:49.942 --> 27:51.423
That's the biology right there.

27:51.664 --> 27:55.367
It's injection versus ingestion of a pharmaceutical.

27:55.887 --> 28:01.432
And we have injections, lots of them, and they are completely, there's no liability.

28:02.353 --> 28:04.075
And there's no biology to support it.

28:05.182 --> 28:11.764
And these same people will never mention the population pyramid because the population pyramid is a biological phenomenon.

28:11.804 --> 28:20.067
It is a source of an increase in all-cause mortality that they knew was coming and they were put in place to distort.

28:21.747 --> 28:23.828
That's why none of them will mention Brandy Vaughn.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.147
Do you want to know how they stay on script?

28:27.167 --> 28:29.327
They don't mention supplementary oxygen at all.

28:29.407 --> 28:33.449
They say things like remdesivir and ventilators.

28:33.489 --> 28:35.350
They skip the starting point.

28:36.330 --> 28:38.551
They do not mention a lack of antibiotic use.

28:38.671 --> 28:44.453
Again, because the starting point alone, supplementary oxygen can get you to a stage where you have pneumonia.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.694
And if they don't give you antibiotics, you will die.

28:48.553 --> 28:50.954
not mention the multi-year opioid crisis.

28:51.054 --> 28:58.895
Everybody from Meryl Nass to Jessica Rose to Pierre Cory to, you know, the virology great Gerrit van den Bosch.

28:58.915 --> 29:03.276
He's, you know, I didn't know that that was, I don't know anything about opioids and blah, blah, blah.

29:03.797 --> 29:06.657
Because it would ruin their narrative.

29:07.297 --> 29:18.120
And that's why these same people didn't explain PCR as a fraud or sequencing as a fraud or who was doing the sequencing for the first three years, not to mention Brandy Vaughn.

29:20.239 --> 29:22.080
shouldn't just be a few people that are leaders.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.102
Everybody has to figure out their own leader inside themselves.

29:25.503 --> 29:32.127
If they're too shy to go approach somebody in person, then stick a card or a flyer on someone's car next to you every time you park your car.

29:32.468 --> 29:37.711
Stick a card inside of a gas station credit card slot every time you get gas.

29:37.771 --> 29:47.138
If everybody that is aware of the truth and awake to the truth started to do these things, we can touch people, the hearts and minds of people, one person at a time,

29:47.671 --> 29:48.632
in day-to-day living.

29:48.652 --> 29:54.116
We don't need these echo chambers online where we're all repeating to the same followers most of the time.

29:54.316 --> 30:08.808
Now one thing to keep in mind, I think, is that unlike at this time before the pandemic or just after the pandemic started, but for sure in 2015 and 2016, this strategy would have worked.

30:08.828 --> 30:12.050
This strategy of Brandy Vaughn putting things on

30:15.660 --> 30:21.762
paper and also selling materials and also putting these billboards up was working, okay?

30:22.243 --> 30:35.428
But now that we have been subject to five years of psychological torture and five years of brainwashing, this simple tactic won't work because most people will simply dismiss

30:36.650 --> 30:39.872
our biology as just anti-vaxxer nonsense.

30:40.092 --> 30:42.354
And so we need a new strategy.

30:42.414 --> 30:53.460
We need to be teaching this from the ground up, from the biology 101 up, so that we're not starting with anti-vax, even though that is where we are.

30:54.061 --> 30:59.864
We are starting with our understanding of biology, which actually edifies the stance of anti-vax.

31:00.205 --> 31:05.668
We get a few new people, but I think we really need more people to take what they're learning and get out there and touch

31:06.206 --> 31:07.662
people that they're in a community with.

31:11.584 --> 31:20.027
And so, as usual, I'm going to dedicate this Monday stream to the memory of Brandy Vaughn, who said it exactly right when no one else around her would.

31:21.688 --> 31:29.531
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biology enthusiast, let's say.

31:29.551 --> 31:32.873
I really think that biology is the way.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.214
I think if we get a new Biology 101 in your head,

31:36.494 --> 31:53.166
Maybe not quite as is done and depicted in this picture, but just by reading and by sharing discussions about the right thing, we can break the illusion of consensus that has been consciously and intelligently created, right?

31:53.206 --> 32:04.895
They have absolutely positively manipulated us because of how you see Bob's picture there, sitting on the couch with our phones and our devices, binge watching.

32:06.056 --> 32:11.881
We are being manipulated by this invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country right now.

32:11.941 --> 32:14.463
That's why everybody's so up in arms.

32:14.503 --> 32:21.190
These are social media programs that should better be called military control programs.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.031
They are military algorithms.

32:24.373 --> 32:29.016
I'm going to go hard again today, going full core press.

32:29.056 --> 32:33.180
We're going to be very physical in the paint today because you might not see me play again.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.343
I don't know when is the last time or the next time I'm going to be able to say this.

32:37.443 --> 32:40.546
So, again, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

32:40.806 --> 32:43.048
I am the Chief Biologist of Gigalem Biological.

32:43.068 --> 32:47.452
You can find my work on PubMed using my last name plus my first two initials.

32:48.572 --> 32:54.818
There's one paper there that's fun to look at because a lot of those people are meddlers and I didn't know it at the time of course.

32:54.898 --> 32:59.702
I presented to Panda of course, Nick lost my work and Jonathan lost my work.

32:59.762 --> 33:02.984
I presented to the NCI, I don't think that's a very great

33:04.205 --> 33:06.827
You know, it means well, I guess, at least it used to.

33:06.867 --> 33:08.288
The wellness company, same deal.

33:08.409 --> 33:09.910
I presented all this stuff to them.

33:11.131 --> 33:15.294
I was a staff scientist for Children's Health Defense for about a half a year.

33:15.894 --> 33:25.902
And before that, for more than a year, I was the scientific consultant behind this book with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's now our Secretary of Health and Human Services.

33:27.953 --> 33:36.075
And yeah, I told that story and where we are probably best recently at the Red Pill Expo in 2024.

33:37.335 --> 33:45.877
And moving forward, I have plans to take this to the basketball court because I think I'm trying to find a way to make this work for me and my family.

33:45.897 --> 33:49.098
And I think the way to do it is going to be biology on the basketball court.

33:49.118 --> 33:51.218
I'm going to do journal club on a basketball court.

33:51.258 --> 33:53.679
I'm going to do biology 101 on the basketball court.

33:54.465 --> 34:04.154
I'm going to do as much basketball as I can because it's the one thing that I truly love to do and I want to be able to do it while I'm still young.

34:04.754 --> 34:10.900
So I'm kind of full court press on that as well so that's some of the reason why I'm not always on air.

34:11.700 --> 34:16.765
But soon that's going to peak all around including on YouTube and I think it's going to be a big hit.

34:18.894 --> 34:22.858
Ladies and gentlemen, you can support the stream by going to GigaOMBiological.com.

34:22.878 --> 34:26.321
I guess maybe if you haven't seen me before, that's not much of a pitch.

34:27.622 --> 34:31.986
But I think after this show, if you haven't seen me before, you might understand the importance of this too.

34:33.988 --> 34:34.829
where we are headed.

34:34.949 --> 34:37.652
If you want to share my work, you can go to stream.gigaohm.bio.

34:37.692 --> 34:38.873
That's a place that I host.

34:39.354 --> 34:41.016
There are no algorithms, no sign-ins.

34:41.056 --> 34:43.498
You can even download the videos so you can watch them offline.

34:43.919 --> 34:52.047
If you want to communicate with us, please go to gigaohm.bio or send a direct email to that address there on the screen.

34:52.908 --> 34:54.809
And you can also send things to P.O.

34:54.849 --> 34:59.111
Box 802 Bethel Park PA 15102.

34:59.431 --> 35:03.692
And checks can be made out to Jonathan Cooey or to GigaOM Biological.

35:03.732 --> 35:07.034
They're always good because this is just a sole proprietorship here.

35:07.074 --> 35:08.794
So it's all the same hole.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.195
Thank you very much, guys.

35:14.331 --> 35:33.326
I don't care how you get there.

35:33.346 --> 35:36.049
I don't care what you do to get there.

35:37.950 --> 35:38.611
The goal is to win.

35:43.317 --> 35:44.237
What time is it?

35:44.317 --> 35:45.078
Game time!

35:45.158 --> 35:45.418
Woo!

35:45.798 --> 35:47.679
Oh man, I didn't even think about that.

35:47.719 --> 35:48.819
I gotta play something.

35:58.743 --> 36:11.288
I'm trying to tell you something about my life Maybe give me insight between black and white And the best thing you've ever done for me

36:13.101 --> 36:16.543
Used to help me take my life less seriously.

36:16.943 --> 36:19.384
It's only life after all.

36:20.485 --> 36:20.905
Yeah.

36:23.046 --> 36:26.768
Well, darkness has a hunger that's insatiable.

36:26.788 --> 36:31.350
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear.

36:31.370 --> 36:35.733
And I wrap my fear around me like a blanket.

36:37.765 --> 36:43.620
I sail my ship of safety till I sank it I'm crawling on your shores

36:45.171 --> 36:47.052
I went to the doctor.

36:47.653 --> 36:49.474
I went to the mountains.

36:50.034 --> 36:51.995
I looked to the children.

36:52.535 --> 36:54.477
I drank from the fountains.

36:54.877 --> 37:01.000
There's more than one answer to these questions, voiding me in a crooked line.

37:02.101 --> 37:10.606
And the less I seek my source for some definitive, closer I am to find.

37:11.066 --> 37:13.928
Closer I am to find.

37:15.228 --> 37:26.010
And I went to see the doctor of philosophy with a poster of Rasputin and a beer down to his knee.

37:26.631 --> 37:31.032
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie.

37:31.532 --> 37:33.472
He graded my performance.

37:33.912 --> 37:35.933
He said he could see through me.

37:36.013 --> 37:41.994
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper, and I was free.

37:43.806 --> 37:45.647
I went to the doctor.

37:46.308 --> 37:48.109
I went to the mountains.

37:48.690 --> 37:50.491
I looked to the children.

37:51.111 --> 37:52.993
I drank from the fountains.

37:53.453 --> 37:59.517
There's more than one answer to these questions, pointing me in a crooked line.

38:00.658 --> 38:09.124
And unless I seek my source for some definitive, closer I am to find.

38:09.604 --> 38:11.786
Closer I am to find.

38:25.234 --> 38:28.237
I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m.

38:28.257 --> 38:45.556
To seek solace in a bottle of possibly a friend And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before And I went in seeking clarity

38:47.257 --> 38:49.179
I went to the doctor.

38:49.279 --> 38:51.521
I went to the mountains.

38:52.122 --> 38:56.666
I looked to the children I drank from the fountain.

38:56.706 --> 38:59.088
We go to the doctor.

38:59.289 --> 39:01.270
We go to the mountains.

39:01.731 --> 39:02.812
We look to the children.

39:03.072 --> 39:07.697
There's more than one answer to these questions, pointing me in a crooked line.

39:23.652 --> 39:41.043
The less I seek my source for some definitive Closer I am to pine Closer I am to pine Closer I am to pine

39:46.107 --> 39:52.532
That is an absolutely spectacular tune that I actually got to see performed live more than once.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.116
Fun group, the Indigo Girls there.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.839
Did I see them open for Béla Fleck and the Flecktones once?

40:02.700 --> 40:06.103
For some reason I think I did, but I could be completely imagining that.

40:07.220 --> 40:08.021
Welcome to the show.

40:08.061 --> 40:10.842
They can only make admissions after five years, in fact.

40:12.323 --> 40:16.185
There's absolutely no doubt that we are winning right now.

40:16.886 --> 40:22.869
And so that's why I think it's very appropriate to start with such a joyful song and then maybe also this one.

40:23.889 --> 40:27.431
Because this spectacular commitment to lies is going to keep going on.

40:27.471 --> 40:28.272
There's no other way.

40:29.511 --> 40:38.575
Sorry, there's no other way to explain Kevin McKernan's public presence for five years, and more importantly, what they've said, what he's said.

40:38.595 --> 40:41.917
His track record suggests that he's a traitor.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.539
I don't know how else to say it more succinctly.

40:46.319 --> 40:49.141
His Twitter and ex-posts

40:50.401 --> 40:52.183
suggests that he is a traitor.

40:52.843 --> 40:59.929
His track record of meddling with my family and myself suggests that he is a traitor.

41:00.390 --> 41:12.340
His alliance and promotion by Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense about the DNA contamination five years later suggests that he is a traitor.

41:13.020 --> 41:18.204
And I think the reason why we have so many traitors in our midst is because the

41:19.786 --> 41:34.202
The powers that be need us to teach our children that gain of function is something they need to fear in the future, that maybe measles is going to become something they need to get re-vaccinated for, and Giga Home Biological represents

41:35.083 --> 41:49.558
really represents the farm animals waking up, the farm animals finding common sense again, and not this two legs is better than one thing, but just united non-compliance, no more of this.

41:49.618 --> 41:55.605
That's what we need to teach our children, and we can do that if we teach them the truth of the biology.

41:56.937 --> 41:59.880
Obviously, it's our fault that this picture exists.

42:00.100 --> 42:06.226
Obviously, it's our fault that we lost the attention of our college kids because we blew it.

42:06.707 --> 42:11.331
We had this history and the machine was thorough.

42:12.102 --> 42:29.938
And so if you want to get out, you're going to have to understand that it's not just these charlatans, although they are very important people on this screen, like Steve Bannon and Stanley Prusiner and David Hone, Sina Bavari, names that nobody's mentioning.

42:32.199 --> 42:38.083
But you need to also understand that these people, of course, coordinated a narrative.

42:38.403 --> 42:43.047
And the reason why it could be different this time is because they're exposed.

42:43.627 --> 42:47.229
Because the power of social media is also a weakness for them.

42:47.269 --> 42:55.475
Because you can just go back and look at their track records and see that these people are not here for our grandkids.

42:55.535 --> 42:56.916
They are there for the slavers.

42:56.956 --> 42:57.617
That's why I think

42:58.519 --> 43:00.542
This stream represents some kind of hope.

43:01.883 --> 43:14.598
It represents some kind of unavoidable truth in the future that these people cannot escape, that people learning biology are finally awakening and realizing that there are more people around who understand it.

43:14.719 --> 43:17.141
We must, as a group, seek the truth.

43:17.722 --> 43:19.203
We have to start with the truth.

43:19.483 --> 43:23.825
And if we start with the truth, intramuscular injection of medicine is dumb.

43:23.885 --> 43:28.247
If we start with the truth, transfection in healthy people is a crime.

43:28.688 --> 43:31.609
If we start with the truth, RNA cannot pandemic.

43:31.649 --> 43:34.931
And these illusions require your participation to sustain.

43:35.391 --> 43:43.175
They also require the insistence on certainty by people as diverse as Mary Holland and Paul Offit.

43:43.895 --> 43:58.590
And once you understand that these people have been in place for more than a decade, you will understand why these truths may be first best said by Brandy Vaughn, but have been said by other people and now myself.

43:59.671 --> 44:06.798
These truths need to be ignored because the vaccine schedule in the United States is a criminal enterprise.

44:07.694 --> 44:14.741
That's how you can explain why the guy from the Human Genome Project is up in my face for five years.

44:14.781 --> 44:20.807
That's why you can explain why people like George Webb were unleashed on people like Mark Kulak.

44:22.029 --> 44:23.851
It is the way we are governed.

44:24.491 --> 44:25.192
Welcome to the show.

44:25.232 --> 44:26.393
This is Gigome Biological.

44:26.433 --> 44:27.434
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

44:28.355 --> 44:29.396
I'm on Team USA.

44:29.797 --> 44:30.597
I hope you are too.

44:31.578 --> 44:40.506
I'm fighting for America's grandkids because this is for all the marbles, and I think all the marbles are essentially America's grandkids.

44:40.566 --> 44:44.489
Now, this is not a message for everyone, but it is a message for anyone.

44:44.549 --> 44:55.479
It's not for Democrats or Republicans or rich or poor people, although I would love it if some rich people would start to support this work because I think we could do a lot more with financial stability

44:57.492 --> 44:59.793
I know I could do a lot more with financial stability.

45:01.174 --> 45:03.875
All the marbles on earth are our grandkids.

45:04.036 --> 45:06.057
It's not arguing about mandates.

45:06.237 --> 45:11.319
It's about understanding that these people are playing a game for our grandkids.

45:11.359 --> 45:12.420
They are being played.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.681
They have been put in place.

45:13.721 --> 45:14.821
They are being coerced.

45:15.882 --> 45:23.506
Many of them are participating wholly, willingly in order to audition and climb the ladder of what they see as the ruling elite.

45:25.434 --> 45:27.055
That's the best way to see it.

45:27.195 --> 45:28.336
It's for all the marbles.

45:28.376 --> 45:29.797
And you need to start with the truth.

45:30.317 --> 45:32.019
And if you start with the truth, you'll get there.

45:32.759 --> 45:33.439
That's what I think.

45:35.632 --> 45:47.038
And so I call it a Lollapalooza of liars because it is an interweaved group of stages and performers that talk to each other behind stage and coordinate their performances on the stages.

45:47.659 --> 45:51.361
Because again, this is for all the grandchildren of Earth.

45:51.461 --> 45:54.222
That's why no one's really talking about Brandy Vaughn.

45:54.783 --> 45:57.624
No one ever, I mean, that's why Brandy Vaughn is dead.

45:58.124 --> 46:00.346
Let's just put it that way right now on March 17th.

46:01.686 --> 46:13.137
It's a long, strange trip it's been for me to come to understand exactly or close to understanding how malevolent this whole thing is, this Lollapalooza of liars.

46:13.177 --> 46:22.605
But most of the people that I've taken some selfies with essentially already knew from the moment that my arm went around them that I didn't believe them.

46:23.803 --> 46:32.410
from the moment that we shook hands and their clammy little, you know, little gripless handshake, I already understood that they were liars.

46:34.412 --> 46:48.423
You can tell when you approach someone with the kind of energy of truth that I have, and they're shunning you like a bright light, where they lean away from you in a picture like this, right?

46:48.923 --> 46:52.246
But there's also people who are fully willing to come to your house, like,

46:53.860 --> 46:56.741
Really come to your house with their wife and daughter.

46:58.462 --> 46:59.882
That's how bad it is.

47:01.643 --> 47:05.764
They're willing to come to your house with their wife and daughter.

47:05.824 --> 47:09.985
And that's more than one person that I'm talking about here over the course of these five years.

47:10.025 --> 47:12.206
They're willing to come to your house from Japan.

47:15.227 --> 47:17.428
They're willing to stream with you and five other people.

47:19.888 --> 47:21.249
And then never share it with anyone.

47:22.159 --> 47:29.662
They're willing to have dinner and lunch with you, tell you how great you are, and then ignore you when it counts.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.825
It's not a fun message, ladies and gentlemen.

47:35.865 --> 47:36.946
I'm not enjoying this.

47:39.167 --> 47:50.432
Oftentimes I wonder when is the last time that I'm going to be allowed to present this data for what it is, where these are people that the overclass, they're placing them.

47:51.684 --> 47:57.687
And you can tell because these people are not capable of really explaining or understanding what actually happened.

47:57.727 --> 48:00.929
They are just fully in on the narrative.

48:01.049 --> 48:11.494
I mean, if I could explain to you the extent to which I don't think... Some of these things I'm not really ready to say yet.

48:12.854 --> 48:15.676
I don't want to burn all of the bridges, but...

48:16.497 --> 48:30.348
I really think it's important to understand that this graph reveals murder, not a novel virus, not a biological phenomenon, unless you count murder as a biological phenomenon, because this is not natural.

48:31.369 --> 48:39.676
The red in this graph represents pneumonia deaths, and you can clearly see that we've always had it under control, and we got it back under control at the end of 2022.

48:40.537 --> 48:42.098
So what happened here is murder.

48:46.055 --> 48:55.483
And so they placed us, they have been placing people, and in this particular case, they placed people all over the internet, told us to go home and solve the mystery on Twitter.

48:57.284 --> 49:12.136
Thank goodness Elon Musk saved the town square and renamed it X. And now these people don't wanna talk about 2020, they wanna talk about how bad the COVID shot is and how there's DNA in it and SV40 in it.

49:14.537 --> 49:19.899
and how this was a gain-of-function lab leak all along, says the New York Times, five years later.

49:22.220 --> 49:34.125
This is a highly orchestrated manipulation of the very mythology, the very narrative of American history that we will pass on to our children.

49:35.717 --> 49:41.778
that right now teachers are passing on to our children, that college professors are passing on to our college age kids.

49:42.238 --> 49:43.099
That's what's happening.

49:43.159 --> 50:00.062
Our college age adults, they're all inheriting an incorrect biological American history of the last five years because none of them understand the limitations of PCR and the difference between it being used as a diagnostic versus being used on an academic bench.

50:01.152 --> 50:07.136
None of them are able to understand the cold truth of pure oxygen being toxic.

50:09.118 --> 50:12.000
Otherwise, there'd still be oxygen bars now, wouldn't there, ladies?

50:13.161 --> 50:20.746
Not only, but this is the worst one for any budding MD or somebody who thinks they know what's going on.

50:20.887 --> 50:29.052
Understand that we were calling things a viral syndrome and justifying not using antibiotics on

50:30.057 --> 50:33.278
a urinary tract infection because it's a viral syndrome.

50:33.718 --> 50:36.759
Not using it on pneumonia because it's viral pneumonia.

50:36.819 --> 50:43.861
That is semantic, bold-faced labeling of murder.

50:44.382 --> 50:47.663
Anywhere where you find those words deployed like that, it's murder.

50:47.823 --> 50:48.303
It's easy.

50:49.887 --> 50:58.191
Any doctor that doesn't understand this or can't imagine or fathom this, you are wittingly or unwittingly a part of this.

50:58.251 --> 50:59.312
You are a murderer.

50:59.712 --> 51:01.673
You are guilty of manslaughter.

51:02.854 --> 51:07.136
And eventually, my grandkids are gonna consider you a criminal.

51:08.296 --> 51:10.357
That's the best case scenario for you.

51:10.838 --> 51:19.142
If they run out this clock on me, it's still gonna be my kids and their kids that are gonna know the truth about these people and how they did it.

51:19.955 --> 51:20.655
I assure you.

51:23.777 --> 51:25.497
It's murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

51:25.537 --> 51:26.638
It's murder and lies.

51:26.718 --> 51:28.739
That's why, you know, it's as simple as this.

51:29.639 --> 51:32.420
That, that describes what this picture is.

51:34.781 --> 51:37.843
And Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:37.923 --> 51:42.745
and Mary Holland and Pierre Cory and Jessica Rose and Brett Weinstein.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.326
And the list is endless.

51:44.366 --> 51:45.426
They're all lying about it.

51:46.505 --> 51:56.032
Some of them may have not have been sophisticated enough to understand it at some point, but they all know they're lying about it now because it's five years in.

51:56.052 --> 52:00.936
And because they've all met me.

52:03.598 --> 52:05.380
So they all know the truth about PCR.

52:05.420 --> 52:07.221
They all know the truth about ARDS.

52:07.261 --> 52:09.763
They all know the truth about antibiotics being a crime.

52:10.223 --> 52:14.207
They all know that this remnant stream is real.

52:16.121 --> 52:18.182
And they all know they were out there protecting it.

52:19.283 --> 52:26.908
They were out there protecting it with the absolutely ridiculously dumb objection that they're overcycling it.

52:31.411 --> 52:38.976
And it's a medical diagnostic that didn't need FDA approval and now just basically has approval because no one's gonna stand up for it.

52:39.076 --> 52:43.099
Marty McCarty is being inserted into the FDA

52:44.540 --> 52:54.047
And if you look on YouTube and find out what he was saying in 2020 and 2021, you can see it plain as day, just like Jay Bhattacharya is inserted into this narrative.

52:54.568 --> 52:57.910
These people will never question the foundational myth.

53:01.313 --> 53:11.100
And this will leave a medical diagnostic standard on the books in use in production, unregulated in perpetuity.

53:12.301 --> 53:15.583
provided by Timor's case scenario for the slavers, done.

53:16.643 --> 53:25.608
Just a bunch of happy little accidents that all these people have on video, and on direct message, and on voicemail saying how great I am, and all of them ignoring me now.

53:25.648 --> 53:41.216
But somehow, Sage Hana almost says everything, and Jessica says almost everything, except she says fraud instead of murder, and Jonathan Engler says there's no pandemic, but then can't explain what happened, because that would reveal that they're all part of this.

53:43.703 --> 53:49.870
Why not explain that there was a biologically expected, a anticipated rise in all-cause mortality?

53:50.290 --> 53:56.137
Because if they explained that, then they would also be admitting they understand why there was no epidemiological evidence of spread.

53:56.537 --> 54:05.087
It wouldn't be this thing that Denny Rancourt gets to go around the world for four years and pretend that he's the only one who understands this with his hundred-figure papers.

54:08.052 --> 54:21.950
But Denny Rancourt is another one of these people that should have done known that there was a huge signal in the population pyramid coming this decade, and that there was going to be a rise in all-cause mortality that can be seen in any slope of any picture that he's ever put in his graph.

54:22.531 --> 54:26.176
But they just kind of shrug their shoulders and say, who knows why it's rising so much?

54:31.161 --> 54:34.507
So yeah, I think Denny Rencor is a traitor to American kids.

54:35.409 --> 54:42.522
I think that he knows that there was an anticipated rise in expected deaths, and I think he wrote those papers in May 2020 and beyond to cover it up.

54:44.198 --> 55:12.342
I think he knows that that anticipated rise and expected deaths was sculpted using murder to create those peaks over there to create these peaks down here that they could call it was a myth of an of an RNA pandemic and Robert Malone and and and Steve Kirsch and all these long lifelong Democrats are now pseudo-conservatives pretending to be part of a Maha movement when all they did was do exactly what was necessary for the big picture the big global

55:13.092 --> 55:14.473
public health narrative.

55:18.615 --> 55:28.181
And you know, I can play this every day and you know, you can see it clear as day that there's a little bump there and that when that gets up here, there's going to be a lot more people dying.

55:30.082 --> 55:36.905
It's just an eclipse, ladies and gentlemen, that they told us that they were talking to God and God says that the sun can come back if you're good.

55:37.366 --> 55:41.128
And then when the sun came back, we assumed that our chiefs were all talking to God.

55:42.441 --> 55:51.627
Except in this scenario, the rise in all-cause mortality was blamed on a novel virus, when in reality, they all knew it was coming and they were all winking about it for more than a decade.

55:53.067 --> 55:55.309
Maybe even they winked about it behind Trump's back.

55:59.051 --> 56:01.593
Whoa, I almost choked.

56:02.994 --> 56:03.474
So that's it.

56:04.383 --> 56:05.403
That's it in a nutshell.

56:06.083 --> 56:13.405
An anticipated rise in expected deaths was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

56:13.445 --> 56:17.786
And Robert Malone and Merrill Nass have been in place for quite some time in order for this to work.

56:19.427 --> 56:22.367
Mary Holland was put in place in order for this to work.

56:22.427 --> 56:23.468
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:23.488 --> 56:24.748
was co-opted at some point.

56:24.788 --> 56:33.630
The World Health Mercury Project had to change its name because they had to be put in place so that it could be sculpted with murder and sophisticated liars.

56:36.069 --> 56:44.291
That's why Children's Health Defense doesn't talk about supplementary oxygen ventilators, lack of antibiotic use, poor use of steroids, remdesivir, midazolam.

56:44.311 --> 56:52.412
Don't forget, Robert Malone explained to us on Paul Cottrell's podcast in 2021 that the poor use of steroids, i.e.

56:52.452 --> 56:55.053
dexamethasone, could be a hammer for the immune system.

56:55.093 --> 57:00.974
You could get rid of all the symptoms so you could send old people back to old folks' homes and let them die.

57:03.151 --> 57:09.413
He laughed about it on a stream with Paul Cottrell, an associate of George Webb, the guy that he was suing.

57:10.733 --> 57:12.934
Honestly, ladies and gentlemen, these are criminals.

57:12.994 --> 57:13.894
They are traitors.

57:15.174 --> 57:28.338
And their track record of video statements on the internet reveals them as cooperative traders in this illusion where the opioid pandemic was allowed to go wild and blamed on other things because, you know, who cares about those people?

57:29.394 --> 57:34.696
where death certificate fraud occurred all over the place to the tune of $30,000 a pop.

57:36.377 --> 57:40.018
Financial incentives all throughout Warp Speed just ignored.

57:40.178 --> 57:44.120
Companies that came, that were doing tracks and trace are all gone now.

57:46.881 --> 57:50.902
All this track and trace mask closures, mandates, there was profit there.

57:50.962 --> 57:55.784
There were old iPads bought by all kinds of hospital, all this shit.

57:57.179 --> 58:11.705
And none of these people want to talk about it because they were all involved in this sculpting of the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, just a little bit, just a little bit to make it look sharp and we can point to it and model off of that slope.

58:13.286 --> 58:18.288
Nevermind the PCR fraud, the lateral flow test fraud, all of these products made in China.

58:19.908 --> 58:21.429
I mean, it's not even a joke, it's real.

58:23.112 --> 58:30.054
Some of these things were made by the collaborator of the Human Genome Project, the Beijing Genome BGI.

58:31.715 --> 58:33.355
Nevermind the sequencing fraud, right?

58:33.375 --> 58:35.056
That was all Ditra for two years.

58:36.296 --> 58:38.057
They just did it in-house.

58:38.237 --> 58:40.457
It's not like everybody was sequencing it on their bench.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.758
No, no, those swabs were all sent to some central location.

58:44.499 --> 58:51.781
I wonder why they would send all those swabs to a central location to sequence the virus.

58:56.908 --> 59:00.950
Yeah, anyway, this sculpting using murder, just how did they do it?

59:00.990 --> 59:10.635
Just imagine a team of performers with elaborate costumes and elaborate CVs where they say they have, you know, like five postdoctoral degrees.

59:12.976 --> 59:15.418
And they're all on the same script where they just ignore this.

59:16.818 --> 59:17.019
Right?

59:17.239 --> 59:20.120
They just ignore this incoming noise.

59:21.041 --> 59:21.541
It's nothing.

59:24.690 --> 59:24.890
Right?

59:24.970 --> 59:25.471
It's nothing.

59:25.851 --> 59:26.812
They just ignore this.

59:29.595 --> 59:41.087
With their surfer outfits on and their, you know, I'm a, I'm a vaccinologist and a bioethicist, or I'm a, I'm a country doctor from Maine.

59:41.147 --> 59:45.812
And I'm also a long time bioweapons expert because that makes sense.

59:50.694 --> 59:53.835
They're all one team, ladies and gentlemen.

59:53.875 --> 01:00:17.686
And just like this guy pretends that he has to stop the train and that he has to chalk up his hands and start pushing the train again, these people took an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and performed a very elaborate theater about a novel virus that we needed repurposed drugs for, that we should fight about those repurposed drugs.

01:00:17.726 --> 01:00:18.486
Which one's better?

01:00:21.513 --> 01:00:24.454
that it's a gain of function virus and these people are lying about it.

01:00:24.515 --> 01:00:39.582
And that elaborate theater was all on the background of a train that didn't need stopping, a train that was doing exactly what they expected it to do each time it came into the winter with just a little help.

01:00:46.325 --> 01:00:47.226
And that's these people.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:58.226
These people are responsible for the trap that we are in, on the right at least, on the populist right in America.

01:00:58.406 --> 01:01:01.507
These people are responsible for the trap that we are in.

01:01:02.028 --> 01:01:07.331
And only by recognizing their role in our bamboozlement can we escape.

01:01:13.513 --> 01:01:15.354
There is a document on my website.

01:01:15.374 --> 01:01:21.099
You can go to GigaOMBiological.com slash stuff and you can find this PDF and download it.

01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:26.623
McKinsey has explained very well that this population pyramid is a real problem.

01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:30.037
It's not depopulation, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:30.097 --> 01:01:32.740
Our populations are going to collapse.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.423
It is a mathematical certainty.

01:01:36.024 --> 01:01:37.886
They don't need to depopulate us.

01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:49.338
They already did that when they convinced us not to have as many kids, when they already convinced my brother that it would be better for the world if him and his wife didn't have kids and instead focused on their own careers.

01:01:53.018 --> 01:01:56.999
That is actually where we are, and they all know it.

01:01:57.059 --> 01:02:03.601
That's the reason why immigration has to happen, because our population pyramid is so tenuous right now.

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:09.803
What do we need schools for in 10 years if there are no little kids in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania?

01:02:17.554 --> 01:02:20.195
They've known this is coming for decades, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:20.215 --> 01:02:22.076
They've known this was coming for decades.

01:02:22.116 --> 01:02:23.696
It's not depopulation.

01:02:23.736 --> 01:02:30.019
It is an illusion of consensus about that because it disarms you from understanding what's really going on.

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:35.341
An inversion of your kid's sovereignty to experimental animal status.

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:46.745
You're too busy stuck in this maze where your consciousness is just wholly given away to the thoughts that they put there every time you hit the scroll.

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:49.256
Every time you hit play.

01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:59.160
And this Lollapalooza of liars is with military precision, with military software, are the people that are always in front of us.

01:03:00.121 --> 01:03:01.702
It's always the music in our ears.

01:03:02.442 --> 01:03:08.545
It's always the track laughter provided by these people that makes this sitcom run.

01:03:11.894 --> 01:03:26.479
It is the track laughter provided by these fake organizations like Brownstone, and CHD, and the World Council for Health, and Door to Freedom, and Independent Medical Alliance that used to be the FLCCC, this International Cove.

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:27.699
It's all these things.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.500
These are all a joke.

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:32.741
They're all sabotaged.

01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:41.204
And they've used this biological phenomenon, just like is depicted here, where this Mayan or Aztec

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:53.773
priest and his ruler are using a known and expected eclipse to fool their entire civilization into believing that they alone are in communication with God.

01:03:54.493 --> 01:04:00.054
They alone are able to control and manipulate the future, interact with their deity.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:16.240
And as powerful as this is, understand that this is no different than what Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Jessica Rose and Pierre Cory have all done.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:32.767
They have taken an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and manipulated our understanding of it to the extent to which we think they are, they are the people that understand a pandemic and what should have been done and what did happen.

01:04:35.267 --> 01:04:44.019
when in reality it was an expected event, an expected biological signal that they are distorting.

01:04:45.962 --> 01:04:51.810
To coerce us into teaching this mythology to our children, no different than these people are coercing

01:04:53.427 --> 01:04:57.669
these people at the base of the pyramid to believe that they are all powerful.

01:04:58.169 --> 01:04:59.010
It's coercion.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.891
They've been murdering people all day and dropping them down.

01:05:02.451 --> 01:05:06.773
And the gods have not responded until right now, as they said they would.

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:11.356
And now they can, they can say, well, what should we do now?

01:05:11.816 --> 01:05:13.957
Will the pandemic go away or not?

01:05:15.558 --> 01:05:19.640
And then they just stopped murdering people and the pandemic goes away.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.101
I guess we're done.

01:05:29.139 --> 01:05:31.040
And what happens when the sun comes back?

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.622
All of these people believe, just like when the pandemic ended, all of these people believed.

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:38.282
Well, there was a pandemic for sure.

01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:40.863
Cause you know, I, I had something strange.

01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:46.125
There was a pandemic for sure, because I know they closed down my school too.

01:05:47.266 --> 01:05:52.928
I mean, there was a pandemic because, because I saw it.

01:05:55.188 --> 01:05:58.912
That witch doctor is communicating with God, I just saw him do it!

01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:06.201
Those people were stopping the train, I saw him do it, he chalked up his hands.

01:06:07.462 --> 01:06:07.863
Just like...

01:06:08.874 --> 01:06:14.940
just like he chalked up his hands at January 25th, 2020 and said, you know what, it's a lab leak.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:25.191
And then went to work promoting Steven Hatfield's ideas, promoting Li Min Yan as a rebel and a anti-communist party chick and promoting Miles Gao.

01:06:30.196 --> 01:06:31.257
And now here we are with

01:06:32.276 --> 01:06:39.841
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Health and Human Services Secretary for the Trump administration, a longtime Democrat, a longtime Democrat, a longtime Democrat.

01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:45.464
I mean, traitor, traitor, liar, liar.

01:06:46.325 --> 01:06:53.869
But in the camp of advising this guy, I guarantee you that they have his ear.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.391
I guarantee you Robert Malone has his ear.

01:06:57.471 --> 01:06:59.032
Merrill Nass has his ear.

01:06:59.112 --> 01:07:00.633
Mary Holland has his ear.

01:07:00.693 --> 01:07:01.334
This guy

01:07:02.717 --> 01:07:04.658
is surrounded by traitors.

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:22.044
And I think this guy up here probably recycled the political show, the political game that was originally discovered by Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy in the UK around the year 2000 or 1999.

01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:30.829
where an anti-vax movement could be used to sway voters into voting for a particular candidate.

01:07:30.869 --> 01:07:36.953
He saw that, and saw that, and saw this, and this, and that, and the other, and the needs.

01:07:37.734 --> 01:07:39.195
He's a Goldman Sachs guy, right?

01:07:40.175 --> 01:07:41.296
He's not just some dude.

01:07:43.137 --> 01:07:44.118
He makes movies, you know.

01:07:49.369 --> 01:08:02.193
And so I think that these people were put in place on social media, put in place in front of us by Senator Ron Johnson to be like this group of heroes, where in reality they are creating an illusion of consensus, which is

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:11.096
reinforcing a limited spectrum of debate where our grandchildren will never be free, but in fact, the West will end.

01:08:11.576 --> 01:08:17.038
Just like Brett Weinstein said in that podcast, this could be the end of the West.

01:08:17.758 --> 01:08:20.579
I think his handlers have that in mind.

01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:27.821
They want to extract the remaining wealth of America and give it away to the highest bidder.

01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:28.701
That's what they're doing.

01:08:28.961 --> 01:08:31.282
And they have sold our sovereignty.

01:08:32.482 --> 01:08:34.243
And they'll do that by crashing the dollar.

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:48.599
Now the extraordinary thing is, is that not only do all these people know me, a lot of them have talked to me for years and now ignore me, but they've all gone around the world together saying the same bullshit for five years.

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:56.611
And that's how you can see that this is a conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits and opinions by these people.

01:08:57.151 --> 01:09:03.353
The intellectual dark web is kind of like the children's story version of it.

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:05.594
It's much more malevolent than that.

01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:16.777
And I think that Noam Chomsky has always been telling us the truth for his overlords or his handlers or the overclass.

01:09:16.837 --> 01:09:18.018
That's what he's always done.

01:09:18.851 --> 01:09:25.900
He's always been telling us how it will be done and what they are doing so that we kind of feel helpless and just go along with it.

01:09:29.945 --> 01:09:31.847
And the reality is these are the people that did it.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.429
These are the ones right here.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.151
This Lollapalooza of liars.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.855
This is your starting lineup for Team Worst Case Scenario.

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:43.023
They took an expected rise in all-cause mortality and lied about it.

01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:44.784
That's what I know for sure.

01:09:44.844 --> 01:09:46.626
For five years, these people have been lying.

01:09:59.354 --> 01:10:03.597
And so again, just to remind you, this is really supported only by viewers like you.

01:10:03.717 --> 01:10:06.078
Jeff from Earth just gave another huge

01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:17.199
stream-sustaining donation, but you know, it would be great if we could figure out a way to do this a little bit more militantly.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:25.104
If somebody has $100,000, they want to donate to crushing this fake populist health freedom movement.

01:10:25.325 --> 01:10:27.586
I think Ego and Biological might be a place to put it.

01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:37.492
And in a month or so, I think we might have the paperwork done for a non-profit, which will have a very specific set of goals, including producing a

01:10:38.533 --> 01:10:53.671
a freshman in college, senior in high school level biology course that in a couple weeks somebody can succinctly find themselves understanding the illusion of public health and how it was foisted upon us by the same actors over the last 20 years.

01:10:54.472 --> 01:11:04.461
I think it's a really important thing to understand this Lollapalooza of liars and what it really means to be about all the children or the grandchildren of Earth.

01:11:05.042 --> 01:11:06.663
It's a change in time horizon.

01:11:06.703 --> 01:11:15.031
If you're always on social media, you're thinking in weeks and you got to really think in generations to see what these people have done and what they are thinking about.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.375
And you have to see it as an international collaboration.

01:11:19.455 --> 01:11:20.155
The American

01:11:21.096 --> 01:11:32.564
ideal is being destroyed from within and from without by a coordinated group of liars that have taken advantage of this to undermine our understanding.

01:11:32.605 --> 01:11:35.246
And nobody is in place by accident.

01:11:35.286 --> 01:11:40.070
I mean, it's in 2013, these two guys are not on CNN by accident.

01:11:41.448 --> 01:11:59.842
And if you start to see it on this time horizon and realize that in 2015 we had Paul Offit and Mary Holland on Democracy Now!, and that 10 years later it's still Paul Offit versus Mary Holland, that is because it is for all the marbles and none of these people are in front of us by chance.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:17.237
if you understand that you know that trump's not doing though is he wants to keep that that you just saw paul off it's selling the book of children's health defense actually the video that he just put out today also puts that book right in front the fauci book sells it for them

01:12:18.477 --> 01:12:22.698
It's the same as admitting now that the view is like, oh wow, Steve Bannon said that?

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:23.939
Steve Bannon is so cool.

01:12:24.319 --> 01:12:25.639
Wow, Steve Bannon is great.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:31.781
Steve Bannon is going to be in front of us now also on Gavin Newsom's podcast for the love of goodness.

01:12:31.841 --> 01:12:34.962
That's because no one is in front of us by chance.

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:37.303
We are being manipulated into believing

01:12:38.603 --> 01:12:40.565
something that is definitely untrue.

01:12:40.645 --> 01:13:04.560
And that goes all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic, and it's not even the beginning, if you think February 2021, where a bunch of fake dissidents, part of the team worst case scenario, were put out and put in place with a narrative that would not successfully, and it was intentional, it would not be successful in challenging the pandemic narrative.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.862
It would essentially put people out of play.

01:13:08.194 --> 01:13:13.996
And these same people pretty much show up in every podcast for the next five years.

01:13:14.976 --> 01:13:20.838
Steve Kirsch's podcast, the Tommy podcast, all this nonsense pushing their very limited spectrum of debate.

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:25.240
That's why none of these no virus people have ever been able to say murder.

01:13:26.806 --> 01:13:39.376
That's why none of these no-virus people have ever really interacted with Jessica Rose or with Kevin McKernan or with Robert Malone to say that all these people are just pushing virology and they're all fake.

01:13:40.177 --> 01:13:42.439
Instead, they got together to say that about me.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:47.783
Instead, McCarran has said that about me countless times in the last five years while ignoring them.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:14:02.657
And that is because it is all one malevolent show that was started in the beginning of 2020 or a little bit before, and the people that were put in place to be key players were put in place even years earlier, like Bret Weinstein.

01:14:03.518 --> 01:14:07.081
And that is because this is for all the marbles.

01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:13.668
That's why he got a grant then, but then, you know, his track record really suggests that he's kind of a creep.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:26.505
because now he's collaborating with Steve Kirsch and these people all, and it is all just one big show because Kevin McKernan was on my stream already years and years ago.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:32.307
And in fact, today is the anniversary, the two year anniversary of the March 17th, 2023,

01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:39.475
St.

01:14:39.515 --> 01:14:46.817
Patrick's Day presentation where Jessica Rose says, wow, you know, your presentation to Paul was so amazing.

01:14:47.257 --> 01:14:48.398
It kept me up at night.

01:14:49.758 --> 01:15:01.242
Yes, that was actually two full years ago when I explained to them how infectious clones could be used to create the illusion of a pandemic on a hot background.

01:15:01.782 --> 01:15:08.704
And Kevin McKernan and Stephanie Seneff and John Bodwin and Jessica Rose listened intently and agreed, wow.

01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:12.543
Yes, two years ago.

01:15:12.743 --> 01:15:14.144
There's only one way to see it.

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:14.904
They're traitors.

01:15:17.545 --> 01:15:21.247
That's why Northrup was on his stream, not even a couple of weeks ago.

01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:24.928
She was seeded in the narrative the same as any of these other people.

01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:30.010
That's why Stephanie Seneff was on Kevin McCairn's stream in 2024.

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.830
This is one show.

01:15:33.035 --> 01:15:41.040
That's why McCairn and McKernan were promoted on the LifeSite News all at the same time about pre-ons with a video of both of them.

01:15:42.161 --> 01:15:57.411
Because it's one malevolent show that includes the no-virus people like Tom Cowan with a book, and Andrew Kaufman with a book, but also Kevin McCairn, who knew that these were the bad guys in 2020, and Kevin McKernan, who

01:15:57.871 --> 01:16:00.654
who of course knew that PCR worked from the very beginning.

01:16:01.115 --> 01:16:07.141
Can this whole promotion, these things don't happen by accident, okay?

01:16:07.482 --> 01:16:13.128
That's the same reason why in October 2020, this guy was telling you not to pay attention to who?

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.891
Andrew Kaufman.

01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:18.634
Isn't that interesting?

01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:29.519
And what's even more interesting is that in just a few months later in 2021, there would be another guy with a million subscribers that would be talking about Andy Kaufman.

01:16:30.578 --> 01:16:33.220
because it's all one malevolent show.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:40.727
They're given parts of the script to promote different aspects of or different members of team Worst Case Scenario.

01:16:41.148 --> 01:16:48.594
And independent of who you choose to cheer for or who you chose to root for, none of them will ever question each other.

01:16:48.654 --> 01:16:54.800
That's why the NoVirus people and all these smarties have never gotten together to say that Jessica Rose is obviously fake.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.705
because she worked on HIV in her postdocs, because she worked on virology models in her postdoc.

01:17:01.186 --> 01:17:10.894
Why won't these people who are skeptical of the HIV biology ever mention that Jessica Rose was an HIV virologist for her PhD?

01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:18.090
It's because they are all on the same team, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:19.751
They are all part of this.

01:17:20.071 --> 01:17:22.092
That's why they will not question her.

01:17:22.152 --> 01:17:24.114
That's why they have never questioned her.

01:17:24.154 --> 01:17:34.400
But instead, they all coordinate together to curate a very lively debate within that very limited spectrum.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:46.653
I want you to challenge yourself to go to Peggy Hall's YouTube channel and find out when she started making videos and what she made them about.

01:17:48.934 --> 01:17:55.538
I want you to challenge yourself to go in the back and see what Nicholas Hushner was doing in 2020 and 2021.

01:17:55.578 --> 01:17:56.378
What was Dr. Drew doing in 2020 and 2021?

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:57.019
Find out where their

01:18:04.503 --> 01:18:08.168
their earliest video where the Weinsteins we know.

01:18:08.468 --> 01:18:10.370
But what about Julian Michaels?

01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:11.091
What about her?

01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:11.992
What was she doing in 2020?

01:18:12.112 --> 01:18:15.957
When was her first contact with the pandemic and virology?

01:18:16.437 --> 01:18:20.943
Because if you find these answers yourself, they'll be much more convincing as evidence.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:36.115
None of these people that are currently in front of us getting massively promoted, getting very lucrative substacks or taking over other people's lucrative substacks, none of these people are in place by accident.

01:18:36.195 --> 01:18:47.482
And if you were to just dare to go look at 2020 or 2019 or 2021 to find out what any of these traders were doing, you would find the answers that I found.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:57.399
And it wouldn't be so hard for you to understand why I can't stop doing this particular stream with this particular message.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:07.188
Because we are under the spell of these people that have fooled us into this mystery solving exercise and we have come to accept their monsters as a result.

01:19:07.348 --> 01:19:09.470
I know because I accepted them.

01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:10.772
I was part of it.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.321
And my track record is not flawless.

01:19:15.421 --> 01:19:18.224
It's just got integrity from beginning to end.

01:19:18.284 --> 01:19:22.749
And now all of these people, for some reason, are claiming integrity from beginning to end.

01:19:22.789 --> 01:19:29.436
It is hysterical how much of our wording and how much of our work is being absorbed by these people.

01:19:52.011 --> 01:20:00.155
Brandy Vaughn has billboards in 2016, and unfortunately, these people are all activated then.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:08.459
They all start their appearance there, and in fact, what I'm suggesting to you is, is not very fun to suggest, but I'm gonna suggest it anyway.

01:20:08.999 --> 01:20:14.042
These people have been standing in front of Brandy Vaughn for several years in preparation for the pandemic.

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:27.219
They have been put in position to be the messengers and that is the explanation for why all of these people in this picture are promoting each other and not brandy at the start of the pandemic.

01:20:27.279 --> 01:20:36.382
That's why that guy right there has this book and is saying exactly what this book says in this video.

01:20:37.386 --> 01:20:39.607
This book was published in 2016.

01:20:40.128 --> 01:20:46.792
With the environmental and genetic causes of autism, no real commitment to the idea that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:20:46.892 --> 01:20:51.175
Of course not, because these people are all interested in saving the vaccine schedule.

01:20:52.062 --> 01:20:58.087
This guy who has a book with them as well, here he is promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:58.107 --> 01:20:59.548
in 2017 already.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:11.378
It's not by accident that these people with a delayed vaccine schedule or something like that are the ones that are promoted because there is no desire to tell our kids the truth.

01:21:13.885 --> 01:21:21.146
That's also the reason why Stephanie Seneff is out there saying, oh my goodness, everybody's gonna be autistic in another generation, and it must be glyphosate.

01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:26.747
You know, the same thing that Robert Malone just blamed autism on about a week ago in his sub stack.

01:21:26.947 --> 01:21:27.967
Yes, that is correct.

01:21:28.547 --> 01:21:36.369
Robert Malone said that it was glyphosate that was causing autism.

01:21:36.409 --> 01:21:38.529
What you need to understand is this.

01:21:38.549 --> 01:21:43.310
Well, make no mistake that the other side, without a doubt,

01:21:44.005 --> 01:21:50.606
do not want the public, the people, the parents to hear the stories of the unvaccinated.

01:21:50.626 --> 01:21:55.467
They want us to talk about MMR, autism, Andrew Wakefield.

01:21:55.487 --> 01:21:59.728
They want that to go down the same path every single time because they can attack us.

01:22:00.088 --> 01:22:07.349
But you cannot attack the generations and generations of the health of the unvaccinated.

01:22:08.109 --> 01:22:11.790
Vax2 doesn't even begin to cover the health of the unvaccinated.

01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.310
We uncovered so much

01:22:13.851 --> 01:22:20.052
We uncovered generations and generations standing there saying, we've never had any cancer in our family.

01:22:20.532 --> 01:22:23.173
We've never had rheumatoid arthritis in our family.

01:22:23.393 --> 01:22:24.573
We've never had diabetes.

01:22:24.593 --> 01:22:30.014
We've never had any of these things that you see that are just common elderly conditions.

01:22:30.574 --> 01:22:33.415
They don't have them in their families.

01:22:33.895 --> 01:22:43.117
And as we went deeper and deeper into the world of the unvaccinated, I could see, the team could see, this is why they don't do the vaccine back study.

01:22:43.664 --> 01:22:47.069
This is why they're trying to censor us and stop us.

01:22:48.993 --> 01:22:50.114
think I'm making this up.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.495
She doesn't say that anymore.

01:22:51.535 --> 01:22:54.297
Of course, since the start of the pandemic, it's all about mandates.

01:22:54.377 --> 01:22:59.420
This is the green book that supposedly eventually they published the backs on backs book.

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.241
Let's read what it says inside the cover.

01:23:01.922 --> 01:23:08.046
This book is based on over 100 studies in peer reviewed literature that consider vaccinated versus unvaccinated population.

01:23:08.106 --> 01:23:16.551
Each study is analyzed and health differences among infants, children's and adults who have been vaccinated in those who have not are presented and put in context.

01:23:16.671 --> 01:23:18.553
Readers will find information on,

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:35.322
The Infant Childhood Vaccine Schedule, Thimerosal and Vaccines, Live Virus Vaccines, Human Papillomavirus Vaccine, Vaccination and Gulf War Illness, Human Influenza Vaccines, Hepatitis B Vaccination, The COVID-19 Vaccine and Vaccines During Pregnancy.

01:23:35.382 --> 01:23:44.167
Given the massive push to vaccinate the entire global population, this book is timely and necessary for individuals to make informed choices for themselves and their families.

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:45.528
So what's the message of the book?

01:23:47.813 --> 01:23:49.374
Is intramuscular injection dumb?

01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:58.921
Have they been lying to us about their ability to high fidelity augment children's immune system at birth with a hepatitis B?

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:08.167
What in the nine hells is this book in 2023 if intramuscular injection is dumb?

01:24:09.028 --> 01:24:09.188
Well,

01:24:12.287 --> 01:24:19.368
or that the unvaccinated people are so much healthier until they're very, very old, like what Polly just said there.

01:24:19.408 --> 01:24:21.869
That's not the message of this book either, apparently.

01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:23.609
Can you see it yet?

01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:28.070
Would it surprise you that Brian Hooker used to work for the Department of Energy?

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:36.652
That's just conveniently left off of his CV on the CHD website.

01:24:37.722 --> 01:24:47.264
The Department of Energy is the same department that funds nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants, and the Human Genome Project.

01:24:54.726 --> 01:25:03.468
Petrified of these people talking, speaking out, because when the world knows about the health of the unvaccinated, game over, they're done.

01:25:05.029 --> 01:25:05.529
They're done.

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:17.159
And so that's why, of course, this guy had to be in place at the beginning of the pandemic, talking about a fear and cleavage site, talking about the lab leak already.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.243
In place with a book.

01:25:23.804 --> 01:25:35.894
That's why our now Health and Human Services Secretary went in his own house on a podcast to explain why Judy Mikovits is a hero, not Brandy Vaughn.

01:25:36.889 --> 01:25:46.176
But Judy Mikovits, the one that was advocating for us to be vaccinated against the XMRV virus so that the vaccine schedule would be safe.

01:25:50.819 --> 01:25:56.564
The one who claimed to have solved chronic fatigue syndrome because she found a mouse virus contaminating vaccines.

01:25:57.044 --> 01:25:59.666
So vaccines could be safe if you just listened to her.

01:26:07.847 --> 01:26:09.849
There is nobody on our team.

01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:12.052
There's nobody coming to our rescue.

01:26:14.034 --> 01:26:15.235
We're Americans.

01:26:15.255 --> 01:26:16.476
We're only 4% of the world.

01:26:16.637 --> 01:26:28.549
That's the reason why this new clown is arguing with this old clown and why somebody in the UK is telling us all about how great they are, how great the Cali means is.

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:34.312
This guy who also says that John Campbell's great.

01:26:34.372 --> 01:26:42.077
These are all UK meddlers that allowed murder to happen in their own country and is still not speaking up about it now.

01:26:43.437 --> 01:26:46.599
These are paid meddlers on our social media platforms.

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:51.882
Nobody is there by chance with 150,000 subscribers, nevermind a million.

01:26:51.982 --> 01:26:53.443
Nobody is there by chance.

01:26:54.969 --> 01:26:55.969
It is an investment.

01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:57.850
People invested in those people.

01:26:58.150 --> 01:26:59.611
People started businesses.

01:27:00.932 --> 01:27:03.213
This is spontaneous.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:08.755
My finding myself in this book is spontaneous.

01:27:08.815 --> 01:27:09.915
It's a huge mistake.

01:27:11.596 --> 01:27:12.777
It's not supposed to be there.

01:27:12.817 --> 01:27:13.597
I'm convinced of it.

01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:17.004
These people were unsuccessful.

01:27:17.464 --> 01:27:20.466
That's why Jessica Hockett only started messing with me in August of 2023.

01:27:21.086 --> 01:27:23.187
That's why they only wrote their thing in 2024.

01:27:24.168 --> 01:27:25.849
That's why this thing kept repeating.

01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:41.857
After I did it all for the Wuhan coverup book, I had to do it for another year for these chumps, only to result in the same bullshit where they kind of absorb everything that I'm talking about, but not really, and kind of pretend to cite me, but not really.

01:27:41.917 --> 01:27:43.858
Instead, they cited Vinay Prasad.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.001
who I can show you with his timeline is an incredibly big joke.

01:27:51.262 --> 01:27:59.884
But I think I wanna stay focused on this and this illusion that's being created right now, this illusion of a very lively debate within this limited spectrum.

01:28:00.304 --> 01:28:12.227
And very specifically, I wanna remind you that right now down there in the corner, is Brett Weinstein and his wife talking about mRNA vaccines in 2025 and it's an absolute joke because of this.

01:28:12.907 --> 01:28:13.927
this timeline.

01:28:13.967 --> 01:28:19.489
Now, in this timeline in particular is a little pink area up there that's also coded here by these names.

01:28:20.049 --> 01:28:27.151
I was in a signal chat with Brett Weinstein and these other traders for about half a year or three quarters of a year.

01:28:27.571 --> 01:28:35.434
It includes Matthew Crawford and Chris Martinson and Heather Haying and Brett Weinstein and Alexandros Marinos.

01:28:36.894 --> 01:28:39.455
I think he might be dating Elon Musk.

01:28:40.135 --> 01:28:52.079
then Jumi Kim and so the one that I want to focus on right now is Chris Martinson because again This is just easy pickings I've had Chris Martinson on my list for a very long time.

01:28:52.139 --> 01:28:54.020
I've been not really saying his name.

01:28:54.060 --> 01:29:03.003
I don't have his picture yet in there But I have shown you a video at the beginning of this one where he's involved in a Kevin McKernan Steve Kirsch

01:29:05.526 --> 01:29:12.088
Chris Martenson and Byron Bridle stream where the three of them are coordinatedly bamboozling Byron Bridle.

01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:21.112
Well, I would suggest to you that Chris Martenson is somebody that was also co-opted at the beginning of the pandemic, maybe even before was already playing for these people.

01:29:21.152 --> 01:29:23.772
And you can see it very clearly on his YouTube channel.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:30.975
You can just see where the thumbnails change and where he decides that, oh my gosh, I guess I have to start talking about the pandemic.

01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:33.691
And I already know what's going on.

01:29:33.771 --> 01:29:36.393
I'm already pretty aware of what's going on.

01:29:36.453 --> 01:29:42.598
Now, remember this guy was in a signal chat group with me two years after the video that I'm about to play.

01:29:45.322 --> 01:29:46.923
So let's go back to 2020.

01:29:47.563 --> 01:29:51.665
Remember, when we go back to 2020, with all these people, you're gonna see they're traitors.

01:29:51.725 --> 01:30:08.531
If you go back with Drew, or with Hulshner, or with Michaels, or with Sam Seder, or with the fluoride lady, or you go back with Peggy Hall, you're not gonna find people that were doubting the biological narrative.

01:30:08.731 --> 01:30:12.173
You were gonna find people that were up in arms about it, reinforcing it.

01:30:12.914 --> 01:30:15.394
making sure people complied with believing in it.

01:30:17.884 --> 01:30:22.507
And I am going to do all that work, but just telling you, if you wanted to, you could do that work for you.

01:30:22.527 --> 01:30:23.448
And it's really easy.

01:30:23.468 --> 01:30:25.529
You get really big results really fast.

01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:38.678
So to remind you, kind of simplify it again, the pandemic started in 2020, and it wasn't until the end of 2021 that I was finally invited to be in a Signal Chat group with these meddlers that include Chris Martinson.

01:30:38.718 --> 01:30:46.943
And so I'm going to go back to the earliest video that Chris Martinson of Peace Prosperity put out about the coronavirus and when it was.

01:30:47.104 --> 01:30:47.564
Let's see.

01:30:48.364 --> 01:31:05.033
I guess it was I guess it was I'm gonna move this down a little bit so you can see it better it was January 24th 2020 one day before

01:31:13.576 --> 01:31:28.094
Steve Bannon would declare a lab leak on his war room one day before, and two days before Paul Cottrell would say it was a lab leak, the hero doctor from the George Webb Group.

01:31:30.697 --> 01:31:35.342
So this guy, this is his very first coronavirus stream.

01:31:35.502 --> 01:31:43.390
And before the coronavirus starts, Chris Martinson is almost exclusively doing interviews, some of which are only audio, they're not even video.

01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:47.214
And then suddenly at the beginning of the pandemic, he doesn't need to do interviews anymore.

01:31:47.714 --> 01:31:53.961
He just needs to tell you what he's been scripted to tell you, which is a very notable change in his programming.

01:31:56.792 --> 01:31:57.953
Good morning, everyone.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.373
Hey, Chris Martenson here.

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:02.074
I just wanted to share a little bit of my experience with you here.

01:32:02.134 --> 01:32:03.555
It's January 24th.

01:32:03.595 --> 01:32:04.395
That would be Friday.

01:32:04.975 --> 01:32:16.640
It's about 730 in the morning, and I just spent a good chunk of my morning looking through the absolutely unbelievable pandemic virus stories coming out of China.

01:32:17.181 --> 01:32:19.381
And of course, there's a real clamp on information there.

01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:21.442
But with social media, we can see that it's pretty bad.

01:32:21.482 --> 01:32:25.184
It's pretty desperate and that this virus checks all the boxes.

01:32:27.219 --> 01:32:30.201
Right away you hear Chris Martinson telling you what?

01:32:30.321 --> 01:32:33.403
That social media is revealing the coverup.

01:32:34.324 --> 01:32:36.805
You see, this is part of the trap, right?

01:32:36.825 --> 01:32:40.688
He's suggesting to you that the mystery is being broken.

01:32:40.808 --> 01:32:43.729
The truth is being revealed on social media.

01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:46.671
That is absolutely ridiculous.

01:32:47.612 --> 01:32:55.397
That is not true at all, but that's what also Kevin McKernan said in the beginning of the pandemic, that the truth is being revealed on Twitter.

01:32:56.550 --> 01:33:08.595
That's what Robert Malone said, that the new kinds of Gab and Telegram and LinkedIn was censoring him, so they went to other social media where the truth could be revealed.

01:33:10.456 --> 01:33:12.197
Again, just see it for what it is.

01:33:12.237 --> 01:33:21.101
These people, they coerced us into accepting this narrative that there was some cover-up happening in mainstream media and that

01:33:22.196 --> 01:33:27.699
military programs that we've been induced to calling social media was the place where the truth would be revealed.

01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:46.530
For being a pandemic candidate, and it's getting all over the world, and the response of my government in the United States, but also elsewhere in the world, is to just sort of shrug and say, well, you know, if people are coming in from wherever, what we're going to do is we'll scan their foreheads with a temperature reader.

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:49.772
And of course, this is useless because this virus has a five

01:33:50.236 --> 01:33:51.898
day incubation period.

01:33:52.479 --> 01:33:54.962
A five day incubation period.

01:33:55.002 --> 01:33:58.667
So it's useless to test people's temperature at airports.

01:33:59.308 --> 01:34:02.272
They're just going to get through with asymptomatic conditions.

01:34:02.332 --> 01:34:07.398
So there's the first on narrative before anybody else on the 24th of January.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:19.149
he's already certain that there is a significant asymptomatic spread window that we need to be worried about, and in fact will result in something tragic.

01:34:19.849 --> 01:34:20.370
At a minimum.

01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:28.717
So that means you can be infected, be completely asymptomatic, not have any symptoms yourself that you're aware of, no aches, no runny nose, nothing like that, and no fever.

01:34:29.298 --> 01:34:30.960
but still be fully infected.

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:35.986
And so of course- Now remember, before the pandemic, he's actually concerned about the collapse of the Fed.

01:34:36.066 --> 01:34:43.034
He's actually concerned about gold and gold prices and the artificial, you know, keeping down of gold.

01:34:43.394 --> 01:34:46.398
He's concerned about all kinds of things financial.

01:34:47.921 --> 01:34:53.546
not biological, he's not worried about the vaccine schedule, not even worried about the MMR shot.

01:34:53.606 --> 01:34:59.791
He's really only working on gold and money and investment.

01:35:00.011 --> 01:35:09.639
And so it's a very strange pivot to come in here now already understanding how a viral respiratory disease would work and how it spreads and some of the details about it.

01:35:09.679 --> 01:35:14.983
But as he said at the beginning of the video, he spent the first four hours of this morning reading.

01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:17.425
And so now he totally understands what's going on.

01:35:17.765 --> 01:35:19.926
These scans that they're doing at the airport are stupid.

01:35:19.946 --> 01:35:22.487
So you'd think, though, that this would be top news.

01:35:22.627 --> 01:35:27.710
A pandemic is like one of the most amazingly destructive things that could possibly happen.

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.250
It could harm.

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:39.475
A pandemic is one of the most amazingly destructive things that could happen, says Chris Martinson, expert on gold and the Fed life and limb.

01:35:39.495 --> 01:35:40.235
So let's see.

01:35:40.736 --> 01:35:44.377
Let's take a quick tour through the news here in the United States and see how we're doing.

01:35:44.397 --> 01:35:45.878
So I'm just scrolling here through.

01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:48.823
a standard Internet Explorer browser.

01:35:48.863 --> 01:35:50.203
This is the main news feed that comes up.

01:35:50.223 --> 01:35:50.503
Let's see.

01:35:51.203 --> 01:35:53.344
Well, I guess we got a 15-year-old.

01:35:53.464 --> 01:35:56.225
It's going to upset something about the Australian Open.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:58.045
That's an ad.

01:35:58.625 --> 01:35:58.925
Let's see.

01:35:59.005 --> 01:35:59.586
An explosion.

01:35:59.866 --> 01:36:00.026
Yep.

01:36:00.186 --> 01:36:00.466
Okay.

01:36:00.566 --> 01:36:01.406
Explosion in Houston.

01:36:01.446 --> 01:36:03.127
Some random explosion in one city.

01:36:03.227 --> 01:36:03.387
Yep.

01:36:03.567 --> 01:36:04.607
Got to put that right near the top.

01:36:05.393 --> 01:36:09.714
Another ad, shocking moments at the Grammy Awards.

01:36:09.854 --> 01:36:10.634
Yeah, I got shocked.

01:36:10.674 --> 01:36:24.838
So on January 24th, 2020, Chris Martinson is already aware that there is a media blackout on coronavirus and pandemic news, even though he knows that pandemics can be like the worst thing ever.

01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:26.438
Shopping.

01:36:26.838 --> 01:36:28.138
Yep, you could look at shopping.

01:36:28.198 --> 01:36:29.119
Come on, where's this virus?

01:36:29.139 --> 01:36:29.359
Let's see.

01:36:30.934 --> 01:36:34.556
Trump, something about Trump here, something about Brady, another ad.

01:36:35.237 --> 01:36:37.078
Flirting, is that the secret to a happy marriage?

01:36:37.378 --> 01:36:39.119
Hey, this is good news.

01:36:39.239 --> 01:36:39.579
U.S.

01:36:39.659 --> 01:36:42.281
futures point to slightly higher open on Wall Street.

01:36:42.681 --> 01:36:51.007
That's been happening every day for months and months as the Federal Reserve seeks to make the wealthy wealthier and to cut everybody else out from the American dream.

01:36:51.427 --> 01:36:51.887
Love that.

01:36:51.967 --> 01:36:54.249
Thank you CNBC for letting us know that that's happening again.

01:36:55.289 --> 01:36:56.550
That doesn't seem important.

01:36:57.358 --> 01:37:02.741
Al Capone's car, I mean, moderate, mildly interesting, but really not important compared to a pandemic.

01:37:03.562 --> 01:37:07.124
Let's see, stuck indoors, keep your dog entertained on a snowy or rainy day.

01:37:08.965 --> 01:37:09.906
Not really important.

01:37:10.486 --> 01:37:12.628
Some guy turns himself in, I don't know.

01:37:12.908 --> 01:37:14.869
Yes, people died, musicians, I guess.

01:37:15.069 --> 01:37:18.531
Oh, Kamala Harris said to be weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden.

01:37:18.551 --> 01:37:21.413
Wow, that's an irrelevant, meeting irrelevant.

01:37:21.453 --> 01:37:22.474
That's irrelevant squared.

01:37:23.534 --> 01:37:24.174
Uh, yeah.

01:37:24.274 --> 01:37:27.135
Megan and Harry's mansion, uh, all-star come on.

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:30.176
We're banks handing out beefed up credit lines.

01:37:30.697 --> 01:37:31.857
No one asked for God.

01:37:32.457 --> 01:37:33.577
Oh, this is dystopian.

01:37:33.758 --> 01:37:34.418
That's right there.

01:37:34.438 --> 01:37:35.938
A boring dystopia right there.

01:37:35.978 --> 01:37:41.800
Toddler's playroom includes capitalist, uh, logos and things like that.

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.701
That's fantastic.

01:37:42.781 --> 01:37:43.741
Get out of here with that.

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:44.401
Uh, let's see.

01:37:44.521 --> 01:37:44.821
Come on.

01:37:44.841 --> 01:37:46.222
Where's, where's the virus news?

01:37:46.842 --> 01:37:47.722
Um, nope.

01:37:48.222 --> 01:37:48.583
Brad Pitt.

01:37:48.643 --> 01:37:48.823
Nope.

01:37:49.543 --> 01:37:49.743
Nope.

01:37:50.123 --> 01:37:50.343
Ads.

01:37:50.783 --> 01:37:52.664
Um, Warren slams Bloomberg for,

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:53.421
No.

01:37:54.424 --> 01:37:55.988
Most important Grammy nominees.

01:37:56.108 --> 01:37:56.730
No, I'm not.

01:37:56.991 --> 01:37:57.492
Come on!

01:37:59.438 --> 01:38:00.902
Banned cashless stores and restaurants.

01:38:01.002 --> 01:38:01.122
No.

01:38:01.901 --> 01:38:12.364
There's another ad voices my time with the British Jesus two stories about the British aristocracy again Irrelevant squared what could possibly be less relevant to my life than the British?

01:38:12.704 --> 01:38:20.466
Aristocracy nothing except for maybe Kamala Harris endorsing Joe Biden both Just just just absolutely nothing to do with my life.

01:38:20.987 --> 01:38:22.207
There's a pandemic coming.

01:38:22.427 --> 01:38:22.687
Okay.

01:38:22.707 --> 01:38:25.668
Here's really an ad disguised as an article and

01:38:26.058 --> 01:38:27.158
Fidget spinners, great.

01:38:27.438 --> 01:38:29.399
There is a pandemic coming.

01:38:29.479 --> 01:38:32.439
So keep in mind, that is something he knows.

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:40.201
He knows, he's certain, and he's gonna explain how certain he is on January 24th, 2020.

01:38:40.261 --> 01:38:42.442
Come on, people.

01:38:42.862 --> 01:38:45.142
Las Vegas changes what happens.

01:38:45.162 --> 01:38:47.123
Your slogan, that's important, I guess, for some people.

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:50.483
Results, another ad.

01:38:51.543 --> 01:38:53.964
What does 2020 hold for Tiger again?

01:38:54.727 --> 01:38:56.369
completely irrelevant to my daily life.

01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:58.931
Meet the Grammy nominee.

01:38:58.951 --> 01:39:03.075
A lot of Grammy stuff, so somebody's really paying for a bunch of Grammy stuff to come out here.

01:39:03.315 --> 01:39:09.060
So it wasn't always bad news, but now that it's a coronavirus cover-up, it's all irrelevant news.

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.161
You see how silly that is?

01:39:10.181 --> 01:39:11.883
It was always irrelevant news.

01:39:11.923 --> 01:39:14.605
They always put irrelevant things in his news feed.

01:39:14.625 --> 01:39:16.047
He doesn't have his news feed from

01:39:16.707 --> 01:39:20.613
three days ago where he shows all kinds of stuff being there and then it being cut out.

01:39:20.673 --> 01:39:21.113
Do you see?

01:39:21.554 --> 01:39:22.695
This is all bullshit.

01:39:22.816 --> 01:39:33.530
This is a bullshit posturing stream to start a five-year posturing stance about a lab leak virus that doesn't exist.

01:39:34.562 --> 01:39:43.228
about a whole biological mythology that they would like to pass on to our kids, that these guys are employed, are employed to pass on to our kids.

01:39:43.808 --> 01:39:47.291
Ladies and gentlemen, these are traitors to our grandkids.

01:39:49.532 --> 01:39:56.917
Ah, finally, how China's coronavirus outbreak could threaten the global economy.

01:39:57.898 --> 01:39:58.498
Are you kidding me?

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.120
Are you kidding me?

01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:02.561
That's it?

01:40:03.842 --> 01:40:03.962
Yep.

01:40:04.775 --> 01:40:05.055
That's it.

01:40:05.436 --> 01:40:16.407
That's the only take that the United States press, mainstream press, the people who have been absolutely falling down on the job and failing to bring you the news that you need and deserve.

01:40:17.247 --> 01:40:26.797
The only thing they could really think to do to tell you about a pandemic, which, by the way, if it comes to this country will mean millions of dead, tens of millions severely injured and ill.

01:40:27.532 --> 01:40:31.313
It would be one of the worst catastrophes that could happen in our country in a long time.

01:40:31.493 --> 01:40:43.577
And the angle they want to take on that is not how you could protect yourself, not the severe mainstream press, the people who have been absolutely falling down on the job and failing to bring you the news that you need and deserve.

01:40:44.418 --> 01:40:53.961
The only thing they could really think to do to tell you about a pandemic, which, by the way, if it comes to this country, it will mean millions of dead, tens of millions severely injured and ill.

01:40:54.717 --> 01:40:58.498
It would be one of the worst catastrophes that could happen in our country in a long time.

01:40:58.718 --> 01:41:06.281
This is a traitor to our grandchildren, reading a script for the national security state, wittingly or unwittingly.

01:41:06.421 --> 01:41:07.021
I don't care.

01:41:07.241 --> 01:41:08.421
There's no other way to see it.

01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:14.863
That's why he was in that signal chat for almost a year with me, where I explained to him it was transfection.

01:41:14.943 --> 01:41:17.044
I explained to him that there's a hot background.

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:22.726
I explained that the whole idea of a novel virus was absurd, and he ignored it.

01:41:24.116 --> 01:41:30.920
all the way until 2024 when he could be in a stream with Kevin McKernan and Steve Kirsch and Byron Bridle and ignore it.

01:41:32.261 --> 01:41:36.524
Because these people are traitors, ladies and gentlemen, traitors of the worst kind.

01:41:37.404 --> 01:41:45.029
And the unfortunate place that I'm in is that I'm one of the only people who can show you because they tried to trick me.

01:41:45.809 --> 01:41:48.511
For five years, they tried to co-opt me.

01:41:49.554 --> 01:41:54.676
to convince me of their illusion of consensus, that how are you gonna argue with all these people?

01:41:56.156 --> 01:42:00.017
These people don't have the biology to back up the bullshit that they've been pushing.

01:42:00.077 --> 01:42:01.257
That's the reality of it.

01:42:01.658 --> 01:42:04.558
And that's why now the only thing they can do is ignore me.

01:42:05.019 --> 01:42:10.240
The only thing they can do is ignore the mentor chain that Mark Kulak has outlined.

01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:13.941
They can only ignore this history that we are now laying bare.

01:42:14.381 --> 01:42:16.802
Because if they don't ignore it,

01:42:18.188 --> 01:42:19.528
The truth will be revealed.

01:42:21.469 --> 01:42:24.470
There's no way to obfuscate their timelines.

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:33.432
There's no way to obfuscate how ridiculous their stance was in 2020 and 2021, given where they are now.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:38.753
What the hell happened there?

01:42:38.833 --> 01:42:40.033
Did I go backwards or something?

01:42:40.413 --> 01:42:40.694
Sorry.

01:42:41.594 --> 01:42:42.874
I have to get out of here for a second.

01:42:42.914 --> 01:42:43.854
I think I went backwards.

01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:46.615
Let's see.

01:42:50.868 --> 01:42:55.412
And so now I want to keep playing that because there's more after he says that worst case scenario.

01:42:56.213 --> 01:42:56.433
Oops.

01:42:58.575 --> 01:42:59.135
I got to go back.

01:42:59.375 --> 01:43:02.698
I'm just going to fast forward it a little bit though.

01:43:02.858 --> 01:43:06.101
Failing to bring you the news that you need and deserve.

01:43:06.942 --> 01:43:16.570
The only thing they could really think to do to tell you about a pandemic, which by the way, if it comes to this country, it will mean millions of dead, tens of millions severely injured and ill.

01:43:17.242 --> 01:43:21.005
It would be one of the worst catastrophes that could happen in our country in a long time.

01:43:21.205 --> 01:43:41.060
And the angle they want to take on that is not how you could protect yourself, not the severity of this, not informing you about the nature of pandemics, not giving you updated information about where we really stand in this, not telling you how you could avoid it and things you could do, which we are doing at Peak Prosperity, but they want to tell you how the outbreak could threaten the global economy.

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.843
That's the angle they need to go with here because the mainstream media is now

01:43:45.444 --> 01:43:52.748
Completely captured bought and paid for by the billionaire class by the so-called corporatists, but which isn't really It's not really capitalism.

01:43:52.808 --> 01:44:09.737
It's corporatism, right which is Fascism if you want to call that the merger of state and corporations, but it's really just super wealthy corporations making a lot of money and rentier harvesting you all of your Wages and slave labor inputs and all of that stuff.

01:44:09.757 --> 01:44:14.499
That's the most important angle is gosh this coronavirus outfit could threaten the global

01:44:15.046 --> 01:44:17.348
Economy, that's what they're leading off with here.

01:44:17.368 --> 01:44:18.809
In fact, that's the only thing they're coming up with.

01:44:18.869 --> 01:44:21.650
This is Absolutely dystopian.

01:44:21.771 --> 01:44:44.806
I I'm I'm shocked that we are at the place where we can't even as a as a at the collective level Dredge up some amount of concern for our fellow humans and understand that this pandemic is going to be a human catastrophe Not of something that dings corporate profit lines it maybe there's something more important in the story, but that just tells you

01:44:45.307 --> 01:44:46.448
where we really are in this story.

01:44:46.808 --> 01:44:47.729
All right, I'm done.

01:44:48.329 --> 01:44:48.769
I'm done.

01:44:48.869 --> 01:44:49.830
That was his thing.

01:44:50.611 --> 01:44:51.591
That was the whole thing.

01:44:52.492 --> 01:44:52.932
That's it.

01:44:54.513 --> 01:44:57.355
You got to go to Peak Prosperity and sign up if you want to know more.

01:44:57.996 --> 01:45:00.457
About a week later, he says that there's no way to stop it.

01:45:01.318 --> 01:45:06.802
About a week later, he says coronavirus pandemic is now unstoppable and it's just a happy accident.

01:45:08.018 --> 01:45:10.842
Just a happy accident that all these people were in place.

01:45:10.883 --> 01:45:17.713
Just a happy accident that Brett Weinstein got fired or got to sue and got half a million dollars.

01:45:17.773 --> 01:45:21.379
It's just a happy accident that his father worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:45:21.359 --> 01:45:23.122
's father on the formation of the FDA.

01:45:23.662 --> 01:45:27.323
It's just a happy little accident that Jessica Rose is an HIV virologist.

01:45:27.343 --> 01:45:31.864
It's just a happy little accident that this guy's been involved with Rick Bright as a career.

01:45:32.264 --> 01:45:37.785
It's just a happy accident that his best friend that used to sleep on his couch is David Hone.

01:45:37.845 --> 01:45:42.305
It's just a happy little accident that he was vetted for US AMRID.

01:45:42.846 --> 01:45:50.447
It's just a happy little accident that none of these people ever talk about the Allison Totura paper with Sina Bhavari that I got in this book.

01:45:51.527 --> 01:46:00.355
and explained very well in this book as being evidence that the National Security State had the narrative all ready to go, thanks to Mark Kulak, who found that paper and showed it to me.

01:46:00.976 --> 01:46:01.936
I got it in this book.

01:46:02.977 --> 01:46:04.318
These people are all liars.

01:46:04.459 --> 01:46:11.425
They are just coordinating with people like Hart, Claire Craig, who was into the 100,000 Genomes Project, just like

01:46:12.085 --> 01:46:14.527
Brian Hooker apparently worked for the Department of Energy.

01:46:15.087 --> 01:46:17.089
All of these people worked for pharma.

01:46:17.509 --> 01:46:19.150
They worked for insurance companies.

01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:22.873
So they have no excuse not to know how biologics are made.

01:46:22.913 --> 01:46:30.919
They have no excuse not to know that the population pyramid predicted a rise in all-cause mortality, especially in America where people are old and fat.

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:40.987
No, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid there's no explanation for these liars and for their coordinated action other than they are put in place

01:46:42.233 --> 01:46:42.993
by the slavers.

01:46:44.114 --> 01:46:46.395
Kevin McKernan was put in place by the slavers.

01:46:47.056 --> 01:46:50.418
That's the reason why he's being promoted by Mary Holland and CHD.

01:46:50.798 --> 01:47:09.408
That's the reason why he had to go on a podcast at the end of last year and lie about how this book was written and give credit to somebody who came to my house in 2022 as a liar and a meddler, who then spent the next two and a half years, sometimes in Japan with a liar and a meddler meddling with my ability to make a living.

01:47:11.089 --> 01:47:12.110
These are traitors.

01:47:12.610 --> 01:47:17.875
Charles Rixey is an American traitor, just like Kevin McKernan is an American traitor.

01:47:18.295 --> 01:47:23.399
They may be involved in the Truman Show action of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:23.479 --> 01:47:24.300
I really don't know.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.741
Maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:47:25.781 --> 01:47:27.703
coordinates all of them, for all I care.

01:47:28.103 --> 01:47:32.026
But I know for sure they are traitors to our grandkids, one and all.

01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:34.888
It's a hard message to hear.

01:47:34.928 --> 01:47:37.731
It's also a very, very shitty message to have to give.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.385
But I don't think I have any other choice, because no one else is going to say it.

01:47:42.705 --> 01:47:54.280
No one else is going to point out to you that the populist movement that is called Maha was manufactured out of whole cloth by people like Kevin McKernan.

01:47:55.759 --> 01:48:02.281
They're never going to tell you the truth that the childhood vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise.

01:48:02.321 --> 01:48:03.422
CHD won't say it.

01:48:03.602 --> 01:48:04.582
ICANN won't say it.

01:48:05.023 --> 01:48:09.664
And they'll pretend that they're trying to be, you know, diplomatic or political.

01:48:09.964 --> 01:48:12.605
And that is, it's a lie.

01:48:13.546 --> 01:48:14.466
It's a lie.

01:48:14.606 --> 01:48:16.347
Just like this is a lie.

01:48:16.467 --> 01:48:19.308
I believe it is much more likely it's a lab leak.

01:48:24.434 --> 01:48:25.856
That's why these people won't say it.

01:48:25.896 --> 01:48:28.380
The Brownstone Institute never says anything.

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:29.702
The Panda never says anything.

01:48:30.343 --> 01:48:33.848
One of these foreign organizations could crush America.

01:48:34.824 --> 01:48:49.333
You know, the NCI or, or Panda, they could crush America by just pointing out that the American childhood vaccine schedule, when compared to any other country in the West is a criminal enterprise.

01:48:49.754 --> 01:48:56.458
And therefore the American system should be ashamed of itself, but they're not going to do that because that's not in their script.

01:48:56.978 --> 01:48:57.779
That script,

01:48:58.399 --> 01:49:06.943
frees the American public from the trap, it reawakens the American children, and it revitalizes the American dream.

01:49:07.023 --> 01:49:09.485
That's the reason why these people will never say it.

01:49:10.785 --> 01:49:16.088
That's the reason why these people still can't seem to come up with a list that we've already had together for more than a couple years now.

01:49:20.126 --> 01:49:44.348
Instead we were tricked into solving a mystery that these people were all in acting on stage Thinking that we could change the the outcome of the play That's why these people will never talk about the heart of the matter ingestion versus injection That's why they'll never mention my name again never mentioned mark again because they can't because if they do then they'll have to debate the truth and

01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:49.771
If they mention us, they will have to mention Brandy Vaughn, because we're never going to stop mentioning her.

01:49:49.831 --> 01:49:52.132
There is no safe vaccine, just as she said it.

01:49:52.592 --> 01:49:55.833
The intramuscular injection of medicine is a lie.

01:49:55.893 --> 01:49:58.594
That's my addition to Brandy's language.

01:50:01.715 --> 01:50:09.577
If you want to trust somebody, and you think you can, put together a timeline of what they said when.

01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:14.030
And that timeline should edify your trust.

01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:22.253
It should support the idea that they have learned, that they have come to an understanding that they didn't have before the pandemic.

01:50:22.373 --> 01:50:24.374
Those are the only people you can trust.

01:50:27.035 --> 01:50:33.057
And I think if you do that work faithfully, you will find that you can find the truth for America's grandchildren on your own.

01:50:34.045 --> 01:50:42.192
that you can come up with your own version of American history that edifies the idea that we were lied to by people on social media working for the slavers.

01:50:42.232 --> 01:50:46.835
You don't necessarily need my personal experience to bring you to the light.

01:50:46.855 --> 01:50:53.381
You can just look at the people that you've now been bamboozled into trusting and check their work.

01:50:56.163 --> 01:50:58.145
Check their work.

01:50:59.906 --> 01:51:03.429
Because this is for all the marbles and that means the grandchildren of earth.

01:51:04.551 --> 01:51:07.235
They won't talk about injection versus ingestion.

01:51:07.275 --> 01:51:08.417
They won't talk about it.

01:51:08.537 --> 01:51:09.699
They won't talk about it.

01:51:09.739 --> 01:51:13.866
They won't talk about PCR as being a diagnostic fraud.

01:51:13.906 --> 01:51:17.692
They won't talk about synthetic recombinant genetics being the staple.

01:51:18.658 --> 01:51:32.128
of all protein biologic production and how it's even better if they can just stop at mRNA and not have to purify it in the first place, which is what Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone were always in place to obfuscate.

01:51:32.188 --> 01:51:35.491
The simple truth is, is that they can only do one thing.

01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:39.154
They can make pure quantities of DNA and then they can do stuff with it.

01:51:39.734 --> 01:51:47.939
transform and transfect things with it and call that a virology, call that infectious disease, call that a model for something that it is not.

01:51:48.419 --> 01:51:55.343
They are not recapitulating natural phenomenon when they make large quantities of pure DNA and then put it places.

01:51:56.023 --> 01:52:02.707
They are not recapitulating natural phenomenon when they take large quantities of pure DNA and put it in places.

01:52:03.885 --> 01:52:10.473
But that's all they would have to do to create the illusion of the pandemic, especially if they already had an agent in Wuhan willing to cooperate.

01:52:11.654 --> 01:52:13.036
Transfection is a crime.

01:52:13.717 --> 01:52:14.978
These people have all known it.

01:52:15.259 --> 01:52:16.600
Kevin McKernan knows it.

01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:19.163
That's why he's lying about the word.

01:52:21.166 --> 01:52:22.147
Robert Malone knows it.

01:52:22.167 --> 01:52:23.529
That's why he's never used the word.

01:52:25.225 --> 01:52:32.808
And Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying are lying about it because they are not sophisticated enough to understand how they are being used.

01:52:32.868 --> 01:52:35.389
They just are happy to be used.

01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:52.996
That's why none of these people have ever talked about a placebo and how wonderfully easy it would be to make billions of dollars with a placebo and also conveniently avoid this huge safety signal that would expose their lies for what it is.

01:52:54.977 --> 01:53:01.086
That's why instead all these people are focused on endemicity and even Robert Malone said it would be really terrible if this goes endemic.

01:53:01.146 --> 01:53:02.608
That's the worst case scenario.

01:53:06.895 --> 01:53:08.397
I think we got him, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:08.437 --> 01:53:09.779
I could keep doing this until...

01:53:10.768 --> 01:53:25.511
Until I'm 80, just the same stream with a few different slides and a few choice different videos, I can keep explaining to you how a hot background could be misconstrued as spread using non-specific PCR tests manufactured in China.

01:53:28.571 --> 01:53:37.013
I can go on until I'm 80 years old explaining every day why RNA cannot pandemic and that's why they had to have Tony Fauci in place for so freaking long.

01:53:38.968 --> 01:53:53.702
because you need a red thread of a person like Robert Malone, or Kevin McKernan, or Mark Lander, or Tony Fauci, or Francis Collins to be in place long enough for such a thorough bamboozlement and insertion of a mythology to take hold.

01:53:55.563 --> 01:54:01.846
And they're going to have to ignore me for 30 years in order for that mythology to be passed on to your kids and mine.

01:54:01.886 --> 01:54:03.647
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:54:03.687 --> 01:54:05.528
Intramuscular injection of medicine is dumb.

01:54:06.029 --> 01:54:08.670
Transfecting healthy humans was always a crime.

01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:12.852
And the population pyramids were always a problem in need of management.

01:54:12.892 --> 01:54:14.333
That's what these people are lying about.

01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:26.081
If you want to know more, try to hunt down the team worst case scenario, hunt down what they were doing, and make sure that this truth does not become, you know, this lie does not become the truth.

01:54:26.862 --> 01:54:28.303
You can't let the past fade away.

01:54:28.343 --> 01:54:29.504
We've got to archive it.

01:54:29.784 --> 01:54:31.285
Archive 2019.

01:54:31.385 --> 01:54:31.746
Archive 2020.

01:54:32.166 --> 01:54:33.887
Archive 2021.

01:54:33.947 --> 01:54:37.410
Because this is where the incriminating evidence is.

01:54:42.033 --> 01:54:43.154
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:54:43.174 --> 01:54:44.055
I'll see you guys again soon.

01:54:51.561 --> 01:54:55.782
There's a lot of repeating there, but this Monday stream is going to continue to be like that.

01:54:56.042 --> 01:54:58.103
It's going to be a meddler stream.

01:54:58.183 --> 01:55:01.784
It's going to be trying to explain how this illusion of consensus is created.

01:55:02.304 --> 01:55:10.906
The rest of the week, if I'm live, we'll try to do more focused study halls, maybe an occasional journal club until I figure out my rhythm on the basketball court.

01:55:12.027 --> 01:55:17.350
In case you're curious, one of the things that we're waiting for with the basketball court is for me to get in better shape.

01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:23.814
One of the things that became obvious to me as I looked at my early hardwood videos is that I am kind of out of shape.

01:55:23.835 --> 01:55:27.457
And so I've been spending the last two months getting in shape.

01:55:28.318 --> 01:55:32.801
And I'm just going to show you on my little app here that keeps track of it.

01:55:35.102 --> 01:55:37.284
I have in the past two months

01:55:38.371 --> 01:55:43.354
I have shot 7,820 shots and I have made 4,238 for a total of 54% shooting over the last two months and I think it's about

01:55:53.507 --> 01:55:56.770
It's about 60 days of working out already.

01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:57.871
So I'm getting better.

01:55:58.692 --> 01:56:01.795
Yesterday I hung on the rim with an incredible amount of ease.

01:56:02.836 --> 01:56:06.760
So I'm also close to maybe being able to dunk again.

01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:10.364
So I'm getting very excited about how this is all going to work out in the end.

01:56:10.824 --> 01:56:12.947
Because we're not going anywhere.

01:56:13.707 --> 01:56:17.232
Um, and this story is American history, so it needs repeating.

01:56:17.933 --> 01:56:19.174
Um, it needs refining.

01:56:19.815 --> 01:56:24.861
And, uh, you know, I'm just gotta be here, cause somebody's gonna challenge me eventually, right?

01:56:25.362 --> 01:56:26.083
Of course they are.

01:56:26.103 --> 01:56:27.224
Of course they are.

01:56:27.244 --> 01:56:28.306
Of course they are.

01:56:29.227 --> 01:56:29.988
Of course they will.
