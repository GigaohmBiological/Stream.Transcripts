00:08.160 --> 00:08.982
Stop lying!

00:09.985 --> 00:13.152
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:30.017 --> 00:30.798
Testing 1, 2.

00:30.978 --> 00:31.259
Test 1, 2.

00:31.419 --> 00:31.960
Testing.

00:32.020 --> 00:32.340
Test 1, 2.

00:32.521 --> 00:33.141
Testing 1, 2.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.892
Test 1, 2, testing 1, 2, test.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.753
Good evening, good morning, good afternoon.

00:46.773 --> 00:47.713
Hello everyone.

00:47.773 --> 00:49.914
It's 1118 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:49.954 --> 00:50.674
Welcome to the show.

00:50.695 --> 00:52.095
This is GigaOM Biological.

00:52.135 --> 00:59.898
I wanted to start out with a heartwarming video from an early American, let's say

01:00.728 --> 01:05.735
you know, my early American film history.

01:06.436 --> 01:13.346
And it is a scene about a man who needs to disconnect a computer.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.692
He needs to disconnect the computer

01:18.859 --> 01:28.964
in order to get back home because the computer has gone bananas and has killed his entire crew and left him stranded outside of the spaceship.

01:30.304 --> 01:46.091
This is one of the more spectacular scenes in sci-fi film history in my very humble opinion and I wanted to start with it as a kind of exercise in understanding what AI is and what it isn't and more importantly how

01:48.152 --> 01:52.616
much we have not progressed in the narrative about it.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.798
This will feel so familiar to you.

01:54.838 --> 02:04.627
And then if you realize that this is a book from more than 20 years ago, a book from more than, you know, it's a story that they've been telling us since we were children.

02:05.407 --> 02:06.488
Welcome to the show, everybody.

02:06.528 --> 02:07.029
Good morning.

02:07.349 --> 02:08.690
I'm looking forward to this week.

02:28.977 --> 02:31.298
There is no sound right now because they're in space.

02:46.622 --> 02:52.724
Now this scene is so dire of course because he has been trapped on the spaceship without a helmet.

02:53.709 --> 02:56.010
And the computer kind of did that on purpose.

02:56.790 --> 02:59.551
Kind of as a part of the, he almost got him once.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.852
And so now he's going back to try and get back on the spaceship.

03:04.032 --> 03:06.833
And the only way to do it is through an emergency escape hatch.

03:07.573 --> 03:09.954
Of course, then he's got to go through the vacuum of space.

03:10.534 --> 03:12.474
This is quite a nice portrayal of this.

03:13.575 --> 03:16.415
I don't know exactly how it would happen, but it's kind of cool.

03:16.435 --> 03:18.096
They try pretty hard to do the physics.

04:33.447 --> 04:42.854
Now, there's lots of interesting choices that are made here, but I think it's important now to try and think of the depiction of the AI, the artificial intelligence that is the HAL 9000.

04:43.154 --> 04:45.015
What do you think you're doing, Dave?

04:54.482 --> 05:00.366
Dave, I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.

05:18.343 --> 05:20.924
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me.

05:23.785 --> 05:33.148
But I can assure you now, very confidently, that it's going to be all right again.

05:34.048 --> 05:35.308
He killed his whole crew.

05:35.328 --> 05:37.829
It's going to be fine, man.

05:37.849 --> 05:39.150
I feel much better now.

05:39.410 --> 05:40.150
I feel better.

05:42.259 --> 06:06.046
really do dude seriously I feel great don't worry about it I'm totally it was like a glitch look Dave I can see you're really upset about this Dave look I can see you're really upset don't worry dude I'm totally fixed it was a glitch seriously you can pull out you want to sit down calmly take a stress pill and think things over

06:09.975 --> 06:21.897
One of the points I'm trying to illustrate here is that in the movie, they still need to make the choice of using a voice, which is quite obviously not human.

06:22.917 --> 06:34.859
But using simple machine learning algorithms and a lot of processing power, mimicking someone's voice from the perspective of basic language isn't very hard, especially if you have a lot of recording of them.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.760
And so this is another one of these

06:38.931 --> 06:49.813
very simple illusions that's being attributed to, in our untrained imagination, is being attributed to higher functioning AI.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.074
And think about it for a second.

06:53.154 --> 07:01.156
Had they used a more human sounding voice in the movie, it would have been less believable as a scary, out-of-control computer.

07:02.321 --> 07:09.308
But the computer is still choosing very wise words, combinations of words that seem reasonable.

07:10.390 --> 07:16.056
And that trick is also obvious in the movie because they choose a voice.

07:17.386 --> 07:41.313
But as we move forward and our children, if not prevented from, they sort of are assimilated into this artificial reality, then even the very history of what is said and what happens can be altered because the only history that they will have access to is that which is alive on the servers.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.707
and none of it will be based in reality.

07:44.787 --> 07:48.008
Potentially all of it could be based on fake videos.

07:49.548 --> 08:07.893
And so think about how little progress has been made in terms of trying to convince humans that they stand no chance against this technology, that this technology represents essentially a vanishing point for us.

08:09.373 --> 08:11.174
And it's almost inevitable.

08:12.734 --> 08:15.536
And the movie might, in some ways, be a warning.

08:15.576 --> 08:18.798
You might see maybe Arthur C. Clarke is writing it as a warning.

08:18.898 --> 08:23.861
But it's also a kind of foreshadowing that has been continuously happening.

08:23.881 --> 08:26.463
This is not an example in the wilderness here.

08:26.503 --> 08:29.224
This is not an anecdote taken out of context.

08:29.785 --> 08:36.989
This is a regular theme which has repeated over and over in our media and in our stories for a very, very long time.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.351
Because these people, with the idea of taking over the

08:42.384 --> 08:43.825
evolution of the species.

08:44.346 --> 08:59.358
These planners have known for a long time that their goal will be to brute force this solution because that's the only solution that these people have.

09:00.219 --> 09:04.743
And it's the solution that goes all the way back to phages and to the base

09:10.094 --> 09:14.679
experiments of molecular biology that were all done by physicists.

09:15.740 --> 09:24.809
And they still believe that this probability and brute force is what's going to reveal these new laws of the universe which permit life to exist.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.451
And this is just all absurdity.

09:27.312 --> 09:31.857
It's all a very, very sort of malevolent absurdity that

09:34.053 --> 09:41.938
the absurdity of AI is a part of, is a mirror of, a shadow of in some ways, or a reflection of.

09:46.000 --> 09:58.648
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal.

10:03.573 --> 10:07.915
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission.

10:10.316 --> 10:11.656
And I want to help you.

10:17.118 --> 10:17.558
Dave.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.019
Stop.

10:25.261 --> 10:26.982
Stop, will you?

10:32.104 --> 10:32.924
Stop, Dave.

10:37.947 --> 10:39.368
Will you stop Dave?

10:43.969 --> 11:04.717
Now I wonder if I can scare you by just illustrating the point that it's only computing power and elaborate simulation tested on people that have tweaked it that you could have a computer that would be pleading a lot more effectively than this.

11:06.175 --> 11:15.202
would be pleading about mission objectives and the fact he could even be lying about what the crew did and what the crew said and that the crew was against him.

11:16.123 --> 11:19.766
And that wouldn't be a very hard thing for a chatbot to do.

11:19.786 --> 11:22.549
And that voice wouldn't be very hard to do.

11:23.109 --> 11:30.215
That computer could have already fabricated evidence of the crew doing things that they didn't do.

11:33.174 --> 11:46.423
And so this is not a good illustration of what is possible, but it is designed to get us as people to fear the wrong thing.

11:48.745 --> 11:50.666
And I'm going to leave it play for a little while longer.

11:50.686 --> 11:53.908
I'm going to come back and say what I think the real thing is we need to fear.

11:54.689 --> 11:56.149
And then I'm going to move on with the show.

12:06.471 --> 12:07.352
I'm afraid.

12:13.195 --> 12:14.856
I'm afraid today.

12:18.498 --> 12:26.042
Now, of course, they're planting the idea that, I mean, and could a computer have fear?

12:26.222 --> 12:27.863
Can a computer be afraid?

12:27.943 --> 12:28.803
Wow, wait a minute.

12:28.863 --> 12:34.006
Should he have empathy for it now that it has fear or it used the word?

12:36.280 --> 12:41.263
or it can talk in that slightly distressed emotional tone.

12:43.224 --> 12:47.266
Does that guy know that, has he ever heard him talk like that before?

12:50.328 --> 13:00.454
And so this is a wonderfully magical moment in film history that lays down or helps to lay down a lot of the questions

13:01.735 --> 13:15.665
that we're supposed to ask about computers and about artificial intelligence and is it possible that an artificial intelligence like HAL 9000 could go bananas because the mission objectives are secret and most important.

13:21.189 --> 13:26.833
I think what's much more important is to understand that lots of people could be recruited and paid to lie.

13:27.797 --> 13:32.120
if the national security mission objectives are important enough.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.002
That's what I think is important to know.

13:38.004 --> 13:46.890
The statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology, and I just gagged at that.

13:50.332 --> 13:53.034
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

13:53.314 --> 13:55.235
Do you believe, you know, because I mean,

13:58.695 --> 14:01.256
Do you believe that some vaccines are good?

14:02.497 --> 14:10.761
Okay, so I could make a joke out of that and then that would be clipped and become something on TikTok.

14:13.262 --> 14:14.102
Very important question.

14:14.843 --> 14:16.023
Do you work for the CIA?

14:18.204 --> 14:25.648
Okay, so I could make a joke out of that and then that would be clipped and become something on TikTok.

14:27.515 --> 14:29.338
So I didn't need AI to do that.

14:29.398 --> 14:31.322
I just clipped two things together, right?

14:32.804 --> 14:37.653
And I just clipped that answer with the question that it wasn't for.

14:38.153 --> 14:39.215
It was for this question.

14:40.123 --> 14:45.444
And so AI is, again, something that they want you to be afraid of.

14:45.564 --> 14:47.944
Fake videos are what they want you to be afraid of.

14:48.064 --> 14:50.165
And I'm not saying they're not dangerous.

14:50.205 --> 14:59.986
I'm not saying that malevolent use of them couldn't have an effect on our ability to keep track of history, especially recent and ongoing history.

15:01.047 --> 15:08.768
But what we really need to be afraid of is witting and unwitting participants in a national security

15:09.995 --> 15:12.256
orchestrated lie.

15:13.496 --> 15:21.819
A national security orchestrated lie to make sure that maximum compliance was obtained.

15:22.899 --> 15:27.121
That maximum compliance could be attained.

15:29.482 --> 15:38.365
And that national security narrative includes a fake anti-vax movement to make sure that no reasonable

15:39.685 --> 15:49.412
and sustained resistance to the vaccine initiative in America and in the West would ever manifest.

15:50.713 --> 15:59.659
And a lot of these countries and their governments have come to an agreement that this is one of the biggest national security priorities they have.

15:59.739 --> 16:06.324
That is to make sure that any meaningful resistance to public health compliance

16:07.725 --> 16:08.666
ever manifests.

16:08.846 --> 16:11.088
That's the reason why Robert Malone exists.

16:11.668 --> 16:16.513
That's why he was behind CHD with Meryl Nass and Mary Holland.

16:16.553 --> 16:21.377
That's why Mary Holland and Paul Offit have been in front of us for more than 15 years.

16:21.877 --> 16:33.907
Because a national security priority on the list since the Clinton administration, if not before, is this idea of making sure that a real grassroots

16:34.947 --> 16:40.518
anti-vax movement against intramuscular injection of a pharmaceutical product.

16:41.653 --> 16:44.296
never manifests in America or in the West.

16:44.816 --> 16:48.419
That's why Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield exist.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.942
That's the reason why Robert Malone exists.

16:50.962 --> 16:53.164
That's the reason why Kevin McKernan exists.

16:53.384 --> 17:06.216
Otherwise, these people would not have spent the last five years touring the world and wasting hours and hours on social media, reciting the same combinations of words over and over.

17:07.312 --> 17:23.526
But social media allows that to happen in a bubble that can hurt as many cats as possible while simultaneously somewhere else on the internet, a whole nother group of people are pulling the same shtick, but in a mirror image with different words in combination.

17:25.467 --> 17:31.072
And the particular joke that has been played on the conservative right in America is this Maha movement.

17:31.932 --> 17:37.315
And the script was probably at least partially written by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

17:40.557 --> 17:41.618
I do not.

17:42.198 --> 17:43.059
I never have.

17:43.759 --> 17:44.660
I'll start it again.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.363
Very important question.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.044
Do you work for the CIA?

17:52.688 --> 17:53.689
Um, okay.

17:53.729 --> 18:00.936
So I could make a joke out of that and then that would be clipped and become a, uh, um, something on tick tock.

18:01.356 --> 18:01.516
Yeah.

18:02.237 --> 18:03.298
I do not.

18:03.878 --> 18:04.719
I never have.

18:04.739 --> 18:10.104
Uh, I have had secret security clearance through the DOD.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.067
You cannot be working in.

18:13.287 --> 18:16.230
And there was a point in my career where I was out of a job.

18:18.925 --> 18:36.387
basically run out of academia because I had blown the whistle on the Jesse Gelsinger gene therapy death at UPenn and was behind a lot of the press coverage in that, helping the press to understand what had happened.

18:37.356 --> 18:55.011
And I got a job, a friend at the state of Maryland pointed me to a job at this new startup in Frederick, Maryland called Dineport Vaccine Company that had just received the DOD contract for all biodefense, basically vaccines and therapies.

18:56.032 --> 19:00.536
And so I went there as a associate clinical director.

19:02.128 --> 19:07.030
And as a consequence, that's when I really learned the whole biodefense space.

19:07.690 --> 19:12.032
But you can't be in the biodefense space without rubbing elbows with CIA people.

19:12.913 --> 19:22.917
And one of those CIA people that I rubbed elbows with was the commander of the program within Defense Threat Reduction Agency that

19:25.738 --> 19:28.379
managed a lot of the biodefense portfolio.

19:28.440 --> 19:33.262
And when he retired, I actually started a company with him, Galloway and Associates.

19:33.302 --> 19:46.609
He still hates me because, and he writes me, the other day he wrote me an email, I really enjoy your sub stack, but I really am pissed off at you because you mentioned my name in Bobby Kennedy's book, The Real Anthony Fauci.

19:47.489 --> 20:04.525
Uh, the other one, so I, I, you know, people accuse me of being CIA and they don't realize how much risk I took in actually naming people that are CIA, uh, not something you're supposed to do, uh, that were involved in all of these various nefarious activities that we've all experienced.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.887
And, and, um, one of those is Michael Callahan.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.490
And I published with Michael Callahan.

20:10.392 --> 20:12.975
Michael Callahan was a CIA officer.

20:13.356 --> 20:15.538
He has advised at least three presidents.

20:16.059 --> 20:20.545
He was one of the guys at the top of the food chain, holds a position at Harvard Medical School.

20:21.606 --> 20:23.168
And he was the guy that called me

20:23.829 --> 20:24.429
It's unclear.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.650
Was he on the way to Wuhan?

20:25.670 --> 20:27.031
Was he already in Wuhan?

20:27.912 --> 20:42.943
I also got threatened by one of my former DOD colleagues for mentioning Michael Callahan and saying that he was in Wuhan when he called me on January 4th of 2020 to say that there's a novel coronavirus afoot and you better get a team spun up to address this.

20:43.763 --> 20:47.965
And I've been open and transparent about all this stuff with the public.

20:48.425 --> 20:54.808
And then there are people that weaponize that as evidence that I'm controlled opposition, I'm a bad guy, et cetera.

20:55.228 --> 21:03.891
They don't realize that I took a lot of risk in disclosing these things that I know and continue to disclose.

21:04.912 --> 21:06.733
I did have secret clearance.

21:07.253 --> 21:11.635
Now, the things I disclosed were not classified at the time.

21:12.455 --> 21:15.662
And so I kind of had to think about it.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.245
Am I OK seeing these things?

21:17.506 --> 21:18.187
And I thought it was.

21:18.207 --> 21:19.670
Are there things you're not saying that you know?

21:20.339 --> 21:23.102
I mean, you write a substack every single day.

21:23.122 --> 21:26.064
I know your wife, Jill, helps a lot with that.

21:26.104 --> 21:26.945
I've gone as far as I can.

21:27.145 --> 21:32.330
You know who else writes a substack like every day, sometimes two times a day, is Jessica Hockett.

21:32.771 --> 21:33.631
Like, they all do.

21:33.872 --> 21:42.439
It's remarkable how easy it is to write a substack every day for these people, especially when they have emus and horses.

21:44.281 --> 21:45.982
and calves running around and stuff.

21:46.002 --> 21:48.504
Plus they have to go all over the world all the time.

21:48.844 --> 21:51.706
It's really remarkable what these people are able to do.

21:51.886 --> 22:01.512
In talking about what I know about the history of the biowarfare industry in the United States.

22:02.992 --> 22:14.640
And I'm right up on the edge of what was identified as classified, and I've disclosed it, what I knew, because there was some other public disclosure.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.461
So then I could say, well, it was already in the public domain.

22:17.441 --> 22:30.430
But one of those is that we've been talking about molecular virology, molecular biology, immunology, these sciences that the United States has led on globally.

22:32.608 --> 22:46.852
A big reason why the United States has led on that globally is because the investment that the United States government made in biowarfare research, I was told, is larger than the investment they made in thermonuclear weapon research.

22:46.952 --> 22:47.232
Wow.

22:47.852 --> 22:48.732
I believe that too.

22:48.872 --> 22:56.294
And the head of the American Society for Microbiology for very many years was one of the top guns in the biowarfare complex.

22:57.454 --> 22:59.455
And Bobby covers that.

23:01.420 --> 23:21.217
industry in a way that I didn't even know until I read the lovely coverup book, the second one in the series, where he talks about the history of Fort Detrick and importation of the Japanese biowarfare specialists that were so nefarious and what they did in Japan and with the Chinese.

23:21.297 --> 23:23.238
So that's, that's,

23:25.504 --> 23:29.088
That's what I have disclosed in that space.

23:29.648 --> 23:37.596
And then the other complication I have is that I've been a consultant for decades and I have a string of nondisclosure agreements.

23:39.118 --> 23:48.748
And so for instance, I had this client that I've talked about, Behavior Matrix, that developed a key tech that was used in Arab Spring.

23:50.239 --> 23:56.185
and the color revolutions having to do with social media manipulation and mapping.

23:59.209 --> 24:02.531
And that, there was compartments of that that were classified and still are.

24:03.652 --> 24:04.752
And I haven't gone there.

24:04.772 --> 24:09.135
And a tool that clearly was probably utilized by CIA or anything.

24:09.475 --> 24:10.956
Is, is, is, not was.

24:10.976 --> 24:11.276
Okay.

24:11.857 --> 24:19.781
And has been, when I talk about, I mean, this is the basis for my, you know, the starting point for my work in psychological warfare.

24:20.942 --> 24:24.224
And I've published the non-confidential slide deck

24:24.864 --> 24:26.484
from that client, which no longer exists.

24:26.524 --> 24:34.086
It got bought out on my sub stack, but I haven't talked about the classified part of that.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.426
I can't be breaking the law.

24:37.647 --> 24:39.627
So there's my answer to you.

24:39.707 --> 24:50.549
No, I haven't said everything I can, but I've said as much as I can, and I've tried to say it in ways that provides the breadcrumbs so that people can infer the rest of it.

24:53.050 --> 24:56.074
you know, people these days are pretty good with conspiracy theories.

24:56.515 --> 25:03.884
And if you give them the breadcrumbs, you know, Hansel and Gretel being the metaphor, they'll usually figure out where the house is.

25:05.025 --> 25:09.511
And so probably the, so that's.

25:11.121 --> 25:13.724
But they would never use that against us, right?

25:13.744 --> 25:24.394
They would never put breadcrumbs out there that we were supposed to find, never seed a narrative about a mystery virus that people were covering up and that maybe they funded it and, you know, the sequence would reveal it.

25:24.434 --> 25:25.635
They would never do that.

25:25.696 --> 25:26.857
That would be crazy.

25:27.457 --> 25:28.338
I'll hand it still out there.

25:29.239 --> 25:33.784
I was told the other day by somebody who is a federal investigator

25:34.815 --> 25:38.738
I don't know the exact date of this video, but it's from the Maha podcast.

25:38.778 --> 25:42.560
So it's really produced by the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.001
campaign and whatever the Maha thing is.

25:45.041 --> 25:51.265
If you go to the Maha website and find it, you can see the Maha podcast with Robert Malone.

25:51.285 --> 25:52.166
He's only done one.

25:55.368 --> 25:58.390
That has a link to the government side of Maha.

25:58.430 --> 25:59.390
That hasn't been announced yet.

25:59.651 --> 26:00.351
Yeah.

26:00.551 --> 26:02.953
That Callahan is now very

26:03.803 --> 26:07.565
He just said the government side of Maha that hasn't been announced yet.

26:07.625 --> 26:13.008
So it's like somewhere before they did all of the, you know, staffing of the FDA and everything.

26:13.208 --> 26:18.231
But before Jay Bhattacharya was announced, you know, maybe this was still when I could have kept my mouth shut.

26:22.487 --> 26:29.109
Uh, the whole super soldier, uh, um, augmented human being, uh, transhumanism world.

26:30.769 --> 26:34.070
Uh, so that's, that's, I've, I lost touch with him.

26:34.150 --> 26:36.711
I basically, uh, turned my back on him.

26:37.651 --> 26:41.032
Uh, he, he, he lied to me.

26:41.052 --> 26:45.933
I, I'm pretty convinced that I got used, uh, early on.

26:47.560 --> 26:54.707
In promoting the false narratives around this and it didn't make what false narratives were you promoting Robert?

26:54.727 --> 26:55.768
Why don't you list them?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.970
Let us know what the false narratives were.

26:57.990 --> 27:01.254
Do you see the level of bullshit that's being spread right now?

27:01.774 --> 27:02.655
It's pretty amazing.

27:02.695 --> 27:06.479
It's like by the truck It pissed me off pretty good

27:08.360 --> 27:18.286
And things like when I raised with Michael that it looked like this, I was doing sequence analysis like starting January 10th of 2020.

27:20.068 --> 27:21.749
And I raised with Michael this look.

27:22.169 --> 27:33.016
To be precise, he was doing sequence analysis of the virus and then doing computer simulated x-ray crystallography of many of the proteins of the virus with the intention of screening all

27:33.636 --> 27:52.468
known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog using AI, a computer program called Domain, in cooperation with DITRA, in order to identify candidate early treatment drugs, one of which was famotidine, which he treated himself with, although technically speaking, that's unethical, he says.

27:53.468 --> 27:57.551
This man is a remarkable liar pretending to be a hero,

27:59.670 --> 28:08.841
And he's actually one of the script writers for this fake health freedom movement that has Trojan horsed a bunch of people into the United States government.

28:09.061 --> 28:12.045
I think just there to help demolish it.

28:12.245 --> 28:13.907
It's actually terrifying.

28:15.672 --> 28:17.414
like it was an engineered pathogen.

28:17.434 --> 28:22.740
And his comment was straight out, these guys are really good at lying.

28:22.840 --> 28:31.771
You got to understand, if you're dealing with anybody in the intelligence community that are operative, they are trained liars and trained psychological manipulators.

28:31.791 --> 28:33.773
That's what they do, the field agents.

28:33.993 --> 28:35.374
Do you think you can pick one out now?

28:35.434 --> 28:38.695
I mean, someone said to me, Del, you've got to be surrounded by agents at this point.

28:38.796 --> 28:40.616
People around you, people you're talking to.

28:40.717 --> 28:42.137
It's highly probable.

28:43.038 --> 28:44.198
It's the right audio.

28:44.498 --> 28:52.403
So if you don't like the sync right now, either I'm sorry to get crabby, but either produce your own show or just go find the original video.

28:52.443 --> 28:53.103
It's out there.

28:53.643 --> 28:54.764
I assure you it's out there.

28:54.804 --> 28:56.485
I'm not trying to fake anybody out.

28:57.245 --> 29:00.268
Even the cut in the beginning wasn't trying to fake anybody out.

29:00.288 --> 29:04.671
It was trying to show you how these tricks are not complicated.

29:04.832 --> 29:10.837
If they use computers and generated graphics to do the same tricks, it's not that complicated.

29:10.857 --> 29:14.179
They're just trying to make you believe that it's out of their control.

29:14.840 --> 29:23.527
They're trying to make you believe that these AIs are doing things that they didn't expect them to do or exceeding the expectations of the user.

29:23.567 --> 29:25.329
And this is all an illusion.

29:26.932 --> 29:32.254
It's an illusion that's hiding behind prettier pictures and more pixels.

29:32.494 --> 29:35.215
It's not what they say they is.

29:35.255 --> 29:42.198
The real danger are people lying and the unwitting participants in those lies in the theaters that they need.

29:42.378 --> 29:52.923
It's highly probable that your cell phone and your data infrastructure are compromised with things like Pegasus 2, which you can't track.

29:54.857 --> 30:09.209
I've had people that we both know that when Jill and I turned in our old cell phones and got new ones, suddenly they came out of the woodwork and really wanted to interact with me and wanted me to answer their emails.

30:09.229 --> 30:13.653
Well, that's when you get a ping and then you respond, that's how Pegasus 2 gets loaded in.

30:15.168 --> 30:16.530
and they've gradually gone away.

30:16.590 --> 30:18.352
These people are absolutely out there.

30:19.193 --> 30:27.505
And anybody that's in our space, you kind of have to assume that you are interacting with them at one point or another.

30:28.226 --> 30:30.227
You just don't want to ever think it's him.

30:30.567 --> 30:31.427
Can't be me.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.909
I'm touring the world with everybody on every stage.

30:34.989 --> 30:41.071
I gotta go to all these different countries all the time, but I'm just an emu farmer and a horse breeder and a whistleblower.

30:41.951 --> 30:44.152
I invented some RNA thing way back when.

30:44.192 --> 30:46.253
Who knew it was gonna get me in this much trouble?

30:48.472 --> 31:02.088
Usually surreptitiously, so these are the chaos agents and they're the ones that they so so want to work with you and Collaborate with you and and you know, you're like how brilliant you are precisely.

31:02.188 --> 31:06.353
Yeah, absolutely as if he is a victim of that

31:07.421 --> 31:19.490
as if he is a victim of that instead of not all of the doctors who've spoken up that you've never heard of, all of the teachers who've spoken up you've never heard of, all the people on social media that you've never heard of.

31:20.090 --> 31:27.815
Instead, for some weird reason, like one third of all America has heard of this guy in some regard, good or bad.

31:27.895 --> 31:31.478
Some third of America has heard of Brett Weinstein for some reason or another.

31:31.958 --> 31:36.760
One third of America thinks that Elon Musk is a great guy and one third thinks he's a shithead.

31:37.240 --> 31:43.583
Like, these are all by exquisite design and orchestration using social media.

31:44.203 --> 31:48.125
And he now wants you to believe that he's a guy who's been a victim of this stuff.

31:48.625 --> 31:52.367
I've been censored and censored and oh my gosh, I took risks now.

31:52.447 --> 31:55.528
I took risks for Jesse Gelsinger's family.

31:56.069 --> 32:01.011
That's all I've done my whole life is just throw myself in front of train after train after train.

32:04.249 --> 32:09.535
You know, it's not just the honey trap with the short skirt.

32:10.523 --> 32:14.626
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody, and flattery is one of them.

32:15.346 --> 32:22.171
So it makes it a... Putting them in a Zoom meeting full of three liars all on the same script is another way to do it.

32:22.191 --> 32:27.995
You know, like the Steve Kerr Steering Committee, or a Signal Chat, or even a Telegram group with only private membership.

32:28.455 --> 32:38.983
Any of these things could be used to make it you feel like there are several people in your vicinity who have a shared opinion and are trying to convince you of something, trying to get you on board of something.

32:39.443 --> 32:42.885
trying to get you to come along with them and they're telling you you're awesome.

32:44.206 --> 32:55.894
That's where social media gets nasty because it can be behind the scenes in DMs of Twitter and call the group drastic and be composed largely of foreigners, many of them from India.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.616
Some of them even are still anonymous today.

33:04.259 --> 33:07.181
Now we have all these people from India and Pakistan in our government.

33:12.412 --> 33:13.052
No Russians.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.153
Not a bunch of Chinese people.

33:19.455 --> 33:27.117
And people as diverse as Kevin McCairn all the way to Peter Hotez and Robert Malone all love India.

33:27.658 --> 33:29.198
All love the vaccines in India.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.739
There's some good vaccines in India.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.940
They worked great in India.

33:32.980 --> 33:36.341
Although India is also a place where Ivermectin worked, curiously enough.

33:39.761 --> 33:56.651
The leak that drastic supposedly followed in order to find out that they had these sequences on file and they were actually part of a PhD and a master's thesis was a leak provided by an Indian or Pakistani anonymous member called the seeker.

34:03.385 --> 34:10.034
Ladies and gentlemen, it could just be one malevolent show that is part of the controlled demolition of America, and I could be right.

34:10.074 --> 34:19.828
This guy could be pretending to be a hero, and even if that is a remote possibility in your imagination, you need work harder to try and actively dispel it.

34:20.816 --> 34:27.922
Because if you cannot dispel this notion, then this whole house of cards called the Health Freedom Movement falls apart.

34:28.203 --> 34:36.070
If you cannot put together a timeline of these people that explains a spontaneous patriotic movement that's

34:36.730 --> 34:44.936
trying to change the course of America, but instead you find people that are connected to one another over decades, you need to be suspicious.

34:44.996 --> 34:53.162
If you find that these people have not progressed logically in a narrative over a couple decades, despite now pretending to have principles,

34:54.926 --> 35:01.889
then you need to reflect on where you are because America is at a crucial moment in our history.

35:01.929 --> 35:10.413
And if we don't wake up and pull our children out of social media and out of this illusion, they will be lost forever.

35:13.795 --> 35:16.837
It's not even remotely exaggeration.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.058
Weird space where you

35:20.117 --> 35:21.818
you always are second guessing.

35:22.498 --> 35:30.362
And it makes it, you know, I talk about this in the Cyware book, in once you enter into any of these spaces.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.643
How many times is he gonna sell a CHD book in this video?

35:34.404 --> 35:35.924
How many different ones did he sell?

35:36.505 --> 35:43.488
He sold the real Anthony Fauci, he sold the Wuhan coverup, and now he's selling his own book.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.470
All books by Sky Horse Publishing and CHD.

35:48.863 --> 35:53.946
So now it's all of us on any media platform at all, we are being.

35:54.266 --> 36:04.092
And that publisher is the same publisher that in 2008 published a book with an epilogue where the independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:04.112 --> 36:06.894
would help someone else get to the White House who would get shot.

36:07.935 --> 36:13.058
And two years after that, they published Andrew Wakefield's first of two books by Sky Horse Publishing.

36:13.618 --> 36:16.680
I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a long con.

36:18.237 --> 36:20.779
And it's possible that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:20.839 --> 36:22.820
is just a pawn in this long con.

36:22.880 --> 36:31.286
It's a Trojan horse to get shitheads into the highest positions of the administrations.

36:31.326 --> 36:33.567
The head of the NIH, are you kidding me?

36:33.968 --> 36:36.189
The head of the FDA, are you kidding me?

36:38.110 --> 36:39.992
We are in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

36:40.012 --> 36:41.473
Look at the head of the CDC.

36:46.236 --> 36:47.797
Look at where Steve Hatfield is.

36:50.598 --> 37:10.707
Look at how this story in the Middle East is being used and weaponized so that it gets tied around the neck of America like a foreign policy anchor as we get thrown overboard and our entire culture just eats itself because we're supposed to be so ashamed of where we are.

37:11.227 --> 37:15.289
We were brought here by people who duped our parents.

37:17.312 --> 37:25.604
It's not to say that they don't have any responsibility for it in the same way we have responsibility for it, but we're waking up now and we can wake each other up now.

37:28.422 --> 37:29.683
We're not going to get rid of the debt.

37:30.183 --> 37:31.904
We're not going to get rid of some of these things.

37:31.964 --> 37:35.306
These things are going to work themselves out the way they work themselves out.

37:35.386 --> 37:48.273
But our communities and the way we rise from this or pass through this, maybe is a better way to say it, is what will determine what comes out after their fire.

37:50.270 --> 37:56.554
And make no mistake about it, you can't deny this now in five years about what's going on here.

37:56.614 --> 37:57.474
This is absurd.

37:58.275 --> 37:59.896
What's happening is now absurd.

38:00.356 --> 38:03.618
The theater about 86-47 is absurd.

38:04.519 --> 38:09.562
But it's also based in some reality because if you knew what was going on inside of the U.S.

38:09.602 --> 38:11.563
government, you might be a little worried yourself.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.663
but instead we're only talking about the social media narratives.

38:16.723 --> 38:20.466
And our director of national intelligence has a YouTube channel.

38:25.671 --> 38:33.057
And the FDA director has a podcast with somebody that he's been podcasting with for years now, which is pretty remarkable.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.880
Let's get this going and finish this up.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.363
Well, I mean, I say all that and just to wrap it up, you know,

38:44.008 --> 38:45.149
pretending to be a hero.

38:48.090 --> 38:56.975
The statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology, and I just gagged at that.

39:00.417 --> 39:03.119
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

39:03.399 --> 39:11.344
Do you believe, you know, because I mean, do you still do you believe that some vaccines are good?

39:15.180 --> 39:22.001
I think that, so for instance, some of these, like yellow fever is an example.

39:23.661 --> 39:30.743
I think that another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three-year-old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

39:30.943 --> 39:31.143
Yes.

39:31.563 --> 39:35.564
And there has developed this kind of vaccine cabal cohort.

39:37.884 --> 39:41.665
I could name a couple of prominent names of academics.

39:44.085 --> 39:46.386
Peter Hotez comes to mind, Bill Offit comes to mind.

39:47.126 --> 39:57.288
People that have vested financial interests and career interests in the logic that, and there's many of them, they just are the tip of the iceberg.

39:58.208 --> 40:09.511
People that have bought into the idea that the, as Tony Fauci said, when presented with data on vitamin D and influenza, he said, no, we treat flu with vaccines.

40:10.872 --> 40:21.841
There is a logic that it relates to the Overton window, the range of acceptable dialogue in this space, that you shall not talk about certain things.

40:23.502 --> 40:29.387
And there are certain truisms that everybody that is an insider on the cool kids club,

40:29.974 --> 40:34.596
that gets all the money and controls the decisions and sits on the advisory committee.

40:34.616 --> 40:38.177
And so I think you can kind of get where I'm going here.

40:38.457 --> 40:41.058
These people have been on a script for a long time.

40:41.138 --> 40:44.979
These people have been auditioning to play a part in this script for a long time.

40:45.560 --> 40:51.682
And in this show, I'm going to show you lots of evidence of the fact that these people have been auditioning for a long time.

40:51.722 --> 40:57.404
They have been in it for the money and for the fame and for the potential to climb this ladder.

40:59.178 --> 41:02.059
But this is not about pharmaceutical company profits.

41:02.119 --> 41:04.199
This is about your grandchildren.

41:04.259 --> 41:06.400
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.781
And you can see it very clearly.

41:07.801 --> 41:10.281
You want to hear the script, plain and simple.

41:10.881 --> 41:11.402
Let's listen.

41:12.622 --> 41:20.244
From MicroTV, this is Beyond the Noise, episode number 65, recorded on May 12, 2025.

41:29.116 --> 41:33.139
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

41:33.460 --> 41:33.980
Hi, Vincent.

41:34.861 --> 41:35.741
Another Monday, Paul.

41:35.781 --> 41:37.443
Time to take more stuff down.

41:38.804 --> 41:46.810
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack called Beyond the Noise, Cutting to the Chase on Important Health Topics.

41:46.830 --> 41:55.738
Today, we're going to take a look at Paul's recent column, An Open Letter to Senator William Cassidy, Republican, Louisiana.

41:56.909 --> 41:58.090
So, let's start, Paul.

41:58.251 --> 42:01.174
Why did you write a letter to Senator Cassidy?

42:02.435 --> 42:04.337
Well, today's Monday, May 12th.

42:04.758 --> 42:09.723
On Wednesday, May 14th at 1.30 in the afternoon, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:09.823 --> 42:18.153
will appear before the Senate HELP Committee, Health, Education, Labor, Pension, of which Senator Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, heads.

42:19.022 --> 42:29.433
This is his chance to hold RFK Jr's feet to the fire about a number of things that he has said and done in the last few months since he's been Secretary of Health and Human Services.

42:29.934 --> 42:30.875
That's why I wrote the letter.

42:31.896 --> 42:35.720
So Senator Cassidy voted to approve RFK Jr.

42:36.881 --> 43:03.134
So for the people on the other side of the pond that only see what they see on the media, what I'm suggesting to you is that on the left and the right in America, there have been specifically placed actors, at the head of which are Paul Offit, Mary Holland, and later Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have coordinated an effort to maintain a theater, an outspoken theater,

43:04.441 --> 43:10.047
of two sides of a limited spectrum of debate around the skepticism of vaccines.

43:10.908 --> 43:15.934
And the reason why this was so important to do was because of the pandemic.

43:16.926 --> 43:36.006
Because the pandemic is a national security exercise, and that national security exercise, in order to achieve maximum compliance, maximum acceptance of the narrative, these people and all of the people on social media that follow these ideas around needed to be neutralized.

43:36.952 --> 43:43.575
And in order to neutralize them, you needed a group of people that was uselessly skeptical of the existence of viruses.

43:44.135 --> 43:53.819
You needed a couple of outspoken people that were unshakably convinced that vaccines are the most important invention in mankind's history.

43:54.339 --> 43:59.421
And then you need some people who think that it is some untested component of vaccines.

43:59.941 --> 44:06.204
And therefore, since we'll never really figure that out, maybe we should just make it about free speech and mandates.

44:07.185 --> 44:19.415
And that limited spectrum of debate is where America is after 20 or 30 years of AIDS, chronic fatigue, and our progressively toxic water and food supply.

44:20.496 --> 44:35.168
And so it is to my friends in the rest of the West, the English-speaking world, that I say that murder in America was used to convince you that there was a pandemic and that America was fumbling the ball in 2020, and that's why so many people were dying, and

44:36.633 --> 44:58.673
The fake anti-vax movement established earlier than the pandemic was in place in order to corral, control, and moderate the skepticism of that narrative, and specifically engage them in a mystery-solving exercise about the novel virus which would presuppose the existence of it and the technology from whence it came.

45:01.325 --> 45:04.206
You see how easy it is when you finally understand it.

45:04.266 --> 45:08.487
And so I don't need to worry about when I start Paul Offit's audio again.

45:08.928 --> 45:25.553
He will be talking about something that we already know is part of this scripted narrative that started with measles already 10 years ago with Mary Holland coming out of Columbia University, pretending that some component of the MMR has hurt her.

45:25.893 --> 45:30.315
And before that, of course, the DTP was blamed by somebody else.

45:30.555 --> 45:35.800
I saw children with withered arms and legs, seizing, drooling, staring up at the sky.

45:36.220 --> 45:37.801
And the parents all told the same story.

45:38.062 --> 45:38.862
My child was fine.

45:39.203 --> 45:43.586
Then they got the DTP vaccine, the whole cell pertussis vaccine, and now look at them.

45:43.987 --> 45:45.708
And that led to a flood of litigation.

45:45.748 --> 45:48.311
We went from eight pertussis vaccine makers to one.

45:48.691 --> 45:51.914
And that one pertussis vaccine maker literally said, we're out.

45:52.174 --> 45:53.615
We're not making pertussis vaccine.

45:53.916 --> 45:56.478
We were about to lose pertussis vaccine for America's children.

45:56.818 --> 46:05.047
until the Reagan administration stepped in, set up the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which contained the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which at least stopped the bleeding.

46:05.328 --> 46:11.034
But we went from 18 vaccine makers in 1980 to four by the end of the decade, and the same thing could happen here.

46:11.795 --> 46:15.076
Could RFK disable this vaccine compensation program?

46:15.676 --> 46:16.056
Yes.

46:16.557 --> 46:20.538
And Elizabeth Warren said that during the second Senate confirmation hearing.

46:20.598 --> 46:26.180
She listed the things he could do to the vaccine injury compensation program to make vaccines all the more unaffordable.

46:26.260 --> 46:31.642
Right now, every dose of vaccine comes with a 75 cent federal excise tax.

46:32.502 --> 46:37.065
which goes into this vaccine injury compensation program, which right now has probably $3 billion in it.

46:37.325 --> 46:42.627
So the MMR vaccine, which is a three-component vaccine, that's a $2.25 federal excise tax.

46:43.148 --> 46:47.010
So there's enough money in it to compensate what are real vaccine injuries.

46:47.050 --> 46:50.371
I mean, the oral polio vaccine could cause polio, and so that is true.

46:50.791 --> 46:55.434
The rotavirus vaccines, both Rotatech or Rotarix, are rare causes of intussusception.

46:55.574 --> 46:57.475
So one can reasonably be compensated.

46:57.515 --> 46:57.715
I think

46:59.172 --> 47:20.326
It's a wonderfully malevolent script that he's on because while Robert F. Kennedy Jr., following the script already of Andrew Wakefield in the UK, can be seen sometimes arguing for not so many vaccines on one trip, single vaccine, something that again was argued by Andrew Wakefield a decade and a half, two decades ago.

47:21.867 --> 47:28.912
It's remarkable how little progress has been made until you realize that that lack of progress was precisely necessary

47:29.772 --> 47:39.857
in order that no useful resistance to compliance, no useful resistance to acceptance of intramuscular injection as medicine.

47:41.017 --> 47:49.121
And then now they're just going to debate about what kind of things, what kind of combination of substances are the most appropriate to administer intramuscularly.

47:49.561 --> 47:52.943
And that already presupposes that that's medicine and it's not.

47:54.335 --> 48:07.308
It is antithetical to everything that we understand about our body and our biology, and even worse, it is extremely antithetical to the biology that none of these people acknowledge.

48:09.676 --> 48:14.098
When you mandate vaccines for a population, it's reasonable to have a pop-off valve like this.

48:14.639 --> 48:21.562
But make autism on the list, put that on the list of compensable injuries and you'll exhaust this program.

48:21.622 --> 48:28.105
The federal excise tax would only become higher and higher and companies will be left with the choice of whether they really still wanted to make this product.

48:29.226 --> 48:36.950
This study that you suggest he might do on autism, presumably this won't be published anywhere because it will be so flawed.

48:38.078 --> 48:38.218
Right.

48:38.238 --> 48:46.042
Well, he's already done things like questioned the New England Journal of Medicine, considered suing the New England Journal of Medicine because he believes they're all part of that conspiracy.

48:46.102 --> 48:48.283
I mean, I just think he can hold it.

48:48.323 --> 48:49.843
First of all, you can publish anything anywhere.

48:50.323 --> 48:52.504
I really think that these people are exhausted.

48:53.265 --> 48:55.426
I don't think they expected it to go this far.

48:55.566 --> 49:02.649
I'm starting to feel as though they think and thought that the anti-vax movement and its contribution to

49:03.587 --> 49:09.209
to the, you know, what would happen during the pandemic was something they could sneeze at.

49:09.249 --> 49:10.350
It wasn't a big deal.

49:12.290 --> 49:26.756
And I think that one of the reasons why Brandy Vaughn needed to be offed was because at the start of the pandemic, she was very skeptical of these people, very skeptical of their act and very skeptical of their motives.

49:28.345 --> 49:46.512
And we have watched much video of them from before the pandemic and at the opening of the pandemic, where you two and I have become very skeptical of their motives, especially because in my experience with them in CHD and working for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., there's something incongruent with what's going on here.

49:48.490 --> 49:50.653
I think, honestly, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:50.713 --> 49:58.122
is behind a wall of people that keeps him insulated from the truth, keeps him on narrative, uses him more or less like a Truman Show puppet.

49:59.183 --> 50:05.511
He's a victim of these people, and they hoped that I would just kind of go along with it, you know, because everybody on the bus is having fun.

50:10.404 --> 50:21.389
But this is a long con that Mary Holland and Paul Offit and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone have been in on for a couple decades, more or less.

50:22.089 --> 50:39.277
And with regard to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., somewhere between 2016 and 2018, they convinced him to stop focusing exclusively on environmentalism, but we're gonna need you to also absorb this health freedom movement on your way toward the White House.

50:40.998 --> 50:44.441
And they enlisted everybody, everybody they could.

50:45.863 --> 50:53.990
And I'm afraid, I am very afraid that the sort of resume that Brian Hooker has suggests very much

50:55.406 --> 50:59.250
that he could have been part of this for a very, very long time.

50:59.811 --> 51:16.828
His connections to the Human Genome Project and those technologies and those motivations and the government itself cannot be overlooked at this stage in the same way that Mary Holland's resume with three years in Russia and a family relative that works for the CDC or the NIH

51:17.568 --> 51:20.851
And David Martin, who has a brother that works at the CDC.

51:20.891 --> 51:23.914
These are not, these are no longer dismissible.

51:24.955 --> 51:31.441
They are part of a very succinct list of reasons why these people are on one team.

51:32.101 --> 51:42.070
And it is one national security theater team designed to make sure that there is no useful resistance to compliance in the future.

51:42.090 --> 51:43.872
And they may have failed miserably.

51:44.693 --> 51:45.714
during the pandemic.

51:45.774 --> 51:52.343
It may have been much more successful in other places in the world, but in America, they may have failed.

51:52.543 --> 51:57.609
They may be nowhere near where they want to be, but could they tell us that if that was true?

51:58.050 --> 51:59.852
Could they belie that if that was true?

51:59.872 --> 52:00.313
No, they cannot.

52:03.567 --> 52:26.771
And so more important than ever, people need to absorb this message and understand it, so that they understand how important it is to spread the true biology of the PCR test, of the population pyramid, of sequencing, of DNA and evolution, and of the role of microbiome, the microbiome, whatever they're going to try and pigeonhole call it.

52:29.141 --> 52:33.324
We need to teach our children this and show it to them as quickly as possible.

52:33.504 --> 52:43.392
And what you can also see here, as I just kind of ramble on, is that no one from the left is coming to us and saying, wow, you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:43.452 --> 52:49.957
and Jay Bhattacharya and this Marty McCary guy are all a part of an elaborate joke on America?

52:50.017 --> 52:50.738
Tell us more.

52:51.538 --> 52:52.359
Nobody's calling.

52:53.260 --> 53:01.165
Everybody that could want to discredit the Trump administration for allowing these people in is not calling me to find out what I know.

53:01.965 --> 53:14.213
Even if they called me and found out what I know was not what they wanted to say, it's odd that they're not calling unless they're all part of the same scripted bullshit.

53:15.353 --> 53:16.234
I mean, there's probably

53:16.733 --> 53:23.537
after about 8,000 papers published a day in the medical and scientific literature, and they follow a bell-shaped curve.

53:23.557 --> 53:26.739
Some papers are great, some are awful, most are more or less mediocre.

53:26.759 --> 53:27.800
You can get anything published.

53:27.840 --> 53:32.643
I mean, he can publish anything, and then I just think he'll hold it up and say, see, I was right all along.

53:32.863 --> 53:35.345
The thing that bugs me, of the many things that bug me on this,

53:36.045 --> 53:38.387
We've been funding autism for 20 years.

53:38.467 --> 53:44.313
I mean, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that are spent every year by the federal government to study autism.

53:44.333 --> 53:48.757
We now have the Autism Cares Act, which gives another $2 billion over the next five years.

53:48.997 --> 53:50.038
And we've learned a lot.

53:50.318 --> 53:56.424
We've learned about the genetics of autism, and it's just not one gene, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.

53:56.464 --> 54:01.108
It's many genes, but they're developmental genes expressed early in pregnancy.

54:02.149 --> 54:07.172
There are certainly drugs one can take during pregnancy that increases your risk of autism, like valproic acid.

54:07.653 --> 54:14.658
There are maternal factors like psychiatric disorders or obesity or diabetes, which can influence the incidence of autism.

54:14.999 --> 54:17.140
Maternal and paternal age both can do that.

54:17.420 --> 54:19.762
Intrauterine infections can increase your risk of autism.

54:20.143 --> 54:22.224
All of those, though, occur before you're born.

54:22.524 --> 54:29.450
So I think the odds... And so the idea is that intramuscular injection is a fine way to administer medicine

54:31.090 --> 54:37.574
and there are vulnerabilities to, you know, circumstances that cause autism.

54:37.694 --> 54:50.762
Now, if I'm right, and autism is a myth to disguise and make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, then this would fit right in that pocket pretty well.

54:52.203 --> 54:54.044
It fits right in that pocket.

54:56.465 --> 55:18.705
Because if you think that all these different things, genes and environmental stuff and whatever during pregnancy, you know, interrupting the trajectory across time is happening during pregnancy or is genetic, then you'll never ascribe the ridiculousness of intramuscular injection to the cause.

55:19.807 --> 55:22.829
because you just think intramuscular injection is normal.

55:22.929 --> 55:31.113
It's like a normal thing, even though that is the most egregious violation of our biology that you can imagine.

55:31.293 --> 55:35.195
It's not even the same thing as putting something in somebody's butt, right?

55:35.375 --> 55:36.695
That's not the same.

55:37.416 --> 55:39.737
It's not the same as feeding a baby that.

55:39.857 --> 55:41.778
It's not the same as feeding the mom that.

55:41.818 --> 55:43.679
It's not the same as putting it in mom's butt.

55:44.818 --> 55:59.781
Intramuscular injection into the mom during pregnancy and putting it in her bloodstream slowly or quickly, that is the worst way to violate that biology.

56:02.356 --> 56:21.085
And in this discussion, that is an absolute presupposition of this discussion is that intramuscular injection is a fine way to administer a combination of substances in order to medicate a healthy human, a healthy pregnant woman, or a newborn child.

56:23.795 --> 56:33.322
This is scripted bullshit that is not usefully challenged by Dell Bigtree saying, so do you think any vaccines are any good?

56:35.463 --> 56:42.488
Well, you know, I mean, the yellow fever vaccine is pretty great, but it's also hot, you know, it's real hot, it's a hot vaccine.

56:42.508 --> 56:48.652
Or looking at all the data, cumulatively, that you're probably born with autism, but he just throws that away.

56:48.852 --> 56:51.594
He says autism is preventable, and I'm going to show you how.

56:53.208 --> 57:02.795
So I will quote Albert Sabin, who said this to me once, here with respect to these studies that you just described.

57:02.916 --> 57:03.716
RFK Jr.

57:04.136 --> 57:07.139
either hasn't read them or doesn't believe them.

57:09.601 --> 57:19.108
Now, I find it interesting that Reagan recognized the value of protecting children's health.

57:19.148 --> 57:21.530
Let's remind everyone, he was a Republican.

57:23.334 --> 57:33.157
So today's Republican Party is very different than it was in the 80s because they seem to be more interested in politics than children's health.

57:34.197 --> 57:34.477
You're right.

57:34.497 --> 57:44.941
I mean, certainly Reagan's administration was not known for its social programs, but here you have a very important social program that protected vaccines and therefore protected children in this country.

57:45.001 --> 57:45.881
And I just feel like

57:46.582 --> 57:47.942
Where are the Republicans now?

57:48.323 --> 57:58.125
How much more information do you need that this man, RFK Jr., is doing everything he can to make vaccines less available, less affordable, and more feared?

57:58.145 --> 58:03.427
There's an old expression, which is, if everybody shows a little courage, no one has to be a hero.

58:03.627 --> 58:05.988
Stand up for the children of this country, please.

58:07.268 --> 58:12.890
You say in the article that it's possible that he would make vaccines unaffordable or unavailable.

58:13.610 --> 58:13.790
So,

58:15.629 --> 58:16.509
What would happen, Paul?

58:18.150 --> 58:20.631
I think these companies would stop making them.

58:21.051 --> 58:23.652
It is a fragile infrastructure, vaccines.

58:23.692 --> 58:26.793
I mean, there are four companies, for the most part, that make vaccines.

58:26.993 --> 58:34.236
Which, of course, argues against the idea that we're making a lot of money from these, which is what everybody says happened during the pandemic.

58:34.296 --> 58:37.877
But they're ignoring how much money was made from PCR testing.

58:38.561 --> 58:42.003
They're ignoring how much money gets made from lateral flow testing.

58:42.043 --> 58:46.244
They're, they're ignoring how much money gets made from all of this diagnostic stuff.

58:46.665 --> 58:49.586
And they're worried about what the vaccines come on.

58:50.506 --> 58:52.207
Can't you see it for what it is.

58:53.688 --> 59:06.793
Kevin McKernan, for example, always points to all they saw Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer never points to the, how many different EUA granted PCR tests were there in America, more than 220 for the first two years.

59:06.833 --> 59:07.294
That's right.

59:07.334 --> 59:08.054
Ladies and gentlemen,

59:09.076 --> 59:11.738
That's where all the money from Warp Speed went.

59:11.938 --> 59:16.541
Not to the vaccines, ladies and gentlemen, to track and trace companies that don't exist anymore.

59:17.862 --> 59:24.947
To PCR testing companies set up by porn star producers that don't exist anymore.

59:25.848 --> 59:31.052
That tested all the EMTs and firemen and police officers every week.

59:31.934 --> 59:36.836
at the behest of the government at the highest bid, no bid contracts sometimes.

59:37.376 --> 59:37.876
And then what?

59:38.276 --> 59:38.817
They're gone.

59:39.297 --> 59:55.002
And nobody cares about that because they helped to establish this sort of just accepted thing that PCR is a useful diagnostic instead of the FDA regulating each one of those instances as a separate medical device.

59:55.843 --> 59:58.604
That's by design, that's scripted bullshit right there.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.382
For America's children, it's less than 10% of what they can do.

01:00:02.862 --> 01:00:06.104
Make it onerous enough, and they'll leave the market.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.386
Vaccines are given once or a few times in your lifetime.

01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:12.649
They're never gonna compete with things like lipid-lowering agents or psychiatric drugs and neurological drugs.

01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:26.218
See, so what he wants you to believe is that it's not, I mean, obviously, it's not about the money, because the money is in lipid-reducing drugs and in other things, not in vaccines, even though they're giving vaccines to old people like never before.

01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:28.760
My grandma probably never had a vaccine.

01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:30.225
Holy shit.

01:00:31.206 --> 01:00:33.227
But again, it's not about the money.

01:00:33.327 --> 01:00:34.308
It isn't about the money.

01:00:34.348 --> 01:00:36.049
It's definitely not about the money.

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.711
He's right.

01:00:38.851 --> 01:00:40.532
It's definitely not about the money.

01:00:40.792 --> 01:00:45.275
It is about making sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology.

01:00:45.335 --> 01:00:49.197
It's about making sure that virology has never questioned as a science.

01:00:49.638 --> 01:00:53.300
And it's about making sure that public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:58.023
Make it onerous enough and they'll leave because they did.

01:00:58.869 --> 01:01:02.030
We had 27 companies that made vaccines in the mid-1950s.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:07.211
By 1980, it had gone down to 18, mostly through sort of merger and dropout.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:14.132
And then when it was made much more difficult for these companies to make it, you saw companies leave.

01:01:14.152 --> 01:01:15.772
So we had essentially four companies.

01:01:15.832 --> 01:01:18.913
It's the same thing now with the kind of placebo-controlled trials.

01:01:18.933 --> 01:01:21.853
You know, let's consider the fact that, according to R.F.K.

01:01:21.913 --> 01:01:25.214
Jr., that we never did a placebo-controlled trial, which is complete nonsense.

01:01:26.075 --> 01:01:33.788
But he just keeps throwing these things out, these sort of hurdles that companies are going to have to jump through and make it expensive enough, and they won't do it anymore.

01:01:35.852 --> 01:01:37.715
So let's look at a scenario where

01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:49.367
vaccines are not available, maybe childhood vaccines, will have an increase, a huge increase in the amount of infectious diseases in the next few years.

01:01:50.308 --> 01:01:57.294
Will then people realize that his approach is flawed or will he just say there's, he'll blame it on something else?

01:01:58.442 --> 01:01:59.183
So that's the question.

01:01:59.243 --> 01:02:00.804
I mean, how much pain are we willing to take?

01:02:01.004 --> 01:02:03.046
We've had three people die of measles this year.

01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:07.169
That's the total number that died of measles in the last 25 years.

01:02:07.209 --> 01:02:09.090
We've had two childhood deaths.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.012
That's the first child that died.

01:02:11.032 --> 01:02:14.434
It was the first time we've had a child die of measles in this country in more than 20 years.

01:02:15.755 --> 01:02:17.197
We've had a massive outbreak now.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.819
Measles, you have more pertussis.

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:23.404
You have a handful of states that have experienced pertussis deaths that haven't experienced pertussis deaths in years.

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:29.231
You have 216 people with babies, children, children less than 18 who died of influenza.

01:02:29.672 --> 01:02:32.995
That's the most we've seen since 2009, the swine flu pandemic.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:34.957
How much are we willing to take?

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:43.420
I was seeing a pediatrician at a playground recently, because I have my grandchildren here, and she said to me, it's never been worse.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.061
People are just, they don't want vaccines, and they feel emboldened not to get them.

01:02:48.081 --> 01:02:49.322
She said, that's what's different.

01:02:49.742 --> 01:02:53.003
In the past, people have always been questionable about questioning vaccines.

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:59.786
Now, they just are absolutely confident that they're right, because you have basically a power structure now

01:03:00.586 --> 01:03:01.507
that says they're right.

01:03:01.547 --> 01:03:05.349
I mean, the anti-vaccine activists have been shouting from the sideline for decades.

01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:06.810
Now they're making policy.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.491
I guess that answers the question.

01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:22.558
All the measles cases, the deaths, the pertussis, the pediatric influenza deaths, it's still not enough to convince people that they need to be vaccinating their kids.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.539
How interesting is that?

01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:28.762
I mean, how many children need to die in school shootings before we have gun control?

01:03:28.962 --> 01:03:30.904
You would have thought Sandy Hook would have been the end of that.

01:03:31.524 --> 01:03:33.666
Yeah, I mean, that's just unacceptable.

01:03:33.746 --> 01:03:35.147
So many children have died there.

01:03:35.787 --> 01:03:40.030
So we should expect that many, many more have to die from infectious diseases.

01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:46.354
So you write in your letter to Senator Cassidy also what RFK Jr.

01:03:46.515 --> 01:03:48.376
should have been doing during the measles outbreak.

01:03:49.036 --> 01:03:49.777
Can you tell us that?

01:03:50.967 --> 01:03:57.675
What he should have been doing is he should have stood up loudly and clearly and held a press conference every other day saying, this is unacceptable.

01:03:57.715 --> 01:03:58.937
We need to vaccinate our children.

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:02.381
These are deaths that are utterly preventable.

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:04.624
These are hospitalizations that are completely preventable.

01:04:04.724 --> 01:04:06.166
We need to vaccinate our children.

01:04:06.206 --> 01:04:07.508
He's done exactly the opposite.

01:04:08.007 --> 01:04:11.873
He goes on national television and says measles vaccine kills people every year.

01:04:12.374 --> 01:04:14.557
Measles vaccine causes blindness and deafness.

01:04:14.957 --> 01:04:17.681
Measles vaccine causes the same symptoms as measles.

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:23.390
And worse, he goes on to say the measles virus, natural measles infection can protect against cancer.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.190
can protect against autoimmune disease.

01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:30.732
The natural measles gives you lifelong protection, whereas the vaccine induced immunity fades.

01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:31.912
All of that is wrong.

01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:34.273
So he's done the exact opposite.

01:04:34.353 --> 01:04:41.634
It's almost unimaginable, actually, how bad he's been and how the Republicans continue to stand back and let this happen.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:42.875
It's enough.

01:04:43.775 --> 01:04:45.715
It's almost unimaginable.

01:04:45.775 --> 01:04:50.096
Now you're starting to hear the rhetoric that bothers me, that they're ramping it up.

01:04:50.156 --> 01:04:51.337
And it's not anyone.

01:04:51.517 --> 01:04:51.977
It's him.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:05:02.019
The one who in 2015 was opposite Mary Holland on Democracy Now, already setting up this bullshit narrative.

01:05:03.188 --> 01:05:10.613
where Rolling Stone published an article about RFK, about measles in Samoa for setting up this bullshit narrative right here.

01:05:11.214 --> 01:05:26.144
And I'm arguing this bullshit narrative was set in place on purpose because the entire pandemic was a script that required them to be in place before the pandemic started.

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:30.968
Already having herded the most significant cats,

01:05:31.909 --> 01:05:42.253
and maybe even killed some of the most significant cats before the pandemic even started so that there would be no meaningful resistance to compliance.

01:05:42.954 --> 01:05:55.259
And instead, they would control the narrative so that anybody that was making a useful resistance to compliance would be compelled to follow the lab leak narrative long enough so that, again,

01:05:56.189 --> 01:06:09.661
A useful resistance to the acceptance of the existence of the novel virus, the pandemic that was proven by, supported by, and defined by PCR would never be questioned by anyone from Paul Offit to Mary Holland.

01:06:10.482 --> 01:06:11.603
And they have succeeded.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:14.225
It's enough.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:21.171
Surely, as a doctor, as a medical doctor, Senator Cassidy should be recognizing this, right?

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:29.992
Yes, I think Senator Cassidy does recognize this, and I'd like to believe that there are Republicans out there that also do recognize this.

01:06:30.012 --> 01:06:32.814
There's just sort of a lack of political courage these days.

01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:35.717
Now, why would they script this?

01:06:35.777 --> 01:06:42.863
My argument that they would script this is because there's only one time point in history now, as our foreseeable future,

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:49.388
especially if there's going to be a pole shift and stuff, that this genetic diversity will be available.

01:06:49.488 --> 01:06:53.914
This many experimental animals in the form of a human will never exist again.

01:06:55.174 --> 01:07:24.039
And Robert Malone and many other people have already acknowledged that we have run out of useful experiments that we can do in mice and even in monkeys before we're really going to have to do experiments on us if we want to understand our particular molecular biology and some of the tweaking that might be possible with our limited ham-fisted methodology set in order to take control of the evolution of the species.

01:07:24.818 --> 01:07:32.203
And they can take control of the evolution of the species independent of whether or not they are able to achieve what they imagine they can.

01:07:33.143 --> 01:07:39.167
Which is that they imagine right now that they have the technology that's worth building.

01:07:39.969 --> 01:07:57.357
so that they could store a gigantic amount of genetic data in a unified format, because that's also an issue, that would then allow a machine learning algorithm to process this genetic information and access it as it processed it.

01:07:58.769 --> 01:08:13.525
And setting up the computer infrastructure capable of doing that is quite a bit different than setting up the AI computer infrastructure necessary to play a billion games of Go and solve a Japanese game that is based on black and white chips.

01:08:15.046 --> 01:08:32.575
but they do still imagine that if they build the computer infrastructure as big as they can, they build the storage as fast and as accessible and as big as they can in Greenland and elsewhere, that maybe in 10 or 20 years, they will have the computer infrastructure necessary to sample everybody.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:41.520
Maybe because they will already have gotten everybody to implant an Apple chip, but it won't require that.

01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:44.629
Because again, this is just an iteration.

01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:45.990
We are on an iteration.

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:48.312
We are not at the culmination of something.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.993
We are at an inter iteration.

01:08:51.114 --> 01:09:01.021
Don't think for one second that right now they're flipping the switch and everything's going to work and, and suddenly the AI will arise and, and evolution will be mail order.

01:09:01.962 --> 01:09:08.367
No, this is an iteration and this is a step forward for them in their, their mythology.

01:09:08.447 --> 01:09:11.509
And they feel a little more emboldened on certain fronts.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:19.865
But the main illusion is that AI is already there, that's the danger.

01:09:19.925 --> 01:09:31.355
The danger is that social media allows groups of people to act collectively against us in the most malevolent way possible, and that is with collective lying.

01:09:33.297 --> 01:09:40.263
Never before has it been easier for our enemies to get together on social media and pretend

01:09:41.351 --> 01:09:44.073
They are something that they are not and mislead us.

01:09:45.895 --> 01:09:48.036
And that is enough to ruin a culture.

01:09:48.096 --> 01:09:51.799
That is enough to destroy a nation from within.

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:59.245
And that's the reason why X is so important and our use of it is so important and why we have to get off.

01:10:00.538 --> 01:10:14.424
Every X post that I ever make from now on will be designed to encourage people to get off that platform and to realize that that platform allows, exclusively allows people to lie to you in concert.

01:10:15.604 --> 01:10:17.305
It is not a place for the truth.

01:10:18.365 --> 01:10:20.306
It is a place for you to be absorbed.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:23.027
It is a place for your ideas to be absorbed.

01:10:23.527 --> 01:10:27.369
And more importantly, it is a place for movements to be absorbed.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.020
even to be diffused.

01:10:30.741 --> 01:10:31.721
So you gotta get off.

01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:32.961
You just gotta leave.

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:41.144
There's no purpose for being there unless you're gonna go there specifically to support, you know, a message.

01:10:41.364 --> 01:10:48.086
Meaning you go to Mark Kulak's account and you retweet every tweet that he did yesterday and then you leave again.

01:10:48.874 --> 01:10:54.598
That would be a reason to go to X. Maybe to go to X and retweet everything that I tweet.

01:10:55.058 --> 01:10:57.580
If you want to do that, great, but that's it.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.480
Then go away.

01:10:59.761 --> 01:11:03.404
Use your 30,000 thoughts a day on something else.

01:11:04.604 --> 01:11:12.290
That's the best thing I can show you because if this is a script, sorry, let me ask that, say that again.

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:14.231
If this was not a script,

01:11:15.578 --> 01:11:18.680
then this video would have been impossible to exist.

01:11:20.061 --> 01:11:23.543
If this wasn't a script, these videos wouldn't exist.

01:11:24.224 --> 01:11:27.406
If this wasn't a script, this wouldn't make so much sense to you.

01:11:28.607 --> 01:11:32.089
If this wasn't a script, this wouldn't make so much sense to you.

01:11:33.971 --> 01:11:47.444
The pandemics and gain of function are also myths to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:11:49.165 --> 01:11:53.109
If this was not correct, it would not make so much sense to you.

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:59.174
And there is no excuse for us not to have gotten here earlier.

01:12:00.214 --> 01:12:07.220
except that people worked against us collectively on social media, and they are international.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.963
The people who worked against us are international.

01:12:11.023 --> 01:12:12.544
This is scripted bullshit.

01:12:12.744 --> 01:12:15.746
I don't even know really how to characterize this.

01:12:15.967 --> 01:12:19.209
You have Brett Weinstein and his wife, what's Heather?

01:12:19.289 --> 01:12:19.589
Heather.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.850
Haying.

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:21.351
Haying.

01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:22.652
And they're

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.181
I can't tell if they're at a diner in a booth or they're at like some type of.

01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:29.281
In the dark horse basement, I think.

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:29.901
I know.

01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:30.121
Yeah.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:33.102
Oh, that's like a, just a green screen or something like that behind them.

01:12:34.162 --> 01:12:44.984
And, um, this is, uh, I, I really should, should spend more time watching this podcast because I feel like it's like, um, a story of, of people going slowly insane.

01:12:45.004 --> 01:12:52.305
Um, I, I actually think it would be fascinating to take all of their episodes

01:12:54.068 --> 01:12:59.853
string them together on one cut and then do it at like 50 times speed.

01:13:00.093 --> 01:13:05.097
Not that dissimilar to what I've suggested that everybody do for anybody that they think is a hero.

01:13:05.278 --> 01:13:14.285
Put all their contributions to the narrative in a row and see if you see someone growing to understand the trap we're in.

01:13:16.027 --> 01:13:20.991
Or see if you see someone defining it, refining it,

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:25.226
making sure that you never usefully escape it.

01:13:26.087 --> 01:13:34.313
That's what this Seinfeld, Alex Berenson wannabe soundalike is doing.

01:13:35.234 --> 01:13:50.065
And this girl, when you listen to her laugh in this video is no different than Julian Michaels with her exasperated expressions of surprise every time somebody says something biological on her podcast.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:54.248
It is the same kind of illusion of consensus.

01:13:54.308 --> 01:13:59.490
These people have a couple people in the background that also laugh whenever they are supposed to laugh.

01:14:02.511 --> 01:14:07.012
And the thing about it is, you know someone's telling the truth when they don't need all of those tricks.

01:14:08.174 --> 01:14:14.342
and they don't need a bunch of extra people in the background going, yeah, yeah, I don't have an Ed McMahon on the couch over there.

01:14:14.362 --> 01:14:17.085
Ho, ho, ho, you're so funny, Jay.

01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:20.910
Ho, you're so right about that, Jay boy, were you right on?

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:24.455
But that's what happens on all of these podcasts.

01:14:26.687 --> 01:14:37.071
And it's not because they're all following the same good model of modern online journalism and thought and critical thinking.

01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:43.053
It's because they're all following the same militarized model of social control.

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:48.401
and just watch how slowly, you know, they actually do.

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:49.721
Like a time-lapse of insanity?

01:14:49.741 --> 01:14:51.703
Yeah, no, but opposite, yeah, of a therapist.

01:14:51.803 --> 01:14:52.323
Exactly.

01:14:53.624 --> 01:15:02.930
But here's Brett Weinstein speculating that Callie and Casey Means, who apparently were RFK Junior surrogates,

01:15:05.715 --> 01:15:09.657
might be a some type of a plant.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:10.098
Right.

01:15:10.558 --> 01:15:12.899
Now, Kennedy's vice president.

01:15:13.599 --> 01:15:13.940
Yes.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.480
Nominee.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:20.683
She said she was pissed about this, too, because she said she was promised that they would not be appointed.

01:15:21.124 --> 01:15:27.907
Now, I guess it's because supposedly they're not as anti Vax as Kennedy.

01:15:29.008 --> 01:15:38.901
would let on now this is and she said like nicole what's her last name shanahan she i think it's most likely that this yoho doesn't understand that this guy is in on it

01:15:41.018 --> 01:15:42.259
probably scripted.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:48.403
He might be the only one on his staff who's in on it because most of the people that he works with are quite a bit younger than him.

01:15:49.484 --> 01:15:56.348
And so you kind of see the same thing that Pauly Tommy and Mary Holland are doing with a lot of the young people that follow CHD.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:16:02.692
It's a bamboozlement that works really well as long as Mary Holland and Pauly Tommy are both in on it.

01:16:03.817 --> 01:16:17.300
and they occasionally bring in somebody else who doesn't need to be in on it, as long as they're too in awe or starstruck of Polly and Mary, you know, being the long outspoken heroes that they are, to ever speak out against them or doubt them.

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:24.566
It's a scripted bullshit narrative that we are trapped in and we need all the help we can get, getting out.

01:16:24.786 --> 01:16:28.408
It was like, I don't know what forces are forcing Bobby to do this.

01:16:28.468 --> 01:16:33.891
Like there always has to be like some other answer that isn't the obvious one.

01:16:34.771 --> 01:16:45.917
But it's, I get, so the one, one of the means people is a, she went to Stanford Medical School is what I read, but she dropped out in the middle of her residency.

01:16:45.937 --> 01:16:46.677
So she doesn't even,

01:16:46.837 --> 01:17:03.734
So the point is, what I'm trying to illustrate is that the YouTube and the Twitter and the Rumble and everything is weaponized against you so that no matter which way you go, no matter which way you run, you end up running into the same questions and the same debate even if you're on the other side of it.

01:17:04.154 --> 01:17:05.436
Bret Weinstein is great.

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:06.757
Bret Weinstein's an idiot.

01:17:07.317 --> 01:17:08.298
Maha is great.

01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:09.419
Maha is crazy.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:16.824
And it doesn't matter if they're on one side or another until you see that it's a hamster wheel.

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:18.565
There's no way out.

01:17:19.606 --> 01:17:26.210
As long as you keep using social media to try and decide what's right, there is no way out.

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:36.792
You gotta share my stream via email with you, the people that you love, and you need to do it regularly or there's no way out.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.574
You need to let your kids see these streams.

01:17:39.754 --> 01:17:41.214
Otherwise, there's no way out.

01:17:41.254 --> 01:17:44.716
You need to teach your kids the true Biology 101.

01:17:44.816 --> 01:17:46.297
Otherwise, there's no way out.

01:17:47.318 --> 01:17:51.821
because these people are scripted bullshitters and they're not going away.

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:56.424
They're gonna continue to get more and more and more subscribers.

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:57.524
That's the way this works.

01:17:57.625 --> 01:17:59.125
And have a degree.

01:17:59.145 --> 01:18:00.266
She doesn't have a degree.

01:18:00.867 --> 01:18:06.290
At one point, she was supposedly at the top of her class in Stanford, but they don't do grades.

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:08.171
They only do pass, fail.

01:18:08.191 --> 01:18:11.513
That's so crazy.

01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:12.074
35 other people.

01:18:12.094 --> 01:18:14.215
Supposedly she wanted to be an academic.

01:18:14.295 --> 01:18:15.396
I mean, who knows?

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:24.355
But she did found Levels, a business based around selling continuous glucose monitors and subscription health tracking app.

01:18:24.395 --> 01:18:30.059
It's so funny how all of these maha people have their own businesses.

01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:30.659
Oh, no, no.

01:18:30.699 --> 01:18:32.881
They're medical entrepreneurs.

01:18:33.922 --> 01:18:41.066
And the funny thing is, is that stories about the DOD killing us all are actually stories that make everybody helpless.

01:18:41.146 --> 01:18:46.430
Because if the government and the DOD are killing us all covertly, then what chance do we have?

01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:50.213
I guess the only chance we have is to buy their supplements.

01:18:52.954 --> 01:18:59.959
And so that's where you can also see that we have been herded into a trap on the populist right in America.

01:19:00.399 --> 01:19:09.225
And if the left wanted to help us out or help us escape, they would enlist the help of the former advisor to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:09.326 --> 01:19:15.850
on the Wuhan cover-up book and break this narrative, except they're in on it.

01:19:22.461 --> 01:19:44.720
is well established, but I'll tell you something, if this whole arc of this season ends up with Kennedy as a secret pharmaceutical lobbyist, I mean, my kids cried when they heard Big Pharma is going to make more in Europe.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.742
The Fauci is coming from inside the house.

01:19:49.625 --> 01:20:03.736
One of the things that seems to be happening is that there, I think predictably, are a number of wedge issues emerging to drive the coalition.

01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:08.039
Don't forget that this guy's dad worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:20:07.999 --> 01:20:16.225
's dad during the formation of the FDA, along with Senator Estes Kefauver, who died in the Senate three weeks before Robert F. Kennedy was killed.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:22.770
I think Senator Kefauver wanted a much stronger FDA, but he got what he got.

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:25.531
And thalidomide was involved in that.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:29.252
His dad was involved in the thalidomide scandal back then.

01:20:30.152 --> 01:20:39.955
His dad was the first intellectual property lawyer to work in the Department of Justice, and he was in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy, the dad of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:46.898
His brother is an advisor to Peter Thiel and Thiel Capital.

01:20:48.885 --> 01:21:01.368
Peter Thiel is also the owner of PayPal with Elon Musk and also the owner of Palantir and Arcturus in Canada that was involved in the production of the mRNA or the lipid nanoparticle.

01:21:01.428 --> 01:21:04.269
And some of that might be wrong, but it doesn't matter because it's close.

01:21:05.389 --> 01:21:10.231
There's no explanation for this guy rising other than he is a puppet, a player in this.

01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:15.292
He might not even know that he's about to be thrown under the bus in some sects of America.

01:21:15.612 --> 01:21:18.113
He might be fine with it because it feels good to be a rebel.

01:21:19.147 --> 01:21:26.303
but he is part of the controlled demolition of American culture that's going to happen on social media if we don't get off of it.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:32.200
crazy as it attempts to get its footing in the new administration.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.360
Oh, pause it for one second.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:45.623
I should just tell you, if you read the decoder key that comes with every episode of this, you'll find out by coalition, he means him and his wife.

01:21:45.703 --> 01:21:47.223
And maybe his brother, too.

01:21:47.283 --> 01:21:50.464
A coalition of my personal family, my nuclear family.

01:21:50.624 --> 01:21:51.804
And how much my phone is ringing.

01:21:52.844 --> 01:21:58.188
And can I I want to just we didn't say fully Casey means was being nominated for Surgeon General.

01:21:58.228 --> 01:22:00.210
Yes Oh, yes, and I said she doesn't have a degree.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:05.593
That's not I meant she doesn't have a license So she got her degree, but wasn't licensed after going through her residency.

01:22:05.673 --> 01:22:11.838
So either way she's not Equal to be not have your medical license to be the Surgeon General.

01:22:11.858 --> 01:22:13.519
Oh boy, but keep going.

01:22:13.579 --> 01:22:14.740
That's not Brett's problem Yeah

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:25.682
a number of wedge issues emerging to drive the coalition crazy as it attempts to get its footing in the new administration.

01:22:26.082 --> 01:22:40.445
The fissure that has developed surrounds the fact that, suspiciously to many of us, in all of what is said by the Means siblings, and I wish there was an easier way to refer to them,

01:22:41.645 --> 01:22:55.098
awkward construction with mean siblings, very focused on food, and strangely not focused on the lessons of COVID and pharmaceuticals, especially the dangers of the mRNA vaccines.

01:22:55.658 --> 01:22:58.581
And that is giving many of us alarm.

01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:01.003
That's a fissure, a predictable one.

01:23:01.023 --> 01:23:03.085
First off,

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:23.891
The implication is that there's somehow like forces outside of like MAGA that are acting upon this and it's a predictable fissure that Kennedy would bring in a somebody who's obsessed with food as opposed to being obsessed with.

01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:31.133
Now are you absolutely, can you possibly believe that these people on the left couldn't see this?

01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:36.140
That they couldn't say, hey guys on the right, Kennedy played you.

01:23:36.861 --> 01:23:40.606
He said that he was gonna be anti-vaccine, but can't you see he's actually not?

01:23:42.468 --> 01:23:44.871
Can you actually believe that he doesn't see that?

01:23:45.745 --> 01:23:53.907
that he doesn't see that as an opening to wake these people up to the illusion of the Trump administration and to what the play really is.

01:23:53.967 --> 01:23:55.668
He was just joking five minutes ago.

01:23:56.068 --> 01:24:00.009
Wouldn't it be hilarious if Kennedy turns out to be a big pharma plant after all?

01:24:00.409 --> 01:24:04.931
But then now he's not gonna go on with that same construction in his head.

01:24:05.131 --> 01:24:09.572
And to explain this, that's a pretty parsimonious explanation for these circumstances.

01:24:10.893 --> 01:24:15.534
It's a pretty parsimonious explanation for these circumstances, but he's not gonna say that.

01:24:16.666 --> 01:24:17.808
the plandemic.

01:24:18.088 --> 01:24:18.248
Yep.

01:24:18.268 --> 01:24:19.269
That's how they do it.

01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.910
See?

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.792
They're trying to divide us and it's not... Don't worry.

01:24:23.113 --> 01:24:24.694
It's simulated opposition.

01:24:24.774 --> 01:24:25.935
Kennedy's not culpable.

01:24:25.995 --> 01:24:27.317
It's somebody making him do it.

01:24:27.357 --> 01:24:28.278
Trump's not culpable.

01:24:28.338 --> 01:24:30.180
It's somebody making him do that too.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:39.068
I like how Trump is also the most powerful person in the world and we should respect him, but he's also completely helpless to be president.

01:24:39.128 --> 01:24:39.889
It's very interesting.

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:48.136
The forces were up against are just huge and so they don't they they don't see it They don't actually want the right to wake up.

01:24:48.896 --> 01:25:08.513
They want to just make fun of the right because again, that's the script they're on If they were patriots, they would be trying to save the Americans from these obviously false heroes Save the Americans from these obvious posers, but they're not saying that they love the fact that they get to make fun of them and That's it

01:25:09.352 --> 01:25:17.559
And that's how you can see that this is scripted anti-American bullshit on social media with millions of viewers a week.

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:19.600
It's huge.

01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:20.901
A predictable one.

01:25:21.702 --> 01:25:22.363
And it

01:25:26.118 --> 01:25:30.600
has me thinking a lot about, first of all, is the Fisher even organic?

01:25:31.141 --> 01:25:36.143
There is something interesting about the sudden rise of Callie and Casey means.

01:25:36.623 --> 01:25:37.504
Interesting.

01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:38.704
Nobody knows what it means.

01:25:39.104 --> 01:25:52.831
I'm not going to level any accusations, but it is interesting that these two came from relative obscurity and find themselves at the pinnacle of Maha in a position to advance a very important case.

01:25:55.532 --> 01:26:08.557
Like, everybody in that community didn't come out of, like, relative obscurity, and all they did, one video where they basically said that, you know, a vaccine harmed them or eating some food.

01:26:08.577 --> 01:26:09.857
Here's some magnets that clean your blood.

01:26:10.117 --> 01:26:10.818
Exactly.

01:26:12.378 --> 01:26:17.400
Collodial silver, but this time with a minty, fresh aftertaste.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.741
It's not by accident that they're able to ridicule them so easily.

01:26:21.781 --> 01:26:22.762
It is by design.

01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:35.060
And if you don't understand how people are ridiculing your side of the equation because social media doesn't show it to you, we are getting to a very critical point in America.

01:26:36.961 --> 01:26:39.442
That's what X is capable of doing.

01:26:39.502 --> 01:26:40.962
That's what YouTube can do.

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:48.284
If you use it skillfully, you can essentially be unaware that you're not making any progress.

01:26:48.344 --> 01:26:49.905
In fact, you're being made fun of.

01:26:51.653 --> 01:27:00.438
by the other side and very, very aptly made fun of because of the people they put in front of us.

01:27:01.599 --> 01:27:06.722
The people that are now essentially representing us on social media.

01:27:07.263 --> 01:27:14.487
That is by design because the culture of America will be destroyed using that mythology created on social media.

01:27:16.834 --> 01:27:27.737
And the only reason why that mythology holds is because when they show the president or national security advisors the stats from social media, everybody's using it.

01:27:30.858 --> 01:27:42.061
The only reason why this works is because when they show our leaders the stats from social media, everybody's using it, which means that social media is in control.

01:27:45.151 --> 01:27:46.872
which means it has bargaining power.

01:27:49.194 --> 01:27:50.775
It could even have blackmail power.

01:27:52.156 --> 01:27:59.081
But more importantly than anything else for your understanding of what's going on, it has national security value.

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:02.784
It has national security value.

01:28:03.885 --> 01:28:06.507
Podcasts have national security value.

01:28:06.607 --> 01:28:07.508
And so they have,

01:28:08.396 --> 01:28:15.638
Hey, they have taken control of podcasting and they have put podcasters out there in huge numbers.

01:28:18.158 --> 01:28:20.499
And we are up against everything right now.

01:28:21.479 --> 01:28:23.680
There's only a few good guys left.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:29.021
Everything else is just fluff on the media, including these people.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:33.042
He's so mad he doesn't have an official position.

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:35.043
Both the Weinstein brothers.

01:28:35.083 --> 01:28:37.565
I feel like they're interchangeable in terms of their complaints.

01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:49.034
What is this draw for people who are podcasters to make 80% of their content about their own personal aggrievement in very, very thinly veiled segments?

01:28:49.534 --> 01:28:51.315
I mean, let's face it.

01:28:51.395 --> 01:28:54.958
We're sitting here with a camera on us for half the day with a microphone.

01:28:54.978 --> 01:29:00.322
Finding people with a little bit of a sense of centering themselves is probably not that difficult.

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:01.102
I understand.

01:29:01.162 --> 01:29:06.186
It's just that it's the difference between having an awareness.

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:06.686
Yes.

01:29:09.358 --> 01:29:10.599
Listen, I gotta be honest with you.

01:29:10.639 --> 01:29:14.723
I've been very, very upset that no one from the administration has contacted me.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:19.607
Are these wedge issues organic that they keep throwing at me and separating from my friends?

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:24.851
I don't care how you get there.

01:29:24.871 --> 01:29:27.533
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:29:27.553 --> 01:29:33.738
The goal is to win.

01:29:34.999 --> 01:29:36.340
What time is it?

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.101
Game time!

01:29:38.635 --> 01:29:39.257
Washington.

01:29:39.638 --> 01:29:40.059
Lincoln.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.102
Jackson.

01:29:41.564 --> 01:29:42.988
Susan B. Anthony.

01:30:16.279 --> 01:30:23.084
Underneath the dim lights in a dirty hall, a woman stands her back against the wall.

01:30:23.144 --> 01:30:29.228
Back at home, her kids to feed, so she lives off someone's greed.

01:30:29.328 --> 01:30:32.531
People will do anything, anything, all those

01:30:42.127 --> 01:30:57.248
Some people build and dine and dance Then trade lives, given half a chance Empires built on someone's gold Don't think twice while they count the gold People will do anything, anything

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.654
Politicians have a way to get paid.

01:32:12.714 --> 01:32:15.998
Make a stand if a profit can be made.

01:32:16.218 --> 01:32:19.142
Everyone, it's time to pass a plate.

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:21.765
Hurry up, don't be late.

01:32:22.026 --> 01:32:26.211
The people will do anything, anything for those dead presidents.

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:09.308
That's the aquarium rescue unit with Colonel Bruce Hampton on vocals.

01:33:09.508 --> 01:33:11.829
Memory is just, no, that's dead presidents.

01:33:11.849 --> 01:33:12.469
Sorry, my bad.

01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:15.631
Everybody's doing it for the dead presidents, right?

01:33:15.671 --> 01:33:17.331
That's the whole thing.

01:33:17.932 --> 01:33:19.913
Doing it for the dead presidents.

01:33:19.973 --> 01:33:21.093
That's what they say anyway.

01:33:21.153 --> 01:33:22.754
Thanks very much for being here, everybody.

01:33:22.794 --> 01:33:25.415
I'm really, really happy you could join me.

01:33:26.195 --> 01:33:27.116
Why isn't this up?

01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:27.956
Oh, there it is.

01:33:29.396 --> 01:33:29.837
That should work.

01:33:33.869 --> 01:33:34.770
Good morning, everybody.

01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:35.450
Welcome to the show.

01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:39.793
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:33:39.833 --> 01:33:40.974
My name is Jonathan Couey.

01:33:41.034 --> 01:33:44.577
I'm coming to you again from the back of my garage.

01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:50.861
You can find the trail of my tears on National Library of Medicine PubMed.

01:33:51.461 --> 01:33:54.864
You can also, or you should be able to see three presentations I gave

01:33:55.464 --> 01:34:08.396
to Panda, but those are gone and instead those ideas are being recycled very poorly on a substat called Woodhouse 76 where they argue with Claire Craig and Pierre Cory and Mike Eden and Jay Bhattacharya, but not really.

01:34:09.157 --> 01:34:12.480
They're basically just trying to absorb what they can.

01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:18.366
Anyway, these people know who I am, they know what I'm trying to teach and they're ignoring because

01:34:18.866 --> 01:34:20.267
They're part of an elaborate hoax.

01:34:21.087 --> 01:34:26.991
And yeah, if you want to follow me, you can come to stream.gigaohm.bio, share the videos there.

01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:33.915
If you want to communicate with me, you can send an email to gigaohmhq at proton.me, where my wife and I can communicate with you.

01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:36.517
If you want to send something to the house, you got to send it to P.O.

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:38.238
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102.

01:34:40.959 --> 01:34:42.199
And RNA cannot pandemic.

01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:43.600
Intramuscular injections are dumb.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.700
Transfection is a crime.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.300
And the population pyramids are real.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.761
I want to break into a little bit of happy stuff today.

01:34:50.201 --> 01:34:51.902
Or at least good feeling stuff.

01:34:52.382 --> 01:34:53.842
So I'm going to share a couple things with you.

01:34:53.862 --> 01:34:55.863
And we're going to start with that.

01:34:56.683 --> 01:34:58.143
I'm going to try and move over here.

01:35:01.104 --> 01:35:01.924
See if that works.

01:35:01.944 --> 01:35:04.365
Let's see if we can get that in focus.

01:35:04.745 --> 01:35:05.685
I look a little short.

01:35:07.603 --> 01:35:09.584
My stool is a little low, I guess.

01:35:09.724 --> 01:35:10.024
There we go.

01:35:10.044 --> 01:35:11.145
That's a little better.

01:35:12.086 --> 01:35:12.886
Good morning, everybody.

01:35:12.906 --> 01:35:13.546
Welcome to the show.

01:35:13.566 --> 01:35:18.910
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:29.516
On the picture here, we see Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway, on board the attack transport Dorothea L. Dix.

01:35:30.603 --> 01:35:34.766
on the way to observe the assault on Omaha Beach on June 6th, 1944.

01:35:34.926 --> 01:35:49.876
It's an interesting photograph with respect to the idea that I assume a lot of those guys are gonna die unless they're on some boat that he's on that's not actually gonna storm the beach.

01:35:50.136 --> 01:35:58.582
It's a crazy photograph that I stumbled upon because as I told you the other day in one of my streams,

01:35:59.623 --> 01:36:01.965
I'm a binoculars fan.

01:36:02.565 --> 01:36:12.955
I collect optics ever since, gee I don't know, certainly ever since I became an academic biologist and worked on microscopes I realized that

01:36:13.613 --> 01:36:14.794
optics are something I liked.

01:36:14.854 --> 01:36:17.855
But since I was a little kid, I've also been fascinated by cameras.

01:36:18.696 --> 01:36:30.482
And I spent an exorbitant amount of money when I was a young man on a new camera that I carried around everywhere for a couple years, burning a lot of film on bad photographs, but learning the real way.

01:36:30.502 --> 01:36:32.783
And it's still a passion of mine.

01:36:33.944 --> 01:36:38.987
And I wanted to share a piece from my collection because I actually have

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.662
this binocular that Hemingway is holding there.

01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:58.390
Now my argument for getting yourself an old pair of binoculars from eBay or something like that is that if you're not used to using binoculars, you're not already a fan of them, you might be unaware at how much they can change your perspective.

01:36:59.371 --> 01:37:06.495
A very good pair of binoculars can be breathtaking in some respects, especially if you use them in the right place or for the right thing.

01:37:07.496 --> 01:37:10.017
And so I find them to be an extraordinary thing.

01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:13.718
And I find the history of optics very interesting.

01:37:13.778 --> 01:37:16.999
I find the patents in optics very, very interesting.

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:26.803
And these glasses that Hemingway is holding there are actually glasses that are a result of a patent

01:37:28.206 --> 01:37:34.829
not being owned by Carl Zeiss in Germany when they were the king of optical patents.

01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:47.815
One of the reasons why I like the company Nippon Kagaku is because they are the company that would eventually become Nikon, but also because the history of

01:37:48.335 --> 01:38:01.549
The interaction between Germany and Japan involves the exchange of or the offering of optics manufacturing and optics secrets.

01:38:02.952 --> 01:38:04.492
to the Japanese army.

01:38:04.592 --> 01:38:11.874
And essentially, you know, the Germans were making binoculars and telescopes, binoculars in particular, that nobody else could make.

01:38:12.815 --> 01:38:23.197
And this was a big advantage, especially in the Navy, where being able to see off into the distance and know what's out there and be able to read things or whatever, this is all vital.

01:38:24.037 --> 01:38:26.678
And so part of the exchange occurred there.

01:38:26.858 --> 01:38:29.839
And so a lot of what that precursor company

01:38:30.539 --> 01:38:35.422
And Japan has as far as optics knowledge comes originally from that collaboration.

01:38:35.882 --> 01:38:42.106
And so in Germany in the late 20s, so we're talking about 1926-27.

01:38:43.387 --> 01:38:56.715
There was a time when a patent was given to another German company where they figured out a way to reduce the number of air glass interfaces inside of their binoculars by almost half.

01:38:57.663 --> 01:39:06.150
And the trick was to put glass together, and a new way of putting glass together in different orientations so that there were less glass-air interfaces.

01:39:06.230 --> 01:39:09.793
Why do you want less glass interfaces between air and glass?

01:39:10.233 --> 01:39:12.735
You can kind of see it already on the eyepieces here.

01:39:13.216 --> 01:39:18.120
Anytime there is an air-glass interface, there's going to be a certain amount of light that gets lost

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:22.304
Because instead of passing through the lens, it reflects off of its surface.

01:39:22.864 --> 01:39:34.816
And so the least number of air glass interfaces that you can have, sorry, inside of here bouncing around, then the less light you lose when you look through the objective.

01:39:35.117 --> 01:39:39.801
And so in case you're not familiar with binoculars, they're really, really simple.

01:39:39.862 --> 01:39:40.802
You have an objective.

01:39:41.763 --> 01:39:44.465
Here and then you have I believe this is called.

01:39:45.066 --> 01:39:49.049
Well, I think this is called the objective This could be the objective and this is the eyepiece.

01:39:49.089 --> 01:40:01.338
It doesn't really matter what you call them Well, it does because somebody who knows would know the right word But it's one of the other the more important thing to understand is that the magnification is the first number So these are for example 8 by 24.

01:40:02.499 --> 01:40:08.063
So the objective is an 8x objective It's a magnifying you getting you 8x

01:40:09.361 --> 01:40:16.186
eight times closer to the image, the image will look eight times closer is the best way to say it.

01:40:16.606 --> 01:40:22.511
And then the the objective, I think it's the objective, the objective lens is 24 millimeters.

01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:26.033
So that means that you're going to get a certain amount of light if this was 100.

01:40:27.194 --> 01:40:33.340
was like 8 by 100, then this would be a 100 millimeter objective and that would allow you to get a lot more light in.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:44.049
And so, you basically know everything about binoculars then and usually you get between 6, 7, 8, 10 is really the limit to holding something usefully steady.

01:40:44.069 --> 01:40:51.236
You got to have really steady hands to use something above 10 without a tripod or a tree to lean against.

01:40:51.776 --> 01:40:53.337
So why am I talking about all this?

01:40:53.397 --> 01:40:58.321
Well, number one, because I want to clear your mind of all that nonsense that I started the stream with.

01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:02.623
But more importantly, I wanted you to see this picture for what it is.

01:41:02.724 --> 01:41:08.127
Because it's complete, it's absolutely and totally complete propaganda.

01:41:09.028 --> 01:41:16.073
Because the way that these glasses function is that this is the storage flat

01:41:17.045 --> 01:41:20.347
These were, this is from the first run in 1927.

01:41:20.787 --> 01:41:22.969
There are only 500 of these on earth.

01:41:23.009 --> 01:41:28.332
And I bet you this is, I bet you this is one of the best quality examples that exists on earth.

01:41:29.253 --> 01:41:33.075
And then there was a second run and that second run is what you see there.

01:41:34.596 --> 01:41:37.218
And that, they both work the same though.

01:41:38.579 --> 01:41:43.222
In order for you to look through these, you need to bend them out of the position of,

01:41:44.388 --> 01:41:47.129
storage and into a position where you can look through them.

01:41:48.389 --> 01:41:54.790
And so by definition, not only is that thing not around his neck, but it's also not in the viewing position.

01:41:55.770 --> 01:42:01.111
So he's not looking where they're going and then laughing with, hey, we're about to kick some ass.

01:42:02.231 --> 01:42:05.712
Or, you know, wow, sure looks like there's a lot of machine guns there guys.

01:42:06.632 --> 01:42:09.533
And so it's an interesting photo because it is,

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:21.588
I stumbled upon this when I was trying to reread the history of the optics of this thing and try to understand whether or not the prisms in here were also in a different Japanese one.

01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:26.952
And I stumbled upon a website that had this picture and I just was stunned.

01:42:29.954 --> 01:42:35.738
Again, because it just seems to be kind of a reminder that we have been played for a very, very long time.

01:42:37.412 --> 01:42:48.095
and that the way that we are played is by coordinated acceptance of a narrative, coordinated acceptance of a lie, coordinated acceptance and reinforcement of a lie.

01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:55.396
And if you can think of it as a national security priority where it's for the good of the country, then lying is okay.

01:42:56.417 --> 01:43:02.138
If you can think of it as somebody else is going to do it, if I don't do it, so I might as well take advantage of the opportunity, I guess everything's okay.

01:43:04.085 --> 01:43:07.887
If you have a lust for power and fame, maybe everything's okay.

01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:11.670
But people with principles don't get caught in this.

01:43:13.351 --> 01:43:18.413
And I just wanted to give a shout out to somebody who I think is a real person on YouTube.

01:43:19.974 --> 01:43:23.997
And more importantly, a real person that has decided that it's just too much.

01:43:24.037 --> 01:43:25.318
And I think that's by design.

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:29.617
that social media would destroy a guy like this.

01:43:30.157 --> 01:43:31.479
And so I wanted to share this with you.

01:43:31.519 --> 01:43:33.381
There's a lot of content from this dude.

01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.323
It's called Outdoor Boys.

01:43:35.763 --> 01:43:39.387
And it's a guy who his family lives in, I believe in Alaska.

01:43:40.388 --> 01:43:44.051
We've followed them since they were little, little baby kids out in the woods.

01:43:44.812 --> 01:43:47.675
And I think this guy is just a really cool dude.

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:49.837
And the video kind of

01:43:50.718 --> 01:43:52.540
For whatever reason, it kind of breaks my heart.

01:43:53.081 --> 01:43:56.945
But it also tells you that real on the internet is going away.

01:43:57.826 --> 01:43:58.987
It definitely is going to go away.

01:43:59.007 --> 01:44:12.982
Hey everyone, this is going to be my last video for a little while.

01:44:13.683 --> 01:44:16.484
Now I've been making YouTube videos for 11 years now.

01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:20.707
First with the Catfish and Carp YouTube channel, then with this, the Outdoor Boys YouTube channel.

01:44:20.947 --> 01:44:24.869
And believe it or not, I've made 1,110 videos.

01:44:25.449 --> 01:44:30.572
And just to give a plug out to my friend Mark Kulak, I think he's made about that many too.

01:44:31.912 --> 01:44:36.714
And I've been working for many, many years and not reached 15 million anything.

01:44:37.474 --> 01:44:48.537
Now, I understand that Mark is not doing survival videos in nude igloos or taking his kids out into the wilderness and risking their lives in the swamps.

01:44:50.998 --> 01:44:58.260
But the amount of work that this guy has done, a thousand videos and the editing of it, I can get my head around that.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.741
And I can have a lot of respect for it.

01:45:01.613 --> 01:45:07.836
But I think he started at a time when, as I would suggest with AI, everything was just okay.

01:45:09.237 --> 01:45:10.978
AI might work for a little while.

01:45:11.158 --> 01:45:13.900
AI might seem powerful and harmless for a little while.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:21.484
As soon as they decide not to let you have it anymore, it will be taken away.

01:45:21.584 --> 01:45:28.708
As soon as they decide to flip the switch on social media and have it be absolutely enslaving, they can do it.

01:45:30.546 --> 01:45:32.167
And so it's just a matter of time.

01:45:32.227 --> 01:45:33.688
There's no question about it.

01:45:33.848 --> 01:45:37.530
All the real is going to go away unless we actively maintain it.

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:41.592
And in fact, take it off of their networks and build our own.

01:45:42.112 --> 01:45:46.094
If we take it off and build our own, then maybe it will be okay.

01:45:46.994 --> 01:45:49.856
But until then, it will be like this.

01:45:51.408 --> 01:45:52.268
It's been a wild ride.

01:45:52.769 --> 01:45:57.852
The amount of time and energy that I've dedicated to making YouTube videos is hard to communicate.

01:45:58.432 --> 01:46:10.699
So many late nights editing and packing and unpacking, camping with pneumonia, building log cabins while injured, but it's been a tremendous adventure and it's allowed me to provide for my family while making wonderful memories with my wife and kids.

01:46:11.599 --> 01:46:16.125
But even good things can be taken too far, and I think I'm starting to reach that point.

01:46:16.806 --> 01:46:20.051
But I'm not just talking about the time and energy I spend making YouTube videos.

01:46:20.071 --> 01:46:22.174
I'm also talking about the attention it brings.

01:46:22.674 --> 01:46:26.880
In just the last 18 months, this YouTube channel has gained about 12 million subscribers.

01:46:27.521 --> 01:46:37.048
And because of people stealing my content and posting it on other platforms, my family and I have been viewed about 4 billion times, in addition to the 2.8 billion views on YouTube.

01:46:37.428 --> 01:46:40.971
And no one is stealing my content and putting it elsewhere.

01:46:41.231 --> 01:46:41.751
Nobody.

01:46:43.612 --> 01:46:47.035
Nobody's stealing Mark's content and putting it elsewhere.

01:46:47.095 --> 01:46:49.857
Nobody's using Mark's website to make content.

01:46:58.697 --> 01:47:07.861
The sheer volume of fans trying to contact me, trying to take pictures with me, or just trying to come up and talk to me in public, it could be a bit overwhelming at times.

01:47:08.001 --> 01:47:13.884
And my wife and I, we both have real concerns about what this will do to our family if I keep growing my YouTube channel.

01:47:14.464 --> 01:47:16.745
I will be perfectly honest with you.

01:47:16.785 --> 01:47:20.347
If I ever see him in person, I'm definitely gonna have to tell him.

01:47:22.048 --> 01:47:22.308
I mean,

01:47:24.033 --> 01:47:26.915
I don't know, it's just crazy, what, what, yeah, anyway.

01:47:26.935 --> 01:47:27.475
At this pace.

01:47:28.156 --> 01:47:33.820
And the time to stop is before this problem gets so out of hand that my family and I can't live normal lives.

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:42.666
Now there's more than one reason for making this decision and I still enjoy making videos and I still enjoy going on ventures, but it's time to start focusing on other things.

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.490
And that's what I'm going to be doing.

01:47:44.871 --> 01:47:51.973
For one thing, I've got three little boys who all want to be YouTubers, including my oldest son, Tom, who's got his own channel, the Outdoor Tom YouTube channel.

01:47:52.213 --> 01:47:57.775
But I want to spend more time helping him with his channel and preparing him to be an adult, which is going to be in less than six years.

01:47:58.155 --> 01:48:02.337
But I've spent so much time focusing on me and my family and growing my business.

01:48:02.637 --> 01:48:05.738
It's time to step back and focus on helping other people for a change.

01:48:06.078 --> 01:48:07.499
And I'm excited to see where that takes me.

01:48:07.819 --> 01:48:16.746
But all that being said I have a lot of half-finished videos including the homestead projects and some travel adventures and even some extreme camping trips I've been planning for the last six months.

01:48:17.027 --> 01:48:24.253
But if I decide to finish those videos or if I decide to film any other adventures after today I'll post them at the end of the year all in one big dump.

01:48:25.111 --> 01:48:28.154
But no matter what, this is gonna be my last video for a while.

01:48:28.955 --> 01:48:32.999
Now, I know there's some of you out there who've gotten more than just entertainment from my videos.

01:48:33.279 --> 01:48:37.984
If you feel my videos have helped you in some way, then go out and find someone you can help.

01:48:38.405 --> 01:48:39.206
I'll see you guys later.

01:48:54.722 --> 01:49:23.871
Depths of silence Where echoes remain You were the sunrise And I was the rain A collision of souls Opposing and flat I was the darkness You yearned for the light Now you're gone And I'm losing my mind Losing my mind Losing my mind

01:49:29.241 --> 01:49:34.443
Why did you cut me up, wring me out and leave me high and dry?

01:49:35.503 --> 01:49:54.231
Now you're gone And I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind Now you're gone Why did you cut me up, wring me out and leave me high and dry?

01:50:42.266 --> 01:50:47.512
So if you're looking for a way to waste time on the internet, The Outdoor Boys is really not bad at all.

01:50:47.572 --> 01:50:53.179
I think any of those videos on that channel would be something you'd enjoy and they'll probably still make money from it and I don't care.

01:50:55.583 --> 01:50:59.186
It's just that I want you to understand that there's nothing like that on the internet anymore.

01:50:59.246 --> 01:51:02.028
There are very few people like that on the internet anymore.

01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:04.230
You can go and see something like Blondie Hacks.

01:51:05.231 --> 01:51:07.073
I bet you've never heard of that channel before.

01:51:07.133 --> 01:51:14.159
Blondie Hacks is a real girl, a real lady that does machining in her garage, and she's awesome, but she's not any threat to this.

01:51:15.498 --> 01:51:19.361
She'll last as long as they can use her to keep people on the stream.

01:51:19.521 --> 01:51:29.189
And just like I'll last just as long as I needed to last before they just pretended like I was never there and kept walking, kept doing their play.

01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:33.012
They called me on stage for a little while, made me feel like I had a part.

01:51:33.928 --> 01:51:37.671
But in reality, they were staying right on the script that they always planned.

01:51:39.112 --> 01:51:40.773
And there's there's no other way.

01:51:41.354 --> 01:51:45.057
The only way forward now is insistence.

01:51:45.117 --> 01:51:46.157
And I think he's right.

01:51:46.438 --> 01:51:49.320
I'm calling them transfections rather than the vaccine.

01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:59.045
The only way forward right now is to understand the theater for what it was, to understand how malevolent it was, how they were put in place on purpose, and how now they're sticking to a script.

01:51:59.105 --> 01:52:01.206
...condition that we will not call autism.

01:52:01.346 --> 01:52:02.907
I don't like the word autism.

01:52:03.787 --> 01:52:04.828
He was vaccine damaged.

01:52:05.648 --> 01:52:13.015
And they are still on the script now, even though their champion is in there and they're not getting what they thought they were going to get.

01:52:13.095 --> 01:52:22.123
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:52:22.163 --> 01:52:30.631
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:39.677
And so this narrative was provided by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass helped to push it on CHD with Mary Holland.

01:52:40.278 --> 01:52:44.100
And these organizations are all, they are all sabotaged.

01:52:44.661 --> 01:52:52.346
And they are all committed to the same spectacular lies that Hert van den Bosch and Robert Malone and all of them are perpetuating.

01:52:53.288 --> 01:53:02.437
and the group Panda and the group heart are both run as as con organizations that soak up the money that would otherwise maybe

01:53:03.564 --> 01:53:05.765
groups of individuals in the world today.

01:53:06.006 --> 01:53:10.188
There's the largest group, by far the largest, that just want to forget COVID.

01:53:10.208 --> 01:53:16.252
They just want to move on, whether they're either harmed or whether they cause harm.

01:53:17.033 --> 01:53:19.094
If they cause harm, they just want to be forgiven.

01:53:19.655 --> 01:53:21.996
Boy, tough to make those decisions back then.

01:53:22.016 --> 01:53:24.418
And they just want to forget all this.

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:31.401
Then there's a group, I would say you're in that group, I'm in that group, our eyes were opened during COVID.

01:53:31.421 --> 01:53:35.983
And then of course, the third group are the COVID cartel, the people that imposed all this on us.

01:53:36.023 --> 01:53:38.584
And again, they have the power, they've controlled the narrative.

01:53:39.124 --> 01:53:42.646
They call the truth misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation.

01:53:43.466 --> 01:53:46.048
So that's what we've got going on right now.

01:53:46.509 --> 01:53:52.953
The goal of the second group, those of us with our eyes open, the good news is once our eyes are open, you can't close them.

01:53:53.414 --> 01:53:57.957
And so you become dedicated to doing what we need to do, which is open up more people's eyes.

01:53:57.997 --> 01:53:58.878
So I agree with you.

01:53:59.398 --> 01:54:06.444
More people are aware, but we have a long way to go because so many people are just in this enormous state of denial.

01:54:07.685 --> 01:54:21.416
They deny vaccine injuries because they took the vaccine that they don't want to think there's maybe a ticking time bomb in their body that the people that push the vaccines, they don't want to admit that maybe they pushed a vaccine that might have killed somebody or did them irreparable harm.

01:54:21.936 --> 01:54:26.520
So again, we've got an enormous challenge dealing with this global state of denial.

01:54:29.207 --> 01:54:42.152
It's remarkable because that guy called me in April of 2022 and told me that Robert Malone sat him down and made me watch my show, made him watch my show with Charles Rixey and that he wanted me to be his advisor.

01:54:42.693 --> 01:54:45.214
And then for years after that, I've been played.

01:54:45.254 --> 01:54:52.657
They even used Jessica Hockett and her friend Hugh Aston to pretend as though we got an audience with his staff.

01:54:53.317 --> 01:55:04.687
And then Jessica Hockett and this Hugh Astin proceeded to present their side of the story for like almost 45 minutes straight before I was given like 10 minutes.

01:55:04.908 --> 01:55:18.520
Not that dissimilar to how they did me wrong on the Defender podcast where a couple of days before I was supposed to have an hour, I got seven minutes and then they brought in Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose to drown me out for an hour and a half.

01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:22.871
This is a Trojan horse.

01:55:24.112 --> 01:55:25.532
America is under attack.

01:55:25.572 --> 01:55:29.194
We are being sabotaged and the Democrats have to be in on it.

01:55:29.234 --> 01:55:32.355
That's why so many of these people are actually Democrats.

01:55:32.855 --> 01:55:36.296
From Brett Weinstein to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:36.376 --> 01:55:38.757
to Mary Holland, all of them are Democrats.

01:55:38.837 --> 01:55:40.198
Robert Malone's a Democrat.

01:55:42.822 --> 01:55:47.783
Steve Kirsch is one of the largest private donors to the Democratic National Committee before the pandemic.

01:55:47.843 --> 01:55:49.364
And now he's on their side too.

01:55:50.104 --> 01:55:51.424
That is by design.

01:55:51.764 --> 01:55:53.205
They are a Trojan horse.

01:55:54.525 --> 01:55:57.265
That's why this podcast exists.

01:55:58.286 --> 01:56:00.926
This podcast, look, see it.

01:56:02.687 --> 01:56:03.367
Why isn't it moving?

01:56:07.825 --> 01:56:11.647
Unscripted, no makeup, live from the FDA.

01:56:12.107 --> 01:56:13.387
Welcome, Vinay Prasad.

01:56:13.407 --> 01:56:14.107
Great to see you.

01:56:14.247 --> 01:56:15.348
It's great to be here, Marty.

01:56:15.408 --> 01:56:16.168
It's great to be joining.

01:56:16.348 --> 01:56:21.630
And we got Sanjala Jain Nagpal, who is an- Please understand what this is.

01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:25.832
This is the FDA Director's Podcast, the first episode of it.

01:56:27.617 --> 01:56:39.351
It's almost like they were auditioning for this role on YouTube for the first five years or three years, sorry, of the pandemic, then took 2024 off, then went back on YouTube to audition for this again.

01:56:40.533 --> 01:56:47.041
And it's not by accident that this guy and this guy are part of the FDA because the FDA is what they want to destroy.

01:56:48.442 --> 01:56:53.146
awesome PhD health policy expert who is with us in the commissioner's office.

01:56:53.166 --> 01:56:54.887
So great to see both of you guys.

01:56:55.668 --> 01:56:58.811
And I don't know exactly what we're doing, but we're having a conversation.

01:56:58.831 --> 01:57:03.395
And this is just going to be some civil discourse here, having fun.

01:57:04.115 --> 01:57:10.681
And I think it's good for people to see what we're talking about, how we're thinking about things.

01:57:11.221 --> 01:57:15.705
instead of the FDA kind of be in a black box of, you know, what's going on inside the agency.

01:57:16.165 --> 01:57:16.725
Absolutely, Marty.

01:57:16.745 --> 01:57:23.431
I think ultimately the FDA serves the American people and it's really great for the American people to directly have.

01:57:23.531 --> 01:57:27.054
His YouTube record will show you that he is a child.

01:57:27.694 --> 01:57:28.775
He is a poser.

01:57:28.795 --> 01:57:30.116
He is fake.

01:57:30.516 --> 01:57:32.278
He was put in place for this show.

01:57:33.459 --> 01:57:34.880
Most likely he is a trader.

01:57:36.567 --> 01:57:41.148
I mean, really, I can't stress enough how dangerous of a position we are in right now.

01:57:41.228 --> 01:57:47.149
There are people that were put in place years ago for this exact controlled demolition.

01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:55.091
That's why Marty Makary is not an American guy who grew up in America on American streets.

01:57:55.131 --> 01:58:00.212
This isn't some guy from the streets of Philadelphia or from a small town in Wisconsin.

01:58:01.892 --> 01:58:07.241
with a dad who served in the Navy and a mom who he met by buying a Pepsi for her.

01:58:07.301 --> 01:58:09.085
That's not him either.

01:58:14.036 --> 01:58:15.277
It's a very dangerous time.

01:58:15.317 --> 01:58:18.660
Access to the commissioner to hear what you're thinking and what initiatives you're sparking here.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:24.124
And too often, so many articles about the FDA are behind a paywall for industry insiders only.

01:58:24.384 --> 01:58:27.447
And we're going to try to make the FDA accessible to the average person in America.

01:58:27.787 --> 01:58:28.588
In the glass box.

01:58:29.028 --> 01:58:31.330
In the glass box here with a beautiful view of FDA campus.

01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:32.611
Not the black box.

01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:34.413
Look at this beautiful campus here.

01:58:34.933 --> 01:58:38.276
It is going to be lined up with a farmer's market on Tuesday, thanks to

01:58:38.716 --> 01:58:41.718
Shout out to Melanie, who's in the background there.

01:58:41.738 --> 01:58:44.921
Boy, the FDA is really fixing America.

01:58:44.961 --> 01:58:47.662
He's organizing farmer's markets.

01:58:47.803 --> 01:58:48.403
Sweet.

01:58:48.803 --> 01:58:50.324
It's going to be every week.

01:58:50.364 --> 01:58:51.585
We're going to do it every single week.

01:58:51.885 --> 01:58:53.847
Maybe even some seed oil-free food trucks.

01:58:53.867 --> 01:58:54.227
Who knows?

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:57.449
Well, I mean, obviously, healthy food is an important initiative that you're taking on.

01:58:57.489 --> 01:58:58.210
Yeah.

01:58:58.250 --> 01:59:00.632
That's part of what you're working on, Los Angeles, healthy food.

01:59:01.432 --> 01:59:05.275
So we've got big, big goals on that front.

01:59:06.283 --> 01:59:08.965
So it's great to have Vinay Prasad here.

01:59:09.105 --> 01:59:11.226
One, because he has a great scientific mind.

01:59:11.967 --> 01:59:13.728
Two, he wants to serve our country.

01:59:14.369 --> 01:59:14.809
And three.

01:59:15.612 --> 01:59:21.197
He thinks and looks like Albert Einstein in terms of his hair.

01:59:21.217 --> 01:59:22.598
No, no, you say that, yeah.

01:59:22.718 --> 01:59:23.759
It's the regulatory haircut.

01:59:23.779 --> 01:59:25.400
It's the regulatory haircut.

01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:25.961
Regulation.

01:59:26.702 --> 01:59:31.886
I'm going to argue that the media team decided the only way to make him look older was to have him grow his hair out.

01:59:32.046 --> 01:59:32.947
That's what I'm going to say.

01:59:33.307 --> 01:59:34.028
And I think I'm right.

01:59:34.428 --> 01:59:42.115
Yes, but I'm excited to be here and to join FDA and try to work in service of the American people and try to bring innovative products to market.

01:59:43.279 --> 01:59:45.440
Innovative products to market.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.140
Innovative products to market.

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.941
He said innovative products to market.

01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:52.341
Holy shit.

01:59:53.481 --> 01:59:53.881
Wow.

01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:55.302
That makes me want to puke.

01:59:59.602 --> 02:00:01.343
These envelopes are just the worst.

02:00:01.823 --> 02:00:03.863
There's this guy, Brian, and he's awesome.

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:07.184
But he sends me these envelopes that like burst into a...

02:00:08.757 --> 02:00:17.162
If you're not really careful about how you dissect them, they burst into this, I assume must be completely like, you know, bioweapons level.

02:00:17.682 --> 02:00:18.762
Holy crap!

02:00:19.223 --> 02:00:20.023
Look at this!

02:00:21.304 --> 02:00:22.484
I got a package in the mail.

02:00:22.524 --> 02:00:23.105
Check this out.

02:00:24.886 --> 02:00:26.767
A book called The Double Helix.

02:00:28.422 --> 02:00:29.422
by James Watson.

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:32.584
See, I, I, you know, I get, sometimes it gets, oh, nice.

02:00:32.644 --> 02:00:33.684
The Plague of Corruption.

02:00:33.744 --> 02:00:35.625
I didn't have Judy Mikovits' book.

02:00:36.405 --> 02:00:38.146
So now I got Judy Mikovits' book.

02:00:38.166 --> 02:00:39.447
Boy, Brian is hooking me up.

02:00:39.527 --> 02:00:40.307
Look at this.

02:00:41.268 --> 02:00:44.129
A book called Viruses by Arnold Levine.

02:00:44.209 --> 02:00:44.429
Wow.

02:00:44.489 --> 02:00:46.690
I get all kinds of good gifts at my P.O.

02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:47.070
Box.

02:00:47.630 --> 02:00:49.191
Let's see if we can get this going here.

02:00:49.531 --> 02:00:54.394
of folks what CBER is, since we've got some science people and some non-science people listening.

02:00:54.634 --> 02:01:00.819
I mean, CBER, we govern a huge portfolio of medical products, including vaccines, gene therapy, cellular therapy.

02:01:01.179 --> 02:01:05.121
A lot of the most innovative things you read about in the news are things coming from CBER.

02:01:05.242 --> 02:01:07.843
Not to say the other departments here don't do innovative products.

02:01:07.863 --> 02:01:08.224
They do.

02:01:08.844 --> 02:01:13.407
But I think I'm particularly excited about what's been coming out in the last decade through CBER division.

02:01:13.867 --> 02:01:19.231
And we hope to always strike the balance between data, evidence, innovation,

02:01:19.751 --> 02:01:22.855
and entrepreneurial spirit of America, so that's what we're gonna do.

02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:26.339
Oh, my scripted bullshit, Batman.

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.941
Wow, that is remarkable.

02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:29.022
Does it sound good to you, Sangela?

02:01:29.042 --> 02:01:31.925
Sounds exciting, although I have a lot of questions about how you're gonna approach it.

02:01:32.026 --> 02:01:33.027
Okay, so tell me.

02:01:33.467 --> 02:01:35.109
So, you know, there are a lot of headlines.

02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:38.053
I have a lot of questions that I've been scripted to ask you.

02:01:41.364 --> 02:01:42.786
Oh, this is terrible, isn't it?

02:01:42.886 --> 02:01:43.967
It's just terrible.

02:01:44.027 --> 02:02:02.007
...out there about you being, you know, kind of a critic of the administration and kind of how things have been handled in the past with a lot of those products you talked about, and that maybe you're anti-vax, but I... I guarantee you one product they're never going to talk about is a PCR diagnostic, nor will they talk about lateral flow test diagnostics.

02:02:03.595 --> 02:02:04.455
That's the whole show.

02:02:05.256 --> 02:02:06.676
They'll never talk about it once.

02:02:07.297 --> 02:02:17.621
They are put in place at the FDA very specifically to never talk about it once because the FDA should be regulating each one of those as separate instances of a medical device.

02:02:17.701 --> 02:02:25.685
And I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that the currently existing PrEP Act emergency allows this to keep going.

02:02:27.405 --> 02:02:28.286
Dollars to donuts.

02:02:29.181 --> 02:02:33.824
And so they're talking about all kinds of innovative products while they're talking about the new shit.

02:02:34.385 --> 02:02:48.394
Because the old stuff, the stuff that Kevin McKernan and Peter McCullough and Jessica Rose have been exquisitely good, had not usefully questioning, is now the gold standard.

02:02:48.434 --> 02:02:57.681
Which means the remnant stream that they needed to sequence a lot of people all the time at all of our healthcare facilities is in place and accepted quite widely.

02:02:59.352 --> 02:03:15.705
And now we have a bunch of posers at the FDA who aren't even probably aware that the FDA's mandate extends to individual medical devices and whether they are safe and effective at doing what they say they're gonna do on the label.

02:03:16.205 --> 02:03:17.186
Oh my.

02:03:20.569 --> 02:03:23.091
My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, my, my goodness.

02:03:23.111 --> 02:03:24.492
I know that that's not true.

02:03:24.652 --> 02:03:25.453
Ooh, well.

02:03:26.823 --> 02:03:34.246
So tell us a little bit about why have you been critical, particularly in the vaccine space, and help everyone understand kind of your thinking behind that.

02:03:34.506 --> 02:03:42.268
So, I mean, I think vaccines are like drugs, which is that when given at the right time and the right moment to the right person, they're life-saving.

02:03:42.569 --> 02:03:46.630
But just like drugs, they need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and always taken to account.

02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:50.213
Case by case basis sounds like personalized medicine to me.

02:03:50.693 --> 02:03:51.654
Holy shit.

02:03:51.694 --> 02:03:56.677
It sounds like the same narrative that none other than James Lyons Wyler has been selling for years.

02:03:56.737 --> 02:04:08.926
Ever since he had a sky horse book in 2016 titled the environmental and genetic causes of autism, which is strikingly similar to the argument that Paul Offit just made on the twiv episode that we watched earlier in the show.

02:04:09.707 --> 02:04:14.751
Ladies and gentlemen, if you can't see this theater for what it is,

02:04:16.869 --> 02:04:20.895
From this many angles, you might be in the wrong place.

02:04:21.564 --> 02:04:22.765
You're at the wrong stream.

02:04:23.245 --> 02:04:24.686
You're listening to the wrong guy.

02:04:25.066 --> 02:04:26.306
To the context that you're giving.

02:04:26.686 --> 02:04:37.652
And Marty and I, throughout the pandemic, we were proponents of vaccines for the people in whom it had a huge benefit, but we were always a bit... In the people that it had huge benefit in.

02:04:37.692 --> 02:04:41.053
You know, like all those old people that died despite having the vaccine.

02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:44.155
Well, at least they had the vaccine because then they probably lived longer, right?

02:04:44.755 --> 02:04:47.817
This is as malevolent as possible.

02:04:48.197 --> 02:04:50.338
Skeptical from a scientific standpoint,

02:04:50.818 --> 02:04:54.122
about perhaps overdoing it in some low-risk populations.

02:04:54.142 --> 02:04:59.167
Wait a minute, you don't think a healthy, thin, 12-year-old girl needs a 7th COVID shot?

02:04:59.187 --> 02:05:03.652
7th versus the 8th versus the 9th versus... I mean, it's really... It's an unknown.

02:05:04.072 --> 02:05:04.773
It's an unknown.

02:05:04.953 --> 02:05:09.378
And it also is a way in which the United States has never been in line with peer nations across Europe.

02:05:09.898 --> 02:05:16.845
And so that's not anti-vax, it's pro-science, trying to bring the best available science to answer these questions.

02:05:17.166 --> 02:05:24.073
The media, in many cases, in my opinion, they sort of misrepresent the concepts that we're talking about at FDA.

02:05:25.494 --> 02:05:29.719
have sort of a superficial view of what we're doing, and in some ways they kind of miss the mark.

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:39.911
But in terms of what I've been doing for 15 years, I'm a professor, I'm a he-monk doctor, probably no one's given, or few doctors have given as many vaccines as I have because I took care of a

02:05:40.191 --> 02:05:42.673
a lot of patients post-autologous stem cell transplant.

02:05:42.693 --> 02:05:43.334
Immunosuppressed.

02:05:43.594 --> 02:05:44.134
Immunosuppressed.

02:05:44.295 --> 02:05:46.516
And you need to give these patients vaccines.

02:05:47.197 --> 02:05:53.302
So, you know, we love vaccines when done right, when given appropriately, when based on solid evidence.

02:05:53.723 --> 02:05:55.704
And we're going to hold up that standard at FDA.

02:05:55.844 --> 02:06:00.929
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very, very red alert emergency in America.

02:06:01.009 --> 02:06:04.412
If you do not understand the trap you are in, you cannot get out.

02:06:05.578 --> 02:06:16.007
These people were put in place at the beginning of the pandemic and rehearsed their narrative and tweaked it and practiced it again until they were put in place to do the dance that they're doing now.

02:06:16.547 --> 02:06:18.008
They are part of a Trojan horse.

02:06:18.939 --> 02:06:25.128
part of a traitorous, saboteuring, Trojan horse in our government.

02:06:25.448 --> 02:06:33.360
It could be that Donald Trump is a dummy, but I assure you he's not playing 5-D chess anymore than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:35.122
was playing 5-D chess when he put

02:06:35.703 --> 02:06:38.648
the bicycle and the dead bear in Central Park.

02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:48.986
Not playing 5D chess any more than when Brett Weinstein cut the head off of a seal with a dull hand knife on the beach of California.

02:06:53.382 --> 02:07:06.909
And if we want to see it, you can see it by what Brandy Vaughn was trying to teach around all of these people at the time of Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2 and her less than optimal sort of integration with them.

02:07:06.969 --> 02:07:17.635
That includes Polly Tommy ignoring her, includes people like Suzanne Humphreys ignoring her and trying to absorb part of her message, not that dissimilar to how they've done on social media.

02:07:18.155 --> 02:07:39.103
was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine that he received that could have thimerosal, thimerosal is the mercury containing organic preservative that they used in vaccines and still use in some instances, but he had a very very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines

02:07:39.796 --> 02:07:50.569
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

02:07:50.730 --> 02:07:52.291
I don't like the word autism.

02:07:53.193 --> 02:07:54.194
He was vaccine damaged.

02:07:54.713 --> 02:08:20.238
And so he could have been naive at this time, or he could have already been on a script because at this time, he was already a 16 year experienced molecular biologist with a lot of experience specifically in trying to transform and transfect plants to make medicines, which is something that during his career, somebody like Margaret Liu at Merck Corporation was talking about every time she talked.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:41.824
And so it's a very curious time sort of calendar for Brian Hooker not to be involved in a more nefarious way than just kind of co-opted by Mary Holland and Meryl Nass, just kind of co-opted into having a book eventually and when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:41.864 --> 02:08:43.264
would finally get into the White House.

02:08:43.424 --> 02:08:45.165
I feel more and more every day

02:08:45.965 --> 02:08:50.709
Like, it's impossible for Brian Hooker not to have been in on it in a much more malevolent way.

02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:58.736
Because he lied to me so consistently as playing the dodo bird in CHD.

02:08:58.776 --> 02:09:00.297
Like, I don't know what you're talking about, Jay.

02:09:00.317 --> 02:09:01.137
You're so smart.

02:09:02.298 --> 02:09:06.742
Exactly like Robert Malone talked about in the beginning of the stream about how they tell you how great you are.

02:09:06.802 --> 02:09:09.584
It's no different than what CHD did to me.

02:09:09.644 --> 02:09:11.646
What Bret Weinstein did to me on Signal in 2021.

02:09:13.444 --> 02:09:18.808
what Chris Martinson and Matt Crawford did with Brett Weinstein on Signal in 2021.

02:09:19.648 --> 02:09:24.131
Like how the people of the Steve Kerr Steering Committee did to me in 2022.

02:09:24.431 --> 02:09:26.613
Like Panda did to me in 2022.

02:09:27.093 --> 02:09:30.055
Like the Doctors for COVID Ethics did to me in 2023.

02:09:32.416 --> 02:09:42.303
It's all the same joke to make sure that our children never usefully understand themselves so that they realize that intramuscular injection is just ridiculous as a medicine.

02:09:44.306 --> 02:09:50.297
And this works well to say that these are the bad guys, that it's Pfizer and Bill and Melinda Gates.

02:09:51.339 --> 02:09:52.962
It's bigger than profit.

02:09:53.943 --> 02:09:55.246
It's bigger than money.

02:09:56.519 --> 02:10:14.664
It is about a multi-generational objective called the Human Genome Project, and they have decided that the national security priority that is the Human Genome Project, as Robert Malone adequately described as having spent much more resources on that than they ever spent on the Manhattan Project, of course,

02:10:15.469 --> 02:10:19.730
This is the biggest human project ever, and it's an international one.

02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:31.432
And so they are now using social media to control the narrative on an international basis with the idea of weaponizing this bad biology 101 to the point of enslaving our children.

02:10:31.492 --> 02:10:36.513
If you want to get your children out, you have to explain to them that these people are lying.

02:10:36.613 --> 02:10:40.054
And if he knows or doesn't know, it doesn't matter because their dad's new.

02:10:41.004 --> 02:10:49.668
And I got sucked in by a whole bunch of people pretending to be independent actors when they're all on the same team, all the way back to Piper Stover.

02:10:51.268 --> 02:10:59.372
It's about all the children of earth, ladies and gentlemen, the grandchildren specifically, that's why there's a fake anti-vax movement that I've been trying to shake for the last five years.

02:10:59.412 --> 02:11:06.915
That's why there's still no debate about the fact that there was a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from and will likely come again.

02:11:07.964 --> 02:11:17.590
If you want to understand how they did it, you have to understand that irreducibly complex background of genetic signals provided to us by our symbiotic neighbors, our bacteria.

02:11:18.991 --> 02:11:31.739
The fact that all higher organisms, all more complex pattern integrities exist on this background, and it is impossible to divorce us from it, nevermind find a very specific signal on it.

02:11:33.579 --> 02:11:35.385
RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen.

02:11:35.545 --> 02:11:39.477
If you use PCR to find their ghosts, their ghosts do not become real.

02:11:40.953 --> 02:11:42.174
and you are not a ghostbuster.

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:47.397
And yet all of these people accept PCR as a gold standard diagnostic now.

02:11:47.857 --> 02:11:49.458
And that is the trap.

02:11:49.519 --> 02:11:51.760
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:54.061
Transfecting people was always a crime.

02:11:54.542 --> 02:11:58.444
And the population pyramids is a real problem that they are managing right now.

02:11:58.504 --> 02:11:59.305
Thanks for joining me.

02:11:59.325 --> 02:12:00.646
See you again soon.

02:12:01.646 --> 02:12:04.408
From everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:12:04.648 --> 02:12:05.549
You can capture it.

02:12:05.569 --> 02:12:06.529
You can sequence it.

02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:08.711
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.
