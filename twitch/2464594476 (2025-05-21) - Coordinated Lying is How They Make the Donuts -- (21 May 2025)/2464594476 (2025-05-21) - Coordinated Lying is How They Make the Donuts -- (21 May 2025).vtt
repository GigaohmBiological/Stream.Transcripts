00:28.519 --> 00:34.101
CBC, why'd you do that hurtful piece on me?

00:35.121 --> 00:38.342
Now my friends are looking out for me.

00:38.362 --> 00:44.884
Oh, why'd you do that piece on me suddenly?

00:46.738 --> 00:49.979
All Canadians now know about me.

00:49.999 --> 00:54.241
Now my name will be on jeopardy.

00:54.261 --> 00:59.322
Oh, why'd you do that piece on me?

00:59.342 --> 01:08.146
I don't really know why you quoted me that way.

01:10.588 --> 01:20.863
I said no quid pro quo, but you wrote it the other way, CBC.

01:22.984 --> 01:26.605
I hope you didn't mean to mess with me.

01:27.425 --> 01:35.987
Your journalistical integrity is on the line now, CBC.

01:37.947 --> 01:45.329
IPATO was slow, I must say, until that day.

01:46.409 --> 01:51.470
Now new donors come right and left.

01:51.870 --> 01:57.232
You saved the day, CBC.

01:58.472 --> 02:01.913
Maybe you can do more hits on me.

02:02.973 --> 02:06.214
I can do more research now, you see.

02:06.234 --> 02:10.956
Oh how I love you, CBC.

02:23.396 --> 02:24.517
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

02:24.557 --> 02:25.178
Welcome to the show.

02:25.218 --> 02:26.639
This is GigaOM Biological.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.062
The United States is currently under attack.

02:29.322 --> 02:36.690
We are being undermined from the inside by a Trojan horse of what can only be characterized as traitors.

02:37.511 --> 02:39.953
I do not believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.596
is directly aware of what's happening.

02:42.756 --> 02:44.839
He is just a puppet in this game.

02:45.459 --> 02:55.249
One of the central people to help you understand this would be Steve Bannon, a former acolyte of Goldman Sachs, an intellectual property expert and advocated for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:55.369 --> 03:05.880
as vice president, exactly as the Skyhorse Publishing genius Tony Lyons proposed in the epilogue of

03:06.861 --> 03:08.743
of Jesse Ventura's book in 2008.

03:10.124 --> 03:14.589
I think two of the intellectual people behind this narrative are Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

03:15.109 --> 03:24.658
Both of them are connected to the deepest and longest portions of the DOE and DOD, including HIV, the Human Genome Project, the Who, Gavi.

03:25.339 --> 03:30.864
And Robert Malone is very specific in terms of his connections with a lot of the worst

03:31.605 --> 03:42.709
actors on stage right now, including people as diverse as Li Min Yan and the soon-to-be candidate for Idaho governor, Ryan Cole.

03:43.509 --> 03:50.731
All of these people agree that the FDA is annoying, and unfortunately, at least two of their dads were involved in defining the FDA.

03:51.572 --> 03:55.273
And one of the guys we never talk about, who was also involved in

03:55.993 --> 04:05.342
defining the FDA is one Estes Kefauver, somebody that only my friend Mark Kulak has done any reasonable amount of coverage on.

04:05.983 --> 04:08.065
And yes, I think I was duped.

04:08.285 --> 04:12.849
I was duped by people and agents associated with people on this narrative.

04:13.810 --> 04:42.941
And I think one of the central people in this narrative is this fellow right here Because he is connected in so many ways to the grandfathers of this narrative And that's that's the reason why I will continue to say Robert Malone's name out loud I think he is the one of the driving forces behind this fake anti-vax movement this fake health freedom movement and The other guy who is very much behind that is of course

04:43.041 --> 04:47.003
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

04:47.543 --> 04:47.963
Taught who?

04:48.703 --> 04:49.904
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

04:50.124 --> 04:50.244
Oh.

04:50.444 --> 04:57.947
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of echo health into the WIV because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

04:57.987 --> 04:58.127
Right.

04:58.767 --> 04:59.388
Obama did that, right?

04:59.408 --> 04:59.988
Obama did that.

05:00.028 --> 05:11.155
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

05:11.195 --> 05:13.317
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

05:13.337 --> 05:14.658
It's going through some intermediary.

05:15.538 --> 05:27.366
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seam technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

05:27.754 --> 05:33.259
And so my argument is that this man is reading a script that he had at least a part in writing.

05:33.819 --> 05:39.104
It is a script that can be seen in brochure form in the Spars pandemic document.

05:40.184 --> 05:45.509
And a spectacular commitment to this script is really all that's required for you to get a part in their show.

05:45.949 --> 05:47.951
But this is actually all they've ever had.

05:48.011 --> 05:49.452
If you listen very carefully to

05:50.974 --> 06:01.063
A personal meddler of mine, somebody who has interfered with me and my family for five years straight from apparently Japan, is a guy by the name of Kevin McCairn.

06:01.563 --> 06:14.315
And here's a video of him in March 2020 saying exactly the same thing as the former Human Genome Project Research and Development Director said on the Danny Jones podcast in November of 2024.

06:19.502 --> 06:39.152
I think there's a genuine call for justice to be called for, especially if there was, you know, there was a moratorium in place that caused Fauci's department to have the research offshored, okay?

06:39.572 --> 06:44.835
So, I mean, I have to presume that somewhere, because we don't know what those papers look like,

06:47.874 --> 06:59.485
Prior to that, and this was the Obama administration that did this and there's a lot there's a strong argument for I wait Keep going.

07:00.025 --> 07:10.134
Yeah, so I have to presume that somewhere so you can see he's on a script He even had to wait for it to update Ralph Eric's a guy who arguably taught with how to create the coronavirus.

07:10.234 --> 07:13.016
This is a story The Wuhan Institute of virology.

07:13.237 --> 07:14.478
Oh, so and they didn't teach

07:14.978 --> 07:16.619
Barrick didn't teach them anything.

07:16.719 --> 07:23.942
If anything, they gave them something in the form of a clone or in the form of a sequence that they were told to find and nothing more.

07:24.002 --> 07:25.663
And it was an exact sequence.

07:25.703 --> 07:43.812
Make sure you understand that because if you don't accept the exact sequence, then you're essentially, you're disbelieving the narrative of a novel virus with an exact sequence that has a number of exact sequences that cause it to be exactly as deadly as it is.

07:45.077 --> 07:53.221
So there's grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV, because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

07:53.281 --> 07:53.902
Obama did that, right?

07:53.922 --> 07:54.502
Obama did that.

07:54.542 --> 08:05.668
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.829
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

08:07.869 --> 08:09.149
It's going through some intermediary.

08:10.690 --> 08:22.335
And he's gonna say that they teach them this no-see-um technology, and at the very end of the statement, he's gonna call it Golden Gate Assembly, which is actually just a commercial technique, or a commercial product.

08:22.895 --> 08:27.997
You know, like Davenport is another name for a sofa, because at some point a company made

08:28.617 --> 08:41.049
Sofas was called Davenport and Golden Gate Assembly is the name for putting stuff together using a wide Selection of restriction enzymes in order to get the exact sequence that you want.

08:41.149 --> 08:42.050
It's not magic.

08:42.570 --> 08:53.540
It's not baking special cakes It's not something that only that fat guy at North Carolina knows how to do and by him saying Golden Gate Assembly in exactly the way that he says it

08:54.804 --> 08:58.006
is an admission that the no-see-um shit is nonsense.

08:58.227 --> 08:58.607
Listen.

08:59.287 --> 09:11.136
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-see-um technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

09:11.156 --> 09:16.300
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

09:17.521 --> 09:22.165
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it, necessarily, from a laboratory.

09:22.885 --> 09:31.488
It's a clever way to put things together to get the exact sequence you want that was not invented by Ralph Baric and does not have a special code word.

09:32.944 --> 09:35.345
No see him, my goodness.

09:35.966 --> 09:42.089
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that make us, that got them caught, basically.

09:42.730 --> 09:46.171
And you should, if you wanna hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.794
Charles Rixey has helped, you know, RFK write his book about this.

09:50.034 --> 09:52.395
Okay, Charles Rixey did not help him write his book.

09:52.435 --> 09:58.859
He actually was fired from helping write his book, very specifically for this person named Kevin McCairn.

09:59.759 --> 10:07.645
And the problem with it is both Charles Rixey and Kevin McCarron came not to your house, but my house in 2022.

10:08.586 --> 10:16.172
And both of them came to my house more or less to mess around with my family and to see what I was thinking and to try and influence it.

10:17.193 --> 10:29.302
And a couple weeks before Rixey showed up at my house, Kevin McKernan was on my podcast telling me all about, all about the molecular biology I needed to learn in order to catch up with him.

10:30.410 --> 10:38.633
Now this is verifiable by a number of people who are listed on the acknowledgements page of the Wuhan cover-up book.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.894
So unfortunately, I have to recommend to you to buy one.

10:42.634 --> 10:52.058
Not because I want to support the work of Children's Health Defense and Skyhorse Publishing, but because it is an actual

10:53.038 --> 11:03.921
It is an actual document in American history that you could take notes on and highlight the parts of it which are true, the parts of it which are false, and the parts of it which are missing.

11:04.361 --> 11:05.741
The people who are missing.

11:05.861 --> 11:15.084
It is a real, breathing document of history, especially because this guy lied about how it was written.

11:17.335 --> 11:23.379
And this guy isn't just anybody, he is the former Research and Development Director of the Human Frickin' Genome Project.

11:25.060 --> 11:30.403
And Charles Rixey's a marine, and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

11:31.431 --> 11:34.073
And he was the one who leaked the diffuse proposal.

11:34.313 --> 11:35.975
Are you familiar with the diffuse proposal?

11:36.155 --> 11:38.797
So very specifically, the diffuse proposal is fake.

11:38.997 --> 11:52.288
It is a leaked document designed to ascribe both blame and some kind of plausible biological mechanism to a lab leak occurring, because they sprayed vaccines into bat caves, which is, of course, bullshit.

11:52.848 --> 11:57.832
But that's specifically why Charles Rixey came to my house, to convince me that I was wrong,

11:58.553 --> 12:08.178
that the diffuse proposal was real, not fake, and that I should rejoin drastic a group of anonymous people on the internet, specifically on Twitter.

12:10.484 --> 12:35.910
Understand that very specifically on Twitter where Kevin McKernan says all the truth is found in in March of 2020 so there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build a weaponized coronavirus Under the banner of we need to build seen against this because if we can do it the Chinese can do a kind of thing and the DoD turned down the grant because I thought it was It's too fucking crazy.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.070
That's not true

12:38.010 --> 12:42.553
We don't know whether the grant was turned down or if it was just found on the server.

12:42.613 --> 12:45.434
They say it wasn't funded, but there was no evaluation.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.415
So nobody called it crazy.

12:48.116 --> 12:53.879
More importantly, the grant does not suggest to make weaponized viruses.

12:53.939 --> 13:02.584
It suggests to make bad spike proteins and then make vaccines for them and spray them in bat caves or something like that.

13:02.624 --> 13:03.264
So it's all

13:03.777 --> 13:09.781
It's all elaborate bullshit for this podcaster to go, oh, wow, holy shit.

13:10.342 --> 13:13.084
You'll have something to weep for this.

13:13.244 --> 13:17.047
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

13:17.287 --> 13:19.729
We got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

13:20.089 --> 13:22.551
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

13:23.071 --> 13:24.532
It's just, you don't.

13:24.552 --> 13:31.818
And now the remarkable thing about the story is, is that when Charles Rixey came to my house and we did a podcast together,

13:33.038 --> 13:58.343
One of the things that I said in that podcast is exactly this, that NIH grants, at least at the academic level, are often half-completed when they are submitted because you need this preliminary data in order to prove that you have something working, that the experimental paradigm is working, which is very different than what he just said, but along the same lines, so much so that my quote in the book

14:00.467 --> 14:06.690
My quote in the book about this is almost word for word what he just said, and that's not by accident.

14:06.730 --> 14:22.297
So not only are they removing me as an expert from the book that I wrote with the current Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America, but they are replacing me with someone who came to my house in 2022 and lied to me repeatedly afterward on the internet.

14:24.558 --> 14:25.579
Two people, actually.

14:26.641 --> 14:41.245
And that second person, Kevin McCairn, was on a Steve Kirsch podcast together with Kevin McKernan, this guy who's lying on the Danny Jones podcast, about my and Rixey's lack of contribution to the Wuhan cover-up book.

14:44.557 --> 14:57.710
looking for the last 20% because you just can't you need the grant process is so grueling and so competitive that you in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows like we can get x done, we've demonstrated this piece, we've demonstrated this piece.

14:58.111 --> 14:59.512
Now we just need to do this last piece.

15:00.773 --> 15:06.815
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

15:06.955 --> 15:10.096
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

15:11.437 --> 15:14.938
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

15:15.538 --> 15:25.982
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but you're- Now it's important to understand, I don't know if I turned this on yet or not, let me just check and see if I got this lined up right.

15:26.202 --> 15:27.902
I might not have it upright yet.

15:30.734 --> 15:31.275
There we go.

15:32.096 --> 15:34.358
Chickens are going bananas.

15:36.541 --> 15:41.466
Just to make sure that you can see this now, first of all, let me make that point again.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.608
Unless you accept the exact sequence,

15:44.602 --> 15:49.024
You know, nucleotide for nucleotide, none of this story that he's talking about makes any sense.

15:49.684 --> 16:01.130
None of the story of Charles Rixey's, you know, most contagious virus in human history makes any sense if they don't keep track of the fear and cleavage side or the HIV inserts and wait for them to mutate away.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.771
I mean, then they're not playing a game.

16:04.151 --> 16:08.293
They're playing, rather, they're playing a game and not the game they claim to be playing.

16:10.532 --> 16:15.377
And so the single sequence has to be exactly what they say it is.

16:15.477 --> 16:30.212
Otherwise, you know, all of these papers don't make any sense, including the one from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 that said that there was some kind of reversed Moderna sequence found because it's obvious that this is like a patented, there's no, the odds of this being there are crazy.

16:31.710 --> 16:40.037
So this whole narrative has been nicely seeded and adjusted as it failed over the last five years.

16:40.818 --> 16:54.830
And they're still basically stuck with the main players that they already had put in place from the very beginning, which is really remarkable because these two characters, this one and Charles Rixey, are serious amateurs.

16:55.811 --> 16:58.534
They are way, way, way over their head with this.

16:58.956 --> 17:04.122
Highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain letters.

17:04.783 --> 17:06.045
Those are what restrictions are.

17:06.065 --> 17:07.927
So imagine you can only cut and paste where there's a the.

17:07.947 --> 17:11.812
This is such a shitty explanation.

17:11.872 --> 17:12.973
It's just remarkable.

17:13.353 --> 17:16.297
It's magnificent in its shittiness.

17:16.777 --> 17:23.741
sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with there, which is a couple more letters onto the, right?

17:23.781 --> 17:25.442
And we're going to use those enzymes to cut here.

17:25.482 --> 17:27.063
And by doing that, we can assemble this genome.

17:27.083 --> 17:33.446
Well, they had certain restriction enzymes in that diffuse proposal that are present in coronavirus that's currently circulating.

17:33.806 --> 17:37.688
And that was kind of the smoking gun that showed that, okay, this was in fact assembled.

17:37.888 --> 17:39.609
It was a product of the diffuse proposal.

17:39.669 --> 17:42.791
Someone eventually carried out that grant application to its,

17:43.371 --> 17:53.924
Final conclusion and that's actually circulating Rixie has the whole story you want to talk to him and Alex Washburn Rixie has the whole story on this.

17:53.964 --> 17:55.486
So that's where it all goes, right?

17:55.526 --> 17:59.891
That's where they they've overextended themselves and basically are absolutely

18:00.732 --> 18:20.152
exposed because this is bullshit for one one reason in particular do you remember the guy who opened the stream who sang the song about the canadian broadcasting company doing a hit piece on him and that now all the donations were coming into his his ipac and he could do all the research he needed to do i guess he's still trying to figure out

18:20.752 --> 18:24.634
if intramuscular injection is good with some combination of substances or another.

18:25.055 --> 18:30.958
But anyway, the point is, is that that guy, James Lyons Weiler, knew all of these details.

18:31.579 --> 18:33.360
He knew all of those details.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.081
Alex Washburn, my ass.

18:35.761 --> 18:37.042
Charles Rixey, my ass.

18:37.442 --> 18:48.029
James Lyons Weiler knew all these molecular details in January of 2020, was cited by Dan Sirotkin, the guy who I got all messed up with, got me on Zero Hedge.

18:49.150 --> 18:53.836
and got me the most views I've ever had in the history of my YouTube channel, bar none.

18:56.960 --> 18:57.961
This is where we are.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.984
This is an illusion, ladies and gentlemen.

19:00.004 --> 19:06.732
And these actors, spectacularly committed to a script written by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, maybe some other people helped,

19:07.677 --> 19:17.882
That's the only thing standing between you and being free, your kids being free, and Nathan having some justice, his daughters and wife having some justice.

19:18.543 --> 19:23.585
How the hell did we transfect so many healthy people in America?

19:25.146 --> 19:26.327
How did they get away with it?

19:26.387 --> 19:26.867
How are these

19:28.032 --> 19:29.413
these pictures possible?

19:30.013 --> 19:44.539
How is this loop recording that I made just from cutting a single audio piece from an interview with Robert Malone from three months ago or four months ago, how is it possible that I can do this?

19:44.659 --> 19:50.241
Current round of vaccines, we're using traditional mRNA technology, and I just gagged at that.

19:53.717 --> 19:56.398
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

19:56.678 --> 20:04.642
Do you believe, you know, because, I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

20:05.462 --> 20:06.423
Dell knows who I am.

20:08.444 --> 20:10.625
I think that, so.

20:11.285 --> 20:12.105
They know who I am.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.886
The statement was made that.

20:14.586 --> 20:15.627
He knows who I am.

20:16.027 --> 20:18.028
This guy definitely knows who I am.

20:18.088 --> 20:19.749
He ran away from me.

20:19.989 --> 20:21.149
He's been to my house too.

20:24.397 --> 20:35.325
So, so we've already got, you know, modern and traditional, do you believe, you know, cause I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

20:37.367 --> 20:44.573
Uh, I think that, uh, so, and a lot of these people know who Brandy Vaughn is too.

20:46.034 --> 20:48.756
A lot of them do a lot of them do.

20:50.799 --> 20:54.441
That guy doesn't, because he's really, I mean, this is really a joke on all of us.

20:54.702 --> 20:56.683
My goodness sakes, is this terrible.

20:57.884 --> 21:08.451
So in that video that we played of Robert Malone, and you can play from the Maha podcast, he admits, and he's done it many times on other podcasts, that he's a DOD insider.

21:08.931 --> 21:14.354
He claims to be a repeat whistleblower, ethics king, starting with Jesse Gelsinger.

21:14.374 --> 21:25.361
But of course, that's kind of inconvenient because Jesse Gelsinger was a dentivirus injection and it caused catastrophic liver failure, presumably because they injected it directly into the liver.

21:25.741 --> 21:26.622
But had they,

21:27.442 --> 21:38.970
injected it intramuscularly, and it spread more thoroughly through the body, there's no telling what cascade or bouquet of gifts you could get from such a catastrophic idea.

21:39.370 --> 21:51.919
And yet he didn't warn about that at all, even though apparently he knew to warn about that back in the 2000s, so much so that he made the career of some Stolberg lady at the New York Times.

21:53.183 --> 21:56.864
Everybody wins around Robert Malone, except for Robert Malone.

21:57.504 --> 22:08.447
And so he only says CIA and CIA and CIA as if there aren't 16 or 17 other intelligence agencies in the United States apparatus.

22:08.487 --> 22:15.628
He says Substack, just like Paul Offit says Substack, just like they all say Substack, because what is Substack?

22:16.268 --> 22:18.709
Substack is you training their AI.

22:20.549 --> 22:34.773
Substack is you segregating yourself off from other social media platforms and choosing to be there and interacting with those people as opposed to Gab or Telegram or Blue Sky or whatever this other shit is that they use.

22:36.253 --> 22:41.614
But most importantly, you're putting your creativity, your content on Substack.

22:42.314 --> 22:43.575
And they're monetizing it.

22:44.255 --> 22:48.136
It's not like you get 100% of the proceeds from their using your stuff.

22:49.349 --> 23:00.873
And so it's no different than YouTube, but with more capabilities for you to publish how you want, so that we can use and mine your creativity for everything that we can, including the very text.

23:02.914 --> 23:12.657
Maybe you can even help us evaluate our text-to-speech algorithm by correcting the transcripts that we generate from the videos that you put up on Substack.

23:13.037 --> 23:14.138
And so that's what this is.

23:14.986 --> 23:21.468
It's promoting all the same shit if you promote Substack and X all the time, which is what they do.

23:22.589 --> 23:27.150
He only says one book title wrong, and that's the Lab Leak cover-up.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.211
No, Robert, it's the Malone.

23:30.191 --> 23:33.672
It's not the Malone cover-up or the Lab Leak cover-up.

23:33.752 --> 23:35.053
It's the Wuhan cover-up.

23:35.973 --> 23:39.234
Unfortunately, he got that wrong, even though he's on the back of that book.

23:40.091 --> 23:41.352
Let's see if this is set up.

23:41.432 --> 23:41.772
It is.

23:41.932 --> 23:42.513
Wow, nice.

23:43.273 --> 23:57.582
He says he has never revealed classified information, which I would point out means that he hasn't really taken much risk at all, other than, I guess, maybe when he said that Peter Cullis is a liar or that Michael Callahan is a liar.

23:57.642 --> 23:58.823
I hope he called him first.

23:59.803 --> 24:08.929
Anyway, he says he worked on social media control programs for Arab Spring and that those things are still being used, they're still classified, and that's why he really hasn't gone there.

24:10.455 --> 24:18.381
That's a strange thing to say now instead of on the Bret Weinstein podcast when they first looked into the camera and said, this is Robert Malone.

24:18.821 --> 24:30.170
He's speaking out about MRNA because he's risking his, he's gonna do something that, you know, only people like him, very few people are so good as him.

24:32.492 --> 24:37.793
And of course he says that the work remains classified and in use by the CIA.

24:37.993 --> 24:40.254
Oh, CIA in use right now.

24:40.734 --> 24:44.055
This is all an elaborate hoax.

24:44.595 --> 24:46.615
I don't know if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:46.655 --> 24:48.636
is a victim of it, but I assume so.

24:49.276 --> 24:58.898
It's really hard for most of these people to understand how long they've been fooled because it is a very intricate network of liars recruited

24:59.658 --> 25:03.419
individually, over time, and put in place, and coached.

25:04.079 --> 25:12.722
And if they don't make it, they don't make the cut, they get thrown off the bus, and nobody sees them because social media is a controlled environment.

25:13.962 --> 25:16.803
You can feel like you're being seen, but you're not being seen.

25:17.203 --> 25:21.524
That's why I'm suggesting, more importantly than ever, we need to get off social media.

25:21.664 --> 25:23.545
If you're on it, you need to subvert it.

25:25.962 --> 25:27.103
Soapbox is real.

25:27.183 --> 25:28.243
Mastodon is real.

25:28.283 --> 25:29.644
You can follow anybody you want.

25:29.664 --> 25:33.126
You can even follow the bird makeup version of people on Twitter.

25:33.146 --> 25:35.987
But the point will be that you will be in control of who you see.

25:36.468 --> 25:37.949
You block who you want to block.

25:38.709 --> 25:39.309
And that's it.

25:41.390 --> 25:46.793
You want to find things to talk about, to think about, to worry about.

25:47.154 --> 25:55.178
There's other ways to do it than relinquishing control of your consciousness to Elon Musk and his squad.

25:58.871 --> 25:59.851
That's what I mean by that.

25:59.911 --> 26:01.032
I really mean it.

26:01.052 --> 26:05.994
That's why I think I'm allowed to do this because I've met all these people.

26:06.034 --> 26:12.956
I've tried my best to work with them to understand what they're thinking and to try and influence how they're thinking to move forward.

26:13.076 --> 26:14.617
And I have been rebutted.

26:14.957 --> 26:19.341
You can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

26:19.361 --> 26:27.870
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

26:28.070 --> 26:30.472
Now I assure you they're all on that script.

26:30.492 --> 26:34.797
They're not going to get off of it because the middle people are all the coordinators of this.

26:34.877 --> 26:35.337
They are the

26:36.518 --> 26:38.660
global coordinators of this bullshit.

26:38.700 --> 26:50.710
As long as those people in the absolute big pictures there agree to disagree and agree about everything the way the script is written, then everybody else on this picture doesn't really stand a chance.

26:50.890 --> 27:04.982
Now, if a few of these people on the bottom are also well read in, or well scripted, or have agreed not to look behind the curtain and just follow the script they're given, then the people at the top really don't have a chance.

27:06.397 --> 27:09.200
And so it could be that Mike Eden is not a bad guy.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.985
He was just somebody who was effectively neutralized by all these people.

27:13.405 --> 27:22.876
It could be that Peter McCullough is not a bad guy, although his latest performances, especially very recently, he's going to perform today at 2 o'clock.

27:22.956 --> 27:25.118
I'm afraid this will be the last straw for me.

27:26.199 --> 27:28.921
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I just don't think he's that smart.

27:29.261 --> 27:33.964
I don't think he's as sophisticated as his vocabulary would have you believe.

27:34.384 --> 27:39.448
I think that one of the smartest people, cleverest people, and still on the ball people is Thomas Binder.

27:39.468 --> 27:41.469
I don't think he's been fooled by any of these people.

27:41.909 --> 27:47.672
And I think that Sukrit Bhakti has been pressured in a way that few others in this narrative have.

27:47.752 --> 27:57.636
And so I'm willing to forgive him for saying that if RNA can't pandemic and we've decided that's true, then we should stop talking about it because I'm sure he knows that's bullshit.

27:58.116 --> 28:02.979
And in a way, I think he said it so succinctly so that I could point out how much bullshit it is.

28:03.439 --> 28:05.440
And I appreciate him for doing that.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.321
Now, this is where we are.

28:08.311 --> 28:19.856
These people essentially are some of the worst actors in this manipulative script that you are a victim of only if you use Substack and X.

28:21.823 --> 28:26.486
If you don't use Substack and X, Jonathan Engler and Panda can't get to you.

28:27.107 --> 28:30.509
If you don't use Substack and X, you will never see Robert Malone.

28:31.130 --> 28:35.272
If you don't use Substack and X, you would never know who Jessica Rose was.

28:35.353 --> 28:40.096
If you didn't use Substack and X, you would have never known who Kevin McKernan was.

28:41.357 --> 28:43.118
Never heard of the organization Heart.

28:43.758 --> 28:46.020
Never heard of the Brownstone Group.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.181
None of that shit.

28:48.973 --> 28:57.475
And once you see it for what it is, that they tricked us into believing that X was something like a town hall, and we had to get there while the getting was good.

28:57.835 --> 29:03.497
And now they've tricked us into splitting up based on whether or not we want the blue version or the red version of it.

29:03.937 --> 29:10.158
And there's some people on Blue Sky and some people on Twitter, and it's just the absolute perfect setup.

29:11.679 --> 29:12.279
And they did it.

29:13.530 --> 29:19.953
Timor's case scenario drove us to segregate like that in our population, essentially herding cats with loud noises.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.954
And that's what this guy is, a loud noise.

29:24.235 --> 29:25.876
Six years back, I asked one question.

29:25.916 --> 29:27.136
I never got an answer from anyone.

29:27.236 --> 29:29.217
Do you know anyone that died from COVID?

29:29.858 --> 29:33.339
It's the fog of antibodies war and a procrastination of the fall of the dollar.

29:33.699 --> 29:35.100
You're getting fuked up.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.781
I don't know what that means, dude.

29:38.381 --> 29:41.603
From where I'm sitting, there's a whole bunch of COVID brain going around.

29:43.162 --> 29:58.767
I wouldn't be able to make this slide if they hadn't overextended so far as to put these two jackasses on the same white clot round table.

29:58.947 --> 30:00.887
It's time for answers.

30:01.548 --> 30:09.470
With the largest private donor to the DNC before the pandemic, Steve the fake Kirsch.

30:12.222 --> 30:14.003
We are surrounded by these people.

30:14.063 --> 30:20.187
Unfortunately, I think Brian Hooker is one of these people who got sucked into the idea that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:20.207 --> 30:20.788
would save us.

30:20.848 --> 30:39.240
And all we had to do was get behind him and get him in the White House, just like it says in the epilogue of Jesse Ventura's book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, a sky horse book that preceded the two Andrew Wakefield sky horse books, preceded the James Lyons Wyler sky horse book, and the Judy Mikovits sky horse book.

30:41.787 --> 30:45.729
And Brian Hooker's unvaxxed book comes out in 2023.

30:46.370 --> 30:49.452
I guess they probably promised it would come earlier or something like that.

30:49.912 --> 30:52.974
He'll have more time to work on that later after he gets elected.

30:54.542 --> 31:00.506
And basically what broke it for me with Brian is that in 2013, he said this.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.268
He was vaccine damaged.

31:03.648 --> 31:05.069
He was neurologically damaged.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.511
In condition that we will not call autism.

31:08.671 --> 31:10.212
I don't like the word autism.

31:11.092 --> 31:12.153
He was vaccine damaged.

31:12.513 --> 31:13.934
He was neurologically damaged.

31:14.835 --> 31:17.396
In condition that we will not call autism.

31:17.537 --> 31:19.098
I don't like the word autism.

31:19.978 --> 31:20.999
He was vaccine damaged.

31:21.806 --> 31:36.137
And so that's really important because that's what they're still doing now to people like Mary Talley Bowden and many other doctors that are buying into this wake up to nutrition and processed food and toxins in the environment.

31:36.197 --> 31:40.801
And maybe it's the adjuvants of some vaccines that are also very nasty.

31:42.523 --> 32:10.753
Maybe it's we're giving them to too many people or too early and all these weird questions that this, these anti-vax, you know, fake health freedom movement has been pushing forward instead of intramuscular injection versus ingestion, like Brandy was, instead of intramuscular injection, not being medicine like I was, instead of transfection, not being immunization like I was, even immunization being,

32:11.539 --> 32:15.022
an illusion like Brian Hooker was in 2013.

32:16.563 --> 32:22.988
And that lack of progress from any of these people suggests to me that they are on a script.

32:23.508 --> 32:38.219
Otherwise, they would make some progress in their understanding, especially in light of the certainty that all these people on the internet have, because the certainty is also something that any thinking person should see as a red flag.

32:40.669 --> 32:47.072
And yet there's so much certainty on this podcast in Jack Cruz, it's pretty remarkable.

32:47.472 --> 32:51.433
There's so much certainty in James Lyons Wyler in 2020, it's remarkable.

32:51.853 --> 32:56.295
So much certainty in Kevin McKernan in April of 2020, it's kind of remarkable.

32:56.335 --> 32:59.596
So much certainty in Kevin McCarron in 2020, it's kind of remarkable.

33:00.277 --> 33:03.958
And they haven't grown in their understanding of this narrative at all.

33:04.358 --> 33:08.320
They have tripled down and they have risen in the military,

33:09.651 --> 33:14.272
social programming software suites that we call social media.

33:14.372 --> 33:15.653
That's what you see happening.

33:17.293 --> 33:18.754
That's what you see happening here.

33:18.974 --> 33:21.515
It's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

33:21.555 --> 33:31.858
That's why the Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project is working daily on social media, because he is an agent for the Department of Energy.

33:31.938 --> 33:39.240
He is a national security priority man, working on a national security priority that was established many decades ago.

33:40.646 --> 33:47.863
to invert the American population effectively into experimental animals so that the Human Genome Project could be realized.

33:49.309 --> 34:04.839
that the genomic data and the medical data of all Americans could be effectively stored, computerized, and fed into a machine learning algorithm that could eventually contribute to our better understanding of what right now is an irreducible complexity.

34:04.879 --> 34:11.843
And this moonshot idea, this imaginative idea, is why there is a fake anti-vax movement in America.

34:11.963 --> 34:19.653
The statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology.

34:19.693 --> 34:20.855
And I just gagged at that.

34:22.697 --> 34:23.799
But, you know, he's laughing.

34:23.879 --> 34:26.282
But but this is the same script.

34:27.130 --> 34:45.884
The same script that brought former publishing colleague of Peter Daszak, Andrew Wakefield, over to the United States to recycle a political campaign based on autism that they had already run in the UK that included Polly Tommy on 90 billboards in her bra.

34:47.023 --> 34:49.787
swaying more than six million votes for Prime Minister.

34:49.827 --> 34:52.691
They came to America, they pulled the same long con.

34:53.252 --> 34:58.820
And ever since, everyone from as diverse as Paul Offit to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:58.860 --> 35:02.806
declares him the enemy hero of the anti-vax movement.

35:03.527 --> 35:13.534
And he's still being plugged as a hero by these fake people, including the billionaire with shares in Google that is sometimes the mom of a kid with something.

35:13.954 --> 35:19.598
And this Bitcoin doctor polymath who wears orange glasses because it makes his pineal gland heavier.

35:24.676 --> 35:26.597
And so that's the joke of this, right?

35:26.637 --> 35:27.638
That's the joke of this.

35:27.738 --> 35:33.502
That little child over there is now the head of a whole wing of the FDA.

35:33.562 --> 35:39.146
That guy is the head of the FDA and it is absolutely a malevolent joke on our children.

35:39.306 --> 35:45.691
It is almost, I think, an admission that the American government is already bankrupt and already collapsing.

35:46.573 --> 35:55.241
It's like they have some fake people at the helm of the cruise ship knowing full well that the cruise ship is about to crash into the dock.

35:57.703 --> 36:04.208
And I don't like to be saying that as an American with kids who live in America, who intend to live in America for a long time.

36:04.709 --> 36:05.670
I don't like saying that.

36:06.957 --> 36:17.767
But these are people at the head of a cruise ship wearing the mouse costume of Chuck E. Cheese's pretending to drive the boat.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.489
This is scripted bullshit.

36:20.169 --> 36:22.671
Just like this is scripted bullshit.

36:22.752 --> 36:26.135
This guy has been antagonizing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:26.155 --> 36:30.699
and the anti-vaxx movement of Mary Holland and Joe Mercola.

36:31.159 --> 36:45.710
for more than 15 years he's been writing books about this shit, including a book in 2007 called Vaccinated, which has mRNA title in the title, mRNA vaccines in the title.

36:46.751 --> 36:56.899
It is a script, ladies and gentlemen, it is a national security script that is part of the largest investment in human history, the Human Genome Project.

36:57.665 --> 37:00.107
Wake up and apologize to your kids, ladies and gentlemen.

37:00.147 --> 37:01.548
It's all scripted bullshit.

37:01.588 --> 37:02.109
For what?

37:04.791 --> 37:14.640
Because there was a population pyramid problem to manage, and because the population pyramids tell us that this amount of genetic diversity is never going to be available again.

37:14.720 --> 37:24.128
So they used a little bit of murder and lies to sculpt that population pyramid, and then told us an elaborate mythology about a novel virus as the cause of it.

37:24.949 --> 37:33.655
And the way they were able to do it is because for a decade or more, they've been putting people in place with the precursors of this narrative ready to go.

37:33.675 --> 37:36.357
The script was flawless.

37:37.118 --> 37:42.382
And it is designed to make sure you never realize that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

37:44.989 --> 37:51.277
It's designed to make sure that you don't realize that because then you would realize that intramuscular injection is not a good methodology.

37:51.317 --> 37:57.445
You'd realize that virology is not a high fidelity science and that public health is almost never a good reason.

37:58.544 --> 38:06.087
And that is the same reason, the primary reason why this anti-vax movement had to be in place, the autism movement had to be in place.

38:06.548 --> 38:12.891
It is exactly why Brian Hooker had to use the word autism before the start of the pandemic.

38:13.651 --> 38:25.136
Why he had to be hooked up with James Lyons-Weiler and why James Lyons-Weiler was saying that vaccination prevented diseases were circulating asymptomatically among the vaccinated in 2019.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.318
because they are myths.

38:29.460 --> 38:30.341
They are myths.

38:31.142 --> 38:38.975
And they are myths that are designed to make sure no one ever questions intermuscular injection as a methodology, virology as a science, or public health as a reason.

38:41.553 --> 38:45.835
I've told you before that one of the foundations of this idea is endemicity.

38:46.535 --> 38:53.337
And I have a nice little clip here from the TWIV about two weeks ago to show you that this endemicity is a real thing.

38:53.917 --> 38:57.299
It's a real illusion that they are going to insist on you accepting.

38:57.359 --> 39:09.083
And please understand that Kevin McKernan, Kevin McCairn, Robert Malone, Jay Bhattacharya,

39:10.236 --> 39:18.302
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jessica Rose, Meryl Ness, Mary Holland, they all agree that endemicity is definitely real.

39:18.342 --> 39:29.330
They all agree that one of the dangers of gain of function is potentially that a gain of function virus could go endemic and contribute to all-cause mortality in perpetuity.

39:35.174 --> 39:39.077
A fundamental lie, and listen to these guys throw it down.

39:46.829 --> 39:50.151
first to return because of its infectivity.

39:50.171 --> 39:55.635
And it was predicted to return to endemicity, which means it's continuously circulating and infecting people.

39:55.675 --> 40:03.800
And 83% of simulations after 20 years, whereas the other diseases would not return to endemicity.

40:05.821 --> 40:10.904
But, you know, the percent immunization can affect that.

40:11.184 --> 40:11.364
Right.

40:11.384 --> 40:12.705
That's if nothing changes.

40:13.106 --> 40:13.306
Yes.

40:13.546 --> 40:15.167
Nothing changes from right now.

40:17.355 --> 40:19.877
which it's already been on a decline.

40:20.518 --> 40:20.778
Yeah.

40:22.780 --> 40:29.045
So if you have a 25% reduction in vaccination coverage, polio becomes an endemic in 11% of simulations.

40:29.185 --> 40:32.448
Diphtheria and rubella do not become endemic.

40:32.468 --> 40:40.515
50% reduction, measles returns in 99.8% of simulations after five years to endemicity.

40:42.230 --> 40:51.232
And rubella returns to endemicity in 100% of simulations at 18 years polio and 55% in 19 years.

40:51.692 --> 40:59.853
And diphtheria returns to endemicity in less than 1% of simulations and took more than two decades.

41:01.674 --> 41:09.095
Although they say it does become endemic, diphtheria, when you have even more larger vaccine decline.

41:10.296 --> 41:22.682
So I want to make my cynical comment, which is thinking about declining birth rates has become a national security concern here in the United States and around the world.

41:23.323 --> 41:29.566
And you wonder why people don't want to have kids when the world is not getting safer

41:30.166 --> 41:41.524
as a place to raise children if you have... Oh I know that's why my brother decided not to have kids because because people aren't vaccinating anymore then I'm not going to have any kids because it's just too damn dangerous.

41:45.461 --> 41:53.790
this kind of an outlook, when it used to be, as I said, that the future looked better for me than for my parents.

41:54.231 --> 41:57.194
And many people don't feel that way anymore.

41:57.294 --> 42:01.438
And even if the data didn't say that, that's how they feel.

42:01.759 --> 42:06.304
And these kinds of predictions don't make you feel like it's a great place to have kids.

42:07.388 --> 42:07.569
Yeah.

42:08.089 --> 42:11.092
Oh, the simulademics are real, man.

42:11.392 --> 42:12.993
They're definitely real.

42:13.174 --> 42:18.558
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

42:18.979 --> 42:22.342
The other day, yesterday actually, I tried to make a point about

42:24.077 --> 42:26.338
AI, and I want to try and make that point again.

42:26.358 --> 42:28.759
AI is an illusion.

42:28.779 --> 42:34.361
It is an illusion not that dissimilar to Theranos.

42:34.501 --> 42:36.202
And so yesterday I played this clip.

42:36.242 --> 42:37.622
I want to play it again just for fun.

42:40.623 --> 42:46.145
Gentlemen, people used to say it was impossible to run tests on a single drop of blood.

42:46.465 --> 42:49.006
Well, I fired those people and hired new ones.

42:49.146 --> 42:50.607
And now behold,

42:53.876 --> 42:55.238
Oh, science noise.

42:55.538 --> 43:06.248
With just one drop of blood, our device can tell you exactly which Sopranos character you are without having to take a dumb quiz written by a social media intern.

43:06.448 --> 43:07.329
Why Sopranos?

43:07.649 --> 43:10.952
Because my company is like a criminal enterprise.

43:10.972 --> 43:11.533
All right.

43:11.953 --> 43:15.857
And for no particular reason, I'm going to be behind this curtain for the entire demonstration.

43:16.798 --> 43:19.260
All we need is a tiny blood sample.

43:22.184 --> 43:23.485
Ew, it's doing stuff.

43:28.029 --> 43:29.551
This says Artie Bucco.

43:29.571 --> 43:30.171
Who's that?

43:30.612 --> 43:31.853
Bald guy at the restaurant.

43:32.053 --> 43:32.293
Oh, yeah.

43:32.473 --> 43:33.915
He and Tony were friends growing up.

43:34.255 --> 43:35.176
Ah, right, right, right.

43:35.636 --> 43:37.498
I'm not sure this machine is for us.

43:37.978 --> 43:38.459
Just a sec.

43:38.499 --> 43:40.180
Let me, uh, recalibrate something.

43:43.443 --> 43:43.984
Tony.

43:44.304 --> 43:44.785
All right.

43:45.025 --> 43:46.947
Now this is f****** Walgreens.

43:51.539 --> 43:55.684
By now, we've all heard about Elon Musk's efforts to reshape the U.S.

43:55.724 --> 43:56.164
government.

43:56.805 --> 44:06.035
But tonight, we'll introduce you to another tech billionaire, one who set his sights on radically changing the way the Pentagon buys and uses weapons.

44:06.756 --> 44:12.642
His name is Palmer Luckey, and he's the founder of Andril, a California defense products company.

44:13.303 --> 44:15.105
Lucky says for too long, the U.S.

44:15.145 --> 44:18.927
military has relied on overpriced and outdated technology.

44:19.528 --> 44:22.030
He argues a Tesla has better A.I.

44:22.090 --> 44:22.770
than any U.S.

44:22.811 --> 44:28.615
aircraft, and a Roomba vacuum has better autonomy than most of the Pentagon's weapons systems.

44:29.336 --> 44:31.677
So Andrel is making a line of autonomy.

44:31.758 --> 44:34.860
I don't know about you, but autonomous weapons are what I always think about.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.483
I mean, once I saw a Roomba, I thought, wow, why don't we make a pistol like that?

44:39.121 --> 44:44.364
autonomous weapons that operate using artificial intelligence, no human required.

44:45.044 --> 44:52.769
Some international groups have called those types of weapons killer robots, but Palmer Luckey says it is the future of warfare.

44:54.730 --> 44:57.011
The story will continue in a moment.

45:00.373 --> 45:05.056
I've always said that we need to transition from being the world police to being the world gun store.

45:05.316 --> 45:08.098
Nice, he goes to the same shirt store as McKernan.

45:09.764 --> 45:11.086
Do we want to be the world's gun store?

45:11.186 --> 45:11.587
I think so.

45:11.707 --> 45:12.308
I think we have to.

45:12.468 --> 45:14.271
Says the guy who sells weapons.

45:14.612 --> 45:15.834
See, I agree.

45:15.854 --> 45:16.976
It sounds self-fulfilling.

45:16.996 --> 45:20.602
But you have to remember, I also got into this industry because I believe that.

45:21.069 --> 45:24.851
Palmer Lucky isn't your typical defense industry executive.

45:25.311 --> 45:28.333
His daily uniform, flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt.

45:28.713 --> 45:33.576
As my hairline recedes, trust me, I consider getting a mullet every day.

45:33.736 --> 45:38.999
And in fact, I'll tell you a story about my friend Nathan who died of an aneurysm in 2023 or 4, 3.

45:43.642 --> 45:52.694
He, uh, when he got married, I actually threatened to cut a mullet for their wedding, and his wife did not even remotely think that was funny.

45:52.754 --> 45:55.578
But anyway, just, it's easy to imagine.

45:56.018 --> 45:58.061
I could change Chief Woohoo to have a mullet.

46:02.125 --> 46:02.965
than the military.

46:03.405 --> 46:17.330
But the 32-year-old billionaire is the founder of Andril, whose line of American-made autonomous weapons looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie, and whose slick marketing videos wouldn't be out of place in one.

46:18.830 --> 46:26.893
There's the Roadrunner, a twin, turbo-jet-powered drone interceptor that can take off, identify, and strike.

46:29.628 --> 46:33.190
If it doesn't find a target, it can land and try again.

46:34.811 --> 46:40.254
Andrew also makes headsets, which allow soldiers to see 360 degrees in combat.

46:40.855 --> 46:41.695
And there's this.

46:42.295 --> 46:49.840
It's an electromagnetic warfare system that can be programmed to jam enemy systems, knocking out drone swarms.

46:50.686 --> 46:52.769
It's not some futuristic fantasy.

46:53.230 --> 46:58.417
Andral systems are already being used by the US military and in the war in Ukraine.

46:58.778 --> 47:06.228
We shouldn't be sending our people to stand in other countries, putting our men and women, our sons and daughters, at risk.

47:06.989 --> 47:08.450
for the sovereignty of other nations.

47:08.770 --> 47:13.311
So you'd rather have an American-made product in their hands than our soldiers over there?

47:13.452 --> 47:14.752
Absolutely, every time.

47:14.792 --> 47:17.373
And I think that that's one of the reasons that autonomy is so powerful.

47:17.813 --> 47:20.894
Right now, there's so many weapons systems that require manning.

47:20.914 --> 47:30.338
If I can have one guy commanding and controlling 100 aircraft, that's a lot easier than having to have a pilot in every single one, and it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk.

47:33.018 --> 47:36.359
To be clear, autonomy does not mean remote control.

47:37.000 --> 47:47.444
Once an autonomous weapon is programmed and given a task, it can use artificial intelligence for surveillance or to identify, select and engage targets.

47:47.584 --> 47:55.688
And of course, this creates a massive moral problem in a sense of, you know, who's responsible, then if something happens, it's not supposed to happen.

47:56.208 --> 48:06.862
And that narrative is already being tested out in the Gaza Strip, because there, all of the data for targeting is being AI run through and trained.

48:08.204 --> 48:11.108
And if you didn't know that, you should have, because Palantir is doing it.

48:12.150 --> 48:30.524
So don't for one second think that the fight over Gaza is for nothing or that there's something not to fight for, but just realize that most of the fireworks are smoke and mirrors because what's really going on there is a high-tech military lab that everybody is potentially benefiting from.

48:30.584 --> 48:35.548
You see, this is a real, real nasty trap we're in.

48:40.072 --> 48:41.273
No operator needed.

48:44.272 --> 48:45.733
It's a scary idea to some people.

48:45.833 --> 48:48.014
It's a scary idea, but I mean, that's the world we live in.

48:48.094 --> 48:54.416
I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapons system that doesn't have any level of intelligence at all.

48:54.657 --> 48:57.118
There's no moral high ground to making a landmine that can't tell the difference.

48:57.138 --> 49:06.522
Now, every time that you've done a CAPTCHA thing, you have been training an AI to recognize a motorcycle or recognize a truck or click on every square that has a bridge.

49:07.665 --> 49:18.449
And so you have been doing the work of programming the AI, training the AI, so that they can pretend that this thing is deciding that that's the right truck.

49:18.890 --> 49:24.752
But actually, it's just using the training that we've done on the internet, proving ourselves that we're really a human.

49:27.830 --> 49:32.115
I hope you can see it, because we've been in the trap for a long time, guys.

49:32.135 --> 49:37.601
The difference between a school bus full of children and Russian armor, it's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons.

49:37.821 --> 49:40.224
It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons.

49:40.564 --> 49:46.711
Lucky showed us how those so-called smart weapons can be synchronized on Andrewll's AI platform.

49:47.132 --> 49:48.033
It's called Lattice.

49:48.573 --> 50:03.920
Lattice collects data from various sensors and sources, including satellites, drones, radar, and cameras, allowing, he says, the AI to analyze, move assets, and execute missions faster than a human.

50:04.540 --> 50:15.770
If you were having to require the human operator to actually map every single action and say, hey, do this, if that, then this, it would take so long to manage it that you would be better off just remotely piloting it.

50:16.110 --> 50:20.774
It's the AI on board all these weapons that makes it possible to make it so easy.

50:21.054 --> 50:23.316
There are lots of people who go, oh, AI, I don't know.

50:23.376 --> 50:24.177
I don't trust it.

50:24.337 --> 50:25.158
It's going to go rogue.

50:25.990 --> 50:34.699
I would say that it is something to be aware of, but in the grand scheme of things, things to be afraid of, there's things that I'm much more terrified of.

50:34.859 --> 50:42.928
And I'm a lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than AI deciding that it's going to wipe us all out.

50:43.300 --> 50:49.405
Lucky says all Angel's weapons have a kill switch that allow a human operator to intervene if needed.

50:49.705 --> 50:55.449
I mean, you know, I just want to make sure you understand what kind of trap you're in by showing you what kind of trap you're in.

50:55.489 --> 51:01.054
Look, I don't know if you're aware, but a GoPro has infrared.

51:01.074 --> 51:05.377
Do you see it?

51:12.462 --> 51:12.923
Do you see it?

51:15.029 --> 51:23.818
That's the infrared camera of my iPhone trying to find my face, sampling it from whatever angle that I happen to have my phone at the time that I click it.

51:23.838 --> 51:26.861
It could be in here, it could have been here or there or anywhere.

51:27.521 --> 51:36.010
And so the entire time that I've owned this phone, it's been taking photographs from all different angles on my face until it's basically created or

51:36.710 --> 51:53.506
rather collected enough data to create a very high resolution model of my face and then use that as a basis for confirming whether this picture fits that or not and every one of us with an iPhone is getting sampled every time look at it it starts

51:56.092 --> 51:57.233
Zoom does that too.

51:57.673 --> 51:59.674
The Sony PlayStation did that too.

52:00.114 --> 52:02.916
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been in the trap for a long time.

52:02.976 --> 52:06.918
That's why social media is so effective at screwing with us right now.

52:07.658 --> 52:13.201
That's the reason why social media was able to keep you and me and everybody else focused on the lab leak for so long.

52:14.402 --> 52:21.666
Because with coordinated lying on social media, it is almost imperceptibly nasty.

52:23.117 --> 52:31.727
But the Secretary General of the United Nations has called lethal autonomous weapons, quote, politically unacceptable and morally repugnant.

52:32.108 --> 52:37.213
When people say to you, look, it's evil, how do you respond to that?

52:37.921 --> 52:42.124
I usually don't bother, because if I am going to argue with them, I usually poke it.

52:42.144 --> 52:47.268
I'm like, OK, so do you think that NATO should be armed with squirt guns or slingshots?

52:47.308 --> 52:48.729
How about sternly worded letters?

52:48.809 --> 52:49.449
Would you like that?

52:49.469 --> 52:57.715
Would you like it if NATO just, they just have a bunch of guys sitting at typewriters, 1,000 monkeys writing letters to Vladimir Putin begging him to not invade Ukraine?

52:57.975 --> 53:01.858
Our entire society exists because of a credible backstop of violence.

53:02.458 --> 53:04.860
threatened by the United States and our allies all over the world.

53:04.880 --> 53:05.620
And thank goodness for it.

53:29.707 --> 53:39.290
It might sound flip, but part of Palmer Luckey's philosophy is that autonomous weapons ultimately promote peace by scaring adversaries away.

53:39.750 --> 53:49.534
My position has been that the United States needs to arm our allies and partners around the world so that they can be prickly porcupines that nobody wants to step on.

53:50.054 --> 53:51.855
Nobody wants to bite them.

53:52.375 --> 53:55.536
In your mind, is it enough just to have all these things as deterrents?

53:56.764 --> 53:58.946
Or do they have to be deployed and used?

53:59.026 --> 54:00.828
They have to believe that you can use them.

54:01.368 --> 54:08.375
By the end of this year, Angel says it will have secured more than $6 billion in government contracts worldwide.

54:08.715 --> 54:20.286
When you first came into this space and you're a tech guy in a Hawaiian shirt and you're walking into the Pentagon, maybe in flip-flops, I don't know, were you welcomed with open arms?

54:20.814 --> 54:25.276
There were a very small number of people who welcomed me with open arms and everyone else thought that I was nuts.

54:25.876 --> 54:32.498
Nuts because there hasn't been a new company in the defense industry in a significant way since the end of the Cold War.

54:33.159 --> 54:37.520
For decades, five defense contractors called the primes have dominated.

54:37.620 --> 54:44.403
You would be surprised how many people's parents work for these companies that have messed with my family over the last five years.

54:44.483 --> 54:47.764
If I started showing you a list of it, it would probably shock you.

54:54.215 --> 54:55.696
and none of them donate money.

54:56.216 --> 54:57.037
In the industry.

54:57.737 --> 55:00.859
Typically, the primes present an idea to the Pentagon.

55:01.279 --> 55:08.004
If the Pentagon buys it, the government pays for the company to develop it, even if it's late or goes over budget.

55:08.724 --> 55:12.687
Lucky started NREL to flip that procurement structure on its head.

55:13.067 --> 55:19.831
The idea behind NREL was to build not a defense contractor, but a defense product company.

55:20.231 --> 55:20.832
What's the difference?

55:21.636 --> 55:25.879
Contractors, in general, are paid to do work, whether or not it succeeds.

55:26.319 --> 55:28.260
A product company has a very different mentality.

55:28.661 --> 55:29.801
You're putting in your own money.

55:30.122 --> 55:31.322
You're putting in your own time.

55:31.643 --> 55:41.849
My vision was to build a company that would show up not with a PowerPoint describing how taxpayers are going to pay all my bills, but with a working product where all the risk has been baked out.

55:42.270 --> 55:46.953
It will work for enough things that you can save our country hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

55:47.398 --> 55:48.579
It may not surprise you.

55:48.659 --> 55:58.146
Presumably like the AI that we were told yesterday is getting better and better at doing everything and learning and going out on the internet and coming back with new skills.

55:58.587 --> 56:09.996
Presumably his AI weapons go out into the field and learn better ways to fly and learn better ways to kill their target and learn better ways to, you see, it's all an elaborate hoax.

56:10.919 --> 56:18.743
And they put these kinds of clowns, just like the lady of the head of Epic with her, with her Alice in Wonderland style building.

56:18.783 --> 56:23.765
And this guy with his elaborate museum in the front of his, of his company.

56:23.845 --> 56:26.286
These are all elaborate illusions.

56:27.347 --> 56:32.049
And they are probably illusions that are established by our military industrial complex.

56:32.089 --> 56:36.651
And it is very scary to think that way, but you're not helpless.

56:37.824 --> 56:39.506
You can take back control of America.

56:39.546 --> 56:41.087
You can take back control of the narrative.

56:41.127 --> 56:45.912
And most importantly, the first step you can do is get off social media.

56:45.952 --> 56:48.194
Palmer Luckey's father was a car salesman.

56:48.675 --> 56:52.458
His mother took on the role of homeschooling him and his three sisters.

56:53.139 --> 57:00.406
Luckey says he was fascinated by electronics and spent a lot of time tinkering in his parents' garage in Long Beach, California.

57:01.206 --> 57:06.608
By age 19, his tinkering turned into Oculus, the virtual reality company.

57:07.128 --> 57:10.730
And at 21, Palmer Luckey fulfilled every young family's dream.

57:10.750 --> 57:13.111
And that's what makes it the most bullshit, right?

57:13.171 --> 57:25.416
Because where it should have led him was to become an expert in first-person view flying and in drone racing and in that kind of thing.

57:25.456 --> 57:28.277
But instead, it went to let's get rid of the pilot

57:29.295 --> 57:40.240
Nobody that flies remote control helicopters or drones thinks, oh wow, it'd be cool if I could get rid of the goggles or if I could put down the controller, cause this is really stupid.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.681
I don't like doing that.

57:42.041 --> 57:45.963
And I definitely don't like building them and tweaking the way that they fly and testing it out.

57:46.303 --> 57:47.243
Cause that's all gay.

57:48.123 --> 57:53.426
What I'd really like to do is just put down the controller, take off of the glasses and let the drone kill things.

57:55.393 --> 58:01.478
Nobody that goes into remote control aircraft thinks that they would rather not do it.

58:03.380 --> 58:12.327
Nobody loses the fascination for flying because, oh, I don't know, I could make more money if I stopped flying and trained them to kill people automatically.

58:13.428 --> 58:24.357
Nobody, nobody who was at a bench when they were a kid soldering RC cars together or RC aircraft together gets there.

58:25.197 --> 58:27.118
That is ridiculous.

58:27.478 --> 58:36.203
I want to make virtual reality goggles instead of the smallest spy drone that can fly the fastest in the highest headwind possible?

58:36.783 --> 58:37.224
No.

58:38.144 --> 58:39.325
This is nonsense.

58:40.365 --> 58:52.372
This guy was recruited to play this joke of a part as part of an elaborate national security scheme that of course ultimately ties back to the Human Genome Project all the way back to the Manhattan Project.

58:52.432 --> 58:53.893
It's one continuous narrative.

58:54.807 --> 58:59.171
founder's dream when he sold Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion.

58:59.211 --> 59:02.394
The minor kid graced the covers of magazines.

59:02.454 --> 59:08.059
Is that the same way that Steve Kersh sold the optical mouse to somebody?

59:08.219 --> 59:09.220
Come on.

59:11.062 --> 59:14.045
But two years later, he was fired from Facebook.

59:14.385 --> 59:15.206
Why did you get fired?

59:16.055 --> 59:31.349
Well, you know, everyone's got a different story, but it boils down to, I gave $9,000 to a political... Nobody wants to know why I got fired from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, not even my friend Jay Bhattacharya, who's now at the head of NIH, talking about how everybody was censored.

59:32.650 --> 59:34.091
Not even Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:34.211 --> 59:39.516
paid me for a year and a half to help him write a book that I told him at the end was not quite right, and he wouldn't, eh.

59:40.777 --> 59:41.438
They took him away.

59:43.993 --> 59:53.383
Nobody wants to know why CHD fired me even though I can tell you very succinctly it's because Mary Holland fired me and it's because I talked about Robert Malone and his relationship with Meryl Nass.

59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.862
Oh, oh, oh, nobody wants to know, but everybody wants to know what happened to him.

01:00:00.902 --> 01:00:02.683
Why did you get fired from Facebook?

01:00:02.763 --> 01:00:04.784
For Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton.

01:00:04.844 --> 01:00:09.406
To be a Trump supporter in 2016, this was at the height of the election.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:17.209
Interesting, he has the same exact political trajectory of Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.211
and Tulsi Gabbard and all these people.

01:00:21.272 --> 01:00:23.453
Even Steve Kirsch was a huge fan.

01:00:23.893 --> 01:00:26.774
Even Sasha Lotapova was a huge Hillary fan.

01:00:27.655 --> 01:00:30.717
So said so on Alex Jones in 2019.

01:00:31.117 --> 01:00:35.799
So a lot of these people were huge Democrat Hillary fans and they all converted to Trump.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.312
insanity and derangement in Silicon Valley.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:46.194
And so I think that a lot of people thought... It's all over ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:46.254 --> 01:00:52.398
There's one reason why they're doing this because this is a once in a multi-generation opportunity to get this data.

01:00:52.838 --> 01:00:53.539
And they know that.

01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:55.220
The data they want is your grandkids.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.822
The data they want is your grandkids.

01:00:57.882 --> 01:01:02.046
The way they're going to enslave your grandkids is through narrative control on social media.

01:01:02.106 --> 01:01:06.450
And so the way to break this system is to get your kids off of social media.

01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:11.575
For them to realize that social media is a militarized trap for their brain.

01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:14.819
I don't care how you get there.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:17.521
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.204
The goal is to what?

01:01:24.784 --> 01:01:26.125
What time is it?

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:37.052
Game time!

01:01:37.173 --> 01:01:38.393
Woo!

01:01:39.034 --> 01:01:40.115
Sasha's a liar.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.352
Watch him kill each other.

01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:08.694
It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said.

01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:10.856
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead.

01:02:10.976 --> 01:02:14.700
I got love for my brothers, but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.402
We gotta start making changes.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:19.405
Learn to see me as your brother instead of two distant strangers.

01:02:19.745 --> 01:02:20.906
And that's how it's supposed to be.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:23.128
How can a devil take a brother if he's close to me?

01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:27.012
I let it go back to when we played as kids, but then it changed.

01:02:27.052 --> 01:02:27.773
That's the way it is.

01:02:34.773 --> 01:02:37.154
Things will never be the same.

01:02:39.094 --> 01:02:41.615
That's just the way it is.

01:02:42.455 --> 01:02:45.996
Oh, yeah.

01:02:47.756 --> 01:02:50.777
That's just the way it is.

01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:54.317
Things will never be the same.

01:03:01.813 --> 01:03:02.814
I see no changes.

01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:04.574
All I see is racist faces.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.494
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races.

01:03:06.674 --> 01:03:07.134
We under.

01:03:07.255 --> 01:03:09.635
I wonder what it takes to make this one better place.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.395
Let's erase the wasted.

01:03:11.415 --> 01:03:12.336
Take the evil out the people.

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:13.376
They'll be acting right.

01:03:13.416 --> 01:03:15.516
Cause vote black and white and smoke a crack tonight.

01:03:15.776 --> 01:03:17.697
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other.

01:03:17.757 --> 01:03:20.017
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:23.438
And although it seems evident, we ain't ready to see a black president.

01:03:23.518 --> 01:03:25.798
It ain't a secret or a concealed fact.

01:03:25.838 --> 01:03:28.099
Our penitentiary's black and it's filled with blacks.

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:29.539
But some things will never be.

01:03:31.977 --> 01:03:34.698
Now tell me what's a mother to do?

01:03:34.739 --> 01:03:36.579
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.701
You gotta operate the easy way.

01:03:38.721 --> 01:03:39.961
I made a G today.

01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:41.362
But you made it in a sleazy way.

01:03:41.602 --> 01:03:42.803
Selling crack to the kids.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:43.383
I gotta get paid.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:45.584
But hey, that's the way it is.

01:03:45.964 --> 01:03:46.405
Come on.

01:03:46.505 --> 01:03:47.845
Come on.

01:03:48.246 --> 01:03:52.208
That's just the way it is.

01:03:52.548 --> 01:03:54.389
Things will never be the same.

01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:12.288
Things will never be the same.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:17.270
That's just the way it is.

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:18.631
Oh, yeah.

01:04:19.211 --> 01:04:20.512
We gotta make a change.

01:04:20.592 --> 01:04:25.074
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes.

01:04:25.634 --> 01:04:27.315
Let's change the way we eat.

01:04:27.355 --> 01:04:28.796
Let's change the way we live.

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:30.956
And let's change the way we treat each other.

01:04:31.297 --> 01:04:35.979
You see, the old way wasn't working, so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive.

01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:37.760
And still I see no changes.

01:05:04.851 --> 01:05:29.626
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I got a snake strap And I never get to lay back Cause I always got to worry about the payback Some fuck that I roughed up way back Coming back after all these years Righty-tac-tac-tac-tac That's the way it is That's just the way it is Things will never be the same

01:05:40.334 --> 01:05:44.439
That's just the way it is.

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:49.044
Things will never be the same.

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:51.807
That's just the way it is.

01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:52.268
Oh, yeah.

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.370
so so

01:06:21.188 --> 01:06:23.150
And once more, good morning, everybody.

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:29.636
I'm still happy to have you here for Dig a Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:06:30.176 --> 01:06:37.082
The second half of the show today, still me, still Jonathan Cooey coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:06:37.482 --> 01:06:40.345
You can still find a lot of my work on the Woodhouse 76 substack.

01:06:42.407 --> 01:07:08.030
No use reiterating the fact they argue with a lot of people using my watered-down ideas there And it is written by a trader in America named Jessica Hockett And she is coordinating with a couple people from outside of America including Jonathan Engler Nick Hudson and others most of them are members of Panda where I presented three times they lost those videos, but they use those ideas as part of their shtick and

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:12.431
And they've raised a lot of money with their pseudo objections to the narrative.

01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:18.013
All basically ideas they pirated from my presentations to their organization.

01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:21.534
And yeah, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:21.614 --> 01:07:24.675
is just a victim of this narrative control scheme.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.135
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:30.976
If you're going to share, please share stream.gigaom.bio because we do pay for that one.

01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:35.238
And if you need notification, please send an email to gigaomhq at

01:07:36.738 --> 01:07:39.799
proton.me, so my wife can put you on the list.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.502
If you want to send something to the house, please send it to Dr. J at P.O.

01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:46.723
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102.

01:07:47.763 --> 01:08:01.290
It is May 21st, 2025, RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injections or dumb transfection was a crime, and the population pyramids are a real problem that these guys are managing.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:12.059
Or you could say taking advantage of, you know, writing their own narrative about a predictable outcome.

01:08:12.559 --> 01:08:13.881
I'm gonna fade this out.

01:08:15.635 --> 01:08:17.756
so that you can hear this gayness.

01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:20.297
Whoops, why didn't that work?

01:08:20.617 --> 01:08:21.677
Wasn't that playing?

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:22.758
Shouldn't that play?

01:08:24.318 --> 01:08:25.399
Shouldn't this play?

01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:26.739
Didn't I do that right?

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.440
Okay, let me just escape here quick.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.981
We might have a little problem with memory.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:32.921
Let me just check to make sure.

01:08:32.941 --> 01:08:36.023
This is supposed to play automatically.

01:08:36.623 --> 01:08:37.783
The volume is high.

01:08:37.843 --> 01:08:38.744
Let's try that again.

01:08:38.764 --> 01:08:40.424
I think we just have a little glitch there.

01:08:40.904 --> 01:08:42.125
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:08:43.428 --> 01:08:44.734
Thank you very much for being here.

01:08:44.774 --> 01:08:45.558
There it is.

01:08:45.698 --> 01:08:46.140
There it is.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:58.967
When they did this Siebertown Hall yesterday, they started by putting a placeholder on X, actually.

01:08:59.028 --> 01:09:03.532
They did this live on X, which I think is kind of traitorous.

01:09:03.632 --> 01:09:09.076
I don't think they did it live on YouTube, although they did post the video there about 13 hours ago.

01:09:09.537 --> 01:09:13.460
And so you can see a very subtle, continuous hat tip to

01:09:14.381 --> 01:09:20.085
Substack and X. And they're even doing it now with official posts in the United States government.

01:09:20.505 --> 01:09:23.046
And I think this is nothing short of traitorous.

01:09:23.447 --> 01:09:27.989
And so, of course, they started with very American sounding music.

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:35.274
And these are two very un-American men, not born in America and definitely not with allegiance to America.

01:09:35.374 --> 01:09:35.974
I'm sorry.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:37.235
That's what I feel.

01:09:37.675 --> 01:09:38.556
That's what I see.

01:09:38.936 --> 01:09:42.518
And I think their track record of traitorous behavior is

01:09:43.519 --> 01:09:44.639
five years strong.

01:09:45.039 --> 01:09:47.740
So let's just take some notes and see if we don't vomit.

01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:52.882
Let's take some notes and see if we don't vomit.

01:09:52.902 --> 01:09:53.362
The U.S.

01:09:53.382 --> 01:09:57.003
Food and Drug Administration's announcement about COVID-19 vaccine policy.

01:09:57.523 --> 01:09:58.564
I'm Dr. Vinay Prasad.

01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:12.408
I'm the incoming director here at CBER, the Biologic Center, and I'm pleased to be joined by the commissioner today as I walk you through, the American people, directly through our ideas and thinking and our framework, which we call an evidence-based approach to COVID-19 vaccination.

01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:18.978
So those of you who follow the New England Journal may note that this morning at 11 a.m.

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:23.164
Eastern Daylight Time, we have our article appearing in the New England Journal in a sounding board.

01:10:24.026 --> 01:10:28.332
It explains our rationale, our thinking about COVID-19 policy and the vaccine space.

01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:29.634
I'm gonna walk you through it here.

01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:32.085
But first, just a little bit of background.

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:33.946
Does it seem like his voice is off?

01:10:34.126 --> 01:10:35.226
I don't know why that is.

01:10:35.286 --> 01:10:38.327
It's somehow or another, when I recorded it, it's off.

01:10:38.447 --> 01:10:39.667
Does it sound like it's off?

01:10:40.108 --> 01:10:41.108
I'm sorry if it is.

01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:48.310
About me, I went to high school in La Porte, Indiana, and I went on to do my undergraduate at Michigan State University.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.890
Go green.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.991
Okay, so he went to high school in La Porte, Indiana.

01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:54.972
Now, the only reason why you say that is because you weren't born there.

01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:03.132
So it's possible that he came here as late as like 16 or 17 years old.

01:11:07.053 --> 01:11:10.674
It's possible he doesn't even really know what American culture really is.

01:11:12.515 --> 01:11:18.677
You know, homecoming was still really weird when he was here and didn't understand what was going on with letter jackets and stuff like that.

01:11:19.037 --> 01:11:20.178
Didn't know what a letterman was.

01:11:23.544 --> 01:11:30.709
I did my medical degree at the University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, and stayed on in Chicago to do my residency in internal medicine at Northwestern University.

01:11:31.009 --> 01:11:32.170
It is not sped up.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:33.311
It is not sped up.

01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:35.252
It might just be the audio of that video.

01:11:35.663 --> 01:11:43.687
Then I was privileged enough to come here to DC to work in the National Cancer Institute, where I did fellowships in hematology and oncology and cancer prevention.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:55.533
And during those years, I also completed my... And of course, training at the National Cancer Institute means that he has accepted the idea that retroviruses and genetic vulnerabilities are the cause of cancer.

01:11:59.454 --> 01:12:05.577
And it also means that he is a perfect candidate for a Johns Hopkins Master's in Public Health.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:14.682
And so he has been through all the training camps, you know, he's been to all of the

01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:21.670
all of the places, the requisite sort of training camps necessary to take part in this bullshit.

01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:26.974
And he has auditioned continuously for five years on YouTube.

01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:29.656
I have a master's in public health at Johns Hopkins University.

01:12:30.377 --> 01:12:40.665
And for the last decade or so, I've been a professor and physician at Oregon Health and Science University and then the University of California, San Francisco, where I predominantly see patients in the county hospital, San Francisco General Hospital.

01:12:41.385 --> 01:12:48.287
And I want to also preface this by saying that I'm a longstanding believer in and have written many, or at least two books on the topic of evidence-based medicine.

01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:49.067
Hold on one second.

01:12:49.467 --> 01:12:51.207
I'm just going to stop this for a second.

01:12:51.527 --> 01:12:55.788
If my voice is in time, then I'm going to see if I can pull this off really quick.

01:12:56.849 --> 01:12:57.589
Let me see.

01:12:57.889 --> 01:13:02.250
Seiber Town Hall.

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:03.050
Does that work?

01:13:04.485 --> 01:13:12.947
Yes, so I'm just going to download this quick, and then I'll be able to probably just play it in the thing.

01:13:13.907 --> 01:13:15.848
Let's see how long it's going to take to download this.

01:13:18.448 --> 01:13:19.649
It's not going to take very long at all.

01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:20.649
Do you mind if I try that?

01:13:21.269 --> 01:13:24.670
If my voice is still in sync, then I think I can fix this.

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.631
One second left and here we go converting.

01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:30.692
30, 50, delete this insert video from this device.

01:13:30.712 --> 01:13:31.112
Here we go.

01:13:31.172 --> 01:13:32.713
Where is it downloading?

01:13:32.753 --> 01:13:33.934
Is that right?

01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:34.274
Is that it?

01:13:58.666 --> 01:13:59.546
It's gotta be it, right?

01:13:59.566 --> 01:14:02.967
I think that's it.

01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:05.108
Is it going in?

01:14:06.769 --> 01:14:08.549
Ooh, let's see.

01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:09.450
Is this the right one?

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:12.310
Is this working?

01:14:18.593 --> 01:14:18.933
Sorry.

01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:21.333
Ooh, I'm gonna get mad.

01:14:22.554 --> 01:14:23.254
Let me save it.

01:14:24.695 --> 01:14:25.775
And then let's start it again.

01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:30.216
Thank you very much for confirming that I am in sync.

01:14:30.296 --> 01:14:30.776
That's good.

01:14:31.117 --> 01:14:33.158
I do think for most people I should be in sync.

01:14:33.198 --> 01:14:38.340
If I'm not, you just have to refresh or, you know, Twitch or something is messing with us.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:39.641
And of course that's possible.

01:14:41.422 --> 01:14:42.362
It's saved.

01:14:42.442 --> 01:14:44.623
Let's see if we can start this now.

01:14:44.743 --> 01:14:46.805
I think this is the right video, right?

01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:48.105
It should be good.

01:14:48.726 --> 01:14:50.366
Let's just do it.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.247
Slideshow.

01:14:55.239 --> 01:14:57.020
I mean, where did it download it though?

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.320
It downloaded it there, right?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.340
Yeah, that's where it should be.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.981
Let's see if this is working.

01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:05.942
Delete, insert video from this device.

01:15:07.742 --> 01:15:08.863
Ah, I was in the wrong folder.

01:15:08.903 --> 01:15:11.724
This folder here is where I want to be, because that was that.

01:15:11.744 --> 01:15:12.984
There we go.

01:15:13.144 --> 01:15:13.804
That's better.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:14.664
Sorry about that.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:16.585
Send to the back.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.718
Playback automatically.

01:15:19.878 --> 01:15:21.539
Volume is fine.

01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:23.120
Here we go.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:23.980
Sorry about that.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.401
Again, my apologies.

01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:28.242
Sometimes the director is a little behind.

01:15:28.803 --> 01:15:31.884
Here we go.

01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:35.146
Oh, that's going to be, of course, starting now after I get rid of those things.

01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:35.666
But that's good.

01:15:35.946 --> 01:15:36.767
Oh, come on.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:39.368
Still not quite there yet.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:39.948
Let me see.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:40.749
One more thing.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.269
Oh, yeah, that goes here.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:44.210
And now it will work.

01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:46.672
I can see it now.

01:15:46.972 --> 01:15:47.412
It will work.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.733
Oh, the directing of your own show.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:52.994
It's tricky.

01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:53.774
It's tricky.

01:15:54.835 --> 01:15:55.656
Should be starting now.

01:15:56.817 --> 01:15:57.297
There we go.

01:15:57.377 --> 01:15:58.978
Welcome everybody to the U.S.

01:15:59.018 --> 01:16:02.641
Food and Drug Administration's announcement about COVID-19 vaccine policy.

01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:04.202
I'm Dr. Vinay Prasad.

01:16:04.302 --> 01:16:17.271
I'm the incoming director here at CBER, the Biologic Center, and I'm pleased to be joined by the commissioner today as I walk you through the American people directly through our ideas and thinking and our framework, which we call an evidence-based approach to COVID-19 vaccination.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:18.352
It still looks off to me.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.604
So those of you who follow the New England Journal may note that this morning at 11 a.m.

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:28.768
Eastern Daylight Time, we have our article appearing in the New England Journal in a sounding board.

01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:33.953
It explains our rationale, our thinking about COVID-19 policy and the vaccine space.

01:16:34.073 --> 01:16:35.254
I'm gonna walk you through it here.

01:16:36.476 --> 01:16:38.197
But first, just a little bit of background about me.

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.839
I went to high school in La Porte, Indiana.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.782
And I went on to do my undergraduate at Michigan State University.

01:16:45.002 --> 01:16:45.383
Go green.

01:16:45.983 --> 01:16:53.129
I did my medical degree at the University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Medicine, and stayed on in Chicago to do my residency in internal medicine at Northwestern University.

01:16:53.809 --> 01:17:01.836
Then I was privileged enough to come here to DC to work in the National Cancer Institute, where I did fellowships in hematology and oncology and cancer prevention.

01:17:02.296 --> 01:17:06.200
And during those years, I also completed my master's in public health at Johns Hopkins University.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:17.209
And for the last decade or so, I've been a professor and physician at Oregon Health and Science University and then the University of California, San Francisco, where I predominantly see patients in the county hospital, San Francisco General Hospital.

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:39.160
And I want to also preface this by saying that I'm a longstanding believer in and have written at least two books on the topic of evidence-based medicine.

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:42.631
So I believe the purpose of the U.S.

01:17:42.652 --> 01:17:48.994
Food and Drug Administration is always and only to act in the best interests of the American people, and this document is motivated by that spirit.

01:17:49.814 --> 01:17:52.495
People and patients are our number one stakeholder.

01:17:53.395 --> 01:17:59.838
And the FDA will continue to balance regulatory flexibility with gold standard science, and we make that clear in this document.

01:18:00.728 --> 01:18:01.810
This is an important message.

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:06.015
Randomized control trials are not always needed in medical science.

01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:08.359
That's been my position for more than 15 years now.

01:18:08.859 --> 01:18:11.343
But they are sometimes needed in medical science.

01:18:11.703 --> 01:18:14.868
And this document walks you through where they are and where they aren't needed.

01:18:16.957 --> 01:18:26.845
In terms of COVID-19 further background, I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters.

01:18:27.045 --> 01:18:34.511
Wow, so that's funny because he knew that was gonna be a contentious, useful issue already back in 2022.

01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:41.836
And 2022 was when he was, of course, streaming with ZDogg and Marty McCary,

01:18:42.897 --> 01:18:47.402
on YouTube repeatedly six or eight times that year and the following year.

01:18:48.984 --> 01:18:58.814
There are some Americans out there who are worried that the FDA has not fully documented and interrogated the safety harms of these products and they are categorically opposed to these products.

01:18:59.614 --> 01:19:05.781
There are also some Americans, we also have to recognize, who are desperate for additional protection and they demand these products.

01:19:07.654 --> 01:19:16.040
But the truth is that most doctors and most of the public are entirely uncertain, and that is reflected in low vaccine uptake of these products.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:29.709
Just a couple figures, one figure from the CDC shows uptake by racial groups over time, over the last season, and the other statistic that less than one in six healthcare workers are getting the COVID-19 booster shot.

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:44.040
And the truth is that for many Americans, we simply do not know the answer to whether or not they should be getting the seventh or eighth or ninth or 10th COVID-19 booster as the current policy would have us go down the road of.

01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:48.182
So FDA thinking has evolved on this topic.

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:50.884
With changing evidence, we have a changing regulatory framework.

01:19:51.444 --> 01:19:52.325
And what has changed?

01:19:52.365 --> 01:19:59.129
Well, we have a population where many Americans have been multiply infected with COVID-19, sometimes without even knowing they had COVID-19.

01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:05.254
The risk of severe disease and hospitalization, thank goodness, has fallen among the American people.

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:08.229
the efficacy of repeat doses.

01:20:08.909 --> 01:20:18.231
And so he has perpetuated or acquiesced to the myth that there is asymptomatic infection, multiple infections.

01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:18.951
You never know.

01:20:18.971 --> 01:20:20.972
You could have added multiple times.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:23.473
And it's spreading everywhere.

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:26.773
He's essentially saying it's an endemic phenomenon.

01:20:26.914 --> 01:20:31.795
The products of these vaccines to further reduce severe disease and symptomatic illness is uncertain.

01:20:32.782 --> 01:20:39.124
And there are important safety considerations whose long-term impact is not fully known, and we will continue to monitor those closely.

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:43.265
So FDA's strategy in this space, here's what we're gonna do.

01:20:43.645 --> 01:20:56.969
We will hold this year's Vaccine Advisory Committee later this week on Thursday, and that's a committee of experts that help FDA decide which target strains, which antigens to recommend for this year's vaccine that companies target.

01:20:58.001 --> 01:20:58.541
and going forward.

01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:03.285
So keep in mind, he's talking about specifically the COVID-19 vaccine and what should go in it.

01:21:03.645 --> 01:21:08.348
Forward, we will apply the following evidence-based framework to evaluate all the COVID-19 vaccines.

01:21:10.069 --> 01:21:17.474
So based on prior immunologic endpoints, that means proof that the vaccine can create antibodies in people, companies.

01:21:17.975 --> 01:21:27.121
Oh, so immunologic endpoints for our friend Vinay Prasad remain to be, and remain to be antibodies.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:41.221
I-M-M-U-N-I-T-Y, that's what I got, bodies anti.

01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:43.022
Saturday Night Live.

01:21:53.627 --> 01:22:09.395
Nice, so they'll approve transfection for all the people that are the part of this weighted, top-weighted population pyramid that could potentially bankrupt America if they require half a million dollars a year of Medicaid every six months until they're dead.

01:22:10.515 --> 01:22:11.896
What a great way to get rid of them.

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:20.088
So if you're older than 65 or you're high risk for COVID-19, we're going to use the immunologic endpoints we've been using to grant approval.

01:22:20.448 --> 01:22:22.309
This is a tremendously broad category.

01:22:22.349 --> 01:22:30.336
This effectively means 100 to 200 million Americans, those with the most favorable benefit to harm balance, will be covered by such approvals.

01:22:31.317 --> 01:22:38.343
The CDC has a- 200 million Americans will be covered by such approvals.

01:22:39.932 --> 01:22:53.421
wow i don't i don't have a red alarm i need to something like i mean you know like the the sound on the on the hell video might be actually a great dirt dirt dirt what what is this

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:58.276
has a list of the conditions that qualify as high risk for severe COVID-19.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:22:59.436
You can peruse the list.

01:22:59.496 --> 01:23:00.876
It's also in our New England Journal paper.

01:23:01.396 --> 01:23:02.597
It is a broad list.

01:23:02.637 --> 01:23:03.597
There's a lot of things on.

01:23:03.877 --> 01:23:13.339
A broad list that includes, let me see here for a second, if I can quick make the switch.

01:23:13.639 --> 01:23:15.359
Wow, that's a lot of stuff there.

01:23:15.539 --> 01:23:20.140
Everybody who's at risk of severe COVID needs to take this.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:21.901
So if you have cancer, you gotta take it.

01:23:21.981 --> 01:23:22.241
Wow.

01:23:23.049 --> 01:23:25.171
You have chronic kidney disease, you should take it.

01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:27.253
Cerebrovascular disease, you should take it.

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:38.682
Even though it could exacerbate any of these conditions by exacerbating the autoimmunity they might already have developed to the tissue in question.

01:23:38.802 --> 01:23:40.043
It's very interesting.

01:23:40.123 --> 01:23:41.444
Cystic fibrosis.

01:23:41.745 --> 01:23:42.445
Oh, wow.

01:23:42.645 --> 01:23:43.146
All of this.

01:23:44.067 --> 01:23:44.747
Oh my goodness.

01:23:44.907 --> 01:23:48.170
All the things that could lead to high Medicarex costs.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.252
Those people need three shots.

01:23:50.632 --> 01:24:00.899
Ooh, and now they don't have to use, now they don't have to use so many hot, I mean, so many placebo anymore, because again, healthy people aren't taking it.

01:24:01.339 --> 01:24:07.623
And these guys are recommending that healthy people don't necessarily need to take seven shots, but these people should.

01:24:08.444 --> 01:24:09.844
Holy shit.

01:24:11.726 --> 01:24:12.486
This is crazy.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:16.069
Uh-oh, little crashy crash.

01:24:16.609 --> 01:24:17.990
Hold on a second, it'll come.

01:24:19.358 --> 01:24:20.619
My computer will catch up.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:32.725
Sometimes my PowerPoint gets upset because the people who control my computer can mess around with my show because they're really worried about it.

01:24:32.745 --> 01:24:34.026
This list, I'll just highlight a few.

01:24:34.606 --> 01:24:35.767
Obesity is on this list.

01:24:36.307 --> 01:24:37.728
Physical inactivity is on this list.

01:24:38.268 --> 01:25:00.269
mood disorders including depression if you're not doing enough exercise you are at risk for severe covid holy shit on this list and all immunocompromised conditions in other words at-risk americans can be reassured that they will be covered if you're depressed you might be oh my gosh wow this is awesome

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.321
At the same time, we want more evidence at the U.S.

01:25:03.341 --> 01:25:04.142
Food and Drug Administration.

01:25:04.162 --> 01:25:08.905
We want to know more about what these products are doing, especially as we enter the seventh, eighth, and ninth dose.

01:25:09.926 --> 01:25:14.650
All companies will be asked to conduct a randomized control trial testing their product

01:25:15.467 --> 01:25:19.669
as follows, against a saline placebo, we want to know the full safety profile of these products.

01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:31.716
In a randomized control trial targeting people between the ages of 50 and up to 60, 64, less than 65, the primary endpoint of this study will be clinical endpoints, which we'll talk about in a minute.

01:25:31.736 --> 01:25:33.137
Clinical endpoints.

01:25:33.177 --> 01:25:37.780
So they're not worried about people who drop out of the study because the transfection kills them.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:43.043
They're only worried about people getting flu or not, getting shingles or not, or getting measles or not.

01:25:43.563 --> 01:25:47.006
They are going to massively kill people now.

01:25:47.767 --> 01:25:54.813
All this stuff about how the shot is killing people and killed people in 2022-23, those were lies.

01:25:55.654 --> 01:26:01.720
Because most of that was placebo and most of that was predicted because the population pyramid had it built in.

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:06.344
Now, ladies and gentlemen, is when they're going to start killing people.

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:13.474
And these data are vital to inform an updated risk-benefit analysis, an analysis that's fit for 2025.

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:23.943
And many point to observational studies that allude to some of these endpoints, but the simple truth is the existing observational literature is at high risk of bias.

01:26:27.397 --> 01:26:35.199
and broadly uninformative, in part because the people who choose to get the booster and the people who choose not to are not really the same groups of people.

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:38.019
They're different in other ways, other than the booster.

01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:41.620
Man, it's so complicated to understand vaccines, isn't it?

01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:45.461
So here's a visual schematic of what we propose at FDA.

01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:48.941
This is the New England Journal of Medicine paper, our figure in the paper.

01:26:49.581 --> 01:26:51.962
If you're over 65, if you are less than 65,

01:26:53.266 --> 01:26:54.707
Sorry, I have to do that all the time.

01:26:54.727 --> 01:26:56.948
I have to figure out how to do that without a click.

01:26:56.988 --> 01:26:57.829
A quick way to get products to market.

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:17.974
Nothing like admitting why you took over the FDA with these clowns.

01:27:18.775 --> 01:27:20.395
Give us more evidence for 50 to 60.

01:27:20.956 --> 01:27:31.762
Does it sound like he's about to say that, you know, the one of the lessons we learned from COVID is that PCR could be used against us if we're not very careful about negative and positive controls of PCR.

01:27:33.365 --> 01:27:35.787
No, he's not gonna get anywhere close to that, of course not.

01:27:35.967 --> 01:27:40.730
If you don't like what this guy's saying, if you think he's full of shit, if you think he's a pharma shill or some other kind of shill,

01:27:54.899 --> 01:28:18.730
If you think anything is wrong with what this guy's saying, you should blame it on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jay Bhattacharya, you should blame it on Mary Holland and the fake health freedom movement, you should blame it on Aaron Seery, you should blame it on Steve Bannon, you should blame it on Robert Malone, you should blame it on Kevin McKernan, because they're all part of the same bullshit takeover.

01:28:21.656 --> 01:28:29.059
This is just a silly puppet that we're supposed to get angry about, a child they've put in front of us, but these people are responsible.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:35.261
Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan being central to the biological narrative we're trapped in.

01:28:36.122 --> 01:28:40.964
Very confident these studies will accrue and be given to us as we suggest.

01:28:42.199 --> 01:28:51.949
Finally, this is a free country, and companies are, of course, free to conduct their own randomized studies in younger populations, in people without risk factors for severe COVID-19.

01:28:52.329 --> 01:28:56.273
They can run the research agenda they see fit, and we will consider the results of those studies.

01:28:56.594 --> 01:28:58.796
And we call this sponsor-driven randomized control trials.

01:29:00.165 --> 01:29:02.266
Now, you may ask, why 50 to 65?

01:29:02.626 --> 01:29:11.288
Well, the truth is, if you look broadly across our peer nations, that is the place of global equipoise, where we are genuinely uncertain, globally, if those patients benefit.

01:29:11.928 --> 01:29:13.888
Global equipoise.

01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:18.830
Oh, you better learn a new word if you're going to keep up with Vinay Prasad, boy.

01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:21.971
This guy went to high school in La Porte, Indiana.

01:29:22.011 --> 01:29:23.311
He's sharp as a knife.

01:29:24.011 --> 01:29:28.134
Many countries recommend COVID-19 vaccines for 65 and up in high risk.

01:29:28.595 --> 01:29:30.476
Some countries go lower to 45.

01:29:30.896 --> 01:29:35.920
So 50 to 65 we feel is an area where there's disagreement among our peer nations.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.282
It's a place we can bring data to this question.

01:29:38.742 --> 01:29:40.884
We can answer the question with gold standard science.

01:29:42.557 --> 01:29:46.238
In the course of preparing these remarks, people have asked me a few questions which I hope to address here.

01:29:46.738 --> 01:29:48.198
What about very young kids?

01:29:48.798 --> 01:29:53.720
And the answer to that is, we encourage sponsors to conduct randomized control trials in that population.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:30:01.601
And to show you some reason why we think there's also equipoise here, this is cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization by- He said the word again!

01:30:02.082 --> 01:30:06.403
It's approximately 55 per 100,000 over the last season, and one to four is 20 per 100,000.

01:30:08.163 --> 01:30:10.564
If you go down to zero to four, it's 30 per 100,000.

01:30:11.164 --> 01:30:12.024
It's malevolence.

01:30:12.725 --> 01:30:18.706
You don't start using more and more vocabulary unless your goal is to confuse people.

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:23.368
That's why I use phrases with only three words in them and then explain it.

01:30:23.408 --> 01:30:27.349
You know, like evolution because DNA, and explain why that's bullshit.

01:30:27.749 --> 01:30:30.911
Or RNA can't pandemic, and then explain why it's bullshit.

01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:34.952
Or that intramuscular injection's not medicine, and explain why it's bullshit.

01:30:35.512 --> 01:30:37.272
You see, that's how it works.

01:30:37.792 --> 01:30:39.173
These people are not doing that.

01:30:39.213 --> 01:30:41.573
They're doing the exact opposite of it.

01:30:41.933 --> 01:30:54.616
And they have been for more than two decades, but during the pandemic, they had a whole crew of people put in place to make sure that they could do it effectively enough to enslave our children.

01:30:56.996 --> 01:30:57.936
Compared to 55 per 100,000.

01:30:57.996 --> 01:31:00.977
And this is much different than say, for instance, 65 to 70.

01:31:03.047 --> 01:31:05.188
I had to click to let that comment, sorry.

01:31:05.208 --> 01:31:09.429
Where it's 150 per 100,000, a much higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization.

01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:15.811
And final point I want to make is that these numbers include children who have risk factors for severe COVID-19.

01:31:16.252 --> 01:31:20.233
So the number, these actual numbers in healthy children are likely lower.

01:31:20.473 --> 01:31:23.054
Is this the worst set of slides you've ever seen?

01:31:23.374 --> 01:31:26.475
We at FDA believe there is equipoise for 50 to 64 year olds.

01:31:26.755 --> 01:31:31.737
Ergo, there must be equipoise for younger ages and we encourage companies if they see fit to conduct such things.

01:31:33.226 --> 01:31:34.207
And what is he doing here?

01:31:34.247 --> 01:31:34.907
Let me be very clear.

01:31:34.927 --> 01:31:37.248
He is reinforcing the idea that all of these diagnostics work.

01:31:57.383 --> 01:32:05.545
that PCR can be used to decide whether you've had it in the last three months or not, that seroprevalence can tell you whether you've had it in the last three months or not.

01:32:06.165 --> 01:32:22.729
And he's in no way questioning this entire suite of products that the FDA should regulate for safe and effective claims, should regulate as medical devices, but he's not.

01:32:24.008 --> 01:32:29.549
He's exclusively focused on the COVID shots being bad, or kinda bad, or maybe they're bad for some people.

01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:34.371
And he was put in place to do this.

01:32:44.278 --> 01:32:58.824
This is a technical point, but we want the 95% confidence interval lower bound to be above 30%, which is a statistical way of saying we want to have some confidence that these vaccines change the rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in a meaningful way, in a meaningful amount.

01:32:59.485 --> 01:33:06.668
Don't forget that at the beginning of 2020 or the end of 2020, a couple of weeks after Brandy Vaughn was killed,

01:33:07.878 --> 01:33:14.420
Brian Hooker was on a stream talking about asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

01:33:17.261 --> 01:33:20.382
It's one malevolent show.

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:25.044
Fake, anti-vax, health freedom movement in America.

01:33:25.624 --> 01:33:26.684
And I need some help.

01:33:27.384 --> 01:33:35.647
Because America is really being undermined from the inside and it seems like the Democrats are as in on it as the Republicans because nobody cares.

01:33:39.341 --> 01:33:43.444
Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was the primary endpoint of the original randomized studies in 2020.

01:33:44.144 --> 01:33:53.670
We continue to believe that's a fit primary endpoint, but we're also going to look at severe disease, hospitalization, and death, which are endpoints I think Americans and their physicians care a lot about.

01:33:54.850 --> 01:34:08.639
We want the companies to follow these people for at least six months, because we want to make sure that if the booster has a reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2, that that effect isn't washed away five months or six months later, that those benefits persist.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.831
And finally, we must develop randomized evidence.

01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:13.151
We owe it to the American people.

01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:19.714
We have launched down this multi-year campaign of booster after booster after booster and distrust of the American public.

01:34:20.034 --> 01:34:25.196
And we do not have gold standard science to support this for average risk, low risk Americans.

01:34:26.696 --> 01:34:32.758
It's not just our view here in the current FDA commissioner and myself, it's the prior FDA commissioner as well.

01:34:32.798 --> 01:34:33.939
This is Rob Califf.

01:34:34.019 --> 01:34:39.441
This could be taking place at a rented storage facility with that backdrop.

01:34:41.232 --> 01:34:42.592
I see nothing official here.

01:34:42.632 --> 01:34:44.053
This is terrifying to me.

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:48.114
Is there anybody working in DC right now?

01:34:48.174 --> 01:34:50.114
Are those buildings just empty already?

01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:55.696
Can anybody from Washington DC tell me if anything real is happening in America?

01:34:55.716 --> 01:34:58.636
Are we just assuming that while we watch social media?

01:34:58.676 --> 01:35:05.978
He writes, COVID vaccine uptake is now low enough that large randomized control trials are feasible to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new updated boosters.

01:35:06.298 --> 01:35:08.399
And again, he reinstated it again.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:21.999
on May 9th, quote, in the case of COVID-19, I believe it would now be quite reasonable and even advisable to conduct placebo control trials for quote unquote boosters using updated versions of the vaccine in people who are not high risk.

01:35:23.493 --> 01:35:24.593
Just a couple more points.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:31.055
What about vaccinating healthy people near or around an immunocompromised person, including healthcare workers?

01:35:31.135 --> 01:35:34.276
If he was born in Cleveland, why in the hell didn't he say it?

01:35:34.316 --> 01:35:37.477
Why did he start with he went to high school in La Porte, Indiana?

01:35:37.557 --> 01:35:39.778
I think that's Times of India is a lie.

01:35:40.618 --> 01:35:41.358
That's what I think.

01:35:42.718 --> 01:35:46.479
If that article says that he was born in Cleveland, I bet it's a lie.

01:35:49.465 --> 01:35:56.649
Well, to date, there is no high quality evidence that in this year, vaccinating those near an immunocompromised... I'm sorry, but he would have said it.

01:35:57.449 --> 01:36:03.272
If he was born in Cleveland, he would have said it right now instead of saying he went to high school in LaPorte, Illinois.

01:36:04.052 --> 01:36:04.993
LaPorte, Indiana.

01:36:05.053 --> 01:36:05.893
It's just a joke.

01:36:06.434 --> 01:36:08.535
My dad used to teach in LaPorte, Indiana.

01:36:08.575 --> 01:36:10.656
We used to live in Michigan Cindy, Indiana.

01:36:10.696 --> 01:36:12.877
So right here, that's a lie.

01:36:14.372 --> 01:36:15.412
Not you, but him.

01:36:15.732 --> 01:36:20.134
Provides an additional benefit for the immunocompromised person over seeking vaccines themselves.

01:36:21.114 --> 01:36:25.676
Is it the case that it leads to less transmission to vaccinate people around an immunocompromised person?

01:36:26.196 --> 01:36:28.356
Is it the case that it leads to less severe disease?

01:36:28.596 --> 01:36:34.298
They want to test the transmission, to track the transmission, and how would they do that?

01:36:34.338 --> 01:36:36.419
They would use the diagnostic of PCR.

01:36:38.513 --> 01:36:41.195
Verify exposure by lateral flow testing.

01:36:41.215 --> 01:36:44.277
They are not gonna question any of these medical devices ever.

01:36:44.337 --> 01:36:49.641
The foundation of the myth will never be questioned by anybody on this narrative team.

01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:51.343
That's how you can see it.

01:36:51.423 --> 01:36:59.709
Very specifically, you can talk about VAERS all you want, about transfection all you want, about DNA contamination or pseudo-uridine or M-methyl pseudo-uridine.

01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:03.692
It doesn't matter as long as you leave PCR alone.

01:37:04.332 --> 01:37:13.939
and lateral flow testing alone, then these diagnostics will go on forever in our corporate hospitals and we will slowly be inverted into experimental animals.

01:37:13.999 --> 01:37:14.820
It's already there.

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.482
The database, like Epic, it's already there.

01:37:17.802 --> 01:37:21.805
The remnant stream producing the DNA sampling they need is already there.

01:37:21.845 --> 01:37:26.769
They already instituted it at all of the universities and they already got all that data.

01:37:29.133 --> 01:37:30.354
in immunocompromised people.

01:37:30.994 --> 01:37:36.037
The FDA is very interested in sponsors choosing to conduct such studies to show if it does.

01:37:36.797 --> 01:37:45.823
And I do want to point out that the current RSV approvals, respiratory syncytial virus, do not allow the approvals to be given to people around the vulnerable.

01:37:45.963 --> 01:37:48.124
Instead, it targets those vulnerable to the condition.

01:37:48.704 --> 01:37:50.965
So we are bringing COVID-19 policy in line with RSV.

01:37:52.086 --> 01:38:05.550
It is possible, actually, that such approvals and strategies provide false reassurance and lead to increased harms because people boosted are actually engaging in other compensatory behaviors that increase the risk for the immunocompromised individual.

01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:08.731
The truth is data alone can answer this question.

01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.831
And I say the same thing for older people.

01:38:11.871 --> 01:38:14.073
What about you getting a booster to go visit grandma?

01:38:14.373 --> 01:38:21.538
Well, to date, there is no high quality evidence that you getting a booster to visit your grandma protects your grandma beyond your grandma getting the booster herself.

01:38:22.039 --> 01:38:23.319
Does it lead to less transmission?

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.221
Does it lead to fewer instances of severe disease?

01:38:25.541 --> 01:38:28.023
Again, we are interested in evidence to inform this claim.

01:38:28.543 --> 01:38:37.770
And again, the RSV approvals recommended for older people or those at higher risk of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization, but not for everyone who goes to visit them.

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:39.711
Ultimately, data are needed.

01:38:41.013 --> 01:38:45.637
A final point I've heard people say, what's the role of the FDA and what's the role of the CDC here?

01:38:45.838 --> 01:38:48.160
You want me to help him out?

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.001
I could help him out.

01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:52.124
I'll add a little low end so that he doesn't sound so annoying.

01:38:52.384 --> 01:38:57.009
For disease control may issue recommendations on who should receive the FDA approved vaccines.

01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:58.150
You know, the funny thing is.

01:38:59.341 --> 01:39:04.249
When you try to add low end to somebody who doesn't have any low end, you can't add anything.

01:39:04.389 --> 01:39:11.320
If you push the equalizer up and there's nothing to boost, it didn't do anything.

01:39:12.085 --> 01:39:30.518
But the FDA can only approve products if it concludes, based on the available scientific evidence, the benefit-to-harm balance is favorable, and we simply need more data to have that... The benefit-to-harm balance is the foundation of their bullshit informed consent.

01:39:31.454 --> 01:39:49.240
Their bullshit model of informed consent, which is actually confounded consent, is that you understand the risk-benefit ratio as measured by a probabilistic study, or a simulation, or a combination of studies, or maybe even a meta-study about simulations about that.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:56.472
That's the extent to which Bret Weinstein and this jackass and all the other ones would say informed consent is.

01:39:57.053 --> 01:39:59.998
And the other big deal is we should at least be able to say whatever we want.

01:40:00.038 --> 01:40:01.962
Free speech, you know, choice and stuff.

01:40:03.757 --> 01:40:24.532
Informed consent means understanding what the risks are, and that would require explaining explicitly what transfection is, how little we understand about expressing proteins in healthy humans, and its potential long-term consequences depending on where those proteins express.

01:40:26.913 --> 01:40:31.577
And none of these people in five years have been able to get to the point where they can say that.

01:40:32.978 --> 01:40:33.438
None of them.

01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:35.632
None of them.

01:40:35.832 --> 01:40:39.533
I'm the only person, the only biologist on earth that's able to say it like that.

01:40:39.673 --> 01:40:41.774
Not even Mike Yeadon has said it like that.

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.955
Not even, none of them, none.

01:40:45.376 --> 01:40:46.577
And that is by design.

01:40:46.757 --> 01:40:55.101
That's also why they must ignore me, because I can say it in under two minutes, under a 30 seconds sometimes, depending on what I need to say.

01:40:57.362 --> 01:41:03.805
The truth will get out, ladies and gentlemen, because the more you listen to me and the more you share me, the more you're going to be able to say it yourself too.

01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:06.413
the more your kids will understand it.

01:41:08.214 --> 01:41:14.295
We can finally start repairing the fractured social fabric of our fragile nation.

01:41:14.815 --> 01:41:18.115
Confidence for younger individuals at low risk of severe disease.

01:41:19.216 --> 01:41:20.956
We have to do our duty here too at the FDA.

01:41:21.556 --> 01:41:32.618
The FDA is committed, and let me say this very clearly, we are committed to ensuring companies generate that evidence, and we strongly suggest they complete any agreed upon post-marketing studies.

01:41:33.783 --> 01:41:39.586
Finally, I encourage you all to- We strongly suggest that they complete the studies that they said they would complete.

01:41:40.206 --> 01:41:44.168
What in the shit hell was that language other than pathetic?

01:41:45.088 --> 01:41:45.689
Wow.

01:41:45.889 --> 01:41:47.189
Should I play that part again?

01:41:47.269 --> 01:41:50.031
That was pretty fricking remarkable.

01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:50.851
That was crazy.

01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:59.355
To read our paper in New England Journal of Medicine, which fleshes out this rationale, it's we need more data to have that confidence for younger individuals at low risk of severe disease.

01:42:00.489 --> 01:42:02.211
We have to do our duty here, too, at the FDA.

01:42:02.811 --> 01:42:13.881
The FDA is committed, and let me say this very clearly, we are committed to ensuring companies generate that evidence, and we strongly suggest they complete any agreed-upon post-marketing studies.

01:42:16.524 --> 01:42:17.685
Bring up the commish!

01:42:37.638 --> 01:42:42.540
I'm going direct to the American people to explain the thinking behind our decisions, which too often is opaque.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.562
So if you allow me to introduce the Commissioner, Dr. Martin McCary, to come up here.

01:42:52.803 --> 01:42:53.163
Thank you.

01:42:53.383 --> 01:42:54.703
Why did they have to switch that?

01:42:55.003 --> 01:42:55.203
What?

01:42:55.384 --> 01:42:55.604
Great.

01:42:55.644 --> 01:42:56.564
Well, thank you so much.

01:42:56.624 --> 01:42:57.744
It's great to be here.

01:42:57.764 --> 01:42:58.745
It's great to see everybody.

01:42:59.425 --> 01:43:01.885
And I hope to meet every single one of you.

01:43:01.945 --> 01:43:03.446
But right now,

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:08.740
There's probably like four people in the room, including the person that's running the cameras.

01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:13.203
Let's talk a little bit about your talk, Dr. Prasad.

01:43:13.243 --> 01:43:15.684
So very interesting observations.

01:43:15.764 --> 01:43:20.106
I think you nicely acknowledged that this is a very polarizing topic.

01:43:20.587 --> 01:43:29.872
And it's in general, the entire concept of COVID risk mitigation has been loaded with a lot of medical dogma.

01:43:29.972 --> 01:43:33.414
I think about the time when everybody was encouraged to wear

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:42.385
any cloth mask, giving them false assurance and perhaps increasing a risk because the moral hazard that they felt that they were safe.

01:43:43.386 --> 01:43:46.250
I think he's an Egyptian foreign national, but I could be wrong.

01:43:47.699 --> 01:43:48.759
So I appreciate your talk.

01:43:49.100 --> 01:44:02.625
One question that a family member asked me today when I was talking about what was forthcoming in the New England Journal is, is the FDA in your mind with this framework?

01:44:02.965 --> 01:44:05.666
I think that's Vinay breathing after that.

01:44:05.946 --> 01:44:11.048
He's trying to cool off because he's so nervous because he knows that he's a complete fraud.

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:18.157
that you've outlined, is the FDA gonna require a randomized trial every year for each COVID annual booster?

01:44:18.177 --> 01:44:19.739
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:44:20.159 --> 01:44:25.687
So I think one thing worth- It's a great question that he is the head of the department that would decide that.

01:44:26.735 --> 01:44:29.536
Are they gonna have to do a randomized trial for every one of these?

01:44:30.356 --> 01:44:38.178
But notice that they are not asking if they have to do a randomized trial for any of the PCR diagnostics that are currently on the market.

01:44:38.678 --> 01:44:48.980
They don't have to do a randomized trial to see if the PCR tests actually showed anything or not because these assholes are traders that were put in place to make sure that never happens.

01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.842
Yes, I'm angry about it.

01:44:50.922 --> 01:45:02.755
Yes, I'm yelling at you, but only because I want you to get off your chair and share this video, post it everywhere and go and ruin social media by how much you post this video everywhere you can.

01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:06.203
discussing is, as you alluded to, the dogma.

01:45:06.643 --> 01:45:13.387
There were so many things that happened in the last five years that I think have bred a broader distrust in the American people from the scientific community.

01:45:14.187 --> 01:45:20.671
Well, one thing we're just taking for granted is the idea that COVID-19 vaccines will be changed every single year.

01:45:21.331 --> 01:45:27.515
And what we've seen over the course of the last 18 months or two years is that the COVID-19 virus is different than influenza.

01:45:28.075 --> 01:45:43.123
Are you gonna, if he next says to you that the sequence of the virus hasn't changed as much as flu changes, will you believe me that he's on a script provided by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan?

01:45:43.823 --> 01:45:50.667
Because Kevin McKernan believes that the sequencing is very, very real and that the sequencing shows an evolution.

01:45:51.997 --> 01:45:55.338
And now this guy's going to tell you that the evolution has slowed down a little bit.

01:45:55.378 --> 01:45:59.260
The endemic signal of coronavirus has slowed down.

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:01.461
It's still the same J1 variant.

01:46:01.541 --> 01:46:02.922
It's mutating at a slower rate.

01:46:03.262 --> 01:46:05.142
And we're actually still in J1 lineage.

01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:13.586
And in fact, the WHO, just a week or two ago, advised that J1 COVID-19 vaccine boosters are still appropriate in the current

01:46:13.906 --> 01:46:24.422
So the WHO is actually quite relevant even though we supposedly left the WHO and and the Health and Human Services Secretary just explained why yesterday.

01:46:28.018 --> 01:46:31.340
Gee, it's unfortunate that these guys are so amateur.

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:42.188
I really, really wonder if it's already, they're already selling off the furniture in these buildings and that these people have already gone looking for new jobs because this is scary.

01:46:42.548 --> 01:46:42.828
Time.

01:46:43.488 --> 01:46:44.169
So what's my point?

01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:52.274
My point is that instead of having a COVID-19 strategy that's year to year, where we change every single year, why don't we let the science tell us when we should change?

01:46:52.514 --> 01:46:53.695
When there's a major antigen.

01:46:53.895 --> 01:46:57.097
When somebody is talking with their hands like this,

01:46:58.038 --> 01:47:01.480
and it doesn't feel right, it's because they're faking it.

01:47:03.701 --> 01:47:07.223
It never feels wrong when I'm doing it because I'm not faking it.

01:47:07.343 --> 01:47:08.964
This asshole is faking it.

01:47:10.731 --> 01:47:11.872
You want me to call him traitor?

01:47:11.912 --> 01:47:14.014
Would it be better to call him traitor instead of asshole?

01:47:14.134 --> 01:47:14.795
I apologize.

01:47:14.855 --> 01:47:16.416
This traitor.

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:20.400
When the virus really changes, then perhaps we should change our strategy.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:31.769
So I don't envision randomized trials every year, but I do think we have an obligation every few years or however long that may be to generate credible evidence for the American people to clarify that we know where we stand.

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.270
I see.

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:36.774
So you're saying you don't envision a schedule by which randomized trials might

01:47:37.274 --> 01:47:38.075
Very close.

01:47:38.176 --> 01:47:40.979
That guy, DOTUS, is very close to my view.

01:47:41.159 --> 01:47:45.685
They are inverting our sovereignty so that they can experiment on us as they will.

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:53.895
It has been a longtime goal of the Human Genome Project to get everybody's medical records electronic and then to use computer

01:47:54.736 --> 01:48:10.098
computers to sort of see if the electronic medical records, that data, signals can be found in it that will correlate with some signal in the human genome that will allow them to make progress on this irreducibly complex problem.

01:48:10.198 --> 01:48:10.539
You're right.

01:48:10.879 --> 01:48:17.224
We require you envision a sort of adapt as we go based on the degree of antigenic shift.

01:48:17.304 --> 01:48:20.827
If it's escaped antibody immunity and people are wondering.

01:48:21.028 --> 01:48:23.610
So he's an expert in antigenic shift now.

01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:28.534
This guy who is regularly podcasting with the jackass named ZDogg.

01:48:30.808 --> 01:48:32.831
is now an expert in antigenic shift.

01:48:33.071 --> 01:48:41.143
I think the only way he could become an expert in antigenic shift to this level would be tutoring from Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:48:42.453 --> 01:48:43.975
Maybe that's a reasonable time.

01:48:44.275 --> 01:48:45.576
The virus doesn't have a calendar.

01:48:45.716 --> 01:48:52.002
I know during the pandemic we had closures at a certain time of day, but the virus doesn't know the time of day and it doesn't have a calendar.

01:48:52.022 --> 01:48:55.165
So I think we should react to when the virus tells us to react, as you point out.

01:48:55.506 --> 01:48:55.966
Okay, great.

01:48:56.467 --> 01:49:04.274
What is, you know, there's a belief... It wouldn't surprise me if there are people with cue cards standing to the left and the right of these two jacks.

01:49:04.474 --> 01:49:05.315
It's just crazy.

01:49:05.948 --> 01:49:15.053
in the scientific community that it is the B and T cell activation that is really driving the longer... The B and T cell activation.

01:49:15.113 --> 01:49:24.919
Are we really going to go back to 2020 when Mike Eden was taken off of his own dissident script and given a script by Kevin McKernan?

01:49:25.885 --> 01:49:32.238
the end of 2020 when they all put out that big paper about, you know, the, the, the Drorsten protocol wasn't fair.

01:49:32.318 --> 01:49:36.307
They only got 24 hours of review and their primers caused dimers.

01:49:38.308 --> 01:49:59.038
Are we really going to go back there now and, you know, no one's going to, they still don't know any immunology if they just say B and T cells and don't talk about it as a sequence that's limited or, you know, how the antigen presentation might work or any of this stuff, just B and T cells is enough to say, which is curious because that's the same bullshit that Brian Hooker said in that 2020

01:50:00.299 --> 01:50:05.281
stream, you know, two weeks after Brandy died, where he was doing a callback with Dr. Kendra.

01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:07.903
Hey, don't they have antibodies?

01:50:08.003 --> 01:50:10.264
Isn't it really about T-cells, Brian?

01:50:10.304 --> 01:50:13.145
And Brian's like, yeah, Kendra, it is about T-cells.

01:50:13.425 --> 01:50:14.186
Well, here we go.

01:50:14.246 --> 01:50:16.627
These two jackasses are going to do the same shtick.

01:50:17.087 --> 01:50:20.729
Their term, protection against severe illness.

01:50:21.509 --> 01:50:28.113
And in that case, in that school of thought, they, people actually have suggested that

01:50:29.193 --> 01:50:41.498
customizing it to the strain each year may result in a transient antibody increase, but ultimately that protection against severe illness is based on that B and T cell activation.

01:50:42.099 --> 01:50:43.559
And if that is the case.

01:50:43.579 --> 01:50:47.421
His nasal breathing is aimed directly at his mic.

01:50:47.601 --> 01:50:51.303
I don't know how or why, but apparently his nose shoots straight down.

01:50:51.503 --> 01:50:53.303
And we know to some degree it's the case.

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:56.305
But if that is largely the case,

01:50:57.389 --> 01:51:08.534
then what is the right number of COVID shots that really optimizes or maximizes that B and T cycle?

01:51:14.922 --> 01:51:19.983
What optimal number of COVID shots optimizes that B and T cell response?

01:51:20.003 --> 01:51:21.804
Well, that's a great question, Marty.

01:51:21.844 --> 01:51:23.084
That's a great question.

01:51:23.124 --> 01:51:24.105
What's the role of T cells?

01:51:24.205 --> 01:51:34.907
I mean, the ultimate question is the way in science we approach this question of how many shots a, say, thin seven-year-old girl should get is we conduct studies that give us the answer to that question.

01:51:35.328 --> 01:51:40.169
I don't think we're in a situation where we can reason that from first immunologic principles.

01:51:40.569 --> 01:51:42.290
In the history of medicine, that's led us astray.

01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:43.811
And so what- Okay, that's enough.

01:51:44.171 --> 01:51:44.551
We're done.

01:51:45.452 --> 01:51:47.473
It's been a long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:47.513 --> 01:51:48.373
I don't know what to tell you.

01:51:48.953 --> 01:51:52.275
But the only thing they have left is your active engagement in social media.

01:51:52.315 --> 01:52:04.701
This illusion is almost exclusively sustained on Substack and X. So if you leave those two platforms or you spend your time on them ruining them, you will succeed in escaping.

01:52:04.781 --> 01:52:09.204
Right now, all their chips are in X and Substack, all their chips.

01:52:10.194 --> 01:52:16.902
And they are playing a game where this podcasting crew that auditioned for five years is now at the head of the FDA.

01:52:16.942 --> 01:52:21.748
And that is a sign that America is in big, big, big trouble.

01:52:21.788 --> 01:52:26.794
Because the FDA should be the one that gets us out of this by ending the PREP Act.

01:52:27.822 --> 01:52:43.187
declaration of an emergency and asserting their authority to regulate these PCR and lateral flow tests and sequencing reactions as medical devices, which they will never do as long as these foreign traders are in their positions.

01:52:43.948 --> 01:52:47.569
That's why it's so important to understand that this is not a joke.

01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:48.609
This is not funny.

01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:53.591
This is terrifying because at the head of the CDC is an AI expert.

01:52:55.771 --> 01:52:56.972
Murder and lies for what?

01:52:57.132 --> 01:52:58.132
I can tell you for what.

01:52:58.232 --> 01:53:01.033
For the Human Genome Project, ladies and gentlemen, you can see it.

01:53:01.093 --> 01:53:04.375
Look at this track record of traders.

01:53:04.595 --> 01:53:05.716
Look at these people.

01:53:05.776 --> 01:53:06.936
They were performing.

01:53:08.257 --> 01:53:10.758
They were performing with a script that they were given.

01:53:11.633 --> 01:53:15.575
They were auditioning for roles in the Trump administration.

01:53:15.635 --> 01:53:17.115
They knew that this was coming.

01:53:17.175 --> 01:53:18.196
That's why they did it.

01:53:18.256 --> 01:53:20.317
It's not for saving the world.

01:53:20.377 --> 01:53:23.078
These guys are not saving the world in these videos.

01:53:23.158 --> 01:53:26.619
They are auditioning for the roles that they have now.

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:31.101
And it might've been hard to see at the time, but it ain't hard to see now.

01:53:31.681 --> 01:53:34.222
It's not hard to see now.

01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:42.694
And so you have no excuse for not pulling your head out except that you like social media and you're comfortable on it.

01:53:42.894 --> 01:53:45.395
And your trust that most of the videos are real.

01:53:46.216 --> 01:53:51.559
Hey, what's up Z-Pac, it's Dr. Z. That blew my ears out, I'm so sorry.

01:53:52.819 --> 01:53:54.420
And I showed you how awful it is.

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:57.642
I've shown you that, sorry about that, that blew your ears out too.

01:53:58.843 --> 01:54:01.344
That this, you have to understand the trap.

01:54:02.325 --> 01:54:05.467
You need to understand the trap that they put us in and how they put us in it.

01:54:06.226 --> 01:54:09.849
They put a bunch of liars on social media and they stuck to it.

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:12.631
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:21.177
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:54:21.317 --> 01:54:33.426
As long as a certain percentage of these people agree not to question that part of the narrative and never question PCR or the sequence of the virus, this illusion can be sustained with a lot of these people not understanding it.

01:54:34.423 --> 01:54:39.466
And that's what's dangerous about gigaohm biological because we can explain it to anyone that wants to hear it.

01:54:40.046 --> 01:54:45.370
And we would always start with explaining that Brian Hooker didn't always say autism.

01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:52.574
Brian Hooker needed to say autism and say it well in the right way before the pandemic could be pulled off.

01:54:52.714 --> 01:54:55.476
Otherwise, there might be a group of people that could lead

01:54:56.116 --> 01:55:04.524
a dissident movement that would start to question intermuscular injection in general and this whole multi-generational plan would come to a screeching halt.

01:55:05.505 --> 01:55:11.711
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

01:55:12.072 --> 01:55:13.493
He was neurologically damaged.

01:55:14.394 --> 01:55:20.440
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.142
I was meddled with by lots of different groups.

01:55:23.302 --> 01:55:32.630
One of the groups was a signal chat with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and Matt Crawford and Alexandros Marinos.

01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:37.954
And in that signal chat in 2021, I explained how the fraud was happening.

01:55:38.644 --> 01:55:39.084
actually J.J.

01:55:39.164 --> 01:55:45.667
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:55:45.847 --> 01:55:52.490
I also explained to them how disingenuous it was to call any of these things a vaccine when they are proven not to be.

01:55:52.530 --> 01:56:05.215
They are a known technology on the academic bench, and instead of promoting me or promoting this idea, they silently acknowledged that it was the right word.

01:56:05.415 --> 01:56:06.016
One time,

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:17.515
One time, off script, you have Heather Haying saying, insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:56:17.635 --> 01:56:19.615
And then ever after that, she never said it again.

01:56:21.056 --> 01:56:34.518
And he tweeted it one time, but you know, that was in 2024, when the damage was already done, when the murder had already been committed, and they were already into the whole, you know, population pyramid thing, everything could be faked.

01:56:35.512 --> 01:56:37.093
Denny Rancor was in place.

01:56:37.193 --> 01:56:39.155
Kevin McKernan had established himself.

01:56:39.595 --> 01:56:50.463
Robert Malone was firmly seated behind the control panel of CHD with Meryl Nass starting her own non-profit called Door to Freedom, which gets everybody to focus on the who.

01:56:50.523 --> 01:56:55.227
This show has been going on for five years, and now you have a senator.

01:56:55.247 --> 01:56:56.768
It's the individuals in the world today.

01:56:57.008 --> 01:56:59.170
There's the largest group, by far the largest,

01:56:59.810 --> 01:57:01.171
that just want to forget COVID.

01:57:01.211 --> 01:57:07.234
They just want to move on, whether they're either harmed or whether they cause harm.

01:57:08.034 --> 01:57:10.095
If they cause harm, they just want to be forgiven.

01:57:10.635 --> 01:57:13.016
Boy, tough to make those decisions back then.

01:57:14.437 --> 01:57:15.397
What harm was it?

01:57:15.457 --> 01:57:17.078
Was it supplementary oxygen?

01:57:17.118 --> 01:57:20.780
Was it the use of ventilators when it wasn't necessary or to stop spread?

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.782
Was it the lack of antibiotic use because viral pneumonias don't need antibiotics?

01:57:25.822 --> 01:57:26.943
Was it the lack of viral

01:57:27.723 --> 01:57:30.944
antibiotic use on urinary tract infections?

01:57:31.004 --> 01:57:32.705
Was it the use of remdesivir?

01:57:33.485 --> 01:57:37.786
What exactly was it that killed people, Mr. Senator Ron Johnson?

01:57:38.907 --> 01:57:42.068
Of course he can't say it because he's part of this narrative.

01:57:42.488 --> 01:57:55.352
That's why that senator, this senator from Wisconsin is the one who called me, the one who never asked me to speak in front of any of his Senate committees, but a group of people coached on the narrative of Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.431
want to forget all this.

01:57:59.191 --> 01:58:05.614
Then there's a group, I would say you're in that group, I'm in that group, our eyes were opened during COVID.

01:58:06.375 --> 01:58:07.896
Eyes were opened to what?

01:58:07.976 --> 01:58:18.401
Because my eyes were opened to the idea that the Human Genome Project might be a very good national security priority reason to lie to people about the ability of RNA to pandemic.

01:58:19.281 --> 01:58:41.068
to lie to people about the role of bacteria in their lives, and to lie to people about the role of their immune system in interacting with that bacteria, to lie to people about an infinitesimal background of genetic signals produced largely by bacteria, but instead to tell people a story that's really just a lie.

01:58:43.063 --> 01:58:47.425
Of course, the third group are the COVID cartel, the people that imposed all this on us.

01:58:47.465 --> 01:58:48.886
And again, they have the power.

01:58:48.906 --> 01:58:50.026
They've controlled the narrative.

01:58:50.546 --> 01:58:54.128
They call the truth misinformation, disinformation and malinformation.

01:58:54.908 --> 01:58:57.510
So that's what we've got going on right now.

01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:59.491
Who is the COVID cartel?

01:58:59.651 --> 01:59:00.711
Who are the bad guys?

01:59:02.392 --> 01:59:06.434
It is a national security state that has for decades prioritized

01:59:07.352 --> 01:59:16.902
the Human Genome Project, which requires the collection of medical and genetic data from as many human beings on earth as possible.

01:59:16.922 --> 01:59:18.664
That's a pretty big goal.

01:59:23.786 --> 01:59:42.117
And the way that they laid this narrative down was to use a pre-existing phenomenon and put people in place that would be able to control the narrative about that pre-existing phenomenon and turn it into a way to fundamentally take over the world with social media.

01:59:42.757 --> 01:59:47.520
Essentially, they've done that if every government in the world is at the behest of social media narratives.

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.520
Essentially, they've done that.

01:59:49.681 --> 01:59:56.643
If X can ruin politics in Germany or ruin politics in America, then pretty much they have them bent over.

01:59:57.483 --> 02:00:00.925
Because it's not TV and newspapers anymore, it's social media.

02:00:01.025 --> 02:00:05.066
And the more we acquiesce to its use, the more control they will have over us.

02:00:06.487 --> 02:00:14.610
And that's exactly what all these organizations are and why all these organizations have very, very, very accurately avoided this discussion.

02:00:17.722 --> 02:00:21.043
because it's the way out, ladies and gentlemen.

02:00:21.264 --> 02:00:26.166
The way out is getting off of social media or using it in a way that subverts them.

02:00:26.186 --> 02:00:30.688
And so if you know a way of using social media against them, let me know, send me an email.

02:00:30.728 --> 02:00:31.628
I'll try to do it too.

02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:35.810
The big, big idea here is evolution because DNA is bullshit.

02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:40.912
And if we can break that model of biology, we can teach our kids a new way out.

02:00:41.612 --> 02:00:42.872
And that's what my goal is.

02:00:42.973 --> 02:00:48.014
You know, endemicity is one of these things they lied about in order to create this illusion.

02:00:48.914 --> 02:00:54.076
And Vinay and Marty are not going to question the idea of endemicity.

02:00:54.216 --> 02:01:05.719
If you want to question the idea of endemicity, you've got to imagine a background, an infinitesimally irreducible background of genetic signals produced by bacteria on which we all depend.

02:01:07.315 --> 02:01:17.602
The layers of life and emergent properties in life are not codified in a molecular evolutionarily dependent model of life.

02:01:17.702 --> 02:01:18.303
It's silly.

02:01:19.063 --> 02:01:21.025
That's why we need a new model of biology.

02:01:21.065 --> 02:01:23.166
That's what I'm going to do in my second book.

02:01:23.766 --> 02:01:26.208
In my first book, it's just going to be this stuff.

02:01:26.849 --> 02:01:31.312
Very simply for kids to understand that nonspecific PCR tests could

02:01:32.233 --> 02:01:36.700
take an irreducibly complex background and make something special out of it, and it was a lie.

02:01:37.381 --> 02:01:45.114
And placebos could be used to make something appear to be safe, and now that we've accepted it, they're just gonna release it on those vulnerable populations.

02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:53.272
Don't forget if you use their test to find their ghosts, that doesn't make their ghosts real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

02:01:53.312 --> 02:01:55.032
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

02:01:55.072 --> 02:01:56.853
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:01:57.473 --> 02:02:04.175
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime and the population pyramid is an active problem they're managing, even in China.

02:02:04.595 --> 02:02:05.395
Thanks for being here.

02:02:05.415 --> 02:02:06.676
I will see you again tomorrow.
