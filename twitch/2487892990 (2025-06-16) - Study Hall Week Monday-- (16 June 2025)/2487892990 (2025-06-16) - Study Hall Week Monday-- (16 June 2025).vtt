WEBVTT

00:52.881 --> 00:52.921
Mm.

01:43.308 --> 01:43.409
do

02:30.725 --> 02:30.887
you

05:21.460 --> 05:21.881
do do

06:26.676 --> 06:27.996
Good evening, everybody.

06:28.076 --> 06:29.017
Welcome to the show.

06:29.077 --> 06:30.757
This is Giga Home Biological.

06:30.777 --> 06:35.558
A high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by... Hold on one second.

06:36.419 --> 06:37.259
We're okay here.

06:37.279 --> 06:38.359
You don't have to do anything.

06:38.379 --> 06:39.600
I got everything under control.

06:39.620 --> 06:43.401
I'm just going to broadcast for a little while and then I'll put everything back on cruise.

06:43.441 --> 06:43.821
Don't worry.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.531
So tonight we're gonna we're gonna have a little bit of a special quick show.

06:49.991 --> 06:52.772
So Catherine, if you're still here, good that you're here.

06:52.812 --> 06:53.752
It's just a quick show.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.713
I had a really busy morning.

06:56.713 --> 07:01.154
And because the kids are off of school now, I need to pivot to a little bit of a different schedule.

07:01.174 --> 07:03.495
And that means getting to bed a little bit earlier.

07:03.515 --> 07:06.876
It means getting up a little bit earlier.

07:07.759 --> 07:12.621
and it means getting here closer to 1010 than I've ever done in the past or ever before.

07:12.762 --> 07:15.803
So hopefully that'll start tomorrow.

07:15.843 --> 07:21.826
But this morning we had other appointments and so we couldn't, I couldn't do it in the morning even if I was ready.

07:22.866 --> 07:25.788
I could have watched this for example, or the long version of it.

07:26.388 --> 07:28.889
So I'm just gonna watch a shorter version of it.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.650
I just wanna make one point with it.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.472
I think there's probably 10 hours of gold here.

07:35.232 --> 07:36.693
out of this two-hour interview.

07:36.713 --> 07:41.135
It's two of the softest pseudo-men on earth.

07:42.236 --> 07:55.602
This show that I'm going to show you right now is a little clip from Brett Weinstein's recent podcast with that dude from The Coast Guy or something like that.

07:56.622 --> 07:57.563
And it is brutal.

07:58.663 --> 07:59.964
You can expect it to be brutal.

08:01.054 --> 08:06.996
But there's a couple things in there that I found from the very beginning that I wanted to at least show you.

08:07.016 --> 08:09.456
I don't know if I'm gonna waste my time watching the whole thing.

08:10.516 --> 08:25.960
I think Brett Weinstein at this point is obviously part of this weird little scripted group of people that's ultimately pretending to be or actually behind this Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.881
Health Freedom Movement fakery.

08:31.511 --> 08:42.502
Like the biology of endemicity, Brett Weinstein seems to have been put in place to find out what I know and obfuscate as much of it as possible.

08:43.583 --> 08:52.971
It's not clear whether he understands what I'm talking about and is actively involved in his obfuscation or whether he just kind of reported back

08:54.152 --> 09:02.494
Piper and him to a third or fourth person like Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone, and then they scripted these people in return.

09:03.594 --> 09:12.416
But it does seem to be that there are certain biological ideas that they're just not able to touch because it would make everything go poof.

09:13.096 --> 09:14.557
One of those is endemicity.

09:14.677 --> 09:17.137
One of those is actually the population pyramid.

09:18.477 --> 09:20.398
One of those is the PCR test.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.262
And so we have a number of pressure points that they simply must walk away from.

09:25.322 --> 09:33.866
If you bring them up, if you talk about them with any mastery, with any depth of understanding, it's basically the end of the conversation.

09:33.986 --> 09:44.150
If you start saying things like using their PCR tests to find their variants, doesn't make you a virologist, and it certainly doesn't make these variants real.

09:47.134 --> 09:49.735
And these are proprietary things.

09:49.835 --> 09:56.577
They're not open source, you know, GitHub test primers.

09:56.597 --> 10:03.760
These are proprietary things, many of which, the data of which is unavailable anymore because they're all gone.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.781
The EUAs were revoked and these companies went out of business.

10:07.521 --> 10:24.702
And so we are in an extraordinary situation where we are slowly but surely, this part of our history is starting to be so far in our rear view mirror that we can't usefully look back on it and think about what really happened and maybe even investigate what really happened.

10:25.203 --> 10:25.824
The murder

10:27.338 --> 10:29.239
It's getting older and older.

10:29.619 --> 10:32.081
The evidence trail's getting older and older.

10:32.121 --> 10:40.226
And as you know from your, you know, from watching TV shows and murder mysteries, you know that that's a real bad, that's a real bad sign.

10:40.266 --> 10:43.328
That's a real, real useful for the bad guys.

10:43.368 --> 10:45.169
And so we really got to stay focused.

10:45.789 --> 10:47.090
This is for all the marbles.

10:47.130 --> 10:50.532
That's why there is a fake anti-vax movement in America.

10:50.572 --> 10:51.493
Boy, my throat hurts.

10:53.934 --> 10:56.356
So I've been trying a lot to try and explain that the,

10:57.483 --> 11:12.831
The two-fold illusion of the pandemic is one of a PCR test that is not specific and therefore

11:19.739 --> 11:40.732
Most likely, any number of these PCR tests, they understand very well how an existing irreducibly complex background of genetic signals could be reduced to a high fidelity PCR signal for a pandemic by simply rolling out a specific test.

11:41.993 --> 11:47.917
Now, the other thing that they knew was that there would be a good time to do this.

11:50.117 --> 11:54.959
To do this same stunt in 2024, a little difficult.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.900
Kind of missed your window.

11:57.520 --> 12:02.882
Do this stunt in, say, 2015, and it might not even really be possible.

12:04.663 --> 12:16.428
But with careful management of the health care system and of our old population, careful management of the expenditure of funds and therapies,

12:17.512 --> 12:26.796
to extend the life of old people in America without telling anybody that in the population pyramid there was this problem here.

12:28.156 --> 12:40.802
And this problem, if we, once these people get to be retirement age, not only will they not be paying taxes, their fat salaries, their fat income tax, their capital gains tax, their property tax on their five houses,

12:41.696 --> 12:47.181
but they will start to draw down on that money that they've contributed instead.

12:48.101 --> 13:05.236
And so these bars, as they expand here, are anticipated rises in all-cause mortality that our ruling class has known about for decades, and in fact, has been planning, and that's why in 2019 and 20, they decided to do it then.

13:10.029 --> 13:20.834
That's why they decided to do it then because this signal coming up right now was about to need managing.

13:22.255 --> 13:36.902
If they didn't do anything about it, this, these, these groups that fill old folks homes and take up Medicare funding and costs sometimes by some estimates, as much as a half a million dollars for the last six months of their lives.

13:38.567 --> 13:52.977
Well, that's a pretty big burden we could avoid if we could just, for a couple years, I don't know, stop using antibiotics for a wide variety of bacterial infections under the idea that it's primarily a viral syndrome.

13:55.359 --> 14:01.203
That's what this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is all about.

14:01.343 --> 14:03.545
That's why we're talking about it right now.

14:05.146 --> 14:06.767
I don't know what I look like in the morning.

14:06.827 --> 14:08.088
I don't know what I look like now.

14:09.151 --> 14:12.474
But I've been to the gym already and I've been back.

14:12.594 --> 14:19.621
And so, if I look a little bit disheveled, it's because I, you know, this is what I look like when I get back from the gym.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.022
You can actually see.

14:21.042 --> 14:23.765
Am I using this one?

14:23.845 --> 14:27.188
I'll do like this and then I can go over here.

14:27.788 --> 14:29.270
You can actually see I have my...

14:32.361 --> 14:38.127
my plus four dukes on because I'm still I'm still in my in my shorts.

14:38.207 --> 14:43.091
So anyway, the point is, is that sorry if I look a little a little tired.

14:44.933 --> 14:45.754
It's been a long day.

14:45.814 --> 14:46.935
It's been a long weekend.

14:47.476 --> 14:48.557
It's been been heavy.

14:51.018 --> 14:57.203
This whole concept of how long we've been here now and how little progress is still being made.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.887
Mary Talley Bowden on Rogan was not very much progress.

15:01.967 --> 15:20.202
I'm not even sure how much progress we're making with Grace Shara's case and the idea of explaining, yes, Grace Shara is terrible, but then why is MD Breathe, Mary Talley Bowden, why is she not calling it murder?

15:21.127 --> 15:23.849
Why is she calling it intentional euthanization?

15:24.710 --> 15:35.059
Intentionally euthanized doesn't even make sense because euthanization and euthanasia implies informed consent, usually of more than one person.

15:36.621 --> 15:48.151
So, this idea that these people like Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and Daud and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:48.211 --> 15:55.018
and the epidemiologists from Stanford, Jianta Bhattacharya, Nick Hudson, the actuary from South Africa, and

15:55.658 --> 16:11.382
all these other people like Jessica Rose who's been working on VAERS for like five years now is unaware that there are population pyramids and unaware of Peter Zahon's work where he's talked about population pyramids and how much trouble China is in.

16:12.843 --> 16:13.463
So we know

16:14.787 --> 16:21.350
Okay, we've got a list of things that people won't talk about or usefully explain and cannot connect them.

16:21.570 --> 16:39.797
One of the worst ones is the lack of antibiotic use and the combination of that waiting in the background for anybody that was given supplementary oxygen when they walked in the door and said, you know, my pulse ox, I read online that the FLCCC said I should go to the hospital

16:41.064 --> 16:43.465
if my pulse ox is less than 96.

16:43.985 --> 16:46.545
So I'm here because my pulse ox is 94.

16:46.685 --> 16:51.206
I've been wearing this N95 mask all day.

16:51.266 --> 16:55.867
So I didn't think that I would get COVID, but you know, it's going down.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.708
It's almost at 90 now sometimes when I check it.

16:58.728 --> 16:59.848
So I thought I should come in.

17:00.608 --> 17:03.109
Well, sir, maybe we should give you some supplementary oxygen.

17:03.169 --> 17:08.990
And two hours later, he's got full on ARDS complaining about burning in his lungs.

17:10.650 --> 17:13.813
And they offer him a ventilator to make sure that it doesn't spread.

17:13.893 --> 17:15.674
Wow, it progressed fast, didn't it?

17:25.021 --> 17:26.602
And so everybody has a timeline.

17:26.642 --> 17:31.346
I can't stress enough how we need to do so much more work on timelines.

17:32.176 --> 17:37.577
One of the only guys that I know that does any resemblance of trying to do this is Mark Kulak.

17:37.637 --> 17:45.219
Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS has done an exceptional job organizing the history of these people.

17:45.299 --> 17:49.039
And I think it's really important to realize that everybody has one of these.

17:49.900 --> 17:54.240
And if you look at these people who are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:54.300 --> 18:01.462
and in his orbit right now, you will see a timeline that belies a collaborator

18:02.777 --> 18:14.049
or a person who's willing to look away while Americans are murdered and told around the world some story about what's really, what pandemic is happening.

18:14.630 --> 18:16.592
Same thing they did with people in Scotland.

18:18.337 --> 18:26.181
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like JJ Cooey.

18:26.441 --> 18:32.103
And so we have Nick Hudson all the way up to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:32.284 --> 18:39.547
and Jayanta Bhattacharya, knowing that there's a guy out there saying some of these things and having no answer for them.

18:41.420 --> 18:48.306
Jayanta Bhattacharya can't explain to you why intramuscular injection is good in the following scenarios.

18:50.128 --> 18:55.573
Robert Malone can't explain to you why RNA can pandemic in certain scenarios.

18:56.977 --> 19:13.464
He can't explain to you why the population pyramid would have been relevant before the pandemic and how a potential signal in the population pyramid could have been misconstrued as something that it wasn't with using, I don't know, dexamethasone like a hammer on the immune system.

19:14.905 --> 19:25.289
And transfection is a very important word to use because if you use the word gene therapy, then you're using such an umbrella term that it's like transportation.

19:27.062 --> 19:41.570
And so then you're so aspecific that if I'm trying to make the argument that we shouldn't make any more, you know, 1100 CC motorcycles or bigger, unless they're touring motorcycles.

19:43.031 --> 19:55.037
And I say, well, I, I think, you know, certain kinds of transportation are dangerous and, uh, you know, transportation in general is really bad and I don't want any transportation.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.061
That argument isn't going to work.

19:58.861 --> 19:59.941
It's too aspecific.

20:00.021 --> 20:10.024
And gene therapy is exactly what Robert Malone said when he came out and tried to spread the word and tried to be the good guy on Brett Weinstein.

20:10.224 --> 20:12.065
It's gene therapy and it's not.

20:12.725 --> 20:15.766
Gene therapy implies that we have this

20:19.924 --> 20:23.227
autism spectrum disorder and all of these things fit in it.

20:23.527 --> 20:27.210
Like we have this toolbox of gene therapy and all of these things fit in.

20:27.270 --> 20:30.552
And so we don't have to be very specific, but we do.

20:31.112 --> 20:36.476
And the reason why we have to be very specific is because we've been using this toolbox for a long time.

20:36.997 --> 20:38.238
It's not a new toolbox.

20:40.043 --> 20:56.949
But one of the most damning ways that young children and young people and young parents have been misled as a result of the pandemic and the panic that it created and the confusion that it created is that somehow these new vaccines worked, kinda.

20:58.210 --> 21:05.592
That the new technology works, that in principle, it's a great idea and much safer than old vaccines.

21:05.632 --> 21:09.554
There is at least half of the world population in the West that thinks that.

21:10.595 --> 21:29.158
And that is precisely because gene therapy was used as a general term to imply a new field, a developing field, a technology desert that needed new ideas that things hadn't been tried in yet.

21:29.258 --> 21:34.959
And finally, you know, we got lucky and we had this stuff in development and we said, go for it.

21:35.079 --> 21:35.679
And it worked.

21:37.820 --> 21:39.100
And this isn't going away.

21:40.646 --> 21:56.270
And it won't go away until we start realizing and people start to realize that this was an old technology on the bench in academia in use for more than a decade before the pandemic.

21:56.370 --> 22:04.732
And there are thousands and thousands of academic biologists because it wasn't called transfection by lipid nanoparticle.

22:04.752 --> 22:08.273
It wasn't called transformation by adenovirus.

22:09.298 --> 22:22.487
Because they called them vaccines, the brightest academics in our universities failed to see the illusion, failed to see the lie, failed to see the bait and switch.

22:23.508 --> 22:32.194
There are academic biologists all around the United States and the world that work specifically on neurobiology that use adenovirus all the time.

22:33.455 --> 22:37.018
And for them not to understand that those were not vaccines,

22:38.908 --> 22:40.049
It's just inexcusable.

22:42.691 --> 22:51.037
And yet they are getting, they are being excused, just like all the doctors in the United States and around the world are being excused.

22:51.077 --> 22:59.463
The doctors in the United States need to wake up and apologize, look at their records during, especially those of you that worked in hospitals,

23:00.504 --> 23:06.870
and see if in your hospital the protocol included supplementary oxygen as a standard.

23:06.970 --> 23:10.314
If it did, you probably committed murder.

23:11.635 --> 23:20.303
That's the reality of things.

23:20.563 --> 23:21.564
We call it progress.

23:22.952 --> 23:26.355
But I think we have to confront what we've actually accepted and what we've done.

23:27.155 --> 23:38.384
Science and technology and so on have gifted us lives of comparative ease compared to the lives of people living in even the recent past.

23:39.345 --> 23:42.668
We've all got the wisdom of the ages in our pockets.

23:44.029 --> 23:48.612
And we have convenience and everything's a click away.

23:49.898 --> 23:53.059
But in terms of now, you know, I don't really like this dude.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.159
I don't like his shtick.

23:54.219 --> 23:59.001
I don't like his softiness stuff, his scarves, but a lot of people do.

24:00.421 --> 24:06.103
And for a long time, I've already thought that he was part of this little show and I'm sure he is now.

24:06.784 --> 24:12.585
But again, he's scripted and he relies on the people that he interviews for his script.

24:13.366 --> 24:16.147
He relies on an occasional email for a script.

24:16.187 --> 24:16.847
He's not.

24:18.226 --> 24:23.769
wise enough and smart enough to have done the requisite work to get where we are.

24:24.469 --> 24:31.473
The requisite reading, the requisite studying, the requisite note-taking and analysis to get where we are.

24:33.193 --> 24:34.754
And that's the way it is.

24:34.854 --> 24:46.760
And so we're either going to be alone with these truths, or we're going to have to find examples of when people walk right up to the brick wall and don't see it.

24:48.658 --> 24:58.120
And more importantly, examples of people walking right up to the brick wall and somebody like Brett Weinstein turning them around and making them walk the other way.

25:00.500 --> 25:06.201
And once you start to be able to see examples of this, you won't be able to look away anymore.

25:06.241 --> 25:08.122
The whole internet will be full of this shit.

25:08.702 --> 25:09.842
You will be shocked.

25:11.702 --> 25:15.843
Progress, we're all stupid and without skills.

25:17.165 --> 25:17.685
We're all stupid.

25:17.705 --> 25:19.947
Most people don't know anything unless they look it up.

25:20.247 --> 25:22.349
And even at that, you have to know a certain amount.

25:22.469 --> 25:23.349
He's not wrong.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.111
I mean, is he wrong?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.232
Of course he's not wrong.

25:27.252 --> 25:30.894
You've got to think about the aggregate average person.

25:31.915 --> 25:40.641
And the aggregate average person justifies the way that our rulers appear to be ruling us.

25:42.366 --> 25:59.461
That's the part that bothers me the most about this conversation that I'm hearing here and that I heard here, is that these two guys, witting or unwitting, are basically gonna make the same argument that somebody like, I don't know, Jane Goodall would make.

25:59.481 --> 26:02.684
You know, it'd just be better if we only had 500,000 people on Earth.

26:03.805 --> 26:04.346
Here it comes.

26:05.177 --> 26:07.198
It's about four minutes in when that happens.

26:18.413 --> 26:22.135
You know, it becomes an interesting question.

26:22.255 --> 26:28.117
I definitely think as well that we've passed the point where you used to be able to say, well, medicine has given us longer, healthier lives.

26:28.918 --> 26:31.199
I think we've even passed the tipping point on that one.

26:31.379 --> 26:32.679
I think we're living shorter lives.

26:32.719 --> 26:36.941
We're certainly unhealthier, even if they're keeping us alive for 70, 80, 90 years.

26:37.541 --> 26:43.304
So medicine is what's supposed to keep us longer alive is already an awful assumption.

26:44.858 --> 26:46.759
And that's a guy who's totally trapped.

26:46.819 --> 26:58.644
He's been a skilled social media user and his job for the last five years has depended on him thinking that whatever he's experiencing is progress and learning.

26:58.684 --> 26:59.324
And it's not.

26:59.504 --> 27:01.205
It was enchantment.

27:03.386 --> 27:08.808
So much enchantment now that he thinks that medicine is supposed to extend your life.

27:09.068 --> 27:12.630
I mean, medicine is now not extending our life anymore.

27:15.484 --> 27:16.725
even if we're living longer.

27:16.745 --> 27:23.531
I think cumulatively, for all of the aforementioned reasons, we are less alive than we used to be.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.133
So are they trying to tell us that?

27:26.193 --> 27:27.794
Are they trying to convince us of that?

27:27.854 --> 27:29.456
Do they want us to feel that way?

27:29.496 --> 27:33.719
It appears that any of those things could be the objective here.

27:33.979 --> 27:39.264
And again, unwitting, witting, both unwitting, it's hard to tell.

27:40.481 --> 27:42.042
Lemmings behave like lemmings.

27:42.102 --> 27:44.284
They look like they're running no matter what they're doing.

27:44.344 --> 27:44.604
Right.

27:44.684 --> 27:48.367
So these could be lemmings running or they could be too.

27:50.909 --> 27:51.489
It's horrible.

27:52.070 --> 27:52.270
Yep.

27:52.710 --> 27:53.090
I agree.

27:53.591 --> 28:01.757
And we are degrading the quality of our lives through processes that are effectively automatic.

28:03.078 --> 28:06.220
And that concerns me greatly.

28:06.660 --> 28:20.206
That, for example, the enlightened perspective these days seems to be that the population gloom and doomers were wrong, which they were.

28:20.366 --> 28:28.790
So the population gloom and doomers are the people who said that the population was out of control and that the earth would be overrun with people

28:29.702 --> 28:34.223
And then the the earth would tilt and and the North Pole would change.

28:35.504 --> 28:37.244
Now, that's not going to happen, of course.

28:37.304 --> 28:46.287
We know already the math isn't there because they spent a lot of time in the 50s, 60s and 70s trying to convince people to stop having big, big families.

28:46.347 --> 28:46.907
And they did.

28:47.767 --> 28:48.948
They've gotten so good at it.

28:48.968 --> 28:51.549
They've convinced people not to be men and women anymore.

28:53.229 --> 28:59.351
And so let's see how well Brett covers this, that actually there's no population problem at all.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.501
and that the more the better.

29:02.782 --> 29:12.168
And I hear that and I just think, this is the over-extrapolation from an insight.

29:12.248 --> 29:13.789
Yes, the gloom and doomers were wrong.

29:15.250 --> 29:21.694
However, the more people you pack on this, the example I use is Yosemite.

29:23.024 --> 29:30.386
And the claim I will make is that Yosemite has shrunk by 50% in my lifetime.

29:31.087 --> 29:35.508
We shouldn't have as many people on the planet because Yosemite is crowded.

29:37.488 --> 29:39.109
There's too many people on Earth.

29:39.169 --> 29:40.569
Yosemite sucks now.

29:40.649 --> 29:44.891
Yosemite is being ruined because when I go to Yosemite, I run into people.

29:44.911 --> 29:51.633
Well, it hasn't shrunk at all.

29:52.711 --> 29:56.033
But there are twice as many people on the planet, and there's only one Yosemite.

29:56.874 --> 30:06.701
So from the point of view of that Yosemite doing its role, it's twice as burdened.

30:11.294 --> 30:17.098
We are doing that across so many domains that there's no thought.

30:17.339 --> 30:21.242
We've signed up for an economic system that effectively requires the population to grow.

30:21.882 --> 30:22.522
So here he goes.

30:22.623 --> 30:30.769
Now he's going to tell you that he's an economist because he works on complex systems, because evolution is a complex system, and this guy's a shithead.

30:31.429 --> 30:35.332
Now, I mean that in the worst way possible.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.661
I think this is one of the worst Americans alive right now.

30:43.262 --> 30:48.845
And it's really a combination of fraud and also malevolence.

30:51.447 --> 30:57.370
And somebody or some people behind the scenes have really convinced this guy that he's much smarter than he is.

30:57.390 --> 31:04.995
And it is extraordinary because again, it's herding cats and he herds a lot of cats.

31:05.717 --> 31:09.400
because the algorithms make sure that all the cats see them, that need to.

31:09.961 --> 31:30.599
Because economic growth is built in, or it is not even built in, it's assumed, which is part of why we're in such trouble when economic growth gives way and people's built-in expectations are violated, they become violent and dangerous.

31:32.043 --> 31:34.045
So I don't know what he means.

31:34.525 --> 31:40.351
I don't know what violent and dangerous, I guess, is when people don't get the bread that they want, then they get violent.

31:40.391 --> 31:41.892
And I don't know what he's talking about.

31:43.754 --> 31:46.216
But he is is absolutely a fraud.

31:47.838 --> 31:48.739
So the question is.

31:51.514 --> 32:01.762
Surely there is a number, a population number, at which the effect on the planet is negative if it grows beyond that number.

32:02.222 --> 32:05.144
I've never heard a good discussion of what that number might be.

32:05.364 --> 32:06.645
Is it half of where we are?

32:06.765 --> 32:08.526
Is it twice where we are?

32:08.647 --> 32:10.548
It's not indefinitely

32:11.328 --> 32:14.871
growing, that will certainly be devastating.

32:14.971 --> 32:26.781
Isn't the reality though that, I mean, you're the scientist and the biologist here, but aren't we confronting population diminishing?

32:28.742 --> 32:29.983
Yeah, we are.

32:30.183 --> 32:48.914
Fertility and or the number of children being born is in steep decline, not just in the West where you might expect it, given lifestyles and whatever, contraception and all of the rest of it, but in the East, in Asia,

32:49.594 --> 32:56.139
you know, the populations in some instances are falling off, falling faster than a piano out of a window.

32:56.699 --> 32:58.380
And so you got to be careful here, right?

32:58.420 --> 33:00.021
Because he's bringing up something.

33:00.102 --> 33:01.523
It sounds like he's almost there.

33:01.583 --> 33:07.727
But what are the consequences of a population that is not having children?

33:09.588 --> 33:18.795
The consequences are, yeah, that you're going to have a rise in all cause mortality because growth is built in.

33:20.276 --> 33:21.797
Growth is built in.

33:23.159 --> 33:37.071
And then underneath that, you're gonna have the effects of the management of the family, the management of the economic pressure, the socioeconomic pressures that reduce the size of the family.

33:40.233 --> 33:44.077
And so he's kind of aware, he's kind of aware

33:45.728 --> 33:53.011
but they seem to be grossly unaware of the basics of what a population pyramid is.

33:53.412 --> 33:56.533
And more importantly, what did it look like in 2018?

33:58.394 --> 33:59.395
What does it look like now?

33:59.455 --> 34:02.396
What is China's population pyramid look like?

34:02.456 --> 34:07.198
Should they also have an expected rise in all cause mortality followed by a collapse?

34:09.059 --> 34:10.240
How long does that take?

34:10.660 --> 34:12.621
How long can they project it will be?

34:15.305 --> 34:18.807
and these two clowns will never get anywhere near it.

34:18.867 --> 34:20.729
So he's approaching the brick wall right now.

34:20.789 --> 34:23.951
Aren't we having some kind of population collapse?

34:25.111 --> 34:25.312
Sure.

34:26.212 --> 34:30.935
So is population pressure really the burgeoning problem?

34:33.517 --> 34:39.601
What I'm telling you is these numbers right here, this rise behind me here, this is hardly anything.

34:41.604 --> 34:45.928
And so with a little sculpting and a little lies, this was how it was possible.

34:45.988 --> 34:49.110
The lies have to be told on podcasts by podcasters.

34:49.731 --> 34:52.333
They have to be told repeatedly by podcasters.

34:53.895 --> 34:59.519
That's why all these podcasters shifted to two or three shooters after Donald Trump's ear was nicked.

35:02.042 --> 35:08.387
That's why all of these people switched to everything they switched to in sync from 2020 until now.

35:10.779 --> 35:27.029
because it's supposed to be an illusion of consensus, an illusion of momentum, which has evolved into the illusion of a health freedom movement that every time these people say the health freedom movement, they are conjuring it because it doesn't exist.

35:31.806 --> 35:32.886
medium-term future.

35:33.106 --> 35:39.368
Is it not the loss of populations that's going to present challenges?

35:39.668 --> 35:41.069
There are exceptions to that.

35:41.309 --> 35:59.014
It isn't the loss of population that was presenting and could have presented huge challenges to places like Scotland, where the ageing population was retired and drawing down taxes, not paying them, drawing down on medical costs, not paying into it.

36:00.083 --> 36:05.164
Just like in America, just like in Japan, just like in the UK.

36:07.244 --> 36:12.065
And so what I think you see here is population management.

36:15.626 --> 36:25.648
And in America, they needed to do something extra awful because in order to tell a story about a virus that everybody's vulnerable, everybody's got to get, everybody's got to get murdered.

36:27.338 --> 36:36.165
But they're not going to convince a bunch of 25-year, 30-year, 40-year-olds to go to the hospital in the middle of the pandemic, because that wouldn't have worked.

36:38.647 --> 36:41.209
So they let opioids go wild on our streets.

36:41.569 --> 36:44.332
And they had it already ramping up.

36:44.632 --> 36:46.573
At 2019, it was already on the way up.

36:46.593 --> 36:47.534
The slope was great.

36:47.574 --> 36:48.135
And then 2020, 21, 22, 23, 24, awful.

36:54.810 --> 36:59.611
As far as I can tell, at least a million Americans were killed by that.

36:59.811 --> 37:00.412
One million.

37:02.412 --> 37:03.472
And a lot of them are young.

37:04.633 --> 37:16.836
And so what that did was provide a very strong signal in the all-cause mortality that ended up reducing the life expectancy in America, making it look like

37:17.887 --> 37:22.592
Medicine is just failing, as this mouth breather just said a few minutes ago.

37:22.692 --> 37:28.658
Medicine, it looks like we've reached the limit on being able to provide a longer life expectancy.

37:30.659 --> 37:32.021
Ray Kurzweiler was wrong.

37:34.485 --> 37:37.888
places in Africa that are still growing like Topsy.

37:37.928 --> 37:47.735
But is the Malthusian nightmares, the population bomb, Erlich, and all the rest of it, is it a realistic threat anyway?

37:49.016 --> 37:53.160
Did they really just mention the book that I just read to you a few days ago?

37:54.901 --> 37:56.983
Did they really just mention this book?

38:00.245 --> 38:00.866
Yes, they did.

38:02.105 --> 38:05.326
In this podcast, does he really talk about narrative sculpting?

38:05.966 --> 38:06.787
Yes, he does.

38:07.427 --> 38:13.929
But the only person who's ever said that this narrative was sculpted using murder and lies is me.

38:16.750 --> 38:20.832
It's unfortunate, ladies and gentlemen, but what you see is the brick wall right here.

38:21.972 --> 38:26.154
Nobody else, unfortunately, has gotten this close to the brick wall.

38:27.554 --> 38:35.979
with these people, where these actors are taking my language for the last three years and subtly incorporating it into their dumb shit show.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.221
And yeah, we have narrative sculpting.

38:44.993 --> 39:07.198
the population bomb was wrong but the sophistication that arises from wrecking the population bomb was not wrong the population bomb resulted in the population pyramid we have because they were very successful in convincing people that the population bomb was real and so people stopped having kids people accepted abortion

39:08.356 --> 39:14.519
People accepted birth control as ways to avoid the population bomb.

39:14.559 --> 39:17.021
So the population bomb wasn't wrong.

39:17.601 --> 39:18.862
We were managed.

39:20.322 --> 39:23.244
That's why my brother and his wife aren't having kids.

39:24.885 --> 39:30.548
Because they've been convinced that that's the good thing to do for the environment and for the world.

39:34.261 --> 39:37.283
That's why a lot of families are only having one kid now.

39:38.144 --> 39:44.288
It's not only because it's harder and harder to afford children, which is kind of an illusion.

39:44.328 --> 39:51.613
If you have one, then, you know, it's like, really, how much more food do you really need to make for a four-year-old when you have a four-year-old at the table already?

39:53.814 --> 39:56.316
Ladies and gentlemen, this is bullshit.

39:56.616 --> 40:01.420
The population bomb, this book, and the other ones that I've read are not wrong.

40:02.386 --> 40:13.112
They resulted in the societal shift and attitude in having big families exactly the way they should have with a doom and gloom book like this one.

40:19.656 --> 40:25.560
And we're still being told mythologies that are, that are, that are,

40:26.505 --> 40:43.256
essentially our governing our governing mechanism recognizing this you know what we need is more people really have you looked at the rate of consumption of the version of life that you're selling people have you looked at

40:44.096 --> 41:09.643
the capacity of most people to raise healthy children so my feeling is this is not a so the capacity to raise healthy children has dropped off and so we should drop it off even more the the arguments that he's making are incoherent like they always are but in this case it's extraordinary because the population pyramid is the signal

41:11.564 --> 41:13.525
The population pyramid is the reason.

41:13.565 --> 41:16.768
The population pyramid is the, and the pandemic was the answer.

41:18.869 --> 41:21.091
The population pyramid was the problem.

41:21.451 --> 41:23.012
The pandemic was the answer.

41:23.412 --> 41:27.595
And the human genome project was the, the beneficiary.

41:28.896 --> 41:35.981
Palantir and any other company that has their hands on the data has the, is the beneficiary.

41:37.233 --> 41:49.164
I mean, we can do connectivity between, let's say, all the Indians and all the people associated with Robert Malone and how that all seems to be connected with Steve Bannon and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:49.204 --> 41:57.311
We could also talk about how Palantir has a Stanford internet observatory.

41:58.314 --> 42:07.160
where a lot of these Stanford people come from and where Huberman still says that he's a faculty member, but he doesn't have a lab anymore.

42:08.501 --> 42:10.582
Larry Ellison donated to Stanford.

42:10.642 --> 42:16.026
I think Larry Ellison also is somehow related to this AI and the storage of data stuff.

42:17.687 --> 42:24.352
He's also related to Oracle, and Oracle is essentially the company that provides all the database solutions for the U.S.

42:24.412 --> 42:24.792
government.

42:27.062 --> 42:47.668
And so you could think about them having some Indian agents or something like that, but there's a lot of ways to look at this web of people, but there are very few ways to unsee the fact that Brett Weinstein's dad, that's Eric Weinstein's dad, worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

42:47.628 --> 42:51.909
's dad to update the FDA.

42:52.890 --> 42:57.032
in a way that probably was to the dissatisfaction of Estes Kefauver.

42:59.213 --> 43:08.496
And so this guy operating on this level of obfuscation on a direct, this is the only messages that I've had in the last two years.

43:08.916 --> 43:13.158
These four have gotten it down to these, this many words.

43:14.078 --> 43:20.701
And so for him to be saying that the population pyramid is not a relevant signal is absolutely absurd.

43:22.952 --> 43:31.718
especially when his guest obviously knows that something's going on, but see the trick is they wanted the population to collapse.

43:32.539 --> 43:45.889
That was the whole point of releasing a book like this and then going on talk shows and writing editorials in newspapers and Time Magazine for the next 20 years and discouraging people from having too big a family.

43:47.042 --> 43:53.633
That's the same reason why China instituted the one-child policy on the advice of, I guess, us.

43:56.117 --> 43:57.960
India didn't have a one-child policy.

44:03.396 --> 44:09.599
And so these people are, wittingly or unwittingly, they are part of this now, and they need to be woken up to it.

44:10.059 --> 44:11.399
They need to be shamed of it.

44:11.860 --> 44:25.245
They need to be like, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that I'm so incompetent that after five years of the luxury of having more than enough money for my family to travel all around the world, including going to Romania in 2023 in November,

44:27.606 --> 44:54.803
meeting Stephen Hatfield, and Nick Hudson, and Robert Malone, and Jill Glasspool Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Denny Rancourt, and Jessica Rose, and Ryan Cole, all over in Romania, and Bucharest, or whatever the hell, Budapest, whatever the place is called, all on stage together, reciting the narrative that they have made no progress on.

44:56.690 --> 44:59.452
And they knew that I was saying this already back then.

44:59.472 --> 45:02.314
I was still working for CHD back then.

45:04.676 --> 45:07.157
A numeric parameter.

45:08.438 --> 45:12.081
For one thing, I'm uncompelled that you can do the analysis.

45:13.892 --> 45:36.592
population if one person is consuming effectively the resources of 10 or 20 people if they let's say live in the first world that so this is a great reason to lie about the population pyramid so you can tell a story about a novel virus and in reality you're just murdering people because we have too many people

45:39.952 --> 45:43.653
And, you know, we can say, oh, population is crashing.

45:43.813 --> 45:45.934
Well, but it's not effectively crashing from the.

45:46.914 --> 45:52.296
It's not effectively crashing because people use too much stuff.

45:54.576 --> 45:56.677
This video is really, really awful.

45:58.277 --> 46:01.839
And Brett Weinstein's takes on things are really, really awful.

46:05.891 --> 46:07.372
I really think there is a way out.

46:07.492 --> 46:09.333
I really do think that there's a way out.

46:09.533 --> 46:10.614
It's this one right here.

46:12.014 --> 46:18.138
The Population Pyramid is what they should have been looking at and talking about and discussing with each other and they weren't.

46:18.938 --> 46:32.606
If he would have looked at the Population Pyramid of Scotland, that Scottish man would be more than ashamed of himself because the signal that's visible in this Population Pyramid was pretty absurd in the Scottish one.

46:33.339 --> 46:36.060
And that's why so many people were murdered in Scotland.

46:37.160 --> 46:43.862
And he should be just absolutely ashamed not to know that.

46:44.963 --> 46:49.644
It's an anticipated rise, ladies and gentlemen, an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

46:49.764 --> 46:50.884
RNA cannot pandemic.

46:50.924 --> 46:52.505
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

46:53.365 --> 46:56.606
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime.

46:57.506 --> 47:01.928
And I'm going to do something else for the way out, I think.

47:03.826 --> 47:06.689
Anyway, we're going to start this Biology 101 really soon now.

47:07.850 --> 47:13.495
I had a guest come over over the weekend and some inspiring things happened, some inspiring discussion.

47:14.356 --> 47:21.542
And I think I have my head organized in such a way that the short course on virology can now begin.

47:22.623 --> 47:25.926
And so I'm not exactly sure the timing of it yet.

47:25.986 --> 47:28.548
And so in the meantime, I'm just going to put a placeholder here.

47:29.369 --> 47:46.889
to say that this will be a study hall week and we'll do more more things like this probably watching another video tomorrow for now trying to get the timing right um but i think i'm ready and i think most of the writing and note taking and organizing of these day these ideas is done now

47:48.700 --> 47:51.741
Unfortunately for the meddlers, I haven't typed really anything in.

47:53.262 --> 47:56.003
And so it's not really available for them anywhere yet.

47:56.044 --> 47:58.985
And so I think that's why there's a little bit of a holding pattern right now.

47:59.645 --> 48:04.968
But once we start teaching this stuff and getting this stuff out, I think things will become more interesting.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.270
So I got to give my voice a rest.

48:07.930 --> 48:09.451
It really feels like I have to push hard.

48:11.345 --> 48:16.692
Hopefully there's nothing going on there, and we will be back online in the morning.

48:16.752 --> 48:17.753
So I will see you.

48:17.953 --> 48:20.957
Remember, it was a national security operation from day one.

48:20.997 --> 48:25.483
What you've ended up accepting is PCR as a diagnostic standard, which is definitely bad.

48:26.544 --> 48:30.048
Accepting sequencing as a high-fidelity measurement, also not good.

48:30.989 --> 48:36.333
Intramuscular injection is proven beyond question as a methodology, also definitely not true.

48:37.934 --> 48:41.277
And people like Brett Weinstein are not going to help us with that.

48:41.977 --> 48:44.259
RNA obviously has huge military potential.

48:44.299 --> 48:50.704
This is actually true because you can use RNA or DNA to produce a gold standard PCR positive.

48:51.704 --> 48:54.145
Trump was shot and the mystery was solved.

48:54.705 --> 49:00.127
America's health problems will be complicated to solve and we should be happy with him already there.

49:00.727 --> 49:01.948
And of course, that's not true.

49:02.008 --> 49:02.748
I apologize.

49:02.788 --> 49:03.688
This is an old deck.

49:05.149 --> 49:06.710
But this is where we are.

49:06.970 --> 49:08.530
These people are how we got here.

49:08.590 --> 49:18.674
These are some of the, you know, this guy, this guy, that dude up there, some of the worst Americans out there right now because they are masquerading as something that they are not.

49:19.349 --> 49:23.890
And they're all basically on the same script, making sure, checking in, having table meetings.

49:25.350 --> 49:27.471
And we're wiping the floor with them right now.

49:28.331 --> 49:29.671
I'm very happy about that.

49:29.731 --> 49:34.552
But just keep in mind, I do think that the Trump shooting was likely faked in some way.

49:34.572 --> 49:43.154
I can't explain it any other way than my son goes to the same high school and we still don't know anything about Matthew Crooks.

49:43.194 --> 49:45.195
He lived like four blocks away from my house.

49:46.061 --> 49:47.282
And that's just ridiculous.

49:48.742 --> 49:52.344
HHS secretary as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.424
is just a distraction.

49:54.485 --> 49:57.046
Marty McCary, for example, Jay Bhattacharya.

49:57.906 --> 50:03.248
Now Robert Malone is going to regain his reputation and get right back in the DITRA game, I guess.

50:03.929 --> 50:07.190
And solving America's health problems isn't on the agenda.

50:07.230 --> 50:08.951
It's collecting America's health data.

50:10.869 --> 50:23.075
And you can see that although he made a big press release about the AI infrastructure that he was going to build in the United States, he didn't make much of a press release about the budget that he submitted because he didn't submit one.

50:25.196 --> 50:28.178
I'm very happy that everybody joined me today.

50:28.258 --> 50:29.438
Thank you very much for being here.

50:29.478 --> 50:30.439
I'm sorry that I'm late.

50:31.459 --> 50:36.141
I'm not really sure why my voice is so bad right now, but it feels like I really got to push hard.

50:37.282 --> 50:38.683
So I am definitely

50:39.811 --> 50:44.055
I'm definitely, definitely, definitely going to get offline right now.

50:47.139 --> 50:47.439
Thank you.

51:15.131 --> 51:15.719
goals to life.
