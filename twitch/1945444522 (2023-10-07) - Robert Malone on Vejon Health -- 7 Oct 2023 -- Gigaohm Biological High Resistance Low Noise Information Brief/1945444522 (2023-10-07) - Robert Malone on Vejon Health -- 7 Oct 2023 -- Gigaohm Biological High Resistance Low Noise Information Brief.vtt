00:00.000 --> 00:26.560
I think I hear some choppers, I got some choppers over my house, I don't know what to say but

00:26.560 --> 00:32.800
Andrew Huff said choppers, other people have had choppers, I got choppers over my house

00:32.800 --> 00:36.560
every night, I must be over the target.

01:02.800 --> 01:32.800
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank

01:32.800 --> 02:02.800
you, thank you, thank you, thank you

02:02.800 --> 02:32.800
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you

02:32.800 --> 03:02.800
thank you, thank you, thank you

03:02.800 --> 03:32.800
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you

03:32.800 --> 04:02.800
thank you thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Thank you, thank you

04:02.800 --> 04:04.560
I found the mummy!

04:04.560 --> 04:08.800
Well, gang, I guess that wraps up the mystery, and the mummy too!

04:09.800 --> 04:11.800
We will win!

04:32.800 --> 04:41.800
Are we doing the city of the A's?

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
Yes.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
Are we doing the city of the A's?

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
Yes.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
Yes.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
Two days ago.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.800
What sites did you see?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.800
Think of a bear and a tummy.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.800
Ball?

05:08.800 --> 05:09.800
Ball?

05:09.800 --> 05:10.800
Ball?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.800
You don't understand Mr. Brown.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.800
The bomb is a holy weapon of peace.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.800
Are we doing the stand on the city of the A's?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
This is KIGO, oh, biological, high-resistance, low-noise,

05:24.800 --> 05:30.800
information brief brought to you by a biologist at 7th of October, 2023.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.800
The Nobel Prize has recently been awarded for the extraordinary

05:40.800 --> 05:45.800
extraordinary vaccines that have saved almost 14 million lives.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.800
They're misleading the young ladies and gentlemen.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
We've got to put a stop to it.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
They are misleading the young.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
And we've got to put a stop to it.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.800
We've got to teach them the history before it's erased forever.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.800
The next generations are being set up with lies.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.800
We cannot hand over our children to these charlatans.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.800
It's going to require everyone to stand up.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
Even if you can see the brick wall at the back of the theater,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.800
there are other people who can't.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.800
We've got to show them.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
We've got to show them.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.800
There was no spread in New York City infectious clones,

06:34.800 --> 06:43.800
and the only real threat to placebo batches were likely

06:43.800 --> 06:47.800
distributed, and transfection in healthy mammals is dumb.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.800
Protocols were murdered, gained a function in mythology.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.800
The Scooby-Doo mystery is a real thing,

06:55.800 --> 06:58.800
and the players are spectacularly committed to lies.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
That's all we got here.

07:01.800 --> 07:06.800
MUSIC

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.800
This is Giga Home Biological High Resistance Low Noise

07:25.800 --> 07:28.800
Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.800
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.800
I'm coming to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.800
Like I said, it's the 7th of October, 2023,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.800
and we've got so much work to do.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
It's kind of absurd.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
So we just have to keep working,

07:42.800 --> 07:46.800
and that's why, once again, I'm here to tell you

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
not to take the debate on social media,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
not to take the debate on television,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
but keep learning the biology,

07:52.800 --> 07:55.800
keep trying to learn the real history,

07:55.800 --> 07:58.800
keep trying to learn how money really works,

07:58.800 --> 08:01.800
and take measures to save your family from this nonsense,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.800
but definitely, please definitely disengage

08:04.800 --> 08:07.800
from solving this mystery.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.800
It's not a mystery that needs solving,

08:10.800 --> 08:14.800
and that's the reason why we're here at Giga Home Biological,

08:14.800 --> 08:17.800
because it is not a matter of what is true that counts,

08:17.800 --> 08:20.800
but a matter of what is perceived to be true,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.800
and they've known that for a very long time,

08:22.800 --> 08:25.800
much longer than a few years.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.800
Chatty GTP is an illusion compared to the amount of control

08:30.800 --> 08:33.800
that they've had over us through this very mechanism

08:33.800 --> 08:36.800
of controlling the spectrum of debate

08:36.800 --> 08:39.800
and having a very lively debate within that controlled spectrum

08:39.800 --> 08:42.800
to make it seem like everybody's free.

08:42.800 --> 08:46.800
When in reality, the very perceived reality

08:46.800 --> 08:49.800
is defined by that debate itself,

08:49.800 --> 08:52.800
and that's what the intellectual dark web has done to us.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.800
That's why we keep making these people map discussions,

08:56.800 --> 09:01.800
because we need to figure out what these people did in 2019

09:01.800 --> 09:03.800
and 2020 and 21,

09:03.800 --> 09:06.800
so that we can see if there's a consistent pattern of behavior

09:06.800 --> 09:10.800
fighting for sovereignty and fighting for the sacred,

09:10.800 --> 09:15.800
and if not, then we need to disengage from them.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.800
And so we've talked many times,

09:18.800 --> 09:21.800
but the essential illusion, the essential faith,

09:21.800 --> 09:24.800
is the idea that there was a novel virus

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
that everyone was vulnerable to.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
The idea that we had to do something,

09:28.800 --> 09:30.800
and that's why we took the extreme measures

09:30.800 --> 09:33.800
of giving little kids iPads at home

09:33.800 --> 09:35.800
and shutting down schools,

09:35.800 --> 09:37.800
shutting down small businesses,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.800
masking children,

09:39.800 --> 09:43.800
separating people from their elderly family members,

09:43.800 --> 09:48.800
the whole nine yards.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.800
And if you want to really see through it,

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
the easy way to do it is to find people

09:51.800 --> 09:54.800
who are telling you that this transfection is not immunization.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
Try to find people that are telling you

09:56.800 --> 09:59.800
that intramuscular injection

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
of any combination of substances,

10:01.800 --> 10:04.800
the augment the immune system is a pretty dumb idea.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.800
And then you'll be able to whittle it down really fast,

10:07.800 --> 10:10.800
because most people are talking about bioweapons,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
most people are talking about amyloidosis,

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
most people are talking about crazy lipid nanoparticle,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.800
poor quality control,

10:18.800 --> 10:23.800
and people are talking about DNA contamination.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.800
And so we're almost there.

10:27.800 --> 10:32.800
But as long as we stay focused on their little spectrum of debate

10:32.800 --> 10:37.800
where maybe the mRNA was done or rushed wrong incorrectly,

10:37.800 --> 10:42.800
Nobel Prize was given to the wrong person for the wrong reason,

10:42.800 --> 10:47.800
then we're not arguing about what we should be arguing about.

10:47.800 --> 10:51.800
And we're not asking the right questions.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.800
I think that's another way to think about it if that helps you better.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
These people have tricked us into asking the wrong questions.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.800
These people have tricked us into chasing the wrong villains.

11:01.800 --> 11:06.800
These people have tricked us into trying to solve the wrong mystery.

11:07.800 --> 11:12.800
And they've given us this illusion of consensus about what that mystery is,

11:12.800 --> 11:16.800
the illusion of consensus about what the obvious conclusion is,

11:16.800 --> 11:21.800
the illusion of consensus that we have all come to agree about this

11:21.800 --> 11:25.800
when we haven't.

11:25.800 --> 11:30.800
We have discussed recently with Denny Rancour and Peter McCullough on my stream

11:30.800 --> 11:36.800
about the all-cause mortality being quite unrevealing with regard to

11:36.800 --> 11:42.800
a novel cause of death sweeping the world like a plague.

11:42.800 --> 11:47.800
The math doesn't support the idea of a novel cause of death

11:47.800 --> 11:52.800
sweeping the world like a plague.

11:53.800 --> 12:06.800
And that's a problem because if you say to somebody that there's a new cause of death on Earth

12:06.800 --> 12:09.800
and that everybody's equally vulnerable to it,

12:09.800 --> 12:14.800
and then there isn't an increase in all cause mortality across age groups

12:14.800 --> 12:18.800
that's detectable in temporal relationship to this declaration,

12:18.800 --> 12:21.800
you have a problem.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.800
If where there is an outbreak in one geographic location,

12:25.800 --> 12:30.800
there isn't an outbreak in subsequent nearby geographic locations,

12:30.800 --> 12:35.800
then you have a problem.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.800
And that's what seems to have happened in a lot of places in the United States

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
and in fact around the world.

12:41.800 --> 12:46.800
And Denny Rancour's data seems to show a sharp increase

12:46.800 --> 12:51.800
in all cause mortality as the countermeasures were rolled out

12:51.800 --> 12:54.800
and specifically the mRNA shot around the world.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.800
And as would be expected,

12:58.800 --> 13:05.800
serial exposure to this kind of a reagent

13:05.800 --> 13:11.800
is going to result in possible cascading effects or avalanche type effects

13:11.800 --> 13:15.800
in the immune system as the reactivity of the immune system builds.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.800
Now there's some people that are arguing that IgG4 is showing up

13:21.800 --> 13:25.800
and so that means that we're building a tolerance to this spike protein

13:25.800 --> 13:27.800
and that is possible.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
It's possible.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.800
It's one possible mechanism, one possible outcome,

13:33.800 --> 13:39.800
but they have no, they can't guarantee that because they don't understand

13:39.800 --> 13:43.800
the mechanism by which in some people that's occurring

13:43.800 --> 13:47.800
and in some people it's not.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.800
In some people they just keep getting repeated respiratory disease

13:51.800 --> 13:56.800
and repeated somehow become COVID positive again

13:56.800 --> 14:01.800
or not COVID positive but still sick.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.800
Long term lack of energy, all the other things that people have

14:05.800 --> 14:11.800
around this thing called POTS or whatever other description it's had.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
So we're really dealing with something very spectacular because

14:15.800 --> 14:20.800
even Peter McCullough, a guy who was surrounded from the very beginning

14:20.800 --> 14:23.800
by people whispering in his ear,

14:23.800 --> 14:28.800
assuring him with high level national security phone calls

14:28.800 --> 14:32.800
that this was a national security issue that we needed to be afraid

14:32.800 --> 14:35.800
of whether we were under attack or whether this was a release.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
We don't know where this is going to go.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.800
It could be a worst case scenario.

14:39.800 --> 14:44.800
So you got to be really careful what you say there, Mr. Peter.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.800
And so for him to be very impressed

14:49.800 --> 14:52.800
with Denny Rancor's ability to explain,

14:52.800 --> 14:56.800
yeah, but despite what you think,

14:56.800 --> 14:59.800
I've cleaned this data up, I've looked at the dates,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
we've only looked at the data that we can trust and we look at many,

15:02.800 --> 15:06.800
many countries and many, many places we see the same signal.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.800
Peter needed to hear it from Denny and he did hear it and it was really

15:09.800 --> 15:14.800
impactual because this was around the same time that Peter had just recently

15:14.800 --> 15:19.800
come out like I have with the idea that just the whole vaccine schedule in America

15:19.800 --> 15:22.800
needs some serious reconsideration.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
Then we ran into this character.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
We did a video about him.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.800
He tweeted some nonsense about how in the hands of,

15:29.800 --> 15:35.800
in the hands of a competent scientist, PCR is highly accurate, well, duh.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.800
And then he blocked me.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.800
And of course that's not surprising, right?

15:39.800 --> 15:43.800
Because he was involved in the testing and he's involved in perpetuating this idea

15:43.800 --> 15:47.800
that we have nothing to question about the faith.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.800
The novel virus is defined specifically by sequencing reactions,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
which are all driven by PCR.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
And that's his wheelhouse.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
And he wants you to believe, just like Kevin McKernan,

15:58.800 --> 16:02.800
that he has no conflicts of interest with regard to telling you

16:02.800 --> 16:07.800
that the fidelity of these, these diagnostics and the fidelity of these

16:07.800 --> 16:12.800
sequencing reactions is beyond, beyond question.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.800
You can't question the accuracy of these things.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
Even though there are articles where they talk about

16:19.800 --> 16:24.800
viruses raining down from the sky on the order of 800 million viruses per

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
square meter per day.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.800
Some absurd number like this giant amount of RNA is floating around

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
in the world.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.800
But you know, we can find all these little pieces and put them together

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
and convince you that what we're finding is real.

16:39.800 --> 16:46.800
I think there's a lot of shenanigans going on and I think the behavior

16:46.800 --> 16:50.800
of these people reveals that it is indeed shenanigans.

16:50.800 --> 16:55.800
It's not people genuinely fighting for the truth, trying to organize

16:55.800 --> 16:59.800
around health, freedom and sovereignty over ourselves and our children.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.800
You know that Kevin McKernan is not fighting for that.

17:04.800 --> 17:09.800
He's fighting for something to do with personalized weed

17:09.800 --> 17:12.800
and genetically modified pot plants.

17:12.800 --> 17:19.800
Philip Buckholtz is making money as a sequencer and as a test maker

17:19.800 --> 17:23.800
and as an advisor to all the companies that would ever want to take advantage

17:23.800 --> 17:27.800
of any of this mythology in the future.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.800
He's asserted himself as a guy who does that for a licks.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.800
We're really good at that.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.800
Me and my lab are really good at that.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.800
100% on board with the idea of a novel virus for which we have to do something

17:41.800 --> 17:45.800
which we could keep tracking and we should keep sequencing

17:45.800 --> 17:56.800
and keep making better sequencing technologies and sequencing products for.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.800
We've looked at these four guys because there's some game being played here

18:00.800 --> 18:04.800
because it's just really short through the corner.

18:04.800 --> 18:10.800
George Webb's favorite biological advice comes from Dr. Paul Catrell

18:10.800 --> 18:14.800
who's not even a doctor even though George Webb says over and over and over

18:14.800 --> 18:18.800
and over again for three years that Paul Catrell is going to med school

18:18.800 --> 18:22.800
and was going to med school at the beginning of the pandemic when he wasn't.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
Every once in a while he says it wasn't med school.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.800
It was something you do before med school.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.800
So then he's not Dr. Paul Catrell but he is because he has a PhD

18:30.800 --> 18:36.800
from Walden University in finance where he did chaos theory and bond trading.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.800
So he's kind of like that guy that does pizza reviews from New York City

18:44.800 --> 18:50.800
but then this guy is more like the Jurassic Park character

18:50.800 --> 18:58.800
who did chaos theory so he's like a combination of the guy in Jurassic Park

18:58.800 --> 19:02.800
with that pizza delivery or the pizza review guy that also traded,

19:02.800 --> 19:06.800
day traded and made a lot of money like I don't know it's just such a joke to me

19:06.800 --> 19:12.800
and what becomes more of a joke is that somebody like Robert Malone

19:12.800 --> 19:18.800
wants us to believe that in his quest to save the world

19:18.800 --> 19:22.800
he came out on the bread wine steam podcast in the way that he did in June

19:22.800 --> 19:26.800
and then also he came out on Paul Catrell

19:26.800 --> 19:30.800
with Paul Catrell and some other radio network enlightenment radio network

19:30.800 --> 19:34.800
because he's just trying to get the word out there.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.800
You know because he's got all these connections in government that just ignore him

19:38.800 --> 19:42.800
so you know what does he got to do he's got to stream with these kinds of people

19:42.800 --> 19:45.800
even though he used to work with carrot funded bullshit

19:45.800 --> 19:49.800
carrot funded bullshit has already been on the web all over the place

19:49.800 --> 19:53.800
for six months before June 21

19:53.800 --> 19:57.800
Robert Malone comes out and pretends he doesn't even know

19:57.800 --> 20:01.800
or doesn't even mention that he knows carrot funded bullshit until June of 21

20:01.800 --> 20:05.800
now all of a sudden yeah okay I'm on Paul Catrell and I know carrot

20:09.800 --> 20:13.800
it's not good ladies and gentlemen because

20:13.800 --> 20:17.800
Malone also says that George Webb's a bad guy right but

20:17.800 --> 20:21.800
but tells you where to find him and Paul Catrell

20:21.800 --> 20:25.800
was streaming many many many times with Kevin McCarron

20:25.800 --> 20:29.800
and you know that we followed Charles Rixie and Kevin McCarron

20:29.800 --> 20:33.800
not too recently or not too long ago

20:33.800 --> 20:37.800
April 26th on this Vay John health conference which occurred on a Saturday

20:37.800 --> 20:41.800
and it was Christine Grace followed by Charles Rixie

20:41.800 --> 20:45.800
and Kevin McCarron

20:45.800 --> 20:49.800
and these were really quite

20:49.800 --> 20:53.800
let's say low level poorly organized talks all three of them

20:53.800 --> 20:57.800
Christine Grace may be very smart and she may have a lot of information

20:57.800 --> 21:01.800
about how lipid nanoparticles work she may have a lot of information

21:01.800 --> 21:05.800
about the kinds of things that they can do when they interact with DNA and RNA

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
she may have a lot of information about the polarity

21:09.800 --> 21:13.800
different particles and how that figures into how they cross membranes and that kind of thing

21:13.800 --> 21:17.800
but the talk that she gave had slides

21:17.800 --> 21:21.800
that had too much gibberish and

21:21.800 --> 21:25.800
readable material on it with not a lot of obvious

21:25.800 --> 21:29.800
messaging and she she skipped a few slides

21:29.800 --> 21:33.800
every once in a while and she talked very nervous and very fast so

21:33.800 --> 21:37.800
wasn't pretty difficult to get much from her talk

21:37.800 --> 21:41.800
then Charles Rixie gave a talk about censorship

21:41.800 --> 21:45.800
and used a bunch of slides you couldn't read or see what they were but you were supposed to

21:45.800 --> 21:49.800
take your word for it that that was his

21:49.800 --> 21:53.800
sub stack or this is a multicolored spreadsheet

21:53.800 --> 21:57.800
with all the papers that he's read and then Kevin McCarron

21:57.800 --> 22:01.800
came on and did a I don't know what

22:01.800 --> 22:05.800
would you call that like if you were a master student giving a

22:05.800 --> 22:09.800
presentation about amyloid that that's the level it would be at

22:09.800 --> 22:13.800
it definitely wasn't at the level of somebody who studies it

22:13.800 --> 22:17.800
or at the level of somebody who's got an idea of the next project he wants to do

22:17.800 --> 22:21.800
or how he's going to do experiments to prove that this is happening

22:21.800 --> 22:25.800
he never once really made the argument about why

22:25.800 --> 22:29.800
this particular virus as opposed to any other virus with a fusion protein

22:29.800 --> 22:33.800
or any other transfection of any other fusion

22:33.800 --> 22:37.800
protein would be any less toxic than this one

22:37.800 --> 22:41.800
he never made an argument about why the

22:41.800 --> 22:45.800
the virus would be particularly dangerous and the

22:45.800 --> 22:49.800
transfection would be particularly dangerous or which one would be more dangerous

22:49.800 --> 22:53.800
when I'm clearly arguing that the transfection is much more dangerous

22:53.800 --> 22:57.800
than whatever is floating around as the virus even if it's an

22:57.800 --> 23:01.800
infectious clone and that's what I've been trying to argue from the beginning

23:01.800 --> 23:05.800
if you're unlucky enough to be sprayed with an infectious clone

23:05.800 --> 23:09.800
or made to inhale an infectious clone then things bad things will probably happen

23:09.800 --> 23:13.800
but if you transfect yourself with a

23:13.800 --> 23:17.800
foreign protein most assuredly you're playing the same game if not

23:17.800 --> 23:21.800
much much worse with many many many more tissue in

23:21.800 --> 23:25.800
your body than just the mucosal of your lungs

23:25.800 --> 23:29.800
and gut and so we're in a big trouble here

23:29.800 --> 23:33.800
because interestingly enough these stars

23:33.800 --> 23:37.800
have all crossed again and this illusion of consensus

23:37.800 --> 23:41.800
seems to have really really strong connections between

23:41.800 --> 23:45.800
all of these pieces the

23:45.800 --> 23:49.800
laying down of this worst case scenario

23:49.800 --> 23:53.800
which was done by people like Paul Catrell

23:53.800 --> 23:57.800
people like George Webb people like Kevin

23:57.800 --> 24:01.800
care people like Charles Ricksey people like all

24:01.800 --> 24:05.800
the people in drastic like me there were screaming very early on

24:05.800 --> 24:09.800
that this could be a lab leak and unable

24:09.800 --> 24:13.800
to get the message out that that doesn't mean it's danger as it just means that it's probably more likely

24:13.800 --> 24:17.800
a man-made thing than it ever is something coming out of a bat cave

24:17.800 --> 24:21.800
the worst case scenario a billion

24:21.800 --> 24:25.800
people going to die was something that needed to be seeded

24:25.800 --> 24:29.800
it had to be something that was whispered in every water cooler

24:29.800 --> 24:33.800
it was whispered at every coffee room

24:33.800 --> 24:37.800
it was talked about on every talk show

24:37.800 --> 24:41.800
behind the scenes and that's what this is about now

24:41.800 --> 24:45.800
to give you this continued illusion that everything's okay

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
that it all worked out people on the TV say look they gave them the Nobel Prize

24:49.800 --> 24:52.800
you can even point to it for a judge

24:52.800 --> 24:56.800
Pfizer's guilty of nothing you know because I mean we just used the Nobel Prize

24:56.800 --> 25:00.800
winning technique I mean what could we have possibly done wrong

25:00.800 --> 25:04.800
so curiously enough today

25:04.800 --> 25:08.800
at six o'clock UK time which was around

25:08.800 --> 25:12.800
one o'clock our time someone sent me a link

25:12.800 --> 25:16.800
thanks Cara of reflections on the Nobel Prize

25:16.800 --> 25:20.800
from the mRNA originator

25:20.800 --> 25:24.800
the mRNA originator

25:24.800 --> 25:28.800
and who is he talking with Dr. Philip

25:28.800 --> 25:32.800
Macmillan where do we recognize Dr. Philip

25:32.800 --> 25:36.800
Macmillan and Vay John Health from well we recognize them of course

25:36.800 --> 25:40.800
from the Vay John Health Conference just a month ago

25:40.800 --> 25:44.800
August 26th

25:44.800 --> 25:48.800
where he hosted

25:48.800 --> 25:52.800
Kevin McCarron and Charles Ricksey

25:52.800 --> 25:56.800
the people that are connected to George Webb

25:56.800 --> 26:00.800
via Paul Cottrell

26:00.800 --> 26:04.800
people that Robert Malone has streamed

26:04.800 --> 26:08.800
with like Paul Cottrell and

26:08.800 --> 26:12.800
incidentally you're going to hear in this interview that

26:12.800 --> 26:16.800
Robert Malone came first time on Dr. Philip

26:16.800 --> 26:20.800
Macmillan's Vay John Health stream in June

26:20.800 --> 26:24.800
of 2021

26:24.800 --> 26:28.800
the same month that he made his debut

26:28.800 --> 26:32.800
on Brett Weinstein I just can't believe

26:32.800 --> 26:36.800
that this happened today and more importantly I can't believe

26:36.800 --> 26:40.800
the kinds of things that he says unfortunately it's already

26:40.800 --> 26:44.800
950 so it looks like I'm going to be up a little later

26:44.800 --> 26:48.800
than I wanted to be up on this Saturday but I am going to be up because it is

26:48.800 --> 26:52.800
a video that needs to be wrestled with

26:52.800 --> 26:56.800
it's extraordinary

26:56.800 --> 27:00.800
hello good evening good afternoon to everyone

27:00.800 --> 27:04.800
here thank you for joining me for this really really

27:04.800 --> 27:08.800
fascinating discussion with regards to Robert

27:08.800 --> 27:12.800
Malone no it's important for people to realize

27:12.800 --> 27:16.800
that actually I had the first video

27:16.800 --> 27:20.800
interview with him all the way in June 2021

27:20.800 --> 27:24.800
and at that time it was just purely by chance

27:24.800 --> 27:28.800
that I realized subsequently that he was actually

27:28.800 --> 27:32.800
the inventor the creator of the mRNA

27:32.800 --> 27:36.800
technology that in itself was a fascinating insight for me

27:36.800 --> 27:40.800
and since then I have watched him grow from strength

27:40.800 --> 27:44.800
to strength going across the world and

27:44.800 --> 27:48.800
effectively impacting the scientific perspective

27:48.800 --> 27:52.800
and across the world now today is actually

27:52.800 --> 27:56.800
my birthday and the biggest gift that I've had

27:56.800 --> 28:00.800
is the fact that we have here Robert Malone with me

28:00.800 --> 28:04.800
to discuss ideas about mRNA technology

28:04.800 --> 28:08.800
his history how he felt about the Nobel Prize

28:08.800 --> 28:12.800
and all these issues together should in truth

28:12.800 --> 28:16.800
be a remarkable discussion so the first thing that I'm going to do

28:16.800 --> 28:20.800
is bring Robert in as opposed to just have a quick introduction

28:20.800 --> 28:24.800
hi Robert how are you? Hi Phillip thanks a lot for having me back

28:24.800 --> 28:28.800
it's been a long time and a lot of water in the bridge

28:28.800 --> 28:32.800
absolutely grateful for you asking me to come back onto your broadcast

28:32.800 --> 28:36.800
well yes as I said it's a tremendous honor for me to actually have you

28:36.800 --> 28:40.800
because these days you're literally one of the biggest

28:40.800 --> 28:44.800
voices out there depending on which side of the fence you're on it can be a

28:44.800 --> 28:48.800
bit of a problem but in truth everybody does hear what you say

28:48.800 --> 28:52.800
whether they like it or not so with that in view

28:52.800 --> 28:56.800
can you just give us an introduction of yourself

28:56.800 --> 29:00.800
Robert let us

29:00.800 --> 29:04.800
did you just hear that please tell me you heard that without me

29:04.800 --> 29:08.800
having to reel it back and then I'm going to reel it back and we're all going to enjoy it together like an

29:08.800 --> 29:12.800
extra potato chip that we didn't know we had

29:12.800 --> 29:16.800
it does hear what you say whether they like it

29:16.800 --> 29:20.800
or the biggest voices out there depending on which side

29:20.800 --> 29:24.800
of the fence you're on it can be a bit of a problem but in truth everybody

29:24.800 --> 29:28.800
does hear what you say whether they like it or not

29:28.800 --> 29:32.800
everybody hears what you say

29:32.800 --> 29:36.800
whether they like it or not it doesn't matter what side of the fence you're on

29:36.800 --> 29:40.800
isn't that an interesting phenomenon boy I wish I could get my

29:40.800 --> 29:44.800
message out like that I wish I

29:44.800 --> 29:48.800
I don't know how he does it despite the censorship

29:48.800 --> 29:52.800
on either side of the aisle it doesn't matter what side of the issue

29:52.800 --> 29:56.800
you're on you're gonna hear Robert Malone boy that censorship

29:56.800 --> 30:00.800
is rough huh I mean that's that's an impressive statement

30:00.800 --> 30:04.800
so with that in view

30:04.800 --> 30:08.800
can you just give us an introduction of yourself

30:08.800 --> 30:12.800
Robert let us let us know a little bit more about you and your background

30:12.800 --> 30:16.800
here we go so the

30:16.800 --> 30:20.800
truth of the matter is that I actually live

30:20.800 --> 30:24.800
and enjoy living a simple life I live on a 54 horse farm in Northern Virginia

30:24.800 --> 30:28.800
that I homestead it together with my wife Dr. Joel

30:28.800 --> 30:32.800
Glassville Malone from just being atheists

30:32.800 --> 30:36.800
I was born in Palo Alto California

30:36.800 --> 30:40.800
at the Old Stanford Hospital and grew up in the Central Coast California

30:40.800 --> 30:44.800
moving frequently the son of a

30:44.800 --> 30:48.800
Mills University train or college train teacher

30:48.800 --> 30:52.800
and a Stanford trained electrical engineer who was very

30:52.800 --> 30:56.800
involved in the defense industry and high voltage

30:56.800 --> 31:00.800
systems I landed in

31:00.800 --> 31:04.800
high voltage systems is that like high voltage weapons

31:04.800 --> 31:08.800
I mean what does that mean I he's in the defense

31:08.800 --> 31:12.800
high voltage systems it's just so silly

31:12.800 --> 31:16.800
it's gonna get much worse you're gonna gonna believe the kinds of things that he says

31:16.800 --> 31:20.800
here and as you're listening I want you to try and follow

31:20.800 --> 31:24.800
along and see if you

31:24.800 --> 31:28.800
if you hear that bell what I'm indicating is

31:28.800 --> 31:32.800
I'm saying something that he probably said because

31:32.800 --> 31:36.800
he was made to say it because somebody

31:36.800 --> 31:40.800
brought it out somebody reported on it somebody

31:40.800 --> 31:44.800
said something about it it was never intended to have to be talked about

31:44.800 --> 31:48.800
but this is the updated list this is this

31:48.800 --> 31:52.800
October 7th updated who is

31:52.800 --> 31:56.800
Robert Malone speech and it is spectacular sorry

31:56.800 --> 32:00.800
yeah and in my youth

32:00.800 --> 32:04.800
and pretty much grew up in the Santa Barbara metropolitan area

32:04.800 --> 32:08.800
and then went to university at

32:08.800 --> 32:12.800
Santa Barbara City College, UC Davis

32:12.800 --> 32:16.800
Northwestern University, UC San Diego

32:16.800 --> 32:20.800
in the Salk Institute and

32:20.800 --> 32:24.800
Northwestern and Harvard Medical School for my final fellowship

32:24.800 --> 32:28.800
in global clinical research. I'm trained in pathology

32:28.800 --> 32:32.800
I've also in virology

32:32.800 --> 32:36.800
immunology molecular biology and was very active

32:36.800 --> 32:40.800
as a bench researcher really

32:40.800 --> 32:44.800
beginning about 83 84 kind of cut my teeth with

32:44.800 --> 32:48.800
HIV and mouse mammary tumor virus which is

32:48.800 --> 32:52.800
a retrovirus model of breast cancer in mice and then

32:52.800 --> 32:56.800
through my work in gene transfer first at the

32:56.800 --> 33:00.800
Salk Institute focusing on retroviral vectors then

33:00.800 --> 33:04.800
as a assistant professor at UC Davis I grew a

33:04.800 --> 33:08.800
medium sized non-viral gene

33:08.800 --> 33:12.800
therapy program was recruited to University of Maryland

33:12.800 --> 33:16.800
Baltimore where I had additional discoveries that led to

33:16.800 --> 33:20.800
a whole other field of gene delivery that nobody talks about these days

33:20.800 --> 33:24.800
having to use to do with pulse electrical fields

33:24.800 --> 33:28.800
and the founding of a company called Anovio that's still running in San Diego

33:28.800 --> 33:32.800
using that technology and then

33:32.800 --> 33:36.800
to the uniform services university of the health sciences

33:36.800 --> 33:40.800
where I helped create a breast cancer research program

33:40.800 --> 33:44.800
and issue banking laboratory and research laboratory at Western

33:44.800 --> 33:48.800
Pennsylvania and then joined

33:48.800 --> 33:52.800
a company that had just obtained

33:52.800 --> 33:56.800
the what's called the prime systems contract for

33:56.800 --> 34:00.800
bio-defense products for the Department of Defense called Dimeport vaccine company

34:00.800 --> 34:04.800
up in Frederick, Maryland almost across the street from

34:04.800 --> 34:08.800
Fort Dietrich which is where the United States Army

34:08.800 --> 34:12.800
medical research group is that used to be the bio warfare

34:12.800 --> 34:16.800
group but now is the bio-defense group and at that

34:16.800 --> 34:20.800
in that job in that position I had

34:20.800 --> 34:24.800
experience with virtually all the major

34:24.800 --> 34:28.800
well really end minor vaccines that are in development for

34:28.800 --> 34:32.800
bio-defense for the U.S. Army and defense complex

34:32.800 --> 34:36.800
which is where I was brought into connection with a lot of

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
people that are called you know referred to as deep state

34:40.800 --> 34:44.800
many people who have CIA connections

34:44.800 --> 34:48.800
I'm not CIA I've never been CIA I've never been approached by the CIA to the best of

34:48.800 --> 34:52.800
my knowledge but you can't work in bio-defense and not work with CIA people

34:52.800 --> 34:56.800
I've also worked for Gates funded nonprofit

34:56.800 --> 35:00.800
one of the first called the Harris Global TV Vaccine Foundation

35:00.800 --> 35:04.800
it's defunct now but I know that world pretty well

35:04.800 --> 35:08.800
I've consulted for PATH which is one of the core gates

35:08.800 --> 35:12.800
companies and I've worked for a

35:12.800 --> 35:16.800
for-profit regulatory

35:16.800 --> 35:20.800
fair sweatshop in Rockville supporting

35:20.800 --> 35:24.800
FDA related work I've written many

35:24.800 --> 35:28.800
INDs presented

35:28.800 --> 35:32.800
to the FDA multiple times written many clinical protocols

35:32.800 --> 35:36.800
and managed phase one and two and some phase three

35:36.800 --> 35:40.800
protocols either as a principal investigator

35:40.800 --> 35:44.800
or as a support person like a clinical

35:44.800 --> 35:48.800
investigator or safety committee member

35:48.800 --> 35:52.800
I've was at the tip of the spear

35:52.800 --> 35:56.800
in bringing forward the vaccine candidate from NewLink

35:56.800 --> 36:00.800
originally from public health agency Canada and getting

36:00.800 --> 36:04.800
it sold to a company called Merck that's now the

36:04.800 --> 36:08.800
only licensed Ebola candidate or Ebola vaccine

36:08.800 --> 36:12.800
and have been very

36:12.800 --> 36:16.800
involved in advancing many different bio-defense products

36:16.800 --> 36:20.800
I've kind of been at the forefront of I think five different outbreaks

36:20.800 --> 36:24.800
did a lot of drug repurposing

36:24.800 --> 36:28.800
work with Zika after I determined

36:28.800 --> 36:32.800
that building a Zika vaccine was not going to be very practical

36:32.800 --> 36:36.800
and many influenza vaccines I have deep experience

36:36.800 --> 36:40.800
in influenza and influenza vaccine development

36:40.800 --> 36:44.800
I'm very familiar with the Novavax

36:44.800 --> 36:48.800
platform and worked for a long time for a company that uses

36:48.800 --> 36:52.800
Baccalaureate virus to express proteins in caterpillars

36:52.800 --> 36:56.800
and I've won over my lifetime well over $10 billion

36:56.800 --> 37:00.800
in grants and contracts for a variety of companies

37:00.800 --> 37:04.800
including companies that are

37:04.800 --> 37:08.800
you know very much beltway bandits

37:08.800 --> 37:12.800
basically inside DC defense contractors

37:12.800 --> 37:16.800
I've been granted a secret clearance but my passion

37:16.800 --> 37:20.800
remains in small farming and my 44 year marriage with

37:20.800 --> 37:24.800
my wife Dr. Joe Glaspel Malone where high school sweethearts

37:24.800 --> 37:28.800
and these days we produce Lucetano horses

37:28.800 --> 37:32.800
here in our farm in Virginia up against the Shenandoah Mountains

37:32.800 --> 37:36.800
so there's a kind of a broad brush stroke

37:36.800 --> 37:40.800
of who I am and what I do excellent listen I think

37:40.800 --> 37:42.800
as I listen to you there I remember

37:42.800 --> 37:46.800
holy cow that was crazy

37:46.800 --> 37:50.800
so let me just see

37:50.800 --> 37:54.800
let me just see if we can do this here

37:54.800 --> 37:58.800
so he did mouse tumor virus

37:58.800 --> 38:02.800
he called himself

38:02.800 --> 38:06.800
he's trained in pathology, virology, immunology, megalactic and molecular biology

38:06.800 --> 38:10.800
cut his teeth in mouse tumor viruses which was a mouse

38:10.800 --> 38:14.800
model for breast cancer then he did retroviral vectors

38:14.800 --> 38:18.800
when he speaks of vectors he's talking about using them to carry DNA

38:18.800 --> 38:22.800
they're talking about transforming things then

38:22.800 --> 38:26.800
so like transfection would be with our mRNA but then with DNA

38:26.800 --> 38:30.800
UC Davis, University of Baltimore

38:30.800 --> 38:34.800
I missed a lot of stuff in there because there was also

38:34.800 --> 38:38.800
the part about windber and the breast cancer institute that had

38:38.800 --> 38:42.800
the really high speed internet pipeline and had access

38:42.800 --> 38:46.800
to all of the military cancer data

38:46.800 --> 38:50.800
and he put the husband

38:50.800 --> 38:54.800
of a postdoc that he had and as a director of

38:54.800 --> 38:58.800
that institute that's a married couple from Nigeria

38:58.800 --> 39:02.800
it's just all very strange

39:02.800 --> 39:06.800
kind of happening there and then that put him in real close proximity to where

39:06.800 --> 39:10.800
the plane went down in 2001 so that's

39:10.800 --> 39:14.800
a little strange he's worked for the Gates Foundation and he's worked for a company

39:14.800 --> 39:18.800
called PAF which was one of the primary guest companies in the Gates Foundation

39:18.800 --> 39:22.800
or funded by them he also worked for a regulatory

39:22.800 --> 39:26.800
affairs sweatshop which I don't really know what that is

39:26.800 --> 39:30.800
he worked with some phase one two and some three trials

39:30.800 --> 39:34.800
he was tip of the spear of the Ebola vaccine where he brokered the sale

39:34.800 --> 39:38.800
of the Ebola vaccine candidate from a company called Newlink in Canada

39:38.800 --> 39:42.800
to Merck. He was involved in a

39:42.800 --> 39:46.800
under a lot of biodefense products I apologize you can't read that

39:46.800 --> 39:51.800
drug repurposing for Zika influenza vaccine development

39:51.800 --> 39:54.800
baculovirus and caterpillars

39:54.800 --> 39:58.800
and he's got what is this

39:58.800 --> 40:02.800
he got 10 billion I thought it was like

40:02.800 --> 40:06.800
2 billion now he says it's 10 billion for

40:06.800 --> 40:10.800
beltway banded companies so he sounds like a really great guy

40:10.800 --> 40:14.800
but really right now he's into his 44 year

40:14.800 --> 40:18.800
marriage with his college or his high school sweetheart

40:18.800 --> 40:22.800
and raising Lucetano horses so

40:22.800 --> 40:26.800
holy crap that's interesting I would say

40:26.800 --> 40:30.800
there's quite a bit in that narrative that wouldn't be there

40:30.800 --> 40:34.800
hadn't been for the work of some of the people that you

40:34.800 --> 40:38.800
follow some of the people that we trust

40:38.800 --> 40:42.800
so thanks to all those people especially Mark Gulag

40:45.800 --> 40:49.800
well the first time that I had an interview with Gert

40:49.800 --> 40:53.800
and he went through his background and I thought oh my goodness

40:53.800 --> 40:56.800
no wonder it is a worry

40:56.800 --> 41:00.800
when you say something that is counter to the narrative

41:00.800 --> 41:03.800
and we're going to be coming into that in a moment

41:03.800 --> 41:07.800
but I think it's very important to start with

41:07.800 --> 41:11.800
that question of mRNA technology

41:11.800 --> 41:16.800
now in all of the background that you have listed

41:16.800 --> 41:19.800
I don't hear a lot about

41:19.800 --> 41:23.800
the work or that original work with

41:23.800 --> 41:27.800
mRNA why did you not continue

41:27.800 --> 41:31.800
after you had that experience of the breakthrough

41:31.800 --> 41:35.800
in thinking so you would have been at that cutting edge

41:35.800 --> 41:39.800
as you said in Salk Institute you had that moment where you

41:39.800 --> 41:44.800
envisioned it why did it not continue

41:44.800 --> 41:49.800
well not only envisioned it but I left the Salk

41:49.800 --> 41:53.800
because of the politics that were going on over the patents

41:53.800 --> 41:57.800
with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder

41:57.800 --> 42:02.800
my mentor is now out

42:02.800 --> 42:06.800
and basically is being a very abusive person

42:06.800 --> 42:11.800
but I continued that work at a small startup

42:11.800 --> 42:15.800
across the street called Vaikal and it's at Vaikal

42:15.800 --> 42:18.800
that we had the additional discovery of naked DNA

42:18.800 --> 42:21.800
and RNA delivery into mouse muscle

42:21.800 --> 42:23.800
and the reduction of practice of all of this

42:23.800 --> 42:26.800
for the purpose of vaccination

42:26.800 --> 42:30.800
so we demonstrated there that you could inoculate

42:30.800 --> 42:34.800
mice with the messenger RNA that I had synthesized

42:34.800 --> 42:39.800
and caused them to mount an immune response against the encoded protein

42:39.800 --> 42:43.800
and so is that where the patents come from

42:43.800 --> 42:46.800
because yeah looking behind you

42:46.800 --> 42:49.800
there was a number of patent filed

42:49.800 --> 42:54.800
so the original patent disclosure was made at the Salk in 1987 or 88

42:54.800 --> 42:58.800
and then a patent was filed from the Salk

42:58.800 --> 43:02.800
and I never got a straight answer

43:02.800 --> 43:05.800
when I left the Salk it was still pending

43:05.800 --> 43:08.800
they had first determined that I was a sole inventor

43:08.800 --> 43:11.800
and then they put my mentor on it

43:11.800 --> 43:14.800
and then I left and went to Vaikal

43:14.800 --> 43:17.800
and I asked the Salk a few years later

43:17.800 --> 43:20.800
what happened to that patent because they're supposed to just

43:20.800 --> 43:24.800
they're supposed to notify the inventors of any actions they take under

43:24.800 --> 43:27.800
the Baidole Act in the United States

43:27.800 --> 43:30.800
and they had unilaterally decided to abandon the patent

43:30.800 --> 43:33.800
at the time when my mentor, Interverma,

43:33.800 --> 43:37.800
had been a consultant to the company Vaikal

43:37.800 --> 43:40.800
so the Salk patent would have interfered with the Vaikal patents

43:40.800 --> 43:42.800
and it was dropped

43:42.800 --> 43:44.800
Can I just ask the chat?

43:44.800 --> 43:48.800
Did they flash to the second camera yet?

43:48.800 --> 43:51.800
Is that why you're saying why did he put patents on the wall

43:51.800 --> 43:53.800
or did they flash to a second camera yet?

43:53.800 --> 43:55.800
Yes or no?

43:55.800 --> 43:59.800
Anybody in the chat did because there's a second camera coming up soon

44:00.800 --> 44:04.800
and then the Vaikal patents there was nine of them

44:04.800 --> 44:06.800
that came out of their original filings

44:06.800 --> 44:07.800
Watch your cover

44:07.800 --> 44:09.800
kind of 1990-1991

44:09.800 --> 44:10.800
He's going to trigger it himself

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
They issued

44:11.800 --> 44:15.800
and then we had, Jill and I had a subsequent patent

44:15.800 --> 44:17.800
actually multiple patents

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
you know that's

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
as shown behind me

44:21.800 --> 44:22.800
Nice

44:22.800 --> 44:25.800
and they cover the formulations

44:26.800 --> 44:29.800
You see he's got a button he triggers it with

44:29.800 --> 44:31.800
he's got to look down to see which button he pushes

44:31.800 --> 44:32.800
on his little streamer thing

44:32.800 --> 44:35.800
so he can get that patent wall side shot

44:35.800 --> 44:39.800
That was brilliant

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
Okay, so one was

44:41.800 --> 44:43.800
purchased by the army

44:43.800 --> 44:45.800
use of various

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
candidate lipids

44:46.800 --> 44:49.800
we were the first ones to put cholesterol into the formulations

44:49.800 --> 44:52.800
we came up with solutions to the endotoxin problem

44:52.800 --> 44:53.800
et cetera et cetera

44:54.800 --> 44:56.800
but we were way ahead of our time

44:56.800 --> 44:59.800
and Vaikal when I left

44:59.800 --> 45:03.800
I had signed an employment agreement

45:03.800 --> 45:05.800
that among other things

45:05.800 --> 45:08.800
resulted in my getting compensated for the patents

45:08.800 --> 45:10.800
with one US dollar

45:10.800 --> 45:14.800
but I also

45:14.800 --> 45:17.800
signed away any rights to work in that field

45:17.800 --> 45:18.800
subsequently

45:18.800 --> 45:21.800
and at one point I got a

45:21.800 --> 45:25.800
cease and desist letter from the CEO of Vaikal

45:25.800 --> 45:28.800
BJ Simone who used to be at Merck

45:28.800 --> 45:31.800
that I should not do any research

45:31.800 --> 45:33.800
as an academic

45:33.800 --> 45:35.800
directly relating to what I had done

45:35.800 --> 45:37.800
when I was at Vaikal

45:37.800 --> 45:38.800
so

45:38.800 --> 45:41.800
Vaikal was very aggressive about the intellectual property

45:41.800 --> 45:43.800
they sold it to Merck

45:43.800 --> 45:45.800
Merck tried to make DNA vaccines work

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
they thought RNA wasn't going to be

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
feasible to manufacture

45:49.800 --> 45:51.800
they failed

45:51.800 --> 45:53.800
they spent over two billion

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
they turned the IP back to

45:55.800 --> 45:57.800
to Vaikal

45:57.800 --> 45:59.800
and Vaikal burned about a billion

45:59.800 --> 46:01.800
or a billion and a half

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
and they failed

46:03.800 --> 46:05.800
but what they did do through that whole time

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
is very aggressively block anybody

46:07.800 --> 46:09.800
that would work on DNA

46:09.800 --> 46:11.800
or RNA vaccines

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
until the patents expired

46:13.800 --> 46:15.800
and then after the patents expired

46:15.800 --> 46:17.800
the market cap for Vaikal

46:17.800 --> 46:19.800
basically crashed

46:19.800 --> 46:21.800
and the company

46:21.800 --> 46:23.800
was basically merged

46:23.800 --> 46:25.800
for less than cash value

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
so it's

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
I don't think the patents

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
expired in 2001 though

46:31.800 --> 46:33.800
and I think Mark has shown

46:33.800 --> 46:35.800
that

46:35.800 --> 46:37.800
the patent or rather the stock

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
of Vaikal crashed or ended

46:39.800 --> 46:41.800
pretty much in September or October

46:41.800 --> 46:43.800
of 2001 right?

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
isn't that right?

46:45.800 --> 46:47.800
so that's weird

46:47.800 --> 46:49.800
yeah the line glows

46:49.800 --> 46:51.800
that's for sure

46:51.800 --> 46:53.800
not where you then start

46:53.800 --> 46:55.800
to speak about your work

46:55.800 --> 46:57.800
because before that you

46:57.800 --> 46:59.800
couldn't I really couldn't

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
yeah well no at that point

47:01.800 --> 47:03.800
in all this work that we did

47:03.800 --> 47:05.800
mostly at UC Davis

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
with the different positively charged

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
fats and the pharmacology

47:09.800 --> 47:11.800
and biology and mechanism

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
of action work

47:13.800 --> 47:17.800
we had done a lot of work

47:17.800 --> 47:19.800
on trying to develop gene therapy

47:19.800 --> 47:21.800
for cystic fibrosis

47:21.800 --> 47:25.800
involving pulmonary

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
or intratricular inoculation

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
of these formulations in mice

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
and in monkeys in non-human

47:31.800 --> 47:33.800
primates

47:33.800 --> 47:35.800
and also the basics

47:35.800 --> 47:37.800
of delivery and equipment

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
but he said that the patents

47:39.800 --> 47:41.800
expired and Vaikal

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
prevented anybody from using the

47:43.800 --> 47:45.800
mRNA technology until the

47:45.800 --> 47:47.800
patents expired and then in the

47:47.800 --> 47:49.800
patents expired

47:49.800 --> 47:51.800
their stock crashed

47:51.800 --> 47:53.800
but I don't think the patents

47:53.800 --> 47:55.800
that he had would have expired in

47:55.800 --> 47:57.800
2001 correct me if I'm wrong

47:57.800 --> 47:59.800
someone in the chat

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
that's weird

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
putting jet injection and post-electural

48:03.800 --> 48:05.800
field we were starting with some

48:05.800 --> 48:07.800
in gold particle delivery

48:07.800 --> 48:09.800
which is another technology in this mix

48:09.800 --> 48:11.800
that is gone by the wayside

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
and with the

48:13.800 --> 48:15.800
positively charged fat formulations

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
we could never overcome the toxicity

48:17.800 --> 48:19.800
they're highly highly inflammatory

48:19.800 --> 48:23.800
and so we moved on to other

48:23.800 --> 48:25.800
delivery technologies that were more

48:25.800 --> 48:27.800
efficient including post-electrical

48:27.800 --> 48:29.800
fields that didn't have the

48:29.800 --> 48:31.800
toxicity

48:31.800 --> 48:33.800
and primarily focused on the DNA

48:33.800 --> 48:35.800
delivery not the RNA although we

48:35.800 --> 48:37.800
did get a very broad patent

48:37.800 --> 48:39.800
on mucosal vaccines

48:39.800 --> 48:41.800
that covered virtually any gene therapy

48:41.800 --> 48:45.800
vector

48:45.800 --> 48:47.800
but I couldn't get any of that funded

48:47.800 --> 48:49.800
I got recruited to

48:49.800 --> 48:51.800
Umariland

48:51.800 --> 48:53.800
and we did the electroporation work

48:53.800 --> 48:55.800
and I wrote what I think was

48:55.800 --> 48:57.800
probably one of my best

48:57.800 --> 48:59.800
personal proposals ever

48:59.800 --> 49:01.800
and it went into

49:01.800 --> 49:03.800
the NIH for review and it was

49:03.800 --> 49:05.800
rejected based on

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
the fat. So he said this a

49:07.800 --> 49:09.800
couple times and it's just dawned

49:09.800 --> 49:11.800
on me

49:11.800 --> 49:13.800
listen

49:13.800 --> 49:15.800
any of that funded

49:15.800 --> 49:17.800
you know

49:17.800 --> 49:19.800
it covered virtually any

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
gene therapy very broad patent

49:21.800 --> 49:23.800
just on the DNA delivery

49:23.800 --> 49:25.800
not the RNA already did get

49:25.800 --> 49:27.800
a very broad patent on mucosal

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
vaccines that covered virtually

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
any gene therapy vector

49:31.800 --> 49:33.800
just on the DNA delivery

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
not the RNA although we did get a

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
very broad patent on

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
mucosal vaccines that covered

49:39.800 --> 49:41.800
virtually any gene therapy

49:41.800 --> 49:43.800
vector. I want you to think about

49:43.800 --> 49:45.800
this video that I've seen on

49:45.800 --> 49:49.800
the internet for a second

49:49.800 --> 49:51.800
I've seen this video on the internet

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
about patent trolls

49:53.800 --> 49:55.800
and patent trolls are these people

49:55.800 --> 49:57.800
that have a patent

49:57.800 --> 49:59.800
that seems to apply to a broad

49:59.800 --> 50:01.800
you know like I don't know

50:01.800 --> 50:03.800
one of the kinds of patent trolls

50:03.800 --> 50:05.800
that I understand

50:05.800 --> 50:07.800
that's out there is somebody

50:07.800 --> 50:09.800
has a patent

50:09.800 --> 50:11.800
on website

50:11.800 --> 50:13.800
reviews,

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
website product reviews

50:15.800 --> 50:17.800
on a website

50:17.800 --> 50:19.800
and so they go around

50:19.800 --> 50:21.800
suing medium to small sized

50:21.800 --> 50:23.800
web based

50:23.800 --> 50:25.800
businesses

50:25.800 --> 50:27.800
that have reviews on their website

50:27.800 --> 50:29.800
and sue them for

50:29.800 --> 50:31.800
patent infringement

50:31.800 --> 50:33.800
and this is called

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
patent trolling

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
and it only happens in certain

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
jurisdictions in America

50:39.800 --> 50:41.800
but it's a real thing

50:41.800 --> 50:43.800
now what Robert Malone just said

50:43.800 --> 50:45.800
there

50:45.800 --> 50:47.800
is

50:47.800 --> 50:49.800
what he said there

50:49.800 --> 50:51.800
is

50:51.800 --> 50:53.800
that he had a broad patent

50:53.800 --> 50:57.800
on mucosal genetic vaccines

50:57.800 --> 50:59.800
can you imagine the possibility

50:59.800 --> 51:01.800
that if this patent

51:01.800 --> 51:03.800
exists right now

51:03.800 --> 51:05.800
that he could potentially

51:05.800 --> 51:07.800
patent troll

51:07.800 --> 51:09.800
any company

51:09.800 --> 51:11.800
that violates his patent

51:11.800 --> 51:15.800
and especially now that he's

51:15.800 --> 51:17.800
motivated by

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
this PTSD

51:19.800 --> 51:21.800
that he got diagnosed with

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
as a result of

51:23.800 --> 51:25.800
his interaction with this VICO company

51:25.800 --> 51:27.800
and his terribly abusive

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800
ender verma

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
whose career also seems to have

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
been kind of ruined by these patents

51:33.800 --> 51:35.800
one of which was purchased by

51:35.800 --> 51:37.800
the army. He casually

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
mentions the endotoxin problem

51:39.800 --> 51:41.800
which is also a new

51:41.800 --> 51:43.800
game piece on the board along with

51:43.800 --> 51:45.800
the DNA

51:45.800 --> 51:47.800
and the endotoxin problem was

51:47.800 --> 51:49.800
especially just added

51:49.800 --> 51:51.800
to the game board

51:51.800 --> 51:53.800
by another than Josh

51:53.800 --> 51:55.800
Getsko, a guy who's been

51:55.800 --> 51:57.800
on my program before

51:57.800 --> 51:59.800
and who was on John Campbell's

51:59.800 --> 52:01.800
stream on YouTube a couple of days ago

52:01.800 --> 52:03.800
talking about the DNA

52:03.800 --> 52:05.800
contamination but also

52:05.800 --> 52:07.800
the endotoxin, the cell wall

52:07.800 --> 52:09.800
of the bacteria that's used

52:09.800 --> 52:11.800
to generate the DNA that

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
generates the RNA

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
VICO sold patents to Merck,

52:15.800 --> 52:17.800
sold them back to VICO,

52:17.800 --> 52:19.800
then we have this incongruency between

52:19.800 --> 52:21.800
when those patents expired and when

52:21.800 --> 52:23.800
VICO's stock crashed in

52:23.800 --> 52:25.800
2021 or

52:25.800 --> 52:27.800
2001.

52:27.800 --> 52:29.800
He mentions pulse electric

52:29.800 --> 52:31.800
fields twice. He also talks about

52:31.800 --> 52:33.800
gold particles. We've talked about all of

52:33.800 --> 52:35.800
those as ways to

52:35.800 --> 52:37.800
transfect and to transform

52:37.800 --> 52:39.800
animals and tissues and cell

52:39.800 --> 52:41.800
cultures and we've

52:41.800 --> 52:43.800
stated over and over again that you

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
were depending on whether you use

52:45.800 --> 52:47.800
mRNA or DNA you would call it

52:47.800 --> 52:49.800
transfection or

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
transfection respectively.

52:51.800 --> 52:53.800
DNA versus RNA decided

52:53.800 --> 52:55.800
to stick with DNA

52:55.800 --> 52:57.800
and pulse electric fields so that

52:57.800 --> 52:59.800
he mentions again

52:59.800 --> 53:01.800
remember this is key

53:01.800 --> 53:03.800
that we were granted a broad

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
patent on mucosal genetic

53:05.800 --> 53:07.800
vaccines and that's very

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
interesting because going

53:09.800 --> 53:11.800
forward there's going to be a lot of

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
those because as I've

53:13.800 --> 53:15.800
stated at the beginning we are

53:15.800 --> 53:17.800
going to transition away from

53:17.800 --> 53:19.800
vascular injection because we are going

53:19.800 --> 53:21.800
to come to the realization in the coming

53:21.800 --> 53:23.800
years I guarantee it

53:23.800 --> 53:25.800
that rejecting

53:25.800 --> 53:27.800
the American

53:27.800 --> 53:29.800
way too early

53:29.800 --> 53:31.800
way too aggressive

53:31.800 --> 53:33.800
way too often

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
way too many targets

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
immunization schedule

53:37.800 --> 53:39.800
was the right idea

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
and it could be that

53:41.800 --> 53:43.800
20 years from now there are a couple

53:43.800 --> 53:45.800
vaccines that are accepted as

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
as

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
a subcutaneous

53:49.800 --> 53:51.800
vaccines that can work

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
there could be some that you take

53:53.800 --> 53:55.800
orally but we're going to be getting

53:55.800 --> 53:57.800
rid of most are all

53:57.800 --> 53:59.800
intramuscular vaccines I am

53:59.800 --> 54:01.800
sure of it because we are

54:01.800 --> 54:03.800
we are just not augmenting the

54:03.800 --> 54:05.800
immune system the way that we think we

54:05.800 --> 54:07.800
are and it's curious if he's

54:07.800 --> 54:09.800
positioning himself

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
as a patent troll just letting

54:11.800 --> 54:13.800
everybody know

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
every time I go out on one of these

54:15.800 --> 54:17.800
little podcasts I'm just going to drop

54:17.800 --> 54:19.800
that there you know that whole wall

54:19.800 --> 54:21.800
of patents back there some of them still

54:21.800 --> 54:23.800
exist one of them

54:23.800 --> 54:25.800
is for a very broad patent

54:25.800 --> 54:27.800
on mucosal

54:27.800 --> 54:29.800
genetic base back scenes

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
that's pretty impressive

54:35.800 --> 54:37.800
but

54:37.800 --> 54:39.800
I couldn't get any of that funded

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
I got recruited to

54:41.800 --> 54:43.800
U Maryland

54:43.800 --> 54:45.800
and we did the

54:45.800 --> 54:47.800
electroporation work and I wrote

54:47.800 --> 54:49.800
what I think was probably one of my

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
best personal proposals ever

54:51.800 --> 54:53.800
and it went into

54:53.800 --> 54:55.800
the NIH for review and it was

54:55.800 --> 54:57.800
rejected based on

54:57.800 --> 54:59.800
the fact

54:59.800 --> 55:01.800
quote-unquote that Merck had already

55:01.800 --> 55:03.800
solved the delivery problem which

55:03.800 --> 55:05.800
of course they hadn't but

55:05.800 --> 55:07.800
this is the way things are and when

55:07.800 --> 55:09.800
you're a soft money

55:09.800 --> 55:11.800
young investigator

55:11.800 --> 55:13.800
you you don't have

55:13.800 --> 55:15.800
too many times it back

55:15.800 --> 55:17.800
that doesn't really sound like a

55:17.800 --> 55:19.800
jiving story to me and I'm

55:19.800 --> 55:21.800
going to tell you why

55:21.800 --> 55:23.800
because I don't think

55:23.800 --> 55:25.800
the NIH would

55:25.800 --> 55:27.800
solve the delivery problem which

55:27.800 --> 55:29.800
of course they hadn't

55:29.800 --> 55:31.800
but this is the way things are

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
and when you're a soft money

55:33.800 --> 55:35.800
young investigator

55:35.800 --> 55:37.800
you don't have too many

55:37.800 --> 55:39.800
questions about why because I don't

55:39.800 --> 55:41.800
think the NIH would cite

55:41.800 --> 55:43.800
Merck as a reason

55:43.800 --> 55:45.800
why you would reject someone's

55:45.800 --> 55:47.800
proposal

55:47.800 --> 55:49.800
unless Merck published it in a

55:49.800 --> 55:51.800
nature article or unless Merck

55:51.800 --> 55:53.800
published it in a journal

55:53.800 --> 55:55.800
like you wouldn't just say no

55:55.800 --> 55:57.800
Merck's already solved that

55:57.800 --> 55:59.800
that's not how grants get

55:59.800 --> 56:01.800
rejected

56:01.800 --> 56:03.800
and a pharmaceutical company would

56:03.800 --> 56:05.800
be a very odd

56:05.800 --> 56:07.800
use as a rejection

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
as a basis for rejection

56:09.800 --> 56:11.800
and in fact I would think

56:11.800 --> 56:13.800
it would be pretty easy to file

56:13.800 --> 56:15.800
an appeal in that scenario

56:15.800 --> 56:17.800
it smells

56:17.800 --> 56:19.800
fishy to me

56:19.800 --> 56:21.800
it's just another way of making

56:21.800 --> 56:23.800
him seem like he's like the victim

56:23.800 --> 56:25.800
and he's been

56:25.800 --> 56:27.800
fighting big pharma for a long time

56:27.800 --> 56:29.800
or something like that and I don't

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
think that at all

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
I think he's been trying to

56:33.800 --> 56:35.800
catch on to the freight train

56:35.800 --> 56:37.800
of money that is

56:37.800 --> 56:39.800
the speeding

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
global pharmaceutical industry

56:41.800 --> 56:43.800
and occasionally when you try to grab onto a moving

56:43.800 --> 56:45.800
freight train you can get hurt

56:45.800 --> 56:47.800
or it doesn't work out the way you think

56:47.800 --> 56:49.800
or when you jump off

56:49.800 --> 56:51.800
you know it's not perfect you land somewhere

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
you didn't mean to land but I mean come on

56:53.800 --> 56:55.800
let's be real here

56:55.800 --> 56:57.800
I guess cricket

56:57.800 --> 56:59.800
would have to be the metaphor for you

56:59.800 --> 57:01.800
for me it's baseball

57:01.800 --> 57:03.800
but you know if you don't hit it out of the park

57:03.800 --> 57:05.800
as a

57:05.800 --> 57:07.800
soft money investigator

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
you're out

57:09.800 --> 57:11.800
that's true

57:11.800 --> 57:13.800
that's true I think that's true now too

57:13.800 --> 57:15.800
I mean young investigators

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
especially

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
young white

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
male investigators

57:21.800 --> 57:23.800
really really really need to

57:23.800 --> 57:25.800
hit it out of the park

57:25.800 --> 57:27.800
or you can be assured that

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
the last job you're going to have

57:29.800 --> 57:31.800
in academic biology is going to be your postdoc

57:31.800 --> 57:33.800
I mean there are

57:33.800 --> 57:35.800
no positions for

57:35.800 --> 57:37.800
for people

57:37.800 --> 57:39.800
of unrepressed

57:39.800 --> 57:41.800
backgrounds

57:41.800 --> 57:43.800
it's just gotten out of control

57:43.800 --> 57:45.800
the content of your work

57:45.800 --> 57:47.800
the content of your character

57:47.800 --> 57:49.800
your work ethic

57:49.800 --> 57:51.800
it doesn't matter at all

57:51.800 --> 57:53.800
it's all secondary to your

57:53.800 --> 57:55.800
perceived station in the hierarchy

57:55.800 --> 57:57.800
it's pretty scary

57:57.800 --> 57:59.800
and I had a wife that

57:59.800 --> 58:01.800
but I doubt he experienced that

58:01.800 --> 58:03.800
when he was in academia

58:03.800 --> 58:05.800
thank you very much

58:05.800 --> 58:07.800
sorry if I was implying

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
that any of those current

58:09.800 --> 58:11.800
issues

58:11.800 --> 58:13.800
were in existence at the time

58:13.800 --> 58:15.800
when he was hopping around from

58:15.800 --> 58:17.800
retroviral lab to retroviral lab

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
where people were stealing

58:19.800 --> 58:21.800
retroviruses from france

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
and bringing them back and

58:23.800 --> 58:25.800
claiming that they had cured them

58:25.800 --> 58:27.800
they were running around

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
this

58:29.800 --> 58:31.800
writing grants about how

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
retroviruses were going to be curing cancer in 10 years

58:33.800 --> 58:35.800
come on

58:35.800 --> 58:37.800
a child

58:37.800 --> 58:39.800
two children at that point in time

58:39.800 --> 58:41.800
and

58:41.800 --> 58:43.800
I really I couldn't tolerate

58:43.800 --> 58:45.800
that

58:45.800 --> 58:47.800
the environment

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
of modern academe for

58:49.800 --> 58:51.800
a soft money funded

58:51.800 --> 58:53.800
investigator

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
and this is why I

58:55.800 --> 58:57.800
went to industry

58:57.800 --> 58:59.800
again and then to government

58:59.800 --> 59:01.800
contractor

59:01.800 --> 59:03.800
so let me ask you then

59:03.800 --> 59:05.800
so from a personal point of view

59:05.800 --> 59:07.800
you had to almost

59:07.800 --> 59:09.800
so he was forced to go work for

59:09.800 --> 59:11.800
government contractors

59:11.800 --> 59:13.800
he was forced to go work

59:13.800 --> 59:15.800
for DITRA and DOD

59:15.800 --> 59:17.800
because academia is just so

59:17.800 --> 59:19.800
harsh

59:19.800 --> 59:21.800
I mean he's not going to give

59:21.800 --> 59:23.800
any credit to anybody that does make

59:23.800 --> 59:25.800
it in academia you know like

59:25.800 --> 59:27.800
J about a chariot or something like that

59:27.800 --> 59:29.800
like those guys aren't great

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
or I admire everybody who made

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
tenure nothing like that

59:33.800 --> 59:35.800
he got

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
the raw end of the deal he got

59:37.800 --> 59:39.800
PTSD he was treated terribly

59:39.800 --> 59:41.800
they stole his ideas he got the

59:41.800 --> 59:43.800
short end of the stick

59:45.800 --> 59:47.800
woke away from

59:47.800 --> 59:49.800
your baby

59:49.800 --> 59:51.800
I was

59:51.800 --> 59:53.800
I was

59:53.800 --> 59:55.800
I was

59:55.800 --> 59:57.800
one of the lead

59:57.800 --> 59:59.800
individuals speaking to the press

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.800
about what I knew concerning the

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.800
death of Jesse Gelsinger

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.800
at the hands of Jim Wilson

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.800
and you pen

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.800
from overdosing going off

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.800
protocol with

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.800
adenovirus.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:33.800
and

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.800
I'm afraid that

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800
I don't think he would have set a

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.800
dang word about this

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.800
had somebody not founded

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.500
already known about it. And we not already talked about it lots of times. I don't think

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:55.840
he would have said a word about this. Because I don't think his, I don't think his I say

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:03.120
it again. I do not think that his career was ruined. He claimed in an earlier interview

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.680
that he made the career of the New York Times reporter that covered this story and quoted

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:18.840
him. And again, if he's suffering, if he's losing his career, then what happened to him?

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:27.120
Did he go off to the farm? No. He went and got another job at a government funded health

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:34.920
university setting up a breast cancer institute and handing it off to a Nigerian couple who's

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:41.840
the woman of which was a postdoc of his. It doesn't sound like it really cramped his

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.640
style at all. He was just moved up the ladder.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:59.240
I knew what basically what happened there was I was taking training in bioethics from

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.880
a prominent bioethicist. We heard this story before him and his wife were taking a bioethics

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:14.320
course and that he really admired this bioethicist. Mr. E. Maryland, as was my wife. And I went to

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.000
him and said, this has happened and I know these things about this. They're not being discussed.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.640
They're not available in the press. And he told me he thought I had a moral obligation to go to

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:31.520
the press and share what I knew. And so I did it knowing that it would probably destroy my

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:39.880
academic career. And it did. But I was able to recover, survive. I got the appointment at the

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:47.440
Uniform Services University Health Sciences and was able to kind of rebuild a whole new career.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:59.400
But yeah, I made a conscious choice there to speak out about things that I thought were unethical.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:11.720
And you could also say that he said just enough to appease and quiet the intense ethical debate

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:19.160
around what happened with Jesse. You could say that he kind of, you know, basically again, what are

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.480
we talking about here? We're talking about a carefully controlled narrative where both sides

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:32.440
of the argument are actually on the same team. And I'm positing now, like I think other people

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:39.880
have posited earlier, that maybe he's not the, you know, the savior, the guy in the white horse

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:47.240
that we think he is, because he keeps kind of being this mediocre guy on a white horse an awful lot.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.880
In fact, very curiously around the first time that they ever tried to use transformation to fix a

01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:03.560
genetic disease. And look who's right there to, to again, just like he's doing right now, be that guy

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:13.480
who's got to bring the bad news. Just enough bad news, just enough. So that everybody keeps believing

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.280
the main story, which is that, you know, in this case, the denovirus is will work. It's just that

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.480
they tweaked the doses. And they didn't tell everybody that they were tweaking the dosage.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.880
And so it seems as though he whistled blue on the fact that they changed the dosage without ever

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:37.800
reviewing the protocol again. And he would have never done that. So it's not questioning the

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:44.920
mythology. It's not questioning the intention. It's not it's questioning what? It's not questioning

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.520
the biology. It's not questioning the possibility of augmenting the perfect pattern integrity that

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:59.320
is a person. I hope you can see this, ladies and gentlemen, because we've got him now,

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.360
not like we can do anything about it. But we can see him for who he is. The sunlight is shining.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:13.480
There's no shadows anymore. There's no doubt in my mind that we're being played. It's just a

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.600
question of who he's playing for. But he's not playing on the side of America. He's not playing

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:25.080
on the side of your family or mine. He's getting it while the getting's good, just like a lot of

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.920
these other people are getting it while the getting's good. And maybe it's because somebody

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.880
was going to get it no matter what. If Robert Malone didn't take this job, maybe they'd have

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.560
given it to carrot-funded bullshit. He would have moved over here to America and done it.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.080
Maybe they'd have found somebody else. I don't know.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:53.160
What the bottom line is, is that the novel virus faith is intact. If you listen to Robert Malone,

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:58.520
argue about who should have gotten the Nobel Prize. The faith of the novel virus is intact.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.560
If you listen to people talk about whether the lipid nanoparticle should have been more positive

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.960
or negative, or we listen to people talking about misfolding proteins leading to amyloidosis

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:19.880
or pre-odd disease. Without any mechanistic explanations, without any thorough science,

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:26.280
just in vitro garbage to try and tell you more stories about the ghosts out there,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.640
more stories about whose masks should be taken off, and more stories about what villains we

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:39.720
should be chasing. The only mystery to solve is, is how in the world are all these people

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:47.640
connected like this? Why is he streaming with this person? Are you telling me that he can't get on

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:57.320
Tucker Carlson? Or are we being governed? And if we're being governed, then it's not time for Robert

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.240
Malone to be on Tucker Carlson anymore, because there's too many people that are awake.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:09.640
And we don't dare want to wake any of those TV watchers up anymore. We don't dare want to

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.080
wake any of those TV watchers up anymore. Those people are the last trapped people.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.840
And so his job now is to talk to you and me and all the people that are already awake and know

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:28.760
something's wrong and are never going to take another shot and make sure that they don't question

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.760
the novel virus narrative. They don't question the gain of function narrative. They don't question

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:38.440
anything going forward because their next one, they're going to bring out another one of these

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:46.040
shots and say it's better. And so you got to accept a novel virus and you got to accept

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.360
the contamination and you got to accept the quality control narrative so that the next one

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.600
can be better. Maybe they'll use electricity and DNA and again, and Novio will get a contract

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:03.480
and then you'll be taking the vaccine from trusted Robert Malone, the most interesting man in the

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:13.080
world, to save you from Marburg virus. We're being played, ladies and gentlemen, by somebody who calls

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:19.320
himself a molecular biologist, virologist, pathologist, immunologist, bioethicist,

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.960
and horse trader had to live with the consequences. But what I learned from that was that

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:37.320
if you maintain good friendships and good relations with colleagues, you can survive a blow like that.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:44.600
They'll help you. I use the metaphor of a rock and roller throwing himself onto a mosh pit.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.800
You know the image that I'm talking about and finding that people would catch me and hold me

01:08:52.760 --> 01:09:01.480
and allow me to carry on. And with that comes a huge sense of security that you can act

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:09.560
in accordance with your morals even though it will often have major consequences

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:17.720
and still survive. But the thing about it is that you come through that and you still own your soul.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.200
I think we're worth it. So here's an important piece of the puzzle that I'm trying to unveil,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.480
and it's to do the fact that you would not have been able to get through that period

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:43.560
without the support of Jill. And secondly, I know that Jill was a primary factor in you speaking

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.560
out about your work with mRNA because you could have kept silent. You could have just let it ride.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:58.040
Why did Jill insist that? Listen, you need to share this. You need to talk about this. Why was

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:03.720
because there was a no bell rise at so remember that when I left the salt, I left with a diagnosis

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.600
of PTSD because they were saying that people were being saved by the millions and they weren't

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:15.480
given any credit to my husband. That's why Jill urged him to speak up. It certainly wasn't to save

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.120
people. It certainly wasn't to tell everybody not to take it. They were advocating for every

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:28.680
old person to get this shot. Apparently, he took it himself after he had COVID as if that makes any

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:34.920
sense to an immunologist, a molecular biologist, virologist, not a very smart one of those.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.880
And that's not a trivial thing. I don't just say that. I was a hot mess. And that's something that

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:53.160
doesn't go away throughout much of my professional life to find myself in highly competitive environments

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:04.040
where the same kinds of behaviors are common. And I had also since those early discoveries

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:16.120
really had a heck of a lot of gaslighting and ridicule from people who benefited by positioning

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:23.640
themselves as more important than they were in the story and building companies off of that,

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:34.200
and so I had learned a survival strategy of basically staying quiet and laying low

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:46.280
being not readily visible. I certainly would speak at conferences but didn't make much of.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:53.240
I basically set aside that early trauma and the events associated with it and just went on with

01:11:53.240 --> 01:12:04.280
my life and built other skill sets and other research focus. And so when this started to heat

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:13.320
up and frankly, particularly, I was triggered by a comedian in Canada who posts videos under the

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:21.080
pseudonym What's Her Face that did a video that really went through and dissected what happened

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:28.120
to my Wikipedia page after I was on the Dark Horse podcast and all the wicked editing that

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:36.760
happened with that to write me out of history. And at the time, there was a clear marketing

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:45.240
campaign to get Currico and Weisman the Nobel. This is two and a half years ago now. And my wife

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:52.200
who has lived through all of this experience at first hand, Dr. Jill Glasspool Malone.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:59.880
Dr. Jill Glasspool Malone, it's a little shitty because certain doctorate is not in

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:08.600
something like biology or molecular biology or virology or pathology or anything related to

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:18.280
medicine except it's psychology. So, you know, doctor, it's just lame. I don't ever call myself

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.000
Dr. Jonathan Cooley because I think it's kind of lame. If you're not a medical doctor, you should

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:32.680
say Mr. Mrs. And you can say PhD if you want, you know, but I just don't see the point of saying

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:40.200
Dr. Jill Malone, unless you're really, you know, you mean something with it. Like, and here,

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:47.960
you can only mean to mislead people. And it's annoying. I find it really annoying. Just when

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:56.120
you say Dr. Paul control, you know, you say Dr. Kevin McCann. Everybody introduces me as JJ.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.200
And then everybody says, yeah, but that's all diminutive and everything. What it is is humble.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:08.920
Because I understand that I'm just a reader. I understand that I have a lot of bench experience

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.440
with a very limited aspect of molecular biology, a very limited aspect of neurobiology, a very

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.800
limited aspect of animal behavior, a very limited aspect of small animal surgery, a very limited

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:32.040
aspect of of animal breeding, and an absolute mountain of expertise on electrophysiology and

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:42.760
brain slices. And with that, extremely weird, but varied background in biology that includes

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:49.000
an enthusiasm of birds since I was a kid, collecting reptiles since I was a kid, a love of all kinds

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:57.640
of animals since I was a child. I come at this with a firm and beautiful respect for nature

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:06.840
and how complex it is. And a real firm understanding that the real appreciation that you need to have

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:11.480
as a biologist is that there's so much that we're never going to be able to figure out because it is

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.040
this complex interaction of complex interactions with complex interactions

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.840
with pattern integrities.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.080
I just don't feel the sacred here. We're being sold down the river by people who've already

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.720
given up on the sacred who already believe all of the keys are in our hands. They believe that

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.480
it's just a matter of time before all these mysteries are going to be solved and all these

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:49.080
nuts are going to be cracked. Robert Malone is exactly one of these people

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.920
who probably thinks there's too many people on the planet and certainly too many mouth breathers

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.480
and that we need to use the medical data that we can to make this go forward because otherwise

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:10.040
it will never go forward. And I think he's positioning himself for whatever changes are to come,

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.280
just like a lot of these people are, just like I am and just like you should be.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:22.840
Said no, Robert, this time I insist you have to stand up and fight what's being done to you.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:30.760
And I really, you know, I'd partitioned all of that in my mind and set it aside and

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:38.280
really didn't look at it, didn't try not to think about it as a defense mechanism.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:45.240
And she hauled out, we had carried the old data to the extent that we were able to extract it from

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:51.080
by Cal and the salt. We carried it with us in a great big box through all the moves and academic

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:58.440
appointments and everything. And she hauled it out and went through it and pulled out key documents

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:05.160
and assembled them and wrote an essay in which she described from her point of view what had

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:12.440
transpired. You see, and that essay is something that Mark has captured images of and she had

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.640
posted this essay on Facebook. So even though that essay doesn't really exist anymore on the

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.080
internet, it's still there in some places. I think you can still have a, there's still a link and

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:31.000
included the receipts, the documents and the patent disclosures, etc. And, and sent that off

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:45.000
to UC San Diego, faculty and leadership, Salk Institute, people at Moderna, an old colleague

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.160
that had invited us to the Carolinska years and years ago, that was-

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.640
So she sent a letter to Moderna, the Salk Institute, the University of San

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:03.640
San Diego, or wherever that was. She sent that letter to all those places. That's pretty bold.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:13.080
A letter about PTSD, a letter about his, his, his ideas getting stolen from him,

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.760
idea about how millions of people's lives are being saved by his technology and nobody's giving

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.800
him any credit for it. She sent that letter to Moderna and the Salk Institute.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:35.480
Volved in RNA delivery and became a collaborator and was often asked to the Carolinska years and

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:47.160
years ago, that was involved in Canada, Salk Institute, people at Moderna, an old colleague

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:54.920
that had invited us to the Carolinska years and years ago, that was involved in RNA delivery

01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:01.160
and became a collaborator and was on the Nobel selection committee a couple years ago.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:11.320
And, and basically said, no, this is what's happened. And, so that's, that kind of set that

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:19.880
all in motion, the process of objecting to being written out of history and having my

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:25.800
own contributions overlooked. And, of course, there was massive backlash from corporate media,

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:33.080
notably a very ugly piece, poorly written in the Atlantic Monthly. It has a graphic with two

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:40.200
syringes crossing over my face like skull and crossbones with my image in red. It's very striking.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.160
Somebody wrote the other day that it was basically an invitation for assassination as far as they

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:58.200
were concerned. But I took a lot of arrows over that. And, you know, the Atlantic Monthly,

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:04.360
the Washington Post, the New York Times, Business Insider, Forbes Magazine, all of these entities,

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:12.520
as well as my haters in academia, particularly at the Scripps Institute of Research.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:21.800
There's one that I don't want to amplify. They all focused just on the published manuscripts.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:28.440
None of them will acknowledge the patents. So, because I was at, at a company, all of that stuff

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:35.480
had to go into patents, not into papers. And so, it's weaponized that, well, I didn't really do

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:42.200
what I did because I don't have the peer-reviewed publications. Seriously, I had a whole girl,

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.880
poor Robert, written out of history. Only have a few. They happen to be among the most highly

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:56.200
cited in this area. But that's all whitewashed over as if that... I want to understand, Robert.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.360
Now, this is an interesting question. As you were talking, I thought about it.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:06.600
Just imagine that you had stayed silent as you had typically done. You said nothing.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:15.880
And what happened still happened? How would you have felt? Would you have felt the same? Better?

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:23.640
Worse? What do you think? I think it's good in... It's been particularly therapeutic starting with

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.840
your broadcast, but so many others where I've been asked to tell the story of what transpired

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:36.280
at the soul and at Vycal. And there's a school of thought that when you have a traumatic event,

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:42.280
you need to talk about it many times before you can heal from that event.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:49.960
And I'm a much better person, even though it's been rough. I'm certainly healthier

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:57.960
psychologically because I have gone through this process of sharing and expressing

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:04.440
what I've experienced. And I've had feedback from so many people, particularly graduate students

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:11.560
that have in postdocs that have had to live in this really rather twisted modern academic environment

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:18.120
express to me, you know, I so much appreciate what you said. I had similar experiences.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.360
These are what happened to me. And I think the whole thing, not to sound too touchy-feely,

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:32.440
has been very therapeutic. I know when he tells the story of his PTSD that he experienced with his

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:38.040
patent dispute with Vycal and the Salk Institute, I think to myself, man, I just want to call

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:44.280
and tell Robert Malone how happy I am that somebody's finally speaking out about the way

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:54.120
that us postdocs suffer. Just for me, but for a whole cohort of people that have also experienced

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:02.760
these types of rather average behavior from high profile academics. I'm going to share

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:09.480
something here now. So this is the Nobel Prize. This is the second of October. So this is the

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.720
PDF from the Nobel Institute. And they have here, Catalina, Kariko, and Drew Weisman.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:25.240
I want you because you knew this was coming. And I want to understand because I'm thinking

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.920
about it from a scientific point of view. When you've done work and you've created ideas

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:39.080
and then not be credited for it, it does hurt. Did this hurt? Even though you knew it was coming.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:48.040
Did it hurt? To reel back, when Steve Kirsch and I went on the Brett Weinstein Dark Horse podcast,

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:54.360
three of us sat around for about 20 minutes before we started the broadcast and discussed

01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:02.280
the potential consequences of what we were about to do. Oh my gosh, the consequences could be

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:12.200
drastic. Brett, you could lose the Google payouts that you get from YouTube and the ads that run

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:20.520
on your extraordinary podcast. Robert Malone could lose all of his illustrious career as a

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:28.760
vaccine broker and horse salesman. And Steve Kirsch, he's got his own company. So he'll be fine. Oh no,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.040
wait a minute. He was asked to step down from his company.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:44.360
So they took the risk anyway, and they titled the podcast three easy steps to end the pandemic.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.200
And then in the first 10 minutes of the podcast, Brett proceeded to tell everybody how they were

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:59.400
an example of how strangers could hang out without masks, because infection and injection on the

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:05.880
right, double injection on the left, and master of prophylactic ivermectin in the middle.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.040
We haven't forgotten he would like us to have forgotten that he never came out against anything.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:28.200
And you could call it speaking against the narrative of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:36.200
And we thought at the time, Steve was the one that was most bomb proof because he had his own company.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.960
It caused him to lose his company. His board of directors basically asked for his resignation.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:52.920
And Brett, certainly he got demonetized. That was a huge impact for him. My understanding is he was

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:58.840
quite depressed for a while. And as you would well imagine, if that's your main source of income,

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:06.440
getting demonetized from YouTube. And for me, the discussion was that the Nobel was in play

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:16.600
at that time, and that this would jinx my ability to prevail in that or be included in it. And so

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:25.640
it was a conscious decision that that was a risk, consciously taken, but that it was the right thing

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:34.120
to speak at that time. And so when this dropped, I was in one sense surprised, in another sense,

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.800
not surprised. I was surprised in that my colleague from the Carolinska that I mentioned, who's a

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:46.840
full professor and works on RNA delivery and self-replicating RNAs, had assured me that the

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:54.040
committee two years ago had reviewed the contributions of Currico and Weismann and had determined that

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:03.080
they were not sufficiently meritorious to warrant the price. And the committee at the time apparently

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:11.480
was surprised because they had not been aware that I had done that original work. And as apparently

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.360
Moderna and Pfizer were not aware because they didn't cite the patents, and that's another story

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.640
right now. They're busy in a patent battle. And now Pfizer paradoxically is citing those old patents

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:31.720
in their attacks against Mert, I mean, against Moderna. So I had been told that the committee had

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.120
reviewed this and found that it was not sufficiently meritorious. And my expectation was that the

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.520
committee was just going to stay away from this topic, you know, certainly for many years until it

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:54.040
had declared itself, let's say, in terms of what were the real issues with this product,

01:27:54.040 --> 01:28:01.400
these mRNA vaccines for COVID and the technology platform, et cetera. But clearly,

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:08.520
they decided not to. They decided to take it up and they voted to grant this in a very odd way.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.040
It is, it is, and you've got it highlighted there. Basically, they did a carve out

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:27.480
just for this to make this award. And the wording is crucial there, as is the press release that

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:38.920
corresponds to this. The, it's the carve out is restricted to just mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:48.040
So this is a Nobel award for enabling the rapid development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19,

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:54.120
not for the development of the core technology platform or anything else. So as Jill and I were

01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:00.680
pondering this and, you know, mRNA just read it there through their groundbreaking findings,

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:08.760
which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:17.960
That's the key. So by chemically altering the mRNA, we have learned a little bit more about how

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.160
mRNA interacts with our immune system or interacts with the intracellular machinery,

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:30.280
which processes mRNA and foreign mRNA in particular. We've learned a little bit more

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:41.000
enough to use it as an excuse that contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.200
So during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times. So

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.200
what's important to see here in my, from my perspective, is that Robert is now still having

01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.840
a debate about what role he played in the development of the mRNA technology

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:08.760
and what things are going to contribute ultimately to the enablement of these development,

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:15.240
the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. So what part of this is he not going to challenge?

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:23.320
He's not going to challenge that this was one of the greatest threats to human health in modern

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:34.120
times. If he was trying to free us like like Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson and Thomas Binder

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:44.760
and Peter McCullough and Bobby and a lot of other people, I think, are trying to free us.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:55.160
Excuse me. We've really got to get it into our heads that one of the things that we needed to

01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:01.080
spell is this mythology that it was one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.520
Bobby's not there yet. Peter McCullough is not there yet, but we're trying.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:13.080
And you saw that Peter McCullough had the first time at a sparkle in his eye about this idea

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:19.240
when he was talking to Daddy Rancour. So we're going to get there, but we've got to keep pushing

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:25.160
and we can't let people put it on the screen and then not talk about it. Distract us with

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:32.280
you know, the precise wording of enabled the development of or no, we are now

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:39.080
putting into the Nobel Prize record that they saved us from one of the greatest threats in

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.280
modern history. So the lie is not the biology of the mRNA vaccine. The lie is that.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.040
That's the lie. That's what makes it okay for it to have been rushed. That's what makes it okay

01:31:52.040 --> 01:32:00.840
for it to have contaminants and still get the award because otherwise it wouldn't get a reward,

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.000
right? It wouldn't get an award if it hadn't saved anybody's lives. Then it would have been

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.800
a rushed product that hurt a lot of people. I hope you can see how important it is

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:19.640
that that's in there, that they're saying it, that it is the justification for awarding them

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.720
the prize and talking about the biology of that is accepting the fact that the greatest threat

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.680
to human health in modern times just passed us by.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:37.800
Or anything else. So as Jill and I were pondering this and you know, how do we process this and deal

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:44.040
with it? Her point immediately was, well, actually this is kind of indicating because the committee

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:53.880
has not, has explicitly not made the award for the invention of the technology, which was what was

01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:02.600
being advanced in the press in stat news in Boston and others, CNN originally, before I started

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:08.840
objecting, was that Kariko and Weissman were the ones that had created this technology. When in

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:15.640
fact, they came, they didn't even start doing any of this stuff until 15 years after what I did.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:27.560
So, so in a way, it was okay. Now, the assertions that are made by the committee

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:37.160
are largely false and fairly transparently false. The assertion that Kariko and Weissman

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:44.920
produced these four papers that involved the use of a a pseudo-uridine modified base

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:54.680
incorporated into synthetic RNA, reducing inflammatory responses relative to non-modified RNA.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:02.520
They hold the patent on that from you, Penn. And that patent is fascinating because it says nothing

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:09.960
about vaccines. And Kariko and Weissman originally did not intend to work on vaccines, but rather

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:19.880
were focused on cancer when they did these discoveries. So, there it's absolutely true

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:27.160
as the committee asserts that Kariko and Weissman made these discoveries and they made them after I

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:36.040
had left. And I've congratulated them on that achievement of the Nobel Prize for their discovery.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:45.320
The next statement that's made there in that clause that justifies the product and in the

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:54.200
press releases, they talk about effective vaccines. That's highly debatable. And they also assert

01:34:54.200 --> 01:35:01.240
in the press release, the vaccines have saved millions of lives and greatly reduced disease.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:10.200
That's also really in flux right now, that that thesis. But you notice they speak of effective,

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.560
they don't say safe and effective, which has become the mantra. So, they dropped a safe part.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:23.000
And then in their press release, they talked about that what was really important here was that

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.320
the pseudo-uridine invention was what was enabling for the rapid development of these products. And

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:37.880
that's also a false statement. The discovery phase and development of the, let's say, composition

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:45.880
of matter, that's technical patent talk for a vaccine is usually, and in this case also, a very

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:55.160
small fraction of the overall, the discovery phase and development of the, let's say, composition

01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:01.800
of matter, that's technical patent talk for a vaccine is usually in, in this technical

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:09.000
in development of the, let's say, composition of matter, that's technical patent talk for a vaccine

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.640
is usually in, and in this case also, a very small fraction of the overall time necessary for

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:20.840
development. The reason why these vaccines were developed so quickly had nothing to do with mRNA,

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:30.200
but largely had to do with dropping the normal processes for assessing pharmacology, toxicology,

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.560
biodeistribution. No, there is not wrong. It's really interesting to say that their,

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:43.800
that their new idea of chemically altering uracils was an enabling technology that allowed

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.440
these vaccines to develop so quickly. But in reality, the only thing that needed to be done was

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:54.440
we needed to shorten and get rid of all this regulatory procedure and declare an emergency under the

01:36:54.440 --> 01:37:02.280
prep act, which is really what he should say here, right? Which is really what he should say here.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:08.360
He should say it explicitly declaring an emergency under the prep act is what allowed this to happen.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:14.040
He should say that explicitly. If he was trying to save us, will he say it?

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:23.880
Pharmacokinetics in phase one, two, three clinical trials, pharmacosis for assessing

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:31.880
pharmacology, toxicology, biodeistribution, pharmacokinetics, in phase one, two, three clinical trials.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.800
That was a pretty stupid, complicated way of saying that they declared an emergency under the prep act

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.840
and then that meant they didn't have to do anything. You could keep it real simple, but instead,

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:50.200
it's often stupid, complicated. And you don't say what needs to be said. That's how the narrative

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.120
is being controlled. Ladies and gentlemen, that's why we have to listen to Robert Malone, because

01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:01.160
then we can hear the barriers. We can hear the boundaries. We can hear the boundaries of the

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.720
debate on this side when we listen to Robert Malone. We can hear the boundaries of the debate on the

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:12.840
other side when we watch PBS NewsHour. And once we can see where the boundaries of the debate are,

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:20.920
we can start pushing there. Because otherwise, we're pushing on their practice dummies.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:31.160
And we're running in their little wheels. So we got to listen carefully. We got to find out

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:37.240
where the edge of this narrative is and that we need to push hard on it. And so some of the

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:44.520
places he's pushing are real. It didn't save millions of lives. It didn't enable the technology.

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:51.800
The prep act enabled it. But then as he says it correctly, he stops short of giving you the truth.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.680
And that's exactly the magic. That's exactly the enchantment.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.400
He should have done said the prep act and emergency here. And he should have done

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.120
said that we need to stop the government from being able to declare an emergency again. And then

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:17.480
all this goes away. But he's not saying it. Including dose escalation. And not to mention the

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:25.320
nonclinical and clinical toxicology. So it was it was the dropping of the regulatory norms that

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.480
resulted in this being done so quickly. It wasn't really anything to do with pseudoridine.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.560
Well, it raises a good point because I was asking about this as I was doing my research.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:43.320
I realized that actually they even modified the pseudoridine even further by creating an N1

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:50.120
methyl serodeuridine, which is what they've used in the vaccines, which is quite remarkable. I guess

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:57.560
what they're saying is just the concept of create using this pseudoridine is the innovation. It

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:04.760
doesn't matter how you then subsequently adjust it. Yeah, that that could be the logic. It's it's

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:10.120
I'm not aware. And remember what I said, the salt, I think there was six or eight Nobel laureates

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:18.920
there, including Francis Crick. I'm not aware in the history of the Nobel Prize for medicine

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:24.440
or physiology, that those that originated the technology were not included in the final

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:36.040
award. That's very unusual. And the the point that all of these, let's say irregularities or

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:46.920
untruths that are used to justify this award, really, in my mind, speak of a

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:55.560
the logic underneath this, not really being grounded in rigorous science and medicine.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.240
I think it has more to do with politics. That's a controversial statement on it. Really don't

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:10.600
want to come across as sour grapes or or denying in any way, or casting shade or disparaging the

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:17.960
achievement of this, or or to second guess the Nobel Committee, it made their decision.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.360
But I do note that Pfizer is a major donor to the Carolinska Institute. So whatever happened

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:37.320
here, it happened. I was surprised you asked about my emotions. I was surprised. What what

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:45.800
was more hurtful for me than the actual award was the rekindling of the box trolls and social

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:54.200
media scientists attacks on me, asserting that this demonstrated that I didn't actually do what I did.

01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:02.200
That's that's just hurtful. And it's not it's not based in in fact,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:11.000
and it's, you know, it's, it's, you know, what's hurtful is when doctors are told they have to

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.120
follow a protocol and then those doctors follow the protocol and then lie to the patients about

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:22.040
following the protocol and the fact that it's going to help them. You know what sucks is when

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:27.800
people are lied to about why they have to stay away from their grandmother while she's dying.

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:33.720
You know, it sucks is when people are lied to about why they're being treated the way they're

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:41.160
treated or how they're being treated or what they're being given. I don't know if he suffered

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:47.720
that much during the pandemic. I don't know if he's really in a position to whine about just him all

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:54.840
the time. When lots of other people lost their businesses, lost their jobs, lost their livelihoods,

01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:03.720
lost family members, lost children, lost parents, lost use of their hands.

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:14.120
I just think it's a little disingenuous for him to be singing for an hour and 15 minutes about

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:24.360
how much pain he suffered as the hurtful internet. The hurtful, unwritten history that is his

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:33.720
when he just wants to be a humble horse farmer, famous for saving the world, I guess.

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:44.360
Tearing off the the scab over the psychological pain, frankly, I don't want to sound like a

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:56.680
whiner. Do psychological scars have scabs? Of what was deployed against me by corporate media

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:08.840
two years ago, two and a half years ago, but that's the modern ecosystem in social media is this kind

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:16.360
of really rather wicked behavior. The way that they brought out the truth was somewhat very similar

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:23.160
to how they brought it out all the other times in the Scooby-Doo. Robert Malone got to be on Tucker

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:31.080
Carlson. Robert Malone was on Rogan. Robert Malone was on every podcast.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:45.160
And while he was out there, he was telling the story of viruses, telling the story of his technology

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:52.280
being stolen from him. Telling a broken story about it might be working, it might not be working,

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:58.840
it should be working. We don't know if it's working. Controlling the narrative, being the star of the

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:08.120
show, touring the world, touring the world. He's just a humble horse farmer. But in order to save

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.080
the world, he's definitely willing to do a week long cruise off of the coast of Turkey with a bunch

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:24.040
of dissidents. He's definitely willing to go to the EU three times a year. Sometimes he's doing nine

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:35.400
hits a day, nine podcasts a day. Sometimes he puts out 21 single space pages of text every day.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:45.640
And he's got horses and emus. Ladies and gentlemen, something is incongruent here.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:53.240
Something is very, very incongruent here. And if we follow this to the end, I think we're

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.160
going to figure out what's going on. I think you're going to see the Scooby Doo for what it is. I

01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:05.240
think we can expose these people because they're all connected. There's no possible way that George

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:15.960
Webb, Paul Catrell, Robert Malone, Charles Ricksey, Kevin McCann, Dr. Philip McMillan,

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:24.200
a carrot fund in Bosch, and Dr. Paul Catrell, if I didn't say that already, are not all connected.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:30.600
There's just no way. They're definitely all connected. They seem to be all part of the same

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:38.200
sideshow, pushing the worst case scenario, pushing rumors of the worst case scenario of the shot,

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:44.200
the worst case scenario of all the different ways the transfection went wrong.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:54.040
Instead of all the ways the transfection is wrong. See the difference? All these people are pushing

01:46:54.040 --> 01:47:00.360
the ways the transfection went wrong instead of the ways the transfection is wrong. And they're

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:06.760
all related. They've all been on each other's shows. Robert Malone has been on this guy's show

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.400
in the same month that he was on Bret Weinstein a month before he went on Joe Rogan and broke the internet.

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:21.000
And Robert Malone is streamed with Kevin or with Paul Catrell while at the same time talking

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.480
out of the other side of his mouth about how one of his arch nemesis is on the internet is

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.880
none other than George Webb, who says the biggest hero in the medical community speaking out since

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:38.520
2020 is Paul Catrell, fake doctor, bus rider MD,

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:50.760
who supposedly his arch em is in arch one of his arch and nemesis in 2020 was none other than

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:56.840
Kevin McCarid, who convinced me that I should fight with him against the silver salesman.

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:09.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is breaking very fast. The illusion is breaking because all of these

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.240
people have underestimated our ability to look back on the internet itself and see the videos

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:24.520
that they did and see a pattern that's incongruent. But it's very incongruent when you're liars

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.960
and you have to keep track of all the lies that you told it's really hard.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.720
Especially when there's videos of all the previous lies that you told and anyone can go look at

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:46.360
them and if they spend enough time, if they waste enough time on the drama, then all kinds of stuff

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:54.600
seems to fall out. Of people that just want to hate and there's nothing to be done about it.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.680
You just kind of have to suck it up. Snowflake and deal with it.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:07.880
That was the one that was more hurtful than the decision by the committee. I could have used the

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:16.840
money. But Kariko and Weisman have already scooped up the Lasker award, the similar award from the

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.880
Israeli government. When they got the Lasker award, they wore masks for the photo.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:31.720
Her award from the Spanish government. There was clearly a big push here and this is big science

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:39.720
and that's just the way big science goes. If you don't, one of the things early in my career

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:49.080
at the Salk, one of the competitors to ender verma was Tony Hunter, who also ran Nobel Laureate.

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:57.320
I guess I'm now an also ran. For some of his key work, Brilliant Man. Mine like a trap.

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:05.880
And he once said to me, if you think this is the last major discovery you're ever going to make,

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.200
then you should get out of science right now. This is basically a bucket up

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:21.320
and don't line. And this is just the way things are. Science is a hard ball game.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:28.120
And so, and the other thing about this, you're asking about the emotional state.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:36.680
My entire professional career, I've had to deal psychologically with the gaslighting and

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:46.760
denialism and all of this wire line. And this is just the way things are. Science is going to make,

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:55.000
then you should to me and for some of his key work, Brilliant Man. It's all one of the competitors

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:02.680
to ender verma was Tony Hunter, who was also ran Nobel Laureate. I guess I'm now an also ran.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.240
And for some of his key work, Brilliant Man. Mine like a trap.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:17.880
And he once said to me, if you think this is the last major discovery you're ever going to make,

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:24.120
then you should get out of science right now. This is basically a bucket up

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:33.240
and don't line. And this is just the way things are. Science is a hard ball game.

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:40.040
And so, and the other thing about this, you're asking about the emotional state.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:48.600
My entire professional career, I've had to deal psychologically with the gaslighting and

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:56.280
denialism and all of this. And so, I kind of almost had a lot of that, that emotional

01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.320
baggage burned out of me.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:06.840
You know, I'm going to say something now, and I had responded to a few comments on social

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:14.280
media as well. And I, as I wrote something, I reflected on it. And my feeling is that the

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:25.080
technology has some limitations. But my honest instinct is that they did it with the wrong disease

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:35.560
at too big a scale. Meaning that if they had done what the intention was, which was to focus on the

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:44.760
high risk cohort and try to protect them with the technology, I think the risk or the potential

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:51.480
exposure of the technology would have been significantly lower. But the exposure of the

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:57.240
technology would have been significantly lower. Exactly. You would not have been able to see

01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:02.840
that the technology sucked because it would have just killed old and vulnerable people with

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:10.040
comorbidities. That's what they should have done. If they were really just intending to get rid of

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:19.160
the get rid of as much chaff as they could. And he just said it right there. The technology

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.560
would not have been as exposed if they had just used it on the weak and vulnerable.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:31.160
But they used it on all kinds of healthy people. And now we've got a problem. Did you hear it?

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:42.680
The technology for your scale, meaning that if they had done what the intention was, which was

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:51.240
to focus on the high risk cohort and try to protect them with the technology, I think the

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:59.320
risk or the potential exposure of the technology would have been significantly lower. And I said

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:06.600
something here. I'll finish with this statement. I said that no matter what the political situation

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:15.800
is, the people who have been hurt in one way or the other by the technology will never

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:25.000
be silent. And that's in effect the thing that is unstoppable. And so the platform, even though

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.360
it could have more modifications, more benefits, could be destroyed at this altar. Any thoughts on

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:39.800
that? So I had warned about this, and not just the platform, but the entire vaccine enterprise

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:46.840
has been compromised. And public faith in public health, the reputation of the CDC,

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:53.480
the reputation of the FDA, I speak about this from time to time. I was speaking to a Portuguese

01:54:53.480 --> 01:55:00.040
audience about a year and a half or two years ago. And an older woman asked me a question and

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:06.920
prefaced it with a preamble. And she made the point that throughout Europe, the FDA had always

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:15.960
been believed to be the gold standard for integrity and rigor in regulation of drugs and

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:22.040
biological products. And that she had come to now understand that the FDA was corrupt

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.080
and could not be relied on. And when she said that, I had not allowed that thought to come

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:36.200
into my mind up until that point, he didn't think the FDA was corrupt, even though he was

01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:43.160
involved in getting $10 billion worth of grant money from the United States government. And it

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:51.960
involved in bringing lots of different technologies to market via the FDA. In fact, what did he say?

01:55:52.600 --> 01:56:00.520
Holy shit. He said he worked for a regulatory affairs sweatshop, which had to do with FDA

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:11.080
regulations. He didn't know that the FDA was not to be trusted until then, even though he was

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.280
in the business for 20 years of taking advantage of gaming that system.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:26.360
I mean, can you believe it? Can you believe that he's even got the gall to talk these words,

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:35.160
to speak these words in this order? But of course he is. He's woozy on with right now. He's on with

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:47.480
somebody who's on his team. And it was not and rigor in regulation of drugs and biological

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:55.960
products. And that she had come to now understand that the FDA was corrupt and could not be relied

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.040
on. And when she said that, I had not allowed that thought to come into my mind up until that

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:09.000
point. And it literally hit me like a brick to the head. That's absurd. That's as absurd as his

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:19.400
story that he didn't know what the w w w w w w e f or seppy and all these other things people

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:27.320
were up to before he was told about it at the start of the pandemic. That's the story. That's

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:33.720
the story that we are told that Robert Malone didn't know about the w f until someone else told

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:40.920
him during the pandemic. He just woke up. He didn't even know that the FDA was corrupt until someone

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:53.880
in Portugal told him. Um, in this rush, this Operation Warp Speed, and all of the profit rush

01:57:53.880 --> 01:58:00.680
Operation Warp Speed. Uh oh, I wonder who he's who he's thrown under the bus here. Again, uh,

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:10.120
in Miss wouldn't that be convenient? Just in time. Coming to the rescue of the blue side.

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:15.000
Information and disinformation that was propagated by the government and the withholding of

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:22.600
information about adverse events, for instance, myocarditis in particular. Uh, what we had done

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.440
as a United States health and human services and, uh,

01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:35.880
by defense infrastructure and and really biomedical pharmaceutical complex is we had destroyed or

01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:44.760
severely damaged our competitive position in the world as the preeminent, uh, developer and

01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:51.480
manufacturer of these types of products. And my prediction had been then, and I think we're seeing

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:59.880
it accelerate that what would be the logical consequence would be that the United States would

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:09.800
continue to lose its its dominant position in biopharmaceuticals to India and China, one of which

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:16.120
is considered a hostile nation. And the other one is at best a frenemy, uh, certainly a strong

01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:22.920
competitor. And that's, that's what's happened. The United States now has to import not only final

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:29.560
drug product, but, uh, drug precursors, if they're going to do that. And the reputation of the FDA

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:38.360
is trashed globally and, uh, within the States. I, the damage that's been done here, uh, through,

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:47.800
uh, the logic of emergency use authorization of, uh, products that are proven to be neither safe nor

01:59:47.800 --> 02:00:00.360
effective. Uh, in response to what was, uh, basically marketed or propagandized as a highly lethal

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:08.600
respiratory virus with a 3.4% case fatality rate. When it based on Ferguson's modeling largely,

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:17.080
uh, in Imperial college and his group, uh, and has proven to be paradoxically, Mr. Trump got this

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:24.920
right. Early on, he, there's multiple video clips of him saying that the fatality rate here, I think

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.520
he calls it mortality rate is well less than 1%. That turns out to be the case. Uh, and the whole

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:38.360
logic that did, and so why won't he explain that they did something in New York City, which Jessica

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:45.640
Hockett has identified as like a bomb going off and then using those numbers out of context

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.320
and spreading that out throughout the United States in certain places where the protocols could

02:00:53.400 --> 02:01:04.280
be enacted, they were able to create a brief pulse of increase in all cause mortality that they then

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:15.560
extrapolated from. It's not just the models. It's the models plus this little tiny start blip

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.840
that was required so that everybody could say, but do you see it? It's right here. It's starting.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:27.960
It's about to go to a billion people dead. And then of course, as Jessica Hockett showed,

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:34.440
it just went up. And three weeks later, it went down and it never went up again for the rest of the

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:43.880
year. And so is he going to point that out? Is he going to explain that it wasn't just the

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:51.080
exaggeration of the danger of the virus, but it was actually the inversion of the protocols,

02:01:51.080 --> 02:02:00.680
the imposition of the protocols, the complete reduction of the use of antibiotics to treat

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:11.160
secondary pneumonia? And do you know that a lot of these EUA PCR tests, when those results came back,

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:19.000
they said under the results that this PCR test cannot rule out effects from secondary

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.920
pneumonia and secondary bacterial infection. Almost all of them say that. Look it up.

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:34.840
Interpreting these results positive cannot rule out the effects of secondary bacterial infection.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:48.360
This was a highly lethal virus that would overwhelm our hospitals, cause us to need to have mass

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:56.920
graves and pre-servants full of dead bodies and et cetera, et cetera. That's all turned out to be

02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:06.280
false propaganda. But that is what has been used to justify these breaches of what are really

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:12.040
international norms of ethics and product development that have been developed over decades. And so

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:21.480
we're now left. I discredited Fauci hotels and Collins since 2020. Collins and his

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:29.320
immunomethology was in my stream for the first year and a half of my work. Those children have

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.600
been dismissed a long time ago. So I'm sorry you missed it, but I won't go backwards to them. Those

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:42.920
guys are stooges. Francis Collins is not a genius. Even Tony Fauci is not a genius. These are stooges.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.120
I could tell you my colleagues in the

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.560
clinical development and earlier phase pharmaceutical development space

02:03:52.520 --> 02:04:05.400
are perplexed now. What's happened in the states with regulatory affairs in the FDA

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:13.720
is that what had previously been a fairly rigorous and highly structured process.

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:21.000
We all knew the rules. We knew what the process was. We could project how much it costs. We could

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:28.200
project the timelines and grind away for a decade to get the product developed and safe and effective.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:37.160
And now it's kind of anything goes if they want it to go. And if they want to hold you to

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:44.360
higher standards, they will and you can't predict what it's going to be. People are left with,

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:52.680
well, who do I have to pay off? What do I have to do? The whole system is now compromised.

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:59.080
Its integrity is compromised. And he just figured it out recently because some

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:05.640
woman at a talk that he was giving in Portugal pointed it out to him. Before that, he didn't

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.400
realize that the FDA was corrupt. All kinds of implications.

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:14.520
I want to ask you a part of the question because another piece of the puzzle, even though we speak

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:22.200
of mRNA, the delivery system with regards to lipid nanoparticles. And I heard you speaking about

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:30.680
this recently. And I also had a recent conference and someone, Christy Grace, had made some very

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:37.480
important comments about this. And I just brought up here one of the paper that shows major delivery

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:48.760
systems for these mRNA. Those graphics are grossly naive. Oh, are they? Yes. So all I want to know

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:58.280
is that when you see the different strategies for delivering the mRNA, have we ever at this scale

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:08.440
used the LNP in this kind of way? Are there any risks with that? Separate apart from the mRNA?

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:18.360
Yes, is the answer. And we know this because of data that was shared by Moderna about their phase

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:23.400
one dose escalation trials with their influenza vaccine candidate was shared to their

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:31.960
sock holders. It wasn't made public, which shows that at the 100 mic level with the flu expression

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:42.520
vectors, RNA, they had an enormously high adverse event rate. Something like 30 or 40 percent of

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:48.920
the patients enrolled at 100 mics had developed serious adverse events over a fairly short period

02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:58.600
of time. So only because a lot of this work is not being done rigorously and by basically treaty

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:04.760
based on a meeting that was held chaired by Margaret Liu at the World Health Organization

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:12.040
little over a year ago, the decision has been made within Western regulatory authorities

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:19.800
that the candidate lipid formulation that you were just referring to that, by the way,

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:29.800
if somebody in my opinion, if you're going to give the Nobel for the enabling technology.

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.440
The people that should have got it was Peter Collas at University of British Columbia and his

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:41.880
colleagues because that is the enabling technology. And that technology is licensed to

02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:48.280
a company that I think Justin Trudeau's family owns a lot of, but I could be wrong.

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:56.120
Is that the lipids in formulation structure in the East of Pegg that is used by all

02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:05.800
Keraback Moderna and Biointech, Pfizer, that's who really made the breakthroughs

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:13.800
after decades and decades of hard work. And I've known Peter Collas throughout my career as one of

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:22.360
the top lipid formulation specialists in the world. And if I can just thanks for joining Janet

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:28.360
horse a little further, there were three companies in the running originally. The third one was

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:34.200
called Keraback and he was they were funded by an obscure investor that you've never heard of

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:43.640
before called Elon Musk. And they ran a more conservative phase one trial with antibody

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:51.720
titers as endpoints in humans in which they used a significantly lower dose than even Pfizer did.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:58.920
Member of Moderna's three times Pfizer. Are you hearing that Elon Musk's RNA company used

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:04.760
a similar mRNA but without pseudo-uridine and they still got a robust response? Not as robust

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:11.560
as the high dosage of Moderna or of the pseudo-uridine treated high dosage of Pfizer,

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:18.200
but they got a good reaction. They got of antibody response and they didn't have to use pseudo-uridine.

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:28.120
Is Keraback the company of Elon Musk being set up as the next best mRNA production line?

02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:36.440
Interesting. And Keraback was a fraction of the Pfizer dose but Keraback did not use pseudo-uridine

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:43.720
and it got a robust body response but not as high as those that had used the higher doses.

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:48.600
And they couldn't get funding to carry forward with the product development and it was dropped.

02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:55.160
But those data demonstrate that you don't have to have the pseudo-uridine. It works just fine

02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:00.120
without it. And Moderna didn't use to use the pseudo-uridine. It made a decision kind of the

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:08.760
last minute to license the enzyme. But the cationic lipid formulations are intrinsically toxic.

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:16.920
The mRNA and its immunosuppressive characteristics because this isn't really mRNA. This is a chemically

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:24.360
synthesized molecule that has pseudo-uridine of whichever form throughout its backbone. That's

02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:31.000
not a normal characteristic of RNA. The placement of pseudo-uridine in normal RNA is very strategic

02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:36.040
and specific in where it's placed, not all the way through the molecule.

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.000
And it is absolutely immunosuppressive. That was the intention but that's a double-edged sword,

02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:48.920
especially when you do them with immune responses. And then there's the spike protein.

02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:56.200
And if we compare, for instance, by the FDA and CDC's own admission,

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:07.160
the Novavax product, which is caterpillar cell produced and caterpillar virus produced spike

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:15.400
protein, the adenoviral-vectored products, one of which the J&J had been sold in the United States

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:22.600
until recently. And the two RNA products that also express the spike, they all have the common

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:31.320
feature of cardiotoxicity, the myocarditis and pericarditis, and yet their core platforms

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:38.360
when used for other purposes do not show that characteristic. So major problems with myocarditis

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:44.760
and pericarditis in coagulopathy were not problems with prior adenovctored vaccine candidates.

02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:51.880
They haven't been problems with prior Novavax technology candidates. So I think it's reasonable

02:11:51.880 --> 02:12:01.960
to conclude, you're a scientist, that this is basic Sesame Street stuff. We have these different

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:07.720
products, they have one common characteristic, they cause this spike protein to be present in

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:12.920
the body at very high levels in a very abrupt kinetic, very different from the natural infection.

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:20.040
And systemically, rather than mucosally, so very different, again, from natural infection,

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:26.040
and they all have this common feature of cardiotoxicity and coagulopathy and stroke and everything.

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:35.640
And so my thesis is that we have a cluster of toxicities that are attributable to the formulation

02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:40.520
itself in the presence of a polynucleotide, because you can't make these particles, the

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:45.960
peter colus particles in the absence of a polynucleotide. They have to have a polymer,

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:52.680
an anionic polymer to self-assemble, you know, based on ionic interactions.

02:12:54.600 --> 02:13:00.600
So the lipid particle is toxic, the mRNA is immunosuppressive, that's a toxicity,

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:10.360
and the spike protein is toxic. Those toxicities overlap, and the vector sum of those are particles

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:19.480
in a process that has been very, is very complex from a pharmaceutical standpoint,

02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:26.200
and involves multiple active new chemical entities.

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:34.760
So I want to ask you a question, Robert, and I wanted to think about from a scientific perspective

02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:45.000
as a scientist. I am baffled why the scientific community as a whole, you know, the public seems

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:52.280
to have clued in a lot of the public that something isn't quite right. Why is there this almost

02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:00.440
ideological perspective? It's because the narrative has been curated. It's because the

02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:06.760
narrative has been curated by people like Robert Malone, being on streams with Dr. Philip McMillan,

02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:13.960
curating a narrative about an investigational vaccine and about a novel virus that we needed

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:20.280
to do something for. That's the reason why we're here. That's the answer. There's about 30 or 40

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:26.040
more minutes of this interview, but like Kim Traveler, I'm also getting tired. I think I'm

02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.240
going to cut it short right here. I hope you don't mind. Watch the rest of this and see if

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:36.680
there's anything interesting for me to pull out a drop in the next couple of streams. Someone dropped

02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:45.240
a little thread in here about data sciences and Vivek and Kushner, and it's interesting,

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:50.840
so they didn't check it out. Click on it. Thanks very much for joining me, guys. This has been

02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.960
Giga Home Biological, a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:00.440
Don't forget the Ninja Mouse Killer injection of any combination of substances with the

02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:05.240
intent of augmenting the immune system. It's dumb, and if that's too complicated for you,

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:11.400
just say the Transfections for non-immunizations and stop them. Stop them and everybody.

02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:16.760
They're trying to eliminate the control you're planning means necessary. This has been Giga Home

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:23.720
Biological. Don't forget about the broken science movement, the initiative, a great place to find

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.880
interesting videos to share with your friends. Also a great place to talk about the big

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:45.800
lards of science that are broken. It's been Giga Home Biological. Thank you very much.
