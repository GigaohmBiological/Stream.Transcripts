You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
You

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Senator Ron John, nice work Albert I think he's a very very astute man I think he's really in in it for the real fight so

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm happy to hear you connected with him he's actually asked me for an update that I still haven't written

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes playing the reference your work so it's good that you've already made him I'm really happy to hear that

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh

05:25.000 --> 05:39.460
No one will believe

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
You

06:25.000 --> 06:40.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen this is Gigo and biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists the 13th of November

06:40.000 --> 06:53.000
2023 we are still fighting to escape this limited spectrum of debate this critical and dissonant views within it that have been falsely amplified to give us this perceived

06:53.000 --> 07:10.000
perceived vision of what is true from these people to mislead the young and yeah I'm I'm really really stoked that we're made so much progress and I'm really happy that you guys are a part of it

07:10.000 --> 07:20.000
But we got to take the power back from these skeletons we do we have to take the power back from these charlatans I have the feeling my voice is a little hot

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
I see the bricks I hope you guys do

07:27.000 --> 07:39.000
I got to tell you the week and a half off of my voice has done wonders for it it has now progressed quite a bit let me just read these off really quick

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
There was no spread in New York City infectious clones are the only real threat placebo batches were like distributed in transfection and healthy mammals is dumb

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
We can go farther and say that the protocols were murder gave a function as a mythology the scooby-doo mystery is real and the players are committed to lies

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
and the lies are very specifically about this the lies

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
oh that's not the way I can do that

08:07.000 --> 08:22.000
the novel virus is a fate the fact that millions of people died and millions more were saved that's a fate

08:22.000 --> 08:30.000
the idea that gain of function is a real danger that's a fate and the idea that a virus a pandemic is definitely going to come again

08:30.000 --> 08:40.000
that's a fate that's a fate that's not anything based in reality it's not anything based in biology and that is really where we are

08:40.000 --> 08:51.000
modified mRNA definitely modified are in our RNA destroyed cardio myocytes and any other cell that it expresses itself in

08:51.000 --> 09:09.000
biology we really have to not take the bait on TV and social media if you think this is something now it's nothing compared to what they're going to throw at us

09:10.000 --> 09:30.000
I am going to have the event a episode 2 it is coming don't underestimate it's just a question of everything falling in place but there will be a clone war episode 2 for sure

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
and I guess here we are

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
let me see if I can shift over here without too much

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
hassle

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show this is Giga Home Biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
my name is Jonathan Cooley and I'm coming to you from live from the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm happy to be here I took a week off after well more than a week off it was almost two weeks off actually

10:03.000 --> 10:13.000
partly to rest my voice partly because I was traveling and partly because I've been transitioning into this role as a basketball coach

10:13.000 --> 10:21.000
and so I needed to kind of figure out okay how is this going to impact my evenings how is this going to impact my streaming

10:21.000 --> 10:31.000
how is that schedule going to work and more importantly what kind of stress does it put on my partner my wife my best friend in terms of bedtime and everything

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
so I think we're kind of settling around this this attractor state which is around nine or eight thirty

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
it's a lot better if I'm around for my sons to get them in bed and get their phones away from them and on the charger

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
to get the TV off early this kind of thing don't judge me my kids are like your kids they do actually have phones

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
they don't have a lot of stuff on them but there's enough on them so that you know their phone is a little annoying at times

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
and so they're not allowed to use it very much they use it for Spotify a lot but you know after dinner when what's on the TV is not what they're interested in watching

11:14.000 --> 11:27.000
or when someone else has control those are when the phone they tend to disappear to their rooms with their phone and so it's a lot easier to do that together as mom and dad

11:27.000 --> 11:36.000
and so I don't think there are going to be very many streams that happen in the weekdays before eight or unless they're before dinner

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
and then we could we're talking about four in the afternoon or five in the afternoon that's also possible in fact I expect that window to be pretty useful for basketball practice days

11:45.000 --> 11:54.000
but I think I'm officially starting another streak of streams right now which means that we could be looking at you know a few a few in a row

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
certainly daily and there very few are going to be in the morning most of them are going to be in the afternoon either before dinner or after dinner

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
in case it's not clear intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

12:10.000 --> 12:19.000
and transfection healthy humans is criminally negligent you either know how bad it is and you shouldn't recommend it for your patients

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
or you didn't know how bad it was and then you were criminally negligent this is my new sort of wording I'm trying to adjust this a little bit

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
so you could adjust it a little more and you could just say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

12:32.000 --> 12:42.000
with the intent of augmenting the immune system of healthy humans including transfection and transformation is criminally negligent

12:42.000 --> 12:52.000
there now we've got it I think that's pretty straightforward I don't think you need to have 40 doctors at a conference and spend four days on stage

12:52.000 --> 13:06.000
to try and explain the biological basis for this stance and I think that any biologists worth their salt in any field of academia any branch of academic investigation

13:06.000 --> 13:20.000
I invite you to come on my stream and challenge this notion come on this stream and explain why intramuscular injection is a really bright way of trying to augment the immune system

13:20.000 --> 13:32.000
and how it is that your combination of substances overcomes what is clearly in a broad sense one of the most ridiculous ideas we've ever applied in modern science

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
I know this seems like a really crazy stance to take but I have been ahead of this for a while and I'm afraid I'm ahead of this one as well

13:42.000 --> 13:57.000
I mean it's all of these excuses being made for when this might be appropriate or what we have to do to make intramuscular injection an appropriate way of augmenting the immune system but there is no way to do it

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
and there is a precise way of speaking about transfection and I think it's worth speaking about transfection in that precise way

14:06.000 --> 14:16.000
transfection of healthy humans is criminally negligent I think that's a great way to speak but if you want to make one statement not two I think we can also say it this way

14:16.000 --> 14:31.000
there is no useful way of augmenting the immune system via intramuscular injection it's just a dumb idea on its face and we should have known this many many many years ago and in fact I should edit that statement

14:31.000 --> 14:42.000
many people have known this for a very long time are my audio sync out okay well then we're just going to stop and start again if you guys don't mind because I just did this so

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
I'll start with this slide let me think here

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
yeah I'll just start with this slide right here I'll be right back see you soon

15:01.000 --> 15:20.000
how are we doing piano fab does this look better

15:20.000 --> 15:37.000
all right great so welcome to the show again this is giggle and biological high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist it's the 13th of November 2023 and we are still fighting

15:37.000 --> 15:54.000
in this same basic battle and battle really focuses on messaging precise messaging right now I think the main job of everybody that's in this theater is to obfuscate the truth

15:54.000 --> 16:11.000
and the truth that we've learned over the last three years is that the public health apparatus of America and around the world has been organized over the last couple decades to produce what is effectively a world wide theater

16:11.000 --> 16:30.000
and a worldwide theater designed to sort of invert the way that we think about our sovereignty and to start to make us think that mother nature presents so many different dangers that the only way that we can really exist as a global community is to submit to this public health apparatus

16:31.000 --> 16:41.000
and the way that we get rid of this idea the way that we fight this idea is to teach our children the biology which underpins these two statements right here there

16:42.000 --> 16:50.000
and the two statements are that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

16:50.000 --> 16:59.000
and more specifically for the context within which we find ourselves the transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent

17:00.000 --> 17:17.000
and we have to be very precise here because one of the current temptations has to do with criminal negligence but then the circumstances around which the legal establishment of that is being made is a false one

17:18.000 --> 17:27.000
and again this is about trying to make sure that we don't ask the correct questions because the correct questions are the way that we escape

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
and so as long as we keep chasing down the wrong villains and pull in the masks off of the wrong people then we're never going to solve this mystery

17:36.000 --> 17:57.000
but it is the act of unmasking these people it is the act of having solved the mystery of the lab leak that has bamboozled the entire globe into thinking that we did have a pandemic of a novel virus that millions of people died from it but millions more were saved

17:58.000 --> 18:14.000
and then gain a function is real and probably the source of this pandemic and therefore it's likely to come again that's a faith that we have been bamboozled into believing through the use of bad language and bad theater

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system of a healthy human

18:24.000 --> 18:34.000
including transfection and transformation is criminally negligent and I say it a little differently here because I guess there is a way where you might want to augment the immune system of a sick human

18:36.000 --> 18:47.000
to try and make that sick humans immune system fight off cancer better that's a pretty limited thing that is not a healthy human it's a human that's going to die anyway

18:48.000 --> 18:56.000
and so there are limited uses for it but if you if you use precise language we can describe exactly that which we object to

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
and I would argue that a lot of these people in the intellectual dark web although they talk really big with their big words like heterodoxy

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
they actually speak very imprecisely about the exact things the exact ideas

19:14.000 --> 19:30.000
from which our enchantment is constructed and we are indeed enchanted by these people enchanted by the ideas that they have woven together in a false reality

19:31.000 --> 19:40.000
it is a illusion of consensus that is created by these ideas that they have woven together with the help of social media with the help of mainstream media

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
and a coordinated effort by themselves not to question the faith in a novel virus that killed millions of people but also millions of people were saved from

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
and likely came from gain of function and therefore will come again

19:57.000 --> 20:06.000
and so I've been finding out about the intellectual dark web and how coordinated they have been how on message they've been in real time

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
and in fact two years too late because I thought Brett Weinstein was kind of a hero for a while

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I thought he was actually listening to me

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
I even thought that him casually mentioning my name every once in a while on the stream was somehow him finally giving me attention

20:23.000 --> 20:31.000
little did I know that he's never retweeted anything he's never really promoted a website or a link that would get anybody to me he's never spelled my name

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
he's never shown a picture and he certainly never had me on his podcast

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
we're just talking about a lot of liars here ladies and gentlemen I don't know who's lying and who doesn't know better

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
and I'm not going to make any accusations like that but I'm quite I'm quite certain

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
the vast majority of people that have been elevated in social media that have risen during the pandemic

20:58.000 --> 21:06.000
even risen through censorship these people have been artificially so and their rise is far from organic

21:09.000 --> 21:21.000
in much the same way that people like Mark Hewson tonic Mark Coolack after four years of producing consistent output on YouTube still has like what six thousand followers

21:22.000 --> 21:35.000
and it's not for a lack of consistency or lack of integrity or anything like that it's for artificially the spread of the information is artificially hampered

21:36.000 --> 21:46.000
dominoes are taken out of the train in random places and it prevents the natural spread of the information by attention and excitement

21:47.000 --> 21:59.000
and I think that actually people imagine that one part of this equation happens but the other part doesn't when in reality both happen

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
and actually it's more important that those dominoes are taken out of the way so that even when people share your work it doesn't catch

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
that's much more important level of control in the on the algorithm level than it is to say artificially inflate somebody because if it's garbage

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
if it's garbage information it's not going to have the it's not going to have the inertia that that truth has

22:29.000 --> 22:38.000
in fact that's why a lot of these people that are involved in the intellectual dark web need to deal in a soup of truth and untruth

22:39.000 --> 22:51.000
half truth and bad questions because they have to walk very carefully around the truth so that it feels genuine from some superficial standpoint

22:52.000 --> 23:05.000
and there are other players and other layers that are responsible for a similar part of the total effect of the worst case scenario team

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
is the best way that I can describe them everybody in the intellectual dark web everybody in all the corners of the internet

23:13.000 --> 23:23.000
all the people that got little help on social media and most of the people who seem to get tips in the beginning of the pandemic about a fear and cleavage site

23:24.000 --> 23:34.000
or about the effectiveness of remdesivir and they were months ahead of these sort of crucial notions of the worst case scenario being possible

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
the worst case scenario being a lab leak possible you know ridiculous infectiousness of a virus that had a fear and cleavage site

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
these cartoon stories and mythologies were seeded very early on in several different places and several different heads and several different corners on the internet

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
and people were allowed to write books about these ideas in order to amplify them early as one side of a narrative

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
and you had to figure out by removing the masks of these bad guys by catching them in lies by reading their partially redacted emails

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
you were supposed to feel like you were solving the puzzle

24:16.000 --> 24:26.000
and yet none of these people in all of their research were ever able to find this article from 2004

24:27.000 --> 24:36.000
where they just say the silent stuff out loud in their introduction nobody nobody in the intellectual dark web

24:37.000 --> 24:51.000
not Sam Harris or Brett Weinstein or Kevin McCann or Charles Ricksey or Andrew Huff or Robert Malone or where were all these people

24:52.000 --> 25:01.000
why aren't they bringing up the fact that the head of the National Cancer Institute and his postdoc wrote a article about

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
from genome to vaccine where they state the market for vaccines is driven by perception not by actual need

25:10.000 --> 25:18.000
so unlike pharmaceuticals for which present illness drives demand it is the perception of risk of diseases that creates a desire for vaccination

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
this is written in 2004 this is what they say behind closed doors when they admit that this is a business

25:32.000 --> 25:40.000
when they admit that yeah you know water sanitation washing hands and soap and this kind of stuff yeah it made a big difference

25:41.000 --> 25:49.000
yeah aseptic technique that made a big difference yep antibiotics huge difference yep better medicine better treatments

25:50.000 --> 25:59.000
better food better nutrition all made a big difference yep yep but in front of the camera and in front of the grant committee

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
they usually say that well you know vaccines are the best thing ever you know it's like the pyramids and vaccines and airplanes

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
best inventions like just a short list

26:13.000 --> 26:22.000
and so that's how you can tell that these people are full of it that's how you can tell if you look at somebody like Peter McCullough who's come from

26:23.000 --> 26:34.000
you know being full blown allopathic just mainstream doctor to being on podcasts now saying that if he was raising a kid now he wouldn't have any vaccines in that kid

26:35.000 --> 26:47.000
now that's progress that's growth that's realizing the reality in front of you and the consequences of all of the data points that you have in front of you

26:48.000 --> 27:00.000
there's no other conclusion to come to and it's really important to realize that in this Scooby-Doo everybody's going to have to come to their own realization of how bad it is

27:01.000 --> 27:16.000
and when Peter McCullough was on my stream he hadn't yet come that far he might have come that far in private but not in person and everybody I'm predicting everybody is going to have to come that far

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
and if you don't make it you will be part of the trap you will be part of the reason why humanity is lost

27:25.000 --> 27:39.000
because coming to that realization that realization that is that is really described perfectly by Peter McCullough saying that you know if I was to start all over again and have kids again I don't think I would I would forgo the vaccine schedule

27:40.000 --> 27:53.000
so that's giant and right now the Scooby-Doo and all of the people who have perpetuated the Scooby-Doo on us whatever the right word is enacted it in order to fool our children

27:54.000 --> 28:03.000
those people are in their last place the theater is a visible thing now the bricks are visible some of the lights are out

28:04.000 --> 28:21.000
some of the theater lights have come on and so the the production is being exposed it's really just a question of how stubborn is the majority of the members of the audience and how can we force them to see it to acknowledge it

28:22.000 --> 28:34.000
that we were duped that we were duped by our whole government by that even that performance by Rand Paul and Tony Fauci in 2020 was a duping they did that to us

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
that wasn't two guys acting like good guys trying to do their best to figure it out and Tony was lying to Rand

28:45.000 --> 29:01.000
that was a performance that was a carefully orchestrated performance and it was designed to do exactly what it did solidify the support for Fauci on all the people who were on his team

29:02.000 --> 29:10.000
and solidify the support against or the opposition to Fauci in this the suspicion of a lab leak cover up on the other side

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
and make both of those teams convinced that they are right

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
it was the one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
and as I watched it live I knew it was baloney

29:25.000 --> 29:35.000
but I couldn't quite understand how the baloney was being used I couldn't understand it as a Scooby-Doo that they were fooling an entire planet

29:36.000 --> 29:48.000
into thinking that they were catching a liar or that a hero was being mistreated and no matter which narrative you chose you lose

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
because then you have chosen that there is a novel virus it's definitely killing a lot of people we definitely need to do something

29:56.000 --> 30:04.000
it's probably going to function it could come again you accepted it all we including me accepted it all

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
and we spent two years arguing about that

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
well a lot of us did I spent about four months arguing about that before I realized that that argument meant nothing

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
because the biology of coronavirus the biology of RNA viruses doesn't support the idea of a pandemic

30:25.000 --> 30:34.000
it doesn't support the idea of a uniformly spreading RNA signal over multiple years and multiple waves

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
there's no support for this there's no biological basis for this other than the stories that are told and introductions

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
and discussions of a few science papers scientific papers around the world that's it

30:48.000 --> 31:00.000
you can't even really find the biology that supports this in a in anything but but an introduction where they are where they are waxing intellectual about things that don't exist

31:01.000 --> 31:11.000
but what we're starting to learn from this pattern and I think it's really important to see this what we're learning from this pattern is that we may have been governed like this for many decades

31:12.000 --> 31:25.000
and they just have lied about other things in the same way that we're starting to wake up to the idea that what if what if other government proceedings have been performances

31:26.000 --> 31:36.000
what if other government scandals have been performances what if other other government controversies have been performances

31:37.000 --> 31:48.000
and that's where this whole narrative starts to fall apart that's where we as Americans need to start to take responsibility for governing our country again

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
we've got to take responsibility and take back our republic again

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
because we can't expect them to do it because remember the people that coming to the rescue are also part of the show

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
until we are rescuing ourselves we are allowing the show to continue

32:13.000 --> 32:22.000
I want you to watch this video again because I want to remind you of the kind of semantic war that they are waging on us

32:23.000 --> 32:38.000
the big problem in vaccines has been that while it's been possible in the past to make vaccines against viruses that cause acute self-limited infections

32:39.000 --> 32:46.000
that's mostly been done by making either an attenuated or killed virus

32:47.000 --> 32:59.000
which induces an immune response that mimics the immune response that you get to the natural infection because the natural infection will give you lifelong or at least long lasting immunity

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
but now what's left are viruses that cause chronic infections or cancer that causes chronic disease

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
where the disease itself does not induce an adequate response to get protection

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
so now the vaccine has to be better than the virus or the cancer itself

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
so we have to develop new ways again

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
so it's very important to see how deceptive what he just said is

33:27.000 --> 33:34.000
and it is actually one of the best soundbite examples that I've ever found of this particular point

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
which is really pervasive across this whole narrative

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
the idea is that we can augment the immune system to respond to any disease

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
it's the immune system we have to augment

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
it can't be and therefore we use the word vaccine to describe the intent to augment the immune system

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
and so what they have done is essentially cast an enchantment

34:06.000 --> 34:17.000
wherein the use of the word vaccine or the characterization of something as a disease implies a certain rubric of faith

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
if I call it a disease that means there must be a cure

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
if I call it a disease that means there might be a vaccine

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
if I call it a disease you need my medicine

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
now we I think this is a really important point to make even if I'm beating a dead horse here

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
but it's really it's a it's a distinction that we are allowing them to blur

34:45.000 --> 34:54.000
where actually vaccine and this is how he said it

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
traditionally vaccines were made of a weakened or a dead virus

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
and it mimicked the infection well enough so that the

35:07.000 --> 35:20.000
immunity produced by the vaccine was equivalent to or very close to equivalent to protection from exposure to the disease or infection itself

35:21.000 --> 35:29.000
the immune memory that's generated by infection was very similar to the immune memory generated by the live attenuated vaccine

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
but we can't make a live attenuated vaccine against cancer

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
we can't make a live attenuated vaccine against a genetic disorder

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
we can't make a live attenuated vaccine against diabetes

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
but if we call diabetes a disease now we can you know all diseases have potentially a vaccine

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
it's just that this disease doesn't produce an adequate immune response

35:57.000 --> 36:06.000
you see he's he's suggesting something based on an assumption that is not biologically proven

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
that cancer for example is always caused by viruses so because cancer is a disease caused by a pathogen

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
and you are the host then you need a vaccine to prevent that pathogen from causing disease in you

36:22.000 --> 36:30.000
but it's a surprisingly small number of cancers which are associated directly with causally to a virus

36:33.000 --> 36:42.000
and when we try to make a vaccine against a cancer we're actually trying to point T cell memory at a protein which is unique for the cancer

36:43.000 --> 36:53.000
it's not a failure of the immune system so much as usually a camouflage of the cancer because the cancer is made of self cells

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
so the immune system can't really see it

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
so this is a very deceptive language bait and switch that has been going on for decades that they have been working for decades

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
and it probably all goes all the way back to as far as Robert Gallo and Murray Gardner

37:13.000 --> 37:22.000
and all of these people like David Baltimore who were involved in the early stages of HIV retroviruses

37:22.000 --> 37:28.000
and cancer causing viruses in this whole theory of what viruses do

37:29.000 --> 37:42.000
and so what I'm suggesting to you is that this mythology was purposefully created over many decades

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
so that the public health exercise that we've been through for the last three years was possible

37:51.000 --> 37:59.000
and they almost, this almost was derailed, it was almost derailed once on 9-11

38:00.000 --> 38:08.000
and you'll have to watch Usatonic Live and look at his long catalogue of this to understand what I'm suggesting here

38:08.000 --> 38:16.000
but it could be that 9-11 was supposed to be a biological attack and somehow or another it ended up to be just a terrorist attack

38:21.000 --> 38:31.000
and anyway the point is that we have been on a long progression, a long plan to controlled demolish America

38:32.000 --> 38:42.000
and I think David Griffin could also tell us a lot about the financial aspects of this controlled demolition of the American system

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
and the freedom that it represents, the Constitution itself is going to be under assault

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
once the financial and societal fabric starts to rip

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
and if we want to address this problem it's going to have to rip

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
we're going to have to come together as a country in a different way than we are now

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
and love our neighbors in a way that we are not doing now

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
in order for America to make it through on the other side as America in some new form

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
based on truth and justice and the American way

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
whatever that used to be

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
so vaccination is a methodology that will work as a methodology, excuse me, that will work on everything

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and that's the argument that he's making now

39:30.000 --> 39:40.000
he's making it with the words that he wants to use in order so that we transfer the value of vaccination to as much disease as possible

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
in fact he is exercising this enchantment of

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
if I say disease, you say cure, disease, cure, disease, cure

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
if I say disease, you say vaccine, vaccine, disease, disease, vaccine

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
it's an enchantment

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
and he might only be reciting it because he's under this enchantment

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
but I think that at a certain moment

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
you as an academic and academic magician

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
you become smart enough to know that this sales pitch is that what it is, it's a sales pitch

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
and if you're making a sales pitch about vaccines it's a little different

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
than making a sales pitch about your little niche research that you know isn't going to save the world

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
but it's really important for you to study the pigmentation

40:30.000 --> 40:39.000
and chemical steps in the chloroplast function in a particular diatom

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
and you know that that's not really important

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
but you talk it really up in your introduction

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
and when you're interviewing for a faculty job

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
but that's your passion, that's your biology

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
and so you exaggerate a little bit

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
you know these diatoms are found all around the oceans

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
and they're important in every ecosystem that has salt water

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
and they're responsible for converting more than you know gigatons of carbon every year

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
but nobody cares about diatoms

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
but you're not selling anything

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
you're not misleading the young into believing something that's not true

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
you're not contributing to the governance of an entire society by lies

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
you're just really enthusiastic about your biology

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
and you want people to understand how important it is to the collective whole

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
but when you're a biologist who's saying something like this guy saying

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
you've got to know that this is a sales pitch of BS

41:38.000 --> 41:50.000
that is doing an end around the traditional idea of how a drug or a pharmaceutical is brought to market safely

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
and that your intention is to inject anything you want intramuscularly

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
with the intent of augmenting the immune system with no responsibility for when it goes wrong

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
and you know that the only way that you can get away with doing this

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
and have a hope of making something of this genetic technology work

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
is if you get people to allow you to do it

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
not everybody in this machine knows exactly how bad it is

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
but everybody in this machine knows exactly that it's bad

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
that it's lies

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
that it's gross exaggerations

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
that there are thousands and billions and millions and billions of dollars

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
exchanging hands

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
based on these exaggerations

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
these oversimplifications

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and so he can look into the camera

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
and with his fancy pink lanyardon with his sudon

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
with his NIH job

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
and talk all this stuff with these words

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and be as imprecise as he wants to

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
knowing full well that what he is doing is casting an enchantment

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
he is enchanting everyone in the future

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
as part of this illusion of consensus

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
that these are diseases and all diseases have cures

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
and the best cures are vaccines

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
it's a really simple enchantment

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
all these things are diseases

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
diseases have cures and cures the best ones we have are vaccines

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
so I work on vaccines

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis C for example

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
and I think more and more strategies are being developed to target those

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
very similar to the ones I just talked about for cancer vaccines

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
and I think hopefully within the next 5 to 10 years

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
we will have vaccines for those diseases

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
but of course at this point that's hope

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
that's not nothing guaranteed, not promised

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I think one is

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
and it's very similar to saying that this diagram means nothing

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
that we can effectively ignore this diagram

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
just like we can ignore any possible safety signals in

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
transfection and healthy children

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
we can ignore this diagram

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
and we can also ignore these people

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
right?

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
we can ignore these people

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I have a lot of people that made graphics

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
designs for the trailer

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
from all over Canada and Australia

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
but it was just about junior

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
I said no this trailer is not about just junior

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I said it's about junior and all the vaccine injured

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
that we have because there's thousands of it

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
people look at the trailer and they'll tell me

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
that's a lot of people I said no it's not

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
that's not even a little bit

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
I said there's more

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I said I would need 18 wheelers

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
to put everyone's picture on it

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
that thing is

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I don't want to make the pictures too small

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I want people to actually be able to see the faces

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
of each person that's on here

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
my whole mission now

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
you know bring awareness to all the families

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
because I don't want to get any emails

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
text messages anymore

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I get them from all over the world

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't need to be proud of it

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
juniorsguardianvoices.com

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
and juniorsguardianvoices.com

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I walked to that side door

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I was sitting up in a

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
it was like a life-size picture

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
and I started crying because I could almost

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
feel like I could hug them

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
and I was thinking I'd be proud of it

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
if I don't do what I'm doing

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I can hear them telling me

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
you know you need to practice what you preach

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
so that's why I have to keep doing this

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
thanks for putting that link in there

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
well it's about the first year

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I was ready to give up

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I didn't think I was accomplishing anything

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I didn't think it was getting out there

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
and for some reason I was going through my file box

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
and I found a father state card

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
the last of my last father state card

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
and now I just started crying

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
for probably about three or four hours on the couch

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
I figured that was his way of telling me to

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
don't give up

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
to keep up fighting

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
and that's the same one I have on the back of my motorcycle

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I figured well

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I found it

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I got to put it on my bike

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
to remind me why I'm doing this

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
he cried when he talked about his son

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
because you don't lose his son

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and stop crying about it

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I can cry about it

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I don't have a loss to son

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I just have them

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
you only have to have them to know

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
that this guy might possibly be feeling

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
and I show this video

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
not only because I want you to know about his website

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but I really want you to see

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
that this guy is organized around everybody

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
he wants all these peoples justice

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
and I think we need to really

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
start to think this way

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
that in order for this to work

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
we've all got to come together

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
at juniorsguardianvoice.com

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
then we've got to come together there

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
but we've got to find ways

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
to make sure that everybody

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
who was injured by this

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
transfection and transformation

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
roll out

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
nowhere to report

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
their injuries and that they do it

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
that everyone who lost someone

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
to transfection and transformation

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
is

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
bringing these numbers to account

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
because there are people who probably

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
need to reflect again

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
ok when did grandma die

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
when did she die

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and what did they say she died of

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
there are a lot of people

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
who haven't asked that question yet

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
there are a lot of people

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
who haven't asked that question yet

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
that had people die in the hospital

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
who haven't asked that question yet

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
that might need to ask the protocol question

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
we've got a lot of work to do ladies and gentlemen

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
because this illusion of consensus

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
is not going away

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
these players are not going away

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
they won't leave us alone

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
they're still here

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
they've still got millions of followers

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
they've still got substacks

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
that earn $50,000 a week

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
they're still doing podcasts

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
four or five times a day

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
sometimes

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
these people are still traveling

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
the world

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and they are still pushing this

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
DNA idea

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
we covered a

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
really important stream

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
a few days before I quit

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
it was a Canadian

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
children's health defense

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
chapter interviewing

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
the hero from Canada

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Byron brittle

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
who had his

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
career basically destroyed

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
because he found a document

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
from the Japanese Pfizer

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
trials showing

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
or the Japanese

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
paperwork submitted

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
by Pfizer

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm showing that the

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
the transfection agent

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
and if you

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
transfected luciferase in this case

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
they could see glow-in-the-dark protein

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
all around the body

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
and it didn't stay in the muscle

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and he reported this very early

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
and really really really

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
suffered for it

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and two years later

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
we have the inventor

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
of the lipid nanoparticle technology

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Peter Kullis

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
giving a celebratory lecture

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
regarding the garden near prize

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
in Canada

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
a sort of pre-noble prize

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
where he just casually answers questions

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
at the end where he says

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
yeah I ruined the career

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
or burnt out five postdocs

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
trying to figure out

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
how to target these lipids

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
to particular places in the body

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
and we never succeeded

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
or at least 20 years away from figuring that out

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
but of course the one of the

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
primary assumptions of

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
the effectiveness of the vaccine

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
was that it stayed in the muscle

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and that the expression

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
of the spike protein was

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
extremely temporary

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
and limited

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
but we know from their discussions

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
and their descriptions of their own work

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
that they optimized it for

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
maximum lifetime

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and maximum protein production

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
we really really really

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
need to understand that it's not

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
a matter of

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
what's true that counts anymore

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
but it's a matter of what is perceived to be true

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and that these people have been

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
actively trying to

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
not let us understand

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
what is really true

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
and about the transfection

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
it must be understood

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I think that somebody like

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Sukhid Bhakti and I'm sure that my friend

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Mike Eden would also agree with me

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
when I say the transfection

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
in its purest form

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
is wholly inappropriate for

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
healthy humans

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
in its purest form

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
the best case scenario

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
you know the

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
the coffee artist

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
cappuccino the best

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
whatever you got

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
it's wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
it didn't get any good form

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
it's not going to be good form

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
it's definitely not going to be able to augment their immune system

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
now upscaling

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
from this beautiful perfect

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
purest form

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
of

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
transfection to

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
from nanograms to kilograms

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
introduced a whole host

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
of

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
quality control and production problems

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
that have never been adequately

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
explored as being conquered

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
you know have they really solved

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
all these problems or do they just go

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
from making one

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
good

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
grandma's apple pie

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
to 10,000 a day

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
and just tell us that these pies

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
are as good as the one that your grandma made

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
because

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
when your grandma makes a pie it is

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
the purest form

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
of transfection and it's a tasty pie

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
but you can't call that apple pie

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
a something that you can live on

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
it's not a nutritious meal

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
it's a dessert

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and so in its purest form

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
it is not a nourishing meal

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
it's an apple pie

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and if you take grandma's apple pie

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and you decide okay we're going to go from making one

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
to making 10,000 there are a lot of

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
a

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
lot of scaling up problems

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
that you need to conquer

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
in order to take grandma's perfect pie

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and make 10,000 of a

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
a day every day consistently

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and in fact

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
you can listen to Elon Musk

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
on Joe Rogan

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
not too long ago explaining

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
that making

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
a prototype of an electric car

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
is actually ridiculously easy

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and the problem is a thousand

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
times harder is

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
to scale up production

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
of the car

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
occasionally Elon Musk

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
says things that make sense and are

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
actually almost above high school level

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
intelligence and that's

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
in that entire interview one of the few

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
intelligent things that he said

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
that didn't just make him

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
sound like a clown

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
he made comments about the pizza

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
which was pretty good and he explained

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
that making a prototype electric car

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
is relatively easy

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
relative to figuring out how to

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
produce it

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
and this scaling up

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
from making

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
transfection in its purest form

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
to making billions of doses

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
in a given three-year period

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
has just been glossed over as

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
yeah sure we did it

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
no, no you didn't

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
there's no possible way you did

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
and that's what Mike Eden brought

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
to the table very early on

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
in this discussion

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
so the R&A had to be impure

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
it had to be impure

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
because even when they made it in its purest form

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
in the small batch

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
you know

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
grandma's pie scenario

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
the R&A

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
was still pretty

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
not pure

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and now

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
that they scaled it up using bacteria

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
now that they scaled it up using a different process

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
now that they scaled it up from

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
nanograms to kilograms

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
there's all kinds of impurities

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
related to the R&A and unrelated to the R&A

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
but related to its production

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
and

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
let's stay on the transfection itself

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
the R&A was codon optimized

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
which has a number of biological implications

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
for the protein that's produced

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
number one it won't be the protein

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
that's produced is because

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
although the codon optimization

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
is changing synonymous codons

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
synonymous codons are not synonymous

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
and we know this because many

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
genetic diseases

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
seem to be

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
based on silent mutations

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
in the gene that they are

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
correlated to

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
silent mutations aren't supposed to change

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
the protein but somehow silent

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
mutations are linked to an awful lot of genetic diseases

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and that is likely because

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
the silent mutations affect the translation

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
of the protein

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
the translation from R&A to protein

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
requires the ribosome to do stuff

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
that we don't understand

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
the ribosome is a mystery machine

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
the real mystery machine

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
in this Scooby-Doo is the ribosome

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
and

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
conquering figuring out how the ribosome

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
does what it does

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and how the variations in ribosomes

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
change what it does

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
and how the sequence of the R&A

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
even with synonymous codons

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
changes what the R&A does

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
in the ribosome

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
is a mystery

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
and you might think you know what a ribosome

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
is it's actually not a protein

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
it's a protein

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
R&A molecule hybrid

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that functionally forms this

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
enzyme machine thing called a ribosome

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
it's a pretty complicated thing

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
that we don't really understand

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that much about

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
and so when we codon optimize

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
the R&A we don't know exactly what we did

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
but we definitely changed how the R&A

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
will translate through any

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
given ribosome and any given tissue

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
because

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
codon optimizing changed

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
the amino acid

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
codons that are present

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
in the viral R&A

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
so it's not the same spike protein

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
in addition

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
because you know there's no

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
bell prize technology in this stuff

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
it was chemically altered

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and those chemical

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
alterations can change the way

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
that the ribosome interacts with the R&A

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
and it can redesalt

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
in premature stops

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
which would shorten the protein

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and it can result

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
in a wobble-based phenomenon

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
which basically means that the R&A

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
is not as specific

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
or a particular codon as it would be

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
when it has this pseudo-uridine present

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
it's like a wild card

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and so now

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
the ribosome can make errors of insertion

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
or errors of

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
substitution

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
and those errors

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
will necessarily have consequences

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
for the antigenic properties

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
of the protein

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
the folding of the protein

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
and potentially even the toxicity

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
of it

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
the worst part is these premature stops

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
create very small

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
R&As which small R&As

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
can have the potential to interfere

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
with our own endogenous R&As

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
so there's all kinds of possibilities that are opened up

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
by the fact that the R&As impure

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
the R&A was codon optimized

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
and chemically altered

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
it results in all this variability

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and all of this

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
extra R&A

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and extra R&As not handy

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
and it's not something that we can be imprecise about

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and yet there's no doubt

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
because of one and two and three

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
that we are not precise here

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
so the protein produced is uncharacterized

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
and highly variable again because of three, four and five

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
that means that the immune response

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
that's being generated by this bouquet of variability

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
is not very predictable either

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
it's pretty predictable from the standpoint

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
of when they tell you to check it this way

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
yeah sure it works

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
that's like saying you know

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
did you use the car last night

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
to your teenage daughter

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
and she says no I didn't

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
well what's your proof?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
well you know look in the driver's seat

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
there's no Chick-fil-A

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
is that proof?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
and in this case what we're talking about here

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
is them saying something like well

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
you know the spike protein works

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
I mean when we use our own assay

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
to test whether there's any spike protein produced by the M R&A

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
our assay says it works great

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
well if your daughter's assay

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
for whether she used the car or not

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
is the one that's in the car

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
if your daughter's assay for whether she used the car or not

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
is the one that you accept

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
then she can say yeah there's no Chick-fil-A in the front seat

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
so obviously I didn't use the car

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
and then you got to go oh I guess you're right

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
you didn't use the car

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
well we used our test

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
to find that spike protein is produced

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
when we when we transfect cells in a dish

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
so obviously it works right

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
it's the same argument

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
it's the same level of proof

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
and so the LNP was never really tested in humans

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
for long or short-term effects

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
we just take the word of Peter Cullis

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that it works great

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
but we can't really target it anywhere

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
endotoxins from process two

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
those are the bacteria

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and the remnants of the bacteria

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
after they've been lised

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
you can't clean that up very well

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and again it's compounded by the fact

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
that you're not making small batch

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
you're making large batch

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and in that large batch

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
it's even harder to get contaminants out

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
when you're rushing it out

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
when you're bottling

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
millions of small vials

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
there's all kinds of variability

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
potential there again

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
these are all compounding problems

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and we still haven't really gotten

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
to the double-stranded fragments

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
from process one until right now

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
at number nine

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and so my argument is

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
hopefully I'm not too far from the microphone right now

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
but the argument is

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
is that number nine

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
is one of many many many reasons

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
to reject

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
transfection in healthy humans

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
the first one being

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
the transfection in its purest form

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
is wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and number one

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
is the reason why they were criminally negligent

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
not number nine

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
they are criminally negligent

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
because they have known that

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
transfection in its purest form

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
would be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
they have known that upscaling

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
from nanograms to kilograms

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
was going to be a disaster

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
they have known that the RNA was impure

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
they have known that the codon optimizing

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
would cause variability

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
they couldn't predict

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
they have known that chemically

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
altering this mRNA would cause it to last

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
much longer than intended

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and could even produce small fragments of RNA

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
that could interfere with our own endogenous transcripts

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
they have known

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
that the protein is wholly uncharacterized

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
as a prodrug and should have definitely been treated as such

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
they have known that the LNP

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
was not tested adequately in humans

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and so the criminal negligence

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
that we need to be targeting

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
is not number nine

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and we are being misled

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
that number nine is our opening

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
number nine is our big window

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
or is the spike toxic

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
maybe that's our big window

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
maybe we should be angry because they chose the wrong protein

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
we were being told that for more than a year

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
we were being told that the spike is toxic

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and that we chose the wrong protein

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
for a year

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and the only reason why we are still not being told

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
that very thing is because of giga ohm biological

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
that's what I believe

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and so this list is important to understand

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
because this is the argument that I want to make

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
repeatedly over the next weeks

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
until Christmas until the new year

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and I believe

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
wittingly or unwittingly

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
these people are involved in sustaining that

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
they are involved in sustaining this

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
imaginary tunnel we're in

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
where there was a novel virus

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
that killed millions of people

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
but thank goodness we saved millions too

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and gain a function obviously is real

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
because these people were lying about it

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
covering it up by mean man oh man

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
it's obvious now

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and so we've got to be careful because the virus

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
will definitely come again

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and we cannot let our children

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
grow up in this world

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
but it is

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
keeping the narrative alive

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
the show must go on and it's not a matter of what true

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that counts it's a matter of what's perceived to be true

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
so these people are still working

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Paul Offitt is still working

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and the Twiv crew is still working

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
so I wanted to watch a little bit of Twiv tonight

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
because I think it's fun to watch these guys

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and this episode has a number of different papers

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that they cover in it

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
but the paper that I wanted to look at

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
is an HPV paper

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
where they look at viral prevalence

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and they make some argument about the HPV vaccine

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
so I will be very honest

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I didn't know a lot about the HPV vaccine

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
until I saw Vaxxed too

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and it was actually just in time

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
for me not to give it to my children

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
the first time that it was offered to my boys

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
we were already knew not to say it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
not to take it

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
but it is very disturbing to me

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
that they are now pushing the HPV vaccine harder than ever

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and these kinds of disingenuous arguments are being made

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and really ridiculous statements like

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
HPV vaccines are a great way to prevent cancer

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and this is just not true

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
it's not proven, it's not shown, it's not measured

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
it's never been observed

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and in the cases where it is purported to be observed

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
great mathematical feats of ridiculousness

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
are needed in order to create the illusion of a data set

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
which gives the signal that they purported gives

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and that's what this Twiv is about

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
is about this cell micro paper

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
where they say that they looked at

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
many different communities in Finland

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
a total of 16,000 young people from age 18 to 22

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
and they measured the prevalence of several HPV virus

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
serotypes in these individuals

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
four years and eight years after vaccination

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and purport to compare the vaccination schemes

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
across these communities

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and the communities that they say are represented

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
are an unvaccinated communities

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
communities where the vaccine was targeted to girls

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and communities where the vaccine was targeted to boys and girls

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and using a general linear model

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
and some other mathematical techniques to generate synthetic data

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
they claim that in the

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
populations where they have vaccinated both boys and girls

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
they see an effect on the ecology

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
of the hepatitis viruses

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
that they meet in these adults

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
that they are able to record in these adults

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
so what we're going to watch is these four

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
individuals digest this paper in real time

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
they're supposed to have read it, it's supposed to be a journal club

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
but in reality when you hear the absolute

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
it's only can be described as shameful

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
that all three of these people purport to be

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
a career academic biologist with decades of experience

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
none of these people on the screen are claiming less than

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
less experience than me and most of them I would assume

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
are claiming more experience than me in virology

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
and in biology in general

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
so every one of these people should be my academic

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and intellectual elder

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and yet you're going to hear how

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
absolutely elementary

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and naive they speak

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
of these

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
things that are portrayed as certainties by the CDC

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
by the FDA, by the WHO, by everyone

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
by the entire public health apparatus

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
that is responsible for this illusion of consensus

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and they even actually get confused because they realize

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that wow there's a lot of

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
there's a lot of hand waving here

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and Vincent tries to pull the

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
shoot a little bit and keep them on topic

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
but the guy in the upper right is sure not buying it

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
and the guy in the lower right really tries to save the day too

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
but I mean it's just an exposure like none other

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
so let's check this out

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I don't know how long I'm taking here

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I'm probably really already

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
hours and hours on

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
here we go

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
so I starting it at

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
2358 because they read some other paper beforehand

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and it's only going to be about 15 minutes

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
we're not going to listen to the whole thing

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I'm just going to listen to this paper

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
and I'm going to listen at one and a half speed

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
and then we'll close it out

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
you know because that's how we're going to do it

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
we're going to do dailies

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
we're going to try and just keep

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
singing the same song

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and if you don't like it

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
well that's tough

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
because the same song needs singing at this point

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
we need to keep repeating stuff

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
until people get it

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
what is behind me?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
there's a wrinkle in my

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
in my green screen

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
it's making some annoying

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
like there we go

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
alright that's better

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
oh good mistakes

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
let's play

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
yeah there was only two in the ellipsis

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
it was three dots but only two names

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
oh I read the main title

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
with all the authors

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
yeah okay

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
one two three four five six seven eight

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
yeah okay yeah the ellipsis

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I didn't read that right

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
okay human papillomavirus

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
now these are DNA viruses

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
oh wait what did I say?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
human icosahedral capsid

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
okay so here you go you can already see

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
where I'm just not

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
human papillomavirus is HPV vaccine

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I apologize what was I saying

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
hepatitis like that's crazy

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
that's the one they give at birth

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
and they give it other types too

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
so I apologize already for that ball drop

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
HPV is human papillomavirus

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and those are the viruses

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that are blamed for cervical cancer

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and uterine cancer

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and all kinds of other genital cancers

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and so that's what we're talking about here

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
and it's a niche

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
for cervical cancer

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
which is just ridiculous right

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
for a number of biological reasons

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
it's imprecise use of language

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
that's really burning me up lately

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
but it's it's burning me up

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
because it's become obvious

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that that's not only what drove me nuts

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
when I was in academic biology

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
as a neurobiologist

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
but it's what really drives me nuts

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
about how we've moved through this pandemic

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
it's with imprecise language

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
it is making things stupid complicated

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
or dumb simple when it's inappropriate

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
to the point where people

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
are completely bamboozled

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
they're misled

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and they think they understand something

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
that has been made dumb

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
simple or stupid complicated

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
and they don't

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and these people are going to

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
inadvertently or unwittingly admit

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
that they don't understand this either

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and it's sad

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
because you can see them struggle

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
through the mud

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
like wow I really don't get it

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I mean it doesn't make sense

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
but I guess we've got to accept it

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
because we're a virologist

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and this is a virology paper

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
brains and they are

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
there are lots of them

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
there are many different types

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and many of them are associated

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
with producing warts

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and humans

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
for human papilloma viruses

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
of course are rabbit papilloma viruses as well

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but in humans some of the types

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
are associated with cancers

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
such as cervical cancer, anal cancer,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and also oral pharyngeal cancer

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and a number of years ago

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
vaccines were developed

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
to specifically prevent these cancers

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and they're very good at doing that

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
they're interesting vaccines

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
because they're virus-like particles

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
there's a genome in them

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
the main capsid protein is produced in

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
like yeast or insect cells

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
it assembles into a particle

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
it's mixed with an adjuvant

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and they're very good at preventing cancers

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
so they've been widely adopted

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and of course the best time to give them

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
is before people become sexually active

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
so you don't acquire these viruses naturally

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
which is when they become a problem

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
so you can prevent disease by vaccinating

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
so it's weird because he says

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
that you prevent disease by vaccinating

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and it's better to vaccinate people younger

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
because you acquire these viruses

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
through sexual activity

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000
so the idea is apparently

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
that you don't have any of these viruses

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
until you start sleeping with people

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
but where do those people get them?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
basically already the biology is off the rails

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
basically he's already telling you

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
in a minimal mythology story

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
that has no basis in reality

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and you can just dissect it

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
with common sense

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and it's extraordinary really

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
how accepted

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and accepting

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
the three of these people are

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
as he says these ridiculous things

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
that they're really good at preventing cancer

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and that giving them early

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
is the way they work the best

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
because you get these viruses

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
through sexual activity

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
so we have to give the vaccine

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
before the sexual activity starts

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I mean how these things are connected

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
in his mind is just

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
it's bewildering to me

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
that they can even speak these words out loud

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and not be disgusted with themselves

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
because you have to know that these are lies

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
you have to know that these are gross

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
oversimplifications of something that we obviously know

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
is a lot more complicated than this

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
so there are lots and lots of stereotypes of these

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
but it's only a few of them

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
that account for the overwhelming majority

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
essentially all of the cancers

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and that's 16 and 18

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
HPV 16 and HPV 18

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
are the targets of the vaccine that they're looking at here

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
31 and 45, too

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
31 and 40

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
oops 31 and 45, too

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
so I guess I don't know what I'm talking about at all

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
but I read the paper and I'm really smart

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
5, too, that's right

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
and the question I have is with all those types

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
does this vaccine come?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
There's also a

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
9-valent

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
vaccine, Gardasil 9

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
in the paper

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
so really we're looking at

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
4 academic scientists

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
with their own podcast that's already funded

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
that has a studio

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
and staff in Manhattan

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
that's on their thousandth episode

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and they still don't have the basic biology

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
of human papilloma virus

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
one of the most successful

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and successful products

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
of the Merck company

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
they have no idea

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
they have no concept

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
they don't feel any obligation

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
and any responsibility to be

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
informed about it

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
even as they hope that they get a million views

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
even as they think

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
that they are working with Earth's

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
virology teacher

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
understand how

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
despicable this is

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
no

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
31 and 45, too

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
31 and 45, too

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
that's right

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
the question I have is with all those types

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
does this vaccine cover all them as well?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
no

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
if you get the vaccine

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
are you susceptible still to the ones

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
that they didn't include into the vaccine?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
yes

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and there's not 100 serotypes

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
there are more than 200 serotypes

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
of the human papilloma virus

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
and the best vaccine

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Gardasil 9

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
purports to target

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
9 of those serotypes

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
now if you're not aware

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
about how a niche works

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
a niche is for a single species

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and species compete to occupy a niche

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
if two species

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
can occupy the same niche

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
it's not really a niche anymore

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and yet we're going to

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
argue and discuss

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
the use of these terms

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and whether or not it's appropriate for

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
something that's actually not even alive

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
that's actually doesn't have

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
species but has a quasi-species

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
swarm

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
and that can generate new variants

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
through recombination

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and generates new variants

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
through consistent replication errors

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
they are

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
completely off their skis here

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and careening

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
into a ditch

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and the only thing that they can do

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
is do it as gracefully as possible

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
in hopes that the vast majority

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
of their viewers

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
are unsophisticated enough

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
to see the train wreck

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
for what it is

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
the one that really has trouble

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
with it is Alan Dove

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
down here in the bottom

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
he's really having glitch outs

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
you know like I've got to argue

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
for the mythology

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
that I believe in

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
even though the guy above me here

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
is really really

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
hitting home runs

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I've got to make fun of this old man

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
we're going to all collectively make fun of this old man

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
so that in the end

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
the illusion of consensus

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
will be sustained

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
watch this train wreck

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but they've included in the vaccines

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the highest risk types right

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
so you know

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
as was mentioned actually

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
included into the vaccine

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
if you get the vaccine are you susceptible

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
still to the ones that they didn't include

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
into the vaccine? Yes

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
but they've included in the vaccines

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the highest risk types right

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
so you know as was mentioned

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
actually so there's a nine-valent

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
HPV vaccine which has the most different types

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
it covers 611, 16, 18, 33,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
45, 52 and 58

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
right so it's been updated over the years the original was 16 and 18

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
which are the big really bad ones and then they've

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
kind of punched down the list

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
getting more and more and this nine-valent

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I guess is the latest iteration that

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
why is he even talking

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
five minutes ago he said that this

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
this vaccine that they're talking about

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
in this paper targeted two

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
of the 200 plus

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
zero-zero types

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
then

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
the lady over here corrects him and says

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
no there's two more

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
and finally we say well yeah there's also

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
a nine-valent one

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and then he pipes in and says

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
oh yeah well yeah this is the way it is

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
because that's how these people have a discussion

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
that's how they think discussion

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
goes

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
is some kind of

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
agreement festival

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
oh yes you're right I agree with you and repeat

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
what they said

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
that's not discussion

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
that's not science happening

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
this isn't a guy who's on his game

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
this is a guy who's posing

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
there's no other way to see it

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
he should be ashamed of himself

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
that he should have said wow I

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
didn't realize this because I just started by saying there's only two

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
targeted

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I mean

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
how is it even possible

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
that people take this seriously

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
other than the fact that we have been

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
misled for decades

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
it's the only way to explain it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
um that takes out

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
or generates antibodies against a larger panel

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
so Vincent would you

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
summarize that what is the goal of this research

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
so he made another assumption there

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
he said that this

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
listen he says that this

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and this nine-valent I guess is the latest iteration

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
that takes out or generates

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
antibodies against a larger panel

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
so he's just thinking out loud

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
that I guess they have this nine-valent

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
one that makes up

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
antibodies against a larger panel

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
now that I just heard

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
that there is a Gardasil-9

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I guess the way that it must work

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
is that it targets a whole panel of viruses

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
you know

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
five minutes ago I thought that there was just

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Gardasil-2 but I guess there's

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Gardasil-9 so cool wow

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
it's like learning in real time

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I feel really smart now

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
we're talking about

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
vaccinating teenage girls

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
that don't need to be vaccinated

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
that are

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
we're talking about injecting

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
a combination of substances

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
intramuscularly

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
to augment the immune system

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
of healthy young teenage girls

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
and boys

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
to protect them from viruses

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
that have more than

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
200 seroprevalent type

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
serotypes

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
more than 200

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
serotypes we are attempting

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
to

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
augment the immune system

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
of healthy teenagers

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
and

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
the amount of responsibility

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
that

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
professor Dove feels

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
to all those teenagers

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
is that he was

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
vaguely aware that there was

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
a human papillomavirus vaccine

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
that was dual valent

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
trivalent is there a quadrivalent

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
one oh there's a nine valent

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
one wow that's

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
that's impressive I guess that one develops immunity

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
against a whole panel

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
of human papillomaviruses

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
boy technology's

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
amazing isn't it Dr. Dove

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Alan Dove

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
wow I mean I'm just shocked

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Vincent would you summarize then

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
what is the goal of this research?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Oh the goal is a viral ecology

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
yeah I'm a little confused about

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
well right so if you vaccinate against

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
a few serotypes

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
there are all these other serotypes circulating around

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and that happens to the ecology of this virus

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
now that you've

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
well if your vaccination is successful

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
you hope to take those serotypes out of the equation

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
maybe eradicate them in quotes

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
at least from local population

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and then do the other viruses

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
change their proportions in the population

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
but remember what

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
what we started with right

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Vincent said that you give this

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
this vaccine to kids before

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
they get the virus

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
one representation of HPV vaccine

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
is that you give it to them

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
so that they don't get these

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
these dangerous

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
human papillomaviruses

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
from their sexual activities

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and they don't spread them

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
so the argument is going to be

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that the ones that they do have

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
after vaccination

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
obviously are safer

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
but in this paper they don't look at

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
cancer

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
they don't even look at

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
like warts

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
or anything

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
they look for PCR evidence

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
of different

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
serotypes

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
of human papillomavirus

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
and do they look for all of them

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
they can't

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
they can't

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
they don't have that level of fidelity

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and they don't have that level of

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
of data

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
they don't have that level of vaccination

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
that coverage of vaccination

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
and so they need to use

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
very special

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
general linear models

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
and

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
apply mathematical simulations

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
in order to create synthetic data

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
and in that synthetic data

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
they say that they can find a difference

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
between populations that have been

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
unvaccinated versus vaccinated

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
and girls only versus vaccinated

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
and boys and girls

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
do you get more of those other

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
relatively benign serotypes showing up

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
or does everybody stay the same?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
you just get a total reduction in the amount of HPV

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Well I'm not sure a college is the right word

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
though that's what I'm driving

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
The reason they call it ecology

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
is because it's the niche concept

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
the right word that's what I'm driving

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
The reason they call

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
a total reduction in the amount of HPV

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Well I'm not sure a college is the right word

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It is says Alan Dove

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
it is

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
it's the right word

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
says the guy who says he read the paper

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
but didn't realize there were three vaccines

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
being used in the paper

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
didn't even bother to look

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
or find out or notice

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
never mind to think about

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
what would the difference between the immune response

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
of somebody who has

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
immunized with one versus the other

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
would one be more dangerous or less dangerous

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
more immunogenic or less

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
would one provoke a more specific response than the other

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
does that have any impact on the ecology that he so sure is there?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Listen to the guy in the upper right

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
continue to not really understand

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
why these people are being so

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
imprecise with their language

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
why they think it's okay to be so imprecise about

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
their language

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
He's not happy with it

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
but he goes along with it because of the illusion of consensus

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
that gets created by these kinds of discussions

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The reason they call it ecology

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
is because there's the niche concept

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
there's a specific niche that a virus occupies

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and if you take that virus from the niche

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
something else will come in and occupy

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
that's an ecological concept

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
It is but it's

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I don't like the use of the term

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I don't because you're really looking at the rates of acquisition of these viruses

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
the rate of acquisition

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
you see he's going back to the cartoon premise

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
that was set at the beginning of this discussion

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
which is already lost

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
because of the

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
bumbling

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
of these people

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
but he's on it

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
the guy in the upper right is on it

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
we could review it right now

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
let's go back Vincent

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
what did you say this is? This is a

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
this is a vaccine

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
that is supposed to prevent the acquisition

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
of human papilloma viruses

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
during sexual activity

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
and so it makes sense

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
they're great at preventing cancer

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Vincent says

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
and we should apply them to kids young

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
before they acquire

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
the viruses through sexual activity

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
so as

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
follows from that very obvious premise

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
the guy up here in the upper right

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
is arguing that well

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
then we're looking at the rate of acquisition

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
of these viruses

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
that's the exact words he used

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
the rate of acquisition

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
we're starting from zero

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and we're acquiring viruses

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
by being sexually active

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
that's the cartoon premise

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
and that is the cartoon premise

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
under which we are supposedly

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
vaccinating our teenage children

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and so inadvertently

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
unwittingly this guy is actually

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
questioning that premise right now

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and this guy is responding

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
in a very typical

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
skilled tv watcher way

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
he's laughing at him

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
he's making fun

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
you don't like the term

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
you don't like the term ecology

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
you don't like the term niche

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
are we being too imprecise for you

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
it's wicked these ways

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
it is wicked these many ways

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
that they haven't chanted us

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and there are many

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
unwitting participants like this

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Alan Dove character down here

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
who just loves to hear his own voice

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
but actually doesn't know very much

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
as is obvious every time he speaks

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
he gets really excited

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
when he thinks he's about to

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
restate something

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
that he sure is true

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
almost like a guy who gets to run

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
in a touchdown from one yard away

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
it's really fun

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
but it's also kind of not

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
challenging if the line does their

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
job and so he's always

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
really excited in these discussions

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
when they explain something

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and then he gets to

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
explain it again because he

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
thinks he understands it exactly like

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
he did with the with the nine

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
valent vaccine thing oh yeah they have

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
a nine valent when I guess that means

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
that it produces an immune response

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
against a whole panel of viruses

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
so here now he takes the role

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
of condescension

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
and says yeah you don't like the term

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
well it's definitely the right term

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
you don't like the term

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
listen

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
has this discussion spirals

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
into full-on skepticism

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and Vincent is forced to just

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
drag it out of the water

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
you're going to exclude

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
all of these others with a vaccine

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
and then do the others there you're not

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
vaccinating against do they come up as a result

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
does the rate increase or does it not increase

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
if we eradicated qlex pippians

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
would other mosquitoes

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
come into the niche that it occupies

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and you know become more prevalent than they are

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
see he again

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
completely admits that he doesn't

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
understand the biological concept

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
that he's arguing about

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
if we get rid of a particular mosquito

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
will other mosquitoes come in

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
that's not exactly the same

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
as sexually acquired human papillomavirus

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
is it no

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and the niche that's occupied

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
apparently by human papillomavirus

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
it's not the same

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
because a mosquito occupying a niche

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
is a

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
is an ecosystem

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
it is a species

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
it is predators

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and prey

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
it's reproduction

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
it's weather

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
it's seasons

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
it's an ecosystem

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
according to the cartoon

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
narrative of human papillomavirus

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
human papillomavirus is something

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
that you acquire when you become sexually active

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
one way to avoid human papillomavirus

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
would be not to be sexually active

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
one way to avoid mosquitoes

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I guess is to go not go outside

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
but we are not talking about

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
apples and apples here

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and Alan Dove

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
doesn't seem to get it yet

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and he's super confident

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that he's right because he's explaining it

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
with this checkmate

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
sort of

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
if we got rid of one mosquito

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
would another mosquito come in and do it

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
please tell me that we get some

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
comeback on this

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
no no no I got that part

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
that's an ecological question right?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
it is but I'm just

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
could have simplified this a little bit by just saying

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
does the rate of infection with the others go up

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
in those that haven't been vaccinated

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
because the ones that have been vaccinated

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
have kept down the rate of infection

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
with that particular species

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I mean one of the most important things

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'm trying to drive home which I'm not doing a very good job of

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
is that the biology of

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
viruses

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
is to a large extent

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
a mythology

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
and it is a mythology

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
based on the false equivalence

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
between replicating

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
reproducing evolving species

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
like a mosquito

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and an RNA signal

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
an RNA noise

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
an RNA phantom

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
an RNA phenomenon

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
and in this case a DNA phenomenon

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
a genetic noise

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
a genetic signal

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
a genetic something

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
that is not equivalent to a species

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
which replicates and evolves

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and reproduces

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
and is subject to selective pressures

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
and predatory and prey relationships

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and the weather etc

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
that false equivalence

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
and this transfer of

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
all of these biological ideas

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
to the phenomenon

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
DNA viruses is a false equivalence

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
which has resulted in

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
much confusion

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
about the potential for viruses to evolve

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
to sustain themselves

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
to occupy niches

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
all of these things

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
are designed to bamboozle you

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
into believing that many of the biological principles

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
that we've come to understand our world with

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
are applicable to these

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
small phenomenon

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
of RNA and DNA

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
and they are not

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
because we have a whole

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
other set of biological ideas

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
which describe

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
the principles governing

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
the behavior of RNA

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and DNA in the wild

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
we understand how DNA is exchanged

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
between bacteria

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
we understand how DNA is exchanged

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
using viruses between the roots

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
of cell roots of plants

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and the fungi that grow around them

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
we understand that

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
the different layers

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
of the phytoplankton

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
in the ocean

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
communicate and change

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
metabolically by communicating

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
with viruses

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
we understand that most of our tissues

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
communicate with viruses

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
that are just exosomes

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
and we understand

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
that the replication

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
of DNA and RNA is limited

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
by the enzymes that are used

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
in the context in which it occurs

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
and these limitations

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
prevent

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
RNA and DNA viruses

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
from reaching the level of biological phenomenon

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
where terms like niche

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and ecosystem are appropriate

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
that's what we're dealing with here

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and here we have

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Alan Dove so casually arguing

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
that all of these things apply

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
to all of these other things

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
and they just don't

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
and that guy up there

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
at the top right seems to understand

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
that there is a little bit of a contradiction

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and a little bit of

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
of incongruence when you start

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
to take these

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
these macro-biological ideas

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
and apply them to a very limited system

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
like RNA or DNA viruses

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I would argue with your use of the word

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
rate I think they're looking at the levels

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
of the virus

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
they're not looking at rates of infection

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
they're looking at levels of the virus

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
incidence and prevalence

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
yeah it's right it's not a rate it's just

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
incidence right in prevalence yeah okay so

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
okay so incidents in prevalence

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
and we're not looking at cancer

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
and we're looking at incidents in prevalence

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
without the benefit of having the

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
incidents in prevalence before vaccination

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
again under this cartoon assumption

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
that there are no signals

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
before you have sex

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and acquire these signals

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
and so their entire paper in cell micro

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
was based on a no data set

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
at start

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
at which is vaccination

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
or no vaccination and then

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
four years later they take their first

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
measurement of the ecology

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
of the human papilloma virus

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
in those people

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
they have no baseline

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
they just assume

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
like he did in the introduction

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
to the paper that kids don't have

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
these viruses

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
and if we vaccinate them early enough

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
we can stop their acquisition

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
of these viruses because that's how vaccines work

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
this is the illusion

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
this is the mythology right here

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
in front of you this is the way

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
this is all they got

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
and they want to vaccinate

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
millions of people

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and millions of people

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
millions of girls

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
teenage girls

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
around the world in Africa

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
India America everywhere

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
that will take it

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
based on this flimsy

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
type of discussion where

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
four people apparently can read

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
a paper and barely even get past the

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
abstract because they're so biased

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and so bamboozled

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
that they just think that

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
disease means

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
cure and cure is the best one

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
is a vaccine

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I mean that's the foundation of their understanding

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
of everything around them

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
the way they put it here

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
and if you look in the discussion

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
they say the rationale

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
for the study is that the vaccine

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
reduces the number of susceptible hosts

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
or the virus is targeted

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
by the vaccine or

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
would it favor escape

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
which is the case for influenza virus

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
that happens for HPV

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
the idea of

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
so escape mutants

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
for COVID and for flu just slip that in

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
there you know escape mutants

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
viruses that are not targeted by the vaccine

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
or would it favor escape

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
which is the case for influenza virus

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
that already is another mythology

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
right because how would you

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and I differentiate

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
let's look at the HPV example

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
human papilloma virus has more than

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
200 serotypes

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
many of them are rare

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
many of them haven't really been associated

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
with cancer that we know of but how

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
really have we investigated if many of them

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
are spread all over the place

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
geographically in space and time

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
and so we vaccinate against a few of them

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
we claim that it has some effect on cancer

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but we have no data for it

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and these people are now having

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
creating an illusion of consensus that these things

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
are obviously useful

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and that what we envision that we see in

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
this paper is evidence of their usefulness

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
but the evidence in this paper is

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
synthetic data

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
generating used a combination of

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
mathematical techniques

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
derived from the original data set

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
which doesn't even have a baseline

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
they did not measure HPV

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
prevalence and serotypes

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
in these children

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
at vaccination

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
but they tell the story here that they obviously

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
they didn't have any before they started

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
having sex that would be crazy

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
these are sexually transmitted viruses

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
what a magnificently huge assumption

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
it's very convenient

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
for the vaccine maker

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
very convenient that these guys don't ever

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
even notice it

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
like how can they not notice it if

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
there's no baseline

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
like what kind of study was this

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
that happens for HPV

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
but the idea of reducing the

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
number of susceptible hosts

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
may increase the likelihood of type replacement

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
which is what they call it

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
the paper before this though

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
even the use of hosts

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
susceptible hosts

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
reducing the number of susceptible hosts

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
implies parasite

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
implies parasite

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
is a virus a parasite

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
should we think of it as a parasite

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
or is that a biological term

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
that's inappropriate to use for

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
an RNA or DNA phenomena

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I would argue that it's part of this

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
semantic war

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
that's obfuscating

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
the limitations

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
of RNA and DNA

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
virology

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
and perpetuating

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
this mythology that

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
pandemics are possible

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
that public health is necessary

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
that vaccines are essential

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
and slowly but surely

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
old guys and young guys

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
and old ladies and young ladies

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
are going to have to realize in their own

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
time and in their own way

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
that this is

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
a lie

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
maybe this guy's learning it

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
slowly but surely right now

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
it will die still just confused

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I think a lot of people are

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
going to die just confused

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
clearly stated that there were some geographic

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
differences in distribution of the SARS virus

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
rather geographic distribution

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
differences with these SARS types

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
that's a good question

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
if there's none there to begin with

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and you've cut out all of the ones

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
that you're worried about causing cancer

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
then nothing is going to come in to replace it

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
because it's not there

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
this particular study is in Sweden

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
so they're not looking at a global

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
perspective there

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
but it's an interesting question

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
do you see a different pattern elsewhere

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
okay I'm sorry to

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm sorry

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
people will allow it for this

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I'm not sure I can't

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
so what are you doing this paper as they look at

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
community level occurrence of different types

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
up to eight years after vaccination

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
either in girls only or gender neutral

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
so one or the other

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
right so they actually have three different

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
communities that they're looking at there

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
some that didn't have vaccination campaign

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
some that targeted girls specifically

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
because it's a very effective way to control the virus

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
or at least it should be and then others that were

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
gender neutral boys and girls got vaccinated

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and we should say there has been previous evidence that

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
vaccination is changing the

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
the prevalence of genotypes

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
right there these the ones targeted by the vaccines

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
are going down and

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
so the question is are the others that are not targeted

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
going up or are they staying the same?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
that's what they're addressing

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
so none of these

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
the conclusions that he just listed

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
were actually reached using the data

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and the data in this paper

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
were unable to say any of those things

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
but the combination

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
of a

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
linear modeling and a

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
what is it?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
graphical something

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
something network

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
two different types of

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
math were used to

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
synthetically generate

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
finally to comprehensive

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
evaluate the community level

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
HPV type diversity

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
distribution between the trial arms

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
we applied

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
gen modeling

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
for the observed HPV type prevalence data

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and generated a synthetic data set

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
from each original community

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
randomized trial arm

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
first the gen model

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
was fitted to each

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
observed trial arm HPV type

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
distribution over time

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
from which a synthetic

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
HPV type prevalence distribution

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
for 100,000 individuals

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
was simulated

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
for each arm and time point

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
for community level alpha

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
and beta diversity estimation

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
synthetic HPV type prevalence

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
distribution for each trial arm

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
data with an n equals

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
100,000 was randomly resampled

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
a thousand times without replacement

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
for equal community size

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
community level HPV type

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
alpha diversity was estimated using

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
resampled synthetic communities

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
for 18 to 22 year olds

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
a significant increase

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
in alpha diversity

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
the Shannon index was observed

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
from 18 to 22 year olds

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
in the synthetic and gender

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and neutral communities

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
in contrast a significantly lower

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
alpha diversity was sustained

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
in the synthetic girls-only communities

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
among the 22 year olds

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
does that sound like data

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
which leads you to believe

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
what Vincent just said

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
or does it sound like they did a

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
mathematical simulation

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
that gave them the result that they wanted

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and how

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
disingenuously

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
is this result

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
or this result set

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
being represented by these people

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
they haven't even mentioned

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
that general linearized models

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
and this technique called

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
a graphical-independent

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
network model

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
a graphical-independent

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
network model

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
a graphical-independent

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
network modeling

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
was used for the observed HPV type

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
prevalence data

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
and generated a synthetic dataset

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
from each original community

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
randomized trial arm

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
first the

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
gin model was fitted

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
to each observed trial arm

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
HPV type distribution

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
over time

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
from which a synthetic

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
so they basically used

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
linear

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
and

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
graphical

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
independence network models

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
which I don't say that I understand

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
but I'm just telling you what they're doing

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and what they say in their paper

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
and what they say in their paper to generate

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
a synthetic dataset

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
made up of 100,000

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
synthetic cases

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
or distributions of the

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Hylun papilloma virus

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
serotypes

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
and in those

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
communities which were simulated

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
they say that they got

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
a significantly lower

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
alpha diversity

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
in the girls-only communities

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
and the gender-neutral

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
communities of some kind.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I mean

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
the way that they are discussing this

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
it sounds like they just measured a bunch

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
of people and found a change in the viruses

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
but they actually didn't

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
they measured a bunch of people

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
and then they used a lot of mathematical tricks

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
and tools to create

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
a dataset where they say that

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
they found a difference between these different

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
communities but they're all synthetic communities

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
they don't have enough data from the

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
real data because what?

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
because the communities they're discussing

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
have a vaccination rate of between

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
25 and 50 percent

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Did you hear that from Vincent or any of these guys yet?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Not at all

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Not at all

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
You don't hear

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
it from them at all

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
because they don't understand the paper

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
or they haven't read the paper

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
or they've read the paper and don't understand it

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
they're actually all

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
based on synthetic modeling

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
and interpretation

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
based on the limited data set

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
that they had

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
that the limited data set that they had

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
was insufficient to show

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
any effect at all

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
is lost on these guys

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
That's the best way to put it

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
That's exactly right

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So they first look at four years

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
after vaccination and they compare

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
HPV types in this community

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and they have a

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
generalized linear model

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
GLM for looking at this

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
these are all statistical analyses

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
of course

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
No differences in the

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
between the gender-neutral arm A and girls-only-arm B

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
at the community or type level

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
which remained true even after selecting

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
certain birth cohorts

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
for the strongest difference in strength

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
but four years post-vaccination

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
and epigenicity of vaccine-targeted genotypes

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
that would be 16, 18, 31

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and 45, 45 in both gender-neutral communities

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and for girls-only communities

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
so reduction in the

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
circulation of those types

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
if you will

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So I have another question related to that then

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
How long does the vaccine protect?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Well we've looked

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
when was this first

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
This group is from 92 at the earliest

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
as far as I know it's durable

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I haven't heard anything about

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
waning immunity against it

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
because it's not a molecular

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
vaccine dependent on the genome

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
it's a protein vaccine

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
The eight years post-vaccination they found comparable to portions of these

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
vaccine-targeted types

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
16, 18, 31, 45, again

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
in general-neutral and then they find 16, 18, 31

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
are reduced in the girls-only communities

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
so those are

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
types that are targeted by the vaccine

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
you can see a reduction which has been reported elsewhere

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Now eight years post-vaccination

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
they found an increase of non-vaccinated

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
and non-vaccinated types

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
52 and 66

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
exclusively among the gender-neutral communities

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
when you compare them with the control

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
because we didn't get any vaccine

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
so 52 and 66 are not in the vaccine

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but they're going up

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
but you don't see that in the girls-only

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
comparison

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I don't know why that is

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I got to this part in the paper

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I was like wait

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
how do we make sense of this

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
and eventually what I kind of

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
like partly from the data but also just like

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
how would that even work

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
is that the unvaccinated boys

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
may serve as something of a reservoir

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
for some of the

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
of the HPV 16, 18 at all

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
and that is preventing

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
the

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
the ingress if you will of

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
52 and 66

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
because the niche is not completely unoccupied

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
there's a segment of the population that still has

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
these oncogenic viruses

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Now that's pretty funny

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
for him to say because

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
again it seems like

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
he hasn't read the paper well enough to know

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
that the simulated communities

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
have a coverage of 25 to 50 percent

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
at best

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and he hasn't realized

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
that they don't have a baseline

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
so they have no idea

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
what the distribution of these

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
viruses and serotypes was

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
in the background before the

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
vaccination took place

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
and he's working under the assumption

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
that again

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
the girls are clean and the boys are clean

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
and then they are vaccinated

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
and then they mix together sexually

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
and then the boys

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
if they're not vaccinated

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
are the reservoirs

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
from which these girls are getting the virus

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
but again we're talking about

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
vaccination penetration rate

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
of like less than 50 percent

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
so all the ideas that they're working with

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
all the assumptions that they're working with

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
are cartoon simple

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
cartoon simple

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
in the face

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
of the paper

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
which admits that the

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
cartoon simple doesn't work here

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
because we're not even able to test that

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
there are hundreds

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
of serotypes we only test

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
for a few

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
for 10

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
and we look at how these 10 change

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
even though we vaccinate from between

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
two and nine

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
a total number of

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
serotypes

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
and it gets worse

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
the guy up here

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
is about to drop the bomb

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
of wait a minute

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
virology is supposed to be like this

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
virology is supposed to be like this

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
so what does this mean?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and they have no clue because

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
again this is immunomethology

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
the high fidelity is a lie

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
the deep

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
in depth understanding is a lie

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
the application of all of these

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
complicated biological

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
phenomenon that apply to species

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
in evolution

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
in ecosystems and applying it to

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
virus and virus phenomenon

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
is a lie

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
that's the dissonance that you see

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
this guy dealing with

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
in real time

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
as he realizes that a lot of this

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
mythology

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
has been proven wrong

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
a lot of these assumptions

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
that his career is based

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
on have been proven wrong

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
are being proven wrong

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
in real time

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
the HPV vaccine

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
doesn't work like the polio vaccine

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
did when this guy was a kid

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
it doesn't work like the measles

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
vaccine works like this

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
guy was a kid

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
it just doesn't

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
work like the vaccine of a

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
self-limiting disease

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
for which natural immunity

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
can be formed by infection

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
and if there were ever

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
any working examples of a

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
vaccine that was successful

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
it would be a vaccine made

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
from an attenuated

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
virus a chemically weakened

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
virus

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
and exposure to it at a

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
barrier

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
that intramuscular

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
injection of it

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
or that in a combination

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
of adjuvant substances

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
no, no, no

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
an Allen Dove

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
is not going to realize it

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
in his lifetime

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
he is a skilled TV watcher

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
until the last person around him

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
comes to this conclusion

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
he will live in this boat

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
they're not spreading them to the girls

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
who got vaccinated

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
but, you know, that's my theory

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
that's not really something that the data speak to

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
but I think that's at least gave me

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
a little explanation that could work

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
so that means

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
the ones that got vaccinated

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
are they still susceptible to the one

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
the strains that were not included in the vaccine, right?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
did they convert?

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
do they look at that?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
let's see, the analysis is

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
let's look at the methods, hang on

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
methods except the document

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
is this serology or

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
well, people infected with

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
any of the HPV's

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
don't they eventually develop antibodies

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
but the antibodies aren't protective

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
because the genome is already inside

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
holding up like a plasmid in cells

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
or is that, did I just remember that

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Sarah prevalence, yeah, that's how they look here

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
we're looking at antibodies to the different types

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
so if you have antibodies to 16

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
you're not protected against any of the other types

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
so I wonder

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
if you actually caught that

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
well, I didn't realize I was an onscreen

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
so Alan Dove

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
basically again just drops the ball

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
and admits that he doesn't know anything about

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
what he's talking about

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
but he's trying to pretend that he's in authority

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
and this guy up here

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
is still having problems with the idea that

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
wait, there are really a lot of

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
serotypes

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
and we're only vaccinating against a few of them

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
so you guys are talking about ecology

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
you're predicting an outcome

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
and did they see this outcome?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
and the reality is

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
is that they are still trying to read the paper

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
in real time to find out exactly

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
how this outcome was reached

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
and they still haven't gotten to the paragraph

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
that I read to you earlier

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
where they say

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
that the way that they reach these conclusions

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
is by creating a synthetic data set

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
that was at least 10 times larger

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
than the original data set from which it was derived

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I would ask, if they haven't asked

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
the people who were protected against the cancer

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
inducing strains of HPV

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
were still susceptible to the none

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
cancer-producing HPV?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
did they convert or not?

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
No, they didn't because the ones

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
in these cohorts that were vaccinated against the cancer-causing types

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
they saw an increase in

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
seroconversion against the ones that were not in the vaccine

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
so they're clearly getting infected because they're making input

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Right, so they do, they seroconvert against

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
the ones that were not in the vaccine against 52 and 66

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
they don't seroconvert against 16 and 18

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
that weren't in the vaccine

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
if they weren't vaccinated

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Does that make sense?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
You get the vaccine, you're going to have antibodies to those

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I'm not sure how they sorted the two out

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
but obviously there's a way to do it

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Let's look

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
if you want to say 16 and 18

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
is declining in prevalence

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
based on serology

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
that means that

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
you're getting contracted antibodies

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
naturally, so that's

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
even if you've been immunized with 16 and 18

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
and eventually those antibodies will go down

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
unless you're re-infected, those antibodies will go down

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
unless circulation of those types

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
whereas you see higher levels of antibodies against the non-vaccine

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
included types than you're saying

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
those are circulating in the community and they're infecting our subjects

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
That's right, but they're not

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
It's really unbelievable, right?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
This contradiction and this

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
this doesn't

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
compute to any of the people on the screen

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
and they're still just trying to rationalize it

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
making sense

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Let me reiterate

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
They use seroprevalence to decide whether or not these people have been infected by these

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
of HPV

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
but the vaccine

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
the only way they can measure

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
whether or not the vaccine works

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
is looking for seroprevalence responses

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
to the vaccine

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So the assumption

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
is that if they vaccinate you against

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
9 serotypes of HPV

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
that you will have

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
9 different antibodies

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
in circulation responding to

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
those 9 different serotypes of HPV

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
but then when they look for seroprevalence for

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
against all of these viruses

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
they find a decreased seroprevalence to

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
the viruses

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
that you were vaccinated to and an increased

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
seroprevalence to the

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
to the viruses which are present

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
in those people

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
So they use the signal

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
for immunity

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
to also indicate the presence of the virus

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
which is really quite

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
extraordinary

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
They don't have

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
actually any data according to their read

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
on the prevalence of

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
viruses. They have

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
data on the prevalence of

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
seroprevalence to

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
particular serotypes

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
of human papilloma virus

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
and they only have

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
the capability of testing for about

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
10 of those

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
conditions

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
And so they're just kind of casually laughing

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
about how I wonder how they differentiate

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
between antibodies from the vaccine

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
and antibodies from exposure to

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
the types that they're trying to eliminate

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Can they tell the difference between

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
them? I guess they must have been able to

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
let's read about it. They must have done it

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
somewhere and then they never come to a conclusion

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
and Alan Dubbs fine with that

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
They're not causing cancer

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
They're not causing cancer

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
unless you're re-infected

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
those antibodies will go down and that will

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
support your idea that there's less circulation

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
of those types

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and whereas you see higher levels of antibodies

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
against the non-vaccine included types

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
than you're saying those are circulating in the community

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
and they're infecting our subjects

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
But they're not causing cancer

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
They're not causing cancer

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
They're not causing cancer

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
That's the question

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
The assumption is

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
that any data

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
that they have

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
on these particular

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
serotypes

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
is real

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
That's the assumption

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It's the assumption

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
that's made on all of these papers

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
all of the time

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
is that

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
the distribution

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
of the variable in question

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
obviously must be this

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000
So if we don't find what we expect

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
then obviously

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
what we find is a result of

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
the manipulation that we made

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.000
and what none of these biologists and what

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
so many academic biologists

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
are trained not to do

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
is to wonder

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
too long about what the initial condition really was

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
To assume

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
that the initial condition is something

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
that you could imagine

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
like the initial condition of these children

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
well obviously

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
since these are sexually transmitted viruses

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
and these are kids

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
in their early teens

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
that haven't had sex

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
obviously they have no HPV

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
viruses and no HPV

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
seroprevalence

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
detectable by our tests

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
So we don't need to test them

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
on the day that we vaccinate them

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
We'll test them four years later

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
and none of these biologists

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
are sophisticated enough

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
except for maybe the guy in the upper right

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
to understand how ridiculously

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
inaccurate

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
and unscientific it would be

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
to claim that the data that you

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
collect at four years out

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
and eight years out

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
has anything to do with what you did

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
at time zero

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
in a small portion

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
of the total population in which you looked

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
and yet somehow or another

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
these guys have made

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
made a theater

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
a presentation

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
about an illusion of consensus

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
that this is a real

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
dataset with real

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
results that are

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
interpretable as

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
indicating

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
that HPV vaccination

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
in teenagers

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
depending on whether you do it in girls

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
or in boys has differential effect

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
on the ecology

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
of human papilloma virus

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
distribution among teenagers

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
and it's really just a synthetic

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
generated dataset

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
based on an incomplete

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
observation set

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
and now what you need to understand is

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
that almost all

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
biology about

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
vaccine-targetable disease

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
about all biology

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
based on

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
augmenting the immune system

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
is done with a similar

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
level of obfuscation

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
exaggeration

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
oversimplification

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
and over complication

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
it's these combinations of

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
enchantments that allow them to make

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
statements which move

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
biosecurity states which can

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
move secret meetings which can

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
move trillions of dollars

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
behind the scenes

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
based on oversimplification

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
over exaggeration

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
over complication

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
and a semantic war

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
where we take known

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
and understood biological

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
phenomenon that exists on the species level

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
and try to apply it to an

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
RNA phenomenon

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
or even a DNA

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
phenomenon

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
which is wholly

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
and equivalent to species

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
level and ecosystem

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
level phenomenon as we understand them

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
in macrobiology

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
and while

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
the old man in the upper right is really

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
feeling the grinding

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
of the gears here as they have

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
this very inaccurate, very

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
imprecise discussion

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
about a very

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
pretty crappy paper

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
trying to laud it

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
as bonafide

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
example of

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
vaccine effectiveness

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
it's brutal

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
but this is how the war is waged

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
this is how it's done

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
this is the actual battlefield

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
right here

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
and this is why Gigoen biological

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
is going to have years of work to do

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
this breaking down

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
needs to happen every day

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
all the time

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
constantly

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
until people start to catch on

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
and do it with me

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
until people start to catch on

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
and do it as well as me

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
until this starts to catch on

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
as a thing that people do

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
until these people stop

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
doing what they're doing

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
because this is part of

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
the apparatus that

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
misleads doctors

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
that underpins the assumptions

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
that the conclusions

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
that doctors assume are certain

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
are caused

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
by these kinds of discussions

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
these people whose

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
academic responsibility has been

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
abdicated

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
by their own incompetence

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
by their own lack of curiosity

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
every one of these gentlemen

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
should and ladies should be upset

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
and ashamed of themselves

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
for having been

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
in their chair for that long

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
and having learned so little

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
on their own.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Let me say that again

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
every one of these people

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
in these chairs and almost

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
all the academic biologists

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
currently sitting

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
in a tenure-track position

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
should be ashamed of themselves

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
because they have abdicated

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
their responsibilities

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
as professional biologists

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
to understand the biology

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
of vaccination and to understand

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
that it has been

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
oversimplified

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
it has been grossly exaggerated

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
ineffectiveness and value

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
and we have contorted it

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
into a

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
a gigantic criminal

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
enterprise

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
and it is absolutely

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
criminally negligent to

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
intramuscular inject

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
intramuscularly inject

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
any combination of substances

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
in the vaccine system

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
it is definitely criminally negligent

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
and it is only because

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
doctors don't understand the biology

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
it is only because

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
the NIAID and the vaccine center

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and all these people

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
have obfuscated the truth

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
of the biology of the immune system

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
that they don't understand

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
you can't

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
you have to follow these

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
and suddenly in vaccinated people

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
we start to see cancer as HPV

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
that is causing them

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Absolutely

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I've been trying to figure out

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
the answer to Dixon's question

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
which I think is interesting

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
which is what is the geographic

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
distribution of the different types

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
around the world

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
and while I found various titles

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
and hits that seemed like they were

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
going to be informative

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I didn't find anything that really addresses

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
that question

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
how many types are all together

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
and I was going to say a hundred

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
and yet only these two

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
it's more than 200 so again

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
the virology professor of the world

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
has no idea how many serotypes

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
there are and more importantly

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
he's going to try to avoid saying

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
that all the other biological

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
principles apply to human

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
papilloma virus but the guy in the upper

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
right is not going to let him get away

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
around the world are responsible

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
for the surgical cancer

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
and why is this guy down here

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Alan Dove at the bottom saying nine

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
when we started out the discussion

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
he was sure it was just two

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
and then surely behind me here

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
says no it's also 36 and 38

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
oh yeah that's right

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
and then later on five to ten

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
minutes later it's oh yeah there's nine

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
of them now

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and so now he says like yeah

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
it's nine as if he knew

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
or he didn't learn it like 20 minutes

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
ago

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
this is the kind of arrogance

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
that we need to fight against

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
that's not a humble man

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
that's a guy as I said before

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
who's just waiting to repeat what he just

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
heard so that he can sound smart again

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
and he loves doing it

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
he loves the one yard rushing

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
touchdown

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
with an offensive line

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
of high schoolers against

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Pee Wee football

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
he loves to be the running back

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
in that scenario

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
give me the ball coach

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I can happy to repeat the line

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
but he's not willing to put his

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
his academic you know

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
and intellectual mind out on a cliff

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
and think for himself

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
but every time he hears a safe spot

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
or a safe thing to say is correct

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
or a safe thing that he thinks is certain

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
he'll repeat it immediately

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
and here he is saying

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
yeah it's nine it's nine of them

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
even though I didn't even know there was

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Gardasil nine until ten minutes ago

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
yeah there's nine of them

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
don't you know man?

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
how many types are there altogether?

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
that's another question

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
oh there's at least I was going to say a hundred

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
oh maybe yeah

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
and yet only these two around the world

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
are responsible for these

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
well the nine

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I'm at the right

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
and potentially more than that

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I mean there's the high on cryogenic and the low on cryogenic

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
and even high risk and low risk

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
and ontogenicity

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
are based on almost no data

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
if not zero

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
it's really the truth

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I challenge anybody go find it

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
if you're a doctor, if you're a skeptic

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
go find papers that show

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
real data about HPV

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
and cancer

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
and which

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
serotypes cause it

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
which of the hundreds of

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
serotypes known cause cancer

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
and which don't

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
which just cause warts

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
which ones

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
they're basically justifying

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
a Merck product

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
what else are they doing here

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
but defending a Merck product

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
with with with Glasgow Smith

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Klein intellectual property

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
what else are they doing?

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
they're not arguing for the biology of it

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
they're not even arguing about the biology of it

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
the whole premise is that it

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
prevents cancer

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
this is a story about

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
seroprevalence to zero types

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
extended through math

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
that's what this is about

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
it's not about anything to do with the actual biology

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
that this vaccine purports to

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
encroach on

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
so it's unclear

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
how far exactly we've gotten down the risk tree

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
but with the nine valent

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
it's pretty clear like

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
maybe everything maybe there's going to have to be a 10 valent

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
later when we discover that there are some

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
rare situations where one of these others can be cancerous

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
you know so that's possible

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
but this guy literally learned

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
this biology and the course of

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
this discussion he's talking like he

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
he's the the jeopardy champion

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
of HPV biology

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
it's really sad

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I mean if I was on this

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Twiv thing I would be like hey Alan why don't you

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
chill out a little bit you didn't even know about

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
these are the

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
these are the

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
these are the big concerns

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
okay so there are over 100 different types of

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
HPV not all of them cause health problems

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
some kinds may cause problems like genital warts

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
some kinds can also cause cancer of the cervix

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
vagina vulva or anus

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
most of these problems are caused by type 611 16 or 18

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
November 1st FDA

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
oh so

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
she found a document from the FDA

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
which clears up

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
this whole thing about the 200 plus

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
zero types and whether they cause cancer or not

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
gee thanks

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
over 100 okay

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
and they're classified at the high risk low risk

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
and no risk no no observe risk

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
no observe risk right

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
one two three four five six

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen high risk

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
so not all the high risk are in the vaccine because

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I think that just there's not enough infections

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
right but maybe that could change right

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
yeah and it's like well like or a

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
for angel cancer people now talk about HPV

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
causing it but

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
if you go back 30 or 40 years

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
HPV was not really a big topic of conversation for

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
oral for angel cancer because the overwhelming majority of it

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
was caused by smoking right and when smoking rates

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
came down thanks to you know finally

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
calling out the tobacco companies to account

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
the you know that

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
then revealed oh yeah by the way there are

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
a lot of cases out there that aren't caused

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
right so you didn't see those because there

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
was so much else going on and it's possible with

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
with these cancer causing HPV's

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
now that you get the vaccine when that's gotten

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
wide enough uptake we'll get to a point where we'll say

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
okay we got most of it and now

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
there are these remaining ones and as I say that might

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
be time to add more to the

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
vaccine but this is certainly proven

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
a very very successful strategy

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
a very very successful strategy

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
it's proven a very very successful strategy

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
I'm going to give you another example

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
of how numbers can

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
be distorted in a very

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
disingenuous way that is

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
not unlike what is being done here

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
if you were a politician in Chicago you might make

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.000
the statement that gun deaths in Chicago are on a decline

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000
and over the last 10 years they've been on a great decline

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000
and so a lot of the policing process and the policing

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
in Chicago has been successful

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
and that would be ridiculous statement

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
for one reason and one reason only

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
the reason why gun deaths have gone down in Chicago

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.000
is because the ERs have become better at saving people

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000
from dying from gunshot wounds

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
they've become better at treating gunshot wounds

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
than they were 10 years ago

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
and so the number of gunshot deaths has gone down in Chicago

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
over the last 20 years

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
but the number of gunshot wounds has gone skyrocketing

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
and so in a very

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
weird limited way

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
depending on who you measure

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and how you simulate it

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
what math tools you use

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
you can create a dataset

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
or a synthetic dataset

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
which gives the illusion of change

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
an illusion of change

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
which logically

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
when told as a story or a mythology

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000
seems to correlate well with the expectations

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
of your manipulation of the system

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
in this case the idea is

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
is that the serial prevalence

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
of oncogenic strains of HPV

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
in our simulation

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
based on a small subset of real data

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
seems to indicate

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
that the serial prevalence

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
the serial prevalence

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
not the actual presence

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
of but the serial prevalence

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
to some of these strains

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
changes over time in these communities

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
when we simulate them

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
at the four and eight-year mark

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
that's what they should be saying

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
that's what it should say in the abstract

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
and say in the conclusions

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
and in fact

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
what is it saying the conclusions

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
it says previously

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
we modeled from observed HPV

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
vaccine trial data

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
and showed the need

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
to opt for general neutral

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
HPV vaccination strategies

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
to realistically meet

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000
the who targeted eradication

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
of oncogenic HPV's

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
hold on a minute

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
are you kidding me?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
this is what I'm reading

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
previously we modeled

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
from observed HPV

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
vaccine trial data and showed

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
the need to adopt for general

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
neutral HPV vaccination strategies

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
to realistically meet

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
the who targeted eradication

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
of oncogenic HPV's

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
that giant sentence says

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
that we need to vaccinate

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
both teenage girls

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
and teenage boys

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
in order to realistically

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
meet the world health

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
organization goal

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
of eradicating oncogenic

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
HPV's

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
now we've just heard the

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Twivcast say that we don't know

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
if these other

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
possibly 200 or more

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
serial prevalence

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
types of HPV are not responsible

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
for generating cancer

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
we just know that a few of them

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
have been associated with

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
cancer in the studies that we've done

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
and yet here we are

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
not talking about the biology

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
but talking about a world health

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
organization goal of eradicating

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
oncogenic HPV's

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
so to control oncogenic

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
HPV's and related cancers

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
we need to understand

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
the evolutionary dynamic

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
of these oncoviruses

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
are they oncoviruses?

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
we're just calling them

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
oncoviruses because

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
that makes

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
well it makes things simpler

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
it makes the assumption

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
an enchantment

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
we already know this

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
don't we?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
no we don't

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
but we're going to call them

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
oncoviruses so that it seems like

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
we do we made a whole term

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
for HPV viruses that cause

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
cancer it's an oncovirus

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
under long-term vaccine

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
induced selective pressure

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
long-term vaccine induced

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
selective pressure

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
is a mythology for which

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
there is no

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
biological evidence

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
including in this paper

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
because

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
here we

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
estimate that low to moderate

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
coverage

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
HPV vaccination causes

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
between

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
5.5 and

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
36.7 percent change

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
in the genital HPV-type

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
distribution

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
we estimate

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
that a

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
low to moderate change

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
from moderate coverage of HPV

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
vaccination causes

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
a 25 to 36 percent

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
change in the genital HPV-type

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
distributions

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
in HPV vaccination communities

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
the change mostly stems

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
from a decrease in the occurrence

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
of high-achogenicity

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
vaccine-targeted HPV-types

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
but particularly when

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
implemented general

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
neutral also a

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
12 to 20 percent shift

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
in low-achogenic

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
non-vaccine-targeted

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
HPV-types is observed

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
while the eradication

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
of HPV 16-18-31-45 will

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
eliminate most cervical cancers

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
these are not the

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
seroprevalence numbers that were listed by them

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
in the previous discussion

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
they actually said

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
what did they say

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
618 something something

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
and that's

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
right so you didn't see those because there was so much

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
by smoking

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
surf risk

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
surf risk

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
rare situation

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
listen to the numbers she says here

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
that's possible but these are

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
okay so there are over 100 different types of

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
HPV not all of them cause health problems

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
some kinds may cause problems like

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
genital wards some kinds can also cause cancer

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
of the cervix vagina vulva or anus

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
most of these problems are caused by types

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
6, 11, 16, or 18

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
November 1st FDA

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
6, 11, 16, or 18

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
in a class of high-risk low risk

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
no risk

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
no surf risk so what are they talking about then right

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
what this paper

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
that they're reading

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
in the conclusion says that

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000
while eradication of 16, 18,

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
31, and 45 will eliminate

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
most cervical cancers

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
it is tempting to suggest that an increase

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
of 33, 35, 51, 52, 56, and 66

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
or the like

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
with increased virulence might cause

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
a risk of HPV related cancers in the future

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
in other words

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
eradicating some

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
doesn't guarantee that the others

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
won't cause cancer

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
the correlation

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
of these

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
does not preclude

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
the role of these

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
in those same cancers

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of times

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
when 16, 18, 31, 45,

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
1, 6, whichever one you want to do

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
is associated with cancer

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
they don't do a complete screen

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
to show definitively

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
that none of these other sero types

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
are present

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
in this paper they fall woefully short

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
of measuring 100, right?

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
they only do like 10

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
so the really crazy thing to see here

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
ladies and gentlemen in this paper

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
is this number

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
that they use

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
because the actual results

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
of the paper

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
are extraordinary

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
where is it?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
I'm going to find this one

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
number

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
in the results

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
that will just blow your mind

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
because I do actually think

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
that this is what they say

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
in the paper

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
in this discussion

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
where is it?

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
come on Jay, find it

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
at least in your time like this

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
maybe it's right away in the beginning

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
it's so close to the start

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
maybe that's why I found it right away

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
so where is this data here

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
we need that

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
we need this

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
yes here

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
HPV prevalence

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
oh no this was a different paper

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
okay sorry I'm looking for something

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
that's not in this paper

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I'm going to show you that paper tomorrow

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I apologize

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I don't think it's this paper

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
no it's not it can't be this paper

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
it is a paper that they cited

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
which paper did they cite

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
that I looked that up in

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
what paper was it?

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
it's one of these first here

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
documenting its health

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
infectious agent

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
eight years what is this one?

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
nineteen

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
is that the one? no

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
which one

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
is it?

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
okay well anyway

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
there's a paper that I wanted to look at

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
that I won't look at now

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
because it's taken me too long to find it

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
which basically is one of the papers

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
that that cell micro paper

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
has providing proof

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
that vaccination reduces

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
cancer

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
and in that paper

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
the results of the

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
let's say significant

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
result of the vaccine

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
is a 19%

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
increase in

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
cervical cancer

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
in the unvaccinated group

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
with a 95%

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
confidence interval which extends above

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
and below one

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
basically means that by their

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
confidence interval

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
they're pretty sure with a 95%

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
possibility they're pretty sure

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
that either the vaccine

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
reduces

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
or increases the prevalence of

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
cancer in those that receive it

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
because again one

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
is equivalence

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
below one is that

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
the vaccine causes

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
more people to get cancer

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
and above one

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
means that it reduces their

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
possibility of having cancer

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
and their confidence

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
intervals in their result

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
of 1.19

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
is a confidence interval

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
that extends from one point

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
something

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
down to 0.8

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
which means that

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
they're about 95% sure

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
that it either works or it doesn't

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
and that is the one

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
paper that is cited

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
by this cell micro paper

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
as you know these things

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
are great at preventing cancer

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
the same thing that

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Vincent started this whole discussion with

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
that these are great strategy

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
for

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
preventing cancer.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
We don't even have

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
people that are old enough

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
to produce the data

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
that's supposed to be there.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
We're just now getting to the point where

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
any teenager that was vaccinated

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
with this horrible idea of a product

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
is getting into the range

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
where they might develop it

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I'm going to kind of wrap it up here

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
because I don't think there's any reason

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
to let these people talk anymore

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
but they might say a few more interesting things

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
9, 10, 11, 12, 13 high risk

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
so not all the high risk are in the vaccine

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
because I think there's not enough infections

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
but maybe that could change, right?

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Yeah and it's like

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
we'll talk about HPV causing it

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
but if you go back 30 or 40 years

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
HPV was not really a big topic of conversation

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
for oral for angel cancer because the overwhelming majority

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
of the vaccine when that's gotten wide enough uptake

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
will get to a point where we'll say

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
okay we got most of it and now they're these

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
remaining ones and as I say that might be time

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
to add more to the vaccine

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
but this is certainly proven a very very

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
successful strategy

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
and that's one of the issues for looking at

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
this change in the if you'll allow it

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Dixen ecology of the

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
other the other serotypes

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
All right so I'm going to

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
head to the discussion now because I find it easier

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
to summarize the results from there

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
so basically just to repeat

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
so we find depletion of the high oncogene

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
vaccine targeted type 16, 18, 31, 45

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
and both gender neutral and girls only

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
vaccination four years and six years after

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
vaccination but eight years but at eight years

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
they only see it in gender neutral but what they say is

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
our most important finding that increased

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
oncogenic HPV's diversity from 48 years

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
post vaccination exclusively in gender neutral

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
communities even though the high risk

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
vaccine targeted

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
viruses have been decreased in those

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
communities and they write this is the first

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
recorded sign of ecological niche occupation

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
by the non-vaccinated HPV post population

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
level vaccination some of these

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
sentences are tough yeah I feel like this paper

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
could have used a good copy edit in some parts

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I mean that when the first recorded

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
sign of ecological niche occupation by the non-vaccinated

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
HPV post population level vaccination

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
there's a lot of parts there yeah

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
if that was the title I would have rejected the paper

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
the second quote sentence of the introduction

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
isn't a sentence until you take out the word

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
albeit yes yes there were sentences

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
that I read four or five times there were several like that

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
that I came to oh I see what they mean now

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
okay but so they can't write a paper

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
the paper is written in a very very

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
inaccurate and imprecise way

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
but they're still sure

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
that they understand the implications

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
of the paper even though they haven't

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
even stated that the data

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
that's that they're using to make

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000
their conclusions is synthetic

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
did you

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
did you I mean

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000
where did I put that paper now here

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I suppose I got rid of it right I closed it

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
did I close that

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I guess I closed that window

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
hold on let me pull this up again

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
PDF

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000
we're here

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
so let's see

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
where was this

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
paper the

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
the methodology here right so

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
that was this one this is where I read it

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I mean I'm not

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
for figure three they had to do a

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
simulation of community prevalence

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
distribution by vaccination strategy

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
so finally to comprehensive

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
evaluate the community level

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
HPV type diversity

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
distribution between the trial arms

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
they use this

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
general independent

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
or graphic independence network

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
modeling

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
and they simulated a

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
data set

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
simulated a distribution

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
for a hundred thousand individuals

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:03.000
and then they made their figure three

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
based on that this figure three is based on that

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
synthetic community level distribution

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000
it's beta diversity using synthetic data

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
it's not really an

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
observation that has much significance

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
except for when they extended it using

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
synthetic data

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.000
that's the part that's most frustrating

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000
this data from the actual communities was not sufficient

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000
for them to demonstrate the effect that they claim to have observed

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
that's really important

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
it's really important because

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
these these twib people

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
aren't adequately

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
describing the limitations of the paper

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
even as they

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
they pretend to have this discussion

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
about what's wrong with it or

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
they're not very good writers or they should have written it better

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
it needs a copy editor

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
it doesn't need a copy editor

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
it needs somebody to adequately

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
explain how much

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
charlatanism and enchant

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and is being cast by such a paper

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
how very little

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
forward progress is made

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
by such a paper

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
how it's vital

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
that no forward progress

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
is made in this field in order

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
for this mythology to be sustained

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
and that's the role that this clown

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
show plays

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
that this handler

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
is using these people for

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
is using

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
fame, perceived

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
fame, perceived

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
importance, perceived

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
significance on the internet

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
you know you're part of

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
twiv, so you've got an obligation

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
to get this right

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
and this is the moderator right here

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
the guy who is responsible for the first

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
infectious clone of an RNA virus

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
ever

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
with his supervisor

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
David Baltimore

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
who I'm convinced is one of the

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
granddaddy of all the liars

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
in this group of people

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
granddaddy of them all

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
is David Baltimore

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
if there's anyone who knows

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
the truth about the lies

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
of intramuscular injection

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
and the augmenting of the immune system

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
using adjuvants and recombinant proteins

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
hits David Baltimore

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
and his protégé

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Vincent Rancin yellow

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
racking yellow

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000
excuse me

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
that's enough of these characters I think

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
let's just see if they end

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
why are we looking at this because

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
if other viruses arise

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
to feel this niche then this could be a problem

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
for vaccination and they say this has been

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
observed with other viruses including hepatitis B virus right?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
SARS-CoV-2 we see antigenic variants

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
arising and replacing others

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
and so HPV's could have a similar pattern as well

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
and in a more immediate sense

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
we need to be aware of this for screening programs

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
you have to make sure that your screening is specific enough

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
that you're you know if you're going to say

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
oh you know you've got evidence of a cancer causing virus

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
this is the most awful part about it

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
because essentially

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
the only real public health data about

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
who in papilloma virus and cancer

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
is that like

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
an incredible number of these cancers

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.000
are essentially treated and avoided

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
in regular screening

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and these vaccine pushing

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.000
charlatans are saying that this is evidence

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
for the paper

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
argues that we might not

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
need to screen as many people

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
other people have argued that this means

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
that we might need to screen people for different viruses

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
or that we could screen them for viruses

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
instead of for cancer because it's cheaper

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
and here's Alan Dove

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
right away running in for the

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
one yard touchdown

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
oh give me the ball

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I can push this one through

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
and by the way

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
it is absolutely disgusting

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
make sure you've got the exact stereotype correct

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
so that you don't have false alarms

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
because you're going to have

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
possibly these other these other stereotypes moving in

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
another question that I would have as an economist

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
here goes can a single person acquire

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
several or ten different strains

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
or whatever you're calling these

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
variants of the couple of hours at the same time

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
sure sure they can have

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
ten different strains at the same time

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
but we don't know how many they have

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
and we assume that they only have one

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
most of the time right Vincent

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
we're not because the ecological

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
concept of species

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
is that no two species

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
different can occupy the same dish

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
only one species can occupy that niche

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
typical co-infection with more than one type

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
is common especially among young women

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
common so that means common

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
well then how in the world do they know

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
that these oncogenic varieties

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
are responsible if it's very common

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
to have many serotypes

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
on board

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
these are not species

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
they're varieties of the same type types

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
so the use of that word ecological

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
applies to species I'm sorry but that's a strict definition

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
really? and that's exactly

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
what I'm talking about

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
you can't take these strict definitions

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
with strict meanings and strict

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
strict conceptual meaning

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and then apply them to something as limited

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
and lame

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
as an RNA or DNA virus

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
for which we know their biology

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
is greatly limited by their replication

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
capacity and their lack of

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
all these other attributes that we

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
generally associate with

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
pattern integrity is called life

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
and here you see

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
the malfunction of the machine with this

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
grinning little clown down here

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
who thinks it's funny that there's

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
contradictions in the biology that they

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
discuss and it's funny that it bothers

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
that old man as much as it

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
doesn't bother him

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
because his little mushy brain

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
is capable of juggling these words like

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
this these contradictions are normal for

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
him

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
not normal for this old guy

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
maybe this old guy is redeemable

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
maybe this guy is going to leave

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
to him in a few weeks because he starts

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
to become convinced that something's not right

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.000
absolutely

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
why can't we be flexible Dickson?

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
he was the one who came up with that

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Dickson, I like Dickson

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I think Dickson is my new favorite guy

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
on Twiv and then they said

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
I looked up the reference

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
31 that they use for their guide

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
and it's called ecological niche by

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
a series of authors the Princeton guide to ecology

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
that's their guide

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
to say what on issues. I'm sorry

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
the original concept of Disha was

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
published by G. Evelyn Hutchinson

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
and everybody else followed suit

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
as they agreed with him but viruses don't

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
occur as species right? No they don't

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
so the word ecology probably is the wrong word

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
no why don't we just change the definition of ecology

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
there it is ladies and gentlemen

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
there it is

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
that's the clip for you for all time

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
why don't we just change the definition

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
of ecology then

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
why don't we just change the

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
correlative immunity then

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
why don't we just change the definition

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
why don't we just stop calling it

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
transfection

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
if you don't see it for the evil

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
that it is that what they are saying right now

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
right here is the home run of

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
home runs that you need to hear nothing

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
else you are being lied to

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
by a series of charlatans

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
that are misusing the language

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.000
of biology to obfuscate their mythology

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
that's what's happening here and Vincent

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Renson Yellow is a striking example of it

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
in real time right here right now

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
listen carefully

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
after Dixon so eloquently explains why

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
concepts like ecology and species

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
and niche

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
do not apply to a phenomenon

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
like an RNA or DNA virus

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
for which there are 20 plus

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
or 100 plus

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
or 200 plus

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
serotypes that can all occupy

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
the same niche at once

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
hit in a niche

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
what is Vincent Rask Rask Rask

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
and Yellow say

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
let's just change

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
the definition of the word

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
guide to say what on issues

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
I'm sorry

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
the original concept of dish was established

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
by Gevlin Hutchinson and everybody else followed suit

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
yes but they agreed with him but viruses don't occur

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
no they don't know they don't so the word of

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000
probably is the wrong word no why don't we just change the definition of ecology

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I think you can do that but some people would be very upset if you did that

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
there's another interesting point here though if you can have multiple infection

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000
why would eliminating HPV 1618 L that's a good question to a shift like this

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.000
that's right right if they could all get along fine before exactly we wouldn't

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:53.000
necessarily I wouldn't expect to see a shift so Alan Dove now has a

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000
completely different stance on things because his

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
understanding of biology

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
is so flexible

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
I mean

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:07.000
now he suddenly realizes that wait I mean if

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000
they're they can all be there at the same time then why don't they cause pressure

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000
obviously the phenomenon that we saw in this paper is due to

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000
selective in competition pressure because that's the only way we would see a phenomenon like this

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.000
is exactly what Alan Dove said about 10 minutes ago

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
in the video

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.000
not 10 minutes ago on my stream but 10 minutes in the video he said

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.000
that obviously they must be competing and that's why niche is a perfectly

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.000
good use and that's why ecology is the right term and he laughed at Dixon

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:43.000
now 10 minutes after discussing it and after re-ashing it and after discussing

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.000
the paper a little more and reminding him about recombination and all this other stuff

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.000
he now realizes oh wait maybe there shouldn't be and then why did we see this

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
phenomenon wow that's very interesting

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.000
we're not talking about diatoms and photosynthesis here Alan Dove

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.000
we're talking about a multi-billion dollar product being hoisted

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.000
on teenagers for no reason for no biology

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
that's based in reality and you're just realizing it now

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.000
live in front of people who are coming to you for informed consent on these things

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:32.000
that's a failure that's a giant failure that's a gigantic failure

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:40.000
ladies and gentlemen that's what that is that is a crash and burn failure of this system

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:46.000
that is controlling us and we are seeing through it in real time

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
and we are going to break this wheel in real time

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:56.000
the way that we're going to break this wheel is by breaking down this plan that they had

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:02.000
this theater that they had and breaking it down by doing the math that they don't want to do

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000
they want you to believe that there was a gain of function possibility

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000
that this whole thing came from the worst case scenario

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000
that it was a gain of function laboratory bio weapon that was released

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:19.000
and there's this illusion of consensus that that's the reason why you were

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.000
here not to blame for having been scared into taking the vaccine

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000
because this was the worst case scenario that they sent it to you

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.000
and this illusion of consensus about a novel virus that killed millions of people

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.000
that we saved millions of people from that was likely gain of function

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.000
and that will come again this illusion of consensus is how they got us

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000
and the way that they sustain this illusion of consensus is by telling you

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:48.000
the lie that everybody that died in excess in the last three years

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000
is a result of the mystery virus and the only way this lie works

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
is if you don't talk about the do not resuscitate orders

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
you don't talk about ventilators

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000
you don't talk about the lack of use of antibiotics

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
you don't talk about the poor use of steroids

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
you don't talk about remdesivir or medazlin

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
you don't talk about the extra opioid deaths

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
you don't talk about death certificate fraud

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
you don't talk about all of this math

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000
about PCR fraud and lateral flow test fraud in the UK

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.000
you don't talk about all of the illusion of virology

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:26.000
you don't talk about all of the illusion of correlates of immunity

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000
and you just talk about a novel virus

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000
you just talk about the millions of people that were killed by the novel virus

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.000
you just talk about gain of function and bioterrorism

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
you just talk about how they're going to do it again

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
that's how this was done

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.000
you don't need a bioweapon to do this

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000
you need a spectacular commitment to this lie

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:59.000
a spectacular commitment by these people to this lie

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.000
is the illusion of consensus that has changed the way we think

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
and trapped us in this illusion

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:10.000
this scooby-doo mystery about trying to figure out whether it was a laboratory leak or a bat cave zoonosis

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.000
that's what this faith is

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.000
and figuring it out and finding the liars and blaming ego health alliances

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000
is all part of this mystery-solving game

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000
to brainwash yourself into believing this illusion of consensus

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000
and the way to break this illusion of consensus is to realize

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
that the laboratory leak, the solving of it, was a mystery

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
the use had to solve

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
that allowed them to do all these things

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.000
under the guise of trying to do their best to solve this novel problem

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
that was never novel

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.000
and the illusion of consensus created by these people

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
is what brainwashed your family and friends

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
it brainwashed the people on TV

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
into believing this illusion of consensus

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
and it is a faith

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
a novel virus

02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000
that's what it is

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
call it for what it is

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
and the way that the faith isn't a lie

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
and it is very different

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
than saying that there are no viruses

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.520
if you say that there was an endemic background that they conflated

02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:13.000
it is very different if you say the protocols are murder.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
and a transfection is not medicine

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
and they conflated a background signal

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
it is very different if you murder

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:28.000
and a

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:35.000
is in medicine, it's a bioweapon and protocols are murder. But you're not going to survive

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.120
and you're not going to escape if you just say that there are no viruses and that they're

02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:45.080
lying about everything because they're not. There has to be some truth to the biology

02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:51.560
or biologists wouldn't have been fooled. But the truth has to be really, really clever

02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:58.240
lies. And that's what it is. It's infectious clones. The faith is a lie. There was a

02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:04.120
background signal and there remains a background signal that can be conflated as a pandemic.

02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:10.480
And if they had to release something or spray something or induce a signal, then the way

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:14.760
they would have done it will most likely and most easily is with infectious clones or even

02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:22.040
transfection of the spike alone. But the faith in the novel virus is being sustained

02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:30.720
by all the people that we that we currently call heroes right now. And you can see them

02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:38.520
sustaining the faith because they don't address PCR fraud anymore. They don't address the

02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:43.960
variant and sequencing fraud anymore. They have never known about the death certificate

02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:51.160
fraud. They've never known about the RNA purity and the fact that it can't copy itself

02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:55.720
the way that this story goes. They haven't talked about the problems with protein folding

02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:00.680
and our inability to understand it in the implications for transfection. They haven't talked about

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:05.320
transfection in general and it's inappropriate, mis and healthy humans. And they're not talking

02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:09.000
about natural immunity. They've never talked about immuno 101. They've never tried to

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:16.360
give you a lecture about immuno 101. Giga ohm biological is the only one. Jonathan Cooey

02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:23.240
is the only biologist in three years that has attempted to teach immunology relative to this

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:29.560
pandemic and to dispel the myths and the mythology of it using biology. I'm the only one.

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:35.880
You want me to go down the list of people that hasn't done it that could have? It's long.

02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:44.360
Brett Weinstein didn't do it. Chris Martinson didn't do it. Heather Hayne didn't do it.

02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:52.680
Peter McCullough didn't do it. Brian Cole didn't do it. Peter McCory didn't do it.

02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:59.000
Robert Malone didn't do it. Judy Mikovitz hasn't done it.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:08.200
I mean, how far do we have to go? How many people do you want me to list? Because it's all of them.

02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:14.600
None of them have taught the biology of natural immunity. None of them have taught

02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:21.000
the extent to which transfection is wholly inappropriate for healthy humans. None of them

02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:28.200
have gone so far as to say that the vaccination schedule in America is a crime except for a very

02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:34.360
few Tess Laurie, Corey Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough.

02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:44.040
It is a very small group of people that is really fighting the fight right now and everybody else

02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:52.200
is faking it. Wittingly or unwittingly. And so you need to share my stream. You need to get this

02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:59.080
in front of all of them so that they can either wake up and apologize and course correct immediately

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:04.040
or they are put on alert that we actually know who they are.

02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.840
Because I'm done playing games with my children's future. This is just starting,

02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:16.360
ladies and gentlemen. My voice is just coming back.

02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:23.720
And I plan to exercise it a lot over the next couple of weeks, three weeks,

02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:30.520
four weeks, five weeks, five months, a year. I ain't stopping until this is stopped. I'm not

02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:36.760
stopping until the elimination of the control group is stopped. I'm not stopping until everyone

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:41.480
that is capable of understanding these two phrases understands them.

02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:45.160
Until these are common knowledge.

02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:53.720
Until it's common knowledge for a for a for an elementary school teacher to know this biology

02:45:53.720 --> 02:46:00.360
and to teach it. I'm going to be working here again to go biological. As long as CHD will have

02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:09.080
me, I'm going to be working for CHD because I think for the most part, although CHD would like

02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:19.320
to be a big top tent for health freedom. Health freedom is defined by this biology right here.

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:25.640
That there is no useful way to augment the human immune system through intramuscular injection.

02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:35.480
And this, this criminally negligent bad idea and all of those responsible directly or indirectly

02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:41.960
for petri perpetuating it for the last 20 plus years are criminally negligent liable

02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:50.840
demons. And I'm going to spend the rest of my adult life teaching this biology until it's

02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:59.400
I'm blue in the face or dead. So welcome to the show. Welcome to the big show. That's where we are

02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:08.760
ladies and gentlemen. I believe it's much more likely if it's a lab lead. Stop lying. Stop lying.

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:14.920
Stop lying. That's where we are ladies and gentlemen. Thanks very much for joining me and I will

02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:31.240
see you again tomorrow night. I hope you're aware and realize that I have no no equalizer here.

02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:39.080
There's no equalizer on my voice right now. This is just a it's a microphone that's actually

02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.040
a condenser microphone that's distant right it's supposed to have a direction.

02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:51.720
And so it's just a mic and my voice is really back. It feels stronger than ever. I can finally

02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.840
fill the gym during basketball practice and tell the boys what they're doing even when they're

02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:02.040
bouncing the ball. I basically have my old voice back and so I'm really really happy. I'm not

02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:07.480
going to be talking about it a lot anymore. But it was definitely worth taking the two weeks off

02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:14.040
that I did for the recovery of my voice and also just getting everything reoriented for the basketball

02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.760
season. And so there's going to be a little flexibility in terms of time but I'm either

02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:23.800
going to be basically going at about four forty five or five o'clock or I'm going to be going at

02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.240
about eight or eight thirty or nine o'clock. Just depending on the schedule at home I'm sorry

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.880
but my priority is my family and so I am going to make it a priority to be here on daily but

02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:37.800
the give and take of that is that there's got to be a little flexibility in the

02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:42.520
schedule so you won't be able to always watch it live. But if you look for me every day you'll

02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:49.800
definitely find me. Thanks very much for joining me and I'll see you guys again tomorrow.
