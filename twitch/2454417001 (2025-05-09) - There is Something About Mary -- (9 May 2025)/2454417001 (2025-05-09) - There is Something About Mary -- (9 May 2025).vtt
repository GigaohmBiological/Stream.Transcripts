WEBVTT

00:05.578 --> 00:07.680
Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.522
Then we'll deal with the two of you.

00:09.722 --> 00:10.523
The two of us?

00:11.044 --> 00:12.225
I hope you're proud of yourself.

00:12.545 --> 00:13.386
Uh, I kind of am.

00:13.746 --> 00:15.128
I saved the goddamn universe.

00:15.168 --> 00:16.429
That's not the issue, Rick!

00:16.449 --> 00:17.931
Uh, it would have been if I hadn't.

00:18.531 --> 00:21.774
The Vindicators say their job is to fight evil wherever it hides.

00:22.375 --> 00:27.503
But they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never hear them even mention.

00:27.923 --> 00:30.487
Because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.

00:31.148 --> 00:32.090
Oh, I know this.

00:32.370 --> 00:32.771
Dorian 5.

00:32.911 --> 00:34.233
Procubot, don't!

00:34.253 --> 00:35.715
There's no other possible answer.

00:35.855 --> 00:38.038
My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.

00:42.159 --> 00:43.580
I'm seeing more croc than bot here.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.540
God damn it!

00:44.800 --> 00:46.761
Uh, what happened on Dorian V?

00:46.901 --> 00:47.281
Nothing.

00:47.621 --> 00:47.941
Nothing?

00:48.322 --> 00:50.583
We exterminated a planet.

00:51.063 --> 00:51.623
Wait, huh?

00:51.783 --> 00:53.624
Doom-nomitron was hiding there.

00:53.784 --> 00:54.964
He's a shapeshifter.

00:55.104 --> 00:57.845
Destroying Dorian V was the only way to kill him.

00:57.966 --> 00:59.386
Come on, guys, we're all thinking it.

01:00.747 --> 01:01.567
Don't make me say it.

01:02.007 --> 01:03.008
Oh, okay.

01:03.248 --> 01:03.808
This again?

01:03.868 --> 01:08.350
You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doom-nomitron from orbit like that.

01:08.470 --> 01:09.950
I'm not the one that didn't want you back.

01:10.391 --> 01:10.951
Alan was.

01:11.311 --> 01:16.425
If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time... Do not threaten her.

01:19.616 --> 01:21.197
What the hell is Israel?

01:21.297 --> 01:24.240
It's just something Rick starts talking about when he's blackout drunk.

01:24.520 --> 01:24.720
What?

01:25.181 --> 01:26.101
In what way?

01:26.482 --> 01:27.603
Like, what's my point?

01:27.683 --> 01:28.804
In a way that has no point.

01:29.004 --> 01:32.247
You just babble about defense budgets in the United Nations, and then you pass out.

01:32.427 --> 01:40.313
So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.

01:40.373 --> 01:41.474
I have no stake in this.

01:41.514 --> 01:41.995
I don't either.

01:42.035 --> 01:47.800
I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it, and... Hey, man.

01:48.321 --> 01:49.248
I'm not touching this.

01:49.732 --> 01:50.357
You do you.

01:52.468 --> 02:01.490
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:01.510 --> 02:10.533
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:10.553 --> 02:19.035
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:19.735 --> 02:30.741
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:30.961 --> 02:37.164
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

02:37.524 --> 02:38.945
He was neurologically damaged.

02:39.846 --> 02:46.049
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

02:46.389 --> 02:47.790
He was neurologically damaged.

02:49.153 --> 02:51.274
condition that we will not call autism.

02:51.415 --> 02:52.955
I don't like the word autism.

02:53.836 --> 02:54.856
He was vaccine damaged.

03:18.047 --> 03:18.508
The end.

03:51.224 --> 04:19.120
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song I just can't remember who to send it to I've seen fire and I've seen rain

04:21.510 --> 04:25.453
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

04:27.634 --> 04:31.797
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.

04:34.219 --> 04:37.781
But I always thought that I'd see you again.

04:43.645 --> 04:45.907
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.989
You gotta help me make a stand.

04:51.192 --> 05:19.045
Just got to see me through another day My body's aching and my time is at hand I won't make it any other way Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain Seen sunny days that I thought would never end

05:21.618 --> 05:49.533
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I'd see you again Been walking my mind to an easy time My back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows It'll turn your head around

05:50.603 --> 05:56.185
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come.

05:57.886 --> 06:02.287
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.

06:04.388 --> 06:07.569
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

06:07.589 --> 06:13.331
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.913
I've seen lonely times when I could not find

06:21.943 --> 06:28.064
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again.

06:30.965 --> 06:35.026
Thought I'd see you one more time again.

06:35.126 --> 06:42.268
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now.

06:43.788 --> 06:46.249
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you,

06:54.888 --> 06:56.388
I definitely miss you, Nate.

06:57.749 --> 06:58.569
That's for sure.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.029
A lot.

07:00.789 --> 07:01.229
A lot.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.390
And I definitely thought I was going to see him again.

07:04.410 --> 07:11.872
This is Giga Home Biological, and this is no laughing matter.

07:12.932 --> 07:21.434
If you believe that RNA cannot pandemic and intramuscular injections are dumb, if you understand that transfection was always a crime in healthy people, and you understand

07:22.455 --> 07:38.848
that the population pyramid is a problem that they twisted and managed with murder and lies to create an illusion that they could enslave our children with, then you know that we have to fight a little harder than tweeting on social media.

07:38.888 --> 07:40.370
We have to fight a little bit harder

07:41.477 --> 07:43.639
than coming every day to watch this stream.

07:44.200 --> 07:44.961
It's not enough.

07:45.241 --> 07:46.843
It's not enough for Nate's memory.

07:46.903 --> 07:48.905
It's not enough for the people that you lost.

07:48.965 --> 07:51.628
It's not enough for all the damaged children in America.

07:51.648 --> 07:53.310
And it's not enough.

07:54.191 --> 07:55.312
It's just not enough.

07:57.199 --> 07:59.060
We have to do more, ladies and gentlemen.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.862
The voice that you hear is Jonathan Cooey.

08:00.902 --> 08:05.365
I'm Chief Biologist of GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief.

08:06.005 --> 08:13.170
Coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, you can see the state of my academic career on the Library of Medicine PubMed.

08:13.210 --> 08:16.693
You could have seen presentations that I gave to Panda, but they're all gone.

08:17.313 --> 08:28.680
But you can see some of my ideas on the substack called Woodhouse 76 where Jessica Hockett takes my ideas and has fakes dialogues with people like Claire Craig and Pierre Corey and Mike Eden and Jay Bhattacharya.

08:29.821 --> 08:37.445
Doesn't really matter because Children's Health Defense hired me and fired me after I had a great relationship with our Health and Human Services Secretary.

08:37.926 --> 08:44.210
And the reason why this has an easy explanation is because this is a national security operation.

08:44.830 --> 08:52.863
These people were put in place to curate a narrative to be sure that damage from the countermeasures would never, ever, ever

08:53.780 --> 09:10.268
be legally actionable, would never ever come under scrutiny except under the strict control of these actors so that the existence of the novel virus would never usefully be questioned and the threat of gain of function would never be questioned.

09:10.308 --> 09:16.732
And the reason why they had to do this, the reason why they had to murder a few Americans is so that they could lie to the globe.

09:17.472 --> 09:20.673
about the value of intramuscular injection.

09:20.733 --> 09:24.815
Lie to the globe about the value of transfection.

09:24.875 --> 09:28.876
And that's exactly why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.017
That's what's crucial to understand here.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.919
A spectacular commitment to lies is all that is required.

09:34.999 --> 09:38.900
And that's what you are witnessing right now on TV and social media.

09:38.920 --> 09:45.703
It is a spectacular commitment to lies that is orchestrated by actors put in place

09:46.550 --> 09:52.236
This is a multi, multi-decade human genome project continuation.

09:52.276 --> 09:53.117
This is Act 4.

09:54.478 --> 10:06.290
And the reason why you don't know who this is, or a lot of you don't know who this is, or most of the people who are on Team Robert Malone don't know who this is, like Mary Talley Bowden, is because it's by design.

10:07.745 --> 10:19.516
Mary Talley Bowden probably has no idea the long and rich history of autism advocation that this woman has done and the number of votes that she's swayed.

10:19.937 --> 10:31.888
She probably has no idea, Mary Talley Bowden, that she's being duped by a group of people that together, as long as they keep lying and telling her she's doing great, she will never realize how she's been used.

10:33.840 --> 10:45.471
Just like Brandy Vaughn never realized how these people were standing in front of her, how she was being ignored, how she was being diluted, and eventually how she would be used and then thrown away.

10:51.977 --> 10:57.843
And so I keep coming back to this slide because it's absolutely important to understand that on this slide, there's only a few people missing.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.345
and it doesn't take all of them.

11:01.425 --> 11:04.657
Many of them may have no idea or just have agreed not to care.

11:07.059 --> 11:36.060
But if you agreed not to care in order to surf on four continents, if you agreed not to care in order to get $50,000 a month from a Substack, if you agreed not to care in order to sell a book, if you agreed not to care in order to have a successful podcast deal with Rumble, if you agreed not to care to be a part of the wellness company and get $5,000 a month in stipend, if you agreed not to care and took a stipend from Brownstone or FLCCC, you are a traitor to our children.

11:37.233 --> 11:40.598
Because intramuscular injection is not medicine.

11:41.198 --> 11:43.281
Because RNA cannot pandemic.

11:43.341 --> 11:47.286
And because it was always transformation and transfection.

11:47.306 --> 11:53.415
And these people who worked for the Human Genome Project and affiliated industries have known that.

11:57.628 --> 12:10.539
Now, the other day I showed you a video of this character speaking in October of 2020 in front of some fake group of people somewhere in Pittsburgh before he moved away to escape me.

12:11.400 --> 12:25.792
The same month that I was fired from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, this man gave some kind of ridiculous pro-Trump talk about how we were screwing up the response and about how people were making COVID all kinds of political.

12:27.816 --> 12:38.862
Now, I keep coming back to James Lyons Wyler because he features very, very prominently in the Skyhorse Publishing CHD Pyramid of Lies.

12:40.183 --> 12:56.853
He is an author of a book, which is essentially a book that Paul Offit would have written, titled The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism, which reinforces the idea that there are causes for something called autism and that it's a pretty complicated story.

12:58.666 --> 13:02.931
And at the foundation of this ridiculous statement, of course, is autism.

13:03.472 --> 13:08.117
The word that Brian Hooker would not use because his son didn't have autism.

13:08.738 --> 13:10.180
He was vaccine damaged.

13:10.620 --> 13:15.266
He was neurologically damaged and we will not call his condition autism.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.471
That's Brian Hooker, 2013.

13:17.931 --> 13:27.378
And Brian Hooker, 2020, was all about asymptomatic spread and the proper testing of vaccines, which should be done, but isn't quite being done.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.600
Antibodies are immunity, kinda.

13:30.921 --> 13:32.362
And promoting this man.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.501
as he continues to do today.

13:36.561 --> 13:37.721
Now, why is that relevant?

13:37.761 --> 13:55.184
Because I think by focusing on this man before the pandemic and through the beginning of the pandemic, where he had all these interesting molecular insights on the fear and cleavage site and all these special epitopes that should be taken out of the vaccine, according to this talk, but they never did.

13:55.645 --> 14:04.186
All these vaccine manufacturers ignored my warnings about pathogenic priming, which is his own made up word for antibody dependent enhancement.

14:07.987 --> 14:27.525
trying to, you know, improve the word, to cover more options, or to make it more biologically relevant, which is just nonsense, because it still accepts the presupposition of a novel virus for which we need to make a novel memory for, which is the whole basis for this illusion in the first place, the acceptance of that myth.

14:29.062 --> 14:53.748
Now, if we focus on 2021, one year later, we can find really interesting trail of tears here because in 2021, in October 28th, 2021, James Lyons Weiler, the guy that I showed you in the video previously is here in the middle of this Zoom meeting with Steve Kirsch and Mike Eden and Jessica Rose and Mark Giraudeau and Matt Crawford.

14:55.615 --> 15:04.261
And I can personally attest to all of those people personally as being consistent meddlers.

15:04.361 --> 15:11.125
Now, Mike Eden hasn't really lied about me, but he has been disingenuous several times.

15:11.785 --> 15:16.248
Jessica Rose has never lied about me, but she has omitted me since March of 2023.

15:17.589 --> 15:22.212
Matt Crawford has lied about me consistently in a Bitcoin chat that he

15:24.113 --> 15:28.057
he orchestrated on Signal, and I have countless examples of it.

15:28.837 --> 15:44.171
Steve Kirsch more or less has lied to me because he's pretended like he didn't know things and called me and pretended that I, that people, you know, he even offered to send me to Tokyo to work with Kevin McCarran on his mouse experiments a few years ago, if you can believe that.

15:44.251 --> 15:46.133
I have the text message to prove that.

15:46.733 --> 16:05.912
So these people all were on a show together hosted by James Lyons Weiler in November 28, 2021, where Steve Kirsch pretends to have tried to organize a sort of debate between these people and a bunch of doctors that think that COVID is real.

16:06.633 --> 16:33.431
and they were going to discuss whether you know it's appropriate and this is that it's appropriate and they had all this list of questions they were going to ask but then just like all the other stunts with Steve Kirsch that will happen after this point Steve offers some money Steve makes a challenge and then nobody will take my challenge so I guess I must be right and so Steve Kirsch is testing this out now orchestrating it now with the help of Jessica Rose, Mike Eden

16:34.471 --> 16:46.457
Mark Giordano of Panda, Matt Crawford, and James Lyons-Weiler, one of the worst actors in the fake anti-vax movement pre-2020, never mind post-2020.

16:46.537 --> 16:53.119
Let's close this window over here on this other thing, drop this down, test.

16:54.100 --> 16:54.280
Nope.

16:55.984 --> 16:56.384
There we go.

16:57.664 --> 17:01.625
And so I want to watch this video, but I want to put it in context before I do.

17:02.146 --> 17:13.568
And that context is of course, right before the November 28th, 21 video, he had Steve Kirsch on by himself on October 16th.

17:14.289 --> 17:23.731
And then after this little video that we're going to watch, of course he had Peter McCullough on, he had Meryl Nass on, and he had Pierre Cory on.

17:24.921 --> 17:30.550
And all the while, right, we're two and a half years into the pandemic, we're at the end of the murder down here.

17:30.590 --> 17:32.613
Look at how much murder happened in America.

17:34.235 --> 17:38.742
And all that murder is happening and all this time these people don't learn jack.

17:39.502 --> 17:41.523
They don't figure out anything.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.443
They don't come to any conclusions.

17:43.483 --> 17:46.264
They're not able to prioritize their questions.

17:46.865 --> 17:51.947
They're not able to rank order what they find the most conspicuous problem of the pandemic.

17:52.347 --> 17:58.949
They just have an endless list of laundry, a laundry list of questions that they won't even actually list in this video.

18:00.430 --> 18:03.571
And so remember the, the context of the video is this.

18:04.875 --> 18:18.288
that somewhere between the start in 2020 and the end of the murder in 2022, one of these people should have figured something else out besides COVID shot bad, don't talk about 2020.

18:19.329 --> 18:24.394
But all of them are very happy to talk COVID shot bad, don't talk about 2020.

18:25.795 --> 18:28.718
Maybe lab leak spike protein, something like that.

18:29.727 --> 18:35.851
So that's the context of this video, 28th of November, 2021.

18:36.712 --> 18:37.212
Let's see.

18:37.532 --> 18:39.314
So what do we have in this video?

18:39.334 --> 18:40.855
We have James Lyons Weiler.

18:42.392 --> 18:52.282
Skyhorse author, Paul Offit autism book, on stage at every CHD event, on stage with Brandy Vaughn, says diseases spread asymptomatically.

18:52.342 --> 19:01.511
I have at least three videos from three different years where he explains that vaccine-preventable diseases spread asymptomatically on the background of those people.

19:03.231 --> 19:10.135
and says everyone should be genetically screened because of course that's how we're gonna find the vulnerable population to these treatments and we can make alternatives.

19:10.755 --> 19:22.722
Jessica Rose is not an MD, but everybody introduces her as Dr. Jessica Rose because she apparently has five postdoctoral degrees, post-secondary degrees in five different fields, which is of course bullshit.

19:23.182 --> 19:26.644
She is most aptly described as a viral modeler by training.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.225
Her postdoctoral work was funded by NATO.

19:29.265 --> 19:31.086
She has toured the world with Robert Malone

19:31.901 --> 19:37.468
Um, in the international COVID summit, she's never spoken out about the use of Israel as a laboratory.

19:37.869 --> 19:48.461
She has consistently spoken as a bears expert for almost six years, which is dead on balls accurate for the epi girl character in the spars pandemic document.

19:48.962 --> 20:03.714
And finally, behind my head, we have Steve Kirsch, a proud information spreader for the last four years, flaunts his monetary intellectual challenges that nobody can win, has the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, was on Dark Horse with Malone in June of 2021.

20:06.036 --> 20:08.398
pushed the combined early treatment trials.

20:08.438 --> 20:21.466
Remember, he thought that if we could drug everybody with ivermectin and fluvoxamine, that we would be out of this pandemic in 60 days, and had a steering committee on which a lot of these people, including myself, was on.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.383
I wasn't on his steering committee as long as other people were.

20:27.044 --> 20:35.632
But the point is, is that his steering committee is one of these places where an illusion of consensus can be created by a few planted liars.

20:36.833 --> 20:45.903
Now, if you knew who was in his steering committee when I joined, it was Jessica Rose and Matt Crawford and Marc Giraudeau.

20:46.736 --> 20:55.591
and Peter McCullough and Kevin McKernan and John Baldwin, and those people can get into a discussion that can convince somebody like me that I might not be right.

20:56.752 --> 20:58.354
And that's exactly what they do.

20:58.434 --> 21:08.605
The other people that are in this chat, of course, Mike Eden, a retired pharma guy who used to work for Pfizer and was a big whistleblower in 2020, but what about?

21:09.226 --> 21:18.776
He was a whistleblower about natural immunity, which accepted the existence of the new virus, just that maybe natural immunity was okay and we should test for it.

21:20.285 --> 21:23.647
Previous coronaviruses are real PCR works and sequencing works.

21:24.167 --> 21:32.573
No mention of impurities from manufacturing, even though he himself admits he was a 20-year, big-time head of respiratory diseases.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.234
So he knows how biologics are made.

21:35.875 --> 21:41.118
Which means he knows that if they use those same processes to make this RNA, it will never be pure.

21:41.939 --> 21:43.039
He has to know that.

21:43.900 --> 21:48.443
Because they can't use anion exchange chromatography to clean it up.

21:49.335 --> 21:51.016
like you would if it was a biologic.

21:52.558 --> 21:55.060
And so he's stuck on a limited spectrum of debate too.

21:55.100 --> 22:02.746
I know a lot of people don't like to hear that Mike Eden is a bad guy, but he's had extensive, extensive communication with me over the last four years.

22:02.786 --> 22:04.487
We've never had a bad relationship.

22:04.948 --> 22:17.558
He's just decided to slag me off very recently where Sasha Latupova can also comment in his sub stack, calling me JJ, which is actually really depressing because, you know, again, we know that that's a,

22:19.195 --> 22:21.136
That's a way that this is done.

22:21.916 --> 22:27.038
No links, not like gigaohmbiological.com or anything like that was in the links.

22:27.438 --> 22:36.462
Very similar to an interview I just did with Dan Cohen, where somehow or another in that YouTube video, I don't know if Dan Cohen's a bad guy, but why aren't there any links for me?

22:37.343 --> 22:43.085
Why after that YouTube video, are there only links like six or eight links for all of the ways you can pay him?

22:45.834 --> 22:51.888
What did I do in that interview except for give him two hours of my time and now everybody should donate money to him for that time?

22:54.451 --> 22:55.752
This is Mark Giordano.

22:56.212 --> 22:58.194
He's an industrial processes engineer.

22:58.254 --> 22:59.675
He has a lot of experience.

22:59.715 --> 23:00.456
He's in Panda.

23:00.496 --> 23:06.560
He was on Steve Kirsch's steering committee, which also already makes it weird if he's in Panda's main group.

23:07.221 --> 23:19.270
Always Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler are plugging this guy like he's some kind of smart dude, but he's not because he has a book about this ridiculously dumb, simple idea about the idea of bolus injection.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.112
And if you just don't hit a vein, everything is fine.

23:22.512 --> 23:27.016
And his one evidence for it is that people who inject testosterone in their muscles agree with him.

23:29.938 --> 23:30.899
This guy's a monster.

23:32.039 --> 23:32.680
He's a fake.

23:34.101 --> 23:41.967
And he's resulted in ridiculing me on Twitter just like Kevin McKernan did, just like Nick Hudson does, just like Jessica Hockett did.

23:42.007 --> 23:42.588
They all do it.

23:43.413 --> 23:51.319
Matt Crawford's an especially interesting guy because he's a prodigy day trader, supposedly the victim of some kind of rape camp military intelligence thing.

23:52.279 --> 23:55.041
Described himself as a math wizard.

23:55.422 --> 23:59.865
He was in the original Signal Chat with me, with Brett Weinstein.

23:59.925 --> 24:04.108
He actually was on Steve Kirsch's steering committee and added me to it, more or less.

24:04.528 --> 24:07.190
He met Malone on a beach in 2020, but that doesn't matter.

24:07.810 --> 24:12.674
And went from my best buddy to zero, just like Jessica Hockett did on the way out,

24:13.919 --> 24:19.183
We had a stream with Mark Kulak and with George Webb.

24:19.223 --> 24:27.230
And after that stream, Matt Crawford tried to convince me that Mark Kulak was a bad guy and that I had to take his word for it because he was in a rape camp.

24:28.170 --> 24:30.793
And I can't make that up because that's actually what happened.

24:31.974 --> 24:43.363
He said that Mark Kulak triggered a traumatic memory from his early childhood using a trigger phrase that people in that rape camp used to use on him.

24:44.534 --> 24:46.896
Now, how am I supposed to, what am I supposed to do there?

24:46.956 --> 24:48.257
Mark, did you say those words?

24:48.317 --> 24:50.078
And Mark's like, I don't know, I don't think so.

24:50.519 --> 24:51.480
But what are those words?

24:51.560 --> 24:52.220
What is that?

24:53.421 --> 24:56.263
It's such a weird part of this history.

24:56.303 --> 24:57.324
And when did that occur?

24:57.764 --> 25:07.012
It occurred right when Matthew Crawford was trying to explain what Omicron was, but not explaining it the way I was explaining it some other way.

25:07.072 --> 25:10.995
And when Matt Crawford was really big on the DMED database, which is probably bullshit.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.927
All 2021, don't you see?

25:16.048 --> 25:20.854
I was in the signal chat with Brett Weinstein trying to explain to him that transfection was gonna cause autoimmunity.

25:20.894 --> 25:21.956
We had to stop it now.

25:24.239 --> 25:25.461
And this is what they were doing.

25:27.303 --> 25:29.086
This is what they were doing at that time.

25:31.687 --> 25:40.817
putting together these fake debates with Steve Kirsch and pretending that they, I didn't get into the Steve Kirsch steering committee until 2022 and that's 2021, right?

25:40.877 --> 25:44.701
So when I say that these people are there, it's really important to see it.

25:44.741 --> 25:46.103
This is scary stuff.

25:51.228 --> 25:52.209
Did I not put it in?

25:52.970 --> 25:53.731
I thought I put it in.

25:55.620 --> 25:56.841
I didn't even put the video in.

25:56.941 --> 25:57.181
Okay.

25:57.221 --> 25:58.341
Well, we got to watch that video.

25:58.361 --> 26:00.323
So I got to, let me just get out of here quick.

26:00.563 --> 26:01.883
I didn't mean to go to this slide yet.

26:03.124 --> 26:05.225
I'll get out of here and put this in.

26:05.245 --> 26:07.846
Uh, sorry about that.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.228
Insert video.

26:11.729 --> 26:12.309
Lucky for you.

26:12.389 --> 26:13.489
I know right where it is.

26:15.531 --> 26:16.291
If it would just work.

26:16.701 --> 26:17.161
There we go.

26:21.202 --> 26:21.683
There it is.

26:22.203 --> 26:28.685
I'm going to make it black and white because I don't like watching color videos and I'm going to play it back automatically.

26:29.345 --> 26:31.026
And so where are we?

26:31.066 --> 26:31.466
We're here.

26:35.808 --> 26:38.491
And so, yes, I can't stress it enough.

26:38.531 --> 26:39.413
They were put in place.

26:39.653 --> 26:52.869
And now that we have this much history to look back on and to compare to what their current behavior is, I think it without a shadow of a doubt, these people are actors and we have been bamboozled by them in America.

26:55.301 --> 26:56.742
2021, November 28th, 2021.

26:56.982 --> 27:14.413
Okay, well, we're gathered here today with a very disappointing outcome of attempt to hold a debate with physicians MDs who, to a person, felt that it was important enough for them to join us on a debate.

27:14.873 --> 27:23.699
And there was a slight confusion on their part, apparently, and we're not sure where it fell apart, but we're sitting here in Zoom,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.802
And uh, we have prepared our questions.

27:27.322 --> 27:33.346
We also are prepared to answer questions that they have on their side And they have failed to show up steve.

27:33.366 --> 27:36.648
Do you want to fill everybody in on the background of the communications with the other side?

27:37.109 --> 27:50.778
Sure, this started uh friday on uh on clubhouse and uh, and this is uh, and eli, um, uh, basically was moderating a room and we said happy to

27:53.188 --> 27:55.990
I could probably just go, what can I do here?

27:56.011 --> 27:57.352
Do I need the X position?

27:59.133 --> 27:59.554
Wait, what?

27:59.874 --> 28:00.735
Which one am I using?

28:03.737 --> 28:04.638
Oh, it's that one's on.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.159
I could put this one on.

28:08.021 --> 28:08.682
This one's on.

28:09.322 --> 28:09.783
So.

28:09.803 --> 28:10.884
Debate them anytime.

28:10.924 --> 28:13.646
And then he called me back and he said, they're ready to debate today.

28:13.666 --> 28:18.150
And I said, great, but it'll take me a couple of days to get the team together.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.352
Let me send you a Zoom link.

28:21.690 --> 28:24.012
and we will do a recorded Zoom call.

28:25.173 --> 28:29.496
And this way we can, first of all, you're not allowed to record on Clubhouse.

28:30.417 --> 28:35.822
And the Zoom allows us to see people's faces and who they are and make sure they're legitimate.

28:37.443 --> 28:38.304
So there's no hiding.

28:39.084 --> 28:50.573
And the rules of the debate- Again, so the idea is to recall that in 2021, this was like maybe one of the first times that Steve Kirsch is gonna pull this stunt, but then he's gonna go on X and do this for years.

28:51.542 --> 29:02.971
Challenge people to debate him on this and that and he's gonna do it at MIT one time where he's gonna like I guess nobody's gonna show up And he's gonna present some data from here some data from there.

29:03.031 --> 29:09.717
I'm a data scientist I like to do data and he hires people to do data, but he's really just he's just full of shit

29:10.851 --> 29:18.294
But this is when he, you know, this is really in the heart of the murder in 2021, at the end of 2021.

29:18.755 --> 29:21.996
Eight then would be fair on both sides.

29:22.196 --> 29:25.377
Everybody would play by exactly the same rules.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.998
Each side would be able to ask the other side.

29:27.038 --> 29:30.960
Just to clear that up, I don't know who this is and I don't know who this is.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.622
And because I had to move myself to the other side of the screen, I'm gonna be looking over there.

29:35.982 --> 29:41.407
When really I probably should be looking over there, but I'm not going to do that because I can't watch the video if I look over there.

29:41.507 --> 29:42.768
So anyway, you just have to deal with that.

29:44.448 --> 29:51.891
side questions, it would alternate between one side asking the question and then once they're done and it goes back and forth, then the other side asks the questions.

29:52.411 --> 29:53.652
Totally fair debate.

29:54.412 --> 29:55.752
We don't control the agenda.

29:55.932 --> 29:58.834
OK, so let's just let's just point out what's happening here.

29:58.874 --> 30:00.054
We're not getting anywhere.

30:00.074 --> 30:02.075
No one's learning anything from this.

30:02.135 --> 30:10.218
Instead, Steve Kirsch is whining about how he and detailing all the ways that he tried to make it as objective and fair debate as possible.

30:10.779 --> 30:11.681
Blah blah blah blah blah.

30:11.701 --> 30:17.054
We're not talking about what the debate was or why it was important for these people to debate those people.

30:18.499 --> 30:19.240
Isn't that weird?

30:19.440 --> 30:28.127
Instead, we're talking about the hypothetical, you know, perfect nature of the debate given the, you know, constraints of Zoom and whatever.

30:28.567 --> 30:31.169
That's the magnificence of this bullshit.

30:31.650 --> 30:46.162
How much time they can waste when in reality, the issue is they are using PCR to lie to us about pulling out a high fidelity signal from a background they cannot pull a high fidelity signal from.

30:48.021 --> 31:04.230
an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals composed of bacteriophages and all of the other signals that we have not been able to quantify in nature that metabiota went around the world talking about the black biology or something like that.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.011
The biological dark matter.

31:07.412 --> 31:09.373
We control what questions we ask.

31:09.813 --> 31:12.234
They control whatever questions they ask.

31:14.476 --> 31:35.828
but apparently there was not a meeting of the minds because we were going through an intermediary, Eli, and it was apparently not communicated that we wanted a recorded debate on Zoom and that he was supposed to stream it to Clubhouse for other people to listen in live if they wanted, but it was supposed to be a video debate.

31:36.188 --> 31:36.909
We're all here

31:37.509 --> 31:42.050
we're all ready to go for two hours or three hours or however long it took.

31:42.490 --> 31:49.832
So I went into Clubhouse and explained this and they kicked me off the stage and then they removed me from the room.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.494
And you said earlier that they actually reported that you left.

31:56.114 --> 32:02.096
Well, you know, I took a screenshot here of them kicking me off the stage.

32:02.716 --> 32:03.516
So here it is.

32:05.001 --> 32:10.785
Um, where you can see, uh, let me, let me turn off my, my, uh, you send that to me.

32:10.845 --> 32:12.266
I'll mix it in the videos.

32:12.607 --> 32:12.787
Yeah.

32:12.887 --> 32:13.467
Okay, great.

32:13.867 --> 32:18.671
So I'll send that to you where they basically funny that it never got mixed into the video.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.000
So Clubhouse is another one of these things, like Telegram.

32:23.020 --> 32:23.901
It was just bullshit.

32:23.981 --> 32:29.023
How many times I wasted my time on Clubhouse talking to a couple groups in the UK?

32:29.563 --> 32:35.245
Hundreds of questions, hundreds of questions, no new followers, no links given.

32:35.865 --> 32:37.066
It's just ridiculous.

32:39.082 --> 32:54.534
If these people really believe that I have something worth interviewing me about, and when they hear that RNA cannot pandemic, that intramuscular injection is not a way of administering medicine, and that it was always transformation and transfection technologies,

32:55.595 --> 32:57.817
and that these people are in place to lie about it.

32:57.877 --> 33:08.584
It's really strange that that doesn't kind of prioritize over, I don't know, talking about space dragons, but apparently it's just podcast after podcast after podcast.

33:08.644 --> 33:20.612
And even if they do learn something during the podcast, it's time to reset and treat the next guest as equally relevant and equally valuable information provider because that's what podcasts do.

33:21.252 --> 33:25.435
That's why I don't interview anyone because I don't know who I would interview besides Mark Kulak.

33:29.137 --> 33:39.103
have kicked me off the stage, and then they disabled hand raising so that none of our other people could go and say, hey, let me explain that he didn't leave.

33:39.464 --> 33:43.206
He was kicked into the audience, and then he was kicked out of the room.

33:43.846 --> 33:45.848
So this is the censorship.

33:46.508 --> 33:54.053
So this is hardly a fair, you know, them wanting to debate us.

33:55.529 --> 33:58.230
Okay, so we waited for, by my count.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.912
So that's censorship, right?

34:01.012 --> 34:02.432
The doctors won't talk to us.

34:02.492 --> 34:04.713
They wouldn't join our Zoom meeting on Clubhouse.

34:05.474 --> 34:11.817
That's Steve Kersh, anything that they can twist around as well, I'm being censored, they do it.

34:13.208 --> 34:19.011
Steve Kirsch is censored, even though his non-profit is funded by the Skoll Foundation.

34:19.051 --> 34:21.592
Yeah, go ahead, tell me about your censorship.

34:22.373 --> 34:27.015
21 minutes here in Zoom, and it was communicated to them three or four times through different channels.

34:27.717 --> 34:30.039
that this was the agreed upon format location.

34:32.520 --> 34:43.688
The most important thing here for me is to realize that their presence in a stream with James Lyons-Weiler titled Unbreaking Science admits that they are part of this network.

34:44.789 --> 34:49.432
At one point in time, I am very happy to admit I was part of this network.

34:50.173 --> 34:56.117
And they were very, very interested in having me be one of the people that could be an expert on the lab leak.

34:57.031 --> 35:20.546
That is precisely why I believe I am still listed in this book because at the time of its publication, they were still betting on the fact that I would capitulate, that I would take a job with CHD, that Brian Hooker would get me to help him establish a health tent, a big top tent of health freedom, and that I would be happy to do it because they paid me $105,000 a year to be on a couple Zoom meetings a week.

35:26.374 --> 35:32.298
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't like my job right now, except for the fact that I know it has to be done.

35:32.418 --> 35:33.759
So I don't have any choices here.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.342
This is information that needs to get out in order to preserve my kids' freedom.

35:38.882 --> 35:43.345
This is information that needs to get out so that I am unerasable.

35:44.385 --> 35:51.310
So that the only possible outcome of erasing me would be that this information goes viral.

35:52.290 --> 35:53.031
That doesn't happen.

35:54.821 --> 36:05.206
But I feel like right now the most important information that I have is based on the experience of me writing this book with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., our now Health and Human Services Secretary.

36:06.087 --> 36:08.008
I believe that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:08.068 --> 36:18.873
is essentially a victim of a Truman show that took advantage of his desire to save his country and to do good by his dad's legacy.

36:20.356 --> 36:32.682
They knew that from a very young age he was motivated to do that, and they convinced him that environmentalist causes might be a good way for him to build that record and that track record that would get him there.

36:34.403 --> 36:37.284
I think his family and his friends told him that for a long time.

36:37.324 --> 36:42.947
And then this whole vaccine thing came along, and he's not lying when he says he came in kicking and screaming.

36:42.987 --> 36:44.308
He still doesn't want to do it.

36:45.438 --> 36:52.700
Because his goal was to save America in a different way, or change America for his friends, or his handlers, or whatever.

36:52.760 --> 36:58.082
I don't know what it was, but he's not really in control.

36:58.242 --> 37:03.264
Even though all these people were organized to get him there, he's not really in control.

37:07.347 --> 37:09.350
These people were part of the Truman Show.

37:09.410 --> 37:23.668
Jessica Rose, Mike Yeadon, Mark Giordano, Matt Crawford, James Lyons-Weiler, Steve Kirsch, they're all involved directly or indirectly with coordinating this social media momentum.

37:24.465 --> 37:30.767
that is amplified by social media programming so that when they want to show Bobby something, they can just show him.

37:30.807 --> 37:33.167
Look, on social media right now, trending is this.

37:33.807 --> 37:38.448
If they want to show the president what's going on, they can look at social media and say, look what's trending right now.

37:38.508 --> 37:39.669
We've got control of them.

37:40.189 --> 37:42.849
Most of the people in the world are arguing about this.

37:43.370 --> 37:44.630
That's how they use it.

37:45.390 --> 38:11.054
Just like they get you to think that your scroll is a representation of reality, they use the data on social media, honestly or dishonestly represented, to communicate to the leaders of the world what's going on, to demonstrate to the leaders of the world what's going on, and to tell them that they have a better handle and control over what's going on, and more importantly, what's being argued about than ever before.

38:13.058 --> 38:18.303
Never before, Mr. President, have we had so much control over what these monkeys argue about.

38:19.705 --> 38:23.389
And the way we accomplish it is putting people like Jessica Rose on the internet.

38:24.970 --> 38:34.020
The way we accomplish it is putting people like James Lyons Weiler whispering in the ear of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:35.424 --> 38:38.465
Mary Holland whispering in the ear of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:38.505 --> 38:42.025
Meryl Nass whispering in the ear of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:42.105 --> 38:43.866
That's how this is accomplished.

38:45.086 --> 38:46.506
And so he doesn't need to know.

38:46.906 --> 38:50.607
Maybe Mike Eden is not even aware of how badly he's being used.

38:50.647 --> 38:56.248
But at some point in time, he has been told or made the choice to ignore me.

38:57.208 --> 39:00.109
Instead, turned on me, not even two weeks ago.

39:01.469 --> 39:04.810
Because he saw himself apparently on my screen.

39:06.055 --> 39:14.362
and didn't understand that the reason why he was in the top row is because those people in the top row are probably the ones that needed convincing.

39:16.163 --> 39:18.685
Yes, Mike, I think you're a victim too.

39:21.467 --> 39:22.268
What's your next step?

39:22.308 --> 39:28.773
Are you going to invite them to another debate, find another team of physicians that want to stand up for their paradigm?

39:30.595 --> 39:42.063
Well, you know, we can extend the offer to them one more time, same place, same time next week, same rules as we had proposed for this one.

39:43.264 --> 39:45.026
I've sent Eli the rules.

39:46.447 --> 39:52.851
So he has all the rules of the debate and we'll see whether they want to accept.

39:52.871 --> 39:56.654
But when they said, they basically said, well, we don't want to do it on a recorded call.

39:58.986 --> 40:00.868
That's ridiculous.

40:01.969 --> 40:03.291
I guess they don't want to stand behind.

40:03.351 --> 40:12.060
I don't want, you know, they don't want, there are any words that they say to be, you know, used with, they're, they're, they're afraid.

40:12.801 --> 40:14.043
That's how I would interpret that.

40:14.863 --> 40:16.565
We're, we're ready.

40:16.665 --> 40:16.846
Yeah.

40:16.906 --> 40:19.789
Angela, you could, you could talk about what happened when you went into the room.

40:20.253 --> 40:28.439
Yeah, no, we're ready to show our faces, show our titles, show our backgrounds, show the world who we are and what we stand for.

40:29.240 --> 40:33.763
And we have no problem being recorded and having this placed wherever it needs to be placed.

40:34.284 --> 40:42.910
And so I don't really have the time or interest to hide behind somebody on Clubhouse where we don't even know who these people are.

40:42.930 --> 40:45.052
It's just a waste of time.

40:45.112 --> 40:47.994
And I think that this is the most appropriate place for us to do that.

40:48.410 --> 40:50.111
be discussing with physicians.

40:51.192 --> 40:53.333
My understanding is that we did know who they are.

40:53.653 --> 40:54.894
Do we have a list of their names?

40:58.836 --> 40:59.857
I just have two of them.

41:00.517 --> 41:01.838
Dr. Copeland and Dr. Priya.

41:02.258 --> 41:02.699
That's it.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.001
Does anyone have anything else to add?

41:07.341 --> 41:10.003
It's just weird because they haven't said what they're afraid of.

41:10.203 --> 41:11.624
What are they afraid of exactly?

41:11.664 --> 41:13.845
Getting their names associated with these people?

41:13.885 --> 41:14.746
What are they afraid of?

41:14.886 --> 41:17.568
It's like an imaginary theater because that's what it is.

41:18.450 --> 41:21.092
It's like really kind of bullshit because that's what it is.

41:21.172 --> 41:28.599
Steve Kirsch specializes in these bullshit theater stories about how he offered people a million dollars and no one could respond.

41:30.601 --> 41:38.628
Notice that Steve Kirsch did not offer a million dollars for a doctor to prove why intramuscular injection in some cases might be okay.

41:40.129 --> 41:47.495
Notice that he didn't offer a million dollars for somebody to explain why transfection would be a great way to augment the immune system.

41:47.535 --> 41:55.080
This is just, he didn't offer somebody a million dollars to explain how the population pyramid wasn't used.

41:59.384 --> 42:00.625
It's just so malevolent.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.665
It's so traitorous.

42:03.507 --> 42:05.849
Well, this thing is extremely disappointing.

42:06.949 --> 42:08.010
So I might even,

42:09.514 --> 42:13.358
I was a long time head of allergy and respiratory research at Pfizer.

42:14.259 --> 42:17.462
And I ran my own company afterwards in the last 10 years.

42:17.522 --> 42:21.585
So there's a lot of wrong things going on, really bad things as well.

42:22.086 --> 42:30.254
And I and I know everyone else on this call, have thought very carefully about three or four questions that are really straightforward questions that if you

42:30.874 --> 43:00.080
if we were to pose these to a member of the public or anybody watching whether professional or just a member of the public they think well yeah i really want to know the answer to that question and uh and look at jessica rose nodding up and down but notice what's happening here they don't list the question just three or four questions he said that we would like to know the answer to what are the questions mike what questions are they jessica and rose

43:04.359 --> 43:08.621
We have our own answers and we would love to debate it with another team.

43:09.241 --> 43:11.862
The problem is that they won't come and debate it.

43:12.122 --> 43:13.622
They literally won't come and debate it.

43:14.603 --> 43:16.863
And that's why I'm feeling very disappointed.

43:16.903 --> 43:20.224
But as Steve said, we will stand ready to do this again.

43:20.784 --> 43:26.986
Any team would like to go, you know, just respectfully, let's just trade views on these really important questions.

43:27.467 --> 43:31.788
On these really important questions that are so important, we're not going to say them in this video.

43:33.038 --> 43:34.800
The one that we're going to leave up on YouTube.

43:35.700 --> 43:36.541
You know, that one.

43:38.743 --> 43:39.804
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

43:40.064 --> 43:43.247
I've thought deeply about these things and a lot of wrong things happening.

43:43.788 --> 43:45.049
That's why I keep speaking up.

43:46.911 --> 43:53.637
And furthermore, it seems as though we are always willing to be wrong.

43:54.161 --> 43:54.682
We don't mind.

43:56.764 --> 43:58.606
That's why debates are.

43:58.806 --> 44:02.470
And I'm also, this is the second time this happened to me.

44:02.490 --> 44:08.517
I'm very disappointed that they didn't, because, well, besides the fact that we're all gathered here.

44:09.025 --> 44:15.551
We put time and effort into being here, and we did put some time and effort into generating question sets.

44:16.192 --> 44:16.713
Interesting.

44:16.773 --> 44:25.982
She's not worried about the fact that I put time and effort to over six hours of presentations to a group called Panda in South Africa, and they just didn't post those.

44:27.063 --> 44:28.344
She's a member of that group.

44:28.424 --> 44:31.107
Panda's posted a lot of her videos up, but not mine.

44:32.165 --> 44:39.868
Not the three separate lectures, one about immunology, one about virology, and one about just like the population pyramid and murder.

44:40.788 --> 44:41.328
All gone.

44:42.368 --> 44:47.310
My immunology lecture was said by David Wiseman to be the best immunology lecture he'd ever heard.

44:50.551 --> 44:55.653
But David Wiseman won't stand up for me to ask Nick Hudson for my videos to get put up.

44:56.786 --> 44:58.047
because that was their job.

44:58.127 --> 45:03.730
Panda was to record my ideas and then recirculate them in shittier form.

45:03.770 --> 45:21.341
That's basically what Jonathan Engler, Jessica Hockett, and Nick Hudson have engaged in over the last four years in cooperation with some character named Jicky Leaks in Australia, who also recycled some of my ideas for a little while before they finally were too much for him to recycle.

45:25.103 --> 45:34.887
Jessica Rose at one point in March of 2023 said that she thinks that I described exactly what happened when I said and explained what clones were.

45:35.408 --> 45:40.650
In a stream with Kevin McKernan, Stephanie Seneff, and John Bodwin listening.

45:43.531 --> 45:51.535
And now she doesn't mention my name ever, doesn't talk about clones at all, never mind the fact that that also meant that PCR is bullshit.

45:52.947 --> 45:58.930
Because the whole idea of these people is to make sure that you never usefully question the narrative.

45:59.370 --> 46:01.631
That's also why they didn't give you the questions.

46:04.192 --> 46:19.419
Because they know that those questions are gonna continue to change as the script moves forward into the, you know, COVID shots are bad, don't talk about 2020 schtick that they're gonna do from pretty much this point on, the end of 21 on.

46:22.659 --> 46:34.504
Because in 2020 and 2021, Americans were murdered using supplementary oxygen, a lack of antibiotics, opioid epidemic, and countless other ways.

46:36.886 --> 46:44.269
And that's why so many foreigners are in front of us because they're not obliged to know what happened in America.

46:44.309 --> 46:46.910
They don't give a shit what happened in America.

46:47.330 --> 46:50.912
Do you think this four continent surfer cares what happened in America?

46:52.076 --> 46:55.639
Do you think that guy that lives in Cyprus cares about what happened in America?

46:55.679 --> 47:01.564
Do you think that this French, this French asshole thinks what happened in America matters to him?

47:01.584 --> 47:07.369
Each of us.

47:07.689 --> 47:09.771
And I completely agree with Mike.

47:09.911 --> 47:13.034
I think everybody wants to know the answers to these questions.

47:13.514 --> 47:17.157
And we're experts in whatever capacity we have.

47:17.338 --> 47:18.358
We're experts.

47:19.284 --> 47:21.306
And we want to know the answers to the questions.

47:21.346 --> 47:23.728
Well, why don't you list the questions and tell us the answers?

47:23.748 --> 47:34.298
You got to wait for the doctors so that you can make a really big argument and, and, and debate within a limited spectrum so that all of us feel like we should just wait for you to figure it out.

47:35.959 --> 47:41.364
So yeah, we're going to be here next week if anyone wants to talk.

47:43.257 --> 47:51.250
All right, well, what I'll do is I'll package this and publish it out through WWDNYK and make it available for every one of you to spread it out through your own channels.

47:51.971 --> 47:53.855
So this was a

47:54.548 --> 48:01.130
The bad news is we didn't make any progress in having the rational dialogue and debate that we all know is so important to happen.

48:01.510 --> 48:06.131
The good news is I can go help race in the kitchen with our turkey stew that we make.

48:06.752 --> 48:08.652
And happy holidays, everyone.

48:08.892 --> 48:21.916
Remember, we watched a video from 2017 where Mary Holland and this guy and a few other people were on stage saying, you know, if I could change anything about the vaccine debate, I would just make sure that everybody on both sides is nice to each other.

48:27.819 --> 48:30.723
Some real awful stuff happening here, ladies and gentlemen.

48:31.564 --> 48:41.518
If you want to believe that Steve Kirsch, the proud information spreader who said on Stu Peters that RFK would have safe vaccines in five years, if you want to believe he's a patriot, you go ahead.

48:42.654 --> 48:58.881
even though he's the largest private donor to the DNC before the pandemic, even though he was on Dark Horse with Malone talking about how if we could just give everybody ivermectin and fluvoxamine for 60 days, the pandemic would be over, even if he pushed early treatment trials that accepted the existence of the pandemic.

49:00.962 --> 49:09.046
You want to believe that a former retired Pfizer executive was telling us about natural immunity to save our kids instead of make us accept the novel virus?

49:09.066 --> 49:09.446
Go ahead.

49:10.339 --> 49:25.337
You want to believe that him writing a substack with my name, JJ, and no links, and Sasha Latapova in the chat is just accidental after he was on like three streams promoting her and wrote substacks promoting Sasha Latapova, the mother of Soph?

49:27.319 --> 49:30.303
Then I guess you have to believe that Mike Eden doesn't care about America.

49:31.598 --> 49:33.259
which I guess isn't very hard to believe.

49:33.399 --> 49:43.447
There's quite a few Englishmen in this little theater that don't care about America, starting with Andrew Wakefield and his co-author, Peter Daszak.

49:44.567 --> 49:51.272
You want to believe that this Canadian, Canadian-Israeli, wherever she is, I got to move over here, and then I got to go like this.

49:51.833 --> 49:58.377
This Canadian-Israeli, not MD, who everybody says has five post-secondary degrees.

50:02.964 --> 50:08.267
You want to believe that she's a good guy even though that her post-secondary degrees are mostly NATO funded?

50:08.287 --> 50:09.227
You want to believe that?

50:09.707 --> 50:12.789
Even though she toured the world with Robert Malone for six years?

50:12.809 --> 50:14.330
You want to believe that?

50:15.270 --> 50:18.692
Even though she didn't speak out against Israel being used as a laboratory?

50:18.732 --> 50:21.853
You want to... She has been consistently EpiGirl.

50:25.535 --> 50:26.796
That's what you have to accept.

50:27.844 --> 50:36.167
That none of these people, these geniuses, after five years could figure out that not using antibiotics for pneumonia might explain some of this shit right here.

50:37.628 --> 50:44.090
Using pure oxygen when people came into the hospital, you know, or ventilators to stop spread might explain a few of these things here.

50:45.130 --> 50:49.292
That letting opioids run wild might explain a little bit of this shit right here.

50:50.089 --> 50:53.410
that do not resuscitate orders would lower life expectancy too.

50:53.870 --> 50:57.371
Death certificates being faked for money might cause a little bit of this to happen.

50:57.411 --> 51:04.894
And PCR not being a useful diagnostic tool, well, that's just a convenient pain in the ass that we haven't addressed in six years now, isn't it?

51:06.175 --> 51:16.826
The genius Steve Kirsch, the genius five degree having Jessica Rose and the retired pharma exec super genius, Mike Eden, couldn't figure any of this out.

51:17.627 --> 51:27.977
That murder and lies might be used to create the illusion of a pandemic, especially if there was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality predicted by the population pyramid.

51:30.219 --> 51:37.102
And after five years of trying to explain to these people that there might be a better explanation for what happened, they have consistently ignored me.

51:37.702 --> 51:45.306
After trying to explain it to our Health and Human Services Secretary at the end of writing this book, these people have continued to ignore me.

51:45.406 --> 51:51.969
After trying to explain it to my friend, Jay Bhattacharya, the now head of NIH, these people have continued to ignore me.

51:52.591 --> 52:01.754
There is a logical explanation for what happened during this national security operation to convince our kids of this mythology, and it's murder and lies.

52:04.355 --> 52:18.579
If you go on Matt Crawford and you just Google him, or in this case, DuckDuckGoHim, you will find the last video that I did with him, which is indeed a video with Mark Kulak, with George Webb and myself,

52:20.427 --> 52:26.449
The day after this video, he tried to convince me that Mark used a trigger phrase from his military rape camp.

52:26.489 --> 52:30.751
And that's why I should know that Mark Kulak is definitely military intelligence.

52:30.791 --> 52:32.792
And I guess he could be, he could be my handler.

52:34.622 --> 52:51.806
And maybe Mark Kulak's story about 9-11 really being about bioterror, and Mark Kulak's story about the anthrax thing, you know, and the anthrax vaccine, and all of this stuff with the Human Genome Project being really 9-11 also, and all of his ideas about Lederberg.

52:51.846 --> 52:54.527
I guess they could all just be things to lead me astray.

52:54.547 --> 52:58.307
I guess so I wouldn't talk about the lab leak or something like that.

52:59.148 --> 53:00.488
But Matt Crawford's been busy.

53:01.658 --> 53:04.360
Sasha Latupova has been on like three or four times.

53:04.380 --> 53:09.904
I mean, he's had John Cullen on, one of the greatest heroes of the pandemic.

53:10.285 --> 53:18.191
And of course he's had George Webb on, and this one's really funny because it's labeled George Webb domain question asker.

53:18.931 --> 53:20.152
That's actually what it says.

53:20.553 --> 53:23.475
George Webb domain question asker.

53:25.222 --> 53:26.383
I can't make this stuff up.

53:26.423 --> 53:28.184
He's had Rixey and McCairn on.

53:28.685 --> 53:32.628
This guy met Robert Malone on a beach in 2020.

53:32.728 --> 53:35.830
These people were put in place to control this narrative.

53:36.330 --> 53:44.376
And I am just so very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very sad that this is what I got to do.

53:45.998 --> 53:47.239
I want to teach biology.

53:47.279 --> 53:48.279
I want to write this book.

53:48.319 --> 53:50.961
But every day I get up and I have to do this too.

53:51.482 --> 53:52.483
The book is being written.

53:53.223 --> 53:55.246
The figures are being sketched.

53:56.548 --> 53:59.172
The lesson plans are being organized.

53:59.993 --> 54:02.417
The vocabulary and the glossary is being written.

54:03.648 --> 54:04.928
It's just a question of time.

54:05.108 --> 54:24.533
And in the meantime, this news program is going to keep going on because it has been decades now since the National Security Priority, the Human Genome Project, has basically taken over in the background and become the central pivoting point of the entire military-industrial complex of America.

54:26.502 --> 54:28.844
And there are all kinds of little examples of it.

54:28.944 --> 54:33.448
This one being one of the best one, former FLCCC, now the IMA.

54:33.508 --> 54:40.575
The FLCCC told people in 2020 to go to the hospital if your pulse ox was lower than 96.

54:41.796 --> 54:48.822
And if you went to the hospital, you'd get supplementary oxygen, which for a certain percentage of unhealthy people would definitely cause pneumonia.

54:48.842 --> 54:50.644
And if you didn't treat it with antibiotics,

54:54.232 --> 55:09.138
I guess the COVID deaths are going to go up and look at Andrew Wakefield, still the star of the show, the intelligence agent from England who came here with Pauly Tommy to recycle the shtick that they did for six million votes in the early 2000s.

55:09.198 --> 55:10.418
This is one big show.

55:11.018 --> 55:13.339
He might not know how badly he's being used.

55:13.379 --> 55:20.002
That might be how, why he looks so bad because he didn't think it was going to get this ugly, but it's going to get uglier.

55:20.967 --> 55:34.643
And if you want to have a little tiny, eensy weensy bit of hope, we can watch this video and just try to imagine that maybe, maybe, Mary Talley Bowden is a good person.

55:35.345 --> 55:37.848
who could learn the biology that we have to teach.

55:38.589 --> 55:50.784
Maybe Dr. Jack Krause is a good person and could learn the biology that we have to teach about virology and change their mind about the assumptions that they make about the molecular world that we live in.

55:51.601 --> 55:52.682
Let's just see, I don't know.

55:52.702 --> 55:58.567
What's going on behind the scenes with, is anybody talking about the COVID shots behind the scenes at all?

55:58.627 --> 56:02.169
I can tell you exactly what's happening behind the scenes.

56:02.610 --> 56:04.331
Is anyone talking about the shots?

56:04.391 --> 56:06.213
She's referring to the COVID shots.

56:06.293 --> 56:08.014
COVID shots are bad, don't talk about 2020.

56:08.194 --> 56:16.421
She's not talking about the whole vaccine schedule, and she's not talking about intramuscular injection in general, which we've been talking about for more than two years.

56:17.984 --> 56:24.512
little ideology, and it is full on discussions of the childhood chronic disease crisis and the fact that kids are getting so sick.

56:24.532 --> 56:26.113
But nothing about those shots.

56:26.173 --> 56:29.157
I think there's- No, because he loves Operation Warp Speed, right?

56:29.417 --> 56:35.084
Trump and all of the advisors and everybody that he has put in positions of power.

56:36.641 --> 56:46.870
Other than, you know, Jay Bhattacharya has said on X that he agrees that the shot should be pulled off the market because he signed the Hope Accord, although the Hope Accord does not have it on their website.

56:47.611 --> 56:50.894
But other than that, everybody, you know, look at the Surgeon General pick.

56:50.934 --> 56:53.276
I mean, that's a nightmare.

56:53.316 --> 56:55.638
And Dr. Oz is a complete nightmare.

56:55.658 --> 56:58.921
Actually, I'll just be the first one to say this.

56:59.542 --> 57:00.523
I love the Dr. Oz pick.

57:00.843 --> 57:01.405
Oh, you do?

57:01.565 --> 57:06.877
Yeah, because centralized medicine, what better way to blow it up than to put a World Economic Forum guy in charge of it?

57:08.841 --> 57:11.423
Um, I, I, I, I think, I think Doug.

57:11.483 --> 57:17.126
So he's not worried about, about a director of national intelligence being a world economic forum puppet.

57:17.186 --> 57:18.647
Like that's so strange.

57:18.787 --> 57:19.187
I don't know.

57:19.247 --> 57:19.567
Whatever.

57:19.587 --> 57:20.848
I was just going to be extraordinary.

57:21.188 --> 57:21.909
Um, you do.

57:21.989 --> 57:32.775
And I think you think it's possible that a lot of these people, these high level people in politics and Bobby included from what you alluded to with your comment for your first conversation with Bobby and Rick, that they aren't educated on any of this stuff.

57:32.935 --> 57:34.736
and if they aren't educated on any of this stuff, for example.

57:34.756 --> 57:35.736
There's no excuse at this point.

57:35.756 --> 57:38.397
This is the biggest public health event in our lifetime.

57:38.417 --> 57:41.919
You should be up to speed, especially if you're gonna have power and a microphone.

57:41.959 --> 57:42.299
Totally.

57:42.319 --> 57:43.119
You have to be.

57:43.259 --> 57:44.960
But she's not up to speed, right?

57:44.980 --> 57:51.623
Because she's not aware of the murder and how it happened, or at least she pretends that she's not.

57:51.683 --> 58:01.087
She's not aware that advocating for ivermectin as being good medicine in response to a non-existent threat was helping them.

58:01.963 --> 58:03.144
She doesn't understand.

58:03.744 --> 58:18.914
And she was a respiratory physiologist, so it's very strange to me that she doesn't understand that a little tweak to protocols about pneumonia, you know, like a tweak where you say pneumonia can be viral and antibiotics don't work on viral things.

58:19.895 --> 58:26.960
could result in the murder of thousands of Americans and that could be misconstrued as something else.

58:27.000 --> 58:42.011
She doesn't seem to be aware of that yet and that makes her very vulnerable to these people when they have these debates around her and this illusion of consensus is maintained by the limited spectrum of debate that they reinforce with their questions.

58:42.651 --> 58:53.599
And that may be why she's never realized that supplementary oxygen might be to blame, that the opioid crisis might've been twisted into a loss in life expectancy that had nothing to do with the virus.

58:54.059 --> 59:07.268
Maybe she's just not aware that in order to get people to accept transfection, the national security priority state was definitely willing to murder a few people and lie about it.

59:08.389 --> 59:12.132
How else do you explain Pierre Cory and Kyle Seidel?

59:13.624 --> 59:15.844
Mary Talley Bowden was on my show.

59:15.904 --> 59:17.785
Mary, you can be on my show again.

59:17.805 --> 59:21.845
And we can discuss all of this in a friendly manner.

59:22.526 --> 59:23.766
I can break it down for you.

59:24.066 --> 59:25.606
Why virology is a hoax.

59:26.366 --> 59:37.848
Why immunology is probably being grossly overplayed in terms of its role for external pathogens as opposed to the interface system between us and our symbiotic partners.

59:39.829 --> 59:42.109
I would so love to talk to Mary again.

59:44.264 --> 59:46.507
You missed something while we were joking here.

59:46.867 --> 59:50.691
I actually made a joke about Dr. Oz, and he actually thought it was a good pick.

59:50.912 --> 59:51.592
And guess what?

59:51.632 --> 59:54.175
That fits with my concerns.

59:56.906 --> 01:00:01.730
I think that the picks Bobby made are... I think that... So that Bobby made these picks, not Trump?

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:02.511
No, no, no.

01:00:03.031 --> 01:00:11.438
I think the picks President Trump made... Yeah, I think the picks President Trump made are very strong, and I think... This is just my opinion.

01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:15.802
I think we have people that are aligned with the vision that Bobby and President Trump painted during the campaign.

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:17.363
And that's the reason why I said before...

01:00:17.543 --> 01:00:31.735
Yes, this is the podcast where Kevin McKernan lied for about 10 minutes straight about how that book was written, who helped write the book, about the diffuse proposal, about virology, about the PCR, and about sequencing and the evolution of it.

01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:35.278
Absolutely, positively, exactly the same podcast.

01:00:35.318 --> 01:00:42.183
And so you gotta wonder, are these people just unwitting participants in this same bullshit narrative?

01:00:42.303 --> 01:00:42.544
Is he?

01:00:43.703 --> 01:00:46.207
I don't think Mary Talley Bowden is scripted.

01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:56.303
I think Mary Talley Bowden has, in her own way, has been co-opted.

01:00:56.544 --> 01:00:58.166
And because of the nature of her

01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:06.967
her professional background, it may be that she was easier to co-opt on the lab leak circulating virus idea.

01:01:07.027 --> 01:01:12.849
She's a professional who her whole professional career has been based on the acceptance of that model of disease.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:22.773
And so it would be pretty hard, or rather, it would be pretty easy to keep her on that model as long as she's surrounded by people like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland.

01:01:23.653 --> 01:01:36.386
and Kelly Victory and all these other people that also don't question the existence of the novel virus, because we had something strange too, then she's not going to get close to waking up.

01:01:38.749 --> 01:01:40.651
Now, that's why I think I need to talk to her again.

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:45.892
that I'm no longer on Bobby's train.

01:01:46.313 --> 01:01:47.213
I'm kind of out.

01:01:47.373 --> 01:01:50.676
Because what Mary's saying here, I had a lot of hope.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:58.883
And I will tell you that when Bobby got lawfared, Nicole got lawfared, if you go back and listen to the Rick Rubin podcast,

01:01:59.443 --> 01:02:08.229
Bobby laid his vision out right there about how he's going to do it, because he's an attorney, and I'm going to go sue everybody like I've done before, like we did with Monsanto.

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:10.990
And the funny thing is, I said to Bobby, it's not going to work.

01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:13.772
And I said, I think you need to listen to what Bukele did.

01:02:14.112 --> 01:02:19.456
We need to put a constitutional amendment in it and take all the criminals out of the mix to begin with.

01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:22.357
And he said, I think that's very dangerous.

01:02:22.478 --> 01:02:25.720
Anytime anybody says that we need a constitutional amendment,

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:31.928
They are opening a document to alteration that doesn't need to be altered.

01:02:32.228 --> 01:02:37.236
What we need to do is strike the PREP Act because it's unconstitutional.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:41.882
And the reason why the PREP Act is unconstitutional is because

01:02:43.168 --> 01:02:51.855
The government cannot be allowed to suspend fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny.

01:02:52.636 --> 01:03:02.004
And the PREP Act allows an unelected official in the government to suspend many fundamental rights while held to the rational basis test alone.

01:03:03.288 --> 01:03:11.876
Now, if you're not a law student or a lawyer, you might not know what I just said, but I assure you every lawyer worth their salt knows what I just said.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:16.520
And so if you heard that clip and you scratch your head a little bit,

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.502
then that's the only reason why I would say that this guy might be given a script.

01:03:21.662 --> 01:03:29.987
If you just advocate for a constitutional amendment, and in my humble opinion, you already are basically advocating for the end of America.

01:03:30.027 --> 01:03:35.810
Because once the Constitution is open to amendment, it doesn't have to be the one that he's proposing.

01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:42.594
It doesn't have to be the one that all the people that voted to open the Constitution were proposing.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:47.652
Once the Constitution is open for amendment, anything can be added.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:53.514
So I'm very skeptical of this guy when he says that.

01:03:53.574 --> 01:03:57.095
I'm very skeptical of him when he says that Mary's Monkey is a real book.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:12.641
Even if a lot of the other things he says are interesting, a lot of the neuroscience he talks about is interesting, it doesn't mean that Mary's Monkey is real, and it doesn't mean that we need to open the Constitution when we could just restore liability and get rid of the PrEP Act.

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:21.749
Again, another one of these things that Aaron Seery and Mary Holland and all these other lawyers don't seem to be capable of enunciating.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:27.717
Jack, that's great, but not even DeSantis could pass that kind of law in Florida.

01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:34.415
But then, well, I will say in Tennessee, they're about to propose a bill to ban the sale and distribution of all MRNA.

01:04:34.655 --> 01:04:35.776
Tennessee may be the first.

01:04:35.816 --> 01:04:45.779
Well, I just got a call from one of the people, a governor who this may be a very interesting point to bring up, but understand what I'm trying to say to you here.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:55.343
If Callie means and, and, and Mr. Krause here are working together,

01:04:56.849 --> 01:05:01.271
then Danny Jones and Mary Talley Bowden don't stand a chance.

01:05:02.092 --> 01:05:06.054
He's obviously skeptical of Casey and very attacking of Casey.

01:05:06.214 --> 01:05:08.775
And if that's real, that's great.

01:05:08.815 --> 01:05:16.219
But if it's fake, it will be the most magnificent, magnificent enchantment of Mary Bowden.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.580
And she will never be able to see through it.

01:05:20.353 --> 01:05:22.073
And that's how they do it.

01:05:22.693 --> 01:05:26.294
I absolutely assure you that's exactly how this is done.

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.415
That's exactly what you see happening right here.

01:05:28.975 --> 01:05:40.577
I would bet dollars to donuts that those two are working together to make sure Mary Talley Bowden never finds me and never realizes intramuscular injection is just plain not medicine.

01:05:42.717 --> 01:05:44.278
I'm telling you folks, we're there.

01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:45.258
We're right there.

01:05:45.318 --> 01:05:46.358
This is how it breaks.

01:05:47.759 --> 01:05:54.361
especially with him, to show you just how what happened in Trump's last term could actually be helpful.

01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:56.161
And this may be really big for you in Texas.

01:05:57.241 --> 01:06:00.822
So you know that Trump took a lot of shit in his first term about abortion.

01:06:01.142 --> 01:06:07.304
And remember, since abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution, the states have to go by the 10th Amendment.

01:06:08.137 --> 01:06:08.838
Well, guess what?

01:06:09.538 --> 01:06:11.740
Medical freedom is also not mentioned in the Constitution.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.121
That means it would go the same route.

01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:14.041
So you know what that means?

01:06:14.282 --> 01:06:21.027
Uncle Jack could sit down and talk to a governor if a governor is willing to put my constitutional amendment in the state constitution.

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:24.371
We got an issue, and it's a good issue.

01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:25.911
Do I think that's the way to go?

01:06:25.951 --> 01:06:29.812
Because then you don't need to deal with Trump, and you don't need to deal with Bobby Kennedy.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:39.014
So we get a governor like, say, Ryan Cole in Idaho, and then he puts an amendment in the Idaho Constitution, and now we have a constitutional crisis?

01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:40.795
Is that what he's proposing here?

01:06:42.325 --> 01:06:44.747
In other words, you go straight... I think it's going to be state by state.

01:06:44.927 --> 01:06:59.458
Well, you have to realize, the states that I think could be very, very interesting here is Trump had a very contentious relationship with his previous primary guy, our governor, you know, DeSantis.

01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:07.885
And we know why that relationship was destroyed, because somebody who used to work at Mercury, which was a PR firm, that's Susie Watts.

01:07:08.185 --> 01:07:08.846
Who I used to work with.

01:07:09.585 --> 01:07:13.686
Well, Susie worked there as well, and this was not about you.

01:07:13.726 --> 01:07:14.806
This is more about her.

01:07:14.926 --> 01:07:16.687
But you're missing the conspiracy tie.

01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:19.347
Yeah, but you're not that important, my friend.

01:07:19.487 --> 01:07:19.867
I know.

01:07:20.608 --> 01:07:22.368
You're not that important, my friend.

01:07:22.408 --> 01:07:23.388
Do you see the theater?

01:07:24.989 --> 01:07:29.149
He's being an absolute over-the-top dick, and that's a sign.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.990
That's a sign that this is a theater, because why would he tolerate it?

01:07:34.131 --> 01:07:35.591
Why would he tolerate that?

01:07:37.145 --> 01:07:50.817
He tolerates it for the same reason, listen very carefully, he tolerates it for the same reason that Mark Bailey tolerated Kevin McCairn in late 2022, because it's a theater.

01:07:51.858 --> 01:07:57.263
And Mary Talley Bowden needs to believe that these two people are antagonists.

01:07:57.964 --> 01:08:03.589
She needs to believe it because they're reinforcing the limited spectrum of debate that she's trapped in.

01:08:05.654 --> 01:08:08.138
It's who I'm curious you're talking about so much.

01:08:08.158 --> 01:08:09.821
You're not that important about this issue.

01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:10.342
I agree.

01:08:10.362 --> 01:08:17.333
The issue is could this be an issue because your governor actually is pretty decent.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.841
Well, decent for the medical freedom.

01:08:20.861 --> 01:08:22.202
You're rolling your eyes.

01:08:22.262 --> 01:08:23.283
Why, why is that?

01:08:23.343 --> 01:08:24.243
Texas is bad.

01:08:24.263 --> 01:08:28.065
I mean, we're, we are, we have the largest medical center in the world.

01:08:29.146 --> 01:08:31.727
We're home of Texas is bad.

01:08:31.927 --> 01:08:34.448
Did you hear that very often in the beginning of the pandemic?

01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:35.209
Cause I never did.

01:08:35.849 --> 01:08:39.931
I certainly learned Texas was bad when I worked with my brother at the end of 2020 before he disowned me.

01:08:42.611 --> 01:08:44.212
Like Texas is very bad.

01:08:44.512 --> 01:08:44.752
Wow.

01:08:44.932 --> 01:08:47.113
And Mark, Matt Crawford lives in Texas too.

01:08:47.453 --> 01:08:51.495
The vaccine mandate, Houston Methodist, April, 2021.

01:08:51.615 --> 01:08:52.916
We were the first one to do it.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.137
And I mean- Even before the president mandated it.

01:08:56.597 --> 01:08:56.937
Yeah.

01:08:57.297 --> 01:08:57.598
Yeah.

01:08:58.038 --> 01:09:00.279
Four months before Biden.

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:04.100
So essentially her problem was that she didn't want to take the shot, right?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:04.641
That was it.

01:09:04.721 --> 01:09:06.101
So COVID shot bad.

01:09:06.161 --> 01:09:06.802
Don't talk about 2020.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.220
and did it.

01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:12.763
And, you know, we, yeah, I didn't see what they did to me.

01:09:12.863 --> 01:09:13.083
Right.

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:14.604
I was nothing to them.

01:09:14.664 --> 01:09:18.247
I mean, I'm a solo practitioner, a pretty small practice.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.068
And they like, you know, they.

01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:30.195
She's got a magnificent social profile now, though, a magnificent profile on social media that she could use to spread the truth if she knew what it was.

01:09:31.636 --> 01:09:32.637
They squashed me.

01:09:32.977 --> 01:09:33.598
They tried to.

01:09:33.618 --> 01:09:33.998
And, um,

01:09:35.996 --> 01:09:40.479
You know, Abbott, he was always sort of a step behind DeSantis during the pandemic.

01:09:41.079 --> 01:09:47.963
I mean, granted, he was better than somebody in Washington State, but he's always been a little bit cautious in medical freedom.

01:09:48.844 --> 01:10:00.991
Honestly, Mary comes off to me as a very sharp woman, and that's part of the reason why I think I'm dead on balls accurate when I say this whole podcast was to put Casey and Dr. Krause in front of her and to bamboozle her.

01:10:02.054 --> 01:10:05.976
and also to see what she's thinking, make sure that they know what she's thinking and can keep her there.

01:10:06.576 --> 01:10:13.239
And, uh, yeah, I've reached out to him a lot regarding my case with the medical board and haven't heard anything back.

01:10:13.319 --> 01:10:17.040
And I, you know, there's, he has close ties to the medical community.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.581
Um, so.

01:10:22.679 --> 01:10:25.221
You were saying you like Abbott though, and I can't remember.

01:10:25.381 --> 01:10:31.484
The reason I'm hedging my bets, I can't say everything, but there's states around Texas.

01:10:31.845 --> 01:10:32.285
Oh, sorry.

01:10:32.425 --> 01:10:32.745
Cruz.

01:10:32.845 --> 01:10:33.145
Okay.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.646
And Jack Cruz.

01:10:34.706 --> 01:10:38.088
Texas knows about these talks.

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:39.489
Oklahoma is progressing well.

01:10:39.529 --> 01:10:42.271
I'm just going to tell you, I think I'm a little bit probably more

01:10:43.351 --> 01:11:01.551
optimistic on state than I am federal yes I agree and the point that I'd make to you since you I do like that but it also encourages us to surrender control of the federal government which I think is kind of a slippery slope um and ugly when I are Floridians you know I'm congressional district one and you're down here

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:12.499
Um, very few people know that Matt gets is someone who represents me and I'm the reason why Matt gets is now representing Ivermectin exclusively on rumble.

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:14.020
How bullshit is that?

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:14.780
Wow.

01:11:15.261 --> 01:11:21.805
He kept going down to El Salvador because I kept writing him letters saying you need to come down and look at what plan Bukele is.

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:29.330
And you know that I, I feel very strongly about the Santas and I feel very strongly about the Florida surgeon general.

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.332
That is the guy that should have got the job.

01:11:33.072 --> 01:11:53.868
because if that guy that guy was part of the white coat movement that guy is not no no that guy again if that's who he's advocating for that it's just the same team it's all the same team they were on stage together I gets the job the jabs are over because they're basically over here and you're a Floridian

01:11:54.708 --> 01:11:57.189
I'm a Floridian when I'm in the States.

01:11:57.429 --> 01:12:03.592
And all of them were on Real ID at the beginning of 2020 because Florida already had Real ID at 2020.

01:12:04.172 --> 01:12:10.295
So everybody moved to Florida, went on their digital ID without even knowing it just because they moved to Florida because social media told them to.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.342
That is the kind of leadership that we need to see at the federal level, not the state.

01:12:16.402 --> 01:12:25.886
And the fact that we haven't got those picks in and we hear what Callie's saying as being an insider there that- No, I'm just saying Trump made some good choices.

01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:26.767
Can I finish my point?

01:12:26.787 --> 01:12:26.867
Yeah.

01:12:27.367 --> 01:12:30.248
And we are disagreeing with that.

01:12:30.409 --> 01:12:32.850
Well, you'd agree with Jay.

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.951
Jay is the only one right now.

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.898
Um, Jay Bhattacharya, you would agree with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:12:39.938 --> 01:12:41.642
That's just, there you see it.

01:12:41.782 --> 01:12:42.684
It's remarkable.

01:12:44.047 --> 01:12:46.272
Mary Talley Bowden's not going to question him then.

01:12:48.089 --> 01:13:10.562
Mary is trying to decide between these two people, just like I was forced to decide between Brett Weinstein and Matt Crawford in the Signal Chat, just like I was supposed to decide between Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan in the Steve Kerr Steering Committee, just like I was supposed to decide between Bobby Kennedy and, I guess, I don't know, Robert Malone in the NCHD.

01:13:13.344 --> 01:13:17.306
It's all one malevolent show, and I think Mary Talley Bowden is a victim of it.

01:13:17.813 --> 01:13:19.755
that I actually think is pretty good.

01:13:20.075 --> 01:13:28.343
But the point that I'll make is that he's actually confirming for me what you're and I's feeling is that it's not going well on the federal.

01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:33.908
So we may need to start paying more attention to the state side than not.

01:13:33.928 --> 01:13:37.231
And I think that that's where you and I are in a pretty good situation.

01:13:37.691 --> 01:13:39.453
Can I add on to that constructively?

01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:44.717
So he plays his role really well.

01:13:44.737 --> 01:13:45.238
I totally agree.

01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:52.004
And, you know, I think he's a great leader and should be having a national voice.

01:13:52.064 --> 01:13:53.465
And that's my opinion.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:59.570
So on the picks, I mean, I agree with your frustration.

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:01.111
I mean, like, like this is,

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:04.407
I mean, I think we're in a big opportunity federally.

01:14:04.467 --> 01:14:07.630
I think we need to be doing aggressive state actions.

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:09.811
I think people should be listening to you, Jack.

01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:12.733
I mean, like, on your ideas and on this data.

01:14:12.773 --> 01:14:16.115
I mean, you might not believe, but I truly believe that.

01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:17.917
Just so you know, they are listening to me.

01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:18.457
Good, good.

01:14:18.557 --> 01:14:22.440
Everybody in Washington DC reads my tweets, just so you know that.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.160
They do.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:23.881
OK, good.

01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:25.922
Because I have confirmation of that.

01:14:25.942 --> 01:14:27.103
But realize something else.

01:14:27.923 --> 01:14:31.085
I'm the guy sitting at the table that wrote a constitutional amendment.

01:14:31.986 --> 01:14:53.763
jack jack that's like that's how i wrote a constitutional amendment hold on let me get my pen come on that is so sad that's like christine massey saying she has foyer records come on actually in their hands and they don't want to do something with my like in the united states they don't want to open the constitution

01:14:54.103 --> 01:14:58.144
I wrote a constitutional amendment, but none of these people will do anything about it.

01:14:58.524 --> 01:15:11.527
It's really exactly like Dr. Jack going in front of the people of Pittsburgh and saying that I warned all these manufacturers about the vaccine, and it had these funny epitopes in it, but none of them listened to me.

01:15:12.127 --> 01:15:20.629
He just said, as an American citizen, that he wrote a constitutional amendment, and these people won't do anything with it.

01:15:25.006 --> 01:15:27.047
I don't know if that's more appropriate or this.

01:15:29.889 --> 01:15:30.689
Come on.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:34.191
Holy shit is that bad.

01:15:36.473 --> 01:15:42.676
My little goal in life is to help get radical ideas and transform ideas into our healthcare system.

01:15:43.216 --> 01:15:48.580
My goal in life is to get transformative ideas into our healthcare system?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.760
Stop lying!

01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:50.761
Stop!

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.422
Wow.

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:55.126
I mean, this is just gross.

01:15:55.948 --> 01:15:58.453
I tell you the people that you think are going to help.

01:15:58.814 --> 01:15:59.576
They're not helping.

01:16:00.484 --> 01:16:03.866
So I think, Jack, I'm super cynical about DC.

01:16:04.347 --> 01:16:05.107
I don't think you are.

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:08.830
I think you're actually, I think you're still looking for that job.

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.892
So we can get into my story on that.

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:13.112
You might be right.

01:16:13.132 --> 01:16:17.655
I mean, we all have psychological hangups that we are working a lifetime to get over.

01:16:17.956 --> 01:16:22.839
And I've explained kind of the continuing reflect, you know, plot that's along the way.

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:23.679
I mean, sure.

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.481
Like everyone has their wounded child.

01:16:25.861 --> 01:16:27.442
I'm sure you do and are working on that too.

01:16:27.822 --> 01:16:30.184
What are you talking about?

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:31.885
We are all grownups.

01:16:33.126 --> 01:16:34.887
We all got our cross to bear.

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:36.849
Most of us don't bitch about it.

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:39.711
It's remarkable.

01:16:40.952 --> 01:16:42.052
It is remarkable.

01:16:42.092 --> 01:16:44.514
We all have that recovering child inside of us.

01:16:44.574 --> 01:16:47.376
I know Matt Crawford has a recovering child inside of him.

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:49.578
What a crock of horse shit.

01:16:50.623 --> 01:16:54.025
I mean, like, no, just, I mean, everyone's got their traumas.

01:16:55.846 --> 01:17:05.413
I would say that everything did change when I, you know, decided to focus on this issue and KC and me to put our hearts out.

01:17:05.673 --> 01:17:13.958
And, you know, everyone is the hero in their own head and has pure intentions probably, but we are trying to spread a message of light out there.

01:17:13.978 --> 01:17:15.660
A message of light.

01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:19.038
We are trying to spread a message of light.

01:17:19.078 --> 01:17:20.999
I guess everyone is a hero in their minds.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:21.460
Nope.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:22.440
Not me.

01:17:23.641 --> 01:17:24.302
I'm not a hero.

01:17:24.822 --> 01:17:25.403
I'm a dad.

01:17:25.943 --> 01:17:26.824
I'm a photographer.

01:17:26.844 --> 01:17:30.807
I'm a kite flyer who can't fly kites because Pittsburgh has too many hills.

01:17:32.528 --> 01:17:33.729
I'm a dog enthusiast.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.211
I love to play basketball.

01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:46.167
And I have tried to join what I thought was a real anti-vax movement and it turned out to be a fake anti-vax movement.

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:47.909
And I'm unhappy about it.

01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:57.335
I'm unhappy about it because I think the future of my country and the future for my children is being endangered because of this fake anti-vax movement.

01:17:57.375 --> 01:18:05.101
And I think these guys are part of the fake anti-vax movement that is the same military industrial complex operation

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:14.722
that the Human Genome Project is, the same operation that 9-11 was, the same operation that the bombs in Japan were.

01:18:14.782 --> 01:18:23.666
It's one continuous operation where the national security priority is to take over the evolution of the species.

01:18:23.746 --> 01:18:26.728
That is his message of light.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.008
Lucifer, light.

01:18:28.429 --> 01:18:29.389
Lucifer, light.

01:18:29.969 --> 01:18:30.970
The message of light.

01:18:31.755 --> 01:18:41.328
there and I think any type of power you might be overstating, but like you, we're trying to push things forward.

01:18:41.588 --> 01:18:43.290
It's not power, Callie.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.456
I just think this is the part of you that comes off so disingenuous.

01:18:48.337 --> 01:18:49.178
You are an expert.

01:18:49.438 --> 01:18:53.400
He's calling somebody and to their face, disingenuous.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.621
This is a theater.

01:18:55.261 --> 01:18:58.423
These two guys are on the same team and they're bamboozling Mary Bowden.

01:18:58.543 --> 01:19:08.429
Mary Talley Bowden, doctor, please email me and come on my stream so I can explain to you how I was used and how you're still being used and we can win.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.372
Expert in legalized lying.

01:19:13.492 --> 01:19:15.093
That's what PR and lobbying is.

01:19:15.133 --> 01:19:15.834
Let me finish.

01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:22.053
Legalized lying is also what a military operation would be allowed to do.

01:19:22.173 --> 01:19:29.475
How a military would use social media against us would be organized, coordinated lying.

01:19:29.615 --> 01:19:32.296
And they would do it on podcasts.

01:19:35.256 --> 01:19:36.937
And that's exactly how they do it.

01:19:37.037 --> 01:19:41.398
And that's the reason why they have three people or four people on a podcast.

01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:42.938
So two of them could be liars.

01:19:43.659 --> 01:19:44.919
Two of them could be dupes.

01:19:45.973 --> 01:19:54.820
And together, they cast an illusion of consensus that cannot be seen through, even by the people that are participating, like Mary.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.381
It's not debatable.

01:19:57.267 --> 01:20:01.291
But you told me that you reformed, and I am taking you at your word.

01:20:02.392 --> 01:20:08.097
You have to realize that propaganda is a tool of the government.

01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:12.161
Obama has weaponized it against us by law.

01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:16.284
Including people like, potentially, Jack.

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.146
For sure, Casey.

01:20:18.426 --> 01:20:19.487
For sure, Callie.

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:21.688
For sure, Robert Malone.

01:20:21.768 --> 01:20:23.089
For sure, Meryl Nass.

01:20:23.129 --> 01:20:24.489
For sure, Mary Holland.

01:20:25.049 --> 01:20:28.530
For sure, those people have gotten Brian Hooker to go along with it.

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.590
That's why they all say autism.

01:20:36.071 --> 01:20:37.191
And he's not saying that.

01:20:38.151 --> 01:20:44.532
He's trying to convince Cali that there's some propaganda that he's not aware of.

01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:47.573
When the whole pandemic

01:20:48.564 --> 01:20:57.306
was propaganda based on murder and lies and an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that all of these people knew was coming.

01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:01.648
Is it possible that Jack doesn't know that?

01:21:01.988 --> 01:21:02.408
I guess.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:05.189
Is it possible that Callie doesn't know that?

01:21:05.349 --> 01:21:05.809
I guess.

01:21:06.389 --> 01:21:08.369
Is it possible that Mary doesn't know that?

01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:10.050
I'm almost certain it is.

01:21:12.588 --> 01:21:23.396
But I think it's much more likely that Jack and Callie understand something of what has happened and know that they are actively trying to make sure that no reasonable progress is made by Mary Talley Bowden here.

01:21:24.897 --> 01:21:27.499
And the pharmaceutical industry can do it on TV.

01:21:27.559 --> 01:21:29.100
That's how we lost our First Amendment.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.621
You know that we talked about it.

01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:32.462
Which you acknowledge, I'm trying to stop.

01:21:32.522 --> 01:21:34.884
But we talked about that on the last podcast.

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:36.745
My point that I'm trying to say

01:21:37.634 --> 01:21:44.498
is if the propaganda doesn't go away on the federal level, we're not going to be successful at all.

01:21:44.578 --> 01:21:45.458
That is the point.

01:21:45.878 --> 01:21:51.882
And the point when you say, well, Jack, I don't know about this and that, you have to realize, do you understand?

01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:59.626
You know, I don't want to be a dick with you and throw the gauntlet down about ignorance and fraud, but when I say to you,

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:04.088
clearly that the propaganda arm here is a big issue.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:09.712
And the fact that the people you used to work with, that's their... Jack, that's all I'm calling out, Jack.

01:22:10.352 --> 01:22:12.174
But what is the propaganda about?

01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:17.197
What is the worst or worst aspects of the propaganda?

01:22:17.297 --> 01:22:21.900
What are the, in other words, what's the answer to the question, so what?

01:22:23.061 --> 01:22:24.862
Because that's what these people never do.

01:22:24.902 --> 01:22:27.364
They never answer the question, so what?

01:22:28.174 --> 01:22:30.276
The pandemic wasn't real, so what?

01:22:31.297 --> 01:22:32.638
They never answered that question.

01:22:33.599 --> 01:22:35.600
You're for health freedom, so what?

01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:37.522
They never answered that question.

01:22:38.985 --> 01:22:42.608
There's propaganda in the DC and these are people you used to work with.

01:22:42.668 --> 01:22:43.148
So what?

01:22:43.228 --> 01:22:45.050
What is the consequences of that?

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:55.958
The consequences are that we have an entire world of human beings, of people that believe that intramuscular injection is a useful way to administer medicine when it's not.

01:22:56.359 --> 01:23:04.205
We have an entire world of people that is questioning whether or not transfection might be an advanced form of intramuscular injection.

01:23:05.578 --> 01:23:12.296
And we have a world full of humans that believes that RNA can pandemic and is a threat to us in the future.

01:23:13.834 --> 01:23:21.760
That's the so what question that Krauss is, or Cruz is not answering and, and Cali means is certainly not going to answer.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:40.013
And they working together, keep Mary Talley Bowden away from figuring out that it was just oxygen and lack of antibiotics and ventilators and opioids and suicide and do not resuscitate orders and midazolam and remdesivir and starving people

01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.094
You can go to Scotland and find all about it.

01:23:46.735 --> 01:23:51.925
Scotland was one of the worst places because their population pyramid was one of the most out of balance.

01:23:53.548 --> 01:23:55.773
So they murdered a lot of old people in Scotland.

01:23:58.454 --> 01:24:00.314
Jack, respectfully, you've done a lot.

01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:00.915
You're pushing a lot.

01:24:01.395 --> 01:24:11.297
I don't think anyone's talked more about the need to ban DTC pharma advertising, and how nefarious that is, and how that allows the pharmaceutical industry not only to brainwash people, but also to buy off the news itself.

01:24:11.317 --> 01:24:15.078
But none of the people that Trump are putting on the federal level are doing that.

01:24:15.178 --> 01:24:16.518
That's the point I'm trying to make.

01:24:16.578 --> 01:24:17.938
Jack, it gets into a logic problem.

01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:22.439
So I'm just talking about that, bringing that as much to the national stage as I possibly can in order to subvert it.

01:24:22.459 --> 01:24:23.820
Why wouldn't I just subvert it in the first place?

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.722
Can you answer that?

01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:28.044
No, I guess you missed my point.

01:24:28.844 --> 01:24:30.987
By you saying that to me, you missed the point.

01:24:31.267 --> 01:24:35.792
The point is, you're okay with what they're doing at the federal level, but you're not okay going that way.

01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:37.855
Jack, of course I'm supportive of President Trump, what he's doing.

01:24:37.895 --> 01:24:41.499
He's appointed the best reform-minded group of people for HHS in American history.

01:24:41.539 --> 01:24:43.701
I'm extremely supportive and extremely optimistic.

01:24:43.862 --> 01:24:45.423
I also am extremely

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.965
I think it's the status quo.

01:24:47.985 --> 01:24:50.346
Who's a more reform-minded HHS group of people?

01:24:51.906 --> 01:24:53.947
Marty has pledged not to go to pharma after this.

01:24:54.687 --> 01:24:58.529
I think the past 20 years, every single FDA commissioner has gone straight to pharma.

01:24:58.829 --> 01:25:00.790
These people right now are not going back to pharma.

01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:07.736
I would say if you investigate, and if you're honest, the past 20 years of HHS leadership, this is the most reform-minded.

01:25:07.776 --> 01:25:09.578
You might not think it's reform-minded enough, but it is.

01:25:10.379 --> 01:25:11.900
Let me tell you what it's about, my friend.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:17.366
Ideation without execution leads to the deletion of every good idea.

01:25:17.406 --> 01:25:19.028
And I don't give a shit what they say.

01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:20.889
I want to see the action.

01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:23.390
I 100% agree with that statement.

01:25:23.491 --> 01:25:25.312
What's the action that he wants to see?

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:29.794
I'm very confused about it because if it's that simple, I want to hear what the action is.

01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:33.557
I don't hear any proposals just like I didn't hear any questions in the last video.

01:25:34.137 --> 01:25:34.978
It's remarkable.

01:25:35.358 --> 01:25:38.400
We haven't even heard what his fricking constitutional amendment is yet.

01:25:40.488 --> 01:25:43.010
I'm not giving Olive Branch now, and I'm not.

01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:44.311
Jack, I'm not giving them anything.

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:45.552
They don't deserve shit.

01:25:46.012 --> 01:25:46.873
Do you wanna know the truth?

01:25:47.073 --> 01:25:48.314
We have to hold their feet to the fire.

01:25:48.334 --> 01:25:49.555
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:25:49.595 --> 01:25:49.835
What?

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:50.696
We can hold their feet.

01:25:50.716 --> 01:25:51.957
Mary, what is the fire?

01:25:53.058 --> 01:25:54.859
What is holding their feet to the fire?

01:25:54.919 --> 01:25:55.760
What does that mean?

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.082
That they need to get rid of dyes faster?

01:25:58.122 --> 01:26:00.123
That they need to process seed oils faster?

01:26:00.163 --> 01:26:02.505
That they need to announce the cure of autism faster?

01:26:02.966 --> 01:26:04.447
What do you mean by this?

01:26:06.448 --> 01:26:07.910
Because I don't think you really know.

01:26:08.851 --> 01:26:28.611
You're just upset that somehow or another it's not working out the way you thought, or they're not doing anything, or they're not saying anything, or they're not speaking out against the mRNA, which is such a tiny, tiny, tiny speck of dust if you don't realize that the PCR is the stone in your eye.

01:26:29.534 --> 01:26:31.516
The sequencing is the stone in your eye.

01:26:31.936 --> 01:26:34.678
The acceptance of a novel virus is a stone in your eye.

01:26:35.299 --> 01:26:37.220
And so you're not keeping your eyes clean.

01:26:37.661 --> 01:26:39.842
You're not trying to protect your eye from damage.

01:26:40.123 --> 01:26:52.973
There's a great big rock in your eyeball and you're worried about this little piece of dust in the corner of your eye that is, I don't know, Casey means or is, I don't know, mandates or something like that.

01:26:54.474 --> 01:26:58.017
They have created a massive illusion and you're ignoring it.

01:27:00.234 --> 01:27:02.015
feet to the fire, of course.

01:27:03.035 --> 01:27:09.838
But I think the question is, it's a fair question, how do we support Bobby and Trump and this team as much as we possibly can?

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:10.959
Or maybe that's not what you think we should do.

01:27:11.119 --> 01:27:11.339
No.

01:27:11.479 --> 01:27:24.505
We should now remind you, the reason why this is so relevant is because people like Brian Hooker have been supporting Bobby Kennedy for more than a decade with the idea that once he got there, he was going to do something, and he's not doing it.

01:27:27.429 --> 01:27:32.835
Maybe Brian Hooker supported him because he was promised a book and now he's got his green book so I guess he's fine with it.

01:27:32.895 --> 01:27:45.971
But the bottom line is, is that I know from personal experience there are a lot of autism parents that worked for CHD when I was there who definitely had held their mouth, toed the line,

01:27:47.501 --> 01:27:58.768
advocated for the big top tent of health freedom, believing that at some moment there was going to be this big action where Brian Hooker would be brought in front of the Congress by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:58.788 --> 01:28:00.269
and then everybody would learn the truth.

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:02.570
And that didn't happen.

01:28:04.252 --> 01:28:06.053
It didn't happen after the election.

01:28:06.593 --> 01:28:09.355
It didn't happen after we waited two weeks after the election.

01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:11.336
It didn't happen a month after the election.

01:28:14.045 --> 01:28:17.386
In fact, exactly what you should have expected to happen happened.

01:28:17.406 --> 01:28:20.107
The guy who was running for office got office.

01:28:20.607 --> 01:28:24.588
The guy who was supposed to help him get office got office.

01:28:25.069 --> 01:28:37.253
They said that they were gonna do this in a 2008 Skyhorse publishing book where the epilogue says that Bobby Kennedy would run as an independent and help someone else get elected to office.

01:28:37.733 --> 01:28:41.574
Now all that has to happen is that someone who gets elected to office needs to get shot.

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:47.967
And the odd thing is, is that's kind of already supposedly happened.

01:28:49.668 --> 01:28:56.252
Supposedly an hour north of my house, and it was a kid who goes to the same high school where my kid goes.

01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:58.473
Oh, but that's just, that's, you know, whatever.

01:28:58.953 --> 01:28:59.233
It's good.

01:28:59.854 --> 01:29:00.234
It's fine.

01:29:00.634 --> 01:29:01.194
It's no big deal.

01:29:01.254 --> 01:29:01.815
I mean, whatever.

01:29:01.935 --> 01:29:03.376
That's just, it's fine.

01:29:04.696 --> 01:29:05.597
Shouldn't support them at all.

01:29:05.637 --> 01:29:07.138
They need to do the will of the people.

01:29:07.658 --> 01:29:09.479
That's what they need to do.

01:29:09.819 --> 01:29:10.980
What's the will of the people?

01:29:12.335 --> 01:29:14.936
What's the will of the people that are behind CHD?

01:29:14.976 --> 01:29:19.178
What's the will of the people behind Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:29:19.218 --> 01:29:20.199
What's the will of the people?

01:29:20.259 --> 01:29:24.081
Is it rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear?

01:29:24.521 --> 01:29:30.224
Because then I still don't know really what it means that they're supposed to do when you hold their feet to the fire and then they do stuff.

01:29:32.985 --> 01:29:36.787
What an amazingly vapid 17-minute conversation.

01:29:36.967 --> 01:29:37.788
The will of Cali.

01:29:38.908 --> 01:29:39.849
Not the will of Cali.

01:29:39.889 --> 01:29:43.011
Cali wants to be, let's transparency, transparency.

01:29:43.031 --> 01:29:43.751
What do you think we should do?

01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:45.673
I think we should burn it down.

01:29:46.313 --> 01:29:47.094
That's what I think.

01:29:47.974 --> 01:29:49.735
He wants to burn shit down.

01:29:49.775 --> 01:29:51.476
That sounds a lot like Kevin McCarran.

01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:52.397
Burn it all down.

01:29:52.517 --> 01:29:52.817
Wow.

01:29:52.937 --> 01:29:53.418
Interesting.

01:29:54.018 --> 01:29:55.639
Let's burn the whole thing down.

01:29:55.679 --> 01:29:57.681
That sounds pretty anti-American to me.

01:29:57.701 --> 01:29:58.881
Burn it down.

01:30:00.462 --> 01:30:02.584
We could just get rid of the PrEP Act, but

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:05.605
That's not on anybody's radar.

01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:06.245
Isn't that weird?

01:30:06.285 --> 01:30:15.148
The super smart guy who's willing to, to amend the constitution of the United States, but not strike an unconstitutional law.

01:30:19.509 --> 01:30:20.590
Does he look like Bono?

01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:21.950
I don't know if he looks like Bono.

01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:23.491
I can't, Bono must be old then.

01:30:24.607 --> 01:30:25.868
What would you advise to do?

01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:32.772
I would tell Elon and Vivek to close in places down and I'd start with the intelligence community.

01:30:32.872 --> 01:30:33.412
Can we back up?

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:34.433
Hold on, hold on.

01:30:34.633 --> 01:30:37.935
I'd start with... Elon can't close anything.

01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:39.916
That's just a weird thing to say.

01:30:39.996 --> 01:30:42.298
Why not have Donald Trump close that shit?

01:30:43.118 --> 01:30:44.419
What's going on here?

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.061
And there's no way to take this guy seriously.

01:30:47.161 --> 01:30:55.808
This is a performance between Casey and Jack, and it is a performance for the benefit of Mary Talley Bowden.

01:30:55.989 --> 01:30:57.510
I am a thousand percent sure.

01:30:58.571 --> 01:31:03.475
Vivek, everything tied to science, Jack, Jack, because there's nobody worthwhile.

01:31:03.555 --> 01:31:07.878
And can we step, can we step back and actually calmly talk about what you're on?

01:31:07.918 --> 01:31:08.479
Very calm.

01:31:08.499 --> 01:31:08.819
Okay.

01:31:11.526 --> 01:31:13.447
Can we talk about what your 100-day plan would be?

01:31:13.487 --> 01:31:15.509
Constitutional amendment.

01:31:15.969 --> 01:31:17.610
Constitutional amendment.

01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:26.977
What would be your recommendation of how to ... Anybody associated with who goes to Guantanamo Bay, first and foremost.

01:31:27.558 --> 01:31:27.818
Okay.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:28.859
That's it.

01:31:28.959 --> 01:31:30.000
That's the first thing I do.

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:30.380
Okay.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.042
And I know that if Getz was in, that'd happen.

01:31:35.819 --> 01:31:50.985
The guy who's advocating for Ivermectin on Rumble, if he was in, if he was in, the guy who's doing commercials for La Familia Pharma, like seriously, that's what this guy's saying right now.

01:31:53.527 --> 01:31:54.887
That's the first place.

01:31:55.187 --> 01:31:56.968
And then I'd start changing laws.

01:31:57.008 --> 01:31:59.349
The first law I'd change, it's a 1980 law that allows

01:32:02.688 --> 01:32:22.266
scientists paid by taxpayers to benefit from research that should end yeah i think i don't think there's anyone in the country that's talked more about that than me so well i got this ain't gonna happen okay and with the people that trump's put in the second thing that needs to happen is the liability law leads to needs to go by the way

01:32:23.195 --> 01:32:44.885
and here's the the big issue the first what is the liability law which one is it you see what i mean this is bullshit these guys are not talking in useful terms they're not saying useful things and people who listen to this will not leave with any useful information including mary tally bowden 200 days the only thing bobby should focus in on

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:55.466
The only thing is a RICO case against everybody associated with messenger RNA technology, and that includes the Department of Defense.

01:32:55.906 --> 01:32:56.526
How would you do that?

01:32:57.046 --> 01:32:58.808
I just told you how I'd do it.

01:32:58.908 --> 01:33:00.368
No, no, I'm not- Investigate?

01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:02.390
We already have Fauci's emails.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.570
We have Morin's emails.

01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:06.132
We have tons of data.

01:33:06.492 --> 01:33:12.036
So he believes in the lab leak, and that's what makes him part of this show, and if he's

01:33:13.825 --> 01:33:24.971
sophisticated enough to have read enough to figure out that that is not possible, then I don't know what to say because he argues that Mary's Monkey is a real book.

01:33:25.031 --> 01:33:31.534
He argues about a lot of things that somebody as smart as him should have been able to figure out by now.

01:33:31.694 --> 01:33:35.176
I don't know about Dr. Jack, but I'm thinking no.

01:33:36.036 --> 01:33:57.842
you seem to act like the date is not there kevin mckernan literally could go to congress jack kevin mckernan could literally go to congress and lie about it just like he lied about it on the danny jones podcast about a month before this occurred there he is plugging his other teammate their other teammate

01:33:58.735 --> 01:34:02.396
that also helps to keep Mary Talley Bowden in line.

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:05.677
And tell them that he found SV40.

01:34:05.697 --> 01:34:12.019
Anybody associated with the FDA approval process, Guantanamo Bay.

01:34:12.139 --> 01:34:15.120
I'm not suggesting that data is not there.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:19.041
I'm suggesting that we certainly don't fund foundational research on why we're getting sick.

01:34:19.181 --> 01:34:25.746
And that's why he believes that SV40 and Mary's Monkey, and it's all one big bullshit show.

01:34:26.226 --> 01:34:36.013
And there Jack Krause just shot himself in the foot with admitting that he is supporting and following and on the script of Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:34:36.133 --> 01:34:37.054
It's absolutely

01:34:37.975 --> 01:34:39.777
It's absolutely as bad as you think.

01:34:39.837 --> 01:34:41.958
We need to get in touch with Mary Talley Bowden.

01:34:42.379 --> 01:34:45.501
You need to help me put this video in her feed.

01:34:45.661 --> 01:34:46.922
Then you don't solve the problem.

01:34:46.942 --> 01:34:48.704
Data's being covered up.

01:34:48.784 --> 01:34:52.007
And then you don't solve the problem is what you're saying.

01:34:52.087 --> 01:34:55.009
So I think- So you just want to ignore everything that's already out there?

01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.750
No, not at all.

01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:57.691
So you want to kind of do a YouTube?

01:34:58.172 --> 01:35:05.177
Oh, I think as much, Bobby's talked about getting rid of the Pfizer department, just open source and release as much as we possibly have.

01:35:05.538 --> 01:35:06.779
That's a huge part of transparency.

01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:08.860
We need accountability though.

01:35:10.001 --> 01:35:11.201
People need to go to jail.

01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:11.542
Hold on.

01:35:11.562 --> 01:35:15.844
So, so, so, and, and again, my story is.

01:35:16.585 --> 01:35:17.806
We're not interested in your story.

01:35:17.826 --> 01:35:20.267
We're interested in the story of we the people.

01:35:20.327 --> 01:35:22.789
Well, I'm giving my opinion.

01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:27.012
Is that any, like, we all come from different perspectives.

01:35:28.493 --> 01:35:35.698
I am just trying to think just intellectually, like, this is what I like doing is like, how do you channel this spiritual awakening?

01:35:35.798 --> 01:35:37.299
I believe many people in America have.

01:35:37.705 --> 01:35:41.587
Spiritual awakening, this guy is leading a spiritual awakening.

01:35:41.627 --> 01:35:42.968
Wow, kick me in the nuts.

01:35:43.508 --> 01:35:45.790
Oh my God, this is awful.

01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:47.531
And the incentive is being destroyed.

01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:51.813
I need my water filled before we can go.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:56.456
And that's not like me, I'm not controlling, like, you know, I'm the one person.

01:35:56.476 --> 01:35:59.898
She's speaking like a politician and a lobbyist.

01:35:59.938 --> 01:36:00.718
Thank you.

01:36:00.738 --> 01:36:01.879
Not maybe, definitely.

01:36:01.899 --> 01:36:02.639
I'm almost done.

01:36:02.659 --> 01:36:05.421
That's actually what our big problem is with you.

01:36:05.521 --> 01:36:07.202
My story, my story is,

01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:18.613
And this is for you to respond to, is that talking about practicality puts your guys alarm signals up that I'm somehow trying to subvert something.

01:36:18.673 --> 01:36:22.477
It's like, we are at the time now where- Yeah, we actually should feel that way.

01:36:22.717 --> 01:36:27.042
Okay, but there is a question of what should be done in 63 days, right?

01:36:27.082 --> 01:36:27.743
I just told you.

01:36:28.323 --> 01:36:46.858
but the people that we know have committed fraud need to go to guantanamo bay i don't think i don't think suggesting what's the fraud we don't know what the fraud is they're never going to say it ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for being here this has been giga on biological where we fight every day against the bad biology evolution because dna it's really bullshit

01:36:47.859 --> 01:36:56.850
I'm going to get on with the teaching soon, but for right now, the fire is still burning so bright that we've got to keep paying attention to it so nobody misses how obvious it is.

01:36:57.391 --> 01:36:59.453
Please forward this stream to Mary Talley Bowden.

01:36:59.473 --> 01:37:03.759
I would love to talk to Dr. Bowden again about this and see if she can see it from my perspective.

01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:09.301
This has been Gigo and Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:37:09.821 --> 01:37:14.403
Don't forget that these people won't speak about ingestion versus injection, and that's really a pity.

01:37:15.183 --> 01:37:18.945
But we're gonna forget about that for now, because this is really about the Human Genome Project.

01:37:19.005 --> 01:37:23.826
Once you can pull back far enough and see what they've been using social media to accomplish.

01:37:23.867 --> 01:37:27.888
It gets pretty scary, but it also means that we can wake our kids up and get out of this.

01:37:27.968 --> 01:37:29.729
It has always been people.

01:37:30.569 --> 01:37:32.712
people misleading other people.

01:37:32.852 --> 01:37:34.734
And I do think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:34.794 --> 01:37:43.804
is just a victim of his own desires, his own political aspirations, and all the people that are willing to lie to him his whole life.

01:37:43.844 --> 01:37:45.727
This is about all the marbles that's why we have

01:37:46.207 --> 01:37:56.089
a fake anti-vax movement in America that lied about a background that's irreducibly complex, and that's why they could use a non-specific PCR test to use it to convince you that there was something else there.

01:37:56.589 --> 01:38:03.891
RNA cannot pandemic, and make sure you understand that using their tests to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster.

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:05.551
Thank you very much for being here.

01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:08.411
Intramuscular injection is gosh darn dumb.

01:38:09.032 --> 01:38:15.413
I really like you guys a lot, but if you want to say it better, and you want to say it nicer to your family and friends, you can say intramuscular injection is a

01:38:16.033 --> 01:38:19.378
terrible way to deliver something that you think is medicine.

01:38:20.099 --> 01:38:21.942
The population pyramid, learn about that.

01:38:22.342 --> 01:38:28.210
Learn about what transfection and transformation is and learn enough biology to understand that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:28.911
Thanks for being here.

01:38:28.932 --> 01:38:30.334
See you guys again soon.

01:38:45.915 --> 01:38:52.829
Everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.
