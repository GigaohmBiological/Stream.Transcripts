00:32.406 --> 00:32.446
um

01:00.828 --> 01:02.931
Protect yourself at all times.

01:03.372 --> 01:04.173
Follow my instructions.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.434
Keep it clean.

01:05.775 --> 01:06.796
Touch gloves if you wish.

01:07.076 --> 01:08.859
Let's do it.

01:08.879 --> 01:09.680
Sweaty palms.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.462
This is so crazy.

01:12.203 --> 01:13.084
Like goosebumps.

01:13.946 --> 01:15.047
This is so crazy.

01:15.287 --> 01:17.150
I feel so nervous.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.452
Like what in the world, man?

01:54.343 --> 01:55.724
or behind these shots, right?

01:55.744 --> 01:57.805
This technology that has never been used widely.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.126
None of that is over.

02:00.246 --> 02:08.569
And as Sasha Latifa pointed out this morning, you know, these were military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

02:08.809 --> 02:11.470
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

02:11.950 --> 02:16.112
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

02:16.172 --> 02:19.173
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

02:20.573 --> 02:28.238
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

02:28.698 --> 02:30.179
All of that was on a global basis.

02:37.383 --> 02:41.245
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:43.104 --> 02:43.785
And I have lied.

02:43.805 --> 02:44.865
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:44.886 --> 02:46.567
I don't want to lie, you know?

02:46.707 --> 02:47.648
I don't think I'm a liar.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.789
I try not to be a liar.

02:48.809 --> 02:49.689
I don't want to be a liar.

02:50.230 --> 03:00.498
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

03:00.518 --> 03:02.940
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know?

03:02.960 --> 03:04.401
You can sort of feel it in people.

03:06.241 --> 03:06.941
And I have lied.

03:06.961 --> 03:08.002
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.703
I don't want to lie, you know?

03:09.803 --> 03:10.804
I don't think I'm a liar.

03:10.904 --> 03:11.924
I try not to be a liar.

03:11.944 --> 03:12.785
I don't want to be a liar.

03:13.365 --> 03:16.087
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.495
I think truth is good for kids.

03:34.916 --> 03:38.804
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:39.245 --> 03:41.509
We want everybody to feel good.

03:41.790 --> 03:42.952
That's not the way life is.

04:22.932 --> 04:24.134
I don't care how you get there.

04:24.154 --> 04:26.818
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:26.838 --> 04:29.463
The goal is to win.

04:42.731 --> 04:44.732
Holy cow, that timing was perfect.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.734
Every once in a while I get it right.

04:47.815 --> 04:50.497
Ladies and gentlemen, let's stay focused on the biology today.

04:50.537 --> 04:52.858
Let's not take any of their bait on social media.

04:52.878 --> 04:54.139
Let's just juggle it a little bit.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.742
And let's set out to love our neighbors all weekend.

04:58.823 --> 05:09.135
If you're lucky enough to have a Saturday like it seems like I'm about to have a Friday night like I'm about to have Holy cow, is it gonna be easy for me to stay off of social media?

05:09.956 --> 05:11.898
I think I'll be hanging out in my back garden.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.682
I might even drink a brown clear liquid

05:16.703 --> 05:19.246
which may have aged as long as 12 years.

05:19.747 --> 05:23.451
And in fact, I think this is the only non-compliance that matters.

05:23.932 --> 05:30.359
I hope you are able to take a break from this ridiculousness and enjoy a little bit of now as well.

05:32.321 --> 05:46.351
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned, to make sure that virology is never questioned as a science, and to make sure that public health is never questioned as both a reason and an answer.

05:47.372 --> 05:50.314
You can say the same thing about the pandemic illusion.

05:50.874 --> 05:58.300
You can say the same thing about this idea of gain of function, that we can make stuff in our garage that can go around the world.

05:59.500 --> 06:05.204
All of this is an elaborate mythology that still needs to be passed on to our kids.

06:06.205 --> 06:07.706
I gotta push this one away.

06:07.726 --> 06:10.508
I'm not really sure what to do about that.

06:14.062 --> 06:18.105
Mice die in traps that they do not understand.

06:18.205 --> 06:19.986
Somehow I feel like I've got to check this.

06:20.807 --> 06:24.570
I'm getting a voicemail message, so I'm just going to check that really quick.

06:25.850 --> 06:28.432
It could possibly be a neighbor, I guess.

06:28.512 --> 06:31.635
I mean, you know, it's possible that a neighbor could be calling me right now.

06:32.415 --> 06:37.916
I don't think that's very likely, but it is a local number.

06:39.077 --> 06:42.258
So let me see, just a minute.

06:43.198 --> 06:44.698
They are recording a voicemail.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.199
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

06:46.259 --> 06:47.559
It's July 11th, 2025.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.359
It's Friday.

06:49.379 --> 06:53.080
I hope you can find a little relaxation in the show today.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.721
It's nothing, we're not going to cover the crap.

06:55.701 --> 06:57.022
There's a lot of crap to cover.

06:57.962 --> 06:59.762
But I just want to recommend a few friends.

07:00.243 --> 07:06.485
First, my friend in Boston, Massachusetts, fellow American Mark Kulak at HousatonicITS.com.

07:07.485 --> 07:10.086
Please follow his work, check his work out.

07:10.626 --> 07:11.867
Wow, it's a long voicemail.

07:12.247 --> 07:16.488
I hope it's not about a chicken being out or something like that.

07:17.369 --> 07:18.249
Also, I would like to

07:19.252 --> 07:27.579
I would like to talk to you about this Substack, biologyphenomenonphenom.substack.com.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.881
I want to recommend it.

07:30.001 --> 07:37.367
I'm going to give a shout out to the author of this today because I got a little heads up on the Debbie Sridhar tip.

07:38.248 --> 07:39.929
And so I thought I'd start with that.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.621
interesting going to the Red Pill Expo.

07:44.661 --> 07:49.202
I was not asked to present at this Red Pill Expo.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.623
The truth shall set you free.

07:51.663 --> 07:53.324
I'm absolutely certain of it.

07:53.344 --> 07:54.724
I really am.

07:54.945 --> 07:59.406
And I do think that biology is one pair of sunglasses you definitely gotta own.

08:00.607 --> 08:02.947
In this day and age, you gotta own it yourself.

08:03.708 --> 08:09.010
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're interested in having a sticker for your car or your water bottle, a clear one,

08:10.411 --> 08:14.154
Or a tactical patch to put on your favorite gun bag.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.598
Maybe your golf bag has a velcro area.

08:20.519 --> 08:25.363
Also, some people wear these tactical coats that have velcro patches all over the place.

08:26.224 --> 08:27.785
I don't know anybody like that of course.

08:28.886 --> 08:34.691
But I made a few patches because I know guys that have velcro things on their stuff.

08:34.991 --> 08:35.712
I don't have any of that.

08:36.791 --> 08:45.037
Anyway, this is a message from America to the world, but especially to my fellow Americans, because I think we have to get our shit together.

08:45.718 --> 08:47.219
And I think we can still do it.

08:48.319 --> 08:55.504
And the internet being still kind of, sort of free, at least from the perspective of you can send emails.

08:56.045 --> 09:02.209
I think there's still a way for you to stay focused on the biology, to not take their bait on social media, and to love your neighbor.

09:02.229 --> 09:02.810
See that focus?

09:03.746 --> 09:07.188
So, I mean, you really got to just see the focus.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.011
And the focus has to be on the biology.

09:11.051 --> 09:18.096
You got to really think about the root ideas, the root understanding of the stuff that people are talking about.

09:18.136 --> 09:21.098
If you just take it at face value and you don't stay focused.

09:21.118 --> 09:22.379
Look, stay focused.

09:22.999 --> 09:24.701
Stay focused.

09:25.461 --> 09:30.545
If you don't stay focused, then you're going to be distracted by these fools that they get on.

09:30.765 --> 09:31.886
Joe, stay focused.

09:32.941 --> 09:38.927
If you don't stay focused, even the guys that are on Joe Rogan can distract you.

09:39.067 --> 09:43.672
And so we need to teach our kids how to surf this disaster.

09:44.012 --> 09:46.635
And this is a cool example, but look at what it is.

09:46.715 --> 09:47.976
It's an artificial wave.

09:48.677 --> 09:51.040
He's teaching him on an artificial wave.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.524
It's like a safer version of nature, and you cannot see

09:56.505 --> 09:57.628
social media like that.

09:57.668 --> 10:03.419
You gotta see the artificial version of social media being something that they can control.

10:03.459 --> 10:04.822
They have control of the train.

10:05.303 --> 10:06.725
They have control of the water.

10:06.785 --> 10:08.248
They have control of everything.

10:09.269 --> 10:14.212
And so it's a very different scenario if half the surfers on the wave are working against you.

10:14.752 --> 10:20.776
And so every time you try to catch a wave, there are two or three surfers to say, dude, catch another wave, man.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.617
And so that's what happens.

10:23.317 --> 10:30.481
These skilled surfers, these artificially skilled, because the algorithms working against you, they lie against us.

10:30.601 --> 10:33.423
And when you're on that wave down in the bottom, you're in trouble.

10:34.003 --> 10:37.986
As a skilled TV watcher, as a skilled social media user, you are in trouble.

10:38.026 --> 10:39.808
And the only way out is to stay focused.

10:39.828 --> 10:40.308
That's right.

10:40.869 --> 10:43.030
Stay focused and away from the hocus pocus.

10:43.651 --> 10:47.154
Do not take the bait on social media and to love your neighbor.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.979
And loving your neighbor is actually more complicated than you think.

10:50.999 --> 10:58.503
You gotta go and, you know, see them when they're outside in their yard and say hello and ask them how they are and hope they give you an answer.

10:59.144 --> 11:05.548
You gotta have a little genuine interest in people in order to get to know them and, you know, that's what really works.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.809
My grandma used to always say, kill them with kindness.

11:08.309 --> 11:08.850
It's an art.

11:09.790 --> 11:13.499
to not be fake about it, you know, to actually care.

11:13.980 --> 11:14.541
It's an art.

11:14.722 --> 11:17.308
It's something you can teach your kids.

11:17.508 --> 11:18.550
You can set an example.

11:22.202 --> 11:28.226
Yes, I'm sure you just put your address in the chat and you will have a mailbox full of firearms.

11:28.286 --> 11:29.006
Go ahead and do that.

11:29.066 --> 11:29.547
Feel free.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.429
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

11:32.509 --> 11:37.252
We are trying to figure out... Holy Moses, I'm not even in there yet.

11:37.992 --> 11:39.213
Hold on one second.

11:39.253 --> 11:40.314
Let me switch over here.

11:41.946 --> 11:42.567
Hoo-ha!

11:42.647 --> 11:44.508
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

11:44.528 --> 11:48.111
Good evening, good morning, good night, wherever you are on this great planet.

11:48.732 --> 11:51.654
It is afternoon, sunny afternoon in Pittsburgh.

11:51.774 --> 11:57.819
And it's a little hot in here, but I've got the garage door finally shut in the front so there's no cross breeze anymore.

11:58.780 --> 12:03.524
But that's kind of necessary so that I feel at least a little comfortable with having the back door open.

12:04.725 --> 12:10.070
I'm gonna just pause really quick here and see if I've got some kind of

12:12.276 --> 12:12.917
Recent.

12:13.077 --> 12:14.218
Maybe a voicemail.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.281
Negative.

12:16.461 --> 12:18.343
No voicemail was left.

12:20.385 --> 12:22.207
I don't know really what to do about that.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.450
I don't even see a call there.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.191
What the hell?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.553
Oh no, that would be recent.

12:29.229 --> 12:34.433
I don't recognize... That could actually be... Ah, that could be somebody.

12:34.693 --> 12:35.394
Okay, never mind.

12:35.434 --> 12:36.335
I think I know what that is.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.197
That's a Craigslist adventure that we won't worry about anymore.

12:40.138 --> 12:42.139
Let me turn this down a little bit.

12:42.620 --> 12:45.262
I'm always looking for things that will enhance the table.

12:46.243 --> 12:50.026
And Craigslist can be a place where a bunch of people... It is a place.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.247
Let's just look at it this way.

12:51.767 --> 12:58.434
For a guy like me, Craigslist is a place where people who tried to do something and failed throw away all their really good equipment.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.057
I've gotten cameras that way.

13:01.597 --> 13:09.546
The rig that I use on the deck for Fearless Yoga is actually a rig that I basically assembled.

13:10.426 --> 13:12.907
With craigslist stuff and so you just got to know what you need.

13:13.027 --> 13:17.369
You got to know what works well You got to know what the limitations of things are.

13:17.389 --> 13:32.315
I've got a couple devices on my desk for example that because I was an idiot and collected all of these heat sinks from from computers being thrown away because I was friends with the IT guy you it doesn't matter and

13:33.107 --> 13:37.471
I had all these heat sinks around because I like to use them for... they're back there on my desk now.

13:37.871 --> 13:39.272
I like to use them to hold mail.

13:39.772 --> 13:40.873
They're very handy for that.

13:42.495 --> 13:44.636
And I just went overboard.

13:44.676 --> 13:45.977
I had a whole little box of them.

13:45.997 --> 13:53.383
But it turns out a couple of these pieces of Craigslist things don't work very well for a long period of time because they overheat.

13:53.443 --> 13:54.384
So I just mounted a...

13:55.202 --> 13:57.463
heat sink to both of the bottoms and now they can run all day.

13:58.243 --> 14:04.206
And I've done the same thing with my laptop, you know, and other things here are just, you know, stuff that I've gotten out of the garbage.

14:04.306 --> 14:05.247
I've told you that before.

14:05.867 --> 14:11.229
So I think there's a strategy here for building this free, independent bright web.

14:11.429 --> 14:17.973
And that is people like Joe Marshall, who are not, let's say,

14:19.295 --> 14:21.617
You know, they're focused on the content that they make.

14:22.478 --> 14:26.041
And, you know, you might say, well, you're not focused on the content you make.

14:26.081 --> 14:40.095
But I have been a casually obsessed user of PowerPoint since I started my master's degree, I guess, because

14:41.457 --> 14:46.578
During my master's degree, we were still doing all of our presentations with overhead.

14:46.678 --> 15:02.643
Sometimes I would do an overhead that I had drawn or printed and slide it underneath the rolling continuous piece so that if I had a figure there, for example, I could draw on it and then roll it clean and then draw on it again and roll it clean.

15:03.283 --> 15:09.688
And I used to give presentations like that during my, like journal clubs and things like that during my master's degree already.

15:09.728 --> 15:11.790
And I was already told that, wow, you're really good at this.

15:12.910 --> 15:18.715
And so when I started to learn PowerPoint, it just felt like I was in my sandbox, if you know what I mean.

15:19.375 --> 15:32.325
And so PowerPoint for me has always been something where I have for a while, I think in my early PhD, I probably explored all of the animations to an extent that it was annoying.

15:34.361 --> 15:42.608
And you almost have to do that in some context in order to understand what is annoying and what isn't and how to use things really nicely.

15:42.648 --> 15:50.175
And then, you know, at some point something came along in the functioning of the somebody got smart.

15:50.595 --> 15:56.520
And, you know, the transition between slides is something that you can really use to your advantage if you're clever.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.322
And so that's really the main trick with PowerPoint.

16:00.123 --> 16:05.906
If you're an obsessed user of it, if it's one of those things where you really like it a lot, then it's something you just incorporate.

16:05.946 --> 16:13.370
Maybe that's why, um, you know, some people really like to use StreamYard or really like to do other things.

16:14.191 --> 16:17.633
Um, yeah, I'm live right now.

16:18.013 --> 16:22.975
I mean, you know, it's, if you're in the same house, maybe you would know that I'm live right now.

16:23.776 --> 16:25.977
Um, anyway, let me get over here.

16:26.057 --> 16:26.757
Let me get over here.

16:26.817 --> 16:27.538
Let me get over here.

16:29.966 --> 16:32.650
So what we're trying to do is figure out how the hell did we get here?

16:34.010 --> 16:35.931
I just wanted to start with this slide again.

16:35.971 --> 16:43.575
I think it occurred to me that I haven't taken a long, in a while, to explain what my backdrop always is.

16:44.656 --> 16:51.239
But my backdrop here are numbers which are derived from CDC numbers from 2013 all the way to 2025, about the beginning of 2025, and then it falls off.

16:51.259 --> 16:55.161
I'm not up to date up to July because you can see the yellow line there at the,

17:03.863 --> 17:06.324
sort of where the audio graphic is.

17:09.546 --> 17:14.129
That graphic doesn't show all the way to July.

17:14.209 --> 17:20.252
So anyway, this is designed to show you, you know, how many people die every week in America.

17:20.352 --> 17:21.993
It is between 50,000 and 60,000.

17:22.033 --> 17:27.977
And then when we got into the pandemic, it was between 60 and 70,000 per week, and it's never really come down.

17:29.511 --> 17:45.361
So the idea to think about what we're trying to think about, what we have been thinking about for the last few years, really, even before I was fired from CHD, maybe even before I started working for CHD, we were already trying to figure out what is the

17:46.121 --> 17:46.922
the timeline?

17:46.982 --> 17:54.426
How do we explain these people being in positions that they were in knowing that they should be podcasting right now?

17:54.567 --> 18:10.437
How could Brett Weinstein in December of 2019 be on his number eight podcast with Sam Harris talking about how when there's a next pandemic that's killing 70% of people who are infected, then that we won't be able to tolerate any anti-vax nonsense.

18:10.977 --> 18:12.158
How is that possible?

18:13.629 --> 18:35.911
How is it possible that somebody like Piper Stover was on a podcast in 2019 in December talking about advanced biology and synthetic life and hyping up the fact that AI and synthetic life in seven years would just be something we'd have to accept with a former ambassador to India?

18:36.977 --> 18:42.563
with ties to the nuclear program, or I don't know, ask Mark Hulak, he knows.

18:43.084 --> 18:46.808
There's so many Indians involved, it's hard for me to keep them all straight.

18:48.790 --> 18:53.616
Shit, it's hard for me to keep just the Indians that I get emails from, never mind all the other ones.

18:56.246 --> 18:57.127
I don't understand.

18:57.147 --> 18:58.708
I don't understand what's going on.

18:58.728 --> 19:00.149
And I'm really trying to figure it out.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.029
I really am.

19:01.149 --> 19:17.861
But I think for sure, one thing for sure that I've learned after being a persistent pain in the ass for the last six years is that these actors were put in place to make sure that the damage from transfection would always be attributed to the novel virus or its spike protein.

19:18.321 --> 19:19.862
That's why they exist.

19:20.403 --> 19:23.245
That's why their coordinated script is so malevolent.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.058
And that's why they were sent to me in triplicates.

19:27.278 --> 19:28.780
All the time, three of them.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.522
Because they play you in groups.

19:33.603 --> 19:35.044
They work on you in groups.

19:35.104 --> 19:38.287
They invite you to something like Steve Kirsch's steering committee.

19:38.807 --> 19:39.067
Ha!

19:40.168 --> 19:41.749
I bet you that didn't even exist.

19:42.590 --> 19:43.951
Except to control people.

19:44.591 --> 19:49.175
Except to bring people into a group of controlled individuals on a controlled narrative.

19:50.655 --> 19:52.977
and bamboozle people into going along with him.

19:53.037 --> 19:55.378
I think they probably got John Bodwin that way.

19:55.959 --> 20:05.025
Although at some point in time, I told John Bodwin he was being used and he freaked out and then told everybody after that that he was, that I had yelled at him on the phone.

20:05.065 --> 20:07.547
Nobody yelled at me like that except for my ex-wife.

20:09.148 --> 20:16.933
So maybe you should take what I'm saying seriously instead of going back to Kevin McKernan and Steve Kirsh and having a sauna together.

20:20.563 --> 20:43.205
Look, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what to tell you, but I've done so much work that inevitably has revealed these people as witting or unwitting traders, people that are either willing not to care about what's behind the curtain or understand that they are on a boat that we're not on, or they're on a team that we're not on, or they've been promised something that we haven't been promised, and it's probably already been given to them.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.920
They probably already have said, wow, they were right.

20:47.060 --> 20:48.961
Substack is a lot of money.

20:49.061 --> 20:49.661
They were right.

20:49.721 --> 20:51.042
Locals is a lot of money.

20:51.082 --> 20:51.682
They were right.

20:51.742 --> 20:52.722
Rumble pays great.

20:52.762 --> 20:53.562
Wow, they were right.

20:53.623 --> 20:54.963
These sponsors are awesome.

20:57.684 --> 20:58.604
Wow, they were right.

20:58.684 --> 21:00.625
Having an Amazon book is great.

21:04.947 --> 21:06.367
That's what we're dealing with here.

21:07.708 --> 21:12.550
And until we turn on these people and force them to say things that make sense,

21:13.663 --> 21:18.266
that don't accept the pretenses of the basic narrative, we will never get out.

21:20.908 --> 21:29.294
You gotta start being more aggressive on social media because they are maintaining an illusion of consensus by sticking to the provided script.

21:29.334 --> 21:30.775
They are maintaining it now.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.687
And whether you like it or not, that's the only way out.

21:35.767 --> 21:40.070
If nobody does it but me on X, then it will never switch.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.011
And even if everybody does it on X, it may not switch.

21:43.472 --> 21:57.121
The alternative to that is leaving X and emailing your family and friends who follow Trump and who are on X to get off of X because these people are traitors and show them my videos, why?

22:00.393 --> 22:09.617
It is impossible to explain any of their intellectual positions in 2025 other than with the explanation that they are scripted traitors.

22:10.297 --> 22:12.618
None of them have made any intellectual progress.

22:12.678 --> 22:14.299
Some of them have gone backwards.

22:17.501 --> 22:27.425
And irrespective of how many of these people know my name, have been to my house, have texted my wife, none of them can tell you what I teach.

22:28.925 --> 22:29.366
None of them.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.810
Even when they say it's pretty good biology, they don't tell you what it is.

22:35.553 --> 22:37.576
They don't tell you where you can find it.

22:44.184 --> 22:45.685
So it's very hard to stay focused.

22:46.126 --> 22:50.029
It's very hard not to take the bait on social media if you go on social media.

22:50.069 --> 22:53.172
And it's very, very hard to love your neighbor if you're on social media.

22:53.232 --> 22:54.954
So please don't underestimate.

22:54.994 --> 22:58.857
This scripted bullshit is never going to end until we call it for what it is.

22:58.917 --> 23:05.423
Until we call these people traitors and they're so ashamed that they claim that they're being canceled and they quit.

23:06.667 --> 23:11.395
The problem is, is that our institutions are being hollowed out from within.

23:11.435 --> 23:13.058
We're about to have a mass firing.

23:13.478 --> 23:17.305
Lots of people took early retirement and that's all hidden behind these jokers.

23:18.649 --> 23:29.832
That's what makes these podcasters so terrible is because as they're doing the FDA podcast, they're not telling you that they lost most of the intellectual prowess of the organization over the last six months.

23:30.272 --> 23:32.473
And they're about to lose even more of their manpower.

23:32.493 --> 23:33.553
They're not going to tell you that.

23:34.114 --> 23:37.135
They're going to talk about innovation and radical transparency.

23:37.475 --> 23:41.856
And they're going to talk about it together because they've been practicing that for fricking five years.

23:45.407 --> 23:49.509
And so you can try to stay focused on the biology and not take their bait on social media.

23:49.549 --> 23:53.170
You can try to love your neighbor, but the bottom line is, is we are under attack.

23:53.210 --> 23:57.032
These people were set up in the same year as Brett Weinstein was set up.

23:58.392 --> 24:07.776
And then they had two or three years to get their shit together, two or three years to get settled in his faculty position, two or three years to start pretending, and there they go.

24:08.636 --> 24:12.418
From the start of the pandemic on, it's show, go, show, go, show, go.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.303
This guy has no business being there.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.463
You know, Johns Hopkins, are you kidding me?

24:20.043 --> 24:24.104
National Cancer Institute, you know where Lee Min Yen's in-laws work?

24:24.524 --> 24:28.405
What's going on here other than very, very easy to connect dots?

24:30.266 --> 24:42.089
Lee Min Yen's, yeah, her in-laws, they work at the same National Cancer Institute that this jackass worked at before he, in 2017, was set up with that article and this goofy photo.

24:47.509 --> 24:48.429
He writes books too.

24:50.450 --> 24:52.071
So how the frick did we get here?

24:54.792 --> 25:03.297
I showed you yesterday this video of Devi Sridhar and I didn't really do justice to the slime that she is.

25:03.377 --> 25:09.259
And one of the reasons why is because a lot of people don't want that energy, but I'll just be real frank.

25:09.359 --> 25:11.440
This is one of the worst people on the planet.

25:11.500 --> 25:15.222
She went full in on the idea that the vaccines were 100

25:17.483 --> 25:19.665
100% safe.

25:19.745 --> 25:29.733
And in fact, there's still evidence online of this because there's a BBC article or a CBC article where she said it and the correction is still at the bottom.

25:29.753 --> 25:34.497
Although they don't say they're correcting Devi, I assure you they are correcting Devi.

25:36.078 --> 25:40.760
And so this is a shout out to this Substack again, biologyphenom.substack.com.

25:40.780 --> 25:57.150
Please go there and see the painful truth of Scotland and realize that that very well could have happened in any Western nation with a population pyramid out of balance at the top like ours was or like Scotland's definitely was.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.510
They managed it with murder.

26:00.331 --> 26:03.453
And so this is, did I not put the video in?

26:03.493 --> 26:04.734
I probably did not put,

26:05.128 --> 26:06.529
the video in because I'm a jerk.

26:07.169 --> 26:07.610
Let me see.

26:10.952 --> 26:11.512
No, I didn't.

26:11.592 --> 26:13.333
So first of all, I'm going to escape here.

26:13.373 --> 26:15.154
It's probably better anyway that I didn't yet.

26:15.174 --> 26:19.577
So I'm going to insert this.

26:19.677 --> 26:21.999
See, I didn't run through the slide set before I started.

26:22.059 --> 26:24.420
And so that's how sometimes I would miss that.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.421
Where did I do that?

26:25.461 --> 26:27.402
Did I capture it or did I download it?

26:27.482 --> 26:28.583
I think I just downloaded it.

26:32.145 --> 26:33.406
And I'll have it fly in.

26:34.451 --> 26:34.931
Where is it?

26:35.992 --> 26:36.272
Really?

26:36.313 --> 26:37.173
I didn't download it?

26:38.414 --> 26:38.674
Oh, no.

26:38.734 --> 26:42.658
I must have captured it because that was on the BBC.

26:42.758 --> 26:43.238
There it is.

26:43.578 --> 26:43.979
OK.

26:44.019 --> 26:44.859
There's two videos.

26:44.879 --> 26:45.340
That's right.

26:46.581 --> 26:47.942
So this one will fly in.

26:47.962 --> 26:49.803
Let's see.

26:50.124 --> 26:50.924
Playback.

26:51.365 --> 26:52.505
Automatically.

26:52.786 --> 26:53.806
Animations.

26:54.407 --> 26:54.587
Add.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.768
Fly in.

26:55.988 --> 26:57.089
From the left.

26:57.509 --> 26:58.690
Animation pane.

26:58.971 --> 26:59.711
Up here.

27:00.772 --> 27:01.793
After previous.

27:01.893 --> 27:02.794
With previous.

27:04.079 --> 27:04.819
Get rid of that.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.260
See, this is how easy it is.

27:06.320 --> 27:10.601
If you know where you're doing and where it's going, you can do all kinds of things very quick.

27:10.721 --> 27:13.382
So I didn't have either of these videos in there.

27:13.402 --> 27:14.682
Now I will have them in here.

27:14.882 --> 27:17.863
So you just see how easy it is to fly in these things.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.024
It's not hard if you know what you're doing.

27:21.364 --> 27:22.104
Let's see.

27:22.204 --> 27:25.525
This one also playback automatically.

27:25.706 --> 27:27.146
Animations add.

27:27.326 --> 27:28.406
Fly in.

27:28.706 --> 27:29.207
Left.

27:30.207 --> 27:31.627
Animation pane.

27:31.727 --> 27:33.428
You need to be up there.

27:35.094 --> 27:39.537
And then this one would be, let's see on click.

27:39.798 --> 27:40.018
Yeah.

27:40.218 --> 27:41.879
And then that will be with previous.

27:41.959 --> 27:42.220
Yes.

27:44.641 --> 27:47.283
And so I, what I wanted to do was show this thing.

27:49.265 --> 27:51.106
What I wanted to do is show this article.

27:51.186 --> 27:52.147
Cause I think it's really cool.

27:52.187 --> 27:52.447
Oops.

27:52.828 --> 27:54.949
That's a scape here.

27:55.049 --> 27:55.650
Let's see.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.271
That has to be on click too.

27:57.451 --> 27:57.892
There we go.

28:01.021 --> 28:05.586
What I wanted to show you was this article from June of 2021.

28:06.547 --> 28:11.172
I wonder if anybody in the chat can name anything else that happened in June of 2021.

28:11.772 --> 28:15.556
I'll give you a couple minutes before I'll watch the chat and see if anybody gets it.

28:16.097 --> 28:18.880
June of 2021 was a very special month.

28:18.980 --> 28:22.744
June of 2021 was actually when Claire Craig started to talk about how

28:23.324 --> 28:33.448
The PCR test is a lot like restaurant food, and you got trade-offs, you know, you can have speed without, you know, cheapness or expensive or some bullshit.

28:33.508 --> 28:33.828
I don't know.

28:34.468 --> 28:37.429
Anyway, this lady's also working really hard.

28:37.489 --> 28:40.130
Remember, this is an American woman, apparently.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.852
who is a faculty member.

28:43.613 --> 28:47.416
Malone was not in Hawaii in June of 2021, I don't think.

28:47.536 --> 28:49.158
It could have been, I thought that was later.

28:50.058 --> 28:53.461
He was on the Brett Weinstein podcast in 2021, in June.

28:55.443 --> 29:03.650
So she does this article, and the correction there is this article has been amended to remove a reference by a contributor that the Pfizer vaccine is 100% safe.

29:07.898 --> 29:11.519
And this is about going to 12 and 15 year olds in June of 2021.

29:11.599 --> 29:16.742
So this is a pretty severely shitty time in our world.

29:17.782 --> 29:22.724
Because even though I still argue that a lot of it was placebo, where were the placebos and who didn't get them?

29:24.815 --> 29:32.802
And so this is really an extraordinary time in our history that we cannot allow to fade into distant memory.

29:32.862 --> 29:35.124
It has to be something we need to revisit right now.

29:35.665 --> 29:43.512
Because 2021 was when these people started to stunt, started to stunt to try and get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:43.552 --> 29:46.975
into the right position to be chosen as vice president for Donald Trump.

29:50.057 --> 29:51.398
I mean, that's what I see.

29:52.321 --> 30:12.595
And so this stunting, when it started in 2021, was very much mirrored by an even more grotesque, all in kind of commitment to the existence of the coronavirus, the existence of the crisis, the necessity, the obviousness to lock down, this kind of thing.

30:13.515 --> 30:15.216
And she was really at the heart of it.

30:15.256 --> 30:21.841
And it makes it especially scary because I'm not really sure, someone from the UK would have to tell me, does an intelligent,

30:22.962 --> 30:28.947
American accent, well spoken, you know, with good grammar and decent vocabulary.

30:28.967 --> 30:39.476
Does that sound intelligent to an Englishman the way that, you know, for a lot of Americans, the English, the English accent sounds intelligent?

30:39.496 --> 30:47.283
You're going to see in the second video, they use a man and he has an accent that really, he sounds like he's doing an imitation of himself.

30:47.343 --> 30:49.225
He's trying to do it so perfectly.

30:49.745 --> 30:56.227
and really the vaccine is really something that I can't, he's doing it in an absurd way almost.

30:56.307 --> 30:57.627
It doesn't sound natural.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.047
So let's watch these two videos.

31:02.968 --> 31:03.988
Once you've had the vaccine.

31:04.769 --> 31:08.089
So when the Pfizer vaccine was trialed among children.

31:08.109 --> 31:09.270
I probably moved it back here.

31:09.290 --> 31:09.830
There we go.

31:11.010 --> 31:14.711
Can you still spread or get COVID-19 once you've had the vaccine?

31:15.478 --> 31:24.385
So when the Pfizer vaccine was trialed among children in the United States, they found absolutely no cases of illness in the group that received the vaccine.

31:24.865 --> 31:28.368
And so it looks like the vaccine does protect against getting COVID-19.

31:29.589 --> 31:32.411
Would children get any side effects if they have the vaccine?

31:34.252 --> 31:36.994
Some children experienced similar side effects to adults.

31:37.455 --> 31:44.340
These included fatigue, it means feeling tired, having a headache, feeling generally unwell, but these cleared within a day or two.

31:44.741 --> 31:49.123
and it seems a small price to pay for actually being protected from the real disease when it comes.

31:49.143 --> 31:51.884
What are the benefits and disadvantages of getting it?

31:52.384 --> 31:56.425
The benefit of getting the vaccine is you don't need to worry about COVID-19.

31:56.445 --> 32:02.228
It means you're likely to be able to not infect your parents, the people you live with, and your teachers.

32:03.108 --> 32:09.370
And the downside is it's another jab, another injection into your arm, but the benefits definitely outweigh the risks.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.972
Is it possible to make the vaccines into pills because I don't like injections?

32:14.625 --> 32:21.248
Unfortunately, at this point, the vaccine is only available as an injection, but it really doesn't hurt too much.

32:21.288 --> 32:25.110
Just a quick pinch into your arm the first time, and then several weeks later.

32:25.170 --> 32:43.518
Now, what I find remarkable about this is, and I don't mean that as a pun, although it sounds like it at this point, is that if you look at Mark's work, you'll find that one of the motivations for going to the use of hypodermic needles for vaccination was because it hurt a lot less than any kind of cutaneous thing.

32:44.358 --> 32:49.521
Scraping and scratching the skin in order to inoculate somebody was not a nice process.

32:50.041 --> 32:52.803
And even injecting in the skin can be quite painful.

32:53.983 --> 33:08.231
And so injecting in the muscle where there are less nerves, and certainly not the kinds of nerves that are present in the skin, greatly reduces the discomfort, even if, you know, it spreads out the disaster over, you know, weeks to months.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.073
Second one, and then you're fully protected.

33:11.813 --> 33:13.654
When will Keds start to get the vaccine?

33:14.531 --> 33:19.874
The Pfizer vaccine has been approved now in the UK as being safe and effective.

33:20.334 --> 33:22.395
And the question now is, when will children get it?

33:22.855 --> 33:29.438
It looks likely to be once people in their 20s are done, people in their 30s, that will move down to younger age groups.

33:29.738 --> 33:37.082
And so the next group to get it after those in their 20s will be those who are 12 and older, probably starting with vulnerable children first.

33:37.862 --> 33:40.664
Why won't 11-year-olds and under be able to have it yet?

33:41.311 --> 33:47.173
Those younger than 12 won't get the vaccine yet because it hasn't yet been trialed in children under 12.

33:47.573 --> 33:52.454
There are trials ongoing to try to change the dosage to make it more appropriate for younger age groups.

33:52.934 --> 33:58.456
Right now, nowhere in the world is there a vaccine that has been designated safe for children under the age of 12.

34:05.498 --> 34:10.362
So if you scroll down in this article, there was a second video.

34:10.402 --> 34:12.403
And so I'm going to play that second video now.

34:12.423 --> 34:15.005
It was after all the questions like, is it safe for children?

34:15.045 --> 34:20.389
All those things that she answered were basically bullet points with shitty pictures in this article.

34:20.409 --> 34:21.931
And then at the bottom, there was this video.

34:21.951 --> 34:25.874
They teach your body to look out for some kind of

34:26.654 --> 34:29.136
What is the Pfizer vaccine and how does it actually work?

34:29.476 --> 34:54.391
What vaccines do is they teach your body to look out for some kind of infection, usually a bacteria or a virus, so that your body has like a pre... But see, if that's on children's BBC, then this is even more dark, because as I've said too often, and it's actually quoting Thomas Sowell, there are few things more dishonourable than misleading the young.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.942
This is gross indeed.

34:57.783 --> 35:01.207
I didn't know what CBBC was, but I guess I could have guessed from the coloring.

35:11.209 --> 35:17.191
and they're Y-shaped and they just bind to the bacteria or the virus and they're exactly designed to fit onto it and destroy it.

35:17.371 --> 35:22.973
And the other great thing is they stop you spreading bugs and viruses and bacteria around.

35:23.553 --> 35:29.435
So does this now mean that all 12 to 15-year-olds will now be vaccinated or is there still a little more work to be done?

35:29.975 --> 35:44.316
The part of the government that regulates drugs being safe, it's very important that drugs are checked for safety, has said that the Pfizer vaccine in younger people 12 to 15 is safe and it does work, it protects you from the virus.

35:44.496 --> 35:45.918
The next thing they have to do is go,

35:46.559 --> 35:47.740
Should we bother doing this?

35:48.060 --> 35:49.321
It's quite a lot of hassle.

35:49.341 --> 35:52.363
So it's not guaranteed that you will be offered a vaccine.

35:52.703 --> 35:55.485
And the other thing is that no one will be forced to have it.

35:55.705 --> 35:58.226
My personal opinion is it's a good thing to have.

35:58.327 --> 36:07.532
The more people that are vaccinated, the more we can slow the virus down, the more we can slow it down, the more that we can keep people out of hospital and look after the ones that do get poorly.

36:07.552 --> 36:08.273
So basically,

36:08.813 --> 36:11.954
If you have the vaccine, you're doing a generous thing.

36:12.235 --> 36:20.838
You're looking after the grownups around you, the people you love, all the people in the world around you who are more, they're going to be more affected by getting coronavirus than you will be.

36:21.878 --> 36:23.919
So what would you say to anyone watching now?

36:24.099 --> 36:25.380
That's really gross, right?

36:25.420 --> 36:26.880
You could do it for other people.

36:26.980 --> 36:32.263
So that's really a kind of coercion that should have never, ever been on children's television.

36:33.123 --> 36:34.884
Like that is just awful.

36:35.224 --> 36:35.544
Wow.

36:36.767 --> 36:39.088
who, you know, is quite scared of it.

36:39.548 --> 36:41.268
There are a few things to remember.

36:41.308 --> 36:43.349
The first is, it really doesn't hurt.

36:43.549 --> 36:47.490
If you've ever bitten your cheek, stubbed your toe, trod on a piece of Lego.

36:48.270 --> 36:50.331
So he's also in on the pain thing.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.212
So you really see this is the thing.

36:52.292 --> 36:56.113
Don't feel like it's going to hurt because we're going to stick it deep enough where it won't hurt.

36:57.233 --> 37:01.374
It'll hurt less than a snake bite because a snake bite doesn't usually go all the way to your muscle.

37:02.135 --> 37:03.275
Holy shit.

37:06.584 --> 37:08.044
That's the honest truth.

37:08.225 --> 37:11.406
If a bee sting went to your muscle, it would hurt less.

37:12.566 --> 37:13.086
That's true.

37:13.706 --> 37:13.986
It is.

37:15.787 --> 37:16.807
Those things are painful.

37:16.907 --> 37:18.808
In fact, the jab really doesn't hurt at all.

37:19.148 --> 37:20.789
So there are two ways you can think about it.

37:20.969 --> 37:21.209
One is,

37:22.386 --> 37:26.348
Take a slow breath, calm down, tell people that you're worried about it.

37:26.428 --> 37:27.208
That always helps.

37:27.389 --> 37:32.011
Certainly when you go, if you're going to have it, tell the person who's giving you the vaccine, I'm a bit worried about this.

37:32.371 --> 37:33.592
And then you can approach it in two ways.

37:33.752 --> 37:38.494
One is you can go, I'm closing my eyes, I'm looking away, do it now, and then it'll be over.

37:38.974 --> 37:41.876
The other thing, which I quite like, is to say, can I see the needle?

37:42.136 --> 37:42.976
Can I see the bottle?

37:43.336 --> 37:45.357
Where are you going to put it?

37:45.498 --> 37:48.259
Show me what's going on, and then you'll feel a bit more in control.

37:48.619 --> 37:52.482
Could we potentially see vaccines being offered to people under the age of 12?

37:52.682 --> 37:56.885
I think that we've still got a lot of research to do.

37:57.065 --> 38:03.610
Now, it has been really well tested and it's been given to tens of millions, possibly by now hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

38:04.811 --> 38:07.113
And they were already making that argument.

38:07.153 --> 38:08.574
Remember that very clearly.

38:08.614 --> 38:15.059
And that argument continues to be made now that obviously it worked pretty well or there'd be a lot more people bitching.

38:16.897 --> 38:22.347
And so we have quite a good idea about safety, but as people get younger, we have to be very careful.

38:22.407 --> 38:23.589
Children's health is very important.

38:23.829 --> 38:25.632
It may be useful to do.

38:25.993 --> 38:27.856
Children's health is worth defending.

38:29.929 --> 38:31.830
to stop it spreading even more.

38:31.891 --> 38:33.492
That would be the main reason to do it.

38:33.552 --> 38:37.795
But I think at the moment, I don't know the answer to that.

38:37.855 --> 38:40.537
There's still more research to be done, but possibly.

38:40.997 --> 38:45.000
There are going to be quite a few kids watching now who might have heard of this thing called side effects.

38:45.301 --> 38:46.402
What does that mean?

38:46.862 --> 38:51.225
So most drugs, most medicines, most things we put in our body do have some side effects.

38:51.265 --> 38:54.167
They're given to make us better, but often they can make you feel a bit poorly.

38:54.207 --> 38:58.571
If you've ever had a course of antibiotics, sometimes it gives you diarrhea, sometimes it gives you a tummy ache.

38:58.971 --> 39:17.459
those things are called side effects a few kids watching now who might have heard of this thing called side effects what does that mean this thing called side effects holy shit these kids watching may have heard this of this thing called side effects holy shit

39:18.979 --> 39:23.363
So most drugs, most medicines, most things we put in our body do have some side effects.

39:23.383 --> 39:26.306
They're given to make us better, but often they can make you feel a bit poorly.

39:26.326 --> 39:29.428
If you've ever had a course of antibiotics, sometimes it gives you diarrhea.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.709
Sometimes it gives you a tummy ache.

39:31.030 --> 39:31.850
Wow.

39:31.991 --> 39:33.212
It gives you a tummy ache.

39:33.832 --> 39:38.016
Sometimes antibiotics give you a tummy ache, but I'm not going to tell you why.

39:38.036 --> 39:40.418
Holy shit.

39:44.636 --> 39:48.638
You know, transfection could have some side effects that are different than a tummy ache.

39:48.658 --> 39:50.799
You know, like a little chest problem.

39:52.040 --> 39:55.102
Or some autoimmunity to all your blood vessels.

39:55.942 --> 39:59.184
Or maybe some brain leakage, or I don't know what.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.545
Holy shit!

40:01.906 --> 40:03.347
Those things are called side effects.

40:03.927 --> 40:06.208
The vaccines are made by lots of different companies.

40:06.268 --> 40:07.649
So Pfizer is one of the companies.

40:07.969 --> 40:11.311
Another famous one in the UK is the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.

40:11.331 --> 40:13.052
It's a different kind of vaccine.

40:13.092 --> 40:13.993
It works in a different way.

40:14.313 --> 40:16.994
And that one has had some more severe side effects.

40:17.434 --> 40:20.076
So that one is actually not at the moment approved for children.

40:20.416 --> 40:20.596
it's not

40:35.293 --> 40:40.200
It's not impossible to exaggerate how much information they look at.

40:40.620 --> 40:48.871
This guy sounds like he's talking about Charles Rixey because it's impossible to exaggerate how much information he's looked at.

40:48.971 --> 40:50.733
Like seriously, it's incredible.

40:51.374 --> 40:52.134
Holy shit.

40:52.274 --> 40:58.036
Hard they work to make sure the vaccines don't cause too many problems, particularly in children.

40:58.417 --> 41:01.057
So the Pfizer vaccine has got a low side effect profile.

41:01.438 --> 41:06.159
After the jab, you might feel a bit bluey, you might feel a bit achy and tired or a bit feverish for a day or so.

41:06.419 --> 41:08.780
You know, it's not, it's not, it's not nothing.

41:09.560 --> 41:16.583
But in terms of more severe, like properly dangerous side effects, I really, really don't think you have anything to worry about.

41:16.883 --> 41:19.185
Well, Dr. Zan, thank you very much.

41:19.265 --> 41:24.569
I feel like I'm all clued up now, so hopefully... I mean, that's even more hardcore than Malone on the beach, right?

41:24.589 --> 41:28.912
At least Malone on the beach was kinda, sorta saying that you probably don't need it.

41:28.992 --> 41:36.537
I mean, he's saying you'll be fine, it's great, and not only that, but you'll be doing a favor to all those people around you who are so much more vulnerable than you.

41:37.738 --> 41:40.140
Holy mother of goodness.

41:41.241 --> 41:42.922
When at home, we'll be just as clued up.

41:45.916 --> 41:46.256
Wow.

41:48.218 --> 42:00.728
So, Debbie Sridhar got called out on stage, and I have a recording of it that was also forwarded to me by the author of that substack that I'm plugging, biologyphenom.substack.com.

42:02.049 --> 42:02.589
Listen to this.

42:04.791 --> 42:11.276
Well, my name's Moira Brown, and I've come all the way from Brussel Ferry to ask Debbie and to her face.

42:11.576 --> 42:13.878
I would like to know why you made the claim

42:15.665 --> 42:17.367
in August 2021 on Twitter.

42:17.387 --> 42:21.993
Pfizer and Moderna were over 90%.

42:27.259 --> 42:33.087
I need to have the selection paned so that I can send you to the back.

42:38.846 --> 42:46.129
My name is Moira Brown and I've come all the way from Brosser Ferry to ask Debbie to her face.

42:46.389 --> 42:53.532
I would like to know why you made the claim in August 2021 on Twitter.

42:53.552 --> 43:00.775
Pfizer and Moderna were over 90% effective at stopping infection and stopping transmission.

43:01.916 --> 43:03.917
And the Pfizer document

43:05.815 --> 43:13.721
In case you don't notice that she said in that tweet, she also said Delta has dropped the effectiveness of covering transmission to about 50%.

43:15.322 --> 43:19.705
So that's a pretty remarkable claim to be making on Twitter.

43:20.026 --> 43:24.189
And where again, it's important to realize that she's making that on Twitter.

43:24.609 --> 43:26.351
I think that's really significant.

43:26.371 --> 43:30.594
There's no testing against stopping transmission.

43:30.814 --> 43:32.435
In August 2021 on Twitter,

43:35.464 --> 43:38.085
So there you can see Delta, this has dropped to 50%.

43:38.905 --> 43:59.012
So again, focus on the fact or see it if you can, keep it in mind that it is remarkable that around the world, around the world, it seems that this illusion was sustained by people acting on a script on Twitter.

44:01.431 --> 44:05.093
Devi Sridhar was not also on lots of other places.

44:05.213 --> 44:06.694
I bet she has a Substack.

44:08.035 --> 44:21.563
And once you see that Substack, Locals, Rumble, and X are all belonging to the same people, you might see that this is all one malevolent show.

44:22.744 --> 44:26.486
Because those people are on the same team as the other people because they're all billionaires.

44:28.451 --> 44:31.173
It is remarkable once you see it.

44:31.314 --> 44:50.870
Okay, remember this is a shout out to the Substack, biologyphenom.substack.com and this is Debbie Sridhar getting her clock cleaned live and I believe it's in 2022 on stage by someone in Scotland.

45:03.513 --> 45:04.153
What happened there?

45:06.074 --> 45:10.297
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:10.397 --> 45:12.358
Okay, hold on one second.

45:12.418 --> 45:14.379
What vaccine passports everywhere.

45:14.559 --> 45:17.981
So we'd be kept outside like dogs.

45:18.181 --> 45:19.502
There was no test mission.

45:20.623 --> 45:25.105
And the Pfizer document, phase one, two and three trials.

45:25.325 --> 45:27.627
There was no testing against stopping transmission.

45:28.087 --> 45:28.287
None.

45:29.328 --> 45:29.888
You claimed it.

45:31.281 --> 45:38.368
90% stop transmission and you push for vaccine passports everywhere so we'd be kept outside like dogs.

45:39.870 --> 45:43.133
Suggesting and that's you're on STV talking about that.

45:44.134 --> 45:48.238
So anyway I just want to know when it was never tested against stopping transmission why you made that claim?

45:49.039 --> 45:53.384
So when you look at that claim in the paper it says it was studied

46:05.584 --> 46:09.308
So she's saying it was stopping transmission with the wild type.

46:10.029 --> 46:21.980
And so here they are very strictly staying on script that there is an evolution happening and that the evolution of the virus changes the way that it presents itself across populations.

46:23.318 --> 46:25.140
changes our vulnerabilities to it.

46:25.680 --> 46:33.546
Can even change the way that you experience the illness, whereas now we have razor blade throat or some bullshit like that.

46:34.806 --> 46:39.009
This is an ongoing enchantment that we're supposed to pass on to our kids.

46:41.131 --> 46:42.952
And we can't do it, but she's a part of it.

46:42.972 --> 46:48.476
That's why she was on Children's BBC saying that it was 100% a foul correction, not 100% effective.

46:52.276 --> 47:02.885
The new variant she said negated immunity in effect It was dr. Gregor Smith here is Tony Fauci in the state

47:14.660 --> 47:17.203
in terms of when it was used in the real world.

47:17.223 --> 47:26.735
So she cites Tony Fauci and other people that said that in the real trials, in the real world, it was 90% effective or whatever, 100% effective, and now it's changed.

47:27.956 --> 47:31.481
The Scottish study in wildfires was at a stop in transmission.

47:32.990 --> 47:35.532
It's still not being tested against stopping transmission.

47:35.933 --> 47:38.935
You're selling vaccinations based on stopping transmission.

47:38.975 --> 47:39.756
That's what you're doing.

47:40.236 --> 47:42.298
For the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

47:42.338 --> 47:45.080
Who finances your global health, by the way?

47:45.701 --> 47:47.282
I don't get funded by Bill Gates.

47:47.522 --> 47:49.043
I don't get funded by Scottish Government.

47:49.063 --> 47:50.525
I receive zero farm money.

47:50.865 --> 47:54.548
I've been asking on advisory boards about six pharma companies.

47:54.608 --> 47:55.309
I've declined.

47:55.389 --> 47:56.610
So who pays your salary?

47:56.650 --> 47:58.932
The University of Ezra and the Wellcome Trust.

48:00.239 --> 48:01.380
And the Welcome Trust.

48:03.902 --> 48:04.983
Yeah, I don't know what to say.

48:05.023 --> 48:07.645
I mean, I know that she's a very, very bad person.

48:08.066 --> 48:17.954
She was involved in Scotland where some of the worst crimes were committed, and definitely where some of the best evidence exists that crimes were committed.

48:18.875 --> 48:22.896
And unfortunately, very few people are advocating for an investigation.

48:22.976 --> 48:24.857
Very few people are looking back to it.

48:25.537 --> 48:33.259
And that means that it's very hard to use it as an example for us to also look back to, for us to say, hey, we have to do the same in America.

48:33.339 --> 48:44.882
Nobody in CHD, ICAN, Grace's dad, like nobody is advocating for everybody to open the records of everybody that supposedly died of COVID in their family so we can see if that's what really happened.

48:46.035 --> 48:51.276
and find out if instead they were killed by a few of these things and give them a list.

48:51.416 --> 48:53.657
Nobody has that handout yet.

48:54.197 --> 48:57.258
It's actually a pretty good idea for something GigaOM Biological should do.

48:58.458 --> 49:04.580
This is called Breaking Through by Leftover Salmon from the Nashville sessions.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.320
I'll see you in a minute.

49:28.135 --> 49:40.230
It's been a long, long time Holdin' on tight Holdin' on, hard climbs Breakin' down walls

49:43.280 --> 50:09.954
whole long way never make it in this world what I heard them say now I can see the tide slowly turning wildfires of yesterday slowly burning and it feels like

50:11.024 --> 50:39.057
Finally breaking through now All these dreams are really coming true somehow When it seemed like we were never gonna make it through the night

50:40.535 --> 50:46.096
Somewhere in the darkness, I can see a guide light.

50:47.477 --> 50:54.098
From a place deep down inside, a vision came to me.

50:55.319 --> 50:58.780
Burning like the sunrise over deep blue.

51:07.038 --> 51:32.186
in this life there's a whole lot more than just trying to survive and it seems like we're finally making through now all these dreams are really coming true somehow breaking

51:35.299 --> 51:36.468
Breaking through

52:31.574 --> 52:52.056
As I watch these circles start to come around And the thunder in the distance makes a mournful sound Careful what you wish for, you may never be the same

52:54.305 --> 53:20.414
through the wilderness while the moonlight calls your name I'm finally right back where I belong feeling right where there can be no wrong and it feels like we're finally breaking through now

53:22.441 --> 53:29.411
All these dreams are really coming true somehow.

53:29.472 --> 53:33.477
Breaking through, breaking through now.

53:33.598 --> 53:34.158
Breaking

54:22.143 --> 54:42.597
I just want to make sure everybody realizes that's watching the show that this man claims to be the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, claims to have spun off a number of companies that do sequencing technologies and sold a number of technologies and companies in his lifetime.

54:43.017 --> 54:48.881
He lives in a pretty rich part of Boston on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean with $10,000 cats, who he also makes

54:52.404 --> 54:58.693
homages of in the form of Hawaiian shirts with his cats on them in the bushes.

55:00.175 --> 55:01.737
This guy is a liar.

55:03.159 --> 55:04.581
And I say that with confidence.

55:05.287 --> 55:06.467
He's lying about me.

55:06.487 --> 55:29.095
He is, in a way, interfering with my ability to make a living because of his lying about me, and his lying about how the Wuhan cover-up book was written, his lying about the no-see-um technology that Barak didn't invent, his lying about virology, and his lying about the Human Genome Project.

55:29.155 --> 55:31.616
He is one of the worst Americans alive.

55:32.762 --> 55:44.625
And I am very, very happy to say it knowing that he's probably worth a hundred million dollars and could sneeze enough money to sue my family into oblivion because he won't, because it's the truth.

55:48.746 --> 55:54.248
Kevin McKernan is a liar and Kevin McKernan is a traitor to American's grandchildren.

55:55.373 --> 56:05.383
He is as shitty as Mary Holland, as shitty as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as shitty as Robert Malone.

56:09.218 --> 56:21.966
Now, I don't really see Brett Weinstein and his wife in that same light because I think they're much less intelligent and much more vulnerable from an ego perspective.

56:22.606 --> 56:23.727
And they have been insulated.

56:24.207 --> 56:31.491
They have been insulated their entire lives by being in this group of people that runs in the circles of the Kennedys.

56:32.071 --> 56:34.473
Remember that his father was the first

56:36.061 --> 56:44.830
intellectual property lawyer employed by the Department of Justice, and specifically in the Department of Justice of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.

56:45.731 --> 56:53.399
And so it's very, very curious that we now have at the head of the HHS that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:53.439 --> 56:53.619
guy.

56:55.372 --> 56:58.154
As a fake anti-vaxxer and I will say it quite clearly.

56:58.614 --> 57:00.135
I've taken pictures with the guy.

57:00.155 --> 57:04.318
He is a fake anti-vaxxer He's a fake health freedom guy.

57:04.378 --> 57:21.868
He's doing whatever he was told Would get him far and it didn't get him as far as maybe he thought it maybe he knows he's being used now maybe at this point it's just Go say this and he just does it because that's the way it works and his Hollywood wife has always done it that way So whatever it's possible

57:23.561 --> 57:26.862
But he masqueraded for a very long time as an independent thinker.

57:26.882 --> 57:29.383
He masqueraded for a long time as a book author.

57:29.423 --> 57:35.245
He masqueraded for a long time as somebody that everybody in America could look up to and maybe even trust.

57:37.746 --> 57:41.788
And so he's guilty of something especially heinous, in my humble opinion.

57:41.848 --> 57:46.890
Just like Brian Hooker is guilty of something especially heinous because he enabled that.

57:49.773 --> 57:54.016
In 2013 Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism to describe vaccine injury and now he does.

57:54.957 --> 57:56.478
Just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:56.518 --> 57:59.481
does and in September we can expect an explanation.

58:02.864 --> 58:07.448
It's been a long strange trip coming to realize that there is this elaborate

58:08.948 --> 58:17.935
well-organized, coordinated movement that is not really about health freedom, but it's about destroying the regulatory structure of America.

58:18.395 --> 58:27.622
It's about creating a free-for-all in medicine and a free-for-all in products and in the market of regulate, just get rid of everything.

58:28.843 --> 58:38.611
Because the idea is to fast track our transition from injecting a rather eclectic or even motley

58:39.864 --> 58:51.694
group of substances into our children to getting serious about it and trying to find ways to interact with the genetic mechanisms that define us.

58:52.014 --> 58:56.658
And so that's why transfection will eventually be personalized

58:57.540 --> 59:03.725
and the vaccine schedule will be eventually personalized for us based on our genetic and medical data.

59:03.766 --> 59:04.626
That is the goal.

59:04.686 --> 59:23.022
That's been the goal for quite some time because the Human Genome Project has always understood that the only way that a machine learning computer algorithm could usefully augment our understanding of our own heritability process

59:24.230 --> 59:32.558
we would need full access to humans as experimental animals because nothing useful can be learned in laboratory animals.

59:33.138 --> 59:34.340
We can learn a lot about mice.

59:34.980 --> 59:43.868
We might even be able to learn a lot about rodents in general or about primates in general, but the specific mechanisms that will work in humans will inevitably be specific.

59:43.928 --> 59:49.874
And that is one of the things that in the last 30 years of investigation in our biology, that's what we've learned.

59:51.112 --> 01:00:03.279
We have become very familiar with the extreme limitations of studying animal models with the intent of studying ourselves indirectly.

01:00:03.339 --> 01:00:05.920
That turns out to be something that has been exhausted.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.541
It's not to say that we didn't learn anything.

01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:28.485
I mean, I've got some pretty old books over there from the late 1800s that were school books, school biology books from the Netherlands, and we have gone far since then, but relatively from the perspective of understanding how complex things are.

01:00:29.352 --> 01:00:34.595
rather than finding a unified set of laws that helps us understand everything better.

01:00:35.076 --> 01:00:40.599
That's really the illusion that evolution, because DNA, this bad biology presents.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:47.623
And so this bullshit script is designed to coerce us into passing this bad biology onto our kids once and for all.

01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:49.905
The same bad biology that was passed on to us.

01:00:51.225 --> 01:00:55.328
Because we can break this illusion with a very simple statement.

01:00:56.638 --> 01:01:09.309
whereas these people are on a six-year script of bullshit, we can break it with one simple statement that is not absurd, but actually real.

01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:13.352
And what is that simple statement?

01:01:13.372 --> 01:01:21.299
Well, the simple statement is that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is a methodology that originated in the late 1800s.

01:01:26.576 --> 01:01:29.558
It's not an extremely advanced idea.

01:01:31.539 --> 01:01:48.329
And so it almost seems as though, with a little bit of an illusion of consensus in the media and in the textbooks, what is likely to be just a bad idea has become accepted as a medical methodology.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.972
And these people are on the perfect script

01:01:53.894 --> 01:01:55.997
so that our children will never figure that out.

01:01:56.057 --> 01:02:04.688
They are purposefully placed and scripted to make sure that our children don't figure out that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:09.294
And it took Mark Kulak to do the research to actually show that.

01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:24.551
And now he seems to have found information which suggests that a mass rollout of intramuscular injection in 1918 may be the real cause of the Spanish flu.

01:02:28.433 --> 01:02:31.035
And so I want to watch this video because it's just crazy.

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:32.416
Subject.

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.057
And I know you've spoken on that.

01:02:34.077 --> 01:02:34.918
Hold on one second.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.178
Excellent guess, by the way.

01:02:36.499 --> 01:02:38.040
I'm going to go over to the right again.

01:02:40.862 --> 01:02:42.102
So this guy is talking.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.861
This guy is talking on the Joe Rogan podcast.

01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:53.222
I believe he's talking about bees and other stuff.

01:02:53.322 --> 01:03:00.343
So he's gonna bounce around a little bit, but this is the part where he transitions into saying vaccines are a hot topic and you've had some good guests.

01:03:00.923 --> 01:03:05.204
Now, what I'd like to point out, I'm just gonna start it over there and then I'm gonna switch back again.

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.325
Why are you being such a pain?

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:16.951
I'm doing something wrong here because, yeah, I'll wait.

01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:26.597
Sometimes I think I just make some... I know vaccines are a very hot subject, and I know you've spoken on that.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.118
You've had some excellent guests.

01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:29.379
Some excellent guests.

01:03:29.459 --> 01:03:36.163
Now, he's had some of the shittiest people in America on with regard to vaccines, including one Suzanne Humphreys.

01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:41.566
Suzanne Humphreys in 2018 used to say that she didn't think there were any safe vaccines.

01:03:41.606 --> 01:03:42.567
It wasn't possible.

01:03:44.099 --> 01:03:49.242
But she didn't quite get to the stage where she didn't think that intramuscular injection was a good methodology.

01:03:49.282 --> 01:03:51.403
She didn't think vaccines were any good.

01:03:51.483 --> 01:04:04.591
So at the time when Brandy Vaughn was alive and Tony Bark was alive, she was already laying down this shitty script where vaccines are real, vaccines are a great idea, vaccines are not, intramuscular injection is not a thing.

01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:06.192
It's like vaccines are a thing.

01:04:07.353 --> 01:04:10.575
And vaccines can't be good or they are good or some are good.

01:04:10.595 --> 01:04:12.236
It's all the same bullshit.

01:04:13.135 --> 01:04:39.015
And that lady, if she would have gone on Joe Rogan and said she doesn't think there are any safe vaccines, that there can't be a safe vaccine, that they're antithetical to the way that our immune system is organized, then she would have been very, very close to saying what Brandy Vaughn was saying on the same stage as her in 2018, that we need to come to the realization that injection can't be compared to anything else, because it's so different than ingestion.

01:04:41.715 --> 01:04:42.856
It's a terrible idea.

01:04:44.657 --> 01:05:00.009
And Suzanne Humphreys was put in place to make sure that there was somebody there that wasn't saying that, that had an open mind about maybe there would be future vaccines, or maybe some are good, or maybe it's some part of the vaccines, when Tony and Brandy were not saying that.

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:03.592
And this is the extraordinary thing.

01:05:03.632 --> 01:05:04.833
They actually stopped

01:05:05.816 --> 01:05:17.003
Brandy and Tony from being able to make it all the way to the finish line and realize that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea that originated in the late 1800s.

01:05:18.304 --> 01:05:19.564
But they almost got there.

01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:25.408
If it wasn't for Brian Hooker and for Mary Holland and for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:25.628 --> 01:05:27.149
and for James Lyons Wyler,

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:34.489
and for Suzanne Humphreys, who was just on the Joe Rogan Show and who he's referring to with the great guest remark.

01:05:35.229 --> 01:05:37.351
Listen to this nonsense.

01:05:38.011 --> 01:05:40.653
By the way, excellent guests or researchers on this.

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:49.020
But I just want to give a thoughtful discussion between viruses and vaccines.

01:05:50.941 --> 01:05:53.203
Which is worse, the virus or the vaccine?

01:05:54.804 --> 01:05:55.625
I'm a libertarian.

01:05:56.992 --> 01:06:02.155
I believe every family, every individual has a right to make an informed decision.

01:06:03.756 --> 01:06:15.102
The problem that I see with the vaccine industry, the industrial vac- Now he's opened the possibility for the no virus people to say, see, he accepts the virus.

01:06:15.582 --> 01:06:18.144
He thinks that there was a virus, so then he's full of shit.

01:06:19.448 --> 01:06:25.711
but the no virus people will never tell you that there are no viruses, therefore intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:06:26.352 --> 01:06:27.372
They've never said it.

01:06:27.732 --> 01:06:28.713
They won't say it.

01:06:29.773 --> 01:06:33.735
They can't say it because if they said it, then we would get somewhere.

01:06:34.996 --> 01:06:37.037
They stick to the provided script.

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:39.799
This shithead is amazing.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.861
Complex is the failure to disclose.

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.863
I don't think Americans are stupid.

01:06:48.601 --> 01:06:51.242
I think Americans become stupid when they're not informed.

01:06:51.563 --> 01:06:53.224
I gotta turn on the air conditioner, holy balls.

01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:59.787
My partner, as a physician, she goes, giving Hep B vaccines to a child makes no sense.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:02.088
This is sexually transmitted disease.

01:07:02.128 --> 01:07:04.170
Why are you giving a vaccine to a 10-year-old?

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:05.630
Or a baby.

01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:06.231
Or a baby.

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:10.813
And in med school, when anyone would mention that, why are we doing this, they were vilified.

01:07:11.534 --> 01:07:12.774
Vilified, shut down.

01:07:12.794 --> 01:07:15.216
It's like, what happened to thoughtful, good science?

01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:16.536
It's just a reasonable question.

01:07:16.576 --> 01:07:17.137
Money happened.

01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:24.343
It's also these vaccine manufacturers are immune to the financial consequences of the side effects.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:25.743
Absolutely.

01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:27.583
We need to have full disclosure.

01:07:27.863 --> 01:07:28.064
Yeah.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.844
Now, let me go through a thought experiment.

01:07:29.904 --> 01:07:30.184
OK.

01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:31.684
Listen, this is my opinion.

01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:36.125
Other people may just visually disagree with me, but let's do this.

01:07:36.146 --> 01:07:37.306
Two thought experiments I want to do.

01:07:38.006 --> 01:07:38.386
First one.

01:07:38.406 --> 01:07:42.267
A million lives were saved with a vaccine.

01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:43.527
One person dies.

01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.328
Hey, you took it for the home team.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:46.028
Sorry.

01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:49.417
One person dies out of 100,000.

01:07:50.038 --> 01:07:53.979
Still ratio is pretty good.

01:07:54.059 --> 01:07:55.699
My mind, my judgment, sorry.

01:07:55.979 --> 01:07:57.000
Again, you took it from the home team.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.660
One out of 10,000, okay.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.921
Still the ratio is pretty good, okay.

01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:04.702
One out of 1,000, okay.

01:08:04.802 --> 01:08:06.062
One out of 100, you're making me nervous.

01:08:06.142 --> 01:08:07.142
One out of 10, no.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:08.202
That's where I draw the line.

01:08:08.383 --> 01:08:10.603
I would say, forget it.

01:08:11.303 --> 01:08:17.325
Now, the contradiction that we have, the opposing forces here that we have,

01:08:18.405 --> 01:08:32.441
is that is it better for society to have vaccinations to protect the commons or is it better for you to have an individual decision for your family to protect yourself if you want to?

01:08:33.524 --> 01:08:39.866
If you are going to make that decision, you should have an informed decision based on the best of science.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:47.947
All vaccines and all companies should disclose what is the percentage of protection.

01:08:48.988 --> 01:08:53.809
I have a physician friend who says 30 percent protection, but I'm sick for four or five days.

01:08:55.074 --> 01:08:55.434
I don't know.

01:08:55.474 --> 01:08:56.656
That's not worth it.

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:58.197
70% protection.

01:08:58.958 --> 01:08:59.278
Okay.

01:08:59.618 --> 01:08:59.939
All right.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:04.343
You know, so everyone has to balance the risk benefit ratio.

01:09:04.463 --> 01:09:06.364
But we need real data to be able to make that assessment.

01:09:06.384 --> 01:09:06.845
We need real data.

01:09:06.985 --> 01:09:08.426
We need full disclosure.

01:09:08.747 --> 01:09:09.207
Right.

01:09:09.327 --> 01:09:11.509
And so radical transparency.

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:13.391
Do you see how stupid this is?

01:09:13.411 --> 01:09:15.052
Wow.

01:09:15.092 --> 01:09:16.334
I want to do the Joe Rogan.

01:09:16.474 --> 01:09:17.415
Wow.

01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:20.536
Wow, that's great.

01:09:20.776 --> 01:09:31.900
And for anyone to accuse another physician and vilify them because they ask a logical question and they're humiliated by the medical community is fundamentally unfair.

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.361
What happened with good science?

01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:36.142
You have to follow the science.

01:09:36.642 --> 01:09:37.702
And this is so important.

01:09:37.742 --> 01:09:44.065
And that's why I think we're getting this cacophony, this echo chamber where the voices that are the loudest

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.421
tend to be the stupidest sometimes.

01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:48.082
Or the most compromised.

01:09:48.162 --> 01:09:50.544
Yeah, and they drown out a dissent.

01:09:50.824 --> 01:09:51.125
Yes.

01:09:51.505 --> 01:09:56.709
I just got a notification that I lost another monthly subscription.

01:09:57.349 --> 01:10:04.394
Sorry to see you go, Mr. I. The letter I, I don't know who you are, but thank you for your support.

01:10:04.475 --> 01:10:08.638
I hope that you're not leaving because you don't like what you see.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:12.601
And I hope also you're leaving because you have better things to spend your money on.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:13.741
And I hope it's land.

01:10:15.662 --> 01:10:17.104
and not Bitcoin or gold.

01:10:18.245 --> 01:10:20.467
Anyway, good luck to you and thank you for your support.

01:10:20.728 --> 01:10:26.594
We all should be able to ask for the data and the information to make an individual decision.

01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:31.740
And science shouldn't be this ideological or ideologically captured thing.

01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:34.777
That's why I hate the term anti-vaxxers.

01:10:35.017 --> 01:10:36.478
I think it's a pejorative term.

01:10:36.639 --> 01:10:37.800
I think it's prejudiced.

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.922
Can you see how it's a hamster wheel?

01:10:41.623 --> 01:10:49.830
Is it really that you're going to go on Joe Rogan and think that you're talking in an insightful way by saying that I really hate the term anti-vaxxer?

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:51.651
It's kind of a pejorative.

01:10:52.492 --> 01:10:53.453
This is a joke.

01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:56.143
This is an absolute joke.

01:10:56.664 --> 01:10:58.506
They think you're stupid.

01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:05.934
They know you're gonna watch, or not you, but they know that people are gonna watch this shit and drink it up.

01:11:07.816 --> 01:11:08.597
It's remarkable.

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:10.840
We are being governed by podcasts.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:13.832
What about people who just want to have information?

01:11:14.032 --> 01:11:15.052
Oh, you're an anti-vaxxer.

01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:15.473
Yeah.

01:11:15.513 --> 01:11:18.955
Well, it's pushed just to scare people into compliance.

01:11:19.135 --> 01:11:20.016
And that's the whole idea.

01:11:20.036 --> 01:11:24.439
But having these pejoratives and throw them around and no one wants to be labeled that.

01:11:24.499 --> 01:11:25.840
So you immediately get scared.

01:11:26.501 --> 01:11:32.685
But enhancing innate immunity and healthy individuals to keep us healthy.

01:11:33.306 --> 01:11:33.426
Yeah.

01:11:34.178 --> 01:11:34.918
How could that be bad?

01:11:35.078 --> 01:11:36.038
That's better.

01:11:36.179 --> 01:11:36.439
Exactly.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:41.380
Well, that's the other problem that I had with the pandemic in general, is that metabolic health was never discussed.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.680
It was always, there's only one way out of this.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:51.262
And having conversations with people that you could see, like visually look at them, does not a metabolically healthy person.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:57.784
And these people are telling you the only way to health is through a medicine that they are financially incentivized to push.

01:11:58.764 --> 01:11:59.745
That's just crazy.

01:11:59.845 --> 01:12:17.800
And when those are the prominent voices that are on television and the media, and you're getting this from politicians, and then on top of that, you've literally have the federal government censoring social media and not allowing people to have dissenting opinions, including people from Harvard and MIT and all the people in the Great Barrington Study.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.003
Why don't we have an open source national database

01:12:21.483 --> 01:12:42.557
showing the protection of vaccines and the risk of not getting one so individuals can make it an open source public database i mean what the hell is he talking about why isn't joe like shut up dude you're an idiot decision right age related all these other factors the data is there

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:48.685
Not making that data available to the public increases distrust.

01:12:49.285 --> 01:12:58.375
And so what the medical community has unfortunately done is they've bred a bunch of dissenters by not giving full access to the information.

01:12:58.695 --> 01:13:14.575
Well, I think that really heightened during the pandemic, because I don't think people had that much of a distrust for vaccines unless they knew someone who was vaccine injured, unless they were gaslit and were told that their child or someone else that had gotten vaccine injured, that that was not the cause of it.

01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:21.857
And those are the people that were very skeptical, and they formed these tight communities, but they were very scared to be open and public about it because they were destroyed.

01:13:22.337 --> 01:13:27.498
You know, I famously remember Jenny McCarthy coming out and saying that she believes her child was vaccine injured.

01:13:28.038 --> 01:13:30.899
And the backlash was spectacular.

01:13:31.259 --> 01:13:32.819
It essentially destroyed her career.

01:13:32.939 --> 01:13:34.320
Well, and it won experiments.

01:13:36.147 --> 01:13:38.770
So Jenny McCarthy is the one we're supposed to worry about.

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:43.394
Next thing you know, he's going to tell us, wow, I mean, one who really suffered is this guy, Andrew Wakefield.

01:13:43.454 --> 01:13:44.155
Holy shit.

01:13:44.755 --> 01:13:46.377
Always like, did it really happen?

01:13:46.477 --> 01:13:52.523
Or was it just a co-occurrence of some other factor that combined with the event of the vaccination?

01:13:52.663 --> 01:13:56.326
I mean, this is where you need to have high population studies, but those studies are available.

01:13:56.987 --> 01:14:00.710
Why they're cloaked in secrecy and why are they not made available?

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:01.211
It's money.

01:14:02.755 --> 01:14:05.497
I mean, the financial interest is astounding.

01:14:05.577 --> 01:14:08.859
The amount of money that's involved in it and the amount of money that they spend every year.

01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:10.701
They spend $8 billion.

01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:18.206
The pharmaceutical drug industry spends $8 billion just on advertising and on propaganda every year.

01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:19.947
That's so much money.

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:24.470
And they spend so much money on television networks.

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:27.932
I mean, how many times has Anderson Cooper brought to you by Pfizer?

01:14:27.972 --> 01:14:31.054
You see these ads and that shapes the narrative, unfortunately.

01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:31.675
It does.

01:14:33.256 --> 01:14:42.970
Let me, again, let's be clear from my point of view, vaccines have done a lot of benefit, but they don't benefit everyone all the time.

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:44.773
Not all vaccines are the same.

01:14:49.756 --> 01:14:58.219
So just like Brett Weinstein, you know, they've done a lot of good, but they've done a lot of good, you know, but they're just all different.

01:14:58.279 --> 01:15:01.241
And, you know, people are different and vaccines are different.

01:15:01.321 --> 01:15:06.783
And James Lyons Weiler knows it's a combination of environmental and holy shit.

01:15:07.645 --> 01:15:19.994
to be able to delineate a thoughtful scientific method with disclosed information that's accessible to everyone so you can make the best judgment for yourself and your family.

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:29.482
that they're gonna just jack up the amount that they give people because there's profit in that, unfortunately.

01:15:29.522 --> 01:15:31.624
And then there are vaccines that are beneficial.

01:15:32.044 --> 01:15:33.225
Let's find out which ones they are.

01:15:33.646 --> 01:15:42.113
What can be mitigated in terms of like, how can you make your overall metabolic health better before you even think about any of these things?

01:15:42.553 --> 01:15:51.101
We know for a fact that during the COVID crisis in particular, the people that had the most problem with it were the people that had comorbidities.

01:15:51.661 --> 01:16:00.387
or people that were obese, people that had all sorts of issues going on because of poor diet, poor lifestyle choices, and even, you know, genetic problems.

01:16:01.067 --> 01:16:08.432
Yeah, one of the immunologists we were working with told me something I didn't know, is that, are you immunocompromised or immunodepressed?

01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:10.453
Vaccines don't work very well.

01:16:11.173 --> 01:16:26.602
So they become those people become ha ha that's also right when you're when you're sick or immunodepressed That's also when you shouldn't get vaccines because then you could really get autism You know, like if you get a vaccine when you have an ear infection, right Suzanne from mutation, right?

01:16:26.642 --> 01:16:32.926
Which is the argument for why you don't give it to children with their babies because their immune system isn't even functional yet Yeah, I'm

01:16:34.086 --> 01:16:37.127
Again, the Hep B one is a pretty clear example.

01:16:37.147 --> 01:16:37.847
That's a nutty one.

01:16:38.388 --> 01:16:39.468
There's a bunch of nutty ones.

01:16:39.488 --> 01:16:41.829
But the point is the vaccine schedule.

01:16:42.549 --> 01:16:50.871
If you look at what we used to take and you look at what happened when they lost their liability during the Reagan administration, all of a sudden the schedule goes way up.

01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:55.753
And they started adding things like Hep B. And then you realize, oh, it's very profitable to do that.

01:16:56.413 --> 01:17:02.315
Imagine how much more money you make if you're injecting everybody with a Hep B vaccine if you sell Hep B vaccines.

01:17:03.095 --> 01:17:04.916
It's just simple mathematics.

01:17:05.336 --> 01:17:10.177
I also have met people in the pharma industry who are extremely well-intended, who are great scientists.

01:17:10.957 --> 01:17:12.957
But the scientists aren't the issue, right?

01:17:12.977 --> 01:17:20.439
They've also confessed to me that they face this humiliation of being ostracized for just asking questions.

01:17:20.479 --> 01:17:22.600
But again, full disclosure.

01:17:23.553 --> 01:17:24.973
Let people make up their own minds.

01:17:25.493 --> 01:17:27.674
What's the cost-benefit ratio?

01:17:28.114 --> 01:17:32.355
No frickin' progress since, like, ever.

01:17:32.535 --> 01:17:32.755
Since 2000.

01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:36.596
No progress at all.

01:17:36.796 --> 01:17:37.336
Nothing.

01:17:37.436 --> 01:17:39.017
Zero, zippo, zilch.

01:17:39.897 --> 01:17:41.617
No progress with these assholes.

01:17:42.117 --> 01:17:47.899
And Joe Rogan certainly hasn't learned anything, because he's not pushing back against this guy at all.

01:17:48.945 --> 01:17:52.028
Is it one out of a million, one out of 10?

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:54.751
You should have to show all the studies too.

01:17:54.891 --> 01:18:04.020
You shouldn't just show the curated studies that you generated specifically with the goal of making an efficacy, like having a result that shows that this is effective.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.063
If you do 10 studies, you should show all 10 studies.

01:18:07.443 --> 01:18:19.233
Yeah, well, actually, that's why clinicaltrials.gov exists, is that we're cherry-picking, doing studies in Bulgaria and India and Taiwan, and the pharma would choose the clinical study that supported their narrative.

01:18:19.253 --> 01:18:20.555
Exactly, exactly.

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:23.898
And then they could use deceptive language to show the efficacy.

01:18:24.378 --> 01:18:29.483
But what I'm getting at is that we have such a reservoir of potential

01:18:30.675 --> 01:18:34.738
ways of supporting immunity in healthy individuals in nature.

01:18:35.118 --> 01:18:35.338
Right.

01:18:35.659 --> 01:18:37.440
That is not pharma based.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.141
That's based on the entourage effect.

01:18:39.862 --> 01:18:44.045
And so when you activate the receptors in your immune system, that's something beneficial.

01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:46.867
I believe there's crosstalk between the receptors.

01:18:47.487 --> 01:18:51.130
The receptors are, oh, something really good is coming down the pipe.

01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:56.874
He believes there's crosstalk between the receptors when something good comes into the system.

01:18:57.354 --> 01:18:58.415
He believes that.

01:19:00.191 --> 01:19:02.976
What in the Sam shithell is this?

01:19:04.158 --> 01:19:05.440
Other than stupid.

01:19:07.116 --> 01:19:09.758
I mean, come on, come on, come on.

01:19:10.499 --> 01:19:12.280
And this is how we got fooled.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.585
This is how we got fooled to solve this Scooby-Doo mystery of the lab leak.

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:22.008
That's how we got fooled into accepting PCR as a standard.

01:19:22.408 --> 01:19:30.215
That's how we got fooled into accepting sequencing as evidence of a phylogenetic tree and evolution of a virus.

01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:36.240
And we got told that there was an evolving virus by people like Devi Sridhar and Kevin McKernan.

01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:40.102
and freaking Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey.

01:19:43.917 --> 01:19:48.141
And they started creating an entrepreneurship factor as a collaboration.

01:19:48.301 --> 01:19:54.086
The only reason why I'm mentioning Kevin McCarron and Charles Rixey is because I kind of assume that they only get paid if I mention them.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:59.670
And so I just don't want to see anything bad happen to their unwitting, participating families.

01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:02.312
And so every once in a while, I leave the slides in.

01:20:02.372 --> 01:20:03.914
Every once in a while, I say their name.

01:20:04.494 --> 01:20:06.896
I understand that nobody knows who they are.

01:20:07.437 --> 01:20:09.779
I understand their biggest moment in the

01:20:10.379 --> 01:20:18.024
in the entire pandemic was when Kevin McKernan mentioned Charles Rixey on that Danny Jones podcast.

01:20:18.084 --> 01:20:20.385
That was like, you know, his moment.

01:20:21.506 --> 01:20:22.927
So, you know, whatever.

01:20:24.261 --> 01:20:29.086
more receptors are activated that have collaterally more benefits.

01:20:29.606 --> 01:20:38.135
And so that goes to the homeostasis and the uplifting of the homeostasis of the immune system that is a higher ready state of being able to respond.

01:20:38.855 --> 01:20:42.539
And then conventional medicine can work better by using conventional medicine.

01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:46.622
Oh, conventional medicine then works better if we do it right.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.604
Oh, boy, is that awesome.

01:20:49.624 --> 01:20:53.266
It's a non-immunocompromised individual asking their immune system to respond.

01:20:53.847 --> 01:20:54.727
It's an uphill battle.

01:20:55.067 --> 01:20:55.368
Right.

01:20:55.668 --> 01:20:55.988
Yeah.

01:20:56.348 --> 01:21:04.253
It's interesting, too, that natural remedies are automatically dismissed by people who think of themselves as intelligent, science-based people.

01:21:04.494 --> 01:21:05.674
Well, look at artemiscin.

01:21:05.835 --> 01:21:10.898
But isn't it weird, though, that we dismiss it, but if you really understand what

01:21:13.191 --> 01:21:14.854
Wow.

01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:14.934
Wow.

01:21:15.555 --> 01:21:16.497
Wow.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:48.892
So we're supposed to believe that these two jackasses, and Jay Bhattacharya, and Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Jessica Rose, and Meryl Nass, and Mary Holland, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., despite paying me for more than a year and a half, really don't understand the idea that on a background of irreducibly complex genetic signals, these shitheads lied to us, and used an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality

01:21:50.447 --> 01:22:08.973
an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality to kind of cue off a sort of bait-and-switch with very simple and ineffective PCR tests to take a background signal and call it spread in order to have an excuse to manage this problem that they saw coming for decades.

01:22:09.413 --> 01:22:13.655
And why not get on that bandwagon and see if you can become Vice President of the United States?

01:22:14.431 --> 01:22:18.614
Because that's exactly what they did with CHD and ICANN and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:18.654 --> 01:22:26.499
And that's the exact reason why Tony Lyons and Del Bigtree were both intimately involved both in his campaign and in the Maha movement now.

01:22:26.559 --> 01:22:28.580
Because it was all one malevolent show.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:38.307
From the very beginning, as described in the Jesse Ventura book from 2018, Do Not Start the Revolution Without Me, in the last part of the book, the epilogue,

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.989
You hear a story about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:41.049 --> 01:22:51.615
running for president as an independent, but then being taken as vice president by the then-leading candidate, Jesse Ventura, who gets shot and makes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:52.876
president of the United States.

01:22:52.916 --> 01:23:03.342
And it sounds like Tony Lyons and Steve Bannon and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Del Bigtree got really close, but not quite, to that story actually happening.

01:23:03.422 --> 01:23:04.203
Isn't that weird?

01:23:05.223 --> 01:23:33.022
Anyway, these same people, who are seemingly unaware of an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that might be available to be sculpted using manslaughter and lies, have also conveniently not been able to assemble a list of best-case scenario for how you got killed in the hospital, and in fact have orchestrated the obfuscation of this easy-to-assemble list by using Grace Yara's dad to fail at exemplifying it.

01:23:34.554 --> 01:23:44.004
And so the 600,000, 700,000 opioid deaths that have occurred in the last six years are being ignored for their contribution to this math.

01:23:44.884 --> 01:23:53.093
The contribution of supplementary oxygen at the beginning of the pandemic for the first two years in orchestrating this rise in pneumonia

01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:57.604
that should have been treated with antibiotics but wasn't because it was viral.

01:23:58.084 --> 01:24:08.648
And the mass illusion around the healthcare world now that there is such a thing as a viral pneumonia that is inappropriate to treat with antibiotics.

01:24:08.688 --> 01:24:16.290
That is a danger that still exists right now because of all these people who have not seen it and dispelled it.

01:24:18.427 --> 01:24:23.729
just like this myth still exists, that racism and viruses can be endemic if you're not careful.

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:26.190
And so we've got to control them both.

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:32.413
And they made this transfection safe, ladies and gentlemen, by just rolling out a bunch of placebo.

01:24:32.433 --> 01:24:44.238
And that's why they have a bunch of ex-pharma executives out there not mentioning that obvious choice from Mike Yeadon to Sasha Latupova to Jonathan Engler to

01:24:45.018 --> 01:24:52.682
All of these people are ex-pharma executives, and if you're using their tests to find their ghosts, then their ghosts are not real, and you are not a Ghostbuster.

01:24:52.722 --> 01:24:54.703
You're a shithead who fell for it.

01:24:55.203 --> 01:24:58.024
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the air conditioner in the background.

01:24:58.064 --> 01:25:00.465
This is for all the marbles, for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:25:00.886 --> 01:25:03.587
It's Friday, but I don't think I'm taking the weekend off.

01:25:04.487 --> 01:25:07.928
We will see how I feel and how things go for the rest of the day.

01:25:07.968 --> 01:25:12.169
If I have a good day at the gym, it's hard for me to imagine I'm going to be taking the weekend off.

01:25:12.889 --> 01:25:14.550
I'm going to take the dogs out.

01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:16.511
I'm going to enjoy some sun.

01:25:16.531 --> 01:25:20.012
I hope this was a suitable broadcast for you.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.112
11 of July, 2025.

01:25:23.272 --> 01:25:28.574
Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget, interoscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:25:29.014 --> 01:25:32.896
Transfection in healthy humans was always dangerous and viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:25:33.356 --> 01:25:35.056
These are the shitheads I'm talking about.

01:25:35.477 --> 01:25:37.157
These people are the scripted liars.

01:25:37.317 --> 01:25:40.739
The scripted liars that have sold us out.

01:25:42.215 --> 01:25:47.298
And these are the people that we need to cancel.

01:25:48.238 --> 01:25:49.239
They need to be canceled.

01:25:49.839 --> 01:25:53.801
They need to be publicly embarrassed and they should be publicly embarrassed for the rest of their life.

01:25:54.361 --> 01:26:01.244
I don't think Byron Bridle is a bad guy, but Byron Bridle is a weak point that he needs to realize how badly they used it.

01:26:01.725 --> 01:26:09.969
Then he needs to realize why Robert Malone went on the Brett Weinstein podcast in the first place was to stand in front of Byron Bridle.

01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:14.471
So if Byram can't wake up soon, then he's on this list as well.

01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:16.452
Maybe you can send this little clip to Byram.

01:26:17.193 --> 01:26:19.294
I still have, I still have hope for him.

01:26:20.935 --> 01:26:26.739
But you know, these people were all on this paper together on May, in 2025, May 30th.

01:26:26.899 --> 01:26:31.581
Robert Malone, Steve Hadfield, Jessica Rose, Harvey Reich, Tess Laurie, and Claire Craig.

01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:34.803
They're all traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:34.983 --> 01:26:35.784
They're all traitors.

01:26:36.954 --> 01:26:38.615
They're all traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:39.935
My name's Jonathan Cui.

01:26:39.955 --> 01:26:41.556
You can find my work on PubMed.

01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:43.997
You can also find my work in the Wuhan cover-up book.

01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:50.861
You can also find, well, send an email to the director of NIH and see if he remembers who I am.

01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:52.822
I also got a couple YouTube channels.

01:26:52.882 --> 01:26:55.623
I'm currently streaming on the first one, JC on a Bike.

01:26:55.663 --> 01:26:56.824
Thank you very much for being here.

01:26:57.665 --> 01:27:01.670
The way this works is that people share this and that gets the word out.

01:27:02.231 --> 01:27:07.759
And the other way it works is that people support the stream by going to GigaOMBiological.com and finding a way to do so.

01:27:08.199 --> 01:27:10.823
If you would do that, that would really help a lot.

01:27:10.883 --> 01:27:11.644
Thank you very much.

01:27:11.664 --> 01:27:12.766
I hate to beg for money.

01:27:13.446 --> 01:27:14.888
But that's the way this works.

01:27:14.928 --> 01:27:29.902
I don't have a lucrative sub stack I don't have anybody paying me except for the people that appreciate this work Thank you very much for being here, and I will see you again soon soon soon probably tomorrow Yeah
