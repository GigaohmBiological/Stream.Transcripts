WEBVTT

01:06.770 --> 01:09.131
It's real.

01:09.811 --> 01:12.152
It's real.

01:12.292 --> 01:14.252
Full speed, Kevin.

01:15.973 --> 01:17.113
Into the wall.

01:17.973 --> 01:18.974
The tunnel I mean.

01:23.935 --> 01:25.575
Sure is a creepy video, isn't it?

01:26.776 --> 01:29.296
This is also a really creepy video actually.

01:29.316 --> 01:33.358
This is a video from the Danny Jones podcast at the end of 2024.

01:36.441 --> 01:40.805
and it is an interview with a guy by the name of Kevin McKernan.

01:41.646 --> 01:47.512
And I think it's really relevant to our discussion and to my sort of plea for help.

01:48.833 --> 01:55.440
I kind of self-deprecatingly wear this jacket that says USA Basketball.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.122
I really

01:58.143 --> 02:00.384
I really feel like America is under attack.

02:01.364 --> 02:06.387
We are being sabotaged from within with help from people all around the world.

02:06.987 --> 02:14.670
A lot of the people that are helping these people are in Five Eyes countries, but not all of them, unless South Africa is a Five Eyes country.

02:16.631 --> 02:19.052
And I'm worried for the future of my country.

02:19.132 --> 02:25.735
I need help from my fellow countrymen, whether you wear a blue baseball cap or a red baseball cap.

02:26.768 --> 02:29.730
or no baseball cap and a cowboy hat.

02:30.450 --> 02:37.333
I need more Americans to understand the problem with what this video represents.

02:37.493 --> 02:43.676
It is as close to an admission as we're ever going to get that we are being subverted.

02:44.617 --> 02:55.222
And I know that's an absolutely spectacularly bold statement for me to make, but I feel like everything's on the line and has been on the line for a very long time for the five people in this house.

02:56.529 --> 02:57.830
More than ever right now.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.550
It is on the line for us.

02:59.670 --> 03:20.577
We have only 111 Active subscribers to our send out and we have a few Subscribers to substack and that's really about it if we didn't have a couple people that regularly gave us a bigger than average donation we this would have ended a long time ago in some way or another and

03:21.997 --> 03:31.743
And not that I would stop saying what I need to say, but this stream is only going to become stronger if it can find the support to do it.

03:31.883 --> 03:47.213
And it's really important, I think, to understand the significance of this video, the significance of this man, the significance of his claims, the significance of his timeline, the significance of the people that he has interacted with, including myself,

03:48.126 --> 03:52.049
and how that interaction has changed over the course of the COVID pandemic.

03:52.909 --> 04:08.800
Because all of that well-documented history between myself and this gentleman intersects directly with a book written by the United States Health and Human Services Secretary.

04:10.801 --> 04:16.585
And that intersection somehow or another reveals that this guy

04:18.365 --> 04:19.606
is somehow a liar.

04:20.266 --> 04:21.527
And I don't know why.

04:21.847 --> 04:41.318
I don't know why Kevin McKernan is going on podcasts and lying seemingly from 2020, but certainly at the end of 2024, he lied several times on this podcast or someone told him and he believed these lies.

04:42.039 --> 04:47.142
It's possible, I guess, that Kevin McKernan is just, you know, given a script and he reads it.

04:47.862 --> 05:14.725
It's possible, but given his family history, given his career history, and given his history during the pandemic, his podcast history during the pandemic, it is extremely dubious to assume that this guy is just some dude who works on pot genomes and who's now, you know, kind of burning his career trying to warn people about

05:15.583 --> 05:20.366
the DNA plasmid that is still present in these shots.

05:21.487 --> 05:41.779
In this video, this man who purports to be a whistleblower, who CHD has promoted, who Robert F. Kennedy has promoted, who Mary Holland has promoted, who Brian Hooker has promoted, and who Senator Ron Johnson has put in front of a Senate committee to testify about this contamination,

05:43.021 --> 05:48.626
went on the Danny Jones podcast at the end of 2024 and lied in the following ways.

05:48.746 --> 05:54.691
First of all, he said that Barrick taught the Chinese how to make coronavirus.

05:54.731 --> 06:00.416
This is a ridiculous lie because what he's talking about is making infectious clones.

06:00.476 --> 06:01.938
And those are really easy to make.

06:01.998 --> 06:06.842
Those are just sequences that you get commercially made and you order them.

06:08.251 --> 06:27.376
Maybe you need to use some very basic ligation techniques in order to assemble those, but the suggestion that Barrick somehow gave them the recipe to make cake is ridiculous because the essential thing that they do is they make a lot of pure DNA and then they use it.

06:29.076 --> 06:31.557
They transform things, they transfect things.

06:33.049 --> 06:39.935
They can transfect things or transform things using that DNA, or they can convert it to RNA and then do the same, transfect things.

06:41.196 --> 06:45.720
That is not virology, but that is molecular biology.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.464
That is what these people represent as virology, and he knows that.

06:52.677 --> 06:54.738
And so Ralph Baric knows that too.

06:55.358 --> 06:56.978
Tony Fauci understands that.

06:57.018 --> 07:08.542
That's one of the primary illusions here, that the experiments where they send around this clone of SARS Urbani, those are supposed to be virology experiments.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.042
Those aren't virology experiments.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.563
Those are transfection experiments.

07:12.063 --> 07:19.045
Golden Gate Assembly, when he says it, is an admission that Baric's no-see-um technique is just nonsense.

07:19.665 --> 07:23.329
So they made a big deal about Barrick calling it no-see-um.

07:23.389 --> 07:25.692
But it's not Barrick's little tricks.

07:26.252 --> 07:33.180
It's tricks that molecular biology companies that have been pimping restriction enzymes for years invented.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.542
And he would know that because he

07:36.323 --> 07:41.689
invented some of these technologies, found some of these technologies, or the precursors to them.

07:41.750 --> 07:51.961
And certainly, the ubiquitous use of the suite of restriction enzymes that are available is known to anybody on any academic bench.

07:51.982 --> 07:56.407
You just go look up, what restriction enzyme do I need to cut here?

07:59.266 --> 08:06.234
And so this is an admission that this no-see-em thing is nonsense if he says Golden Gate Assembly in the same couple sentences.

08:06.775 --> 08:15.926
Rixey was fired from CHD and the writing of the book, as far as I know, because it happened live over a weekend,

08:16.847 --> 08:30.094
because he brought a guy by the name of Kevin McCairn into a private manuscript meeting that was supposed to be, you know, it's a, it's a book that's being written by a guy who's running for president.

08:30.114 --> 08:37.318
So I guess we should try to kind of keep it secret and not have some random Englishman from Japan in my hotel room, but he did.

08:37.879 --> 08:40.320
And then instead of communicating with the book staff,

08:42.011 --> 08:46.813
just ignored them for two days, streamed with that same fella, and so they fired him.

08:49.975 --> 08:52.856
But he is going to tell a different story in this chat.

08:52.896 --> 08:57.518
So Rixey is a former Marine turned shoe salesman who worked for Seaburn.

08:58.712 --> 09:06.375
and tried to get me to rejoin Drastic in 2021 that culminated in January of 2022, him coming to my house.

09:07.356 --> 09:16.700
About two or three weeks after this guy was on my stream and I interviewed him about the, you know, I guess the PCR and the, he just blew me away.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.189
The diffuse proposal had no evaluation.

09:20.249 --> 09:27.834
So he's going to say that the diffuse proposal was, you know, they, they rejected it because they were like, something's going to leak from this, but they didn't get any evaluation like that.

09:28.515 --> 09:33.278
And they, at best, the proposal was found on a database and not funded.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.100
We don't even know if it got evaluated.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.181
So that's, that's a lie.

09:37.130 --> 09:44.732
The defuse proposal as being done is actually really interesting because that's one of my six quotes in the Wuhan book.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.113
There's only six quotes of me in this book.

09:47.213 --> 09:52.775
I don't think there are any quotes from McKernan or Rixey, but there are six quotes of me in this book.

09:52.835 --> 10:02.358
And one of them is actually what he says exactly word for word right here in this interview, as though he's just explaining it, which is an odd coincidence.

10:03.574 --> 10:23.229
Finally, the whole argument that he makes is based on the idea that we have to accept the exact sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that was reported by Wuhan or reported by whoever or leaked by whoever as real and worth debating, worth talking about the consequences of that sequence.

10:23.650 --> 10:26.632
You must accept this or this whole argument falls apart.

10:28.328 --> 10:50.521
And finally, just recall that James Lyons Wyler, the author of the 2016 Skyhorse publishing book, The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism, was the first guy that I could verify in January 2020 that had any knowledge about what this specific molecular details like a fear and cleavage site or something like that.

10:50.561 --> 10:53.383
He's the earliest one, this guy, the earliest one.

10:55.325 --> 11:03.311
And he was cited by Dan Serotkin, who was actually the guy's blog who got me started in this, you know, searching down the mystery virus thing.

11:04.291 --> 11:09.695
And so knowing all of this, let's just listen to him tell this amazing tale.

11:15.202 --> 11:19.168
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

11:19.709 --> 11:20.130
Taught who?

11:20.871 --> 11:22.073
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

11:22.614 --> 11:30.105
So there were grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV, because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

11:30.906 --> 11:31.546
Obama did that, right?

11:31.566 --> 11:32.127
Obama did that.

11:32.187 --> 11:43.311
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

11:43.351 --> 11:45.452
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

11:45.492 --> 11:46.792
It's going through some intermediary.

11:47.692 --> 11:59.517
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

12:00.618 --> 12:04.701
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

12:05.923 --> 12:10.587
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it, necessarily, from a laboratory.

12:11.428 --> 12:17.554
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

12:18.174 --> 12:21.617
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

12:21.718 --> 12:25.221
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

12:26.104 --> 12:31.464
And Charles Rixey's a marine and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

12:32.495 --> 12:35.136
And he was the one who leaked the diffuse proposal.

12:35.376 --> 12:36.856
Are you familiar with the diffuse proposal?

12:36.876 --> 12:37.476
No, what is that?

12:37.656 --> 12:50.619
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DOD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of we need to build a vaccine against this because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

12:51.119 --> 12:53.959
And the DOD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.200
You'll have something to leak from this.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.701
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

13:02.321 --> 13:04.402
I've got like $30 million in grants from NIH.

13:04.782 --> 13:07.243
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

13:07.743 --> 13:11.664
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

13:12.805 --> 13:15.606
Let's just make sure you verify this here.

13:15.626 --> 13:16.626
We're going to look in the book.

13:18.687 --> 13:22.008
It's in the index too, so you can find this yourself if you happen to own a book.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.489
If you want a copy of it, you just let me know.

13:25.859 --> 13:41.240
And I'll get a copy and get it off of Amazon and sign it for you, and then send it to you I can I can arrange that This is on page 310 of the Wuhan cover-up, and it says Jonathan dr. Jonathan Cooley similarly observes mm-hmm

13:45.724 --> 13:49.505
The fact that Fauci and NIH turned down DASAC's proposal is irrelevant.

13:49.525 --> 13:54.606
The proposal itself is evidence that work may have already been done, and that's how modern research is conducted and funded.

13:54.626 --> 14:08.709
The government's official claim that a rejected DASAC's proposal makes for a convenient public denial that the work was never done, and this probably was sufficient reassurance for 90% of the curious population, but since most people don't understand the grant-making progress,

14:10.703 --> 14:15.946
But any working scientist will view this narrative with skepticism.

14:18.347 --> 14:36.316
Okay, so of course later on I became aware of sort of the biology that made me firmly doubt this idea that the diffuse proposal could be evidence of something and instead what made much more

14:37.518 --> 14:43.359
logical sense was this was like a doubling down on the lab leak narrative that I had already rejected.

14:44.100 --> 15:01.004
Now what I'm suggesting here is that the diffuse proposal was actually leaked kind of by Rixie and Rixie definitely tried to use the diffuse proposal to convince me to consider myself part of drastic again.

15:01.883 --> 15:19.956
It's really quite remarkable that about two or three weeks after I interviewed Kevin McKernan on my stream for the first time in 2021, at the end of 2021, in January of 2022, Charles Rixey came to my house and streamed with me.

15:20.096 --> 15:23.959
And it is that stream that supposedly Robert Malone

15:24.719 --> 15:53.386
told bobby kennedy he had to watch and that is the reason why bobby kennedy hired him me to help with this book and ricksy to help with this book think about how weird this is and so i i can't stress enough how how important it is to see that these are all it's all one malevolent show it's all one coordinated

15:54.352 --> 16:12.157
network of liars that pings people off of one another and bounces people around between trust and not trust and skepticism and not skepticism and they pretend that they're working with you but in reality they're just making sure that you do a U-turn every time you start to make progress.

16:13.298 --> 16:18.259
And yes, I am accusing Kevin McKernan of being one of the worst of those people.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.621
Absolutely to the extent to which that he plays a central role

16:24.597 --> 16:34.513
in the proper, successful execution of the fake pandemic which allowed PCR to become an accepted diagnostic.

16:36.559 --> 16:42.482
and transfection to become an accepted form of vaccination, which is just absolutely criminal.

16:43.002 --> 16:48.185
And it was primarily coordinated by Robert Malone and, and Kevin McKernan.

16:48.265 --> 17:01.091
Now he's going to continue here after he talks about, uh, or, or tries to sort of absorb the thing that I said in this book and try to make it seem like, you know, that's what, what Rixey helped with the book, right?

17:01.511 --> 17:02.152
You just can't.

17:02.172 --> 17:09.058
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows we can get Xed on.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.359
We've demonstrated this piece.

17:10.379 --> 17:11.520
We've demonstrated this piece.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.341
Now we just need to do this last piece.

17:14.602 --> 17:20.628
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

17:20.788 --> 17:23.930
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

17:25.272 --> 17:28.735
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

17:29.355 --> 17:39.145
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain letters.

17:39.805 --> 17:40.906
Those are what restrictions are.

17:41.066 --> 17:42.968
So imagine you could only cut and paste where there's a the.

17:43.809 --> 17:50.035
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

17:50.556 --> 17:53.038
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe,

17:54.079 --> 18:12.970
Now the next thing to remember, of course, is that the same guy that got Rixey fired, McCairn, is somebody that I met as early as February of 2020 on five consecutive weekend streams with two people who are intimately associated with George Webb.

18:14.111 --> 18:19.654
George Webb has got to be some kind of, I don't know, FBI clown,

18:20.655 --> 18:24.917
Um, I don't know who George Webb is, but I do know that he is a fake person.

18:25.917 --> 18:33.340
And George Webb was put on 60 minutes, uh, in February of 2020, because he's a fake person.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.722
And he was promoting Paul Cuttrell for more than three years.

18:37.822 --> 18:49.106
Paul Cuttrell is also a fake person who Robert Malone also interviewed with despite Paul Cuttrell being a fake person and later saying that he was suing George Webb.

18:51.977 --> 18:55.780
This is all one group of people.

18:57.201 --> 19:04.446
It's very, very hard for me to stress how important it is to see that they are all one group.

19:04.906 --> 19:08.529
And so if you think that you can sort through this, you are mistaken.

19:09.730 --> 19:11.051
You cannot sort through this.

19:12.779 --> 19:14.020
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.221
cannot sort through this.

19:15.562 --> 19:17.263
Mike Eden can't sort through this.

19:17.824 --> 19:25.471
None of these people can sort through this until we figure out what is the group of people here who is coordinating their lying.

19:26.260 --> 19:43.258
who has avoided consistently the scrutiny of the PCR, avoided consistently scrutiny of the transfection as transfection until it was way too late, and have avoided scrutinizing the expected rise in all-cause mortality.

19:44.392 --> 19:59.025
the opioid crisis and its contribution to the falling life expectancy, specifically in America, and instead have focused on the novel virus, the spike protein, in order to hide the expected damage from transfection.

20:00.026 --> 20:08.994
That's why somebody from the Human Genome Project, somebody from the 100,000 Genomes Project, somebody from DITRA and from

20:10.191 --> 20:24.221
the WHO and from CEPI and from all these other things that he's worked for and advised, from Anthrax Merrill, the primary advisor, scientific advisor behind CHD, besides Brian Hooker.

20:25.302 --> 20:32.868
It's really remarkable, ladies and gentlemen, but once you see that it only takes a few of these people at the center

20:34.178 --> 20:36.499
And everybody else can just have ulterior motives.

20:36.559 --> 20:38.360
Everybody else can just have bills to pay.

20:38.440 --> 20:46.225
Everybody else can just not be sophisticated enough and really just interested in being a newswoman or being the next Joe Rogan in the UK.

20:49.446 --> 21:02.894
What I find quite remarkable is this particular guy, the guy that I met at the beginning of 2020 and interacted with for the last six years, is still working almost exclusively

21:03.874 --> 21:05.674
Half of his content is about me.

21:07.395 --> 21:23.939
And he has done now two live streams with the ironically named Steve Kirsch Vaccine Safety Research Council, or Research Foundation, Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.

21:24.899 --> 21:29.681
This guy has had this guy on twice now, one time with Kevin McKernan.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.022
It's probably not for nothing that they chose that guy.

21:34.342 --> 21:36.223
McCann, McKernan, get them all mixed up.

21:36.924 --> 21:42.308
They presented to an Australian, you know, health freedom group.

21:44.029 --> 21:57.940
So this guy, and this guy, and this guy, and that guy, and this guy, and that guy, and that dude, and that guy, and this lady, and that one, and that one, and that one, they're all in on it.

21:59.226 --> 22:00.146
They're all in on it.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.327
That's why I have selfies with all of them.

22:02.807 --> 22:04.408
They've all told me they're great.

22:04.508 --> 22:05.769
Some of them, I'm great.

22:05.849 --> 22:14.472
Some of them have given me little love notes with their private messages and their telegram group and their private phone number that they never answer.

22:15.612 --> 22:19.994
Shoot, Steve Kirsch has even left me voicemails a few times over the last five years.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.916
These people are malevolent players.

22:25.967 --> 22:33.975
that are trying to enslave our grandchildren, trying to take advantage of the dying dollar, get theirs while they're getting is still possible.

22:36.177 --> 22:39.461
Because they know that if they didn't do this job, somebody else would do it.

22:39.501 --> 22:42.604
You don't think they could have replaced Pierre Kory with a hundred other doctors?

22:45.487 --> 22:47.209
You don't think, I mean, come on.

22:57.934 --> 23:00.896
Six years back, I asked one question and I never got an answer from anyone.

23:00.936 --> 23:03.397
Do you know anyone that died from COVID?

23:03.477 --> 23:07.299
It's the fog of antibodies war and the procrastination of the fall of the toilet.

23:07.339 --> 23:08.899
You're getting pooped up in the arse.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.501
I don't know what that means, dude.

23:12.081 --> 23:15.342
From where I'm sitting, there's a whole bunch of COVID brain going around.

23:15.362 --> 23:18.644
Do I know anyone that died from COVID?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.264
The problem is that my sample set is skewed.

23:23.806 --> 23:25.107
Now this is important, right?

23:25.148 --> 23:34.577
Because what I'm showing you here, I probably shouldn't show you, but I'm afraid that if I don't at least mention him every once in a while, he might stop getting paid.

23:35.398 --> 23:39.642
So for the sake of his kids and for his family, I thought I would show that.

23:39.682 --> 23:43.926
But let me go back to it for a second because I just want to point out what you see here.

23:44.867 --> 23:58.257
At the end of this stream, while he's, you know, ragging on me and making fun of the fact that I guess I'm going to commit suicide at 9-11-2025, he's reading this chat, which says, six years back, I asked one question.

23:58.798 --> 24:00.399
I never got an answer from anyone.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.500
Do you know anyone that died of COVID?

24:03.721 --> 24:09.666
It's the fog of antibodies war and procrastination of the fall of the dollar.

24:11.107 --> 24:14.728
you're getting, you know, whatever up the arse, he says here.

24:15.428 --> 24:19.529
So he reads that out loud and he says, I don't know what that means.

24:19.629 --> 24:40.534
Now, curiously, I said almost exactly this in July of 2020, when I said that the background was being misconstrued as spread and that these people are probably just lying to us in order to extract the last amount of value out of America as the dollar collapses.

24:44.212 --> 24:58.773
That guy has been on Steve Kirsch's Vaccine Safety Research Foundation podcast twice, once with Kevin McKernan, former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project at its beginning.

25:02.523 --> 25:05.845
Ladies and gentlemen, this is gigalombiological.com.

25:05.865 --> 25:06.625
That's my website.

25:06.645 --> 25:10.047
You can go there and find a way to help support this stream if you think it's worthwhile.

25:10.988 --> 25:17.231
We are at a crucial moment right now where this message will not be repeated by anyone else.

25:17.332 --> 25:20.233
This information is not held by anyone else.

25:20.313 --> 25:21.734
Nobody else is reading these books.

25:22.374 --> 25:26.357
No one else is trying to put this together so that we can understand this background

25:27.077 --> 25:34.280
and explain to our grandkids and our children how much lying has gone on for the last 20 years.

25:34.820 --> 25:39.582
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to share this work, share it from stream.gigaom.bio if you don't mind.

25:40.022 --> 25:50.866
This weekend, we're going to try to do a stream exclusively on my own platform, just to see how it goes, to see how many people show up, to see if it can handle 50 people, if 50 people show up.

25:52.667 --> 26:16.927
I won't tell you any more about that, but that'll be tomorrow and we do have a soapbox I'm not always there, but I try to be there and check in there Don't feel bad if I'm not there because you know, you can always send an email and my my wife is a very good filter If you send a bunch of nonsense, she probably won't forward it to me But if you just you know, give me a link or say hi or whatever it'll get through and I'll hear from you and then we'll have direct contact and

26:18.228 --> 26:27.558
if you want to send anything to us, or if you want to get, if you want to get,

26:28.277 --> 26:30.820
I got a lot still because nobody cares.

26:31.301 --> 26:31.521
Right?

26:31.581 --> 26:32.061
Nobody cares.

26:32.442 --> 26:34.444
If you want to get stickers for your car, these are clear.

26:35.325 --> 26:36.106
Or your water bottle.

26:36.126 --> 26:40.231
Or if you want to get a velcro thing if you're a tactical kind of guy like I used to be.

26:41.132 --> 26:47.599
Then send a self address stamped envelope to the address right here behind me in the lower, that would be I guess.

26:48.320 --> 26:48.980
Is that the left?

26:49.421 --> 26:52.662
Yeah, lower left of the screen there, JJ Cooey at P.O.

26:52.702 --> 26:56.364
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.207
It's a very interesting place we're in right now.

27:00.227 --> 27:13.394
I have to tell you, I've been a liaison to ACIP for nearly two decades, and I'm so impressed and reassured by the multiple ways CDC and FDA work together to monitor vaccine safety.

27:14.537 --> 27:17.241
Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast.

27:17.842 --> 27:31.120
After postponing a meeting in February, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recently met for two days and voted in favor of new recommendations for three vaccines.

27:31.761 --> 27:40.553
And here with us today to share all those details is the AMA's liaison to the ACIP, Dr. Sandra Fryhofer in Atlanta.

27:40.973 --> 27:44.217
I'm Todd Unger, AMA's Chief Experience Officer in Chicago.

27:44.798 --> 27:46.781
Dr. Fryhofer, it's so good to have you back.

27:48.102 --> 27:49.805
Well, thanks for having me back, Todd.

27:50.558 --> 27:52.499
Well, I want to begin with some logistics.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.942
As I mentioned, this meeting was originally set for February.

27:56.142 --> 28:00.645
You know, I really wish GigaOM Biological had a chief experience officer, but we don't.

28:00.785 --> 28:02.486
So you're just stuck with me.

28:03.727 --> 28:04.668
So it's funny, right?

28:04.728 --> 28:09.431
This is going to be a story about the management of the population pyramid.

28:09.531 --> 28:10.532
Anybody that's sick

28:11.132 --> 28:17.854
or it's got advanced, you know, multiple conditions, you know, you probably should get a number of these shots because, you know, you never know.

28:17.934 --> 28:23.315
I mean, if we can't see anything in your seroprevalence, so then just to be sure you better get a booster.

28:23.395 --> 28:24.355
Let's listen to this one.

28:24.775 --> 28:24.855
Yeah.

28:24.895 --> 28:30.857
And then it was postponed, but there was a little confusion about when and if this particular meeting would occur.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.437
Can you give us a little bit of background there?

28:34.224 --> 28:44.947
Sure, the dates of these public meetings are usually set years in advance, and physicians and public health people from all over the country and the world look forward to them.

28:45.428 --> 28:53.810
So when the ACIP's three-day meeting, which was set for the end of February, was suddenly canceled, it was quite concerning.

28:54.370 --> 29:01.533
After all, this would have been the first ACIP meeting under this new administration and with a new HHS director.

29:02.273 --> 29:12.683
Mr. Kennedy's previous views and actions have been somewhat anti-vaccine, which made it even a little more concerning and lead us to say the scientific community was sort of up in arms.

29:13.184 --> 29:21.372
In fact, AMA, along with a bunch of other organizations, signed on to a letter to preserve the ACIP meeting, and it worked.

29:21.932 --> 29:25.013
The February meeting was rescheduled to April.

29:25.494 --> 29:30.316
The formerly scheduled three-day meeting was compressed into two very full days.

29:30.776 --> 29:32.257
There were only three votes.

29:32.737 --> 29:36.178
A previously scheduled vote on flu vaccination was not included.

29:36.198 --> 29:41.701
All right, now you've been an ACIP liaison for almost 20 years.

29:42.421 --> 29:46.043
Was there anything about this particular meeting that was new or different?

29:46.123 --> 29:48.884
I heard there was a new orientation for one.

29:50.362 --> 29:59.888
Yes, this was the first time we'd ever had an orientation meeting for liaisons, but it was a really good idea, especially for people that were new to being a liaison.

30:00.389 --> 30:04.872
They had it the day before the meeting started and it sort of level set expectations.

30:05.292 --> 30:13.497
They talked about the history of ACIP, how it was established in 1964 and was designated a federal advisory committee in 1972.

30:13.658 --> 30:20.062
Its role is to provide advice and guidance to the CDC director on the most

30:20.502 --> 30:27.624
I'm laughing because Jason in the chat says, people who vote in favor of vaccines should immediately receive those vaccines.

30:27.664 --> 30:29.664
And I find that really remarkably funny.

30:29.724 --> 30:30.104
Thank you.

30:30.444 --> 30:33.425
Active means to prevent vaccine preventable diseases.

30:33.965 --> 30:40.907
They also explained the evidence-based process ACIP uses in making its vaccine recommendations.

30:41.267 --> 30:45.568
It's called the Evidence to Recommendations Framework or ETR.

30:46.568 --> 30:54.393
At the orientation meeting, they also said that the people that usually help with the broadcast had been let go and warned there could be some technical difficulties.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.373
And I thought, oh, no.

30:56.194 --> 31:01.957
But the remaining staff was able to pull it off with only a few minor technical problems.

31:02.598 --> 31:04.079
It was a really good meeting.

31:04.639 --> 31:05.880
And Dr. Melinda Ward.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.561
Did you hear the emotion in that?

31:08.041 --> 31:09.842
It was a really good meeting.

31:12.564 --> 31:20.385
who is ACIP's Executive Secretary, and Stephanie Thomas, ACIP's Committee Management Specialist, are really amazing.

31:20.965 --> 31:24.766
We also heard some great presentations from CDC staff and others.

31:25.406 --> 31:30.427
Now, I think there was some concern about maybe public comment being eliminated.

31:30.527 --> 31:31.387
What happened there?

31:32.287 --> 31:35.588
Well, we've always had time for oral public comment at these meetings.

31:36.168 --> 31:39.609
I made a comment at an AICP meeting once.

31:39.629 --> 31:40.949
Should I play that one right now?

31:42.671 --> 31:44.154
Let me see if I can find it really quick.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.316
I think it's on Peertube.

31:45.716 --> 31:46.758
I have it in the Batcave.

31:46.838 --> 31:50.344
So let's look at that for a second just because it's fun.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.590
I'm gonna swing this up over here behind me.

31:56.144 --> 32:00.966
So if you go to gigaohm biological, this is stream.gigaohm.bio, you see that?

32:01.006 --> 32:08.470
This is my website that actually I pay for, but Mark also pitches in, Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS.

32:08.510 --> 32:12.732
And that's why if you go to channels, I think this is open to my account right now.

32:12.852 --> 32:16.054
So certain things won't show up unless I go to the homepage.

32:16.094 --> 32:18.015
So I'm gonna go to the homepage and see if that works.

32:18.055 --> 32:24.678
And if you go to the homepage, which is just again, stream.gigaohm.bio slash home, you can see that up there on the top, I think.

32:26.439 --> 32:35.842
You can click and you will find this is where the live stream will be tomorrow and only there This is where Jeff from Earth Jeff from Earth is also in the chat.

32:35.862 --> 32:39.043
Yo, yo, yo This is where his clips channel is.

32:39.143 --> 32:53.868
I've used one of them like six times today on X about the Neat experiment that either side could have proposed If you go down farther though, you will find the bat cave and the bat caves cool because sometimes you just have

32:54.528 --> 32:59.830
recordings that you want to, you know, put up here, but you don't want to do a show about it, you want people to be able to look at it.

32:59.850 --> 33:03.751
So this is where I've got the ACIP meeting one, that's this one right here.

33:08.833 --> 33:13.474
Our first public comment speaker is Mr. Jonathan Cooley.

33:15.655 --> 33:16.455
Hello, can you hear me?

33:16.475 --> 33:18.316
We can, please go ahead.

33:18.823 --> 33:19.183
Thank you.

33:19.244 --> 33:22.006
My name is Jonathan Cooley, and I have no conflicts of interest.

33:22.407 --> 33:27.592
The ethical principle of informed consent has been effectively ignored for the duration of the pandemic.

33:28.293 --> 33:41.447
The FDA and the CDC long ago failed to meet their responsibility to ensure informed consent in those healthy adults who have been already transfected, most egregiously in the healthy college students and teens for whom there was never an emergency.

33:42.239 --> 33:52.302
The CDC and FDA failed again just days ago to provide the opportunity for informed consent, this time for parents of children under five when recommending transfection as safe and effective.

33:52.882 --> 34:06.766
After nearly two years of calling transfection by lipid nanoparticle an investigative vaccine, you have failed to provide informed consent by pushing a false equivalence between transfection and traditional live attenuated and recombinant vaccines.

34:07.287 --> 34:25.124
You have failed to inform the public that transfection, the expression of a viral protein by injection of synthetic RNA, is a highly variable and tissue-dependent process that we are unsure can provoke meaningful immune memory, the goal of any vaccination.

34:25.624 --> 34:32.831
You have failed to notify the public of the potential for autoimmunity while also failing to look for this known downside of this technique.

34:33.550 --> 34:39.434
The FDA have no data to support recommending transfection for any healthy human in 2022.

34:40.075 --> 34:47.400
After more than two years, you have failed to inform the public that you know the studies upon which these recommendations are based are woefully underpowered.

34:48.041 --> 34:54.245
In place of informed consent, you have pushed the vague concepts of safe and effective until they were devoid of meaning.

34:54.706 --> 35:02.952
The studies used to specifically recommend transfection to the under five age group are statistical jokes without clinically meaningful endpoints.

35:03.436 --> 35:07.179
You know immunobridging to non-inferiority is useless.

35:07.299 --> 35:08.280
Do your job.

35:08.800 --> 35:23.531
Of course, the CDC, NIH, and NIAID also failed to inform the public that they knew late in 2019 that the virus had already several key molecular aspects that indicated both its origin and the many known countermeasures that would be expected to work.

35:24.112 --> 35:25.893
Instead, they said they knew nothing.

35:25.953 --> 35:31.157
They could see nothing unusual, and that our immune systems were equally vulnerable, and you ran with it.

35:31.664 --> 35:40.830
Data from your own presentations demonstrate the vast majority of kids have been infected, a primary counterindication for the administration of any vaccine before 2020.

35:42.372 --> 35:48.596
You are pushing products under the guise of a regulatory framework that we know by your actions is proforma only.

35:49.156 --> 36:00.264
You failed to inform the public that you know from studying influenza and other viruses that the developing immune system is an impossibly complicated process that involves imprinting mechanisms that cannot be reversed.

36:00.874 --> 36:08.920
The catalog of molecular immune memories that protects us for a lifetime has formed through the countless exposures of pathogens in our childhood.

36:08.940 --> 36:17.287
And you have failed to inform the public that you know that transfection to a 2020 viral code protein cannot be useful in augmenting this process.

36:17.807 --> 36:23.212
You know it will not meaningfully protect these children because there's a planet worth of data informing you of this.

36:23.952 --> 36:24.853
It's biology.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.155
Please get some and then do your job.

36:29.673 --> 36:33.555
It's biology, please get some and then do your job.

36:34.155 --> 36:38.477
That's what I said in 2022 while all these people ignored me.

36:38.517 --> 36:47.660
That was when I had presented to Panda a couple times already before I realized that Nick Hudson was a traitor and would lose all of those presentations.

36:48.580 --> 36:54.668
slowly, you know, take whatever ideas he and Jonathan Engler could and write their own substacks about them.

36:54.708 --> 37:05.462
It's really gross what's happened over these last five years, but it's also really obvious once you see it and have it thrown in your face, and it's just irrefutable.

37:05.925 --> 37:09.468
Members of the public could also submit written public comments as well.

37:10.369 --> 37:14.172
There was concern that this public comment could be eliminated, and here's why.

37:14.912 --> 37:22.939
Back in February, HHS posted in the Federal Register plans to end public comment on agency actions.

37:23.779 --> 37:31.185
This essentially would eliminate public participation and comment in policy proposals and decisions

37:32.048 --> 37:35.370
And the policy of- I guess I got it in right before the close, huh?

37:35.390 --> 37:36.070
That's pretty good.

37:36.090 --> 37:40.973
Soliciting public comment and feedback on proposals had been business as usual since 1971.

37:41.813 --> 37:46.796
This is when former Health Secretary Richardson began this practice.

37:47.036 --> 37:49.357
It's now referred to as the Richardson Waiver.

37:49.877 --> 37:58.802
Now, prior to the Richardson Waiver, this type of public input had been previously excluded under the Administrative Procedure Act.

37:59.582 --> 38:03.406
Patient advocacy groups issued a sign-on letter opposing this decision.

38:04.027 --> 38:09.293
And fortunately, public comment was allowed at this meeting, and it was very informative.

38:10.074 --> 38:11.716
Public comment is important.

38:12.236 --> 38:15.340
People need to have a way to voice their opinions and be heard.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.883
Now, there's a new CDC director.

38:17.903 --> 38:18.984
Was she involved in the meeting?

38:20.370 --> 38:27.012
Well, oftentimes at the first ACIP meeting of the year, we hear from the CDC director, particularly when the director is new.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.372
And I was disappointed we did not.

38:29.472 --> 38:36.114
But then I realized that the new director, Dr. Susan Monterrez, has been named, but not yet confirmed.

38:36.454 --> 38:40.735
And she's actually the first CDC director to have to go through Senate confirmation.

38:41.155 --> 38:49.277
But effective January 23, 2025, she was made both principal deputy CDC director and acting CDC director

38:49.817 --> 38:54.480
But since she hasn't been confirmed by the Senate, I guess things are sort of in limbo right now.

38:55.140 --> 39:00.623
But Dr. Monterrez holds a PhD in both microbiology and immunology.

39:01.063 --> 39:07.306
She's a health scientist with more than 20 years of experience in health innovation, but she's not an MD.

39:08.147 --> 39:12.989
I'm looking forward to hearing from her, to meeting with her and working with her.

39:14.290 --> 39:16.171
Was there anything else different about the meeting?

39:17.208 --> 39:17.608
Yes.

39:18.529 --> 39:35.762
Usually on the second day of the meeting, we hear reports from agencies like CDC, CMS, FDA, HRSA, NIH, as well as IHS, the Indian Health Service, and OIDP, the Office of Infectious Disease, HIV, AIDS Policy.

39:36.302 --> 39:39.165
They're usually really interesting and forward thinking.

39:39.185 --> 39:43.268
Yeah, you can put like an iPad as a teleprompter at this stage.

39:43.308 --> 39:43.848
It's not hard.

39:43.888 --> 39:44.989
It could be a cell phone even.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.712
That didn't happen at this meeting, and it was quite disappointing.

39:48.793 --> 39:54.258
But who knows who's left after all the DOJ-directed cuts over just the last few weeks.

39:55.098 --> 39:56.820
I'm just so glad we got through this meeting.

39:57.140 --> 40:01.625
There were some important votes, and there's a lot to be done at our upcoming meeting in June.

40:02.125 --> 40:04.226
Well, let's get into some of the detail.

40:04.286 --> 40:07.789
For sure, she's reading and you can see it very clearly.

40:07.889 --> 40:08.849
It's tough.

40:10.250 --> 40:18.856
I think I've watched my streams back and often found myself when I'm not looking exactly at the middle of the lens, it looks like you're cross-eyed.

40:19.436 --> 40:27.061
And so if you find yourself talking and talking, it's a little weird habit to get into to try and talk to a lens.

40:27.822 --> 40:28.302
I'm not gonna...

40:30.026 --> 40:32.669
I'm not gonna pull any punches here, it's just weird, right?

40:32.709 --> 40:48.327
But we got used to it over five years and I can still very easily see when my eye is wandering around the room or when I'm looking at the whiteboard over there with the number of exercises I've done and how many days off I've had and oh my gosh, we are...

40:49.255 --> 40:50.916
Our gym doesn't have power yet.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.238
It's not gonna have power until Monday, they say.

40:53.298 --> 40:55.560
I mean, we're in dire straits here.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.321
It's really first world problems.

40:57.341 --> 40:58.222
Let's let this go.

40:58.802 --> 41:11.111
Around the vaccine votes for this meeting, you said there were three vaccine categories, meningococcal disease, RSV vaccines for adults, and yes, I'm gonna say it right, chikungunya vaccines.

41:11.451 --> 41:14.734
Dr. Fryhofer, what's new for meningococcal vaccines?

41:16.271 --> 41:20.294
There's a new MenABCY combo vaccine.

41:20.855 --> 41:36.128
GSK's new pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, MenABCWY, brand name PenMenV, was added as an option when patients need both MenACWY and MenV vaccines at the same visit.

41:36.708 --> 41:40.491
This new GSK vaccine had been FDA approved back in February.

41:41.192 --> 41:48.555
Pfizer also has a penultimate version, both are a combo of men ACWY and men B vaccines.

41:49.235 --> 42:01.519
Now you might remember that the men ACWY components are interchangeable, but the same type of men B has to be used for all doses in the series and for booster doses as well.

42:02.219 --> 42:06.301
This vaccine was also added to the vaccine for children's program by ACIP.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.863
All right, and now let's turn to RSV vaccines.

42:09.903 --> 42:12.845
Does everyone 75 and older still need?

42:12.985 --> 42:14.527
Are they just going to go past that?

42:14.547 --> 42:15.307
No big deal.

42:15.387 --> 42:18.130
This was just added to the childhood schedule.

42:18.190 --> 42:18.890
Holy shit.

42:19.551 --> 42:20.332
That's impressive.

42:20.392 --> 42:21.332
That just was added.

42:21.393 --> 42:22.073
No problem.

42:22.554 --> 42:24.475
I guess we're up to 73 or four.

42:24.735 --> 42:25.396
What is that?

42:25.516 --> 42:25.876
Wow.

42:26.597 --> 42:27.918
Just went through that real quick.

42:29.480 --> 42:29.740
It does.

42:31.013 --> 42:35.878
Yes, everyone age 75 and older should get a dose of the RSV vaccine.

42:35.998 --> 42:37.159
That didn't change.

42:37.980 --> 42:42.345
Everyone 75 or older should get a dose of the RSV vaccine.

42:42.465 --> 42:43.326
That is.

42:47.370 --> 42:52.996
I would say, although I don't give any medical advice out on this stream, that is a no, sir.

42:54.059 --> 43:03.045
but the age range for the risk-based recommendation for those at high risk of severe RSV disease did, and was lowered from age 60.

43:03.305 --> 43:06.187
I would say that Jason in the chat is right.

43:06.307 --> 43:15.834
The childhood schedule was always the target, but more importantly, the debate about the COVID vaccine and its contamination and all this other stuff is keeping us off of this.

43:15.894 --> 43:20.877
Where's Children's Health Defense's headline, another shot added to the schedule?

43:20.897 --> 43:21.978
They don't even seem to know.

43:22.927 --> 43:31.852
They're too busy trying to cover their bases by saying that there's this profound autism that's really special, and we're really into that.

43:31.872 --> 43:36.875
That's our main message, that there's some severely profound autism that nobody ever sees.

43:38.495 --> 43:39.376
Holy crap.

43:40.489 --> 43:41.529
down to age 50.

43:42.010 --> 43:53.854
The medical conditions that increase risk of severe RSV include chronic heart, lung, kidney and liver disease as well as chronic hematologic and neurologic conditions and also being frail.

43:54.474 --> 43:58.596
Now understand that lowering the age indication to 50 increases

43:58.916 --> 43:59.976
That's a good question.

44:00.056 --> 44:00.937
I like that question.

44:00.957 --> 44:04.217
I see a new guy in the chat, so I like to talk to the new guys when they come in.

44:04.257 --> 44:06.138
I don't know if this is the first post you've made.

44:06.938 --> 44:12.940
Is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of getting jacked dumb?

44:13.540 --> 44:16.040
That is the best question I've had all day.

44:16.100 --> 44:18.681
Thank you very much for asking it.

44:19.401 --> 44:20.041
There is less

44:23.385 --> 44:30.207
I have less objection to the injection of chemically pure substances or nearly pure, whatever.

44:30.247 --> 44:38.969
A hormone being injected into the body and intramuscularly is inevitably going to end up in the lymph.

44:40.029 --> 44:43.410
And so intramuscular injection is going to do some local damage.

44:43.450 --> 44:45.430
It's not likely to get stuck anywhere.

44:45.990 --> 44:52.572
And so intramuscular injection is just a way of entering the blood and the lymph with less

44:55.376 --> 44:56.656
Temporal accuracy.

44:58.497 --> 45:01.017
And I really believe it's that malevolent.

45:01.197 --> 45:02.677
It's that bad of an idea.

45:02.717 --> 45:06.938
The only reason why you would do it is because you wanted something to leak out slowly.

45:07.558 --> 45:14.640
And so actually, intramuscular injection, when the intention of getting jacked, might be one of those times when you would do it.

45:14.680 --> 45:15.880
Now remember this, though.

45:15.920 --> 45:24.802
Remember carefully that it still relies on you knowing the contents of what you're injecting and the contents being free of contaminants.

45:26.115 --> 45:34.277
and being a biological molecule that you want there, and then intramuscular injection with the intent of getting jacked might work.

45:34.457 --> 45:35.417
Is it good for you?

45:35.617 --> 45:36.458
Are there risks?

45:37.198 --> 45:39.138
I think the risks are very similar.

45:39.258 --> 45:48.501
If you have a contaminated dose, if you have an impure dose, if your testosterone is contaminated with lots of other things, then you're risking all of these things.

45:48.601 --> 45:53.202
It's also possible that you could, I definitely think that

45:55.953 --> 46:13.104
The reason why intramuscular injection is advocated for is because it is a way of putting things in safer, safer than IV injection.

46:13.825 --> 46:16.867
And so think of it this way, would you give your testosterone IV?

46:16.947 --> 46:17.627
I think you would.

46:18.748 --> 46:20.710
I think you would probably want to do it slowly.

46:21.510 --> 46:25.193
And I think if you were doing an IV, you would just take the time to control

46:26.095 --> 46:27.456
how quickly you put it in.

46:28.696 --> 46:29.676
Maybe you'd do a drip.

46:30.417 --> 46:34.238
But intramuscular injection is kind of like a ham-fisted way of doing that.

46:35.378 --> 46:50.804
And it is very advantageous for somebody who wants to poison you and you not have any idea that what they did to you was poison you because the effects could be spread out over weeks or not even show up until then and then be spread out for weeks or months or years.

46:52.128 --> 47:07.054
And so that's what I think is most malevolent about this idea of intramuscular injection, because it does kind of make sense, but it makes sense from the perspective of somebody who wants to get jacked and is willing to inject something IV, but doesn't really want to inject IV a lot.

47:07.574 --> 47:09.414
So then muscle is a decent way to do it.

47:09.454 --> 47:15.937
Just don't miss the fat, don't hit the fat, don't do it too shallow, because then all kinds of bad things might happen.

47:16.437 --> 47:17.898
And if you could get it in your,

47:19.258 --> 47:22.799
in a small artery or a small vein in the muscle, you will feel it.

47:23.139 --> 47:27.199
And it will feel different than when you just get it into a place where it slowly leaks out.

47:28.060 --> 47:35.261
So is intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intention of getting jacked dumb?

47:35.901 --> 47:42.482
I think it's relatively dumb to just trying to do it without doing an intramuscular injection.

47:43.042 --> 47:46.383
But intramuscular injection of something like a hormone

47:47.642 --> 47:59.814
with the intention of you don't have the equipment or you don't want, you don't have the talent to do it yourself in intravenous, then it's like a, as I said, a ham-fisted substitute.

48:00.555 --> 48:06.981
Because in reality the best way for you to do it would be to inject it in your blood and inject it very slowly and controlled.

48:08.494 --> 48:12.257
And that would be, again, that would be the idea.

48:12.337 --> 48:14.198
But again, I'm not advocating for any of it.

48:14.238 --> 48:17.341
I'm still not saying that intramuscular injection is a good idea.

48:17.381 --> 48:18.782
I think it's, in general, dumb.

48:19.542 --> 48:24.747
But it makes more sense from the perspective of somebody who wants to take a shortcut to getting jacked.

48:25.768 --> 48:36.946
than it does to, say, augment a healthy kid's immune system or a healthy elderly person's immune system, which is what they are advocating for here.

48:36.986 --> 48:37.787
Thanks for the question.

48:37.807 --> 48:38.509
Welcome to the chat.

48:41.275 --> 48:49.819
And this is because studies show black patients are more likely to have more chronic medical conditions at an earlier age as compared to white patients.

48:50.760 --> 49:01.765
We now have three RSV vaccines, but right now only two of them, the two protein-based RSV vaccines, Arexiv and Abrizo, are licensed for adults age 50 and older.

49:02.245 --> 49:09.794
Moderna's Mresvia has applied to FDA to lower its age range indication, and that should be decided by June.

49:10.334 --> 49:16.041
And the work group's now looking at giving RSV vaccine to even younger adults, so more to come.

49:16.722 --> 49:19.885
How can she say that with a smile on her face?

49:20.925 --> 49:30.330
Like, the goal is to have as many vaccines on the schedule as possible, available for as many people as possible, with enough potential boosters as possible.

49:30.931 --> 49:38.795
You know, if we could make a vaccine that was so safe you could take 10 boosters, then that would be the ultimate thing, according to this lady's rationale.

49:39.696 --> 49:41.857
What about boosters for RSV?

49:42.057 --> 49:43.218
Is there an update there?

49:44.909 --> 49:46.170
They're still under study.

49:46.230 --> 49:53.158
For now, only one lifetime dose is recommended, but that will likely change, but no new recommendations yet.

49:53.998 --> 49:56.661
All right, now for chikungunya vaccines.

49:56.942 --> 49:57.782
What's the news there?

49:57.822 --> 50:00.005
This is more of a risk, I think, for travelers, isn't it?

50:01.081 --> 50:01.681
Exactly.

50:01.721 --> 50:03.863
And you did a great job pronouncing that, Todd.

50:03.903 --> 50:05.524
I hope I can do it as well as you did.

50:06.204 --> 50:12.889
A second type of chikungunya vaccine, ChikVLP, a virus-like particle vaccine, brand name.

50:13.689 --> 50:24.016
I know some guy by the name of Sina Bhavari who's got a virus-like particle patent that looks a lot like Ebola, which is kind of cool, good for him.

50:25.577 --> 50:29.580
I don't think he's an American citizen, but he's the head of a very important American

50:30.535 --> 50:32.917
military organization, which is strange.

50:33.497 --> 50:43.465
Sina Bavari also put out a really interesting paper with the Ralph Baric's last postdoc before the pandemic started, Allison Totura, who was also on Jeopardy.

50:44.926 --> 50:56.375
And that paper is featured also in this book that Kevin McKernan, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project, is lying about with regard to a gentleman by the name of Charles Rixey.

50:58.075 --> 50:59.176
America is under attack.

50:59.236 --> 51:00.096
I don't know what to say.

51:00.276 --> 51:01.557
We are being undermined.

51:02.658 --> 51:04.419
I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:04.959 --> 51:07.041
has been misled.

51:07.121 --> 51:09.962
I think Jay Bhattacharya is way over his head.

51:09.982 --> 51:16.246
And I think at the heart of it is Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and a bunch of scrubs.

51:17.107 --> 51:17.787
And we can win.

51:18.127 --> 51:18.748
That's what I think.

51:20.051 --> 51:29.584
But we have to come together as a country to understand that this side is just as absurd as that side that is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:29.624 --> 51:31.527
They do not mean to win.

51:32.348 --> 51:33.870
They are not anti-vax.

51:33.930 --> 51:36.174
They are not for health freedom.

51:37.642 --> 51:38.463
They are liars.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.625
They are for mandatory vaccination.

51:41.685 --> 51:45.849
They are for advancing new vaccines and making them mRNA.

51:46.389 --> 51:49.692
And they are for personalized medicine driven by AI.

51:50.032 --> 51:52.414
Even Mary Holland has said that.

51:55.794 --> 52:08.638
Chikungunya was added as an option for adolescents and adults age 12 and older traveling to areas with active outbreaks of this mosquito-borne illness, and also for laboratory workers at increased risk of exposure.

52:09.378 --> 52:22.022
Also, a new precaution for those age 65 and older was added for the other Chikungunya vaccine, ChikLA, a live attenuated virus vaccine, brand name XChik.

52:22.822 --> 52:26.945
This precaution was based on post-licensing surveillance safety studies.

52:27.566 --> 52:41.356
And I have to tell you, I've been a liaison to ACIP for nearly two decades, and I'm so impressed and reassured by the multiple ways CDC and FDA work together to monitor vaccine safety.

52:41.877 --> 52:52.465
This includes programs like VAERS, CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, V-SAFE, VSD, the Vaccine Safety Data Link, and CISA,

52:52.785 --> 53:05.708
So remember that none other than Jessica Rose has been paraded around the world, specifically blowing the whistle on the VAERS data with regard to the COVID shot.

53:06.808 --> 53:15.850
And the implication of her work is that there is a signal present from the COVID shot that was not present before the pandemic.

53:19.560 --> 53:23.964
It kind of implies that the previous vaccine schedule in America was okay.

53:24.804 --> 53:30.469
Even though she does a lot of podcasts for CHD, she doesn't seem to be aware that VAERS was never that useful.

53:31.349 --> 53:39.175
And yet she has perpetuated it as a source of data on the COVID shot, which is pretty extraordinary.

53:40.917 --> 53:44.680
And it's pretty extraordinary when you realize that there is a document

53:45.762 --> 53:53.829
called the Spars Pandemic, S-P-A-R-S, and you can look online for the PDF, Spars Document PDF.

53:54.990 --> 54:03.457
And around page 47, you will find a narrative about a hypothetical internet personality called Epigirl.

54:04.465 --> 54:15.388
who spends a couple years during the spars pandemic exposing the vaccine harm caused by the shot that was rolled out in this hypothetical scenario.

54:15.448 --> 54:24.090
And yes, I am saying that this likely NATO coordinated operation had people in place on social media.

54:24.130 --> 54:32.712
And one of them is Jessica Rose, the Canadian Israeli surfer girl with five post-secondary degrees.

54:34.597 --> 54:43.922
She is intimately related to Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and the sort of curation of this narrative.

54:44.588 --> 54:47.090
There is no other explanation for her existence.

54:47.150 --> 55:03.962
And more importantly, there's no other explanation for their insistence on us accepting this resume of hers, which is just, as far as anybody trying to apply for a job, she would be essentially a failure because she just did a bunch of postdocs on a bunch of unrelated things.

55:04.043 --> 55:09.206
Some of which were HIV, some of which were some other virus, some of which were ticks or something like that.

55:09.767 --> 55:11.168
It's really bizarre.

55:12.486 --> 55:17.734
that we have been force-fed Jessica Rose via somebody like Peter McCullough.

55:18.174 --> 55:25.065
Somebody like Peter McCullough who has been as far afield as Australia to testify about what happened in America.

55:26.874 --> 55:34.577
because what happened in America has to be a virus because that's the justification for the lockdown in Australia and New Zealand.

55:34.597 --> 55:36.718
That's why they had to go to Australia and testify.

55:37.258 --> 55:43.161
Oh yes, lots of people died in America and Pierre Kory traveled the world to tell everybody that.

55:45.042 --> 55:50.704
And it is this coordinated effort to insist that there was dying, that there was somebody dead.

55:51.957 --> 55:53.198
and that they died of COVID.

55:53.518 --> 55:56.440
And that's why there's no doubt about this.

55:56.620 --> 56:11.648
And all of these people were put in place to make sure that they would never be any doubt about this, despite the fact that we have no data from before 2020 about any of these signals that they say are evidence of a spreading novel pathogen.

56:12.168 --> 56:18.232
And these people are way too unsophisticated to understand that because they were already on the wrong side of the ball

56:19.289 --> 56:22.591
when the fake anti-vax movement was just barely getting started.

56:24.392 --> 56:30.296
And now it is in full bloom and present in the current administration in the White House.

56:30.356 --> 56:34.039
Will it be a self-destruct signal for the administration?

56:34.059 --> 56:43.405
Will it be a way for them to implode the government or to further ruin what's left of our trust in the government?

56:43.465 --> 56:46.267
I mean, what else could we possibly see here?

56:48.854 --> 56:51.736
the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project.

56:52.156 --> 56:57.919
They also collaborate with government and non-government partners to ensure vaccine safety.

56:58.779 --> 57:11.406
And I am hoping that once Mr. Kennedy can take a breath and really has time to get a grasp of how these safety monitoring systems work, he'll have confidence, more confidence in the current system.

57:11.946 --> 57:24.878
Now, we have to remember he's not a physician, but in his current position, he is going to learn a lot about the intricacies of vaccine development and the rigorous testing these vaccines go through before coming to market.

57:24.898 --> 57:31.605
We've talked about the votes, but are there any other items of interest that you want to share?

57:31.665 --> 57:32.846
Was there a measles update?

57:34.145 --> 57:40.370
Yes, and of all infectious diseases, measles is one of the most contagious.

57:40.430 --> 57:49.177
And if you're exposed and you're not immune, 90% of the time, you'll get it too, but you don't have to because there's a vaccine.

57:49.477 --> 57:50.478
We've had one since 1963.

57:50.638 --> 57:54.882
I hear, see people in the chat talking about old videos.

57:54.942 --> 57:59.745
If you find old videos like that, please send the links forward in any way you can.

58:00.686 --> 58:02.827
I'm archiving things like mad.

58:02.927 --> 58:04.867
Mark is archiving things like mad.

58:06.268 --> 58:18.171
I think it's absolutely vital that we accurately catalog what these people were up to before the pandemic and right at the start of it because it will inevitably reveal their malevolence.

58:19.051 --> 58:22.093
It's safe, it's effective, and it works.

58:22.733 --> 58:29.196
Two doses of MMR, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles.

58:29.716 --> 58:32.338
One dose is about 93% effective.

58:32.778 --> 58:38.501
Now, the discussion at ACIP showed lots of maps with outbreaks and vaccine coverage comparisons.

58:39.201 --> 58:43.403
You need 95% coverage of vaccination to provide herd immunity.

58:43.844 --> 58:53.009
And in Gaines County, Texas, and that's where the most recent outbreak started and is where it's most concentrated, two MMR dose coverage is only 82%.

58:55.390 --> 59:00.475
This outbreak is spreading and now half of our states are now reporting cases of measles.

59:01.296 --> 59:08.123
Two children in Texas who had no previous underlying medical conditions and one adult in New Mexico have died.

59:08.944 --> 59:10.365
None of them have been vaccinated.

59:11.526 --> 59:24.812
Representatives from the CDC have been deployed to Texas, but understand it's only April and we've already surpassed last year's 2024 total of 285 measles cases in the US.

59:25.432 --> 59:33.715
And as per the CDC website, as of April 17th, 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported.

59:34.036 --> 59:37.997
And that doesn't include those that are measles cases that have not been confirmed.

59:38.678 --> 59:39.098
And Todd.

59:39.858 --> 59:44.500
As you know, HHS Secretary Kennedy... Okay, I'm not gonna watch this script anymore.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.381
We got another video queued up here.

59:47.141 --> 59:48.242
Thank you very much for being here.

59:48.262 --> 59:52.283
This is a Geo and Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

59:52.303 --> 59:53.544
May 2nd, 2025.

59:54.104 --> 59:55.105
RNA cannot pandemic.

59:55.145 --> 59:57.145
Intramuscular injections are in general dumb.

59:57.626 --> 01:00:02.568
Transfection was always a crime and the population pyramid is something they are definitely

01:00:03.328 --> 01:00:05.409
definitely managing actively right now.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.151
And the more vaccines they roll out, the easier it is to manage.

01:00:10.712 --> 01:00:13.314
Don't let this, these people put sand in your eye.

01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:15.735
Don't believe all of their stories.

01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:19.017
Don't accept everything that they insist on accepting.

01:00:20.257 --> 01:00:20.798
Start over.

01:00:21.338 --> 01:00:22.999
The most important thing is to start over.

01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:29.502
And I mean start over with the biology, is what I really mean.

01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:40.828
You need to start over with who you have faith in, start over with who you believe, start over with the premises, with the fact that PCR was telling you something, because it wasn't.

01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:44.050
That's the most important message I have for you.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.511
PCR was the primary illusion.

01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:56.639
so

01:01:09.947 --> 01:01:12.168
Once again, thank you everybody for being here.

01:01:12.328 --> 01:01:16.589
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Couey, Chief Biologist at Gigome Biological.

01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:27.871
You can find me on PubMed using my last name and my first initials J and J. You can find a lot of my ideas regularly represented on the sub stack, Woodhouse 76.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:34.773
That sub stack is written basically by two people, mostly Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler.

01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:37.614
They use my ideas to have dialogue with Claire Craig.

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:48.480
the 100,000 Genomes Project person in the UK, the head of the Heart Group, or with Pierre Corey about the fake things that happened in New York.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.981
And they write a lot of articles.

01:01:51.482 --> 01:02:02.108
Her and Jonathan Engler from Panda are very busy absorbing what they can from the three talks that I gave at Panda that Panda somehow lost and didn't put on Rumble.

01:02:02.648 --> 01:02:03.268
That's too bad.

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:04.909
Anyway, that's fine.

01:02:05.009 --> 01:02:11.071
Children's Health Defense had me as a staff scientist for a while, but once I started calling out Robert Malone, they didn't like that.

01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:12.971
They fired me because that's not selling books.

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:15.152
But I did help them write a book.

01:02:15.172 --> 01:02:17.613
I actually helped Bobby write the Wuhan cover-up book.

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:18.273
You can find me.

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:19.254
I mentioned it before.

01:02:19.974 --> 01:02:21.414
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:22.695
Biology is the way.

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:24.275
Thank you for being here.

01:02:24.635 --> 01:02:26.156
This is for all the marbles indeed.

01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:31.480
And that's why we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.681
That's where we are.

01:02:33.782 --> 01:02:40.987
I'm trying to teach a way out, and the way out is to discard this, to reject the bad biology 101 that's in all of our textbooks.

01:02:41.568 --> 01:02:43.069
Evolution because DNA.

01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:50.835
Instead, remember that they have lied to you about a background, an irreducibly complex background of bacterial activity that includes

01:02:51.375 --> 01:03:01.964
They're phages, and that is a level of genetic noise that no PCR was ever capable of seeing through.

01:03:02.924 --> 01:03:16.175
And so what they have done is essentially taken non-specific PCR tests on an incredibly loud background and claimed that they were showing us a high-fidelity signal when RNA cannot pandemic.

01:03:16.255 --> 01:03:16.975
And if it can,

01:03:17.955 --> 01:03:24.599
It's only pandemicing because bacteria are making it or we are making it or other entities are making it.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.343
It is not all by itself from a mud puddle into all the white-tailed deer in North America.

01:03:30.403 --> 01:03:33.365
That is not what happened over these last five years.

01:03:33.826 --> 01:03:42.671
And for sure, the only reason why more people are not acutely injured by what I've called the transfection since the very beginning is because they use placebo.

01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:44.653
And of course, that's what made it so easy

01:03:45.293 --> 01:03:48.855
for them to get as many doses available as possible.

01:03:50.416 --> 01:03:57.220
Understand very clearly, if you want everybody to wear masks, but they can't get one, then it's not a very big, it's not a very good PSYOP.

01:03:58.521 --> 01:04:08.868
But if everybody can get tests, and everybody needs a test, and everybody agrees that the tests are evidence of something, then suddenly the ghosts are real, and suddenly the Ghostbusters are heroes.

01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:16.481
but I assure you that using their tests to find their ghosts does not make their ghosts real, nor does it make you a ghost buster.

01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:27.153
But Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn were both busy in 2020 from the very beginning, telling us this was a worst case scenario where PCR worked to find ghosts.

01:04:27.253 --> 01:04:29.396
And this ghost might've come from a laboratory.

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:36.693
And that's how you know it's a lie, because that's the scooby-doo.

01:04:36.753 --> 01:04:44.797
That's what this stream has been trying to break and has pretty much settled on this slide for the last four or five years.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:49.960
So there is a, we need a new consensus about how social media is being weaponized against us.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.761
We definitely need a new consensus about it.

01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:57.384
I don't have the video in here, so I'm going to go to it right now and put it in live.

01:04:58.044 --> 01:05:02.208
I've forgotten to drop it in and I can see already that it's not coming over here on this side.

01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:03.910
Let's see, it would be in here.

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:09.896
And it will be a little bit earlier because I downloaded it earlier.

01:05:09.956 --> 01:05:10.937
What was it called again?

01:05:10.957 --> 01:05:11.017
Yes.

01:05:14.895 --> 01:05:24.701
Time now for our series On Democracy, where we hear a range of perspectives on how government should function, what led to this moment in American history, and where the country goes next.

01:05:25.101 --> 01:05:35.707
Our primary focus tonight is Project 2025, the conservative policy project authored by former Trump administration officials, which became a flashpoint during the presidential campaign.

01:05:36.368 --> 01:05:39.511
So this is like the diffuse proposal, but for Democrats, right?

01:05:39.572 --> 01:05:42.415
This is the, Oh my gosh, there's a document out there.

01:05:43.055 --> 01:05:45.298
And this document says all kinds of crazy things.

01:05:45.338 --> 01:05:48.401
So if a couple of these things happen, then they must be going to do all of these.

01:05:48.421 --> 01:05:50.303
So this is the basis of this theater, right?

01:05:50.824 --> 01:05:55.068
But the guy who's going to come out and talk about this is going to show you a map.

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:57.451
And I don't think the map is that bad.

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.035
Angelo Carusone has studied that 900-page document.

01:06:01.415 --> 01:06:10.729
He's president of Media Matters, a progressive nonprofit focused on researching and analyzing news media, including disinformation and online ecosystems.

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.091
I spoke with him days ago.

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.161
Angela Carusone, welcome to the NewsHour.

01:06:15.201 --> 01:06:15.721
Thanks for having me.

01:06:16.081 --> 01:06:24.086
You have emerged as an expert on Project 2025, this roadmap that then-candidate Trump, during the campaign, repeatedly disavowed.

01:06:25.026 --> 01:06:32.570
Now, the architect of Project 2025 is just quoted as saying, the way that Trump has implemented it has exceeded his wildest dreams.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:42.235
When you look at the way President Trump has expanded his executive authority, he's dismantled federal agencies, he's purged the federal workforce, how much is Project 2025 guiding this work?

01:06:43.578 --> 01:06:48.081
What Project 2025 provided was sort of the core story here, which was to, who's the bad guy?

01:06:48.602 --> 01:06:49.562
And that was the deep state.

01:06:49.723 --> 01:07:02.112
And they basically said, essentially, most of the federal government, most of the federal workers were part of this deep state, a conspiracy to sort of prevent Donald Trump or anybody else from implementing major changes and sort of a conservative agenda.

01:07:02.692 --> 01:07:06.414
And then the second thing it did was not only provide who the bad guy was, but then who's the good guy.

01:07:06.755 --> 01:07:08.996
And in this case, the good guy is not just Donald Trump.

01:07:09.076 --> 01:07:10.317
It's a unitary executive.

01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:11.578
So that is it.

01:07:11.718 --> 01:07:16.661
Obviously, there's a lot of policy that Project 2025 has sort of provided the framework for.

01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:18.622
But essentially, it was a story.

01:07:19.062 --> 01:07:21.364
And it was a story of who's the bad guy and who's the good guy.

01:07:21.864 --> 01:07:25.527
And to that extent, that story is playing out exactly according to plan.

01:07:25.567 --> 01:07:28.430
The only major difference is the timeline.

01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:30.832
It's just moving along a lot faster.

01:07:31.272 --> 01:07:39.099
We're basically in sort of like the fifth or sixth month of Project 2025, according to the book, even though we're only in the second month of the administration.

01:07:39.619 --> 01:07:41.321
So where does this head next then?

01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:45.844
Well, one is that we're barely through even through the layoffs and the terminations.

01:07:45.884 --> 01:07:49.586
We've only gotten rid of about 70 or so thousand federal workers.

01:07:49.706 --> 01:07:57.251
Project 2025 calls for somewhere around 300,000 to about a million federal workers to be removed.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:07:58.072
So where does it go?

01:07:58.112 --> 01:07:59.473
More layoffs, more terminations.

01:07:59.973 --> 01:08:05.897
The second thing, and this is the big one, is to sort of set up a collision between the executive branch

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:07.258
and the judicial branch.

01:08:07.578 --> 01:08:14.862
One of the big parts of Project 2025 was to make it very clear that the president and the executive has ultimate authority.

01:08:14.942 --> 01:08:19.884
And that means that you start with Congress, and Congress has largely abdicated itself to the administration.

01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:21.165
So that was sort of their first target.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:24.427
But politics basically said, we're not even going to try to fight this out.

01:08:24.447 --> 01:08:27.389
We're not even going to defend our sort of co-equal status.

01:08:27.929 --> 01:08:32.812
So now where it goes next is sort of a showdown with the courts.

01:08:34.338 --> 01:08:38.520
If the strategy is all laid out and President Trump, you can argue about what he's done.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.042
You can't argue that he hasn't been entirely transparent about it.

01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:41.342
Yeah.

01:08:41.762 --> 01:08:44.564
How should those opposed to what he's doing, how should they fight back?

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:51.704
I think the thing that's really important here is that we are not fighting a standard political battle.

01:08:51.984 --> 01:08:54.586
Project 2025 is really unpopular.

01:08:54.806 --> 01:08:58.809
Nobody actually really likes the policies there, except a very small extreme view.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:02.131
But they don't see how those policies are actually affecting them.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:09.676
There has to be a bigger story here, and that starts with connecting the dots to the administration's actions and the harms that people are experiencing.

01:09:10.096 --> 01:09:13.319
That's a political issue, but that's as much of a media issue as well.

01:09:14.199 --> 01:09:15.680
And then broadly, not this.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.340
Consensus around not this.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.283
And if we are not able to win the hearts and minds, Project 2025, whatever it becomes called, will be the new norm.

01:09:24.043 --> 01:09:32.166
And the right and Trump-friendly voices have an advantage here, because the other part of your work is looking at their saturation in the media ecosystem.

01:09:32.766 --> 01:09:33.286
Tell me about that.

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:37.308
I think the biggest challenge right now that we're grappling with, and there are lots.

01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:38.428
This is the part.

01:09:38.768 --> 01:09:42.550
But they all sort of play out in one arena, and that is an information landscape.

01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:48.731
And the real battle, from my perspective, is in the information war.

01:09:49.411 --> 01:09:51.551
And the right just has an enormous advantage there.

01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.112
They've had some advantages along the way.

01:09:54.132 --> 01:09:55.632
There's always been a little bit of an imbalance.

01:09:55.652 --> 01:09:59.593
You know, talk radio and Fox News in the 90s and early 2000s, they had dominance.

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:01.293
They had a lot of listeners.

01:10:01.593 --> 01:10:04.094
But there were other things that counterbalanced them.

01:10:04.214 --> 01:10:07.094
So they weren't dominant in the entire information landscape.

01:10:07.194 --> 01:10:11.655
So now what's coming, I'm sure you can predict it, but I want you to predict it yourself right now,

01:10:12.735 --> 01:10:23.302
is a description of an alternative media podcast landscape that is dominated by right-leaning conservative podcasts.

01:10:23.482 --> 01:10:26.624
And they heard so many cats.

01:10:28.785 --> 01:10:40.192
And what I'm going to argue is that essentially what you have is a fake anti-vax health freedom truth movement that has been turned into a fake populist movement.

01:10:40.993 --> 01:10:53.505
And at the heart of it are people as diverse as all of the people that are ultimately behind CHD, ICAN, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:55.555 --> 01:11:03.947
All of this movement, all of this weird nutrition, you know, 12 worst anti-vaxxers out there.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:10.616
This is all one network of people that has always been actively herding cats.

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:23.770
not acknowledging one another, not building useful networks, not building common truths, but separating people from each other and making them choose a particular mascot.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:29.556
Is it Joe Mercola or is it CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:11:30.317 --> 01:11:32.519
Or maybe Del Bigtree is more your thing.

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:41.105
But no one has ever made a united front on a particular issue.

01:11:41.145 --> 01:11:43.146
You know, like the most important issue.

01:11:43.186 --> 01:11:45.766
The one where they're injuring kids or something like that.

01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:48.467
It hasn't happened by design.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:55.828
And he's going to show you how it is very visible how social media does it.

01:11:56.669 --> 01:12:03.350
It is a network of people who agrees to agree with each other while absorbing all the other people.

01:12:07.512 --> 01:12:09.434
Oops, that was not the click I wanted.

01:12:09.514 --> 01:12:11.436
This is the click I wanted.

01:12:11.816 --> 01:12:13.938
They just spoke to a very consolidated few.

01:12:14.338 --> 01:12:15.719
That's just not the case anymore.

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:26.329
So we just did this really big study that looked on online voices and sort of the largest programs, sort of political and non-political adjacent, left, left adjacent, right, right adjacent.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:27.710
When you add it all up,

01:12:28.633 --> 01:12:35.295
The right and right-leaning and right-adjacent programming accounts for 82% of the major online shows.

01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:43.458
That's podcasts, that's streaming channels, that's just... I think that this is largely the doing of a guy by the name of Steve Bannon.

01:12:44.758 --> 01:12:58.122
I think it also could have to do with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the other guy that works for Palantir understanding that there is a way that people come to know things.

01:13:00.183 --> 01:13:11.254
And maybe the most powerful way that people come to know things is listening to people that they like, respect, or are attracted to have an agreement with other people about what the truth is.

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:21.424
That, these are all more powerful from a psychological perspective than me coming online all by myself and just talking to you.

01:13:23.786 --> 01:13:41.472
going on a podcast with anybody, in theory, has this extra potential to create this illusion of consensus, where if I convince the podcast host that I'm cool, or I'm smart, and the podcast host reacts that way, then you're more likely to receive the information that I'm giving that way.

01:13:43.035 --> 01:13:55.417
Whereas if I just sit here all by myself, controlling my own stream and queuing up my own videos and making my own mistakes, you really have to have a one-on-one evaluation of what I'm saying.

01:13:55.457 --> 01:13:57.658
You really have to think about what I'm talking about.

01:13:57.678 --> 01:13:59.898
And you really have to see through all the emotion.

01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:04.559
You have to see through all of the confusion and the frustration that I have.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.720
And so it's real communication, not an illusion.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:17.687
Because again, remember, the idea is that these are not spontaneous conversations, but they are people who know the script.

01:14:18.868 --> 01:14:22.791
And know where the script should be steered in order to score a goal.

01:14:24.031 --> 01:14:31.416
You know, Ben Shapiro does a podcast, and you can think of it as like, okay, how many times can you get him to say Israel?

01:14:33.297 --> 01:14:34.818
That's his main shtick.

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:37.379
Joe Rogan is just, you know, how long can you make it?

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.661
How wandering can you make it?

01:14:41.169 --> 01:14:42.589
How many pot jokes can you make?

01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:46.591
Russell Brand, it's all the same thing.

01:14:47.511 --> 01:14:55.934
They're just looking for people with the skill, the raw skill to herd cats, and then they will fund them and script them.

01:14:57.134 --> 01:15:04.037
Finding people who can herd cats, then they train them, they fund them, and they script them.

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:07.198
That's all this is.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:26.851
There are almost no independent podcasts that are just out there besides somebody like me or somebody like Mark, with a legitimate professional background to do it, with a legitimate thing to say, and able to produce hours of useful content without interviewing anyone.

01:15:28.192 --> 01:15:30.213
That's how you can see that we are legitimate.

01:15:30.253 --> 01:15:31.234
It's harder work.

01:15:31.914 --> 01:15:34.976
Harder work for you as a viewer, harder work for me as a presenter.

01:15:36.038 --> 01:15:42.741
But this is a joke, and he is showing you how much of it a joke it is, and it should be seen as such.

01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:50.004
He's presenting it as a danger to America's democracy, and in some ways it is, because these people are pretending to be patriots.

01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:53.546
In many ways, it's dangerous then, isn't it?

01:15:56.462 --> 01:15:59.203
whoops, I did that same wrong click again, you see?

01:15:59.223 --> 01:16:01.023
It's narrative dominance, that, yeah.

01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:05.964
And that includes podcasts that aren't overtly political, like sports and comedy podcasts, for instance.

01:16:06.004 --> 01:16:17.407
Yeah, that was the part that was the most, to me, surprising and yet disturbing about the study, is that of the 400 plus shows that we looked at, 100 or so of them were non-political, sports, culture.

01:16:17.787 --> 01:16:22.748
But when you actually looked at an analysis of the program, I mean, you listened to them, you coded them, we found that 72% of them

01:16:24.949 --> 01:16:32.074
72% of explicitly non-political programming contained not only political content, but right-leaning political content.

01:16:32.094 --> 01:16:46.065
They just branded it or... Please understand that this is as malevolent as it gets because some of these right-leaning people are going as far away and being on the news in Australia, representing COVID skepticism there.

01:16:47.119 --> 01:16:49.780
It's all one malevolent show.

01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:58.125
It is a narration control network that is probably auctioned to or sold to the highest bidder.

01:16:58.205 --> 01:16:59.266
Look what we can do.

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:03.028
Look what Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan can do.

01:17:03.788 --> 01:17:08.150
Look what George Webb and Paul Cottrell and his network can do.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.992
Look at what we can do with Jessica Rose.

01:17:11.052 --> 01:17:13.133
Look what we have done with CHD.

01:17:13.593 --> 01:17:14.814
We can do that for you.

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:20.731
That's what you have here.

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:25.014
And the US government may be a customer.

01:17:26.356 --> 01:17:28.978
How can we censor without censoring?

01:17:29.018 --> 01:17:30.579
Well, we don't want to censor anybody.

01:17:30.659 --> 01:17:38.806
So instead of censoring, why don't we just program it so that by the time anybody finds the people that they're following, they've already been distracted by something else.

01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:39.727
That's not censoring.

01:17:40.147 --> 01:17:41.168
That's just programming.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:52.162
so that you always end up at the Teo Vaughn podcast or the Lex Friedman podcast or the Joe Rogan podcast or the PBT podcast.

01:17:52.643 --> 01:18:01.885
You're never, no matter how much clicking you do, there's no path in random clicking that gets you to giggle and be like, whoa, I guess you would really like this channel.

01:18:02.785 --> 01:18:10.027
It's not, it's not groove shark, you know, where it's judging based on the last videos, except,

01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:14.377
Where can we get you to go where you waste as much time as possible?

01:18:14.437 --> 01:18:15.621
That's also built in.

01:18:15.681 --> 01:18:16.824
It's not Groove Shark.

01:18:18.413 --> 01:18:19.933
These people are where you end up.

01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:22.094
I framed it as something different.

01:18:22.774 --> 01:18:28.376
And that's where this really becomes key, is that that is the lens through which people see the world.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:38.418
And so when all of that programming is sort of tilting the scales in favor of the right, the story that the majority of Americans are getting day to day is right leaning.

01:18:38.498 --> 01:18:44.280
And I see no better illustration of that gap than if you look at in particular what's happening with young people.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.704
Young people are accelerating and moving to the right faster than any other demographic.

01:18:50.224 --> 01:18:56.569
And I don't think it's a coincidence that they just happen to consume online media more than any other demographic does.

01:18:56.789 --> 01:19:05.716
That's their primary source, and yet they themselves are moving at a faster and faster clip to the right because that landscape is so heavily dominated and saturated by the right.

01:19:05.976 --> 01:19:06.917
It's quite an asymmetry.

01:19:06.937 --> 01:19:11.981
I mean, is there any way that Democrats could... Sounds like asymmetric warfare.

01:19:12.001 --> 01:19:16.085
That is the key issue here, right, is that they're playing with a very old playbook.

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:20.728
They think that the issue here is about messaging and message discipline.

01:19:20.748 --> 01:19:26.253
Say, well, if we all just go out there and say the same thing at the same time, that will get our message out.

01:19:26.513 --> 01:19:28.415
That model worked 20 years ago.

01:19:28.755 --> 01:19:29.656
That doesn't work now.

01:19:29.716 --> 01:19:31.377
In fact, it feeds into the opposite.

01:19:31.618 --> 01:19:34.260
They are feeding into the story that's being told about them.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:42.746
I think actually it does work and that's why I have that graphic of all these people that I've met and then they just went on talking their shit.

01:19:44.107 --> 01:19:48.210
Because it does work to have a bunch of people on a script and make them stick to it.

01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:55.575
From as wide an audience stream from Brett Weinstein all the way to Sam Harris.

01:19:55.635 --> 01:19:57.737
It's all controlled on both sides.

01:19:57.817 --> 01:20:02.240
This guy is just kind of naive to the fact that both sides have a script.

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:11.148
He's naive to the fact that the natural virus script is a script, just like the lab leak was a script.

01:20:12.028 --> 01:20:25.380
And so he looks at these people as rejecting science and being conspiracy theorists, not understanding that his dismissal of that idea is as programmed as their acceptance of it.

01:20:26.934 --> 01:20:28.596
It's all a Scooby-Doo mystery.

01:20:44.398 --> 01:20:45.719
They're artists in a way.

01:20:45.759 --> 01:20:46.380
They're storytellers.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:46.960
They're creators.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.222
They just need the resources to continue to do what they're doing.

01:20:49.263 --> 01:20:51.084
That will help balance out the scales.

01:20:51.505 --> 01:20:53.306
The second is to stop being so afraid.

01:20:54.067 --> 01:20:55.588
So it's a really interesting thing, right?

01:20:55.628 --> 01:20:58.871
Because I have a pretty interesting story.

01:20:58.971 --> 01:21:00.312
I'm a pretty good storyteller.

01:21:00.353 --> 01:21:05.117
I have a good story about current people in government.

01:21:05.797 --> 01:21:10.101
And so I would be fundable by any democratic source that would want to, you know,

01:21:11.222 --> 01:21:21.674
Shed light on this in in terms of the Trump administration, but I haven't gotten any phone calls from that side either That's how you know that this is one big malevolent show

01:21:22.881 --> 01:21:25.262
They have steak dinners with each other, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:25.482 --> 01:21:26.282
It has an advantage.

01:21:26.302 --> 01:21:28.863
That asymmetry doesn't just give them the ability to project a story.

01:21:29.203 --> 01:21:31.784
It also gives their leaders comfort and confidence.

01:21:32.144 --> 01:21:47.889
If I know that I could go out there and face plant, and I have a massive ecosystem that is going to be like sandpaper to smooth out all the edges, and not only make that face plant look like the greatest acrobatic feat ever, but somehow turn it into a reward system for me, I have a lot more comfort.

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:48.869
I have a lot more confidence.

01:21:49.269 --> 01:21:54.692
And that speaks to the broader... What if you could, you know, use social media to fake a Trump assassination attempt?

01:21:54.732 --> 01:22:00.235
Would that sell the president on the effectiveness of your social media network?

01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:01.415
I wonder if that would work.

01:22:04.457 --> 01:22:09.419
Could you sell a presidential candidate on the effectiveness of your media network if you did that with him?

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:14.382
Hmm.

01:22:15.885 --> 01:22:16.405
Just curious.

01:22:38.243 --> 01:22:41.847
It actually affects the rules of their algorithms, what their systems are doing.

01:22:42.147 --> 01:22:49.875
That imbalance is only going to speed up because the very systems that support them are actually privileging right-wing lies and right-wing misinformation.

01:22:50.536 --> 01:22:53.459
Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, thanks for being here.

01:22:53.479 --> 01:22:53.939
Thanks for having me.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:55.361
Interesting, huh?

01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:58.044
Interesting stuff on the PBS NewsHour.

01:22:59.318 --> 01:23:05.706
So we need a new consensus about this stuff that they can lead us to believe anything really, you know, they can and they have.

01:23:06.287 --> 01:23:11.774
They've hidden this anticipated rise in expected deaths and the murder that was used to sculpt it.

01:23:12.777 --> 01:23:16.299
and lied about this RNA pandemic for five and a half years now.

01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:17.079
This is murder.

01:23:17.119 --> 01:23:23.242
If I step aside, you can definitely see we had pneumonia under control and then lost control of it.

01:23:23.282 --> 01:23:26.124
And then at the end of 2022, we gained control again.

01:23:26.184 --> 01:23:29.485
This is just- Hey everybody, it's me, Sam Stein, Managing Editor at The Bulwark.

01:23:29.545 --> 01:23:34.788
And I am joined by Jonathan Cohn, who writes our Breakdown Newsletter, which everyone should be reading.

01:23:34.848 --> 01:23:36.409
If you're not already, subscribe to that.

01:23:37.049 --> 01:23:39.651
We are going to be talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:40.032
What else?

01:23:40.612 --> 01:23:56.104
But in this case, he's made a series of, well, I don't want to call it perplexing because we all kind of predicted it, but it is still perplexing announcements on vaccines that if you're Senator Bill Cassidy, you really should be probably ashamed at this point.

01:23:56.144 --> 01:23:57.125
But we'll get to that later.

01:23:57.145 --> 01:23:59.107
Before we do, subscribe to the feed.

01:23:59.507 --> 01:24:00.228
Really appreciate it.

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.389
And it's helpful for us.

01:24:01.489 --> 01:24:02.209
Share the stuff.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.271
We're all prisoner to the algorithm.

01:24:04.713 --> 01:24:06.718
All right, Cohen, let's talk.

01:24:06.899 --> 01:24:10.247
There's been like four or five major RFK Jr.

01:24:10.688 --> 01:24:11.309
announcements.

01:24:11.911 --> 01:24:14.056
Not all of them are on vaccines, but the big ones are.

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:24.816
And I just want to kind of go through this list, and then you can give us the real rundown about how serious this is, how much it matters, and why you think he's doing it.

01:24:24.876 --> 01:24:35.401
So the biggest one is, in my estimation, that he is going to be requiring, or he says HHS is going to be requiring, placebo testing for new vaccines.

01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:38.243
This has been something that he has talked about

01:24:38.903 --> 01:24:54.006
Repeatedly prior for new vaccines for new vaccines not for old vaccines for new vaccines properly Tested and so there's a lot of ethical concerns about this What do you make of it?

01:24:54.724 --> 01:24:55.444
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:55.484 --> 01:24:58.306
So I, first of all, I think we can say he doesn't think they're safe.

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:16.214
I mean, he has said that over his career as, you know, along the way, as he has, you know, at various times needed to seem more acceptable, for example, and you were mentioning Senator Cassidy when he needed confirmation votes, he would say things like, well, I'm not anti-vax.

01:25:17.054 --> 01:25:19.335
I want to make sure they're properly tested.

01:25:19.475 --> 01:25:21.296
Yeah, just, you know, we want transparency.

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.477
I just, I want to give people, and in fact,

01:25:23.655 --> 01:25:29.897
It is absolutely positively not by accident that it seems as though they're just able to dunk on him.

01:25:30.637 --> 01:25:34.459
Just able to dunk on CHD, just able to dunk on Brian Hooker.

01:25:34.919 --> 01:25:41.741
But in reality, they are able to dunk on Brian Hooker because Brian Hooker in 2013 did not use the word autism.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.142
He didn't like the word.

01:25:46.647 --> 01:25:56.705
And because Brian Hooker didn't have the principles to stick to it, instead hooked his wagon in his hopes to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:56.745 --> 01:25:59.630
all those years ago and got in a couple movies.

01:26:00.987 --> 01:26:23.013
because he didn't stick to his guns after, you know, he was at the time had 17 years experience transforming and transfecting plants to make medicine, a genetic, you know, biotechnology expert had skepticism about the whole rationale of vaccines and didn't use the word autism, didn't like the word because his son was vaccine injured, vaccine neurologically damaged.

01:26:24.953 --> 01:26:27.254
And if Brian would have stuck to his principles,

01:26:29.326 --> 01:26:37.232
not waited for the promise of a book publishing 10 years later, but have stuck to his principles and said, I don't use the word autism.

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:53.545
We wouldn't be here now in 2025, where CHD is trying to say that they always knew there was a difference between, you know, the unseen profound autism and all these other people that are on YouTube that just have gifts and, you know, are coping with some anxiety.

01:26:56.704 --> 01:27:02.849
And so over the last 20 years, the myth of autism has rolled up all kinds of people into it.

01:27:02.889 --> 01:27:06.532
People with attention deficit disorder and all this other shit.

01:27:06.933 --> 01:27:16.281
And it's encouraged them to call themselves part of this autism spectrum disorder with the specific reason that that hides

01:27:18.871 --> 01:27:25.196
What at the time in 2013, Brian Hooker had the guts to say is not autism.

01:27:25.256 --> 01:27:28.579
It's just vaccine neurological injury.

01:27:28.659 --> 01:27:29.880
My son is damaged.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.903
He made a, he reached a toxic tipping point.

01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:36.786
All things he doesn't say now.

01:27:39.128 --> 01:27:43.952
And it's by design because you know, we got to get Bobby Kennedy in the white house and then they'll write my book.

01:27:47.029 --> 01:27:54.899
and 10 years, and 13 years later, and one pandemic later where Brian Hooker said, yeah, asymptomatic spread is totally real.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.102
Antibodies, definitely important.

01:27:57.462 --> 01:27:59.545
They just need to test these vaccines a little more.

01:27:59.585 --> 01:28:00.787
The numbers are a little low.

01:28:03.496 --> 01:28:04.717
That's how we got here.

01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:22.868
And now, instead of being able to say we've been fighting for something for the last 10 years and it's finally gonna get to a touchdown, we are about to be destroyed by the entire rest of the country that can be shown quite clearly that these people have never been fighting for anything.

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:28.131
It's by design.

01:28:29.532 --> 01:28:30.953
Even if Bobby Kennedy is

01:28:31.972 --> 01:28:46.760
Blissfully unaware that he has been used He has been used and it is probably because of some very specific People that have been whispering in his ears for years like some kind of macabre Truman show You want to be president?

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.020
You want to be president?

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:55.244
I got the perfect way to do it All you got to do is be the health freedom guy, you know Like all these all these just just the health freedom guy.

01:28:55.264 --> 01:28:56.005
You want to be president?

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:57.305
I can do it You know what?

01:28:57.325 --> 01:28:58.446
We're gonna do we're gonna write a book

01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:06.475
I got this guy and his name is, uh, his name is, uh, he's the, he's the, he's the governor of Minnesota.

01:29:06.495 --> 01:29:10.997
We'll write a book with him and we'll put the whole thing in, in a narrative already in 2008.

01:29:11.457 --> 01:29:13.278
And then we're going to find this.

01:29:13.298 --> 01:29:16.559
I got this friend in the UK and we're going to hook you up with him.

01:29:16.579 --> 01:29:22.641
And he's going to come over here in America and make sure that we hit this out of the park, dude, in 10 years, you're going to be everybody's hero.

01:29:28.186 --> 01:29:29.227
Well, not everybody's hero.

01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:46.051
One of his claims is that the vaccines out there have not been adequately tested.

01:29:46.091 --> 01:29:50.354
And he says that's because not every vaccine has gone through placebo testing.

01:29:50.675 --> 01:29:57.680
So the things to realize here is actually most vaccines, the new vaccines do in fact go through placebo testing.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.061
That's part of the process.

01:29:59.081 --> 01:30:04.966
What we're talking about is different iterations of existing vaccines that they are trying to bring to market.

01:30:05.646 --> 01:30:06.267
Right, right.

01:30:07.067 --> 01:30:09.670
So, you know, the latest flu vaccine.

01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:13.633
You know, a new iteration of the new COVID vaccine.

01:30:13.853 --> 01:30:16.335
A new variation on the MMR vaccine.

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:22.381
Now remember, CHD has been shouting from the rooftops that their hero and savior has finally done it.

01:30:22.461 --> 01:30:23.281
Thank goodness.

01:30:24.402 --> 01:30:25.363
Straight from heaven.

01:30:27.425 --> 01:30:28.646
But he hasn't done anything.

01:30:29.987 --> 01:30:31.949
Placebo trials for the new vaccines?

01:30:31.989 --> 01:30:33.030
What does that even mean?

01:30:34.164 --> 01:30:39.008
when for 15 years these people have been reciting the hamster wheel narrative.

01:30:39.028 --> 01:30:41.570
There's no long-term placebo-controlled trials.

01:30:42.831 --> 01:30:46.173
And Paul Offit has been saying exactly what this guy said.

01:30:46.213 --> 01:30:51.618
For the last 15 years, you can't have a placebo-controlled trial when there's a vaccine that already works.

01:30:51.678 --> 01:30:52.979
That's not ethical.

01:30:53.719 --> 01:30:59.464
And around and around we go for 15 years until Bobby Kennedy didn't make it to the White House.

01:31:00.939 --> 01:31:17.949
And now we see that that whole shtick is now gonna unravel, of course, because they're gonna start talking about the unseen profound autism that happens like hours after intramuscular injection or days after intramuscular injection, rapid regression over a couple of weeks.

01:31:18.329 --> 01:31:21.111
They would never need a placebo-controlled trial.

01:31:21.131 --> 01:31:28.395
You can give them both, which we explained a few days ago and just heard crickets because that broke the narrative.

01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:38.399
There has always been an experiment to test vaccines as intramuscular injections, independent of what they are.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.043
And the more vaccines you give, the better.

01:31:44.626 --> 01:31:49.351
And you just give a placebo and a vaccine in a random order.

01:31:51.238 --> 01:31:55.001
And after four weeks between those things, everybody gets their vaccine.

01:31:55.081 --> 01:32:00.225
Nobody was put in danger by not vaccinating and everybody got their placebo.

01:32:00.585 --> 01:32:14.555
And I can guarantee you, if it is done in good faith with active shots and real placebos, there will be no side effects in the placebo group ever, except for maybe some local pain.

01:32:15.996 --> 01:32:23.841
And there will be incredible numbers and varied numbers of effects in those people when they get their hot shots and they'll know it.

01:32:24.702 --> 01:32:26.103
That's the brilliant thing about it.

01:32:26.163 --> 01:32:27.944
You could even design it that way.

01:32:32.127 --> 01:32:36.590
And they could have said this years ago and any doctor that's for vaccines would do it.

01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:41.734
Any doctor that's skeptical of vaccines would obviously see that at least we'd know about SIDS.

01:32:45.885 --> 01:32:51.569
and they could have proposed this question to any of these people at any time from either side and they didn't.

01:32:51.689 --> 01:32:57.093
Instead, we now have Bobby Kennedy at Health and Human Services and I think that's the best they did.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:33:07.581
And sometimes you don't do a placebo test on a vaccine that's been around and you got the new iteration because number one, you can be very confident and safe.

01:33:07.641 --> 01:33:10.584
I mean, how many millions of Americans have gotten

01:33:11.496 --> 01:33:13.497
the MMR or by now the COVID vaccine.

01:33:13.537 --> 01:33:16.518
We have a vast amount of information.

01:33:17.018 --> 01:33:26.661
And by the way, we have probably more information on adverse effects from vaccines than almost any other kind of medication precisely because we watch these so carefully.

01:33:26.941 --> 01:33:30.963
What a remarkable thing to say when you absolutely have no idea.

01:33:32.263 --> 01:33:33.764
That is just crazy, isn't it?

01:33:34.584 --> 01:33:37.085
And that's how this is happening.

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:39.086
This is not a small podcast.

01:33:39.106 --> 01:33:40.146
This is a disaster.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:49.525
They are ramping it up on both sides, driving us farther and farther apart, and more importantly, driving the certainty nail right in as deep as it goes.

01:33:51.566 --> 01:34:00.131
I'm very worried about America, I really am, because they managed to get everybody to believe that there was a novel virus.

01:34:00.211 --> 01:34:04.674
We are still not out of the trap, because these people have failed.

01:34:05.592 --> 01:34:11.275
Because these people are sabotaged or saboteurs or all traitors because it is very simple.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:13.777
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:34:15.178 --> 01:34:18.760
The only person that I can find that said it before me was Brandy Vaughn.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.980
She said it very well.

01:34:20.661 --> 01:34:21.861
She was an excellent presenter.

01:34:21.881 --> 01:34:29.706
I don't know if she was a good guy or a bad guy, but certainly what she said, the biology, the things that she pointed out, they were magnificent.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:43.754
So if somebody wasn't happy with how she is as a dating partner, or somebody doesn't like the way that she sells business cards, I'm kind of skeptical because I like to focus on what Brandy Vaughn taught.

01:34:44.676 --> 01:34:46.197
what Brandy Vaughn's message was.

01:34:46.618 --> 01:34:54.644
And all of these people that I've worked for, all of these people that I've collaborated with over the last five years are no longer interested in what I'm teaching.

01:34:54.684 --> 01:34:57.366
They're just interested in making sure that nobody listens to me.

01:34:57.406 --> 01:35:09.015
I was born in 1998 and virtually every vaccine that he received that could have samarasol, samarasol is the mercury containing organic preservative that they used

01:35:09.716 --> 01:35:17.300
in vaccines and still used in some instances, but he had a very, very high dose of thimerosal in his infant vaccines.

01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:28.727
And then he basically reached a toxic tipping point at about 15 months and regressed into a condition that we will not call autism.

01:35:28.907 --> 01:35:30.448
I don't like the word autism.

01:35:31.348 --> 01:35:32.369
He was vaccine damaged.

01:35:33.348 --> 01:35:46.600
So that's Brian Hooker telling you the truth in 2013, that instead of telling you the truth to save kids from the shot, my daughter came, we came to America and my daughter was born and got two shots on her birthday because I didn't know they were coming.

01:35:49.502 --> 01:35:51.924
And then about a week after she was born, she had a seizure.

01:35:54.126 --> 01:35:57.149
While I wasn't there, I was already away in Portugal teaching a class.

01:35:59.124 --> 01:36:05.126
We had an ambulance come to our house for our third baby, you know, not the first two, but our third baby while she was breastfeeding.

01:36:05.787 --> 01:36:10.529
They said that she was choking, but that's not what, that's not what mom and grandma said.

01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:21.633
And every day that I think about that every day that I think about the fact that I joined CHD and nobody ever talked to me about vaccines.

01:36:21.653 --> 01:36:23.054
They just put me to work on the book.

01:36:26.124 --> 01:36:30.808
It was months after I started working for CHD that they were talking about Vaxxed.

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:32.169
And I said, I never saw that movie.

01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:33.010
And they were like, what?

01:36:35.387 --> 01:36:39.449
That's because Team Worst Case Scenario is what's behind all of this.

01:36:39.509 --> 01:36:51.054
They allowed PCR to become a diagnostic that's used all over the United States now, providing the genetic samples that these people have needed, the remnant stream, and more importantly, the product stream.

01:36:51.754 --> 01:37:02.159
This is done by Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, and Jessica Rose, and Peter McCullough, and Pierre Corey, and all the people that are under them.

01:37:02.919 --> 01:37:11.465
Team Worst Case Scenario, I call them, because they were about Worst Case Scenario, making sure that we never figured out that this was just murder and lies.

01:37:11.986 --> 01:37:14.428
That's what the team Worst Case Scenario's job was.

01:37:14.808 --> 01:37:18.130
But I think we can think our way out if we have the right biology coach.

01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:25.436
It was an anticipated rise and expected death, sculpted by murder, protected by liars,

01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:31.083
And some of them are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I'm afraid.

01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:34.005
Some of them are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:34.045 --> 01:37:38.867
They're behind CHD's long-term, you know, lack of progress.

01:37:39.908 --> 01:37:51.594
And they are behind the social media network that is curating this narrative, that's passing out this horrible script that unfortunately even somebody like Jay Bhattacharya is actually on.

01:37:52.751 --> 01:37:54.612
That's what makes it most disturbing.

01:37:54.792 --> 01:37:57.232
Remember, we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:58.132 --> 01:38:18.478
allowing his name and the good name of HHS to be used to sell syrups and gold and whatever other things that this should have been already discredited and retired and thrown vegetables at for 10 years.

01:38:18.698 --> 01:38:19.418
Dr. Phil,

01:38:21.658 --> 01:38:25.143
Somebody who was brought to me when I was a kid by Oprah Winfrey.

01:38:26.324 --> 01:38:28.407
I mean, this is awful.

01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:34.836
This is discrediting everything that America is, if you see it from the left side of the aisle.

01:38:38.385 --> 01:38:58.428
going on with Jay Bhattacharya talking about, uh, with Dr. Drew all the while behind these people are a, a, a previously run, uh, scheme about the MMR vaccine, where in the end, the very star of the show Vaxxed, her son was cured.

01:39:00.089 --> 01:39:01.649
I didn't hear that in the movie Vaxxed.

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:03.529
I haven't heard that from her at all.

01:39:03.889 --> 01:39:06.130
I didn't hear that, that Secretan cured, uh,

01:39:08.487 --> 01:39:09.187
Any of the kids.

01:39:09.348 --> 01:39:10.889
I've never heard anything about that.

01:39:10.989 --> 01:39:18.613
I've never heard anything about the fact that, that also, uh, that Jenny McCarthy saved her son.

01:39:18.673 --> 01:39:21.295
I didn't know that you could save people from autism.

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.516
I never, I never heard anything about that.

01:39:26.598 --> 01:39:27.939
And yet Billy's our new boy.

01:39:28.799 --> 01:39:29.500
Secret and work.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.082
They even left it out and he regressed and they gave it back to him and then he got better again.

01:39:36.112 --> 01:39:48.643
And this guy used that narrative, used that shtick to get himself close to power, get into the White House, into the executive branch, and this is as far as he got.

01:39:49.664 --> 01:39:50.745
And he is a puppet.

01:39:51.025 --> 01:39:52.886
Otherwise, he would be on NBC News.

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:56.289
Otherwise, he'd be making the phone calls, not going where he's told.

01:39:57.210 --> 01:40:03.736
Just like Jay Bhattacharya would be making his phone calls, he wouldn't be going where he's told and promoting Dr. Drew

01:40:08.544 --> 01:40:09.064
But he is.

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:34.099
And neither of these guys is talking about the very simple biology behind the pandemic, the very simple predictability of the pandemic, the very simple economic explanation for the pandemic, the very simple list of things that explains the alternative to a mystery virus very clearly, including the drop in life expectancy in America.

01:40:34.159 --> 01:40:35.340
But none of these people

01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:43.200
Some of whom I've worked with or been to multiple barbecues with and talked to at length.

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:48.563
They're just doing their role, man.

01:40:50.084 --> 01:40:50.744
I'm shocked.

01:40:52.585 --> 01:40:54.066
I am absolutely shocked.

01:40:54.602 --> 01:40:59.625
Well, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, thanks so much for joining us and taking the time here today.

01:40:59.685 --> 01:41:07.890
So I want to start out because you were in Stanford, California, one of the most beautiful places in the country for decades.

01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:14.754
So what made you want to leave the comfort, the beauty, everything that you knew and loved to join this administration?

01:41:15.464 --> 01:41:20.890
It is an absolute honor to actually use the things I've been working at for decades.

01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:24.293
I was at Stanford for almost 39 years, which is hard to say.

01:41:24.313 --> 01:41:25.415
And it was really hard to leave.

01:41:25.615 --> 01:41:30.240
But what President Trump offered me this chance to lead the NIH

01:41:31.897 --> 01:41:32.558
Who could say no?

01:41:32.998 --> 01:41:36.120
We can use this institution to actually make America healthy.

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.862
Well, that's what I've been working toward my entire career.

01:41:39.963 --> 01:41:41.844
It's a very different environment in D.C.

01:41:41.884 --> 01:41:42.625
than in Stanford.

01:41:42.645 --> 01:41:43.205
I'll grant you that.

01:41:43.365 --> 01:41:46.767
Well, there has been so much to do in so little time, right?

01:41:46.787 --> 01:41:47.428
That's what they say.

01:41:48.228 --> 01:41:51.231
What do you want to get accomplished in your time here?

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:54.453
How would you describe your approach to taking on this job?

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:59.864
So what I want to accomplish is I want so the hiss is from that video, right?

01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:12.874
I know I'm not the best producer of a show But this is the NIH director going on a blaze TV podcast and that's the sound that they're giving us This is an extraordinary level of amateur hour here

01:42:16.758 --> 01:42:23.325
I'm glad you joined the, uh, you, you managed to get here for, for what probably is the best show on the internet right now.

01:42:23.365 --> 01:42:25.247
I don't think anybody does it better than me.

01:42:26.254 --> 01:42:26.914
Thanks for being here.

01:42:27.955 --> 01:42:36.581
To fulfill the mandate that President Trump and Secretary Kennedy gave to me, which is to use the NIH to do the research so that we can understand how to make America healthy.

01:42:37.022 --> 01:42:47.209
So for example, we just launched this major initiative where we're going to get the scientists across the country to actually answer the question, why is autism rising?

01:42:47.729 --> 01:42:48.430
I'm a scientist.

01:42:48.570 --> 01:42:49.991
I don't know the answer to that question.

01:42:50.271 --> 01:42:52.013
And frankly, it's a taboo question.

01:42:52.813 --> 01:42:55.255
I would like to have the NIH

01:42:56.531 --> 01:43:00.292
to essentially get the sides of the country to focus on it.

01:43:00.552 --> 01:43:04.733
And when they focus on it, they will get an answer because we're really good at that if we can do that.

01:43:04.833 --> 01:43:14.195
Yeah, let's dive into autism a little bit more because if you look at it, the last 30 or 40 years, it has now become an epidemic, right?

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:25.118
But how do we go through and as a government just say, okay, we see the rates rising and allow this to go unchecked for now, we're going on decades.

01:43:25.947 --> 01:43:33.029
Well, somehow, the problem with autism is that, first, the rise, when you look back, is just meteoric, right?

01:43:33.069 --> 01:43:41.771
So 1 in 1,000 just maybe a decade ago, or two decades ago, 1 in 10,000, and now 1 in 31 is the latest number.

01:43:43.172 --> 01:43:46.052
But it's one of those things where it's a slow boil, right?

01:43:46.172 --> 01:43:47.453
Where you don't notice it.

01:43:48.413 --> 01:43:50.534
A lot of families just deal with it.

01:43:52.014 --> 01:44:06.183
And then on top of it, there's this overlay of like, if you notice it, that you're somehow anti-science, that somehow you automatically anti-vaccine if you just notice the fact that there are so many more autistic kids than there were when I was a kid.

01:44:09.704 --> 01:44:17.571
You put that together, and what you have is millions of families that don't have an answer to this question, but like, why is my child acting in this way?

01:44:18.172 --> 01:44:19.333
And there's a wide range.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:31.223
There's kids who are high-functioning, lots of friends like that, and they're just, they function a little bit different than other people, but they're like.

01:44:32.685 --> 01:44:35.147
Did he say he has lots of friends like that?

01:44:35.207 --> 01:44:36.048
Did you hear that?

01:44:37.025 --> 01:44:38.511
Did you hear what he just said?

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:40.338
He's got lots of friends like that.

01:44:40.398 --> 01:44:42.145
They're high functioning autistic.

01:44:43.325 --> 01:44:44.125
Holy shit.

01:44:44.405 --> 01:44:46.426
Really just, you know, they're great people.

01:44:46.886 --> 01:44:48.626
All of them are great people, actually.

01:44:48.646 --> 01:44:52.187
But then there's instances of autism where it's very severe.

01:44:53.328 --> 01:44:58.329
And, you know, where people have repetitive motions and they think they're nonverbal.

01:44:58.989 --> 01:45:08.232
And the problem is, like, if scientists can't ask why the rates are rising, then we can't get answers to these families.

01:45:08.912 --> 01:45:10.252
How best can I care for my kids?

01:45:10.733 --> 01:45:10.873
Right?

01:45:10.893 --> 01:45:11.853
That's really the question.

01:45:12.403 --> 01:45:15.605
You mentioned you and Secretary Kennedy are working on this together.

01:45:15.665 --> 01:45:19.086
Now, obviously, if this was simple to solve, we would have already done it.

01:45:19.226 --> 01:45:22.928
So there's not going to be a one-stop-shop approach to this.

01:45:22.948 --> 01:45:28.511
So what benchmarks do the two of you plan on using to measure your progress throughout this?

01:45:28.991 --> 01:45:33.654
Well, so first, we're cutting red tape so that we can actually get an answer, right?

01:45:33.674 --> 01:45:35.896
So the NIH is really good at providing these answers.

01:45:36.016 --> 01:45:43.040
But often, there's so much red tape to make it so that we get the support of the scientists that have the insights to answer the question.

01:45:43.481 --> 01:45:48.924
We're going to gather data from across the country in a way that protects confidentiality of the patients and the patient's rights.

01:45:49.024 --> 01:45:52.106
It's not we're going to go find autistic kids and put them on newspapers.

01:45:52.127 --> 01:45:52.307
No.

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:58.391
What we're going to do is we're going to make sure that the scientists have access to the data so they can actually answer the question.

01:45:59.652 --> 01:46:12.320
The benchmarks will be, in just a few months, we'll have a dozen or more research teams where we chose them competitively from lots of research teams across the country.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.280
We'll put their proposals in.

01:46:13.321 --> 01:46:17.183
We'll choose them competitively to say, okay, who are giving the most promising questions?

01:46:17.503 --> 01:46:18.924
There'll be a range of methods.

01:46:20.225 --> 01:46:28.087
basic science, lab work, to epidemiology, to you name it, and with no holds barred as to the hypothesis, right?

01:46:28.187 --> 01:46:35.668
Whatever the scientists think might be promising as a cause, they'll be allowed to look at, and then we'll have answers for them.

01:46:36.288 --> 01:46:48.631
So raw milk, or honey, or exercise, or the age of the father, or toxic exposure,

01:46:51.875 --> 01:46:56.478
It is, if you can't see it, this might not be the stream for you.

01:46:56.838 --> 01:47:01.982
We'll get them to say, here's what our bottom line is over the course of the year or so.

01:47:02.522 --> 01:47:07.866
I think that a lot of Americans are still just outraged that we don't have any answers for this.

01:47:08.587 --> 01:47:11.188
Another thing that that is true for is COVID-19.

01:47:11.529 --> 01:47:18.994
And if memory serves correctly, your face was on posters all over Stanford's campus back in the day.

01:47:19.014 --> 01:47:19.915
So what was it like?

01:47:20.771 --> 01:47:36.515
to be in your position, knowing the things that you knew, and actually being one of the lone voices that was willing to speak out against this when the rest of the industry was saying, no, you're wrong, and don't say the things that you're saying.

01:47:37.155 --> 01:47:38.837
It was a shocking experience for me.

01:47:39.117 --> 01:47:41.879
I thought that scientists had free speech.

01:47:42.939 --> 01:47:48.564
I thought scientists had academic freedom, and I learned differently during... In fact, probably the biggest problem during COVID was that.

01:47:48.724 --> 01:47:59.932
Like, normally... I might be the only person at a United States medical school that he personally knows was fired for speaking out.

01:48:01.753 --> 01:48:05.416
It's actually possible that besides Martin Kildorff, who he wrote the

01:48:06.269 --> 01:48:13.855
Kulldorff who he wrote that that declaration with and the lady from Oxford Neither of whom I don't think lost their jobs in 2020.

01:48:14.356 --> 01:48:33.592
I'm the only one that he knows He's not a subscriber to the stream he's never donated a dime He has asked me most recently in our last conversations to stop talking about Robert Malone stop naming names Just teach the biology

01:48:35.194 --> 01:48:36.715
I'm going to be NIH director.

01:48:40.516 --> 01:48:47.979
Listen to this guy do an interview and try to believe that he's a good guy, not reading a script that he doesn't understand.

01:48:48.079 --> 01:48:51.700
Try, try your best because that's our only hope.

01:48:54.330 --> 01:48:58.735
If you can't have free speech, then you can't have science, is what I learned.

01:48:59.196 --> 01:49:01.839
And I think that's why we had such bad outcomes with COVID.

01:49:01.859 --> 01:49:08.506
We suppressed... He absolutely told old people that we should dedicate most of the doses to the old people.

01:49:08.827 --> 01:49:09.888
Absolutely he did.

01:49:09.948 --> 01:49:11.450
We should lock down the old people.

01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:25.441
speech of scientists, we suppress speech of the Biden administration, suppress speech of normal Americans who questioned the school closures, the lockdowns, and all the policies that didn't actually protect anybody that yet ended up harming so many people at scale.

01:49:26.341 --> 01:49:27.703
That's actually another one of my priorities.

01:49:27.803 --> 01:49:29.684
I want to restore free speech in science.

01:49:30.204 --> 01:49:35.328
I'm going to put in place policies within the NIH itself so the scientists at the NIH can

01:49:36.209 --> 01:49:36.790
say what they think.

01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:38.471
Maybe they'll disagree with me, that's fine.

01:49:39.552 --> 01:49:45.598
And restore the sense that Americans have that scientists respect their rights.

01:49:45.739 --> 01:49:58.631
We're not trying, a lot of times actually what happened during the Biden administration, you had the scientific institutions in this country funding scientists in order to suppress the free speech rights of Americans.

01:49:59.212 --> 01:50:00.173
It was absolutely shocking.

01:50:00.453 --> 01:50:07.021
President Trump, I think one of the first actions he did was to say no more of that, no more suppression of speech, no more censorship.

01:50:07.521 --> 01:50:16.151
And a big part of that is to make sure the scientific institutions in this country never again play a role of papering over, giving scientific cover to the censoring of speech.

01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:22.766
Yeah, so you along those lines, you have been critical of past NIH admin in the other previous administration.

01:50:22.806 --> 01:50:28.391
So when you look at this, you actually, I believe, called it a culture of cover up, especially around COVID-19.

01:50:29.032 --> 01:50:37.320
So what are some of those things that you want to do that you want to just signal to others that could potentially be in your shoes in the future?

01:50:37.793 --> 01:50:44.799
Well, I mean, I think the cover-up actually, probably the most important element of the cover-up was what caused the pandemic in the first place.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.602
Americans deserve an answer to that question.

01:50:48.182 --> 01:51:02.274
I've seen a lot of evidence from the outside which convinced me that it's very likely that this virus was the result of human experiment, but humans conducting experiments in China primarily, but unfortunately also with some NIH money.

01:51:03.736 --> 01:51:28.653
And support it is not for nothing that I am choosing to display him like this There is a reason a very specific list of reasons why the mystery virus does not equal excess deaths and I've explained it to him many times including on my own stream and Here he is on blaze TV

01:51:32.406 --> 01:51:34.207
I don't know what to say anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:34.227 --> 01:51:35.688
I'm very disturbed at where we are.

01:51:35.708 --> 01:51:36.668
I'm very disturbed.

01:51:36.688 --> 01:51:40.210
Americans deserve to know, the world deserves to know what happened.

01:51:40.931 --> 01:51:49.655
And even more importantly, the Americans deserve to know that our taxpayer money will never again go to doing experiments that have the potential to cause a pandemic.

01:51:50.936 --> 01:51:54.999
And, you know, I think there's lots and lots of action within the administration on this.

01:51:55.059 --> 01:52:01.144
And I've seen just very hopeful signs that we ought to put it... Most scientific research is not like this.

01:52:01.164 --> 01:52:12.072
We're not going to pose a danger of causing like... Now remember, Robert Malone, remember that Robert Malone told us that anybody can do this in their garage now with some equipment they buy on eBay.

01:52:13.445 --> 01:52:29.198
Anyone with a molecular biology undergrad degree or, you know, undergraduate experience in molecular biology can do this in their garage, according to the illustrious Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA vaccines and hero on a white horse with his wife from the UK.

01:52:33.581 --> 01:52:41.628
Something very malevolent is happening in America, ladies and gentlemen, and if we don't become aware of it now and unite against it, they will fracture us

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:45.711
and tear the American government right down to the studs.

01:52:47.432 --> 01:52:49.774
Please help me wake up our children.

01:52:50.074 --> 01:52:51.414
Mass-scale destruction, right?

01:52:51.454 --> 01:52:56.137
We're not generally, you know, exploding nuclear bombs or something.

01:52:56.457 --> 01:53:02.380
But some scientific experiments do have that capacity to do it, not just the gain-of-function work that we were talking about.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:11.265
I want to make sure that the American public can say no to that kind of experimentation, that we use the money responsibly to make America healthy, not put Americans at risk.

01:53:11.710 --> 01:53:19.155
I have to ask you just on a personal note, when you see places like the New York Times coming out and they're like, oh, by the way, it was a lab leak.

01:53:19.996 --> 01:53:29.182
And people were so frustrated for years that it was only like a few voices out there saying, okay, these are the things that could possibly be there.

01:53:29.262 --> 01:53:31.644
And the silencing of information.

01:53:32.124 --> 01:53:37.428
And now to see publications like the New York Times and others come out and just say, oh, we've been here all along.

01:53:37.468 --> 01:53:41.131
We knew what you guys were saying the entire time and count us in that group.

01:53:42.047 --> 01:53:42.829
That's how you know you've won.

01:53:47.492 --> 01:53:48.073
It's unfortunate.

01:53:48.113 --> 01:53:49.834
Again, the censorship was the key thing, right?

01:53:50.295 --> 01:54:04.629
The censoring of voices, the censoring of scientific data, that on the lab leak, on vaccine injury, on the inefficacy of lockdowns, the harms for school kids, all of that, the censorship was the reason why we had the policy failure.

01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:08.132
And we're going to reverse that in this administration.

01:54:08.212 --> 01:54:10.254
We've already worked to reverse that in this administration.

01:54:10.294 --> 01:54:12.056
President Trump has done a fantastic job on this.

01:54:12.759 --> 01:54:17.481
Well, we look at the COVID shots and that's the thing that is still ongoing at this point in time.

01:54:18.161 --> 01:54:20.162
We see all the virus numbers that are out there.

01:54:20.722 --> 01:54:28.785
We see there are still so many unreported side effects that are out there and they're still, you know, in many people's minds, dangerous.

01:54:28.985 --> 01:54:31.746
So are they still on the market right now?

01:54:31.907 --> 01:54:32.867
Is that what they should be?

01:54:32.907 --> 01:54:35.488
Are you going to take steps to address that?

01:54:35.925 --> 01:54:37.587
So that's the FDA's job, right?

01:54:37.627 --> 01:54:47.856
So the kind of job that I'm in charge of at the National Institute of Health is we can, and we will, put in programs so that we can ask questions about vaccine injury.

01:54:48.077 --> 01:54:50.199
Again, these are questions that are normally taboo.

01:54:50.219 --> 01:54:52.341
You have the FDA sometimes

01:54:53.101 --> 01:54:55.423
sort of slowly look at it after the fact.

01:54:56.524 --> 01:54:57.405
Too slow, actually.

01:54:58.085 --> 01:55:01.708
The NIH should be involved in making sure that those questions can get asked.

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:04.451
The scientists can get support for asking them and answering them.

01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:14.959
You know, I think there's going to find a range of, like, I think with the COVID vaccine in young men, there's really good evidence that we cause myocarditis, a heart inflammation in a lot of young men for no reason, really.

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:21.424
The use of the COVID vaccine is really, at this point, I mean, it's very, very low fraction of the population using it.

01:55:22.365 --> 01:55:32.535
I think the FDA's policy, I don't know, I shouldn't speculate where it's headed, but what I'd like to see is more rigorous evaluation before you approve vaccines.

01:55:32.555 --> 01:55:46.029
Because when you're asking millions of healthy people to take it, you want to make sure that you have excellent evidence that you're not harming subgroups of those people and that you actually are preventing the disease you say you want to prevent.

01:55:46.482 --> 01:55:56.367
So will NIH try to go through and fund future studies looking at mRNA and making sure that this is something that we should allow or not allow based on research?

01:55:56.727 --> 01:56:03.751
I think the NIH will absolutely fund studies to understand better the safety profiles of

01:56:04.571 --> 01:56:07.334
new technologies, mRNA among them.

01:56:07.734 --> 01:56:13.099
So I think, but that's, you know, again, the answers are going to be whatever science finds, I'm not going to put a thumb on the scale of it.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.844
I just want to like make sure, make them clear, like a lot of the childhood vaccines are really worthwhile.

01:56:18.864 --> 01:56:23.488
I mean, I gave my kids those childhood vaccines, you know, measles, for instance, right?

01:56:23.869 --> 01:56:26.271
A lot of the childhood vaccines are worthwhile.

01:56:26.391 --> 01:56:27.091
A lot of them.

01:56:27.151 --> 01:56:29.574
What precision, what precision here?

01:56:30.094 --> 01:56:31.375
So I'm not against vaccines.

01:56:31.415 --> 01:56:40.500
What I'm in favor of is that we are honest about when these vaccines aren't working, and that we tell the American people that we've taken an honest look.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:44.402
And that's what the NIH can do, is we can say, let's support research to do that.

01:56:44.707 --> 01:56:55.654
And I think that's all Americans are looking for is a fair shake of everything and not just looking at one bias or another, but just saying here is all of the research and here's the conclusions that we found.

01:56:55.714 --> 01:56:58.977
But we're on our way to making America healthy again.

01:56:59.537 --> 01:57:00.458
Everybody is out there.

01:57:00.538 --> 01:57:02.279
It's all the rage right now.

01:57:02.999 --> 01:57:07.722
And you guys, artificial food dyes are no longer a thing in the United States.

01:57:07.822 --> 01:57:14.407
We are no longer going to have kids having, ingesting petroleum based dyes

01:57:15.207 --> 01:57:19.590
You know, it's funny, some of the pushback I heard was, well, there's no proof that they're harmful.

01:57:20.111 --> 01:57:22.772
Well, why would you give your kids petroleum-based dyes?

01:57:23.553 --> 01:57:31.238
If I were to run a study like that, you'd call it unethical if I randomly inject petroleum-based dyes into kids.

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:38.182
Is that how the NIH director thinks a study on the dangers of a particular dye would be done?

01:57:38.903 --> 01:57:41.885
If it's in food, that we would start with injections?

01:57:46.658 --> 01:58:00.289
If you don't see how much trouble we're in, how incompetent this person who used to call himself my friend obviously is, how way out of his depth he is.

01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:11.819
If he can't even in his own mind, keep ingestion and injection straight with regard to something that is either ingested or injected.

01:58:13.601 --> 01:58:21.946
That is some of the most remarkable dumbassery that I've ever seen in the last five years, and it is frickin' scary.

01:58:22.887 --> 01:58:37.076
Because this guy pretended to be my friend for a couple years, and ultimately tried to burn our friendship because I wouldn't stop talking about Robert Malone, the same guy who apparently got me fired at CHD.

01:58:37.196 --> 01:58:39.818
Mary Holland fired me for talking about him.

01:58:40.838 --> 01:58:42.680
Because that's not selling his books, of course.

01:58:43.968 --> 01:58:46.930
Um, so why are we feeding our kids that at scale makes no sense.

01:58:47.110 --> 01:58:49.392
And red dot, you'd sit, you'd call it unethical.

01:58:49.792 --> 01:58:54.135
If I like randomly inject, uh, put petroleum based dyes into kids.

01:58:54.675 --> 01:58:56.897
Um, so why are we feeding our kids that at scale?

01:58:57.237 --> 01:59:03.922
So you see that he is not even biologically sophisticated enough to understand the contradiction.

01:59:03.942 --> 01:59:09.706
He just spit out the NIH director.

01:59:12.785 --> 01:59:13.986
America needs help.

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:39.288
Because Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland created and enabled a fake populist movement that has absolutely fooled millions of people in America into believing that these people are really who they say they are and they are not.

01:59:43.359 --> 01:59:53.728
the hopes and dreams of thousands of Americans that have been falsely misled and put in the hands of these guys, they are about to be horribly disappointed.

01:59:55.489 --> 02:00:08.540
And also simultaneously discredited and made fun of by the people on the other side of the aisle, on purpose, by design, by this military program, and the other ones that we acquiesce to.

02:00:09.591 --> 02:00:10.451
Makes no sense.

02:00:10.471 --> 02:00:16.974
And Red Dye 3, I remember they said that it was banned from cosmetics decades ago, but it's still safe for you and your food.

02:00:17.014 --> 02:00:17.474
It's OK.

02:00:17.494 --> 02:00:18.354
Don't worry about that.

02:00:18.974 --> 02:00:31.599
In a lot of ways, putting things on your skin that rapidly absorb can be a much faster way to take in a toxin than if you allow it to go through your guts and through all the microbiome and then pass through the liver.

02:00:32.199 --> 02:00:41.708
There's a better chance for a lot of things to be never make their way into you and just pass right through you than if you put it on your skin.

02:00:45.316 --> 02:00:46.177
It's interesting, right?

02:00:46.257 --> 02:00:49.399
Because it's almost like he's not a biologist.

02:00:49.999 --> 02:00:51.680
Oh, wait, that's what he said on my stream.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.461
You're the biologist, Jay.

02:00:53.601 --> 02:00:59.825
I mean, what Dr. McCary, the head of the FDA has said, and he's right, there are alternatives.

02:00:59.845 --> 02:01:02.147
Like you can put beet juice in, if you want red.

02:01:02.247 --> 02:01:03.628
You can put watermelon juice.

02:01:03.668 --> 02:01:04.729
I mean, there's other alternatives.

02:01:05.269 --> 02:01:11.333
The dyes that were approved here in Europe, the same companies sell them with

02:01:11.753 --> 02:01:23.381
When you saw him speak at a conference, Jeff from Earth, you saw him speaking on a script, and it was a very limited script, probably about antibodies and seroprevalence, and those limited scripts were well rehearsed.

02:01:23.481 --> 02:01:28.764
This is not a rehearsed script, and he is not adapting quick enough.

02:01:30.245 --> 02:01:37.710
Beet juice with watermelon juice with actual natural ingredients rather than petroleum-based products.

02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:39.771
All right, final question for you.

02:01:40.032 --> 02:01:42.174
It's just about D.C., about the swamp.

02:01:43.015 --> 02:01:46.238
What's life been like for you in these last few weeks?

02:01:46.838 --> 02:01:49.241
It's been, it feels, it's probably been a month.

02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:53.445
I've been in office and it feels like it's been four years.

02:01:53.605 --> 02:01:54.866
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:54.906 --> 02:02:02.394
and Jay Bhattacharya are no more important than the mouse, the guy in the mouse costume at Chuck E. Cheese's.

02:02:04.204 --> 02:02:05.506
Maybe he sets the tone.

02:02:06.487 --> 02:02:08.911
Maybe he makes everybody happy when they sit down.

02:02:08.951 --> 02:02:20.067
But if the pizza sucks, or the fries are cold, or the drinks are watered down, or one of the kids is crying the whole time, then the birthday party is going to suck.

02:02:22.898 --> 02:02:24.079
That's all these guys are.

02:02:24.119 --> 02:02:25.601
They don't have any real power.

02:02:26.082 --> 02:02:29.526
It's feels like four years, but it's only been four weeks.

02:02:29.646 --> 02:02:30.347
Bullshit.

02:02:31.067 --> 02:02:31.768
Bullshit.

02:02:32.129 --> 02:02:34.712
And that's why he's on with Dr. Drew.

02:02:35.072 --> 02:02:38.055
And that's why he's doing the rounds with all the rumble people.

02:02:38.456 --> 02:02:39.137
Come on.

02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:44.901
But it's exhilarating, actually.

02:02:44.981 --> 02:02:54.424
And it's also this sense of great responsibility that I want to use the power the NIH has, which is really to induce excellent science for the benefit of the American people.

02:02:54.484 --> 02:03:03.307
That's what I, at the end of my time here, and eventually will end, I hope I can look back and say, yeah, we really did the work that made America healthier.

02:03:03.729 --> 02:03:08.873
I think that if you're able to do that, the American people will be very, very happy with that.

02:03:08.933 --> 02:03:09.774
Thanks so much for your time.

02:03:09.914 --> 02:03:10.335
Thank you.

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.262
It's possible to understand what really happened.

02:03:20.323 --> 02:03:22.145
It would have been possible for them to tell you.

02:03:23.786 --> 02:03:25.347
There is slave speak out there though.

02:03:25.367 --> 02:03:27.009
There's a lot of mythology out there.

02:03:27.029 --> 02:03:28.130
You got to reject it all.

02:03:28.210 --> 02:03:29.010
None of it's real.

02:03:29.811 --> 02:03:30.712
It's all an illusion.

02:03:31.897 --> 02:03:33.137
Virology is an illusion.

02:03:33.157 --> 02:03:34.318
The PCR is an illusion.

02:03:34.338 --> 02:03:36.319
Intramuscular injection is an illusion.

02:03:36.619 --> 02:03:38.519
The vaccine schedule is an illusion.

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.841
Language is even an illusion, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:41.861 --> 02:03:46.442
And that's why acquiescing to scrolling on social media is incredibly dangerous.

02:03:47.163 --> 02:03:50.964
You cannot surrender your thoughts to social media anymore.

02:03:51.064 --> 02:03:52.705
Get off social media.

02:03:52.745 --> 02:03:53.665
Get on Soapbox.

02:03:53.725 --> 02:03:54.826
Make your own Soapbox.

02:03:54.866 --> 02:03:55.746
Get on PeerTube.

02:03:56.286 --> 02:03:57.547
Make your own PeerTube.

02:03:57.647 --> 02:03:59.667
Please, ladies and gentlemen, it's cheap.

02:03:59.727 --> 02:04:00.188
It's easy.

02:04:00.248 --> 02:04:01.048
You can do it too.

02:04:01.788 --> 02:04:05.070
Let's start our own independent bright web ladies and gentlemen.

02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:10.493
Thanks for being here Thanks for all of your time and all of your thoughtful thoughts.

02:04:10.693 --> 02:04:17.817
Thank you for your support I'm gonna play out with a different song today just for fun Thanks for being here guys

02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:57.215
on a western bay and it serves a hundred ships a day lonely sailors pass the time away and talk about their homes and there's a girl in this harbor town and she works laying whiskey down they say brandy

02:04:58.226 --> 02:04:59.747
fetch another round.

02:05:00.367 --> 02:05:02.628
She serves them whiskey and wine.

02:05:03.248 --> 02:05:06.989
The sailors say, Brandy, you're a fine girl.

02:05:07.089 --> 02:05:10.150
What a good wife you would be.

02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:15.932
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea.

02:05:15.972 --> 02:05:16.412
Brandy,

02:05:21.212 --> 02:05:39.371
wears a braided chain made of finest silver from the north of spain a locket that bears the name of a man that brandy loved he came on a summer's day bringing gifts

02:05:40.808 --> 02:06:02.098
Far away, but he made it clear He couldn't stay, no horror was his heart They said, they said, Rainville, you're a fine girl What a good wife you would be But my love, my love of my lady is the same

02:06:05.465 --> 02:06:32.263
Brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor's story She could feel the ocean fall and rise She saw its rage and glory But he had always told the truth, thought he was an honest man And Brandy does her best to understand

02:06:36.283 --> 02:07:03.453
At night, when the bars close down Brandy walks through a silent town And loves a man who's not around She still can't hear him say She hears him say, Brandy, you're a fine girl What a good wife you would be But my life, my love of my lady is the same

02:07:12.145 --> 02:07:14.767
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for joining me.

I'm not going to stream to YouTube.

02:07:29.702 --> 02:07:31.183
I didn't stream to YouTube today again.

02:07:31.263 --> 02:07:31.563
Darn it.

02:07:31.583 --> 02:07:32.905
I keep forgetting to open that window.

02:07:33.585 --> 02:07:35.127
