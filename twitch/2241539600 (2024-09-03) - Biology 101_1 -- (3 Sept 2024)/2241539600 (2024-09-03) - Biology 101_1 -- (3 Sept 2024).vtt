01:42.600 --> 01:43.320
I guess I do.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.501
Man, I'm sorry.

01:44.541 --> 01:45.621
I'm trying to figure this out.

01:45.661 --> 01:51.563
I wanted to do it a little different, but I guess I really actually still have to do... I could do the desk quick, right?

01:51.623 --> 01:52.483
That also works.

01:53.023 --> 01:53.604
Does that work?

01:55.044 --> 01:55.664
Can I do that?

01:55.824 --> 01:56.024
No.

01:56.164 --> 01:56.965
See, that doesn't work.

01:57.045 --> 01:57.985
I also have to do this.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.007
Good morning, everybody.

02:02.648 --> 02:04.470
Good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:04.630 --> 02:06.252
It is 1010 in the morning.

02:06.312 --> 02:06.732
It's actually 1012.

02:08.714 --> 02:16.361
I apologize if you expected music today we are having our first biology 101 class so I don't think we need a big intro or anything like that.

02:16.381 --> 02:18.864
I just wanted to give everybody a chance to respond to the

02:20.344 --> 02:24.207
to the email or whatever, the notification, if you are lucky enough to get them.

02:25.908 --> 02:27.489
My plan is to kind of wing it.

02:28.569 --> 02:36.254
This is a course that cannot be developed by myself in a room, deciding what to put where and what goes.

02:36.274 --> 02:41.457
I mean, at certain moment, it just has to be done and a real quality

02:42.639 --> 02:51.021
let's say freshman level biology course with a new tact on biology is going to take a few iterations to sharpen.

02:51.341 --> 03:01.603
And so after a really long time of thinking that I could get it perfect before doing it, I've decided that this is the deadline.

03:01.643 --> 03:04.083
Today was the day, the 3rd of September.

03:04.163 --> 03:08.864
This is the first, I guess, kind of pseudo full week of school for my family.

03:10.629 --> 03:20.553
One of my kids may transition very soon into being a homeschooled kid, and the other one is having an interesting adjustment to his first year in high school.

03:21.253 --> 03:25.275
And of course, the younger one is still just having a really good time seeing those kids every day.

03:25.355 --> 03:33.939
So I do have free time every day now during the week that I think I'm more than obligated to fill with reasonable work.

03:35.259 --> 03:54.268
And so that reasonable work that I think in the long run is going to pay off the most is going to be trying to go back to my strengths, which is, I think, as a biology coach, as somebody who can help people to think more usefully and more critically about their own biology, the biology around them, and how

03:55.494 --> 03:58.197
that fits into health and well-being and all this other stuff.

03:58.237 --> 04:02.101
Now, I don't consider myself a guru or a master of any of this stuff.

04:03.302 --> 04:16.916
I just think that because I have been thinking about these things for as long as I have, both as a naive child and a naive teenager and a naive young adult and a naive Akata magician wannabe,

04:18.131 --> 04:25.756
Throughout my life, this journey has been a journey of humility and realizing how little I know and understand.

04:26.877 --> 04:37.764
And that is something you have to almost shed in a way in order to become part of this academy that people want tenure in.

04:38.725 --> 04:46.450
And so as a recovering Academician, I think I have a really unique take and as a lifelong

04:48.604 --> 04:58.408
enthusiast of sharing my enthusiasm for biology in the form of teaching, I guess, I've decided that this is probably the best way forward for me.

04:58.788 --> 05:12.954
And although I continue to be regularly affected by social media and the people that I have met in social media during the pandemic and the kind of

05:14.187 --> 05:17.650
sort of coordinated lying that I've become aware of on the internet.

05:17.690 --> 05:25.016
I don't think that that message really has much more value in the sense of we've really, you know, we've said it, I've said it, it's documented.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.577
I have it all in my notebooks.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.060
I have all the screenshots and everything.

05:30.100 --> 05:36.025
And so if we ever want to write a book or we ever want to put it together or we ever want to put out a database of that history, we can do it.

05:36.926 --> 05:40.869
And so now I think what's more important is to realize that we need a ladder out

05:41.866 --> 05:45.388
And so I don't really know how to begin other than to just begin.

05:45.528 --> 05:52.413
So I'm gonna attempt to just begin here.

05:54.314 --> 05:56.055
So I have a few ideas.

05:57.016 --> 05:58.037
See, there we go already.

05:58.097 --> 05:59.178
I'm goofing around.

06:00.037 --> 06:07.120
I have a few ideas about what I want to talk about and a few things that I want to cover as an introduction.

06:07.180 --> 06:19.466
And typically speaking, in a Biology 101 class, the introduction is just going to be something to get everybody started, to put everybody on the same page, and to lay out what people call themes.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.908
Themes of understanding, this kind of thing.

06:22.948 --> 06:24.629
And I want to change some of these.

06:24.669 --> 06:25.729
Sorry for the reflection there.

06:25.749 --> 06:26.970
I guess I chose the wrong ink.

06:29.674 --> 06:47.925
The idea of themes versus patterns, I think we're going to come back to this a lot, because a lot of the inspiration for this is going to be this book back here, which is Buckminster Fuller's To the Children of Earth book.

06:48.506 --> 06:51.388
Very simple book, not a lot of words in it.

06:51.408 --> 06:55.170
So, you know, if you can find a digital copy of this one, you're not going to probably find a

06:56.024 --> 07:03.217
paper copy of it because it's a pretty rare book and it's pretty valuable because a lot of the, I mean, it's just a very rare book.

07:03.918 --> 07:07.123
But you can find a PDF of it and we will discuss parts of it.

07:09.810 --> 07:27.575
Buckminster Fuller has been one of the more recent influences in my life as far as biology goes, reading his words and reading his books, especially synergistics, synergetics, which is, I always say it wrong.

07:29.355 --> 07:31.416
That book, I'm about a third of the way through.

07:31.456 --> 07:33.636
I'm not saying that I've completed it and mastered it.

07:33.656 --> 07:34.177
It's really easy.

07:34.217 --> 07:53.163
It's an extraordinary book, but it shows you how really masterful, high-level thinkers are pretty much excluded from this debate, simply because, again, very high-level thinkers are often very aware of how inadequate

07:53.943 --> 08:04.768
the models of our biology are, the models of our natural world are, and the way that those very inadequate models can be sort of used malevolently against us.

08:05.648 --> 08:19.835
And I don't necessarily, I'm not saying that Buckminster Fuller is some kind of crusader, I'm just saying that he's a guy whose words have had a lot of influence on me in very recent years, like the last four years, as I've become aware

08:20.836 --> 08:27.413
of how much of my perceived understanding of biology was

08:28.996 --> 08:35.958
was really founded on these inverted principles of what I now come to understand as reverence.

08:36.018 --> 08:41.359
So let's just try to get through this with some degree, you know, within an hour or so.

08:41.439 --> 08:44.319
So the first thing I have on the list is trees versus genomes.

08:45.280 --> 08:55.202
And the reason why I have that on there is because one of the things that I want to open the course with is some texts, which normally we would start with a biology textbook, right?

08:55.222 --> 08:55.642
But I think

08:56.343 --> 09:15.424
The most important thing to do if you're going to teach a real biology 101 class from the ground up, and if I was going to teach it to my kids, for example, 12 and 14-year-old boys, I would start with a text like this, Man and His Future, a book written in 1963 by a collection of authors

09:17.546 --> 09:38.682
that include Julian Huxley and Joshua Lederberg and Hilary Kaprowski, not necessarily because this is a particularly wonderful work of literature from the time, but because I think one of the most important themes, sorry, I don't want to use themes, one of the most important patterns to understand

09:39.603 --> 09:57.135
is that the ideas that we continue to focus on in the last decades in biology were laid down before we had any reasonable expectation for what we would find on the other side of these ideas.

09:58.226 --> 10:05.209
And I think that's why we need to go back to the history of these biological ideas to understand why we are so trapped within them.

10:06.130 --> 10:13.233
And that might now sound too disconnected, but let me go back to the list that I have here, trees and genomes.

10:14.074 --> 10:22.498
It used to be that it was quite smart to make the statement that wise men plant trees under whose shade they will never shelter.

10:23.726 --> 10:27.849
meaning that wise men plant trees for the kids.

10:27.969 --> 10:30.210
They plant trees because they're planning ahead.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.732
They know what's going to happen when that tree is mature.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.072
They have a plan.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.014
That's why they put the tree there.

10:37.715 --> 10:52.744
And that idea of planting trees, of, you know, looking at the world as something that you're only a part of for a little while, and then you pass on to the next generation is a sort of,

10:53.925 --> 10:56.027
humbling philosophy.

10:56.968 --> 11:05.315
And it puts man and his contributions to the world more like that of a gardener, where if you take the gardener away from the garden, the garden goes wild, right?

11:06.376 --> 11:07.417
And the weeds win.

11:08.978 --> 11:15.844
And so it puts this onus on the generations of humans to take care of the earth, to take care of their future.

11:17.188 --> 11:40.886
And these people in this book have taken that philosophy and turned it into the genomes that we send to the next generation are something that we need to worry about rather than the trees we plant or the soil that we inherit or we bequeath to our children or the environment that we give to them or the history that we give to them.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.307
or the culture that we give to them.

11:43.367 --> 11:46.168
Now we're talking about particularly genomes.

11:46.228 --> 11:57.512
Now, I would like to read to you the text in the beginning of this and then maybe a couple pieces from the first chapter as a way of, you know, supplementing our beginning understanding to this.

11:57.572 --> 12:01.294
So, at the beginning of this book, it says, Man and His Future.

12:01.354 --> 12:05.896
This book should make people think biological research is an affirmant

12:06.556 --> 12:14.882
creating and promising methods of interference with natural processes which could transform or destroy nearly every aspect of human life that we value.

12:15.803 --> 12:22.428
Intelligent individuals of every race, color, and creed must consider the present and imminent possibilities for mankind.

12:24.477 --> 12:35.022
Man must be prepared to defend those principles which he believes good, and more importantly, to use the present immense opportunities, creative opportunities, for a happier and healthier world.

12:35.603 --> 12:43.327
These words sound on their face as being fairly innocuous, but they are actually incredibly racist.

12:43.927 --> 12:45.488
They are incredibly eugenic.

12:46.788 --> 12:47.489
And they, they,

12:50.848 --> 12:59.422
are a very fun-facing version of a philosophy that there are only certain people that are intelligent enough to see this.

13:00.438 --> 13:08.020
There are only certain people who are intelligent enough to understand the responsibility that is codified in these words.

13:08.140 --> 13:10.540
And the rest of the people are just useless eaters.

13:10.600 --> 13:22.862
The rest of the people will never be able to understand the responsibility that the universe has given mankind in its ability to understand itself and therefore direct its evolution.

13:22.942 --> 13:25.183
This myth, mythology,

13:27.418 --> 13:34.202
put forth by people like Joshua Lederberg, Hilary Kaprowski, this Julian Huxley guy, and lots more like them.

13:34.643 --> 13:53.255
This is not the only book, but it's a wonderful version of this philosophy, and it has a lot of different people involved with it, which I think is better than, say, reading a book that's written by only one of these people, which is there's, let me just, there is another book, which I think is really important.

13:53.295 --> 13:54.395
I should have brought it over here.

13:55.016 --> 13:56.717
Probably had it on my stack already.

13:58.551 --> 14:19.117
um there's a couple actually you know you can look at I mean we can go go on and on about what books should be at the beginning of of one of these discussions but what we need to understand is that it's been more than a couple decades then that people have been already speaking in the way of

14:20.317 --> 14:35.195
of Ray Kurzweiler where they make predictions about the fact that well we already have automobiles so soon we're going to have automobiles where the wheels turn upside down and we just fly off into space and when we get to 88 miles an hour we'll be able to travel through time.

14:36.929 --> 14:54.013
And these people very particularly have been telling stories about these kinds of coming decisions and coming sort of societal level choices that we're going to have to make as we are confronted with the inevitable that, you know, we're going to end up with the controls.

14:54.833 --> 14:58.534
And so the question only is, what are we going to do with those controls?

15:00.740 --> 15:13.432
And those mythologies, I'm afraid, ladies and gentlemen, are also at the heart of every biological 101 introductory class at every university in America and probably around the Western world.

15:14.493 --> 15:25.763
Because over the last 20 years, this group of men and women that are behind these ideas have slowly

15:26.690 --> 15:41.257
transformed our understanding of ourselves from a reverence to a kind of indifference or even worse.

15:42.798 --> 15:48.921
And so I think it is really important to understand that a philosophy has been essentially inverted.

15:48.941 --> 15:55.825
The philosophy of, you know, wise men plant trees under whose shade they will never shelter or whatever the exact quote was.

15:57.017 --> 16:08.786
versus the idea that man very soon, if not already, has within his responsibility space the ability to control evolution.

16:08.826 --> 16:10.928
The only question is, are we going to do it or not?

16:12.269 --> 16:23.438
The only question is, are we going to put our big boy pants on and take the wheel and direct the evolution of mankind and maybe the entire biosphere that we see ourselves involved in?

16:23.478 --> 16:25.159
It's all ours for the taking.

16:26.843 --> 16:36.597
Instead of thinking about planting trees, we should think about changing them and reorganizing them and sort of usurping them for our own uses.

16:38.809 --> 16:56.223
And this, I believe, is a philosophical change that you can see if you go way back in time and you look at books like this, which are books from the 1800s that are from, you know, schools in the Netherlands where you're doing animal and plant sciences.

16:56.964 --> 17:00.066
And you look at how they are thinking about these things.

17:00.106 --> 17:07.672
They are not thinking about these things as having anything more than similarities in their patterns.

17:07.773 --> 17:08.033
Yes.

17:09.520 --> 17:13.743
A lot of these higher organisms, these higher pattern integrities have cells.

17:15.264 --> 17:27.254
But in the 1800s, in the early 1900s, we were never so arrogant as to think that that was sufficient to say that if we understand the cells in one animal, we understand most of what everything else does.

17:29.249 --> 17:38.174
And that, of course, has been part of the oversimplification and the way that biology has been done, so to speak.

17:38.774 --> 17:46.057
And that has changed, because if you look at these old books and read these old books, you will not feel this same lack of reverence.

17:46.137 --> 17:48.719
Instead, it will always seem like, wow, it's overwhelming.

17:49.419 --> 17:52.981
You turn over another leaf, and there's another animal there that you never expected.

17:55.002 --> 17:57.223
And so that kind of wonder

17:59.449 --> 18:24.541
potential is gone now and that's on purpose because again what I'm suggesting is that what you have in a biology 101 textbook is actually philosophy organized by guys like this and based on ideas from guys like these guys who all talk about how very soon if not right now mankind will have the ability to

18:25.629 --> 18:28.890
to direct his evolution or our evolution.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.790
And so the question is, who's going to do it?

18:33.531 --> 18:37.052
Are Americans and the Americans going to have the guts to do it?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.872
Or are we going to wait until communist China does it?

18:39.932 --> 18:46.474
It's probably a ongoing discussion that happens in lanyard secret meetings.

18:48.914 --> 18:51.735
And that is from the same idea set here.

18:52.642 --> 19:12.288
that we are on the verge, as Ray Kurzweiler says, of getting rid of disease and having immortality and being able to upload our brains to a computer or whatever else they say, is not any dissimilar to, at this time, having been talking about how, in the very near future, we're going to have flying cars.

19:15.976 --> 19:18.780
By now, we should have had flying cars, but we don't have them.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.603
By now, we should have cured all diseases.

19:20.683 --> 19:30.258
By now, there should have been a geneticist in every hospital curing childhood diseases with retroviruses if you would have believed these guys back then.

19:33.911 --> 19:39.774
And so this philosophy is still present inside of every biological textbook.

19:39.815 --> 19:47.559
And that's kind of the big giant problem that I'm trying to confront by starting this course.

19:47.619 --> 19:54.143
And so that's why there isn't gonna be a real clear momentum in the beginning.

19:55.049 --> 20:10.113
because we really need to establish how different it is what we're attempting to do here and how we still have to look at what we've observed and look at the observations that have been made over the last 200 years and reinterpret them, reassemble them.

20:12.774 --> 20:18.196
Because otherwise we're in danger of, you know, again, just having this chaos and confusion

20:19.332 --> 20:30.395
spread over the next 3, 4, 5, 10 years to the point where everything that we have built and have achieved will be lost.

20:33.096 --> 20:35.797
I mean, I don't want to sound overly dramatic, but I think it's very important.

20:35.817 --> 20:44.780
And so that's probably where themes versus patterns comes in, because in a typical biological textbook, they're going to talk about themes

20:45.794 --> 20:56.277
One of the themes they talk about, for example, in a biological textbook is the properties that emerge as you talk about different levels of organization.

20:56.337 --> 20:59.038
And it depends on which way we talk about it here.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.619
So we're here on themes and patterns now.

21:05.004 --> 21:13.587
And, and the idea would be then in biological textbooks, they might do something like, um, biosphere, which would be the whole earth.

21:14.867 --> 21:19.068
Um, what do they do then they do like, I guess they say ecosystem next.

21:20.208 --> 21:32.572
They might say inside of the ecosystem, our communities and then, uh, communities are made up of what, um, um, um, um, I think populations.

21:34.963 --> 21:36.224
And then populations are what?

21:36.304 --> 21:36.925
Individuals.

21:37.045 --> 21:37.986
Do they say individuals?

21:38.066 --> 21:38.507
Oh, yeah.

21:38.547 --> 21:38.747
Sorry.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.349
We just say, of course, organisms.

21:43.833 --> 21:50.240
And so these are different levels of organization, and you can ask biological questions in this

21:51.832 --> 21:59.340
In this thematic, you can ask biological questions about the biosphere, about the ecosystem, or about communities, populations, organisms.

21:59.961 --> 22:07.528
These are different levels of organization, and at these different levels, different aspects of biology emerge.

22:08.601 --> 22:24.635
And so you might suggest for example that in populations is where selection occurs in their mythologies, so that animals that are that are, you know, fat and slow they get eaten and animals that are very strong and fast they have a lot of babies and so then the population moves.

22:25.276 --> 22:27.677
towards strong and fast instead of fat and slow.

22:28.157 --> 22:31.379
That happens at this level, it doesn't necessarily happen at this level.

22:31.439 --> 22:36.441
That's the kind of thing that typically gets established in a biology 101 class.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.022
So then after organisms, then we have organs.

22:40.223 --> 22:42.444
And then we have tissues, I think, and then cells.

22:46.451 --> 22:54.313
And so the idea, of course, is to start everybody off at understanding cells and thinking about cells.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.393
I'm going to see if I can move this camera over here.

22:59.474 --> 23:02.575
And so the idea is to start everybody here at cells.

23:03.035 --> 23:13.297
And again, as I started out a while ago already saying, the trick that a lot of Biology 101 students fall into and the professors

23:14.710 --> 23:23.875
trap them in wittingly or unwittingly is the idea that cells is a way of generalizing across animals.

23:24.915 --> 23:33.439
And so you might very easily as a biology 101 student say that, well, there's lungs in a fox and there's lungs in a human.

23:33.819 --> 23:38.662
And so lung cells in a human and lung cells in a fox must be almost, I mean, they're identical, right?

23:40.459 --> 23:48.744
and they serve the same purpose, but the chances of them being organized identically at the cellular level is reasonably high.

23:49.424 --> 23:55.488
The idea of them being organized the same identically at the molecular level is much lower.

23:57.338 --> 24:12.986
And that's where this generalization becomes dangerous, especially from the perspective of a academy that wittingly or unwittingly is not going to emphasize this shortcoming.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.088
And I think, I just want to read this.

24:17.128 --> 24:20.010
I had this one little book open here because I wanted to read this.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.791
This is actually from a Biology 101 textbook.

24:25.091 --> 24:30.913
And it's funny that they say it because they should repeat this on every page of the book, but of course they don't.

24:30.953 --> 24:34.754
But it's nice that the author of this chapter says it here.

24:35.394 --> 24:43.437
But zooming in through the levels of the biological hierarchy at ever finer resolution illustrates an approach called reductionism.

24:44.077 --> 24:46.478
Maybe I can put this under the camera so you can see what I'm reading.

24:52.796 --> 25:02.822
because this is really the foundation of both what everybody believes works and then also what everybody gets confused about.

25:02.902 --> 25:10.927
So, zooming in through the levels of biological hierarchy at every final resolution illustrates an approach called reductionism.

25:11.468 --> 25:18.012
This method is so named because it reduces complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study.

25:18.806 --> 25:22.087
Reductionism is a powerful strategy in biology.

25:22.127 --> 25:25.729
It's a powerful strategy for codifying how to write a grant.

25:25.769 --> 25:31.692
It's a powerful strategy for doing a null hypothesis-based experiment on p-values.

25:31.792 --> 25:42.496
It is a powerful strategy for creating the illusion of progress and creating the illusion of revealed knowledge, but it's not.

25:43.557 --> 25:45.698
And this is how science is broken.

25:46.886 --> 26:02.033
And that's really where we are starting with this course, is at the point where the methodology by which these various hierarchical resolutions are probed is incorrect.

26:03.027 --> 26:13.231
So, for example, by studying the molecular structure of DNA that has been extracted from cells, James Watson and Francis Crick inferred the chemical basis of biological inheritance.

26:13.291 --> 26:25.796
Reductionism has propelled many major discoveries and it provides a necessarily incomplete, uh-oh, but it provides a necessarily incomplete view of life on Earth.

26:26.276 --> 26:29.157
It's not an incomplete view, it is an uncertain view.

26:30.302 --> 26:42.584
Because again, here, with a specific semantic strategy, you can make it seem like reductionism and experiments done in a reductionist context are making progress.

26:43.604 --> 26:45.285
But they are not making progress.

26:45.345 --> 26:57.807
They are making assumptions and then allowing people to feel as though those assumptions can be the basis of further assumptions.

26:59.407 --> 26:59.907
And if that

27:01.798 --> 27:18.503
strategy is not used in with incredible, with incredible critique, and the model upon which those experiments is not immediately dismissed when not validated, then you have the potential for for extreme danger.

27:20.963 --> 27:24.164
I want to try and do a put this back under here.

27:26.125 --> 27:26.425
I want to

27:28.700 --> 27:32.823
I want to do a kind of thought experiment here to think about this.

27:35.706 --> 27:46.154
One of the reasons why they think that DNA encodes everything is that when they move the DNA from one place to another, then everything goes with the DNA.

27:46.615 --> 27:50.938
I want you to think about this analogy that is, of course, not very good, but it's better than nothing.

27:52.700 --> 27:57.224
If I had a book and I put it in people's houses,

27:58.399 --> 28:06.944
And then a certain percentage of the people that live in those houses changed their behavior after I put the book in the house.

28:09.365 --> 28:14.047
Let's say that all the people in the house changed their behavior because I put the book in the house.

28:15.048 --> 28:26.014
What about the book would you understand as a result of moving the book from one house to another and seeing that the behavior changed in a similar way from one house to the next?

28:27.782 --> 28:28.562
What would that be?

28:30.323 --> 28:31.644
What would you know about the book?

28:31.724 --> 28:33.564
What would you know about how the book worked?

28:34.505 --> 28:36.265
Would you know that the book was a romance?

28:37.086 --> 28:39.207
Or would you think it was a nonfiction book?

28:40.047 --> 28:44.089
What if everybody in the house that got the book started eating grilled cheese?

28:45.269 --> 28:46.670
Would you know what the book said?

28:47.690 --> 28:52.072
Would you know how the book convinced everybody in those houses to start eating grilled cheese?

28:54.062 --> 29:18.269
And so the idea that we understand how the pattern integrity works, because we can move these molecules from one place to another, and then the pattern integrity seems to remain intact, is as silly as thinking that if we take a book and we move it from one house to another, the pattern of those people behaves similarly, that we understand what the book says.

29:20.908 --> 29:33.972
It could be a romance novel about a couple that falls in love based on grilled cheese and then the effect of the novel affects everybody that reads it in the house to think grilled cheese is something they have to eat in order to meet the love of their life.

29:35.312 --> 29:41.834
It could also be a book about the nutritional value of grilled cheese and a very convincing one.

29:45.632 --> 29:57.338
And so it could also just be a book of photographs that makes grilled cheese look so tasty that the photographer is so talented that no matter what, when you see these pictures, you can't help but want grilled cheese for a few weeks.

30:00.079 --> 30:06.322
And so we must understand from the very beginning of the course that the enticing thing

30:08.217 --> 30:19.003
that all of these people have put in all of the biological idea trains, all of the mentor trains, all of the trainerships.

30:19.903 --> 30:31.430
Everybody like me has been led to believe that it's just a matter of years and just a matter of keeping to the grind before all the details are known.

30:33.757 --> 30:38.866
And Biology 101 is always designed to get you to believe that we're almost there.

30:40.769 --> 30:47.139
By generalizing and reducing an irreducible complexity to a few layers.

30:49.827 --> 30:52.391
And those layers are considered themes.

30:52.691 --> 30:57.197
If you understand those themes, then you understand how cells work everywhere.

30:57.798 --> 31:01.904
You understand how tissues work everywhere, how organs work.

31:02.384 --> 31:04.808
That makes sense, so I get it.

31:06.681 --> 31:07.721
But you really don't.

31:08.462 --> 31:17.105
What you are seeing is the infinite complexity being kind of loosely organized around different layers of complexity.

31:17.545 --> 31:24.928
And as has been described here, it provides a necessarily incomplete view of life on Earth.

31:28.149 --> 31:29.550
Not a

31:31.614 --> 31:35.678
Useful rubric to understand it all really easily like here's a rubric.

31:35.718 --> 31:48.729
I understand all the tools in the toolbox No The wrenches are down there and the ratchets are up here and anything in English system is here and the metric is over here.

31:48.789 --> 31:59.358
No What this is is a palette with more and more colors and more and more flavors and more and more permutations that yes

32:00.779 --> 32:05.483
Consistencies across these pattern integrities can help us understand them, yes.

32:08.626 --> 32:12.669
But inevitably each one of these is gonna be a phenomenon in and of themselves.

32:12.729 --> 32:20.316
And that pattern and themes or patterns across patterns are still only going to be that.

32:21.457 --> 32:23.859
And our model must always verify on that.

32:23.959 --> 32:27.943
And our models are very easy to verify if we use a reductionist model.

32:29.383 --> 32:48.555
That's the whole reason why that progress is false, that feels false, because when you eliminate all the other variables, and I've done this analogy before as well, the idea when you eliminate all the other variables and you just look at one thing and think that you're describing something is often what we're doing in biology.

32:48.595 --> 32:53.258
At any one of these levels that we're purporting to understand, we're ignoring all the other levels.

32:55.151 --> 33:23.741
And so if I wanna become an expert in the phenomenon of automobile biology, and I'm really focused on the exhaust and the composition of the exhaust that comes out of that back tube, and I have already demonstrated after a long career of science, that there is a correlation between the contents of that vapor that comes out and the gases that come out of the back of that thing, and how fast the car is moving, how long the car has been on, and what they recently put in it.

33:25.154 --> 33:37.524
And so I am an expert in the biology of automobiles because I can tell you that there is a very strict correlation between the heavy metal content of the gases coming out of that back tube and the speed of the car.

33:37.604 --> 33:39.945
And also the temperature often correlates highly.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.628
And the hotter it is, the faster the car is moving.

33:43.368 --> 33:57.471
And so I've found so many patterns in automobile biology that I got a Nobel Prize for my work on the correlation between exhaust content and temperature and the speed of automobiles.

34:00.851 --> 34:12.858
And my students have gone on to show that there are correlations between the heavy metal content of the exhaust and the number of people and the number of wheels.

34:13.319 --> 34:21.303
And if you have more wheels, then oh my gosh, the likelihood of the smoke coming out being more heavy metals and more pollutants is very high.

34:21.704 --> 34:30.329
And so there's another phenomenon there where wheels might be related to the amount of heavy metals that are released by these biological organisms we call

34:31.129 --> 34:31.730
automobiles.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.591
And in fact, the more wheels they have, the bigger they are.

34:36.772 --> 34:46.818
Now I know this is a bit hyperbole, but understand that this is basically how biology is done from the context of a reductionist biologist.

34:47.378 --> 34:54.902
You reduce the number of variables so that you can understand neurons as being basically SK channel dependent.

34:55.602 --> 34:58.184
Yeah, they fire action potentials.

35:00.413 --> 35:18.139
and the action potential of a neuron is governed by the movement of sodium and potassium very quickly across the membrane and movement of one causes the voltage fluctuation in one direction and the quick movement of the other causes the voltage reset.

35:20.618 --> 35:32.755
And actually there's this slower current governed by calcium that decides how long this refractory period is and decides whether a neuron can fire one or two or three before it needs to recover.

35:34.281 --> 35:39.662
And so if you're a reductionist biologist, you just say that SK channels are responsible for this.

35:40.142 --> 35:48.245
And I study SK channels because SK channels decide whether neurons can fire one action potential or four very, very fast.

35:48.865 --> 35:57.107
And since signaling in the brain is dependent on action potentials and their frequency, citation, citation, citation, that I study SK channels.

35:58.887 --> 36:01.528
And so all academic biologists

36:02.469 --> 36:05.471
approach biology from a reductionist standpoint.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.132
The less I know about those other variables, the better.

36:08.552 --> 36:18.238
Because it would be terrible to find out that although SK channels, when they're blocked, change the frequency of firing, that's also true for six other channels.

36:20.719 --> 36:31.845
And so the argument that you make is only realistic if you ignore the fact that there are many other channels, when removed, have a very similar effect on neuronal function.

36:33.772 --> 36:50.786
Just like I was describing before, if you just focused on the exhaust of automobiles and trying to make ever more precise measurements on the contents and temperature, you could tell stories related to all kinds of things about how automobiles work with ever never really making any useful progress.

36:53.428 --> 36:59.814
And the only reason why people don't do that with automobiles is because automobiles are not irreducibly complex.

37:02.810 --> 37:03.851
But biology is.

37:05.572 --> 37:15.619
And so if biology is irreducibly complex, then we actually are fooling ourselves when we use and overuse and overuse the reductionist strategy.

37:17.387 --> 37:22.394
On a non-irreducible complexity like an automobile, that strategy will eliminate itself.

37:22.434 --> 37:35.611
Those mistakes will reveal themselves as correlations are added and experiments are done, then the ridiculousness of continuing to focus on the correlation between velocity and content of exhaust would become obvious.

37:37.759 --> 37:49.948
But when applying this irreducible complexity, I mean, sorry, this reductionist strategy to an irreducible complexity, one can essentially engage in an infinite inquiry.

37:52.390 --> 38:05.180
And I would argue that from the perspective of science, these people know that and knew that this would be the way to get us to slowly stumble

38:06.522 --> 38:20.190
into allowing a few smart men to attempt to grab the toolbox and organize the way that our evolution goes, to start to direct the way that our evolution goes, because in their imagination, it's just a matter of time.

38:24.492 --> 38:31.636
And so I think we gotta raise our kids, our high school kids, we gotta send high school kids off to their, you know,

38:33.028 --> 38:37.731
their adult age already understanding this fundamental inversion.

38:38.671 --> 38:49.698
That a reductionist strategy, when applied ad infinitum to an irreducible complexity, will actually get us nowhere.

38:50.278 --> 38:55.061
It's like dividing the same piece of thing into a million, million, million, million, million.

38:55.101 --> 38:56.301
You can't keep doing that.

38:57.402 --> 38:58.763
But that's how science works.

38:59.542 --> 39:08.229
When we are applying these questions incorrectly without validation, sticking to these models, we have a very big problem.

39:08.269 --> 39:09.870
And yet that's how grants are written.

39:09.930 --> 39:28.885
That's how successful tenure is achieved, is learning how to take this reductionist strategy, find your own combination of reduced variables, and then learn how to tell stories about how you are creating knowledge by probing this little tiny space of possibility.

39:30.874 --> 39:40.719
And all that work is actually diluting the irreducible complexity in a very malevolent way.

39:41.159 --> 39:45.601
Even if it's unwittingly, which it was, it's done by everyone in academia unwittingly.

39:46.462 --> 39:49.683
Because again, your salary is depending on you learning how to do it.

39:50.624 --> 39:56.106
Learning how to apply this reductionist strategy to identify a, a

39:59.727 --> 40:01.008
a path of inquiry.

40:02.509 --> 40:08.094
And it's not a path of inquiry in the way that a naturalist would go.

40:08.254 --> 40:14.540
And that's what I'm trying to impart here, what I want people to see as they approach biology.

40:14.580 --> 40:22.627
You have to see that all of these abstracts of all of these papers are all written in this idea where reductionism is a good idea.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.789
It's not only a good idea, it is necessity.

40:26.653 --> 40:37.656
And that is a philosophy that completely ignores that fundamental incongruity that I'm trying to get out in words that I don't know if I'm doing it at all here or not.

40:37.796 --> 40:43.517
But I'm really trying to, that's why I think I just have to improvise this and figure out how to say it.

40:43.597 --> 40:46.378
And then when I figure it out and it comes out right, then we'll repeat it.

40:48.356 --> 40:59.919
But you can't use this kind of reductionist strategy and correlation and null hypothesis testing on an irreducible complexity and make progress.

40:59.959 --> 41:06.341
You can use it on a non-irreducible complexity like an automobile that is a solvable problem.

41:06.361 --> 41:07.862
You can use it on a watch.

41:10.745 --> 41:13.446
because this is a solvable mechanism.

41:13.506 --> 41:15.246
It's something that you could understand.

41:15.366 --> 41:22.689
Even someone like a tribesman could see, wow, this is amazing.

41:22.729 --> 41:23.629
This is beautiful.

41:24.169 --> 41:29.571
But if the watch was ticking, right?

41:30.871 --> 41:34.032
If the watch was ticking and moving,

41:36.570 --> 41:40.293
And you clicked it like this, and you clicked it like that, and you gave it back to the dude.

41:41.033 --> 41:42.715
He might not know what's happening here.

41:42.755 --> 41:46.657
He might not know what's going on, but he can see how the device works.

41:46.817 --> 41:57.305
It's not an irreducible complexity because if you then took that tribesman... I'm not going to be able to open that with my fingernails.

41:58.406 --> 41:58.866
Don't look.

41:59.927 --> 42:01.068
I shouldn't be using this tool.

42:05.327 --> 42:19.241
If you open this watch and you showed him this, now again, he might be very impressed with the craftsmanship, but the illusion of what's going on would be much less magical.

42:19.281 --> 42:29.751
Now, it still might be very hard for him to understand how someone came up with this idea, but this is no longer the production of magic.

42:31.846 --> 42:39.991
It's something that even the imagination of a tribesman would be able to see is a very elaborate creation.

42:41.352 --> 42:55.280
And then if you showed him that the hands don't move, if that wheel in there isn't ticking and that this hand moves in rhythm with that wheel in there that's ticking, any child would be able to connect those.

42:57.540 --> 43:11.293
But when it comes to an irreducible complexity and when it comes to starting with this kind of assumption where we can work at this level and generalize across this level with very rudimentary measurements.

43:13.803 --> 43:16.244
That's where this becomes undermined.

43:16.304 --> 43:21.306
That's where our whole reverence for this irreducible complexity becomes undermined.

43:21.386 --> 43:33.510
Because instead of saying regularly that this is a necessarily incomplete view so that we can scratch the surface of something, otherwise we couldn't even, it would be a drop in the pond.

43:34.410 --> 43:43.073
Instead, very, very cleverly for the last few decades, we have been teaching our children and those children being me and you,

43:45.219 --> 43:47.301
that we're very close to understanding everything.

43:47.341 --> 43:51.705
It's just a few gaps we have to fill in here, and then we'll understand everything.

43:51.725 --> 43:53.947
And there's people working on every level here.

43:56.269 --> 44:10.022
And of course, there's people working at the level below this, which is the level that these guys were all advocating for already for decades before this, that we have to understand and prioritize at the genetic level.

44:12.099 --> 44:20.950
and understanding our biology at the genetic level should be where all of our resources are bent because, again, it's our future.

44:22.572 --> 44:23.413
It's our destiny.

44:24.234 --> 44:28.460
We're not going to leave our evolution up to Mother Nature forever, are we?

44:30.117 --> 44:37.518
And I think that's also what Biology 101 has been now contorted over these few decades to represent.

44:37.558 --> 44:42.699
That Mother Nature is not actually a very fair and just arbiter.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.080
It can be very random and cruel.

44:46.360 --> 44:50.401
And so it's just by luck and random chance that humans are here.

44:51.641 --> 44:55.582
And if we don't pull our heads out, it could be that we could vanish like the dinosaurs.

45:02.389 --> 45:08.693
So I think we're at a stage now where we can start to see the issue.

45:09.713 --> 45:21.160
Because one of the themes then that's under here is this idea that genes and genetics, that we basically get it.

45:23.662 --> 45:27.504
And that it's just a question of doing the work to sort out the details.

45:28.885 --> 45:38.148
but essentially when we put a book and we move a book from one house to another, we understand why the people start eating grilled cheese.

45:39.268 --> 45:40.309
And it's not true.

45:41.169 --> 45:42.669
It's not true at all.

45:42.769 --> 45:52.192
Yes, it does indicate that the material in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, if this is biology 101, I guess we better do some of that too.

45:53.072 --> 45:54.053
Eukaryotic.

45:56.994 --> 45:57.994
I'm not a spelling man.

45:58.981 --> 45:59.802
That's probably wrong.

46:00.482 --> 46:01.343
Eukaryotic.

46:02.264 --> 46:04.305
Oh, of course.

46:04.325 --> 46:09.469
I think it's closer to that.

46:10.150 --> 46:17.916
Eukaryotic cells are cells that have a nucleus and inside that nucleus is stuff like DNA, chromosomes, that kind of thing.

46:18.856 --> 46:23.460
And then prokaryotic cells are cells that don't have nuclei, like fungi and that kind of thing.

46:24.478 --> 46:31.362
Um, so the idea of course is, I know that analogy is not perfect, but again, recall what I just said.

46:31.942 --> 46:41.467
If you have a book and you put it in somebody's house and everybody in the house reads it and then is inspired to eat grilled cheese for a couple of weeks, you don't have any idea what's in that book.

46:42.748 --> 46:45.550
and you don't have any idea why it would do that.

46:46.611 --> 46:55.698
And even if you take that book and put it in the next house and the same thing happens, the only thing you can say is that you can't say that that book is even a story about grilled cheese.

46:58.726 --> 47:08.112
And so a lot of experiments have been done with regard to genes and genetics and moving genes and deleting genes and this kind of thing.

47:08.172 --> 47:26.603
And so to a certain extent, our understanding of their role is true, but we have to see that this generalization doesn't mean that the way the DNA is decoded in closely related mammals is necessarily exactly the same as it's decoded for us.

47:28.697 --> 47:30.437
because our enzymes could be different.

47:30.577 --> 47:32.618
The rules could be subtly different.

47:32.738 --> 47:54.521
And one of the assumptions that is made in reductionist biology is that these rules can be generalized across these different layers, that what we learn about the cells in mice could be assumed to be very similar to that found in animals.

47:54.761 --> 47:57.702
And so this assumption, and I think this is,

47:58.817 --> 48:02.040
nice because I'm getting where I wanted to go without knowing how I was going to get there.

48:03.081 --> 48:19.535
This assumption can be seen in a reflection again, in particular with Man and His Future, because in this book, of course, one of the authors is Joshua Lederberg, Joshua Lederberg being one of the pioneers in terms of describing and understanding the biology of bacteriophages.

48:22.748 --> 48:30.153
And so that's why I think it's very important to understand that Joshua Lederberg, being one of these thought leaders, had to have known.

48:30.173 --> 48:32.534
I mean, he was a child prodigy.

48:32.934 --> 48:46.463
He had to have known, had to have immediately thought after all of that Nobel prize winning work with his wife that showed that bacteriophages do what they do and how they do it and what they can are capable of.

48:48.769 --> 49:04.412
He must, he must and his contemporaries must have realized that similar signaling mechanisms, packet genetic signaling mechanisms would be used by eukaryotic cells of our own.

49:08.193 --> 49:12.474
He had to have thought of the possibility that if bacteria

49:19.156 --> 49:36.294
bacteria have this mechanism of packet communication and packet genetic signaling, then there's a possibility that the correlative cells of a eukaryote would have a similar mechanism of communication.

49:37.255 --> 49:38.497
There's no possible way that

49:39.650 --> 49:55.919
that he couldn't have known that, and yet that fundamental assumption that that's not there, we don't see that, is part of the molecular biology that we are taught from the very beginning, from page 7 in a biological textbook that

49:56.679 --> 50:04.385
genes are genes and genes do the same thing in every animal and cells are cells and they do basically the same thing in every animal and tissues are tissues.

50:04.865 --> 50:07.107
And they're organized in the same way in every animal.

50:07.567 --> 50:09.889
And so we can generalize across all of these things.

50:09.949 --> 50:22.058
But before we knew any of these details, people were already aware of bacteriophages and knew for sure that they were there and and derived really detailed experimental proof.

50:23.897 --> 50:36.968
And none of the no virus people from the COVID narrative would disagree that bacteriophages are there, which means that one of the layers here that everybody would be skipping then would be, you know, cells.

50:37.008 --> 50:37.888
Yeah, okay, great.

50:37.928 --> 50:44.654
But what about the bacteria and the bacteriophages?

50:49.228 --> 51:01.098
as a background of biological material that's literally everywhere, actually everywhere, in the air, water, soil, our skin, on our mucus membranes.

51:01.278 --> 51:12.528
Every surface is covered by bacteria and bacteriophages, which our DNA and RNA signal background.

51:14.289 --> 51:17.132
It's impossible to underestimate how much of it there is.

51:19.164 --> 51:26.611
And that our pattern integrity, who we are and who the animals and plants are exist on that and with that background.

51:29.814 --> 51:38.242
And yet in the reductionist biology that we are taught in biology 101, those things aren't part of this, this scheme.

51:39.123 --> 51:44.308
Those things are definitely left out of the bottom here because they want you to make the incredible leap.

51:46.454 --> 51:52.858
from thinking that you understand how a family works because you can put a book in the house and then they start eating grilled cheese.

51:54.279 --> 51:59.963
That you think that you understand how cells work because we find DNA in all these places.

52:01.865 --> 52:09.410
That you think that you can generalize across how those codes manifest in one pattern integrity versus another.

52:10.868 --> 52:24.195
They need us to accept this incredible level of reductionism across all these levels at once in order for us to fool ourselves into believing that we almost understand it.

52:27.797 --> 52:33.500
And that's really where I think the first chapter of every biological textbook fails.

52:36.033 --> 52:43.794
and fails maybe in an intentional sense because of, again, this philosophy of how we're gonna get to the end game.

52:43.834 --> 52:49.435
This philosophy stems from way back when, from very few number of thinkers.

52:52.276 --> 52:55.036
And I think what Mike Eden said the other day is really right.

52:55.096 --> 53:03.718
I think a lot of these ideas have culminated in and have looked forward to culminating in the event that is the pandemic, the COVID pandemic.

53:05.105 --> 53:15.268
this plan to make us accept our biology as basically solved and therefore not really ours, not really sacred anymore.

53:16.188 --> 53:32.653
But at the point where we all need to realize that it's our responsibility as a member of society to go along with this plan to understand ourselves, this plan to finally break this code.

53:34.554 --> 53:38.335
And they are going to admit that we can't do it in animals.

53:38.695 --> 53:42.136
They are going to admit that if we do it in animals, it won't help us with ourselves.

53:43.036 --> 53:47.017
They've already admitted it to themselves and to each other in private meetings.

53:47.817 --> 53:53.539
And they already admit it in every biological textbook without actually saying it now that I know how to read them.

53:54.939 --> 53:58.520
And I think that's the goal of, of what we're trying to do here.

53:58.540 --> 54:01.301
We're trying to get to the stage where we can.

54:03.075 --> 54:22.469
we can see the effect of these early ideas on every abstract, on every reductionist experiment, and then we can extract the useful observation from the experiment, or more importantly, dispel the illusion that these experiments have created.

54:22.549 --> 54:25.631
And I think that's the way we should be reading papers.

54:25.691 --> 54:28.633
We should be reading papers with the idea that

54:29.710 --> 54:42.544
By the wanton application of reductionist thinking, we are being bombarded by primary literature, which essentially creates the illusion of knowledge creation.

54:43.866 --> 54:51.154
And that illusion of knowledge creation requires that we accept this framework of understanding.

54:54.141 --> 55:16.065
And this framework of understanding is dividing these things into separate parts where separate questions can be answered instead of emphasizing these as different layers that add complexity to the irreducible complexity that we are trying to appreciate.

55:17.006 --> 55:18.266
Appreciate as beauty.

55:19.295 --> 55:29.078
appreciate as creation, not trying to dissect, hijack, or own, dominate, or master.

55:30.718 --> 55:35.640
And that's really how I think a real biology class would start.

55:35.660 --> 55:39.441
I think that's how we do it, is we have two goals.

55:40.521 --> 55:42.021
The first goal would be to

55:45.970 --> 55:59.322
to understand life as a pattern integrity and the second would be to understand how science has been broken and so as I try to approach those two things in parallel, I want to emphasize this idea that

56:01.064 --> 56:13.688
this division of understanding and this sort of imposition of these different levels of organization is how they get people to accept the reductionist philosophy.

56:14.508 --> 56:25.252
Teach people how it's applied so that you can get to the stage where you say, I study SK channels in the brain because SK channels control how the brain works.

56:27.116 --> 56:49.803
And the only way that they can get people to the stage where they can really apply this thinking and think they're making progress is to start with an introduction where they introduce the reductionist philosophy as a good thing, as a consequence of stuff being real complicated, but then never say it again.

56:51.837 --> 57:05.360
And I think that's really what we're going to be repeating for this entire course, what Buckminster Fuller repeats for all of his books, and how we can get people to understand that the main question should be now, what do we know?

57:06.941 --> 57:10.822
And what do we definitely not know that they are insisting that they know?

57:12.382 --> 57:16.183
And I think then we'll be able to, you know, make progress with our kids.

57:17.012 --> 57:24.934
and arm them with the knowledge that they have the right questions to ask and can see how this is being misapplied.

57:26.094 --> 57:51.075
And so that's why I think in about an hour and a half or so, I'm gonna come back on and we're gonna audit the first of the many course installments of William Briggs, because one of the ideas that I have in parallel here is to incorporate some of the thinking of David Stove, who is an author and a person that I was made aware of by,

57:52.336 --> 57:56.426
Emily Kaplan and Greg Glassman of the Broken Science Initiative.

57:58.431 --> 58:00.476
And I think this is probably the best way

58:03.482 --> 58:04.623
It's almost too simple.

58:05.103 --> 58:10.106
Essentially, I have it on my list up here, but it's essentially models and analogies.

58:11.767 --> 58:18.070
In the biology textbook, we're going to have a lot of analogies, analogies with computers, analogies with machines.

58:18.571 --> 58:31.098
And these analogies are ways of reinforcing this reductionist thinking and making you feel comfortable in this reductionist thinking without ever challenging you to verify

58:32.301 --> 58:35.843
the predictions that your reductionist model makes.

58:37.043 --> 58:38.324
So let me say it another way.

58:38.484 --> 58:43.547
If you go back down to the SK Channel thing and the guy who thinks that SK Channels control the brain,

58:45.326 --> 58:51.230
It's very important that this person never really usefully question the assumptions that are made there.

58:51.871 --> 59:08.384
As I said before, it would be terrible if there were 20 other channels that if you remove them from a mouse, the firing frequency of their neurons uniformly change because then the statement doesn't really make as much of an impact as it would if this was the only channel that had any role here.

59:09.761 --> 59:20.209
And so the reductionist thing is often analogies versus models, because again, in an analogy, you already get to limit the potential possibilities.

59:20.269 --> 59:32.238
If you use an analogy of a virus hijacking the machinery of your cells to make it do something that they don't already do, then that analogy doesn't play the role of a model.

59:33.151 --> 59:40.006
that can be validated but instead provides the basis for a null hypothesis and therefore you never really test anything.

59:41.107 --> 59:42.688
And so we need to understand that.

59:42.788 --> 59:48.953
We need to understand how use of models and validation is the way science is done.

59:49.473 --> 59:56.819
The use of reductionist analogies and null hypotheses is the way that this fake knowledge is created.

59:56.859 --> 01:00:02.243
And I think more than anybody, David Stove has been able to explain how this semantic game is done.

01:00:02.723 --> 01:00:09.929
And I think more than anybody else, I think William Briggs, Matt Briggs has really attempted and succeeded

01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:31.258
in being able to bring people to understand what is oftentimes seems on its face very simple ideas that are almost duh but those same ideas are the basis for modern academic science these wait a minute that's that's your argument but you didn't prove anything if you really see it for what it is then the

01:00:32.836 --> 01:00:54.976
the contradiction in what people write in their conclusions and discussion and abstracts versus what the limitations of their reductionist model is and then therefore what they're really not testing at all because their reductionist model is framed in only one layer of these things or maybe only takes into account two of these layers and the rest is gone.

01:00:56.087 --> 01:01:01.149
The rest is permanently ignored so that we can say that SK channels control the brain.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.231
And so that's why semantics are also very important.

01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:19.537
And of course, we've experienced something like this, where the semantics of virology have been the subject of debate and ridicule and argument and the focus of potentially thousands of people for the last four or five years.

01:01:19.597 --> 01:01:23.178
And they're basically semantic arguments when it comes down to it.

01:01:24.739 --> 01:01:28.321
So yeah, that's an attempt at an intro.

01:01:28.381 --> 01:01:30.143
And so we might have to clean this up a little bit.

01:01:30.163 --> 01:01:34.645
I'm going to watch it again, take some notes, and figure out how to distill it and organize it better.

01:01:34.685 --> 01:01:38.188
And every day we're going to do this until we get it right.

01:01:38.848 --> 01:01:42.170
So the next Biology 101 class will be on Thursday.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:44.031
We're going to do Tuesday and Thursday for a while.

01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:46.273
There will be other shows on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

01:01:47.413 --> 01:02:04.101
On school days, but the biology 101 and the statistics will be Tuesday and Thursday So that I can you know do some do something in the way of course programming and so Thursday again, we'll have class at 1010 and Today, I think it's 1112 now.

01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.942
So I don't see any reason why 1313 is

01:02:07.543 --> 01:02:10.664
cannot be the usual time for the statistics class.

01:02:10.704 --> 01:02:13.305
Now remember, I'm not a teacher.

01:02:13.566 --> 01:02:14.626
I'm a biology coach.

01:02:14.806 --> 01:02:19.348
And for this, we're auditing William Briggs's statistics course.

01:02:19.388 --> 01:02:22.329
So I'm going into this as a student with you.

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:27.031
And so I don't know how far we'll get or what trouble I'll have.

01:02:27.731 --> 01:02:28.612
But the nice thing is,

01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:49.861
is Matt Briggs is a phone call away and I think I can already say this pretty safely, we're going to be able to have William on as often as we should need when we start to encounter problems or we start to think we're having a useful discussion about something we can invite

01:02:51.381 --> 01:03:20.893
Matt in and I'm sure that he'll spend a half an hour with us and and talk about our questions and talk about What we think we're learning and I think that's how we're gonna make incredible progress Tuesdays and Thursdays as we move forward and then on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays We'll do journal clubs and and study halls and and maybe even some meddler medleys or some kind of fire hose type thing I'm not really sure my my main focus now is going to be on Tuesdays and Thursdays and

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:25.897
getting this out and then being present as often as possible Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:36.205
My sons and I have started a couple projects that will eventually be revealed here in the next couple weeks and I'm really excited about them so some of my focus will also be on that.

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:40.388
So again, we don't have notes from this one because the intro week

01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:48.573
Let's say the intro four classes or so are going to still be kind of skeletonized like this, kind of hashed out as I go.

01:03:48.593 --> 01:03:54.816
I might open Thursday again with just a list of things that I want to cover and then see how I cover them.

01:03:56.863 --> 01:04:03.985
And then I think we'll have our momentum going and we'll have a framework of goals in mind.

01:04:04.185 --> 01:04:10.567
And again, I need to review what I've just discussed now and see if I got what I wanted out of it.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:14.188
And so Thursday will also be a little bit of a recap of this as well.

01:04:15.048 --> 01:04:18.952
I don't know what you were expecting me coming back after a week or so.

01:04:19.413 --> 01:04:21.755
I hope not too many people are disappointed.

01:04:22.636 --> 01:04:38.110
I'm gonna try and move the ball forward in a more useful way to try and find a broader audience and try to provide something that more people feel is worth financially supporting because more than anything now I believe that

01:04:39.351 --> 01:04:40.072
For my family.

01:04:40.112 --> 01:05:07.512
This is this is the best way forward for me to become this or go back to coaching biology instead of Instead of chasing bad guys or revealing The bad guys which is also important work But most of which has been done at this stage So again, we have a couple months to go where some crazy stuff is gonna happen So, of course, I'm gonna be still paying attention to that and I'm still gonna be available on soapbox discussing it and I'll still be here and

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:08.672
discussing it.

01:05:08.692 --> 01:05:20.400
But on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we're going to be doing this kind of work and trying to organize a framework of a biology 101 course that I don't think has ever been taught and taught in a different way.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.371
for a new way forward.

01:05:23.391 --> 01:05:24.651
So that's my goal.

01:05:24.952 --> 01:05:27.373
I don't know how well I'm going to be able to achieve it.

01:05:27.393 --> 01:05:28.214
I'm just one guy.

01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:43.984
But if you have feedback for me, please find my email or please go to gigaombiological.com and provide that feedback because this course will be better if people tell me what's wrong with it and tell me what I'm getting right and what I've made clear and what I haven't because that's what I need.

01:05:45.325 --> 01:05:48.369
Otherwise it's just going to be me organizing something for me.

01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:49.870
So hopefully I get some feedback.

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:50.531
Thanks very much.

01:05:51.872 --> 01:05:54.736
Am I going to play music on the way out?

01:05:54.836 --> 01:05:56.157
I guess not.

01:05:56.297 --> 01:05:57.539
I think it's better if I don't.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.961
Because this is a classroom.

01:06:00.021 --> 01:06:03.805
People don't leave a classroom with...

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:06.370
music.

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:07.211
We just say goodbye.

01:06:07.891 --> 01:06:17.515
So I guess I'll see you at 1313 where we will audit the first lesson of William Briggs's probability and statistics course.

01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:24.058
And remember, that's loosely based on the probability theory by Jaynes.

01:06:25.078 --> 01:06:27.259
And it's also got a lot to do with this book.

01:06:27.319 --> 01:06:31.001
And I think this book is available via PDF form already for free.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:57.221
I'm gonna find out where that is and then put that on The list of literature that we're working with and I'm also gonna put the PDF of this book up Which we have in a couple different places Thanks to a couple people like Mark Kulak and and Uwe Olsner and that kind of thing So the PDFs of some of the books that we're gonna be deriving the next four days from Will be up in the next couple days on on on

01:06:58.939 --> 01:07:08.766
the soapbox and maybe also on the course webpage that I haven't put up yet because I wasn't really sure what I wanted to put up there, but I guess these will be part of it as well.

01:07:09.246 --> 01:07:11.367
And so again, remember this is a work in progress.

01:07:11.487 --> 01:07:15.210
I thought it was, I thought it's, it's much more useful to teach on the fly.

01:07:16.131 --> 01:07:19.153
And so we'll just do this as a development and then, uh,

01:07:19.693 --> 01:07:31.226
When we have this first semester or first, you know, let's say a couple months of the course done, then I think what we're going to end up doing is just repeating it, but repeating it better and maybe reducing the number.

01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:33.468
And then that will be the first iteration of this.

01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:36.111
And so hopefully we'll be able to have that done.

01:07:37.973 --> 01:07:41.157
Hopefully we'll be able to have that done before the red pill in November.

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:45.924
I'm speaking at the Red Pill at the end of November in Oklahoma.

01:07:45.964 --> 01:07:48.044
I think it's the 16th and 17th of November.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.305
You can find that website on the internet, of course.

01:07:51.685 --> 01:07:54.106
And so I'm looking forward to that.

01:07:54.486 --> 01:08:02.747
And I want this biology course not only to be available, but also to be kind of complimentary to that presentation.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:09.329
So I've got plans and they even include my sons, which I'm really excited about.

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:13.173
We've got to find other ways to make this work for my family.

01:08:13.353 --> 01:08:21.022
And so I finally, after a long time, with the help of my kids, actually figured out a way to make it all synergistic.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.745
So I'm all really excited.

01:08:22.805 --> 01:08:24.186
I'm really happy to finally be back.

01:08:24.246 --> 01:08:25.408
And thanks very much for joining me.

01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:26.269
I'll see you again soon.
