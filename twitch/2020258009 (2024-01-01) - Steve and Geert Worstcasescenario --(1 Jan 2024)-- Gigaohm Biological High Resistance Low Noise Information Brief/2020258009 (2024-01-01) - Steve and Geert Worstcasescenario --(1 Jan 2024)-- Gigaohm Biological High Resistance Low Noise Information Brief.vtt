01:00.000 --> 01:28.600
a

01:28.600 --> 01:31.940
with my sound but I'll just do a sound check quick since there's somebody here

01:31.940 --> 01:39.160
already. Happy New Year everybody. How's that sound look? Should be alright.

01:39.640 --> 01:48.520
Yes sound good. Locked in five by five says somebody okay great.

01:58.600 --> 02:24.920
Oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh time out JC on the bike. JC on the bike.

02:25.160 --> 02:33.080
It's JC on the bike. It's JC on the bike yeah well I'm wise enough to know when a

02:33.080 --> 02:40.440
chomp needs banning and I know just the one. Look at round it's JC on the bike. Who says

02:40.440 --> 02:44.280
Vader didn't study music in college.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.960
I thought that was super exciting.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.920
You

03:54.920 --> 03:56.920
You

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
You

04:54.920 --> 04:56.920
You

05:24.920 --> 05:26.920
You

05:54.920 --> 05:56.920
You

06:24.920 --> 06:26.920
You

06:54.920 --> 06:56.920
You

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
You

07:54.920 --> 07:56.920
You

08:24.920 --> 08:26.920
You

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
You

08:56.920 --> 08:58.920
You

08:58.920 --> 09:00.920
You

09:00.920 --> 09:02.920
You

09:02.920 --> 09:04.920
You

09:04.920 --> 09:06.920
You

09:06.920 --> 09:08.920
You

09:08.920 --> 09:10.920
You

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
You

09:12.920 --> 09:16.920
Yeah, so we've got a video to review. I don't know how much we're going to get through it.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.920
We're going to try hard to get through it at least.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
This is a

09:22.920 --> 09:28.920
I guess a stream brought to you by a patch cloud physiologist. I'm a biologist my whole life since I was a little kid

09:28.920 --> 09:34.920
but I spent an awful lot of time on microscopes looking at connections electrical connections between neurons

09:34.920 --> 09:42.920
and a measurement that's often used in regards to the resistance of the seal

09:42.920 --> 09:48.920
when you make a recording from these neurons is a giga ohm and it is a high resistance low noise recording

09:48.920 --> 09:56.920
and that's where the name of the stream comes from it's also the name of giga ohm biological.com my website

09:56.920 --> 10:00.920
where you can go and you can also find me at giga ohm.bio

10:00.920 --> 10:08.920
which is a kind of federated chat thing kind of like twitter only better

10:08.920 --> 10:14.920
and you can find places to you know look at the schedule there and you can support the stream there

10:14.920 --> 10:24.920
you can leave a voicemail send me your email address and you can also become a monthly quarterly or annual supporter of my work

10:24.920 --> 10:30.920
and that would be very much appreciated and those people who are doing that right now

10:30.920 --> 10:36.920
besides sharing my work the best way to do it is to subscribe and these are my current subscribers

10:36.920 --> 10:44.920
I apologize for not updating this list as often as I should and going forward in the future obviously

10:44.920 --> 10:50.920
I'm going to do that because I've been asking people to help and people have been stepping up

10:50.920 --> 10:58.920
and so I really appreciate it very very much so yes let's move on with this business here

11:06.920 --> 11:28.920
so we've got to add another column to this year year by year description of the illusion of consensus

11:28.920 --> 11:36.920
we had to add another column to the fate in the novel virus has lasted four years now

11:36.920 --> 11:42.920
and we're still trying to break it by calling it a lie because that's what it is really it's just a mythology

11:59.920 --> 12:08.920
sounds like somebody's telling me my mp3 and now he's not quite good enough I'm fine with that we'll figure that out you can help me out with that

12:08.920 --> 12:13.920
this is the faith we are trying to dispel

12:14.920 --> 12:25.920
it really is giga-owned biological it really is January 1st 2024 I just can't believe it

12:25.920 --> 12:35.920
I mean how is it even sure I'd be alive in 2024 I thought I would be in some kind of little cage you know like I go to that cartoon

12:35.920 --> 12:43.920
and with like a day's look on my face but instead I'm in a cage in the back of my garage in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

12:43.920 --> 12:50.920
hello ladies and gentlemen my name is Jonathan Cooey this is giga-owned biological high resistance low noise information brought to you by a biologist

12:51.920 --> 13:08.920
it is the first day of the year 2024 and we are still arguing about immunology and mythology regarding the the thing called the coronavirus which I guess is an RNA pathogen

13:09.920 --> 13:25.920
and RNA-based pathogen and we're still trying to really get to the heart of this narrative oh yeah that's right sorry I knew that that was coming but I just kind of jazzed out on it there a little bit

13:25.920 --> 13:31.920
I'm having to split these slideshows up now so that the computer doesn't get so angry with them

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
I'm not really sure why that is

13:33.920 --> 13:41.920
giga-owned biological is definitely the safest way to get biology in your head you can also use a knife and shove it in there

13:41.920 --> 13:46.920
but I don't recommend that although it did work very well for Jeff

13:46.920 --> 13:54.920
the faith in a novel virus is a train that we do not want our children to get on

13:54.920 --> 14:00.920
it is a mythology that we don't want our children to learn it's a little bit like Santa Claus

14:00.920 --> 14:09.920
but then because there are a lot of adults that are gonna play this game as long as possible we don't want our kids believing in this particular Santa Claus

14:09.920 --> 14:13.920
and as this train is about to leave the station

14:13.920 --> 14:19.920
and I assure you it is about to leave the station we have to be sure that our children don't grow up

14:19.920 --> 14:27.920
believing that vaccination is a way that we have rid ourselves of disease in the past although it may have had some effect

14:27.920 --> 14:30.920
it may have had some effects

14:30.920 --> 14:38.920
the vast majority of those effects were on bacterial type diseases and they were done by interacting with the immune system at a barrier

14:38.920 --> 14:44.920
they weren't done with intramuscular injections so we've got to be very clear about this

14:44.920 --> 14:54.920
novel coronaviruses cannot as far as we can tell jump species and then pandemic for multiple years and yet we are being told that mythology and our children are on that train

14:54.920 --> 14:59.920
and if we don't get them off that train they're gonna be stuck on it

14:59.920 --> 15:07.920
same with PCR being a way to detect all these different viral pathogens we've got to get them off this train

15:07.920 --> 15:19.920
and we cannot have them riding off into the distance thinking that variants are something that they have to pay attention to or that the PCR signals in sewers are something that are worth measuring

15:19.920 --> 15:24.920
and adjusting our behavior accordingly

15:24.920 --> 15:38.920
we definitely don't want them to believe that people can grow viruses in their garage as long as they have a biology book and some reasonable set of hands

15:38.920 --> 15:43.920
but that is the faith in the novel virus that everyone is currently pushing

15:43.920 --> 15:57.920
and incidentally what's really weird is that it's our side that's pushing that narrative it's our side that's insisting it was a lab leak it's our side that's insisting that they covered up it's our side

15:57.920 --> 16:07.920
that's got a hold of all these narratives which support the idea of a novel virus but if we use biology we can get ourselves out

16:07.920 --> 16:17.920
and so I'm trying to take this really you know 30,000 foot approach and say that first and foremost everyone no matter what your position is

16:17.920 --> 16:24.920
your position on vaccination should be very clear at this point we don't know what we're doing we never did

16:24.920 --> 16:32.920
and we certainly are not trying to figure out what we're doing now and we've created a legal structure wherein this can't really happen and so

16:32.920 --> 16:44.920
we've got a call for a pause on all childhood vaccinations and then we've got a call for strict liability on all pharmaceutical products

16:44.920 --> 16:51.920
and then we need to investigate what happened in 2019 and 2020

16:51.920 --> 17:02.920
and figure out how these mass casualty events were created and then how they were orchestrated to use as evidence of spread confounded with evidence of spread

17:02.920 --> 17:13.920
who told you to say those things in other words the questions we need to ask and we can figure out the people whom we need to ask those questions investigate the use of these mass casualty events

17:13.920 --> 17:21.920
to create the illusion of the pandemic to look at these individual cases that supposedly provided us with

17:21.920 --> 17:36.920
cultureable coronavirus samples that could provide us with a full sequence of the virus like Sohomish County man who apparently after being in the hospital left the hospital went to Home Depot disappeared something like that

17:36.920 --> 17:48.920
we have no idea who he is where he lives where he went but he provided us with a sequence for which all of the preceding IP is basically based on

17:48.920 --> 18:01.920
there are lots of anomalies in the beginning, middle and end of this little drama and those anomalies need to be cleared up and some of those anomalies are people

18:01.920 --> 18:10.920
we need to reclaim our sovereignty over our bodies and those of our children in Congress must end the CDC and withdraw from the who in the UN entirely that's what I think

18:10.920 --> 18:23.920
I think if we said something like this if we could figure out some way of organizing a message like this and getting people to agree on this then we can also debate about whether or not viruses are real or not

18:23.920 --> 18:32.920
we can pause the vaccination schedule in America for one of many reasons including the fact that all viruses might be fake

18:32.920 --> 18:43.920
you see how that works you can pause for the injuries that are being done we can pause for the legal loopholes that they've been given we can pause for the injuries that we see on VAERS

18:43.920 --> 19:07.920
and we can pause for the fact that they may be lying about the fidelity of these RNA pathogens and we don't have to focus just on the fact that they're lying about RNA pathogens we could also work toward these other goals with that one in mind

19:07.920 --> 19:17.920
so how the pandemic was created we went over last night and it's basically that they've been seating again a function narrative for decades now

19:17.920 --> 19:25.920
and that's behind the scenes that's in the newspapers that's in science magazine

19:25.920 --> 19:36.920
people openly complaining about the enriching of avian flu and ferrets and science magazine and New York Times complaining about these things

19:36.920 --> 19:43.920
it's also conducting regular upper level exercises drilling for the potential for this danger

19:43.920 --> 19:52.920
which obviously suggests that the danger is real otherwise these high level bureaucrats wouldn't be flying around the United States or the world to have these exercises

19:52.920 --> 20:03.920
and then they seeded the mass casualty events with those injuries that were expected to happen for transfection like cardiac arrest like stroke and heart attack

20:03.920 --> 20:15.920
and also seeded a narrative with a team of medlers let's say who would keep this narrative about the virus and about the spike protein going

20:16.920 --> 20:30.920
so that when they started transfecting people to that protein the already built in presumption of the whole population would be that the spike protein was problematic

20:30.920 --> 20:37.920
and the list was long it was already a cardiac problem it was already an amyloid problem it was already a prion problem it was already

20:38.920 --> 20:45.920
the list is endless it was a described by many people as a swiss army knife

20:45.920 --> 20:59.920
and so when we were transfected by it that swiss army knife could be blamed for the bouquet of autoimmune and protein misfolding and all these other complications that would be expected from a transfection agent

20:59.920 --> 21:09.920
transfection agent carried by a lipid nanoparticle that was going to release highly cationic lipids inside of cells after the delivery of the RNA

21:09.920 --> 21:21.920
and destroy the the electron transport chain ruin mitochondria do all kinds of things that people have been blaming on the spike which is really interesting

21:22.920 --> 21:36.920
when in reality the the way that the mitochondria are likely being damaged in any of these cells are being damaged by the lipids that are carrying these these these RNA to our cells

21:36.920 --> 21:43.920
at least that's one of the things that we learned from that Italian professor a couple days ago

21:44.920 --> 21:50.920
actually that was this the stream that I had to bring down but that was not the part of the stream that that was the problem

21:50.920 --> 22:03.920
anyway making the response declared a crisis by national security operation means that some of the people that are participating are actively engaged with the government and some kind of intelligence or national security type

22:03.920 --> 22:20.920
way where asper or health and human services or something like that has conscripted them to participate but in so doing they have a certain obligation to keep their mouth shut about the things that they know and that's really what's going on here

22:20.920 --> 22:30.920
that's why people are held to this this sort of really sharp boundaries to what they talk about really sharp boundaries about what they sell books about

22:31.920 --> 22:52.920
nobody's selling a explain it all away pandemic book everybody's selling a you know bioweapon lab leak pandemic book or a ivermectin was fraudulent book or a hydroxychloroquine was fraudulent book

22:53.920 --> 23:06.920
or vitamin D or whatever other you know that that's that's the the way that you see it and so in the end the effect is of course that the toxicity of the virus and the toxicity of transfected are confounded

23:07.920 --> 23:23.920
and this allows them to say that the pandemic has proven that transfection is pretty useful and if we optimize it if we get better at making transfection agents maybe we even make them personalized for you

23:23.920 --> 23:31.920
then transfection is just fantastic

23:31.920 --> 23:41.920
and that's where we are right now is this you know where where we are is this this novel virus idea

23:41.920 --> 23:50.920
is really here novel virus millions died millions more were saved gain a function is real and a virus may come again

23:50.920 --> 23:55.920
and so how do we move forward from here what's our next move

23:55.920 --> 24:06.920
from the start of the pandemic scientists have tried to determine exactly where and how this novel coronavirus spread to humans did it emerge naturally from the animal world

24:06.920 --> 24:16.920
and get transmitted to people in Wuhan china or from a security breach at a research lab also in Wuhan that has been the subject of an ongoing debate

24:16.920 --> 24:25.920
William Brangham is back with details about new studies published yesterday in the journal Science that point to the live animal market

24:25.920 --> 24:33.920
Judy trying to understand COVID's origins has been a complicated and politically fraught undertaking for almost three years now

24:33.920 --> 24:41.920
the Chinese government has been accused of impeding a full investigation but this new research attempts to get the clearest picture to date

24:41.920 --> 24:50.920
now remember what I'm trying to argue is that the PBS NewsHour is his culpable in the sense of they participated in this

24:50.920 --> 24:54.920
knowing that this is a narrow old wide who is this is this Erasmuson?

24:54.920 --> 25:05.920
So the at the beginning of the pandemic a lot of attention was focused on this live animal market and you and several of your colleagues including Michael Werribee

25:05.920 --> 25:14.920
have got some pretty strong evidence in your paper that indicates this was the epicenter of the outbreak what is that evidence?

25:14.920 --> 25:22.920
We plotted all of the early cases from December of 2019 on a map of Wuhan whether they were associated with the wanted market

25:22.920 --> 25:34.920
And so what we're basically dealing with is a bunch of people that have been hired or assigned a job which is to get one of these narratives to stick

25:34.920 --> 25:47.920
In this case Angela Rasmussen formerly I believe of Georgetown doesn't matter she's now in Canada has a very firm proponent of the natural market leak

25:47.920 --> 25:56.920
and has written papers about it she was really a vocal vile person on Twitter and elsewhere getting attention for being so mean

25:56.920 --> 26:06.920
and calling people you know all these names because they said that the lab leak was a possibility and she made fun of those people and she ridiculed them

26:06.920 --> 26:20.920
and on the other hand you know some other people on team worst case scenario would use her as a horrible example of how these these virologists are all lying and covering up a lab leak

26:20.920 --> 26:33.920
and so she plays that role absolutely perfectly as one of these people who has laid down this Scooby-Doo narrative so that we think that wow it's crazy that this woman thinks it's not a lab leak

26:33.920 --> 26:42.920
and I think that these other people over here are really smart because they've obviously they knew it was a lab leak from the very beginning and that was the team that I was on

26:43.920 --> 26:54.920
it was really a team of natural or lab leak and the way that people were so angry about it was very much akin to the way that people are with Democrats and Republicans right now and

26:54.920 --> 27:08.920
and the sort of polarization that occurs around Trump or can occur around transgender ideology or any of these other things where the left and the right in America right now seem to be split right down to the middle

27:09.920 --> 27:23.920
and again the coronavirus was was dubiously laid right on top of those divisions and and we shouldn't see it anymore as coincidence that it was done that way but we should see it as absolutely on purpose

27:23.920 --> 27:41.920
and in fact the narrative and the Scooby-Doo trap the mental trap that is the Scooby-Doo that was laid down by these people telling these stories about the possibility of a lab leak being ridiculous or the obviousness of a market being

27:41.920 --> 27:58.920
an inevitable source of viruses because of the way that they store the animals and these kinds of debates were essential to get us to start thinking in this way to start kidding us to divide into these two groups that was then that were defending

27:58.920 --> 28:15.920
those situations that seemed logical to us relative to the other position but completely out of context and instead within this limited spectrum of debate that was so beautifully laid down by these people

28:16.920 --> 28:37.920
including Tony Fauci including Rand Paul including all of the people that engaged in this active, vocal, very dramatic debate about this duality of lab leak or natural virus

28:37.920 --> 28:49.920
and that's what this idea that I think was best described by Noam Chomsky a limited spectrum of debate but a lively debate within that spectrum

28:49.920 --> 29:00.920
and this gives people the sense that there is free thinking going on while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate

29:01.920 --> 29:11.920
and that's how they've gotten us and our neighbors and our families and our friends to accept the idea that not only was there a virus and still is it circulating but it came from a lab

29:11.920 --> 29:21.920
and that's why it was so dangerous that's why it went around the world because it was enhanced

29:22.920 --> 29:30.920
and this is the trap that they probably more or less already knew they were going to do with this plan right here

29:30.920 --> 29:47.920
this plan was designed to create the Scooby-Doo so that they could orchestrate a dissident narrative that would allow them to slip actors inside of the dissident narrative

29:47.920 --> 29:59.920
so that in the end the dissidents were the ones who were arguing for the lab leak and propelling the narrative that the biosecurity state wants everyone to believe

29:59.920 --> 30:08.920
and so if you don't believe the Fox News narrative the Republican narrative of hits a lab leak that they covered up because they funded it

30:09.920 --> 30:20.920
and Fauci's guilty then you believe the natural virus the inevitable consequences of there being too many people on the planet and global warming etc etc

30:20.920 --> 30:30.920
and that all meshes very well and this is the magic of what they've done to us this is the magic of this plan

30:30.920 --> 30:46.920
magic of having a worse team or case scenario to propel that fear uncertainty and doubt so that people were scared into two distinct groups based on this possibility

30:46.920 --> 30:55.920
without really being able to be allowed to consider the fact that nothing was actually happening because they killed people

30:55.920 --> 31:13.920
people were dying doctors saw people dying but they allowed themselves to be bamboozled and I think of some actors made it seem a lot worse than it was

31:13.920 --> 31:31.920
and the rest is TV history why did they do this well number one to avoid an exponential increase in Medicaid care costs they just killed a lot of old people that were going to cost them millions and millions of dollars over the next five to ten years as they aged out

31:31.920 --> 31:37.920
and this has been predicted for at least ten years before the pandemic you can just look it up

31:37.920 --> 31:46.920
it was going to increase exponentially as the boomers got older and one way to get rid of them is vaccinate them

31:46.920 --> 31:53.920
one way to get rid of them is to say that there's a viral disease and stop giving them antibiotics for pneumonia

31:53.920 --> 32:04.920
protection against growing skepticism in vaccines you may not be aware but right before the pandemic a few years before the pandemic the movie vaxxed came out and the movie vaxxed too came out

32:04.920 --> 32:19.920
there was a lot of momentum with regard to the measles vaccine and that momentum was cut short as the pandemic started

32:20.920 --> 32:31.920
it's probably pretty likely that a transition to digital currency in a controlled manner as part of this it's probably likely that transition to genetic vaccines for the entire population is part of this

32:31.920 --> 32:40.920
it's probably true to confound the toxicity of virus and transfection to allow the pandemic to prove transfection successful for number four

32:40.920 --> 32:52.920
it's probably to transition youth into submission in full digital control this is what Mike Eden is definitely convinced they're really doing is just converting us to digital ID and digital currency

32:52.920 --> 33:05.920
and I don't think he's wrong I think the digital ID for the use of the internet certainly for me to stream at some point it's going to be required for me to have a digital idea I'm never going to be able to do it you know that's coming

33:06.920 --> 33:21.920
I don't know how we get around it but that's what's coming disrupt family formation for a generation maybe that happened maybe it didn't shorten the lifespan of billions of people maybe that happens maybe it doesn't kill billions of people with a gain of function virus

33:21.920 --> 33:38.920
I know destroy the cultural fabric of America and the rest yes sure and to help create the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed I think that might be a possibility

33:39.920 --> 34:07.920
I think to complete their toolkit of control right so one of the things that has been missing from the toolkit of total control has been quarantines and curfews right so now welcome to the new world in America where to get on a bus to go through a subway station if you think that the procedures at the TSA are onerous right guess this is coming to a bus depot near you it's a more invasive way

34:07.920 --> 34:18.920
and the ruling class needs this because let me say if the ruling class ever saw wide-scale civil unrest you'd see an Ebola outbreak in America right along

34:18.920 --> 34:29.920
okay so this is what you see is that Ebola is another tool in the toolbox of the ruling class control to keep down absolutely one hundred percent this is a tool right

34:29.920 --> 34:41.920
Ebola doesn't just magically start spreading and then we have this doctors that come back here the white people of course live the two whites who got it survived all the black people I get it die

34:41.920 --> 34:57.920
it's very possible that these one of these NGOs over there is going around with a veil of Ebola or spreading it from a small plane onto villages the point is to get hundreds of thousands of people infected with it

34:57.920 --> 35:11.920
and create the next phase of control now one of the things I'd like to show to back up my claims here here's a document from the Rockefeller Foundation

35:11.920 --> 35:21.920
Rockefeller Foundation right there you can zoom in on that where my finger is it's called scenarios for the future international development the Rockefeller Foundation

35:21.920 --> 35:34.920
okay let's take a look at what they're saying here this is something like a 50-60 page document I'd like you to go to page 18 if you can look at this up on the internet but I'll read it off to you it's called lockstep

35:34.920 --> 35:49.920
so you've all seen this document before this document shouldn't surprise you he's just talking about operation lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation it's not any it's a document we've looked at before actually

35:49.920 --> 36:02.920
the next step is the one that came before the spars pandemic exercise or document which also was another scenario like this

36:02.920 --> 36:10.920
they're saying that they call it a scenario these are scenario narratives and they speak about it in the past tense so they put out this scenario lockstep

36:10.920 --> 36:27.920
a world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback okay I'll read a little bit of it in 2012 the pandemic that the world had been anticipating

36:27.920 --> 36:41.920
for years nobody was anticipating a pandemic finally hit unlike 2009's N1H1N1 this new influenza strain originating from wild geese they use wild they use some

36:41.920 --> 36:52.920
scenario but this is Ebola they're talking about it even the most pandemic prepared nations were quickly overwhelmed when the virus streaked around the world infecting nearly 20% of the global

36:52.920 --> 37:09.920
population and killing 8 million in just seven months the majority of them healthy young adults the pandemic also had a deadly effect on economies you can see the you can see the agenda just naked law naked

37:09.920 --> 37:24.920
control agenda written down and it's anybody's guess how this becomes effectuated in real life so whether this is written specifically as marching orders or whether people take it upon themselves in the intelligence

37:24.920 --> 37:37.920
networks to say okay well this has been produced so this is the plan here but these narratives have to be written in advance because the intelligence agencies don't know how to do this these narratives they need help so these think tanks

37:37.920 --> 37:47.920
they come up with these like grand corporation Rockefeller Foundation these are think tanks of death they're not the think tanks they're not there to find great ways to help people

37:48.920 --> 38:00.920
okay the pandemic also had a deadly effect on economics international mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt which is what they want they want a completely isolated world

38:00.920 --> 38:13.920
debilitating industries like tourism and breaking global supply chains well of course they want tourism stopped because they don't they're not in the tourism business and they want you at home in your house in front of the TV

38:13.920 --> 38:30.920
then they gotcha because once you watch the TV they own your soul even locally we're on television I mean commercial television let's say national even locally normally bustling shops and offices sat empty for months okay so I love how they talk

38:30.920 --> 38:48.920
about in the past tense in 2010 the pandemic blanketed the planet though disproportionate numbers in Africa died Southeast Asia and Central America where the virus spread like wildfire sounds like the opening monologue of a disaster movie

38:48.920 --> 38:59.920
right now listen to here's the good stuff so you can imagine this keeps going on it actually describes what we just experienced over the last four years almost to a letter

38:59.920 --> 39:12.920
and what you need to see from this is that there is no doubt that what we have experienced is an exercise what we experienced was a planned exercise of governance

39:12.920 --> 39:29.920
and if you see it like a planned exercise of governance a a theater in order for our children to be indoctrinated into this mythology for their lifetimes

39:29.920 --> 39:46.920
that's what they did to us and not everybody's aware some people are unwittingly participating but many of them are aware that they are part of a governing organized governing mechanism that they're

39:46.920 --> 40:04.920
participating in choosing a team because they have demonstrated to the ruling class the most efficient form of authoritarian capitalism so we have capitalism but unfortunately we have this

40:04.920 --> 40:19.920
like they have a spell of democracy this is a very interesting this could continue on okay uh okay China's government was not the only one that took extreme measures to protect its citizens from risk and exposure during them pandemic

40:19.920 --> 40:33.920
national leaders around the world flexed their muscles and so see one of the things that I think I've only just realized is that what the other five eyes countries especially Australian New Zealand

40:33.920 --> 40:49.920
what the role that they played was the illusion that lockdown would prevent the spread of the disease and so they didn't have any mass casualty events in New Zealand and Australia because they weren't required their populations weren't being used for that

40:50.920 --> 41:13.920
their populations were definitely used for the rollout of transfections but they were not used to seed the narrative of the pandemic but some people in New York City were killed in order to seed the narrative of the pandemic some people around the United States were killed in different hospitals in order to

41:13.920 --> 41:29.920
seed the narrative of the pandemic that we know for sure elsewhere in the world I think needs investigation it could be the same in Italy it could be the same in Spain it could be the same in a few other places

41:29.920 --> 41:46.920
early mass casualty events were all that was required two or three weeks of steady illusion and rise in cases was going to be enough for the sage and for the UN and for the who to project worst case scenario

41:46.920 --> 42:02.920
and then we unleashed team worst case scenario around the world on TV and on social media speculating about how bad the worst case scenario may be a billion people are going to die but the knock on effects of a billion people dying

42:02.920 --> 42:12.920
haul their families and the businesses that they work for is just going to be unbelievable that's what we heard that's what we were told

42:17.920 --> 42:30.920
and so it's my sort of estimation that that the eight nine might be kind of bonuses ten is likely not possible

42:30.920 --> 42:39.920
and eleven and twelve are also probably likely very much bonuses of the plan more than likely they knew those were going to happen

42:39.920 --> 42:46.920
the eight and nine might be bonuses that they didn't necessarily need to happen but if it happens that's great

42:46.920 --> 42:59.920
the main thing they needed to do was to get us converted to the idea that vaccines can cure cancer and eventually be personalized for you so that you can get a vaccine for anything

43:00.920 --> 43:09.920
because vaccines are MRNA so we can give you an MRNA that makes you the factory of the medicine that you're going to have and then biologics can be made by you

43:09.920 --> 43:28.920
no more small molecule development no more small molecule trials all biologics and then nucleic acid pro drug biologics that really take the onus away from

43:29.920 --> 43:35.920
manufacturing they don't need to manufacture anything anymore they just need to make RNA

43:39.920 --> 43:47.920
and so I really think the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of any RNA molecule that's how we got here

43:48.920 --> 44:03.920
they controlled the opinion of people that matter they scared people that matter they they threatened people that matter and a combination of winning and unwitting participants in this illusion of solving the mystery of the novel virus

44:04.920 --> 44:14.920
and almost everybody on the screen including myself right here were involved in the solving the mystery of the novel virus and we participated in it for a good long time

44:15.920 --> 44:24.920
the trouble is is that the people who were in on the solving of the mystery in 2020 solved it in 2020

44:25.920 --> 44:36.920
we came to the conclusion that the PCR was garbage we came to the conclusion that these sequences were weird we came to the conclusion that RNA can't do it but we don't really know why yet

44:36.920 --> 44:54.920
and we came to the conclusion that even the suggestion that we can't make immunity to it is absurd but it was all meshing together with this hinting all the time in the background that it might be a lab leak

44:55.920 --> 45:07.920
and of course that's a very exciting thing to figure out it's a very exciting ongoing thing if you think that wow are they lying to us or not are those people really dying or not are those people really falling on the street or not

45:10.920 --> 45:13.920
that's why I started to draw the map a little different because it is a little different

45:16.920 --> 45:23.920
that's why I show this picture in this street because it's important for me for you guys to know

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
that they all know who I am

45:28.920 --> 45:38.920
I've met all of them I've talked to all of them they all say they've seen my stream most of these people say they love what I do

45:42.920 --> 45:47.920
and yet somehow or another somehow or another we're here in 2024

45:48.920 --> 46:11.920
and I'm still just some goofball with less than 3,000 followers on Twitch and these people are selling books and traveling the world not that I want that I want my biology out there because that's really what this is about if my biology was out there it would all be fine

46:12.920 --> 46:26.920
if Bobby's book was selling great and people were reading the biology that I put in there and then saying hey you got this part wrong Jay you're saying all kinds of stuff about the diffuse proposal Jay what's this crap all about that would be perfect

46:26.920 --> 46:33.920
but they're not it's just silence, crickets, crickets about clones, crickets about RNA fidelity, crickets about T cell immunity, crickets about the ridiculous nature of presenting antibodies as being seminal to combating a respiratory

46:57.920 --> 46:59.920
disease or a respiratory RNA virus

47:02.920 --> 47:10.920
what is going on ladies and gentlemen how is it possible that in 2024 I'm still basically where I was in 2021

47:11.920 --> 47:13.920
have I gotten at that wrong?

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
is my teaching that obtuse?

47:16.920 --> 47:18.920
are my presentations so disorganized?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.920
it's very hard to tell what's going on

47:22.920 --> 47:29.920
but I know it's something bigger than just you know random algorithm stuff

47:32.920 --> 47:36.920
did I turn that off did you see who's back there? yeah I think I did

47:42.920 --> 47:50.920
and so this whole thing you know it took me three years to see through this crap that we had been led to believe is possible

47:52.920 --> 48:01.920
and the plan was to scare everyone the plan was to use this illusion of consensus about a worst case scenario to scare everyone to taking a transfection to eliminate the control group

48:02.920 --> 48:10.920
and to move forward with the idea that everybody has accepted that there are pandemics and sometimes you're just gonna have to suck it up and take a shot

48:11.920 --> 48:13.920
but they didn't get us that far

48:14.920 --> 48:18.920
in a lot of countries they didn't get us that far but the kids got really far

48:19.920 --> 48:21.920
and the books are still coming out

48:26.920 --> 48:32.920
and in reality that book is 500 pages and there's a few quotes of me and that's it

48:33.920 --> 48:40.920
the rest is stories of other people and those stories are mostly about a lab leak and mostly about bad guy china

48:41.920 --> 48:45.920
and mostly about bad guy eco health and bad guy this and bad guy that

48:46.920 --> 48:53.920
nothing about the possibility that biosecurity state dominance could be achieved also by illusion

48:57.920 --> 49:04.920
and that RNA viruses are a very very very very wonderful opportunity for an illusion

49:05.920 --> 49:19.920
that could really just be the deployment of of biologics in the wild and testing how they work all under the guise of well there's viruses out there

49:20.920 --> 49:28.920
imagine this as a distinct possibility before we write off everything and just say that there's a lot of stuff out there going around

49:29.920 --> 49:35.920
that's the challenge of this that's the problem with these worst case scenario people

49:36.920 --> 49:38.920
that's why this plan worked so well

49:41.920 --> 49:48.920
because even the people who were allowed to say that there was no virus or that the PCR was crap

49:49.920 --> 49:53.920
were also controlling a narrative because they didn't say well they're killing people in America

49:54.920 --> 49:57.920
that's how they that's what's happened in New York they killed people

49:59.920 --> 50:07.920
they didn't come to that realization until it was too late

50:10.920 --> 50:14.920
they shrugged it all off as nonsense even though we were killing people

50:16.920 --> 50:20.920
and then we started using remdesivir and killed people in a different way again

50:21.920 --> 50:24.920
even after we purported to figure out the ventilator problem

50:25.920 --> 50:27.920
it was layer upon layer

50:33.920 --> 50:36.920
and the worst case scenario people were ignoring all of that

50:37.920 --> 50:39.920
and still continue to this day

50:40.920 --> 50:44.920
attributes 7 million people dying to a virus more than 1 million people in America

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
and nobody got killed by remdesivir

50:47.920 --> 50:49.920
no one was killed by the lack of antibiotics

50:50.920 --> 50:52.920
nobody was killed by ventilation

50:52.920 --> 50:59.920
nobody was killed by any bad bad protocols or are allowing the opioid crisis to go crazy

51:00.920 --> 51:02.920
nobody was killed by that for these people

51:04.920 --> 51:09.920
worst case scenario people say that it's amyloid and prion and amyloid is everywhere

51:10.920 --> 51:13.920
and the spike protein was was juiced up

51:14.920 --> 51:18.920
fear and cleavage site fear and cleavage site fear and cleavage site

51:18.920 --> 51:20.920
where did that story go now?

51:23.920 --> 51:27.920
the fear and cleavage site occupied almost 5 or 6 months of 2020

51:28.920 --> 51:33.920
where that story go now the worst case scenario team has been so instrumental

51:36.920 --> 51:38.920
and making sure that the scooby-doo is followed

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
foot by foot

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
inch by inch

51:44.920 --> 51:47.920
just it's literally turning into worst case scenario

51:48.920 --> 51:50.920
and depending on who's car you got into

51:51.920 --> 51:54.920
you heard the same thing over and over again

51:55.920 --> 51:58.920
that led to a faith in a novel virus that didn't question vaccination

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
didn't question the PCR test

52:01.920 --> 52:02.920
didn't question variants

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
didn't question asymptomatic spread

52:05.920 --> 52:06.920
and didn't question gain of function research

52:06.920 --> 52:09.920
that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario

52:10.920 --> 52:12.920
and four years later he's saying the same crap

52:13.920 --> 52:14.920
we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
and they all are

52:17.920 --> 52:19.920
they're all saying the same crap still

52:20.920 --> 52:21.920
I'm afraid that the latest

52:21.920 --> 52:22.920
even

52:23.920 --> 52:31.920
our friend

52:32.920 --> 52:34.920
what would you have heard

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
in 2020?

52:35.920 --> 52:37.920
what would have happened to you and where would you be now?

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
let's just think about that

52:40.920 --> 52:42.920
let's just think about that for a second

52:43.920 --> 52:45.920
if you would have gotten in the car with John Goodman

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
can I play media?

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
I'm going to escape out of there

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
and now I think it will

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
play the media

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
actually a famous actor

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
when they're not

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
right that's one thing

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
you're used to that in New York City

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
right

53:02.920 --> 53:03.920
right

53:03.920 --> 53:05.920
but to see somebody get up in front of

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
the global press

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
from the World Headquarters at WHO

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
and call himself a doctor

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
suggesting he is a medical doctor

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
but he is not

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
you know

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
right there

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
I say no wait a minute

53:19.920 --> 53:20.920
a table

53:20.920 --> 53:22.920
or chain is as strong as its weakest link

53:23.920 --> 53:25.920
so in the global health interconnected world

53:26.920 --> 53:27.920
we have a system

53:27.920 --> 53:30.920
where the United States is for that expensive

53:31.920 --> 53:33.920
pretty good health infrastructure

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
around this country

53:36.920 --> 53:37.920
Ethiopia

53:37.920 --> 53:39.920
the country where this Nimrod is from

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
you know after all these years

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
and billions and billions of dollars

53:44.920 --> 53:45.920
still has very few doctors

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
very few nurses

53:48.920 --> 53:50.920
no to Ethiopia

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
from the Global Fund

53:53.920 --> 53:54.920
and from other places

53:54.920 --> 53:55.920
with all of that

53:56.920 --> 53:57.920
under the direction

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
in the history of Tedros

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
we are left behind

53:59.920 --> 54:00.920
with a system

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
in Ethiopia

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
that is not equipped to cope

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
with this pandemic

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
I mean you talk about

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
the problems we have

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
in

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
in England

54:11.920 --> 54:12.920
with 70 million people

54:12.920 --> 54:13.920
or 65 million people

54:13.920 --> 54:14.920
Ethiopia has

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
almost 110 million people

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
wow

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
and this idiot

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
you know who did a poor job

54:20.920 --> 54:21.920
as Health Minister in Ethiopia

54:22.920 --> 54:23.920
gets promoted upwards

54:24.920 --> 54:25.920
now he's the head of

54:25.920 --> 54:26.920
and we're listening to him

54:26.920 --> 54:28.920
what is he a doctor

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
oh he's not again

54:29.920 --> 54:30.920
he's a PhD

54:30.920 --> 54:31.920
and I don't know what

54:31.920 --> 54:32.920
so I mean that's kind of weird

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
that you'd make the head

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
of the World Health Organization

54:36.920 --> 54:37.920
a doctor in something

54:37.920 --> 54:38.920
other than medicine

54:39.920 --> 54:40.920
I would even go as far as saying

54:40.920 --> 54:42.920
look we know Dr. Corsi

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
is a PhD in political science

54:45.920 --> 54:46.920
and you know he's sometimes

54:46.920 --> 54:47.920
comments on

54:47.920 --> 54:48.920
obviously

54:48.920 --> 54:49.920
coronavirus is national news

54:50.920 --> 54:51.920
so he's commenting on it

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
but I don't think he ever

54:53.920 --> 54:54.920
makes any kind of

54:54.920 --> 54:56.920
effort to imply

54:56.920 --> 54:57.920
that he's anything

54:57.920 --> 54:58.920
other than a doctor

54:58.920 --> 54:59.920
of political science

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
and when we have

55:00.920 --> 55:01.920
somebody who's the head

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
of the World Health Organization

55:03.920 --> 55:05.920
I think people would assume

55:05.920 --> 55:07.920
he's a medical doctor

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
is that not the person

55:08.920 --> 55:09.920
who's doing that right now

55:09.920 --> 55:11.920
Charles, there's a guy

55:11.920 --> 55:13.920
named Dr. Paul Cottrell

55:13.920 --> 55:15.920
who looks at this bus pass

55:16.920 --> 55:17.920
this too shall pass

55:17.920 --> 55:18.920
we're here in

55:18.920 --> 55:19.920
Astor Place

55:19.920 --> 55:20.920
for people who don't know

55:20.920 --> 55:21.920
New York

55:21.920 --> 55:22.920
when I was writing for the

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
look at that

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
black cube, Charles

55:24.920 --> 55:25.920
it turns

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
you can turn

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
I know

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
but it's like an

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
evil thing

55:29.920 --> 55:30.920
the black cube

55:30.920 --> 55:31.920
has symbolism of

55:31.920 --> 55:32.920
something

55:32.920 --> 55:34.920
so I used to write

55:34.920 --> 55:35.920
when I'd write my

55:35.920 --> 55:36.920
college for the Sunday

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
Washington Times

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
I used to write it

55:38.920 --> 55:39.920
in there

55:39.920 --> 55:40.920
and you'd see

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
a lot of very famous

55:41.920 --> 55:42.920
people in that

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
particular Starbucks

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
well there's a

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
hit neighborhood

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
Don Ainas used to

55:46.920 --> 55:47.920
live in that building

55:47.920 --> 55:48.920
which one

55:48.920 --> 55:49.920
one Astor Place

55:49.920 --> 55:50.920
right on the corner

55:50.920 --> 55:51.920
over there

55:51.920 --> 55:53.920
and this is like

55:53.920 --> 55:54.920
NYU territory

55:54.920 --> 55:55.920
721

55:55.920 --> 55:56.920
Broadway is

55:56.920 --> 55:57.920
right over there

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
so this was kind of

55:58.920 --> 55:59.920
like my

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
stomping ground

56:00.920 --> 56:01.920
in college

56:01.920 --> 56:02.920
are you sure

56:02.920 --> 56:03.920
you're hanging out

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
wasn't over there

56:04.920 --> 56:05.920
well

56:05.920 --> 56:06.920
so wait

56:06.920 --> 56:07.920
will we just stop for a

56:07.920 --> 56:08.920
second

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
there's Cooper Union

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
so we finished on

56:10.920 --> 56:11.920
Ted Rose

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
we haven't even

56:12.920 --> 56:13.920
we will stop the story

56:13.920 --> 56:14.920
on Ted Rose in

56:14.920 --> 56:15.920
2009

56:15.920 --> 56:16.920
and say

56:16.920 --> 56:17.920
there's a lot more

56:17.920 --> 56:18.920
coming on

56:18.920 --> 56:19.920
Ted Rose

56:19.920 --> 56:20.920
and how he got

56:20.920 --> 56:21.920
to be head of the

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
WHO

56:22.920 --> 56:23.920
whether the WHO

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
indeed manages

56:24.920 --> 56:25.920
any money

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
properly

56:26.920 --> 56:29.920
the donors to the

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
WHO

56:30.920 --> 56:31.920
beyond individual

56:31.920 --> 56:32.920
nations

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
include the

56:33.920 --> 56:34.920
Gates Foundation

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
Bloomberg Philanthropies

56:35.920 --> 56:37.920
Rockefeller Foundation

56:37.920 --> 56:38.920
only it has way

56:38.920 --> 56:39.920
too much money

56:39.920 --> 56:41.920
if you punch into

56:41.920 --> 56:42.920
Google

56:42.920 --> 56:43.920
WHO fraud and

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
corruption

56:44.920 --> 56:45.920
you will get

56:45.920 --> 56:46.920
there are more

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
hotels first law

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
I mean

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
you'll find

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
all sorts of

56:50.920 --> 56:51.920
stuff in there

56:51.920 --> 56:52.920
so more on that

56:52.920 --> 56:53.920
in another broadcast

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
but just quickly

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
on this guy Dr. Paul

56:55.920 --> 56:56.920
control

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
he's like

56:57.920 --> 56:58.920
you know

56:58.920 --> 56:59.920
he presents himself

56:59.920 --> 57:00.920
as a Harvard doctor

57:00.920 --> 57:01.920
he's talking about

57:01.920 --> 57:02.920
medical subjects

57:02.920 --> 57:03.920
he's come on the social

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
media scene

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
during this

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
coronavirus outbreak

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
and I think a lot

57:07.920 --> 57:08.920
of people

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
automatically

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
myself included

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
presumed he was

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
a medical doctor

57:12.920 --> 57:13.920
and I had reached

57:13.920 --> 57:14.920
out to him

57:14.920 --> 57:15.920
for several weeks

57:15.920 --> 57:16.920
to try to get him

57:16.920 --> 57:17.920
on the show

57:17.920 --> 57:18.920
careful

57:18.920 --> 57:19.920
to try to talk to the

57:19.920 --> 57:20.920
guy

57:20.920 --> 57:21.920
let's just focus

57:21.920 --> 57:22.920
on

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
sure

57:23.920 --> 57:24.920
and he's been

57:24.920 --> 57:25.920
avoiding me

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
he's been appearing

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
on other shows

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
and I've heard him

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
mispronounce medical

57:29.920 --> 57:30.920
terms

57:30.920 --> 57:31.920
and he's driving

57:31.920 --> 57:32.920
panic

57:32.920 --> 57:33.920
so if Dr. Paul

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
control sees this

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
it's no longer

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
an invitation to

57:36.920 --> 57:37.920
appear on the show

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
it's a challenge

57:38.920 --> 57:39.920
to appear on the show

57:39.920 --> 57:40.920
and answer questions

57:40.920 --> 57:41.920
as to why

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
a non-MD

57:42.920 --> 57:43.920
is putting forward

57:43.920 --> 57:44.920
this inflammatory

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
information

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
because there's

57:46.920 --> 57:48.920
a lot of people

57:48.920 --> 57:49.920
who have been

57:49.920 --> 57:50.920
inflaming

57:50.920 --> 57:51.920
and doctors

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
are guilty too

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
yeah

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
that's a good idea

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
so where would you be

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
if you got into the car

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
with Jason

57:57.920 --> 57:58.920
Goodman

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
in 2020

57:59.920 --> 58:00.920
well

58:00.920 --> 58:01.920
you would have been

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
wondering

58:02.920 --> 58:03.920
who Paul

58:03.920 --> 58:04.920
control is

58:04.920 --> 58:05.920
watching his

58:05.920 --> 58:06.920
streams

58:06.920 --> 58:07.920
and trying to figure

58:07.920 --> 58:08.920
out why

58:08.920 --> 58:09.920
he was faking it

58:09.920 --> 58:10.920
maybe you would have

58:10.920 --> 58:11.920
seen me on a stream

58:11.920 --> 58:12.920
with Paul

58:12.920 --> 58:13.920
control

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
and then

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
Kevin McCarran

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
thought Kevin McCarran

58:16.920 --> 58:17.920
was a real guy

58:17.920 --> 58:18.920
and the other guys

58:18.920 --> 58:19.920
were fake

58:19.920 --> 58:20.920
but this guy

58:20.920 --> 58:21.920
would have set you up

58:21.920 --> 58:22.920
to think that

58:22.920 --> 58:23.920
like he was also

58:23.920 --> 58:31.920
onto Paul

58:31.920 --> 58:32.920
control

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
so maybe you would

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
think that

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
Kevin McCarran

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
and me

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
going after Paul

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
control

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
and a couple of those

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
streams

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
would convince you

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
to follow me

58:43.920 --> 58:45.920
and the

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
show is on

58:46.920 --> 58:47.920
right

58:47.920 --> 58:49.920
except none of those

58:49.920 --> 58:50.920
guys ever

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
said

58:51.920 --> 58:52.920
my name

58:52.920 --> 58:53.920
none of those guys

58:53.920 --> 58:54.920
ever promoted me

58:54.920 --> 58:55.920
I got absorbed

58:55.920 --> 58:56.920
by them

58:56.920 --> 58:58.920
and I think

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
what you're seeing here

58:59.920 --> 59:00.920
is already

59:00.920 --> 59:01.920
what happened

59:01.920 --> 59:02.920
already way back then

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
we have players

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
being played

59:04.920 --> 59:06.920
and rivalries

59:06.920 --> 59:08.920
being set up

59:08.920 --> 59:10.920
so that

59:10.920 --> 59:11.920
people

59:11.920 --> 59:12.920
get funneled

59:12.920 --> 59:13.920
into these

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
false

59:14.920 --> 59:15.920
sort of

59:15.920 --> 59:16.920
rivalries

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
false

59:17.920 --> 59:18.920
false

59:18.920 --> 59:19.920
you know

59:19.920 --> 59:20.920
I'm checking up

59:20.920 --> 59:21.920
on him

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
I'm checking up on him

59:22.920 --> 59:23.920
they're all connected

59:23.920 --> 59:24.920
through

59:24.920 --> 59:25.920
George Webb

59:25.920 --> 59:27.920
they've all

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
been in a car

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
with him

59:29.920 --> 59:32.920
and so where would you be

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
if you fell

59:33.920 --> 59:34.920
on

59:34.920 --> 59:35.920
Addie

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
ads page

59:36.920 --> 59:37.920
or you fell

59:37.920 --> 59:38.920
on

59:38.920 --> 59:39.920
Jason

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
and

59:41.920 --> 59:42.920
I'm going to

59:42.920 --> 59:43.920
follow

59:43.920 --> 59:44.920
George Webb

59:44.920 --> 59:45.920
or you

59:45.920 --> 59:46.920
stumbled

59:46.920 --> 59:47.920
on Mark

59:47.920 --> 59:48.920
you might all

59:48.920 --> 59:49.920
be one

59:49.920 --> 59:50.920
great big

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
web of people

59:51.920 --> 59:52.920
and if any

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
of those people

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
are any

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
good

59:55.920 --> 59:56.920
they would have

59:56.920 --> 59:57.920
been

59:57.920 --> 59:58.920
sucked up

59:58.920 --> 59:59.920
and absorbed

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920
and

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920
drowned out

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920
by the

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920
people

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920
that weren't

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920
and as we moved

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920
through the

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920
pandemic

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
we know

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920
that the

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
people

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
were

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920
all right

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
I mean I met

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920
him in person

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920
and then within a month

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920
he was

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920
calling us

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
Bush league

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
and

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
telling us

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
to

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
F off

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Paul

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920
Catrell

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
we've known has

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
been

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
faked since the very

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920
beginning of the

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
pandemic

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920
but oddly enough

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
nobody really

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920
called him out

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920
they kind of did

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920
but not really

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920
like he was

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
a

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920
creator

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.920
and if you would have

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920
stayed in the car

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920
with these guys

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920
you would believe

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920
that it was the

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920
1918

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
flu

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
revisited

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920
right now

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920
and that

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920
Fauci covered

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920
that up

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
by calling it a

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920
coronavirus

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920
or that there

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920
might be

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920
two viruses

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
out there

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920
a SARS virus

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920
and

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920
the 1918

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920
flu

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
revived

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920
this road

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920
and you got

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920
picked up by these guys

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.920
and guess what

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
millions of

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.920
people died

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920
millions more

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
were saved

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920
from a novel

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920
virus

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920
and they didn't

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920
question a

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920
darn thing

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920
and it didn't

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920
matter what car you

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920
got into

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920
because you were

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920
always going to get

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920
picked up

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920
by one of these

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920
people you didn't

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920
you couldn't even listen

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920
to somebody

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920
as wise as

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Jordan Peterson

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920
who can

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920
teach you

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920
about human

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920
behavior

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920
and you

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920
feel real

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920
good about the

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920
psychological

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920
disarray

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920
that the

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920
pandemic put you

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920
in.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920
He made you feel

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920
real

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920
good about

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
not understanding

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920
it was

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920
so complicated

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920
you just gave up.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920
He made you feel

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920
real

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920
good about

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920
being scared.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920
He told

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920
you to

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.920
take the

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.920
damn

01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920
shot and get it

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920
over with

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.920
because it

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.920
could have been

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920
a hell

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.920
of a

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.920
lot of

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.720
serious

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.920
infections.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.920
I mean

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920
it's just laughable.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920
It's not a matter

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.920
of what is true

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920
that counts.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920
It's a matter

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920
of what is perceived

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
to be true.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920
Mr.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920
Kissinger said

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
and these

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920
people have

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920
been engaged

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920
in making sure

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920
happened.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
It's a national

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920
security priority

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
it's a national security

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920
priority

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920
it's a national

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
security

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.240
it's a national security operation. That's why they keep doing it. That's why they don't tell us.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.520
That's why they're so convinced. They're so certain because they're certain that if they

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:52.000
stick to the narrative, nobody will take away their comfort and fame. So we're still in the

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:04.960
car with these people. A car to nowhere. A car that is defined by this faith in a novel virus,

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.600
this idea that there is now a terrible new variant out there that is a result of the

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:19.280
Merrick's disease-like enrichment for virulence. Vincent Rancin-Yellow says that no, it's not

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.120
enrichment for virulence. It's fitness and virulence comes along with that.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.840
And here at Funded Bulsh has been saying this from

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:41.200
from, I believe, I believe January of 2021. He has been saying that the vaccine may start to enrich

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.520
variants. And in fact, I believe we were already talking about the vaccine like AstraZeneca

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.720
actually influencing the virus already back in 2020. And it was actually,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:03.280
myself, I tweeted the Merrick's disease paper, I think, in January of 2021 or December of 2020.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.240
And so let's listen to Heron Funded Bulsh and Steve Kirsch.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.720
Let's see what they discover here.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.200
Um, are that they wouldn't show up to find out the truth about the vaccines.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.880
And in fact, there are a few people that left early.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.200
Or I was, they were, oh, without any further ado, I want to bring on our special guest of honor

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.800
this evening, Dr. Gert, Vanden Bosch. Welcome, Dr. Gert. How are you doing?

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.160
Yeah, Bell, thanks. I'm doing fine. Still very much concentrated on my favorite topic.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.120
Actually, let me read your bio before I leave you two to have a chat so that people know who you

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.840
are. You received your DVM from University of Gents in Belgium and a PhD in virology from

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.080
the University of Hohenheim, Germany. After a career in academia, Gert worked for several large

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.320
vaccine manufacturers in R&D and late development, went on to join the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.320
global health discovery team as senior program officer, and then the Gavi Alliance for Global

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.760
Vaccination in Geneva as senior Ebola program manager. And remind me, I want to ask you about

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.040
the World Health Organization later. Gert subsequently became the head of the vaccine

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.040
development office at the German Center for Infection Research in Cologne. You are now

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.880
primarily serving as biotech vaccine consultant while also conducting your own research on natural

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.560
killer cell-based vaccines. You're a creative thinker, innovator, entrepreneur, and visionary

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.600
who, as we noted at the top of the show, have been warning the world about the dangers of

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.160
COVID mass vaccination program in the middle of a pandemic. You can check out your new book on

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.720
this topic. Let me fly out a quick shot of your book cover there. It's called the Inescapable

01:05:54.720 --> 01:06:00.320
Immune Escape Pandemic. We'll put the links in the chat. And again, a fine welcome. Inescapable,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.560
Inescapable Immune Escape Pandemic. That's pretty funny. What I'm looking for is a stimulating

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:11.440
conversation. Sure. Thanks. All right. Gert, good to see you. So anything, you know, we've all read

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.120
your predictions and so forth and advice. Is there anything like new that would have changed

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.080
anything that you've said that you recently learned like, oh, you suddenly decided that

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.760
new information shows that the COVID vaccines are safe and you were wrong? Or, you know, anything

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.800
that anything new that we should know, any updates or, you know, what's the biggest thing

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.160
top your mind right now? Well, the biggest thing right now, and it's only, you know, you can only

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.080
frame this if you follow the evolution of the virus. And of course, also the new response,

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:44.080
as the virus is evolving, also the new response is changing. And so, I mean, the devil is in the

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.680
detail. So there's many things that at first glance don't seem very important. But for example,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:57.200
the fact that there is now the G and one lineage that is growing very fast and that is, for the

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:04.800
first time, incorporating a number of mutations that are, in fact, enhancing the

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:12.240
reproductiveness of the virus and that are not located in the spike movie, that is very, very new

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:19.280
and very, very, very soon. Yeah, it's, of course, complex. But what we see is that in the meantime,

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.120
not only, I guess, in the US, in several different states, but also in Europe, hospitalization

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.040
rates and even mortality rates due to COVID or, or again, climbing. And if you put all these,

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:39.280
all these factors together, there is at least, from my viewpoint, a reason for big, big concern

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.160
that we are in the last straight line to what I've been predicting since quite a long time,

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.320
which is the emergence of, of a new variant that would have the capacity to cause

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:56.000
highly virulent, very severe disease in highly vaccinated populations. We can talk about how

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.960
these things are connected. None of these is unfortunately very, very simple, but it's very

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.600
clear. What is very clear is that so far, the mutations that we have seen were very much

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:13.440
concentrated on the spike protein. And as we have seen after the advent of Omicron, in fact,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.240
the mutations have become less and less selective in a sense that, at the beginning, they were

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.000
primarily focused on the receptor binding domain. And then we have seen several different

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.520
mutations in spike that were no longer located in the receptor binding domain, what we are seeing

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.280
right now. And of course, as I was always saying, it's, it's, it's not a coincidence that we are

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.160
vaccinating with vaccines that are targeting, of course, spike. And it's not a coincidence that

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.800
the immunodominant domain within spike is the receptor binding domain. So in fact, every single

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.560
time that you see mutations that become dominant, the question should be, the question should be,

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.120
what is the kind of immune pressure that the population is exerting on the virus? So I give

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.600
one example, when Omicron came all of a sudden, some people were saying, well, this is kind of

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.280
like another virus that the stakeholders put in the game to prolong the pandemic. And even

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.960
very intelligent people, very intelligent scientists have been saying that this was not

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.800
a natural evolution, and that something was very suspicious because the virus could not

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.440
naturally evolve in that way. And then, of course, you come in the whole realm of conspiracy

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.920
theories, et cetera. And then I'm always saying to people, listen, you cannot, you cannot understand

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.560
the evolution of the virus. If you don't understand the kind of immune pressure that the population

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.280
is putting on the virus, if that pressure is such that it requires a virus in order to survive,

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.600
to implement a number of mutations, even, you know, very suddenly, like Omicron did,

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.040
then there is no surprise that all of a sudden the virus can change dramatically.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.040
And, of course, one could say, well, you know, the mortality rates are pretty low still,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.480
and hospitalization rates, et cetera. And, for example, GN1 is not more virulent than the

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.080
other co-circulating variants, et cetera. So this is all part of the narrative, and this

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.840
is all part of the interpretation of those who have no deep understanding of this evolution.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.040
But what I'm saying is that, for example, GN1 is now very, very some, not because of its intrinsic

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.680
virulence, but because of its high infectiousness. So, so far, what we're seeing is that the antibodies

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.520
that are still prevailing in vaccinees have an infection mitigating effect. So they can still

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.320
mitigate, mitigate infection. But, of course, they cannot, they cannot prevent the infection,

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.640
and it's very interesting. I'm sure you guys are aware of these papers that I'm debunking all the

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:29.600
time, where scientists are trying to demonstrate that the antibodies in vaccinees have still neutralizing

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.560
capacity. So this is a very strange phenomenon. If you have, for example, neutralizing antibodies,

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.520
or antibodies that used to be neutralizing, but that are no longer neutralizing, but they are

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.920
present, for example, in very high concentration, because vaccinees get all the time and re-exposed

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.520
to the virus, which, by the way, circulating virus-decided infections, or they get boosted by this mRNA

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.320
boost, then you get exceptionally high titers of antibodies that, in fact, are no longer neutralizing.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.960
At this very high concentration, they can still, they can still bind to the virus in a way that

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.880
it is, like, protected from the receptors. That is only possible at very high concentrations.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:08.000
You see immediately that when the concentrations go down, the effect is no longer neutralizing,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.080
but it is an infection mitigating effect. And that mitigating effect is, in fact,

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.080
due to the fact that the antibodies that are no longer neutralizing can still, I call this,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.760
it's, sorry, it's a little bit complicated, or hydrophilizing the virus. So, in fact,

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.920
they are stabilizing the virus in the ecosystem, so that it is more stabilized in the ecosystem,

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.120
and it does not have contact with the cells, so that mitigates the infection.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:33.680
So, what do we...

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.000
So, I'm in a positive here for a second. He's a biotech research consultant who's been pushing

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.200
the idea of a VAX, imperfect vaccination, enriching the virus in various ways since about 2021.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:54.320
We are currently at the J1 lineage, and the first time that our mutations are enhancing

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.640
the reproductivity of the virus, according to him, and these changes are not found in the spike

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:05.360
protein, but are elsewhere. It's interesting that he doesn't say what protein it is found in. Of course,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.560
there is a limited number, and we know that a few of those proteins, anyway, in their mythology,

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.440
are responsible for proofreading and this kind of stuff. So, it's very curious that he doesn't

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:22.480
tell us what proteins these mutations are found in, but COVID rates are climbing, and therefore,

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:29.520
his prediction of an inescapable, immune escape pandemic coming from a new variant that will,

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:35.920
in fact, vaccinated populations, this COVID rates climbing seems to be indicative of that. So,

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.960
after Omicron, there were changes that were in the receptor binding domain, then they started

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:46.720
to change outside of the receptor binding domain, even though the immunodominant site of

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.600
the spike protein is expected to be the receptor binding domain. This is, of course,

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.280
all virology 101. We should know this by now. They've been telling us this for four years on every

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.520
channel, on every social media, every, every crazy worst case scenario person knows these basic

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:10.240
things. That's why viruses are real. So, what kind of pressure, what kind of immune pressure are we

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.520
putting on the virus? We have to understand that in order to understand what's going on with the

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:27.040
evolution, particularly throat, if we want to understand the evolution of the virus. So,

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.880
he actually toys with the idea. This is funny.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:47.280
He toys with the idea that people had blamed Omicron on a sort of conspiracy theory where they

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:55.440
released the virus, like it was a planned second release, stakeholders added it to extend the

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.520
pandemic. And then he makes fun of that as an interesting, Matt Crawford is actually somebody

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.440
who said that this might be a white hat addition to the pandemic, like a live vaccine. And even

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:14.640
Brett Weinstein waxed intellectual about that possibility, I think. Anyway, J1N1 is not more

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:23.520
virulent. It's highly infectious. And so, again, there are all these special attributes to viruses

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:30.640
which are given to viruses that aren't even given to pathogens that are full-blown pattern

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.600
integrity. You know, have a genetic code, they replicate on their own, this kind of thing.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.080
They have attributes that regular pattern integrity like other species of living organism

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.800
don't have, like infectiousness, which is difference than virulence.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.760
I just want you to notice this now that after all that discussion, we went right back to antibodies

01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:01.760
and neutralizing antibodies being relevant to this. And we know from, you know, people as diverse as

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:11.600
myself to Jolie that antibodies can't cross the blood lung barrier. So what in the world do we need

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.480
antibodies in our blood for and that the antibodies in our blood can only potentially contribute to

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:23.120
clotting and other activation of the immune system that's going to be maladaptive.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.640
So we'll just keep this running here and I'll keep taking some notes. Maybe I'll leave it up

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.800
there for a little while and see how that works out. The thing right now is, and that is the reason

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.800
there's antibodies in order, how is this possible? Well, this is simple possible because these antibodies

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.440
do not match very well with the epitopes of the circulating virus and therefore they have low

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.400
affinity. And that is what low affinity antibodies do. They can't so lubilize, so to say the virus without

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:56.320
really neutralizing it. And this kind of effect is due, as I was saying, to low affinity and low

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:04.240
affinity of antibodies means also that the specificity for the associated epitopes is becoming lower

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:11.520
and lower. So low affinity means low specificity for the for the associated epitopes. That is also

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.920
why you see that the immune escape has become broader and broader. So after Omicron came,

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.200
we had what is called in the literature, large scale immune escape. No longer really focused.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.800
Initially, we had this convergent evolution towards very specific size within spike routine.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.280
Now what we're seeing right now is a large scale evolution where several different

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.960
science epitopes are targeted within spike. So what we're seeing right now is that the

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:42.960
specificity with the G and one, the specificity is no longer. It's weird because he was just saying

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.080
earlier that these changes are not occurring in spike and now he's saying large scale evolution

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.520
in the spike. So I'm not sure he's being totally consistent here. I'm just going to keep listening.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.120
It's no longer targeted at spike routine. So that means the immune pressure is no longer on spike

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.960
alone. And that is where you start to see other changes or changes in other viral proteins

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.080
that however are still are still enhancing the infectiousness of the virus. And remember,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.400
even if antibodies have an infection mitigating effect, the infection mitigating is not infection

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.560
neutralizing. Infection mitigating means suboptimal. Optimal would be neutralization. Suboptimal is

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.240
infection mitigating. Because of this infection mitigating effect, you continue immune escape,

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.560
of course, because suboptimal immune pressure leads to immune selection of more infectious

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.640
variants. That's what we have seen all the time, all the variants that we've seen so far were

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.480
characterized by greater by higher infection, infectiousness compared to the predisicism.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.880
And so what we see right now is that this infectious pressure has become even broader

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.960
and it has now also affected other proteins, other viral proteins. And that is very, very

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.720
some because according to my analysis, and I've written this or I've documented this in my book,

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.520
what is right now, but is right now controlling the infectiousness in vaccinees or

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:09.680
CDL responses, cytotoxic T cells, cytotoxic T cells that are have very, very low specificity.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.600
And so that is, that is also why now the mutations or the mutants that are prevailing like GN1

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.560
have no longer this specificity, which is targeted as spike protein and other proteins are involved.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.240
But what is important to realize is that this CDL activity,

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.960
so you have T cells, you have helper T cells, you have cytotoxic T cells. Now all the activity

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.320
is focused on the CDLs. And this cytotoxic T cells will of course prevent T helper cells from

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.240
coming into the play. And these T helper cells are required to boost non-neutralizing antibodies.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.240
And these non-neutralizing antibodies, as I described in my book as well, are responsible for inhibiting

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:51.360
the virulence of the virus. So what we are seeing right now is that the antibodies, the non-neutralizing

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.520
antibodies that prevent, so to say severe disease, due to COVID and prevent virulence,

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.320
are declining because of enhanced activity of the CDL responses and how do we know that

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.840
there is enhanced activity of the CDL responses because the pressure.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:10.400
So as I understand it, he's saying that cytotoxic lymphocyte response to specificity is dropping.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:19.200
But the response is still dominated by cytotoxic lymphocytes. And so they stop

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.680
T helper cells and prevent non-neutralizing antibodies from being produced.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:35.360
And it used to be a few years ago that non-neutralizing antibodies were the ones that could cause

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.000
antibody-dependent enhancement because they could lock the spike protein in the open position after

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.240
fear and cleavage. Remember all this stuff? From 2020, all these cartoons that people talked about,

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:51.040
all these studies that people showed with how the spike protein could be cleaved and then how

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.040
it changed shape and then antibodies could stabilize it in that position. And therefore,

01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.320
it could go into any tissue it wanted to after fear and cleavage, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.240
Those were all non-neutralizing antibodies that did that. So now he's talking about cytotoxic T

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:12.160
cells dropping in specificity, starting to dominate the response, preventing cytoty- or T helper cells

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:19.120
from activating B cells to produce non-neutralizing antibodies. It's really strange.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:30.240
And not at all consistent across even weeks, never mind months or years.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:38.880
Vaccinees or CTL responses, cytotoxic T cells, cytotoxic T cells that have very, very low

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:44.640
specificity. And so that is also why now the mutations or the mutants that are prevailing,

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.760
like GN1, have no longer this specificity, which is started as spike protein and other proteins

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:55.680
are involved. But what is important to realize is that this CTL activity, so you have T cells,

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.600
you have helper T cells, you have cytotoxic T cells. Now, all the activity is focused on the

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:05.200
CTLs. And this cytotoxic T cells will, of course, prevent T helper cells from coming into the play.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.080
And these T helper cells are required to boost non-neutralizing antibodies,

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.360
and these non-neutralizing antibodies, as I described in my book as well, are responsible for

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.560
inhibiting the virulence of the virus. So what we are seeing right now is that the antibodies,

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.720
the non-neutralizing antibodies that prevent, so to say severe disease, due to COVID and prevent

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.160
virulence, are declining because of enhanced activity of the CTL responses, and how do we know that

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.960
activity of the CTL responses? Because the pressure exerted on the virus by those CTLs is not very

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:43.200
unspecific, is not even spike specific, which explains why the new variant GN1 is now having

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.040
mutations that are not only not very unspecific, but not even spike specific anymore. So if you

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.280
take all these things together, very complex analysis, I think I'm having very alarming use,

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.200
it's just coincidence, Steve, that this happens to go inside, I would say, with the show with the

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.600
interview, but the GN1 is very, very alarming because the mutations are no longer restricted

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.280
to spike routine, which indicates enhanced activity of CTLs to diminish viral infectiousness,

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:18.240
and that CTL activity is responsible for the decline of T cells that, in fact, boost the

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:24.880
non-neutralizing antibodies that prevent virulence. So that is what I've been predicting all the time

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.360
that ultimately this evolution would inevitably lead to the emergence of a highly virulent variant

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.080
that would cause waves of hospitalization and severe disease in highly vaccinated countries,

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.280
of course, always the same, only in highly vaccinated countries, right?

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:48.000
So that's a relief. So what you're saying is that you ain't seen nothing yet, and this is just

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.720
act one and prepare for act two, which is going to be more people infected, and so do you believe that

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.000
what's coming up is certainly more infections, but do you predict twice as many deaths, three

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.520
times as many deaths as before? Can you quantify what you think is going to happen?

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.480
I hate to do this, Steve, but I'm...

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.120
That's okay.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:12.480
No, no, no, but I mean, of course, I cannot... It's not because I'm afraid of figures,

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:20.800
just that I'm afraid to say that in my humble opinion, what we will see is something completely

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:29.360
unprecedented in terms of the magnitude of the wave of morbidity and unfortunately mortality

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:36.720
that we will see. But quantify that for me, 10 times, five times, three times, 20 times?

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.240
Yeah, what we have seen right now, well, I mean, I would rather say that in some of

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.080
the highly vaccinated populations, depending, of course, on age and a little bit depending on

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.640
vaccine coverage and on the speed of the vaccination, but I, you know,

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.480
would not be surprised that, you know, we will be dealing with serious

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.720
decimation of the population, in some populations, maybe up to 30, 40 percent.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.520
Okay, so 40 percent of people will die?

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.680
Well, in highly, in certain high, high, high, you know, like in Israel, for example.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.640
Yeah, well, and do you have any information from Israel, Steve? I've been actively searching,

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.400
but I can't find anything, you know, after, let's say, October or something.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.040
But we see that it's a GN1, for example, is now all of a sudden, and you can imagine,

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:33.120
there has been selection pressures on epitopes that condition infectiousness or vital entry

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:39.040
within spike. Okay, so that selection you have, if all of a sudden one of these selected mutants

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.320
happen just by coincidence, happen to have some additional mutations that can enhance

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.520
its infectiousness, and it has not to do with viral entry, you know, it has to do with a higher

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.880
or a more effective production or reproduction rate once the virus is inside the cell so that

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.840
the epitopes that are now mutating are epitopes of the proteins that are contributing to a more

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.680
effective synthesis of the virus. And that will, of course, lead to, or that leads to a higher

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:13.360
viral prediction. But yeah, I haven't seen figures from other countries, but I know that, for example,

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:20.640
this GN1, because it has this exceptional advantage of not only having the mutations linked to spike

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.520
protein that promote infectiousness, but also a bunch of other infection enhancing mutations,

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:32.320
so it's not a surprise that all of a sudden GN1 is almost like replacing and accelerating very,

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.520
very fast in several different countries. I mean, in Spain, in France, in the Netherlands,

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.240
in my country, in Belgium, I know in the US and UK, but probably in most countries. So,

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.040
what's the, I forget what the term for it was a replication factor, you know, like Delta had,

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.840
you know, was reproduction factor, you know, the, like, how does this reproduction factor compare

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.120
with the variants that we've had in the past three times more? Yeah, I haven't seen it for

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:02.800
GN1, but let's say, in general, the reproduction factor or the infectiousness, in fact, because

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:09.680
it's a metric for the infectiousness of the latest of the latest Omicron descendants is between 10

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:15.040
to 100 times higher than for the early Omicron descendants. So the difference between the late

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.840
Omicron descendants of the infectiousness compares to the early Omicron descendants

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.720
is way higher, way higher than the difference in infectiousness between the early Omicron descendants

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.400
and the previous Delta, for example. So that is why people are also saying, I mean, this is,

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.240
this is insane that we still talk about Omicron descendants. It should be completely different

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.320
stereotypes. These viruses are now so incredibly different that, in fact, they are still descendants

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.400
from Omicron, but they are so different in terms of their biological characteristics, especially

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:49.040
the infectiousness. And of course, of course, also their evasion and unification. And it's very

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.200
strange because nobody, obviously, is wondering how it is possible that the neutralization

01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.000
sites of the virus have completely mutated, completely mutated away from the original

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.240
neutralizing structure. And nevertheless, you know, that is what Elgortes are saying,

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:10.880
this, you know, the Sierra, or still, or still neutralizing the virus, is a kind of pseudo-neutralizing

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.080
effect that only occurs at the very, very high concentration. But normally, as soon as the

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.320
concentration goes on a little bit, you have an infection mitigating effect, which is sub-optimal

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.760
and drives immune escape because the pressure is sub-optimal. And that is what explains this.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.880
How many times have, as he introduced a new term, like sub-optimal immune pressure,

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.160
now he's talking over, repeating over and over again, the infection mitigating effect?

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.320
He has introduced more virology, biology terms than anyone else during the pandemic. New ones

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:50.960
applying to the way that viruses squeak out from underneath our immune system or underneath

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:59.840
our imperfect vaccinations. I don't think we need to watch any more of this. I need to kind

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:10.000
of get to bed on time. And I want to stay up on things as it were. I'm not going to do the whole

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.800
shutdown here. I am just going to start with the idea that biology is the way out. In this

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.680
scenario, we should be advocating for a pause on all childhood vaccinations in the USA. We should

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.600
be advocating for strict liability for all pharmaceutical products. And we should be investigating

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:33.520
the mass casualty events of our misconstrued as spread and used to bamboozle the world into

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:40.400
converting to genetic vaccines. We need to get Congress to take us out of the who and disband

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:47.040
our CDC. You can see the meddlers because they don't advocate against childhood vaccination. They

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:55.520
only advocate that there are no viruses. When in reality, the mythology of no viruses is not in

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:02.080
and of itself damaging until you allow it to manifest in the form of a vaccine schedule like

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:08.080
the one that's found in America. If they didn't push anything but silly supplements and vitamins

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.840
with the vaccine with the virus mythologies, it would be no big deal. But with the virus mythologies,

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:23.760
they push vaccines into kids arms and legs. And so if you were really against the idea that

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:31.520
vaccines really on it, that viruses are not real, then you should definitely be also always

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:38.080
saying that therefore vaccines are not needed. That vaccines can't work the way that they are

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:45.200
purported to work. They don't use the word transfection. They don't use the word clone to explain

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:52.000
anything. They can't summarize across the entire pandemic to tell you how it is that this illusion

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:58.240
of viruses was confounded with killing people in American hospitals and in Italian hospitals

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:05.040
and in Italian nursing homes or whatever. They don't spend even a second on it if they are

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:14.080
meddlers. It's always novel virus. That's how you can see them. The more optimistic appraisal

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.400
of this, you know, wanting to get all of our data and take away our children's sovereignty is the

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:28.640
idea that we are at a peak and we can take advantage of this and change the direction of

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.320
the cruise ship to the direction that we wanted to go in rather than the direction that these

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:38.160
controllers wanted to go in. I want to try and remain optimistic about that. I really do.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:44.640
I think it's really important to remain optimistic about that. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.720
please stop all transfection in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.320
any means necessary. Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:00.480
of augmenting the immune system is dumb. Transfection healthy humans is criminally

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.640
knowgigent. Hand viruses are not pattern integrity. I do have something

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.000
little pain or something going on in my throat. I'm not really sure what's going on, but

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.280
I'll take some zinc and I'll be fine. My jaw muscles are tired too. That's weird. Maybe I just

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:26.720
got a drink some water. Let's see if I'm going to show my subscribers again one more time. Is that

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:33.280
happening here? If you want to join the support of Gigome Biological, these are the people who

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:40.640
share my work and more importantly for right now are provide the sort of financial

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:49.360
the financial bonus that keeps this going because in reality it's a lot of time and a lot of effort

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:53.520
and it's a lot of time away from my wife and my family that I devote to making this stream.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.280
And so I am very very thankful that so many people think that it's worthwhile and if you think
