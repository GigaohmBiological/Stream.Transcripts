WEBVTT

00:12.717 --> 00:21.782
Fauci, when he was sitting there, that SOB knew for a fact that that virus came from the Wuhan lab.

00:22.542 --> 00:26.705
He knew that because he had funded the gain-of-function research

00:27.791 --> 00:32.015
in that lab, and he had already begun to design a cover-up.

00:32.515 --> 00:42.984
And we know that from the emails he sent to a group of researchers, academics, trying to get their support to push that come-from-nature theory.

00:43.604 --> 00:47.127
And that's the biggest lie of omission in American history.

00:47.628 --> 00:52.171
Because if he had simply owned up to the fact that that thing

00:53.032 --> 01:08.078
came from the lab, we could have pressured the Chinese to give us the genome sequence, which would have allowed us to design an effective vaccine rather than the crap we wound up getting.

01:08.498 --> 01:14.661
And again, Trump got lied to about that, not just by Fauci, but by Pfizer, the drug company.

01:14.781 --> 01:15.181
In what way?

01:16.308 --> 01:18.389
They didn't disclose the side effects of that.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.451
And they weren't clear with him.

01:20.831 --> 01:25.194
They made him think that it was a true vaccine when it's not.

01:28.056 --> 01:29.857
It's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

01:29.877 --> 01:32.559
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:32.579 --> 01:35.661
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:35.701 --> 01:38.463
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:38.483 --> 01:42.245
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:42.265 --> 01:45.067
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:51.621 --> 01:54.023
Testing 1, 2, test!

01:54.243 --> 01:54.483
Test 1, 2!

01:55.203 --> 01:55.804
Testing!

01:55.964 --> 01:56.904
Test 1, 2!

01:58.465 --> 01:59.346
Test 1, 2!

01:59.846 --> 02:00.226
Testing 1, 2!

02:00.567 --> 02:01.367
Test!

02:02.028 --> 02:02.488
Testing 1, 2!

02:03.348 --> 02:08.532
Yes, the Sarah Away Game full video is a very good video, in case you missed it.

02:09.612 --> 02:16.857
Apparently it's not going to be released because I went wild, or I didn't go wild, or I responded, or I didn't respond.

02:17.874 --> 02:39.173
The bottom line is it fits into the same pattern that Gabe Mason, and Nick Hudson, and Mike Palmer, and Germ Warfare, and CHD, and Bobby's podcast, and Doc Malek's paywalled podcast, and there's just an endless list of times that I have

02:40.177 --> 02:49.008
I have interviewed and had people lose it or not publish it or not publish it until after they published Sasha Latapova's, you know,

02:50.151 --> 02:50.912
Version of it.

02:51.432 --> 02:58.056
It's it's really gross if you see it for what it is Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna try a new thing here.

02:58.757 --> 03:15.548
We have this email that is managed by my my staff And it is giga ohm HQ at proton dot me and I'm gonna suggest that in order to get a notification of exactly when I plan to stream on any given day I

03:16.420 --> 03:29.928
you send a blank email simply with the subject notify me and we will make a list of emails that I will try to email every morning and let you know what I'm planning and where I see I'm going online.

03:29.948 --> 03:40.074
I usually know about an hour ahead of time because by the time I get my slides all ready to go and decide to pull the trigger I'm somewhere between the hour and I like to go on

03:40.914 --> 03:43.075
at these times, generally speaking.

03:44.096 --> 03:46.017
You know, like 12-12 or 11-11.

03:46.077 --> 03:51.360
Today I chose a random time simply because I've been stalling for too long.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.623
I need to pull the trigger so I can get offline and back on the basketball court today.

03:56.223 --> 03:58.405
The voice that you're listening to is Jonathan Cooley.

03:58.445 --> 04:01.987
I come to you live out of the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:02.007 --> 04:03.288
It's the 17th of February, 2025.

04:04.308 --> 04:08.191
If you're listening today, you're probably hearing a live broadcast.

04:08.931 --> 04:13.032
You can look up my previous work as an academic biologist.

04:13.092 --> 04:14.992
Now, I would call that an Akata magician.

04:16.253 --> 04:21.614
My career as an Akata magician has a record on the National Library of Medicine, the PubMed database.

04:22.094 --> 04:31.316
You can use my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, my first initials J and J, which stand for Jonathan J, in case you want to deep Google me.

04:31.756 --> 04:32.916
I'll be back in a few seconds.

04:33.516 --> 04:37.237
John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen

04:37.777 --> 04:41.400
Spinsters and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

04:41.940 --> 04:45.623
The greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe.

04:58.072 --> 05:01.394
scientific questions I think are very hard to get a handle on.

05:01.995 --> 05:12.642
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in, there's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it.

05:12.782 --> 05:20.227
And so, you know, and so the, the and so in this world of extreme hyper specialization where it's narrower and narrower,

05:21.488 --> 05:24.990
subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are.

05:25.411 --> 05:27.792
The string theorists talking about how great string theory is.

05:27.852 --> 05:30.954
The cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer.

05:31.015 --> 05:35.998
The quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum computer that will be a massive breakthrough.

05:36.438 --> 05:41.802
And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening, people just don't have the authority for this.

05:41.822 --> 05:43.163
This is somehow a very different

05:43.743 --> 05:49.625
feel for science or knowledge than you would have had in 1800 or even in 1900.

05:49.725 --> 05:53.286
In 1800, Goethe could still understand just about everything.

05:53.306 --> 05:57.667
1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics.

05:57.707 --> 05:59.148
Those buttons are like breaking.

05:59.348 --> 06:03.829
The sort of specialization I think has made it a much harder

06:17.427 --> 06:26.571
The government fears Alex Jones, who has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.

06:26.631 --> 06:30.012
The deep state hates Alex Jones with a vengeance.

06:30.332 --> 06:32.853
Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.

06:38.061 --> 06:41.962
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

06:43.782 --> 06:44.482
And I have lied.

06:44.503 --> 06:45.543
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:45.563 --> 06:46.483
I don't want to lie.

06:46.983 --> 06:48.323
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

06:48.443 --> 06:49.484
I try not to be a liar.

06:49.504 --> 06:50.344
I don't want to be a liar.

06:50.904 --> 06:53.685
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:55.825 --> 06:59.266
That there is a very real difference between the people

07:01.178 --> 07:06.060
The people who are raised in a world where they trust people, they trust others.

07:06.780 --> 07:16.903
And because they trust others, they have a built-in vulnerability, a built-in deficiency compared to the people who are raised in a world where they don't trust others.

07:17.104 --> 07:21.045
Because when you're raised in a world where you don't trust, you can always learn to trust.

07:21.625 --> 07:27.027
But when you're raised in a world where you trust first, it's very difficult to train that person to know when to not trust someone else.

07:29.104 --> 07:40.069
if you analyze the politics of science, the specializations should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.451
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

07:42.491 --> 07:44.552
And that's sort of my starting.

07:46.212 --> 07:47.173
Sorry, one second.

07:47.213 --> 07:48.493
I got to open up YouTube.

07:48.514 --> 07:51.075
I don't think I actually decided to go live there.

07:51.095 --> 07:55.237
So if I don't do that, I don't think it will actually go live, but maybe it will go live now.

07:56.651 --> 07:58.713
Shabba, I think it should be live now.

07:58.813 --> 07:59.333
Let's see.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.094
Here we go.

08:00.114 --> 08:10.101
I'm gonna see if this works I'm live everywhere else connecting to the stream and let's see if it shows it excellent connection I think we're gonna go live on YouTube as well.

08:10.901 --> 08:12.362
We should be live in a few seconds.

08:12.602 --> 08:15.184
I'm gonna get the stream going again Thank you very much.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.825
Sorry for that mix up there.

08:16.845 --> 08:20.268
I always forget I got a starting bias open that window

08:23.211 --> 08:24.692
Anyway, it says excellent connection.

08:24.732 --> 08:27.915
It should start momentarily on YouTube as well.

08:28.495 --> 08:29.756
I'm just going to keep working here.

08:29.796 --> 08:32.178
Thank you very much for joining me.

08:33.119 --> 08:40.264
And Steven, your immunology professor said very good because the question was very good.

08:40.684 --> 08:48.831
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic.

08:48.951 --> 08:51.753
There was no pandemic and there will be no pandemic.

08:52.473 --> 08:59.636
And it's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic, it can't.

09:00.256 --> 09:08.679
And there's... I'm not sure exactly who he is.

09:08.759 --> 09:14.060
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

09:14.921 --> 09:21.663
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

09:24.872 --> 09:45.244
Let me introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

09:45.264 --> 09:49.727
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

09:50.356 --> 09:54.843
a panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment.

10:31.973 --> 10:37.977
How's that for a contrast?

10:39.058 --> 10:40.259
Welcome to the show, everybody.

10:40.819 --> 10:41.700
Thanks for joining me.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.002
I am gonna play us in with a song, so you're gonna have to wait for a little while yet.

10:56.869 --> 10:58.110
I don't care how you get there.

10:58.130 --> 11:00.792
I don't care what you do to get there.

11:02.830 --> 11:23.803
goals to what it's not really going live on YouTube so I'm gonna close that don't try to go to YouTube I'll just forget it this time I have to open it before I start the stream which is a little annoying but you know whatever I don't I don't really care I put up

11:24.753 --> 11:30.898
I put up the stream with Sarah Westall there, so I think it's actually really good right now.

11:30.918 --> 11:32.178
I'm just going to leave it like that.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.862
Let me see if I'm again working this thing right here.

11:37.182 --> 11:38.303
Thanks very much for joining me.

11:38.323 --> 11:43.207
I'm going to play in, like I said, because I think it's sometimes fun to start with music.

11:43.247 --> 11:44.087
It gets me warmed up.

12:28.584 --> 12:43.321
I think we're working on a slow change It may pull us apart When I'm not getting into your heart, baby Don't you forget about me

12:58.831 --> 13:17.383
Look my way, you'll never love me Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling Down, down, down Will you recognize me?

13:17.963 --> 13:21.426
Call my name or walk on by

13:36.648 --> 13:37.211
Hello!

14:06.018 --> 14:09.240
Don't you forget about me.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.982
I'll be alone down to New York, baby.

14:14.543 --> 14:17.884
Going to take you apart.

14:18.685 --> 14:21.827
I'll put us back together at heart, baby.

14:23.147 --> 14:26.989
Don't you forget about me.

14:29.150 --> 14:35.474
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't you forget about me.

14:43.968 --> 14:44.169
I love you.

15:57.875 --> 15:58.539
Welcome back!

16:33.936 --> 16:35.576
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

16:37.617 --> 16:42.718
I don't know why I really like this little Harold Faltemeyer jam.

16:44.238 --> 16:48.620
United noncompliance means something very different to very, very many people here.

16:49.780 --> 17:02.703
To a lot of people in the health freedom movement, it just means freedom of speech, freedom of choice, but united noncompliance means really not participating in their mythologies and their illusions and their rituals.

17:03.686 --> 17:05.308
The truth is out there, ladies and gentlemen.

17:05.328 --> 17:13.236
I think we're finally getting close to it now as we realize that it's our own parents that bequeathed us this

17:15.293 --> 17:27.499
band of charlatans and, you know, we're going to have to hold our doctors to account because it was them who participated in sustaining the illusion and the people that learn the biology are the ones who can show them.

17:28.740 --> 17:38.365
Unfortunately, you know, there's very few out there, but GigaOM Biological, Housatonic IGS, Housatonic Live,

17:41.021 --> 17:46.262
the liberty perspective and maybe deprogramming with Grace's dad.

17:47.543 --> 17:54.505
If we're going to take the power back from these charlatans that we've inherited from our parents, this is the last chance we're going to have to do it.

17:54.545 --> 17:57.986
It's our generation and our kids that are going to have to learn the truth.

17:59.056 --> 18:00.977
and not pass it on to their kids.

18:01.057 --> 18:03.037
Our grandkids are the goal.

18:03.057 --> 18:05.558
We have to save our grandkids.

18:06.738 --> 18:08.099
That's the hope that I have.

18:08.139 --> 18:14.561
The goal is to teach my children how to teach this stuff, how to speak this language and not speak

18:15.120 --> 18:17.381
the slave speak that we are being given.

18:18.541 --> 18:21.121
It's gonna be hard for people to avoid GigaOM this year.

18:22.342 --> 18:28.783
A lot of people tried to pretend that they had avoided me for five years, but the truth is going to come out now, ladies and gentlemen, I assure you.

18:28.823 --> 18:31.824
The truth is definitely going to come out right now.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.584
I'm really excited about it.

18:36.585 --> 18:37.265
Hey, what is that?

18:37.886 --> 18:38.726
Why did that start?

18:39.046 --> 18:39.546
That's weird.

18:40.706 --> 18:41.387
Isn't that funny?

18:41.768 --> 18:42.649
Why is that there?

18:43.351 --> 18:44.212
Holy cow!

18:44.653 --> 18:51.885
It's like a whole wrong song in the wrong spot where the this should be there and they even had the same number.

18:51.985 --> 18:52.606
Wow, that's weird.

18:53.067 --> 18:53.588
Okay, here we go.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.243
Anyway, it's going to be hard for people to avoid us.

19:00.384 --> 19:05.749
No matter what way you choose, you're going to have to eventually admit that intramuscular injection is dumb.

19:05.789 --> 19:17.778
You're going to have to admit that transfection is what they called it before the pandemic, and they could have called it at the beginning of the pandemic, and that would have been a hell of a lot closer to informed consent than whatever these people are arguing for now.

19:18.239 --> 19:21.982
And of course, the big biologists out there are going to have to realize

19:22.802 --> 19:24.403
that RNA cannot pandemic.

19:24.423 --> 19:25.643
They're going to have to think about it.

19:25.683 --> 19:32.365
They're going to have to imbibe that thought because all of those three then would help them realize that the U.S.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.066
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

19:35.586 --> 19:39.647
And I want to be very clear about that because I don't think anyone else is saying it.

19:39.707 --> 19:42.348
Not anyone else alive anyway.

19:42.428 --> 19:43.509
Maybe Mark is saying it.

19:45.009 --> 19:50.492
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

19:51.593 --> 20:00.078
That biologist is Jonathan Cooey, and I'm very, very pleased to be here again with another show.

20:00.098 --> 20:03.000
I am going to have to take about 15 minutes of your time.

20:04.260 --> 20:18.826
To summarize where we are because I think every day that we do this show we're gonna need to have a lead in just in case There's a new person on the internet listening for the first time I do regret this not being on YouTube, but that's okay.

20:19.246 --> 20:20.667
We'll put the rest of these on YouTube

20:21.187 --> 20:30.992
And again, I recently added the Sarah Westfall interview in its entirety, right from the start where she's denying that she's in a deep state.

20:31.052 --> 20:32.773
I don't know why she's saying that.

20:33.693 --> 20:36.095
When I hit the record button all the way until the very end.

20:37.415 --> 20:39.037
So anyway, that's where we are.

20:39.757 --> 20:53.066
We have a group of coordinated liars and they do lots of weird things like, you know, they might interview me and then also not put up the interview for like three weeks because they have to edit it.

20:53.126 --> 21:00.371
In the meantime, I guess they have table meetings about the content of the interview and whether or not the interviewee asked the right questions or not.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.374
And then they try to absorb some of these messages.

21:03.414 --> 21:04.715
I've seen Nick Hudson do it.

21:04.735 --> 21:06.837
I've seen Sasha Latipova do it.

21:06.877 --> 21:07.858
I've seen all of them do it.

21:09.209 --> 21:20.431
And it's interesting because I found another sort of person who's not alive and with us anymore, who was also in this movement, who seems to have experienced a very similar phenomenon.

21:21.072 --> 21:31.774
And so today I wanted to discuss that and, you know, kind of start with the sort of idea that Giggle and Biological has a message that is really

21:33.832 --> 21:35.573
It is not for everyone.

21:35.593 --> 21:39.735
It is a message of hope, but it is not a message of hope for everyone.

21:40.896 --> 21:45.078
However, I do think that it is a message that is accessible to anyone.

21:45.979 --> 21:58.086
I don't think that the ideas and the concepts that we're trying to discuss and the foundational ideas that edify them are out of the reach of anyone that wants to understand them.

21:58.726 --> 22:00.867
But not everybody will want to understand them.

22:00.907 --> 22:03.209
Not everybody is ready to hear it.

22:04.969 --> 22:15.859
And so to steal my friend Greg's little slogan or sales pitch there, GigaOM is a message of hope that is not for everyone, but it is for anyone.

22:15.959 --> 22:21.484
And I'm very happy to be bringing you this message of hope, which starts basically

22:22.912 --> 22:25.414
I don't know why the video game is so loud.

22:25.454 --> 22:26.134
I apologize.

22:26.454 --> 22:27.895
The kids must have been playing it earlier.

22:29.116 --> 22:34.240
This message of hope starts with the idea that this is for all the marbles.

22:34.300 --> 22:38.623
And the reason why I use that phrase is because I want you to understand that

22:39.563 --> 22:42.266
They're really playing a multi-generational game here.

22:42.306 --> 22:47.751
They're playing for the governance of the globe, the governance of humanity, the future of humanity.

22:48.272 --> 22:56.600
And in their imagination, they're even playing for the power to govern the evolutionary direction of the human race.

22:57.581 --> 23:02.226
And so when I say this is all about the grandchildren of Earth, I really do mean that.

23:03.919 --> 23:13.661
And I think I'm getting closer to kind of knowing what it is that I want to do as far as the book or one of the books that I think needs to be written.

23:13.681 --> 23:27.445
I just really feel as though if you start trying to put your head around this, especially if you're here for the first time, around the idea of how would multi-generational wealth behave?

23:29.190 --> 23:31.812
in the event that they were playing for all the marbles.

23:31.912 --> 23:40.338
Of course, it's simple to see that they would be willing to lie and cheat from a business perspective, from a banking perspective.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.581
But what about a narrative perspective?

23:43.621 --> 23:45.702
What about a scientific perspective?

23:45.762 --> 23:49.465
What about what the average Joe knows perspective?

23:50.421 --> 24:07.326
Because I think that's where you start to get a grasp of what it means when Alex Karp says that he went to Germany and did a useless philosophy degree trying to understand how people know things or how people participate in democracy.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.465
because essentially they're all talking about the same thing.

24:11.485 --> 24:19.678
They're all talking about what Edward Bernays talks about and what Noam Chomsky talks about in those quotes that I use at the beginning of the stream.

24:19.999 --> 24:22.103
Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.040
So here's where we are, right?

24:26.240 --> 24:27.301
This is reality.

24:27.361 --> 24:28.882
This is only a couple days ago.

24:29.002 --> 24:38.628
My former boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the author of this book, The Wuhan Cover-Up and the Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race, is now the head of

24:40.151 --> 24:42.512
Health and Human Services, so let's just listen for a second.

24:42.792 --> 24:51.998
I want to begin by thanking President Trump for giving me this extraordinary opportunity, and I want to introduce my family and thank them for being here.

24:52.018 --> 25:03.144
My wife Cheryl, my cousin Anthony Shriver, my daughter Kik, my other daughter Kira, Carolina, Carolina Shriver.

25:04.110 --> 25:07.453
Joey Shriver, Jackson Hines, and Amaryllis Kennedy.

25:08.814 --> 25:16.440
And I want to thank all of you for your support throughout this whole two and a half year journey.

25:21.004 --> 25:23.025
My first time in this whole office was in 1962.

25:23.206 --> 25:27.889
As far as I can tell, it's two mono channels in different years, so it's weird.

25:27.929 --> 25:28.350
But anyway.

25:30.687 --> 25:37.271
I came here and I had a meeting with my uncle, who was president then, where we talked about the environment.

25:38.112 --> 25:44.216
He was involved deeply, as we all know, in restoring physical fitness in this country.

25:44.236 --> 25:55.763
He challenged, at one point during his administration, he challenged Americans to do a 50-mile walk, which I ultimately did, but I remember the day that my father

25:56.949 --> 26:06.703
There's a hundred K walk in the Netherlands they do every year that's also like a war memorial walk I

26:10.137 --> 26:13.478
towpaths with his feet bleeding and blisters on them.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.541
My father, one of his best friends was Al Owenstein.

26:18.561 --> 26:24.203
And Al Owenstein ultimately was a congressman from New York who was assassinated himself in 1980.

26:24.543 --> 26:32.327
But Al Owenstein had started the Dump Johnson movement to get rid of President Johnson and end the Vietnam War.

26:32.367 --> 26:36.869
And at the time that he started it, people just thought it was a fool's errand.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.550
And ultimately, he asked my father to run.

26:40.860 --> 26:47.742
against Johnson, my father wouldn't do it at that time, and he asked Gene McCarthy, McCarthy did it, and he joined that campaign.

26:48.682 --> 26:52.303
And my father ultimately ran, and Johnson then dropped out.

26:52.683 --> 26:54.643
So Al Owenstein had succeeded.

26:54.663 --> 27:06.726
And although Al Owenstein was on the other side now, running against my father with Gene McCarthy, my father wrote a note, a quote from Emerson, where he said, if a single man

27:07.722 --> 27:14.668
plant himself firmly on his own ideal, and thereby, a whole wide world will come around to him.

27:15.589 --> 27:27.759
For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.941
On August 23rd of last year,

27:33.208 --> 27:36.269
God sent me President Trump, all right.

27:36.289 --> 27:37.290
And he gave me.

27:43.892 --> 27:47.493
He's now given me, he's kept every promise that he's made to me.

27:48.554 --> 27:51.895
He's kept his word in every account and gone way beyond it.

27:52.795 --> 27:54.776
I'm so grateful to you, Mr. President.

27:55.076 --> 27:58.237
A lot of people told me that I couldn't trust President Trump.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.578
I better get it in writing.

28:00.669 --> 28:05.331
And we did a handshake, and everything that he told me he was going to do, he has done.

28:06.632 --> 28:08.713
And I'm so grateful to him.

28:08.793 --> 28:15.136
And I've told you before, I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure.

28:16.116 --> 28:25.640
And you are going to transform this country at a time when we see all of the indicia of democracy now.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.181
Nice, Mark.

28:26.301 --> 28:27.041
That's perfect.

28:27.061 --> 28:27.141
Wow.

28:29.645 --> 28:36.087
Mark in the chat says, did he specifically ask for Trump or does God have a sense of humor?

28:36.127 --> 28:37.408
Boy, that's for sure.

28:40.509 --> 28:47.472
Totalitarianism, these attacks on our constitution and this breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people.

28:48.092 --> 28:52.694
President Trump has promised to restore the American dream in this country.

28:53.594 --> 28:55.715
A healthy person has a thousand dreams.

28:56.471 --> 28:57.952
A sick person only has one.

28:57.972 --> 29:03.197
60% of our population has only one dream, that they get better.

29:04.378 --> 29:07.440
President Trump has promised that he's going to restore America's strength.

29:08.641 --> 29:12.644
But we can't be a strong nation if we have a weak citizenry.

29:13.625 --> 29:17.768
If people are sick, 60% of our people are sick.

29:18.169 --> 29:23.153
77%, as President Trump mentioned, our children cannot qualify for military service.

29:24.322 --> 29:27.084
And we need a man on a white horse now.

29:27.884 --> 29:45.133
We need somebody who is willing to come in and has the spine and the guts and the strength to challenge orthodoxies, to stand in the way of vested interests, and to break institutions that have turned against our democracy.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.676
President Trump has shown again and again that he is that hero.

29:50.816 --> 29:58.543
And most recently, I greatly appreciate it, and I called you the day that you announced the termination of USAID.

29:59.183 --> 30:07.490
My uncle started USAID in 1961 for humanitarian purposes, to put our country on the side of the poor.

30:08.351 --> 30:10.993
It has been captured by the military-industrial complex.

30:11.813 --> 30:15.797
It has become a sinister propagator of totalitarianism and war.

30:17.838 --> 30:18.718
across the globe.

30:18.978 --> 30:24.399
And very few people understand how sinister this agency really is.

30:24.419 --> 30:29.120
And President Trump saw that, and he stood up to it with a master stroke.

30:30.080 --> 30:36.221
And we want to do the same thing with the institutions that are stealing the health of our children.

30:37.162 --> 30:40.282
We need a revolutionary figure, and you are that figure.

30:40.462 --> 30:43.283
And I'm very grateful for you for giving me this opportunity.

30:47.247 --> 30:50.573
It's an amazing place.

30:51.635 --> 30:53.179
We are in an amazing place right now.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.643
It's a long, strange trip that brought us here.

30:57.810 --> 31:02.454
You know, it's taken me a long time to awaken to the idea that I'm never going to be on their team.

31:03.775 --> 31:09.460
I'm just made to feel like it, like they make everybody feel like they're on the team, but you're not really on the team.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.361
You don't have any say in the message.

31:11.381 --> 31:15.104
You're not going to make anybody change their mind or learn something that you know.

31:16.645 --> 31:21.469
And I spent many, many years trying to be a part of this team in some way.

31:22.350 --> 31:26.152
to try and bring them to understand what I thought I had to offer as a message.

31:26.232 --> 31:32.095
And it is really extraordinary what the truth seems to be to me right now.

31:32.115 --> 31:34.756
I do think it's quite simple.

31:34.856 --> 31:39.559
I do think that a very hot background of DNA and RNA that surrounds us and bathes us

31:40.799 --> 31:48.607
was used disingenuously to represent the spread of a novel pathogen to tell us a story about something that RNA cannot do.

31:49.207 --> 31:54.252
And the way they did it is with nonspecific PCR tests that may or may not still be in use.

31:55.232 --> 32:01.118
The most important thing to understand is that the tests that were used in 2020 and 2021 are not on the market anymore.

32:01.698 --> 32:05.642
And those are the tests that defined the pandemic because that's when the murder occurred.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.487
And so placebos made the rollout of transfections safe.

32:12.527 --> 32:14.711
There were never any investigational vaccines.

32:14.751 --> 32:18.017
There were only transfections in the form of an adenovirus carrier.

32:18.894 --> 32:20.515
or a lipid nanoparticle carrier.

32:20.555 --> 32:44.264
And that's why a lot of the people that are involved in this have the requisite track record to know exactly what that term means, how it applied to both instances of the methodology, and how easily you could have sort of allowed people to engage informed consent by just telling them what this was, how it's been used in previous ways, including on the academic bench and all of our

32:45.024 --> 32:55.286
In all of our universities around the West, I mean America and Europe and in Japan and these places where they have the first world level of laboratory.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.683
They've been doing it for years.

32:57.763 --> 33:17.620
And so using their tests, the PCR and the lateral flow, many of which were produced in China to find their ghosts, those being the RNA viruses circulating the pandemic or circulating the globe and pandemicking around the world, do not make their ghosts real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

33:17.660 --> 33:22.664
And yet for many years, I, like everyone else on earth, thought that that was the case.

33:24.332 --> 33:35.025
And the reason why it was so easy to believe it is because they put a bunch of people on social media with the necessary script to make it seem like there was already a consensus about things.

33:35.906 --> 33:40.292
That there was already a consensus among experts that the PCR represented something.

33:41.368 --> 33:45.289
even if it was a not very clear signal, it represented something.

33:45.649 --> 33:49.391
A consensus among experts that asymptomatic spread is a real thing.

33:49.811 --> 33:54.292
A consensus among experts that endemicity is a thing we would want to avoid.

33:57.573 --> 34:02.775
And so they got people on social media, they put people in academia to make sure that we believed this.

34:03.995 --> 34:08.477
And what this was, was a novel virus that explained away murder.

34:09.594 --> 34:12.855
allowed murder to occur or manslaughter to occur.

34:14.955 --> 34:20.116
And PCR not being a not useful diagnostic tool is just one aspect of this.

34:20.176 --> 34:25.457
Another aspect of it in America was that pure oxygen causes acute respiratory distress syndrome.

34:25.477 --> 34:38.020
And so the willy nilly administration of pure oxygen at say 60 liters a minute as advised by Kyle Seidel of at the time a hospital in New York,

34:40.560 --> 34:45.851
you would induce the exact same symptoms that would be associated with this virus.

34:45.911 --> 34:47.895
And yet only in a hospital did this occur.

34:48.905 --> 34:58.053
And it explains so much of the lack of spread and the occurrence of death in the hospital that Denny Rancourt was so keen to observe in May 2020.

34:59.415 --> 35:08.663
So not using antibiotics to treat pneumonia or not using antibiotics to treat a urinary tract infection because it's a viral syndrome is murder.

35:09.324 --> 35:12.567
And doctors who believed that nonsense, it's murder.

35:14.707 --> 35:21.052
And they need to feel the guilt of that so that they understand how bad it is, that they were part of it.

35:21.132 --> 35:23.314
Witting or unwitting, they went along with it.

35:23.354 --> 35:26.136
They didn't stand up when they should have stood up.

35:26.677 --> 35:28.999
A light bulb didn't go on when it could have gone on.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.020
And maybe you don't have your parents anymore.

35:31.761 --> 35:33.302
Maybe you don't have your aunt anymore.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.484
Maybe you lost a kid and you don't know why.

35:35.504 --> 35:36.645
This is why.

35:43.928 --> 35:57.094
And so in the end, one of the things that I think is most important for everybody to see is that a remnant stream of testing samples has been created or was created and existed for at least three years during the pandemic 2020, 21, 22, where many now defunct and gone companies

36:04.605 --> 36:15.368
did track and trace and testing and used, you know, proprietary tests and proprietary diagnostics to do it, made millions or even billions of dollars doing it.

36:16.368 --> 36:21.109
Much of that money came out of warp speed, just spraying like a fire hose.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.350
And those are all gone.

36:25.550 --> 36:31.812
None of the people that are in front of us right now ever usefully questioned that waste of money and how

36:32.978 --> 36:40.009
important it was to edify the idea of the presence of a novel virus, again, which none of these people will deny exists.

36:43.976 --> 36:49.878
And so again, I am making statements that I think are important for my grandkids to know.

36:50.598 --> 36:56.980
There was a team that was put in place that I am now calling, or have been for quite some time, calling Team Worst Case Scenario.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.581
Some people are part of the team and know it and were there from the beginning.

37:01.741 --> 37:06.723
Other people were absorbed as they spoke out and then were limitedly briefed into what the team does.

37:07.763 --> 37:08.784
They got book deals.

37:08.844 --> 37:10.404
They got lucrative sub stacks.

37:10.444 --> 37:35.535
They got world travel and they got fame from it I mean a lot of these people There's just no other way to explain why Harvey Reich is in so many of these groups and so many of these photos there's no reason to explain why someone with the track record of Jessica Rose suddenly rose to such prominence with regard to you know, the the sort of the I don't know if you want to call it control of or monitoring of people like

37:37.065 --> 37:41.452
Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey did the same thing with Paul Merrick.

37:42.434 --> 37:49.165
And so the web is pretty complicated, but you still just have to see that these multigenerational

37:51.149 --> 38:19.351
Weaponized piles of money are thinking on Multi-generational time horizons and that means that when they manipulate the habits and opinions of the masses They're manipulating the habits of the opinions of the masses for them not to see and think on those whoops on those time horizons Let me just briefly do this here to make sure that this is all queued up correctly because sometimes I like to have the small one Sorry about that

38:25.639 --> 38:49.174
And so it is really crucial to see this and what they might do and the fact that we've been told many times in different ways how to understand it and what specifically that Noam Chomsky said that social media enables so malevolently is this very lively debate within a limited spectrum.

38:50.438 --> 39:01.267
Because the lively debate on places like Facebook and Twitter and Telegram and Signal can be curated by an illusion of consensus that could be created by one person.

39:01.327 --> 39:06.972
Imagine that I invite you to join my Signal chat about Bitcoin.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.676
And you don't understand that I have 10 phones on my desk.

39:13.237 --> 39:18.781
And each one of those phones has an instance of Signal with a different account on it, with a different Gmail address.

39:19.676 --> 39:34.129
And so I have this Signal chat with 10 of my friends who are doctors and lawyers and all these smart people who will all engage with you individually on Signal as well as in my Bitcoin chat.

39:35.871 --> 39:47.763
And so think about how easily I could manipulate you if I just went over and picked up the phone of Richard and then texted you privately and said, hey, I see that you're in Jonathan's Bitcoin chat.

39:48.264 --> 39:49.345
I really like your work.

39:50.065 --> 39:53.509
Maybe you could come on my stream and talk about it a little bit.

39:55.290 --> 40:03.416
And now I've created this illusion where you're in this group with like 10 other people who aren't real people and one of those real people wants to interview you.

40:03.936 --> 40:12.283
But then, you know, maybe he doesn't or hasn't had time or disappears or gets out of the group or has a fight with another person in the group and wastes a lot of your time.

40:13.764 --> 40:16.326
And it's just me and my 10 phones.

40:17.298 --> 40:31.413
who's been hired to mess with you as long as possible and to get as much information as I can out of you as possible and give all the text messages from all those 10 phones are always tapped into another place where these people sit around and listen to it.

40:32.594 --> 40:39.041
I assure you the scams that are being run right now are much more complicated than that.

40:40.686 --> 40:45.229
and involve many more real people with staff that does that for their accounts.

40:46.030 --> 40:47.911
Because that's how this works.

40:48.011 --> 40:49.892
It is a military operation.

40:50.773 --> 40:57.637
Those pictures with all these people behind phones or behind computers doing it is not an illusion.

40:57.697 --> 40:58.378
That's real.

40:59.599 --> 41:01.920
Because we are talking about all the marbles.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.664
We are talking about creating a mythology that our children will grow up believing.

41:08.303 --> 41:13.647
And the way that they created it was engaging in this mystery of the Wuhan cover-up.

41:14.047 --> 41:16.669
And it doesn't really matter how you rearrange the players.

41:18.051 --> 41:24.355
They created an illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate, and all of these people played their part.

41:24.816 --> 41:34.103
They're all little, tiny, compartmentalized groups of people that agree on specific aspects of it, but no matter which way you cut the cake,

41:35.370 --> 41:42.463
There's no explanation for why any of these people haven't come to the realization that intramuscular injection in general is dumb as medicine.

41:43.188 --> 41:47.552
They haven't come to the conclusion that this was always transfection before the pandemic.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.554
We've used it a lot on the academic bench.

41:50.095 --> 41:51.937
We know exactly how limited it is.

41:52.477 --> 41:55.300
It's absurd to call it an investigational vaccine.

41:55.440 --> 42:07.372
And it is very hard for me to believe how there are so few academic biologists who haven't stopped to think about the words, RNA cannot pandemic and had an epiphany.

42:09.226 --> 42:28.039
Because so many of those academic biologists have stood in front of a chalkboard during an oral exam and been challenged to describe as many parts of this, the pathway from DNA to a functional protein as you can possibly identify to, you know, just show us what you know.

42:30.154 --> 42:41.316
And so all of these people in that exercise, if they were told that, Oh, but if you make a special version of this, it can go from a mud puddle to endemicity, and it'll be there forever.

42:41.916 --> 42:46.617
It would be a very apparent immediately why that how absurd that is.

42:49.938 --> 42:59.720
And then adults that are ready adults that are willing to jump this far and willing to jump out of the airplane will come to the conclusion that the

43:01.045 --> 43:26.364
only explanation for why the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, Acolyte and Apprentice of Mark Lander and Francis Collins, is actively working against me and my family for the last five years on the internet, calling my ideas chemtrail retarded, or calling me Barricks B-I-T-C-H.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.091
bringing more gain of function to our homes, he says.

43:32.526 --> 43:38.530
and lying about a book that I got paid to help write and the evidence is in the book, in the acknowledgements page.

43:38.990 --> 43:44.653
The people who know the work that I did and the work that Rixie didn't do are also on the acknowledgements page.

43:45.093 --> 43:51.257
These are real live people that any journalist could contact and verify that my story is true.

43:51.657 --> 43:59.902
That this guy went on a very big podcast and lied repeatedly about the role of a shoe salesman in the writing of this book.

44:01.280 --> 44:09.645
It's so bizarre that those same people just, you know, there's must be lots of people who are opposed to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:09.685 --> 44:26.454
being Health and Human Services Secretary and are opposed to any touching of the vaccine schedule and are opposed to, but then they realize that, wait, I can't use Jonathan Cooley because Jonathan Cooley says it even worse than all of these people.

44:27.691 --> 44:36.047
The only person who says it better than me or earlier than me, I think, is really Brandy Vaughn with an A-N.

44:39.813 --> 44:41.295
And so yeah, I don't know what to say.

44:41.355 --> 44:43.937
I think that social media has allowed this to happen.

44:43.977 --> 44:57.832
And if we don't get our kids off of social media, don't pull our own heads out of social media and start to build a federated, independent, similar thing ourselves, we are in deep trouble.

45:00.614 --> 45:04.598
And again, this is not a message for everyone, but the truth is out there.

45:04.778 --> 45:17.708
And these myths about novel viruses and novel cures for novel viruses are myths that are perpetrated by traitors to hide the murder that was used or employed to create this illusion.

45:17.768 --> 45:25.254
So we knew that all-cause mortality was going to go up because we had big families for a little while after World War II.

45:26.776 --> 45:28.677
those big families had big families.

45:28.737 --> 45:47.043
And so there's two bumps that are going to come from this prosperity after World War II, and it will come in the form of a lot of people dying, a lot of people retiring, and a burden on the health care systems of the Western nations that have this funny-shaped

45:48.463 --> 45:49.503
population pyramid.

45:49.543 --> 45:57.145
And so, in order to hide the necessity to manage that problem, these people have participated in a theater.

45:58.806 --> 46:08.588
In a theater that was also designed to increase the relevance of, increase the political power of, and the political capital of the people that own social media platforms.

46:10.916 --> 46:12.757
And that's what we're sort of seeing here.

46:12.777 --> 46:18.041
There is a vying of power between the people that run social media platforms and the traditional media.

46:18.061 --> 46:18.802
Of course there is.

46:19.502 --> 46:23.725
These people have decades of investment in those things.

46:23.785 --> 46:37.475
And so the usurping of that power to a certain extent, to an internet form, to a podcasting form, to a Steve Bannon network form, there's going to be some resistance there, especially if red or blue team has more or one or the other.

46:38.476 --> 46:39.256
And that's what you see.

46:40.259 --> 46:54.573
And that absolute ridiculous theater covers up some of the essential biological truths that edify the idea of a pandemic or dismiss it, depending on what side you're on, and also that none of these people will touch.

46:54.613 --> 46:58.397
So the limitations of the Human Genome Project, intramuscular injection in general,

46:59.097 --> 47:00.318
PCR is a fraud.

47:00.738 --> 47:05.239
Sequencing and metagenomic sequencing in the background is something that can be done in virology.

47:05.299 --> 47:06.860
Endemicity is a phenomenon.

47:07.340 --> 47:10.561
Supplemental oxygen and what it does and how long we've known that.

47:11.642 --> 47:15.963
Why they would use placebos and why no one of these pharma people has ever said that.

47:16.743 --> 47:26.387
And then defining transfection has now taken this bifurcation of either you still claim that you didn't know the word or you say that that's just an old word and big deal.

47:27.493 --> 47:37.356
And both of these things are obviously malevolent, disingenuous lies that are again perpetrated by these traitors who are selling out our grandkids to the slavers.

47:38.336 --> 47:52.980
Speaking this slave speak that also talking about how bad the COVID shots are, but not talking about the murder, essentially is sort of distorting time for our children so that they forget that there were adults who could have said no

47:55.165 --> 47:57.727
who could have said no to the masks in band.

47:58.747 --> 48:03.570
You know, these masks that the kids had to wear in band.

48:03.991 --> 48:06.852
Adults could have said no to this for almost two years.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.674
We could have said no to the closing of schools.

48:09.714 --> 48:17.379
We could have said no to the mandatory testing at universities and just told our kids to stay home for a year and work at Chick-fil-A and shoot buckets.

48:19.946 --> 48:34.796
So one of the things that happens when they distort this calendar for us is that we forget how long all of us adults had the responsibility and abdicated it to the TV, abdicated it to the scrolling answers on our phone.

48:35.296 --> 48:44.823
Instead of taking responsibility for understanding what's really going on and taking responsibility for protecting our children from these people, we submit it.

48:46.897 --> 48:53.859
And now these people who are in front of us and leading this false charge to health freedom want us to forget.

48:55.479 --> 49:00.320
Because they were part of the reason why we were lost here.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.801
Why so few of us found the principles.

49:05.321 --> 49:14.683
And those of us who had the principles were stood in front of by these people and their artificial elevation on social media.

49:16.058 --> 49:21.008
So it is really myths perpetrated by traitors that hide these lies, murder with lies.

49:21.068 --> 49:21.750
That's what it is.

49:21.830 --> 49:22.271
That's it.

49:23.032 --> 49:23.994
It's it in a nutshell.

49:25.034 --> 49:26.475
And they've known this for a while.

49:26.556 --> 49:30.940
How long has the population growth of America been going down?

49:30.980 --> 49:34.223
And how inaccurate is that population pyramid that I just showed you?

49:34.724 --> 49:37.366
How narrow is the bottom of the pyramid actually?

49:37.767 --> 49:45.294
Because when you look at these population pyramids in Europe, you don't see this great big fat population pyramid that I just showed you.

49:45.334 --> 49:48.858
You see these really narrow ones, which are terrifying.

49:53.772 --> 50:01.957
Now, again, it's only in the last few weeks that I've really come around to saying that, you know, I don't, I'm pretty pessimistic now.

50:01.977 --> 50:17.407
I think that all of these organizations are essentially sabotaged, if not from the very beginning, like Heart and Panda from their very establishment, but others of them were sabotaged very quickly as needed.

50:19.488 --> 50:24.912
I think you can see who these people are by looking at their timelines.

50:25.012 --> 50:40.525
And so I have and I will continue to work diligently to build as meticulous of a timeline of every one of these people and to archive every video and every text message and every signal chat message that I've gotten from them in that time.

50:41.886 --> 51:08.800
Timeline so that you can see exactly how malevolent they are Nothing is more rewarding than making a new timeline for a new one of these meddlers because it is it's just extraordinary what you find And that's I think more and more becoming very obvious the way forward is to just hold these people to account to try and make the record of their work as detailed as possible because I personally and I think Bart Kulak

51:10.221 --> 51:19.032
Joe Marshall, Scott Shara, we don't really have to worry about people, you know, checking our work or what were you doing in 2020?

51:19.372 --> 51:26.561
You didn't know because we, when we made mistakes, we've admitted it and we've admitted that in 2020 we were lost as everyone.

51:28.339 --> 51:34.103
What's more important is that we've admitted that we think we were taken by certain people and have named those names.

51:35.304 --> 51:41.868
And I think that makes us an especially small group of people that's willing to say that.

51:41.908 --> 51:48.993
Whereas most of these other people that have been following this script or like Kevin McCarron basically riding the bench waiting for

51:49.733 --> 51:54.555
the chance to get in the game are really, they've run out.

51:54.735 --> 51:55.736
They've run out of time.

51:55.816 --> 51:56.897
They've run out of narrative.

51:56.917 --> 52:02.019
I think a lot of these people are running out of staying power because they don't have the endurance.

52:02.739 --> 52:07.922
They don't have the endurance because they've never had the belief that what they're doing is right.

52:08.722 --> 52:11.584
But I assure you that nobody is in this narrative by chance.

52:12.764 --> 52:17.086
And many people were put in place in different ways.

52:17.146 --> 52:19.407
Maybe were even intended to play different roles.

52:19.967 --> 52:25.510
But as the pandemic went further and further off script, and they missed their mark.

52:26.650 --> 52:31.092
And their mark was, of course, to get the vast majority of Americans to take at least a couple shots.

52:33.473 --> 52:40.136
They had to, you know, do what they've done here, which is really make fools of themselves.

52:41.175 --> 53:00.563
So we've also been looking at Brandy Vaughn, who Mark Kulak of Housatonic Live has diligently started to build a page for, and in so doing figured out that so many of these people that have tried to memorialize her, including CHD, managed to spell her name wrong.

53:00.603 --> 53:03.224
And I don't know, maybe that's why I was spelling her name wrong.

53:03.724 --> 53:06.386
in the last couple streams, but I fixed it here.

53:07.127 --> 53:18.054
She formed the group LearnTheRisk.org in 2015 after about four years of researching vaccines and after being a whistleblower at a pharmaceutical company.

53:19.395 --> 53:22.638
And that's very interesting because she does not have a damaged kid.

53:22.678 --> 53:26.020
She was not woken up because her kid became damaged.

53:26.060 --> 53:26.941
That makes her different.

53:26.981 --> 53:28.662
It makes her like me, actually.

53:30.865 --> 53:37.227
And so I think it's something very curious that you're going to see play in here.

53:37.247 --> 53:55.531
In that same year in October is when Mary Holland entered the scene as a college professor, a law professor at Columbia University, who was speaking out because her son was injured by a component of the MMR vaccine, a very specific cord

53:56.911 --> 54:12.576
that harmonizes very well with the amazing Polly Tommy story in the UK and Wakefield's story, Andrew Wakefield's story in the UK, which is also kids injured by a component of the MMR vaccine.

54:14.708 --> 54:20.612
And she was opposite on Democracy Now in 2015, opposite Paul Offit and Rand Paul.

54:21.132 --> 54:24.674
And again, as I've said, I don't think anyone is in this narrative by chance.

54:24.754 --> 54:31.858
And so this again is not random that these guys were also in front of us and remain in front of us now about these same matters.

54:33.579 --> 54:41.383
Interestingly, Brandy was involved in the Vaxxed movie.

54:43.038 --> 54:50.222
And Vax was released on April 1st, 2016, the same week or whatever that ICANN was formed with Del Bigtree, of course.

54:51.623 --> 55:00.468
And we watched a talk with Brandy in September of 2016, where she's talking about big pharma and big harms.

55:00.488 --> 55:02.649
She's talking about the ending the vaccine schedules.

55:02.689 --> 55:04.910
She's talking about injection versus ingestion.

55:04.950 --> 55:07.552
And she's not mentioning Vax to the movie, which is...

55:09.199 --> 55:10.621
I found it at least curious.

55:10.721 --> 55:22.433
Now at the time I didn't have that picture up there so you know I just thought wow that's cool but now it's even more intriguing that she didn't say anything because apparently she was involved with the release of the movie.

55:23.634 --> 55:27.598
It's notable in case you did not know the World Mercury Project of

55:28.138 --> 55:29.239
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:29.319 --> 55:31.920
became CHD in 2018.

55:32.700 --> 55:44.086
CHD was not formed as a new nonprofit, but as a nonprofit that changed its name from the World Mercury Project to Children's Health Defense in 2018.

55:44.126 --> 55:44.727
And in the fall of 2018,

55:50.402 --> 55:56.066
Learntherisk.org and its affiliates in different states had started to put billboards up around.

55:57.587 --> 55:59.728
And in 2019, she actually got on the news about it.

56:00.789 --> 56:03.410
The billboard said, healthy babies don't just die.

56:04.191 --> 56:09.114
And then memorialized a baby who died after vaccines, usually a SIDS death or something like that.

56:09.274 --> 56:13.037
And Brandy Vaughn was dead in December of 2020.

56:15.347 --> 56:25.253
Now, I thought it would be interesting, and I think that's going to be the subject here, to try and think about why is it that while I worked at CHD and worked for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:25.873 --> 56:29.255
for almost two years, no one ever said Brandy Vaughn's name.

56:29.916 --> 56:31.777
No one ever said Tony Bark's name.

56:35.096 --> 56:42.103
I find that interesting because after my own independent work getting to the language of intramuscular injection is dumb.

56:42.703 --> 56:47.268
Watching Brandy's videos and finding out that she was already there with ingestion versus injection.

56:50.255 --> 56:52.256
It just gets deeper and deeper and deeper, right?

56:52.296 --> 56:56.679
Because our language is sharp and could be adopted by anybody that wanted to.

56:56.719 --> 57:03.544
And you could even adopt it with the caveat of saying that I think Jonathan Cooley is one of the worst people on the internet.

57:03.604 --> 57:07.407
But what he says on that green screen is really perfect.

57:08.072 --> 57:12.898
It's the exact message that we need to pass on to our kids.

57:12.979 --> 57:25.115
And none of these people, none of these people will ever do that because it is specifically their job to curate a limited spectrum of debate where these truths are never realized.

57:28.700 --> 57:38.804
because the vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise and the basis for their inversion of our sovereignty to experimental animal status, which is actually doesn't matter for us.

57:38.844 --> 57:42.065
It matters for our kids and more importantly, our kids' kids, the grandkids.

57:45.107 --> 57:52.450
And so anybody that wants to speak out and wants to be heard, I think should submit a calendar because otherwise I'm going to make one for you.

57:53.510 --> 57:56.611
And generally speaking, these calendars are not exonerating.

57:56.671 --> 57:58.372
They make people look really bad.

57:59.978 --> 58:01.539
Um, they really do.

58:01.659 --> 58:05.222
I mean, Steve Bannon's calendar is absurd.

58:06.243 --> 58:19.112
It's, it's, it's impossible for a former employee of Goldman Sachs to explain the calendar that is his calendar from about 2000, let's say 17 or 18 until the end of the pandemic.

58:19.212 --> 58:28.139
It is absurd that this guy has a rung of the hamster wheel has now come up repeatedly in the last couple of weeks, but also very predictable.

58:29.246 --> 58:43.237
In fact, none other than Mark Kulak is responsible for identifying the seemingly very incredible and seminal role that this guy and his network of meddlers plays in American politics and maybe soon world politics.

58:45.479 --> 58:50.823
And so the bottom line is that these four guys are currently involved in something.

58:51.769 --> 59:08.711
that has to do with the work of Bret Weinstein's dad, because Bret Weinstein's dad was the first IP lawyer to be in the Department of Justice, appointed by John F. Kennedy in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy, of course, the father of the current Health and Human Services Secretary of America.

59:09.810 --> 59:24.978
I think one of the key players besides Robert Malone is Kevin McKernan and Kevin McKernan's five-year history of interacting with me, if you want to call it that, is also very damning as a patriot or let's say anti-patriot.

59:26.395 --> 59:27.856
And Bret Weinstein as well.

59:28.577 --> 59:33.964
And again, remember, I'm just trying to remind you, I got connected to Bret Weinstein by Piper Longsberry Stover.

59:34.484 --> 59:39.150
So if you wanted to do research or any journalist wanted to do research, they could have done that research in 2021.

59:39.751 --> 59:45.598
Because that's when I first tied my name to her by publishing a review that I should have published in January.

59:46.198 --> 59:50.220
of 2021 or December of 2020 and instead didn't publish it until May.

59:50.860 --> 59:59.544
And in retrospect, I think the whole time that I was writing and tweaking that review, Bret Weinstein had access to it, as probably all of these people did.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:06.031
Because I do think more or less they're one network.

01:00:06.431 --> 01:00:19.058
And what's important now in terms of thinking about how to understand this network is how many of these people would need to know everything versus how many people would just need to be willing to go along with what they're told to go along with.

01:00:20.939 --> 01:00:22.860
Because the rest are just kind of stuck.

01:00:24.645 --> 01:00:42.036
And for a long time, I was kind of stuck in between these people thinking that if I just got the right message through or the right combination of people to understand that I would make progress in climbing this ladder of ideas and get my ideas up to the top and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:42.076 --> 01:00:43.837
would finally say the words correctly.

01:00:45.858 --> 01:00:47.659
That's not how this network works.

01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:49.260
They make you feel like that.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.562
It's very much an illusion.

01:00:54.938 --> 01:01:02.142
And they agree to agree on things, including like, you know, let's just ignore people like Jonathan Cooley and Mark Kulak.

01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:06.464
So what did Jessica Rose do to stop this murder?

01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:20.031
What did Claire Craig, the collector of genomes before the pandemic and the 100,000 Genomes Project, what did she do to stop the murder in the UK?

01:01:20.932 --> 01:01:23.113
What did she do to stop the murder in America?

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.800
Not much.

01:01:26.081 --> 01:01:26.881
Oh, Robert Malone.

01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:29.642
What did Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone?

01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:30.863
Robert Malone's an MD.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:37.945
What has he said about the maybe misuse of supplementary oxygen or ventilation or anything like that?

01:01:40.026 --> 01:01:41.387
PCR testing, nothing.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:49.410
What about, I don't know, anyone wanted to stop the murder, was effectively fooled into solving the mystery instead?

01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:54.497
because a core group of people was put in place to enact it.

01:01:55.717 --> 01:01:57.697
So who is that core group of people, right?

01:01:57.717 --> 01:01:58.277
Who are they?

01:02:00.638 --> 01:02:03.779
I can tell you that those people don't want to save America's grandchildren.

01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:07.079
They are actors in the theater of transition to enslavement.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:08.440
It's a transition period.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:15.961
This is a period of three or four years where they have to convince young people that America's just screwed up.

01:02:16.661 --> 01:02:17.641
It's just broken.

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:19.942
It's not a system worth saving.

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.032
This is not done.

01:02:23.052 --> 01:02:42.547
These same meddlers that were involved in the show that was the pandemic are now going to transition into a new theater, whatever that is, that will include some of the biological aspects of the pandemic, but also expand and move forward as we transition to full enslavement.

01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:50.013
And that will include the dissolution of America, whether that be the North American union or some other abomination.

01:02:52.489 --> 01:02:55.310
They will convince our kids that America isn't worth saving.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:03:00.712
They will convince Americans that America isn't worth saving because half of America isn't worth having.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.373
They almost have us thinking that right now.

01:03:07.194 --> 01:03:16.037
And so if you realize that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and none of these people that are in front of us will say it, Bobby Kennedy won't say it even though it's definitely true.

01:03:22.011 --> 01:03:30.579
And they won't tell you about this anticipated rise in expected deaths and how it might've been used to create the illusion of a pandemic.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.581
You just need some sharp peaks here.

01:03:33.702 --> 01:03:47.314
You just need some sharp peaks that you can show out of context on the PBS NewsHour and point to a model where if you take this slope right here, boy, oh boy, I can project billions dead.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:04:04.394
And so make no mistake about it, I'm trying to be as distinct as possible, an anticipated rise in expected deaths was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

01:04:07.455 --> 01:04:09.116
I think that's what happened, I really do.

01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:16.482
And I think that this list of means, the ways that they murdered people is not complete, but it is pretty close.

01:04:17.082 --> 01:04:22.286
And it is certainly close enough so that there is no signal that cannot be explained by it.

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:26.750
And so the incompetence of doctors can no longer be dismissed.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.512
The incompetence of nurses can no longer be dismissed.

01:04:30.252 --> 01:04:32.994
And the role that these people in healthcare played

01:04:33.982 --> 01:04:38.683
in terms of spreading the narratives that we're killing people and murdering people.

01:04:38.723 --> 01:04:40.683
These people all need to be held to account.

01:04:41.183 --> 01:04:48.565
And as long as we keep focused on the COVID shots and not talking about 2020, we will never hold these people to account.

01:04:48.605 --> 01:04:50.485
There will be no justice for this murder.

01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:56.646
And that was the whole mystery solving thing in the first place was running out the clock.

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:59.807
Look how far we are from the murder happening.

01:04:59.847 --> 01:05:01.967
Look how obvious the murder is here.

01:05:03.561 --> 01:05:08.004
where we lose control of pneumonia after a decade of having it under control.

01:05:08.065 --> 01:05:11.988
We lost control of pneumonia for about two years and then we got back control again.

01:05:12.828 --> 01:05:17.011
That's not explainable by any other means other than murder.

01:05:17.051 --> 01:05:22.195
And yet all of these people are focused on solving the mystery of the novel virus.

01:05:23.697 --> 01:05:27.500
And more importantly, have been focused on it for five years.

01:05:30.662 --> 01:05:31.723
That's what this is, right?

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:37.464
That's what the whole Scooby-Doo mystery is.

01:05:41.446 --> 01:05:44.348
We were tricked into solving their mystery.

01:05:44.669 --> 01:05:54.375
And when we participated in this, it became very hard not to accept their monsters because that's part of the whole mystery solving exercise.

01:05:54.435 --> 01:05:56.817
The clues are the PCR tests.

01:05:57.177 --> 01:05:59.439
The clues were the argument over

01:05:59.899 --> 01:06:12.129
overcycling, the clues were the fear and cleavage site and the HIV inserts, the clues were the denial of Tony Fauci despite the badgering of Rand Paul, the clues were the hidden database.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.992
And we bid it hook, line, and sinker.

01:06:18.454 --> 01:06:27.441
Because these people were put in place in order to make sure that that mystery-solving exercise was as real and as lively

01:06:28.587 --> 01:06:31.809
and as a limited spectrum of debate as possible.

01:06:35.131 --> 01:06:37.213
Solve their mystery and accept their monsters.

01:06:40.435 --> 01:06:40.835
That's it.

01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:55.667
I know it seems like I'm repeating myself, but ladies and gentlemen, this is the story we need to pass down to our children so that our children teach it to their children, and essentially, in a generation, these people will have no power over us.

01:06:56.428 --> 01:07:06.913
It won't matter what stories they tell, but only if we are able to successfully pass this down to our children so that the grandchildren of Earth inherit the truth.

01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:08.108
That's it.

01:07:08.949 --> 01:07:18.558
That's why it's about all the marbles because there's only so long, a couple, three generations where there's gonna be roughly eight to 10 billion people on earth.

01:07:19.058 --> 01:07:33.692
So there's only really one multi-generational window with which to invert what it is many generations thinking as sovereign individuals to invert that into some kind of weird ultra-communist

01:07:34.352 --> 01:07:54.477
Sorry, you know socialist you owe everything to the state kind of thing and that includes all of your data from birth Until death because you know future generations need this Their God is AI AI is an illusion too because this whole thing is based on lies and

01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:58.052
They've been telling these lies for a very long time.

01:07:58.352 --> 01:08:07.094
Specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

01:08:07.534 --> 01:08:09.494
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

01:08:09.514 --> 01:08:12.675
And that's sort of my starting bias.

01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:23.498
Once again, anticipated rise and expected death sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies was used to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

01:08:25.919 --> 01:08:26.539
That's where we are.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.940
That's where we are right now in 2025.

01:08:30.521 --> 01:08:31.721
And nobody will talk about it.

01:08:46.694 --> 01:08:50.476
In case you're not aware, GigaOM Biological is supported only by viewers like you.

01:08:50.576 --> 01:08:59.179
If you have the means and you haven't yet and you would like to, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support our family's work.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm going to open a Patreon account.

01:09:02.588 --> 01:09:09.990
buy me coffee count and a couple other things because I know that there are people who have already given their credit card one time to those things and that might be easier.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:23.275
If anyone else is being bombarded by Sendowl asking you for money, please get in contact with me and let me know because I've heard at least one story of that and I don't like that possibility that that

01:09:24.036 --> 01:09:25.899
services starting to meddle with people.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.641
Anyway, here we are.

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.805
Again, this is about the grandchildren of Earth.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:31.246
It is 2025.

01:09:31.326 --> 01:09:32.067
We are in February.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.048
Let's go back in time.

01:09:39.056 --> 01:10:06.507
amazing warrior and woman one of my big heroes I love her so we're here at Cal Jam and I wanted to I'm doing a quick interview with her right before we go to lunch there's a lot of people here at Cal Jam yep my first time at Cal Jam I have to say it is unreal here you guys have got to go to Cal Jam next year you will love it yes have you been before yes I was here last year it's amazing amazing amazing and Del's speaking later in the video

01:10:07.688 --> 01:10:08.989
Just gonna pause it a second.

01:10:09.129 --> 01:10:25.684
I opened up a CalJam playlist earlier today and I was actually really surprised.

01:10:27.846 --> 01:10:31.409
There are a number of people in this CalJam list who

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.660
who are still in it today.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.381
I won't be able to do that now.

01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:42.562
I guess I thought I could quickly do that, but I don't think I can, so I'm just gonna continue here.

01:10:42.682 --> 01:10:43.662
The VAX bus is here, so.

01:10:44.222 --> 01:10:45.262
No, the VAX bus is not here.

01:10:45.522 --> 01:10:46.683
Oh, shoot, sorry.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:47.003
Sorry.

01:10:47.223 --> 01:10:47.623
Mistake.

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:47.943
We had to.

01:10:48.383 --> 01:10:48.923
Polly's here.

01:10:48.943 --> 01:10:51.484
It's going to be Monday, so it's got a few problems, but it's gonna be okay.

01:10:51.504 --> 01:10:56.365
All right, and so I just wanted to, I'm gonna ask Polly tough questions.

01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:57.885
I warned her.

01:10:58.465 --> 01:11:01.246
So Polly, is there anything, or is there,

01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:22.304
What I think I see here is a real first, you know, weekend or first week of interaction with Polly after having met her during the production of the movie in England.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:28.565
So they are not that well acquainted, but they are acquainted enough

01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:32.057
to where they feel very comfortable with one another.

01:11:32.678 --> 01:11:41.874
And I want to start the video again from the beginning and I want you to pay very close attention to the body language of Polly because I feel like there's something to see there.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.081
Hi everyone, I'm here with Polly Tommy, producer of Vaxxed.

01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:51.401
Amazing, amazing warrior and woman.

01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:52.661
One of my big heroes.

01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:54.162
I love her.

01:11:55.402 --> 01:11:55.902
I love her.

01:11:56.042 --> 01:12:01.703
So, we're here at Cal Jam and I'm doing a quick interview with her right before we go to lunch.

01:12:01.723 --> 01:12:02.923
There's a lot of people here at Cal Jam.

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:06.604
My first time at Cal Jam, I have to say, it is unreal here.

01:12:06.684 --> 01:12:08.604
You guys have got to go to Cal Jam next year.

01:12:08.745 --> 01:12:09.745
You will love it.

01:12:10.185 --> 01:12:11.085
Have you been before?

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:12.406
Yes, I was here last year.

01:12:12.526 --> 01:12:13.086
It's amazing.

01:12:13.247 --> 01:12:14.668
It's amazing, amazing.

01:12:16.049 --> 01:12:17.990
And Del's speaking later, and the VAX bus is here.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:19.752
No, the VAX bus is not here.

01:12:19.912 --> 01:12:20.512
Oh, shoot.

01:12:20.772 --> 01:12:21.413
Sorry.

01:12:21.653 --> 01:12:22.033
Mistake.

01:12:22.794 --> 01:12:23.334
Polly's here.

01:12:23.354 --> 01:12:26.177
It's going to be a men's day, so it's got a few problems, but it's going to be OK.

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:27.217
All right.

01:12:27.438 --> 01:12:30.780
And so I just wanted to, I'm going to ask Polly tough questions.

01:12:31.321 --> 01:12:32.261
I warned her.

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:36.144
So Polly, is there anything, or is there, whoa.

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.348
So she can't possibly imagine

01:12:41.292 --> 01:12:50.021
that Andrew Wakefield, the amazing Polly Tommy, who they what they used to call her and still kind of do sometimes I find that interesting,

01:12:52.395 --> 01:13:04.898
She can't possibly imagine that ICANN and Vaxxed and that whole story and Mary Holland are all being set up to stand in front of and overwhelm her.

01:13:06.139 --> 01:13:13.881
And yet that what's to me in retrospect seems to have happened because she had her organization and then all these people

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:22.288
came out of the woodwork, you know, imagine you start an anti-vax organization feeling like you're alone in the desert.

01:13:22.828 --> 01:13:31.094
And then suddenly a few moments later, somebody's on TV talking about the MMR vaccine and adjuvants.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:36.577
And then someone else calls you and says, Hey, we're making a movie about the MMR vaccine in the UK.

01:13:36.597 --> 01:13:37.718
You want to come and be in it?

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:45.979
and you would never, it would never occur to you that they wouldn't be doing, they're not doing, this is not, this is, wow, this is great.

01:13:47.059 --> 01:13:48.159
And that's what you see here.

01:13:48.199 --> 01:13:53.141
She still hasn't realized that this whole operation might be for her.

01:13:57.902 --> 01:13:59.883
My, yeah, too much wine last night.

01:13:59.943 --> 01:14:03.023
Anyway, is there such thing as a safe vaccine?

01:14:03.203 --> 01:14:04.884
No, no, no such thing as a safe vaccine.

01:14:05.224 --> 01:14:08.805
In fact, I was going as far to say, if you have had a vaccine that you are,

01:14:10.256 --> 01:14:11.737
You are injured in some way or form.

01:14:11.998 --> 01:14:14.219
You may not realize it, but you are a vaccine.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.503
If you put a vaccine inside you, you will have an injury of some sort.

01:14:18.723 --> 01:14:21.426
Now, what I find interesting about this is I don't know.

01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:26.150
I'm not going to waste my time to figure it out because my gut feeling tells me that it's true.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:32.115
That it's very rare, if ever, anyone from CHD actually says that anymore.

01:14:33.717 --> 01:14:38.400
and certainly not in the last five years, that every vaccine, if you took a vaccine, you're injured.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:49.366
That's a very, very, very, very, very bold statement that I don't think that Polly or Mary ever says anymore, which I find extraordinary.

01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:51.848
Such thing as a safe vaccine.

01:14:52.608 --> 01:14:53.109
I love it.

01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:57.371
I love that you say that too, because that's, I think every shot, every vaccine does something.

01:14:57.651 --> 01:14:59.773
I love that you say that too.

01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:05.211
Remember, this isn't that dangerous because this is not in the movie Vaxxed.

01:15:06.672 --> 01:15:10.534
This is on a platform presumably that only her viewers will see.

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:18.216
And so it's no different than if Jessica Rose goes on my stream and says that, yeah, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:15:18.997 --> 01:15:25.042
Or if Sukrit Bhakti comes on Stephen Frost's stream and says, yeah, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:15:25.082 --> 01:15:26.683
So why should we talk about it anymore?

01:15:27.324 --> 01:15:30.267
It's no different than her saying that all vaccines are bad.

01:15:30.307 --> 01:15:31.848
If you've had a vaccine, you're injured.

01:15:31.868 --> 01:15:33.730
If she doesn't say that in Vaxxed,

01:15:35.103 --> 01:15:43.253
If she hasn't said that for the last 10 years, every time she has a chance to be on camera, what are they really doing?

01:15:46.057 --> 01:15:47.479
I'm sorry, but this is what I think.

01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:57.017
Whether or not it's apparent right away, whether or not it takes months, weeks, years to manifest, there is some damage done.

01:15:57.398 --> 01:16:07.206
And in fact, I was just speaking with a woman who did a Dr. Sears' selected and delayed schedule, and her son had a reaction just with one vaccine, first vaccine.

01:16:08.347 --> 01:16:22.032
DTAP and she's like I you know not even one is Is worth it and you never know what's gonna happen really bad as well people I know it's not a vaccination, but I tell you this it is a wicked stuff Do not put that in your newborn baby.

01:16:22.073 --> 01:16:22.593
Do not do it

01:16:23.393 --> 01:16:29.617
There are some of the same ingredients that are harmful in vaccines in vitamin K. It is not just a vitamin and saline.

01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:30.357
Don't believe it.

01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:35.881
And Europe doesn't do vitamin K. And we're, you know, we're not seeing bleed outs and all of that stuff.

01:16:37.742 --> 01:16:41.464
Europe doesn't do vitamin K and we're not seeing.

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.685
She's speaking like she's living in Europe.

01:16:43.725 --> 01:16:44.206
Do you hear it?

01:16:44.226 --> 01:16:47.828
That's very important to hear that because we're not seeing.

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:52.851
Sounds like she's lived in Europe long enough to call that we.

01:16:54.506 --> 01:16:59.290
All right, so next tough question, well this one's not tough.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.211
Don't make it scientific, I'm not a scientist.

01:17:03.573 --> 01:17:09.617
So I just wanted to give, for those who don't know your story, how you got involved.

01:17:10.998 --> 01:17:18.664
It's a tough question because it's a tough story and I went and visited Polly and Jonathan and family on the ranch in Austin.

01:17:19.464 --> 01:17:37.082
my son was there and it was it was amazing like seeing seeing your family and the passion and your son and and seeing it firsthand because I'm not gonna lie I haven't seen autism firsthand like that very often before

01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:43.567
And it was raw, and I just have so much immense respect for what you guys go through.

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:46.189
So, how did you really start?

01:17:46.509 --> 01:17:47.389
How did your story start?

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.451
So if you watch Vaxx, you'll see my stories in there.

01:17:49.471 --> 01:17:58.938
But basically, in a nutshell, I was extremely pro-vaccine, to the point where if this had not happened to my family, I think I would be working for Merck as a troll.

01:17:59.438 --> 01:18:00.379
And I'd be a really good one.

01:18:00.939 --> 01:18:02.479
That's how pro-vaccine I was.

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:10.441
I was told on the day I took my boy, who's my second child, so I'd already vaccinated my daughter Bella, that there was a problem with the MMR.

01:18:10.481 --> 01:18:12.341
And that was the only vaccination he was having that morning.

01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:14.962
And I just thought that, well, she was one of my best friends.

01:18:15.162 --> 01:18:17.082
In fact, we've never really spoken again since, which is really sad.

01:18:17.282 --> 01:18:18.022
Must put that right one day.

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:21.103
And Billy had the MMR in the morning.

01:18:21.783 --> 01:18:26.664
By that evening, huge seizure, rushed him into hospital, really frightening.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:53.355
Understand that I'm not saying in this video that Polly's necessarily bad but She could have been recruited to play this role Of all the moms, you know and of all the people they chose they chose wisely I'm I'm erring on the side of no one is in this narrative by chance and

01:18:54.124 --> 01:18:59.167
I'm not saying that she didn't suffer, that her son wasn't injured, that the MMR story is not true.

01:18:59.547 --> 01:19:00.628
I'm not saying any of that.

01:19:00.668 --> 01:19:13.655
What I'm saying is, is that in order for this to occur, this multi-generational exercise theater would have recruited exactly Polly Tommy.

01:19:14.976 --> 01:19:16.537
Because there are more than one of her.

01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:21.620
And there are a lot of her in America too.

01:19:24.349 --> 01:19:30.451
who because of the nature of their family is existence, they're between a rock and a hard place.

01:19:30.511 --> 01:19:44.015
And so, you know, that position can be made significantly less painful by simply sticking to a limited spectrum of debate that from your perspective is still pretty good or still okay.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:47.956
They'll do it.

01:19:49.997 --> 01:19:52.798
The more severe their kids are damaged, the more likely they'll do it.

01:19:53.769 --> 01:20:00.051
That's why I think people like Brandy and myself are especially dangerous, because we don't have the kid.

01:20:02.472 --> 01:20:12.815
So we don't have this extra burden, we don't have this extra time sink, money sink, and we don't have this extra pain in the background that can be used in nefarious ways.

01:20:16.036 --> 01:20:19.617
We have different vulnerabilities, of course, which we've seen with Brandy.

01:20:21.325 --> 01:20:24.946
But I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, something stinks of high heaven here.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.428
Falling back, really, really, really, really sick little boy.

01:20:28.928 --> 01:20:32.249
And once they heard that he's had the MMR, they said that, look, you know what, this is normal.

01:20:32.589 --> 01:20:33.969
This is very normal, don't worry.

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:37.231
He'll take a load more antibiotics and off you go.

01:20:37.371 --> 01:20:39.311
Now, Billy never woke up.

01:20:40.172 --> 01:20:43.913
We've only ever had 13 months of how Billy should be.

01:20:44.593 --> 01:20:46.294
And now he, I have to tell you,

01:20:46.954 --> 01:20:52.500
he's 20 years old, he has huge meltdowns that we can barely cope with and that's something that no one talks about.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.844
They don't talk about the aggressiveness of vaccine injury when they've become adults.

01:20:57.324 --> 01:21:01.569
They're much bigger than our six foot four and we've got a lot of this out in this world right now.

01:21:01.589 --> 01:21:06.233
I don't know how, we've got to really really be positive and work out how we're going to look after these adults because it's

01:21:07.054 --> 01:21:08.015
Think, people, think.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:09.316
Don't do what I did.

01:21:09.336 --> 01:21:09.816
Think.

01:21:10.436 --> 01:21:12.938
Do what Brandy did and do your research before you have children.

01:21:13.358 --> 01:21:16.901
And I cannot tell you how the unvaccinated children are so healthy.

01:21:17.161 --> 01:21:18.041
They're so healthy.

01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:21.283
It makes me weep inside that I gave any of my children a vaccine.

01:21:21.624 --> 01:21:28.548
And then I met Andy, and Andy and I worked together on an autism media channel, desperately trying to expose living with autism.

01:21:28.628 --> 01:21:31.350
I mean, if you hear her here, it's hard to imagine.

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:33.491
You know, it's really hard to imagine.

01:21:34.492 --> 01:21:38.875
Again, it's a limited spectrum of debate and not everybody has much of a choice.

01:21:40.576 --> 01:21:41.317
I don't know what to say.

01:21:41.757 --> 01:21:50.123
The MMR announced, since being on the RV, traveling around, I have had more education in the last nine months than I have in a whole 19 years of doing this.

01:21:50.443 --> 01:21:52.885
From you, the parents, the parents are going to win this.

01:21:52.985 --> 01:21:55.406
The parents are the ones, they know what happened to their child.

01:21:55.807 --> 01:21:57.008
They will not be bullied anymore.

01:21:57.028 --> 01:21:59.409
They're speaking out and we are winning.

01:21:59.449 --> 01:22:00.110
We're winning, Brandi.

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:01.170
Yes, I agree.

01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:01.691
I agree.

01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:02.952
And it is the parents that are going to

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:26.778
win this and we need to be stronger stronger in numbers and we need to speak the full truth like i started with that that question you know there's no such thing as a safe vaccine and there never will be and i love we need to speak the full truth there is no safe vaccine and there never will be we need to speak the full truth now here's brandy saying something that i think

01:22:27.827 --> 01:22:36.191
Quite frankly, I said in a Zoom meeting in front of the whole CHD staff more than once, we have to say the whole truth.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:39.812
We have to say it now while everybody's listening to us.

01:22:39.892 --> 01:22:41.573
Why aren't we saying the whole truth?

01:22:42.053 --> 01:22:46.976
Why are we establishing a big top tent of health, freedom and selling brats inside?

01:22:47.036 --> 01:22:47.616
And that's it.

01:22:48.016 --> 01:22:48.896
What's going on?

01:22:49.037 --> 01:22:49.837
Oh, sorry, books.

01:22:50.497 --> 01:22:51.318
I like bratwurst.

01:22:51.558 --> 01:22:52.318
I guess I'm hungry.

01:22:52.898 --> 01:22:56.320
I watched Suzanne Humphries speak earlier and she said it.

01:22:57.415 --> 01:22:57.935
verbatim.

01:22:58.196 --> 01:23:18.167
Susan Humphreys, another person that I've said repeatedly, is a hero and in fact this guy, Roman Bozanski, I wonder sometimes about this fella because he was circulating the alternative podcast scene a year and a half ago, including Doc Malek trying to get me to interview this guy.

01:23:19.307 --> 01:23:43.940
I think I've seen several times where CHD has had Susan Humphreys on stage but I have her on stage with like James Lyons Weiner and Sabine Hazan and a couple other people so that she never gets to really say exactly how alone she was for how long she was alone about the things that she was alone about with regard to speaking out.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.161
So it's cool that she's mentioning her here again.

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:50.472
And it was amazing because we need the full truth.

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.194
We don't have time for watered down messages.

01:23:52.234 --> 01:23:56.739
We don't have time for all of the, you know, all of that.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.343
We don't have time for the watered down messages.

01:24:00.404 --> 01:24:01.204
Do you hear this?

01:24:01.845 --> 01:24:02.466
Wow.

01:24:02.566 --> 01:24:03.087
It's awesome.

01:24:03.895 --> 01:24:07.018
That, I think, is the half-slogan of at least one, if not two, pediatric

01:24:30.054 --> 01:24:34.177
pediatric doctor's offices in the Chicagoland area.

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:44.585
Born fearfully, born fearful, perfect and fear, sorry, perfect, fearfully perfect.

01:24:44.885 --> 01:24:49.148
I don't remember exactly how it goes, but we are born perfect, perfectly made, yes.

01:24:49.895 --> 01:24:50.576
perfectly made.

01:24:51.356 --> 01:24:55.039
And I think his last name was Meyer.

01:24:55.099 --> 01:24:58.142
He was a doctor and he taught a couple other people.

01:24:58.182 --> 01:25:05.147
There was a doctor in Chicago for a long time, a very famous Jewish doctor who was not giving anybody vaccines in Chicago.

01:25:05.247 --> 01:25:07.009
And I think his last name was Meyer about

01:25:07.689 --> 01:25:09.550
Wonderfully made, yeah, yeah, sorry, anyway.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:11.671
Fearfully and wonderfully made, is that what it was?

01:25:11.711 --> 01:25:12.291
Something like that.

01:25:12.511 --> 01:25:14.932
Problem we've got in this world, food is disgusting.

01:25:15.052 --> 01:25:16.472
It's killing people.

01:25:16.833 --> 01:25:19.514
Yeah, and I see it with my vaccine-free son.

01:25:19.674 --> 01:25:32.379
He is so healthy, and every single friend of mine that had children around the same time, they vaccinated, and every single child out of eight has an issue, and some have major issues.

01:25:32.759 --> 01:25:35.860
One is seeing a nephrologist for kidney stones at four years of age.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:41.423
One is seeing a neurologist for tics and has massive allergies.

01:25:41.843 --> 01:25:42.924
And in fact, I have one.

01:25:43.524 --> 01:25:44.485
Tics, that's funny.

01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:47.886
I think Kevin McCarron used to work on tics and Tourette's.

01:25:48.607 --> 01:25:57.071
Friend who had two boys and her first boy, asthma, you know, ear infections, antibiotics all the time, allergic to gluten, soy, dairy.

01:25:57.372 --> 01:26:00.413
So with the second boy, she thought maybe genetics, right?

01:26:00.573 --> 01:26:01.874
The doctor said it was genetics.

01:26:03.775 --> 01:26:04.915
No, it's not genetics.

01:26:05.155 --> 01:26:07.216
Genes do not trigger by themselves.

01:26:07.256 --> 01:26:08.896
There has to be a toxic trigger.

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:13.577
And so the second son, she didn't feed him soy, dairy, gluten.

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:16.157
So guess what he became allergic to?

01:26:16.177 --> 01:26:17.178
Fruit.

01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:19.778
Fruit and nightshades and seafood.

01:26:20.098 --> 01:26:25.399
Because whatever you introduce into the body after you have that toxic trigger, you're going to develop a reaction to, right?

01:26:25.959 --> 01:26:29.200
And so it's clear, it's clear as day that these allergies

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.166
Why are we not saying this out loud?

01:26:33.386 --> 01:26:39.095
It's remarkable that after 10 years they still can't say it out loud.

01:26:39.456 --> 01:26:43.983
The food allergies, asthma, the autoimmune issues, autism, neurological damages.

01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:49.227
I mean, we have to say no to all of them because our body is healthy.

01:26:49.487 --> 01:26:52.589
We need to start honouring it and really embracing that.

01:26:52.869 --> 01:26:54.370
And don't be bullied, people.

01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:55.271
This is all I'm hearing.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.212
I'm travelling around listening to these stories.

01:26:57.752 --> 01:27:03.996
All I'm hearing is the level of bullying that's going on from paediatricians or just when you've just given birth.

01:27:04.256 --> 01:27:08.599
If you're about to have a baby, please take in a big army of people with you because you're going to need them.

01:27:09.419 --> 01:27:11.701
If you're not feeling very good after you've had your baby,

01:27:12.481 --> 01:27:15.162
I'm hearing that the doctors just whip them away, give them a couple of vaccines.

01:27:15.502 --> 01:27:19.023
You need a guard around there of vax angels.

01:27:19.283 --> 01:27:19.423
Yep.

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:20.084
I just made that up.

01:27:20.104 --> 01:27:23.925
Don't ever, I love that, don't ever leave your kids alone.

01:27:23.945 --> 01:27:27.246
I keep hearing more and more and more and more stories and it's heartbreaking.

01:27:27.566 --> 01:27:29.806
What a crazy message this is, right?

01:27:29.886 --> 01:27:36.488
I mean, can you imagine if CHD would have done just one video like this during the pandemic?

01:27:37.148 --> 01:27:47.910
Nevermind a weekly video or something, or if Polly, every time she opened up with CHD this morning with the chicken sound that she said this, don't forget, there is no such thing as a good vaccine.

01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:49.970
If you've had a vaccine, you're probably injured.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:52.471
This is CHD TV and welcome to the show.

01:27:59.042 --> 01:28:02.850
vaxed logo on the jacket because they spared no expense, of course.

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:05.458
You know, the parents say, oh, but it was in my birth plan.

01:28:05.498 --> 01:28:06.278
It was on the files.

01:28:06.678 --> 01:28:09.559
I told the doctors, the nurses, oh, well, nurse changes shifts.

01:28:09.979 --> 01:28:11.699
Oops, didn't read your birth plan.

01:28:11.759 --> 01:28:12.199
Sorry.

01:28:12.359 --> 01:28:15.460
I saw there was no hep B. Gave it to him while I was weighing him.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.581
You know, if this is happening, it's real.

01:28:17.881 --> 01:28:18.581
We're being bullied.

01:28:18.641 --> 01:28:19.661
We're not being told the truth.

01:28:20.101 --> 01:28:26.863
And we need to start, we really need to stand up for our children and share this information with everybody.

01:28:27.143 --> 01:28:29.224
We need an army getting this out there.

01:28:30.334 --> 01:28:31.395
Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

01:28:31.435 --> 01:28:31.735
No worries.

01:28:32.795 --> 01:28:33.836
Guys, this is going to happen.

01:28:33.856 --> 01:28:45.100
If you've got a teenage daughter and you're thinking about giving your daughter the HPV vaccine, you will go into the paediatrician and even if you question it, they will say to you, do you want your child, your daughter or your son to have cancer?

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.141
Do you want them to have cancer?

01:28:46.201 --> 01:28:48.322
Because that is what you're going to do if you don't have this vaccine.

01:28:49.102 --> 01:28:49.902
Huge lie, people.

01:28:50.463 --> 01:28:51.563
Get out of there as fast as you can.

01:28:51.884 --> 01:28:55.886
HPV vaccine is one of the worst, most evil things on this planet.

01:28:56.346 --> 01:29:01.989
Stay away from it, and stay away from pediatricians, stay away from psychiatrists, and just go and get yourself a chiropractor.

01:29:02.389 --> 01:29:02.910
And I'll be that.

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:05.931
Yes, and good food, organics, all of that.

01:29:06.111 --> 01:29:07.052
HPV is terrible.

01:29:07.112 --> 01:29:10.294
In fact, I just met at this conference upstairs, there's a vendor,

01:29:10.914 --> 01:29:18.298
And her 13-year-old daughter was given the HPV against her consent because the doctor said, I need to talk to her privately.

01:29:18.318 --> 01:29:20.339
The mother trusted the doctor.

01:29:20.419 --> 01:29:23.101
She had already told the doctor, no vaccines, no HPV.

01:29:23.841 --> 01:29:28.624
And the doctor gave it to the daughter while, in the five minutes that the mother wasn't there.

01:29:28.824 --> 01:29:30.765
And her daughter has not had a period since.

01:29:31.405 --> 01:29:33.607
And that was five months ago.

01:29:33.627 --> 01:29:34.788
The police should be called on.

01:29:34.808 --> 01:29:36.229
You should call the police on people who do that to you.

01:29:36.269 --> 01:29:41.654
And she was crying yesterday because I was telling her about the premature ovarian failure that's happening.

01:29:41.814 --> 01:29:45.657
It's almost, you could almost say it's common side effect.

01:29:46.338 --> 01:29:49.541
And it's devastating our girls for nothing.

01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:52.323
Stay away from HPV, Gardasil, stay away from DTAP, stay away from all vaccines.

01:29:52.343 --> 01:29:54.305
There is no such thing as a safe and effective vaccine.

01:29:54.485 --> 01:29:57.248
Vaccines do not belong in your body at all, period.

01:29:57.869 --> 01:30:01.233
All right, so we're gonna hit lunch and thank you so much.

01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:03.316
Yeah, thanks for joining us.

01:30:04.658 --> 01:30:08.442
Oh, and go to learntherisk.org and print flyers and get the information out there.

01:30:08.462 --> 01:30:10.265
We need an army to take this on.

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:11.126
Love you guys.

01:30:11.246 --> 01:30:11.987
Love you, bye.

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:14.431
We need an army.

01:30:14.531 --> 01:30:15.452
Print flyers.

01:30:15.752 --> 01:30:17.773
No vaccines are good vaccines.

01:30:17.833 --> 01:30:27.421
It's an interesting evolution of the message to go to rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

01:30:27.441 --> 01:30:30.643
A big top tent of health freedom.

01:30:35.407 --> 01:30:36.768
So let's move forward to 2018.

01:30:41.127 --> 01:30:41.767
Hi, everyone.

01:30:42.247 --> 01:30:43.868
So thanks for joining me live.

01:30:43.908 --> 01:30:46.769
I'm going to wait until a few more of you jump on.

01:30:49.449 --> 01:30:50.850
Sorry, I'm a few minutes late.

01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:57.851
My technology never works perfectly, as we all know, the spotlight that I'm under.

01:30:59.012 --> 01:31:07.374
But I had to move some things around, but I'm on now.

01:31:08.448 --> 01:31:14.815
And I'm going to cover something tonight that I really didn't want to cover.

01:31:15.455 --> 01:31:19.920
And it's something that has been going on for over a year and a half.

01:31:22.196 --> 01:31:27.239
a little bit longer than that, probably, since the, let's see, the fall of 2016.

01:31:27.759 --> 01:31:38.104
And I haven't said anything about it for many reasons that I'll go into, and I'm gonna try to make this as quick as possible.

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:50.090
But for those of you joining that are part of Alfie's Army and know me through that, this is not gonna be necessarily about that, and I'm sorry I haven't done an update video.

01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:51.231
I will this week, but,

01:31:52.515 --> 01:32:02.861
The fact that Alfie was buried without an autopsy, even through many, many, many hours and days of pleading with the family really kind of crushed me.

01:32:03.041 --> 01:32:09.445
So I had to take a little bit of a break this weekend from that.

01:32:10.486 --> 01:32:20.932
And this is not exactly the video I want to come back with, but I think that there's something that's been going on in the movements, and this is particularly US-based,

01:32:21.847 --> 01:32:25.651
maybe it's global now, that needs to be exposed.

01:32:25.971 --> 01:32:33.958
And, you know, I talk about a lot of things that I don't want to talk about and that I don't want happening.

01:32:34.818 --> 01:32:40.743
And it's not because I want drama in my life and this video has nothing to do with drama.

01:32:41.604 --> 01:32:45.528
It's just that I feel like there's so much truth that has to be exposed.

01:32:45.628 --> 01:32:49.351
And sometimes it happens with different people

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.277
in the movement, right?

01:32:52.077 --> 01:32:59.779
And we all know that in every movement, there are people that get into it for different reasons, right?

01:32:59.919 --> 01:33:02.979
Some are motivated about the kids and have good intentions.

01:33:03.659 --> 01:33:05.360
Some are motivated by ego.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.180
Some are motivated by power.

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.140
Some are motivated by money.

01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:14.081
And unfortunately, in our movement, we have a lot of everything.

01:33:15.121 --> 01:33:18.702
And before I go into specifics,

01:33:20.031 --> 01:33:28.214
I want to say that I did an interview with a woman who does a magazine called The Healist, and she interviews lightworkers.

01:33:28.494 --> 01:33:32.676
And I had an interview with her about a year ago, and she's an amazing person.

01:33:32.716 --> 01:33:34.597
And you can see the interview on our YouTube channel.

01:33:35.497 --> 01:33:41.819
And she asked me if I had ever experienced a glass ceiling in the movement.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.321
And it was so shocking to me, because I'd never really thought of it that way.

01:33:46.861 --> 01:33:48.202
But even when I worked it,

01:33:48.960 --> 01:34:04.270
an ad agency and a media planning agency and in the different companies that I worked in, even at Merck, I have to say, I never experienced any kind of glass ceiling for being a woman that I have in this movement.

01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:11.054
And I think that I have been continually disappointed, particularly by the men,

01:34:12.035 --> 01:34:23.528
in this movement, not everyone, but there are a lot of egos and a lot of power plays and a lot of sabotage of good people and a lot of people in it for the money.

01:34:23.548 --> 01:34:26.291
So you will see that

01:34:30.896 --> 01:34:38.580
I support, well, basically in this movement, I've been behind the scenes and I've heard so many different things and I've seen so many different things.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:47.044
And I'm not going to go into hundreds of stories, but if I don't share certain people's posts, if I don't allow them in the group,

01:34:48.476 --> 01:34:53.280
There's a reason, and I'm not going to go into everything tonight, that's for sure.

01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:58.405
But I am going to go into discussions about one.

01:34:58.946 --> 01:34:59.926
Thank you, Kristen.

01:34:59.967 --> 01:35:00.607
I love you too.

01:35:01.648 --> 01:35:06.953
About someone, because it's been about a year and a half that I've stayed silent, and I think that

01:35:07.575 --> 01:35:11.437
We all know by now it's not my role to stay silent in this movement.

01:35:12.857 --> 01:35:14.758
So I'm going to talk about it.

01:35:15.738 --> 01:35:29.624
And the reason I'm talking about it tonight is because someone very near and dear to me that I visited just two weeks ago in Philadelphia was the latest person who was, let's say,

01:35:32.329 --> 01:35:33.290
God, what's the right word?

01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:46.096
Not shunned, but ignored or, you know, cast away by someone that says he has very good intentions in this fight.

01:35:46.496 --> 01:35:58.442
And for over a year and a half, I've known that's not true.

01:35:58.582 --> 01:36:00.223
So I think it's time to expose it.

01:36:02.205 --> 01:36:12.815
And again, this isn't a video I like to make because of the drama and also because of the threats that he has threatened me with.

01:36:13.937 --> 01:36:16.919
But I'm gonna talk about it.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:26.148
So when I first got into this fight, Larry Cook contacted me and wanted to do videos of me.

01:36:27.442 --> 01:36:30.164
And this was before I had learned the riffs, before I knew anything.

01:36:30.204 --> 01:36:31.045
This was back in the early days.

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:46.816
Larry Cook is now, as far as I know, Larry Cook now is operating on Twitter, on X. I've seen a guy on our little movement that appears in my feed named Larry Cook, but I don't know if it's the same guy.

01:36:46.836 --> 01:36:48.337
It's in the spring of 2016.

01:36:48.377 --> 01:36:49.738
2015, my God, how time flies.

01:36:56.272 --> 01:36:59.413
Oh, and basically Heather Toronto says who was pushed aside.

01:36:59.853 --> 01:37:00.373
Oh, sorry.

01:37:00.393 --> 01:37:01.893
I got a little distracted.

01:37:01.934 --> 01:37:02.754
It's a little late here.

01:37:04.074 --> 01:37:08.115
It was Michelle Carroll and Jayden.

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:18.358
And that hurts me personally because they are such amazing people and Jayden is such a hero in this fight to expose what vaccines are doing.

01:37:20.385 --> 01:37:37.551
In the last couple weeks or in the last couple weeks Michelle had reached out to to Larry to just tag him in his videos and I'm sorry not videos in her post about the fundraising campaign that she's doing to help Jaden recover from

01:37:38.072 --> 01:37:41.238
vaccine-induced epilepsy and severe seizure disorder.

01:37:42.059 --> 01:37:44.865
So, someone says the truth will always come out.

01:37:45.185 --> 01:37:49.293
You know, I didn't want to do this video because I was hoping that the truth would come out.

01:37:50.365 --> 01:37:54.667
So I didn't have to do this video, but it's been over a year and a half.

01:37:55.028 --> 01:38:00.491
And some people like Nicole, who just joined us, have figured this out.

01:38:01.391 --> 01:38:04.513
And other people like Shauna Marie, who just did a video last week.

01:38:05.853 --> 01:38:07.995
But not enough people.

01:38:08.975 --> 01:38:09.635
Not enough people.

01:38:10.156 --> 01:38:11.096
So he hurt...

01:38:12.768 --> 01:38:16.210
he hurt someone close to me, Michelle, um, this week.

01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:17.711
And so that's it.

01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:18.531
You know, that's it.

01:38:18.771 --> 01:38:19.071
Okay.

01:38:19.211 --> 01:38:20.152
I know he's threatened me.

01:38:20.832 --> 01:38:26.015
Um, and I didn't do this video, um, from, for reasons because I didn't want to start drama.

01:38:26.035 --> 01:38:33.719
There's a lot of drama in the movement already, but he also told me, um, well, I'll go into the story.

01:38:33.819 --> 01:38:38.461
I'm looking at my notes because it's been kind of long and drawn out that I want to make sure to cover everything.

01:38:39.262 --> 01:38:39.362
Um,

01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:42.011
but this was kind of the last straw this week.

01:38:42.111 --> 01:38:52.799
And also three people in the last week, and I always think there are signs from the universe, and three people in the last week have mentioned that I'm working with him.

01:38:53.839 --> 01:38:56.641
And one of them was on the new Philadelphia billboard.

01:38:56.681 --> 01:39:01.165
She shared it and she said, look, Brandy Vaughn of Stop Mandatory Vaccinations did a new billboard.

01:39:01.685 --> 01:39:03.586
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:39:04.707 --> 01:39:07.149
Not associated to Stop Mandatory Vaccinations.

01:39:08.852 --> 01:39:11.174
Stop mandatory vaccinations.

01:39:11.234 --> 01:39:12.736
And she's going to be very clear here.

01:39:12.776 --> 01:39:15.078
I don't want to stop mandatory vaccinations.

01:39:15.138 --> 01:39:16.099
I don't work with them.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.781
That's his website.

01:39:17.821 --> 01:39:19.102
It's right there in the chat.

01:39:20.483 --> 01:39:26.890
We are talking about people that are involved, that are still manipulating us today, that are all in on this.

01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:39.339
I run learntherisk.org and I don't support Larry's efforts necessarily after what I found out about him in the last year and a half.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:41.901
But why does she think that?

01:39:41.981 --> 01:39:45.824
Why does she think that the billboards are him?

01:39:46.224 --> 01:39:53.889
Well, this is where my first notion, because like everyone naive to the movement, oh my God, I was naive.

01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:58.833
I've been in pharma and I was naive to all of the politics and BS that goes in this movement.

01:39:59.535 --> 01:40:03.337
and the egos, and the money, and the power plays, and the sabotage.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:05.358
Holy smokes, I'm not naive anymore.

01:40:05.719 --> 01:40:08.140
And that's why you see me not working with very many people.

01:40:09.401 --> 01:40:10.801
But I was naive.

01:40:11.582 --> 01:40:14.804
And I thought, oh, this guy, he has experience with videos.

01:40:14.844 --> 01:40:16.064
He wants to do these videos.

01:40:16.465 --> 01:40:19.826
So I signed away all my rights to the video, right?

01:40:19.886 --> 01:40:22.108
He made sure everybody did that when he videoed people.

01:40:23.208 --> 01:40:27.231
And he raised tens of thousands of dollars to do commercials in LA.

01:40:29.121 --> 01:40:32.827
and this was my first experience with him and um uh he

01:40:36.446 --> 01:40:44.968
I'm not even gonna go into how unprofessional the videos and the commercial was and how little the commercial actually cost compared to the amount of money he raised.

01:40:46.108 --> 01:40:55.550
But... Like, for example, how much money does CHD raise versus what do they spend it on and how do they spend it and what are their salaries that they're paying?

01:40:55.610 --> 01:41:02.911
Because there are organizations that are supporting the parents of people that lost kids to the opioid pandemic and

01:41:03.711 --> 01:41:09.216
and grandparents that have to take care of their grandkids because the parents of those kids are dead from the opioid pandemic.

01:41:09.716 --> 01:41:15.181
There are organizations that support those families where everybody that works for the organization is a volunteer.

01:41:17.403 --> 01:41:22.527
CHD paid me over $100,000 a year in salary to work for them.

01:41:23.168 --> 01:41:24.649
It was an awesome job.

01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:28.312
Because we had to be online like once or twice a week.

01:41:32.734 --> 01:41:38.359
Ladies and gentlemen, something very nasty is happening, and we are uncovering it very, very rapidly.

01:41:38.439 --> 01:41:40.221
The dam, I think, is breaking.

01:41:41.181 --> 01:41:43.864
My first awakening, because he became friends with me.

01:41:44.004 --> 01:41:51.650
And, you know, this has happened not just with him, but other people in the movement, where they become friends with me, and then they start to ask me questions, like, what are your ideas?

01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:53.012
What are your plans, Brandy?

01:41:53.052 --> 01:41:54.012
What are you going to do?

01:41:54.693 --> 01:41:58.576
And then they all of a sudden do it right before me, right?

01:41:59.137 --> 01:41:59.197
Or...

01:42:00.738 --> 01:42:05.781
You know, someone in this movement told me, spent three hours mining me for information.

01:42:05.801 --> 01:42:09.303
He put all these videos online and said, Brandy, I want to talk to you.

01:42:09.764 --> 01:42:14.286
I want to interview you for a new project that I'm doing, but after I, I'm going to make the project.

01:42:14.326 --> 01:42:21.170
So, you know, after I interview you, I won't release the interview for a couple months because I want to get a number of interviews in the bank before I do it.

01:42:23.212 --> 01:42:26.914
I have this new editor and he costs a lot of money, so I'm not really sure.

01:42:26.954 --> 01:42:28.555
I got to, I got to work this out yet.

01:42:28.595 --> 01:42:29.916
I'll get it up in a couple of weeks.

01:42:31.124 --> 01:42:32.786
I'm really good friends with Nick Hudson.

01:42:32.826 --> 01:42:34.207
I'll put it up in a couple of weeks.

01:42:35.007 --> 01:42:38.591
Oh, I would love to do a presentation for Panda.

01:42:38.671 --> 01:42:40.833
Oh, I would love to do a presentation for Panda.

01:42:40.853 --> 01:42:43.115
Oh, I would love to do a presentation for Panda.

01:42:44.956 --> 01:42:45.857
And then they're gone.

01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:57.908
Ladies and gentlemen, she's describing the 2018 version of what they've done to me and lots of other people on social media.

01:42:59.645 --> 01:43:15.095
making them feel like they're being heard, and taking all their useful ideas and contorting them, distorting them, distilling them down to useless forms, and then distributing them, like stop mandatory vaccination.

01:43:19.138 --> 01:43:20.439
And I take offense to that.

01:43:21.167 --> 01:43:22.528
Oh, why can't I get in touch with Brandy?

01:43:22.568 --> 01:43:23.468
Why doesn't Brandy call me?

01:43:23.488 --> 01:43:24.388
I want to help learn the risk.

01:43:24.789 --> 01:43:28.770
And then I have a three-hour conversation with him, tell him all my plans that I want to do.

01:43:29.131 --> 01:43:30.311
And then he says, oh, yeah.

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:31.111
Don't you remember?

01:43:31.151 --> 01:43:35.133
That's exactly what Sarah Westall is saying in the beginning of our thing.

01:43:35.173 --> 01:43:37.554
Like, she's saying that I was ignoring her.

01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:42.116
But the story is, she says she lost my phone number after the red pill.

01:43:43.937 --> 01:43:50.400
So it's all the same scam, just now done on social media instead of with a VHS camcorder.

01:43:51.857 --> 01:43:58.828
and much, much easier because of the phones that we have and the social media platforms that we are using.

01:44:00.796 --> 01:44:03.317
I don't want to reinvent the wheel.

01:44:03.377 --> 01:44:10.381
And then he goes and creates a website and materials and uses the same color scheme as me.

01:44:10.421 --> 01:44:12.202
Maybe some of you know who I'm talking about.

01:44:13.243 --> 01:44:18.105
And then he goes on to say he had to create that website because my materials were too expensive.

01:44:18.485 --> 01:44:22.568
And then he charges the same amount for his expense or his materials anyway.

01:44:23.628 --> 01:44:50.097
And then he goes behind the scenes and does private messages attacking me saying that I'm working for pharma Because I wouldn't let him work help learn the risk and the guy's kind of off the wall and not what I would consider professional So not someone I'm gonna work with but that's not even who we're talking about tonight But we're talking about Robin wants to know who that is does anyone else want to know who that is I'm trying to stick to one person tonight.

01:44:50.597 --> 01:44:52.118
No, that one's not Larry Larry

01:44:52.799 --> 01:44:55.322
we'll get to in a minute.

01:44:55.362 --> 01:44:57.824
But the one who did that whole thing was Greg Wyatt.

01:44:58.304 --> 01:44:59.766
Anyway, very disappointing.

01:45:01.668 --> 01:45:10.556
And he still attacks me behind the scenes and I still get messages about why he hates me and why he's sending private messages about how I work for pharma and all this BS.

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:16.362
Because again, he wanted to help with Learn the Risk and I didn't find him professional enough and his ego got

01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:18.256
hurt, right?

01:45:18.596 --> 01:45:20.718
But now I'm going to talk about some greed.

01:45:20.779 --> 01:45:23.802
And so I know I'm going a little bit all over the board.

01:45:23.902 --> 01:45:24.482
Sorry, guys.

01:45:24.623 --> 01:45:31.970
I wasn't expecting to do a video tonight, but I was inspired because Michelle was hurt, was the latest person hurt by Larry.

01:45:33.772 --> 01:45:39.719
And so my first- No, she said Gary Wyatt or Greg Wyatt.

01:45:40.942 --> 01:45:46.985
Um, and I thought I saw that in my chat earlier, but I don't, I don't remember what I saw in the chat.

01:45:47.025 --> 01:45:47.345
Yeah.

01:45:47.425 --> 01:45:48.305
She said Greg Wyatt.

01:45:48.765 --> 01:45:58.229
Instinct that he was not, um, really all, you know, good intentioned was, um, when he started sharing some of my first learn the risk billboards.

01:45:58.949 --> 01:45:59.870
And then I'm going to circle back.

01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:09.514
This was why someone this week thought that the billboard, um, and the Philadelphia, the Philadelphia billboard was learned was, um, stop mandatory vaccination.

01:46:10.422 --> 01:46:20.120
Um, so the, um, the, the reason she thought that was because when I did my first billboards in 2015, at the end of 2015,

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.382
in the beginning of 2016, Larry shared them.

01:46:26.883 --> 01:46:31.146
And he just forgot to mention originally in his post that it was Learn the Risk.

01:46:31.326 --> 01:46:33.627
So he branded- Forgot to mention.

01:46:33.647 --> 01:46:37.610
You know how often people mention me without remembering to mention me?

01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:44.655
How many times they say that it's Jonathan Cooley but can't provide a link to my website or never say GigaOM Biological.

01:46:44.715 --> 01:46:47.197
How often did that happen with just Brett Weinstein alone?

01:46:48.957 --> 01:46:53.361
Stop mandatory vaccination all over everything because the guy is just all about the money guys.

01:46:53.501 --> 01:47:08.153
He has no kids He's never really been in it for the kids He is a really good Marketer and a very good business person and very good at He's charming in certain ways, right?

01:47:11.335 --> 01:47:15.799
I'm sure he could sell snake oil if he wanted and pretty much

01:47:17.543 --> 01:47:21.526
You know, but I was even charmed or fooled in the beginning thinking that he was a good guy.

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:34.494
And then he started sharing the learn the risk billboards and people started donating to stop mandatory vaccination because he was the way he was phrasing things implied that he was doing them.

01:47:34.835 --> 01:47:39.938
And granted, this has been that was almost nine months after he'd done a commercial or maybe even a year.

01:47:40.378 --> 01:47:41.699
And he hadn't done anything since.

01:47:41.759 --> 01:47:43.260
But he continued to raise money.

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.402
He continued to sell advertising.

01:47:45.522 --> 01:47:47.263
One of the funny things is with regard to

01:47:48.223 --> 01:47:52.304
that CHD spelled her name wrong.

01:47:52.784 --> 01:48:01.486
Kevin McCairn on his website, The Dojo, was always spelling my name wrong by spelling Jonathan with a J-O-H-N.

01:48:02.106 --> 01:48:11.568
And I think the reason why he did that is because there is a John Cooey in Tennessee who killed some people, who I'm definitely not related to, but oddly has the same last name.

01:48:11.628 --> 01:48:13.669
I don't know very many people with the last name Cooey.

01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:18.950
And so just the same kind of trick gets played, right?

01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:22.591
You're changing the search terms without people knowing.

01:48:23.391 --> 01:48:27.432
And so it looks like he's promoting me, but he would never correct the spelling.

01:48:28.432 --> 01:48:31.533
It's so sad how pathetic these people are.

01:48:31.573 --> 01:48:36.074
As soon as I saw that he didn't know how to spell my name, I knew that he was a meddler.

01:48:36.114 --> 01:48:38.554
It's one of the things that gave him away from the very beginning.

01:48:38.594 --> 01:48:40.475
And I just had to keep doubting myself

01:48:41.095 --> 01:48:44.438
for years because everybody else made me doubt.

01:48:45.478 --> 01:48:48.881
But I mean, he's been giving himself away for five years now.

01:48:48.921 --> 01:48:57.707
And so Brandy's describing the same kind of phenomenon with the people that she's been encountering since she was involved in the movie Vax, which is really remarkable.

01:48:58.048 --> 01:49:01.510
On his website, do affiliate stuff, like making a lot of money, right?

01:49:02.271 --> 01:49:09.076
So he was, he was sharing these things and you know, there were,

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:38.152
He he kind of we were friends right a little bit or I thought he was right and he would always ask me about things And then there were a lot of different things that went on it was over a few month period But he was always mining me for information, and then he was telling me things like Like I should never call out anyone who's not in it for the real reasons for in this movement because Then people would attack me

01:49:38.992 --> 01:49:44.519
Oh, that sounds like a very similar message that countless people in this movement have given me since I started.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:53.148
Including the soon-to-be NIH director who's told me several times the last time I saw him in person not to talk about Robert Malone anymore.

01:49:54.245 --> 01:49:56.746
Remarkable times, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49:56.986 --> 01:50:00.686
Right, so as he's mining me for information, and this will come back, right?

01:50:01.207 --> 01:50:05.788
He's telling me these things, Brandi, you can never call people out because then people won't donate to you either.

01:50:06.208 --> 01:50:09.708
You know, you need to be very careful and all of these things, right?

01:50:09.768 --> 01:50:10.549
Now I look back.

01:50:10.649 --> 01:50:13.409
You're shooting yourself in the foot if you keep calling these people out.

01:50:13.469 --> 01:50:14.889
Nobody wants to listen to this.

01:50:14.969 --> 01:50:18.090
Nobody wants to hear that people are bad guys.

01:50:18.130 --> 01:50:21.671
That's the reason why you don't get any followers and nobody follows your account, Jay.

01:50:22.938 --> 01:50:24.963
on it and realize what he was doing.

01:50:24.983 --> 01:50:29.615
He was manipulating me so that I would never call him out for the things he was doing.

01:50:30.524 --> 01:50:33.045
So he's sharing my billboards.

01:50:33.165 --> 01:50:37.566
People were donating to stop mandatory vaccination to fund these billboards, right?

01:50:37.646 --> 01:50:39.706
Like thousands and thousands of dollars.

01:50:40.246 --> 01:50:41.587
And people started alerting me.

01:50:42.007 --> 01:50:48.909
And I said, so I called him and he's like, well, I don't agree.

01:50:48.929 --> 01:50:52.390
I don't think people are donating towards the billboards.

01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:53.850
And I'm like, but I have screenshots.

01:50:53.890 --> 01:50:54.830
These people are donating.

01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:57.731
Oh, I just donated Larry for your billboards, right?

01:50:59.918 --> 01:51:02.760
Don't forget that all of these people are raising money.

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.262
You have to subscribe to all these substacks.

01:51:05.282 --> 01:51:16.111
You have to support all of these non-profits like Door to Freedom, or the Hope Accord, or the Brownstone Institute, or the World Health Council.

01:51:17.852 --> 01:51:19.272
CHD needs your money.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:20.353
Are you kidding me?

01:51:20.413 --> 01:51:21.673
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:51:21.753 --> 01:51:32.535
still up until very recently was raising money to pay for his expenditures during his campaign that included security that I guess the Secret Service of the United States should have but did not provide.

01:51:35.975 --> 01:51:44.537
And so it's not for nothing that nobody has any money to give to anybody who's real because there's like 4,000 false places to dump your money.

01:51:45.489 --> 01:51:49.532
where money is laundered, but also where real people's money is wasted.

01:51:51.874 --> 01:51:52.615
Screenshots, right?

01:51:52.655 --> 01:51:58.420
And he's like, Brandy, you don't need to send them to me because I'm not gonna redirect the money to you.

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:08.628
So I was asking him to redirect the money from Stop Mandatory Vaccination to Learn the Risk because people are donating to him and he's not doing the billboards, right?

01:52:09.469 --> 01:52:11.310
So he refused.

01:52:12.171 --> 01:52:13.132
And I said,

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:19.284
Um, you know, I said, well, like, I couldn't believe it.

01:52:19.364 --> 01:52:19.925
I was shocked.

01:52:20.045 --> 01:52:20.265
Right.

01:52:20.345 --> 01:52:26.931
Because I, when I stepped into this movement, I mean, yes, I worked in pharma, but I still kind of believe in the good in people.

01:52:26.971 --> 01:52:27.151
Right.

01:52:27.191 --> 01:52:32.636
And I had no idea that people would get involved in a movement like this for money or for ego or for power.

01:52:32.796 --> 01:52:33.016
Right.

01:52:33.997 --> 01:52:41.063
But what if you had a devastating thing happen to your family that was ruining everything, ruining your marriage,

01:52:41.747 --> 01:52:52.334
ruining your ability to interact with your healthy kids, ruining your ability to live as an adult like you used to, where you could look in the mirror and be proud of yourself or happy with yourself.

01:52:54.675 --> 01:52:56.757
And then somebody offered you a way out.

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:01.660
Brandy doesn't understand it because she doesn't have an injured kid.

01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:04.242
And I'm not saying she's bad.

01:53:04.282 --> 01:53:06.023
I'm just trying to explain what you're hearing here.

01:53:07.662 --> 01:53:11.765
I mean, I wasn't, man, who would step into this movement?

01:53:11.885 --> 01:53:13.005
I mean, you get attacked.

01:53:13.145 --> 01:53:15.087
Why would someone do that for those reasons?

01:53:15.287 --> 01:53:15.947
I thought, right?

01:53:16.367 --> 01:53:17.468
Because I'm in it for my son.

01:53:17.548 --> 01:53:18.649
My son's vaccine free.

01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:19.369
He's targeted.

01:53:19.389 --> 01:53:24.132
He was in the first kindergarten class that couldn't go to school under SB277.

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:29.315
And I saw, I knew that what pharma was doing because I was in the movement.

01:53:29.655 --> 01:53:33.518
So I had no idea that people would actually be in this movement for ulterior reasons, right?

01:53:33.578 --> 01:53:35.339
Like I still believed in the good in people.

01:53:36.431 --> 01:53:38.311
All right, so I was a little naive.

01:53:39.332 --> 01:53:52.194
So he told me, no, this was again, probably the beginning of 2016, almost two years then, like, no, sorry, mid 16, mid 2016.

01:53:53.114 --> 01:53:54.475
So you're almost two years.

01:53:55.755 --> 01:53:59.856
And so he said, no, he wasn't gonna redirect any more, any of the donations.

01:53:59.956 --> 01:54:05.737
And I'm like, but we even have, you can even track the name of the person and you know how much they donated and send it to me.

01:54:06.934 --> 01:54:21.387
no i'm not gonna do it and i was like oh my god like holy smokes like this guy is in it for the money and that was my first reason but i still thought we were friends like i still thought you know

01:54:22.512 --> 01:54:28.837
I don't know, it was really important for me to have another friend in the movement at that time because there are so many attacks and there's so much pressure, right?

01:54:28.917 --> 01:54:31.619
And I thought it was supportive in some reason.

01:54:31.699 --> 01:54:36.983
Now I look back and I realize he was mining me for information and manipulating me to not turn against him.

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:39.405
And that's how it feels.

01:54:39.465 --> 01:54:47.551
You need to have the time to look back and reflect and to see how the pattern of behavior actually lines up in a malevolent way.

01:54:49.141 --> 01:54:53.685
When you're here in the middle of the timeline, you can't really see how bad these people are.

01:54:53.725 --> 01:55:04.594
But once you've had like five years experience with them, where you keep believing that most people are good and you keep being let down, you start to get an idea of what's going on.

01:55:04.634 --> 01:55:16.023
And that's why I feel like my message is so important because I'm one of the few people who's had the mental illness to stay focused on this for that long.

01:55:17.196 --> 01:55:28.531
the wherewithal to stay focused on this for that long, the belief in my own integrity to stay focused on this for this long, that despite all the discouragement and all the, you should move on.

01:55:32.639 --> 01:55:34.420
We're really in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:37.761
I'm gonna cut this stream short for now because it's already two hours.

01:55:38.221 --> 01:55:40.102
We have 81 people watching on Twitch.

01:55:40.142 --> 01:55:41.643
I thank you very much for joining me.

01:55:43.543 --> 01:55:49.046
I will also have another other, I might watch the rest of this in a subsequent study hall.

01:55:49.566 --> 01:55:58.510
I also have a Glenn Beck video of about 13 minutes queued up, which I think is important for you to hear and see how,

01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.891
spectacular.

01:56:00.931 --> 01:56:04.433
The Scooby-Doo mystery-solving exercise is still ongoing.

01:56:04.493 --> 01:56:05.474
It's still happening.

01:56:06.155 --> 01:56:18.724
And I also have this video from Erica Ullman-Sapphire from 2020 that I really want you to see because it's very insightful in terms of how people are talking and speaking about the pandemic.

01:56:19.464 --> 01:56:21.146
relative to how we think about it now.

01:56:21.526 --> 01:56:31.315
It's a really interesting sort of snapshot into what's going on again on the opposite side of the spectrum, whereas we were on the lab leak and all that other stuff.

01:56:31.735 --> 01:56:37.460
These people are on this is just natural and this is the way it was and we were ready for this with broad spectrum antibodies.

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:46.367
It's going to be a really good couple of days, couple of weeks now here as this flood of new information comes out as we start to explore people like Tony Bark.

01:56:47.428 --> 01:56:52.273
and others that were involved in this, you know, we don't have time for watered down messages.

01:56:52.493 --> 01:56:56.116
We don't have time to cut corners here.

01:56:56.196 --> 01:56:58.799
And yet we've been cutting corners for a decade now.

01:56:58.859 --> 01:57:10.209
And for the last five years, I think that we have been slowly titrating ourselves to a falsehood, a mythology about a mystery virus and about transfections.

01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:26.048
because of these people, these organizations, these sabotaged organizations that I think if Brandy was alive, if Tony Bark was alive, they would also say that these are all sabotaged organizations.

01:57:26.974 --> 01:57:30.195
because they all participated in the mystery of the Wuhan cover-up.

01:57:30.275 --> 01:57:39.319
And forcing us to participate in the mystery-solving exercise made the vast majority of us accept and teach our kids about a novel virus.

01:57:39.379 --> 01:57:47.623
And there's lots of reasons why these people went along with it, but it doesn't change the fact that they are all traitors to our grandchildren for making us solve this mystery.

01:57:48.263 --> 01:57:52.024
Please, ladies and gentlemen, see that the illusion of consensus is there.

01:57:52.884 --> 01:57:54.105
I don't know why those are repeating.

01:57:54.185 --> 01:57:54.885
I apologize.

01:57:54.945 --> 01:57:56.726
Injection versus injection.

01:57:56.826 --> 01:57:58.566
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:57:59.126 --> 01:58:02.767
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud.

01:58:03.148 --> 01:58:17.692
The only thing that they have is synthetic recombinant genetics, which means if they wanted to find a sequence, they could make it, and they could put it somewhere, and they could have their agent in Wuhan find it, and that would allow them a perfect excuse to transfect people to it.

01:58:18.292 --> 01:58:21.433
under the pretense of a investigational vaccine.

01:58:21.473 --> 01:58:32.275
And of course, to get away with that, they would just need to use placebo, because then they could make any manufacturing quota they needed to, and the vast majority of the safety signal would be invisible.

01:58:32.795 --> 01:58:47.578
The way they do this, this rule by mythology, is by instituting and teaching in our universities, on 60 Minutes, ideas like endemicity, and then have people like Peter Daszak, you know, the first author of Andrew Wakefield's paper,

01:58:50.407 --> 01:58:57.632
Peter Daszak run a USAID funded mythology show about viruses going endemic.

01:58:57.652 --> 01:59:05.076
You know, 1.7 million viruses waiting to go endemic instead of telling us about an infinite background that he's lying about.

01:59:05.637 --> 01:59:12.841
Instead of us telling us about the fundamental biology that really edifies the idea that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:59:13.182 --> 01:59:17.224
Talking about how non-specific PCR tests could be used against us.

01:59:17.284 --> 01:59:19.626
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb

01:59:20.166 --> 01:59:30.468
and Brandy Vaughn knew that and actually I think before Polly fully just sold out she also knew that because in that video

01:59:31.494 --> 01:59:35.397
She is saying that there are no good vaccines and if you've taken one, you are injured.

01:59:35.858 --> 01:59:50.910
Which of course is something that none of these people on Team Worst Case Scenario would ever dare say in 2025, despite Polly and Brandy Vaughn being willing to say it in 2016 while the Bax movie was opening.

01:59:50.970 --> 01:59:55.174
Ladies and gentlemen, if we forget the past, it will be erased.

01:59:56.109 --> 02:00:00.512
And then the eraser will be forgotten by our grandchildren and that lie will become the truth.

02:00:00.572 --> 02:00:03.033
That's the dangerous situation we are in right now.

02:00:03.494 --> 02:00:07.296
That's why I keep saying it's for all the marbles.

02:00:07.376 --> 02:00:10.578
And why I keep saying I'm gonna be here as often as I possibly can.

02:00:10.598 --> 02:00:12.019
I gotta go to the gym, ladies and gentlemen.

02:00:12.039 --> 02:00:13.540
There's basketballs that need shooting.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:18.323
If you wanna follow me, you can follow me at gigombiological.com.

02:00:18.363 --> 02:00:19.964
You can get a notification from Twitch.

02:00:20.404 --> 02:00:22.205
You can get a notification from...

02:00:23.706 --> 02:00:30.855
You can get a notification from YouTube now, although I didn't go on YouTube today, I will go on every other day.

02:00:30.875 --> 02:00:34.759
And you can also send an email to gigaohm...

02:00:37.524 --> 02:01:06.711
hq at proton let me just do the other slide i didn't replace the end slide with the beginning slide that i created in order to do this i'll just scroll back up here and start with this one instead um you can send a email to gigaohm at proton dot me gigaohm hq and if you put notify me in the subject um my wife will assemble a list of people that i will email as often as i possibly can when i know i'm gonna stream and so maybe we can get more and more people live

02:01:07.191 --> 02:01:10.453
and you can have an effective way of sharing the work as well.

02:01:11.193 --> 02:01:20.519
I can't thank everybody enough for taking the risk to support my stream and to support my work and I hope I'm not disappointing anybody as I continue to hammer on the same stones.

02:01:21.539 --> 02:01:23.861
I love you all very much and I will see you again tomorrow.

02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:27.811
Wow, why didn't I see that?

02:02:27.871 --> 02:02:29.672
I should be exiting with the Pontiac.

02:02:29.892 --> 02:02:32.214
Oh my gosh, what an idiot I am.

02:02:32.354 --> 02:02:35.076
Thank you for the feedback there, Troy Tree.

02:02:35.757 --> 02:02:38.979
Sometimes, you know, the obvious escapes you.

02:02:39.319 --> 02:02:40.240
I apologize for that.
