00:00.000 --> 00:28.960
16 minutes late, nice work.

00:28.960 --> 00:36.680
No equalizer, I'm going to be on at a certain time because I'm so accurate with my predictions.

00:36.680 --> 00:46.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, ladies and gentlemen, E.R. Carmidock, I have not seen that name

00:46.040 --> 00:48.840
in quite some time.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.880
Welcome to the show, E.R. Carmidock.

00:54.880 --> 01:05.800
Kim Christie, garden variety humanoid, Steph, Katniss, Deb, what's up?

01:05.800 --> 01:10.040
I got interrupted by a couple, rather difficult messages.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.040
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.840
Oh, timeout, JC on the bike.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.600
JC on the bike.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.560
It's JC on the bike.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.040
It's JC on the bike, yeah.

01:21.040 --> 01:21.560
Albert.

01:21.560 --> 01:28.600
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chomp needs banning, and I know just the one.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
Look at round.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
It's JC on the bike.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
That's really my...

01:31.600 --> 01:33.520
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

01:33.520 --> 01:39.360
It's my favorite endorsement.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
That's actually...

01:40.360 --> 01:41.360
That's really him.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.360
That's...

01:42.360 --> 01:48.000
That Z-Dog MD dressed up as Darth Vader telling JC on a bike that he's going to be banned

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
from his chat.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Because I was calling him out.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
It was pretty funny.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Ha-ha!

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
He's scheduled for 16 minutes next.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
This might get my...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
It's embarrassing.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
This might get my start-up bounce, too.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm not really sure how this is going to work, but we're going to do it anyway.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
It's a good song, and Nathan's funerals tomorrow, I'm not going because of things.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm going to play some tunes to alleviate a little bit of the thing.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
If you think it's a little bit cheesy because you don't like this kind of guitar music,

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
that's tough.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Nathan was a guitar teacher.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
This was...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, anyway.

02:48.000 --> 03:10.000
MUSIC

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Doesn't it feel like we're rocking about this hard right now?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Doesn't it feel like we're kicking this much ass?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It's because we are.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
MUSIC

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I'm sure of it.

03:24.000 --> 03:34.000
MUSIC

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
MUSIC

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
MUSIC

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
MUSIC

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
MUSIC

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
Oh, sorry about that.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
MUSIC

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
MUSIC

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Can't play this, I can't believe it.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
This is Eric Johnson, Cliffs of Dover.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Even if you could play it, you probably couldn't get the tone that this guy can get.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
It's pretty insane how often he's changing pedal effects and stuff in the mid-riff and stuff.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Nathan knew more about it than I did.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
He could just make me appreciated a little more when I listened to it.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
This guy also sings, and he's like listening to, what's that dude's name?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, it's terrible.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Oh, what was his name?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, no.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
But he's got a really bad voice.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm sorry, Eric Johnson, if you're watching my stream and you're a fan.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And so when he sings, it's really like, what was that guy's name?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh, my gosh.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
I know who I'm thinking of, and I can't think of it, but he's like this super cheesy singer.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And if you can play guitar this well, you should just not like, no.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Stevie Rayvon could sing, but you know, Eric just should play.

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
Anyway, just another musical start for my friend Nathan, who passed away last Sunday

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
from an aneurysm at 49.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
It's a rather odd occurrence, but these odd occurrences are happening more and more often.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
And although we can't attribute cause to any of these things because a lot of times the family

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
and friends and people around and everybody doesn't want to.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I think at some point the numbers are going to keep tallying up and there's going to

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
be a signal that's going to need to be to be rationalized and addressed.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So anyway, that's where we are right now.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
We're trying to still crack the same Scooby-Doo narrative.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.400
I really do believe that it's worth playing a song like that because I do think we are

06:26.400 --> 06:27.400
making a lot of progress.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.400
I think there's a lot of scrambling going on behind the scenes to try and figure out what to do

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
about this.

06:32.400 --> 06:37.400
And the most likely scenario is they're going to try and absorb most of it as quickly as they possibly

06:37.400 --> 06:39.400
can and say, oh my goodness, look at this.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.400
It really was kind of a show.

06:42.400 --> 06:51.400
And as long as we don't really creep all the way to questioning the actual existence of a

06:51.400 --> 06:56.400
spreading pathogen that killed millions and millions more were saved from, I think they're

06:56.400 --> 07:00.400
still going to have to preserve the faith.

07:00.400 --> 07:09.400
So what I really want to do in honor of my friend is make sure that it's very clear that we

07:09.400 --> 07:12.400
can't blame any of these people for making this choice.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.400
No matter how good of friends we were, no matter how long that we've known each other, no matter

07:18.400 --> 07:26.400
how long, what we've been through or how many times we've been there for each other.

07:26.400 --> 07:36.400
The assault that was executed on us psychologically in 2020 was unprecedented.

07:36.400 --> 07:46.400
And it was, it was preceded by years and years of programming, ladies and gentlemen, you're

07:46.400 --> 07:50.400
not aware of it, but you were aware of it because people have made you aware of it because

07:50.400 --> 07:54.400
at the start of the pandemic it was kind of a running joke that the Simpsons had made a

07:54.400 --> 08:01.400
joke about pandemic potential in the boxes of Amazon that the X files had made a joke about

08:01.400 --> 08:09.400
laboratory leaks that caused your blood to clot and that altered your genes.

08:09.400 --> 08:16.400
And planet of the apes, the new version starts with a with a zoonosis that was created by

08:16.400 --> 08:24.400
a laboratory leak of a Alzheimer's cure virus that was genetically created and wipes out

08:24.400 --> 08:27.400
humanity.

08:27.400 --> 08:33.400
And so you have been, whether you like it or not, slowly but surely given the idea that

08:33.400 --> 08:40.400
this pandemic potential is real, that this bio weapon laboratory leak is possible, and

08:40.400 --> 08:46.400
then with a very elaborate theater starting in 2019 at the end of that year and running up into

08:46.400 --> 08:53.400
the start of the pandemic, there was a very coordinated effort to cash in on that, to

08:53.400 --> 08:58.400
checkmate on that.

08:58.400 --> 09:03.400
It cannot be underestimated how important all of these people behind the scenes were as they

09:03.400 --> 09:09.400
seeded the worst case scenario during 2020.

09:09.400 --> 09:14.400
And I've been trying to make that argument that, you know, we've been on this dark, long ride

09:14.400 --> 09:18.400
for a very long time and the driver in the car has been reassuring us that everything is

09:18.400 --> 09:24.400
going to be fine. Just don't panic. I'll get us out of this

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
and explaining to us along the way why we're seeing what we're seeing and what we're experiencing

09:28.400 --> 09:33.400
means. And they have been lying to us.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.400
And not only the driver, but the person over in the passenger seat that's telling us to be

09:37.400 --> 09:42.400
patient and the person that's sitting next to us that's, that's pretending to also question

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
where are they taking us?

09:44.400 --> 09:50.400
But in reality, the person that's in the backseat pretending to have a secret conversation

09:50.400 --> 09:56.400
with you about the driver and the passenger is actually working with the driver and the

09:56.400 --> 10:01.400
passenger to make you stay in the car and not panic and think that the only person you have

10:01.400 --> 10:03.400
to worry about is the driver.

10:03.400 --> 10:10.400
And since you first met the driver, your, your app to first trust the driver, but the, the

10:10.400 --> 10:16.400
passenger is very charming and the person sitting next to you is obviously your friend.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
That's how they've got us.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.400
And they did that with social media because you were forced to stay home with your family

10:22.400 --> 10:28.400
and friends. And the real question is, can we look back and see really how they did it?

10:28.400 --> 10:34.400
Can, is it that easy? Could we just look back in a video and listen to someone tell us

10:34.400 --> 10:40.400
succinctly the mythology that they wanted us to believe that they used to keep us in our

10:40.400 --> 10:45.400
houses? Where would we have to go? I think around March of 2020 we would need to go to

10:45.400 --> 10:49.400
find where this illusion of consensus was ceded.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.400
We would have to look for a person.

10:53.400 --> 10:59.400
And it would be crazy if it was a person that was still involved in this illusion of

10:59.400 --> 11:05.400
consensus about a novel virus to be crazy if it was Robert Malone or, or Nurse Aaron or

11:05.400 --> 11:09.400
if any of those were involved in ceding this in 2020.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.400
Nurse Aaron was a little bit involved and Robert Malone was behind the scenes working

11:13.400 --> 11:21.400
EUAs and, you know, getting the final touches on the vaccine fill and finish technologies

11:21.400 --> 11:23.400
this kind of thing.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.400
So he was nowhere to be found at the beginning of 2020 in the middle of 2020 the end of

11:28.400 --> 11:32.400
2020 when the real worst case scenario needed to be ceded.

11:32.400 --> 11:38.400
I wonder who else might have been around then though.

11:38.400 --> 11:45.400
Remember, we needed to, we needed to convince everybody that there was a train to stop.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.400
We needed to convince everybody that there was a train that needed stopping.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.400
And that if we did the things that they suggested that the train would stop safely.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.400
That was the warning. Who gave us that warning?

11:59.400 --> 12:03.400
I found an example of one person giving us this warning.

12:03.400 --> 12:12.400
An expert Dr. Steven Hatfield speaks out about coronavirus and COVID-19 on March 20th, 2020,

12:12.400 --> 12:15.400
March 20th, 2020.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.400
I think this is a pretty pertinent video to watch because, as you know,

12:20.400 --> 12:26.400
Steven Hatfield, Hatfield caught my attention after streaming multiple times on the Tommy podcast,

12:26.400 --> 12:31.400
which I find one of the biggest comical jokes of all of recent American history.

12:31.400 --> 12:37.400
And so the idea that he's appeared multiple times on that podcast, along with Robert Malone,

12:37.400 --> 12:41.400
is just, it is really just waving it in our face.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.400
So I thought it would be good to start with this guy as a landmark.

12:45.400 --> 12:51.400
Despite his controversial past, he's considered to be a bio-weapons expert.

12:51.400 --> 12:57.400
Despite having a maybe PhD, but for sure a couple of masters degrees,

12:57.400 --> 13:04.400
and at MD, he has been a pretty controversial dude in the background for a very long time.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
And I don't need to go into that.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.400
Lots of other people have.

13:07.400 --> 13:11.400
So let's just listen to what he's got to say at the beginning of the pandemic.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.400
And for the most part, I'm going to try to take notes because it is 43 minutes long.

13:15.400 --> 13:21.400
I'm not going to play it fast because I think slow with Steve is the best.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.400
So some Steve's were piling it high and deep.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
Some of them were piling it really high and really deep.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.400
Physician, virologist, and biological warfare defense specialist,

13:32.400 --> 13:38.400
Dr. Stephen Hatfield is here to tell us everything we need to know about this new coronavirus,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.400
COVID-19, and its intrusion into our daily lives.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
Thank you for joining us, Dr. Hatfield.

13:43.400 --> 13:49.400
As a wife, mother, and daughter of older parents, I am filled with gratitude that you have joined us today.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
My privilege.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
Thank you.

13:51.400 --> 13:57.400
Can you clarify for us what the contagious period is on coronavirus,

13:57.400 --> 14:02.400
on this new disease that the world has never seen before?

14:02.400 --> 14:07.400
It's variable depending on the individual that's been affected.

14:07.400 --> 14:11.400
Normally with these things, and I don't have the data to show this yet,

14:11.400 --> 14:15.400
but normally in these things, if little kids get infected,

14:15.400 --> 14:18.400
they secrete a lot of virus into the environment.

14:18.400 --> 14:23.400
Now we don't know what the coronavirus yet, if this is the case.

14:23.400 --> 14:33.400
But for an adult, you're infectious, we believe, at least 24 hours before you have any symptoms.

14:33.400 --> 14:41.400
So you've gone to work, you're secreting live virus into the environment around you.

14:41.400 --> 14:47.400
You go home, you're not filling all that jolly, maybe a headache,

14:47.400 --> 14:50.400
maybe a slight sore throat.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.400
You may even get up and go into work the next day.

14:54.400 --> 14:59.400
And then you really start filling lousy.

14:59.400 --> 15:04.400
In some people, they've been infectious throughout that prodromal period.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Prodromal.

15:05.400 --> 15:10.400
Prodrom, that sounds like something that Giordano said.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
So did you hear it all?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
It was bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

15:14.400 --> 15:20.400
She mentioned at the very beginning as a mom and a parent or whatever,

15:20.400 --> 15:29.400
and the daughter of older parents, that's the first, that's the first, you know,

15:29.400 --> 15:34.400
ooh, they've got to watch out for our old people, got to isolate or keep our old people safe.

15:34.400 --> 15:41.400
The second thing she said was the world has never seen before, this virus that the world has never seen before.

15:41.400 --> 15:47.400
Another one of the faith, you know, tenements, excuse me.

15:47.400 --> 15:52.400
Little kids secrete a lot of virus into their environment.

15:52.400 --> 15:58.400
And he said secreting live virus a few times, I noticed people in the chat also saw this.

15:58.400 --> 16:04.400
So it's really good, it's already amazing, we're not even like one minute 37 seconds in it.

16:04.400 --> 16:13.400
They were probably infected several days before.

16:13.400 --> 16:20.400
You see, when you're infected, the virus has to gain a foothold in your body.

16:20.400 --> 16:30.400
And you don't really feel it as this is starting, but once you reach a certain number of cells that are inside your body

16:30.400 --> 16:40.400
in your nose or your airway that are infected, then of course you start, they're secreted out into the environment.

16:40.400 --> 16:46.400
So incubation period is referring to the time you were exposed to the virus.

16:46.400 --> 16:56.400
You either inhaled it or you touched a contaminated surface and rubbed the mucous membranes of your eye or nose or mouth.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.400
And the time that you start to have overt symptoms.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.400
So this is a strategy for the virus.

17:03.400 --> 17:11.400
It's not alive, it's just a collection of proteins and nucleic acids with a fat envelope around it.

17:11.400 --> 17:16.400
But it behaves as if it's alive, it can mutate, it can change.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.400
It's nature's ultimate parasite.

17:19.400 --> 17:25.400
It can't even reproduce unless it infects a human cell or an animal cell.

17:26.400 --> 17:31.400
And hijacks its molecular machinery to make copies of itself.

17:31.400 --> 17:36.400
I mean, that's spectacular, right? That's almost like he's reading it right out of a book.

17:36.400 --> 17:41.400
It hijacks the cellular machinery to make copies of itself.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.400
And so kudos to the no-virus people.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.400
They're totally right on the idea that the infectious cycle is complete hogwash.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.400
It's not been proven and it's not been shown.

17:51.400 --> 17:58.400
And we have lots of consistent evidence over the years that something very different happens when these RNA species are present.

17:58.400 --> 18:04.400
It's not alive, but it behaves like the ultimate parasite.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.400
Do you say ultimate parasite?

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
It's nature's ultimate parasite.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
Yeah, the ultimate parasite.

18:11.400 --> 18:20.400
So parasite is a word that I would suggest should only be ascribed to real complex pattern integrities that we can also call species.

18:20.400 --> 18:25.400
So again, here is where this mythology is definitely being applied, right?

18:25.400 --> 18:31.400
This is real viral mythology that they are parasites.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.400
And he said exposed to the virus.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
He said secreted out.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
He said it needs to gain a foothold.

18:38.400 --> 18:43.400
And you say you really don't feel it.

18:43.400 --> 18:49.400
He used the word prodrome too, so this is already laying down this idea that you're never going to know if you have it.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.400
You don't feel it in those first couple of days, so it introduces this asymptomatic spread.

18:53.400 --> 18:59.400
This same thing that Giordado described.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
I mean, it's incredible, really.

19:01.400 --> 19:13.400
It can't even reproduce unless it infects a human cell or an animal cell and hijacks its molecular machinery to make copies of itself.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
The ultimate freeloader.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.400
The ultimate freeloader.

19:19.400 --> 19:31.400
If someone in a household is diagnosed and they've already been interacting, are the members of the house already exposed based on what you just said about the contagious period?

19:31.400 --> 19:35.400
And does isolation even make a difference at that point?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
That's a good question.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Have they been exposed?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
Yes, most definitely.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.400
The whole family's been exposed.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.400
Will they develop an actual active infection?

19:47.400 --> 19:51.400
It's subject to a couple of other different factors.

19:51.400 --> 19:57.400
Have the children, but you need a certain amount of virus to establish an infection.

19:57.400 --> 20:07.400
If you've not had those number of viral particles, and it varies from virus to virus, you make it a subclinical infection.

20:07.400 --> 20:12.400
Notice the messages that are there on the side of the screen here.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.400
You need a certain amount of virus to be infected.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.400
So they're really teaching the mythology right now.

20:18.400 --> 20:29.400
They're teaching the basics so you can understand how this new cause of death works.

20:29.400 --> 20:41.400
And this scared people into behaving the way that they behaved and to conforming to wearing masks so that everybody else looked around and saw this illusion of consensus that there was a spreading dangerous pathogen for which.

20:41.400 --> 20:49.400
Certain countermeasures worked, including eventually an mRNA shot.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.400
It seems to be killing a lot of people.

20:52.400 --> 21:00.400
Body quickly fights it off, and you're immune, and you don't even know you were exposed.

21:00.400 --> 21:10.400
But for communicability and public health, we have to assume, yeah, you've got it and you could be in what we call the incubation period.

21:11.400 --> 21:15.400
So at that point, does isolation make a difference?

21:15.400 --> 21:24.400
Does one member of the household need to isolate from the other members of the household?

21:24.400 --> 21:27.400
Person to person contact.

21:27.400 --> 21:33.400
And the way this virus works when it's created into the environment.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.400
It's the individual's coughing.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.400
It's released as droplets.

21:41.400 --> 21:46.400
But some of those droplets are small particles in a size.

21:46.400 --> 21:52.400
It's incredibly small. It behaves as a gas. It's one to five microns in diameter.

21:52.400 --> 21:58.400
And it can stay suspended in the air for a couple hours.

21:58.400 --> 22:05.400
If their hands were contaminated and they touch a surface, there is no three-second rule in medicine.

22:05.400 --> 22:12.400
It's an instant viral transfer if somebody else touches that surface and then rubs their eye or their mouth.

22:12.400 --> 22:18.400
So it's not just the patient. It's the surfaces and everything around them.

22:18.400 --> 22:25.400
What we do if an individual's infected, it's essential that we go by and do case contact tracing.

22:25.400 --> 22:34.400
And that is everyone in the outside world that they've come in contact with and their family at home, we quarantine them.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
Wow, you're that?

22:36.400 --> 22:40.400
And we're sure that they didn't pick up an active infection.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.400
Jeez, come on.

22:42.400 --> 22:50.400
Could you briefly tell us why the world needs virologists right now and how they are critical to the containment effort of coronavirus?

22:50.400 --> 22:56.400
Well, beginning around the mid-1990s. Something unusual began happening in the world.

22:56.400 --> 23:04.400
And this was the appearance of brand new infectious diseases that science, medicine, have never seen before.

23:04.400 --> 23:12.400
This has been an increasing phenomena. We're now getting one to two new infections every year.

23:12.400 --> 23:19.400
And it's a result of man's high density and expansion throughout the globe.

23:19.400 --> 23:26.400
Here we go. It's a phenomena that's going to continue into the 21st century.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.400
Dang, that is so incredible.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
Thank you for sharing that.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
Thank you for sharing that.

23:32.400 --> 23:43.400
We're talking about isolation in a home. What people are speaking about is actually isolating the entire household, not just one member of the house.

23:43.400 --> 23:49.400
Here we go. What do we mean when we say isolation?

23:49.400 --> 24:01.400
Yeah, essentially. And this is why if we don't have a test available, then we have to do it.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
Is somebody writing cue cards for him right now?

24:04.400 --> 24:11.400
That's keep them quarantined until the incubation period has had time to pass.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.400
It looks like he's reading something.

24:13.400 --> 24:21.400
And this is difficult for a new virus because we may not be certain just how long this incubation period is.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.400
Some of these things can be up to a month later.

24:24.400 --> 24:30.400
I think the coronavirus is roughly around 21 days now, if I'm not mistaken.

24:30.400 --> 24:40.400
14, possibly as short as five to seven days sometimes for incubation.

24:40.400 --> 24:45.400
Well, there's a number of factors. Some of these we don't really understand yet.

24:45.400 --> 24:56.400
But until we can do testing and certify them that they haven't been exposed, then you have to keep them away from others.

24:56.400 --> 25:05.400
Now that so many people are actually self-quarantining due to the states of emergency around the country and more and more people are ordering their supplies from Amazon.

25:05.400 --> 25:12.400
They're groceries and how safe are we to pick up those bags and those packages off of our doorsteps?

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
The Simpsons episode.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.400
As we reach out and pick up those bags and packages.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
You need a certain amount of virus to infect you.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.400
About 500 viral particles.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.400
Oh, he knows the numbers.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.400
He knows the number.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.400
If that bag has been out.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.400
500 viral particles.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
500 viral particles is what you need.

25:36.400 --> 25:46.400
So now that we have a rough idea, is it 500 infectious particles or is it 500 of all the particles or 500?

25:46.400 --> 25:47.400
Oh my gosh.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
Wow.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
500 particles, he said.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
He said 500 particles.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
With pryons, you only need one particle.

25:55.400 --> 26:00.400
Mark, he only need one, one, one, one particle.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.400
You need 500 of these viruses.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.400
I mean these are nothing compared to pryons.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.400
Pryons, you only need one.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.400
But these, you got to have like 500.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.400
Come on.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
Shit.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.400
For very, very briefly, that virus is dead.

26:14.400 --> 26:19.400
The ultraviolet light and sunlight destroys its genetic material.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.400
It welds it together.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.400
So it's non-functional.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.400
Wow, it welds it together.

26:26.400 --> 26:31.400
Being outside the body is in a natural state for any virus.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.400
There's somebody was in the background of that room going, oh my god, he said that welds it together.

26:35.400 --> 26:39.400
Like, oh no, he said.

26:39.400 --> 26:46.400
It can tolerate it or airborne transmitted viruses can tolerate it for a short period of time.

26:46.400 --> 26:52.400
But the minute the virus leaves the body, there's a lot of things that start working against it.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.400
The oxygen in the atmosphere rusts it like it rusts metal.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.400
It oxidizes.

26:58.400 --> 27:03.400
I thought the fear and cleavage site made it more transmissible than any other virus in human history.

27:03.400 --> 27:08.400
So doesn't the, doesn't the fear and cleavage site protect it from sunlight?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
That's a better part of the virus.

27:10.400 --> 27:19.400
The humidity in the hair exerts a pressure on the virus, an osmotic pressure, that makes it want to fall apart.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.400
Wow.

27:20.400 --> 27:25.400
So that said, some viruses are pretty good at staying alive.

27:25.400 --> 27:33.400
This coronavirus on a non-porous surface can stay viable for up to nine days.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
Wow.

27:34.400 --> 27:42.400
Now, that's not the ideal way of transmission, the ideal way for a virus is to inhale it.

27:42.400 --> 27:46.400
Because you're in a safe home right away.

27:46.400 --> 28:03.400
But this has to be kept in mind, when we're nursing a patient at home, you have to take bare-air precautions and steps to ensure that the rest of the family is infected.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.400
Would bags and packages be considered non-porous surfaces?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
Holy shit.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.400
Well, the paper's porous.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.400
All papers are porous.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.400
Marble.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
Tabletop.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.400
That's non-porous.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.400
He's got a marble desk.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
Plastic cutting board.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
Marble desk.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
He's a beast, man.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
Marble desk.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
I have a marble desk.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
And simple disinfection.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.400
You can't see it, but I got a marble desk here.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.400
It doesn't have to be fancy soap and water wool.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.400
Oh, soap and water?

28:36.400 --> 28:37.400
Hydrogen peroxide.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
Rubbing alcohol.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.400
Wow.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.400
This sounds like a real like.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.400
That people are taking in their homes actually do make a difference.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.400
It is an audition, I think.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.400
Yes.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.400
Yes, ma'am.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.400
Absolutely.

28:48.400 --> 28:55.400
If you've got a little one that's sick, they're sort of confined to their room.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.400
If that's even possible.

28:58.400 --> 29:04.400
And when you go in, you have to take certain measures that you need to wear an apron.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.400
Full-length apron.

29:05.400 --> 29:13.400
And have flip-flops that you leave in the room and constantly wiping the surfaces down with

29:13.400 --> 29:18.400
a disinfected Purell or an apron or alcohol.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.400
Oh.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.400
And you really have to take some measures.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.400
And if you can get a mask onto the little one,

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
it helps to reduce the contamination.

29:28.400 --> 29:34.400
They'll cough, but the cough doesn't get out through the mask very well.

29:34.400 --> 29:38.400
And using the toilet.

29:38.400 --> 29:44.400
Unfortunately, in the stool, there's a lot of virus from an infected patient.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.400
So they need to use their own bathroom.

29:47.400 --> 29:52.400
Oh, only rich people can get rid of the coronavirus then because if you...

29:52.400 --> 29:56.400
If you flush the toilet, you generate a little invisible aerosol.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.400
Oh, my gosh.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
You got to have your own bathroom.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.400
You go to the hospital and they say, well, you're not sick enough.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.400
Take the child home.

30:06.400 --> 30:13.400
Well, you have to make sure the rest of the family don't get infected as well.

30:13.400 --> 30:19.400
And with little ones, they can, as you know, they can be quite difficult sometimes.

30:19.400 --> 30:26.400
So what I would like to start seeing on TV is that purple dinosaur that's so irritating.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.400
Wearing a mask.

30:28.400 --> 30:37.400
Or Elmo wearing a mask because you take your kids in for their shots, the immunizations.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.400
And they don't like masks.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.400
They don't like doctors, you know.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.400
And now everybody's wearing a mask.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.400
It's scary for them.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.400
So it's a good idea to get them used to this.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
Wow.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
You know, masks are fun.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
Right?

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
Let me put one on you.

30:56.400 --> 31:11.400
I'm sorry, but he is an eminent bioweapons expert with experience from Ebola with experience from anthrax.

31:11.400 --> 31:24.400
This guy knows exactly the physics around a coronavirus given the cartoon drawing on the blueprint.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.400
And this is just dark.

31:26.400 --> 31:33.400
Everything that he said up until now, 13 minutes into this is just dark.

31:33.400 --> 31:40.400
On the 20th of March, 2020, we just started the 15 days to slow the spread.

31:40.400 --> 31:46.400
And this guy is contributing this.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.400
We don't know with this virus, but we know.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.400
We don't know with this virus, but we know.

31:51.400 --> 32:00.400
He got to wear an apron and a mask and some flip-flops and sterilize everything all and disinfect everything all the time.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.400
Kids shed a lot of virus.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
I want to see Barney wearing a mask.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.400
I want to see Elmo wearing a mask.

32:09.400 --> 32:16.400
This is not just some guy making a judgment call based on his years of experience.

32:16.400 --> 32:21.400
This is a bioweapons insider ceding the worst-case scenario.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.400
The fear that why would they tell you this if it wasn't real?

32:25.400 --> 32:32.400
Why would they tell you this if they didn't think the worst-case scenario was possible?

32:32.400 --> 32:41.400
Why would they tell me this if I wasn't supposed to play along with this Scooby-Doo?

32:41.400 --> 32:46.400
Now, a lot of my friends are very, very smart, but not a lot of them are biologists.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.400
They're not going to be able to see through this.

32:49.400 --> 32:59.400
I'm not even sure in May of 2020 that I would have seen through this.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.400
In fact, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have.

33:02.400 --> 33:09.400
But this would have been proof to me that this was certainly a lab leak and they were definitely lying about it.

33:09.400 --> 33:16.400
And in case you're wondering, Stephen Hatfield at this time said that there was absolutely no question this was not a lab leak.

33:16.400 --> 33:22.400
This is just a natural occurrence that happens because there's too many people on the planet.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.400
Wow!

33:26.400 --> 33:29.400
These things have to have to happen.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.400
We need to normalize the things that happen.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.400
You need to normalize it.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
Exactly.

33:36.400 --> 33:44.400
And when we brought Freddie to the day, what was going to be preschool when she was four, which I guess was the,

33:44.400 --> 33:51.400
would have been the fall of 21.

33:52.400 --> 33:56.400
The fall of 21, we asked, you know, are they going to be wearing masks?

33:56.400 --> 33:58.400
And she said, yeah, we all are going to wear masks.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.400
And I said, well, what are we bringing her here for then?

34:00.400 --> 34:09.400
She's supposed to learn how to interact with other kids and other adults and learn facial expressions and learn to speak and learn to trust another adult.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.400
That's not going to work with masks on all the time.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.400
And she said, no, no, they get used to it after about two weeks.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.400
You know, they don't like it for a while, but after about two weeks, they really get used to it.

34:19.400 --> 34:25.400
And I said, you know, they would get used to not wearing underwear on their bottoms, but wearing underwear on their heads.

34:25.400 --> 34:30.400
If you did it for two weeks straight, they would probably all come in and take off their underwear and put it on their heads themselves.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.400
That doesn't make it right.

34:34.400 --> 34:42.400
And most people, skilled TV watching people who get told that this is a danger, this is what you've got to do to keep your grandparents safe.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.400
Most TV watching people are going to do that.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.400
And they knew that.

34:48.400 --> 34:58.400
They've looked into the camera and said it earlier in 2009 and 2002 in 1976.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.400
It's all about the messaging.

35:01.400 --> 35:07.400
And so don't think for one second that this guy's improvising off of the cuff about what he thinks will happen.

35:07.400 --> 35:18.400
This is a very careful curated list of things in order to imply that the worst case scenario is definitely possible right now.

35:18.400 --> 35:26.400
We don't want to panic anybody, but you know, you should wear an apron when you go into your sick kid's room for the first time ever.

35:26.400 --> 35:34.400
You should wear a mask around your child. You should wear flip flops in their room so that you don't track out the nasty.

35:34.400 --> 35:41.400
It's an extraordinary mythology that he's laying down right now and think about who he is.

35:41.400 --> 35:48.400
He got a $5 million settlement for being wrongfully accused of being the anthrax leaker.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.400
But what really happened was that the FBI leaked it.

35:52.400 --> 36:03.400
Leaked the details that they knew that he had bought Sipro or had been prescribed Sipro a few days before the anthrax leak.

36:03.400 --> 36:10.400
And Sipro being the let's say preferred antibiotic to use against anthrax.

36:10.400 --> 36:17.400
It was just a little weird, but his doctor said it was because he had a sinus infection.

36:17.400 --> 36:24.400
And so the FBI put him on a list of suspects because he had access to it and he did this weird thing three days before.

36:24.400 --> 36:29.400
And then when it got out, as far as I understand, he said that it ruined his life.

36:29.400 --> 36:35.400
And so he sued the government and got $5 million, something like this. Look it up on Wikipedia.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.400
I mean, at some point, we're just going to have to call a spade a spade. That sounds like a spook to me.

36:44.400 --> 36:52.400
That sounds like a beautiful way to get a guy off and make it really, really, really awesome.

36:52.400 --> 36:59.400
Meanwhile, Bruce Ivan's the Christian kills himself.

36:59.400 --> 37:11.400
And now here he is years later, right where we need him, reading off cue cards that people are writing.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.400
I don't know, we'll see. Maybe he pauses a few more times to read.

37:15.400 --> 37:24.400
And detune him because if there's too much new things happening, the little ones, they don't know what's going on and they get scared.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.400
He's really worried about the kids.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
Wonderful advice. Thank you.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
Wonderful advice.

37:28.400 --> 37:37.400
So it is possible if we are careful to care for our loved ones without getting infected ourselves.

37:37.400 --> 37:42.400
You can. You need some equipment. You need some common sense.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.400
Some equipment and common sense.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.400
You're not going to put a whole trash bag over your head.

37:47.400 --> 37:56.400
But this disposable thing is not a good idea when everything is manufactured overseas.

37:56.400 --> 38:02.400
Now, great steps are being taken to bring a lot of this critical stuff back to American soil.

38:02.400 --> 38:08.400
Because essentially, it's a matter of national defense being able to handle an epidemic disease.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.400
People are taking this extremely seriously.

38:12.400 --> 38:18.400
Can carry the virus on your clothing and on the soles of your shoes.

38:18.400 --> 38:29.400
Well, the soles of the shoes, especially on the clothing, if it's an aerosol droplet, once it touches the material, it'll kind of bind to the material.

38:29.400 --> 38:33.400
So as long as you're not flapping your coat and everything, you're fine.

38:33.400 --> 38:45.400
But the minute you come home, you need to very gently jump into something else and that needs to carefully go to the washing.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.400
Soap and water will kill this thing right away.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.400
I don't even know.

38:52.400 --> 39:00.400
He said, can the virus be on my clothes and on the bottom of my shoes?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
And he said, yes, on the bottom of your shoes.

39:02.400 --> 39:10.400
Well, the soles of the shoes, especially on the clothing, if it's an aerosol droplet, once it touches the material.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.400
Maybe the Chinese knew that it was passed on the bottom of the shoes.

39:13.400 --> 39:20.400
And that's why at the earlier part of the pandemic, they started, like, instead of handshaking, they started to touch each other's feet so that they would pass.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
It'll kind of bind to the material.

39:23.400 --> 39:28.400
As long as you're not flapping your coat and everything, you're fine.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.400
But the minute you come home, you need to.

39:31.400 --> 39:35.400
Don't shake your coat, Jay, you'll get virus everywhere.

39:35.400 --> 39:43.400
Very gently jump into something else and that needs to carefully go to the washing.

39:43.400 --> 39:47.400
You're taking your clothes off way too fast, you're getting virus everywhere.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.400
Will you please do that by the door?

39:50.400 --> 39:52.400
I'm telling you, your grandma needs protecting.

39:52.400 --> 39:57.400
The soap and water will kill this thing right away, one cycle.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.400
And take your shoes off at the door.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.400
Okay, very, very important.

40:02.400 --> 40:07.400
Wow, take your shoes off at the door.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.400
We're not removing your shoes at the door.

40:11.400 --> 40:17.400
It's good to know that even you don't always follow the advice.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.400
We're all in this together, aren't we?

40:21.400 --> 40:24.400
We're all in this together.

40:24.400 --> 40:29.400
It's worse for me because I know what's happening.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.400
This lap of his.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.400
In terms of our children and our little ones.

40:36.400 --> 40:40.400
Our kids, as you were saying, it's hard to keep them indoors.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.400
It's hard to keep them quarantine their room if they're not feeling well.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.400
If other family members are not feeling well.

40:47.400 --> 40:54.400
Is there a safe way to let our children play outside to play on the playgrounds to go to

40:54.400 --> 41:00.400
the park without exposing them to the virus?

41:00.400 --> 41:03.400
One, you can teach them.

41:03.400 --> 41:06.400
If they touch something, disinfect their hands.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.400
Oh my gosh.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.400
You may get a game.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.400
I can disinfect my hands quicker than you.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
Oh, it sounds like a fun game, Uncle Stephen.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.400
Can we play?

41:18.400 --> 41:21.400
If they're outside, they're fine.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.400
Again, sunlight kills this virus.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.400
And humidity also.

41:27.400 --> 41:32.400
It's when you're indoors in a controlled environment that's a dehumidified.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.400
And temperature control very precisely.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.400
No swings of temperature.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.400
It uses like inside a hospital.

41:41.400 --> 41:47.400
Where the virus has, you know, it's kind of a nice home to be.

41:47.400 --> 41:51.400
So outdoors, things are a little rough.

41:51.400 --> 41:58.400
And on the playground outdoors, stay in your distance from other classmates.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.400
Wow.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.400
Never touching your face while you're outside.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.400
Don't touch the face.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.400
And disinfecting your hands.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
And give me some more of that gel.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
Oh, wow.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.400
Stay away from those adults.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
You don't get away with that.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.400
Wonderful.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.400
Wonderful.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
The sunny days are the best.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.400
Sunny days.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Oh, for everybody.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
Everybody likes.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.400
For all of us.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.400
Even a big, mean guy like Steven Hetfield.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.400
Viruses don't like sunlight.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
That's fantastic information.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
Thank you so much.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
Vampires don't like sunlight either.

42:32.400 --> 42:38.400
If a child does touch their face, can the virus enter through the mouth, the nose, and the

42:38.400 --> 42:39.400
eyes?

42:39.400 --> 42:46.400
There was a recent paper from a Chinese doctor.

42:46.400 --> 42:49.400
And we know this is the case in influenza.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
Now, it's a different virus.

42:51.400 --> 42:56.400
But the eye is actually a major target for entry into the body.

42:57.400 --> 43:02.400
And there's some evidence now indicating that COVID-19 virus.

43:02.400 --> 43:07.400
That if it's on your hands and it's been a reasonable.

43:07.400 --> 43:12.400
See, the messaging is still not tight yet because he's got somebody in his room telling him it's

43:12.400 --> 43:15.400
the COVID-19 virus, not SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 is the disease.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.400
But they'll get it straight in a few days.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.400
Short time frame since it was released from someone.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.400
And you rub your eye.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.400
And if there's enough virus, if it's heavily enough.

43:27.400 --> 43:31.400
I was putting pepper on my fingers so that if I rubbed my eye, I would know it.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.400
And it would train me so that I would never put my fingers in my eye again.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.400
That was my solution for it.

43:36.400 --> 43:40.400
But then my food was spicy all the time and it got on other places.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.400
And so that didn't work very well.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.400
Contaminated your hands.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.400
Well, you just rubbed your eye.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.400
Your eye is constantly making tears.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.400
You don't know it, but you're constantly making tears.

43:54.400 --> 44:00.400
And it drains through this little duck called the nasal lacrimal duck straight into your

44:00.400 --> 44:01.400
noggin there.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
Did somebody put that in the chat?

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
So within about 30 minutes from touching your eye.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
That was pretty good.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.400
You have live virus inside your nose.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
Wow.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
That's impressive.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.400
From there it gets into the back of the throat.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.400
And from there it gets into your lungs.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
Unbelievable.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
What a highway to have.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
You have to have a certain amount of virus.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
At 500 particles.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.400
Touching a heavily contaminated surface.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.400
There's enough viral particles to do.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.400
We think about 500, 600.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
Oh, it could be 600.

44:32.400 --> 44:37.400
Viral particles are the minimum amount that it needs to cause a human infection.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.400
Wow.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.400
Just to make sure everybody's aware with prions, you only need one.

44:41.400 --> 44:46.400
Just one prion protein and you could be, you know,

44:47.400 --> 44:50.400
with coronavirus it's a little bit more.

44:50.400 --> 44:55.400
It's between 500 and 600 particles and then you're really in trouble.

44:55.400 --> 45:01.400
Which is good for us because some viruses like Ebola, it's only one or one to seven

45:01.400 --> 45:04.400
viral particles can cause an infection.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.400
Wow.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
I didn't know that.

45:06.400 --> 45:10.400
Ebola must be an infectious clone where it's really pure.

45:10.400 --> 45:15.400
It takes about a thousand viral particles.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.400
Who?

45:16.400 --> 45:17.400
What?

45:17.400 --> 45:20.400
Influenza takes about a thousand viral particles.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.400
Wow.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
I got to remember these numbers.

45:22.400 --> 45:23.400
This is pretty cool.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.400
One to seven.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
Yeah.

45:26.400 --> 45:35.400
And five to six hundred for coronavirus.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.400
So coffee etiquette in public.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.400
A thousand is very important and people don't do it.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
Coffee etiquette.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.400
I mean, you need to cough into the crook of your arm.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.400
Oh.

45:47.400 --> 45:48.400
Like that.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.400
But I thought we had masks on.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.400
You try to minimize any large droplet transmission.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
You won't stop the small particles.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.400
No.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.400
Those are hard to bear.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
But you'll stop the large part.

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
They're like a gas.

45:58.400 --> 46:04.400
Staying within preferably six feet if somebody's coughing.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.400
But definitely no closer to than three feet.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.400
Right now I'm talking and you're talking.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.400
But luckily you're going to call away.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.400
And around us is a small invisible cloud of small particles.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.400
Oh.

46:19.400 --> 46:26.400
And if I was infected, I would be infectious to somebody if they got into that distance.

46:26.400 --> 46:31.400
Once it diffuses out through the atmosphere and this type of thing, of course, infectivity

46:31.400 --> 46:37.400
goes down and the longer they're in the air, the more the virus is killed.

46:37.400 --> 46:43.400
This can probably hang around in a dehumidified indoor atmosphere for a couple hours.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.600
A lot of these viruses can.

46:46.600 --> 46:49.440
The flu virus, the cold virus.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.400
Because this is how they transmit in nature.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.400
The cold virus.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.400
What's he talking about?

46:53.400 --> 46:57.280
The outdoors with wind and sunlight and this type of thing.

46:57.280 --> 47:05.240
It becomes, it's mainly contamination then through your hands and touching portals of

47:05.240 --> 47:06.840
entry into your body.

47:07.840 --> 47:14.840
You've mentioned that the virus doesn't like humidity and a dehumidified indoor environment

47:14.840 --> 47:16.840
is good for a virus.

47:16.840 --> 47:24.840
So would it be safe to say based on that, that it would be a good thing for people to get

47:24.840 --> 47:31.840
humidifiers, to rehumidify their in-home environment?

47:32.840 --> 47:37.840
Well, then you get mold.

47:37.840 --> 47:44.840
Keep the windows open if you can and let air freely circulate.

47:44.840 --> 47:50.840
Or you can get special HEPA filters, high efficiency particulate air.

47:50.840 --> 47:54.840
And you can install these in your air conditioning system.

47:54.840 --> 48:00.840
Or they make room units that will constantly recirculate the air in a room.

48:00.840 --> 48:05.200
And they're a little expensive, they're like 300 bucks or so.

48:05.200 --> 48:11.760
But it will pass the air through ultraviolet lights and essentially sterilize it before

48:11.760 --> 48:13.680
it's released back.

48:13.680 --> 48:19.640
So if you can manage to scrape enough together to buy one of these things, that goes in the

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
little kids' room.

48:21.640 --> 48:22.640
The little kids' room.

48:22.640 --> 48:26.080
So while they're sleeping that air is constantly being recirculated.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.080
In the little kids' room.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.080
To get all those viruses from those dirty kids.

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
Wow.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.080
Wow.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.080
And specialists.

48:34.080 --> 48:40.520
What is your expert opinion on how this virus started and why do you believe that?

48:40.520 --> 48:42.080
Why do you believe it, Steven?

48:42.080 --> 48:43.080
Okay.

48:43.080 --> 48:46.480
Well, we've been waiting for something like this to happen.

48:46.480 --> 48:49.880
We've been waiting since 2003.

48:49.880 --> 48:50.880
Since 2003.

48:50.880 --> 48:54.080
There was a previous outbreak of a coronavirus called SARS.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.080
Oh.

48:55.080 --> 48:57.280
It's a very acute respiratory syndrome.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.880
Wow.

48:58.880 --> 49:05.600
And this was the product of viruses trafficking between wild animals and gaining the ability

49:05.600 --> 49:07.840
to jump into the human race.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.240
Boing, boing, boing.

49:09.240 --> 49:14.280
SARS came from a horseshoe bat, a Chinese horseshoe bat.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.760
And it hadn't fully adapted to man.

49:17.760 --> 49:21.640
They got into a cute little animal called a civet cat.

49:21.640 --> 49:24.040
They're actually a mongoose-like thing.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.040
Wow.

49:25.040 --> 49:28.040
And a delicacy over there.

49:28.040 --> 49:33.760
In Asia, they still, they're illegal, but they still have these wet markets.

49:33.760 --> 49:39.040
With all these exotic animals, you can take all of them to eat.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.120
And of course, they're all crammed together in cages.

49:41.120 --> 49:45.760
And any viral infections they have, the viruses, is jumping.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.760
Call of viral trafficking.

49:46.760 --> 49:47.760
Interesting.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.680
Because most viruses are pretty species specific.

49:50.680 --> 49:51.680
Most of them are.

49:51.680 --> 49:55.320
The virus in two different types of mammal.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.240
This could have the capability to jump into humans.

49:59.240 --> 50:04.440
And this is what you're forcing, very unnatural, civet cats and bats don't live together.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.440
Okay?

50:05.440 --> 50:07.440
They're not BFFs.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.440
BFFs.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.440
Wow.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.440
Okay.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.440
That is some...

50:11.440 --> 50:12.440
So...

50:12.440 --> 50:13.440
I'm glad he's...

50:13.440 --> 50:15.400
He's trying to relate to her viewers.

50:15.400 --> 50:17.760
It's nice that he's trying to relate to her viewers.

50:17.760 --> 50:22.480
So, the virus came in, the virus came in the ability, a large amount of it jumped into

50:22.480 --> 50:28.760
humans, and then it further adapted to be transmissible, easy from human to human.

50:28.760 --> 50:32.960
And this is this whole concept of emerging infectious disease.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.200
The whole concept.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.280
Right after the SARS, the whole mythology more likely...

50:37.280 --> 50:42.400
So the bat was found, which was different.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.480
It was still a coronavirus.

50:45.480 --> 50:50.240
It was related to SARS, but it had some unusual properties in tissue culture.

50:50.240 --> 50:54.280
And then it was realized there's probably hundreds of these different coronaviruses

50:54.280 --> 50:56.440
out there in nature.

50:56.440 --> 51:00.640
And then it's just a question of time before we have another outbreak.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.720
So we've been waiting for that.

51:02.720 --> 51:07.840
Secondly, you know, I assume you're asking, is it a bio-weapon?

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
No.

51:08.840 --> 51:09.840
No.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.480
The virus has been sequenced.

51:12.480 --> 51:16.880
The basic skeleton of the virus can be traced back.

51:16.880 --> 51:22.040
And mutations happen at a given rate in a virus.

51:22.040 --> 51:30.480
And it's a molecular clock you can actually estimate and see, okay, it started out here

51:30.480 --> 51:35.480
and it was an area sort of around Hong Kong, I believe.

51:35.480 --> 51:37.520
And then it appeared at the wet market.

51:37.520 --> 51:44.160
So common sense is that one of the people selling this thing took it into the wet market,

51:44.160 --> 51:47.480
got a load of virus himself.

51:47.480 --> 51:52.640
There was a genetic alteration when it was in the wet market.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.080
And I think it learned to become more transmissible to it.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.080
It learned.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
It learned to become more transmissible.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.080
So you have the case here.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.360
It got a fear and cleavage site, baby, and started jumping.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.800
He's carrying the original one.

52:03.800 --> 52:06.400
And then the cases from the wet market.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.400
Oh.

52:07.400 --> 52:10.080
And the virus had mutated in its view.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.080
Okay.

52:11.080 --> 52:18.120
They said, well, this guy, you know, he lived, the hotel was a couple blocks away.

52:18.120 --> 52:21.120
Well, the virus can, well, yeah, it could, it could go on the money.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.600
We talked about surface contamination.

52:23.600 --> 52:24.920
Oh, we got to get rid of cash.

52:24.920 --> 52:29.440
These viruses can live on paper or polymer notes for quite a while.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.160
And if they're in your pocket, they're not exposed to UV light.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.960
Oh, no.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
Makes sense?

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
Wow.

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
They're going to get rid of cash money.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.800
So that's my explanation for this.

52:40.800 --> 52:45.040
When you look at the genetic structure and the sequence of this virus, it is unusual.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.600
It's got a couple of unusual things.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.760
It's got a really long spike protein.

52:48.760 --> 52:49.760
Oh, wow.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.840
Younger than any of the other chronic drugs.

52:51.840 --> 52:52.840
Longer.

52:52.840 --> 52:54.280
It's a longer spike protein.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.000
But there's nothing to show that it's been manipulated.

52:58.000 --> 53:06.440
And we can trace the lineage right back to the early cases that were not in Wuhan.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.440
Wow.

53:07.440 --> 53:14.000
Plus this P4 laboratory, BSL4 laboratory there, the French put it in.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.120
And there's researchers in and out of that place.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.480
Nothing gets out of these facilities.

53:19.480 --> 53:22.680
Let me tell you, nothing.

53:22.680 --> 53:30.280
And that facility was like 10 or 15 kilometers away from the, it wasn't next door to the

53:30.280 --> 53:35.400
fish market, it's clear across town.

53:35.400 --> 53:39.080
So there's no indications that this was a bioweapon.

53:39.080 --> 53:42.920
The fact we were expecting it, the fact that the genetic sequence, we can trace pretty

53:42.920 --> 53:46.440
much back how this whole event happened.

53:46.440 --> 53:52.520
And if you go back into this area where the first case was from, they found about 400

53:52.520 --> 53:57.520
more coronaviruses down there, different.

53:57.520 --> 54:02.360
So this is Mother Nature.

54:02.360 --> 54:06.640
I don't think she's very happy with us.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.920
It doesn't appear to be so.

54:08.920 --> 54:11.120
Mother Nature is not very happy with us.

54:11.120 --> 54:17.960
I saw the, the Mac commercial and she isn't very happy with Mac and Taj anyway, or Apple.

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
Thank you for that.

54:18.960 --> 54:26.680
You were also mentioning, I believe, that this kind of illness, this coronavirus, is

54:26.680 --> 54:34.320
not as powerful as a biological viral weapon would be.

54:34.320 --> 54:42.400
Well, there's incapacitating biological agents that kill one to three percent that are, these

54:42.400 --> 54:47.240
are for use on the battlefield and they're designed to slow down enemy troops.

54:47.240 --> 54:51.760
But nobody makes the United States quit in 1969.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.720
The other countries are all supposed to have quit.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.440
There's a few that haven't.

54:57.440 --> 55:03.800
No one's going to waste time and effort on an incapacitating agent.

55:03.800 --> 55:08.120
Foreign powers that have B.W. programs more than likely are going to work.

55:08.120 --> 55:10.600
I think that an effort on an incapacitate.

55:10.600 --> 55:15.480
Kevin McCarron and Charles Rixie would definitely disagree with the idea that no one would waste

55:15.480 --> 55:18.320
time on a incapacitating agent.

55:18.320 --> 55:20.880
What an interesting choice of words there.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
Wow.

55:22.880 --> 55:27.440
That's almost like B.W. programs.

55:27.440 --> 55:30.240
Can you believe more than likely are going to work on lethal?

55:30.240 --> 55:32.760
It's like an incapacitating it.

55:32.760 --> 55:38.120
That phrase was probably used.

55:38.120 --> 55:51.200
That phrase was probably used around the same week for the first time by people like Paul

55:51.200 --> 55:54.520
Catrell and Kevin McCarron.

55:54.520 --> 55:59.760
At most a couple weeks before this video, I mean think about how extraordinary that

55:59.760 --> 56:00.760
is.

56:00.760 --> 56:07.360
Malone called it an incapacitating agent too but not in 2020 like McCarron did and like

56:07.360 --> 56:11.000
this guy did.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.360
Agent.

56:14.360 --> 56:19.600
Foreign powers that have B.W. programs more than likely are going to work on lethal agents

56:19.600 --> 56:26.760
that will overthrow an infrastructure.

56:26.760 --> 56:31.280
But of course, Giardano explains how you don't need a lethal agent to overthrow an infrastructure.

56:31.280 --> 56:35.200
You need the appearance of a lethal agent and then you can use the Internet and a lie

56:35.200 --> 56:41.560
about asymptomatic transmission that might have a sore throat and a fever to get everybody

56:41.560 --> 56:46.240
to bang down the doors and to get them to yell at the public health service and to get

56:46.240 --> 56:48.200
everything to collapse.

56:48.200 --> 56:55.000
That's why we show that video every day or used to show it every day.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.280
So it's really extraordinary now if you add all these things up and you see how that they

56:59.280 --> 57:08.640
line up and how we're talking right now, this is March 2020 when none of us knew nothing.

57:08.640 --> 57:20.480
But we're watching it at the end of 2023 with the benefit of hindsight.

57:20.480 --> 57:25.560
And there can be no doubt that it is the seeding of the worst case scenario that was most important

57:25.560 --> 57:34.600
in starting the train metaphor where these people were pretending that there was something

57:34.600 --> 57:41.160
that needed to be stopped and that they were contributing to us stopping it, that us following

57:41.160 --> 57:44.120
their directions was contributing to us stopping it.

57:44.120 --> 57:50.640
And these directions that he's giving us that include isolating our children as a source

57:50.640 --> 57:58.360
of extreme viral loads is really disturbing.

57:58.360 --> 58:03.320
You cannot see this as somebody who's, you know, from my experience with virology, I

58:03.320 --> 58:05.720
know that children shed virus like crazy.

58:05.720 --> 58:13.640
So when we have a new virus, we've really got to keep away from them.

58:13.640 --> 58:20.880
Old people, you better stay away from your grandkids because they're really virus factories.

58:20.880 --> 58:26.960
Is it safe to care for our kids when they're sick?

58:26.960 --> 58:30.960
If you wear an apron and a mask and use flip flops and sterilize everything, yeah, it's

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
okay.

58:31.960 --> 58:34.760
You can get away with it.

58:34.760 --> 58:38.440
I just wish Barney and Elmo would wear a mask so that these kids would start to find it

58:38.440 --> 58:41.440
normal because kids don't like to wear masks.

58:41.440 --> 58:42.440
They find it scary.

58:42.440 --> 58:43.440
All this new stuff.

58:43.440 --> 58:48.560
So we've got to normalize all this stuff.

58:48.560 --> 58:55.000
This is exactly as malevolent and wicked as it seems, ladies and gentlemen, my voice is

58:55.000 --> 58:59.960
exactly as I don't know what as it seems.

58:59.960 --> 59:02.440
The last couple of days it's been dropping a little bit more.

59:02.440 --> 59:06.360
I don't know what's going on.

59:06.360 --> 59:09.040
I wish I could say I was doing this on purpose, but I'm not.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.320
I have to try really hard to talk up with a higher voice.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.440
Otherwise it just drops right out.

59:15.440 --> 59:17.400
So that's where we are.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.600
Keep going there, Steve.

59:18.600 --> 59:19.600
Tell us more.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.320
Pilot higher and deeper, Steve.

59:22.320 --> 59:29.400
The cause, the ability to trace it back to the very first cases.

59:29.400 --> 59:35.240
The ability, it looks like this thing, a bat and a pangolin must have gone out on a date

59:35.240 --> 59:36.240
or something.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.240
Do you know what a pangolin is?

59:38.240 --> 59:39.240
Yes, I do.

59:39.240 --> 59:41.600
Really, they're creepy looking.

59:41.600 --> 59:46.240
It's a mammal, but it has scales on the outside.

59:46.240 --> 59:52.960
I want to get one as my comfort animal when I fly on an airplane.

59:52.960 --> 59:57.280
I've actually studied them with my kids there a little bit if I remember correctly, like

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.120
Armadillos and ant eaters put together.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:06.800
Yeah, but they've got these really scaly looking things.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.400
There's a picture on the internet of one sitting there like waving.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
They're protected.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
They're endangered.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:20.320
It's against the law to have them, but they're considered a delicacy in some parts of the

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.960
world.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:29.400
So people are eating them and that is the suspected reason why and how it is.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.600
It's not the eating them.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.440
These viruses are quickly destroyed by heat, but keeping them together and cages because

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.720
they're sold live or their heads are locked off just before they give it to the customer.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.560
Iris was not ingested by a human through eating.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:54.080
It was through touching and then the person putting their hands on their face.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.680
Holy balls, wow.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.920
More of these animals, coffins, sneeze, too.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.560
Pangolin coffins dropping their hands off create decapitation, aerosolized virus.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560
There's no ultraviolet.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560
Wow.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
Not out in a field.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:16.120
So this is all common things occur commonly.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:22.440
You've already had examples of these live markets putting out new hybrid pathogens through

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.600
viral mixing and there's evidence that this had passed through a couple different animal

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.480
species before.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.800
You won't see that in a biological weapon.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.760
Thank you for that clarity.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:42.600
There's been some information going around that people are hoping that warm weather, warmer

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.000
weather coming will break down this virus, will halt it.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.560
There's been some information going around that if people get in a hot sauna, that that's

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.440
the best place to go because it could kill the virus if you happen to have the virus

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.920
or be contaminated with it.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.200
Is that a correct assumption?

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:10.120
You know, it's complete nonsense.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.040
Singapore is still battling the virus.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.800
It's mid-summer in Singapore.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.240
The weather, if you've been there, it can be very oppressive, the heat.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.320
No, it doesn't work that way.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.640
Drinking hot drinks all the time.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:38.760
One of the scientists in France has said, oh yes, and drink hot water and this and that.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.760
Nah.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
You can.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.800
Heat will kill it, but it's going to scald your mouth, okay?

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.680
Yes, high temperatures, the virus gets a little looser.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.280
But remember, these things are designed.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.040
The pangolins come from Malaysia.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.720
Malaysia is beastly hot in the summer.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:16.240
This virus wouldn't get very far by aerosol amongst the pangolins if temperatures really

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.840
killed it off that quickly.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.240
So it's a little bit different than taking your mask off and throwing it in a hot dryer

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.760
for three minutes, okay?

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.560
Or ironing it with a steam iron.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.360
This is an autoclaving.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:42.920
So environmental temperatures really, now I will say, arctic temperatures do preserve

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.320
these things.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.200
Arctic temperatures, nice.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:53.560
Very, very cold temperatures, facilitate the virus hanging around longer in the air.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.280
Also arctic temperatures, what's happened to the humidity?

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.480
It's frozen out on the ground.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480
Snow.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.840
So it's drier.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.120
I'm going to speed this up.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.120
I can't take it in.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:11.320
With respect to environmental, very cold weather is ideal for viruses.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320
Very cold weather.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.480
They can withstand it up to a point.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.000
It's not the best for them, but they can withstand it for a while.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.520
It sounds like an episode of Drunk History that I'm going to leave it.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.520
I like it.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520
I like that.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.000
We're going to leave it at the regular speed.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.920
So stay outdoors in the sun.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920
It is.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.920
It's drunk biology.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.360
What you're saying is heat doesn't kill the sun.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360
I'm sure he's had a bourbon.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.360
The humidity, UV rays, the oxygen-

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360
These are the primary.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.840
Heat will kill it.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.560
You're going to be real careful here.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:50.040
Heat will kill it, but is it going to have any effect, person-to-person transmission?

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:56.400
Well, no, because you can be in the heat, but you're going to go indoors.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.360
If it's hot out, where are you going to be?

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:04.160
You're going to be in an air-conditioned dehumidified atmosphere.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.120
So no, hot weather is not going to slow it down.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:17.120
Now, cold weather can increase it because the virus will hang around longer, but hot

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.880
weather isn't going to stop it.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.320
Is that clear?

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320
It is.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.320
Thank you.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
Is that clear?

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320
Do you understand?

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
Okay, good.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:33.880
Can it help a patient to recover more quickly being in that environment, or is it too late

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.760
at that point the virus has already set up shop in their body?

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.920
Well, the virus has set up shop in the body, but if you had them outdoors, it would reduce

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.000
environmental contamination.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.880
Look at the Ebola hospitals in West Africa.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.120
Look how they were constructed.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.480
There was free to circulate.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.680
They were tents, essentially.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.560
They were subject to atmospheric humidity.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:09.160
There was sunlight everywhere on the outside.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.520
These are the type of hospitals you want for a communicable disease.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:16.160
Wow, we've got to have hospitals outside, not indoor hospitals.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.160
We need tents.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.600
Wow.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.000
You want it open.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.240
I've got a whole mass of virus here, but if I put it up in the air, it's going to dilute

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.240
out.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:35.120
It's going to get more and more dilute, which means the amount of virus for each area of

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.120
breath that I take in has been decreased.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.840
It's diffusing out.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.920
I think there's a lot of value in watching this.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.960
The reason why I think there's a lot of value in watching this is because you really need

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:53.480
to see how bad it was in March of 2020.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.760
Why we were thinking the things that we were thinking and what these people were saying,

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.600
because Stephen Hatfield has been on several streams with Robert Malone because he was

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:12.600
on stage with Denny Rancor not even three weeks ago.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.040
That's why we need to watch this.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:20.280
We need to understand this guy because he is an actual player on the board.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.680
He's repeatedly showed up.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.440
He's repeatedly pushed the narrative.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:34.200
He's repeatedly interjected when there's no real reason for him to be interjecting, right?

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:46.360
I mean, there's no reason for him to be doing the Tommy podcast with Robert Malone.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:56.080
There's no reason for him to be in Romania on stage with a bunch of coronavirus dissidents,

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:08.480
including Meryl Nasse, Jill and Robert Malone, Ryan Cole, all these people, Nick Hudson

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.280
and Denny Rancor and I don't know who else was in that picture.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:23.360
I can't remember off the top of my head anymore, but quite a few people we know, Brett Weinstein.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.000
It's really important.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.080
Inside, it's just recirculating around unless your air conditioning says he's not guessing

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.240
here.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:37.040
He's talking with certainty as he tells people to wear an apron as they take care of their

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.080
sick children until you get them tested or something like that.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:48.320
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst case scenario, the team worst case scenario.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.360
Everybody who was spreading this narrative in 2020 is part of team worst case scenario,

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.680
otherwise you would just be like, I don't know.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.880
This is not, I don't know.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880
This is detailed.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
I know.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880
This is detailed.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880
I'm sure.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880
This is detailed.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880
I'm certain.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880
This is ha.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:11.440
It's not, it's not scary for me because I know what's going on.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.600
You can't see it any other way.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.680
I mean, you guess you can, but I would really like it if you didn't.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.640
We can find the medlers if we're willing to look for them.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:30.360
We can find the people who laid the worst case scenario narrative down for our family

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:36.480
and friends to ingest for the people on TV to imbibe for the people on the TV to repeat

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.640
for the people on social media to circulate and for the YouTube to make go viral.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:49.520
This is a YouTube video that never went and got discredited or censored from March of

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.480
2020 onward.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:59.600
So apparently it's pretty dead on balls accurate, right?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.400
I think it's really important.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:08.160
Some has these special filters on it and they're very expensive and hospitals do not routinely

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.760
filter the HIPAA era that goes in and out because these filters have to be replaced every

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.760
few months.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.000
Sounds like we have a lot to learn and in building our hospitals for our communicable

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.600
diseases.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:27.560
Well, we know how to do it.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.880
There's never been the urgency and we're out of time now.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.040
This is going to run its course, so we'll see what happens.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.840
Is it really still safe, do you think, for people in the community to go to the local

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.680
coffee shop and have coffee to go to their local restaurant and eat, or should we be

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.320
pulling back from those things at this time?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.480
We should be pulling back from those things at this time.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480
There you go.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480
I'm sorry.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
I like to go out and eat.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:07.120
I like to go to the movies, but not for a month or so.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.040
And if you're riding mass transit.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.760
I mean, Paul Catrell says 60 days.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.400
And it's just not proud to go to sit there and wipe everything down with an alcohol-based

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.280
wipe before you sit down.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.280
Do you ever see the Big Bang Theory?

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.240
Sheldon Cooper had his bus pants that he would wear when he rode the bus.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.560
That's not a bad idea this time around.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:41.760
Remember, we said you should wash your clothing immediately when you come home from work.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760
Wow.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760
I mean...

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.320
And go take a shower.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.720
And go take a shower.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.760
So in case the virus is on your hair or on parts of your neck.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.760
Wow.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760
Yeah.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.760
You only need 500 particles.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:02.440
I don't know if I've got a one to two percent chance of dying from a virus.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.920
One to two percent chance of dying.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.120
Or getting really sick.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.400
And this virus makes you sick for a couple of weeks.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.840
Makes you sick for a couple of weeks.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840
You'll live.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.560
But most people live.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.440
Some people don't even know they have it.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.000
But how do I know that rule of the dice is going to affect me that way?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.760
Or how much virus I got into me?

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.160
So are they really that silly of precautions?

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.960
Well, no.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:37.320
You weigh what you have to lose with what you have to gain.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:45.320
And if taking your shoes off when you come into the house is a game, well, you probably

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.320
should be doing that.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.320
Yeah.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.960
Agreed.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.120
Things are being addressed.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.880
I think there's five vaccine candidates.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880
I mean, incredible.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:05.240
But it takes some time because you can't put a vaccine out there unless the benefit you

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:11.400
get is worth any possible minor side effect.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.320
You can't legally do that.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.080
Or morally.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.720
And it's the testing and certification that takes so much time.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:25.720
You can only do so much with animal tests or cell culture tests at this stage.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.440
That's the level of our science.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:34.480
Eventually, you have to go to phase one, two, and three clinical trials.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.360
And this is where it takes the time.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.280
And very often, I'll show you a dengue fever.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.080
It's a really nasty thing, transmitter.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:49.520
And there's these huge outbreaks every couple of years, 200, 300,000 cases in South America.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.480
So they've been working a long time on a vaccine.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.880
They finally got it out there.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.240
It's undergoing large snow.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.880
And it was really hurting people and they had to stop the trial.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.880
And this was after quite a bit of work on this thing.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:10.160
So you've got to be sure that this is as safe as possible before you even start your

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.760
clinical trials.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.080
And it takes time.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.640
Not making the vaccine.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.800
Not making sure it's safe and that it's effective.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:32.480
I think your flu shot this year was only about 50% effective.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480
It's a virus.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480
Relative risk.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480
Right.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.480
Now it takes us six months to make a flu vaccine.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.480
Well, that time has been cut down now with new technology.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.200
Oh, he knows that already.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.200
Nice.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.040
But the virus has changed in six months.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.520
They're moving ahead.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.640
I've never, I see a little bit from the sides and I've never seen anything move this quickly.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640
Wow.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.200
Warp speed, they call it.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.240
The fact our drugs are made overseas, virtually all of them.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.320
That had fallen under the radar.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:10.600
This is rapidly being addressed and at a breakneck speed.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.160
We'll get through this.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:19.120
There's no, I'll tell you when it's time to lose your mind, okay?

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120
It's not yet.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.360
It's going to be a little rough.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.680
This virus has a predilection for the older population over 50.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.840
Which I think are youngsters.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:42.160
But it may take a toll on our older generation.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.960
The kids seem to be doing pretty well.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:57.560
But they're virus factories and adults in their middle years, most of them will get

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.480
over this.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.000
Thank you so much for giving us so many practical steps that we can take.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.320
Each of us in our own homes and with our own families to help to deter the spread of two

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320
cameras.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320
I hope it's well produced.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:21.480
We hope that everyone in the background on both cameras and stay well.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.960
Good boca on both cameras nicely backlit from that side and not from that side.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:31.720
It's a really well produced video for March 2020.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.560
I got to say I'm pretty impressed.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.960
And I got to say that I think it was nothing more than the initiation of the train dance

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.520
with lots and lots of people pretending that there was something to stop and that they

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.400
were contributing to stopping it by starting a discussion about all this stuff.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.120
I think one of the things that came out of the talk that I did yesterday for the Doctors

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.840
for COVID ethics group is that there are lots of doctors that now have come to the

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.960
conclusion that arguing about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin was another piece of this puzzle

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:12.800
because hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin could very well have antibiotic anti-inflammatory

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.800
properties that in general make them useful.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.160
And so the usefulness of these drugs which were not being used before the pandemic and

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.720
their rollout now has led some doctors to believe that the overall benefits of these

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:35.160
drugs are directly related to their specific application to COVID rather than to secondary

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:44.360
pneumonia rather than to inflammation or respiratory disease.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:51.680
And it is possible that people who planned this elaborate display were very well aware

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.360
of the fact that these two drugs have a wide variety of benefits and that their perceived

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.800
usefulness would be very easy to feign.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:09.480
It would be very easy to get a couple people to advocate for them and make a couple stories

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.000
and do a couple things and get people to argue about whether or not a certain trial was fair

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.520
and before you know it everybody's taking the drug.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.960
Some people it makes feel better and that for them means that there's definitely a

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.840
COVID that means that there's definitely a SARS-CoV-2 that means that it definitely

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.840
cured them and it couldn't possibly have been bacterial pneumonia, it couldn't have possibly

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:40.560
been pinworms, it couldn't have possibly been any number of imbalances in your gut flora

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.320
that are somewhat helped by ivermectin treatment.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.040
It couldn't be any other thing other than i think i had COVID and then ivermectin cured

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.480
it in a day.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:58.600
Hydroxychloric when prevented me from getting it all these stories are part of the train,

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:06.440
the train stopping exercise where they converted all caused mortality and the excess deaths

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:15.640
that could be imagined to happen here if your brain can see a pattern from 2014 and

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.320
see that that pattern was disrupted here and you're not told to subtract all of the things

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:31.240
that actually happened to produce these local mass casualty events, non-spreading local mass

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.480
casualty events and that lack of geographic spread is not displayed in this graph then

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.960
people can make the argument that look at how many extra people died this year, obviously

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:48.960
we've had a pandemic but it requires them to ignore all of these things.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:58.560
It required a number of actors to ignore these things, a number of actors which instead stuck

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:07.400
to the TV scenario about a bad cave, zoonosis and that illusion of consensus that the lockdowns

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:14.800
and stuff were necessary, they saved people from this virus and that's the faith, asymptomatic

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:21.280
spread, gain a function, the whole thing and we need to save our children from this faith

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.520
because if we don't then they're going to be on this train forever and it's not very

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:33.520
long now, if we don't start to wake up pretty quick, you know, in the next two to three years

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:40.080
there's going to be too many college kids which will have imbibed this, too many post-college kids

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:46.880
who have imbibed it, too many young kids in high school who have imbibed it, we've got to break

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.200
this faith right now, we've got to tell the truth about vaccines, we've got to tell the truth

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.840
about immunology, we've got to tell the truth about transfection, we've got to tell the truth

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:06.800
about viruses and that may include AIDS and a lot of other stories that we've been told,

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.880
I don't know which ones will fall, I don't know which ones will have some biological basis in fact

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:20.720
but we have a lot of work to do and I don't think farewell to virology is the document which does

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:29.760
the work, it's a far cry from that actually but I do agree that this faith is a lie especially

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:35.600
with regard to coronaviruses, I am certain the coronaviruses as in a phenomenon have been exaggerated

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:42.960
coronaviruses as a phenomenon in 2023 have been grossly exaggerated

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.320
and why have they done it because they want us, they want our children, they want to invert the

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.560
way that our children think about themselves, they want their children to think about themselves

01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:01.280
as flawed, not perfect, they want the children to think about themselves as malleable, not flawless,

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:10.160
they want to think about, they want our children to think of themselves as well unnatural or

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:15.200
un-sacred is the right word, sorry, they want our children to

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.040
essentially desecrate the temple that is their body

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:29.520
that's what they want, I know that's what they want and so stop all transfections in humans

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.880
and I will definitely be here tomorrow

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:41.440
because that's what we do, I don't know if it'll be a long stream tomorrow, you know it's always

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.920
like that, hopefully everything's going to be fine, intramuscular injection of any combination

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.600
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, transfection in healthy

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:59.920
humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity, I really think it's just

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.800
because I yelled a lot at basketball practice last night but I am gonna try and take it easy,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:11.120
if my voice feels like this tomorrow it's possible that I might come on and not talk

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:18.720
very much or something like that, oh it's messing with my stuff there, hold on let's cut it over

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:34.640
Thanks guys, I'll see you again tomorrow night

01:23:48.720 --> 01:24:14.720
Roger that, Toyota Corolla, most popular car ever, for analogies, gotcha, Roger that, good night, omies

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:34.640
I believe it's much more likely that it's a lab leak
