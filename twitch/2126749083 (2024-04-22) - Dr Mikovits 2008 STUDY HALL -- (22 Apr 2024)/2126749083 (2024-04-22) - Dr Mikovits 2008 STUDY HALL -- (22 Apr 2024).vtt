00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I

02:17.580 --> 02:23.280
Think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society

02:23.680 --> 02:27.960
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

02:30.720 --> 02:39.440
Let's check that right now. How is this sound that we lined up or not?

02:40.240 --> 02:44.240
Talk to me goose if we're not lined up. We'll just start again

02:47.200 --> 02:50.840
All good Arthur says good step says good we're out

02:50.840 --> 03:00.640
This episode is sponsored by mink. That's moo plus link

03:04.720 --> 03:11.440
This my point is that if if we were able to just like we're trying to get everybody to take the vaccine

03:11.440 --> 03:17.640
If we had put that into getting everybody to take hypermectin and fluvoxamine for for a month

03:17.960 --> 03:21.880
If we and if we could accomplish that then COVID would be wiped out

03:21.880 --> 03:28.320
We could do it and actually any municipality that could regulate its borders could clear the disease if it could accomplish that

03:28.320 --> 03:30.320
I believe

03:30.680 --> 03:34.980
But you can tell if someone's you know you can sort of feel it and people

03:36.320 --> 03:41.240
And I have lied I'm sure I don't want a lot. You know, I don't think I'm a liar

03:41.240 --> 03:43.240
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

03:43.760 --> 03:46.600
It's like really important not to be a liar

03:47.640 --> 03:49.640
You

04:17.640 --> 04:19.640
You

04:47.640 --> 04:54.600
Three people with thyroid cancer sounds not good

04:55.600 --> 05:01.000
It's not the kind of correlation we want to be having here, but I'm afraid this is the kind of truth

05:01.960 --> 05:06.360
This is the only kind of truth that will save us people need to start having

05:08.280 --> 05:10.280
Feeling pain

05:10.320 --> 05:11.720
Somehow

05:11.720 --> 05:16.840
If enough placebos were rolled out, we're always gonna have problems

05:17.640 --> 05:22.240
So crazy like yeah, it's it's not good. This is so crazy

05:23.920 --> 05:25.920
Nervous like what in the world man

05:25.920 --> 05:27.920
Oh

05:43.760 --> 05:47.360
Well, thank you very much for 35 people being here at

05:47.360 --> 05:49.360
1313

05:50.920 --> 05:56.240
Another weekday it is Monday again. We are still working on dispelling the enchantment

05:59.560 --> 06:02.920
For the first time you might be a skilled TV watcher

06:02.920 --> 06:10.120
But I suspect most of the people who are here already are are at the top of this wave where we are staying focused on the biology

06:10.120 --> 06:13.920
We aren't taking the bait on television and social media. We are loving our neighbors

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
As

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
You know the way this works is if people spread this around the new biology finds

06:21.600 --> 06:26.000
people each week and that's how we grow our roots are at

06:26.640 --> 06:33.840
Gigalombiological.com and also giga home.bio as well as screen dot giga home.bio where you can see it live and afterwards

06:34.560 --> 06:38.480
And it's all provided by us here at giga home biological

06:39.640 --> 06:42.120
We are completely supported by

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Hello, well, hello

06:47.520 --> 06:57.080
We are completely supported by viewers and viewers only there are a couple people who are responsible for having funded more than more than a year of our work

06:57.840 --> 07:04.320
People like Greg James and Rodney Mullen and a few other people have donated very significant amounts of money to keep this

07:08.400 --> 07:13.800
And it's the start of something really cool like an independent bright web that I think actually maybe

07:13.920 --> 07:15.280
Jimmy Gore

07:15.280 --> 07:17.280
Could in theory be a part of

07:19.120 --> 07:26.480
I don't know if you're aware of why I was not on air last night, but my wife and I this this lovely person photographed

07:27.080 --> 07:30.680
There 20 years ago. That's us 20 years ago

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
In the Brookfield Zoo

07:33.800 --> 07:38.920
I have a friend who may still be a keeper there. I have to admit that I'm out of touch with him now

07:39.760 --> 07:45.960
But at the time he was the only keeper in the world who would free swim with walruses during training

07:46.880 --> 07:52.400
Keep in mind that that animal right there is about a thousand pounds and so if you have a thousand pound

07:53.480 --> 07:57.480
Aquatic golden retriever bump into you between you and the wall

07:57.480 --> 08:02.160
It can be a very dangerous position to be in there's lots of funny stories that he told us

08:02.560 --> 08:07.360
That's why we got to make that photograph. We got to hold a penguin that day

08:07.360 --> 08:09.840
I got attacked by octopus that day

08:09.840 --> 08:11.040
I got to

08:11.040 --> 08:17.320
Pet a dolphin in the middle of a dolphin show and like all the kids are like who the hell is this guy that gets to pet a dolphin?

08:17.840 --> 08:22.520
It was a really cool day and one of the things we got to do look at all those people in the window back there

08:23.240 --> 08:25.240
Thinking what in the hell are those people doing?

08:25.800 --> 08:31.640
Getting to play with that walrus and then there's another walrus over there that keeper's got to keep that one busy while

08:31.640 --> 08:33.640
This one was over here posing with us

08:34.640 --> 08:41.280
Anyway, this is gigo and biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist that biologist is me

08:41.920 --> 08:46.760
Jonathan Cooley United non-compliance is something we all need to start trying to understand

08:46.760 --> 08:53.400
What does it really mean in the context of of our current scenario where there isn't too much to obviously?

08:54.080 --> 08:59.640
Not comply with but in reality, there's a lot you can you can not comply with there's a lot

09:00.120 --> 09:06.080
Going on at your school that you cannot comply with there's a lot going on at the barbecues and at at

09:07.400 --> 09:10.240
basketball games that you cannot comply with and

09:11.600 --> 09:17.840
Yeah, this is gigo and biological the safest way to get biology in your head. It is the 22nd of April

09:18.920 --> 09:20.920
2024

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
2024 how is that even possible?

09:22.960 --> 09:29.580
We have been here for a while still fighting this conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the

09:29.640 --> 09:35.760
masses which is how they got us to accept this pandemic as real and all the consequences of it

09:36.200 --> 09:43.960
Being a result of you know, nobody's nobody's got anybody. Nobody's got any bad intentions. It's just how it happened

09:44.520 --> 09:50.040
And that's how they got us to discard the principle of informed consent

09:52.320 --> 09:57.200
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooley. This is gigo and biological coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

09:57.200 --> 09:59.200
We

10:00.240 --> 10:02.240
Have a hypothesis that in

10:03.040 --> 10:10.720
2020 a number of mass casualty events were staged around the world and used and misconstrued as evidence of impending doom

10:11.240 --> 10:17.640
That a novel virus had just started to spread around the world. New York City was one of the key illusions

10:17.640 --> 10:23.560
That was used as a sort of seating event where here if you can see my little tiny arrow there

10:24.560 --> 10:32.080
That little slope right there was used to extrapolate that we were at the at the doorstep of impending doom and

10:32.600 --> 10:33.760
they

10:33.760 --> 10:42.840
Told this story using non-specific PCR tests that were actually rolled out on a very hot background and this hot background resulted in what

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
effectively was

10:45.000 --> 10:48.720
The idea that wow we're finding it everywhere. We're finding it everywhere

10:48.800 --> 10:53.560
in fact, wherever you look for it you found it because it was always there in the background a combination of

10:53.960 --> 10:56.720
Always there in the background in non-specific tests

10:57.360 --> 11:03.160
This enabled a larger percentage of all-cause mortality than ever before to be converted to a

11:03.720 --> 11:09.120
National security threat in the form of not influenza, but a novel virus for which we were all

11:09.880 --> 11:11.880
vulnerable and that story

11:11.880 --> 11:18.160
That one particular line a novel virus for which we were all vulnerable with an unknown set of

11:18.440 --> 11:26.120
Consequences for an unknown number of people was the mythology that allowed them to justify everything up and to and including the

11:26.480 --> 11:30.520
Transfection the coercion of transfection the coercion of accepting

11:30.880 --> 11:32.880
Transfection as a countermeasure

11:33.000 --> 11:40.280
to this potential impending doom and I do think it's very possible that if they felt it was necessary in

11:40.640 --> 11:45.840
Order to bamboozle academic science as a whole around the world. It is possible very easy

11:46.480 --> 11:54.920
to seed PCR positivity in the form of a spike protein and end protein or an entire genome using DNA or RNA

11:55.200 --> 12:01.920
Combinations there of recombinant technologies used to produce mass quantities of a signal that then would be misconstrued as

12:02.880 --> 12:04.680
spread and

12:04.680 --> 12:07.320
Because the goal is a total inversion of our

12:08.040 --> 12:13.560
National sovereignty and also our individual sovereignty or sovereignty over our children that complete conversion

12:14.120 --> 12:18.080
To us as experimental animals who are given permission to do things

12:19.280 --> 12:21.280
Since that's the goal

12:21.800 --> 12:29.640
Then a spectacular commitment to this lie is is what's required and it shouldn't be surprising to many of us

12:29.640 --> 12:34.200
But it will be surprising to people joining the stream for the first time that we are actually

12:35.440 --> 12:42.600
Working under the the hypothesis that that everyone is coordinated in their lying spectacularly committed to the lie

12:43.200 --> 12:49.400
Because it is a national security situation. They understand that there will be dire consequences because

12:52.120 --> 12:58.720
Interfering with or obstructing a national security operation would have very dire consequences

13:00.240 --> 13:05.080
And of course we're all humans right and so as these people rushed into the fire in

13:05.400 --> 13:11.440
2020 many of them ended up being co-opted by this national security event giving given two choices

13:11.440 --> 13:13.120
You can either help us

13:13.120 --> 13:16.200
Make sure that people take the worst-case scenario seriously

13:16.200 --> 13:24.040
You can either help us and make sure that people comply with our edicts and our rules until we're ready for the next shift

13:24.040 --> 13:26.460
Or we can give that job to somebody else

13:27.800 --> 13:34.160
And so it's very likely that people like Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey and many other people were read in

13:34.480 --> 13:41.040
To the situation in so far as they needed to know and given a set of talking points that they were

13:42.240 --> 13:46.080
Required to stick to in order to make sure that they didn't encroach on

13:46.440 --> 13:51.080
The operation that was going on in the background that was this national security thing

13:52.240 --> 13:54.600
And I think once you start to see it this way

13:54.680 --> 14:00.960
You can actually forgive a lot of these people for making two hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year as the head of a

14:01.440 --> 14:08.800
doctor group or you can forgive them for for selling a book about Ivermectin and nothing else or a book about

14:09.360 --> 14:11.360
Lab leak and nothing else

14:14.400 --> 14:19.880
Before I do the the the study hall today with Judy Mikovitz's video from

14:20.880 --> 14:27.600
2018 did I say 2008 in the description I did it should be 2018 so I'm gonna fix that

14:28.120 --> 14:29.880
I'll do that post

14:29.880 --> 14:31.880
But I wanted to make a couple

14:32.200 --> 14:37.440
Mentions of some things that are going on in my world that I thought would be worth mentioning

14:37.440 --> 14:40.120
The first thing is is that I've been making subtle

14:40.680 --> 14:42.680
Remarks about my friend at the gym

14:43.680 --> 14:49.680
As you may well be aware if you're a viewer here my boys and I have joined a basketball workout gym

14:50.800 --> 14:57.480
so that they can work on their basketball and then if I get their membership then I get one kind of a free because I'm just a dad and

14:57.840 --> 15:02.960
So I've been shooting around very consistently for the last 50 odd days or so

15:02.960 --> 15:07.040
I think I've missed three days in the last 50 shooting around jumping rope this kind of thing

15:07.440 --> 15:12.560
Getting in shape and I've been making friends with the guys that work there. There aren't that many guys that work there actually

15:12.560 --> 15:14.560
It's really crazy. I got two stories for you

15:14.800 --> 15:21.320
The first one is is that one of the guys that works there actually coaches high school where my kids go and my son will start next year

15:21.320 --> 15:25.680
and it turns out that that dude played in the game where

15:26.160 --> 15:33.040
Chris Weber like called the timeout and and played for North Carolina and like won a national championship and was a pro

15:33.560 --> 15:36.840
For 16 years in Europe, which doesn't even make sense to me

15:38.320 --> 15:44.240
And so this guy is now one of the managers there and gives you know shooting coaching lessons

15:44.240 --> 15:49.040
And and is the high school coach at this high school that we're currently in that township up

15:49.040 --> 15:50.120
So it's really exciting

15:50.120 --> 15:53.360
House have found out that he might not be there anymore, which would kind of suck

15:53.360 --> 15:56.800
But he's a nice guy. He invited me to work out with him and his friends

15:57.520 --> 16:00.400
Downtown Pittsburgh during the week, which is also very flattering

16:00.400 --> 16:02.880
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to swing that but it sounds really cool

16:03.120 --> 16:10.520
And then the other guy working there the older guy actually has been a coach at more than 10 division one schools in his career

16:10.520 --> 16:15.600
And as he characterized himself, there's probably nobody that spent more time in a gym than me

16:16.880 --> 16:18.880
Really really nice guy

16:18.880 --> 16:20.560
White hair

16:20.560 --> 16:23.960
Short white hair, you know old white dude from somewhere. I don't know where

16:24.760 --> 16:28.200
Real humble helps everybody gives a little lessons to kids

16:28.200 --> 16:32.480
But also just you know when he comes walks past my kids and they're working out

16:32.480 --> 16:38.080
He'll knock the ball out of their hand and tell them to protect the ball or he'll try to block their shot real sweet old guy

16:39.320 --> 16:45.000
And last week I had to help him carry a ladder because he had to get to one of the the screens

16:45.000 --> 16:50.280
That's above the shooting machines and it was a long heavy fiberglass ladder that opened up like this

16:50.280 --> 16:55.200
So it's pretty heavy and me and another kid carried it for him because he couldn't even carry it with his one arm

16:55.200 --> 16:59.040
And he last week he told me that he'd gotten a shingles shot and this week

16:59.680 --> 17:06.040
Yesterday I was at the gym and and that gentleman was there again and when I was talking to him. He was he was like this

17:08.120 --> 17:13.080
And I was like dude what's up with your neck and he said oh man, I know I

17:14.040 --> 17:15.600
Don't know

17:15.600 --> 17:18.800
And he was kind of hesitant. He says, you know, I'm not an anti-vaxxer

17:19.480 --> 17:23.440
But I think last week I told you that I got a single shingles shot remember

17:23.920 --> 17:27.440
I had to I had you help me carry that ladder. I said I definitely remember man

17:27.840 --> 17:32.760
And he said well, it's gotten worse like I don't know I don't like I said

17:32.760 --> 17:36.040
I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but it happened like immediately after the shot

17:36.040 --> 17:41.120
I had this pain in my arm and it goes all the way up the back of my head and in my neck and

17:41.680 --> 17:43.680
I'm thinking right away

17:43.680 --> 17:50.400
Ossipital neuropathy. I'm thinking right away isn't that what people get from shingles like holy shit. So

17:51.160 --> 17:53.840
It's it's extraordinary because

17:54.400 --> 18:01.600
He's he's making apologies. He's telling his doctor this the doctor says nah, it's a stiff neck and gets him a chiropractor

18:03.320 --> 18:05.840
recommends a chiropractor for this guy

18:06.000 --> 18:11.840
He can't sleep he hasn't slept in three nights because when he lays down the pain is so unbearable and

18:12.480 --> 18:14.480
I was I couldn't really

18:15.360 --> 18:17.800
Process it all because I don't know what to say to him

18:17.800 --> 18:24.960
You know because he's already airing on the side of caution that I might not understand that he's he's not an anti-vaxxer

18:24.960 --> 18:30.520
But you know this can happen and he had to really walk on those eggshells afraid that I might be like, oh, you know

18:31.680 --> 18:38.360
Of course I talked to him and told him who I was and what I had done and where I'd been as briefly as I could and

18:39.360 --> 18:42.600
Now I don't have anything else really to say to him. What can I say to him?

18:42.600 --> 18:46.760
He took a he didn't take shingrix. He took the other one, which is recombinant

18:47.120 --> 18:50.240
It's recombinant virus, you know, it's weakened somehow

18:50.240 --> 18:52.840
I don't know they got rid of some jeans or something. I have no idea

18:52.840 --> 18:57.040
I haven't looked into it yet, but it's just terrible because he's got neuropathy now

18:57.040 --> 19:02.480
And I know I'm not a doctor, but I know that neuropathy is not something you can just take vitamin C4

19:04.160 --> 19:05.720
And so it terrifies me

19:05.720 --> 19:08.880
I don't know if I'm gonna see that guy today when I go to the gym with my kids

19:08.880 --> 19:10.880
I don't know if I'm gonna see him next month and

19:11.840 --> 19:16.880
And will this ever go away from or is it gonna be a devastating thing that ruins this guy's life forever

19:17.120 --> 19:19.800
He says to me at some point in the conversation

19:19.800 --> 19:22.440
No, I never have reactions when I get these vaccines

19:22.440 --> 19:24.480
And then I'm thinking holy shit

19:24.480 --> 19:32.200
How many vaccines are they telling you to take when you go on the CDC website the CDC recommends everybody over 50 to take two shots of the singles

19:32.280 --> 19:34.280
vaccine and

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
That's what they told him I

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
I

19:40.520 --> 19:46.440
Think that you know quite frankly we should be telling all of our old people all of our friends everybody not to take any

19:46.600 --> 19:52.640
Vaccines none new no they don't need new vaccines. They're old people. They should eat better take vitamin whatever, but not

19:53.440 --> 19:56.440
Vaccines we've got to stop this nonsense. I

19:57.600 --> 20:03.560
Did tell him I was an anti-vaxxer. I told him that I worked for one of the the top 12 anti-vaxxers for a while

20:04.520 --> 20:06.520
Yeah, it was pretty funny

20:07.440 --> 20:11.040
Pretty pretty funny conversation. Okay, so now Jimmy door

20:11.840 --> 20:13.840
Guess who I saw yesterday?

20:13.840 --> 20:17.720
I saw Jimmy door yesterday and I gave him a book

20:18.800 --> 20:25.840
Robert can it Robert F. Kennedy's book and I had highlighted all the places where I was where I was

20:26.320 --> 20:32.040
quoted I also put my phone number everything in there and I said in the inside of the cover I

20:32.280 --> 20:37.360
Wrote we are being lied to by the people now riding white horses

20:37.360 --> 20:39.360
we should talk and

20:39.360 --> 20:46.120
I have little tabs in every place in the book where I'm found so that he can find me and it says that's me and stuff

20:46.120 --> 20:49.400
I I ruined the book basically, but I used it as a business card

20:49.960 --> 20:55.720
I talked to him very briefly here in this little meet-and-greet where there were like 10 people so it wasn't very long

20:55.720 --> 20:57.120
I could have talked to him for longer

20:57.160 --> 21:03.760
We also got to meet Steph and we took a picture with her after the show and I'm not really sure why I'm not wearing the t-shirt

21:03.760 --> 21:05.760
But I will put it on

21:05.760 --> 21:11.280
And so we didn't talk for very long. I just said hey I helped Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

21:11.280 --> 21:16.360
Write this book you can see my name here. Here's my phone number, you know, we should talk and it was really cool

21:16.920 --> 21:21.800
The guy who was selling the t-shirt said thanks for the book and then Steph on the way out took

21:21.800 --> 21:25.280
I said took a picture with us on the way out and said thanks for the book

21:25.440 --> 21:28.760
I don't know if they're gonna get back to me. I don't know what's gonna happen

21:29.880 --> 21:31.080
but

21:31.080 --> 21:34.280
That's as close as I can get to making some kind of

21:35.520 --> 21:39.600
Penetration into this more mainstream media area

21:40.160 --> 21:43.000
And it was really a great show. He took a lot of risks

21:43.800 --> 21:48.040
I have to commend him for the amount of time he spent talking about how

21:48.600 --> 21:52.800
angry he was about being lied to about the vaccine and and

21:53.040 --> 21:56.520
Defending the people in the room, you know

21:56.520 --> 22:00.720
He asked everybody to raise their hand if they had not taken the shot and a lot of people

22:00.720 --> 22:04.880
I mean it's Pittsburgh right and it's a Jimmy Dorshow a lot of people raised their hand

22:04.880 --> 22:10.520
But the people that didn't raise their hand he showed and spoke solidarity with them and said that you know

22:10.520 --> 22:16.680
You shouldn't be ashamed of being fooled. They frickin lied and it was really wonderful the way that he said it now

22:16.680 --> 22:22.240
There were caveats he he gave Robert Malone credit for having predicted that Omicron would be

22:23.440 --> 22:26.400
Would be less or less severe and more mild

22:27.560 --> 22:33.080
He's definitely convinced that there was a virus still right but he is very very

22:33.640 --> 22:40.160
Advanced in terms of his understanding that they lie about everything and so I don't think it would be that far of a leap for him

22:40.480 --> 22:43.560
To think that some of these people have lied about the biology

22:43.560 --> 22:47.960
I don't think it would be very hard for him to take that leap at all. He ended his

22:48.440 --> 22:51.480
So I'll tell you a first a funny story about Jimmy Dors

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
He made a joke

22:54.560 --> 22:55.480
about

22:55.480 --> 22:56.840
circumcision and

22:56.840 --> 23:00.680
it was something to do with with cutting heads off and

23:01.120 --> 23:07.160
People don't care if they cut this off or whatever and it being Jewish. I can't remember exactly, but then he said

23:08.200 --> 23:13.420
And I'm not Jewish, but somehow I ended up circumcised and it just

23:13.920 --> 23:19.520
Blurted it out from my table in the back and it was dead quiet. Everybody heard it

23:19.600 --> 23:22.680
I said they needed it for cell culture and

23:23.400 --> 23:28.920
his immediate response like right whip snap fast as it could be hey

23:28.920 --> 23:34.480
Alex Jones is in the audience today ladies and gentlemen. Well welcome Alex and everybody laughed

23:34.480 --> 23:38.200
I got a couple fist bumps from people around me. It was really cute

23:38.840 --> 23:41.080
and he ended the stream with

23:42.280 --> 23:48.280
They're lying to us to divide us. They tell us lies to divide us. They don't want us to become united

23:48.360 --> 23:52.440
They don't want us to unite and we need to unite. We need to love our neighbor

23:52.640 --> 23:58.240
We need to come together as one country. He said a lot of really cool things. He wants a revolution

23:58.240 --> 24:00.440
He's be happy to be a leader of it. I

24:02.200 --> 24:03.880
Do think that he's a good soul

24:03.880 --> 24:10.440
I think he's a good guy and I just think that it's very easy to be in his position and not have the requisite

24:10.600 --> 24:16.640
Knowledge to know whether somebody like Robert Malone really is a whistleblower or or or kind of a two-faced

24:17.080 --> 24:21.600
You know insider and and I do think that that it's not impossible

24:23.720 --> 24:26.760
Jimmy's been doing some great stuff with regard to RFK

24:26.880 --> 24:32.280
He said I saw some people in the audience with some and and some people at the meet and greet that had

24:32.680 --> 24:36.240
Kennedy shirts on gosh. I really like that guy. He's really cool. It's too bad

24:36.240 --> 24:40.200
He's a fucking Zionist and it's sorry to swear. I was just quoting him

24:40.280 --> 24:42.320
But he got really mad about it

24:42.320 --> 24:47.440
He got really mad about Cornell West and really mad about Bernie Sanders and was a real

24:47.920 --> 24:49.680
Well spread out, you know

24:49.680 --> 24:56.720
I am very disappointed in how many people I have put my trust in and belief in that have let me down and I had a real I

24:57.160 --> 25:02.320
Had the feeling that he was really working things out. He's real be an honest on stage. It's real

25:02.840 --> 25:07.060
he's trying kind of to resurrect a little bit of the of the

25:08.060 --> 25:14.420
Of the George Carlin stick, but it's a much more raw presentation. It's a guy who got screwed

25:14.420 --> 25:20.180
He is not happy about having taken that shot. He's not happy about these people having gotten away with it

25:20.180 --> 25:27.460
And I like he's he's angry in the right way because he's also really he's a whip. He's whip funny. I mean he was really good

25:29.380 --> 25:34.700
He was really good and I really enjoyed it a lot. I know that fear the laughed a lot apparently

25:34.780 --> 25:38.780
He's been doing comedy since before women had dicks that was his first joke

25:38.780 --> 25:44.020
And I thought that at that point we were already lost like it was I was just laughing and the nice thing about it

25:44.020 --> 25:47.500
Was is fearless and I had not been out on any kind of date without the kids

25:48.420 --> 25:49.700
in

25:49.700 --> 25:51.700
In memory

25:51.700 --> 25:54.340
It's certainly the first time we've gone out like that

25:54.340 --> 26:00.940
I think since covid and so it was a really nice dinner together and really nice time together and

26:01.820 --> 26:07.860
The kids did really well while we were gone and and so overall was really great and who knows?

26:07.860 --> 26:12.380
I mean, we planted a seed with Jimmy right and and that's all we can really hope to do

26:12.380 --> 26:18.420
I hope that you agree with me that that's it couldn't have been better than that. I don't think

26:20.060 --> 26:25.500
Basically I used the book in the worst way possible in their imagination, I guess

26:26.460 --> 26:28.460
But yeah

26:28.500 --> 26:29.820
Anyway

26:29.820 --> 26:33.460
Judy McAvitt study hall cannabis sciences virtual event

26:33.460 --> 26:37.540
I thought this was interesting because of the emphasis on

26:38.100 --> 26:41.820
cannabinoids and the cannabinoid system with regard to immune regulation

26:42.460 --> 26:50.060
And I thought it was very curious that somebody like Judy McAvitt's would present this at the cannabis sciences virtual event

26:50.940 --> 26:55.380
In 2018 and since I haven't done very much work on Judy McAvitt's

26:55.380 --> 26:57.740
I don't really have a good idea of what's going on with her

26:57.740 --> 27:01.740
I thought this was also a really nice way for me to be able to plug

27:02.620 --> 27:04.620
my friend's work

27:05.180 --> 27:07.420
My friend mark usatonic so

27:08.180 --> 27:10.620
Mark Koolack has a website called

27:11.580 --> 27:15.420
usatonic ITS and if you go to his research page

27:17.580 --> 27:19.580
Like this and you go all

27:19.860 --> 27:25.860
Then you basically get to the A's and then you have this alphabet underneath here and you can look up anybody that he's

27:26.180 --> 27:29.460
He's stored things on and so you know

27:29.460 --> 27:35.700
You can find a page on Judy McAvitt's there and you can find a page on some of the people that have worked with her and and

27:35.980 --> 27:40.900
And a long you know all the all the stuff is there. That's the nice thing about it

27:40.900 --> 27:47.860
It's not a Wikipedia because a Wikipedia is pretty incomplete mark has taken a lot of these original sources and compiled them together

27:48.660 --> 27:52.700
And so you can get a good idea of her her background there

27:52.700 --> 27:57.500
And so I would like to encourage you to do that and also just to go back one step

27:57.620 --> 28:03.780
There's also quite a bit on shingles vaccination with the CDC and one of the things that's there

28:03.980 --> 28:08.140
You can find is occipital neurology, which is I think what my friend at the gym has

28:08.700 --> 28:10.620
And you can find

28:10.620 --> 28:16.340
Complications long term nerve pain nerve pain is the most common complications of shingles

28:16.660 --> 28:18.660
So it terrifies me to think that this

28:19.220 --> 28:25.020
Hossipital neurology that I think that my friend is now suffering from could be a long-term nerve pain problem

28:25.660 --> 28:30.900
Which is just disgusting the CDC recommends two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine

28:31.220 --> 28:35.780
To prevent shingles and related combinations in adults 50 years or older. I

28:37.140 --> 28:41.020
Just think it's disgusting and I think that this lie needs to be put to rest

28:41.980 --> 28:48.420
It just it frightens the heck out of me that we are we are doing this and that old people are in in the same

28:48.740 --> 28:53.580
Situation that that really where did the maybe I didn't have it in that one. Sorry. Oh

28:55.020 --> 28:57.020
Yeah, it's here

28:57.020 --> 29:04.500
That old that old people are now in the same situation that a lot of young parents are in except about themselves young parents are often

29:04.700 --> 29:07.180
You can characterize it as being bullied

29:08.140 --> 29:14.060
Into accepting the vaccine schedule as it is and even if you ask to have a delayed a couple years you will be

29:14.940 --> 29:16.940
given a lot of heck for that

29:17.660 --> 29:19.660
Nevermind if you want to

29:19.660 --> 29:22.060
abstain from participating in it and so

29:23.260 --> 29:25.260
It's it's a real

29:27.020 --> 29:31.100
It's really it's really a devastating place that we're in right now if we are coercing

29:31.900 --> 29:37.700
And it's normal to coerce elderly or even older people 50 years old. I'm 50

29:37.700 --> 29:42.300
I should take two of those things then right that's what they would say and that's just crazy talk

29:42.300 --> 29:47.500
I mean I had chickenpox real bad when I was 13 years old. I ain't messing with that shit again

29:47.740 --> 29:51.100
So there I'm swearing. I got a chill out. I got a cool out

29:52.260 --> 29:56.460
But yeah, here we go. This is a study hall

29:56.860 --> 30:02.380
And I am going to put the playback speed up to 1.5 until otherwise noted

30:03.660 --> 30:05.660
and

30:05.660 --> 30:12.780
Yeah, let's see what Judy mikovitch has got mikovitch has to say about these things cannabinoids as stem cell and immune therapy

30:13.260 --> 30:16.060
It's interesting right that sounds pretty much like a catch-all

30:16.780 --> 30:20.940
Like cannabinoids could be used for almost anything in future medicine

30:21.340 --> 30:26.380
Which is a really exciting thing that might be some that might be a very good reason why some

30:26.460 --> 30:30.860
But he might want to sequence cannabinoid genomes and work on variants

30:31.740 --> 30:37.980
In cannabinoids, you know, like get in on the ground floor with regard to the genetics of canada cannabis

30:37.980 --> 30:41.180
That might be a really good reason to get in on that

30:41.980 --> 30:46.220
Get out of that action. So let's see what Judy's got to say about that

30:46.780 --> 30:54.620
Action well everyone. I welcome to today's live broadcast cannabis as immunotherapy for 21st century acquired immune deficiencies presented by

Welcome dr. Mikovitz. Thanks. Thanks so much. It's a delight to be here

32:02.620 --> 32:10.380
And talk about a really exciting topic as far as therapeutic potential for some of the most devastating diseases of our time

32:11.180 --> 32:13.180
And that's using cannabinoids

32:13.820 --> 32:16.140
as stem cell therapy and immune therapy

32:16.860 --> 32:18.860
So on that first slide

32:18.860 --> 32:25.260
There that you see ahead of you you see some of those diseases you see cancers a lot of hormone

32:26.220 --> 32:28.700
Sensitive cancers a lot of leukemia lymphoma

32:30.060 --> 32:37.500
Bladder cancers. These are these are cancers that that tend to respond to immune therapy. We also consider autoimmune diseases

32:38.460 --> 32:42.400
Lupus inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's disease polymyositis

32:43.500 --> 32:46.620
Syndrome Biches disease and primary biliary cirrhosis

32:47.020 --> 32:51.420
I think i'm already going to tap in here and suggest to you that this is already a list of

32:53.740 --> 32:58.140
Distractions and misnomers which are describing potential

32:58.780 --> 33:02.780
gene therapy side effects and vaccine side effects

33:03.740 --> 33:09.980
And so what we're looking at here is a list of things that happens with no explanation for why

33:10.620 --> 33:15.180
Nothing about the toxic environment and the toxic food that americans are given

33:15.660 --> 33:23.900
Nothing about the toxic lifestyle or the toxic environmental pollution that americans are exposed to and definitely not the toxic vaccine

33:23.980 --> 33:27.100
Schedule which i'm assuming in 2018

33:27.660 --> 33:33.260
Judy mikovitz is still totally and completely against right because it's not that long ago

33:33.260 --> 33:36.860
It's right before the pandemic. She must have been anti-vaccine already by now

33:39.340 --> 33:46.540
A chronic liver disease in the cns we think of myalgic encephalomyelitis skull for syndrome autism spectrum disorders

33:46.860 --> 33:49.500
ms parkinson's disease luke eric's disease

33:50.220 --> 33:52.380
on to the diseases which are

33:53.660 --> 33:55.660
Increasing in our world at

33:56.540 --> 34:03.500
It really extraordinary rates due to the environmental toxins in our world and interestingly as as we've learned

34:04.140 --> 34:06.140
only in the last two decades

34:06.460 --> 34:08.140
that are

34:08.140 --> 34:15.100
That are really diseases of the endo pinnabenoid system and and of stem cells where those toxins are

34:15.500 --> 34:22.140
Are affecting our immune system and the regulation of our immune system in really profound ways. So on the next slide

34:26.620 --> 34:31.660
On the next slide. I show a relatively recent paper review article

34:32.300 --> 34:35.260
from progress in lipid research and what this

34:35.820 --> 34:42.700
Review article talks about is is what we learned in in the early 90s the endo pinnabenoid system

34:43.420 --> 34:46.860
And how it's actually critical for stem cell development

34:47.740 --> 34:52.780
Really from the embryonic stem cell on and so what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about

34:53.420 --> 34:54.380
how

34:54.380 --> 35:01.740
The endo pinnabenoid system and the regulation of the endo pinnabenoid system is key to a healthy brain and a healthy immune system

35:02.300 --> 35:06.860
First of all, I want to make sure that everybody understands that they're they are going to

35:07.900 --> 35:09.420
confound

35:09.420 --> 35:15.820
the endo pinnabenoid system with cannabinoids as often as possible and it is a broad

35:17.500 --> 35:19.660
chemical family

35:19.660 --> 35:26.460
And you shouldn't assume that endo pinnabenoid receptors are all stimulated by cannabinoids and blah blah blah

35:26.460 --> 35:28.460
You shouldn't assume any of that

35:28.460 --> 35:31.180
Even though they're not going and I suspect

35:31.660 --> 35:36.620
She's not going to be very precise about this and in fact take advantage of that potential confusion

35:37.180 --> 35:40.140
and allow you and her listeners to

35:40.940 --> 35:45.020
Make as many of those assumptions as possible when she's talking about endo pinnabenoids

35:45.420 --> 35:46.940
She's also

35:46.940 --> 35:52.540
Implying because she's not saying it's not true implying that when you use cannabis that you can stimulate this

35:53.100 --> 35:56.860
System as well and so that's to a certain extent that's true

35:56.940 --> 35:59.900
But but you're missing the subtleties there of all the different

36:00.460 --> 36:06.380
You know chemical subcompounds and all you know and the receptor subtypes and all this other stuff that they know very well

36:07.020 --> 36:12.780
Individual people have studied these individual stories with individual mechanisms and so these are all

36:13.500 --> 36:20.460
Compartmentally well understood but to now we're going to misconstrue them as some kind of new way for us to

36:21.100 --> 36:28.860
You know sort of tap into the system as a whole and take advantage of something that we couldn't take advantage of before and I I think this

36:30.300 --> 36:33.820
This is essentially what what this talk is going to be about trying to

36:34.460 --> 36:37.740
Sell you on the idea that there is potent biologically

36:38.300 --> 36:40.300
there is so much potential for

36:41.260 --> 36:45.180
Cannabis produced cannabinoids to be designed

36:47.340 --> 36:51.260
To be used as immune modulators. They don't intend to grow pot

36:51.980 --> 37:00.380
They intend to use pot to to produce compounds that they can then identify and and synthetically synthesize

37:01.180 --> 37:03.420
I have they have no intention of using

37:04.380 --> 37:06.780
marijuana as a source

37:07.740 --> 37:10.300
Like like to use it as medicine or

37:10.620 --> 37:15.500
Consume it as medicine but to extract from it or to identify within it

37:15.980 --> 37:20.780
Compounds that can be made synthetically to use as medicine. So it's very different

37:22.380 --> 37:24.380
Couple things there anyway that are very different

37:25.020 --> 37:31.500
I know this paper is open access. So it's available to a lot of the audience and I've adapted or taken figures directly from

37:32.380 --> 37:37.580
This this paper and added some of our own as shown on slide three

37:38.380 --> 37:43.820
So so I would challenge you to go to mark's website and look up at the bottom of her her page

37:44.700 --> 37:50.220
Look up her resume because she does not have any problem getting employment

37:51.260 --> 37:53.260
Okay, so

37:53.820 --> 38:00.460
And and she doesn't not get good employment. It's not like she's worked at a basket robins because she can't be a scientist anymore

38:01.740 --> 38:03.260
and so

38:03.260 --> 38:05.260
There's a limited amount of

38:05.260 --> 38:07.980
Suffering that she's had and certainly in this

38:08.860 --> 38:14.060
In at this time in 2018. She's very gainfully employed from at least two different companies

38:14.540 --> 38:15.500
So

38:15.500 --> 38:23.020
And nevermind that also perhaps also advising investment firms, which appears also on her resume in various places

38:23.420 --> 38:24.940
stem cell level

38:24.940 --> 38:31.420
In the endocannabinoid system, there's really um cannabinoid receptor one and cannabinoid receptor two

38:32.060 --> 38:37.980
You see here in the lower part of the screen. Those are shown as these channel like receptors

38:38.060 --> 38:41.020
These are um deep protein coupled receptors

38:41.260 --> 38:45.660
And so they have um they they cross the membrane say six or seven times

38:45.900 --> 38:51.100
And the signal is occur and changes can occur in the loops and they have crossed off with many many

38:51.260 --> 38:55.740
Coupled receptors for signaling both in the brain and in the immune system

38:56.380 --> 39:00.940
What we've learned so a deep protein coupled receptor for those people who do not know

39:01.340 --> 39:03.340
um, this is

39:03.340 --> 39:05.340
What's that why didn't that work?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.780
Oh, no, sorry. That was not the right one. Um

39:09.500 --> 39:11.020
Yes, it is

39:11.020 --> 39:14.380
It's definitely the right one. Why didn't that work? This is not on

39:14.380 --> 39:16.380
Oh

39:17.500 --> 39:21.660
It wasn't on um g protein coupled receptors are different than

39:22.860 --> 39:24.060
a

39:24.060 --> 39:29.580
a let's say an ionic receptor and ionophore or something that just opens and allows things in

39:30.300 --> 39:31.420
um

39:31.420 --> 39:33.500
So you might have

39:33.500 --> 39:39.180
A couple different kinds of receptors just to think about things in general, right? There's receptors on the membrane

39:39.740 --> 39:41.740
That for example might gate

39:42.300 --> 39:45.100
The flow of things across the membrane

39:45.660 --> 39:52.540
And so if they do that, they might have an agonist that binds to them and then these proteins will change configuration

39:53.180 --> 39:54.940
to allow

39:54.940 --> 40:02.380
like an ion to transfer from one side of the membrane to another but a g protein coupled receptor is actually a

40:03.260 --> 40:05.260
a

40:05.660 --> 40:08.860
A receptor that has a number of subunits on it

40:09.500 --> 40:12.860
and there are g proteins are are these

40:14.220 --> 40:21.100
Like cyclic amp is usually these the messenger that they use so when the agonist binds the receptor

40:21.900 --> 40:26.780
Um, then a similar conformational change occurs, but then that allows

40:27.500 --> 40:31.660
uh cyclic amp to be released and it's a very local signal

40:32.300 --> 40:36.060
But that cyclic amp could open an ion channel

40:36.620 --> 40:41.020
That allows something in just like this one like this one did it could it could open

40:41.660 --> 40:46.780
That channel it could open many channels. It could also have downstream effects of causing

40:47.660 --> 40:50.780
gene expression and all kinds of other things as essentially

40:51.660 --> 40:57.100
Um a black box after the activation of g protein of a g protein coupled receptor

40:57.100 --> 41:01.740
They would like to tell you the story cyclic amp etc, but it's a cascade

41:02.540 --> 41:08.700
And so we don't have a very good idea of all the things that happen downstream from g protein coupled receptors

41:09.180 --> 41:15.820
because these these actions after agonist binding can have different timescales and

41:16.220 --> 41:23.500
Depending on the cell type can have very different ramifications depending on what happens after the initial activation here

41:25.260 --> 41:28.540
um, so a g protein coupled receptors kind of cool because

41:29.260 --> 41:34.700
Um, it could have a number of different effects on both a long a short-term effect could be

41:35.340 --> 41:39.260
That sodium comes in through channels, but a long-term effect could be

41:39.820 --> 41:43.900
Gene expression or actin skeleton remodeling or something like that

41:44.380 --> 41:47.180
And that's very different than a receptor which is

41:47.980 --> 41:53.980
Exclusively an ion channel opened and closed by the presence of the agonist or blocked by a toxin

41:54.620 --> 41:55.580
Um

41:55.660 --> 42:02.860
So that's interesting because if endocannabinoids are all g protein coupled receptors then even when we think we can activate them

42:02.860 --> 42:11.340
We we would still be much farther from understanding the consequences of their activation because it is not only the acute direct

42:11.820 --> 42:13.820
effects of ion

42:13.980 --> 42:17.660
Transfer or or proton pumping or something like that

42:18.140 --> 42:24.140
But rather it is downstream effects activated by cyclic amp and other second messengers inside of the cell

42:24.540 --> 42:26.780
That result from the activation of the receptor

42:27.180 --> 42:31.580
So it can can result in very very much bigger changes as well

42:32.060 --> 42:35.020
So it's not to say that that this isn't significant. It's to say

42:35.740 --> 42:40.700
That the complicated mechanisms that underlie the signaling of cannabinoid receptors

42:41.100 --> 42:45.100
Cannot be underestimated and when she says it's a g protein coupled receptor

42:45.500 --> 42:48.220
That's like the very very tip of the iceberg of that

42:48.780 --> 42:53.100
Complexity most of which we can't really adequately characterize. I hope I said that well

42:53.660 --> 43:01.020
Recently is the hematopoietic stem cell, which is the stem cell that's involved in your in the development of all of the lineages

43:01.340 --> 43:06.460
In your blood shown on this slide. We're showing. I'm showing you the myeloid lineage. That's um

43:07.100 --> 43:11.980
The megacariocytes the erythrocytes red blood cells mass cells myeloblast

43:12.540 --> 43:15.740
On the right hand side. I the figure wasn't long enough for this slide

43:15.740 --> 43:21.340
I just show also the base of field neutrophils eosinophils and critically the monocyte macrophage

43:21.500 --> 43:24.940
Which we're going to talk a lot about today the myeloid cells

43:25.580 --> 43:33.500
And and hematopoiesis of the myeloid cells. This is really your innate immune response your frontline defense from all of the toxins

43:33.740 --> 43:38.620
Um in our environment in our world not just so see she's saying it too complicated

43:38.620 --> 43:43.740
She wants you to the the myeloid cells the macrophages and the dendritic cells

43:44.460 --> 43:49.980
The hematopoiesis of these cells. Why does she use the word hematopoiesis?

43:51.580 --> 43:56.940
Why can't she just say that when these cells are in development hematopoiesis? Why not?

43:57.740 --> 43:59.740
Do I not define it?

44:00.780 --> 44:03.020
Again because I think this is a rehearsed

44:03.580 --> 44:07.900
Very carefully chosen set of words to bamboozle to make sure

44:08.460 --> 44:10.860
That if she lists all these words fast enough

44:10.860 --> 44:16.140
There's no way that you're going to notice that common is spelled wrong in her in her slides

44:16.460 --> 44:19.740
There's no way you're going to notice that that this is just uh

44:21.820 --> 44:26.620
An overwhelming set of data designed to get you to accept the conclusion slide

44:27.660 --> 44:32.780
Um, not just um environmental toxins, but including things like um viruses

44:33.420 --> 44:42.300
Um our expertise is in retroviruses and our work at epigenetics is is all about how retroviruses change the expression of genes and not the dna

44:42.300 --> 44:50.220
Or and including at the dna level, but primarily the expression of genes and this is one mechanisms how they cause diseases by so 2018

44:50.220 --> 44:56.220
She's still working for epigenetics. I don't think that that's really in her resume that mark has on his website

44:56.220 --> 45:01.500
I want to I want to look deeper into that, but this is 2018 and she's still talking like we

45:02.220 --> 45:05.820
Epigenetics, which is again a company that looks at

45:06.380 --> 45:16.460
Uh, epigenetic changes resulting in cancer and other other conditions. So, um, you're essentially dealing with somebody who is interested in sequencing everything

45:16.860 --> 45:21.580
You're dealing with somebody who is using blood samples to look for bloodborne markers of

45:22.300 --> 45:25.020
Of chronic fatigue syndrome for many many years

45:25.500 --> 45:31.500
Not that dissimilar from looking for bloodborne markers of other diseases like that blonde lady with the dark hair

45:31.980 --> 45:36.940
With the with the deep voice was doing before they before they discredited her as a fraud

45:38.860 --> 45:40.620
Just saying

45:40.620 --> 45:44.220
It's not like this is uh, obviously anti-vax talk where we're

45:45.020 --> 45:51.020
Where she is fighting for us to not believe in in the public health system or to doubt tony fauci here

45:53.260 --> 45:55.420
This is right now talking about how

45:56.460 --> 46:02.460
Canabenoids regulate the essential developmental processes of all blood cells and the amion system

46:05.260 --> 46:11.980
Disregulating, um, the, uh, hematopoietic stem cell and what you get is an accelerated aging

46:12.140 --> 46:17.660
Where we see cancers in those auto immune and neuro immune diseases on the first slide in younger

46:17.900 --> 46:20.380
I mean accelerated aging is what what

46:22.220 --> 46:27.820
Walter chestnut has been going on about the spike protein was going to do for like four years now

46:28.540 --> 46:31.740
and certainly going on and on about the transfections

46:32.700 --> 46:36.060
advancing aging and destroying mitochondria and

46:36.620 --> 46:38.140
And

46:38.140 --> 46:41.580
It's in it's incredible that this is 2018

46:41.580 --> 46:49.980
They're essentially seeding the narrative of the damage that will be done by the coming vaccine scheduled by coming counter measures by coming

46:51.660 --> 46:53.660
genetic technologies

46:56.380 --> 46:58.380
I don't understand

46:58.620 --> 47:02.780
Who judy mikovitz is but I do know from mark's work

47:03.420 --> 47:08.860
That it's hard to explain why the two people who came out and first published papers about her

47:09.500 --> 47:12.060
Data likely being fraudulent are dead

47:13.740 --> 47:20.540
It's weird that all of this stuff has to do with aids and vaccines. You could imagine a scenario

47:22.060 --> 47:23.660
credit to mark

47:23.660 --> 47:24.780
where

47:24.780 --> 47:31.660
The xm rv story was actually going to be queued up teed up as a way of pivoting from

47:32.780 --> 47:35.980
vaccine preparation to new methods like transfection

47:38.140 --> 47:39.100
But

47:39.100 --> 47:41.100
Unwitting non participating

47:41.980 --> 47:49.100
Biologists in the field said hey, this looks like bullshit and the story had to be changed. It had to be dealt with

47:51.740 --> 47:54.220
And now we have a different judy

47:55.420 --> 47:57.100
And twin

47:57.100 --> 48:02.860
Do you know the judy mikovitz just like jessica rose she has a twin too. It doesn't that eat didn't that meet

48:03.740 --> 48:06.460
Not twins are cool younger populations

48:06.940 --> 48:15.740
Driven by this somatopoietic stem cell. So what what this paper shows now is that in fact this cb2 endocannabinoid receptor

48:16.540 --> 48:22.860
Is is involved in the development of essentially every lineage of the myeloid

48:23.180 --> 48:27.260
Amatopoietic stem cell that it's involved in those diseases that I showed

48:27.900 --> 48:36.540
On the on the first slide if you notice the asterisks on the first slide what we were looking at is diseases associated with activated

48:37.260 --> 48:49.580
Macrophages activated micro glia cells in the brain. Um, so so now we know that there there's a primary disposition towards cb2 and the hematopoietic stem cell

48:50.380 --> 48:54.940
And that dysregulation of of these responses in these myeloid progenitors

48:55.660 --> 49:00.780
Is can be causal for these diseases and that we can reverse these diseases with

49:02.300 --> 49:09.820
With phytocannabinoids and modulating our endogenous produced cannabinoids on the next slide. We see that

49:10.700 --> 49:17.820
We continue to look at how the cb2 is associated with chronic inflammation of the nervous system

49:17.820 --> 49:23.820
Which is somewhat paradoxical and because in fact from the mesenchymal stems

49:23.820 --> 49:31.260
I'll shown on the left side of the slide. We see that the cb1 receptor that can have the canonical cannabinoid receptor number one

49:31.660 --> 49:33.420
Another g protein link

49:33.420 --> 49:38.220
signal its shown in blue and cb2 is shown in red for convenience is is actually

49:38.940 --> 49:45.820
Controls the development of neurons. So then development of neurons the development of a dipocytes bat set

49:45.820 --> 49:48.300
It's hard really to take this at face value

49:48.380 --> 49:51.580
You have to I just want to help you to see what I see here

49:51.980 --> 49:57.020
When somebody says that cannabinoid receptor one controls the development of neurons

49:57.020 --> 50:02.460
What they really mean is that if you mess around with it you can mess around with neuronal development of course

50:03.020 --> 50:11.020
She can't possibly mean that the development of neurons is controlled by a single receptor because that would be absurd

50:11.500 --> 50:15.500
Yet just like a lot of academic biologists that are still

50:16.140 --> 50:20.380
Not really teaching anybody including themselves the broad

50:20.940 --> 50:28.460
Sacred biology in which they operate she is not helping you understand that this is obviously infinitely more

50:29.100 --> 50:32.380
Complex than cannabinoid receptors controlling development

50:33.100 --> 50:35.100
And

50:35.100 --> 50:41.420
Yet they will continue to do this all biologists will continue to do it that are trained in this method of

50:42.380 --> 50:48.780
Creating a very sharp and narrow question that is so sharp and narrow that it actually doesn't even

50:49.660 --> 50:53.420
purport to validate the model that it purports to be a part of

50:53.580 --> 50:55.580
And

50:57.020 --> 51:03.260
So if you say that cannabinoid receptor one is involved in neuronal development

51:04.940 --> 51:09.740
What do you really mean? Well, she's saying that the receptor expression goes up

51:10.700 --> 51:12.700
Okay

51:13.740 --> 51:18.940
Peripheration is stopped by cannabinoids one over here and differentiation occurs

51:19.420 --> 51:25.740
So what can you increase differentiation? Is that stimulation required? Is it part of a suite of stimulations?

51:26.220 --> 51:31.100
Most of which have not even been identified never been manipulated in an experimental setting

51:33.740 --> 51:38.140
How many receptors are in neurons that we don't even have an even identified yet

51:38.380 --> 51:49.820
Don't take this at its words understand that this is the opposite of presenting you

51:50.300 --> 51:56.700
The complexity the irreducible complexity of the immune system the irreducible complexity of the development of the brain

51:58.220 --> 51:59.980
To simplify

51:59.980 --> 52:04.700
Down to cannabinoid receptors one and cannabinoid receptors two and how

52:05.180 --> 52:09.100
Finding substances which can stimulate those two might be fun

52:10.540 --> 52:13.180
Because of all this stuff that they're involved in

52:16.460 --> 52:19.980
Bells, pre and besides and and bone formation

52:20.300 --> 52:28.940
So that's somewhat paradoxical in thinking about that because if if I had on those slides cancers that metastasized to the bone

52:29.100 --> 52:33.020
And are primarily bone cancers such as multiple myeloma

52:33.980 --> 52:39.100
And in prostate cancer, which are two diseases in which bone formation is dysregulated

52:39.420 --> 52:46.220
So you see there on the left hand side though. The proteol osteoblasts is regulated by cannabinoid receptor number one

52:46.940 --> 52:50.060
and involved in in rankle is the receptor of

52:50.620 --> 52:57.260
NF Kappa B activation of NF. I mean isn't the implication here that you know way too much cannabinoid useful

52:57.740 --> 53:03.980
Will cause your your neurons to develop funny and your your bone resorption to go wrong and

53:04.540 --> 53:06.860
All of this stuff to go haywire. Isn't that

53:08.620 --> 53:13.020
Shouldn't that be the first question that's on your mind? How did all these hippies not just die?

53:13.740 --> 53:18.380
If everything in the body that's interesting is regulated by endocannabinoid one or two

53:18.380 --> 53:20.380
I

53:22.380 --> 53:27.660
Hope you're starting to see now what's happening here how this is done in academia where you try to take

53:28.380 --> 53:32.540
A story and conflate it to be the most important story to be told

53:33.980 --> 53:36.460
And what it does from the perspective of getting money

53:37.020 --> 53:42.300
What it does from the perspective of telling a story that's kind of I guess entertaining and singly focused

53:43.020 --> 53:47.100
but in no way shape or form acknowledges never mind tries to

53:48.060 --> 53:52.700
Pay any reverence to the irreducible complexity that all of these people are up against

53:53.100 --> 53:57.820
Applebee ligand and NF Kappa B, which we'll discuss in a moment is really key to

53:58.300 --> 54:01.580
Inflammatory responses and inflammation that drives

54:02.220 --> 54:05.900
In fact the breakdown of the proteol osteoclasts

54:06.220 --> 54:12.380
So what you see is you get osteoclasts favoring over osteoblasts that you're breaking down the bone progenitors

54:12.860 --> 54:15.980
And you're actually getting bone resort of resorption

54:16.460 --> 54:24.460
So we see in these cancers and in these diseases and of course osteoporosis in women of younger and younger ages driven by

54:25.180 --> 54:27.580
You know, it's now it's still a theory

54:27.580 --> 54:31.740
But driven by these interactions is the theory that we're working on in developing

54:32.140 --> 54:37.500
Therapeutics two months and so the problem with this model is how the hell do you test it?

54:38.460 --> 54:45.420
What kind of predictions does this model make? Are there predictions in the future that we can then verify using a measurement?

54:47.900 --> 54:52.140
That's what broken science is all about exposing this nonsense for what it is

54:52.140 --> 54:56.940
This is not a model and if it is a model, is it a model you intend to test?

54:58.300 --> 55:00.300
Absolutely not it's a model you assume

55:01.820 --> 55:05.020
Your experiments actually do not test this model

55:05.100 --> 55:09.580
They're not verifying it and you're not using this model to make any predictions

55:11.100 --> 55:16.620
You're collecting data to verify whether the parts of this model conform to data in the past

55:17.020 --> 55:22.060
You never make any predictions and they will never make any predictions because that's not how

55:22.620 --> 55:24.620
This kind of pseudoscience is done

55:24.780 --> 55:30.220
Ontulate the topic of this discussion. So on the right on the in the middle of the slide you can see how

55:31.100 --> 55:37.900
Red arrows blocking the the breakdown of the proteo osteo class and encouraging the build up and

55:38.140 --> 55:47.500
Development and lineage commitment to the osteoblasts and the bone formation is is critical is driven by blocking the cb1 receptor blocking

55:48.060 --> 55:53.820
And promoting I mean if this was done correctly you would drop these arrows in one at a time

55:53.900 --> 55:59.980
And every time you drop the arrows in there would be a little bibliography that would scroll past saying that these are the flabs that tested this

56:00.540 --> 56:05.020
And showed that mason chymal stem cells are inhibited by cb1 receptors

56:05.500 --> 56:13.180
In certain conditions in certain and every one of these steps would need to be explained in such a way so that we could really evaluate to what extent

56:13.260 --> 56:20.540
This part of this model cartoon is worth paying attention to holding in our mind or trying to mesh like a gear

56:20.940 --> 56:25.260
With some of these other things so that we can start to get a working model of how this system works

56:25.580 --> 56:31.500
But there's already 16 gears on this page and so no matter how good your your imagination is

56:31.500 --> 56:35.580
I don't care if you're nickel at tesla. You can't test this model in your head. You just can't

56:37.500 --> 56:43.260
And they can't test it with a simple experiment either using reductionist biological techniques. You can't do it

56:44.220 --> 56:46.220
Tan side where a cb2

56:47.020 --> 56:53.100
Is um is driving both it's directly activating the osteoplasts through a mechanism with the question mark

56:53.100 --> 56:58.060
We still don't know because that cb2 receptor hasn't necessarily been identified

56:58.540 --> 57:02.380
On that cell and and we have some ideas that we'll discuss in the next few slides

57:02.620 --> 57:05.500
Um, and that's why the question mark for the top arrow at arrow

57:05.500 --> 57:09.020
But we absolutely know when the cb1 receptor and cb2

57:09.820 --> 57:14.700
Cross talk interacts where the weight of the balance is I show on the left hand side

57:15.020 --> 57:18.060
It's not a honor off switch, but really a gradient

57:18.300 --> 57:23.580
So I look at um the endocannabinoid system as a dimmer switch on the immune system

57:23.740 --> 57:26.220
Really a master regulator at many different levels

57:26.300 --> 57:32.540
But via the stem cell via the mesenchymal stem cell via the amount of poetics stem cell and how it's a gradient

57:32.540 --> 57:37.900
So the more receptor that is expressed as it's up regulated the more you'll get the bad accumulation

57:37.980 --> 57:45.500
We can also think in our society about how the bad accumulation of metabolism is changing in in our teenagers and our young adults

57:45.820 --> 57:53.020
Um, you know through the dysregulation of this system. So one of the recent discoveries, um big discovery shown on the next slide

57:53.340 --> 57:58.220
Um, so the dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system is also causing kids to get fat

57:59.340 --> 58:00.380
Wow

58:00.380 --> 58:07.020
Is that that question mark may be addressed in a paper by brian gardener in his colleagues

58:07.260 --> 58:12.620
And that is that tetra hydro cannabinoid, which is the psychoactive t hc

58:13.180 --> 58:17.180
In medical marijuana actually turns on cb2

58:17.900 --> 58:22.060
Driving that g protein coupled receptor to breakdown atp

58:22.140 --> 58:27.420
This is called purinergic signaling where where atp is broken down into cyclic amp

58:27.900 --> 58:35.420
This activates the expression of a critical master regulator of chromatopoietic stem cells and stem cells in general

58:35.420 --> 58:38.700
Known as transforming growth factor beta or t so see here

58:39.020 --> 58:42.940
This is one of those cartoons where here you see a g protein coupled receptor

58:43.740 --> 58:46.940
G protein is now decreasing cyclic amp so

58:47.580 --> 58:53.820
Depending on the cell type depending on the context it can increase cyclic amp decrease cyclic amp

58:54.300 --> 58:59.020
And then those signals can be can result in expression of different proteins

58:59.100 --> 59:06.460
And so the the interesting thing about the cannabinoid system and indeed any g protein coupled system is that again

59:07.260 --> 59:08.780
like a

59:08.780 --> 59:14.620
A muscarinic receptor or a a muscarinic receptor is a subtype of a nicotinic receptor

59:15.020 --> 59:20.300
Where acetylcholine can bind and there are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors in general

59:20.380 --> 59:25.900
There's a nicotinic receptor, which is an ion channel and then a g protein coupled nicotinic receptor

59:26.300 --> 59:32.620
I'm sorry muscarinic receptor and they call it a muscarinic receptor because it is blocked by muscarin now are stimulated by muscarin

59:33.260 --> 59:37.660
So anyway, the point is is that depending on where those

59:38.700 --> 59:39.900
those

59:39.900 --> 59:41.900
G protein coupled receptors are

59:43.020 --> 59:45.020
And on what neuron?

59:45.100 --> 59:50.140
A muscarinic channel in some neurons could increase cyclic amp and increase

59:51.340 --> 59:57.420
Nmda channels in the membrane. It could change the mobility of actin membrane in a spine

59:57.900 --> 59:59.420
Um

59:59.420 --> 01:00:05.260
There's lots of possibilities with again with a g protein coupled receptor and that's why I think it's interesting here to note

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:11.580
That every one of these receptors and every one of those contexts would need to be characterized in this way

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:17.900
And you would never have a definitive answer. Is this the only thing that happens when cb do the cb

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.500
cannabinoid receptor 2 in lymphocytes is stimulated

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.540
So again, we're really at the very very very

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.340
beginning of this whole thing

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.860
And understanding cannabinoid receptors and

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.980
cannabinoid receptor variants between people

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.820
All of this stuff is going to be important because cb

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:43.260
cannabinoid 2 receptor in you is different than me and so that's uh, this is this is all

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.900
Just

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.540
Any the other half of mark ink. It's my commits and resetting consulting here and and dr

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.900
Aseti

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:59.020
More than 25 years ago was the scientists who made the discovery that tgf beta acts on the stem cell as a

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:04.380
Bifunctional regulator of hematophoresis. That means it can go both ways

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:09.740
Tgf beta can be a really good general in in regulating immune responses

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:16.780
A good soldier or a bad general. So if if if if if a pathway is on tgf beta can turn it off

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.860
in as far as the immune system and if the pathway is off tgf beta

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:27.660
Turns it on so it has both autocrine back on itself back on the stem cell to maintain the stem cells

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.940
Thalness and paracrine to develop those effector lineages. I showed on that first slide

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:39.420
So critical critical regulator and here we have thc. That's you know been really outlawed

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.540
in our in our world for

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:49.260
More than 70 years and and it's critical so cannabinoid formulations without thc

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:55.180
Actually cannot regulate and cure diseases and in these therapies can be curative

01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:02.940
But you really can't spell health care without thc. So it's thc dependent and we have to think about formulations

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.660
driving the cb2

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.460
Interestingly enough the psychoactive effects of thc are are mediated through

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.940
That cb1 receptor which I showed here on the last slide

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:24.860
So it's those neurons and um that are are driven by thc because of course there's cross talk between the two receptors

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:31.980
So so it's a it's a question of balance really but interestingly enough if we can develop and we're working to develop

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:39.740
cb2 agonists that don't interact with cb1 that block that interaction and then you don't have the psychotropic effect

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.740
um that is um

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.540
um such a problem with with using these therapeutically

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:49.820
Now that we can use them to still regulate the critical hematopoietic component

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.140
So the next slide I show in some

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:56.780
Respect that to go back to our first slide and think about what's causing

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:02.380
the autoimmune neuroimmune and and um acquired immune deficiencies of our time

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:09.260
Well, our expertise is in HIV aids and the reason I call these 21st century acquired immune deficiencies

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.260
Because of course there's not HIV in all of these diseases

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.300
But in every disease on the first slide where I showed an asterisk

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:21.500
There's a retroviral component and um and we won't go into retrovirus biology

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.540
But what we know is that in our treatment

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.020
So she's saying there's a viral component in all of those things which I think is definitely

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.740
definitely sketch

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.500
um and so it seems like the broad stick

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.260
of

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.700
Judy mikovitz is that there are more viruses than we are told

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.380
That are to be found in more places than we are told

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.420
Causing more pain and suffering than we are told

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:56.060
And she definitely doesn't question the existence of a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.020
That probably came from a laboratory that was doing gave a function

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.100
you see

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.620
And at the beginning of the pandemic before the pandemic even started before it was anybody anybody's radar

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.180
She was already out there

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.940
Telling us that there would be this new 21st century

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:23.100
acquired immune deficiency syndromes that don't all have aids viruses in them even though

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.820
A lot of the people that she's worked with have worked with the aids people

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.820
Like lots of papers with gallo

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.860
Directly connected to gallo

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.100
Remember that gallows

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:44.940
Like buddy muri gardener was robert melones postdoc supervisor. This is a weird

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.900
tiny little group of people

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:53.340
Connected through a tiny little group of connected people all connected to the same

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.380
Kind of parallel bullshit stories

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.780
I

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:04.300
Don't know the truth about hiv, but i'm pretty sure it's not a virus that came from bushmeat

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.260
Brett Weinstein

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:14.460
I don't know the story about polio vaccines, but i'm pretty sure it had a lot more to do with sanitation and

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.580
pesticides and stuff like that

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.620
And with regard to this talk

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.500
And the discussion of

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:32.300
21st century acquired immune deficiency syndromes that don't all include the aids virus. I think she's more or less seeding

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.180
She's seeding the narrative of flying aids remember that's what

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.300
Paul cottrell and those other people have been calling

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.580
Coronavirus, it's it's flying aids. It's an acquired immune deficiency syndrome

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:51.900
How many times have you heard it? They have been seeding the narrative of novel sources of an acquired immune

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.820
Deficiency system

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:58.780
Syndrome for a few years now so that long covid could be confounded with it

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.300
And so that covid could be confounded with it ladies and gentlemen

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:07.740
And they knew all along that they were seeding a narrative that would protect genetic vaccines

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.220
genetic

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:15.820
Genetic technologies they were they've been protecting them from the beginning and it takes a while

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.580
That's why this talk is from 2018

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580
And

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:28.940
Not saying anything about the vaccine schedule of uh in the development of have actually curative therapies for hiv

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:35.660
Which dr. Said and I participated in at the national cancer institute in the 80s and in 90s those therapies

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:41.420
Included at some level cannabis and so this the the people that survived

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:48.940
And and and thrived with hiv were the ones that were using cannabinoids along with the anti retroviral therapies

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:56.220
Which we developed in our laboratory and of course because of the stigma and and the legal problems with using it that that really wasn't known

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.780
At that time and we've only recently known that

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.980
So what we knew about cannabinoids is that they were antiviral and they reduce inflammation

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:11.100
Because we see that blocking arrow on the right side so lps is uh lipopolysaccharide and it's on bacteria

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.660
So bacteria and polyic mimics an RNA virus infection

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.860
So RNA viruses are your flu viruses your

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.820
hiv your retroviruses

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.660
Your ebola your zika. These are all RNA viruses

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.460
So probably i see mimics the activation of these all RNA viruses

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:35.660
They're all RNA viruses and what do they have in common rna cannot pandemic

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:42.940
And yet she lists all the viruses that these people responded to they're all the same small little family of

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:49.260
Of outbreak specialists. Malone was on that list. She's on that list hat fills on that list

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.820
Meryl nasa's on that list all these people are involved in this little list

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.300
zika

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.300
ebola

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.700
Right. They're all in there somewhere complaining about that stuff at some point in time

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.020
And for decades already for decades already

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:13.900
When I was playing cyber ball

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.060
At at the at at at oakwood mall and and ochlear, I mean

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.340
These guys were already working on this

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:31.020
Making sure that this virology as a field would be just impenetrable

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
and

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:43.340
Undifferentiable from a from a program that was just outright testing biological technologies on its population

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.340
indistinguishable

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.340
From a biotechnology

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.060
National security priority that was looking for background signals

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.820
That could be used and misconstrued as spread

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.100
Characterizing background signals that they knew they were going to use

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.900
as spread

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.660
as evidence of

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.620
Even more viruses in the background than before

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.420
They all seem to have the basic same basic story here

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.140
Now we're talking again about something

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:22.300
and we're we're misconstruing the activation of the immune response by a bacterial protein

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.900
with the

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.340
the activation of the response to a virus and

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.300
Without without giving adequate explanation for why those two can be parallels

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.820
It's impressive

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.780
And then these pathways that that generate type 1 interferons which are

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:43.420
Curative for retroviruses almost all retroviruses and RNA viruses

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:52.300
Actually tend to block this type 1 interferon pathway and we use type 1 interferons interferon alpha interferon beta as immune therapy

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.660
In that disease I highlighted known as primary biliary cirrhosis

01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.220
Which is actually associated with a retrovirus known as human beta retrovirus

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.500
So here we have and we know with HIV and hepatitis

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.940
That's another disease she says is associated with yet another virus

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.540
You see in various um liver diseases which are driven by um hepatitis B as a para retrovirus

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:16.380
That means it has components of retroviruses and DNA retroviruses

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.500
We use interferons as therapy. So here now we have

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:26.220
An cannabinoids which are able to drive block these pro inflammatory mediators, which are so important

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:32.700
For driving the disease process. It's the chronic inflammation and the chronic activation

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:38.460
Of the monocyte lineage of that myeloid lineage which we discussed and we'll discuss a little a lot more today

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:43.740
That is driving the disease processed in HIV associated dementias

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.220
Um, we knew it had nothing to do with virus copy numbers. So

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.380
Patients who were on anti retroviral therapy and had

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.860
Non-detectable levels of HIV

01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:02.060
Still had a dementia and could develop diseases that look like early Alzheimer's disease that look like park and cineans

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:06.780
And multiple sclerosis diseases and those are diseases that have all been associated

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:14.300
But you don't need expression in the virus and it's the idea that we're driving these inflammatory mediators and and stopping the

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.580
Interferon responses in in that way and this is where right in the middle of it

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:27.420
The cannabinoids modulating that cb2 receptor are critical and actually curative if you drive it in the other direction

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.500
So the next slide shows you a little bit more of that neural protection

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:36.780
So we've talked about cannabinoids either phyto or endogenous those made by your body

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:43.180
Being actually neuroprotective so therapeutics where you drive the neural protection through those

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:51.420
Central mediators, but I show here in this slide critically. There are antioxidant cannabinoids and I show in the on the left hand side

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.540
it's going through a factor known as um

01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:01.900
A rithroid factor to the nuclear rithroid factor to and that factor is is a key pathway

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.420
It's a transcription factor in a pathway that is really key to sleep

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.060
As you see it it drives the production

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:13.660
It's upstream of the production of superoxide dismutase, which is a key liver enzyme for

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.460
detoxing at the level of the liver and in

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:20.140
Mutations and alterations genetically and epigenetically

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:24.780
Silencing sod is critical to the development of Lou Gehrig's disease

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:31.020
So these are the familial als and parkinsonians disease have a have a problem with making enough

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:38.380
Superoxide dismutase or have dysfunctional enzyme at that level. So these antioxidant cannabinoids

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:46.300
Actually, don't signal through cv1 or cv2 and we're unsure of what that of what the cross talk is and what the receptors are

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:52.060
But no matter because they're lipid mediators and your membrane is shown here as lipid bilayers

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.500
They go right through these lipids um cannabinoids or lipids and they go right through they stimulate and are up to

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:02.380
Increase superoxide dismutase synthesis and decrease these

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:07.420
Dounding brain damaging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:13.420
So we all know about the antioxidants and so pro oxidation and oxidative stress

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:21.820
It's known as is a key contributor to every disease on that first slide and particularly the neurological diseases. So it is those

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.540
It's it's these pathways here

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
That are really important for

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.660
Turn off animals

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.660
Are critically important for neural protection and neural inflammatory diseases

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:40.700
So we can see the intersection right at that level for for the neural protection

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.980
We also see introduced on the left hand side that the

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:51.660
Not endogenous cannabinoids and cv1 agonists whether they be phyto cannabinoids other terpenes or synthetic

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:57.580
um cv1 modulators are important for regulating brain derived neurotropic factor

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:02.860
That's really a key neurotropic factor for developing new the development of new neurons

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:10.940
So we the the key discovery here in the last um two decades since the um since the endogenous cannabinoid system

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:18.220
Was discovered that we actually make and respond to cannabinoid molecules and they're critical to all of our development of both the brain and

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.980
The immune system we can actually develop new brain cells

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:27.100
We can actually drive through cv1 agonist and endogenous cannabinoids

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:33.420
Neurogenesis, so that's really key to any of the diseases I showed like ALS

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:39.580
Multiple sclerosis the demyelating diseases this actually shows the capacity to remyelinate to form

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:45.340
New neurons and and and so far i'm not hearing a lot of downsides about weed, but

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.980
You know, I'm not hearing a lot either. I mean it's a lot of word salad

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.500
But there's lots of good things about stimulating the cannabinoid system

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:03.180
Um, I don't think I disagree but again in general, right? We're talking about a very complex system. That's why

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.180
you know

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.780
Teenagers and young people that use extremely strong marijuana that are

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.020
Already susceptible to depression or skits of Renee or any of these other conditions that we don't know very much about

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.900
You can tip over into that attractor state

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.420
And so when you when you

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:27.420
You know, you make all these different claims about what's going on. These are just a very small tiny part

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.540
Right, it's the tip of the iceberg of what this system does and how it works and

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:38.620
How local versus systemic this signaling is and and what is affected by regular

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.940
Cannabis use and how the body remodels those receptors remodels their expression in order to

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:50.780
Tolerate or compensate for that being present in the system. So again

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.980
We're talking about a million variables that are personal

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:03.260
And we're simplifying down to a few arrows and a few pluses and minuses or reds and blue arrows up and down

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.540
And the only real argument she's making is that

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.340
Canabinoids are interesting because they're everywhere the receptors are everywhere

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:18.940
They're involved in development and the immune system and the brain and everything that we are we think is important

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:24.780
They're ubiquitous throughout the body. So what great that's interesting, but

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:31.660
Again selling it as though this is the new be all end all is what I find most intriguing

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.820
Really be cured of therapies for things even like autism spectrum disorders, um, which are

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:44.780
In this family of myaltic encephalomyelitis that's inflammation of the brain and the muscles and adults

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.500
They call it ME CFS and in in children

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.060
They they end up with autism spectrum disorders

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:56.780
But they're in the same they have the same types of immune disorders that an AIDS patient would have even in the absence of the virus

01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:04.460
Indicating other toxins going on so they're key to neural protection by cb1 driven endocannabinoids and phytopanhabinoids

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.780
Right in the middle you see the intersection between the immune system

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.380
and

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.540
And the uh the brain and the immune system in the brain are really connected

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:21.820
From conception and we and we know this now and the immune system is the brain is not what we used to consider

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:24.300
immune privilege by immune privilege

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:31.100
We means that you could have an inflammation of an antigen and it would not stimulate an inflammatory response

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.420
That's simply not true

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
Because the microglia

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:40.620
Traffics the brain that means it starts in the bone marrow and those myeloid cells that I showed

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:46.460
I'm that the first few slides and the brain derived monocyte macrophage is trafficked by

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:53.020
Molecules known as chemokines those molecules known as chemokines are also regulated epigenetically that means

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.180
At the expression level so while you can inherit changes in that

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:04.700
Toxins in our environment like aluminum like mercury some of the things that they're shown to be so heavily associated with the development of

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:11.660
Alzheimer's diseases those those and and autism spectrum disorders are that that pathogenesis is

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.180
Hypothesized and and now more and more data support to be driven by activated microglia

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:22.460
So you see the microglia is at the interface because they express both cb2

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.460
um

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.460
cannabinoid receptor number two

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:35.500
And they cross talk they talk all day to the astraglia and the the astrocytes and the astraglia are important in glioblastoma the brain cancers

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:43.260
We all um, you know, know of the upregulation and so really what we're listening to here is that endocannabinoid receptors are everywhere

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.820
They're involved in a lot of things because they are everywhere

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:50.460
And they can have some effect in an experimental setting on a lot of different things

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.140
They can be shown to be

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.220
Related to a lot of different systems again because they're g protein coupled receptors

01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:04.700
They can play a role in a lot of different systems and can be a a system wide regulator of things depending on how that that local circuit is organized

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.740
But all these arrows pointing to neural protection all these arrows pointing to

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.900
Regulation of the immune system is just making the argument to

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.780
Look at cannabis as a plant

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.780
To look at cannabis as a species

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.220
To start dissecting its genome and start looking for

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:28.380
candidate compounds that the pharmaceutical companies can synthetically make and use in these treatments

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:33.420
Increase of the of the brain cancers the glioblastoma is in in our world

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:40.060
And and it's it's proposed that cannabinoids and in fact really shown therapeutically

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:45.820
That they can be not only helpful, but in this slide actually curative for these devastating brain cancers that

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.500
That that killed vice president biden joe biden son a few years ago

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.060
So crit it critical in thinking about therapeutic

01:19:54.540 --> 01:20:00.460
Opportunities where the micro glia by simply deactivating so it's the activated micro glia

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:04.700
That is pathogenic because it releases that inflammatory nf cafe

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:12.300
In that it releases the way way way way what this is 2018. Why did she say president biden son

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:17.180
Did she say president biden son what in the hell wait?

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.380
Is that right?

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:28.620
What the full and thinking about therapeutic opportunities where the micro glia by simply deactivating

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:35.260
So it's the activated micro glia that is pathogenic because it releases that inflammatory nf cafe

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:42.060
In that it releases the activity pro inflammatory cytokines that reactivized oxygen and nitrogen species

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:49.340
And really is driving the the breakdown so you want that cannabinoid receptor 2 through dgf beta through

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:57.820
Thc to down regulate as we saw in the last slide to down regulate and actually allow cb1 to drive neural protection

01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.020
So

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.060
The metabolic um substrates and the anti

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.500
Undiant inflammatory tdf beta are really critical to it

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:13.580
And it's this cross talk between the micro glia and the astraglia and the expression of both and probably through antioxidant in other

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:19.500
Non-canonical cannabinoid receptors that modulate all of these processes non-canonical

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:25.100
A non-canonical cannabinoid receptors are ones that they haven't identified and characterized yet

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:32.700
See what we're talking about here. She's talking about cb1 and cb2, but then they're all non-canonical cannabinoid receptors

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.700
How many of those are there Judy?

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:42.300
The excitement is there for for all of us that um, um, that we we've probably uncovered a key therapeutic entity that can

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:47.260
Um, that can actually cure some of the most devastating diseases of our time

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.020
Um, the next slide shows even further to that

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:55.820
Um, now they're being detected that they're actually cb1 receptors

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.940
On the

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.060
Mykandria

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.780
So in on the astrocyte, I we blew up in in a paper that I've referenced

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:12.140
Somewhere in here. I'll make sure I put the reference on paper. Um, but this is a january 2018 paper in the journal of neuro

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.860
um, psychopharmacology

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.060
And this paper talks about the the title of it is

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.820
um, cb1 receptors from ubiquity to specificity

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.940
So cb1 receptors in the endocannabinoid system they're expressed on essentially every cell

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:33.420
In the body and every tissue and in every disease from cardiovascular disease to lung disease could be a part of those

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.260
um neurons, um and and communications with the astrocytes

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.500
Being dysregulated you see here the little um, G protein coupled receptor

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:47.820
So they say they signaling through these G protein coupled receptors and the astrocyte there and the brain

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.380
Um, we actually see these receptors

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.060
um

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:57.820
not only on the neuron and that the synaptic cleft driving um in the endogenous cannabinoid signaling

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.780
For for neurological increase in apps and synapse

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.300
This is driving all neurons

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.980
So when we think about these

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:09.340
fasticity diseases that that I talked about with ALS and and multiple sclerosis

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.900
um, uh, lugere

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:17.740
Parkinson's disease the fasciculations the um, the the seizures in the children with autism spectrum

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:23.900
Disorders, it's these receptors that are being dysregulated the psychoses even the psychoses

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:31.900
We see in young people who have dysregulated cb1 receptors. In fact, it's the it's the um, the agonist of the cb2

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:38.220
Um, the thc that could actually stop the psychoses rather than driving the addiction as we think

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:42.300
So here we have the communication between the neurons expressing

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:49.020
Cross-talking receptors and the astrocytes and the calcium signaling that that is discussed in the ion channels

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:54.940
And we show now the next point that the cannabinoids are actually there if we blow up in that

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.220
um

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:01.260
In that neuron the brain the heart and the muscles have the most mitochondria

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:09.580
So this is because that's the energy powerhouses of of of your entire body with that without the mitochondria

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.980
um, with the respiratory chain leading to 36 ATP versus two

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:18.300
You can think about all of these diseases myaltic encephalomyelitis

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:25.340
Um, is is inflammation of the brain and the muscles and it's long been been known to be a mitochondrial disease

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.020
Um, and and now we can start begin to understand

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:35.260
Um, that the cannabinoid signal through mitochondria right in the right hand slide. You see the mitochondria

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:39.580
Actually has a mitochondrial cb1 signal

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.860
So that so that you could actually generate

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:51.580
Energy and and and read restore energy at the level of really restoring function and and these are the mitochondrial disease

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:56.940
See wherever she finds a mitochondrial, uh, sorry wherever she finds a cannabinoid receptor

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:02.140
Then she makes a story up about what you could potentially do with a cannabinoid that targeted that

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:07.980
So now she's going to tell you that you could generate energy with cannabinoids you can you can be

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:15.420
Protecting of neurons in five different ways because they're they're there and they're there and they're there and they're here and they're there and they

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:22.620
They cause blood cells to differentiate into myeloid cells and they just you know it this kind of

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.260
This kind of throwing a net over something

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:31.340
Like a cannabinoid receptor and then claiming all of its

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.900
relevance based on where it's found

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:41.020
Is something that almost everyone in biology does when they have a pet receptor or a pet ion channel

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:48.140
If you study calcium gated potassium channels and you notice that they're in every neuron

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:56.700
That their expression changes during development that they're also found in cardiac neurons that they're also found in cardiac muscle

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.580
That they're also found in all these places and then you can start to say that's that calcium

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:07.340
Gated sodium channels are sorry calcium gated potassium channels are the most important

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:09.420
channels

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:13.100
In the whole body because they regulate neuronal function

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:18.220
They regulate action potential half width they regulate and I could go on and on and on and on and on

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:26.140
And then I can make a long argument about how conotoxins and and appamen from bees

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:34.620
Are two things that interact with sk channels and we should look for more drugs that act with sk channels because sk channels are everywhere

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:46.220
And it's no different than saying that well, we think we found some cannabinoid receptors subtypes on the mitochondria

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:50.460
So obviously we can generate energy with it's just ridiculous

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.420
But

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.100
This is exactly how academic biology has been broken

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.540
Because there is an impetus to to use this technique

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:09.740
That gets you grants that makes you untouchable in this really narrow

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:18.140
Fine band of understanding that no other academic can really encroach on because they don't study the cannabinoids that she does

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:25.420
They don't study it at the level that she does they're they're not looking to modulate the things that she's looking to modulate

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.980
And she doesn't they work for different companies. That's all

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.540
These are devastated where children actually die before

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:38.700
They're a few years old if they have a primary deficiency in any one of the chains of the mitochondria

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:44.780
Respiratory chain in in any of these that that leads to certain death because you can't feel your brain

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:48.940
Your heart or your muscles if you can't generate enough energy

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:54.620
So here the cannabinoids are are even a key to the respiratory transport chain

01:27:54.780 --> 01:28:00.860
And there's that reference for that paper in neuropsycho pharmacology, but there's a question mark in the

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:07.340
Cartoon for a discussion like this is we start to really dig into seeing it's a question mark

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.460
Homeostasis that's a balance in our energy

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:17.980
In in some of these devastating diseases of an inability to it's really an inability to fuel the brain and the heart

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.980
So it's it's now energy

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:26.060
It has nothing to do with misfolded proteins or any of the other stuff that we're supposed to pay attention to in those diseases

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.060
Don't you see how cool this is?

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:34.300
Some of those diseases have misfolded proteins in them and we're not even close to talking about that yet

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.300
They haven't even come close. You see it

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:43.500
Remember there's misfolded proteins in frickin cancer

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:48.220
Don't you remember the lady from mit that we just watched a couple days ago

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.940
She told us that these heat shock proteins

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.620
Our vital responses in cancer and that cancer

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.660
It happens because there's some misfolding stuff

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.100
She works on cancer

01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:06.460
She worked at the national cancer institute for many a year. I don't hear anything about protein misfolding right now

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.460
She's talking about all kinds of

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:14.700
Cognitive developmental disorders that have protein mis I'm not hearing anything. It's just all cannabinoid receptors

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.860
That is how academic biology has been broken ladies and gentlemen

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:27.820
And the muscles at the same time because of of defects and pathogens on most viruses

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:34.540
Will take out the mitochondria because they need the energy as well. So I show schematically on the next slide

01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:40.700
All of the ways that phyto cannabinoid so we've been talking about just our endogenous cannabinoids

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:46.740
Which we which we produce on our own throughout our lifetime, but as toxins further and further

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.460
dysregulate

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:54.060
Our immune system in our endocannabinoid system because we haven't had plant sources

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:59.100
Of cannabinoids whether it be hemp which has been outlawed since the 1930s

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.060
Is from cannabis sativa

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.460
And and the th she containing

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:11.260
Medical marijuana. It's called they're all cannabis sativa or in the car the main major strains because that's been out of our diet

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:16.540
Out of our world and the toxins that dysregulate the machinery that so now we need to eat

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:22.460
Cannabinoids we need to ingest them because our body can't make them what is going on here

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.260
That's a very interesting statement now, isn't it?

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:34.300
Wow, I'm I'm and there they are all timers Parkinson's those are all

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:42.620
Those are all misfolding disorders at least according to some academic biologists with a certain narrow point of view about them

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:51.420
She thinks it's more related to endocannabinoid dysregulation of energy consumption and fueling the brain or whatever she said

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.460
Maybe microglia responses being regulated by endocannabinoid receptors

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:02.780
Amazing talk just shown you on the past few slides have been increasing in our world and we really have

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.860
No response no therapeutic entity to simulate

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:14.140
The phyto cannabinoids are are ones that have been used historically more than 14,000 years

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.980
To to really mitigate and prevent the progression and development of these diseases

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.100
So they mitigate neuro trauma ischemia is loss of oxidants

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:27.020
So we talked about those reactive oxygen species and driving

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:34.460
Oxidative stress starving off tissue. So ischemia is the problem in stroke major depressive disorders Alzheimer's disease. It's um

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:39.340
Everything we've talked about in the last few slides are are interacting from that

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:45.740
neuron where the immune cells the microglia the oligodendrocyte and the astrocyte are communicating

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.780
Viya the cytokines chemokines growth factors

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:54.860
Neuro transmitters like nrf2 and and neuro hormones like for instance vitamin D critical

01:31:55.340 --> 01:32:01.660
So these all of these things go to disrupt the balance we call it the homeostasis at the at the level of the brain

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:06.780
And and this is what's driving. So if we can take phyto cannabinoids from plants

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.260
We can dampen that tissue injury we can prevent the progression of diseases

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:18.060
And in fact, as we saw a few slides ago, we could um, we could target neurogenesis once we once we've stopped the issue

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:22.540
So essentially she's saying that none of these diseases have to do with diet

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:25.900
None of these diseases have to do with environmental toxins

01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.860
They have to do with our lack of phyto

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:35.260
cannabinoids and not using these and eating these plants anymore or something like that

01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.260
I'm assuming that there are other plants that have phyto cannabinoids besides marijuana

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.100
um

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.260
What an interesting talk

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:51.660
And actually regenerate healthy neurons and neurological um function and and you know, literally, um cure these diseases

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:53.980
Um, and cure these diseases

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.980
scientific opinion

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:58.540
Um, as as slide as the next slide shows

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:04.860
It's really the tissue macrophage that is driving all of these processes. We've talked about micro glia

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:08.860
Um, and and that's the brain macrophage. Well, the keratinocyte

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.260
Let's stop here and just marvel at the number of macrophages there are

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:20.380
Number marvel at the macrophage diversity that no one ever acknowledges at all

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:33.100
Is the skin macrophage so we think of all of the uh, we think of all the skin diseases and that we see um, the very

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:42.300
Devastating skin diseases that that could in fact, um, be be regulated by a cannabinoids via, um, the the cb2 receptor

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:48.780
That that we show thc the psychoactive thc actually acts to drive, um, the various macrophages

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:55.260
So each different organ system from the lung alveolar macrophage. So here we can use cannabinoids for

01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:02.620
Lung cancer as part of immune therapy in in our world. We've developed we developed, um, drugs at the national cancer institute

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.100
And through various pharmaceutical companies like epigenetics, um, for the last 30 or 40 years getting old here

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:13.500
But but you can you can target in copd the alveolar macrophage

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:18.860
So we can think of all the allergens and microorganisms that are that are driving more and more copd

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.660
Which is, um, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Um, we look at the liver cup for cells

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:27.820
So this is the cell that's critical to hepatitis c hepatitis b

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:34.300
Um, hbrb and primary billery cirrhosis cirrhosis of the liver. We think of fatty liver disease

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:39.740
I, um, I think, um of all of the um, stories. I've been reading, uh, in the in the journals lately

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:43.020
It's the huge incidence in fatty liver diseases

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.220
In people under 50 whether it be men or women

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.660
And I showed you that the dipisite slide in the in the fat progenitor

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:54.780
So if you're driving the cb1 because of toxins because you don't have enough cb2

01:34:55.100 --> 01:35:00.700
Driving the monocyte macrophage then you can see how all of the diseases and then some that I put

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.700
See you don't have enough cbd

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:10.300
Do you don't have enough cannabinoids driving the cb2 receptor? It is exactly this kind of ridiculous

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:18.940
Simplification reductionist biology that has contaminated and destroyed our academic biological fields our medical science

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.220
And this is just a use of that technique

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:30.460
To present the primacy of the cb1 and cb2 receptors to make an argument that these are a new kind of

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:34.380
Of receptor to target a new novel idea

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.740
Um, that's just gaining traction that has all kinds of applications in the future

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:46.380
For the coming 21st century of acquired immune deficiency syndromes, you know like flying aids

01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:49.820
on that on that first introductory slide

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:54.220
Could be mitigated at some level by the right combination of

01:35:54.780 --> 01:36:00.140
Fido cannabinoids now from plants because of course our endogenous ones simply aren't enough to overcome

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:05.340
Um, what is already not enough process because we've been without them. We don't have enough last time

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:10.940
Most people experience the endogenous cannabinoids is during breastfeeding

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:17.260
Because that's when mom is elaborating and producing many of them through the milk and babies getting that calming pain free

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:20.780
Learn to suckle and mom and baby or go. That's the last time

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.620
That's the last time we've had endocannabinoids is when we were breastfeeding

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:29.260
Wow, that's a weird statement our brain makes them all the time

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:35.100
Where does she think they come from idea of of joy anandamide one of the key

01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:39.500
Endogenous cannabinoids anandamide is sanskrit meaning joy

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:45.980
So the cannabinoid system could be seen as joy pain free happy stress-free living and you can see at every level

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.980
The macropage that cb2

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.860
Endogenous

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.620
Babies are broken

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:58.380
Not in a like over, you know, I don't want to be overly dramatic but there is no question

01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:03.980
That breastfeeding if it can be done without pain and suffering by the mom

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:12.300
Breastfeeding is so far beyond superior to anything else that should never be considered to be dropped

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.900
There should be a full-time effort by the husband and the wife over many days to make that work

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:22.780
with the help of a

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.020
anyone

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:31.580
And that should be given up at the very last resort and I don't I don't think everybody's going to be really happy hearing me say that

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:35.580
But i'm saying it as I defend my my

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.460
best friend

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:44.940
For maybe the only reason why our daughter who's had the entire goddamn schedule since we got here in america

01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.140
Is not damaged as much as she could be

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:53.180
Is because my wife had the wherewithal to breastfeed her until she was almost five years old

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.540
Now our middle son was actually treated very differently

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.420
But our middle son was grow grew up in with his toddler years in the netherland

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:08.300
So he didn't have the same kind of assault on his immune system that my daughter did here

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:13.580
But oh my gosh

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:19.500
If there is anything that bonds a woman with a child that is breastfeeding

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.820
And

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:26.780
Just talking about missing out on that can make my wife break down in tears

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:34.780
I think she considers these some of the most important moments of her life

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:43.420
And I think that every day that she think that she's asked to think about it. She thinks maybe she would want another child

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.700
That's how beautiful it is

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500
And

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.700
It is impossible as a man to understand the kinds of things that a woman goes through

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:03.660
From the moment of conception until a child leaves the house

01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:11.740
And no matter what you want to think of yourself as a father, there's no way that you can possibly understand we can possibly understand

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:17.500
What it will means to carry a child to give birth to a child to breastfeed a child

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.660
And the idea that we would

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:26.140
Abbreviate that process or punctuate that process in any way

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:32.060
It's just it's an abomination ladies and gentlemen. It's an abomination

01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.420
And so I don't know what she's talking about here with endocannabinoids and breastfeeding

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:43.740
But I am pretty sure that your brain makes endocannabinoids all the time there necessary they're there

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:49.420
But they are a modulator they play a role in the background like all the other instruments in a symphony does

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:56.300
And if you take the piccolo out of the symphony, you can still recognize the song and it still goes and everybody can make it to the coda

01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:03.660
But there will be something missing and with cannabinoid receptors. This is a yet another knob to turn

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:04.860
It's another

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.220
Slider on the equalizer, but it's not the be-all end-all that

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.380
Decides whether macrophages are working or whether they're sitting in the corner

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:19.260
It's not the difference between well, my kid's brain is developing or it's not developing or my kids

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:24.140
Got skits if any or it doesn't have skits if any because he doesn't have enough cannabinoids in his brain

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.220
I guess we better give him some more

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:36.940
Abenoid key to the development of the hematopaedic poetics stem cell is could be modulated in a in a way by cannabinoids

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:41.580
In a positive way rather than a damaging way with the bone resorption here at the bottom of the screen

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.740
some chronic um

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:44.540
the

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:47.980
IBD the inflammatory bio disease and Crohn's disease at the level of the

01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:55.580
Intestinal macrophages. So so many of these diseases by gently modulating the macrophages at the level of the mild

01:40:55.580 --> 01:41:01.100
So rather than take care of the result the pathogenic state whatever poison you have

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.300
What other

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.220
Environmental toxin you're exposed to or whatever other thing was dysregulated

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:12.620
Let's just give them a substance which fixes that they're not on the right medication is the answer here

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
People aren't on the right medications

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:19.900
We need to get new medications to these people so we can cure their problems

01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:25.260
Rather than going to the root cause which would be real health and well-being right

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:29.660
That's health and wellness. This is not medicine. This is pharmaceuticals

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:35.580
Once you see it you can't unsee it. I think this is this was the best thing

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.940
We could have done with Judy

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.940
But stem cell could actually be curative by looking at in these ways

01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.820
I highlight the cross talk in in the next slide

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:51.580
To show you the pairing so cross talk of receptor. So opioid receptors are also a little deep

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:57.500
But that's the great this is the perfect slide for which to do this right? So what happens? How do they target this?

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:04.220
How do they get the serotonin receptors to be hit or the dopamine receptors to be hit

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:09.820
And modulated by the cv1 stimulation, but not the orexin receptors or the chemokine receptors

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:11.980
How do they manage to do that?

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580
Put a tag on it

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:20.460
Electropyrated in the right places. Come on guys. You can see it Pamela sees it

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.260
Link receptors there to these channels

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:28.620
I show you cv1 and that cross talk doesn't only have to happen between the cv1 and cv2

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.060
It can happen through these to these opioid receptors

01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:38.220
So anxiety and depression and chronic diseases anxieties a type of pain. It's called it's a no-siception

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.940
It's a different idea when we think of anxiety. So that's simply using cv1

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:48.220
Rich and targeting agonists and preparations of cannabinoids can actually

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:55.660
lead to tolerance and brain blocking pain blocking effects of opiate so it could actually reduce our opioid addiction

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.220
And so again, we're talking about could

01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:04.140
Maybe because this receptor is there and that receptor is there and these things are involved in that

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.020
We might be able to use this thing to do stuff

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:15.260
And this is exactly how academic biology is broken because that's how they all talk

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:21.900
That's how they always talk at the end of their talk. How many things can I catch with my net?

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.060
Holy

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:31.980
Cannabis, you know, and this is this is where understanding of biology and biochemistry helps us to break down these cultural walls that says oh no

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.540
Cannabis is addictive and we can't have THC

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:39.980
Well, as long as you prevent THC from signaling cv1 you won't get this psychoactive effects

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.260
And we can do that because we can just build a stronger magnet

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.820
Then THC to block those effects with that that happens now

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:55.340
See so what she's actually suggesting is is that in order to get this right we're going to have to have a THC receptor one blocker

01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:03.820
Put in your brain so you don't get high and then we'll we'll we'll use a different one that the oh my gosh

01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.980
It's just disturbing how

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:13.180
Ridiculous she sounds not only do you have no way of targeting any of these specific targets with your

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.540
Hit cv1 receptor and every one of these pictures. So how is it specific?

01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:27.340
And then you're going to block specific cv2 receptors or cv1 receptors in the brain to get the cv2 receptors

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.820
it's just all

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.020
It's all hot air actually through

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.980
Blockers of various immune molecules like inflammatory cytokine

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:45.660
IL-1 which is central to many diseases of pain as an IL-1 receptor and hagginess

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:52.940
So it actually is expressed in high levels IL-1 RA to block IL-1 once IL-1's job is done

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.380
So that you don't overdo it and cause these addictions so on to depression and anxiety

01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:05.260
We think of serotonin receptors so soo spider billions of dollars are spent spinning wheels like this

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:11.580
billions of dollars in grants are given to people who can talk exactly like this about a million different

01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:16.460
subjects of a tiny little flimsy part of some story

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:25.340
And there are there are actually hundreds and hundreds of g protein coupled receptors that people are interested in

01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.700
Hundreds and hundreds of ionic receptors that people are interested in

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.380
And it's it's each one of those can tell the same story

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:35.500
I wasn't joking when I was saying that calcium

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.300
small conductance

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:42.940
Calcium activated potassium channels are one of many

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.300
different subtypes of potassium channels

01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:53.660
Potassium channel biophysicists are very firm in their belief that potassium channels because they turn off

01:45:54.300 --> 01:46:00.460
the action potential because they reset the membrane of neurons and all electrical

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.260
membrane

01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.020
in the body

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:08.140
The potassium channels are the most important things to regulate

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.300
They're the most important things to target

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:14.140
They're the most important things that conduct the timing of the symphony

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.060
And you can hear all of these people over many decades talking about how

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:22.620
Primal they are to brain function even though they are a very tiny

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:29.020
Channel that produces a very tiny amount of current only in response to the presence of calcium

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:36.380
And so only at when synapses are learning which is also really reason why everybody's so interested in them for a long time

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:41.020
And she's doing exactly the same thing with cannabinoids right now

01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:46.780
With regard to the brain and the immune system and inflammation and all of the major

01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:51.740
Acquired immune deficiencies of the 21st century. It's an incredible

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.380
Talk so here again. This is where a therapeutic opportunity exists

01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:01.020
With with these memory impairments and these these diseases of serotonin

01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:05.900
receptors, which of course serotonin and dopamine receptors are key to Parkinson's disease

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.700
And and a number of other

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.940
You know, literally untreatable diseases at least thought of and until very recently Huntington's disease

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:19.660
Is these adenosine receptors which are highly immune suppressive and and this is again

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:24.060
It's usually a familial disease by a problem with the a2a receptors the adenosine receptors

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:30.860
Where if you can come in here and have some cross talk in agonists of cb1 and up regulate you can ameliorate

01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:32.860
You can lessen the damage

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:39.500
Of that genetic disease and stop the expression. So in in epigenetic worlds. It's it's the expression of the diseases

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:46.940
Not not the genetic component which which are these familial diseases. So Huntington's disease runs in families

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:51.500
But you don't have to die and you don't have to progress if you think of curative therapies

01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:54.140
Via modulating cb1

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.620
You know finally at the bottom of the screen we have

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:01.660
The chemokine receptors. Um, so the chemokine receptors are the trafficking molecules

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.940
There what takes those blood monocytes to the brain

01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.380
So if you can down module there what takes cancer cells and leads to tumor metastasis

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:16.460
If a prostate canter or any other cancer doesn't metastasize to the bone doesn't spread to the bone

01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:22.540
Via the trafficking molecule that takes them along by the hand and takes them to the place where they can live and thrive

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.220
Then you don't die of cancer if you stop see that's weird

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:30.140
She's talking about chemokines as if they deliver things that I don't think they do

01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:34.300
I think chemokines are are a concentration gradient signal

01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:38.620
And immune cells

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.740
Will migrate

01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:47.580
Based on the concentration of chemokines and follow the concentration gradient to the source

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:53.500
Which is a very different set of biological mechanisms and circumstances than a

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:57.740
Something that takes things somewhere or delivers them places

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:01.740
Which that's I don't think chemokine receptors do that

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.460
It's so weird

01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:11.180
To the bone via the trafficking molecule that takes them along by the hand and takes them to the place where they can live and thrive

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:15.500
Then you don't they do not get taken along by the hand. This is not this is wrong

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:21.180
I I don't I don't know why we're die of cancer if you stop them metastasis

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:26.860
And we have any number of drugs we've made over the last few years like andeogenesis inhibitors to stop cancer

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:32.700
Spread because then you can you can live with it and and not die of it. So the next slide

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:39.900
Highlights that that very cross talk idea when we talk about the pure allergic receptors. So purines

01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:44.380
Are our molecules like caffeine is a purine adenosine

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.180
Guanine we have purines and perimeters that make up the base pairs of our DNA

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:56.540
So in this open pain journal from 2010 it again earlier than then the the papers I could discussing today

01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:03.660
It showed where there were actually there was actually cross talk between that adenosine receptor on that monocyte macrophage

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:09.500
And that activated M1 is it's the bad macrophage no matter if you're in cancer or anything else

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:13.020
They're they're they're bad pro inflammatory when they get to M2

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:20.940
That's driving the cancer or driving the neurological disease. And as you've shown here. It's affecting what we call it damage in a distance

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.740
Venera, so that's by ATP

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:31.820
Which is appearing and and so when these when ATP and those energy molecules get outside the cells because the cells are dying

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:33.660
They become danger signals

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.420
So they tell the immune system to shut down and become immune suppressive

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:41.820
And so it's this cross talk and and and the suppression of these inflammatory cytokines

01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:50.220
That that is a problem because an immune suppressed person will develop cancer or progress in cancer because you need the right immunity

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:57.500
And that's what I'm pretty sure that this very poorly cited volume three pain journal from 2010 does not

01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:01.020
Actually establish this any of this is fact

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:05.020
But it's really neat that she can explain it as though it does

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.580
And that again is exactly how academic biology has been broken

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:15.100
Where you need that stem cell at the very beginning with TGFa to driving that hematopoietic stem cell

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:20.060
Away from the myeloid lineage that is toxic the activated and inflammatory

01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:25.980
See she's going all the way back to the first stage to try and tell you that we're already talking about how

01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.740
Blood cells are generated how their differentiation is is

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:35.260
Is controlled like a plinko machine with different. I mean this is amazing

01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:40.940
It is amazing because this is not informing anyone. This is not

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:48.860
Teaching anybody this has nothing to do with protein misfolding nothing to do with vaccines and it's 2018

01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:57.660
If you just paid attention to Judy mikovitt since the start of the pandemic you would never know that she didn't work for chd

01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:02.620
You would know you would think that she has done lots of streams with like

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.660
All the major anti-vaxxers for a very long time and has been on their team for years

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.020
Apparently not

01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.740
Apparently she made her money in other ways apparently she wasn't always an anti-vaccine grifter

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:23.820
If that's what people characterize her as now it's the resting um microglia

01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:26.940
Which is doing its job of surveilling and removing toxins

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:31.340
So the next slide shows you just a list of all of the effects

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:35.820
So the plant derived phytocannabinoids are known as dHC as we've discussed it linked

01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:39.660
CBD which canabidiols are really the main constituents of

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:42.940
Canab a big girl. I didn't know what that was. What's that?

01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:48.380
THC opportunity in most but from sativa and indica these have been traditionally known

01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:55.020
To to benefit patients with these various diseases and the canabajera which metabolizes into more

01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.140
THC

01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:00.940
Also again now we understand that's because of its regulation of the amatopoietic stem cell

01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:08.380
Having the anti-inflammatory and inflammatory agents so we can use these depending on the concentrations of the drugs

01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:14.140
To to actually help anti-psychotics work better. Um, essentially every drug we use

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.460
Oh

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:18.540
There it is

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:24.780
We're going to use canabinoids to make every drug we have work better

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:34.540
You just heard it right there. I'm going to play it again. That's the end. That's that's it

01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:37.420
That there we solved the problem now. That was pretty easy

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:45.420
Health anti-psychotics work better. Um, essentially every drug we used in in cancer or immune diseases right now

01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:48.860
We can just supplement and we can take advantage of synergies

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:55.980
Absolutely take advantage of synergies now we can repurpose all kinds of previously on useless patented drugs

01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:03.980
And and confound the effects of those drugs by applying them co-applying them with cannabinoids that stimulate everything

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:08.380
That makes perfect sense. How else were we going to end all

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:12.460
Clinical trials of anything meaningful if we didn't do it like this

01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:14.460
And derive

01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:23.980
Um, the phytocannabinoids here shown here and and and lessen the actual drug that the therapy that we're using and lessen the off-target or side effects

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:30.780
So lesson that side effects. Do you see it? This is exactly the plan

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:38.140
Cannabis is going to come to the rescue as we change our vaccine schedule over to genetic therapies

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:47.500
It's going to come to the rescue as we as we barrel forward into this era of health public health injury disguised as

01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:52.700
21st century acquired immune deficiency syndromes whole

01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:58.700
There are so can cannabinoids phytocannabinoids are part of a class of compounds known as terpies

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:06.380
So on this next slide. I show you um, all of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory terpies

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:14.060
So this starts to give us some insight starts to give us some insight in the fact that a lot of these terpines that are found in pine are actually

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:18.140
I think probably the least investigated most valuable

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:25.340
Potential organic compounds out there. I actually had a really interesting conversation with a crazy person

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:31.020
When I was at society for neuroscience meeting in new Orleans in 2008

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:36.780
I was walking on the street and some random guy stopped me. He was carrying a gigantic

01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:41.420
Walking staff and at the top of the walking staff had a carved

01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.660
Uh a pinecone

01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:48.780
And he insisted that I sit down on this bench and listen to him talk about how pinecone and

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:54.540
The terpines in pine actually were a secret that have been known since the Egyptians

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:57.500
And that's the reason why the papal

01:55:57.980 --> 01:55:59.500
the papal

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:06.060
Crucifix has a pinecone on it and why there's pine cones in in Egypt and all sort of stuff and it was crazy how

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:08.620
I mean this dude

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:11.020
Was telling me something like he thought

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:15.420
It was his last chance to tell somebody the truth

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:19.340
Was a very moving presentation that ended with me

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:24.380
Shaking his hand and walking back to my hotel, but it was it's interesting that she brings this up

01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:26.380
as to the plants

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:32.860
So one of the things that indica or hemp have the most of is the other terpine known as mercy

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:40.060
And so this is why the indica is thought to be relaxing because the mercy as an essential oil

01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:46.140
These could be thought of as essential oils or oils and though they're they help induce sleep and relaxation

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.380
Well, the indica strains are very much higher in these additional terpines

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:54.700
And and and they obviously have the smells that you taste with various

01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:59.420
Cannabis tinctures and oils other terpines like lemonine linole

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:06.780
Carbofyline the peppery spicy is a is a compound known it interacts with a receptor known as tarpv1

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:10.140
Tarpv1 is a key pain receptor

01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:17.340
And the only known natural ligand is the only unknown natural product that binds that is tarpv1 is hot chili peppers

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:22.380
So a lot of the preparation we make with cannabinoids where they're from from cannabis

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:25.260
The the activity of the cannabis could be

01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:29.100
modulated more by the terpine and not at all by

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.700
The cannabinoids the cbds the cbns or the cbgs

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.780
And even thc, so we could think of thinking about the anti-inflammatory terpines and and

01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:45.900
Since cannabis is terpines and thinking about how we can formulate and reduce as much as possible to psychoactive effects and yet get

01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:49.180
A healing therapeutic. She said that a few times

01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:57.340
We have to find a way to get rid of the psychoactive effects of of cannabis while keeping all of these wonderful pharmaceutical effects

01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:01.020
Benefit really at almost no cost

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:07.260
So I've talked a lot about the cannabinoids and here's two recent reviews and I think your audience can see

01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:12.540
Um, maybe 2015 and 2000 the lead author of this is named bandana

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:19.820
I just thought you'd like that in tenor 11 where there's there's um, these are very long lengthy reviews that give you all kinds of

01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.900
Agonists that we've used in the lab

01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:26.300
Nearly hundreds of respirances to show you what I just talked about briefly here today

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:33.020
How these cannabinoids and how targeting and building the specificity out of the ubiquity getting specificity out of

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.740
Everywhere and making it yes, they're everywhere, but can we can we be sure it is?

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:42.140
Using a shall it be a rational or a thoughtful process in using

01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:44.780
They're everywhere see i'm starting to see it

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:48.540
I'm starting to feel that there needs to be a huge survey of cannabinoids

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:55.100
I'm starting to feel that there needs to be a huge genetic survey of all plants that produce cannabinoids and terpenes

01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.140
So that we can understand them and better identify them and maybe even genetically modify them

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:08.540
So we can do it both for cancer and we can do it both for Parkinson's disease and really alleviate the motor neuron symptoms and regenerate

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:14.620
New neurons and replacing those damage neurons. So very much in the literature, not at all

01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:21.420
Hypothesis at this point in time and you will see hundreds of references there. That's why I included it

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:24.140
So finally we can just summarize to say that

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:28.380
The endocannabinoid system is the new regulation and neural

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:34.300
I don't know what that sound was all a balance of the brain and the immune system could be thought to be mediated through receptor

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:35.420
crosstalk

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:40.300
Not only with perinergic receptors. I just gave that example because it's key in our therapies today

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:42.220
but also through

01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:49.020
The regulation and blocking the toxic effects of aluminum glyphosate and many of the causative agents

01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:53.260
An autoimmune and neural new diseases. They're lipid mediators

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.140
They exert you know

01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:58.620
Pliotropic effects and complex effects on on the immune system and the brain

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:04.540
The endocannabinoids are really the master regulators of the innate and the adaptive immune axis just like

02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:11.900
Small conductance calcium activated potassium channels are the master regulators of neuronal function. You see

02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:15.100
It's really the same thing

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:22.540
And we used to say it all the time when I was working in college lab that sk channels do everything because they regulate the width of the action potential

02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:24.060
therefore

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:26.300
signaling in the brain is

02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:28.780
master regulated by sk channels

02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:36.940
She's making the exact same kind of statement. It's an academic biological statement that is designed to get grants and funding

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:42.540
And make your little sliver of expertise the most important one

02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.980
That's why you use words like master regulators

02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:50.060
But some reason or another when people use pot for 60 years

02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:55.100
That master regulator doesn't seem to go too far off center like I don't I don't

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:57.900
It's really it's really

02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:01.180
disingenuous, but it's perfect academic

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:07.420
It's a perfect academic biology presentation given by the perfect academic

02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:13.500
What that's that axis between astroglia and t you know t-cells and the monocyte

02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:21.100
So we can use these we can we can affect you we can effectively think about them on the orchestrators of immune response

02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:25.020
And make these a key therapeutic target and just like we could turn

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:30.860
HIV aids into a disease you could live with we can we can use these combination therapies to

02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:37.020
To cure these 21st century acquired immune deficiencies and with that I'll thank you and take question

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:42.220
We can cure these 21st century acquired immune deficiencies

02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:48.700
And I think that's a wonderful place to end this you can see it right this is this is

02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:55.100
Pre-pandemic biological bamboozlement. This is pre-pandemic confusion

02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:58.140
and and misconstruing

02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:01.900
understanding with noise

02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:11.020
And it is seeding a narrative where many of these 21st century acquired immune deficiency syndromes are expected to increase

02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:14.140
And why would that be well? We don't know

02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:21.020
But i'm sure endocannabinoids and the sequencing of all the pot in the world and looking at all these different

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:28.940
Compounds and screening them for their ability to synergistically work with other things that we already have patents for and already want to sell you

02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:31.420
Would be perfect

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:38.460
I think you can see now why there might be other people that are interested in sequencing the cannabis genome

02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:40.780
Um

02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:44.140
Why it's not such a trivial thing after all

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:52.220
Hope you can see it ladies and gentlemen. I definitely hope that you can see it

02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.860
um

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:56.860
It's really important that you can see it

02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.860
Uh because they are trying very very hard for you not to be able to see it

02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:11.100
I'm going to go right back down here and I am going to say it once and

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:15.580
Always as I usually do ladies and gentlemen, they are trying to

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:21.820
Eliminate the control group by any means necessary. I don't know if they transfected my friend at the gym

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:24.780
But I do know that that

02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.100
Reinforced this idea

02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:34.060
Vaccines are something that he couldn't say no to vaccines are something that you can't question and he defended himself as he

02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:38.700
Described to me the pain that he's in and I just my heart breaks for these people

02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:41.660
And it's only through our work through our

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:46.460
What we're doing these are one of the few ways that we can save these people and so

02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.220
um

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:52.540
Stop all transfections stop all vaccinations and adults for shit sake

02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:59.100
And uh remember that they are trying to eliminate the control group now that they've got him

02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:02.140
Now that he's got all sippetal neuropathy

02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:05.420
You know they can give him all the shots they want now

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.020
Once they transfect your kids

02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:13.660
How the hell you gonna know where it comes from

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.620
the Crohn's disease

02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:18.620
or the allergies

02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:20.620
eczema

02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.740
How are you gonna know where the where it comes from when they get cancer when they're 22 years old

02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:28.860
You'll know

02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:33.100
Because transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent because RNA

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:40.700
Campendemic and because gosh dang it intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting our

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:44.300
Beautiful immune system is dumb

02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:50.220
It's been an independent bright web presentation

02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.220
Um Star Trek is coming soon as is the wheel

02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:57.180
um

02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:03.180
Ladies and gentlemen, you can find me at giggle on biological.com deal that bio and stream dot giggle home dot bio also

02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:07.740
uh jc on a bike on youtube and on twitter and on twitch

02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:14.300
Thanks very much to everybody who subscribes to this channel who subscribes to my sub stack who sent me

02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:17.260
letters emails

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:22.540
anything um you're all very very much appreciated by me and my family and

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:27.900
This wouldn't happen without you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much share this stream

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:32.380
We'll see you tomorrow 1313 is the time we may be switching

02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:36.620
We may be switching to 10 10 in the morning for the first show

02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:38.860
um

02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:42.700
I'm pretty sure i'm going to be switching to 10 10 a.m. In the morning

02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:46.300
I hope that's not going to be too much trouble for a lot of people. It's going to be better

02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:50.140
A little bit better for me and it will open up the afternoon for possible second shows

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:51.340
um

02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:53.340
right now

02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:56.940
The the variable show can't be the first one so I can't do it that way

02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:58.300
I think I have to shift to the morning

02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:02.700
So it's probably going to be 10 10 in the morning next week and the nice thing about 10 10

02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:07.980
Is that that's the time that you set your watch to when you want to sell it right? That's the prettiest

02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:10.780
Time on an analog clock

02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:16.140
So I think it's kind of a fun time to start in 10 10 is is the second cup of coffee

02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:20.460
That's also really good and it'll give me time to walk the dog would be and and that kind of thing in the morning

02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:25.580
So 10 10 next week. I think the schedule will be changed to reflect that. Um, so don't worry

02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:29.180
I won't it won't happen at random and in the meantime this week

02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:36.300
It's uh 13 13 for the remainder of the week as far as I can tell and we are working on setting up some people to

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.900
Uh join us for an interview over a fire this kind of thing

02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:46.060
Um, we have a few people in mind. It's just uh getting this other momentum in the background

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:51.100
Solid and I think we're really close to getting there. So I can't thank everybody enough

02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:52.300
Um

02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:58.540
I'm pretty convinced that this illusion of consensus is about to break because a lot of people actually do know the truth

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:01.500
And uh, they're going to do something about it soon

02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:05.100
Thanks very much ladies and gentlemen and we'll see you tomorrow

02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:19.020
You
