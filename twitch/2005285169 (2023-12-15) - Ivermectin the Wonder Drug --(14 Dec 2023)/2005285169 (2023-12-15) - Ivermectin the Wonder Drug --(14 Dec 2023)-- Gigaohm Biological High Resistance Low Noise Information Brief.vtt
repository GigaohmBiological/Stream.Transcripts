Oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh time out JC on the bike JC on the bike

01:25.700 --> 01:33.640
It's JC on the bike it's JC on the bike yeah well I'm wise enough to know

01:33.640 --> 01:40.440
when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one look at round it's JC on the

01:40.440 --> 01:45.520
bike who says Veda didn't study music in college

01:49.440 --> 01:54.200
Early COVID survivors still need your help if you want to help call right now

01:54.200 --> 01:59.760
1-800-COVID survivors help Batman thank you very much don't forget COVID

01:59.760 --> 02:05.160
survivors need your help early COVID survivors need your help look at it at

02:05.160 --> 02:11.680
usatonic live check it out schedule for 60 minutes next it's going on French

02:11.680 --> 02:18.280
British Italian Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen

02:18.280 --> 02:23.000
to him it's embarrassing

02:24.640 --> 02:29.040
seriously I think it's very important to consider the list of early COVID

02:29.040 --> 02:34.560
survivors that has been assembled by Housatonic Live Mark Kulacz if you haven't

02:34.560 --> 02:41.760
found that list please go to housatonicits.com and find that list and start to

02:41.760 --> 02:46.080
read it and share it thanks very much

02:54.200 --> 03:13.600
the faith in a novel virus is where we still are ladies and gentlemen but the

03:13.600 --> 03:21.680
faith is a lie and that's our work these three things are definitely true and we

03:21.680 --> 03:27.760
work every day to try and add to the support biological support that we have

03:27.760 --> 03:37.080
for those ideas there was no spread in New York City

03:37.080 --> 03:44.120
transfection and healthy mammals is dumb protocols were definitely murder and

03:44.120 --> 03:47.400
the scooty-doo is real

03:48.000 --> 03:53.480
Kristi you should send me an email you've been in the in the chat for way too long

03:53.480 --> 03:58.480
not to have a gig of them had I think I can probably arrange it I think I can

03:58.480 --> 04:02.760
probably arrange it for you Kristi send me an email and make sure you know

04:02.760 --> 04:07.640
who I'm talking about and I can probably arrange it for you I don't know about

04:07.640 --> 04:11.640
patches if you can give me a link of where I could make those patches maybe I

04:11.720 --> 04:21.320
would start doing that I now have this relatively this relatively I don't know

04:21.320 --> 04:25.920
weak way of doing it with a with an embroidery company that just has my

04:25.920 --> 04:30.120
little design and so it's it's pretty low-key and I've only been really doing

04:30.120 --> 04:34.240
it to to have different colored hats for myself so that the stream isn't so

04:34.240 --> 04:39.640
boring I made a couple shirts actually before the pandemic ever started

04:39.640 --> 04:43.800
because I thought it would be kind of funny to have a patch clampers line of

04:43.800 --> 04:49.080
clothing and so I had one jacket and a couple shirts or something that I was

04:49.080 --> 04:53.200
wearing under other shirts I never thought I would be using it for a logo

04:53.200 --> 05:00.320
for a news program so long after the the yeah the whole thing started I can't

05:00.320 --> 05:05.620
believe we're here it's the 15th of December we are in the middle of the

05:05.620 --> 05:09.500
advent calendar right now which is just extraordinary the advent calendar of

05:09.500 --> 05:16.940
2023 as if we hadn't had an already enough time to wake up from this the

05:16.940 --> 05:21.380
captain keeps walking walking into the door over and over and over again we

05:21.380 --> 05:26.020
never seem to get anywhere it's just the same plot every 10 minutes the captain

05:26.020 --> 05:31.740
comes back in and looks around and and goes back out the door we never seem to

05:31.740 --> 05:35.500
make any progress and the same people keep getting on podcasts and it's the

05:35.500 --> 05:41.980
same discussion over and over again and nobody ever approaches the real

05:41.980 --> 05:46.420
questions that need to be asked and it's frustrating for me to be here right now

05:46.420 --> 05:49.420
I'm gonna be really honest with you it's frustrating for me to be here because I

05:49.420 --> 05:55.220
feel like I was so taken by the Scooby-Doo and the the brilliant execution of it

05:55.220 --> 06:03.820
that I couldn't find a way to connect with the or overcome the no virus like

06:03.900 --> 06:08.340
gag and I don't think that everybody that was on the no virus side in terms of

06:08.340 --> 06:14.820
cognitively thinking that there was no SARS-CoV-2 was on the side of there's

06:14.820 --> 06:23.340
no molecular biology but the way that it was done and the people and in the way

06:23.340 --> 06:30.460
that they did it the number one thing you really need to keep in your in the

06:30.500 --> 06:38.580
back of your mind is that the people who started the the tussle between the

06:38.580 --> 06:44.540
extreme bioweapon side and the no virus side and the extreme bioweapon side and

06:44.540 --> 06:52.100
the it's 5g side those were all very coordinated groups of people that already

06:52.100 --> 06:55.660
knew each other's names in a way that they shouldn't have really known and

06:55.740 --> 07:01.860
that tells you really all you need to know about why the no virus narrative

07:01.860 --> 07:05.900
never really progressed anywhere until very recently and it's only ever made

07:05.900 --> 07:12.460
really forward progress when our own side makes forward progress and as we

07:12.460 --> 07:17.780
come closer to them they attacked us more and as we came closer to them they

07:17.780 --> 07:23.460
attacked us even more even though if we would have talked about protocols we

07:23.500 --> 07:28.100
both would have agreed if we would have talked about PCR tests we probably both

07:28.100 --> 07:31.620
would have agreed if we talked about sequencing maybe we could have even

07:31.620 --> 07:35.260
getting some people to agree that metagenomic sequencing is absolute

07:35.260 --> 07:41.620
baloney all of these arguments were part of the no-virus narrative but the way

07:41.620 --> 07:47.940
that they shepherded that that narrative was to use it as a weapon instead of as

07:47.940 --> 07:53.900
a way of pulling people away from the TV narrative and so there was no middle

07:53.900 --> 07:58.700
ground with them there was no well we'll let you talk to us now and if we don't

07:58.700 --> 08:04.060
understand this time maybe we'll talk again no no they canceled meetings and

08:04.060 --> 08:10.300
you know set the exact parameters of the debate all the time and there is

08:10.300 --> 08:15.740
probably a very good reason for it and those those borders if you want my honest

08:15.780 --> 08:20.540
prediction those borders are going to dissolve very quickly as Jessica

08:20.540 --> 08:27.020
Hockett and myself and Jonathan Engler and these other people as we come to

08:27.020 --> 08:33.620
basically the same conclusion albeit three years late the the right answer

08:33.620 --> 08:38.460
would be for them to go okay cool you finally figured it out well done but

08:38.460 --> 08:43.580
instead they're going to turn around and attack even though I'm currently employed

08:43.620 --> 08:49.620
at CHD and advocating for the investigation of the possibility that

08:49.620 --> 08:55.220
there may have been no real spreading pathogen and pushing Denis Rancourt's

08:55.220 --> 08:59.220
evidence from the all-cause mortality that there was probably no spreading

08:59.220 --> 09:03.580
pathogen and seeing that as an opening I'm predicting that they're going to go

09:03.580 --> 09:10.060
ahead and attack CHD attack the book attack me and attack us as though we're

09:10.060 --> 09:16.660
not making progress toward this goal and I think it's really important to see

09:16.660 --> 09:21.060
that this prediction when it comes true is is just part and parcel for how this

09:21.060 --> 09:27.700
was supposed to go we weren't even supposed to be here yet they need to

09:27.700 --> 09:31.740
run the clock out until the next election or even farther and we were not

09:31.740 --> 09:38.060
supposed to be this far and so a lot of crazy things are going to happen in the

09:38.100 --> 09:43.700
next weeks and months as they try desperately to recover in this fast

09:43.700 --> 09:49.660
break but the full court presses on and the steady pressure coming from myself

09:49.660 --> 09:57.380
and Mark and Jessica and others is going to continue because we finally got our

09:57.380 --> 10:02.900
feet on solid ground in a way that we somehow or another were prevented from

10:02.900 --> 10:07.340
getting our feet on this solid ground earlier and I could possibly be also

10:07.420 --> 10:13.100
partly my fault it's all of our faults it's the social media's fault for not

10:13.100 --> 10:17.260
having connected me to Jessica Hockett earlier it's it's it's social media's

10:17.260 --> 10:20.820
fault for allowing some of these other people to perpetuate these narratives

10:20.820 --> 10:26.500
for so long that we're distractions whole distractions from figuring out the

10:26.500 --> 10:32.860
truth and so the truth is is that we've been led to believe that there are all

10:32.860 --> 10:38.780
kinds of sources for pandemic potential and that these constitute of gain of

10:38.780 --> 10:44.340
function worst case scenario that must be respected one way or another you've

10:44.340 --> 10:48.580
got to admit that this exists one way or another you got to understand that

10:48.580 --> 10:52.700
eventually a bachelor student is going to have the capabilities of enriching a

10:52.700 --> 11:02.220
pathogen in their garage and that's what all these books basically tell the

11:02.220 --> 11:06.460
story of right the vast majority of the the texts that are in front of us

11:06.460 --> 11:11.740
right now these are all basically the same story about a virus made in China

11:11.740 --> 11:16.500
with or without American money that leaked in Wuhan and spread around the

11:16.500 --> 11:19.660
world for four years and people tried to cover up the source because they didn't

11:19.660 --> 11:29.420
want to get blamed the story of Peter and ginger Bragan written in 2020 early

11:29.780 --> 11:34.300
early in the pandemic pretty much the same as the story written soon after by

11:34.300 --> 11:40.020
Andrew Huff and then soon after by Sherry Markinson and then soon after Robert

11:40.020 --> 11:44.740
Malone's book and then after that her and Paul's book came out and now Robert

11:44.740 --> 11:49.980
F. Kennedy Junior's books come out now the difference between a lot of these

11:49.980 --> 11:56.860
books and Bobby's book is that Bobby's has some some historical value in the

11:56.860 --> 12:02.860
sense of trying to catalog the previous history of of the bio weapons narrative

12:02.860 --> 12:07.340
and what people say we've done what other countries say they've done what books

12:07.340 --> 12:10.900
say other countries have done what people say other countries have done and up

12:10.900 --> 12:15.740
until now and how that led here the book is basically a historical document about

12:15.740 --> 12:20.500
the stories that people have told during this time including stories that I've

12:20.500 --> 12:26.460
told and I think it's a better historical document of what occurred

12:26.460 --> 12:29.660
than any of the other books on the screen but it still tells the same story

12:29.660 --> 12:35.940
because of course the prevailing narrative on the planet no matter where

12:35.940 --> 12:42.220
you went was the narrative that's in in tuned in all of these books and it is

12:42.220 --> 12:46.460
this narrative that they intend to coerce our children to surrender their

12:46.460 --> 12:51.260
sovereignty and invert those human rights to human permissions that that's for

12:51.260 --> 13:01.940
sure I would argue that allowing me to even get any text in biology into a book

13:01.940 --> 13:10.580
is already a win if you if you believe how we believe you is suspect how we

13:10.580 --> 13:15.820
suspect now if your hypothesis matches up with ours that these people who said

13:15.820 --> 13:24.980
that there was no SARS and that they haven't isolated it are correct but we

13:24.980 --> 13:29.420
have a good biological explanation for what they did we have a good molecular

13:29.420 --> 13:34.900
biological explanation for how people were fooled we have a good idea of how

13:34.900 --> 13:39.740
the crime might have been pulled off so that we can we can propose solutions and

13:39.740 --> 13:44.980
and directions in an investigation to figure this out that's that's what we're

13:44.980 --> 13:48.780
bringing that the no virus they didn't isolate they didn't that that doesn't

13:48.780 --> 13:53.580
get us anywhere and it never did and that's why if they take a pivot now

13:53.580 --> 13:57.700
they're gonna take a pivot now because it's been time for them to pivot at the

13:57.700 --> 14:02.620
same time they're gonna try and turn it around and say things like John Goodman

14:02.620 --> 14:06.700
said about me this week which is that I guess I'm a social engineer now from

14:06.700 --> 14:12.220
the garage in Pittsburgh I'm social engineering the world with my 3,000

14:12.220 --> 14:19.940
followers on Twitch the worst platform ever with nobody barely anybody copying

14:19.940 --> 14:25.380
my videos and putting them anywhere I don't have time for that Mark Kulacz is

14:25.380 --> 14:29.500
the only guy who's ever catalogued any of mine there is one rumble channel that's

14:29.500 --> 14:33.740
done I'm not trying to forget anybody out there but I'm just saying relative to

14:33.740 --> 14:37.180
other people and how they're working and how they're getting retweeted and how

14:37.180 --> 14:42.980
the algorithms help them I mean how can Mark Kulacz have like 6,000 followers

14:42.980 --> 14:50.980
after six years of doing what he does on YouTube it's just absurd and so this

14:50.980 --> 14:55.180
narrative is not going to be challenged except for from people who are wholly

14:55.180 --> 15:00.580
independent only people who are wholly independent can challenge this narrative

15:00.580 --> 15:06.380
and speak in the way that we are speaking challenging this narrative is not

15:06.380 --> 15:11.660
spending an hour waving foyas around and saying that they haven't isolated or

15:11.660 --> 15:19.180
purified the virus it doesn't get anywhere with regard to breaking people's the

15:19.180 --> 15:25.420
hold on people it doesn't it's not adequate and maybe some of them didn't

15:25.420 --> 15:31.180
understand that maybe some of them were convinced that this strategy of just

15:31.180 --> 15:35.380
sticking to those terms and that semantic warfare and that little tiny narrow

15:35.380 --> 15:43.020
sliver of debate was the smart thing to do but I have the feeling that showing

15:43.020 --> 15:46.660
that you agreed on a million other things and then hey wait a minute guys

15:46.660 --> 15:49.900
all we agree on all of this stuff why don't you just try to listen to us on

15:49.900 --> 15:55.180
this one thing about isolation and purification and then wow think about it

15:55.180 --> 16:01.540
nothing and that's where I think you can really see it very clearly and now I'm

16:01.620 --> 16:06.460
getting you know a lot of attention from them again CHD is getting a lot of

16:06.460 --> 16:09.900
attention from them again and it's unfortunate because now would be the

16:09.900 --> 16:14.300
time for a hey wow so I see what you mean now in that email where you said that

16:14.300 --> 16:19.540
you think we might all be right I shouldn't have reacted so aggressively

16:19.540 --> 16:23.020
and tried to get you fired at CHD instead I should have said what do you mean by

16:23.020 --> 16:28.740
you think we're all right all we can all be right about this what does that mean

16:29.220 --> 16:34.900
but no that's not where they went and so this game is not going to stop this

16:34.900 --> 16:42.180
game is about you being lost on a road and while you were lost on that road

16:42.180 --> 16:46.620
somebody came and picked you up and in that car were people that you thought

16:46.620 --> 16:49.740
they said that they were also hitchhikers and they also got picked up but

16:49.740 --> 16:54.980
actually that's not true at all the three people that picked you up in that car

16:54.980 --> 16:58.900
are all working together to fool you about where they're taking you and how

16:58.900 --> 17:03.980
much it's going to cost and what you're going to find when you get there even

17:03.980 --> 17:07.620
fooling you about what you see outside of the car as they drive you where they're

17:07.620 --> 17:13.140
going and I believe that that's what a lot of these people did on social media

17:13.140 --> 17:18.620
that laid down this narrative of there was a novel virus that millions of

17:18.620 --> 17:23.140
people were killed from that millions of people were killed by millions more

17:23.140 --> 17:27.620
were saved from they likely resulted from gain of function and so a virus

17:27.620 --> 17:33.660
will come again these people that said a billion people were gonna die at the

17:33.660 --> 17:41.700
beginning of the pandemic that this was a red dragon event and have never

17:41.700 --> 17:47.260
encroached on the consensus about this idea of what worst-case scenario since

17:47.340 --> 17:55.340
never encroached on it and I really think we've started to nail down what's

17:55.340 --> 18:00.540
going on here and we've just got to now start to think about who are the teams

18:00.540 --> 18:05.900
who are the competing interests back there that are all united in this

18:05.900 --> 18:10.180
illusion of consensus about a worst-case scenario and about what might come

18:10.180 --> 18:19.020
again but are themselves competing with one another these groups for power or

18:19.020 --> 18:26.660
for access to it and so we've been in this car with them for like three years

18:26.660 --> 18:29.860
now and that's why we aren't going anywhere that's why we haven't gotten

18:29.860 --> 18:38.500
anywhere yet because we've been picked up from this lonely lonely road at the

18:38.500 --> 18:42.460
start of the pandemic and we've been completely bamboozled we got in the car

18:42.460 --> 18:46.860
and people started telling us stories about lab leaks and people started

18:46.860 --> 18:51.540
arguing about it in front of us then we decided this car wasn't very safe so we

18:51.540 --> 18:54.740
got out of this car at the gas station and hitchhiked in another car and three

18:54.740 --> 19:00.980
more people started to argue about lab leak and whether or not we needed ivermectin

19:00.980 --> 19:07.100
or hydroxychloroquine and so by the time you are in your third car now hitchhiking

19:07.100 --> 19:12.820
to nowhere you've been bamboozled by multiple groups of people all playing

19:12.820 --> 19:23.180
the same illusion of consensus game with you and we just keep driving and we keep

19:23.180 --> 19:28.140
driving and the faith in a novel virus never gets questioned we haven't talked

19:28.140 --> 19:33.500
about the the illusion of asymptomatic spread in over a year we haven't talked

19:33.580 --> 19:37.740
about the ridiculous use of PCR at the beginning of the pandemic in over four

19:37.740 --> 19:38.220
years

19:46.220 --> 19:50.220
and these spread of these bad ideas is much more dangerous than the spread of an RNA

19:50.220 --> 19:51.900
molecule i can tell you that for sure

19:55.340 --> 19:59.340
and so these people have misled us and what we perceive to be true is definitely

19:59.340 --> 20:02.780
definitely definitely not true and that's why they behave the way they do they know

20:02.780 --> 20:09.900
that's not true that's why they can be confident in their proclamations so let's just rewind

20:09.900 --> 20:14.300
a little bit make sure we were know where we were about four weeks ago or three weeks ago

20:15.020 --> 20:19.100
Robert Malone updated us with the latest biology i'm just going to play it again to make sure

20:19.100 --> 20:21.660
that you understand where they want us to be

20:32.780 --> 20:38.140
alone i'm a physician and scientist and i need to acknowledge that my middle name was

20:38.700 --> 20:42.700
and entered as a shirt me that i will not be drawing forward to what i've got to say

20:44.060 --> 20:46.060
um i don't think that's a big question

20:47.740 --> 20:54.860
that's above my head first off i wish to speak extembraniously to you rather

20:54.860 --> 21:02.620
the slides there is an unmet need for a rapid response capability to allow a little

21:03.020 --> 21:09.580
capacity to mitigate the risks of emerging infectious disease and engineering pathogens

21:10.460 --> 21:17.820
that is a valid concern the technology has developed to the state where almost many

21:18.700 --> 21:25.820
with a undergraduate degree in biology can weaponize pathogens we know here the United

21:25.820 --> 21:31.660
States is somebody with security clearance in the biotense industrial complex for the

21:31.660 --> 21:40.540
VOD that the binary weapons that were developed by US military or deployment potentially is

21:40.540 --> 21:48.860
countermeasure against the Russian tank threat can be readily reproduced by virtually any

21:48.860 --> 21:56.540
biologists in the garage for it okay so there is a valid threat there is an unmet need

21:57.100 --> 22:00.940
okay so there is i'm going to turn that down sorry about that i wanted to make sure you could

22:00.940 --> 22:12.460
hear Robert there is a a um a real threat a real need for this prepper being prepared to react to

22:12.460 --> 22:21.100
a emerging disease pathogen or an engineered pathogen and that is again the consensus

22:21.100 --> 22:28.060
of a worst case scenario this is the same worst case scenario that kim.com has talked about

22:28.620 --> 22:36.940
that jeffree sachs has talked about and and and that peter desak talks about the same worst case

22:36.940 --> 22:47.100
scenario that can happen in perpetuity forever your children must not be raised with this mythology

22:47.100 --> 22:54.140
in the back of their mind they must not be allowed to be to grow up with this idea in their mind we

22:54.140 --> 23:03.500
must erase this now and it's going to take a lot of work because this is the new world order that

23:03.580 --> 23:09.100
they would like to impose on our children this idea that public health and governance by public

23:09.100 --> 23:14.220
health mythology is the way forward this is just the way it's going to be there are there are emerging

23:14.220 --> 23:21.580
pathogens there are engineered pathogens and it's basically engineering pathogens are accessible

23:21.580 --> 23:29.340
is accessible to any biologist in their garage i'm sorry that the audio of that is not so great

23:29.340 --> 23:38.540
but that's really extraordinary test no that didn't work how was that did i not set this up right

23:39.420 --> 23:44.540
oh i'm not going to mess with that now sorry about that um i thought that was on right no

23:44.540 --> 23:52.780
it's not on right wow um it is going to keep going here so yeah the past will fade into mist

23:53.580 --> 23:59.420
the past was erased the erasure was forgotten and the lie became truth i think that's 1984

24:03.020 --> 24:11.980
we're at the stage now where the the lie about the the the mystery virus the lie about the novel

24:11.980 --> 24:17.580
virus that killed millions and millions more were saved from is about to become the truth

24:18.220 --> 24:25.100
because the the past is slowly being erased actually the past was already kind of erased

24:25.100 --> 24:32.060
because of the way that it occurred we are very used to laying down episodic memories

24:32.700 --> 24:37.900
and our hippocampus is designed to lay down episodic memories based on the context in which

24:37.900 --> 24:46.540
they occurred and pre pandemic a lot of us had a very routine set of contexts that we formed

24:46.620 --> 24:53.340
memories in throughout the day perhaps the morning context at home and then the commute

24:53.340 --> 25:00.540
context in your bus on your bus and then the work context and then the lunchtime context at the

25:00.540 --> 25:07.740
restaurant then the work context then the bus ride home context then the after dinner context

25:08.060 --> 25:16.380
and so as that pattern laid down over and over again our memories became organized around

25:16.380 --> 25:22.140
this repeating pattern of context and actually a lot of recall is dependent on your ability to

25:22.140 --> 25:29.580
recall context or if you are in the same context as the memory was created and so when they took

25:29.580 --> 25:33.660
this pandemic and they said okay everybody stay at home now and stare at your screens and don't go

25:33.740 --> 25:37.820
to work anymore they interrupted this pattern of repeating context

25:39.100 --> 25:44.220
and it made it harder for us to form episodic memories of what's going on that's why 2020

25:44.220 --> 25:53.900
and 2021 really seemed like a long short time ago 2020 in your own mind might only be

25:55.580 --> 25:59.820
three months or two months it might only feel very short because you almost can't remember

25:59.820 --> 26:03.900
any of it and that's because you were at home and there was no context except for one

26:05.820 --> 26:11.420
so all the memories that would have been stored in different sort of contexts in your mind

26:12.060 --> 26:17.340
were now all layered over one context and so it actually makes your brain very

26:17.900 --> 26:24.540
it limits the capacity of your brain to to store those as independent memories and it's

26:25.020 --> 26:30.940
it's for sure that it makes it more difficult for your brain to store those memories independently

26:30.940 --> 26:37.660
in a temporal order that matters and so it is not for nothing that they locked down

26:38.700 --> 26:44.540
it wasn't just to brainwash you it was also to brainwash you to make sure that your memory of

26:44.540 --> 26:51.580
the event a couple years later would be foggy enough for you to not process it as clearly as you should

26:51.580 --> 26:56.540
and if we could accurately remember remember all the things that we went through during that

26:56.540 --> 27:03.980
year as we were home schooling our children on iPads and unable to go out for a hamburger

27:05.420 --> 27:11.820
or go to the gym or go to the park or go to our community center to play bingo

27:13.900 --> 27:19.020
I mean we are talking about some severe malevolence that a lot of us have simply forgotten they put

27:19.020 --> 27:23.340
sand in beach side skate parks

27:28.380 --> 27:33.660
and because they made us stay home and stare at our screens we had limited context change we had

27:33.660 --> 27:40.140
limited pattern of context change which made it very hard for us to form to form episodic memory

27:40.140 --> 27:48.940
to the extent to which a lot of that year or year and a half is a blur when the lies that they

27:49.180 --> 27:56.220
told were the strongest when these mythologies and the way that they were laid down was the strongest

27:57.580 --> 28:02.060
and so if the past is erased the erasure is forgotten then the lie becomes the truth we

28:02.060 --> 28:09.260
cannot allow this to happen we need to fight very hard to try and find the borders of this

28:09.260 --> 28:15.580
limited spectrum of debate within which we've had this very lively discussion about lab leak

28:15.580 --> 28:25.180
or a novel virus from a wet market and we've got to get our act together very quickly because

28:25.180 --> 28:33.020
these people have been working for three years to catch everybody and make sure that they don't

28:33.020 --> 28:38.700
get all the way to the finish line in time and that's really what it seems to only be about now

28:38.780 --> 28:47.740
is running out the clock to some next event or some next pivot and so this is the conference

28:47.740 --> 28:55.180
that occurred in Romania on the 17th and 18th of November where all of these people that have been

28:55.740 --> 29:01.420
fighting for us for so long finally got to see Denis Rancourt in person and Denis Rancourt presented

29:01.420 --> 29:07.580
his latest data that shows that there was no geographic evidence of spread and that the only

29:07.580 --> 29:16.540
all-cause mortality that matters started in 2021 there were local bomb-like events

29:18.700 --> 29:27.100
local mass casualty events in 2020 but nothing that resembles the spreading pathogen new cause

29:27.100 --> 29:35.580
of death on earth in this photo it's very important to notice that Steven Hatfill is in this photograph

29:35.580 --> 29:44.780
in March of 2020 he made countless videos for local blogs and conservative media outlets

29:44.780 --> 29:51.820
etc where he said the children carry the most virus children shed the most virus children

29:51.820 --> 29:57.500
should wear masks her Barney should wear masks to normalize masks for other children

29:57.500 --> 30:03.740
and he said that social distancing was necessary

30:09.260 --> 30:15.500
and so he was definitely definitely seating the worst-case scenario in the beginning of the pandemic

30:16.060 --> 30:23.980
and he was on many programs doing so with certainty it's not the worst one but it's a pretty bad one

30:24.620 --> 30:29.660
the worst one will be really bad but this is the last warning he said

30:32.540 --> 30:37.900
so here also in this one is Byram Bridle I should have him in green really because I do not think

30:37.900 --> 30:43.260
that he is a compromised guy I just think he's kind of stuck where he is because he got his career run

30:43.260 --> 30:49.820
over and his livelihood taken away and threatened and and so that that that'll keep your mouth shut

30:49.820 --> 30:57.180
pretty quick there's Nick Hudson Ryan Cole there's Brett Weinstein somebody who I'm absolutely

30:57.180 --> 31:03.020
certain is is or was playing for a team that laid down the worst-case scenario at the beginning

31:03.020 --> 31:10.780
of the pandemic and if if he's found any remorse in this or has any remorse for this I have not seen

31:10.780 --> 31:16.060
it evident in his podcast so I think he's just going forward and of course Brett Weinstein is

31:16.060 --> 31:22.300
the guy who brought Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone onto the scene in June of 2021 here is

31:22.300 --> 31:31.340
the wife of Robert Malone Jill Glasspool Malone this is Meryl Nass of course she and these three

31:31.340 --> 31:39.900
and Cole and I guess Harvey Risch a lot too Jessica Rose and Brett hasn't been doing it so much

31:39.900 --> 31:48.300
but these five have been touring around the world I think Meryl and and Jessica and Robert

31:48.300 --> 31:55.180
and Jill and Cole were all in front of the Parliament a couple times in the EU or at least had a room

31:55.180 --> 32:01.100
in the Parliament building of the EU and gave some talks they've also been to COVID summits around

32:01.100 --> 32:07.020
the world for these last three years the same basic core group of people with if you included

32:07.020 --> 32:12.540
Pierre Kory maybe Peter McCullough but not so much as Pierre Kory Pierre Kory is another one

32:12.540 --> 32:18.540
that's been in a lot of places as these people so there's a core group of individuals that has been

32:19.260 --> 32:25.500
at the forefront of this worst-case scenario narrative for quite some time and when I say

32:25.500 --> 32:31.740
worst-case scenario the worst-case scenario is it is a lab leak and it could be worse next time and

32:32.700 --> 32:38.060
those people that don't question that have been the ones that have risen to the top and have been

32:39.020 --> 32:44.060
more or less circulating the globe as as leaders of this dissident movement that's against big

32:44.060 --> 32:52.620
pharma and against the DoD of America that's responsible for this I guess and so that's what I think

32:52.620 --> 32:57.660
this whole show has been about on social media and in mainstream media but on social media is the one

32:57.660 --> 33:02.140
that we're all paying attention to and that's where all these characters like David Martin

33:02.140 --> 33:08.460
come in is that they all have a little part of the train to pull on and what I mean by that is is

33:08.460 --> 33:13.660
that every one of these people is pretending to participate in an action which is having

33:14.300 --> 33:19.100
some effect on the natural world it's saving lives you know I'm fighting for the freedom of

33:19.100 --> 33:24.140
America or I'm fighting for the truth or whatever and what they're really doing is pretending to do

33:24.140 --> 33:31.740
so and the reason why they have to pretend to do so is because they have wittingly or unwittingly

33:32.620 --> 33:41.420
coerced or or or or gladly have decided to participate in this illusion and these people there are

33:41.420 --> 33:46.220
many of them so it's not just one guy standing at the train being silly and chalking his hands up

33:46.860 --> 33:53.500
it's many many many people who are participating in this illusion this mime exercise and they've

33:53.500 --> 33:58.300
been participating in this mime exercise for about three and a half years almost four years now

33:59.420 --> 34:04.540
some of them were co-opted as they came out some of them were set in motion from the very beginning

34:04.540 --> 34:10.780
and people like Steven Hatfill were likely ready to go when they decided that okay now it's time

34:10.780 --> 34:15.820
we're going to start talking about this stuff and and this is the way we're going to talk about it

34:15.820 --> 34:24.860
Steve Go, Tony Go, Rand Paul Go you know they all whoever had had things to say they're very very

34:25.420 --> 34:30.860
very for national security reasons they're very very controlled things that they had to say

34:31.660 --> 34:35.820
and so that's what this was all about fighting about whether this was a novel virus that everyone

34:35.820 --> 34:41.660
was vulnerable to is not really a fight that even happened it kind of happened but only in the

34:41.660 --> 34:47.340
background PCR testing the questioning of that only way in the background

34:49.980 --> 34:54.380
and if you're arguing about early novel treatments you're not arguing about PCR

34:55.980 --> 35:00.380
if you're arguing about early novel treatments you're not questioning the spreading virus at all

35:01.180 --> 35:05.820
if you're arguing about early treatments you're actually not arguing about whether people are

35:05.820 --> 35:11.980
being killed in the hospital by the protocols they are using you're saying that they're getting

35:11.980 --> 35:18.220
the wrong thing because they're treating them wrong but we took a long time before we heard

35:18.220 --> 35:22.940
dissidents on our side saying that the protocols were killing people one person said that the

35:22.940 --> 35:30.140
protocols were killing people his name was Brian Ardis and he was saying that the Remdesivir was

35:30.140 --> 35:36.860
killing people and then he said that there was there was venom in the shots on Stu Peter's

35:36.860 --> 35:45.740
his show and everybody made fun of him to the point where he sank and with him sank his objection

35:45.740 --> 35:51.580
to Remdesivir his very succinct presentation about how Remdesivir was in a trial for a Ebola

35:51.580 --> 35:58.700
and it killed 53% of the people that used it that wonderful information

36:00.620 --> 36:06.700
was lost because the guy came out on Stu Peter's and said that there was venom in the shots and

36:06.700 --> 36:13.660
they used that to discredit him as a guy and then the people walking on this train nobody picked up

36:13.660 --> 36:20.860
the story nobody on the COVID doctor said hey that Brian Ardis got a short end of his stick

36:20.860 --> 36:25.420
and he had a really good point about Remdesivir even if he's wrong about the venom let's not

36:25.420 --> 36:31.180
forget that he wrote he put his life his career on the line for Remdesivir did anybody say that

36:32.060 --> 36:38.380
no no no when he got discredited for saying things about venom everybody just kind of backed away

36:38.380 --> 36:44.220
and said oh I told him not to say anything about that I told him not to go there and nobody seemed

36:44.220 --> 36:49.100
to remember that his original reason for being on the scene in the first place that anybody listened

36:49.180 --> 36:54.140
to him was because he noticed that Remdesivir was wholly inappropriate for healthy humans

36:55.580 --> 36:58.380
so do you see how the game is played do you see how this is done

37:00.060 --> 37:05.100
and in retrospect without much work you don't need a guy like me to see this you just got to think

37:05.100 --> 37:07.740
carefully about what really happened take some notes

37:09.740 --> 37:14.620
and look who was on teamwork worst case scenario from the very beginning or more importantly look

37:14.620 --> 37:21.340
who didn't question it look who had another job that was so important that they couldn't talk

37:21.340 --> 37:26.460
about the fact that the worst case scenario wasn't very likely anybody that had a job

37:27.900 --> 37:32.060
or a subject that they were talking about you know like I'm going to focus on veers

37:33.900 --> 37:38.700
and I'm not going to say anything about anything else for a really long time just veers

37:39.020 --> 37:47.660
even though there's lots of things to talk about even though brian artists had came out very early

37:47.660 --> 37:56.380
about remdesivir being crazy nobody else picked it up nobody else picked up that ball when he

37:56.380 --> 38:03.740
dropped it and nobody saw that as curious but me maybe somebody else I don't know

38:04.060 --> 38:10.140
so that's what's going on here I think and that's what hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were they were

38:10.140 --> 38:15.020
relatively safe substances expected to have more positive effects than negative for sure

38:16.140 --> 38:21.260
and with ivermectin in particular we're just simply not sure what kind of an effect general

38:21.260 --> 38:26.300
good effect that may or may not have on the extremely unhealthy population of america

38:27.820 --> 38:32.620
but I can tell you for sure that if there's one of these two that I think was probably valuable

38:33.260 --> 38:39.260
for respiratory disease and for inflammation and for any kind of out-of-control cytokine

38:39.260 --> 38:43.900
storm I'm guessing it's hydroxychloroquine because that's the one that nobody really ever

38:43.900 --> 38:49.180
talked about during the pandemic it's the one that everybody kind of went silent about

38:49.180 --> 38:53.020
Robert Malone did mention it on Joe Rogan's podcast

38:53.180 --> 39:02.780
we did have some fighting for it by by Peter McCullough but very quickly that that died away

39:02.780 --> 39:10.300
probably because he was coerced to stop that Zev Zelenko pushed hydroxychloroquine very early

39:10.300 --> 39:16.220
on I think we heard that something like 200 congressmen were congresspersons were treated

39:16.220 --> 39:20.300
with hydroxychloroquine in the first six months of the pandemic or first five months or three

39:20.300 --> 39:25.100
months I don't know what it was but a lot of them were treated with hydroxychloroquine

39:25.100 --> 39:28.780
as either a prophylactic or when they thought they had symptoms

39:31.180 --> 39:35.980
and so that's why I want to talk about this one because ivermectin was pushed by Brett Weinstein

39:35.980 --> 39:40.220
and pushed hard by Brett Weinstein and actually pushed hard by another person

39:40.860 --> 39:46.460
in Brett Weinstein's circle Alexandros Maranos for almost a whole year and when I suggested

39:46.460 --> 39:52.860
that maybe it was time to move on to something else he got really mad I mean really mad

39:54.620 --> 40:01.500
and he argues that he was trying to use ivermectin or explore ivermectin for its possibility of

40:01.500 --> 40:07.660
curing his damage from the shot or its damage from long covid I don't know what it was but

40:08.220 --> 40:14.140
I know for sure that as smart as that guy is and as prolific as he was as a tweeter it was just

40:14.140 --> 40:19.180
absolutely absurd that he spent months and months and months and months and months

40:19.740 --> 40:26.860
with his head up Musk's rear end saying that Elon Musk is the smartest guy on the internet

40:26.860 --> 40:29.340
and ivermectin is a wonder drug I think

40:31.660 --> 40:37.900
and over analyzing every single study over analyzing every single review and every single

40:37.980 --> 40:42.140
outcome like tweet threads from here to Tokyo

40:44.940 --> 40:49.980
oh and now Steven Hatfill's writing a book about hydroxychloroquine I mean it's just it can't be

40:49.980 --> 40:55.260
any more ridiculous so that we are still just running around in circles all the time the captain's

40:55.260 --> 40:59.180
going to come in in another five minutes again we're stuck on this spaceship and we can't get off

40:59.500 --> 41:04.300
let's watch this bid and see what we think

41:07.340 --> 41:11.340
I'm Dr. Pierre Kory I'm a pulmonary and critical cash specialist and I'm the author of the book

41:11.340 --> 41:17.020
the war and ivermectin. Prior to the pandemic I knew little of the true scope and scale of

41:17.020 --> 41:23.020
pharmaceutical industry influence over clinical trials high impact medical journals public health

41:23.020 --> 41:28.300
agencies and media. The day that I read the article called the disinformation playbook by the

41:28.380 --> 41:33.340
union for concerned scientists to transform my life I suddenly realized that we were in the midst

41:33.340 --> 41:38.700
of a global disinformation campaign conducted by the pharmaceutical industry using time honored

41:38.700 --> 41:45.260
tactics first pioneered by the tobacco industry. I'm just going to stop it right here and show you

41:45.260 --> 41:50.460
these tactics that are listed in this article called the union of concerned scientists and

41:50.460 --> 41:55.980
it's the disinformation playbook and the reason why I want to show you the plays is because I want

41:55.980 --> 42:03.180
you to see that the two best plays in this playbook are never ever applied to the main narrative

42:04.380 --> 42:09.660
they're never applied to the bio terrorist bio security state

42:11.900 --> 42:15.340
they're never applied to people like gee or donno

42:17.500 --> 42:21.820
and so as I show you these plays and we think about them that's the thing I want you to think

42:21.820 --> 42:27.420
about how could these plays be used to create the illusion of a pandemic

42:29.420 --> 42:35.820
how would you use actors on the internet and on social media in in co-hoots with one another in

42:35.820 --> 42:44.860
coordinated opposing narratives with one another how would you use that to create the illusion of

42:44.860 --> 42:50.620
a pandemic well the first thing you might do is you might manipulate government officials or

42:50.620 --> 42:56.300
processes inappropriately to influence policy right so you can use money to do that you can use

42:56.300 --> 43:02.700
grant funding to do that and now in this evident in this position I want to tell this story because

43:02.700 --> 43:07.660
I I think it fits here and it's just random I'm just thinking random here um

43:11.340 --> 43:14.140
hey thank you very much wow that's nice um

43:15.900 --> 43:19.500
what I want you to think about I came up with this new analogy I just want to test it out on the

43:19.580 --> 43:26.140
people here 97 people are here I'm really excited um there has been this thing the fix right

43:26.140 --> 43:33.660
manipulating government officials or processes to inappropriate influence policy so using money

43:33.660 --> 43:38.620
to influence policy the one that I really like to talk about is grant fault grant calls because

43:39.260 --> 43:44.460
how you write your grant call actually determines what research gets done and so if you don't write

43:44.460 --> 43:49.820
a grant call for that research that research will never get done and what I want to do is give

43:49.820 --> 43:59.660
you a little lesson about how I think autism has been improperly researched to influence the way

43:59.660 --> 44:05.580
that the entire society and indeed academia thinks about it um so what I'm going to do is I'm going

44:05.660 --> 44:14.220
to cut over here and go to the right um and then I just want to draw a little graph and

44:14.220 --> 44:20.460
hope it will make sense to you a little bit so this is a a graph of the whole continuum

44:24.220 --> 44:31.820
of car accidents okay I don't know if this is going to be the right graph or not and what I

44:31.820 --> 44:43.020
want to do is on the on the the x-axis let's say like this there are there are cause a number of

44:43.020 --> 44:50.620
people that are dying from the car accidents and then on the bottom axis this is a little bit of a

44:50.620 --> 44:55.900
metaphor or an analogy so don't think that this is like math here this is trying to get an idea

44:55.900 --> 45:05.740
across across the bottom here are all the causes of of a continuum of causes of car accidents right

45:05.740 --> 45:11.980
somewhere over here is school bus crossings over here is you know whatever and so you got all these

45:11.980 --> 45:21.180
bars that add up to the total number of car accidents okay and then over here right here is drunk

45:21.180 --> 45:27.420
driving okay so these this bar right here is drunk driving we're going to make it a big spike

45:27.420 --> 45:32.540
right that's the bar but if we were doing it right it would just be a very narrow sliver but

45:33.180 --> 45:37.180
you know apologize I'm using a pencil so we're going to use this as a bar I guess I'll make it

45:37.180 --> 45:43.820
a bar so these are all bars right for different causes of car accidents and this bar right here

45:43.820 --> 45:50.460
is drunk driving okay now the way that they have done it with autism and I think this is a really

45:50.460 --> 45:55.100
great analogy my wife loved it the way that they've done it with autism is that they've said

45:55.900 --> 46:02.620
okay so we've got a grant call for autism and we want you to find genetic causes of autism but

46:02.620 --> 46:08.940
in this analogy what it would be is we want you to find genetic causes for car accidents

46:10.140 --> 46:16.300
so the biology community of all of the major institutions in the United States get together

46:16.380 --> 46:21.340
at their local biology department and say hey guys there's a new grant call from the NIH and they

46:21.340 --> 46:30.460
want us to find genetic causes or genetic correlations correlations with genes and and auto accidents

46:31.180 --> 46:36.380
and so some biologists will get excited and say oh yeah but we can look in people with with uh

46:37.100 --> 46:40.940
with vision disorders and see if we have genes for that and then we'll look for correlations

46:40.940 --> 46:46.780
between those genes and car accidents great write that grant well I'm going to look for people that

46:46.780 --> 46:54.220
have have some kind of nervous twitch disorder or or an inherited epileptic disease and then see

46:54.220 --> 47:00.060
if they are a significant group of car accidents that's a great idea look at those genes write that

47:00.060 --> 47:10.460
grant and so if they write a grant or rather they call for a grant that says

47:11.260 --> 47:19.420
I want you to look for correlations between the tires that they use and car accidents you're

47:19.420 --> 47:25.740
going to find that there's a little sliver of car accidents that are caused by a particularly

47:25.740 --> 47:32.300
crappy kind of tire maybe after a rigorous rigorous investigation and many negative results

47:33.020 --> 47:40.540
we found a significant correlation between the use of Michelin 584s in combination

47:40.540 --> 47:46.060
on rear tires with blah blah blah blah and that results p-value is significant

47:48.460 --> 47:56.620
and if they wrote a grant call that said we want to find relationships between vaccination and autism

47:56.860 --> 48:05.100
it would be the same thing as if they said well we would like you to use your to write a grant

48:05.100 --> 48:12.700
call about the relationship between drinking and auto accidents well then you're going to find

48:12.700 --> 48:16.380
a wonderful correlation you're going to find a lot of stories you're going to find a lot of

48:16.380 --> 48:21.180
causation you're going to be able to tell a very good story about it because a very significant

48:21.180 --> 48:26.780
portion of all auto accidents is actually caused by that one thing drunk driving

48:28.860 --> 48:34.140
and so if you compared the severity of these accidents to other accidents and then said well

48:34.140 --> 48:40.780
you know the times when people went off the road and and and hit the curb with their bad tires

48:40.780 --> 48:45.660
is kind of the same as when people get in a drunk driving accident and kill a family of five and

48:45.660 --> 48:50.220
ahead on collision with a hundred miles an hour after they blacked out on the highway and crossed

48:50.220 --> 48:59.820
the median and so with autism it's very easy for the NIH to write grant calls that will find

48:59.820 --> 49:06.220
all kinds of different ways that you can get something that resembles autism to occur something

49:06.220 --> 49:13.500
that resembles a car accident but that's pretty disingenuous when you know there are drunk drivers

49:13.500 --> 49:19.660
on the road and it's pretty disingenuous if you know in your heart of hearts that vaccines are

49:19.660 --> 49:28.060
the causing this injury even if there are other ways to have a car accident it would be pretty

49:28.060 --> 49:34.940
shitty to ignore drunk driving as a cause and to spend no money on it it would be even worse if

49:34.940 --> 49:44.540
you denied that drinking while driving caused any more accidents than drinking soda it would be

49:44.540 --> 49:51.980
really bad if you said well come on drinking and driving very rarely causes an accident I mean

49:51.980 --> 49:57.820
come on most people aren't even stupid enough to drink and drive so that's just ridiculous

49:57.820 --> 50:01.340
we're not going to spend any money worrying about drunk drivers

50:03.580 --> 50:09.820
but that's exactly what they've done with the vaccine injuries even though they're a very

50:09.820 --> 50:15.580
significant fraction even though it happens every year even though they know the pattern exists

50:17.420 --> 50:23.020
they deny it and spend money trying to find other causes of the car accidents

50:24.700 --> 50:30.460
and when they find them they tell stories about how this is evidence that there isn't one way for

50:30.460 --> 50:35.500
people to get into car accidents and people are really blowing it out of proportion how dangerous

50:35.500 --> 50:44.380
drunk driving is tell me that's not a winner tell me that's not a winner and now tell me why

50:44.380 --> 50:48.620
we weren't there already why isn't somebody already come up with an analogy that's strong

50:52.860 --> 50:58.620
we're about to start winning big time ladies and gentlemen because this biology is starting

50:58.620 --> 51:05.900
to become clear because there are no teams anymore the only teams that are left are constructed

51:06.700 --> 51:08.380
fake posing teams

51:11.740 --> 51:18.300
I'm totally ready right now to say that that with regard to SARS-CoV-2 in the pandemic all the

51:18.300 --> 51:27.420
no-virus people were right but I am not willing to accept that all the people on that side that

51:27.420 --> 51:35.340
were really coordinating their effort were always forthright with how they went about this

51:35.340 --> 51:43.100
debate they were not forthright and I don't know who's responsible for it I don't I'm not gonna

51:43.100 --> 51:51.500
put any names on it it's very possible that Christine Massey is not responsible for her choice to just

51:51.500 --> 52:02.140
keep hammering foyer foyer foyer maybe that was her task given to some girl by somebody that

52:02.140 --> 52:13.500
she respected and trusted because that's how this is done but now we're here now we're here where

52:13.500 --> 52:20.460
I'm saying it and I work for CHD and so at this point now the door is wide open

52:22.300 --> 52:25.900
the door is wide open for a a united front

52:28.620 --> 52:32.220
and I assure you they're not going to take this opening and if they do I'll be very

52:32.220 --> 52:36.940
surprised and happy and I think we will make enormous progress moving forward it's even

52:37.020 --> 52:42.220
possible that at that stage is somebody like Robert F Kennedy jr who has no real

52:43.260 --> 52:48.460
vested interest in one way or another other than getting the story right might come around too

52:52.220 --> 52:58.700
once he sees that this idea is finally starting to have the acidic effects it should have a year

52:58.700 --> 53:04.780
ago already when I when I finally realized that cloning was the only thing that they can really

53:04.780 --> 53:10.940
manage to make work that they could use that molecular biology to pretend that that RNA

53:10.940 --> 53:16.380
virology is real that's exactly what I meant when I emailed them and said I think we might all be

53:16.380 --> 53:22.860
right and we might all be fooled and I really think we should get together and they said

53:25.980 --> 53:32.460
huh so here are the here are the things that this this disinformation playbook has is so first

53:32.460 --> 53:38.860
the fix then the blitz harassed scientists who speak out with results or views inconvenient

53:38.860 --> 53:43.420
for industry that that's what it's written for right so this is like pharmaceutical companies

53:43.420 --> 53:48.860
attacking scientists who are good guys but what we're not really seeing in this playbook and

53:48.860 --> 53:54.860
what we should really see in this playbook is how a biosecurity state that wanted to control

53:54.860 --> 54:00.940
its population or the population of the known world with a mythology these are the same plays

54:00.940 --> 54:07.740
that they would use a screen by credibility through alliances with academia professional

54:07.740 --> 54:14.300
societies tell me the AMA and the American Academy of Pediatrics are not these kinds of screens

54:16.300 --> 54:20.780
but who are they screening for are they screening for the pharmaceutical companies maybe before they

54:20.780 --> 54:29.660
were but now they're screening for something bigger I think and so we have this diversion

54:29.660 --> 54:34.860
manufacture uncertainty about science where little or none exists you mean like whether people

54:34.860 --> 54:39.500
will survive a novel virus whether whether a certain treatment works or whether they need to

54:39.500 --> 54:44.780
be ventilated to prevent spread you mean that kind of uncertainty about stuff that was already known

54:44.780 --> 54:48.540
like how we get people out of secondary pneumonia with antibiotics

54:52.860 --> 54:57.660
and the fake conduct counterfeit science and try to pass it off as legitimate research you mean

54:57.660 --> 55:03.900
like using metagenomic sequencing to imply that there are millions of coronavirus is waiting to

55:03.900 --> 55:11.820
jump 1.7 million coronavirus is waiting to zoneautically jump according to Peter Dasek and Nathan Wolff

55:16.220 --> 55:21.340
which again was not anything that I was denying already two years ago so there was plenty of

55:21.980 --> 55:27.020
common ground for the no virus people to have linked up with us much earlier but

55:27.740 --> 55:33.180
I do believe that certain people prevented it from happening but I definitely definitely was not one

55:33.180 --> 55:39.180
of them and so what I want you to think about again are these playbooks really things that are

55:39.180 --> 55:44.620
being run by the tobacco companies and by pharmaceutical companies to orchestrate the pandemic or is

55:44.620 --> 55:50.300
there a layer above this that's running the same place on us so I'll continue the video now

55:51.180 --> 55:57.260
I'm Dr. Pierre Kory, I'm a pulmonary critical care specialist and I guess

55:59.100 --> 56:04.220
prior to the pandemic I knew little of the true scope and scale I guess what I want how I want

56:04.220 --> 56:12.540
you to watch this is I want you to see that even even the opposition to ivermectin in this video

56:12.700 --> 56:22.780
as it's portrayed in your eyes should be seen as a scooby-doo they wanted us to think that ivermectin

56:22.780 --> 56:29.180
was valuable they wanted us to clearly see that they were denying it was valuable so that we would

56:29.180 --> 56:37.820
get very fired up about solving the mystery of ivermectin being valuable and as we argued about ivermectin

56:37.820 --> 56:43.260
being valuable and the same people that covered up the virus are now covering up ivermectin it

56:43.260 --> 56:49.980
sure looks like that the freaking virus is circulating and in fact that's exactly the

56:49.980 --> 56:56.860
bamboozlement that occurs as you engage in this debate that you come to accept the monster

56:57.740 --> 57:04.780
that requires the ivermectin the monster becomes an assumed part of the story, assumed part of the

57:04.780 --> 57:10.940
debate and that is the beauty of the scooby-doo once you start solving their mysteries you have

57:10.940 --> 57:19.020
accepted their monsters dang it we're getting good at this come on now

57:22.060 --> 57:27.580
a pharmaceutical industry influence over clinical trials high impact medical journals

57:27.580 --> 57:32.780
public health agencies and the media the day that i read the article called the disinformation

57:32.860 --> 57:37.820
playbook by the union for concerned scientists it transformed my life i suddenly realized that

57:37.820 --> 57:42.700
we were in the midst of a global disinformation campaign conducted by the pharmaceutical industry

57:42.700 --> 57:47.820
using time-honored tactics first pioneered by the tobacco industry in order to suppress the

57:47.820 --> 57:53.500
evidence of efficacy of a drug called ivermectin which could have ended the pandemic their actions

57:53.500 --> 57:58.860
in those tactics led to millions of needless deaths across the world i felt compelled to write

57:58.860 --> 58:03.900
to go up to warn ivermectin it was my brilliant co-writer jennifer carthi and together with this

58:04.460 --> 58:09.340
so so what we are being led to believe is that the withdrawal or though withholding of ivermectin

58:09.340 --> 58:17.580
killed millions of people that died of a virus not of protocols not of secondary pneumonia and

58:17.580 --> 58:26.220
denial of antibiotics not secondary pneumonia and denial of steroids now keep in mind pure

58:26.220 --> 58:31.900
cori has done sub-stacks about the misuse of steroids pure cori has done sub-stacks about

58:32.460 --> 58:36.140
you know the doctors being able to should have been able to do whatever they want and he's

58:36.140 --> 58:42.140
probably done sub-stacks about the ventilators not being what was needed i mean he went from

58:42.940 --> 58:47.260
wisconsin to new york right into the heart of it he must have seen that happening the point is

58:49.260 --> 58:54.380
is that with regard to ivermectin he's playing this game whether it's coerced or

58:55.020 --> 58:58.940
or by choice or or that he just doesn't get it that he really believes

58:59.740 --> 59:05.900
the one thing he hasn't considered apparently is that the protocols were killing people and so

59:05.900 --> 59:10.380
if you take them or don't put them on a protocol instead put them on something that will either

59:10.380 --> 59:17.500
not harm them or maybe possibly help them as an antibiotic or uh or uh some other kind of

59:17.500 --> 59:24.220
chloride channel blocker for pathogens then uh yeah there's an effect there

59:25.900 --> 59:31.100
and all this super fast recovery and stuff like that with ivermectin might speak to the

59:31.100 --> 59:37.580
fact that ivermectin has some uh antibiotic qualities helping people cope with secondary

59:37.580 --> 59:44.700
pneumonia but my guess is that ivermectin is never ever ever in these protocols given alone

59:45.020 --> 59:54.380
and once you start giving ivermectin and azithromycin or ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies like

59:54.380 --> 01:00:02.220
they did to joe rogan well then where are we then we're in in mythology land again

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:13.580
and we're not debating the need the need is based on the test the need is based on pcr and that

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.740
doesn't differentiate from a conflated background that they probably spent three years studying

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:23.980
so that they could accurately roll it out over the course of the pandemic go ahead take it take

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:38.540
it away take it away if and when this happens again you better get your ivermectin

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:43.340
joe rogan announced on social media today that he has covid so we immediately through the kitchen

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:49.740
sink out of all kinds of meds monoclonal antibodies uh ivermectin one of those drugs he mentioned

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:54.380
ivermectin is something more often used to deworm horses so things are clearly bad but they're being

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.940
made even worse by people who have refused to take the vaccine and instead are swallowing

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:05.660
horse dewormer ivermectin is ineffective against covid but could put you in a coma it can kill you

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:11.020
it can kill you there's no clinical evidence that indicates that this works it goes beyond

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.940
that we actually know that it doesn't work we should talk about that that bothered you it

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.900
should bother you too lying at your network about people taking human drugs versus drugs

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:28.300
now if you think oh darn you demon if you think for one second that that was that was by accident

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.780
that's where you're making the mistake that's where we were taken at the time

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:40.540
but as you look backwards now i want to challenge you to think about the possibility that even that

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:49.420
interaction with cnn and cnn's misstep with regards to saying that joe rogan was taking horse medicine

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.820
was staged it was staged so that that joe rogan could get that clip

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.860
and so that that clip would go viral and that people would be convinced that these people were

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:06.300
covering up a lab leak and covering up what would be useful for it and it doesn't make sense

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.580
but it's happening right before my eyes and i figured it out on my own

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:19.100
it's really cannot be underestimated how much of this was a script there's no clinical evidence

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:23.820
that indicates that this works it goes beyond that we actually know that it doesn't work we

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.820
should talk about that that bothered you it should bother you too lying at your network

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.380
about people taking human drugs versus drugs or veterinarian calling it a horse to wormers

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.460
not a flattering thing i get that it's a lie they shouldn't have said that why did they do that i

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.020
don't know you're the micro guy over there ivermectin can be a very effective medication

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:48.700
touted as a miracle prevention and cure by far right commentators and anti-vaxxers ivermectin

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:55.660
is a treatment for life and what initially led this was an fda twitter account that used the term

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:02.460
y'all to express denigration of ivermectin as a horse drug the truth is that the dose that's

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:08.220
used for horses by body weight is the same dose that's recommended for humans but it's formulated

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:14.140
and manufactured to a quality standard that's very different the cdc put out a national advisory

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:19.340
on this warning the whole country against taking this drug ivermectin formulated for horses and

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:25.580
cows and sheep with that memo fired every doctor then suddenly me and all my early treatment

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.740
colleagues around the country we were faced with problems like we'd never had before

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:40.140
so it was the first time in history that we ever saw a doctor who could be prosecuted for using

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:47.180
a generic safe and effective drug for the application that doctor thought was appropriate my group of

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.460
five the core five of us i see doctors collectively were some of the most highly published doctors in

01:03:52.460 --> 01:04:01.580
the history of critical care medicine hall marrick is the most published practicing intensivist

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.420
in the world as we sit here today i'm the most published person in my field in history but when

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:16.620
covid 19 hit my clinical and academic world was turned upside down that's when our lives

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.900
started going sideways professionally paul started getting numerous complaints against him that he's

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:28.380
never had in his career for the first time in my entire career i could not be a doctor i had to

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:35.980
stand by idly i had to stand by idly watching these people die

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:45.420
i'm quite certain that marrick is not um in on this america if anything is being being

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.820
being overshadowed by these other people because he has almost almost only good things to say he's

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:56.380
only only had good things to say from the very beginning of the pandemic and he has been

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:03.260
has required damping um i'm not i don't know who is doing the damping but just having all these

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:08.380
other people around instead of just letting him talk um is basically part of the the goal

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.500
because if you've ever heard him give a speech about what happened in the pandemic he's well he's

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.540
really kind of like mike eden in a lot of ways except he doesn't go so far as to say there's

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:24.380
nothing there he just says that there's nothing there that we couldn't have treated um so yeah

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:29.500
anyway he's still pretty much on the scooby-doo but at least i don't think he's uh an actor

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:36.300
from the fda emergency use authorization of medical products and related authorities

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:40.220
for the fda to issue an emergency use authorization there must be no adequate

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.740
approved and available attorney you know whose voice this is right this is heather hay

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:48.540
preventing or treating the disease or condition if i've remembered were an effective treatment

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.100
the vaccines never would have gotten emergency use authorization in the u.s

01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:01.660
if a viable therapeutic but i mean if if if ventilators and remdesivir were killing people

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:07.180
and the use the lack of use of antibiotics were killing people then we didn't need something new

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:14.460
we just needed to stop doing what we weren't where we were doing and so again this is laying

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:20.940
down the narrative that there is a need for something new the something new was ivermectin

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:27.020
that fits in this unique niche that otherwise would be filled by EUA products

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.020
but we don't need any EUA products if all we need to do is stop killing people

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:39.260
and i am definitely ashamed of how long it took me to come to this realization but part of the

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:44.940
reason it took me to come to this realization is because every time i started to get away from

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:50.620
the idea of the virus nobody was there to say yeah there's no virus they're killing people with

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:57.740
stuff there were only people there to tell me how bad the virus was how bad the spike protein

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:06.060
was how the spike protein was causing amyloid or prion disease and how the the the transfections

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:11.100
weren't that bad that they were pushing the virus around so there were lots of narratives that needed

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:19.260
fighting and the front to fight at never felt like the no virus front because again once you

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:24.220
started fighting on that front you couldn't find allies there was nobody that was willing to

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:30.860
meet you halfway help you to navigate that either you had to jump all the way and admit that there

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.780
were no viruses anywhere and measles doesn't exist or we're not even going to talk to you

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:41.020
and that was part of the same the same song and dance that these guys have performed is just a

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:47.980
different part of the dance in order to make sure that none of us made forward progress that we

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:54.300
always circled around and came back to the goal all the time which is not understanding and being

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:59.420
engaged in a debate about a lab leak or a natural virus and whether or not the worst case scenario

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:06.700
was underway like people like Charles Ricksey or or Kevin McCarron would like you to believe that

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:12.940
super prions are going to come out of the plants and they're coming out of all these vaccinated

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:19.820
people and out of the virus and out of the the spike protein and so it's still worst case

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:28.940
scenario it's still the same thing and so we're really dealing with a bunch of what now seem to be

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:37.020
disparate narratives that don't ever want to come back to baseline but just want to keep going off

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:41.660
in the direction that they are in hopes that they can keep fracturing our understanding of it.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.140
And it's not working anymore that's the best part about it.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.460
And so I think I might have skipped off there and somewhere I didn't want to go but we're just

01:08:52.460 --> 01:09:00.220
going to leave this keep playing. Strategy existed for outpatients then the logic supporting universal

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:05.020
vaccination with largely experiment. Yeah but David Ike said that there was no virus from the

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:10.220
beginning but for years he had been saying that these people were lizard people without any real

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:17.020
evidence and so you got to wonder again if he's not set up to be that guy who can tell you the truth

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:22.060
but he's so outlandish about other things that no one takes him seriously.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:30.540
I mean that was basically the idea with Bill Cooper right? I think what happened with Bill Cooper

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:39.020
is that they tricked him into believing that he saw spacecraft in in top secret areas so that when he

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.300
got out of the army and started preaching about how the American government was being

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.580
usurped and that we had to you know become part of the Berkshire Society and all this other stuff

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:57.100
a very libertarian type position that he his position would be discredited when he talked about UFOs.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:05.660
And whether or not he knew he was being played like that is another thing entirely but a lot of

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:14.860
this is done in that way. And I do think that it's possible that David Ike is one of these people who

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:20.300
plays that role where maybe even Alex Jones is a guy who plays this role where he tells the truth

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:28.300
about things and then the system uses him to discredit that truth. For example if Alex Jones

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:33.340
is telling the truth about Sandy Hook well that was a pretty nice way to completely discredit that

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:39.340
story forever wasn't it? And that's basically how they did it with a lot of a lot of these

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:45.900
narratives is they set someone up to be debunked and then now that story is debunked for everybody.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.940
And so David Ike revealing that there was no virus is very similar to Andy Kaufman saying that

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:58.940
there's no virus and then not wanting to discuss exosomes anymore. Not wanting to discuss anything

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:04.460
else but the isolation of viruses and and the isolation of this virus rather than wanting to

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:11.500
tell the whole story of the fraud and staying very compartmentalized within that and then always

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:17.900
always always Tom Cowan and these other people inevitably get to things that they definitely

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.740
don't understand like the physics of water on small scale or or the electrostatic forces at play

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:31.820
in in a solvent and then they talk about water crystals and how people are freezing water and

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:37.900
capturing images in them and it so then at the same time as they're saying there's no virus

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.060
because they're lying about coronavirus they also start talking about things that we can

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:50.620
at least on the surface say that they're a little bit nutty and that's the idea it's exactly how it

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:58.620
works and anybody that tries to put it all together gets discredited. It's that simple

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.620
and after four years it should be easier for all of us to see it. It really should.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:11.740
Mental products is no longer supportable. The war on Ivermectin is waged by very powerful

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:17.420
forces with a lot of money. I mean public health was built on an obsessive global vaccination policy

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.020
which Ivermectin would have threatened.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:28.140
They've got Pfizer's third quarter earnings revenue they're projecting to be 98 to 102 billion dollars.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:33.500
Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna. Do you know how much profit they made from these shots?

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.020
$1,000 every second from Wuhan virus vaccines.

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.260
You're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in geopolitical implications

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:49.820
that would be significantly affected if the people had access to a safe and widely available

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:58.140
medicine. This is an incredibly cheap drug it's off-licence it's generic it can be manufactured

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.620
in huge amounts in India remarkably low cost.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:08.060
Works patent on Ivermectin expired in 1996. In 2021 Merck released a statement claiming

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:12.540
that Ivermectin was not an effective treatment against COVID-19 and bizarrely claimed quote

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:17.180
a concerning lack of safety data and the majority of studies. It was plenty safe for Merck to

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.180
distribute widely when it was still under patent but now they're claiming the safety record is

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:26.940
insufficient. And they actually made mopovinir which is just a version of Ivermectin right and so

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.100
they just made another patented version of it which is not a very effective drug either which

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:38.140
should tell you a lot about the apparent effectiveness of Ivermectin. Folks need to understand that just

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:46.220
because there is an article out there that asserts that something is false recognize that those are

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:54.060
paid. Recognize that people who say it's true could be paid too. Every major media outlet in the

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:59.340
United States shares at least one board member with at least one drug company. Let me put in

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:04.380
perspective for you these board members wake up they go to a meeting at Merck or Pfizer and then

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:09.980
they have their driver take them over to meeting with NBC to decide what kind of programming that

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:15.980
network is going to air. They can't be honest and objective about big pharma because big pharma

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:21.660
pays their bills. In fact one analysis claimed that nine out of the top 10 drug makers spent

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:29.980
more on marketing than they did on research. CNN tonight brought to you by Pfizer brought to you

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:35.020
by Pfizer brought to you by Pfizer brought to you by Pfizer brought to you by Pfizer brought

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:40.460
to you by Pfizer. Now even this brought to you by Pfizer don't you think it's also possible that

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:47.420
they just did that they don't need to advertise but if they throw it in your face like that

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:58.140
I think they did that on purpose for us. For us to go see look we can make cuts like this they

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:08.860
really are awful. It's too odd. I mean it doesn't even make sense unless they were messing with us

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:15.660
the whole time and that's what you need to see on all of those where Maddow covers it and they

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.940
make fun of it on all these shows while the other people are saying no it's great.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:30.780
It's not possible for the truth to be you know I mean one of those two's got to be lying right?

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:38.860
He says it's black he says it's white but they can't both be right and now you're solving their

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:45.580
mystery. Now you're engaging in their debate and this debate presupposes the existence of a novel

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:50.060
virus for which a novel treatment is not only necessary but currently unknown.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:02.300
If asked the question did you know how much influence your former employer had on big media

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:08.140
and so on I have no idea it is clear that the pharmaceutical industry has has a great deal of

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:14.060
sway on what goes on if you can shape the message then you can shape the world and that's what

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:19.020
they've done. What was the last time you turned on the news and ever got an update about how

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:25.020
why aren't we talking about the fact that CIA also influences the news. Why aren't we talking

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:30.780
about the fact that NSA is monitoring all internet traffic in America and around the world if they

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.940
can. Why aren't we talking about these things? Why are we talking about pharmaceutical companies

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:40.700
as being the big baddies? What about SEPI? What about the who?

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:47.500
What about this biosecurity state? What about Chinese government? What about

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:58.940
everybody so sure they know who did it. I have a feeling a lot of people took part in the faking

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:05.100
of the stopping and starting of the train and now they're all trying to slowly take their hands

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:10.620
off the train and back away a little bit but they all can't do it at once or all suddenly

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:17.420
figure out that it's not true. And there's a lot of panic going on right now as we start to leave

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:23.180
the subway station and not watch their big show anymore. There's a lot of panic happening right

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:29.180
now because all that gets left is questioning the whole childhood vaccine schedule and the whole

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:34.940
public health has a whole and the only thing they've got are the skilled TV watchers. Everybody else

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:42.780
is breaking free fast. Lots of them are breaking free because people are having

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:50.140
unexpected aneurysms at age 48. High school kids are having heart attacks

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:57.980
and people are having all kinds of new advanced cancer that went away and came back

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.940
new cancer they never thought they've had accelerated faster than ever before.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:11.260
I don't know how that figures in with a with a bio agent that is causing pre-on disease that we

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:18.540
still haven't found yet. The team worst case scenario is still working to preserve the narrative

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:28.460
wittingly or unwittingly willingly or unwillingly they're all doing it. This is an old video here

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:32.060
they're doing a show here now. The rest of the world is handling COVID. My wife brought

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.620
me a sweet role so I'm going to eat it. Has launched an urgent caught up the table. It's very very

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:42.300
tasty. They're seeking easier access to Ivermectin. Globally at least five countries want to use Ivermectin

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:48.300
to treat COVID-19 including India and Argentina. There are numerous concrete tests in medical

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:55.100
journals around the world that Ivermectin does work. The earliest reports we had one of them we had

01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.460
in Peru where they got into a good mode of using multi drug treatment with an Ivermectin based

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:05.180
approach that they were crushing their curves. And the president of the Tokyo Medical Association

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:09.420
announced to all doctors during a summer surge that they should use Ivermectin in the treatment.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:17.340
Within weeks the hospitalization rates reported out of Japan were lower than at any other time

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.220
in the pandemic. And we've got to check to make sure that it was only Ivermectin that they did.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:28.060
Did they also start treating with antibiotics in the normal way of treating pneumonia?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.700
These questions remain unanswered but my guess is the answer to those questions will not be

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:43.420
happy times for Ivermectin. The real proof positive came when COVID-19 really hit hard in Mexico City.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:49.340
They finally after lots of struggle came with an Ivermectin based multi drug approach and

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:53.580
literally cleared out the hospitals. And then we have reports all the way through

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:58.540
that various states in India. In India the government has been widely promoting the use of

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:07.740
now please understand that both Pierre Kory and Peter McCalla said in that segment that these

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:16.140
places started a multi drug approach that used Ivermectin. So from their perspective and from the

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:22.060
perspective of this video the only substance that mattered in the treatment was Ivermectin but it

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:29.580
was a multi drug approach. Just make sure you're hearing what they're saying because those are

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:35.500
real words that matter. Ivermectin state leaders have just declared that Uttar Pradesh is now

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:42.220
officially COVID free. A region with nearly as many people as the entire United States

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:49.980
is totally COVID free. The miracle success of Uttar Pradesh not one mention of Ivermectin being

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.140
used. In the countries that it has been used in the countries where the studies are the results

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:58.940
are not good. They are overwhelming. They are well over 90% success rate. In the United States

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:06.220
it's a horse dewormer it's horse-paced and only the illiterate ignorant and or unvaccinated user.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:12.060
The key paradox is if you look at mortality rate in the United States one of the most

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.820
highly funded medical care systems in the world and what we find is the mortality in the United

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:23.420
States is among the worst in the world. If you look at these innumerable failed policies there's

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.100
only one way to understand them. They are literally written by pharmaceutical companies. They can

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:34.540
design trials to fail to disprove the use of cheat medicines and they can make things appear

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.180
that they don't work. And what about what about these protocols that can kill people?

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:47.500
What about the protocols using Remdesivir and ventilators and not using antibiotics?

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:54.940
Because again we're blaming the pharmaceutical companies for something that was actually

01:21:54.940 --> 01:22:03.500
orchestrated by protocols that were dictated by the government run by military people.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:12.300
And so it's maybe not a question about whether the DOD did what they did with the shot.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.580
So much of the fact that they did what they did with the mass casualty events

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:23.820
that were necessary to establish the appearance of a spreading pathogen that could be modeled

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:30.540
to be the worst case scenario. And we are being distracted into believing that the DOD is responsible

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:35.900
for the rollout of the shot when the DOD was very very much responsible for the rollout of

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:42.300
the mass casualty events that could be turned around and said to be spreading COVID. And they

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:49.500
needed those military people in those you can look at Jessica's latest article and you can see

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:57.980
that there were military people in these ICUs who are basically probably terminating people on Medicare.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:09.020
Ladies and gentlemen, I see the light of the opening of the cave. I don't need my flashlight anymore.

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:17.340
I'm so close. It's starting to get cold because the air is so fresh. Holy man, it's exciting.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:25.900
I sit as a non-voting member of the active committee for drugs within IH. I've seen the

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.660
dynamics of what are going on with all those trials, which most of which have failed.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:36.300
Unfortunately, it's eminently possible to manipulate the outcomes of a clinical study. If you want

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:42.060
to study to fail, that's dead easy. Now there are fourth quote-unquote negative study of IH.

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:48.540
In a major medical journal and each time is a media frenzy. There was a systematic review looking

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.900
at randomized control. Hey, don't you one for one second think that I put Tim Truth

01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:03.420
in the same bucket as Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan. Tim Truth has been very open to hearing my

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:13.100
side of the story. Very open to listening to my side and amplifying it. And so Tim Truth may very

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:18.940
well be on the no virus team and he's right to be there. But Tim Truth was never one of these

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.900
people who said I'm not going to talk to you Jay unless you tell me first that there's no virus.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.620
And I'm not going to talk to you about clones Jay. I'm only going to talk to you about the words

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:37.420
isolation and purification. Tim Truth was absolutely open to all possibilities and

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:43.180
discussions. And so Tim Truth just gets a big gold star for me for this just for being ahead of me

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:52.060
on it. I couldn't see it for what it was. Just a great big bait and switch with some excess deaths

01:24:52.060 --> 01:25:00.380
created by protocols modeled as spread. And then just a massive abuse of us psychologically on

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.580
social media and on television to make us believe something happening that was not.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:13.020
I am so excited how much progress we are making trial that happened done. And they found that there

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.620
was no benefit for Ivermectin in reducing mortality, death to COVID-19, no reduction in symptoms

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:23.340
or duration of symptoms for COVID-19. So it does not work. People need to understand that

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:31.020
academics have been threatened with losing their position and threatened with getting no further

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:37.420
research grants if they speak out against the narrative. Guess why that is? Two-thirds of the

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:45.260
world's non-commercial biological research is funded by just three bodies. The welcome trust

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:52.540
in the UK, the NIH and specifically the NIAID under Tony Fauci and the Bill and the indicates

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:59.100
foundation. There's this pattern that is consistent with a concerted effort to mislead the public by

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:06.460
withholding information using modern technology, media, censorship. Really, let's call it what it

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:12.940
is thought control. He could actually control exactly what people think. And that is the that

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:19.740
is a hard job. Whenever you have clear cut evidence that a drug works, you have an ethical

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:25.500
obligation to immediately let the people know so that they could have access. What are you telling

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:32.060
people? Holy crap. Did you see that? I want. Did you see that they actually took the clip

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:39.660
of Tony Fauci saying that Remdesivir showed effectiveness and therefore we had to institute

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:46.380
it immediately. And they turned around and they used it and applied it to Ivermectin not to say

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:52.780
that those words can't be taken out of context creatively and used like this. But it's it's exactly

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:59.260
what I talked about 15 or 20 minutes ago when I said that the only guy on our side who came out

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:06.220
about Ivermectin and came out very succinctly to explain why it wouldn't work, why it was

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:13.180
deadly, why it was a ridiculous idea that he sat on that couch and pushed it and not one sucker on

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:19.660
our side picked it up after he dropped the ball on the venom thing. And who knows if he dropped

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:27.660
the ball on the venom thing? Maybe they have put small epitopes generated from or derived from

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:36.460
venom into this spike protein sequence. I don't know. But the point is is that what the orchestrated

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:47.500
media theater did was they use that gaff about cobra venom to discredit artists and the whole

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:58.700
show allowed his brilliant insight on Remdesivir to go down with him. Not one of these clever

01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:04.300
people picked up that, well, David artists might have been wrong. And that's fine about that. But

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:08.540
he wasn't wrong about Remdesivir. And we shouldn't forget that that was a great contribution to our

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:17.260
breakout. Nope. Everybody forgot. And here we are. We have this video about Ivermectin and we

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:23.980
actually took those those things out of context when it could be an additional dunk. It's one of

01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:32.700
the biggest dunks of all. Then a drug that was predicted to be useful for a novel coronavirus pandemic

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:41.980
by by by Alison Totura, the last postdoc of have Ralph Barrick before the pandemic.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:50.060
And Cina Bavari in 2019, an article that there might be a coronavirus breakout and that Remdesivir

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:57.020
at the time still had some crazy letter numbered name would be useful in such a scenario.

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:05.660
And just a few few months later, here's Tony Fauci on the couch of the White House saying that

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:11.020
this new drug Remdesivir is effective and it would be just absolutely ridiculous ethics not to use

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:23.660
it immediately. And away we go. And so the past is erased. The erasure is forgotten and the lie

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:30.380
becomes truth. Do you see? One of the greatest stories of the pandemic has now just been co-opted

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.540
into the Ivermectin story. It's like, what really? Is that really how we're going to do this?

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:44.140
A pill, orally administered single pill given for seven to ten days, little drug-drug interaction

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:52.540
and low toxicity. Give me that and I'll be really happy. Ivermectin has been used safely for decades,

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:59.420
has no known drug interactions, won a Nobel Prize for its success treating humans and is on the WHO's

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:03.820
I would agree with with I would agree with

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:13.660
I would agree with the person who said that artist was probably set up to hang that Remdesivir story

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:18.940
and I think that's probably true. That that's one definite possibility anyway. Let's say it like that.

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:27.740
And so again, let's let's cite this for what it is. There is an extreme set of contradictory

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:35.180
information that was being released at this time. Bad protocols, bad clinical trials,

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:39.740
mischaracterization of doses or mischaracterization of uses

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:48.940
and a bunch of people on social media and on mainstream media complaining that it was a poison

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:54.860
making fun of people who taking it and that on the other side people saying it's a vital drug

01:30:54.860 --> 01:31:00.380
that they're covering up that could save millions of lives. So it is ultra-contradictory. One side

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:06.300
says it can kill you and it's useless. The other side says that it's great for everything and it

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:12.780
it's say could save millions of lives. And that huge gigantic contradiction is the same as

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:18.460
has somebody arguing that no, Michael Jordan is a really crappy basketball player. No,

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:22.140
Jordan is a really good basketball player. Only one person can be right

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:31.260
and they want you to feel that way. They want the two conclusions to be so far apart

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:38.300
that it is impossible for you to to to conceive a middle ground.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.540
Michael Jordan is the best basketball player that's ever lived. Michael Jordan is a washed up

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:52.940
chump who never did anything good. There's obviously one is very close to the truth

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:58.780
probably and another one is ridiculous. And with these two narratives about

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:05.820
Ivermectin, they're both ridiculous. But because you're given this dichotomy that's so far apart

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:12.140
and so contradictory, the logic in your brain almost forces you to choose one.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:19.260
That's the magic of this. That's one of the many tricks that they use.

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:26.060
Safest, most effective medicines in the entire world. And it showed an 86% effectiveness to

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:31.740
prevent people from contracting COVID. Ivermectin has been used over four billion times and it's

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:38.700
used for a wide variety of treatments. Ivermectin has been shown to possess different anti-information,

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.660
antiviral, and anti-tumor properties. That is the thing about Ivermectin. It's not good,

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:50.380
it's great. Breaking news, the FDA lawyer announces that Ivermectin can be subscribed for COVID-19.

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:57.340
I have never seen an evidence base this large with 81 controlled trials. 10 years of in vitro

01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:03.340
studies in the lab against a dozen RNA viruses all showing that Ivermectin stops replication.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:09.980
It literally is, in my mind, the single greatest public health achievement in our history of

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:20.380
infection control in the world. Now, there is a possibility, of course, that Ivermectin is a

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:30.940
wonder drug and an antiviral. And in the face of a transfection, in the face of a RNA pathogen,

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.620
or whatever it is that uses an enzyme to replicate that in an in vivo preparation,

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:42.140
it seems to stop replication. But I want to see those studies. I want to see what they're using for

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:47.740
the RNA virus. And I want to see what they're using as a readout because I bet we're going to

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:54.060
be back to right where we started, where the no-virus people would just dissect that and tear it apart.

01:33:54.700 --> 01:34:05.180
I think that's where we will be. And so, my conjecture is, again, here that these orchestrated

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:13.260
debates about things were designed very specifically to convert all excess deaths into a mystery virus,

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:20.700
for which we needed special cures for brand new cures like hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin.

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:30.460
It couldn't just be antibiotics and a steroid at the right time. It couldn't just be vitamin C,

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:42.140
D, and zinc, and some, you know, warm blanket, chicken soup. It had to be ventilators and remdesivir

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:50.300
in order to create the excess deaths that could be used to justify the slope right here. This slope

01:34:50.300 --> 01:35:02.700
was created. This was created. It was created by dumb ideas and maybe even by intervention.

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:09.740
But it was not caused by a spreading respiratory pathogen. You can see it more clearly when you

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:19.500
show the graph with all cause mortality behind it. Total deaths every week since 2014 to

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:26.940
2022, they ignored all of this stuff in order to create a pandemic out of nothing.

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.540
They killed a lot of people on Medicare in order to save the money that they would have cost in

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:40.620
the years to come. They killed a lot of people in Medicaid or Medicare old folks homes to save

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:47.020
the money that they would cost to keep them alive. And they did it all with all of these protocols

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:55.900
and lack of protocol. And then the argument is, is that if we don't do all of this garbage,

01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:00.460
but instead give them a little antibiotics in Ivermectin to look at that, they're all cured.

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:09.900
Oh, surprise, surprise. We're still not talking about strict liability for all vaccine products.

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:15.340
We're still not talking about it being a Seventh Amendment violation for the PrEP Act to prevent

01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:21.420
me from using a a normal court to sue for damages. We're still not talking about there

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:29.340
being zero epidemiological evidence for spread. And we're still not talking about these lost

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:33.900
this, this money that was saved by killing all these old people and they're misconstruing it as

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:40.620
a spreading virus. And that's because they've got us right now and we've got to really start

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.020
to push back if we're going to get out of this trap. We've got about nine or 10 months, I think,

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:50.060
before more more shenanigans are going to happen. And that's a very optimistic appraisal.

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:56.140
But I don't feel that there's anything quite ready to go yet. And I do feel like there's a lot of

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:02.140
scrambling going on, but it were not we are in danger of the lie becoming truth, especially for

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:09.420
our children. And so that's why we've got to be very vigilant about this. And I think I'm just

01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:17.660
going to end it right there. Let me see what this was. We don't need to do that, I don't think.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:26.540
No, we don't need to do that. But we can, it'll go really quick. Don't forget, like a mixed tape,

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:33.020
right? They take viruses out of the wild, they can't really grow them in a culture very well.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.980
So what they do instead is that they sequence in the best they can, they fill in the blanks

01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:43.020
from other coronavirus sequences that have been reported in the past. They make a DNA molecule

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:47.820
construct of it, and then they use a series of plasmids to replicate that DNA molecule and make

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:56.540
many copies of it. And so those plasmids are grown in bacterial cultures, and then those bacteria

01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:02.940
can be liced and broken open, and you get those plasmids DNA out of those guys, you combine them

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:07.820
with a commercial enzyme or a cell culture or electropyrate them into a cell culture,

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:15.020
and you can turn that DNA into RNA or into proteins. And so that RNA made with RNA polymerase could

01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:19.420
be put on cell culture for experiments, it could be given to animals for experiments,

01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:24.540
it could be stored and shared with other researchers. More importantly, infectious clone technology

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:31.900
allows infectious clone RNA to be made in large quantities, so that in theory,

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:38.540
a distribution of these large quantities of RNA could result in the appearance of a spreading RNA

01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:46.300
pathogen, which I think we've come to the conclusion that RNA can't do a pandemic. But RNA infectious

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:51.420
clones could definitely be used to seed the molecular biology that could be misconstrued

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:58.700
as a pandemic, especially if we have this virus on the background of previous RNA signals,

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:06.060
which have never bothered to be undifferentiated from pathogen and exosome and all kinds of other

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:11.900
signals that we know are there. And so that's the job of some of these people on the playing field.

01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.940
What you have to realize is that we weren't supposed to figure this out this fast, we are supposed to

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:22.860
be the playing field on which these people operate. And they're supposed to be messing with each other

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:30.060
using people like me and Mark. But now that we have started to see through how these people have

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:35.580
been messing with the narrative via messing with us, it started to become harder for them to push

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:41.740
back and forth between one another. And it appears to be that some of these criminal syndicates are

01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:47.340
actually starting to push against one another directly and trying very hard to just ignore

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:55.900
my work, Mark's work and the work of Jessica Hockett. And of course, of Nick Hudson and Thomas Binder

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:04.540
and Denis Rancourt and Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal. Please check out the sub stack of Jessica

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:09.180
Martin and Jonathan that they just released. You can find that on Jessica's sub stack. It's really

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:16.700
good. And it talks a lot about it interviews a whistleblower that puts a lot of a lot of meat

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:21.740
on these bones as well. So there's there the ball is moving very rapidly. But please don't

01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:27.980
forget that we wandered all throughout 2020 and 2021. And none of these people helped us.

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:35.660
We didn't get picked up by their car until June of 2021 at the earliest.

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:44.140
Only Michael Yeden and Wolfgang Wodach and Crütt Wodkowski and myself and a few others were coming

01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:50.220
out against the narrative and coming out against the shots before they were released. And these

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:55.740
people all started coming out and speaking out much, much later. And if they came out at all,

01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.460
some of these people in the top corner here are just worst case scenario from the very beginning.

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.020
Some of them have been saying amyloidosis and prion disease since the very beginning

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:15.500
and still continue to say it now. Keeping us on this road. Keeping us wandering or maybe giving

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:21.420
us a ride in their car for a little while, but all the while never never planning to take us

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.180
over the finish line. So they have sustained this illusion of consensus about a laboratory or

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:32.140
badcave zoonosis about a bio weapon in this faith in a novel virus, whatever it is,

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:37.180
is going to be used to try and govern our children in the future. And the way we break out of this

01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:42.860
is to not let them board this train. We cannot let them board this train where there's a

01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:47.020
symptomatic transmission where when they go to the doctor, they need a test for 17 different

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:55.740
pathogens and it's all based on PCR. We don't need mRNA for any healthy humans ever, no matter

01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:01.100
what form it's in, no matter how they want to transfect us, we don't need it. We don't need it

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:05.660
because healthy humans, your medicine should be your food and your food should be your medicine.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.860
We can't let our children grow up believing that people work on viruses in laboratories.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:17.180
We definitely can't let our children grow up believing what Robert Malone said earlier in the

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:22.460
program that bachelor students in biology can enrich pathogens in their garage.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:29.740
This faith is a lie. It was a conflated background signal. It's become very obvious to me that one

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:37.740
very plausible explanation for this is that they took a bunch of people like Nathan Wolf type

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:43.340
people like Andrew Huff type people like eco-health alliance type people whatever and they spent

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:49.020
about three years characterizing the conflated background signal rather the background signal

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:54.380
that they intended to conflate and then they told us a story and they

01:42:54.940 --> 01:43:00.220
enacted a very elaborate theater about a cover up and a very elaborate theater about a novel

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:04.140
virus that needed novel cures. It was killing millions of people that millions more could be

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:11.580
saved from and likely came from gain of function all the while just using data that they had gathered

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:16.140
knowledge that they had gathered about what this background signal was like and how that they

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:20.540
could use it as a confounder for PCR tests and for sequencing.

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:29.260
It is a biosecurity operation for national security reasons all the marbles are on the table

01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:35.020
and therefore lying to achieve your goals is definitely on the table

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:43.180
and lying to achieve your bioterrorism goals is definitely on the table. We are being governed by

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:50.700
mythology because we are at a time point where we are at a peak forever. The largest pure population

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:57.740
homogenous genetic population on earth in India and in China will not exist forever and the largest

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:03.580
heterogeneous population of multiracial people in America will never exist forever.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:11.260
These populations perfect research populations the heterogeneous version in America the homogenous

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:19.820
version in certain places around the world in Asia presents a once in a species opportunity

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:28.140
to collect the data to do the experiments necessary to bridge the gap from wherever we are now to

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:34.060
this futurist version of humanity where we are our own engineers our own programmers

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:42.620
and we do it with AI this is what they tell each other in these meetings these are the

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:48.140
opportunities that they see and that's why they are behaving the way that they are behaving and I think

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:54.940
there are more and more people starting to understand the significance of this interpretation of the

01:44:54.940 --> 01:45:00.460
story. I'm not saying that it's not about CBDCs I'm not saying it's not about digital IDs I'm saying

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:07.900
those things are also about ultimately harnessing the population of the earth as as experiments

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:14.060
so that we can bridge this gap between where we are now and a trans human future. Ladies and

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:20.860
gentlemen please follow Housatonic Live Mark Kulacz and please follow Jessica Hockett on twitter and

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:25.180
other than that right now I'm just going to be very conservative and say that's enough reading

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:31.740
for now Mark's website start with the early covid survivors link and after that I suggest

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:36.620
that you just explore from A to Z and find out where it leads you ladies and gentlemen this has

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:42.380
been gigaohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you a biobiologist

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:47.420
my name is Jonathan Cooley and I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh in the back of my garage and

01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:54.780
I will probably see you tomorrow although I do have a basketball game in the morning we are fine

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:59.740
in the afternoon and then Sunday I've got a morning game so I can probably do afternoon or

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:04.620
evening on Saturday and Sunday and that's the plan right now thanks very much for joining me

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:09.900
please keep sharing my work please keep stopping all transfections and humans and don't let them

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.380
eliminate the control group um intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:18.860
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb. Transfection and help the humans is

01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:24.060
criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity. Thank you very much I recorded a

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:28.780
doctor's and scientist interview about the book today and I think I really took a

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:34.060
tool about the clones and about how reality is that they probably didn't need to do what they

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:40.460
said happened so hopefully it'll it'll bring some some extra fire to the to the debate about the

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:47.020
book even though it's not selling very well that's fine um it's still uh it's still uh it's still out

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:52.380
there and um we got a lot of time yet so thank you very much for joining me and uh see you again

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:31.340
bye
