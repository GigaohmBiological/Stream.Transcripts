00:00.000 --> 00:12.240
This is a stolen song from an acoustic concert by Eric Johnson in Germany a couple of years

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
ago.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.600
I'm just using a different set of music to start the show today.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.760
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga Ohm Biological, a high-resistance low-noise information

00:20.760 --> 00:23.240
brief brought to you by a biologist.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.200
This illusion that we are trapped in is only sustained through your active participation,

00:28.200 --> 00:35.120
and my guest this afternoon is someone who knows this truth all too well, and so it's

00:35.120 --> 00:37.040
a real privilege for me.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.920
I don't interview very many people on Giga Ohm Biological, usually I'm just ranting

00:40.920 --> 00:46.880
into the wind, and today I have the privilege of being able to sit back and listen to somebody

00:46.880 --> 00:53.140
who's a further down this road than most of us are and has more skin in the game than

00:53.140 --> 00:55.640
most of us have.

00:55.640 --> 01:01.560
I know that everybody is very familiar with this little logo here, human just like you.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.040
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey, welcome to the show.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.320
This is Giga Ohm Biological.

01:06.320 --> 01:14.960
I am interviewing the father of a girl by the name of Grace.

01:14.960 --> 01:21.440
Scott actually interviewed me last week, and it was a really insightful interview.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.720
I'll show a link up later on.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.560
Scott is now on the screen.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.960
Thank you very much for joining me, Scott.

01:28.960 --> 01:35.720
It's a real privilege for me to host you and try to get your message and your voice out

01:35.720 --> 01:37.120
a little farther.

01:37.120 --> 01:43.120
I apologize for my sort of awkward handling of the music there.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.120
If you would, I think it's easier for you, you're probably more rehearsed in it than

01:47.120 --> 01:48.120
I am.

01:48.120 --> 01:55.520
Introduce yourself and then I'll kind of cue off where if people aren't familiar with

01:55.520 --> 02:02.320
your work, just assume that because I think I tweeted out last week's podcast after you

02:02.320 --> 02:07.040
sent it to me on Saturday, but other than that, I've only heard a few hundred comments

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
about it.

02:08.040 --> 02:11.120
I do hear that people have seen it, but I still need to push it a little further and

02:11.120 --> 02:13.040
I was going to push it after this show as well.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.800
So go ahead, please, Scott.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.720
Well, sounds good.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
I'm a nobody.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
I'm just a dad.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.200
I call myself Grace's dad because of that.

02:21.200 --> 02:27.960
And what happened is through Grace's murder, ultimately I woke up and we're going to spend

02:27.960 --> 02:34.560
a lot of time talking about that today because Jonathan says I'm ahead of him.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
I don't know.

02:35.560 --> 02:40.480
I don't know very many people who are ahead of him, but I have connected some dots that

02:40.480 --> 02:45.240
I'm shocked and the doors that God has opened up to do that, but it all started with my

02:45.240 --> 02:47.640
best buddy, Grace.

02:47.640 --> 02:54.920
Grace had Down syndrome and she was a complete gift from God.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.480
Anybody who knows somebody would Down syndrome knows that.

02:57.480 --> 03:04.280
Most people think that Down syndrome people, they are very slow and whatever your perception

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
is.

03:05.280 --> 03:11.320
In fact, we had people write to us after Grace died and said, well, now that she's in heaven,

03:11.320 --> 03:14.720
she doesn't have Down syndrome, which they don't get it.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.200
I personally think everybody in heaven has Down syndrome.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.000
Don't rake to me saying I don't get that.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.880
I don't know what heaven is like.

03:23.880 --> 03:29.680
I just know that Grace is there and I know that she's lifting the spirits of everybody

03:29.680 --> 03:31.720
that is there, which is wonderful.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.400
Can you expand on that a little bit more without causing too much pain?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.560
What about her?

03:38.560 --> 03:43.360
So you say that as if people think that they're not real people and I know that that's not

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
true.

03:44.360 --> 03:50.880
Grace is a, sorry, I say was, he was because he's retired, a special ed teacher and so

03:50.880 --> 03:59.600
I grew up knowing a lot of the spectrum of cognitive abilities that are there and can

03:59.600 --> 04:06.760
be there and it's extraordinary how vehemently my father would argue that all of those kids

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
are there.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.760
Absolutely.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, I can go into it.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
I'd love to do that.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.280
That was my favorite part of any show.

04:14.280 --> 04:21.800
So Grace, first of all, she had a love that you can't get.

04:21.800 --> 04:29.240
You can't get because we become very judgmental the older we get and she did not have that.

04:29.240 --> 04:34.600
She approached every single person as a gift and so she just loved everybody.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.320
So that was pretty neat.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.800
As you look at the details, one of the things that happened to Cindy, my wife's name is

04:41.800 --> 04:45.800
Cindy and I, is that God blinded us to her disability.

04:45.800 --> 04:51.440
So we just did everything with her as if the sky was the limit and so I taught her how

04:51.440 --> 04:52.440
to drive.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.800
She deer hunted with me.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.800
She played violin at our daughter Jessica's wedding.

04:58.800 --> 05:05.680
She rode a horse, she could public speak and she was a great joke teller but I want to show

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
you something.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.640
I had this for my own podcast this morning.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
I shared this.

05:10.640 --> 05:16.120
I keep this in my wallet and it will kind of give you a sense of Grace.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.840
So you'll be able to see this when I hope, when I hold it up.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.360
So you see what it says is, so this is just a little card, you know, when she gave me

05:24.360 --> 05:27.200
my Christmas gift and this was just a tad.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.800
So it says to earthly dad.

05:28.800 --> 05:34.400
So she called the earthly dad from Grace Emily and you see, you know, how creative she is

05:34.400 --> 05:40.880
with her signature and then, you know, the hearts and that's just who she was.

05:40.880 --> 05:47.880
And she did elaborate cards that were just, they were all masterpieces was really, really

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
something.

05:48.880 --> 05:55.640
And then, you know, on top of her love, she had a sense of humor.

05:55.640 --> 06:01.880
I taught her my dry, literal sense of humor and I'll just, you know, I'll give credit

06:01.880 --> 06:03.240
to my son.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.680
My son Travis is the one who got me into this when he was really little.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.840
You know, he would, he would look at things literally and so this literal sense of humor

06:12.840 --> 06:15.840
became kind of our, our family mantra.

06:15.840 --> 06:21.320
So he, he's when back when there was newspapers, you know, he, I was reading the newspaper

06:21.320 --> 06:26.000
one morning and he wants me to do whatever and I said, Travis, I'll, I'll be there in

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
a minute.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.040
And he said to me, Dad, how come when people say a minute, they really don't mean it.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.560
I thought, Oh my gosh, I mean, this, in this started to become, we started looking for

06:34.560 --> 06:39.440
this stuff and it's, it's a hoot when you start looking for literal things, like look

06:39.440 --> 06:45.600
at expiration dates on, you know, the expiration date isn't just a date than most things.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.840
It's an exact timestamp.

06:47.840 --> 06:55.120
You know, so the cheese expires on March 13th at 2204, you know, it isn't at, you know,

06:55.120 --> 06:59.160
it just didn't say, you know, so you start looking at these details, you think, Oh my

06:59.160 --> 07:02.440
gosh, I had to just be inhaling that cheese a minute before, you know, because it's going

07:02.440 --> 07:04.560
to expire at 2204.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
It's over.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.560
Right.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.480
Anyway, so Grace, she picked up on this and it was just a blast.

07:09.480 --> 07:14.680
So one time we're right in the truck and she says to me, she hears the pigly wiggly jingle.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.680
Yeah.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.360
And so most people are familiar with it, but you know, I'm not going to sing it because

07:18.360 --> 07:21.720
I don't have that voice, but it's, you know, pig, pigly wiggly shop the pig.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
So we're driving the truck.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
She's a dad.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.280
That doesn't make any sense.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.240
I said, what do you mean, Grace?

07:27.240 --> 07:29.440
She said, well, you can't shop a pig.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.680
First you shoot the pig, then you eat the pig, but you don't shop a pig.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
Yeah.

07:33.680 --> 07:41.280
So anyway, yeah, she just, she was, she was special things, strange things happened.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.920
You know, I never knew what was going to happen with her either, Jonathan.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.320
So we had Grace, my wife went to, Oh gosh, I should tell this story.

07:51.320 --> 07:56.360
So you're not, is this, is this show G rated or can we go a little bit out there?

07:56.360 --> 07:57.760
Oh, you can go a little bit out there.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.760
It's okay.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.760
So this one I've never told.

08:00.760 --> 08:05.680
Oh my gosh, I told this, uh, strangely I told that at her funeral, but as I'm going

08:05.680 --> 08:08.800
to tell you, uh, so this is how Grace was.

08:08.800 --> 08:15.160
So my wife had a hip replacement in September of 2016.

08:15.160 --> 08:20.760
And we went to the doctor in January of 2017 for a checkup.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.920
So all three of us are in the doctor's office.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.240
You got to have a picture here now.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.480
So the doctor, so I'm going to set up the room.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.800
The doctor is in the front of the room.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.200
And then to his right, there's a computer screen with the x-ray of my wife's hip.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.040
So he's going to do an evaluation post hip replacement to show us what's going on.

08:40.040 --> 08:46.520
Then on the, the wall, um, next to the screen, going down, you know, away from the doctor

08:46.520 --> 08:50.360
is my wife is sitting, then Grace is sitting and I'm sitting.

08:50.360 --> 08:57.360
So now we've got the, the screen with the, the hip picture on and Grace turns to me.

08:57.360 --> 09:09.200
And she said, dad, don't be looking at the crotch area and the doctor, the doctor says

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
nice.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.200
That.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Oh my gosh.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.440
Yeah, this is how she was.

09:13.440 --> 09:18.120
I mean, she was so observant and I mean, why, of course that's what you're looking at is,

09:18.120 --> 09:21.880
you know, you're going to look at a hip or a crotch, you know, what, what choice is it,

09:21.880 --> 09:22.880
right?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.160
Anyway, that was a rapid trail.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.800
I wasn't planning on going down, but, you know, it's, uh, it's exactly what I was getting

09:29.800 --> 09:36.440
at, I guess, is that it's, um, uh, you mentioned on when I, when I was on your podcast that,

09:36.440 --> 09:43.320
that thousands of down syndrome babies are, are aborted every year now.

09:43.320 --> 09:50.000
I, I guess I, somewhere in the back of my head, I knew that that would in theory be

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
an option if you had amniocentesis and you found that, that anomaly that you could make

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
that decision.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.480
But I guess I had never looked into the numbers of, of children that are, it's just extraordinary

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
to me.

10:03.480 --> 10:09.120
And I, I know I mentioned this on your podcast or if I didn't, but isn't there and you must

10:09.120 --> 10:10.120
be aware of this.

10:10.120 --> 10:17.360
There's a, a French leader from long ago who had a down syndrome daughter, um, who he

10:17.360 --> 10:22.960
cherished his whole life, like, um, is it Francis De Gaulle?

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
I don't know.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.360
This is news to me.

10:25.360 --> 10:31.280
You have to look it up because he wrote poetry about her and stuff and, uh, spoke as highly

10:31.280 --> 10:38.280
of her as you do of your daughter in the same, you know, almost a soul that was impossible

10:38.360 --> 10:45.720
to, to, to, uh, distract, you know, uh, it's, it's, it's incredible.

10:45.720 --> 10:51.560
Um, I find that testimony to be really important from the simple perspective that it is matched

10:51.560 --> 10:56.920
by anyone else who's had the blessing of having someone like Grace in their life.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.120
I mean, there's no other stories.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.280
I don't, I don't know.

11:01.280 --> 11:07.680
I, I, well, our whole life became, uh, Charles De Gaulle, after a while, which was pretty

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
neat.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.960
I mean, um, you know, just share, I'll share this.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.800
And I want to go to that statistic about down syndrome kids being murdered in the womb

11:16.800 --> 11:23.800
because it really opens up, um, the, you know, this, this, Grace's murder, it started with

11:23.800 --> 11:24.800
down syndrome.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.560
And you know, as I see what's going on, you know, it's, it's way bigger than that.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.400
But this idea of the amniocentesis I want to come back to.

11:31.400 --> 11:36.400
But, you know, I just want to share this in, in just clothing up the, the background

11:36.400 --> 11:40.240
of Grace is the first couple of years of her life.

11:40.240 --> 11:45.960
Um, there's many times I, you know, you start processing as the dad, okay, she's never

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
going to get married.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.440
She's never going to live alone, you know, all these negative things.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.840
And I would get, you know, I'd cry because I thought she's never going to experience

11:53.840 --> 11:56.800
the things that I've been able to experience.

11:56.800 --> 12:02.840
And as, you know, Grace grew older and you realize what her abilities were versus her

12:02.840 --> 12:08.640
disability, I changed my complete frame of reference and I thought, I wish I had down

12:08.640 --> 12:09.640
syndrome.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.880
Well, then I really should apologize for saying that to all the parents out there who I'm

12:13.880 --> 12:16.480
sure go through something that I don't understand.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.720
So that, that was a little naive of me to say.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.240
So I appreciate you for that clearing that up.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.920
Well, it's just, she was, she was a gift.

12:23.920 --> 12:30.920
I mean, I, you know, I have lots of problems and they're, you know, they're self-inflicted

12:30.920 --> 12:36.160
because, you know, we want to control everything and Grace was the opposite.

12:36.160 --> 12:41.880
And that's why I thought, you know, I, after I realized what we had with her, you know,

12:41.880 --> 12:46.740
I thought I wish I had down syndrome, you know, she, once she understood that she had

12:46.740 --> 12:50.280
down syndrome, she saw herself as special.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.640
And we, we saw her as special and she was special.

12:53.640 --> 12:59.760
Anyway, this idea of the amniocentesis, what's going on is in the United States, 90% of

12:59.760 --> 13:03.320
down syndrome babies are aborted right now.

13:03.320 --> 13:10.760
And what I have discovered and what the idea of the amniocentesis led to is the business

13:10.760 --> 13:13.080
of standards of care.

13:13.080 --> 13:18.600
So we know with COVID, you know, you've become a COVID expert, I'm somewhat of a COVID expert,

13:18.600 --> 13:23.480
and I'm below that, below you, but I've expanded way beyond COVID.

13:23.480 --> 13:30.120
And it's because what, what COVID did was incentivize standards of care directly.

13:30.120 --> 13:36.120
So direct payments, but this business of standards of care has been around for decades.

13:36.120 --> 13:42.480
I've traced it back to the early 1980s when standards of care started to be written.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.240
So standards of care, as it applies to down syndrome, for example, when a young couple

13:47.240 --> 13:53.480
gets pregnant, they go into the doctor and the doctor says, congratulations, let's

13:53.480 --> 13:55.560
schedule your amniocentesis.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.760
And the young couple has no idea what that even is, but you know, they really just care.

14:00.760 --> 14:05.800
They've been programmed to ask one question, which is, does my insurance cover it?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.680
So their program to trust the white coat, does my insurance cover it?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.680
Well, of course your insurance covers it.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.360
So they go along with it.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.160
Well, the insurance covers it.

14:14.160 --> 14:20.400
There's a reason the insurance covers an amniocentesis is because the goal is to hasten

14:20.400 --> 14:26.360
death and specifically the low hanging fruit is the elderly and the disabled.

14:26.360 --> 14:31.880
So if they can prevent disabled people from entering the planet, that's considered good

14:31.880 --> 14:35.080
in this collectivism environment that we're in.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.800
So now the amniocentesis results come back.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.560
The doctor says, we suspect your son has down syndrome.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.520
I recommend an abortion.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.280
And if the people don't have any roots, they just go along with the white coat because

14:47.280 --> 14:48.880
that's the programming.

14:48.880 --> 14:55.640
And so they look at it as they're doing a favor to society that we don't have this burden

14:55.640 --> 14:58.000
on society.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.960
And just to give you the numbers, Jonathan, we have 135 million Americans on Medicare

15:02.960 --> 15:04.720
and Medicaid.

15:04.720 --> 15:12.000
That number translates to 50% of the annual federal budget, $3 trillion a year.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.320
And so if you've convinced the population of collectivism, so collectivism is the good

15:18.320 --> 15:24.480
of the population versus the good of the individual, then when you start overlaying, oh my gosh,

15:24.480 --> 15:30.120
they have been working on this for years, writing standards of care to hasten death because

15:30.120 --> 15:31.960
people are too expensive.

15:31.960 --> 15:37.000
So I've expanded it way beyond the elderly and the disabled to realize standards of

15:37.000 --> 15:40.240
care are written on purpose to hasten our death.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.800
And I'm going to give you a very specific example.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.800
So people think, well, I'm not disabled.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
I'm not elderly.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
I'm good to go.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
All right.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.400
Well, let's just apply it to cancer.

15:51.400 --> 15:57.360
I'm hosting a radio show on Friday, and I'm going to have an alternative cancer expert

15:57.360 --> 15:58.800
on that radio show.

15:58.800 --> 16:06.800
Anyway, the thing that I've seen and I see people that should know better, they have

16:06.800 --> 16:10.760
something wrong with them, they get a biopsy and it comes back cancer.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.760
All right.

16:11.760 --> 16:16.080
They don't realize the doctor only has three tools in his tool chest that are paid through

16:16.080 --> 16:17.360
standards of care.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.360
He can either cut, radiate or chemo.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.720
Those are the standards of care.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.200
That's it.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.960
So then the biopsy comes back, he has the meeting with the patient.

16:27.960 --> 16:32.080
And then he says, well, you have cancer, I can schedule your chemo treatment for next

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
week.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.600
And again, they're programmed, right?

16:34.600 --> 16:37.720
So they're also programmed, cut radiation chemo.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.080
They don't realize that there's other alternatives available.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.800
So then they say the program question, does my insurance cover it?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.560
Well, of course your insurance covers it.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.560
Why?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.400
Because the goal is to kill you.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.640
We got to get that through people's head.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.800
The goal is to kill us.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.480
When you see that, all of a sudden, your eyes are opened up.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.800
And the best thing people can do, I was on another radio show a couple of weeks ago,

17:01.800 --> 17:07.080
when a person called in and said, well, what do I do?

17:07.080 --> 17:11.520
And I said, the best thing you could do is get rid of your medical insurance.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.280
Because that's part of the programming.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.360
As soon as you have that burden released, now all of a sudden you start seeing the world

17:17.360 --> 17:19.360
through a completely different lens.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.600
I'm not letting the insurance company control my health.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.000
I'm going to start looking.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.680
Now I, OK, I've got cancer.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.000
OK, first of all, is that a good or bad thing?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.040
I mean, our body is designed to heal itself.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.240
All right, so then, OK, is it out of control?

17:34.240 --> 17:37.400
All right, well then, what are the alternatives?

17:37.400 --> 17:38.960
What's available?

17:38.960 --> 17:43.560
Well, you start looking and all of a sudden the world opens up to you as to what's available,

17:43.560 --> 17:46.640
because you're not controlled by the system anymore.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.080
But anyway, that's how far off the rails I've gone.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.840
Yeah, far off the rails is so some people might say it.

17:52.840 --> 17:57.240
For me, it really feels like what I characterized at the beginning of the show,

17:57.240 --> 17:59.040
which is you are farther along than I am.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.320
And when I hear you so succinctly say it, I love this.

18:04.320 --> 18:09.400
I'm going to adopt this idea and not adopt it, but start to teach it in this way,

18:09.400 --> 18:15.000
that their incentivized standards of care have existed inside of the system for a long time.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.960
And now if you see COVID through that lens and how much behavior can be controlled

18:22.960 --> 18:27.080
with that one little knob, it's pretty impressive.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.360
And and it's an interesting, you know, there are lots of parents, I believe,

18:31.360 --> 18:34.840
who might look at their their pregnancies differently,

18:34.840 --> 18:40.360
might look at their doctor experiences differently if if they heard this in the correct way.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.760
I mean, it was a little shocking for me.

18:42.760 --> 18:46.240
Still, I'll be very honest and I'm going to let you talk again when you said it,

18:46.240 --> 18:48.760
even in this interview, where we like they're out to kill us.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.920
It's it's a really hard thing for everyone to say, and he or said,

18:52.920 --> 18:56.040
and I have not actually been saying that,

18:56.040 --> 18:59.240
arguing that they don't necessarily need to kill us,

19:00.680 --> 19:03.560
but just not take care of our well-being at all.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.040
But from the perspective of of

19:08.680 --> 19:11.600
I want to get back and keep focused on Grace's story.

19:11.600 --> 19:20.160
So how how can we see clearly what they did to people in COVID through Grace's lens?

19:20.160 --> 19:28.800
How can we, I mean, because obviously we want to use the word murder when it's murder and and and and so.

19:28.800 --> 19:36.720
So what happened after Grace died, so her last day on Earth was October 13th of 2021.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.600
And I went into a different hospital three days later.

19:39.600 --> 19:45.120
This really helped me, you know, God had a way of orchestrating circumstances so that

19:45.760 --> 19:50.480
you you get you can see things through a different lens.

19:50.480 --> 19:56.000
And I'm going to I want to go through that circumstance and I want to go through a circumstance that happened in 1968.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.840
And then we're going to peel Grace's hospital stay back a little bit.

20:00.560 --> 20:06.320
So so Grace died October 13th. I went into a hospital October 16th.

20:06.320 --> 20:13.760
That hospital turned me around in 24 hours and they did it because first of all their attitude was different.

20:13.760 --> 20:18.800
But second of all, they did what was promised to Grace.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.840
So when I agreed to check Grace into the hospital, the Grace was fine.

20:23.840 --> 20:29.120
She just had a cold, but the COVID scyop had gotten into my head and the fear took over.

20:29.120 --> 20:34.640
And because her oxygen dropped to 88 percent on October 6th, well, you know, this is an emergency.

20:34.640 --> 20:41.120
The FLCCC protocol said if your oxygen drops below 94 percent, it makes yourself to the hospital.

20:41.200 --> 20:48.240
So I mean, I just saw it as my my duty as a dad did, but it was ultimately fear that was controlling me.

20:48.240 --> 20:52.880
And I had to repent of that. Ultimately, though, you know, why did I stop?

20:52.880 --> 20:58.160
Sorry. Did you just say that the FLCCC protocol said something about oxygen levels?

20:58.880 --> 21:02.000
Yes. Yep. I have that document yet if you want to see it.

21:02.720 --> 21:08.880
Yeah. So it said specifically, and I can screen share it if you want to take me just a second to find it.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.400
Oh, maybe maybe five seconds. Don't hold me literally to a second.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.840
Okay. I'll go ahead and go ahead and give you the permissions right now. Yes.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.760
All right. Let me find it done.

21:18.800 --> 21:23.680
I don't want to interrupt, Jim. So if you've got to, you know, if you've got a train of thought

21:23.680 --> 21:28.800
going, please just go and I wrote it down. I can ask again. Yeah. Too late.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.480
I think that's extraordinary to me because 94 doesn't even sound that low.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.560
That's going to drive a lot of people into the hospital.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.240
Exactly. No, that's, that's right.

21:50.080 --> 21:56.400
Holy man. That's that. This is not what I expected to get immediately.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.640
We can find it later. Don't worry. Okay. Yep. I've got I've got it here.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.120
All right. So I'm going to do a screen share quick.

22:03.120 --> 22:09.520
All right. Oh my gosh. Here we go. Scott says.

22:11.680 --> 22:16.000
Yeah. So I don't like to go off half cock. There it is. Oh my gosh.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.240
Baseliner ambulatory desaturation less than 94% should be prompt hospital admission.

22:22.240 --> 22:31.360
Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Yeah. So this was, this was, this is serious stuff.

22:31.360 --> 22:38.320
And what I, I've been sharing with people. I did a, I did a mono cast on it that the parallel

22:38.320 --> 22:46.720
system is a false prophet. Oh man. Do that is sir. I just, I can't say how important that is.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.800
That, that is really important. And I know you know how important it is. But again,

22:50.800 --> 22:54.400
you're farther down this road. That's huge. Okay. Go ahead, please.

22:54.960 --> 23:00.720
Sorry. Well, this parallel, this is the parallel system is designed to be a false prophet.

23:01.440 --> 23:05.520
And this is where, you know, I told you off camera that I'm putting together this series

23:05.520 --> 23:11.600
about the false prophet, the false prophet system. And you know, that's what I'm working on now. But

23:11.600 --> 23:17.920
anyway, now we got off on the tangent. So grace. Okay. So now God gave me, God puts me in this

23:17.920 --> 23:23.360
different hospital and you can't make this up. So now I thought I was going to die on October 16th.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.360
I talked with my right hand guy in the business. I talked with my daughter Jess.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.240
I thought I thought October 16th was going to be my last day. Well, now the next day I

23:34.240 --> 23:40.480
survived the night I was down into the 70 percentile and oxygen overnight. And the nurse

23:40.480 --> 23:46.240
came in the next day and she has a, I mean, you've seen these little pill cups. I'll just give it,

23:46.240 --> 23:50.160
you know, you know, they have this little cup like something like that and they have pills in it.

23:50.160 --> 23:55.440
So she says to me, I want to go through the pill regimen with you. So you know, I'm, I'm,

23:55.440 --> 24:00.320
of course, very skeptical of everything. My daughter just died three days earlier. And so I said,

24:00.320 --> 24:07.680
what do you have in there? And she said, I have a probiotic, a multivitamin, vitamin C, vitamin D

24:07.680 --> 24:14.720
and fish oil. I said, you're shitting me. You guys don't believe in that stuff. And she said,

24:14.720 --> 24:21.040
what we do here and her attitude was fantastic. So then, you know, we get talking and, you know,

24:21.040 --> 24:24.640
the day I'm starting to improve and, you know, they gave me a budessonite treatment.

24:26.160 --> 24:32.080
That's the, that's the inhalable thing, right? Yes, it was fantastic. Also, I mean, I, I started

24:32.080 --> 24:36.960
turning around. I was turned around in 24 hours. Well, now it's time. Okay, I'm going to be there

24:36.960 --> 24:41.600
for a few days and they've got all these leads on me. I said, yeah, I want to take a shower.

24:42.560 --> 24:46.480
And you'll love this. I want to take a shower. And I said, what do I do with all these leads?

24:47.040 --> 24:51.120
And she said, well, you can tear them off or I can tear them off. And I said, well, I'm kind

24:51.120 --> 24:54.640
of hairy. So I mean, if you wouldn't mind just ripping them off, you know, it's one of those

24:54.640 --> 24:58.640
things you don't want to tear them off. And so she starts doing that. And she said, you know,

24:59.360 --> 25:03.360
if you would have, if you would have called ahead, we have free waxing.

25:03.360 --> 25:10.560
And she would just, she would just joke. She was just jousting with me. That was her sense of

25:10.560 --> 25:17.760
humor. Yeah, I see. Wow. And it was, it was just, it was a hospital stay the way that you would

25:17.760 --> 25:26.640
envision it. Yes, I see. They cared about me. They listened to me. When I, you know, I had to,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.000
you know, now I realized I'm going to make it. They want to keep me longer. I said, listen,

25:30.080 --> 25:34.960
I got to check out, you know, we got to, my daughter died in, you know, so they worked with me to

25:34.960 --> 25:40.400
get me home earlier than what they wanted. Everything, just the way I didn't have to argue with them

25:40.400 --> 25:47.920
once. There was no arguments. In Grace's stay, you know, there, the argument started early on,

25:47.920 --> 25:52.960
where I started challenging things. So for example, so Grace's, you know, first

25:52.960 --> 25:58.880
folding in the hospital was October 7th. On October 9th, I started feeding Grace and the nurse came

25:58.880 --> 26:02.880
running in and said, you can't do that. I said, what's the reason? She said, well, her oxygen

26:02.880 --> 26:08.320
level is only at 85%. I said, well, I processed that. I didn't say anything right away. But I

26:08.320 --> 26:14.320
thought, okay, yeah, I mean, the oxygen is important, right? So then I put on, I had a pulse ox in the

26:14.320 --> 26:21.840
room. And because I had everything for me to get COVID in Grace's room. So I put the finger meter

26:21.840 --> 26:27.760
on Grace and I read 95%. So I called the nurse back in. And I said, is my finger meter accurate?

26:27.760 --> 26:33.520
She said, yes, it is. I said, well, why is my meter reading 95% and yours is reading 85%?

26:34.160 --> 26:37.920
And she said, well, because the leads get sweaty. I said, well, if you know that,

26:37.920 --> 26:43.680
why aren't you proactively changing out the leads? Given this is the primary tool you're using to

26:43.680 --> 26:49.280
manage my daughter's care. And then she shook her finger at me and said, you should just be

26:49.280 --> 26:54.960
thankful you caught this. So this adversarial relationship was like this in the hospital,

26:54.960 --> 27:00.480
ultimately, on the morning of October 10, I had demanded a meeting with the

27:02.400 --> 27:07.680
attending physician. But instead of meeting with me, he sent in the head nurse with an armed guard

27:07.680 --> 27:14.000
in it. And I was taken out by an armed guard the morning of October 10. Well, then as we go

27:14.000 --> 27:20.240
further into the state, now we hired an attorney to get my daughter Jessica in as a replacement

27:20.240 --> 27:27.040
advocate. My wife Cindy couldn't do it because she was really sick. So Jessica's now we had 47

27:27.040 --> 27:33.280
hours without advocacy during that 47 hours, they sedated Grace instead of taking care of her.

27:34.400 --> 27:41.680
So when it comes to Grace's last day, what happened is that we turned the page to her last day of the

27:41.680 --> 27:46.960
doctor called Cindy and I in the morning about little after 10 o'clock. We're talking to him

27:46.960 --> 27:52.160
on the phone and the purpose of his call was to follow up on a call he had with us the night before.

27:52.160 --> 27:57.920
And what he wanted to do was convince us to give the hospital a preauthorization for a ventilator.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.280
And I had already researched ventilators. I became wise to ventilators during Grace's

28:03.280 --> 28:11.440
hospital stay. So we already knew no ventilators. So we say no to the ventilator. This is the fifth

28:11.440 --> 28:17.680
request. So we said no. And yeah, my suspicion is he knew we were going to say no because of our

28:17.680 --> 28:24.000
prior history and they put plan B in place right away. So he switched gears as soon as we said no

28:24.000 --> 28:29.200
and said, well, Grace said such a good day yesterday. Let's work on nutrition. And let's get her out of

28:29.200 --> 28:35.120
bed so that she can be home in the next three or four days. Well, you know, getting her out of bed

28:35.600 --> 28:42.800
is a key thing because before he even got on the phone call with us, Jonathan, he had strapped

28:42.800 --> 28:49.200
Grace down to the bed and made her defecate in the bed. So he was lying. Then while we were on the

28:49.200 --> 28:55.280
phone call with him, he increased the dose of the sedation med presidex to the maximum allowable

28:55.280 --> 28:59.680
dose while he's telling us Grace said such a good day. Let's get her out of bed. All this positive

28:59.680 --> 29:05.280
stuff. Let's get up. He convinced us to do a feeding tube, but he maxed out the dose of the

29:05.280 --> 29:11.120
sedation med while we're on the phone and then simultaneous with hanging up the phone, he put

29:11.120 --> 29:18.560
an illegal do not resuscitate order on her chart. My suspicion is he thought the presidex was going

29:18.560 --> 29:25.840
to kill Grace because the 1048 max dose presidex 1056 that day eight minutes later, the DNR order.

29:25.920 --> 29:31.120
Well, then it didn't kill Grace. And what they ended up doing the short story is they combined,

29:31.120 --> 29:36.480
then they added Lorazepam and morphine to the mix, which that med combination is what you use

29:36.480 --> 29:41.760
to euthanize somebody in their last hour of life in hospice care. And they combined those meds in

29:41.760 --> 29:48.160
a 29 minute window. And after they gave Grace that combination, she was dead an hour and 13

29:48.160 --> 29:54.400
minutes later, an hour and 12 minutes later. And you know, when it came time to revive Grace,

29:54.400 --> 30:00.000
if you read the the morphine package insert, you would see that those meds are contraindicated.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.560
They're supposed to keep the reversal drug bedside and monitor the patient. Well, they had no intention

30:04.560 --> 30:10.560
of doing that. And so once they gave Grace morphine, no doctor or nurse step foot in the room. Jessica

30:10.560 --> 30:18.480
was in the room. She felt Grace get cold. The the 20 year ICU nurse said to Jess from outside the

30:18.480 --> 30:23.360
room, she wouldn't even come in the room. That's normal. Just cover with a blanket. And when Grace's

30:23.360 --> 30:30.320
number started to tank, she Jessica called Cindy and I at 718. They gave the final dose was given

30:30.320 --> 30:36.320
to Grace at 615 at 718. An hour and three minutes later, Jessica's seeing these numbers tank and

30:36.320 --> 30:41.280
she called us on a FaceTime call panicking. And she said, dad, Grace's numbers are dropping

30:41.280 --> 30:46.560
like crazy. I said, get the nurses in. But we're clueless. And she said, dad, I've been trying.

30:46.560 --> 30:50.960
They won't come in. So we started screaming, save our daughter. And this is when we learned

30:50.960 --> 30:57.280
she's DNR because from outside the room with a guard outside the room, they haul her back.

30:57.280 --> 31:03.280
She's DNR. And we hollered. She's not DNR. Save our daughter. And they refused. Nobody would come

31:03.280 --> 31:11.600
in the room. And we watched her die on that FaceTime call at 727 on October 13th. Even that, Jonathan,

31:12.320 --> 31:17.520
I thought, you know, strangely, I mean, now when I see it, it's so obvious. But I thought it was an

31:17.600 --> 31:24.000
accident. So after I got out of the hospital, a doctor that my wife and I know, she said, Scott,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.640
you better get the records because something, I think something nefarious happened. So I got

31:28.640 --> 31:34.880
the records and as God would have it, we had all the records to evaluate Grace's story four days

31:34.880 --> 31:40.000
later. So on November 4th, we had all the records. So the doctor and I sat down, we went through the

31:40.000 --> 31:46.880
records, we spent about 100 hours, we put everything together. And then I sent it to the hospital via

31:46.880 --> 31:53.280
patient relations on November 8th and requested a meeting with the CEO of the hospital and the

31:53.280 --> 31:58.720
doctor, figuring they would want to know what they did so that history doesn't repeat itself.

31:59.360 --> 32:04.000
On November 2nd, they sent a an email back said, we're not going to meet with you.

32:05.200 --> 32:11.760
And that started the process of waking up. Ultimately, I didn't conclude that Grace was murdered until

32:11.760 --> 32:17.840
April the following year. So April of 22, a pharmacist whistleblower came forward.

32:18.960 --> 32:25.360
We had done billboards and our billboards got national attention and she saw them via Gateway

32:25.360 --> 32:31.360
Pundit. And she called me and she said, I'm a nurse or I'm a pharmacist. And you know, what's

32:31.360 --> 32:37.200
happening here, Scott, is that she said, I'm thinking about quitting and becoming a whistleblower

32:37.200 --> 32:43.280
because what's going on is these med combinations, like they gave Grace, this is what they're doing

32:43.280 --> 32:49.600
all the time. But I won't sign off on them. She said, Scott, the process is the doctor orders the

32:49.600 --> 32:55.840
meds. The pharmacist has to sign off. Then because the meds are contraindicated and alarm has to be

32:55.840 --> 33:01.680
overridden. And in Grace's case, a 20 year ICU nurse is the one who gave her the meds. So that

33:01.680 --> 33:08.800
four step combination got me on that phone call with this pharmacist got me to realize, oh my gosh,

33:08.800 --> 33:15.840
Grace was murdered. And that's when I really got into it. Can I clarify this again? Are you saying

33:15.840 --> 33:20.960
because I used to be a pharmacy technician at a hospital in Chicago for a year I worked in the

33:20.960 --> 33:26.720
operating room, I used to put scrubs on, I used to carry bags of stuff that I loaded for the

33:26.800 --> 33:33.280
operating room back to the operating rooms, hand them off to anesthesiologists. Are you saying that

33:33.280 --> 33:38.240
in the computer system itself, there should have been a red flag that they had to actually manually

33:38.240 --> 33:45.840
tick over? That's what she told me. Yes. That the because the meds are contraindicated. So that's

33:45.840 --> 33:51.120
the day when I realized Grace was murdered. And you know, now I've, you know, I've been researching,

33:51.120 --> 33:58.080
you know, either, you know, the lawsuit research and podcasts, you know, you know, 75 to 90

33:58.080 --> 34:03.280
hours a week. Well, you're just to finish what she told me, she said, Scott, I won't sign these

34:03.280 --> 34:10.320
orders like they did on Grace. So what they do to get around me is they wait until my shift is over.

34:10.320 --> 34:16.240
And the next pharmacist who comes on, they don't have the same conscience as I do. So they will

34:16.240 --> 34:23.360
sign sign the order. And so any she ended up leaving and became a whistleblower. After that

34:23.360 --> 34:28.480
conversation that, you know, I encourage her just, you know, you got to speak out. And the only way

34:28.480 --> 34:33.600
you you you got to you can't just keep this close to the vast, you got to tell the world what's going

34:33.600 --> 34:41.040
on. And she she's gotten out and there's been she's been speaking out and a lot lower level,

34:41.040 --> 34:45.280
but I mean, she's still speaking out, which is what I think doctors and nurses should be doing.

34:45.280 --> 34:51.200
The ones that are awake. Do you have a list anywhere of some of these

34:51.200 --> 34:56.800
combinations that you guys have identified that are that are useful in this manner in an

34:56.800 --> 35:03.120
awful way to say it? Well, the one I'm going to do another screen share with you, this will

35:03.120 --> 35:08.000
really blow your mind. Sure. But the you know, the med combination with Grace was Precidex,

35:08.000 --> 35:12.560
Lorazepam and morphine. The other med combination is

35:14.880 --> 35:21.280
Medazzalam, Medazzalam, fentanyl and Verconium bromide. And I'm going to show you something

35:21.280 --> 35:25.440
that's way worse than what I showed you with FLCCC. What was the last one?

35:27.120 --> 35:31.760
You said fentanyl, fentanyl, fentanyl, fentanyl, but Dazzalam and Verconium bromide.

35:32.560 --> 35:42.000
So give me just a moment. Sure. Sure, please. You got all the time in the universe, my friend.

35:43.920 --> 35:48.080
Except the people are being killed on a daily basis. So we should try and right. Well,

35:48.080 --> 35:51.120
that's why, you know, that's why we keep speaking all of this because.

35:51.120 --> 35:56.240
Wow.

35:59.440 --> 36:05.280
It's crazy because Medazzalam is a very well used, well known, they know what that stuff does.

36:05.280 --> 36:11.760
It's not any, it's not any surprise. All right, so I'm going to screen share here. Go ahead.

36:11.920 --> 36:25.120
Okay. So what, what's happening here? I'm going to show you first. This is from,

36:25.840 --> 36:34.480
so this is a Down syndrome lady in Connecticut. Her mom reached out to me and she was showing me

36:35.520 --> 36:39.920
this is her medical record. All right. So you see, they were giving, they gave her

36:39.920 --> 36:47.520
Medazzalam, fentanyl, and Verconium bromide. You see these, they're, they're listed and, you know,

36:47.520 --> 36:54.160
what's, what's strange is not that they gave her these. It's just what, what's the impetus behind

36:54.160 --> 37:02.400
it? I want to show you one other thing here if it's on here. Yes. Okay. So you see this, this $22,000

37:02.400 --> 37:09.040
dose for taxa, listen, man, that's a monoclonal antibody, right? For what? No, it's not. It's a,

37:09.040 --> 37:14.640
it's a pathway drug that's supposed to open up pathways. It's not a monoclonal antibody. And

37:15.360 --> 37:21.040
what? I bet it is. I bet it is. Hold on. Let me think it is. Okay. You would know better than me.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.760
Go ahead. That last ending there, MAB is usually a monoclonal antibody. There's no reason why they

37:25.760 --> 37:29.920
couldn't use an antibody to do what you just described. It could easily be an activator of

37:29.920 --> 37:36.640
receptors or anything like that. Yeah. So this is supposed to open up, you know, your pathways

37:36.720 --> 37:42.720
to prevent a cytokine storm. You know, we learned that this, that really isn't designed. It only

37:42.720 --> 37:46.960
opens up one pathway in our research. And the reason I went into that research is because

37:47.680 --> 37:54.560
the COVID expert on the floor was really pushing this taxa, listen, MAB. And I researched taxa,

37:54.560 --> 37:59.840
listen, MAB in Grace's room. And I saw the study showed from the New England Journal of Medicine

37:59.840 --> 38:05.760
that the placebo group did better than the drug group. Anyway, it's a monoclonal antibody.

38:06.640 --> 38:13.360
It is. It's something that they give to severely people with a lot of bad

38:13.360 --> 38:20.480
rheumatoid arthritis, apparently. Well, what's interesting about it as I dug into the public health

38:20.480 --> 38:28.320
emergency, you know, which facilitated the FDA putting together emergency use authorization drugs.

38:29.120 --> 38:37.040
This was one of the approved drugs. Really? Wow. So then I connected the dots as to why they

38:37.040 --> 38:42.000
were trying to put pressure on me to give this drug to Grace when I saw this lady's records,

38:42.000 --> 38:46.640
because one, you know, they gave her this one dose on November 19 and it was $22,000.

38:49.440 --> 38:54.960
Oh, yeah, here it says right here. It's also used to treat coronavirus disease and hospitalized

38:55.040 --> 38:59.280
patients who are receiving systemic cortical steroids and requiring supplemental oxygen

38:59.280 --> 39:07.040
mechanical ventilation. But they don't really explain why. I guess it decreases this cytokine

39:07.040 --> 39:12.320
release syndrome. I don't know. That sounds scary to me. That was the theory that they were trying

39:12.320 --> 39:17.760
to tell me. But it's, it's, you know, my research showed that the motivation was the financial

39:17.760 --> 39:23.280
motivation. All right. So now what I have on the screen, you'll see, I want to stop you there

39:23.280 --> 39:28.800
just because I think you should hear this. If you're not aware, the intellectual property

39:28.800 --> 39:33.040
space of monoclonal antibodies changed at the start of the pandemic because of something that

39:33.040 --> 39:40.480
the Supreme Court ruled on. And so basically all the value that was thought to be held by

39:40.480 --> 39:47.520
monoclonal antibody patents basically vanished because they, the Supreme Court acknowledged that

39:47.520 --> 39:54.000
monoclonal antibody patents are based on biology that's not really as, as well developed as they

39:54.000 --> 39:58.720
claimed. And there's this cookie cutter thing that was happening for the last 10 years where they

39:58.720 --> 40:03.600
were just writing the patents all the same and saying that they had a new product. And so it

40:03.600 --> 40:08.960
could very easily be that they were sneaking this under the, under the gun where they're still

40:09.520 --> 40:13.520
charging full price for something that they knew at the end of the pandemic. By the time it was

40:13.520 --> 40:18.560
over, they wouldn't be able to charge a dime for it. It's extraordinary, dude. Wow.

40:18.560 --> 40:27.280
Makes total sense to me. Wow. Well, this one. So what happened here is this lady's mom

40:28.000 --> 40:34.240
glued me in on this. She said, Scott, there was a push by a group of doctors to get

40:35.040 --> 40:42.080
and I'll show you the letter here. So I cut the letter down so it can be all on one screen. So

40:42.160 --> 40:47.600
you see these doctors, they wrote a letter to, there's X number of states, I don't remember,

40:47.600 --> 40:57.520
13 states that end life on death row by lethal injections. So these doctors wrote this letter

40:57.520 --> 41:05.040
to the states headed by Joel Zivat. And it says your states are currently holding for use in lethal

41:05.040 --> 41:14.640
injection execution. We need these drugs. We desperately need these drugs to treat COVID-19.

41:14.640 --> 41:21.440
All right. So what's interesting is so this letter was written April 6th of 2020. That is

41:22.640 --> 41:27.760
I found a news report. I was shocked because I thought, well, how come this wasn't reported?

41:27.840 --> 41:37.520
So this lady, Rebecca Pryor had done, it actually went on, she would have this on short television

41:37.520 --> 41:43.680
blurb. But you can see that she reported on this letter that these doctors wrote on April 14th

41:43.680 --> 41:51.120
of 2020, that they're asking the states that allow the death penalty to donate certain lethal

41:51.120 --> 41:58.560
injection drugs because they need them for COVID. I can't even believe it. I mean,

41:58.560 --> 42:06.320
I'm just, I'm seeing it, but I'm not, I just, it's hard to really, people didn't see this,

42:06.320 --> 42:14.400
didn't hear it. Well, I mean, what was the anything that's truth doesn't ever get out into the mainstream,

42:14.400 --> 42:20.560
right? So I mean, you'd have to really dig for this stuff. I looked this up the other day for

42:20.560 --> 42:26.000
somebody else and her story is still live on the link that I have, but I screenshot it because I

42:26.000 --> 42:32.960
wanted it to so I could use it permanently. Interestingly, this guy Joel Zivet, how he figured out

42:33.600 --> 42:42.080
this med combination for killing is he went and observed somebody dying by lethal injection.

42:42.080 --> 42:47.440
And you see the title, he wrote an article in 2014, he says, the white coat of veil for state

42:47.440 --> 42:53.120
killing. And this was, so I mean, that could be a COVID article, right? But he wrote this article

42:53.120 --> 43:00.880
because he was so offended by how the the states were killing people with these drugs that he just

43:00.880 --> 43:07.600
thought that this was wrong. And then he ends up, he ends up being the lead author on this letter

43:08.240 --> 43:14.400
requesting the lethal injection drugs to be used for treating COVID. I mean, this is insane stuff.

43:15.360 --> 43:21.360
I mean, I don't know how to out a process that any other way that in 2014, he was already acting

43:21.360 --> 43:29.120
on behalf of the state somehow to put up some kind of fake opposition to the killing of people. I mean,

43:30.880 --> 43:35.840
Well, it makes total sense in, you know, in how you and I start viewing the world,

43:35.840 --> 43:39.840
which, you know, I'd certainly encourage other people to view the world that way. And, you know,

43:40.240 --> 43:43.760
I haven't had a couple of things that were on my mind, you know, knowing that you're going to have

43:43.760 --> 43:49.600
me on and how you and I, we think differently, right? We think differently than the average bear,

43:49.600 --> 43:54.240
which, you know, it's it's a blessing and a curse, but I happen to think it's a blessing because you

43:54.240 --> 43:59.200
can see things a different way. It's a curse when you watch movies because you can't watch a movie

43:59.200 --> 44:04.880
and enjoy it anymore, right? But anyway, you know, so now, you know, I look at COVID, the whole

44:04.880 --> 44:14.880
scyop of COVID, you know, I think that this whole thing is designed, especially now that I see it.

44:15.440 --> 44:21.920
Actually, let me just share with you first something that will maybe set this conversation up better.

44:21.920 --> 44:29.360
So, I mean, fifth generation warfare is propaganda. Okay, so I just started, you know, when I'm

44:29.360 --> 44:36.720
working on this bigger false profit thing, and so I've been processing this further and I call

44:36.720 --> 44:39.840
and now I'm calling this I don't I haven't heard anybody call it yet. So you're going to hear

44:39.840 --> 44:47.120
for the first thing, thick generation warfare. So what I'm calling sixth generation warfare is

44:47.120 --> 44:56.080
things like it. So here's the hypothetical question. Was the power grid set up? Do they

44:56.160 --> 45:01.840
realize? Oh my gosh, we can we can shut down people's power. Let's use this to accomplish a goal.

45:01.840 --> 45:08.160
Or did they set up the power grid with this goal in mind? Which one? Which one came first,

45:08.160 --> 45:13.600
the chicken and egg? So I'm, you know, so that would apply to not just the power grid, but the,

45:13.600 --> 45:20.240
you know, the water supply, the internet was all of this stuff set up with the idea that that's how

45:20.240 --> 45:25.280
they're going to control us. Or did they realize after it's set up, they can control us with it?

45:25.280 --> 45:30.000
Well, I think it was set up with the idea of controlling us all these things.

45:31.760 --> 45:37.760
I'm processing and I love it. And I want to I want to this this this idea.

45:38.960 --> 45:42.560
Example came to my head and I wonder if you think it might be connected to this and I'm sure you're

45:42.560 --> 45:50.960
going to say yes. So I accidentally got trapped in Texas a couple years ago when they had this

45:50.960 --> 45:57.920
freak storm and they lost power and all these places. Well, interestingly enough, in the context

45:57.920 --> 46:01.760
of who I was hanging out with and I won't give you details because I don't want to out anybody

46:01.760 --> 46:08.160
that doesn't like me. In the context of the people that I was hanging out with, there was one person

46:08.160 --> 46:14.400
that had cell phone coverage all the time. And the reason why is because there is a network of

46:15.360 --> 46:21.920
important people that have their cell phone tower access isn't cut off during an emergency.

46:21.920 --> 46:29.600
And this dedicated network is accessible by it would make sense police and and EMS and fire and

46:29.600 --> 46:35.760
this kind of thing. But there are also business people and members of corporations and and that

46:35.760 --> 46:42.800
are also included in this network. It's a it's a in my mind when this happened. And I was like,

46:42.800 --> 46:46.880
how are you still calling? Well, because I got this special phone or I have this special,

46:46.880 --> 46:53.200
it was a special SIM card. I was like, so wait a minute, like that means that there are whole

46:53.200 --> 46:58.720
people that think that there is a crisis going on, that nobody has cell phone when in reality,

46:58.720 --> 47:06.160
there are people who are above it. Isn't that true then? And she said, yes. So if it can happen on

47:06.160 --> 47:12.560
a very local scale in Texas, imagine what could be done with a network shutdown in America where

47:12.560 --> 47:19.120
certain people still had full access. Yeah, it's it's extraordinary proposition. And it's not a,

47:19.760 --> 47:26.240
I don't think it's a conspiracy theory at all, even if you disguised it as redundancy or disguised

47:26.240 --> 47:32.160
it as some kind of, you know, national security thing where we have nodes and these nodes are

47:32.160 --> 47:38.960
connected in a certain way. Okay, anyway, I interrupted you, go ahead, go. No, I think that's I think

47:38.960 --> 47:45.920
that's right on. So when you look at, so you know, you and I would agree that COVID by itself is a

47:45.920 --> 47:53.200
SIAP. And yet the country is still focused on everything is either there's two things they're

47:53.200 --> 48:00.240
focused on, right? COVID COVID COVID and Trump Trump Trump. All right, so those two things have,

48:00.880 --> 48:08.400
you know, probably 99% of the people off track as to what's really going on. So was COVID

48:09.520 --> 48:15.760
set up specifically, when you start, I mean, these people who have bought into COVID, I mean,

48:15.760 --> 48:22.480
they are so locked into it, you know, the, you know, they had to, you know, it wasn't accident,

48:22.480 --> 48:27.520
you know, that's the real theme that they want to promote, that it was an accident. And you know,

48:27.520 --> 48:36.800
the layers of deception here. But if COVID was really done to take our eyes off of what they're

48:36.800 --> 48:44.640
really doing, it makes total sense. You know, it's it's the esoteric magician. So exoterically,

48:44.640 --> 48:50.320
so exoterically, what we can all see is we see, okay, something happened with COVID,

48:50.320 --> 48:57.680
we can say, okay, that was a SIAP. But what's really going on? What is what is really the goal? And

48:59.600 --> 49:06.000
so for example, if I look at what when you start looking at all the articles, like I sent you one

49:06.000 --> 49:13.040
from Steve Kersch. So I see that and I see, okay, well, this is a setup. You know, why do I say

49:13.040 --> 49:20.160
it's a setup? Because it's still talking about, you know, the uniqueness of the COVID vaccine

49:20.160 --> 49:27.920
versus all vaccines, you know, in multiple layers in that situation. But ultimately, it frames it

49:27.920 --> 49:35.520
that if this is about COVID, now it's about a mistake. And their agenda is so big. I watched

49:35.520 --> 49:39.840
you and I talked about this on the phone when we first met, I told you I watched the documentary

49:39.840 --> 49:45.920
shot dead. And that's about vaccine deaths. And I thought it was well done. And we just got done,

49:45.920 --> 49:51.040
my wife and I get done, I said, Pfizer is going to be a sacrifice. And so that's what I saw through

49:51.040 --> 49:55.920
that. So you know, how would they bring down somebody as big as Pfizer? Well, it would be on

49:55.920 --> 50:01.440
purpose. Why? Because you know, people are waking up that we can't have any faith in our government.

50:01.520 --> 50:06.160
Well, we can't have that. So if our government brings down Pfizer, look, I mean, they get a

50:06.160 --> 50:10.560
gold star again, where they're back in our good graces, people have short term memory. They don't

50:10.560 --> 50:17.760
realize this is a whole scheme. Anyway, no, and you know, there are a couple things that you's

50:17.760 --> 50:23.920
mentioned that I just recently picked up on from another thread. And so I want to compliment you

50:23.920 --> 50:31.600
on that. The one that you said was, it's like a, it's like a magician stage trick. And one of

50:31.600 --> 50:36.800
the things that we are very, I think I've only become recently aware of is that by sending us home

50:37.520 --> 50:43.840
and putting us behind our screens, we have essentially been sat down in the audience of a

50:43.840 --> 50:50.720
performance where what we see in here is highly controlled and even the angle that we see it from

50:50.800 --> 50:55.520
is highly controlled. We can just change our position in the in the world, we would be able

50:55.520 --> 51:00.480
to see it. But because they started and put us in front of this screen, they were able to perform

51:00.480 --> 51:04.960
a magician's trick where where we think we're paying attention to the things that we're supposed

51:04.960 --> 51:10.160
to be paying attention to and somehow we're still fooled. And so your reference to that particular

51:10.880 --> 51:15.840
sort of set of tricks is really important because it's a little bit more than propaganda. We were

51:15.840 --> 51:23.120
set up to have this, this trick played on us. And so it's, it's a little, I think I always say,

51:24.080 --> 51:29.840
at least I'm drawn back to saying that we've got to have a lot of sympathy and, and, and empathy

51:29.840 --> 51:37.200
for the people that are still trapped simply because the trap is so diabolical. I mean, it's a, it's a,

51:38.160 --> 51:47.840
it's a, it's a wonderful, it's a wonderfully deadly sort of, I mean, I don't know how to express it

51:47.840 --> 51:55.040
adequately enough to say how even when you get to where I am, you still have someone like Scott to

51:55.040 --> 52:00.000
catch up to and Scott is still peeling back the layers himself. Oh my gosh. Yeah, I don't, I don't

52:00.000 --> 52:06.960
know that I have 20% of it. But yeah, I can summarize this idea. I think in there's a, a few other

52:07.040 --> 52:11.920
people who have, who have helped me, you know, they, they're ahead of me that I've learned from,

52:11.920 --> 52:17.360
which is really, really great. And I don't know who the one that, so this, this phrase I'm going

52:17.360 --> 52:21.440
to tell you next is from somebody else. I can't tell you who right now because I don't remember.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.840
But they laid this out. I thought it was the best way to say it because there is a, there is a

52:29.840 --> 52:40.400
movement right now that is maybe the, so I, I've looked at the, the top three sciops that I've

52:40.400 --> 52:50.560
been involved in. So I look at number three is JFK is murder. Number two is COVID and number one

52:50.560 --> 52:59.200
is the American dream. So the American dream sciop is really based on the idea that we can

52:59.200 --> 53:05.280
become our own gods. You know, weed knowledge is power. And you know, so that becomes this

53:05.280 --> 53:12.080
thing. And you know, we, we are chasing this dream, you know, 2.1 kids, 1.7 dogs, no cats.

53:13.440 --> 53:18.320
You know, retire when you're 50 and drink beer on the front porch. That whole sciop that we've

53:18.320 --> 53:23.760
bought into our, our government's there to protect us. You know, all these things, you know, it's,

53:23.760 --> 53:31.760
it's really all a lie. But take a step back. When you start seeing, you know, the article that,

53:32.800 --> 53:38.400
that I read this a couple of months ago, it's called Stop World Control. And it's from a group

53:38.400 --> 53:43.600
called Stop World Control. And that was happened to be the title of the article also. Anyway,

53:43.600 --> 53:48.640
that's what motivated me to do the false prophet podcast that I'm working on now,

53:48.640 --> 53:53.760
the monocast, I should say, it's going to be a three part series introduction, then a body

53:53.760 --> 54:03.200
and a conclusion. Anyway, the, the introduction. So in this article, it said that Tucker Carlson,

54:03.200 --> 54:13.600
Elon Musk, and Joe Rogan all brought Alex Jones on their program to share red pills with the world,

54:13.600 --> 54:18.960
that if we can just wake up the world as to what's going on, let's, let's pull back the curtain,

54:18.960 --> 54:25.760
let's show the world what's going on, we can all resist this. Okay, as soon as I saw that,

54:25.760 --> 54:33.040
I've been working on the idea of Revelation 13, that Satan's two halves, he's got an evil half,

54:34.000 --> 54:38.560
the Antichrist system and a less evil half, the false prophet system, they're both laid out in

54:38.560 --> 54:43.600
Revelation 13, it's a great chapter, you can see it both with your eyes, you see, oh my gosh,

54:43.600 --> 54:49.600
Satan's dualistic nature, he gives us the illusion of choice with this dualistic nature. And then

54:49.600 --> 54:55.760
I heard this phrase. And so the build up to this is all to this phrase. And so the, the

54:56.560 --> 55:07.040
satanic plan to take down the cabal, or excuse me, the plan to take down the satanic cabal

55:07.680 --> 55:13.920
was written by the cabal. Have you heard that before, John? Only from you.

55:14.720 --> 55:22.880
Okay. Well, it's not, I didn't come up with it, but it makes total sense, right? The plan to take

55:22.880 --> 55:29.440
down the satanic cabal, everybody would agree that the cabal is satanic, right? That's easy to prove.

55:30.320 --> 55:35.840
But the plan to take it down was written by the cabal itself. That's, that's Satan's dualistic

55:35.840 --> 55:42.080
nature. He has that much power. God said, Jesus said, Satan is the prince of this world.

55:43.840 --> 55:50.240
And it's not a joke. I mean, Satan offered the world to Jesus. So Jesus didn't deny that Satan

55:50.240 --> 55:55.120
has control of the world. He's got control of it all. That's how elaborate the scheme is.

55:58.640 --> 56:04.960
So this presidential election, just to drill it down to the, you know, now, you know, the last two

56:04.960 --> 56:11.120
elections I voted for Trump. And you know, I didn't think Trump was some great savior,

56:11.120 --> 56:16.400
but I just thought, you know, we surely can't have Clinton in. So I voted for Trump as an

56:16.400 --> 56:21.280
anti-Clinton vote. And then all of a sudden by Biden, yeah, of course, we got him. You know,

56:21.280 --> 56:27.520
so I voted for Trump twice. Now I see Trump is in on it. And I will not vote in this election,

56:27.520 --> 56:33.920
because I see it as the, you know, so you look at COVID as a tool to get our focus off

56:35.040 --> 56:38.880
what's really happening. And so is the election cycle in the United States.

56:38.880 --> 56:52.640
It's all to get us. It's the magician. I'm not going to participate in that system anymore, period.

56:55.200 --> 56:59.440
I don't, I'm just still pondering it because I don't, I don't, I don't,

56:59.440 --> 57:04.320
I don't have a good argument for that. Well, they've got us convinced through the American

57:04.320 --> 57:08.960
dream that it's our civic duty to vote. And if you don't vote, you don't have a voice and all,

57:08.960 --> 57:12.240
it's all a bunch of crap. They're all in on it. Yeah.

57:13.920 --> 57:20.400
Look at the, you and I talked about this before, also when we talked the movie Sound of Freedom,

57:20.400 --> 57:25.280
you know, everybody's cheering. Now this is a great movie. You know, it's exposing child trafficking.

57:25.280 --> 57:31.040
Well, the reality is it's the agenda is substantially deeper than child trafficking,

57:31.040 --> 57:39.360
because they didn't expose the trafficking of organs. They didn't expose the sacrificing

57:39.360 --> 57:46.480
of child children for a satanic worship. None of that. Okay. And the close of the film, I thought

57:46.480 --> 57:52.160
the film was well done. But the close of the film was the hook. And the hook was they had,

57:52.160 --> 57:58.080
they had the individual that the film was based on. They showed his testimony in front of Congress

57:58.080 --> 58:02.960
in that Congress, we're going to be patting legislation, we're going to crack down on this.

58:02.960 --> 58:13.360
Well, my gosh, Congress is in on it. You know, so this is all, you know, this, this, you know,

58:13.360 --> 58:19.440
this Truman show idea that we're participating in, you know, it's, it's called the matrix. And

58:19.440 --> 58:25.120
I think that's a good term for it. But what we've got to get, we got to get out of that game.

58:25.680 --> 58:32.560
And the only way to get out of it is to see this as a spiritual agenda and COVID done in a spiritual

58:32.560 --> 58:38.080
agenda, what, you know, when you start looking at things through the lens of what does God think

58:38.080 --> 58:45.280
of all of this? That's the only way to get out of the game is to stop participating. I mean,

58:45.280 --> 58:54.960
God's command to us is even though that you're in the world, don't be of the world. So the world

58:54.960 --> 58:58.880
is the matrix. Don't be in that, you know, that you don't have to participate.

59:01.600 --> 59:08.480
And, you know, ultimately, I see, you know, we've had God's shown his judgment in history.

59:09.200 --> 59:16.480
And I think he's judging again right now. And he's begging us through COVID as a wake up call,

59:16.480 --> 59:22.640
you know, God, of course, allowed nothing happens without God's authority. And so did was God aware

59:22.720 --> 59:29.600
of COVID? Well, of course, did God allow COVID? Of course. So he's totally aware of it. So what,

59:29.600 --> 59:35.680
what I see it through that lens and I think it's a COVID was a call to repentance. You know, this whole

59:35.680 --> 59:43.520
business that, you know, the false prophet side, I would say the biggest group involved with the

59:43.520 --> 59:47.520
false prophet side, you'll hear them say the great awakening, we're going to have a great

59:47.520 --> 59:53.280
awakening. And, you know, so they think that by waking the world up through what's behind the

59:53.280 --> 59:58.800
curtain, you know, we're, we're going to solve it. But it's just the other side of the satanic

59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.400
coin because it does that wake up doesn't rely on God.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.760
I don't know what to say. I mean, thank you for coming on my show and saying this stuff that I

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:26.560
probably really need to hear. Well, I mean, it's, I'm not, I am no genius. You know, God has given

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:34.160
me this stuff. And how it started, Jonathan was, you know, Vera, I mean, you know, Vera,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.360
she's a friend of both of ours. Well, she really got me started on this because when I was studying

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:47.040
the Holocaust, I started studying the Holocaust in July of 22. And that's when I was turned on to

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.720
this term Hegelian dialectic, which I had never heard before. So I started digging into that and

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:01.280
then God showed me, don't use grace's case to expose evil. Because that fits into Satan's playbook.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:08.080
He has to have the evil exposed. Okay, why? So you think, well, that's crazy. Well, no, it's not. If

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:17.520
you look at this esoterically, it's masterful, the Hegelian dialectic play. So you have a problem

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:26.400
reaction solution problem evil is exposed reaction chaos solution false profit order out of chaos.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:35.920
So he has to have the evil exposed in order to play the other side of the coin. And so that's why,

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.120
you know, I want people to see this as a spiritual agenda. What can we do then once you realize it's

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:48.080
a spiritual agenda is you can repent. And then, you know, we have an obligation once you repent,

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.240
you know, did your bonhopper. I think he showed the obligation fantastically. And you know, his

01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:01.760
famous words were to not speak as to speak and to not act as to act. And so we all can take action

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.880
once we repent. I mean, you see what my action is. I mean, I'm, I'm researching lawsuit.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.280
Yeah, I'm outspoken. Yeah, I just want to, I'll get on any program somebody invites me to.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.720
But I mean, you got to get there through,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.120
you know, two actions look the same, but the heart is different. You got to get there through

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:32.480
repentance. You know, in my specific case, I mean, I had to, you know, my, my fear is what caused my

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.440
daughter's death. You know, that's independent of what the doctors did. Okay, so it's two different

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.320
things. They have to be held to account. But I mean, first, I had to be held to account. And

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.840
if I would not have had the fear, grace would be alive today. Well, then, you know, you start

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:57.360
looking at, oh my gosh, how much have I participated in this matrix idea? You know, way too much. You

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.440
know, those are, you know, the American dream. I mean, I was, I chased the American dream most

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:09.200
of my life. I mean, I wasted tons of hours chasing money instead of what I should have been chasing.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.800
I wasted 20 years of my life chasing grants and and

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:24.000
crazy ideas, not that I wasn't pursuing it for good cause or good reason, but I got trapped in a

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.200
wrap rate, wrap race of my own two and, you know, I don't know, it's just a very, it's a very,

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.040
this is what I do a lot and I didn't realize to see it the way that you're saying it. But

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.400
I've been, I've been apologizing a lot on my stream lately for how long I bought into this

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.560
and how long I was talking about a lab leak and stuff, which created that fear and spread that

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:55.520
idea around and got a lot of people on board, even if they only saw me once. And so I do have a

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:01.200
lot to be ashamed of and a lot to repent for. And it's a, it's an ongoing thing that I'm wrestling

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:07.200
with. And I don't want this to be about me, but you really have made me have a moment here. And

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.280
it's a very humbling moment to to have over and over again through this whole thing for years now.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:23.200
And it still doesn't stop. Well, I think that's fantastic. I mean, I don't think it's meant to stop.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.440
I mean, God gives us, you know, I read a book one time you'll appreciate this because

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:40.400
you know, from God's way of letting us know when we sin, what's the, what's the reward for repenting

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:47.680
for sin? He exposes another one to us. So it's, it's an ongoing process. You know, what I see.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:55.600
Yeah, I was originally saw your work on, you know, the Scooby-Doo, how, you know, these layers,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.840
this was, oh my gosh, this was going on two years ago, I think I thought, wow, this guy is

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.840
brilliant. And I just enjoyed that, that thought process. And now as I expand it out of COVID and

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.760
I start seeing, oh my gosh, I mean, this, this whole, I, you know, I'm not a, I'm not a biologist

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.440
or a chemist or, you know, I don't have any qualifications. But I wonder, you know, when I start seeing

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:25.600
people proposing that there's never been a virus. And I think, I think that's true. I don't know,

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:33.120
I have any basis, you know, but it makes total sense. Because what did they do with every virus?

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:40.240
They have a vaccine that's related to the virus. And you know, when you see no vaccine has ever

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:46.800
been tested. And then in 1986, we have Ronald Reagan, who, you know, everybody's duped by Ronald

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.240
Reagan signing. But then he signs the worst legislation you could ever have. Well, it makes

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:58.400
total sense. They have to have a bogeyman. So these viruses are the bogeyman. So then they can,

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:07.680
they can vaccinate us. I, I found a clip from 1936 that was the doctor said he's never seen

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.880
anybody. So this was back when I would think the majority of people didn't have any vaccinations.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:22.560
But he said, I never had a patient have cancer who was unvaccinated. And now my wife just sent me

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:30.240
right before you, you and I got on, she just sent me a, which was predictable. Now they have a vaccine

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:38.960
for cancer. Yeah, because this vaccine agenda is, I mean, it's not the whole agenda, but it's a big

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:46.080
piece of the agenda. And they have to create a bogeyman. So anyway, I don't know, I mean,

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:53.600
I'm having a real, it's just to really been such a privilege to discuss this with you, because I

01:06:53.600 --> 01:07:00.720
do think you twice now in two weeks, you really challenged me to, to think a little further on this

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:07.280
and see the the spiritual side of it. And it's, you know, I guess I've been kind of hiding behind

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:13.840
the fact that, that for me, the, the biology is enough to convince me that they're lying. But

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.280
maybe I've even been a little bit hiding behind the fact that this is deeper than that, that the

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:26.400
biology is just the very beginning of how, yeah, I don't know, I guess, for me, I guess the best

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.280
way to just say it succinctly for me is that biology is the way that I came to appreciate God

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.640
as manifest instead of something that was in a book or that people talked about. And I felt like

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.160
my pursuit of biology for my life, even from when I was a kid was trying to appreciate exactly how

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:51.600
amazing what we've been given is and being able to see the evidence of God in the yard was something

01:07:51.600 --> 01:08:00.400
that I guess my grandma and I could see already when I was a kid. And I don't know, I just, I feel

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:07.200
like there's a reason why our paths crossed right now and and the message that you have and the

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:14.720
the challenge that you can present to me as a as a fellow follower of Christ is something very

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.880
impressive. I'm really moved by the fact that you joined me today. I didn't expect to be this way.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:28.720
And I, again, I just, I can't tell my viewers enough how it's important to know who Scott is,

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.280
what Scott's story is, what Grace's story is, and how it is a just a tiny, tiny example

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:43.040
of like a window, like a little tiny people in a door that you can look through and start to get

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.760
a idea of what has been kept from us as we've been put inside of our house. It's just a little

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:56.000
tiny people of what you can see through Scott is so important. And I knew that when I met him and

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.760
I know it even better now. Is there something still that we need to cover yet? Or is this a

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.720
good place to kind of wrap it? And you can come on as many times as you want. I think it's a great

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.360
place to end. When is your when do you know when your three part thing is going to be done?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.560
Or I'm going to record the first part next week on Monday. And then I've got two speaking

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.320
engagements next week that I'm going to be out of town for for five days. So then,

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.200
you know, I've got to get the balance scheduled yet. So I just scheduled with the producer,

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.800
the introduction to it. So I don't, you know, I don't know exactly what to call it yet,

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.800
you know, if it's going to be the false profit agenda or the matrix revealed.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:47.440
Our amazing grace dot net, right? Yes. Our amazing grace dot net is the,

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:54.480
is the website. Please do all you can to share Scott's work, share this stream, share my

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.000
appearance on his stream last time. It seems to have hit some some good chords with people. So

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.920
maybe that's another good one to share. Scott, again, thank you so much for being on my show and

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:14.080
sharing your story and Grace's story with us and your your insight into where we need to be.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:21.200
I just, yeah, I'm so happy that there's somebody like you out there and I hope I hope we can stay

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.040
in touch. Well, I plan on staying in touch. You've become, you know, very quickly, you've become

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.760
a friend and it's amazing to me. I mean, I just, you know, when we first talked on the phone a few

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.280
weeks ago, I thought, wow, this guy gets it. You know, it's so hard to have conversations like that,

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.920
but I really appreciate you very much. So thanks for having me. You're very welcome, Scott. I'll see you

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.160
again soon. All right, bye bye.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:52.400
You're gonna move my mouse up here. See you later, Scott. Thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:59.440
that was, well, what do you want me to say? I needed that. I needed to meet Scott. I don't

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:06.160
know why it happened now, but it did. And it is humbling like getting a boulder landed on your head

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:14.960
when somebody shows you your faith on a new angle. And I think you've all been very aware of how

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:24.960
much I tried to let the biology be the forward facing part of this. But at the heart of this show

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:33.120
is a little kid, biologist, altar boy, recovering Catholic, whatever you want to call me. And you

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:39.760
can't get the God out of a kid anymore. And so the best way for me to have always processed this

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.320
is prayer. And I don't always say that on my stream, but Scott will bring it out in you

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:52.400
because you can see it in him. Thank you very much for joining me. I don't think I'll be on later

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.040
tonight, but I will be on tomorrow. Thanks very much. I'll see you again soon.
