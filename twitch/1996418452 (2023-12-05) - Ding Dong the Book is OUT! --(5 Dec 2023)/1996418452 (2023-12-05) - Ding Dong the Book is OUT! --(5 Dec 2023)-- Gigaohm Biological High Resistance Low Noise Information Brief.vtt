00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
And to everybody in the universe who's trying to set their clock by Gigaohm Biological,

00:10.520 --> 00:15.000
I will not apologize, but I empathize with your frustration.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.280
I will not apologize, but I do empathize with your frustration.

00:19.280 --> 00:24.920
If I could get a sound check from Pamela, please, that would be very wonderful.

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
How are you today?

00:25.920 --> 00:28.120
I hope you're doing well.

00:28.120 --> 00:46.680
Can I get a sound check from anybody there?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.240
Did anybody see that come up?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.240
I'll come up one more time.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.240
Did anybody...

00:51.240 --> 00:52.240
We're good.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
Sounds good.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.240
Okay.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.240
I'm going to go with it.

00:57.240 --> 01:04.240
Then, thank you.

01:04.240 --> 01:23.240
You scheduled for 60 minutes next.

01:23.240 --> 01:30.120
It's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

01:30.120 --> 01:35.120
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.120
It's embarrassing.

01:40.120 --> 01:49.040
It's going to get bounced, but I want to tell a story, so I guess I'm going to play this

01:49.040 --> 01:50.040
song anyway.

01:50.040 --> 01:57.400
It's going to get cut, but I know there's a lot of people in the audience already who

01:57.400 --> 02:03.680
know what I'm talking about, so I'm just going to play this tune to open it up and let

02:03.680 --> 02:14.040
them block the audio when we run it back.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.040
This one's for Nate.

02:18.040 --> 02:47.040
It's going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's

02:47.040 --> 03:16.040
going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going

03:16.040 --> 03:45.040
to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to

03:45.040 --> 04:14.040
get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to get cut, but it's going to get

04:14.040 --> 04:15.040
cut.

04:15.040 --> 04:23.520
This song is by a band called The Freddie Jones Band and They Are From Chicago.

04:23.520 --> 04:32.640
When Nathan and I were going to college together at Jepal University in Chicago, these guys

04:32.640 --> 04:35.780
used to play at the Cubby Bear.

04:35.780 --> 04:41.660
The Cubby Bear had a deal on Thursday nights, I think it was Thursday nights, that was $5

04:41.660 --> 04:46.660
at the door, and you got beer, band, and burgers.

04:46.940 --> 04:50.540
And I mean all of it as much as you wanted.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.380
And this was the band that played there

04:52.380 --> 04:55.020
quite often for B cubed.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.420
And it just seemed absurd.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.340
I mean, you could carry a pitcher of beer

04:59.340 --> 05:03.060
back to your table with like a plate of burgers.

05:03.060 --> 05:06.060
And this dude was pulling this off for $5.

05:07.060 --> 05:11.060
For $5, I can tell you we didn't always remember

05:12.620 --> 05:15.140
how we got home from this night.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.700
Some of the most amazing, carefree times of my life

05:19.700 --> 05:22.220
shared with that guy who died on December 3rd

05:22.220 --> 05:24.780
from this horrible narrative.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.060
Ahem.

05:36.140 --> 05:39.580
We're all gonna lose good friends from this, you know.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.420
It's gonna happen to all of us.

05:42.780 --> 05:46.020
And Nathan's family's going through a lot more

05:46.020 --> 05:47.260
than any of his friends are,

05:47.260 --> 05:49.180
and all of his friends are going through what I'm going.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.700
I'm not some kind of special guy.

05:50.700 --> 05:54.340
Nathan changed hundreds of people's lives.

05:55.260 --> 05:57.180
And now you've gotta think about all the fathers

05:57.180 --> 05:58.020
that have been lost.

05:58.020 --> 06:01.300
All the fathers, all the moms, all the kids.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.660
This is big time, ladies and gentlemen.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.420
And maybe I haven't been vocal and angry enough

06:09.420 --> 06:12.860
because I haven't had anybody go, you know, yet.

06:12.860 --> 06:16.380
But if I haven't been, then,

06:16.380 --> 06:18.580
and anyone's ever felt this respect,

06:18.580 --> 06:19.540
then, you know, here it is.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.180
I apologize because it is really something extraordinary

06:24.180 --> 06:25.380
that they've done to us.

06:25.380 --> 06:29.420
As societies, as families, as communities,

06:29.420 --> 06:31.780
and if we're gonna break out of this,

06:31.780 --> 06:34.020
every one of us is gonna have to find the courage

06:34.020 --> 06:35.140
to step up.

06:35.140 --> 06:39.660
And we're not gonna be able to watch this happen on TV, guys.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.540
We're really not.

06:43.140 --> 06:43.980
We're really not.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.020
I'm a patch clamp physiologist.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.740
That means I was an academic biologist.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.060
This is gigo and biological

06:51.060 --> 06:53.420
because I used to make gigo home seals for a living.

06:53.420 --> 06:54.660
I don't need to explain that now.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.380
We're trying to figure out how to get through this Scooby-Doo.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.260
We have been fooled into believing

07:00.260 --> 07:02.980
that there is a mystery to solve

07:02.980 --> 07:06.620
and that we are teenagers who were smart enough to solve it.

07:06.620 --> 07:11.260
And we've gotta reawaken to the idea that we've been played.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.580
A lot of us actually need to be,

07:14.540 --> 07:15.980
for the first time in our lives,

07:15.980 --> 07:18.620
need to be awakened to the fact that we've been played.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.340
And this is a very big truth to accept.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.100
And so it might not be the best way to start

07:24.100 --> 07:25.780
with everything that you know is a lie,

07:25.780 --> 07:28.620
but instead, start with some specific things.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.940
And that's what I think we are trying to do

07:30.940 --> 07:33.580
with this narrative about a faith

07:33.580 --> 07:37.980
or this narrative about a unquestionable doctrine,

07:37.980 --> 07:40.180
about a novel virus that killed millions,

07:40.180 --> 07:41.780
but millions more were saved from

07:41.780 --> 07:43.060
that might have been gain of function

07:43.060 --> 07:44.380
because gain of function is real

07:44.380 --> 07:46.540
and therefore a virus will come again.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.300
This idea is not questioned.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.540
And in fact, I think people that have been working

07:51.540 --> 07:53.140
with gigo home biological,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.060
we've all come to the conclusion

07:55.060 --> 07:59.820
that really they intended for this to be the conclusion

07:59.820 --> 08:03.780
that we all came to at the end of this fiasco.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.740
And so if we can start to, oops,

08:05.740 --> 08:10.100
that's a slide in progress, I apologize for that.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.580
If we can figure out how to erase this idea

08:14.580 --> 08:16.540
from our friends and family

08:16.540 --> 08:20.180
that these are all sources of pandemic potential

08:20.180 --> 08:23.900
from laboratories to genetic stitching,

08:23.900 --> 08:25.780
then we might be able to save them from this

08:25.780 --> 08:30.540
because this illusion of a worst case scenario

08:30.540 --> 08:34.220
is what is gonna trap most of the people

08:34.220 --> 08:37.820
who think, well, okay, maybe this wasn't that one,

08:37.820 --> 08:39.620
but these people are doing gain of function.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.980
We've gotta stop them from doing this

08:42.980 --> 08:46.580
before the real worst case scenario happens.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.860
And so even that urgent need

08:49.860 --> 08:54.860
or urgent, that intuition that we have to step up

08:55.620 --> 08:57.900
to that part of the mythology

08:57.900 --> 09:02.420
is also playing directly into this goal of theirs,

09:02.420 --> 09:04.940
which is to get us to accept that there was a novel virus

09:04.940 --> 09:06.580
and that one could come again.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.420
And so we've gotta be very careful

09:09.420 --> 09:13.780
because we've really, I think, succinctly identified this

09:13.780 --> 09:15.660
as the trap.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.780
And the curious thing is, is that in a lot of ways,

09:20.660 --> 09:25.660
the no virus people, even as late as,

09:27.180 --> 09:28.820
well, very late in the narrative,

09:28.820 --> 09:30.660
did they also come to this conclusion

09:30.660 --> 09:32.540
where they started to say that gain of function

09:32.540 --> 09:36.740
is a mythology, but not very early on.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.340
I would suggest anybody that wants to do the research

09:39.340 --> 09:42.340
should start to go through month by month

09:42.340 --> 09:45.140
of what Sam Bailey was doing, for example.

09:45.140 --> 09:48.580
And I think you'll find that not only is there

09:48.660 --> 09:51.900
a pretty consistent lack of progress,

09:51.900 --> 09:53.620
but when they make progress,

09:53.620 --> 09:55.900
they're always making progress behind us.

09:57.060 --> 10:00.380
And it's basically just trying to absorb what we say

10:00.380 --> 10:03.140
so that they can still claim that they're farther along

10:03.140 --> 10:07.660
on this no virus path than we are and ridicule us

10:07.660 --> 10:10.660
based on our inability to make the progress

10:10.660 --> 10:13.540
to understand their farewell of virology document

10:13.540 --> 10:15.500
and its significance.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.540
So this inlusion of consensus, I think,

10:17.540 --> 10:21.140
is something we are really starting to penetrate,

10:21.140 --> 10:22.580
something we are starting to break.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.860
I feel like even though we might all still feel

10:25.860 --> 10:28.940
a little bit like we're trapped in the car,

10:28.940 --> 10:30.740
I do think it's also possible

10:30.740 --> 10:35.740
that this repetitive discussion starts

10:36.340 --> 10:41.260
to make the sort of boundaries of this cognitive prison

10:41.260 --> 10:43.540
that we've been put in, it makes those boundaries

10:43.540 --> 10:46.820
very visible, very, very tangible.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.380
And so the new world order that they're trying to assemble

10:50.380 --> 10:53.380
around us is coming together really quickly on all forms,

10:53.380 --> 10:56.940
but it's this central dogma that we've really got to attack

10:56.940 --> 10:59.220
because everything else pivots from it

10:59.220 --> 11:01.660
and everything else requires it.

11:01.660 --> 11:06.140
They're not gonna be able to get us on digital currency

11:06.140 --> 11:09.500
without another crisis.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.700
They're not gonna be able to get us to take digital ID

11:11.700 --> 11:12.860
without another crisis.

11:12.860 --> 11:14.780
I guess unless they start giving away free money

11:14.780 --> 11:18.460
and even then, anyway, I don't wanna wax too intellectual

11:18.460 --> 11:21.580
about that, only to say that I think we can still

11:21.580 --> 11:22.660
make a lot of progress.

11:22.660 --> 11:25.500
There are still people who I think are probably

11:25.500 --> 11:26.620
trying to do the right thing,

11:26.620 --> 11:29.980
or maybe already knew that they weren't doing the right thing,

11:29.980 --> 11:32.180
but are just looking for the right window

11:33.620 --> 11:36.540
through which to step and admit that they made mistakes.

11:36.540 --> 11:39.580
And so I wanna give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt.

11:39.580 --> 11:42.820
Unfortunately, this week I got blocked by Robert Malone

11:43.660 --> 11:48.660
It was since I got my, I was briefly off Twitter

11:49.220 --> 11:51.100
when I got reinstated.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.820
Yeah, I was able to look at his tweets

11:55.820 --> 11:57.140
and it's not really been a problem,

11:57.140 --> 12:00.340
but apparently now I've said something.

12:00.340 --> 12:04.660
And so yesterday I just wanted to cover sort of a dress again

12:04.660 --> 12:06.100
yesterday I looked at a video

12:06.100 --> 12:08.980
where Joseph Mercola interviewed Nurse Aaron

12:08.980 --> 12:11.500
and some people kind of responded with a little bit of

12:13.820 --> 12:16.940
let's say they were a little defensive of Joe.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.740
And I appreciate that.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.540
And I just wanted to say very quickly

12:20.540 --> 12:25.540
that I didn't intend for that to be much of a inspection

12:26.500 --> 12:28.340
of Joe and his position,

12:28.340 --> 12:33.340
although I would suspect given his status

12:33.540 --> 12:37.700
before the pandemic, he would have been somebody who

12:37.700 --> 12:41.860
in some way or another would have been a notice

12:41.860 --> 12:44.940
as to being careful and whatever.

12:44.940 --> 12:49.140
So the fact that in August of 2020

12:49.140 --> 12:51.900
he was still thinking there was a virus is not very crazy

12:51.900 --> 12:54.540
because guess who else was, I was.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.540
So let's not, I don't wanna at all in any way shape or form

13:01.140 --> 13:03.020
think that that video is a critique of him.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.780
It was really about Nurse Aaron.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.900
And so in order to make sure that we get that understood

13:07.900 --> 13:09.580
I just thought I would remind everybody

13:09.580 --> 13:11.620
in case you're not aware that Nurse Aaron

13:11.620 --> 13:14.700
and Robert Malone are actually more connected

13:14.700 --> 13:18.300
through video production than a podcast

13:18.300 --> 13:21.460
with Joe Macolez.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.740
I mean, that's two hours of work

13:23.740 --> 13:26.380
but we're not talking about two hours of work here.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.980
We're talking about a music video.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.580
And so again,

13:33.780 --> 13:37.380
what I very much want to encourage everyone to consider

13:37.380 --> 13:40.020
especially if you've been actively engaged

13:40.060 --> 13:43.420
in trying to understand for a very long time

13:43.420 --> 13:46.620
to try and use that historical knowledge in your mind

13:46.620 --> 13:51.620
to interrogate where these people were

13:52.620 --> 13:56.340
in 2020, 2021, 2022.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.420
If possible, go back to 2019.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.980
Because I think what you will see is that

14:02.980 --> 14:07.820
the way that these people not only didn't question

14:08.820 --> 14:11.020
this narrative that's here in the middle,

14:11.020 --> 14:13.020
this novel virus that killed millions

14:13.020 --> 14:17.780
but knew that this novel virus would kill millions

14:17.780 --> 14:18.860
before it had.

14:19.780 --> 14:22.980
That's a very significant group of people to be in

14:22.980 --> 14:24.500
because I'm not in that group.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.260
A lot of people didn't speculate about the potential

14:29.260 --> 14:33.300
that this virus had but a lot of people around this circle

14:33.340 --> 14:38.100
did some of them knew astronomical numbers

14:38.100 --> 14:42.420
could result and felt comfortable saying it.

14:45.540 --> 14:48.740
So I think it's important that as we rearrange these pieces

14:48.740 --> 14:50.020
and we start to think about, you know,

14:50.020 --> 14:51.340
who can we move in the middle here?

14:51.340 --> 14:53.860
Who can we organize around?

14:53.860 --> 14:57.060
And who can we count on to amplify our messages

14:57.060 --> 15:02.060
as we refine them versus who can we count on to mess with us?

15:04.060 --> 15:08.140
Welcome to the chamois here, 2030.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.940
Brought to you by Liza.

15:09.940 --> 15:13.340
I hope you have your bug protein and VR goggles ready

15:13.340 --> 15:15.140
as you sit there owning nothing

15:15.140 --> 15:17.100
because you're in for a treat.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.620
I mean, how many people think that's a good guy?

15:21.860 --> 15:24.300
I mean, we'd like to believe he is, right?

15:24.300 --> 15:26.220
It'd be great to believe he is.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.140
But wait till you see how many people are in this video.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.300
Come on, don't screw me up here tonight.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.300
We have many celebrities in the house

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
that we tell you you care about

15:42.300 --> 15:44.300
and they pretend to care about you

15:44.300 --> 15:46.300
and they're definitely not mouthpieces

15:46.300 --> 15:48.300
of their puppet masters used to promote

15:48.300 --> 15:49.300
various vested interests.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.300
Definitely not that.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.300
So without further ado,

15:52.300 --> 15:54.300
let's get into our first category.

15:54.300 --> 15:58.300
In the best rap group of the year award goes to...

16:00.300 --> 16:02.300
...street boys.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.300
So what?

16:12.300 --> 16:15.300
Nurse Aaron and Robert Malone

16:17.300 --> 16:21.300
in a video of kind of a crappy rap group.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.300
Now, I want you to think about,

16:24.300 --> 16:28.300
I think again about what we know about Nurse Aaron now,

16:28.300 --> 16:31.300
how we can really look back and see

16:31.300 --> 16:33.300
that something wasn't right,

16:33.300 --> 16:36.300
that she was likely a medler in New York City.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.300
Think about what it means now,

16:38.300 --> 16:41.300
that she's in this music video with Robert Malone.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.300
This cannot be some kind of random thing

16:44.300 --> 16:46.300
where the dissidents are getting together

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
to work together to fight this.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.300
It's not possible.

16:54.300 --> 16:58.300
Now what if somebody who was instrumental

16:58.300 --> 17:01.300
in building up Tim Poole shows up on here?

17:01.300 --> 17:03.300
What if two guys who are instrumental

17:03.300 --> 17:07.300
in that sort of second tier of social media on YouTube

17:07.300 --> 17:08.300
are on here?

17:08.300 --> 17:09.300
What if...

17:09.300 --> 17:11.300
Mm-mm.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
Who's that?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.300
Isn't that Luke something or other

17:46.300 --> 17:50.300
who actually cut his teeth during 9-11?

17:50.300 --> 17:57.300
Actually, I think he's attached to that weird guy.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.300
Yeah, I mean, he's old school.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.300
And he was on Tim Poole for a long time

18:08.300 --> 18:11.300
and he's got his own show now.

18:11.300 --> 18:17.300
And so this was co-opted indie media

18:17.300 --> 18:20.300
from 10 years ago already.

18:22.300 --> 18:25.300
So even if they're unwitting participants,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.300
they're participating because they think

18:27.300 --> 18:29.300
this is the cool kids room.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.300
He's sitting next to Jill Glass Poole Malone

18:32.300 --> 18:34.300
in a music rap video

18:34.300 --> 18:37.300
with a guy who's dressed like a decrepit

18:37.300 --> 18:40.300
Charles Swarkar or Klaus Schwab.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.300
I want...

18:46.300 --> 18:48.300
Just let your imagination run wild

18:48.300 --> 18:50.300
and come up with normal reasons.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.300
Where's Bobby Kennedy in this video?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
Okay, he's a controlled op.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.300
Why isn't he in there?

18:59.300 --> 19:03.300
Maybe because he doesn't work for that group of people, right?

19:04.300 --> 19:07.300
Maybe because he's not on that team, right?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.300
Who else is going to be in this video?

19:10.300 --> 19:12.300
Who else is on this team?

19:34.300 --> 19:36.300
You'll enjoy having less

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
and then to trade the cap and natural reason

19:38.300 --> 19:39.300
privileged or impressed

19:39.300 --> 19:41.300
to all his to have sex

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
once you forget that, I said that.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.300
So you've got droplets,

19:44.300 --> 19:45.600
you actually have to wear a few masks

19:45.600 --> 19:47.300
on your backside, on your rectum

19:47.300 --> 19:49.300
because the drugs sound like coughs

19:49.300 --> 19:52.300
so all in in, across the country across the world.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.300
Look at this guy.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.300
Go on the toilet and actually come up your toilet

19:55.300 --> 19:56.300
and it actually gets you sick.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.300
He's also another one of those...

19:58.300 --> 19:59.300
Okay, what is this?

19:59.300 --> 20:00.300
Right-wing...

20:01.300 --> 20:02.300
Idiots.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.300
You're not gonna exist!

20:03.300 --> 20:13.940
he does stunts where he you know yells at people on the street like AOC sorry

20:13.940 --> 20:20.820
about that but my point is is that what is what is he doing in this video why is

20:20.820 --> 20:26.820
he here unless they're all on the same more or less on the same team right

20:26.820 --> 20:32.700
funded by the same interests funded by the same weaponized piles of money but

20:32.700 --> 20:37.760
the idea that Aaron is in the background that that Robert and Jill are in the

20:37.760 --> 20:54.620
foreground think about this it's not the only one it's not the only video class

20:54.620 --> 21:00.840
please welcome the new student Robert it's just it's not a one-off thanks for

21:00.840 --> 21:13.920
the warm welcome teach it's lit no cap so what's happening here what is

21:13.920 --> 21:19.460
happening here what is this other than a mockery of us you want to think it's

21:19.460 --> 21:27.360
mocking the left and that's why the the very let's say unsophisticated might

21:27.360 --> 21:33.280
share this as a mock of the left but what is it really it's a mocking of us

21:33.280 --> 21:37.520
because this is not saving us from the pandemic yet these are supposed to be

21:37.520 --> 21:46.080
people who were helping us with the pandemic so what it happened was in my

21:46.080 --> 21:49.800
humble opinion is that it became about everything else it didn't become about

21:49.800 --> 21:56.600
this about these people who were murdered and people said it was a mystery

21:56.640 --> 22:01.880
virus but they were actually murdered and so the idea was to get your

22:01.880 --> 22:06.720
attention and move you on to other things like rap videos about the left

22:06.720 --> 22:13.400
with guys that are cross-dressing as teenage as teachers and Robert Malone's

22:13.400 --> 22:21.680
playing a kid and I don't know what that video was about but that's exactly

22:21.680 --> 22:28.720
what it was about because if we were serious about this if we were serious

22:28.720 --> 22:34.000
about the people who have been murdered if we were serious about getting justice

22:34.000 --> 22:41.920
for them and and and solving this crime if Robert Malone was serious about this

22:41.920 --> 22:47.240
then he wouldn't be making music videos like that he wouldn't have time but he's

22:47.240 --> 22:52.160
got time to fly all around the world go to Oslo and release his book in

22:52.160 --> 22:58.680
Norwegian then stop by the Parliament and tell him how the Scooby-Doo is

22:58.680 --> 23:01.280
progressing

23:06.040 --> 23:12.080
the mystery virus cannot be equated to the excess deaths because the excess

23:12.080 --> 23:15.800
deaths have come from do not resuscitate orders from the poor use of

23:15.800 --> 23:21.200
ventilators the lack of antibiotics the poor use of steroids the deployment of

23:21.200 --> 23:26.160
remdesivir medazalam etc the opioid deaths that have skyrocketed over the

23:26.160 --> 23:29.840
last three years and are completely unaccounted for the death certificate

23:29.840 --> 23:35.880
fraud and the things go the list goes on and on and on and this was all part of

23:35.880 --> 23:44.560
it elaborate hoax because most likely the biosecurity state after investing

23:44.560 --> 23:50.440
tens of millions of dollars and and decades in the research they realized

23:50.440 --> 23:55.360
that coronaviruses and RNA viruses and DNA viruses were nothing that they could

23:55.360 --> 24:03.840
really make into a useful bio weapon and so instead they told you a story about

24:03.840 --> 24:08.720
it they studied the background they understood the background they understood

24:08.720 --> 24:14.440
what was there they understood how the train moved and then they told you that

24:14.520 --> 24:23.560
hey hey hey there's a pandemic and watch us help you and they have no effect on

24:23.560 --> 24:27.680
the natural phenomenon whatever it is the background signal that they're lying

24:27.680 --> 24:32.720
about the infectious clones that they're planting somewhere every once in a while

24:32.720 --> 24:38.440
I don't know it's a crime I just know that RNA can't do it and so they needed

24:38.440 --> 24:44.120
to make up all kinds of things for us to argue about instead they needed us to

24:44.120 --> 24:47.120
argue about whether or not it was a novel virus and that everyone was

24:47.120 --> 24:51.000
vulnerable and lots of people took that stance they needed to argue about whether

24:51.000 --> 24:55.640
PCR and lateral flow testing were being overused or not or we should have had

24:55.640 --> 24:59.720
them earlier they needed us to debate about whether or not hydroxychloroquine

24:59.720 --> 25:03.760
and Ivermectin worked or not because that would make us think again that it's a

25:03.760 --> 25:10.760
novel virus so we might need new things and then they added the financial

25:10.800 --> 25:16.600
incentives then they added this home care elderly elderly home malfeasance where

25:16.600 --> 25:20.360
they sent people back and they didn't give them any antibiotics but they had

25:20.360 --> 25:26.040
pneumonia and they made us argue about like there's no virus or it's 5g or any

25:26.040 --> 25:32.160
of these other distracting stories that in the end might be true in places but

25:32.160 --> 25:36.040
in reality are all about confusion all about to get you to think that all the

25:36.040 --> 25:40.040
people that are doing all this stuff and so and all these books are doing exactly

25:40.080 --> 25:45.080
what this guy in the train is doing and nothing more and as long as they do it

25:45.080 --> 25:48.680
coordinatedly and as long as they don't question the novel virus that killed

25:48.680 --> 25:52.160
millions and millions more were saved from and they don't question gain of

25:52.160 --> 26:00.560
function then the train illusion works and the grift goes on and the mythology

26:00.560 --> 26:08.000
is preserved tomorrow in Parliament we've got a committee room from five till

26:08.040 --> 26:13.040
seven for two hours I'm hosting a presentation by leading scientists who

26:13.040 --> 26:16.320
are skeptical about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine we're going to

26:16.320 --> 26:24.440
present solid evidence to an audience of MPs peers and the lobby journalists and

26:24.440 --> 26:28.040
we're going to try and break the narrative of safe and effective once

26:28.040 --> 26:33.520
and for all it'll be fascinating to see how the mainstream media respond to these

26:33.520 --> 26:37.800
presentations they've all been invited as of every member of the House of Commons

26:37.800 --> 26:42.240
and every member of the House of Lords I have the pleasure and the honor of

26:42.240 --> 26:46.880
being invited to speak in Parliament tomorrow in support of Andrew Bridgion

26:46.880 --> 26:54.200
these modified mRNA based products are not well-established vaccine technology

26:54.200 --> 27:00.760
I think we can now all agree on that I can say personally that this is gene

27:00.760 --> 27:06.000
therapy technology applied to vaccination because I made the original patent

27:06.040 --> 27:11.400
disclosures I was involved deeply with the team that did the original reduction

27:11.400 --> 27:16.360
to practice in mice that demonstrated that this would work back in 1989 and

27:16.360 --> 27:23.000
1990 and it was explicitly a product of a gene therapy program and a gene

27:23.000 --> 27:27.920
therapy lab so what are the risks associated with this well one thing

27:27.920 --> 27:33.120
we've learned recently is these products are contaminated we can argue about

27:33.160 --> 27:37.520
whether or not they meet the formal criteria for adulteration but they have

27:37.520 --> 27:43.160
a significant fraction of unpurified DNA fragments that are included in the

27:43.160 --> 27:49.640
product and historically regulatory agencies all through the world have

27:49.640 --> 27:56.360
considered such DNA fragments to be a high risk for potential cancer and

27:56.680 --> 28:04.600
genomic alterations and so once again I think we should be able to agree that

28:04.600 --> 28:12.240
in general DNA fragment contamination is a risk and to just assure us cart

28:12.240 --> 28:18.840
blanche that this risk is negligible is not acceptable in my opinion the

28:18.840 --> 28:24.200
COVID vaccines were pretty much all risk and no benefit the risk of infection

28:24.200 --> 28:30.320
went up the risk of hospitalization from COVID didn't change at all the risk

28:30.320 --> 28:36.600
of death from COVID went up and the risk of death just all caused mortality went

28:36.600 --> 28:41.760
up as well all due to the COVID vaccines they were perhaps the worst

28:41.760 --> 28:49.000
intervention in all medical history we have censorship it's happening worldwide

28:49.080 --> 28:55.280
people who are trying to tell the truth get censored we have immunity for the

28:55.280 --> 28:59.560
drug companies and finally we have intimidation tactics things like job

28:59.560 --> 29:04.560
loss or loss of credentials against doctors who are simply speaking the

29:04.560 --> 29:09.600
truth the most skilled industry today at deploying this information is the

29:09.600 --> 29:12.840
pharmaceutical industry and they've been doing this for decades to really any

29:12.840 --> 29:18.040
safe cheap effective therapy that does not afford them obscene profits my life

29:18.080 --> 29:23.880
has been drastically and irrevocably altered since I started to bring out what

29:23.880 --> 29:28.880
is inconvenient science to that industry in the media I am called just the most

29:28.880 --> 29:34.200
unpleasant adjectives fringe quack radical right wing and then always as a

29:34.200 --> 29:37.960
misinformationist and it's it's so that people won't listen to me because they

29:37.960 --> 29:43.560
don't want you to listen to me but of all the tactics the foundation of the

29:43.560 --> 29:47.960
entire disinformation campaign against Ivermectin rests at the level of the

29:47.960 --> 29:53.640
trialists and the journals who conducted really just about a handful of large

29:53.640 --> 29:58.280
what are called rigorous high-quality randomized control trials and I will be

29:58.280 --> 30:04.400
informing the MPs of numerous brazen actions taken in the design and conduct

30:04.400 --> 30:08.840
of those trials to reach a result which showed that Ivermectin didn't work and

30:08.840 --> 30:13.800
those trialists had to do innumerable things to suppress the evidence of

30:13.800 --> 30:17.320
advocacy and I will tell you large part of the corruption was actually conducted

30:17.320 --> 30:21.680
by researchers in the United Kingdom and I think the MPs are going to be quite

30:21.680 --> 30:25.840
concerned to learn that it was at the University of Liverpool and Oxford where

30:25.840 --> 30:30.840
two of the main bases of a corrupt trialists you can't misinform with facts and

30:30.840 --> 30:37.480
the facts are very simple in 2002 the industrial complex of coronavirus began

30:37.520 --> 30:42.280
with the filing of the patents in 2002 for the infectious replication defective

30:42.280 --> 30:46.760
clone of coronavirus that was established by Ralph Berwick. Three short years later

30:46.760 --> 30:53.160
at DARPA MITRE he actually announced a program called biohacking synthetic

30:53.160 --> 30:58.800
coronavirus a bio warfare enabling technology those are not misinformation

30:58.800 --> 31:02.920
that is not a conspiracy theory that's a fact it's pulled right off of Ralph

31:02.960 --> 31:08.120
Berwick CV and if we look at the funding ever since then what we see is that the

31:08.120 --> 31:13.160
manipulation of the model of coronavirus has been the basis for a very concerted

31:13.160 --> 31:19.320
campaign to get to the point where in 2015 Peter Dashick said that to get the

31:19.320 --> 31:24.320
public to increase its understanding for the need for a pan coronavirus vaccine

31:24.320 --> 31:29.720
we needed to create a media hype event and that we would need to use that hype

31:29.720 --> 31:33.920
to our advantage to get to the real issues his words investors will respond

31:33.920 --> 31:39.160
if they see profit at the end of the process this was not an accident of

31:39.160 --> 31:43.960
nature this was not a who could have seen it coming this was not a random event

31:43.960 --> 31:49.160
that happened in Wuhan this is something where in 2016 Ralph Berwick and his team

31:49.160 --> 31:53.800
published a paper that said the Wuhan Institute of Virology virus was and I

31:53.800 --> 31:59.200
quote poised for human emergence this was not a set of random circumstances this

31:59.200 --> 32:03.360
was not a set of random events and this is not a conspiracy and it's not

32:03.360 --> 32:08.080
misinformation every word that I just stated is published in the proceedings

32:08.080 --> 32:14.160
of the National Academy of Sciences and if we are now stating that quoting from

32:14.160 --> 32:17.680
the National Academy of Sciences is misinformation then I'm guilty of that

32:17.680 --> 32:22.360
but the fact of the matter is they said follow the science that's exactly what

32:22.360 --> 32:26.240
we're doing and we're following the money behind the science and Britain can't

32:26.240 --> 32:32.440
escape culpability because beginning in the 1960s what we actually saw was a

32:32.440 --> 32:35.960
collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom with the welcome

32:35.960 --> 32:40.600
trust funding all of this nonsense in partnership ultimately with the Rockefeller

32:40.600 --> 32:45.880
Foundation in the United States they decided to pick coronavirus as a model

32:45.880 --> 32:52.400
of pathogen to use for social transformation and biological agent

32:52.400 --> 32:56.560
dissemination so this is not a conspiracy this is not misinformation this is a

32:56.560 --> 33:02.520
program that's been in place for over now 60 years none of us that are going to be

33:02.520 --> 33:08.600
testifying are conspiracy theorists as we've been labeled in the press we're

33:08.600 --> 33:16.760
just scientists physicians and data analysts that are asking questions seeking

33:16.760 --> 33:22.160
the answers objectively recognizing that we have all been through a major

33:22.160 --> 33:28.320
trauma over the last four years it's been four years now and suggesting that

33:28.320 --> 33:33.720
Andrew Bridgion has been a canary in the coal mine he has been one of the few

33:33.720 --> 33:38.680
courageous that have been willing to speak to the government here in Parliament

33:38.680 --> 33:45.280
about these potential concerns and is seeking answers that's all we're asking

33:45.280 --> 33:50.680
show us the data privately lots of MPs have come to me over the last 12

33:50.680 --> 33:54.080
months and said Andrew you're you're absolutely over the target that's why

33:54.080 --> 33:59.440
you're getting the flack keep going well now is the time for those MPs and

33:59.440 --> 34:04.480
others to come and listen to what these experts the evidence they've got with

34:04.480 --> 34:09.040
regard to the vaccine harms the excess deaths and bring this sorry affair to

34:09.520 --> 34:16.080
an end quite honestly the public know and we now need our elected politicians to

34:16.080 --> 34:20.760
get off the fence and look at the science and do the right thing for the

34:20.760 --> 34:25.640
nation and indeed the world because if we can stop this anywhere it's going to

34:25.640 --> 34:29.000
stop it everywhere

34:39.120 --> 34:43.600
there were other people testifying but I just want to play what I think is

34:43.600 --> 34:48.200
Robert Malone's testimony because I want you to hear it it's the audio is tough

34:48.200 --> 34:54.440
so just bear with me I'm gonna adjust it on the fly here hopefully it'll work

34:58.360 --> 35:04.860
thank you for that and now I'm looking forward to the moment so I'm Robert

35:04.860 --> 35:09.160
Malone I'm a physician and scientist and I need to acknowledge that my

35:09.160 --> 35:13.100
middle name is Wallace and Andrew has assured me that I will not be drawing

35:13.100 --> 35:30.180
quarter for what I've got to say first off I wish to speak there is an unmet

35:30.180 --> 35:37.740
need for a rapid response capability to allow a global capacity to mitigate

35:37.740 --> 35:43.140
the risks of emerging infectious disease and engineering pathogens that is a

35:43.140 --> 35:49.740
valid concern the technology has developed to the state where almost any

35:49.740 --> 35:59.740
with a undergraduate degree in biology can weaponize pathogens

36:07.620 --> 36:14.060
sorry about that I'm gonna play it back again I just I couldn't help it that

36:14.060 --> 36:17.900
that's really the start right I mean there we are already with the the faith

36:17.940 --> 36:25.540
it's a testament to the faith from the start there is a need for a rapid

36:25.540 --> 36:33.940
response it is a valid concern this idea of a pandemic pathogen it's a valid

36:33.940 --> 36:36.820
concern it is a it is a valid need

36:47.900 --> 36:55.220
first off I'm I wish to speak extemporaneously there is an unmet need

36:55.220 --> 37:03.180
for a rapid response capability to allow a global capacity to mitigate the risks

37:03.180 --> 37:08.380
of emerging infectious disease and engineering pathogens that is a valid

37:08.380 --> 37:16.060
concern the technology has developed to the state where almost any with a

37:16.060 --> 37:22.180
undergraduate degree in biology can weaponize pathogens we know here in the

37:22.180 --> 37:27.180
United States is somebody with security clearance in the biocence industrial

37:27.180 --> 37:33.140
complex for the DoD that the binary weapons that were developed by US

37:33.140 --> 37:39.820
military or deployment potentially is countermeasure against the Russian tank

37:39.820 --> 37:47.020
red can be readily reproduced by virtually any biologist in the garage

37:47.020 --> 37:57.980
for any biologist in their garage I mean any garage any biologist in their garage

37:57.980 --> 38:03.820
stop lying it's unbelievable it's unbelievable what he's saying here I

38:03.820 --> 38:08.260
almost feel like I have to play it one more time

38:15.540 --> 38:24.220
first off I wish to speak extemporaneously there is an unmet need for a rapid

38:24.220 --> 38:31.620
response capability to allow a global capacity to mitigate the risks of

38:31.620 --> 38:36.460
emerging infectious disease and engineering pathogens that is a valid

38:36.460 --> 38:44.180
concern the technology has developed to the state where almost any with a

38:44.180 --> 38:51.180
undergraduate degree in biology can weaponize pathogens the United States is

38:51.180 --> 38:56.980
somebody with security clearance in the biocence industrial complex for the DoD

38:56.980 --> 39:04.500
that's the binary weapons that were developed by US military or deployment

39:04.500 --> 39:10.780
potentially is countermeasure against the Russian tank threat can be readily

39:10.780 --> 39:20.140
reproduced by virtually any biologist any so there is a valid threat there is

39:20.140 --> 39:28.780
an unmet need ostensibly this technology was advanced this mRNA or modified

39:28.780 --> 39:36.140
messenger right with nucleic acid base gene therapy vaccination technology was

39:36.140 --> 39:42.180
advanced on short notice because there is an unmet need for a platform I want you

39:42.180 --> 39:47.620
to think about how amazing it is that he needed to use like five words instead

39:47.620 --> 39:53.540
of saying transfection in order to sound really smart like there's a real

39:53.540 --> 39:59.740
specific word for it Bob hits transfection why don't you just say

39:59.740 --> 40:06.820
transfection for shits sake ostensibly this technology was advanced this mRNA

40:06.820 --> 40:14.700
or modified messenger right with nucleic acid base gene therapy vaccination

40:14.700 --> 40:21.740
technology I mean come on because there is an unmet need for a platform

40:21.740 --> 40:26.700
technology that allowed a rapid response capability that's the justification

40:26.700 --> 40:34.380
furthermore the justification was that we had a pathogen based on modeling here in

40:34.380 --> 40:40.420
the UK and Imperial College it had a 3.4% case fatality rate and we would

40:40.420 --> 40:49.140
potentially be we had a pathogen that based on the modeling from UCL he just

40:49.140 --> 40:57.580
cited the model that we know is absolute nonsense was worst case scenario malarkey

40:57.580 --> 41:02.380
as if well this is the model we had we kind of thought it was really spreading

41:02.380 --> 41:10.220
fast so you know we did the best we could with the spreading pathogen holy

41:10.220 --> 41:16.460
this is the end of 2023 ladies and gentlemen I want you to think about how

41:16.460 --> 41:24.900
implausible this video would be to yourself in 2021 or even 2022 you had

41:24.900 --> 41:27.900
never believed it

41:29.660 --> 41:38.900
seeing mass graves people dying in the streets bands full of bodies outside of

41:38.900 --> 41:45.540
hospitals that was all along we knew that was a lie very early on but the

41:45.540 --> 41:49.420
people that spoke the truth that actually gathered the data such as

41:49.420 --> 41:55.500
happened in Stanford that demonstrated that we had a case fatality rate of about

41:55.500 --> 42:08.820
0.02% well okay so then what 3.4% despite having that knowledge making it

42:08.820 --> 42:13.620
having it available in the first quarter early in the first quarter 2020 and it

42:13.660 --> 42:23.580
actually wasn't even that high why why because they were killing people that

42:23.580 --> 42:31.180
fatality rate is based on the ventilation dip shittery and the antibiotics dip

42:31.180 --> 42:36.580
shittery and the Remdesivir dip shittery and all the other dip shittery that went

42:36.580 --> 42:44.100
on for a year and a half is there gonna be no accounting are they not going to

42:44.100 --> 42:48.340
subtract all the things that we now know need to be subtracted from the excess

42:48.340 --> 42:54.260
deaths in order to understand what the mystery virus did are you telling me

42:54.260 --> 43:00.300
that this panel of of eminent experts that includes serial entrepreneur and

43:00.300 --> 43:05.100
inventor of the optic mouse Steve Kersch are not going to do the math well

43:05.100 --> 43:11.340
surprise surprise huh there was a concerted effort to justify the

43:11.340 --> 43:18.460
imposition of this technology in a rapid fashion on the basis of the thesis that

43:18.460 --> 43:24.300
there's a 3.4% case fatality rate associated with this virus what transpired

43:24.300 --> 43:29.700
in that rush was a fundamental reach of both ethics and regulatory norms that

43:29.700 --> 43:33.420
have been developed over decades we're all familiar with this we're all

43:33.420 --> 43:39.660
familiar with and so see we we threw out all the rules and we forced it on

43:39.660 --> 43:44.220
people and we rushed it and because we rushed it and whatever it was screwed

43:44.220 --> 43:49.900
up but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater at least mRNA worked

43:49.900 --> 43:57.340
pretty well right here comes the policies that have been put in place since

43:57.340 --> 44:03.940
World War II and Nuremberg that humans human beings have the right to inform

44:03.940 --> 44:12.100
consent and what was done here in a haphazard way under the justification

44:12.100 --> 44:21.380
ostensibly that we had to we had to essentially reject throw them to the

44:21.380 --> 44:27.220
rush norms that had been developed over decades both for assuring vaccine

44:27.220 --> 44:32.740
safety and for assuring informed consent patients was all all had to be

44:32.740 --> 44:39.100
jettisoned on short notice because of the threat of a 3.4% case fatality rate

44:39.100 --> 44:45.180
and the need to move a potential countermeasure forward without the new

44:45.180 --> 44:48.660
process that normally what about all those people on the internet that was

44:48.660 --> 44:54.540
saying it was like a red dragon or it was a black swan or a black swan dragon

44:54.540 --> 45:01.140
and a billion people were going to die what about those people where are they

45:01.140 --> 45:09.060
now what are they doing what are they saying you see this is all part of the

45:09.060 --> 45:13.500
same show all part of the same show where people got all excited about the

45:13.500 --> 45:17.860
spike protein the spike protein the spike protein is so designed the spike

45:17.860 --> 45:22.540
protein the spike protein it's got so many different sides the spike proteins

45:22.540 --> 45:31.460
got so many different inserts inside got so excited about it for a year they got

45:31.460 --> 45:34.660
excited about it and people were like yeah but there's they're transfecting

45:34.660 --> 45:43.620
people to the spike right now but the spike in the virus is much worse it was

45:43.620 --> 45:51.300
all a gigantic circus forget us all run around in circles and argue about

45:51.300 --> 45:55.540
things that don't matter when there's nothing really circulating when it's

45:55.540 --> 46:01.780
just a conflated background signal and a bunch of poorly made products that could

46:01.780 --> 46:06.180
have never been up to snuff because they rushed them out all of them not not

46:06.180 --> 46:12.260
just the shot don't you see how ironic it is I've just stumbled upon that right

46:12.260 --> 46:19.980
now if the shots were rushed then oh my goodness were the tests rushed rushed

46:19.980 --> 46:25.900
out if the shots were rushed the lateral flow tests that came into the UK from

46:25.900 --> 46:31.660
China were definitely if you think about it now it's kind of funny it's

46:31.660 --> 46:37.700
definitely they were rushed right so like are they really just gonna complain

46:37.740 --> 46:43.860
about that when the entire the entire drama all of this illusion was created

46:43.860 --> 46:50.300
by a compounding of compounding compounding stories and when all those

46:50.300 --> 46:55.380
stories were happening where was he well he was running around in the

46:55.380 --> 46:58.980
background getting EUAs for people right he was looking for unique

46:58.980 --> 47:03.100
combination of repurposed drugs it might be patentable he was looking to make

47:03.100 --> 47:08.460
money right up until June of 2021 where he decided to come out on Brett

47:08.460 --> 47:13.780
Weinstein's podcast and talk about how they were an example of how hybrid

47:13.780 --> 47:17.620
immunity could work you know with somebody in the middle taking the secret

47:17.620 --> 47:22.660
combination prophylactic Ivermectin and something else and over here Robert

47:22.660 --> 47:27.260
Malone who had been infected and then just like the genius immunologist he is

47:27.260 --> 47:30.780
he decided that you know he'd take the shot anyway and not argue for his own

47:30.900 --> 47:36.660
natural immunity and then he got long COVID from that somehow or something he

47:36.660 --> 47:46.140
didn't take the shot and of course Steve Kirsch was also vaccinated so that's

47:46.140 --> 47:50.780
great nice good job good job guys you saved everybody right you saved everyone

47:50.780 --> 47:55.980
thanks for coming out so early and being so forth right you guys saved so many

47:55.980 --> 48:02.740
people from taking the shot in June of 2021 let's listen as the hero continues

48:02.740 --> 48:10.060
take place that's what transpired and I can tell you you know I'm labeled as

48:10.060 --> 48:14.900
far right and all the pejorative's that we're all so familiar with including

48:14.900 --> 48:20.260
being a conspiracy theorist but all I am a physician and scientist who happened

48:20.260 --> 48:25.020
to have had a role in the genesis of this technology when I was a young man

48:25.020 --> 48:31.260
back in 1987 to 1990 young very very familiar with the technology work is

48:31.260 --> 48:36.260
academic to try to advance it until I determined that I could not overcome

48:36.260 --> 48:40.380
the toxicity associated with it and abandoned it for other technology

48:40.380 --> 48:47.420
platforms which I also developed and then when he came out and said that this

48:47.420 --> 48:53.660
happened he said that well yeah but I took the shot because why well because I

48:53.660 --> 48:59.260
assumed they fixed the problems that I couldn't fix after years of working on

48:59.260 --> 49:06.660
his own creation that was transfection that he invented he decided that he

49:06.660 --> 49:11.020
couldn't overcome these problems abandoned it for other technologies like

49:11.020 --> 49:17.380
electronic laser guns that can shoot DNA directly into your skin and patenting

49:17.380 --> 49:23.860
the idea of mucosal vaccines but never inventing one and in the meantime when

49:23.860 --> 49:27.900
he finally decided to speak out against the danger of lipid nanoparticle based

49:27.900 --> 49:33.300
transfection did he really say it was dangerous did he say anything about why

49:33.300 --> 49:37.620
well he wrote a paper that he didn't publicize and it was about antibody

49:37.620 --> 49:43.700
dependent enhancement which really isn't the same thing as what he just said here

49:43.700 --> 49:48.020
and nobody's even mentioning the fact that two of the lipid nanoparticle

49:48.020 --> 49:51.180
components are completely untested components never been used anywhere

49:51.180 --> 49:59.740
before proprietary new lip it's fun fun fun lots of variables here definitely but

49:59.740 --> 50:04.620
we are we are being handed an illusion if you were gonna say that this is the guy

50:04.620 --> 50:09.740
who came out and said something about it if you don't know the name Knut with

50:09.740 --> 50:16.820
Kowski you weren't even paying attention in 2020 then for real that's a whole

50:16.820 --> 50:21.820
that's a whole story of a man struggling for a year trying to come out

50:21.820 --> 50:28.580
against the narrative of the pandemic and getting his whole life burned and that

50:28.580 --> 50:34.660
was over before 2021 even started and we are at the end of 2023 now do you

50:34.660 --> 50:41.460
understand there's actually a whole history American history here now we are

50:41.460 --> 50:47.860
pertinent five years in certainly if you think of the first the year before the

50:47.860 --> 50:51.540
pandemic is a prep time that everybody needs to go back and watch movies from

50:51.540 --> 50:55.540
so you can see the before time again you can see the absurdity of the

50:55.540 --> 51:00.820
transition that occurred at the start of the pandemic when everybody was back on

51:00.820 --> 51:07.460
their heels that's when this this whole rearrangement of how we think about our

51:07.460 --> 51:13.820
relationship with each other and our biology started to just go haywire

51:13.820 --> 51:19.460
before that there was still there was still some temper it's still it was

51:19.460 --> 51:22.860
still a tempered attempt

51:23.500 --> 51:31.380
but in this case what what I have objected to is that as a physician and

51:31.380 --> 51:37.820
scientist who is well-trained in clinical research and regulatory affairs I

51:37.820 --> 51:45.740
decided to take the shot anyway that we have decimated my my discipline we

51:45.740 --> 51:51.700
have rejected the knowledge that myself has contributed to in all of my peers

51:51.700 --> 51:57.540
and colleagues over decades about how one should do this how one should act

51:57.540 --> 52:03.060
what steps one should take in order to ensure that we have safe and effective

52:03.060 --> 52:09.180
products for humans it's that simple why didn't he say vaccine safe and effective

52:09.180 --> 52:16.900
products he said it's an interesting choice of words and it is pivoting

52:16.900 --> 52:20.860
around of course he started with the faith that now there was a virus oh my

52:20.860 --> 52:26.020
goodness furthermore that we have rejected the norms that have been

52:26.020 --> 52:32.980
developed since World War II to respect human dignity to ensure that human

52:32.980 --> 52:41.220
beings are treated as as humans they are their their autonomy their sovereignty

52:41.220 --> 52:47.500
is respected that they are provided with informed consent instead of informed

52:47.500 --> 52:52.260
consent about the truth of these products and their developmental state

52:52.260 --> 52:58.060
their immature developmental state we were given a series of lives those lives

52:58.060 --> 53:03.140
included that these products were safe and effective of course without actually

53:03.140 --> 53:07.580
qualifying what's safe and effective was you'll recall safe and effective was

53:07.580 --> 53:14.220
repeated again and again and again without stating what that meant okay that's

53:14.260 --> 53:19.060
neuro linguistic program that's psychological operations that's propaganda

53:19.060 --> 53:24.500
we also received the propaganda that these products would remain at the site

53:24.500 --> 53:30.700
of injection and the draining lymph nodes that was known to be a falsehood before

53:30.700 --> 53:35.340
these products were ever deployed into humans furthermore and that's revealed

53:35.340 --> 53:41.940
by the non-clinical data packages from Japan and from Australia that have now

53:41.940 --> 53:47.300
been disclosed okay so we knew that these products deployed all through the

53:47.300 --> 53:52.860
body we knew that they didn't stay where they were injected we were also told

53:52.860 --> 53:59.580
the falsehood that these products in had a molecule this modified ribole nucleic

53:59.580 --> 54:05.060
acid which would only lasted your body for a short period of time we now know

54:05.060 --> 54:09.820
that these products remain in your body remain biologically active for an

54:09.900 --> 54:15.860
undetermined period of time of at least weeks and probably months another long

54:15.860 --> 54:25.060
we were also told that these products were it was necessary that none of us would

54:25.060 --> 54:30.620
be safe until we were all safe this was part of the propaganda campaign to insist

54:30.620 --> 54:36.380
that we all accept these products and that was done by the way in violation of

54:36.380 --> 54:45.780
low-established forms that involved coercion compulsion and enticement ice

54:45.780 --> 54:50.300
creams for children to take your jab or hamburgers or whatever the enticement

54:50.300 --> 54:56.900
was that is illegal that that is not something that is allowed to understand

54:56.900 --> 55:03.420
well-established bioethics it doesn't make it illegal then and it's an it's the

55:03.420 --> 55:07.700
wrong word to use because you can't really prosecute people it's it's against

55:07.700 --> 55:12.460
some fit some treaties in some you know the Helsinki declaration is not really a

55:12.460 --> 55:22.500
code as we move down this you know thing when we talk about bioethics and when he

55:22.500 --> 55:25.660
talks about bioethics you got to take it really with a grain of salt you don't

55:25.660 --> 55:29.020
want to be tempted into believing that he's a lawyer or that he knows what he's

55:29.020 --> 55:36.900
talking about he's he's saying things that are safe to say and it's not illegal

55:36.900 --> 55:43.340
it's against these these codes of conduct and that makes it against norms and

55:43.340 --> 55:50.900
stuff like that but it's not illegal okay so this this series of lives was used to

55:50.900 --> 55:56.780
justify deployment of these experimental products truly now this series of lies

55:56.820 --> 56:02.340
that he just listed did not contain any of the protocols it didn't talk about one

56:02.340 --> 56:10.660
protocol it didn't talk about one alternative source of excess deaths didn't

56:10.660 --> 56:15.140
talk about medazalam in the UK it didn't talk about people being sent back to

56:15.140 --> 56:20.180
nursing homes without antibiotics in America in the UK it didn't talk about

56:20.180 --> 56:27.140
remdesivir in America it did not talk about I mean he is not being precise

56:27.140 --> 56:37.060
enough to represent our side because he's not being precise about the faith and

56:37.060 --> 56:44.420
it's on purpose they're all they're all there on purpose that's why that video

56:44.420 --> 56:47.580
we're gonna go through it in a minute I'll let this one finish and then we'll go

56:47.580 --> 56:51.900
back to that one that we just watched great profit margins no doubt which

56:51.900 --> 56:56.460
were intended to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of a vaccine platform

56:56.460 --> 57:01.740
technology that then according to a hearing in the WHO in 2020 as our call

57:01.740 --> 57:08.780
ended up by Margaret Lou 21 2021 thank you Joe what we're established that this

57:08.780 --> 57:12.780
would become a platform in all it would be necessary in the future would be to

57:12.780 --> 57:19.180
swap in a new RNA sequence okay now we agreed totally with that we've

57:19.180 --> 57:23.820
watched lots of videos and we've asserted that since about the end of 2020

57:23.820 --> 57:26.700
before they even rolled it out we were already asserting that that was going

57:26.700 --> 57:31.820
to be the case when we were using Bill Gates to make that argument now what we

57:31.820 --> 57:37.100
need to resolve no it's not wow it's a vaccine platform technology no no no

57:37.100 --> 57:40.900
it's always been that way we've been saying that for years no there was a

57:40.900 --> 57:46.740
video by Vox already in 2020 which was a cartoon which basically said that

57:46.740 --> 57:51.060
that since the vaccine is only just things that are found in your body

57:51.060 --> 57:56.100
including lip fats and sugars and nucleic acids all they have to do is

57:56.100 --> 57:59.540
swap one of those legos out and you have a new vaccine without having to go

57:59.540 --> 58:03.940
through all this trouble of all this regulatory shit

58:03.940 --> 58:08.500
controversy regarding the toxicities associated with this because we now

58:08.500 --> 58:13.140
clearly know that these are neither safe nor effective we knew at the time

58:13.140 --> 58:17.300
Pfizer knew at the time these products would not prevent infection

58:17.300 --> 58:21.700
they would not prevent replication and spread of the virus now the data is

58:21.700 --> 58:26.500
suggested they don't even augment they certainly don't protect against

58:26.500 --> 58:31.540
death or permit do you even doubt for one second

58:31.620 --> 58:36.180
that he's using the word augment because of us

58:37.940 --> 58:43.140
do you even doubt for one second that that because of our fighting not ours

58:43.140 --> 58:48.740
like me and you and but our side how well we were on the biology that

58:48.740 --> 58:54.020
they're talking about I mean all of this stuff might not have been on

58:54.020 --> 58:58.260
even in the narrative had we not been pushing so consistently for three years

58:58.260 --> 59:04.020
so kudos to all of you who doubted this long enough for this

59:04.020 --> 59:07.940
to get where it is where these people are so off script that they basically

59:07.940 --> 59:12.900
almost have to say it all out loud except for Denny Rancor's data shows

59:12.900 --> 59:15.780
that there was no evidence of spread that's the only part

59:15.780 --> 59:19.380
that all of these people sitting there's just don't seem to be able to get their

59:19.380 --> 59:22.820
tiny heads around everything else is fantastic Denny's a

59:22.820 --> 59:25.940
really nice guy and he found the 17 million people were

59:25.940 --> 59:29.940
killed by the shot we love that finding but this other thing I keep

59:29.940 --> 59:34.820
it's keep slipping my mind I keep forgetting to tweet it

59:37.060 --> 59:41.860
bent against death and disease we all know that but that was what was

59:41.860 --> 59:46.820
asserted at the time and what we need to resolve all the controversy

59:46.820 --> 59:51.540
that swirls around these products and whatever the latest data disclosure is

59:51.700 --> 59:55.460
for governments to just be open and transparent that's like

59:55.460 --> 01:00:00.020
your message all I'm asking for is that we be

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:05.220
allowed to access in open and transparent fashion

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:12.020
the data which NHS and the health care agencies of the world

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:16.340
have acquired so that those data can be analyzed

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:21.060
so we no longer have to wrestle over whether this data is good or that data

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:26.020
has this law etc etc let's all disclose in an open and

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.820
transparent way so that the world scientists can evaluate that data

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.020
and put to rest this controversy about whether or not these products are

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:38.580
saying effective not running out of time the current data

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:44.260
of somewhere between 700 and a thousand peer reviewed studies

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.020
regarding the safety or lack thereof of these products

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.220
clearly demonstrate a series of adverse events

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.620
I'm just going to list myocarditis including tachycardia

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.460
reproductive health damage when all of the world know about the damage to

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.900
their menstrual cycles that's now these are all things that are

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.540
widely acknowledged peer reviewed multiple hundreds of studies

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.460
reproductive health quite a lot of the including stroke that means blood

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.940
clotting of normal blood clotting damage to peripheral

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.660
ocular and central nervous systems including stroke

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:25.540
immunologic and oncologic harms which Dr. Cole is going to be speaking about

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:32.180
and the biggest adverse event of all death so in conclusion what we've had

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:36.340
here is a rushed product a rushed technology

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:42.500
a failure to provide and respect for humans

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.580
in not allowing them to have informed consent

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.700
and furthermore actively deploying the most massive propaganda campaign

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.980
in the history of the modern world to suppress

01:01:54.980 --> 01:02:00.340
the ability of the public to gain access merely to have the knowledge

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.140
of what the adverse event risks are and I come to you

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.020
with one request open the books let's see the data

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:14.420
and let's allow those data to be examined so we no longer have to have

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.980
this you know these little fights over these little details

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.180
we can actually get to the bottom of one of the most important questions

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.700
the world is facing right now where these products actually save the

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.420
benefit thank you for your time sorry for that

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.460
damn that was hot

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:39.460
my read i'm Dr. Cole's body language is something like jet lag

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:45.220
i don't know uh i don't know uh i have a meeting with him i think this

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.100
week at some point i'm excited about that um so

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.900
that's that's what i wanted to show you um that's all i've got from that one i'm

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.260
going to try and find the other ones and take a look at them and see

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.580
um and see what i can find in there but i wasn't going to waste

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:06.660
too much show time on that right away um so this video that we just watched

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:10.340
starts with Malone talking about the um maybe

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.900
i'll put my head bigger um talks about Malone

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.220
and um i'm sorry goes to Malone first

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.580
and he says that the products are contaminated and he talks about the

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.420
DNA fragmentation contamination as a risk

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.340
um and so we knew that that variable was already in there we knew that that

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.300
was already going to be something that they wanted to talk about

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:37.460
then um geez i look like a mess i'm sorry i just came in from

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:42.500
basketball so i just um Kirsch then came on and was completely

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.100
focused on the vaccines and i think that's really important to note

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:53.140
so Kirsch was very focused on the vaccines as a bad intervention and then

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.140
right away pivoted to the censorship and the not allowing people to talk about

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.100
stuff and cover up and so very much completely sidestepped the question

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:09.460
of the dangerousness of the virus the the value of natural immunity previous

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.100
existing coronavirus immunity a background signal that's been conflated

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.900
all of this stuff is just nice and deftly avoided by starting with and

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.340
ending with vaccine and censorship um then Corey came on which was pretty

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.540
cool and Dr. Corey actually talked about disinformation

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:31.540
from pharma being something that he was familiar with his whole career

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:37.380
and then um i wrote down here sticks and stones may break my bones because

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.140
he was complaining about all the names that he gets called on the internet

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.500
um ivermectin campaign then right so then he

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.020
exclusively talked about how the trials including the ones that were running

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:53.540
the uk were designed to get bad results for ivermectin and make it my vermectin

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.300
looked bad and so of course that's why he wrote a book about ivermectin and

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.780
tours the world specifically focused on ivermectin because that is

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:06.980
really his part of the train um and then

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.660
david martin came on i don't know why that's taken so long i guess they had a lot

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.100
more they had a lot more talking to do it's just

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.380
playing then david martin came on he started with the

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:23.940
2002 patent for infectious replication incompetent clones

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:27.380
which um here's steve curse with the suit that's too big for him

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.700
um i'm only making fun of him because i know what that looks like i always

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.020
have suits that are too big for me because like unless i get them fitted then

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.140
they're always like a little wider on the shoulder than they should be and i'm

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.900
like from the 80s when we used to have a little pad in there it was at the 90s

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.420
but we used to have a little shoulder pad in there i bet steve curse like that too

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.020
he's probably got one in there right now um

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.260
so he's vaccine focused bad intervention and censorship

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.220
um and then uh kori comes on disinformation ivermectin and i'm sorry

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.980
martin so he started with this 2002 patent thing

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.940
and he talks about infectious replication incompetent clones now

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:12.420
the reason why that's really interesting to me is because a replication

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:17.540
incompetent clone is exactly what you would use to see the pandemic

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:24.020
exactly what you would use to put in these places where you wanted the

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:29.060
the signal of the molecular biological sequence that you're calling the virus

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:34.180
you wanted that sequence to be very easily found

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.700
then the way you would do it is with a infectious replication incompetent

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.700
clone and anybody that had been hit with that clone

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.860
would have a high quantity of this RNA in their system

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:55.540
because it's infectious it will make protein but it's replication

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.220
incompetent so it can't assemble its genome into new

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:03.540
competent variants which is really an interesting thing to say

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:10.340
because we've already talked about how large of a proportion potentially

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:15.540
of a viral swarm is replication incompetent particles in fact we've

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.620
heard robert melon say on videos that the vast majority of those

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.420
particles are replication incompetent so a

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:26.500
infectious replication incompetent clone is actually

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.300
maybe a pretty apt description of what you would expect to get if you took the

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:36.500
RNA sequence best guess from a sample in nature made it up using recombinant

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.060
DNA and then it didn't really make replication competent particles

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.740
that's what you'd call it and if you looked in there you could find s

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:48.340
protein and n protein and m protein and you could find

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.220
exosomes that had some of these proteins on them

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.460
and so yes there are things being made and stuffs happening and cells are

01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:02.420
are blubbing maybe dying maybe cytotoxic effects are visible

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.740
but it's replication incompetent it's the perfect

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:12.580
perfect seeding event it's a weapon but it's a weapon that might make people

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.140
sick might not but what it will do for sure

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:21.380
is it will make that that RNA in sufficient quantity and sufficient

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:26.020
purity so that when you use RTPCR to find it

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.060
you get an answer like Sohomich county man

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:35.620
whose data can then be very conveniently used for 3d models

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:40.020
for local vaccines it can even be sent up to absolera and used

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:44.020
for the his samples can even be sent up to absolera

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.020
and used for their antibody search with all these B cell

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.780
in microfluidics

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.140
and that's indeed what happened according to

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:59.540
the article that Marcus archived and read today

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:07.860
so as we keep digging and recycling and rereading and reconnecting things on

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:12.340
our three-dimensional map in our brains we start to understand that all of

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.100
these people have to know more about it than they say they know

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:19.860
all of these people have been in too close of proximity during their previous

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.900
careers for them not to know all of them have been

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.540
in too close of proximity from 2020 until now

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:31.460
they've been at too many of these events they've flown to too many foreign

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.900
countries together they've eaten at too many breakfasts they've

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:39.060
sat in too many hot tubs and they've taken too many pictures of their damn

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.460
shoes

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.900
so he says that the patents and then the model of coronavirus has been

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:52.020
manipulated so it's like he's almost saying it it's

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.620
exactly like what we saw with Alex Zek's video

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.060
where he's almost explaining it but he's not explaining it

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.980
I really can't explain it out loud because I'm stuck in a legal paradigm

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:07.060
and I have to talk in legal terms so otherwise I can't really explain what

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.820
an infectious clone means but very simply an infectious clone

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:16.180
means that they can put any sequence of RNA anywhere they want to

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.100
it might make viral proteins and make people sick but more importantly it will

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:23.140
be findable

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.060
and findables all you need from the perspective of trying to see the

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.780
pandemic narrative so if this really was a national security event

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:36.100
designed to make people think that there was a coronavirus just like

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.940
Martin said the model of coronavirus has been

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:45.220
hijacked or used for this the model of coronavirus is that we can find

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:48.900
them around the world using sequencing

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.460
so if you're going to use this model as a weapon

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.220
you're going to put these sequences in people and claim that they're findable

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.980
then you're going to use other methodologies that you're going to say are

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.860
equivalent that actually just map on the background

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.380
and throw everybody for a loop

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:10.900
that's how they did it it's so blatantly obvious

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:25.780
it's so blatantly obvious that this scenario any of these three scenarios

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.380
is just not what happened because RNA can't do that the only way you could

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:33.220
get this kind of fidelity is if it was already there in the background

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.580
and the only way you could get this kind of fidelity from local sequencing

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:42.100
across the world at the same time is if you use clones to get it there

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:46.100
there's no other way because if I had the virus in my

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.340
house and it skipped to the the neighbor's house it would

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.340
already be very much different than it was in our house not the same

01:11:52.340 --> 01:12:01.540
variant not one amino acid d d 614 g come on humanoids

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:07.060
it's time to rise up these people have told us a mythological

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:12.180
bedtime story forced us to stay at home and listen to it over and over and

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.500
over again that doesn't make it true it makes it a

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.500
faith a faith in a novel virus where we've defeated

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.340
disease and epidemics in the past using vaccination which we now I think most

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:29.140
of us have really realized that's a grossly exaggerated

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.340
simplified version of history novel coronaviruses can jump from other

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:42.740
species and can pandemic is a mythology they cannot pandemic

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.500
false positives are not rare

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:54.980
positives are not rare you see false positives

01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:01.620
are not rare and positives are not rare that's the

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.260
background virus if there is a background signal

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.580
and your PCR works fairly well then there aren't a lot of

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:15.460
false positives but there are a lot of positives

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.860
asymptomatic spread is not real asymptomatic spread is that background

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.500
signal that you expect to be there we should have expected it to be there

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.940
from 2020 more people should have done known better

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.020
variants are evidence of spread and continuing evolution of a single

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:40.260
SARS virus is absurd and since we have absolutely

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:44.660
zero data about any circulating coronavirus with any fidelity at all before

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:49.860
2020 we can't claim this fidelity now

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.060
well we do spend money on gain of function research but nothing ever

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.780
happens there

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.620
we've got to free our cell oh I miss the train we've got to free ourselves from

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:08.340
this this cosmic train here we've got to free ourselves from this illusion

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:12.020
because if this train pulls out of the station with our kids in it

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:18.420
okay if this faith in a novel virus is a train that our kids get on

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.500
while they're playing fortnite and roadblocks and call of duty

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:30.820
if them and their friends because of their parents friends parents parents

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.380
or whatever get on this train and start to believe that well the pandemic did

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.140
happen it probably was a lab leak and it's definitely going to happen again

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:45.380
I mean listen to Robert Malone listen to Pierre Corey listen to Ryan Cole

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:49.460
listen to uh Peter McCullough it's going to happen again

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:53.220
because this was a gain of function virus this had a dangerous spike protein

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.860
that they manipulated with all kinds of new things in it

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:01.140
like a Swiss army knife if our children get on this train they're never coming

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:06.260
back humanity's never going to come back

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.740
that's why we've got to call it a lie like really what it is not a

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:17.060
it's not a misnomer or a you know it's not a misleading story or an

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.340
exaggeration it's a lie

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.020
and the lie is being told because we are at a time point where human diversity

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:30.180
is at a peak for all time there will never be this many people with this

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:34.100
many genomes this many potential babies again

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.060
now you can look at it in a couple different ways i'm going to give you a

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.700
couple different angles because i don't want you to think that i think i

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.820
haven't figured out there's a couple different angles the first one is

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:49.700
is that they realize that the multiracial

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:57.060
multicultural multi ethnic western society people like me

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.500
people like Mark Koolack who genetically are so far from perium i

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:09.780
will call us a milkshake or uh or a um uh i don't know what are we

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:13.940
well i'm a mix right i'm a very big mix of things because my father's a big mix

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:18.260
and my mom is actually a mix i mean this the short story is my mom's

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.780
Filipino but that's actually that's actually wrong she's only half

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.500
Filipino her father was from india very dark indian man

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.780
that's the reason why two generations later i'm still

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.740
dark and my daughter got it my boys didn't get it

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.340
unfortunately but my daughter's almost darker than me

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:43.860
and that that mixture that unique genetic background

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.940
from an immunological perspective is actually a

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:52.500
that doesn't help them at all what they learn about my immune system from my

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:56.500
genes actually will be relatively useless for someone that doesn't have my

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.420
background or something very similar to it which is not hard

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.060
not easy to find. Mark Koolack might have the same varied

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.540
background where in the end the assembly of genes that is

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:13.780
Mark Koolack in some ways is extremely useful because it's such a beautiful

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.540
and unique example of of what that pattern integrity

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:24.740
can result in but then how does that data set how could that data set have

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.540
been fed into a general database in order to

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.020
enrich it to understand the expression of the human genome i don't think it

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:37.540
really well it could like i said i'm trying to display

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.660
or i'm trying to give you two different sides of it you can see that

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:44.340
diversity is being very valuable to these people

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:52.260
or or you could see that they think very reductionist still

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:57.300
and that they think that you know like we made progress in mice and like we

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.540
make progress in some monkeys we're going to need to make progress in

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.660
humans that's more like that and so in order to do that we need to

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.780
make progress medically and understanding

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:14.100
humans that are more genetically homologous

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:19.940
and homogenous so that the results that we get will bring

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.060
will bring the signal out of the noise

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:27.220
because if the if the variation in the genetic diversity of the united states

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.140
here well i'm not a weatherman if the genetic diversity in the united states

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:36.020
here for example is so great that you would need

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.780
let's say five billion of those people in order to

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.260
average out all of the variation whereas

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:49.780
in in china the genetic variation is lower and so you actually

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.980
would need less of those people as medical subjects to get to any

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.380
reasonable statistical conclusion now i'm not saying these statistical

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.500
conclusions are right i'm not saying the reductionist biology is a great idea

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:06.180
i'm not saying it i'm just trying to suggest

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.660
that you can think about how this time point

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:16.100
and it's it's the truth of this time point could be leveraged

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:20.500
from their perspective they've got about

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:24.260
the the generation after our own so they've got my kids

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.620
kids and then after that this is all going to go down right

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:32.340
this maybe even already with my kids kids it's going to go down

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.340
and so they need those babies to sign up or do they

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:41.300
or do they just want these babies or just just these babies

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:45.460
or just these babies down here or just these babies in iceland

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:49.060
or you know whatever i don't i don't know what their plan is

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:52.260
but i assure you that these are the issues that they've thought about these

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:56.340
are the things that are motivating them because as we

01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:02.820
move forward to this smaller population that's inevitably going to come

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:08.980
and as we because of the resources that are being necessarily shrank on purpose

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:12.820
population is going to go down they're encouraging our kids not to have

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.340
babies they're trying to make having babies seem like all it's impossible

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.060
if you can't buy a car how can you have kids

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.020
it's extraordinary

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.540
but i assure you that this is at the center

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.500
the biological truth of the matter is that there will never be more

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.580
humans available for experimentation and genetically genetic diversity

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.580
available again this is this generation or the next one

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:45.860
is the last chance for them to invert our sovereignty

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:52.020
into permissions in order to access and archive as much of this data as

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.940
possible waiting another generation will essentially

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:59.620
miss this window and potentially miss it forever because again

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.620
this mythology has been put in place over many

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:09.140
many years or even decades and once it starts to collapse it's not going to

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.740
just kind of sit there it's going to collapse

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:16.740
and so if they don't get us over this get our kids onto the train and the

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:20.580
train out of the station in the next five years it'll never get out of the

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.060
station that's why i think that's such a

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:29.540
an apt um cartoon to end with because i do really think all we have to do is

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:33.220
keep our kids off the train and we might be all right

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:37.300
the question is how many you know can we wake up and keep them off the train

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:41.460
because if the vast majority of humankind gets on that train then

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.380
living on earth will be a very very uh terrible

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:50.020
terrible thing relative to what we experienced when we were kids you know i

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.900
i was all about

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:58.260
you know class rings and and letterman's jackets and

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:03.380
and dances and my son is uh my sons are not

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:08.420
it doesn't feel like they're growing up in that world anymore and

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:12.740
and their concerns are a lot more

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:17.540
incongruent with what i think their life should be about

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.940
so let's get our act together ladies and gentlemen

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:24.020
the book came out today this book is now available on amazon please buy a

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.380
copy because i'm in it in lots of places and it's probably going to ruin my life

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.060
but that's all right um if you want to see just a

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:37.540
little something something here not me bragging i'm just showing you how

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:41.060
the the stuff is actually going to hit the fan here

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:45.940
um wonder if i can do this does this work

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:54.260
yep uh so what what what what i do check this out so

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.660
this book would not have been possible without the expertise and invaluable

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:04.660
insights provided by jonathan jay cooey phd that's pretty

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:11.220
it might just be accidental um but that's uh that's pretty dope

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:16.180
um and let's see if we look back here in the indexy

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:23.540
dixie you can see that uh your your favorite

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:30.100
mentally ill biologist is here and i've got several numbers which seem to

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.180
curiously overlap with the coronavirus sections

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:42.580
so um hopefully we won't get ignored and uh just to make sure you know that

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.060
i wasn't telling a fib the other night on page 441

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:52.500
you can see here um as jonathan jay or jonathan cooey said no

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.700
actual virus would even be necessary so

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.940
it's all in there is more or less in there you know the clones are in there

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:04.740
um they might be imperfect but they're in there uh and if you put it

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:09.060
put all my parts and all my quotes together it's actually not such a bad

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:14.420
contribution to the book so let's see if we did everything we wanted to do here

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.780
i do have a sore throat i'm not i don't think i'm getting another

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.460
nodule or something like that i have a sore throat i it's it's something else

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:26.900
oh yeah martin brought up the model for pathogen control

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.220
and uh also said that the rockefeller foundation and the welcome trust were

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.380
involved in this which i thought was neat and then melone came back and he said

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:40.500
he's not a conspiracy theorist everybody went through a major trauma

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.860
which is of course what they wanted us to do that i should really have maridith

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:48.100
miller back on after a year or so of not seeing her and talking to her she was

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:52.180
really good at explaining how they did it and what they actually did which

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.780
was make us go through a trauma um and then

01:24:55.780 --> 01:25:02.180
he really ended with or started his his comments to uh parliament with this

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:08.020
rapid response need um and a is a really valid concern and that's

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.660
also actually the story that he told when he was on bobby's podcast with me

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:17.060
he used 40 minutes to say that this warm base of manufacturing was necessary

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:22.740
in order to respond to a bioterrorism threat um so it's very very very curious

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:28.980
um very very very curious uh but you know we'll see

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.420
please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:36.740
the control group by any means necessary um intramuscular injection of any

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:41.060
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.700
is dumb transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.940
viruses are not patterned integrity so i think um these are the way

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.380
right now at least this is my best compass for the way forward

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:57.220
i'm just going to try and talk to people about this over the next few weeks and

01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:03.220
see if i can get more um yeah just get get more succinct in my

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:06.740
presentation of it so just to make sure everybody knows

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:12.820
at three o'clock eastern time on thursday which is not tomorrow

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:17.540
because tomorrow is wednesday right i'm getting really confused because michael

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:20.820
palmer asked me if i was going to speak tomorrow no it's really

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:26.180
tuesday and so thursday i'm going to be speaking to the doctors for covid

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.180
ethics which is the other group um there's medical doctors for covid

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.460
ethics international and i've spoken to them a few times and doctors for

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.980
covid ethics is the other one um and that that was

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:41.220
originally one group that split into two so i was also a member of that an

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.860
attending member of that group and at some point it just got to be too

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.420
many meetings and i kind of dropped out of that one

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.420
um but they put together um michael palmer

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:57.860
uh sukred bakti and uh a couple fell uh a fellow from uh chd

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:03.220
and brian hooker wrote a um i apologize margo i don't remember your last name

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:06.260
but um wrote this book about the mr and a

01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.860
transfection i think it's a pretty decent book and that was from this group

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.420
and so i will be speaking to that group on thursday afternoon at three o'clock

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.300
so my stream will be at three o'clock on thursday

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:21.380
um and i don't have the slides done yet but i am

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.980
preparing a new slide deck and i'm going to use it for that one and it's going to

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:29.300
be basically a 30 000 foot view of what we've been talking about but i'm going

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.460
to say things that i haven't said on stream yet it's going to be

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.580
unless i get it done early and then maybe i'll practice on you tomorrow

01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.860
night but um thursday doctors for covid

01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:44.260
ethics uh and um i don't know we'll see what else is

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.860
coming up i have a lot of offers for people to come on the stream and talk

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.700
but uh it's hard for me to schedule those things with basketball and everything

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.780
so i'm just kind of trying to chill um things are going to ramp up pretty

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.580
quick though and so um you see that i'm starting to put

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:02.580
shorts on twitter um i'm going to also start posting them

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:06.340
on the soapbox but right now i'm still getting a lot more bites

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:09.700
on twitter and it's easier for me right there it's only

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:14.740
easier though teds who don't get mad um i'm gonna be on soapbox too

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:19.140
and i want everybody to eventually go there um but for now a lot of the

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:23.060
shenanigans still take place on twitter so i'm trying my best

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.340
to kind of gaze in the water just a little bit just to see what's there to

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:29.460
make sure that these people are still meddling in the way that i expect

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.340
them to and then i kind of just ignore them

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.700
um because they will do what they will do right and we've got things that we've

01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.540
got to do and so that's what we're doing um thank you very much for joining me

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.820
and i will see you again tomorrow

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:15.700
so

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.980
honey and vinegar says bamela honey and vinegar

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:34.740
thank you very much guys i really appreciate everything and

01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:38.020
this is from you pamela this one of those it was in the bag

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:42.340
uh it works really well for basketball because it's light

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:46.420
it's orange which is one of the colors of the school so it kind of makes me

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:50.260
look like i bought it on purpose so thank you very much i'll see you guys

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:59.620
again tomorrow thanks thanks thanks
