WEBVTT

01:00.203 --> 01:13.734
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

01:13.874 --> 01:20.940
I don't know crash the dollar I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value we have left.

01:21.140 --> 01:24.183
I don't know But I know for sure

01:24.588 --> 01:42.013
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

01:44.151 --> 01:50.896
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:51.316 --> 01:54.359
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:54.439 --> 02:03.886
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:03.926 --> 02:10.511
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:17.363 --> 02:17.689
Thank you.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.273
inside mine.

03:01.694 --> 03:04.754
Things look so bad every way.

03:05.454 --> 03:09.735
In this whole world, what is fair?

03:11.436 --> 03:16.116
We walk blind, we try to see.

03:16.277 --> 03:18.917
Falling behind in what could be.

03:19.037 --> 03:24.538
Bring me a higher love.

03:25.698 --> 03:28.199
Bring me a higher love.

04:45.572 --> 04:46.453
too late.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.442
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

07:02.563 --> 07:07.247
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:08.683 --> 07:10.453
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

07:12.002 --> 07:12.747
It's embarrassing.

07:42.079 --> 07:43.420
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:44.361 --> 07:45.241
Welcome to the show.

07:45.261 --> 07:54.348
This is Gigome Biological, where your consciousness is the prime real estate that these people are trying to compete for.

07:55.669 --> 08:00.792
I've started to see it a little bit like that, that these charlatans, it doesn't have, you don't have to give your

08:01.806 --> 08:08.155
You don't have to relinquish your power and responsibility over to any one charlatan.

08:08.195 --> 08:13.162
You just have to agree to give it over to one of many charlatans.

08:14.175 --> 08:25.807
And it doesn't matter whether you choose from the gray, or you choose from the blue, or you choose from the red, or you choose from the rainbow, you're always choosing from one of their charlatans.

08:25.907 --> 08:31.472
And so as long as each of these people can keep a few hundred thousand people occupied,

08:32.273 --> 08:34.717
you can start to see how we are being governed.

08:34.757 --> 08:47.254
Ladies and gentlemen, Gigaohm Biological is a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist and its name is derived from patch clamp physiology where a gigaohm resistance seal

08:47.995 --> 08:54.781
is used to make high resistance, low noise recordings from individual or combinations of neurons.

08:54.861 --> 08:58.244
And I made a living for quite a while with this one technique.

08:58.865 --> 09:09.174
And a lot of my work on the National Library of Medicine is based on my use and employment of this technique and trying to figure out how little neuronal circuits might work.

09:10.055 --> 09:25.975
And in the last four and a half to five years, I have become a staunch advocate for the pausing of the vaccine schedule in America based on the idea that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

09:26.536 --> 09:31.440
The transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and that's transformation as well.

09:31.940 --> 09:35.823
And all of these academic biologists that I used to work with should have known better.

09:36.304 --> 09:38.265
And in fact, RNA cannot pandemic.

09:38.285 --> 09:41.068
We don't have any biology to support this notion.

09:41.568 --> 09:52.797
Viruses are not pattern integrities, whereas things that we consider alive, like mosquitoes and ourselves, are indeed pattern integrities of the most complex order.

09:54.181 --> 10:02.708
And so they have used our lack of biological knowledge to misconstrue our excess deaths with a mystery virus.

10:03.449 --> 10:10.075
And they've done it by showing us bad graphs, instead of showing us all cause mortality, they just showed us a graph starting from zero.

10:10.735 --> 10:18.522
But more importantly, they have distorted this mystery virus, they have mis-contorted, misconstrued the,

10:20.413 --> 10:36.176
The result of bad protocols and bad ideas like supplementary oxygen and pulse oximeters to indicate the presence of a virus when in reality there's no epidemiological evidence of the spread of that biological phenomenon.

10:37.438 --> 10:41.701
And there are no lawyers arguing for strict liability on all pharmaceutical products.

10:41.741 --> 10:52.048
There are no lawyers arguing that the PrEP Act and these other long list of legislation violates our basic Seventh Amendment right to sue for damages.

10:52.509 --> 10:56.792
Nobody's saying this because, of course, these are all parts of the trap.

10:57.512 --> 11:07.155
wherein they will use murder and lies to hide that trap, murder and lies to hide that trap, so that our kids are willingly caught in it.

11:07.615 --> 11:20.539
Essentially because we don't come to a new consensus that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, that the vaccine schedule in America is a particularly nasty criminal enterprise, and that RNA cannot pandemic.

11:20.979 --> 11:23.540
That's what they don't want us to teach our children.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.481
That's why these people have been

11:26.261 --> 11:41.030
intricately involved in a dance where an illusion of consensus was created by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate about whether we need to fear free-range RNA molecules or free-range RNA viruses or whether there are no viruses at all.

11:41.411 --> 11:45.513
It doesn't really matter as long as you do it with a disingenuous

11:46.894 --> 11:49.615
You know, you don't ever come to any conclusions.

11:49.655 --> 11:52.356
You just have these wonderful ideas.

11:52.917 --> 11:56.298
And these wonderful ideas end up trapping people on social media.

11:56.338 --> 12:04.522
You get in the social media chair, you grab the joystick, you push the pedals, you put on the goggles, and you think you're going to fight against the people over here.

12:05.142 --> 12:09.504
You think you're going to fight against the people over here by engaging with the people over here.

12:09.544 --> 12:11.845
And in reality, this is just one big show.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.507
And it doesn't matter who you engage with, because none of these people are going to

12:16.147 --> 12:41.360
actually talk about the truth and four and a half years later the truth has been available for quite some time and the people that know it have all interacted with me directly on streams and on interviews and in private meetings like this the steering committee of steve kirsch and it's all just one big show it's all one big show that was described by aldous huxley very succinctly long long ago

12:42.449 --> 12:45.536
And most or all of these people are involved in this show.

12:46.799 --> 12:52.031
And what you can see them as essentially are the acolytes of the elite.

12:52.799 --> 12:55.961
They are the ruling oligarchy's highly trained acolytes.

12:56.021 --> 12:59.323
These people are all auditioning to be part of Fauci's show.

12:59.804 --> 13:03.066
They're all auditioning to be part of the governing elite.

13:03.766 --> 13:11.091
And you can see them for the truth, or you can see them as social media would like you to see them, as Jikki Leaks would like you to see them.

13:11.131 --> 13:12.973
But if you see them for the truth that they are,

13:13.473 --> 13:24.036
They're part of all one big theater, one big national security operation, which was essentially foisted on us by private piles of money.

13:24.096 --> 13:39.041
And these private piles of money, of course, are the private public partnership between the national biosecurity state and these weaponized piles of money that, of course, include the publicly discussed and often misaligned Peter Thiel and

13:40.661 --> 14:05.339
and Palantir and Blackrock but they also involve piles of money that are much bigger and much less often named and the reality is is that if we want to get out we're going to have to get off social media we're going to have to get on to decentralized forms of social media and stop playing their game by chasing their bad guys or following their mysteries or solving their puzzles or for that matter just you know

14:05.879 --> 14:13.442
following their heroes, because none of these people that rode in on white horses four and a half years ago have turned out to be good guys.

14:13.842 --> 14:15.663
And in fact, hello, welcome to the show.

14:15.703 --> 14:16.964
This is Giga Home Biological.

14:17.004 --> 14:21.385
My name is Jonathan Couey, coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.626
That's the backyard that you hear.

14:23.606 --> 14:38.589
We are still fighting against this same illusion of consensus that all of us got sucked into in 2020, and it's going to continue to be the thing that we fight against daily, even if sometimes we just can't keep naming names and telling the story over and over again.

14:39.069 --> 14:48.131
It's important to always remember anybody that should happen, remind everybody, and remind anyone who should happen to stumble upon the stream that indeed this is where we are at.

14:48.231 --> 14:50.452
We are in a place

14:51.472 --> 15:14.130
Not unlike being on the set of the Starship Enterprise and having people in costume walk in and stay in character, we have engaged in social media in such a way and these people have stayed in character in such a way that we have been led to believe that we are essentially being saved by people like, oh, there's Robert Malone walking in.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.451
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

15:17.228 --> 15:30.534
And just like Captain Kirk coming in right now on that stream, on that screen, it's no more like, phew, that Jessica Rose or Jessica Hockett or Jonathan Engler or any of these other people showed up.

15:31.635 --> 15:39.719
The university organizations like HEART are nothing more than part of this international national security exercise where

15:40.439 --> 15:48.243
We are being coerced into teaching our children a mythology that will enslave them forever, essentially convert them to...

15:50.655 --> 15:53.917
experimental animals, and they want us to do it for them.

15:53.957 --> 15:56.379
They want us to willingly hand our kids over.

15:57.179 --> 16:16.151
And that's why you see, for example, right now, the illusion of consensus that they've created about a laboratory or a bat cave zoonosis or a gain-of-function virus or an incapacitating agent or a gain-of-function spike protein or an amyloid-generating spike protein or a prion weapon.

16:17.211 --> 16:35.166
All of this illusion of consensus has essentially resulted that in 2024, Kevin McKernan is the exact same as Charles Rixey, that George Webb is exactly the same as Jessica Rose, that essentially Robert Malone is the same as Claire Craig.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.169
They all believe in the same things.

16:39.209 --> 16:43.453
They all want us to teach our children the exact same thing.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.382
that the mRNA is not a screwed up technology.

16:47.402 --> 16:53.667
It was a screwed up rollout that we rushed it, that we didn't know what we were doing, that they were covering up a gain of function lab leak.

16:53.727 --> 16:54.527
And they all agree.

16:56.009 --> 17:01.633
People that used to be opposed, that used to be arguing about one thing or another have all come to agree.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.574
Robert Malone's a good guy.

17:03.614 --> 17:04.915
Kevin McKernan's a good guy.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.416
Jessica Rose is a good guy.

17:07.617 --> 17:09.939
You know, all of these people are just good guys.

17:11.499 --> 17:21.392
And we're at the stage now where apparently Dr. Jane Ruby's not really a doctor, and Robert Malone told you so, and the theater goes on.

17:22.052 --> 17:24.135
The theater goes on.

17:37.827 --> 17:39.568
And the theater will continue to go on.

17:40.589 --> 17:46.513
It won't matter how many cancelled mice there are scurrying around under the table.

17:46.574 --> 17:53.118
It won't matter how many of these people that have been lying from the very beginning and misrepresenting their intentions from the very beginning.

17:53.138 --> 17:53.759
It doesn't matter.

17:54.349 --> 17:55.790
how they double back now.

17:56.510 --> 18:07.598
You can pay attention to them all you want on that platform X. It's a militarized platform and these people that live in other countries should just mind their own business and fix their own country.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.320
Some of these mice are from places like France.

18:11.980 --> 18:12.201
I mean,

18:13.201 --> 18:13.681
France.

18:14.321 --> 18:29.587
How can you be from a country so screwed up as France and then spend your time meddling in American affairs, meddling on American social media, pretending to organize with people from Australia who don't have their name on the internet.

18:29.967 --> 18:36.710
It actually becomes kind of comical when you see how ridiculous it is that these people can't have real lives.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.491
These people don't have children that they're fighting for.

18:39.551 --> 18:40.471
These people don't have

18:40.991 --> 18:53.914
a community that they are trying to interact with they are exclusively engaged on x on the town square of elon musk and once you see it for the ludicrous

18:55.390 --> 19:20.384
joke that it is than any of these accounts like canceled mouse or Jiki leaks, or, I mean, any of these accounts that have defended Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Pierre Corey as good guys from America are obviously meddlers that are actually in cooperation with them trying to undermine America as a united front that it could be.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.566
Once we realize that we have been meddled with,

19:24.611 --> 19:31.074
with cooperation from foreigners, which means that those people in America who are cooperating with these foreigners are traitors.

19:31.935 --> 19:37.678
And these people who are cooperating with foreigners from other countries are also traitors to their own countries.

19:38.530 --> 19:44.295
Because they're not doing anything meaningful to save the children of France or save the children from Australia.

19:44.675 --> 19:53.703
If they go on to American social media and defend people like Robert Malone, who are declared members of DITRA, have spoken in front of the WHO.

19:54.124 --> 20:01.270
I mean, how is it possible that in 2024, anybody takes an account like Jikki Leaks seriously anymore?

20:01.730 --> 20:06.975
How is it possible that anybody takes an account like Jonathan Engler seriously anymore?

20:07.516 --> 20:22.390
Or any of these other people that have purported to be fighting for freedom and for truth but have gotten nowhere in four years, have been saying that they've been listening to me but gotten nowhere in four years, still can't say clones or transfection

20:22.990 --> 20:26.595
or synthetic DNA or RNA or transformation.

20:27.035 --> 20:29.658
None of these terms can be used by Jikki Leaks.

20:29.718 --> 20:39.230
None of them are used by John Bodwin or Steve Kirsch or Robert Malone or Meryl Ness or Jessica Rose or Jessica Hockett, whatever account she's using now.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.755
They just scurry away like the little rodents that they are.

20:44.556 --> 20:57.784
As the sinking ship of their illusion goes deeper into the water, there's nowhere left for them to run other than to continue to make silly memes and make silly pictures with me and a shotgun in my mouth.

20:59.172 --> 21:07.936
That's all they can hope for is that I'll go away and stop showing how terrible it is that they still aren't fighting for our kids.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.177
They still aren't fighting for the truth.

21:10.657 --> 21:18.860
They are still fighting for hamster wheels and for the number of shooters and for the fact that there's truth out there.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.621
All we got to do is sort it out.

21:24.426 --> 21:25.546
Just ridiculous.

21:26.947 --> 21:27.887
It's ridiculous.

21:28.387 --> 21:33.888
So what I want to watch today is called Beyond Evolution, Unraveling the Origins of Life.

21:33.948 --> 21:38.609
It's actually a very recent broadcast by this Uncommon Knowledge from the Hoover Institute.

21:39.230 --> 21:47.311
And it's an interview between this guy from the Hoover Institute and these two dudes who I've seen on the internet for some time now.

21:48.252 --> 21:49.292
They never get cancelled.

21:50.014 --> 21:51.995
They are on YouTube all the time.

21:52.075 --> 21:53.516
They can be anywhere they want to.

21:53.556 --> 22:01.802
They're on lots of podcasts, not that dissimilar to how Bret Weinstein and Robert Malone actually never got canceled.

22:01.842 --> 22:09.167
Like there was some demonetization apparently, but ever after Robert Malone was able to go on lots of different podcasts.

22:09.207 --> 22:14.130
And if you go on YouTube and look, there are podcasts of Robert Malone from his back as early as 2021.

22:16.383 --> 22:18.764
So he's not really ever been canceled.

22:19.124 --> 22:23.027
It's just that the canceling of him was very public.

22:23.087 --> 22:29.010
He was allowed to go on Tucker Carlson and wave into the camera and say, hi, I'm the guy that got canceled by LinkedIn.

22:29.030 --> 22:39.815
And then everybody was announced to his presence, just like Bret Weinstein got a half a million dollar settlement and was able to go whine in front of the Senate about how he was canceled.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.717
And so his rise as a podcaster is like,

22:46.727 --> 23:01.378
It's not for any other reason than the system itself promoted his wine and promoted it for years and other people agreed to promote it like, like Joe Rogan and like Peter Thiel and Spotify and Elon Musk.

23:04.941 --> 23:08.744
And so these guys are also able to participate in this

23:10.612 --> 23:20.175
YouTube experience thing and be all over the internet and say all these controversial things, but apparently YouTube has no problem with what they're saying.

23:20.255 --> 23:23.976
So I think what we're going to find here is very interesting.

23:24.056 --> 23:26.397
It's going to be very stimulating at times.

23:26.877 --> 23:31.398
And you're, I'm also going to use it to try and illustrate the main problem and the main problem.

23:31.418 --> 23:33.339
I'm going to cut back to front here.

23:34.887 --> 23:44.552
The main problem, and understand this, it's taken me a while to get to the point where I can say it as succinctly as I'm going to try and say it in the next few weeks.

23:47.653 --> 23:53.216
But the main problem is that we're not engaging in the escape route in the right way.

23:53.296 --> 23:56.538
We still have not engaged in the right way.

23:57.058 --> 23:58.359
And all of these people,

23:59.602 --> 24:13.847
All of these people from Robert Malone to Jessica Rose, to Kevin McCarron, to Kevin McKernan, to Charles Rixey, to Dr. Drew, to Kelly Victory, to Tucker Carlson and David Icke and all of these people, all of them, all of them, all of them.

24:15.748 --> 24:19.529
Kaufman and Cowan and all and the Bailey's and everybody.

24:20.663 --> 24:22.524
is they have all these great revelations.

24:22.564 --> 24:24.345
They have all these great things to say.

24:24.866 --> 24:29.108
They have all these, you know, gotcha points that these people are full of it.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.209
This people are full of it.

24:30.249 --> 24:31.970
Those people don't know what they're talking about.

24:32.470 --> 24:46.298
But then what happens uniformly across all of these people that are able to remain on social media is that they never come to any logical conclusion about what would a normal person do in this scenario?

24:46.338 --> 24:49.140
And I want to give you an example of this before we go on.

24:50.495 --> 24:55.236
If you were driving a car and somebody told you that, hey, guess what?

24:55.296 --> 24:56.496
You're not actually driving.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.477
You're turning the wheel.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.097
You think you're turning the wheel, but you're not driving.

25:00.337 --> 25:01.377
I'm actually driving.

25:01.457 --> 25:07.419
And then they took out from their seat, a little remote control, and they showed you that they were driving the car.

25:11.340 --> 25:15.241
Now, what would the next conclusion be then?

25:15.461 --> 25:17.001
What would the next thing to do be?

25:18.547 --> 25:21.488
The next thing would be, I guess I don't have to hold onto the steering wheel anymore.

25:21.508 --> 25:24.308
I guess I don't have to worry about where we're going since you're doing it.

25:27.089 --> 25:43.832
That's a very rudimentary example of what I'm trying to say, but the logical conclusion would be once the passenger demonstrated that the remote control that they were holding was actually controlling the car, you would stop doing the wheel, right?

25:43.872 --> 25:45.213
You would stop pushing the pedal.

25:45.233 --> 25:46.393
You would be like, well, wait, what?

25:49.153 --> 26:04.582
Now, when it comes to no virus, and I've pointed it out a lot, and then they always come back and say, no, no, we say it all the time, but they don't, is that if there are no viruses at all, then that means the entire vaccine schedule around the world is a scam.

26:05.122 --> 26:16.509
And not only is it a scam, but it's a scam that's obviously got to be poisoning people then, because we are intramuscularly injecting a combination of substances that includes recombinant proteins and toxins,

26:17.919 --> 26:19.634
in order to augment the immune system.

26:21.007 --> 26:30.633
And so these people have spent four years, four years blogging about, writing about, complaining about, making content about the fact that there are no viruses.

26:30.994 --> 26:35.176
They've even done experiments where they say, look, this experiment proves that there are no viruses.

26:35.637 --> 26:47.825
But then why don't every one of these papers end with a discussion section that says that means that health is stupid, allopathic medicine is stupid, that we have been poisoning our children.

26:48.225 --> 26:49.706
We are poisoning our children.

26:49.746 --> 26:50.847
We are poisoning, but they don't.

26:52.616 --> 26:54.426
And you can say that they do, but they don't.

26:56.206 --> 26:59.688
They are on podcasts for four years saying that there are no viruses.

26:59.788 --> 27:02.349
Specifically, I only want to talk about there's no viruses.

27:02.790 --> 27:13.816
Even when Kevin McCairn and Mark Bailey debated about these things, they agreed and they stuck very strictly to a very limited spectrum of debate.

27:14.236 --> 27:21.920
Whereas it could have easily been that Kevin McCairn said, hey man, vaccines have saved millions of lives in the past 50 years.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.482
And Mark Bailey could say, well, that's bullshit because there are no viruses.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.439
But we never got there.

27:29.841 --> 27:50.462
In that whole conversation, they actually agreed to stick to the rules, and then they stuck to the rules, even though at any point in time, Mark Bailey could have dunked on Kevin McCarran and said that the whole vaccine schedule in the Western Hemisphere or in Western culture is a criminal enterprise based on a mythology about viruses, but they never say it.

27:51.314 --> 27:54.256
It can be said in one sentence, but they never say it.

27:54.296 --> 27:58.579
Just like, unfortunately, Children's Health Defense never says it either.

28:00.019 --> 28:01.520
Bobby Kennedy never says it either.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.022
He always says, well, I just want safe vaccines.

28:04.062 --> 28:05.403
I want tested vaccines.

28:05.803 --> 28:08.385
I want vaccines to be tested against a placebo.

28:08.745 --> 28:14.028
And then his people that believe in him say, well, that's just the legal way of saying it.

28:14.088 --> 28:15.769
That's just the lawyer way of saying it.

28:16.189 --> 28:18.771
That's just a way that says it without saving anyone.

28:20.779 --> 28:26.222
The same with Robert Malone, the idea that he's coming to our rescue, but he's never going to question the vaccine schedule.

28:26.682 --> 28:33.386
Meryl Nass, when she was coming to our rescue about anthrax, was not scheduling or questioning the vaccine schedule.

28:33.426 --> 28:46.134
She was questioning a very particular kind of anthrax vaccine and questioning whether or not a very particular type of anthrax vaccine might be bad.

28:46.154 --> 28:48.315
But of course there might be future vaccines.

28:51.280 --> 29:05.243
And once you see that none of these people have actually usefully questioned anything, you know, in light of the fact that it's quite easy to do it, then you're going to see how this illusion is sustained and it's sustained across in all directions.

29:06.443 --> 29:14.385
So if we watch this video and then we hear these people say incredibly insightful things about the irreducible complexity of life,

29:16.069 --> 29:38.708
but then never come to the very short distance conclusion that, wait, if our system is so complex that everything they say they know about it is actually evidence of it being more complex instead of better understood, then what is the worst thing that's going on right now?

29:40.510 --> 29:41.510
Is it fast food?

29:42.751 --> 29:44.213
Is it the Department of Education?

29:45.419 --> 29:54.911
Or is it the intramuscular injection of combination of substances with the intent of augmenting something that these guys would argue we have not the knowledge to augment?

29:56.502 --> 29:59.544
And yet, for whatever reason, these guys are all over the internet.

29:59.624 --> 30:06.127
Every one of their videos is never canceled because they choose to talk about a very limited spectrum of debate.

30:06.167 --> 30:10.230
And that limited spectrum of debate is evolution and how did life actually start.

30:10.650 --> 30:14.872
And the people who say that life started with a lightning bolt hitting a mud puddle are just dumb.

30:15.273 --> 30:21.136
Because I'm a biologist and I'm a biochemist and I know that's not enough to create the complexity that we see.

30:23.462 --> 30:27.429
And so they are very good at arguing that we don't understand Jack.

30:27.910 --> 30:35.643
They are very good at pointing out that the intricacies of the pattern integrity that we call life are so incredible.

30:37.304 --> 30:40.507
It's like a million Swiss watches that are all working together.

30:40.667 --> 30:45.971
You know, some horribly inadequate metaphor to describe what it is that we see.

30:46.031 --> 31:00.683
If we look closely enough, if we measure closely enough, if we measure with enough precision, we see such a tremendous number of variables and interdependencies that it's an irreducible complexity that we can't possibly hope to augment.

31:01.724 --> 31:05.807
And these guys are very aware of that from a limited spectrum.

31:07.273 --> 31:15.302
And if they were really aware of it, then one of the first things I think that should come to mind is, holy crap, is the vaccine schedule a criminal enterprise then?

31:17.104 --> 31:19.948
Holy crap, is the FDA and CDC scary then?

31:22.090 --> 31:23.532
But do they ever get to that conclusion?

31:25.677 --> 31:26.978
All right, so let's watch it.

31:27.258 --> 31:38.167
I know you're gonna like a lot of it and you're gonna, because of me, you're probably gonna get mad about a lot of it, but a lot of people have said that I should watch this guy and I've been watching him for a long time and taking it in.

31:41.334 --> 31:46.398
And I really feel like it's just one of these things where, you know, these big messages are very easy now.

31:47.199 --> 31:54.044
It's not very hard to challenge somebody like Kevin McKernan with RNA cannot pandemic.

31:54.104 --> 31:56.026
Like think about what pandemic means.

31:56.086 --> 31:57.287
It's not a lot of RNA.

31:57.347 --> 31:58.948
It's not like a few thousand people.

31:59.388 --> 32:01.570
A pandemic is still going on right now.

32:03.271 --> 32:07.595
ZDoggMD just one month ago got his first bout of COVID.

32:08.894 --> 32:19.178
ZDoggMD testified on YouTube one month ago that he got his first bout of COVID and all about how bad it was and all the symptoms that happened and all things got mixed up.

32:19.238 --> 32:27.101
And he even talked about how a pulse oximeter gave him a clue about it.

32:29.724 --> 32:46.215
And so a pandemic, an RNA pandemic, according to Kevin McKernan, is a molecule that can start out in a small number in Wuhan, China, maybe a little earlier than 2019, you know, where they weren't sequencing, according to him, on the Vance Crowe podcast in April of 2020.

32:49.079 --> 32:59.131
and could spread around the world with high fidelity and be tracked by over 16 million sequences, despite the fact that this has never been done before, never even close.

32:59.412 --> 33:05.999
Even when they found a very interesting new human coronavirus in the Netherlands in 2007, they were only able to track it through 27 children.

33:08.643 --> 33:16.587
But this one released in China was tracked around the world and continues to be tracked by high fidelity sequencing operations all around the world.

33:16.627 --> 33:36.338
According to Kevin McKernan, the guy who dropped out of college to be part of the human genome project, the department of energy top secret sequencing thing that was done in cooperation with China and other companies all around the world, companies like BGI that were supplying the PCR tests at the start of the pandemic that were used to bamboozle us.

33:38.288 --> 33:41.110
These people are all part of the same little operation.

33:42.131 --> 33:47.876
And what you're going to see here is a very limited spectrum of debate about what we've been talking about for a long, long time.

33:48.537 --> 33:53.241
And that is that the irreducible complexity that is the biology of your son or daughter

33:54.836 --> 34:18.631
is not able to be augmented by any product that Big Pharma makes, any countermeasure that the DOD, DITRA, DARPA, BARDA, ARPA, ARPA-H, HHS, I don't care what agency you name, nobody is able to augment the irreducible complexity that is the perfect immune system of your child.

34:19.997 --> 34:26.302
And if your child is in a medical condition that is genetic, then we're not talking about healthy children anymore.

34:27.583 --> 34:35.368
And so let's see what these guys got to say and see if we can draw anything from it as we try to find new ways out.

34:37.050 --> 34:37.850
Maybe I have to push play for you.

34:37.870 --> 34:38.411
Two questions.

34:39.271 --> 34:43.014
How do higher forms of life evolve from lower forms of life?

34:43.454 --> 34:46.757
Charles Darwin answered that question, or at least thought he did.

34:47.642 --> 34:51.883
But the other question is one that Darwin never even attempted to answer.

34:52.844 --> 34:55.865
Where does life come from in the first place?

34:57.245 --> 35:00.906
Scientist and philosopher Stephen Meyer and chemist James Tour.

35:01.706 --> 35:03.387
Uncommon Knowledge, now.

35:13.598 --> 35:14.819
Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge.

35:15.039 --> 35:15.840
I'm Peter Robinson.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.782
We're filming today in Fiesole, Italy.

35:18.842 --> 35:24.527
Stephen Meyer earned his undergraduate degree at Whitworth College and his doctorate in the history of science at Cambridge.

35:25.108 --> 35:37.058
Now the director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute, Dr. Meyer's books include Signature in the Cell, Darwin's Doubt, and The Return of the God Hypothesis.

35:37.967 --> 35:54.418
James Tour received his undergraduate degree at Syracuse University and his doctorate in Synthetic Organic and Organometallic, I can't even say what this field is, in Synthetic Organic and Organometallic Chemistry from Purdue.

35:55.038 --> 35:59.241
Now a professor at Rice University, Dr. Tour's areas of research include

36:00.094 --> 36:14.085
nanoelectronics, graphene electronics, silicon oxide electronics, and carbon research into what the Rice website terms, quote, environmentally friendly oil and gas extraction, close quote.

36:14.986 --> 36:23.432
Dr. Tur has published more than 1,000 peer-reviewed research papers and holds several hundred patents.

36:24.293 --> 36:26.875
Steve and Jim, bing, bing, bong.

36:29.176 --> 36:29.557
Darwin.

36:30.913 --> 36:34.477
A couple of quotations here, as I mentioned earlier.

36:34.537 --> 36:38.681
So let's pause just a second here to make sure that we're all on the same page.

36:40.923 --> 36:43.366
And what I'd like, oh, that's the wrong cut.

36:43.506 --> 36:44.086
Let's do this.

36:47.067 --> 36:52.851
So he says, how does lower life evolve into higher life?

36:52.951 --> 36:56.474
I'm going to summarize more like, how does life evolve from other life?

36:57.174 --> 37:00.336
He inserted the idea that lower life becomes higher life.

37:01.437 --> 37:03.819
We have very little evidence for that.

37:04.359 --> 37:08.903
We do have the idea that birds can change and this kind of thing is what Darwin

37:10.009 --> 37:21.359
seemed to have observed in the patterns that he saw, but to take that and then drive it all the way back to the origins of life is something that has been a more recent idea.

37:21.819 --> 37:25.042
I don't think Darwin ever thought that he had figured out the origins of life,

37:25.702 --> 37:30.284
or how life started, and I think that's kind of where this all goes to.

37:30.844 --> 37:44.269
And remember that the foundation of this idea is that people like Craig Ventner and others have tried to take parts of bacteria out and replace them with other parts of bacteria or make synthetic cells or synthetic life.

37:45.049 --> 37:52.513
And one of the things that at least one of these guys, James Tour, has been really vocal about is the idea that these are all nonsense experiments.

37:52.553 --> 37:54.514
They're not really doing what they say they're doing.

37:54.814 --> 37:59.576
They're still starting with a living thing that they rearrange and then they have another living thing.

37:59.616 --> 38:05.479
They don't start from a bunch of chemicals on the shelf and then put them all together and then get a pattern integrity.

38:05.519 --> 38:07.620
And that's a very valid point.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.921
But again, we're asking very limited questions here.

38:11.021 --> 38:11.922
But again, the whole

38:12.930 --> 38:26.146
The whole basis for public health, the whole basis for the biomedical sciences is the idea that the basic DNA to RNA to protein is the fundamental dogma of basic biology.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.649
And if we understand that, we're 99% of the way to the goal.

38:31.663 --> 38:45.551
And that dogma includes the idea that the Baltimore scheme of viruses, where all different kinds of DNA and all different forms of RNA can be used as genetic material and copied with high fidelity, but only by viruses.

38:45.651 --> 38:52.815
This mythology is part of that same canon that we need to dismantle and never pass on to our children.

38:52.855 --> 38:55.677
And as best we can try to use

38:56.497 --> 39:12.848
the previous observations to reinterpret what that reality really is because somewhere in there I do believe is the truth and it is not all smoke and mirrors it just has to be a significant quantity of smoke and mirrors for the truth to be essentially lost and we would be

39:13.849 --> 39:31.667
It is very dangerous for us and for our future for us to discard everything rather than try our darndest to find out where the smoke and mirrors is and dispel that while maintaining as much of previous observations that were made in good faith as possible.

39:35.131 --> 39:36.552
Two pieces to Charles Darwin.

39:37.472 --> 39:49.438
And the second piece is evolution, his elaborate theory that random mutation and natural selection can lead to or did lead to the creation or origin of many different species.

39:49.618 --> 39:52.540
Now, that we won't go into and agree with it or disagree with it.

39:53.340 --> 39:54.260
It's an explanation.

39:54.341 --> 39:55.321
It's a body of thought.

39:55.361 --> 39:56.442
It's a kind of discipline.

39:57.682 --> 40:02.425
But the other piece, the first piece, is this.

40:03.025 --> 40:06.807
Darwin simply assumes that life exists.

40:07.796 --> 40:12.659
His theory calls for evolving from something that's there in the first place.

40:13.520 --> 40:28.049
Here he writes in a letter to a friend in 1871, if, and oh, what a big if, we could conceive in some warm little pond that a protein compound was chemically formed, ready to undergo still more complex changes.

40:28.810 --> 40:34.994
That's Darwin in 1871, more than two decades after he published On the Origin of Species, and he's still wondering

40:35.799 --> 40:37.920
how life might have originated.

40:38.940 --> 40:48.402
Now Richard Dawkins, contemporary Oxford zoologist, quote, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.

40:49.802 --> 41:04.726
But of course, Darwin only made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist if you believe, this is a question, but it's my surmise, you can only say that Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist if you believe that that prior question

41:05.458 --> 41:13.505
where does life come from in the first place is either trivially easy to answer or in some basic way doesn't matter.

41:13.645 --> 41:14.206
Is that correct?

41:14.766 --> 41:19.590
Or it has been solved, but neither of those three conditions have obtained.

41:20.351 --> 41:23.053
It's not trivially easy to solve.

41:23.594 --> 41:27.097
It hasn't been solved, and it is actually quite an important

41:27.697 --> 41:34.878
part of the whole naturalistic story that Darwin and modern neo-Darwinists have attempted to tell.

41:35.498 --> 41:49.741
And you're right, there's a distinction between what's called chemical evolutionary theory, which attempts to explain the origin of the first life from simpler non-living chemicals, and biological evolutionary theory, which attempts to explain the origin of new forms of life from simpler pre-existing forms of life.

41:50.181 --> 41:57.022
Darwin's theory was a form of biological evolution, an attempt to explain the origin of new forms from simpler forms,

41:57.432 --> 42:08.595
But he presupposed, as he put it in the origin, one or very few simple forms at the base of his famous tree of life, and did not account for where that came from, from simpler prebiotic chemicals.

42:08.916 --> 42:22.820
Before we continue, and I've got loads more to ask, obviously, why am I, a layman, coming to this a century and a half after Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species, scratching my head and saying, fellows,

42:24.409 --> 42:28.514
This first question, where does life come from in the first place, that's a pretty big one.

42:28.874 --> 42:35.982
How is it that a sort of interested layman can only suddenly realize, you guys have this elaborate, what about this?

42:37.544 --> 42:42.910
Did science simply treat it as unimportant or so easy that they'd get to it sooner or later?

42:42.930 --> 42:44.852
The question of the origin of life.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.200
Nobody knows the origin of life.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.501
Nobody has ever known the origin of life.

42:49.561 --> 42:57.122
But people assume very much like the Babylonians assumed that it came out of a stinking pond.

42:58.042 --> 43:02.043
That's where they say their life came out of and their gods came out of that same pond.

43:02.543 --> 43:04.803
And that's the primordial soup model.

43:05.184 --> 43:07.164
And that model persists today.

43:07.724 --> 43:12.565
You look in any textbook from elementary school to advanced

43:13.425 --> 43:17.809
college textbooks, and it will speak of the primordial soup model.

43:18.209 --> 43:27.337
Life came out of that, that there were molecules that came together, and they formed higher-order structures, and that formed a cell, and that led to life.

43:27.698 --> 43:29.439
That is a bunch of nonsense.

43:29.659 --> 43:30.480
Okay, hold on.

43:31.100 --> 43:34.884
I remember those textbooks with flasks and tubes.

43:34.984 --> 43:36.045
So let's take a moment there.

43:37.624 --> 43:38.966
First of all, you said something interesting.

43:38.986 --> 43:40.268
Darwin's warm little pond.

43:40.608 --> 43:42.710
Darwin is working in a great tradition here.

43:43.311 --> 43:46.915
The Babylonians had myths involving the primordial soup.

43:47.436 --> 43:48.958
So let's take a moment here.

43:49.599 --> 43:52.782
The famous Miller-Urey experiments of the 1950s

43:55.188 --> 43:58.972
Very simple, two flasks, closed system with tubes.

43:59.673 --> 44:05.939
One flask has ammonia, methane, and a few other elements to simulate the primordial atmosphere.

44:06.800 --> 44:11.164
Another flask has water to simulate the primordial ocean.

44:12.145 --> 44:15.649
And then electricity gets introduced to simulate lightning.

44:16.450 --> 44:17.090
And what do you know?

44:18.482 --> 44:20.903
Amino acids seem to settle out of this.

44:21.283 --> 44:29.166
And in early experiments, according to my reading, there were five amino acids, which could be described as central building blocks of life, I'm told.

44:29.727 --> 44:33.628
In later experiments, they refined it, improved it a bit, and they got up to 22 amino acids.

44:35.189 --> 44:36.710
And there, it seems to have stopped.

44:36.750 --> 44:38.110
The science says, oh, that's close enough.

44:38.190 --> 44:40.571
We can extrapolate from what's going on there.

44:40.891 --> 44:43.212
Keep this up for a billion years, and you'll end up with life.

44:43.612 --> 44:45.773
And James Tour says, it's garbage.

44:46.754 --> 44:47.414
That doesn't work.

44:48.015 --> 44:50.095
Yes, they made a number of amino acids.

44:50.115 --> 44:55.196
They also made amino acids that are totally unnatural, and so they had many amino acids.

44:55.596 --> 44:59.837
I think that there may have been a dozen or so of the amino acids, but it doesn't matter.

45:00.237 --> 45:04.838
All of them were achiral, which means they didn't have the handedness that one wants.

45:05.878 --> 45:11.219
Organic molecules, aside from the very simplest of organic molecules, have two-handedness.

45:12.719 --> 45:15.440
You either have a right-handed model or a left-handed model.

45:15.967 --> 45:18.868
Your right and your left hand are mirror images of one another.

45:18.908 --> 45:22.070
If you put your right hand up to a mirror, it will appear as your left hand.

45:22.450 --> 45:24.031
The two are non-superimposable.

45:24.491 --> 45:27.713
That's why your right hand can't fit in a left-handed glove.

45:28.894 --> 45:29.874
Molecules are like that.

45:29.934 --> 45:31.715
Organic molecules are like that as well.

45:32.836 --> 45:35.017
He made both of the images.

45:35.317 --> 45:37.198
You have to have one and not the other.

45:37.678 --> 45:42.180
So there were other experiments that talked about resolving these, separating these.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.161
But that's the easy part.

45:44.221 --> 45:45.542
That's actually quite easy.

45:46.462 --> 45:57.948
But what was presumed from that experiment, which was actually a very nice experiment, and I'm not belittling that experiment at all, is that we would very soon figure out the way to life.

45:58.308 --> 45:59.608
That's what was assumed.

45:59.969 --> 46:01.629
And so that was 75 years ago.

46:01.930 --> 46:02.910
So think about that.

46:02.970 --> 46:05.651
Think of what has been done in the last 75 years.

46:06.912 --> 46:10.755
where you have this whole silicon era, which started in 1960.

46:11.496 --> 46:12.537
You have computers.

46:12.577 --> 46:13.657
You have space flight.

46:14.018 --> 46:17.881
You have landing on the moon, which was in the 1960s, a long time ago.

46:18.221 --> 46:22.124
You have all of this internet connectivity, the medical advances.

46:23.045 --> 46:26.288
We still don't know how these things come together.

46:26.648 --> 46:29.911
You have to take the amino acids and polymerize them, hook them together.

46:29.931 --> 46:31.452
That's a big problem.

46:31.712 --> 46:32.753
Nobody has solved that.

46:33.233 --> 46:35.175
Jim, may I read a little bit

46:35.902 --> 46:38.763
from a paper of yours, one of your 1,000 peer-reviewed papers.

46:39.283 --> 46:40.604
I don't understand a word of this.

46:41.064 --> 46:42.444
So I like what he was saying there.

46:42.724 --> 46:48.906
He says that the idea of handedness is chirality in organic chemistry.

46:48.926 --> 46:51.207
He's not wrong about that.

46:51.567 --> 46:56.669
And he hinted at it at the very end of what I would have rather him focus on, which is the idea that

46:58.114 --> 47:23.907
proteins are chains of amino acids and how they get chained together in our system involves a very impressive machine called a ribosome that has RNA components and protein components that all come together to become this kind of reader of another molecule that gets translated and so there were making amino acids is pretty darn far away from having a

47:25.675 --> 47:35.275
a working ribosome system, a working protein translator, a working genome, all these things that exist in a single-celled organism.

47:39.591 --> 47:47.934
It's a bit like saying, you know, we've got the raw materials and the alloys that are present in this pocket watch.

47:48.155 --> 47:56.538
And so obviously that if we just kept, you know, turning the bucket and mixing things up, first we got the alloy that we need and soon it would be gears.

47:56.598 --> 48:04.401
And before you know it, those gears will mesh together and tell the hour and the minute if we just keep mixing the bucket.

48:06.022 --> 48:07.843
Because that's what is proposed, right?

48:08.891 --> 48:19.757
you get out of simple building blocks, you get highly complex pattern integrities that become increasingly more complex pattern integrities.

48:19.817 --> 48:24.800
And that's a pretty, in general, I think that that's a pretty bold statement to make.

48:24.860 --> 48:31.503
And we don't have a lot of evidence from our current experience that that's exactly how life would be generated.

48:31.563 --> 48:38.167
All we know is how life currently behaves when we tweak it, when we mess with it, when we perturb it.

48:39.793 --> 49:01.586
And in fact, I might argue that getting people to argue incessantly about whether or not we know where life came from is wasting a lot of people's time when you could be informing them of how little we actually understand about the pattern integrity that we are, and therefore how criminal it is that all of these industries, including the vaccine industry, even exist.

49:02.605 --> 49:22.570
because they are based on the premise of a high-fidelity understanding of who we are as a pattern integrity, and these guys are arguing that we don't know jack about diddly, but only in the limited spectrum of debate as it pertains to the origins of life, not as it pertains to public health and the augmentation of life now.

49:23.757 --> 49:25.639
Unfortunate, but this is what I see.

49:25.659 --> 49:30.383
Let me quote a little bit and ask you to help me understand it.

49:30.743 --> 49:33.065
Quote, this is the title of the paper.

49:33.446 --> 49:39.110
Are present proposals on chemical evolutionary mechanisms accurately pointing toward first life?

49:39.651 --> 49:39.951
All right.

49:40.512 --> 49:47.858
You describe work that you have done in assembling what you call nano cars, tiny little vehicles.

49:47.998 --> 49:48.539
Here's a quote.

49:49.554 --> 49:50.855
I'm quoting you in this paper.

49:51.136 --> 49:55.560
So here's something to consider as we think about the problem of the origin of life.

49:56.421 --> 50:05.550
Designing nanocars, to which you've already devoted about a dozen intricate pages of how you design these tiny little vehicles.

50:06.070 --> 50:08.452
Designing nanocars is child's play.

50:09.218 --> 50:26.030
in comparison to the complex molecular machinery and information processing systems at work in the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, DNA, RNA, and polysaccharides, let alone their assembly into complex functional macroscopic systems.

50:26.310 --> 50:33.256
So now he's saying exactly what I would like to say, but again, just like the no-virus people,

50:34.082 --> 50:43.045
If you come to the conclusion that there are no viruses and these people are lying about viruses, then the next stage of that realization is holy shit.

50:43.705 --> 50:45.846
What are they doing with the vaccine schedule?

50:45.886 --> 50:49.287
And especially what are they doing with the vaccine schedule in America?

50:51.628 --> 50:56.029
Especially if you're an American, you should think you would come to that conclusion very quick.

50:56.793 --> 51:16.068
What were they doing when they rolled out transformation and transfection as a countermeasure to a coronavirus pandemic when, you know this James Tour, but did James Tour ever speak out about RNA viruses or the vaccine schedule or public health measures or anything like that?

51:17.650 --> 51:18.770
Do you think he ever will?

51:18.790 --> 51:25.696
Close quote.

51:27.873 --> 51:55.320
Is this layman correct in saying, as we have learned more about chemistry, as we have achieved the ability to manipulate chemistry more and more accurately, we have learned that the question of how life first began is far bigger and far more complicated and far more elusive than Darwin and Miller and Urey ever conceived?

51:56.653 --> 51:58.254
Yes, this happens all the time.

51:58.714 --> 52:04.698
This, we see this all, every time we try to make something, the goalpost goes further away.

52:04.758 --> 52:06.479
It's not that the cell is evolving.

52:06.899 --> 52:09.541
It's that we understand more of the cell.

52:09.581 --> 52:19.567
So we're here, we move a little bit closer to maybe solving this, but the cell, the target has moved miles and miles further away because we're like, oh no.

52:20.107 --> 52:21.228
So what he's saying is,

52:21.428 --> 52:28.197
What he's saying is, is that as we've come to understand our biology better, we've come to understand it as more complex.

52:30.100 --> 52:35.087
Now the analogy that I came up with the other day that I'm gonna test out on you here is the idea that, hi,

52:41.172 --> 52:45.254
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooley, and I'm an auto mechanic specialist.

52:45.774 --> 52:47.234
I work on autos.

52:47.294 --> 52:48.835
I know all about automobiles.

52:48.895 --> 52:55.437
My specialty is actually the exhaust and the contents of the exhaust, the temperature of the exhaust.

52:55.497 --> 53:04.501
And I have spent years and gotten lots of NIH funding to understand the relationship between the speed of automobiles and the temperature and composition of the exhaust.

53:05.041 --> 53:13.085
And I have found correlations between both the temperature and the content of the exhaust and the velocity of the vehicle.

53:13.145 --> 53:23.650
And I think that if I could come up with pharmaceutical ways to change the content of the exhaust of the car, I might be able to find new ways of regulating the speed of automobiles.

53:23.690 --> 53:29.813
And right now the speed of automobiles is really only regulatable by a few ways that we already understand.

53:30.193 --> 53:32.274
And these bad drivers are pushing on that pedal.

53:32.674 --> 53:34.256
and it seems to regulate that.

53:34.296 --> 53:46.751
But there are other correlative measures that we've found, and that includes my work, really my whole career dedicated to studying the correlation between vehicle speed, exhaust content, and exhaust temperature.

53:48.604 --> 53:52.285
And basically how we've studied the immune system is like this.

53:52.405 --> 53:53.565
I am an immunologist.

53:53.625 --> 53:54.845
I'm very much an expert.

53:54.985 --> 53:57.266
I make lots of measurements of this one thing.

53:57.886 --> 54:01.386
And then I compare this one thing and all the thing that it's correlates to.

54:01.466 --> 54:05.887
And anything that it correlates to, I claim I'm contributing some understanding to.

54:07.668 --> 54:14.689
And what he is saying, what James Tour is saying is that in reality, every time we find a new thing to study,

54:16.277 --> 54:19.901
We are adding to our complexity of the automobile.

54:20.021 --> 54:34.757
When I was the only guy studying automobiles in the world, and I was the only guy who had a correlation between exhaust temperature and velocity, and I was the only one who could draw a line and fit to it, then I had the best model of how cars work.

54:36.735 --> 54:49.848
But as soon as there came this new person who was also measuring the speed of the wheels turning or the depression of the gas pedal or something like this, now suddenly our understanding of how the vehicle works becomes more complex.

54:50.768 --> 54:56.230
Now we got these people that are measuring the charge across the battery and measuring whether or not the alternator's running.

54:56.270 --> 55:02.193
And all of a sudden now, we've got all these people who claim they understand how the car works, but they're all looking at one thing.

55:02.793 --> 55:04.193
I'm an alternator scientist.

55:04.313 --> 55:14.458
I'm sure that the alternator is vital to the functioning of the automobile because when the alternator is removed, the car can only run for like 20 minutes and then the lights go out and then the whole thing fails.

55:17.759 --> 55:19.159
And so by lesioning the

55:21.787 --> 55:26.612
Alternator, we have shown that the alternator is one of the central components of an automobile.

55:26.652 --> 55:32.198
And so I need billions of dollars in grant money to understand how the, the alternator works.

55:32.258 --> 55:38.104
And I'm going to measure all the voltages at all the different places on the alternator and look at the spinning things and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

55:40.206 --> 55:40.807
So there you go.

55:42.952 --> 55:47.134
If we plug the exhaust pipe with a potato, the car won't run.

55:47.594 --> 55:53.077
So exhaust, that pipe is obviously crucial to understanding how the car works.

55:53.757 --> 56:03.162
And so we should invent millions of dollars in understanding why that gas comes out of that, why that vapor comes out, what it's composed of.

56:05.345 --> 56:26.120
And we have tried to study something much more complex than an automobile with far fewer accessible places to measure, far fewer obvious moving parts than an automobile, than a Swiss watch, than a slot machine.

56:28.567 --> 56:36.051
and yet approached it with the same sort of blinders on that, yeah, well, if you pull the handle on the slot machine, then all those things turn.

56:36.091 --> 56:38.593
And so they must be related to somehow.

56:38.653 --> 56:41.034
And so I'm gonna keep putting coins in and pulling this handle.

56:41.074 --> 56:44.777
And the more I do it, the more I'll understand about how the machine works.

56:47.398 --> 56:53.582
And we have gone forward as these guys explain with this incredible arrogance about what we know and don't know.

56:53.622 --> 56:55.243
What does it say here in this slide?

56:56.479 --> 57:07.396
that proteins and enzymes and DNA and RNA and polysaccharides, let alone their assembly into complex functional macroscopic systems, complex functional pattern integrities?

57:09.219 --> 57:11.623
So he knows that we don't know jack about Diddley.

57:13.217 --> 57:26.547
But then he focuses exclusively on arguing with people who say they're creating synthetic life, or arguing with people that are saying they're creating the precursors of life, or the origins of life, or they're working on that problem.

57:27.768 --> 57:42.140
And that's his exclusive focus, rather than thinking about the logical conclusion, which is, wait a minute, if we're not driving this car, if pushing on the gas pedal and steering the wheel doesn't matter, then we better get out of this car.

57:44.636 --> 57:49.838
Because somebody might crash this car into a telephone pole that we can't see, that we will have no control over.

57:50.278 --> 57:52.660
And yet that's not the conclusion this guy comes to.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.720
That's why he's still on YouTube.

57:54.740 --> 57:56.041
That's why he's very popular.

57:56.081 --> 57:58.282
That's why the Hoover Institution is interviewing him.

57:58.342 --> 58:02.384
Because the limited spectrum of debate is being strictly reinforced here.

58:03.684 --> 58:05.385
That you can have all these ideas.

58:05.425 --> 58:11.708
You can understand how arrogant biomedical sciences is in the limited context of synthetic life.

58:12.791 --> 58:23.383
rather than him saying, and yeah, and would think about how ridiculous it is that we transformed and transfected people at the start of the pandemic under the guise of augmenting their immune system.

58:23.984 --> 58:33.475
Imagine that we've been doing that with combinations of recombinant protein and adjuvants, which are really just toxins, which he must know because he's a biochemist.

58:35.731 --> 58:53.405
And yet this brilliant orator and this really talented expressor of these ideas can only apply these ideas to a very limited spectrum of questions, not to really important ones that might have huge consequences for how our grandchildren grow up thinking of themselves.

58:54.926 --> 58:57.448
Big time, big time problem.

58:58.409 --> 59:03.713
Let alone their assembly into complex, functional, macroscopic systems, close quote.

59:05.874 --> 59:33.320
Is this layman correct in saying, as we have learned more about chemistry, as we have achieved the ability to manipulate chemistry more and more accurately, we have learned that the question of how life first began is far bigger and far more complicated and far more elusive than Darwin and Miller and Urey ever conceived?

59:34.673 --> 59:36.274
Yes, this happens all the time.

59:36.735 --> 59:38.356
This, we see this all every time.

59:38.376 --> 59:42.739
And the most dangerous place that it happens is on the vaccine schedule in America.

59:42.779 --> 59:47.463
The most dangerous place it happens is in the HMO office in America.

59:47.523 --> 59:49.705
The place where it happens in the doctor's office.

59:49.745 --> 59:52.167
The place that happens is the CDC and the FDA.

59:52.627 --> 59:55.229
And this guy isn't concerned about those places at all.

59:55.629 --> 01:00:02.495
He's concerned about the people that do flask experiments with electricity and claim that they're creating life because those people are the real snakes.

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.190
And we try to make something.

01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:09.034
The goal post goes further away.

01:00:09.074 --> 01:00:10.816
It's not that the cell is evolving.

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:13.880
It's that we understand more of the cell.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.501
So we're here.

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:17.224
We move a little bit closer to maybe solving this.

01:00:17.805 --> 01:00:20.688
But the cell, the target, has moved.

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:22.810
miles and miles further away.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:38.477
And one great example of this would be for example that in Robert Malone's day everybody was talking about retroviruses and soon retroviruses were going to be used to cure all childhood diseases and he wanted to be a geneticist that would do that at every one at every hospital yada yada yada whatever he believed.

01:00:39.733 --> 01:01:04.747
And as we progressed through our understanding and we've gotten more sophisticated in our understanding, one of the things that has become obvious is that there are these micro RNAs, very tiny RNA transcripts, which are designed and used to regulate other RNA transcripts that can change the way that some RNA transcripts remain or don't remain or get edited or don't edit it or up-regulated or down-regulated.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:12.494
And we have no real concept of, on a molecular level, what's going on in an individual cell.

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:13.235
We just don't.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:18.318
Every time we think we're learning something, we find out that, oh wait, there's three more gears over here.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:20.079
There are three more gears over here.

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:22.721
Oh, let's magnify a little bit more.

01:01:22.821 --> 01:01:28.365
Oh wait, oh my gosh, those mitochondria have their own DNA and they also have gears inside of them.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:29.725
Let's magnify a little bit more.

01:01:29.825 --> 01:01:32.007
Oh my gosh, there's gears inside of those gears.

01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:35.780
And so he's completely right.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.740
And he says it so eloquently.

01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:58.705
But one of the most egregious examples in our current culture of where these mythologies are wholly ignored and instead a false sense of fidelity and understanding is coercively thrown against the public is in public health.

01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:21.314
It is in the curing of diseases and the distribution of medicine and the protection of the biosecurity state that is in private-public partnership with pharmaceutical industry all around the world that Robert Malone and Sasha Latupova and Merrill Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:21.734 --> 01:02:25.235
and all of these people likely serve, weaponized piles of money.

01:02:27.085 --> 01:02:29.948
Otherwise, it would be very easy to tell everybody the truth.

01:02:30.448 --> 01:02:38.276
We have no idea what we're doing when we inject a combination of substances intramuscularly with the intent of augmenting the immune system.

01:02:38.676 --> 01:02:43.641
And we certainly have no idea when we transform or transfect people using intramuscular injection.

01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:51.669
But yeah, go ahead and argue about flask experiments and whether or not people can create amino acids that are precursors to life or not.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.550
Because we're like, oh, no, I have to make that, too.

01:02:55.191 --> 01:02:56.811
Oh, I have to solve this problem, too.

01:02:57.452 --> 01:03:02.674
So when you just think a cell is a bunch of protoplasm, the target's not very hard.

01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:18.061
But then when you learn about the cell and the complexity of it, and you see that biochemistry is extraordinary, and there's so many layers to this that I never even thought about, because I didn't have the tools to see it 50 years ago.

01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:19.162
But now I see it.

01:03:20.034 --> 01:03:21.615
And then you, you, you, you.

01:03:22.075 --> 01:03:32.882
And so what the national security state has done is that as we've seen these details, they have used a shell game to try and tell you that these details mean we understand it better.

01:03:34.423 --> 01:03:39.526
These details mean that, that we, we, now we know for sure how the clock works.

01:03:41.181 --> 01:03:48.247
Oh no, these extra gears that we didn't know existed last year, those gears just do things that we knew had to be done.

01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:50.528
We just didn't know what gears they were.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.432
And so that's what Robert Malone does.

01:03:54.512 --> 01:03:55.733
That's what Rick Bright does.

01:03:55.793 --> 01:03:57.134
That's what Tony Fauci does.

01:03:57.194 --> 01:03:58.635
That's what Peter Daszak does.

01:03:58.695 --> 01:04:01.197
That's what all of these pseudobiologists do.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:04.399
That's what Kevin McKernan did his whole career.

01:04:04.439 --> 01:04:07.262
That's what the Human Genome Project is completely based on.

01:04:07.822 --> 01:04:17.251
that the more complex they figured out the whole task was, the more they had to lie about it, the more they had to exaggerate what they had done in the first place.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.973
And that's why we're where we are now.

01:04:19.513 --> 01:04:26.000
Because these people have exaggerated and lied about things a lot more important than the origins of life.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:31.312
Think about how those might be solved, how you might solve those.

01:04:31.393 --> 01:04:34.675
And then you see layers of other things you have to solve.

01:04:35.216 --> 01:04:41.121
So though people may say we're getting closer, the target has moved much further away.

01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:44.443
So I would never say that it will never be solved.

01:04:44.504 --> 01:04:46.145
As a scientist, I can't say that.

01:04:46.625 --> 01:04:50.569
But I just say that the solution is very far from today.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:51.690
OK.

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:52.931
Can I interject?

01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:53.451
Please.

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:55.313
This is some historical context.

01:04:55.953 --> 01:04:56.474
I did my PhD.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.201
on origin of life biology.

01:04:59.902 --> 01:05:06.688
And one of my Cambridge supervisors, who also worked on the history of that field, had a well-known quotation.

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:10.771
She said that behind the question of the origin of life is a deeper question.

01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:15.815
And that is the question of, what are we trying to explain the origin of?

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:18.838
And in 1859, in the 1860s, 1870s, the scientists

01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:29.630
early evolutionary biologists assumed that that question was going to be pretty simple and easy to understand.

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.970
Thomas Henry Huxley.

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.930
And they assumed that why?

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.891
They assumed it because they thought life was very simple.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:42.573
Thomas Henry Huxley, who was Darwin's famous bulldog, said that the cell was a simple homogeneous globule of undifferentiated protoplasm.

01:05:43.114 --> 01:05:45.674
And they thought that life was essentially a kind of chemical.

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:53.797
It was made of an essential substance called protoplasm, which was a kind of jello or goo, that could be produced by a few simple chemical reactions.

01:05:54.799 --> 01:06:03.506
And our knowledge of what the simple cell is actually composed of, as Jim has just said, has advanced massively since then.

01:06:03.587 --> 01:06:04.768
Huxley had no idea.

01:06:04.968 --> 01:06:06.729
Darwin had no idea what we would discover.

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:19.220
And now we know that inside living cells, we have, at the very least, an information storage, transmission, and processing system, which is part of a whole automated system for building proteins and protein machines.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:23.003
These nanomachines that Jim makes, as you correctly point out,

01:06:23.804 --> 01:06:26.206
are, as he puts it, child's play.

01:06:26.787 --> 01:06:36.759
He has these massive chemical recipes that are involved, multiple steps, interventions and manipulations to build the much simpler miniature machines that he can build.

01:06:37.139 --> 01:06:40.122
They're much simpler than the ones that are found inside cells.

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:54.771
And so the problem has, as he puts it, it's receded off into the distance because our knowledge of the complexity of life has meant that it's much, much harder to envision how that might have arisen by a series of undirected chemical processes.

01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:56.152
Reading your work, Steve.

01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:59.631
if I understand it correctly, there's a big moment.

01:06:59.712 --> 01:07:03.874
And funnily enough, the big moment happens at about the same time as the Urey Miller experiments.

01:07:03.914 --> 01:07:06.656
And that big moment is Watson and Crick in 1953.

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:08.777
And you get the double heel.

01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:10.578
They understand the structure of DNA.

01:07:10.618 --> 01:07:16.581
And suddenly, they can see how complicated DNA is.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:23.405
And every living cell, first of all, I want to make sure I get this right, every living cell contains DNA.

01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:23.985
Is this correct?

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:25.586
DNA, RNA, proteins.

01:07:27.972 --> 01:07:31.494
A few quotations that you present in your book, Signature in the Cell.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.495
Bill Gates, DNA is like a computer program.

01:07:34.955 --> 01:07:38.737
Biotechnologist Leroy Hood, DNA represents, quote, digital code.

01:07:39.197 --> 01:07:46.320
Richard Dawkins himself, the machine code of the genes is uncannily computer-like, close quote.

01:07:49.142 --> 01:07:56.065
So doesn't this pose just a gigantic new problem, again,

01:07:57.642 --> 01:08:01.964
Let Steven Jay Gould and whatever they want to argue about evolution.

01:08:02.785 --> 01:08:05.866
We are concerned with this first box, and it's still empty.

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:09.268
And the first box is the first life.

01:08:09.328 --> 01:08:14.891
And not only is it empty, but Ture comes along and says, oh, you have no idea.

01:08:15.211 --> 01:08:18.693
The simplest forms of life require such complex chemistry.

01:08:19.794 --> 01:08:22.495
And then Meyer comes along and says, well, wait a minute, fellas.

01:08:22.535 --> 01:08:23.516
What about Watson and Crick?

01:08:24.196 --> 01:08:25.697
Every cell contains DNA.

01:08:26.977 --> 01:08:36.525
And you're not going to create a 3 billion item long strand of DNA with hitting ammonia with lightning, no matter how many times you do the experiment.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.186
Is that not correct?

01:08:37.366 --> 01:08:40.989
This empty box is now a source of awe, really.

01:08:41.009 --> 01:08:41.690
Exactly.

01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:46.654
If we go back to the Miller-Urey experiment, there's two big classes of problems.

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:50.938
One is that they synthesize the amino acids using

01:08:54.730 --> 01:09:03.344
alleged prebiotic gases, they synthesize it based on gases in those flasks that don't simulate the actual atmosphere on the early Earth.

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:13.851
But secondly, the amino acids that they produced were a mixture, and there was a mixture of all kinds of other things that had to be eliminated for those amino acids to hook up in a way that would be life-friendly.

01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:19.713
But they also didn't explain how they would hook up and how they would hook up in the precise sequence to actually form proteins.

01:09:20.273 --> 01:09:25.435
So it's like getting, it's the difference between letters and words that mean something.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.716
You have a bag of Scrabble letters and you dump them on the,

01:09:28.856 --> 01:09:32.918
on the table, that does not give you a triple word score in the game.

01:09:34.218 --> 01:09:45.502
But the Watson and Crick discovery is seminal, but it's the beginning of a whole series of discoveries in what historians of biology now call the molecular biological revolution.

01:09:46.202 --> 01:09:51.524
In 1953, Watson and Crick elucidate the double helical structure of the DNA molecule.

01:09:52.085 --> 01:09:55.766
But then five years later, Francis Crick, who was a code breaker in World War II,

01:09:57.119 --> 01:10:09.482
realizes that the subunits along the spine of the DNA molecule are functioning like alphabetic characters in a written text or like the digital characters in a section of software.

01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:19.405
In fact, George Gamow, one of the great physicists of the time, realized very quickly that the string of A's, C's, G's, and T's along the spine of the DNA could be represented as

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.230
readily represented as a digital bit string.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:36.916
And so what you have, and what Crick realizes, he calls this the sequence hypothesis, is that DNA contains information for the construction of the proteins and protein machines that are needed to keep cells alive.

01:10:37.356 --> 01:10:39.017
So it's very much like our modern

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:55.563
CAD CAM technology that's used in, say, a Boeing plant, where an engineer will sit at a console, write some code, the code is then translated into another machine code that can direct the function of a manufacturing apparatus.

01:10:55.583 --> 01:11:01.265
So maybe at Boeing, the code from the engineer would put the rivets on the airplane wing in just the right place.

01:11:01.365 --> 01:11:03.186
Or younger people are aware of these 3D printers.

01:11:04.546 --> 01:11:11.388
where we have digital information directing the construction of three-dimensional mechanical or other structures.

01:11:11.829 --> 01:11:13.749
That's what's actually going on inside cells.

01:11:13.809 --> 01:11:15.210
It's not just that there's code.

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:23.853
It's code that's directing the production of three-dimensional proteins and protein machines that are absolutely essential for everything the cell does.

01:11:23.873 --> 01:11:27.574
So even the simplest cell contains DNA, and DNA turns out, and even

01:11:28.254 --> 01:11:29.535
Presume I'm putting it correctly.

01:11:29.595 --> 01:11:30.436
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:11:30.876 --> 01:11:37.142
Even the simplest DNA turns out to be a fantastically complicated and sophisticated instruction manual.

01:11:37.182 --> 01:11:37.662
Is that correct?

01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:37.822
Right.

01:11:38.022 --> 01:11:42.266
For building very specific things that are needed to keep living cells alive.

01:11:42.726 --> 01:11:47.991
So, if you believe, as Darwin believed, that the first life was a blob of jello,

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:53.602
Maybe you have pictures in your mind that suggest that you can get that out of primordial soup.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:58.827
They just weren't that worried about the problem in the 1870s, because they had a false idea of how simple life was.

01:11:59.007 --> 01:12:00.989
They thought a couple of reactions they'd figured out.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.351
But now you've got to figure out the origin.

01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:04.172
Now they've got DNA.

01:12:04.272 --> 01:12:06.254
How do you get that out of the primordial soup?

01:12:06.294 --> 01:12:12.640
Why hasn't the whole scientific establishment said, stop presses.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.400
We're in trouble.

01:12:13.601 --> 01:12:14.521
We have a problem.

01:12:15.933 --> 01:12:16.613
That's what I've said.

01:12:17.073 --> 01:12:17.794
I said timeout.

01:12:17.814 --> 01:12:19.834
I had a whole article called timeout.

01:12:20.495 --> 01:12:22.796
I mean, you're sensing the frustration.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:23.756
Welcome to my world.

01:12:24.336 --> 01:12:26.377
I mean, this is the problem.

01:12:26.757 --> 01:12:27.617
See, that's the problem.

01:12:27.757 --> 01:12:28.478
I said timeout.

01:12:28.498 --> 01:12:29.898
I had a whole article called timeout.

01:12:31.019 --> 01:12:31.879
Here's the whole article.

01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:41.796
These electrifying Stanley Miller chemistry explain the origins of life, not surprising protocols, highly purified chemicals.

01:12:42.636 --> 01:12:46.319
These protocols are as unrealistic as they are unimproved.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.962
And so I guess I want to be sure that my argument is clear here.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:13:01.449
If his argument is that we are exaggerating our understanding of how life has originated,

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:23.713
It seems like a pretty useless place to be digging when there are much more pressing issues, if this is the case, because the same kind of exaggerated fidelity of understanding is being used in immunology and is fueling public health and underpins the idea of a necessary vaccine schedule for children.

01:13:27.915 --> 01:13:39.308
Vaccines for adults are being rolled out under the same pretense that they work and that we can augment the immune system of healthy humans using transfection.

01:13:41.891 --> 01:13:46.557
Which seems like something that James Tour would definitely think was ridiculous.

01:13:49.309 --> 01:13:52.250
apparently doesn't feel the need to say anything about.

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:56.251
I mean, you're sensing the frustration.

01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:57.211
Welcome to my world.

01:13:57.791 --> 01:13:59.832
I mean, this is the problem.

01:14:00.172 --> 01:14:00.892
This is the problem.

01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:02.672
None of this works.

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:05.933
It's a bunch of science fiction.

01:14:06.013 --> 01:14:08.774
It's really nonsense what these guys are putting forward.

01:14:09.174 --> 01:14:11.155
And they're building their careers around this thing.

01:14:11.215 --> 01:14:13.015
And money continues to this day.

01:14:14.315 --> 01:14:16.316
40 million euros was just designated to

01:14:16.696 --> 01:14:22.957
in 10 years, figure out where life came from, and there's about 40 researchers in Europe that are going to try to do this.

01:14:23.357 --> 01:14:24.338
It's really nonsense.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:25.658
We don't even know where to begin.

01:14:25.978 --> 01:14:28.518
We don't know how to take the simple building blocks.

01:14:28.559 --> 01:14:35.900
What they're going to end up doing, and I'll make a prediction right here, what they're going to end up doing is something that's analogous to what Craig Venter has already done.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:44.382
They're going to take a living cell, and they're going to knock some parts out of it, and then put the parts back in that they knocked out and said, hey, look, we made life.

01:14:44.422 --> 01:14:45.202
You didn't make life.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.703
You started with a living cell.

01:14:48.843 --> 01:14:55.649
You took the carburetor out of one car and put a carburetor from another car in and said, hey, look, we made a car.

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:57.371
Because they're not going to know where to begin.

01:14:57.651 --> 01:14:59.293
There's so many problems.

01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:01.195
It's not just five problems.

01:15:02.055 --> 01:15:11.737
I talk about five problems because these are five you're going to have to solve, but that's five of 5,000 that are facing you that just to begin, none of these do we know how to make the polymers.

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:13.558
None of these do we know how to assemble them.

01:15:13.838 --> 01:15:16.758
We're just lost on every phase.

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:18.739
It is a big scam.

01:15:19.139 --> 01:15:19.919
One more question.

01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:21.499
Jim, I'm going to quote you again.

01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:24.760
He could easily say that about public health.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.521
He could easily say that about the vaccine schedule and the claims that Paul often makes, but he doesn't.

01:15:31.598 --> 01:15:31.978
He doesn't.

01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:54.885
That guy on the next to him could also say the same things that there's no way he argues of course his idea is is that this has to be by design this is so intricate and so beautiful and so irreducibly complex that there's no way to explain it by spontaneous mud puddles and lightning combinations it's got to be a creator.

01:15:55.856 --> 01:16:07.181
Okay, then again, the logical conclusion is that these people are exaggerating their fidelity of understanding and using our lack of biological knowledge against us to justify the vaccine schedule.

01:16:07.962 --> 01:16:08.762
But do they get there?

01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:34.085
GigaOM Biological appears to be the only entity on the internet that can come to that logical conclusion that if the national security state, the biosecurity state, that biomedical sciences to a large extent is exaggerating their fidelity of understanding, and the biosecurity state, the governance structure of Western civilization is taking advantage of that incongruity,

01:16:34.884 --> 01:16:44.832
to create the illusion of pandemic potential in RNA viruses to justify a switch of our vaccine schedule to a transfection schedule.

01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:51.437
Ladies and gentlemen, we have only a few years to wake up before this can be stopped no longer.

01:16:54.539 --> 01:17:03.146
And this limited spectrum of debate is extremely thorough and all over the place in places you never thought you'd find it, including

01:17:04.315 --> 01:17:07.718
on YouTube with regard to the discussion of the origins of life.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:28.673
Because if either of these two guys is as clever as they claim and able to see the irreducible complexity of life as they claim, then one of the most urgent messages that any of them would be sending right now is that holy shit, is public health and pharmaceutical allopathic medicine a gigantic fraud.

01:17:29.673 --> 01:17:37.180
based on exaggerated understanding and exaggerated fidelity of what they know can be done with intramuscular injection.

01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:40.503
But these people aren't saying it, and that is a problem.

01:17:41.534 --> 01:17:42.375
I'm quoting your article.

01:17:43.015 --> 01:17:53.582
Imagine that the world's best synthetic chemists, biochemists, and evolutionary biologists have got combined forces to form a team, a dream team.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.564
Money is no object.

01:17:56.064 --> 01:18:06.991
They have at their disposal the most advanced analytical facilities, the complete scientific literature, synthetic and natural coupling agents, and all the reagents their hearts might desire.

01:18:07.252 --> 01:18:09.633
They have a lot of things I don't even understand, but they have it all.

01:18:09.653 --> 01:18:10.134
They have it all.

01:18:11.455 --> 01:18:18.622
Carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids are stored in their laboratories in a state of 100% purity.

01:18:19.803 --> 01:18:26.069
Would the dream team, I'm continuing to quote Dr. Tour, would the dream team please assemble a living system?

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:28.031
Take your time, folks.

01:18:28.832 --> 01:18:30.013
Take a few billion years.

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:31.235
Nothing?

01:18:32.006 --> 01:18:33.287
Well, well, well.

01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.909
So that's just an irrelevant debate.

01:18:35.969 --> 01:18:37.311
It's an irrelevant question.

01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:41.474
And arguing about it will not free your grandchildren from this mythology at all.

01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:44.757
And you can buy t-shirts from that guy.

01:18:44.777 --> 01:18:46.158
You can go listen to him speak.

01:18:46.698 --> 01:18:50.642
And he will not free your teenagers from this mythology at all.

01:18:51.442 --> 01:18:54.125
Might as well be arguing about flat Earth, in my humble opinion.

01:18:55.726 --> 01:18:59.709
Because there are only certain places where the biology meets the road.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.123
And wherever the biology meets the road is where we need to be resisting.

01:19:04.203 --> 01:19:04.764
And we're not.

01:19:05.905 --> 01:19:09.869
The biology meets the road where the vaccine schedule meets your kid's arm.

01:19:10.409 --> 01:19:15.093
The biology meets the road where transfection meets your grandmother's arm.

01:19:15.554 --> 01:19:18.376
Where the shingles shot meets your neighbor's arm.

01:19:18.777 --> 01:19:24.042
The biology hits the road where these people are not driving.

01:19:24.932 --> 01:19:28.335
They don't care about where the biology hits the road.

01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:33.699
They care about where the akademagicians want us to argue, which is about synthetic life.

01:19:35.141 --> 01:19:42.267
And whether or not if they had all the pure chemicals and everything, every reagent they could possibly want, go ahead, make a cell.

01:19:43.067 --> 01:19:43.808
How about this?

01:19:44.228 --> 01:19:46.690
How about we start here, James Tour, instead?

01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:49.813
Here's all the reagents you need in their purest form.

01:19:49.893 --> 01:19:51.995
Go ahead, augment the immune system.

01:19:53.101 --> 01:20:00.466
Now that would be a relevant argument that might start to free our grandchildren from this mythology, but we're not there yet.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:13.675
So we need some help getting James Tour to kind of focus on biology that matters, instead of saying all of this really good stuff in the context that don't free anybody from any caves or anything like that.

01:20:14.956 --> 01:20:15.516
Okay, Jim.

01:20:16.977 --> 01:20:18.518
This expresses your frustration.

01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:19.839
I get that.

01:20:20.259 --> 01:20:22.541
But there's one piece of this that still puzzles me.

01:20:23.689 --> 01:20:25.371
You say, take a few billion years.

01:20:26.011 --> 01:20:27.533
Isn't that still the argument?

01:20:28.193 --> 01:20:34.520
That if you give it enough time, somehow or other, it's an immensely complex procedure.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:40.105
But if you give it enough time, enough shocks of lightning, maybe we can't do it in a lab.

01:20:41.026 --> 01:20:43.368
But the real lab had billions of years at it.

01:20:43.428 --> 01:20:44.569
What about the element of time?

01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:45.670
Time is your enemy.

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:46.511
Enemy?

01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:47.312
Time is your enemy.

01:20:47.822 --> 01:20:55.347
Yes, because those organic compounds... In the 50s, George Wald, a famous scientist who worked on the origin of life problems, said that time was the hero of the plot.

01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:59.430
Give it enough time that what's improbable will become inevitable.

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:01.071
But Jim has it.

01:21:01.091 --> 01:21:05.094
I'm perfect for you because I was using old textbooks in high school that were probably printed.

01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:06.134
Well, we all still get this.

01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:07.735
Yeah, same stuff.

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.757
So the compounds decompose.

01:21:10.017 --> 01:21:13.159
All those beautiful chemicals that they have stored in their labs in 100% purity,

01:21:15.123 --> 01:21:17.124
After a few years, they're not 100% purity.

01:21:17.444 --> 01:21:22.666
In fact, the RNA, after a few weeks, has undergone significant degradation.

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:28.828
So the whole idea is that, oh, well, somehow, one RNA formed, and then it took off.

01:21:29.148 --> 01:21:38.531
It's interesting that he talks a lot about RNA and DNA, but doesn't talk about transfection and transformation, where these are, again, where the biology hits the road.

01:21:40.285 --> 01:21:49.267
These are the current worst examples of an exaggeration of fidelity of understanding in the biological sciences, in the biochemical sciences.

01:21:49.307 --> 01:21:52.687
And yet he's not talking about lipid nanoparticles right now.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:55.668
He's not talking about lipid nanoparticles filled with mRNA.

01:21:56.308 --> 01:22:01.389
None of that is being discussed, but here he is saying that they can't even really make pure RNA to begin with.

01:22:01.429 --> 01:22:06.890
And even if they could, it wouldn't be pure for very long, but we just rolled out an RNA product.

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:09.851
You got no comments on that?

01:22:30.476 --> 01:22:33.278
Now you want to wait billions of years and see what it's going to become?

01:22:33.799 --> 01:22:35.880
Everything goes bad with time.

01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:40.884
These are not even stored in very, very strict conditions.

01:22:40.944 --> 01:22:44.187
But even if they are, there's always a degradation rate.

01:22:44.207 --> 01:22:45.268
So time is your enemy.

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:47.970
So if you happen to have all of those chemicals,

01:22:48.578 --> 01:22:49.578
they're all gonna go bad.

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:51.759
Nothing, your time is your enemy.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:56.261
It's the enemy of being able to do these things.

01:22:56.321 --> 01:22:58.982
In fact, every organic chemist knows this.

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:08.986
If they go home for the weekend without treating their compounds properly and bringing them on to a stable state, they come back after the weekend and it's fallen apart.

01:23:09.426 --> 01:23:11.327
I mean, you pay the price for this sort of thing.

01:23:11.727 --> 01:23:13.488
So you don't have the time, time's your enemy.

01:23:13.508 --> 01:23:15.449
In these Miller-Urey type experiments,

01:23:16.129 --> 01:23:32.675
there's a problem called interfering cross-reactions, where you get, yes, two or three, maybe four or five protein-forming amino acids, but there's all kinds of other chemical compounds that are also synthesized in those same experiments, and they will quickly react with the things you want

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:37.176
and form, in the case of the Miller-Urey experiment, the sludge was called melanoidin.

01:23:37.896 --> 01:23:40.376
And it's moving in a life-unfriendly direction.

01:23:40.837 --> 01:23:50.838
So what the chemist has to do is effectively intervene to remove the byproducts that are unwanted, to allow only the things that are wanted to continue on in the simulation.

01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:53.899
But that's... The chemist has to play God, which is cheating.

01:23:53.939 --> 01:23:54.299
Exactly.

01:23:54.339 --> 01:23:58.460
It's an intelligent intervention, and therefore not a simulation.

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:02.002
of an undirected chemical evolutionary process.

01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:06.464
Let me sum up, if I may, where I think I now understand things stand.

01:24:06.504 --> 01:24:07.884
I'm going to quote Jim one more time.

01:24:08.725 --> 01:24:11.346
This is a different article called Clueless on the Origin of Life.

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:20.110
Quote, quoting you, two-thirds of a century since the Miller-Urey experiment, origin of life research has not made any progress whatsoever.

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.372
Not made any progress whatsoever.

01:24:23.912 --> 01:24:37.698
I mean, we're still talking about the origin of life and the origin of life experiments, which I really think is... It's not the question that we should be asking if we're really, you know, trying to get to the heart of the matter and save our grandkids.

01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:38.899
It's not the question at all.

01:24:38.979 --> 01:24:41.060
We've been to the moon, satellites in space.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.300
We've been to the moon.

01:24:42.601 --> 01:24:42.981
Internet.

01:24:44.263 --> 01:24:45.944
but on the origins of life, Zippo.

01:24:46.484 --> 01:24:53.226
We can even say that suggestions on how life might have formed really show how life probably did not form.

01:24:53.806 --> 01:25:01.789
Nothing even resembling a synthetic cellular structure has arisen from its independent components, let alone a living cell.

01:25:02.329 --> 01:25:04.570
Not even close.

01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:08.631
Are you both willing to stand with that as a good tight summary statement?

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:16.917
I am, but I have a small difference with Jim on this, perhaps, and that I think that that is progress.

01:25:17.297 --> 01:25:20.219
I think that we've defined how difficult the problem is.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.560
He's playing semantic games.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:31.768
It is a semantic game in a way, but it's an important point because, as I was just saying, for the chemists to move the molecules in even a modestly life-friendly direction,

01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:39.941
They invariably, in their simulations, have to remove things they don't want, use purified reagents.

01:25:40.281 --> 01:25:45.044
They are inputting information into their system.

01:25:45.524 --> 01:25:48.925
And therefore, the logic of these simulation experiments run like this.

01:25:48.945 --> 01:25:53.627
We're going to do an experiment under conditions that we think model what was on the prebiotic curve.

01:25:54.188 --> 01:25:55.408
And then we're going to see what happens.

01:25:55.988 --> 01:25:59.550
Well, in order for the molecules to move in a life-friendly direction,

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:09.002
Invariably, there has to be an intelligent input into the system to manipulate the chemical conditions to move them in that direction.

01:26:09.062 --> 01:26:10.324
So what's actually being simulated?

01:26:10.824 --> 01:26:16.772
Aren't they actually then simulating the need for intelligence to move from simple chemistry to more complex, life-relevant chemistry?

01:26:18.329 --> 01:26:20.770
But even their intelligence is nonsense.

01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:24.592
Their intelligence shows that this doesn't work.

01:26:24.672 --> 01:26:29.694
They're so clueless on this thing, they say, OK, we'll do this, and it solves this problem.

01:26:29.895 --> 01:26:31.815
No, you just introduced 10 more problems.

01:26:32.236 --> 01:26:33.916
This is a bunch of nonsense.

01:26:33.996 --> 01:26:36.298
The whole area is a scam.

01:26:36.618 --> 01:26:38.359
OK.

01:26:39.079 --> 01:26:40.980
Glad you don't have any strong feelings about this, Jim.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.622
Listen, can we go now, I believe I understand the dead end.

01:26:47.418 --> 01:26:53.361
Could we go now to this question that DNA raises, the question of information?

01:26:53.842 --> 01:26:54.142
All right.

01:26:54.462 --> 01:26:56.963
This is Steve Meyer in your book Signature in the Cell.

01:26:57.063 --> 01:27:03.447
Quote, DNA sequences do not just possess information in the strictly mathematical sense.

01:27:04.315 --> 01:27:08.357
developed by the famed MIT scientist Claude Shannon in the late 1940s.

01:27:08.918 --> 01:27:14.241
Instead, DNA sequences convey instructions.

01:27:14.921 --> 01:27:20.344
They perform functions, they possess specified information.

01:27:20.584 --> 01:27:27.649
Okay, so you've got, as far as I can tell, it's really important to understand this, but you're gonna have to help me do that.

01:27:28.049 --> 01:27:31.691
So we start with Shannon information, and as I understand it,

01:27:33.106 --> 01:27:35.068
Shannon is working on telecommunications.

01:27:35.088 --> 01:27:41.332
He's trying to come up with mathematical algorithms that let you convey lots of phone calls down a... Communication channel.

01:27:41.633 --> 01:27:42.473
Communication channel, right.

01:27:43.234 --> 01:27:55.844
And he has this basic insight that the information an event conveys is inversely proportional to the event's probability.

01:27:56.464 --> 01:28:00.828
So, the sun comes up this morning, it tells us nothing new.

01:28:01.567 --> 01:28:03.389
That's a very probable event.

01:28:04.089 --> 01:28:10.775
The sun doesn't come up, and we know it is conveying information about some new event in the world.

01:28:10.835 --> 01:28:11.756
Is that roughly correct?

01:28:11.956 --> 01:28:12.316
Roughly.

01:28:12.336 --> 01:28:12.957
It might be.

01:28:12.977 --> 01:28:13.658
You're not happy with that.

01:28:13.678 --> 01:28:17.481
Well, maybe coins or dice might be better ways of getting at it.

01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:20.604
So the basic idea of Shannon information is that

01:28:21.144 --> 01:28:24.627
that information is related to the reduction of uncertainty.

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:25.708
That's the intuition.

01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:34.636
So if I flip a coin and it's got two sides, and it comes up heads, now I've reduced a quantifiable amount of uncertainty.

01:28:34.656 --> 01:28:36.998
It was either going to be a head or a tail, and now it's a head.

01:28:38.299 --> 01:28:41.902
But if I roll a die, there are six possible outcomes.

01:28:42.382 --> 01:28:51.048
And so the amount of uncertainty reduced when it comes up 3 rather than 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 is greater than the amount of uncertainty reduced by flipping the coin.

01:28:51.769 --> 01:28:56.272
And so you can see that the information measure, the amount of uncertainty reduced,

01:28:56.912 --> 01:28:59.813
is related to the probability of the event taking place.

01:29:00.354 --> 01:29:01.894
The head has a one in two chance.

01:29:02.335 --> 01:29:06.036
The die, one side of the die, a one in six chance.

01:29:06.096 --> 01:29:10.759
So there's more uncertainty with the- It's very interesting that he brings up uncertainty.

01:29:10.819 --> 01:29:15.281
There has been a really excellent series done by William Briggs

01:29:16.161 --> 01:29:22.445
It's in the 17th course now on basic statistics using Janes as the primary book.

01:29:22.505 --> 01:29:32.672
It's a really good course and episode 17 is really smack on point here with regard to randomization and what it gives you or doesn't give you.

01:29:35.501 --> 01:29:40.148
And whether or not when you put back the coin or put back the things in the jar, this kind of thing.

01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:43.414
It's a real nice probability exercise that he does.

01:29:43.454 --> 01:29:48.962
I recommend highly William Briggs' course, although it is not all 17.

01:29:51.300 --> 01:30:05.983
Episodes aren't sort of of equal strength and he hits his stride more in different ones and this number 17 is a particularly Has a particular gem with regard to how he explains it and how succinctly explains it and it's practice You know, he's gotten better and better.

01:30:06.563 --> 01:30:11.805
And so please go to William Briggs's substack check out his science our site.

01:30:11.985 --> 01:30:13.865
Sorry his statistics stuff and

01:30:14.145 --> 01:30:14.706
It's really nice.

01:30:14.726 --> 01:30:15.927
More improbable event.

01:30:16.107 --> 01:30:19.169
More uncertainty reduced when a more improbable event occurs.

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:27.136
And so what Shannon does is he's able to quantify the amount of information carrying capacity in any string or bit string.

01:30:27.796 --> 01:30:40.846
But what he can't do, and which he was very explicit about saying, is that his mathematical measure of information carrying capacity doesn't tell you whether the string, the series of characters, is meaningful or functional.

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.305
or specify to perform a function in any way.

01:30:44.745 --> 01:30:59.776
So a very simple example that conveys the difference is you might think of if you type at random 20 characters on your typewriter keyboard and put that string out, and then right below it you might write a line of poetry, time and tide wait for no man.

01:31:01.021 --> 01:31:13.621
Both strings have identical amounts of Shannon information because they're using the same alpha character symbol system, but one has a qualitative

01:31:14.971 --> 01:31:16.352
element that the other doesn't have.

01:31:16.392 --> 01:31:24.755
They're both equally improbable, but one has a qualitative element, and that is that the arrangement of the characters is specific to perform a communication function.

01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:32.098
And that's the kind of information that invariably indicates a designing intelligence.

01:31:32.638 --> 01:31:35.599
If you see a line of poetry that's meaningful, you right away know that it was a poet.

01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:45.027
But if you just see random characters like that, it might be that somebody arranged them in that way, but it also could be the product of monkeys at the keyboard.

01:31:45.627 --> 01:31:53.173
So early on in the 1950s, we have Crick with his sequence hypothesis.

01:31:53.694 --> 01:31:57.097
He's working in the immediate wake of the Shannon Information Revolution.

01:31:57.617 --> 01:32:01.258
And he specifies that DNA does not have mere Shannon information.

01:32:01.678 --> 01:32:07.680
He says that the sequence of bases in DNA are sequenced specifically to perform a function.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:15.182
And so that you have what an origin of life researcher named Leslie Orgel coined this term specified complexity.

01:32:15.262 --> 01:32:17.303
Complexity is a synonym for improbability.

01:32:17.683 --> 01:32:20.424
And so you have a specified improbable arrangement.

01:32:20.484 --> 01:32:24.705
When you have that, that's what we mean in ordinary parlance by information or

01:32:25.285 --> 01:32:35.570
In our careful writing on the origin of life problem, we define what needs to be explained is the origin not of Shannon information, but of specified information or specified complexity.

01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:41.773
Something like tight and tight weight for no man, as opposed to the random characters of the monkey would type out.

01:32:42.273 --> 01:32:48.796
And Crick was absolutely adamant early on that DNA doesn't have just Shannon information, it has specified information.

01:32:49.376 --> 01:32:53.679
Now we come to the moment when the two of you become really controversial.

01:32:54.479 --> 01:33:10.289
Up to this moment, pointing out that the Urey Miller experiments have gone nowhere, that we know less than nothing about where the origins of life might have come from, less than nothing, as you put it, actually what we've done is demonstrate ways that life probably didn't form.

01:33:11.582 --> 01:33:15.808
That, as I take it, you two are very irritating to the scientific community.

01:33:16.288 --> 01:33:17.790
But they can live with you.

01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:23.738
Well, even our friend Richard Dawkins acknowledges that no one knows how life evolved by undirected chemical evolutionary processes.

01:33:23.778 --> 01:33:24.279
So you're right.

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:26.261
This is actually not controversial.

01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:28.023
The critique is not controversial at all.

01:33:28.664 --> 01:33:56.402
because it's applied to a limited spectrum of debate when the logical conclusion to come to is that the same kind of exaggeration of fidelity and of understanding is being executed where biology hits the road and so we should be a pay attention to those things you know like western health care in america nutrition science in america the fda the cdc virology

01:33:58.084 --> 01:34:00.305
transfection and transformation science.

01:34:01.126 --> 01:34:11.293
I mean the list is nearly endless and instead these two guys are really focused on origin of life experiments and whether or not we can call it evidence of a creator or design.

01:34:13.094 --> 01:34:24.823
And so essentially no Academy magician is going to be challenged by these guys and they're given a very easy out in terms of dismissing them because that's not my expertise and I don't care about the origins of life anyway.

01:34:25.896 --> 01:34:32.201
They're not saying that I shouldn't give my kids vaccines or something crazy like that, so I don't have to pay attention to these dudes.

01:34:36.152 --> 01:34:41.276
We're not going to get out until we realize how deep the play goes, how deep the theater goes.

01:34:41.336 --> 01:35:02.755
And whether these guys are witting or unwitting participants, they are participants because it doesn't make any sense for me, for them to be this intelligent and this articulate with regard to the exaggeration, specifically with origin of life claims and not with immunology and not with nutrition and not with

01:35:03.355 --> 01:35:12.781
autoimmunity and not with all these other things that they of course are much more pressing issues with regard to the enslavement of our children by a mythology.

01:35:13.991 --> 01:35:15.331
It's annoying, but not controversial.

01:35:15.391 --> 01:35:18.472
So here's the point where the two of you cross a line.

01:35:18.933 --> 01:35:25.335
And by the way, I feel an urge to grab you by the collars and save you from crossing over that line.

01:35:25.795 --> 01:35:26.635
But I'll get to that.

01:35:27.395 --> 01:35:29.116
This is Steve in Signature in the Cell.

01:35:29.216 --> 01:35:40.800
Quote, the functionally specified information in the cell points to intelligent design for which every one of our listeners is going to say, oh, I know what they mean.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:41.580
They mean God.

01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:44.032
Intelligence is off.

01:35:44.052 --> 01:35:49.638
And so, rather than arguing for God, why not just argue that they're lying about what they understand?

01:35:51.259 --> 01:36:01.750
Instead, now we're going to move to arguing about God, which will turn some people off, other people will reject, and other people already think they have a better answer anyway, so why listen to this?

01:36:03.047 --> 01:36:09.190
Again, limited spectrum of debate defined by bad questions or questions that are essentially hamster wheels.

01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:09.991
That's what you see.

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:14.333
As the best explanation for the ultimate origin of biological information.

01:36:14.733 --> 01:36:15.073
Why?

01:36:15.734 --> 01:36:23.658
Experience shows that large amounts of such information, especially codes and languages, invariably

01:36:24.463 --> 01:36:26.505
originate from an intelligent source.

01:36:26.545 --> 01:36:27.265
I want to repeat that.

01:36:27.906 --> 01:36:39.736
Experience shows, our own lived experience as humans, when you see a line of poet, well, as Bill Clinton said, when you see a turtle on a fence post, you know it didn't get there by itself.

01:36:40.276 --> 01:36:43.039
We recognize intelligence.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.963
Invariably originate from an intelligent source, from a mind or a personal agent.

01:36:48.043 --> 01:36:51.285
In other words- I think the origin of life question is important

01:36:52.509 --> 01:36:56.333
to acknowledge that it's unanswerable.

01:36:57.033 --> 01:37:11.166
I think the origin of life question is important to acknowledge in the sense of the immuno-mythology and the akademagic that is being used to create the illusion of understanding.

01:37:12.027 --> 01:37:18.673
This consensus that somehow we're going to figure it out with the right combination of chemicals and electricity and shaking and heat.

01:37:19.835 --> 01:37:27.017
And that debate is important, but only from the perspective of showing it for the mythology that it is.

01:37:27.077 --> 01:37:40.080
It is the same kind of mythology as me claiming to understand how or making progress in understanding how automobiles work, because I make very high fidelity reproducible measurements that correlate

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.183
the temperature and composition of the exhaust of the car with the velocity that the car is currently expressing.

01:37:47.223 --> 01:37:54.607
And that correlation is very, very high, and therefore I have a very, very unique insight into the function of automobiles.

01:37:55.087 --> 01:38:01.891
And this is no different, except in terms of origin of life, it's a question that doesn't really matter.

01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:10.754
I mean, maybe it does if you think that science is making a challenge to God, but I've never really felt as though science makes a challenge to God.

01:38:10.814 --> 01:38:23.079
I feel like they answer different questions, as long as you understand that at the foundation of biology is an irreducible complexity that's going to be impenetrable by a ruler or a very accurate laser.

01:38:25.168 --> 01:38:35.634
And so I think the question is important, but not from the detail perspective, just from the acknowledgement that that's way off in irreducible complexity land.

01:38:35.694 --> 01:38:38.876
And it's really deep in irreducible complexity land.

01:38:39.197 --> 01:38:48.962
For its intelligent activity is the only known cause of the origin of functionally specified information, close quote.

01:38:49.583 --> 01:38:51.224
So what Meyer is saying

01:38:52.128 --> 01:38:56.732
Now pay attention to this one, Jim, because this guy is just radioactive.

01:38:57.213 --> 01:39:04.680
What Meyer is saying here is that when we see DNA in the simplest cell, we really have no choice.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.804
We have to suppose that there is some intelligent design behind it.

01:39:10.485 --> 01:39:11.646
Are you going to let him get away with that?

01:39:12.901 --> 01:39:17.583
No, I'm sympathetic to what he's saying, because we have no other answer.

01:39:18.064 --> 01:39:20.065
I mean, I don't normally go down that line.

01:39:20.425 --> 01:39:31.770
To say that there's so many problems before you even get to thinking about this question of intelligent design and this information, but I talk about the information.

01:39:31.810 --> 01:39:38.554
We have no idea how to solve the information, but there's so many steps that you have to get through before you even get there.

01:39:38.934 --> 01:39:39.714
You want DNA.

01:39:39.734 --> 01:39:48.217
DNA isn't gonna do anything unless it has lots of enzymes supporting it from around so that it can help to translate it to RNA.

01:39:48.477 --> 01:39:52.278
And RNA isn't gonna just start reacting with amino acids on its own.

01:39:52.338 --> 01:39:54.019
It needs all sorts of support enzymes.

01:39:54.379 --> 01:39:56.159
So there's all these pieces that are missing.

01:39:56.459 --> 01:40:01.461
You don't even get to take advantage of the information that's there because the chemistry doesn't let you.

01:40:01.981 --> 01:40:03.944
The chemistry just doesn't let you.

01:40:04.044 --> 01:40:10.511
And that's in very simple systems, reduced systems, in vitro systems, synthetic systems.

01:40:11.893 --> 01:40:22.365
And so why is it not more important for James Tour to then say, so the idea of augmenting a healthy child's immune system is absurd?

01:40:27.475 --> 01:40:27.996
I don't get it.

01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:43.012
prebiotically synthesized to make it possible to even begin to think about the origin of a cell.

01:40:43.032 --> 01:40:44.853
You have to have the saccharides, the sugars.

01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:45.673
You have to have the lipids.

01:40:45.693 --> 01:40:47.914
You have to have the proteins, the enzymes.

01:40:48.235 --> 01:40:49.395
You have to have the DNA.

01:40:49.415 --> 01:40:51.256
There's all these different classes of molecules.

01:40:51.296 --> 01:40:53.517
But I focused on the information question.

01:40:53.897 --> 01:40:56.758
And I think that is, at some level, the most fundamental question.

01:40:56.778 --> 01:41:00.240
Because it's all about not just the presence of the constituent parts.

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.462
It's about how they need to be arranged in order to perform biological functions.

01:41:05.482 --> 01:41:07.243
But see, even the DNA.

01:41:08.038 --> 01:41:14.481
is a piece of, it's this informational code, but everything in the cell is an informational code.

01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:20.784
The saccharides, the saccharides, the way sugars are put together, bears information.

01:41:21.165 --> 01:41:24.586
That's how cells tell one another apart.

01:41:24.806 --> 01:41:31.790
I mean, they bump into these other cells, they see what the saccharides are, and they, yeah, these are, it's all based on this.

01:41:32.324 --> 01:41:48.735
And so the irreducible complexity and how more details that we find, and this is the argument that James Tuer makes very well about this particular debate, the more details we find doesn't mean that we are progressing down a ladder of understanding.

01:41:48.775 --> 01:41:50.216
Instead, what's happening is,

01:41:50.916 --> 01:41:57.659
Oh shoot, we've identified another variable that we didn't know about before and another variable that we didn't know about before.

01:41:57.699 --> 01:42:02.040
And that doesn't mean that now we have another thing anchored down.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.521
We have another handhold with which to climb.

01:42:04.621 --> 01:42:06.782
No, it means that there's another gear in the clock.

01:42:08.786 --> 01:42:17.268
And we were already telling ourselves for 50 years that we understand what the clock is doing and what the hands mean and how to set the clock and all this.

01:42:17.408 --> 01:42:19.768
Oh wait, wow, look, there's another knob over here.

01:42:20.248 --> 01:42:24.609
Look, if we open this door, oh my gosh, there's a whole nother bank of gears that we didn't know.

01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:26.249
And those are turning too.

01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:27.549
I wonder what they do.

01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:28.450
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:35.551
That just means we understand the clock even better now because instead of the four gears that we thought were driving the hands, now we know that it's 20 gears.

01:42:38.854 --> 01:43:04.367
And so James Tour and this other guy make a very limited-spectrum argument about something that I want to make GigaOM Biological's main message, and have unknowingly been orbiting toward this as the main message for a while, which is that this exaggerated fidelity of understanding is the foundation of all their mythologies.

01:43:06.288 --> 01:43:08.029
And in biology in particular,

01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:36.254
it is imperative that everyone with the requisite knowledge to be aware of some limited aspect of the irreducible complexity in their own field needs to acknowledge that James Tuer and this other guy are exactly right about how that lack of fidelity extends across all academic fields, across all biological disciplines.

01:43:37.225 --> 01:43:53.189
where an exaggeration of understanding, a fidelity of understanding has been substituted for what should have been an ever-increasing complexity and an ever-increasing humility to the system that we are trying to understand.

01:43:53.229 --> 01:44:06.592
And instead, we are raising students and teaching students that these details are evidence of understanding rather than details of the irreducible complexity that we come to be ever more familiar with.

01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:17.665
And I wish these guys would then take the logical step, which is, okay, let's think about where these exaggerated fidelities have the most

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:20.881
detrimental impact on our children.

01:44:21.682 --> 01:44:25.805
Where is it having the most detrimental effect on our societies?

01:44:25.885 --> 01:44:27.546
But James Tuer is not worried about that.

01:44:27.566 --> 01:44:32.409
He's just worried about people who claim to have solved the origin of life problem.

01:44:32.449 --> 01:44:36.092
And I'm going to make sure that those guys have opposition.

01:44:36.172 --> 01:44:48.660
Not very dissimilar to how Kevin McCairn in 2020 was already very sure that he had to oppose the no virus people like Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan, because these people were really, really bad.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.020
sad.

01:44:51.662 --> 01:45:11.254
And so a limited spectrum of debate about spike proteins and viruses and whatever, curated by clowns like Kevin McCarran and clowns like Andrew Kaufman, created a limited spectrum of debate where the logical conclusion of either there are no viruses or they lie about

01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:15.534
everything that they never come to that conclusion.

01:45:15.554 --> 01:45:20.620
They both are unable to get to the logical conclusion of their own statements.

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:28.210
And they have stuck to these ridiculous positions for four and a half years.

01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:30.613
And that's how you can see that they are just part of the show.

01:45:31.994 --> 01:45:47.114
just like these two guys stick to their position, and that very limited, vigorous debate within that position, even though it is very clear that the consequences of their position are that public health, allopathic medicine,

01:45:48.015 --> 01:45:58.464
biopharmaceutical companies, IP in pharmaceuticals, proteins and protein biologic based therapeutics.

01:45:58.604 --> 01:46:07.432
All of these things are gross exaggerations of our understanding and we better darn well come aware of it or these people are going to kill us with this crap.

01:46:07.472 --> 01:46:07.772
But no,

01:46:08.575 --> 01:46:09.275
they're not gonna get there.

01:46:09.595 --> 01:46:17.278
All the amino acids, all the proteins, those all have information so that they know what molecule to build.

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.759
Every piece of the cell is information.

01:46:20.099 --> 01:46:25.461
I mean, and so to just focus on DNA being information, I mean, every piece of your cell is information.

01:46:25.861 --> 01:46:31.323
How does this information get translated if you don't have fidelity in information transfer?

01:46:31.363 --> 01:46:34.424
We tried this years ago in my lab to try to get

01:46:35.373 --> 01:46:43.799
make a starting molecule and have it make a duplex, a daughter molecule, just like itself, not using biological entities.

01:46:44.279 --> 01:46:49.143
And what happened was the fidelity killed us, meaning that it was only 70% pure.

01:46:49.183 --> 01:46:54.326
So you have 30% still in there, now reproducing junk.

01:46:54.967 --> 01:47:01.471
And before you know it- You get what's called a paracatastrophe, which means generation that gets worse and worse and worse because you're not- It's just a mess.

01:47:01.571 --> 01:47:02.192
It's just a mess.

01:47:02.372 --> 01:47:03.653
So, boys, there are two

01:47:05.495 --> 01:47:08.258
Two ways you could argue, I think.

01:47:09.319 --> 01:47:13.043
You could argue, and this is, I'll give you the easy one.

01:47:13.303 --> 01:47:17.727
I'll give you the one that for the sake of your careers, you really, yeah, yeah, follow this one.

01:47:17.867 --> 01:47:19.029
If you take my advice.

01:47:19.049 --> 01:47:19.789
It's too late for me.

01:47:19.869 --> 01:47:24.214
You're both in plenty of trouble, but follow this one, and the trouble will be at least moderate.

01:47:25.103 --> 01:47:29.287
you can say, wait a minute, even the simplest cell contains DNA.

01:47:29.327 --> 01:47:31.869
And then Tuer says, DNA, you don't know the half of it.

01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:36.192
The saccharides, this is the, and the cell is jammed.

01:47:36.252 --> 01:47:37.794
It's bristling with information.

01:47:39.035 --> 01:47:47.522
And the summary of that line of thinking is not only do we not know how the origin of life began,

01:47:48.524 --> 01:48:02.590
But the idea that the question is uninteresting, or easy, or that the universe, given enough time, would have produced it in a random way, that, ladies and gentlemen, given the state of knowledge today, that is preposterous.

01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:03.471
And stop.

01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:06.292
You could just stop there.

01:48:07.252 --> 01:48:10.074
But the two of you, no, you may not yet.

01:48:10.134 --> 01:48:17.057
You'll get a chance, but I want to give you, so, but the alternative is the two of you

01:48:17.892 --> 01:48:21.275
Well, here, let me read a quote to you, because you keep going, you cross the line.

01:48:22.356 --> 01:48:26.059
Jim, even you, I'm going to quote you from your article one more time.

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:36.629
Those who think scientists understand how prebiotic chemical mechanisms produce the first life are wholly misinformed.

01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:39.015
I mean, we're still here.

01:48:39.095 --> 01:48:48.557
Imagine substituting the words, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:48:49.017 --> 01:49:00.160
And then having James tour argue for why I think he could make a very, very devastating argument for why, but does he, even though it's much more important than this,

01:49:02.165 --> 01:49:11.698
Worst case scenario, you might convert some people to atheism or something like that, or you might convert people to believing in God if you pursue this question with vigor.

01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:16.845
But you're not going to break the spell of the vaccine schedule.

01:49:17.671 --> 01:49:22.393
You're not gonna break the spell of the HPV vaccine being rolled out on college campuses.

01:49:22.833 --> 01:49:28.696
You're not gonna break the spell of public health and pandemics at all, not even close.

01:49:28.756 --> 01:49:41.861
And yet you would think somebody with this level of understanding would have focused all of his might on dispelling the illusion of a pandemic, given what he knows about the irreducible complexity of life.

01:49:42.522 --> 01:49:44.222
Nobody understands how this happened.

01:49:44.242 --> 01:49:44.983
You're good so far.

01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:52.519
it would be far more helpful to expose students to the massive gaps in our understanding.

01:49:52.879 --> 01:49:56.944
And that is what GigaOM Biological intends to do.

01:49:57.846 --> 01:49:59.708
That's the real Biology 101.

01:50:02.384 --> 01:50:16.947
Real Biology 101 at the end of it would leave students with a healthy respect for what we don't know, a healthy respect for what the details of what we do know mean for the complexity of the clock we're trying to understand.

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:26.689
And any of these analogies that I've been using today are just wholly inadequate.

01:50:27.523 --> 01:50:49.680
to describe the arrogance with which we moved forward for the last 40 years with regard to viruses and transfection, transformation, sequencing, biology, who we are, what we are, the genetic causes of autism and the genetic causes of all these other diseases are all part of the same mythology that this guy should be dispelling.

01:50:50.728 --> 01:50:53.932
but is not, should be attacking, but is not.

01:50:53.992 --> 01:51:02.242
The Human Genome Project is one of the lowest hanging fruits that this guy could demolish with very similar rhetoric, but he's not going to.

01:51:02.262 --> 01:51:05.045
Far so good.

01:51:05.976 --> 01:51:09.700
And a lot of people thinking, OK, good, Jim, just stop there.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.241
But you don't stop there.

01:51:11.721 --> 01:51:12.382
You go on.

01:51:12.782 --> 01:51:16.686
It would be far more helpful to expose students to the massive gaps in our understanding.

01:51:17.267 --> 01:51:23.212
Then they may find a firmer and possibly a radically different scientific theory, close quote.

01:51:23.592 --> 01:51:25.474
And everybody says there goes tour.

01:51:25.674 --> 01:51:30.098
And the scientific theory, of course, would be about the origin of life, not about

01:51:31.013 --> 01:51:45.925
about vaccines or their effectiveness, not about disease or its existence, not about contagiousness, and not about what we understand and don't understand about our genetics, but instead about what?

01:51:46.045 --> 01:51:48.447
About origin of life and generation of life.

01:51:48.747 --> 01:51:49.908
Opening the door to God.

01:51:51.129 --> 01:51:52.949
You guys crossed the line.

01:51:53.970 --> 01:52:04.292
It's not enough to say science should be much more humble about its claims, because something that we thought we would get to for the last 150 years, not only have we not gotten to, it baffles us more than ever.

01:52:05.252 --> 01:52:11.334
You guys go on to say, and what we see is evidence of intelligent design.

01:52:12.234 --> 01:52:17.415
I don't know how you can take what I just wrote and suggest that I was suggesting God.

01:52:17.775 --> 01:52:20.496
Why can't we just have a wholly new,

01:52:21.764 --> 01:52:22.604
scientific theory.

01:52:23.104 --> 01:52:24.025
Which would be?

01:52:24.605 --> 01:52:26.105
Which would be, I don't know yet.

01:52:26.385 --> 01:52:27.265
Okay, that's fine.

01:52:27.526 --> 01:52:28.146
I don't know yet.

01:52:28.606 --> 01:52:30.026
That won't satisfy Steve.

01:52:30.166 --> 01:52:31.987
He's not in quite as much trouble as I am.

01:52:32.327 --> 01:52:39.969
And so is this the relevant place to be or is this just a limited spectrum of debate where you think that

01:52:40.649 --> 01:52:44.655
that it's evidence of intelligent design and that means God or Elephant.

01:52:45.436 --> 01:52:49.001
So, a designer not a designer, what does the designer mean?

01:52:49.041 --> 01:52:50.483
Is that divine or not divine?

01:52:50.603 --> 01:52:54.649
He's saying we don't have to evoke that, it just means that our current theory is wrong.

01:52:57.106 --> 01:53:04.189
This guy says that, well, if you find a Swiss watch on the ground, you can't think that it just spontaneously occurred.

01:53:04.249 --> 01:53:07.270
Like there's no way to come to that conclusion.

01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:18.134
If you find a wristwatch ticking on the ground, the first conclusion you shouldn't come to is that that was something that spontaneously occurred.

01:53:18.234 --> 01:53:23.776
Now, it's not a perfect analogy because there aren't Swiss watches everywhere, but there is life everywhere.

01:53:24.727 --> 01:53:28.829
at the microscopic level to the macroscopic level, and it is found everywhere.

01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:35.333
So it's not quite the same thing as finding a Swiss watch and then explaining it as a random occurrence.

01:53:38.235 --> 01:53:53.064
So there are gray areas here and questions that are being asked and debated and thought about, but the foundation, the edifying ideas that make that question seem relevant

01:53:54.042 --> 01:54:00.767
are much more relevant and edifying to the ideas that I've put forth for the last two and a half years.

01:54:01.187 --> 01:54:05.590
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:09.793
Transfection and transformation in healthy humans would be always criminally negligent.

01:54:10.173 --> 01:54:11.874
And RNA can't pandemic.

01:54:11.934 --> 01:54:12.855
That's ridiculous.

01:54:13.295 --> 01:54:15.877
And so the things that these guys say

01:54:16.377 --> 01:54:38.755
are more relevant and more acidic and more useful and more powerful when put into context of biology and where biology meets the road, instead of talking about it in these more philosophical spaces that are relevant to the discussion of faith, are relevant to the discussion of God, but are not relevant to saving our children from the mythology that they are currently trapped in.

01:54:39.355 --> 01:54:45.879
What we have here at this table, Jim Torr, the eminent Jim Torr, thousands of papers and materials that I can't even begin to understand.

01:54:45.999 --> 01:54:50.242
Brilliant man says, it is enough to say we don't know.

01:54:50.542 --> 01:54:51.663
And Steve Meyer replies.

01:54:51.863 --> 01:54:56.726
There's a logic, a scientific logic, that points to the role of intelligence in the origin of life.

01:54:57.619 --> 01:55:12.603
There's a famous information scientist named Henry Quasler, who was one of the first information scientists to apply information theoretic concepts and informational concepts to the analysis of the molecular biology of DNA and RNA.

01:55:12.703 --> 01:55:19.244
And he said that the creation of new information is habitually associated with conscious activity.

01:55:19.905 --> 01:55:24.926
That's what we know from our uniform and repeated experience, which is the basis of all scientific reasoning.

01:55:25.766 --> 01:55:31.794
In my PhD thesis, I studied the methods of historical scientific reasoning, pioneered by, among others, Charles Darwin.

01:55:32.586 --> 01:55:44.056
And the key idea there in historical science is that if we want to explain an event in the remote past, we want to invoke, we want to explain it by reference to causes which are known to produce the effect in question.

01:55:44.877 --> 01:55:53.045
And I came across this principle first in one of Darwin's mentors, Charles Lyell, the great geologist, who said essentially that.

01:55:53.225 --> 01:55:54.266
And I asked myself a question.

01:55:54.306 --> 01:55:57.889
I said, well, what are the, the Lyellian phrase was,

01:55:58.469 --> 01:56:00.590
by reference to causes now in operation.

01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:04.031
That's what we want to explain, past events by reference to causes now in operation.

01:56:04.492 --> 01:56:10.714
And I ask myself a question, what is the cause now in operation for the construction of specified information or a digital code?

01:56:11.855 --> 01:56:12.775
And I can think of only one.

01:56:13.636 --> 01:56:20.803
And I ended up writing a 500-page book looking at all the different proposals that had been made for explaining the origin of that digital code.

01:56:20.863 --> 01:56:25.047
And all of them came up short either theoretically, empirically, or both.

01:56:25.848 --> 01:56:30.753
But we do know of a cause that produces specified information, and that cause is intelligence.

01:56:30.793 --> 01:56:31.193
It's mind.

01:56:31.934 --> 01:56:43.343
And so using the Darwinian logic of the historical sciences, it's actually possible to affirm the intelligent design as the best explanation for the origin of information.

01:56:43.383 --> 01:56:57.455
Whenever we see information and we trace it back to its ultimate source, whether we're talking about computer code or information in a radio signal or hieroglyphic inscription or a paragraph in a book, we always come to a mind, not a material process.

01:56:57.955 --> 01:56:59.657
And so the discovery of information

01:57:00.217 --> 01:57:10.159
in a digital form, in a specified form of information at the foundation of life, I argue, provides a powerful indicator of the activity of a designing mind in the origin of life.

01:57:10.179 --> 01:57:14.500
And that's using the standard historical scientific method of reasoning that Darwin himself used.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:15.021
OK.

01:57:15.621 --> 01:57:29.024
As far as I can tell, so you cross one line, but you do stop short of another line, meaning you're not going to start talking about God and say that this proves the existence of the God of the Hebrew scriptures, or the God of the Baptists, or the God of the Presbyteries.

01:57:29.284 --> 01:57:29.404
No.

01:57:30.569 --> 01:57:40.344
it's intelligence, and there's a long, long way from what we can say must have been involved in forming DNA.

01:57:40.804 --> 01:57:42.467
There's a huge distance from that to

01:57:43.936 --> 01:57:46.517
Hinduism to any known religion.

01:57:46.798 --> 01:57:49.599
And so you're being within your own life.

01:57:49.619 --> 01:57:51.920
In my work on the origin of life.

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.001
You're quite modest.

01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:54.362
You draw lines yourself.

01:57:54.402 --> 01:57:54.822
Is that right?

01:57:55.022 --> 01:58:04.487
Well, in the book Signature in the Cell, I argued for the need for an intelligent agent of some kind to explain the origin of the first information necessary to produce the first life.

01:58:04.967 --> 01:58:12.733
I do think you can make further arguments that point not just to a mind of some kind, but to a sort of a generic theistic understanding of God.

01:58:12.753 --> 01:58:17.657
But you have to bring the cosmology and the physics and the fine-tuning and the origin of the universe.

01:58:17.677 --> 01:58:22.340
And so I have a subsequent book that actually looks at the question, what is the identity of the designing intelligence?

01:58:22.861 --> 01:58:25.563
And that book is The Return of the God Hypothesis.

01:58:25.643 --> 01:58:33.589
But in Signature in the Cell, I argue that a mind of some kind is required based on our uniform and repeated experience of what it takes to cause

01:58:34.591 --> 01:58:37.272
the origin of information, specified information.

01:58:37.972 --> 01:58:41.433
Okay, Dr. Tour, are you down for any of this program?

01:58:41.473 --> 01:58:48.015
Or do you want to just say... Well, I mean, I wish you could see what I see.

01:58:49.375 --> 01:58:57.217
Because then you would, even if you just take a cell, very simple cell, and you ask scientists to look at this cell,

01:58:58.575 --> 01:58:59.536
What is going on?

01:59:00.276 --> 01:59:05.219
If you just put molecules, align them in that way, is it going to run?

01:59:05.239 --> 01:59:06.980
Is it going to operate?

01:59:07.441 --> 01:59:10.523
We don't even know what got this cell going.

01:59:11.724 --> 01:59:15.266
I want you to think for a second about a watch.

01:59:17.928 --> 01:59:21.650
And again, I just want to point out one little thing here, one little analogy.

01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:23.051
I'll wind it up right now.

01:59:26.571 --> 01:59:27.892
One little analogy, okay.

01:59:27.912 --> 01:59:30.634
I'm just going to show you this one from the inside so you can see.

01:59:33.756 --> 01:59:34.897
One little analogy here.

01:59:37.379 --> 01:59:38.100
This is a watch.

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.901
You can see it's ticking.

01:59:40.161 --> 01:59:41.402
It's got a stopwatch.

01:59:42.303 --> 01:59:44.504
It's got a split hand, you know, this kind of thing, right?

01:59:45.225 --> 01:59:52.250
So if we look at the back and we open it up, and this will probably give me hell now.

01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:54.672
It won't open like I want it to open because I'm doing it live.

01:59:57.159 --> 01:59:58.280
But there's a little lip here.

02:00:00.181 --> 02:00:00.641
There we go.

02:00:02.702 --> 02:00:07.826
If we take a look at the inner workings of the watch, you're going to see one thing in particular.

02:00:07.886 --> 02:00:09.827
This little wheel here going back and forth.

02:00:11.228 --> 02:00:16.211
And the wheel going back and forth here is dependent on a spring that's coiled around here.

02:00:16.251 --> 02:00:18.832
And actually that spring can be screwed up really easy.

02:00:18.872 --> 02:00:22.395
And you won't be, if you're not trained, you won't even be able to see

02:00:23.766 --> 02:00:31.729
that that spring is bent in a way that doesn't allow the perpetual motion of the winding to come through the whole mechanism.

02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:52.937
And so what I'm just pointing out is that just the workings of a simple watch have all kinds of nuances and subtleties that despite the fact that you could take a small screwdriver and take this whole damn thing apart and if you were really careful you could put it all back together again.

02:00:54.130 --> 02:01:06.663
And when you reassembled it, it might not work the way you thought it was going to work, even though you were meticulous in taking it apart and meticulous in keeping track of what came after, what came after, and what came on top of, what came on top of.

02:01:07.924 --> 02:01:14.631
Because the little spring that allows that wheel to move perpetually was just bent a little bit when you moved it off of the mount.

02:01:15.834 --> 02:01:19.656
just bent in such a way that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.

02:01:19.676 --> 02:01:30.123
And your understanding of the moving of the clock, even though you took it all apart, put it all back together, and you even did it 10 times, would still be insufficient to diagnose the problem.

02:01:34.766 --> 02:01:43.351
Now I want you to try again, just as James Tour is suggesting to you, to think about a single cell, a single neuron in the brain.

02:01:44.491 --> 02:01:46.372
shoot a single synapse in the brain.

02:01:47.513 --> 02:02:07.869
We're talking about irreducible complexities that all probably have a spring and a pivot and weights and gears that are all subtly dependent on one another in order to make what happens on the front that you can measure and see happen as you expect it to happen.

02:02:12.264 --> 02:02:25.316
And even though you understand how the buttons work and how they reset, and you think you took the watch apart and put it back together again, now that it's not running, you have no idea why it's not running, even though it has all the parts it needs.

02:02:26.016 --> 02:02:27.197
And you were very careful.

02:02:29.739 --> 02:02:39.088
And so James Tour makes that argument very, very effectively with regard to a single cell and the fact that they can't assemble a single cell.

02:02:40.484 --> 02:02:48.255
never mind the macro systems that they assemble into, he's happy to say that all the parts of the cell have information in them that we don't understand.

02:02:49.657 --> 02:02:55.605
But he's unable to then make the easy bridge to where this

02:02:57.557 --> 02:03:13.893
horrible exaggeration of understanding is actually applied in a malevolent way to make billions of dollars move in particular ways and to make people believe very particular mythologies that include a vaccine schedule that's criminal.

02:03:15.674 --> 02:03:20.639
And he would be devastating at making that argument, but he never will.

02:03:22.455 --> 02:03:22.836
Don't know.

02:03:23.477 --> 02:03:25.240
I mean, so you should ask a scientist.

02:03:25.982 --> 02:03:27.004
A cell just died.

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.133
What is it we just lost?

02:03:29.673 --> 02:03:33.554
I mean, all the molecules are right there, and could you get it going again?

02:03:33.875 --> 02:03:39.496
We don't even know how to describe what life really is when it comes to even a simple cell.

02:03:39.896 --> 02:03:40.976
We don't even know that.

02:03:41.316 --> 02:03:42.877
That's how clueless we are.

02:03:43.257 --> 02:03:55.780
I wish you could see this, because you... That's how clueless we are, and that's why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system has pretty much always been dumb.

02:03:57.014 --> 02:04:13.587
and why transfection and transformation in healthy humans, even old ones was criminally negligent for the same reasons that he's explaining why origin of life studies and synthetic cells and synthetic life is all bullshit.

02:04:15.869 --> 02:04:18.651
Same reason why vaccine schedule in America is criminal.

02:04:19.833 --> 02:04:27.861
Why any lawyer that's not arguing for strict liability for all pharmaceutical products and has any following at all on social media is a meddler.

02:04:28.481 --> 02:04:40.813
Why anybody who claims to be a lawyer and is not arguing for our Seventh Amendment right to be restored and some of these legislations to be struck as unconstitutional is not fighting for our grandchildren.

02:04:41.234 --> 02:04:44.077
And anybody that knows this much about how to express

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:57.527
with eloquence the irreducible complexity that is our biology but refuses to apply it to any meaningful places where people are being hurt by these exaggerations is also not playing for our team.

02:04:57.607 --> 02:04:59.529
You don't understand the magnitude

02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:06.632
of the human deficiency and even understanding what life is in the simplest of organisms.

02:05:06.692 --> 02:05:11.335
And people will say, well, life was much simpler at the start of the evolutionary process.

02:05:11.615 --> 02:05:12.936
This has already been calculated.

02:05:13.016 --> 02:05:18.098
Bioengineers have already figured out what is the minimal operation that you need.

02:05:18.118 --> 02:05:22.020
What are the fewest components that you need to have a cell operating?

02:05:22.501 --> 02:05:24.782
And you take that and, OK, so

02:05:25.262 --> 02:05:38.248
Let's say we make... Ralph Baric is responsible for codifying the number of minimum products that you need, minimum parts you need for a self-replicating RNA to exist.

02:05:38.848 --> 02:05:40.189
That's about the best I can say.

02:05:40.269 --> 02:05:46.592
A successfully transfectable self-replicating RNA signal needs these components.

02:05:46.652 --> 02:05:47.772
That's all he's done.

02:05:48.293 --> 02:05:50.754
And that has been misconstrued as

02:05:51.534 --> 02:05:55.858
gain-of-function RNA virology and pandemic potential in a dish.

02:05:56.959 --> 02:06:00.422
And he could explain that very well if he wanted to.

02:06:00.822 --> 02:06:05.006
All of those components, by the way, none of those 15 components have been made.

02:06:05.406 --> 02:06:05.806
None of them.

02:06:06.247 --> 02:06:09.089
Now, if you could make them, now what would you do?

02:06:09.129 --> 02:06:10.811
Under realistic prebiotic conditions.

02:06:10.871 --> 02:06:15.435
Yeah, even if you could make them in your current lab, I'll give them their own labs, make them.

02:06:17.088 --> 02:06:18.529
or just take them from a living cell.

02:06:18.829 --> 02:06:22.130
Go to a living cell, use that as your supply chain.

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:23.431
Take it from a living cell.

02:06:23.711 --> 02:06:24.951
Now, what do you do?

02:06:25.391 --> 02:06:26.792
Just putting them in proximity.

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:27.532
I agree.

02:06:27.632 --> 02:06:28.793
Send this stream to him.

02:06:29.253 --> 02:06:31.934
I mean, I'm happy to have him on the podcast.

02:06:32.014 --> 02:06:34.235
It would be great, but he won't come on.

02:06:35.395 --> 02:06:38.537
Because these people know what they can say and what they can't say.

02:06:38.978 --> 02:06:41.239
They understand the limited spectrum of debate.

02:06:41.319 --> 02:06:42.640
That's how they got where they are.

02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:50.905
I believe that no scientist in their right mind would have said yes to transfection and transformation had they sat down and thought about it logically.

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:01.871
But they didn't, because they were coerced with fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

02:07:02.312 --> 02:07:14.797
And a whole theater of monkey people, like Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and all these other people claiming to be dissidents, effectively making everything part of the trap.

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:20.126
That's why immunomythology still exists.

02:07:20.166 --> 02:07:39.185
That's why all these Academy magicians are still trapped in their universities, because people who could save them, like this guy, are also agreeing not to talk about where the biology meets the road, where the kids are actually being hurt, where the young adults are actually being fooled, and how it actually affects their lives.

02:07:39.545 --> 02:07:43.166
You don't know how to put them together, but even if you could, now how does it even start running?

02:07:43.466 --> 02:07:50.328
We don't even know what we're going toward, which gets back to that philosophical experiment that his professor was talking about.

02:07:50.668 --> 02:07:52.589
What are we going toward in life?

02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:54.409
We don't even know what life is.

02:07:54.729 --> 02:07:56.190
Molecules don't care about life.

02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:59.271
Molecules, they don't move toward life.

02:07:59.551 --> 02:08:02.532
There's no propensity for a molecule to move toward life.

02:08:02.852 --> 02:08:03.852
It has no brain.

02:08:04.192 --> 02:08:06.633
It has no action that wants to bring it toward life.

02:08:06.973 --> 02:08:07.453
They don't know.

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:09.053
I don't know what you want me to do.

02:08:09.333 --> 02:08:10.054
I'm just here.

02:08:10.414 --> 02:08:10.914
What do I do?

02:08:11.474 --> 02:08:17.116
And then even if we could say, I want you to move toward life, you'd be like, OK, just tell me which direction to go.

02:08:17.136 --> 02:08:18.656
I don't know.

02:08:18.676 --> 02:08:23.358
Jim has an amazing talk looking at some of the prebiotic experiments.

02:08:23.798 --> 02:08:27.999
And they're basically implementing complicated recipes.

02:08:28.019 --> 02:08:30.000
They start with purified chemical reagents.

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.780
I don't think it's worth watching anymore.

02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:36.762
I think they're going to keep talking about the same thing over and over again, which is actually this.

02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:41.933
beyond evolution and unraveling the origins of life.

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:53.708
The main message of this stream is that if these people understand that the irreducible complexity of life means that talking about the origins of life is dumb, that

02:08:54.329 --> 02:08:59.891
claiming to have solved the origins of life is a gross over-exaggeration of their understanding.

02:09:00.351 --> 02:09:07.953
To claim that you create synthetic life is also a gross exaggeration of their ability and also their understanding.

02:09:08.313 --> 02:09:14.255
And yet these people are very limited in their application of this to academic

02:09:16.604 --> 02:09:34.990
academia as a whole, but instead focus exclusively on origin of life experiments and chemistry of life experiments, instead of saying that, well, on the other end of the spectrum, where the thing is most complicated, where the pattern integrity is the most complicated, where healthy humans are concerned,

02:09:36.092 --> 02:09:46.751
We are definitely exaggerating our understanding and the worst expression of this exaggeration is the arrogance with which we vaccinate children in America.

02:09:48.117 --> 02:10:08.799
And if these guys could use their extreme skill in orating and discussing the irreducible complexity of life and apply it to something meaningful, we would get out of here really quick because a lot of people that follow them would come to an instant consensus that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:10:09.818 --> 02:10:16.840
worse than the previous vaccine schedule, which was already a criminal enterprise from a legal perspective and a biological one.

02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:27.982
And the fact that RNA cannot pandemic and that there is, you know, this is the inverse, the idea that RNA can't pandemic is the inverse of an irreducible complexity.

02:10:28.022 --> 02:10:39.385
And in fact, it means that chemistry can do what life can do, and it can't, and these guys know it, and they could be where we were and we are if they wanted to be, but they're not because they are probably

02:10:39.906 --> 02:10:44.293
wittingly or unwittingly part of this limited spectrum of debate.

02:10:44.313 --> 02:10:51.725
If you like this discussion, please share stream.gigaom.bio if you liked it and want to support the stream.

02:10:51.765 --> 02:10:53.628
People like Brian who just sent a

02:10:55.512 --> 02:10:56.673
A lot of cash in the mail.

02:10:56.713 --> 02:10:57.874
Thank you very much, Brian.

02:10:58.254 --> 02:10:59.135
Thank you, Rocky.

02:10:59.596 --> 02:11:00.596
Thank you, Catherine.

02:11:01.137 --> 02:11:01.958
Thank you, Cindy.

02:11:02.738 --> 02:11:09.404
Thank you to all the people that are filling my box with self-addressed stamped envelopes as well.

02:11:10.265 --> 02:11:14.389
The bigger stickers that are corrected are coming tomorrow and today, I think,

02:11:14.969 --> 02:11:25.077
There's a possibility that the patches are here, so the self-addressed stamped envelopes are going to start to go out with lots of gear and merch, and what do you call it?

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.061
Swag is what I would like to call it.

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:30.762
It's not merch because we're not selling it.

02:11:31.203 --> 02:11:33.364
So, gigaohm swag is almost available.

02:11:33.464 --> 02:11:37.208
Stickers for your water bottle or for your car, I guess, if you do that kind of thing.

02:11:38.388 --> 02:11:41.449
And again, if you want to chat or hang out, GigaOM.bio.

02:11:41.949 --> 02:11:54.833
And if you want to find a way to support the stream, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and do so because, yeah, I need all the support that I can get because I'm not supported by Substack or by a weaponized pile of money.

02:11:55.754 --> 02:11:59.055
And I'm coming to the conclusions that nobody else wants you to come to.

02:12:00.455 --> 02:12:01.015
Thanks very much.

02:12:01.095 --> 02:12:02.276
I'll see you again tomorrow, I hope.

02:12:46.576 --> 02:12:52.400
Don't forget we're having a live event on November 3rd in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

02:12:52.480 --> 02:13:01.486
If you want to come and see a live broadcast of Giga Ohm Biological, maybe share some food and drink with fellow Ohmies.

02:13:03.107 --> 02:13:08.911
Freedom is measured in ohms, and freedom is measured in being in person.

02:13:08.951 --> 02:13:09.712
So if you can,

02:13:10.912 --> 02:13:18.217
Maybe find a way to be in Pittsburgh on the 3rd of November and join us for food, drink, for celebration.

02:13:20.279 --> 02:13:24.942
And again, if you want to send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the P.O.

02:13:24.982 --> 02:13:32.387
Box 802 Bethel Park, PA 15102, I'll stuff it with a bunch of stickers.

02:13:32.767 --> 02:13:39.392
And if you send a really big envelope, I can put a hat in it too, but not too many people send big envelopes because I don't have that many hats.

02:13:40.715 --> 02:13:41.376
Thank you very much.

02:13:42.238 --> 02:13:42.558
Thank you.

02:13:42.619 --> 02:13:44.302
Thank you for sharing the stream.

02:13:44.442 --> 02:13:45.484
We need more followers.

02:13:45.524 --> 02:13:46.666
We need more subscribers.

02:13:46.746 --> 02:13:48.449
So do what you can to share.

02:13:48.509 --> 02:13:49.070
Thanks very much.
