WEBVTT

00:01.618 --> 00:01.999
Testing 1, 2, 3.

00:02.160 --> 00:03.363
Let's get this done.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.639
So the real question is, how did we get here?

00:27.059 --> 00:29.881
And I think the answer is scripted bullshit.

00:30.201 --> 00:31.202
That's what I think it is.

00:31.282 --> 00:36.424
I think the answer is pretty elaborate scripted bullshit on the internet.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.206
And it's still active right now.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.367
That's the only thing they've got.

00:42.408 --> 00:43.868
I think it's very obvious.

00:43.928 --> 00:45.049
Christy, good to see you.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.370
Soulifier, good to see you.

00:46.390 --> 00:48.451
There's always this dropdown thing here.

00:49.351 --> 00:49.992
Dismiss.

00:50.092 --> 00:50.632
There we go.

00:50.672 --> 00:53.375
Hey, Atari mama was the first in the chat.

00:54.315 --> 00:58.959
Solar fire, garden variety, human, lots of familiar names.

01:02.142 --> 01:04.343
I know that you know this, but we're going to keep going with it.

01:04.383 --> 01:09.468
Science magazine, John Cohen, covered the bird flu vaccines.

01:11.890 --> 01:16.974
And there was some other articles about this new push for mRNA vaccines for bird flu.

01:19.775 --> 01:27.479
The statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology.

01:27.599 --> 01:42.546
I want to address this claim here today that, you know, I'm not only saying that Robert Malone and Dell Bigtree are a joke on America, but actually the number of players that has been enlisted is quite many.

01:43.786 --> 01:46.367
It includes the former vice presidential candidate.

01:46.427 --> 01:53.669
It includes the longtime hero of heroes, the ultimate anti-vaxxer, Andrew Wakefield.

01:53.729 --> 01:58.911
And it includes this new Bitcoin doctor polymath guy, Dr. Jack Cruz.

01:59.011 --> 02:04.033
And so whether he's a witting or unwitting participant, I'm quite sure that

02:05.433 --> 02:09.376
The the best explanation would be that when he reads books, he believes them.

02:09.436 --> 02:12.338
And one of the only books he's read is Dr. Mary's Monkey.

02:12.598 --> 02:13.999
But I don't think that's the case.

02:14.059 --> 02:15.159
I think it's worse than that.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.941
I think it's all really scripted bullshit.

02:18.522 --> 02:21.203
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

02:21.483 --> 02:23.385
Do you believe, you know, because.

02:25.046 --> 02:29.469
I mean, do you still do you believe that some vaccines are good?

02:32.150 --> 02:32.210
OK.

02:34.525 --> 02:37.707
Generally speaking, are you a pro-vaccine person?

02:38.808 --> 02:39.088
Yes.

02:39.188 --> 02:57.381
I think as a hematologist oncologist who took care of immunocompromised patients as an attending for a decade, including many people post-autologous stem cell transplant, I am a extreme pro-vaccine person because these patients who are immunocompromised are extremely vulnerable and they benefit from vaccination in myriad ways.

02:57.681 --> 03:00.203
And we pursue vaccination in people post-transplant

03:00.803 --> 03:04.226
with the same vigor and commitment that pediatricians pursue vaccination.

03:04.266 --> 03:04.946
It's an important thing.

03:05.827 --> 03:11.311
But again, vaccine... In condition that we will not call autism.

03:11.451 --> 03:13.012
I don't like the word autism.

03:13.893 --> 03:14.953
He was vaccine damaged.

03:15.294 --> 03:16.735
He was neurologically damaged.

03:17.635 --> 03:20.217
In condition that we will not call autism.

03:20.357 --> 03:21.578
I don't like the word autism.

03:22.270 --> 03:37.696
So it's an illusion of consensus that's created by these people that are recruited, or they get unwittingly absorbed into the narrative, get positive reinforcement from whatever mechanism suits them, or else they disappear.

03:38.476 --> 03:50.620
And so although I've tried very hard to talk to people in all of these organizations, they all agree to ignore me or listen to me and then never, never speak of me again.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.620
And it's not about me.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.761
It's about the biology.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.262
They all want it to be about JJ, but it's not about JJ.

03:57.782 --> 04:00.083
It's about what JJ says.

04:00.303 --> 04:05.064
And more importantly, it's what Brian Hooker says and what Brian Hooker used to say.

04:05.284 --> 04:06.204
The word autism.

04:07.085 --> 04:08.125
He was vaccine damaged.

04:08.505 --> 04:13.367
He was neurologically damaged, in condition that we will not call autism.

04:13.527 --> 04:15.067
I don't like the word autism.

04:15.967 --> 04:16.848
He was vaccine damaged.

04:17.008 --> 04:21.029
And so Brian is one of these guys who had to be absorbed, who has agreed to go along with it.

04:21.069 --> 04:25.090
Maybe it's, you know, he had only a few choices and they weren't very good.

04:25.210 --> 04:26.491
And so it's tough that

04:27.091 --> 04:42.302
It's unfortunate that he's one of the weak points in their narrative, but he is because of his experience more than 16 years as a genetic modifier of plants for use in production of medicine before his child was damaged.

04:42.362 --> 04:43.903
And so his sort of

04:46.645 --> 04:48.507
narrative has changed in the wrong way.

04:48.527 --> 04:53.511
His understanding of this issue has changed in the wrong way.

04:54.132 --> 05:13.689
And it has moved from being a guy who didn't use the word autism because he understood that that's ridiculous with regard to intramuscular injection, but he got closer and closer to just being this guy who I met and understood as a dude who just thought that the way to win was to establish a big top tent of health freedom.

05:17.342 --> 05:20.645
It's been a rude awakening for me because I thought Brian Hooker was a hero.

05:21.726 --> 05:28.091
And I thought a lot of these people were heroes, but they're in fact on a script and you're not going to change it.

05:28.331 --> 05:29.211
You can capture it.

05:29.271 --> 05:30.132
You can sequence it.

05:30.192 --> 05:32.914
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

05:32.934 --> 05:37.118
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.238
You can capture it.

05:38.298 --> 05:39.159
You can sequence it.

05:39.219 --> 05:41.401
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

05:41.641 --> 05:56.936
More important to understand is that that script was only written by a few of these people, only needs to be understood by a few of these people, and the rest of them just have to jolly well go along for all the benefits of going along with such an international, perhaps NATO-coordinated narrative.

05:58.155 --> 06:12.335
And it is a very, very big pile of scripted bullshit, and it only takes a fraction of the people on the screen to actually be on the script, even a portion of the script, for the rest of the people to get sucked along.

06:12.916 --> 06:13.757
Never mind...

06:14.538 --> 06:29.449
all of the unwitting participants on social media that in addition to not being on script or officially in the cast list, they are also thinking that they're using social media to interact effectively with these people when in fact they are not.

06:32.030 --> 06:35.813
And so it's a very fascinating place that we are right now.

06:36.574 --> 06:37.214
Oh, darn it.

06:37.234 --> 06:38.175
I didn't fix that.

06:38.435 --> 06:40.717
I have to fix that, but I'm not going to do it right now.

06:40.937 --> 06:41.797
I can do it right now.

06:41.877 --> 06:42.178
Why not?

06:43.487 --> 06:54.616
That should be A. And that should be, let's see, let's use this book to focus it.

06:56.297 --> 06:58.059
And we've got to turn it on first.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.560
Oh, it's already focused.

06:59.580 --> 06:59.840
Oh, no.

07:00.881 --> 07:01.922
It should be right here about.

07:03.697 --> 07:04.577
There we go.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.217
Great book.

07:05.597 --> 07:06.177
Awesome book.

07:06.658 --> 07:09.338
Totally exposes everybody and all the narratives of it.

07:09.378 --> 07:10.278
Good morning, everybody.

07:10.318 --> 07:11.058
Welcome to the show.

07:11.939 --> 07:13.959
This is a recent video that was posted.

07:13.979 --> 07:16.820
I don't think the video was like recorded yesterday.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.740
It's from the Maha podcast.

07:19.420 --> 07:25.241
It's Del Bigtree in a lovely jacket and turtleneck combination.

07:25.741 --> 07:28.962
And he's talking to the head or the,

07:29.722 --> 07:41.110
director, or I don't know what she is, Tess Laurie, who is the lady that runs the World Council for Health, which is a very strange organization.

07:42.151 --> 07:46.394
And this woman is a very strange woman that gets promoted in a myriad of ways.

07:47.694 --> 08:09.640
She might be an unwitting participant, but she is an unwitting participant who has been fooled by the rest of these people to accept this narrative that, number one, placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard of pharmaceutical industry, you know, whatever, and they've never been used on the childhood vaccine schedule.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.841
You know, cue the Home Alone pose.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.844
and everybody gets, oh my goodness.

08:15.924 --> 08:21.952
But there is a fundamental problem with this that I pointed out a couple weeks ago because it just hit me in the head then.

08:23.193 --> 08:30.323
But if you know and understand that intramuscular injection in children

08:31.408 --> 08:38.350
is the primary cause or the only cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and they claim to have known that for a while.

08:39.130 --> 08:55.314
Just like they claim to have known that autism in the cases that they are talking about, most concerned about, does not take months and months to onset, but many of these parents tell a story of an extremely fast change in their kid.

08:56.397 --> 08:59.961
which would not require any long-term placebo-controlled trial.

09:00.001 --> 09:03.364
It might only require a two-week long placebo-controlled trial.

09:03.865 --> 09:16.097
But for the last 15 years, these people have been having an ineffective debate with people like Paul Offit because Paul Offit says long-term placebo-controlled trials are unethical.

09:17.096 --> 09:25.863
because then the kids will get measles, the kids will get pertussis, the kids will get all these diseases that they otherwise would never have to deal with if they just got vaccines.

09:26.043 --> 09:30.066
And so it's unethical to do the things that these people are asking for.

09:30.187 --> 09:39.214
And it is a hamster wheel that if you do not understand its construction, you will get stuck in it just like it appears Teslauri is stuck in it.

09:43.345 --> 09:46.747
differently than you did when you were first looking at it through COVID.

09:47.227 --> 09:51.350
Has your mind shifted on what's going on?

09:51.370 --> 10:03.276
Yeah, I mean, well, I think it's just been amazing to really hear that and to see that there were never placebo-controlled trials done on the childhood vaccine.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.858
So it does, you know, make you do a whole sort of

10:07.168 --> 10:21.520
were those need to stop those injections need to stop until we have some safety day but those are all the injections those injections need to stop those are all the injections what are you talking about then

10:23.206 --> 10:27.107
And so then she goes on to say, they have to stop until what?

10:28.027 --> 10:48.292
That shows that you can not only give one of those and stop, those injections need to stop until we have some safety data that shows that you can not only give one of those injections with all the, you know, two or three different, what do you call it?

10:48.512 --> 10:50.052
Adjuvants, or yeah.

10:50.173 --> 10:51.913
No, you know, like the DPT

10:53.234 --> 10:56.457
See, so she's still struggling to catch up with this narrative.

10:56.497 --> 11:10.872
She's not a biologist and it makes at least somewhat logical sense that maybe it's the combination of vaccines, which is of course what somebody like Suzanne Humphries has been saying for literally a decade.

11:10.972 --> 11:15.257
Something like Brian Hooker has been saying for literally a decade.

11:15.717 --> 11:30.102
And so they're still trying to decide whether it's really a baseball bat to the head that's bad for you, or whether it's our recent, more recent development that we actually hit kids with multiple, we give multiple hits with the baseball bat on the same day.

11:30.563 --> 11:32.363
Because maybe that's the real cause.

11:32.723 --> 11:38.166
Or maybe it's just a cumulative cause of all these other things that are attached to the baseball bat.

11:38.186 --> 11:42.747
You know, like the tape we put around it, or the extra donut for weight, because we're warming up.

11:43.087 --> 11:44.128
Like, what the hell?

11:44.688 --> 11:53.664
is going on here other than Del Bigtree, one of the masters of the hamster wheel, keeping another hamster in the wheel.

11:55.134 --> 11:57.155
you know, three diseases in one sort of thing.

11:57.776 --> 12:01.498
Not only that, but you know, where is the evidence to show you can give them all together?

12:01.518 --> 12:05.021
You know, you can give three at the same time, three injections or two injections.

12:05.081 --> 12:10.884
So, you know, the whole, the cumulative effect has never been studied either.

12:11.004 --> 12:15.848
So that's, you know, that's really important that we stop those.

12:16.048 --> 12:20.371
And World Council of Health put out a cease and, I mean, a statement.

12:20.451 --> 12:21.752
I mean, it's absurd, right?

12:22.572 --> 12:38.237
This is the exact argument that was made back in the UK in the 90s with Andrew Wakefield that maybe we should separate the MMR into the M, the M, and the R. And then at the same time, Merck decided not to make the M anymore.

12:38.277 --> 12:40.158
And that was totally a conspiracy.

12:42.918 --> 12:48.482
And so now, the giant hamster wheel has turned for ten and a half years, and here we are back again.

12:48.522 --> 12:58.390
Now, the rung of the wheels that are holding us in, one of them's the same, one of them's a new one, but it doesn't matter, you can't tell, because it's a cognitive hamster wheel.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.413
It doesn't matter what people are part of it.

13:01.973 --> 13:02.874
You're trapped in it.

13:03.314 --> 13:20.317
And to really recommend to parents to just caution when it comes to childhood vaccines, especially now that the drug companies are big fans of this new genetic technology, these mRNAs and that.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.398
So we're just saying just caution.

13:22.438 --> 13:24.078
You don't need to give your kids anything.

13:24.118 --> 13:26.419
Just keep their immune systems healthy, you know.

13:27.939 --> 13:29.460
and they'll be fine.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.824
Certainly as a mom, I regret vaccinating my children.

13:34.544 --> 13:39.528
They didn't get the COVID shots, but they did get all the childhood vaccinations.

13:39.728 --> 13:46.033
And I know that their health, now I know that their health has suffered as a consequence.

13:46.073 --> 13:52.458
So I regret that and I have to forgive myself for that because I was ignorant and I didn't know any better.

13:52.978 --> 14:07.490
I like this, this is okay, but you know, the problem is, and I want to remind you of how dire the problem is, that if you think that this is getting out on social media, you would be wrong.

14:08.631 --> 14:16.458
And social media is exquisitely designed to make sure that only people that hear this are the people that already believe it.

14:19.474 --> 14:25.542
And she may not even be aware of that, but that's how she was used for the last five years.

14:26.223 --> 14:33.653
That's how they would have used me had I gone along with the lab leak and the Wuhan cover-up book and put that on my merit badge list.

14:36.437 --> 14:40.159
And I assure you, that is how this is sustained.

14:40.199 --> 14:50.603
And the moment you get off social media and no longer allow them to put you under the spell that the truth about the childhood vaccine schedule is starting to leak out.

14:52.784 --> 15:03.208
Please recall that at one point in time, Peter McCullough dared to say that on some random Christian podcast, that if I was gonna do it again, I don't think I would give my kids any of the vaccines on the schedule.

15:03.868 --> 15:05.329
And he never said it again.

15:06.289 --> 15:06.570
Never.

15:09.213 --> 15:15.861
I just want to say to all the mums and dads out there who feel the same, you know, and you're just kicking yourself, don't worry.

15:15.881 --> 15:21.709
You know, we're all on a learning journey and we're all in this together and it'll all be OK in the end.

15:23.863 --> 15:43.798
so that video was actually shared with this video and they were put up and down from each other in social media so it even made it worse because it seemed like Del and Tess and Jimmy and Mary are a four-person consensus about something

15:44.318 --> 15:44.859
And they're not.

15:44.919 --> 15:51.965
It's two separate videos, but because when you acquiesce to social media, all kinds of mind games can be played.

15:52.425 --> 15:57.971
This was put together as a consensus of four people agreeing on the same thing, that they're lying about stuff.

15:58.571 --> 16:02.955
But they're not specific enough to make any real logical progress.

16:03.436 --> 16:04.737
And even the ones

16:06.343 --> 16:11.366
who will give you the excuse that they were taught the standard biology in medical school.

16:11.406 --> 16:13.928
Hey, let me just say this one out loud.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.549
I went to college too.

16:16.809 --> 16:28.436
I got a PhD to learn about the brain and everything that I learned about the brain, I understand it in the context of the limitations of the questions and the irreducible complexity of the brain.

16:28.536 --> 16:29.737
I never, ever,

16:31.331 --> 16:37.758
wandered around in my lifetime claiming to be an expert in the human body, human physiology, and human health.

16:38.239 --> 16:40.041
That's what an MD does.

16:43.317 --> 16:58.541
So if somebody taught you how a car works, but it's not how the car works, and you never bothered to learn enough to figure out that you didn't learn it right at tech school, what does that say about you as a mechanic going through the daily grind at the garage?

16:58.621 --> 17:10.104
Cars coming in, cars going out, and your sort of understanding of the world has this one big hole in it because the stuff that they told you at tech school is not true.

17:14.298 --> 17:27.240
How is it possible that we're not going to allow doctors to get away with this idea where Callie or Casey Means reads this list of what I didn't learn in med school, and then now what?

17:28.908 --> 17:32.831
You're the one who decided you wanted to be an expert in human physiology.

17:32.871 --> 17:37.214
You're the one who decided that you had the big brain to be a brain surgeon.

17:37.274 --> 17:56.489
And if you didn't figure this out over the course of your own work, because you took responsibility as a master or would-be master, then it's pretty pathetic that you're here right now in 2025 and you still can't say it succinctly enough so that a high school senior could go, oh, I get it.

17:58.854 --> 18:01.816
And the reason why that is, is because they're still trapped.

18:01.996 --> 18:03.297
I think Mary is trapped.

18:03.377 --> 18:04.518
I think Jimmy is bought.

18:04.858 --> 18:05.999
Let's see what you think.

18:07.080 --> 18:16.666
Isn't it amazing to you how much they've been able to get people to go along with the big pharma propaganda about the carve out for vaccines?

18:18.147 --> 18:21.469
Well, I was, I'm kind of mad at myself because I never questioned it.

18:21.569 --> 18:23.691
I remember- Very good, Mary.

18:23.791 --> 18:25.992
See, I think Mary could be still trapped.

18:26.112 --> 18:28.674
And it sounded like Tess was also kind of trapped.

18:30.543 --> 18:41.209
You should be mad at yourself, but more importantly, you should realize that that was because you were surrounded by an illusion of consensus that's been created by only a few people being in on the scam.

18:42.049 --> 18:48.653
It is a system-wide consensus that still exists for obvious things like PCR diagnostics.

18:50.594 --> 18:56.858
And so if Mary is still truly trapped, there's still a chance we can throw a rope down to the cave and she can climb out.

18:56.898 --> 18:58.319
And if she were to climb out,

18:59.272 --> 19:01.433
Holy shit, when we have an ally.

19:02.973 --> 19:12.936
Learning about it in medical school, and it was presented as a great victory for vaccines, because vaccines were protected, and it was the gospel according to vaccines.

19:13.616 --> 19:19.978
There was no discussion of any kind of issues, side effects, dangers at all with vaccines.

19:19.998 --> 19:26.520
It was just taken as a fact that vaccines are safe and effective, and they deserve this special protection.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.002
so that nothing could happen to them.

19:30.502 --> 19:35.405
They'd never have a threat to go away.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.827
I never questioned... See, it's kind of a weak excuse, right?

19:38.907 --> 19:48.013
It starts to really fall apart once she starts to talk out loud about it because, again, you're not thinking about the biology.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.314
You accepted something.

19:50.663 --> 20:08.278
and you accepted something that was fundamentally contradictory to everything else you would learn in med school, presumably, about the barriers of the skin and how to respect them and about the, you know, ingestion and the liver and the lymph and all this other stuff, Peyer's patches.

20:08.358 --> 20:11.241
I guess you learned about a lot of things that would

20:12.301 --> 20:16.904
that would be contradictory to this blank slate given to vaccines.

20:16.944 --> 20:28.870
Now, what's funny is that a lot of these people in the fake anti-vax movement have for a long time said that the 1984 Vaccine Act admits that vaccines cause harm.

20:28.910 --> 20:31.091
That's the reason why the law is there.

20:31.171 --> 20:37.255
That's the reason why this lady, her name is, I can see her book down there and I can tell you her name.

20:39.976 --> 20:40.477
Where is it?

20:40.497 --> 20:40.597
Shoot.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.629
Did I pull it off of there now?

20:45.829 --> 20:46.950
It's the one shot in the dark.

20:47.010 --> 20:47.250
Yes.

20:47.430 --> 20:48.470
Her name is Fisher.

20:49.251 --> 20:53.473
Mary, Mary, Barbara, Barbara Lowe Fisher.

20:53.553 --> 21:00.916
Barbara Lowe Fisher says that the 1984 Vaccine Act is, admits that, that, and it's true.

21:00.976 --> 21:03.937
It's in the text that they inevitably cause harm.

21:03.977 --> 21:05.278
And so they need protection.

21:05.318 --> 21:06.979
The manufacturers need protection.

21:07.459 --> 21:08.880
So Mary is still kind of

21:09.560 --> 21:16.286
kind of fumbling the ball here, or at least not adequately informing people about exactly what the rationale is.

21:16.887 --> 21:18.148
It's not just a carve out.

21:18.188 --> 21:24.434
They made a real argument that it was a biosecurity thing, that it was a, and that's how they argue about it in the back room.

21:24.855 --> 21:28.718
If we're not vaccinating anybody, then this will be a national security concern.

21:28.758 --> 21:32.462
So in order to get maximum compliance, we're going to need to do a few things different.

21:33.780 --> 21:38.462
mandating vaccines for children to go to school until the COVID shots came around.

21:39.142 --> 21:47.645
And when you think about it, all medical mandates are fundamentally wrong, but we've gone along with it for so long.

21:48.385 --> 21:57.688
When we take our children and get them shots, vaccinations, only because the school is making us, that's a medical mandate.

21:58.479 --> 21:59.039
And we all did.

21:59.079 --> 21:59.420
We've all.

21:59.660 --> 22:00.501
I mean, I don't know about you.

22:00.521 --> 22:01.221
I can't speak for you.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.663
But the majority of people have gone along with that.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.303
It's hard.

22:04.323 --> 22:14.391
I mean, I don't envy parents of young children because I don't, you know, none of these shots, none of these vaccines have been tested against placebos, saline placebo.

22:14.431 --> 22:17.553
And they haven't been tested where you give six shots in one day.

22:18.274 --> 22:19.595
So it's like a list.

22:20.919 --> 22:24.400
And it's possible that she's not coached on this.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.080
It's possible that that's organic.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.421
But I very, very much doubt it at this point.

22:29.321 --> 22:39.423
Because again, this is a script that somebody like Suzanne Humphreys has been sticking to since the video with Brandy Vaughn and before.

22:39.803 --> 22:40.763
And she has a book from 2013.

22:40.803 --> 22:41.043
Isn't it 13?

22:41.123 --> 22:41.363
Yeah, 2013.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.383
No, no, no, it's not 2013.

22:42.423 --> 22:44.464
It's yeah, yeah, 2013, Dissolving Illusions.

22:44.484 --> 22:45.384
That's the point.

22:53.089 --> 23:04.956
And when they make progress, they make progress on this artificial ladder of logic that was already in place with Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland and James Lyons-Weiler before the pandemic.

23:04.996 --> 23:06.517
These steps were already there.

23:06.577 --> 23:11.420
This bullshit about environmental and genetic causes, it was all there already.

23:12.247 --> 23:16.929
And so all these new people that come off the bench have to climb the ladder from the beginning to the end.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.950
And that's what she seems to be doing.

23:18.990 --> 23:21.852
Now she's realizing, well, maybe it's the combination of shots.

23:22.292 --> 23:27.294
And soon it will be about adjuvants and the toxic tipping point or some shit.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.516
So it's a dilemma.

23:30.696 --> 23:39.020
And what I'm telling my patients is, maybe hold off until hopefully Robert F. Kennedy will straighten that out and we get some real data.

23:40.635 --> 23:43.256
So they all think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.597
is going to bring some data.

23:45.678 --> 23:53.202
Some data about exactly how many baseball bats to the head are good for kids and how early can we give them.

24:01.906 --> 24:04.807
I think that was the end of that video, and I don't even know what to say.

24:04.827 --> 24:06.748
This is GigaOM Biological.

24:06.768 --> 24:08.008
Thank you very much for joining me.

24:08.028 --> 24:13.390
I want to kind of give another kind of shot for the fence.

24:13.930 --> 24:20.092
Remember that I say that this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, which is visible in the population pyramid,

24:20.692 --> 24:23.775
was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies.

24:23.875 --> 24:41.290
Lies about, you know, a viral pneumonia that antibiotics would be inappropriate for, a viral multi-organ syndrome for which antibiotics would be inappropriate, so that if it was also urinary tract infection or kidney failure or any of these other things that happened, they would never treat an infection.

24:43.737 --> 24:50.207
And that resulted in the graph that you see right here, which is a two-year temporary loss in control of death.

24:52.891 --> 24:58.039
And then suddenly right back to baseline, I guess we know, oh, I know how to do pneumonia, that's right.

24:59.659 --> 25:13.560
And so on top of that sculpted additional pneumonia deaths in the conveniently old population that we didn't want to give a lot of Medicaid and Medicare to, we didn't want to give a lot of social security to anyway.

25:14.588 --> 25:21.972
We can use supplementary oxygen to tip them over that viral pneumonia hill, and a lot of these people will die.

25:22.052 --> 25:23.953
But, you know, why stop there?

25:24.273 --> 25:31.998
Because if we stop there, then we'll only have old people dying, and that won't work, because then these people will have a story about how it only affects old people and the vulnerable.

25:32.952 --> 25:49.281
And so we can let opioid deaths go bananas for about five years, and 100,000, give or take, every year, a lot of them below the age of 40, will contribute significantly to a lowered life expectancy, which we can then really hype up and call a novel virus.

25:50.581 --> 26:01.247
And of course, the foundation of all of this belief was that there was some kind of high fidelity molecular biological tool set that we could use to track this novel virus, and in fact, we were.

26:04.522 --> 26:12.839
And this illusion was an elaborate national security, multinational, probably NATO-coordinated theater.

26:15.618 --> 26:20.140
It's about turning these populations into experimental animals.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.281
And you can see it right here.

26:21.361 --> 26:27.204
These are the men and the women in America displayed from ages 0 to 4, all the way up to 100.

26:27.244 --> 26:31.927
And so you can see how our population has changed over the last few decades.

26:31.967 --> 26:35.909
And you can see that there's an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality coming.

26:36.775 --> 26:47.184
where this retirement age group, this number of people that might need extra visits to the hospital, look at it growing, look at it growing, look at it exploding.

26:47.204 --> 26:49.245
You don't think these people saw this coming?

26:49.285 --> 26:57.492
You don't think the big thinkers were gonna use this phenomenon, this anticipated rise in all cause mortality for something?

26:58.413 --> 27:03.718
They put a team of performers with elaborate costumes and effects with all the same script on social media.

27:04.482 --> 27:06.202
and they told us it was a novel virus.

27:06.843 --> 27:22.687
And I think that the former Human Genome Project Research and Development Director Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone are central figures in the American narrative control bullshit operation.

27:26.468 --> 27:39.836
And I think if you have any doubts about whether this population pyramid theory is nonsense or not, you can download the McKinsey Global Institute report that I have on my website under the link stuff, which is also available.

27:39.856 --> 27:41.637
You can Google it yourself and find it.

27:42.698 --> 27:47.821
They'll tell you all about how population collapse in all of these countries is coming, including in China.

27:47.861 --> 27:50.383
In China, they had even a worse problem than we do.

27:50.863 --> 27:53.145
In Japan, they have a problem like this.

27:53.265 --> 27:55.186
In Scotland, it was crazy.

27:56.192 --> 28:06.583
And so by being on social media during the pandemic, they were able to create an illusion with multiple facets, multiple sides.

28:07.664 --> 28:11.268
Some people saw just a mean mother nature.

28:11.348 --> 28:14.531
Some people saw a very arrogant biological community.

28:14.571 --> 28:17.755
Other people saw bioweapons and an attack.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.981
And that was only possible because they had us on social media.

28:24.021 --> 28:26.702
They only got us this far because of social media.

28:26.722 --> 28:36.766
There's even a video of Mark Van Rans from Belgium saying this very thing that, man, if we would have had even a little bit of Facebook back then, we would have really done much better than we did.

28:37.527 --> 28:42.269
Lamenting that the swine flu never really, you know, took off like it should have.

28:44.110 --> 28:47.113
And this is all they ever had was these people on the internet.

28:48.835 --> 28:50.477
Six years back, I asked one question.

28:50.517 --> 28:51.758
I never got an answer from anyone.

28:51.838 --> 28:53.840
Do you know anyone that died from COVID?

28:54.461 --> 29:07.194
It's the fog of anti... It's really important to understand that this gentleman right here, although invisible on the internet to most Americans and people around the world, he is part of a network that includes Robert Malone,

29:07.984 --> 29:11.908
that includes Steve Kirsch, that includes Kevin McKernan.

29:12.849 --> 29:23.500
And I know that for sure because of what Kevin McKernan said on the Danny Jones podcast, and because of all that happened during the writing of this book.

29:23.540 --> 29:30.607
And the beautiful part about it is, is that the other people who know this is the truth are all listed in this book under the Acknowledgements page.

29:31.587 --> 29:42.113
Now what makes this so damning is that this jackass named Kevin McCairn, who apparently lives in Japan, but I don't really know and I have no way of verifying that.

29:43.607 --> 29:53.674
That guy, although meaningless in the grand scheme of the internet, is a connection directly to me being meddled with.

29:53.774 --> 30:11.686
From the moment I spoke out from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, still faculty there, still just biking to work every day, I needed to be controlled, much the same way that Brandy Vaughn needed to be controlled or stood in front of, much the same way that Brian Hooker needed to be stood in front of or controlled.

30:14.878 --> 30:17.659
Now, I've been trying to tell you that this is one big network.

30:17.719 --> 30:26.303
Now, interestingly, the second time that Kevin McCairn was on the VSRF podcast of Steve Kirsch,

30:27.537 --> 30:30.558
former huge donor to the DNC.

30:30.658 --> 30:41.402
It's all Democrats that are infiltrating the Trump administration, not to say that the Trump administration is being infiltrated, but to say that the Trump administration is just a fake Democratic.

30:42.162 --> 30:44.843
They're really just all Democrats, including Donald Trump.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.884
His loyalty is to Hillary Clinton, for goodness sakes.

30:53.206 --> 31:01.430
It wouldn't surprise me if the original dunk on Hillary Clinton about taxes and that makes me smart, if that wasn't even scripted.

31:06.133 --> 31:15.378
But if you don't want to go that far in your imagination, please go far enough to understand that the national security state would definitely put very, very

31:18.052 --> 31:23.674
would definitely put lots of people on the internet and give them a script in order to achieve an objective.

31:24.655 --> 31:44.003
And if they could do that and make everybody believe that bioweapons are real, everybody believe that gain of function is a threat much worse than nuclear weapons, then they solve so many problems in one fell swoop if they could do that with a bunch of clowns on the internet sharing a script and pretending not to.

31:45.305 --> 32:10.056
And what I'm begging you as young people to see is that if you see it now and understand that social media is almost exclusively used that way against you, you will get off of it and start building your own federated network of communication that they can't hijack like that, or at least is not as vulnerable as it is when you are interacting with their black box.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.757
So look there, Jordan Vaughn, MD,

32:14.668 --> 32:22.855
and Kevin McCairn were on this VSRF live in April of 2025.

32:23.436 --> 32:32.944
That guy, Kevin McCairn, has been harassing me and my family for five years straight, and then there is a wonderful record of it on Rumble.

32:33.865 --> 32:41.111
Hundreds of videos, maybe even thousands of hours dedicated just to me and my gigaohm project.

32:42.435 --> 32:46.103
And there's no other way to explain that other than he's being paid to do it.

32:47.051 --> 33:12.859
From the moment that he called me in March of 2020, he had stories about how we shared, you know, he did some postdoc with some guy that I knew at Pitt and he saw me, you know, my JC on the bike, you should come do a live stream with me and Paul Cottrell and Addie Adds, all of whom are associated with George Webb, the guy who supposedly was sued or suing Robert Malone.

33:13.720 --> 33:25.410
So part of this web of bullshit that Robert Malone seems to have been told by Mike Callahan to spin his team up in the beginning of 2020, not a team to find repurposed drugs, but a team to control the narrative.

33:26.371 --> 33:35.138
And at some point in time, it got so out of control that Robert Malone himself decided to go on Brett Weinstein's podcast and really get the train back on the rails.

33:39.301 --> 33:43.982
And so that train is still cascading off of the rails, but they only have so many people on the bench.

33:44.042 --> 33:45.623
So who do we have?

33:45.703 --> 33:53.205
Jordan Vaughn in front of the Senate yesterday or the day before with Peter McCullough, while Peter McCullough is almost ending his job.

33:53.225 --> 33:55.285
You can hear him there saying, I'm done with this.

33:56.905 --> 33:59.566
And Jordan Vaughn now is coming in off of the bench.

33:59.666 --> 34:02.407
And they intended to bring Kevin McCarron off the bench too.

34:03.621 --> 34:09.166
But if they bring Kevin McCarren off the bench, then they're inevitably stuck with me.

34:09.486 --> 34:13.990
Because Kevin McCarren, I have all of those videos downloaded.

34:14.450 --> 34:16.912
I've been downloading them every time he puts them out.

34:18.053 --> 34:30.523
I've been screenshotting those thumbnails for years because if there was ever a lawsuit or ever a way that that could be used to tie him to anybody else, I better have that stuff.

34:30.543 --> 34:31.184
And so I do.

34:34.298 --> 34:46.107
just like I have all my direct messages from Twitter, because at some point I realized, wait a minute, when somebody blocks me, I can't look at those messages anymore, then I've got to start screenshotting these things.

34:47.428 --> 34:59.458
And you need to do the same thing if you want to really understand what's going on, because at the flip of a switch, any number of operators on the internet can change everything that's on their website or websites.

35:02.287 --> 35:08.429
This history can be erased and changed much faster than a fire through the Library of Alexandria.

35:09.489 --> 35:13.310
Because after the fire of the Library of Alexandria, new books had to be written.

35:15.411 --> 35:20.412
If the books are already written and ready to go, then the internet can be switched like a flip.

35:21.892 --> 35:28.178
And so you need to be aware that there's gonna be a limited time here in the next few years that you can still archive all of this stuff.

35:28.558 --> 35:39.528
But curiously enough, Dr. Jordan Vaughn is on YouTube and there's a little video that's like 500 people have seen and it is pretty extraordinary.

35:39.909 --> 35:40.349
August, 2021.

35:46.705 --> 35:48.146
Uh, we are rolling.

35:48.186 --> 35:55.828
So I wanted to start with, um, you guys are seeing a huge spike in people coming to get COVID-19 testing.

35:56.868 --> 35:59.169
What are you attributing that spike to?

35:59.449 --> 36:03.670
A huge spike in people coming in for testing in August of 2021.

36:05.151 --> 36:06.231
A huge spike.

36:06.711 --> 36:09.072
What do you attribute that spike to?

36:11.513 --> 36:13.333
Remember now, what do you think this is?

36:13.593 --> 36:14.493
Can you hear it already?

36:14.533 --> 36:16.114
She's on a script that he gave her.

36:18.368 --> 36:20.009
Otherwise, you wouldn't repeat Spike.

36:21.150 --> 36:22.932
She's reading it, okay?

36:23.052 --> 36:26.935
And in a few seconds, you're gonna hear him fix the question for her.

36:26.995 --> 36:33.921
So you're gonna hear him admit that she's reading a script, a list of questions that he gave her.

36:35.322 --> 36:36.483
This is an audition.

36:37.691 --> 36:45.754
All of these people have been auditioning, wittingly or unwittingly, this is apparently very wittingly, auditioning for this role.

36:46.194 --> 36:55.818
And it is not for nothing that after four years, this guy got to sit in front of the Senate next to Peter McCullough and Aaron Sere.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.219
Like, come on.

36:57.419 --> 36:58.059
Stop lying!

37:00.708 --> 37:08.314
hearing because of people needing proof of negative results to get into concerts and businesses, but you're saying that's not necessarily the case?

37:08.474 --> 37:12.878
Yeah, I mean, I would say it's maybe 5% of our test requests are for those kind of things, whether it's travel.

37:13.458 --> 37:24.447
I will say, you know, beginning of really from end of April until mid-July, I mean, pretty much 100% of our requests were for

37:25.217 --> 37:27.258
um, travel or going to places.

37:27.678 --> 37:30.099
But then the end of July, it just ramped up.

37:30.779 --> 37:45.183
Um, and so he is saying that at his clinic, it used to be because people wanted to travel, they were trying to get a negative test, but now it's people with symptoms and they're really coming in with something strange, right?

37:45.203 --> 37:47.084
Aggressively.

37:47.144 --> 37:49.805
And now it's maybe just 5% of what we're doing every day.

37:49.845 --> 37:53.386
The rest are people with symptoms are seeking us because they have symptoms.

37:53.426 --> 37:53.466
Um,

37:56.064 --> 37:57.546
So what are you attributing it to, I guess?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.310
Yeah, what are you attributing the spike to?

38:00.711 --> 38:01.932
So it's definitely the Delta variant.

38:01.952 --> 38:02.573
The Delta variant.

38:02.774 --> 38:04.536
What are you attributing the spike to?

38:06.759 --> 38:07.300
What we know is...

38:08.157 --> 38:09.138
The Delta variant.

38:09.218 --> 38:10.779
Eight to 10 times as infectious.

38:12.280 --> 38:27.531
Eight to 10 times as infectious as the original Wuhan strain, which according to the virologist and Excel sheet expert, Charles Rixey, is the most infectious coronavirus in history.

38:27.611 --> 38:30.553
So now it's eight to 10 times more infectious than that.

38:30.613 --> 38:32.014
I think that's like an R naught of 160.

38:32.074 --> 38:36.217
Again, every place it's been previously,

38:36.636 --> 38:48.225
has had, once the Delta variant is the primary variant in the community, it does exactly what we think it would do, would be infect like crazy.

38:48.745 --> 38:50.126
Infect like crazy.

38:50.186 --> 38:51.787
It does what we would expect it to do.

38:51.827 --> 38:53.729
It infects like crazy.

39:03.484 --> 39:13.666
It doesn't, the thing that I want to point out to the people, the person in the chat, Solar Fire and that, it doesn't matter if Kevin McCairn gets off the bench, that's already off the bench.

39:15.567 --> 39:17.087
You know what else is off the bench?

39:17.167 --> 39:31.370
The fact that I have a text message from Steve Kirsch from years ago, where he offered to send me to Tokyo to work with Kevin McCairn on vaccine mouse experiments, and I shit you not.

39:33.513 --> 39:34.854
pretty valuable iPhone.

39:37.795 --> 39:45.799
And so this game of trying to legitimize Kevin McCairn in my eyes has been going on for a long time with lots of people.

39:45.839 --> 39:48.921
And it included Charles Rixey coming to my fricking house.

39:49.861 --> 39:54.504
It included Charles Rixey going to Tokyo, I guess, and Japan for a while.

39:55.664 --> 40:02.428
It included Kevin McCairn coming to my house and also going to Texas or whatever and hanging out with, with, um,

40:03.516 --> 40:16.964
with Charles Rixey and also riding across America with one of the longtime supporters of Mark Kulak and longtime follower of George Webb, some chick named Karmadoc.

40:19.045 --> 40:22.847
It's all one network and we will expose them.

40:23.047 --> 40:24.188
I will expose them.

40:24.248 --> 40:29.311
These people are all auditioning to be part of a controlled demolition team.

40:31.411 --> 40:37.494
that is effectively neutralizing any real resistance to this controlled demolition of America.

40:40.415 --> 40:42.636
And these people are traitors for playing along.

40:43.657 --> 40:44.777
Absolute traitors.

40:46.538 --> 40:48.119
So, and we're seeing it all over the place.

40:48.159 --> 40:55.182
Now, I will say that the symptoms that we were having compared to the symptoms that we had in January, not everybody, but on a majority,

40:56.060 --> 40:59.682
are less and they actually do better than they did in the last wave.

40:59.742 --> 41:08.866
And I will also say the last wave, even from December to January, was significantly more deadly, well, less deadly than the patients we saw at the start of this thing.

41:08.906 --> 41:14.128
When the start of this thing, when people got tested positive, it was, I mean, it was, you know,

41:15.384 --> 41:23.949
And a lot of them went ended up in the hospital and each time there's been another wave, it's more and more tests, more and more positives, but less and less serious disease.

41:23.989 --> 41:28.712
And I think that's pretty typical based on how most viruses mutate.

41:29.072 --> 41:36.656
So, so with this based on how most viruses mutate, I mean, come on, this dude is full of shit.

41:36.876 --> 41:38.497
Increase of people coming to get tested.

41:38.858 --> 41:41.339
What kind of stress is that putting on your resources here?

41:41.659 --> 41:42.960
I mean, I accommodating everybody.

41:43.020 --> 41:43.400
Yeah.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.601
I mean, I can't really,

41:45.188 --> 41:48.231
I've got more and more people working at home to get people scheduled.

41:48.471 --> 41:52.035
I've got, um, I don't, I probably sleep four hours a night right now anyway.

41:52.435 --> 41:53.897
I'm actually doing the scheduling in the line.

41:54.457 --> 42:03.727
Um, so he's making, he has four, he has people working at home to schedule people for testing, but he's doing most of the scheduling.

42:03.787 --> 42:05.989
So is this guy lying or is this guy lying?

42:07.148 --> 42:09.530
He's making money hand over foot, that's for sure.

42:09.910 --> 42:16.955
I guess if you do more than 150,000 COVID tests in your practice, you make a lot of money, right, Ryan Cole?

42:17.535 --> 42:18.976
How much do you charge per test?

42:19.457 --> 42:21.258
How much do those testing companies make?

42:21.958 --> 42:24.500
It's my business, so I gotta make sure people are taken care of.

42:25.121 --> 42:26.322
It's my business, wow.

42:27.196 --> 42:29.016
I wonder how he knew to go into that.

42:29.517 --> 42:50.401
Interesting, because I know a story of a porn movie producer who just decided to buy a half a million dollars worth of sequencing machines in California and got a no-bid contract from a city in California to sequence all of, sorry, PCR test all of the firemen and policemen and all the municipal employees for the whole year of 2020 and 21.

42:54.358 --> 42:58.961
Interesting choice of, you know, career change for a porn movie producer.

42:59.361 --> 43:02.903
Maybe an interesting career change for this asshole.

43:03.363 --> 43:03.883
Excuse me.

43:04.263 --> 43:05.844
Sorry, I apologize for that.

43:06.545 --> 43:08.226
So, I mean, that's really what's done.

43:08.246 --> 43:10.247
I think probably put more stress on my wife than me.

43:10.307 --> 43:11.207
So, with the...

43:20.345 --> 43:30.753
I guess this second wave of the pandemic, you're seeing more people getting tested now with this Delta variant than... Not only tested, but tested positive.

43:30.793 --> 43:33.815
And I will say it's more likely that this is the fourth wave.

43:34.216 --> 43:45.044
And so if you were to compare it to the India data, India after each wave that they did, they would do a seropositivity study, which basically gets some really targeted samples throughout the whole country.

43:46.124 --> 43:52.028
India did something for every wave and they get targeted samples from around the country.

43:52.108 --> 44:03.334
Wow, this guy's got a lot of insight into a particular country that nobody ever really pays any attention to, but everybody loves, like Kevin McCairn loves India.

44:04.494 --> 44:11.338
His whole starting reel for the last five years has featured a prominent head nod to India.

44:14.264 --> 44:28.675
He even has a, a, a repeating sort of audio thing that if it's not bimbo Bailey with a bunch of hot dogs in her mouth, when he gets a lot of money, then it's something to do with that Indian guy going, no vaccine in me or something like that.

44:30.537 --> 44:31.898
Interesting India.

44:31.938 --> 44:32.698
Tell me more.

44:33.059 --> 44:35.961
And, uh, when they've done that each time, the first one,

44:36.445 --> 44:38.988
Basically, again, targeted blood samples.

44:39.028 --> 44:42.972
Blood samples show you who's been infected, who has antibodies from it.

44:43.192 --> 44:45.014
Those products were not recalled.

44:45.254 --> 44:46.955
Their EUA was ended.

44:47.736 --> 44:49.078
Make sure you understand that.

44:49.118 --> 44:51.420
The FDA didn't say they were bad.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.741
Their EUA just ended.

44:54.303 --> 44:59.428
The first wave, which would have been right when we had this, you know, 15 days to slow the spread, that whole thing.

44:59.970 --> 45:01.831
They did a seroprevalence study afterwards.

45:02.171 --> 45:04.132
It was about 0.7% of their population.

45:04.632 --> 45:11.735
The second wave, which was 0.7% of the population in the first wave in India, according to this guy, because he's got some India data.

45:11.755 --> 45:12.836
It would have been a year ago.

45:13.376 --> 45:13.576
It was 7.1.

45:15.037 --> 45:22.180
And then the third wave, which is similar to our third wave, which was December to February, was 24.1% of the population.

45:22.620 --> 45:28.463
This last wave, which they did seroprevalence studies that released it two weeks ago from the Ministry of Health in India.

45:29.102 --> 45:32.444
It was 67.6% of people had antibodies.

45:32.964 --> 45:39.107
And so you wonder why it fell off like a cliff, because there's not many more people to infect.

45:39.167 --> 45:44.269
And actually, in that seroprevalence study, they actually did kids aged 16 to 18.

45:45.010 --> 45:45.650
Sorry, 6 to 18.

45:45.770 --> 45:46.910
They didn't do anybody under 6.

45:47.591 --> 45:49.612
But the prevalence in there was about 60% as well.

45:50.092 --> 45:55.374
And when you think about it, OK, Johns Hopkins says, you know, there's like 30 million cases there.

45:55.594 --> 45:56.555
But do the math.

45:57.804 --> 46:02.707
1.4 billion people and 67.6% is about 930 million.

46:02.907 --> 46:04.708
Johns Hopkins was only off by 900 million.

46:05.669 --> 46:09.271
How many of the people that you're testing are vaccinated?

46:09.831 --> 46:11.452
I mean, it's, you know, half and half.

46:12.433 --> 46:15.435
So now we'll say that positivity rate or half and half doesn't seem to.

46:15.455 --> 46:18.557
You know, the question is, is again, we're an outpatient place.

46:18.657 --> 46:25.961
We're obviously not coming here where you can't breathe or you know those kind of things, but in our in our

46:26.789 --> 46:31.790
pooling, prior infected seems to matter the most, then vaccine status after that really doesn't matter.

46:31.830 --> 46:38.311
Probably matters a little bit more how recently you got the vaccine, but a lot of the doctors and even the elderly got it early.

46:38.351 --> 46:41.872
And actually, if you look at the Pfizer data, there's a reason that they want to have a booster.

46:43.172 --> 46:43.392
So.

46:44.332 --> 46:46.492
There's a reason why they want to have a booster.

46:46.552 --> 46:51.833
So in 2021, he is clearly not concerned about the vaccine.

46:53.574 --> 46:55.814
Not concerned at all, in fact.

46:56.516 --> 47:07.542
And I still haven't heard anything about amyloidosis from the S1 spike protein, which is what he said in front of the Senate two days ago with Peter McCullough next to him.

47:09.703 --> 47:10.724
Are you seeing this yet?

47:12.144 --> 47:13.545
Are you seeing what's happening here?

47:13.605 --> 47:15.126
What actually happened right there?

47:15.246 --> 47:20.969
This is a bench warmer coming in to replace somebody that can't play anymore.

47:22.421 --> 47:28.862
And that's why he doesn't have any videos on Rumble for the last month, because he can't play anymore.

47:29.422 --> 47:33.143
He is an absolute hole in their armor now.

47:34.043 --> 47:49.746
Everybody that's attached to him, and Steve Kirsch, and Robert Malone, and Kevin McKernan, who told the story about Charles Rixey helping Robert F. Kennedy with his Wuhan book on the Danny Jones podcast are now done.

47:51.593 --> 48:00.095
And soon Dr. Jack Krause is going to fit right into this for you and it'll be painful, but it will be also, it will be also a relief.

48:02.495 --> 48:10.457
Um, and you know, for people who are saying, you know, I don't need the shot because people are still catching this virus who are vaccinated.

48:10.577 --> 48:11.597
What do you say to those folks?

48:12.537 --> 48:14.337
I mean, I think every vaccine is a personal decision.

48:14.597 --> 48:15.618
I think they need to look at the data.

48:15.638 --> 48:16.918
I don't think I need to talk to the doctor.

48:17.418 --> 48:17.838
So, um,

48:19.038 --> 48:19.598
That's what I do.

48:19.618 --> 48:25.139
I mean, the first thing I would do is make sure that they haven't already had COVID because I think if you've had COVID, that gives you protection.

48:25.159 --> 48:26.399
Yeah, it is real nice.

48:26.439 --> 48:29.120
If you have a Southern accent, you can really sound a lot nicer.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.880
People don't really seem threatened by you.

48:30.900 --> 48:36.121
You can even say something real smart, like RNA can out-pandemic, and it doesn't sound real threatening.

48:36.481 --> 48:38.701
You could even say something like intramuscular injection.

48:38.741 --> 48:39.502
It's kind of dumb.

48:39.902 --> 48:46.263
But then it doesn't really sound that profound because, you know, you're not talking like an accent like you're on Navy News or something like that.

48:46.283 --> 48:47.283
So I ain't fooling myself.

48:47.323 --> 48:48.023
Bless your heart.

48:49.198 --> 48:50.859
I think that was also India data.

48:50.899 --> 48:53.760
He's got a lot of data from the Health Department of India.

48:53.800 --> 48:54.260
He's cool.

49:14.791 --> 49:17.592
So are you advising still get vaccinated regardless?

49:18.493 --> 49:22.715
I would say first of all, find out what your immunity status is.

49:22.835 --> 49:25.076
Find out what your immunity status is.

49:25.116 --> 49:29.538
Go to your local doctor, ask for a lateral flow test and see if you're seropositive.

49:29.598 --> 49:30.298
Do it now.

49:31.479 --> 49:35.420
I mean, the other thing is a lot of people are surprised to even find out they've already their head.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.361
Like their headache today was COVID again.

49:37.621 --> 49:42.984
The Delta variant seems to be very because if you test positive on your PCR and you have a headache,

49:43.931 --> 49:46.053
The headache is from COVID.

49:47.535 --> 49:47.835
Wow.

49:47.875 --> 49:48.837
This is an easy game.

49:48.917 --> 49:49.297
I get it.

49:49.557 --> 49:53.482
Mild headache seems to be a symptom that wasn't part of the, all the other variants.

49:53.502 --> 49:57.566
This variant seems like, Oh, I had a headache and they're coming in for a headache and we test them and they got COVID.

49:58.067 --> 50:04.774
I mean, that's, that's, you know, again, so, um, you know, getting vaccinated while you actually have COVID it's probably not recommended.

50:04.814 --> 50:04.914
So.

50:06.022 --> 50:06.603
that makes sense.

50:06.623 --> 50:09.705
So that was kind of out of left field, right?

50:09.746 --> 50:12.608
Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, watch out there, fella.

50:12.648 --> 50:15.791
That was like, hey, try to keep it in the strike zone there, dude.

50:16.472 --> 50:23.498
Finding out whether you have it now or have previously had, it's probably a very important thing to make a decision about getting vaccinated.

50:24.779 --> 50:27.982
On average, how many people are you guys seeing today coming in to get tested?

50:28.863 --> 50:32.306
So, I mean, I think Monday was our

50:32.902 --> 50:35.263
I mean, the biggest day I've ever had was over a thousand.

50:35.844 --> 50:37.244
Holy shit!

50:38.625 --> 50:43.787
Over a thousand people are coming in for a diagnostic that has no relevance.

50:45.328 --> 50:55.033
Because it's on an infinitesimally irreducible background of genetic noise and they have no positive and negative controls and no replicates.

50:58.835 --> 50:59.035
Wow.

51:00.215 --> 51:01.336
But again, I have six clinics.

51:01.795 --> 51:05.077
So, I mean, not here, but meaning I have six clinics.

51:05.317 --> 51:07.198
So that's 1,000 spread across those six clinics.

51:07.218 --> 51:09.219
Yeah, and then, you know, so we have what?

51:09.779 --> 51:11.100
Probably, I mean, about 12 providers.

51:11.120 --> 51:16.823
So you could divide that into what a typical office would see because, but on aggregate, that's what it is.

51:16.863 --> 51:24.247
And again, that 1,000 is more than double, almost three times what the highest we did in the last wave.

51:24.888 --> 51:25.128
Wow.

51:25.308 --> 51:26.589
Business is good.

51:28.539 --> 51:33.262
Dr. Vaughn, anything I'm not asking you that you think is important to mention?

51:34.722 --> 51:39.865
I mean, I think seeking out, talking to, you know, sometimes again, I would say the course of the disease.

51:40.165 --> 51:51.311
Anything else that you see as important you want to tell anybody about transformation versus transfection, you know, or do you want to know nothing about that?

51:51.531 --> 51:51.732
No?

51:51.952 --> 51:52.452
Okay.

51:52.532 --> 51:55.434
Disease is a disease that a lot of people don't realize.

51:56.554 --> 52:16.148
Isn't like the flu in terms of you don't have a quick decline a lot of people sit around and say they feel okay for three to four days and Then they decline just talking about the syndrome right talking about the disease because the presumption is that it's there That's the goal of this whole message nothing about saving people nothing about skepticism of the PCR.

52:16.688 --> 52:22.212
I sell the PCR I'm the fifth or sixth day and I

52:23.007 --> 52:27.970
In all honesty, what I do for my patients is a lot of times I want to hear from them how they're doing.

52:28.530 --> 52:34.113
And if day four or five they're not doing well or it's in their chest, I'm going to start stuff.

52:34.333 --> 52:36.795
I'm going to start making more money off of them.

52:37.375 --> 52:42.198
Probably they would receive it once they got to the hospital, but there's no reason not to do it in the outpatient setting.

52:42.714 --> 52:45.756
And so in a lot of ways, I've kept a lot of people out of the hospital by doing that.

52:46.957 --> 52:48.518
But he's not going to tell you what he does.

52:48.759 --> 52:51.180
Is it hydroxychloroquine, or is it ivermectin?

52:51.220 --> 52:55.944
Maybe it's a combination of famotidine and silicoxib.

52:57.185 --> 53:07.153
And anyway, so if you're not getting better day five or six, you need to be a little bit more wary and get your doctor on the phone.

53:08.436 --> 53:17.719
Also, when it comes to getting tested, if a person has been exposed to someone who has COVID, but they're vaccinated, are you still encouraging them to get tested just in case?

53:18.279 --> 53:23.060
So a lot of the tests we're having would be a parent that comes in and just finds out they're positive.

53:23.420 --> 53:24.941
And then it's like, well, where did I get it?

53:26.501 --> 53:32.523
Sometimes it's actually funny that the guys, the man will get it, like for instance, and then the wife's like, where did he get it?

53:32.923 --> 53:34.844
And I'm like, well, let's swab you.

53:37.355 --> 53:39.295
She's positive, doesn't have any symptoms.

53:39.315 --> 53:44.476
So again, it's, uh, I think a lot of it, it is a magnificent, magnificent business.

53:44.516 --> 53:46.037
If you can get some, wow.

53:46.337 --> 53:47.337
And kids are the same way.

53:47.357 --> 53:51.558
A lot of people are parents are getting it from their kids and their kids literally have no symptoms.

53:51.738 --> 53:52.558
I never had some.

53:53.158 --> 53:55.059
So I think that's an important thing to realize.

53:55.139 --> 54:02.880
It's, um, it's, I don't want to be an alarmist here, but it's spreading like wildfire and we don't even, there's no heat, if that makes sense.

54:03.020 --> 54:04.220
You know, can't pick it up.

54:05.141 --> 54:06.301
So that's what I mean.

54:06.341 --> 54:06.441
I'm,

54:07.065 --> 54:10.567
What I'm picking up in the outpatient setting doesn't even match with what you ate.

54:10.607 --> 54:17.091
I mean, my ramp is way steeper than the ramp that they're seeing at the hospitals, which is a good thing.

54:17.631 --> 54:25.415
Because decoupling of those things is a great thing, meaning a virus that is much more infectious but much less deadly is a great thing for all of us.

54:26.316 --> 54:26.936
Wow.

54:27.516 --> 54:28.377
Isn't that amazing?

54:28.557 --> 54:32.179
I mean, it's really, you can see it clearly now, ladies and gentlemen.

54:32.199 --> 54:33.180
You don't have to be worried.

54:33.905 --> 54:35.206
You can see it very clearly now.

54:35.266 --> 54:36.227
They recruited people.

54:36.267 --> 54:38.148
They fooled people into participating.

54:38.728 --> 54:43.831
Remember, there's a couple permutations of understanding their performance using this analogy.

54:44.572 --> 54:47.934
But this guy is pretending to have to help the train stop.

54:49.295 --> 54:52.037
And then he's also going over here and chalking his hands up.

54:53.558 --> 54:55.539
And then he's going to help the train start again.

54:56.419 --> 55:02.964
And the thing that social media allows to happen is that you could get several guys like this

55:03.982 --> 55:20.252
working on the train and on social media you come down to the train and you find all these people pretending to stop the train maybe even all grunting maybe even calling out commands together so that they can look in sync and the same with the starting of the train again

55:20.852 --> 55:32.700
They might fall down and pretend they're really trying hard, or you could even imagine a scenario where they would have elaborate suits on that look like mech suits that they really needed to, you know, and they made noise and they buzzed and stuff.

55:32.740 --> 55:44.387
And so if you came down into this subway to find him and his friends starting and stopping the train, your first instinct, especially if you don't know much about trains, might not be that this is ridiculous.

55:45.356 --> 55:52.418
And the more people that they had pretending to stop the train with more elaborate costumes, had a more elaborate script.

55:52.498 --> 55:53.678
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready.

55:53.698 --> 55:54.658
The train's coming in.

55:54.738 --> 55:55.939
Everybody to their places.

55:57.619 --> 56:01.500
And then, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

56:01.540 --> 56:03.080
And the lights went off and everything.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.101
And then there was smoke and stuff.

56:05.141 --> 56:06.221
You'd really believe it.

56:07.028 --> 56:17.696
You could Broadway this up and it would be impossible from a stage perspective to know whether these people were faking it or not, especially if there were hundreds of them along the whole station.

56:18.756 --> 56:22.719
And so if they said to you when you came down there, can you help us out?

56:23.400 --> 56:25.881
Grab that helmet and those gloves.

56:25.981 --> 56:27.022
We need your help.

56:28.863 --> 56:30.064
It's a matter of life and death.

56:34.047 --> 56:36.349
Now you tweak the number of people down there.

56:37.412 --> 56:40.533
And it becomes almost an irresistible illusion.

56:41.114 --> 56:45.596
If there's too many people down there, then you can go like, well, but you guys can't possibly need me.

56:45.696 --> 56:46.516
What can I help?

56:46.936 --> 56:47.717
How could I help?

56:48.597 --> 56:56.601
But if you came down in the subway and there was only three or four people doing it, and there was an extra suit, now what?

56:59.460 --> 57:03.082
And I would argue that podcasts can be used that way.

57:03.222 --> 57:08.926
I would argue that Zoom meetings can be used this way in a way that none of us have ever really fully acknowledged.

57:09.086 --> 57:10.107
And more importantly,

57:11.713 --> 57:18.195
Social media can be used this way in a time-independent manner because social media is always there.

57:18.335 --> 57:19.756
The scroll is always there.

57:19.796 --> 57:26.118
But the scroll can give you the same feeling that all these people are working together to solve the same question, to answer the same question.

57:26.498 --> 57:28.119
They're all fighting about the same thing.

57:28.139 --> 57:29.759
They're all concerned about the same thing.

57:29.799 --> 57:34.621
And so it looks like there's all this organization in thought around you.

57:34.661 --> 57:36.362
And you've got to wonder, is that for real?

57:36.422 --> 57:39.783
I mean, do I need to respect the Lemmings or not?

57:41.035 --> 57:44.057
And that phenomenon subconsciously is very, very powerful.

57:44.097 --> 57:45.457
You cannot underestimate it.

57:46.158 --> 57:48.879
And for me, that's really one of the main messages.

57:48.979 --> 57:50.340
We will not call autism.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.021
I don't like the word autism.

57:52.901 --> 57:53.782
He was vaccine damaged.

57:53.962 --> 57:59.325
That's why I think one of the explanations here that you have to accept is that Brian Hooker had to be absorbed.

57:59.345 --> 58:00.605
He had to go along with it.

58:01.366 --> 58:03.427
He, at one point in time, said it right.

58:04.187 --> 58:08.790
He, at one point in time, probably understood that intramuscular injection was a bad idea.

58:10.219 --> 58:16.802
But there's something deeper involved with Brian Hooker because he has more than 16 years experience as a molecular biologist.

58:16.822 --> 58:39.433
So when the pandemic started and they were telling us that they were going to roll out investigational vaccines, Brian is somebody with the requisite experience to know that they were already essentially lying to the American public and the world by calling them investigational vaccines instead of saying, we're going to transfect you or transform you.

58:41.371 --> 58:43.992
And so I think he was absorbed.

58:44.052 --> 58:45.473
I think he's gone along with it.

58:45.593 --> 58:50.855
I think he thinks he's choosing the lesser of two evils, but it's a disaster.

58:51.295 --> 59:09.542
And I'm predicting to you right now, and it's already happened or starting to happen, the Simpson-Wood revelation will put a racial spin on the imperfect vaccine schedule in America, and more importantly, on the FDA, CDC coverup of it,

59:10.560 --> 59:17.068
And that will be the final straw for this whole, you know, show and controlled demolition of America.

59:17.108 --> 59:18.010
That will start a landslide.

59:20.307 --> 59:35.959
Maybe it'll only come out in a few years yet, but CHD's already starting to plant that seed, and that's because it's part of this script that Brian Hooker has agreed to stick to, where autism is not an illusion, it's a real thing, and it's got a very complex set of causes.

59:36.439 --> 59:49.509
And so, this woman, I believe, is trapped because she thinks that when she goes on a podcast with Callie Means and with Dr. Jack Krause, that it's three adults having a conversation, when in reality, it's two liars

59:50.467 --> 59:51.208
lying to her.

59:52.008 --> 01:00:00.473
It is an elaborate performance where these two guys will reinforce the idea that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:00.493 --> 01:00:14.382
is important, that Jay Bhattacharya is important, that Marty Makary is important, that Robert Malone is important, that Cally Means is important, that all of these people are worth talking about and debating about, and this is all the Maha movement.

01:00:15.751 --> 01:00:26.421
And while all that does is create the illusion in our own heads that the Maha movement is more than some bullshit on X. More than some bullshit on X when it's really not.

01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:50.548
The Maha movement is no more than a social media illusion that gets sustained on podcasts by people like Jack Krause and Casey or Callie Means and unwitting participants like people who just want to have a podcast and are willing to take lots of money to have a podcast and go, wow, shit, really?

01:00:51.633 --> 01:01:04.739
and Mary Talley Bowden, somebody who I think may be kind of trying to do the right thing, but just never done the requisite homework to get to the finish line because these people have already told her that she's there.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:18.605
Like they were already telling me that I was there when I said that there's a lab leak and they sent Charles Rixey to my house to try to make sure that I stayed there at that end zone.

01:01:19.864 --> 01:01:21.645
and kept spiking that football.

01:01:21.685 --> 01:01:22.985
That's what they want her to do.

01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:32.268
They want her to keep spiking the football of the COVID shot is bad without ever reflecting on how in the hell did they convince so many people to even do that?

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:43.653
The same question that Jack Cruz will never ask because there is a fake anti-vax movement because this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of earth.

01:01:44.773 --> 01:01:45.433
So let's listen.

01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:59.332
make huge money, to be honest with you, there's a couple influencers that have come out that I shake my head at, because I know they're Bitcoiners, I know they don't live in the United States, like Paul Saladino.

01:02:00.033 --> 01:02:01.434
I'm like, he's all excited about it.

01:02:01.454 --> 01:02:01.614
Why?

01:02:01.654 --> 01:02:02.654
Because he's a food girl.

01:02:03.215 --> 01:02:10.499
He's a former psychiatrist that really is hung up as MD, and now he's teaching people about food and exercise.

01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:11.179
Well, guess what?

01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:14.301
If you're a food and exercise influencer,

01:02:15.373 --> 01:02:18.875
What is Casey and Callie fundamentally telling food, babe?

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.817
What are they fundamentally telling the base?

01:02:23.018 --> 01:02:25.220
That is what we're gonna focus in on.

01:02:26.403 --> 01:02:33.191
And me and Mary are out there saying, by the way, the elephant in the room is 25,000 kids a day are getting popped.

01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:45.044
Now don't forget, one of the things that Jessica Hockett was supposed to do was to try and attach me to Jonathan Engler and Professor Martin Neal and their amazing substack about virology.

01:02:46.371 --> 01:03:01.548
so that they could do what he's doing right now, which is kind of speak for Mary, the same way that I think Sasha Latupova is kind of speaking for Catherine Watt and saying silly stuff that basically leaves everybody helpless because the DOD is doing everything.

01:03:01.588 --> 01:03:03.090
And this guy's going to say the same thing.

01:03:04.005 --> 01:03:07.606
But what's curious is what names does he say?

01:03:07.686 --> 01:03:12.847
Because that's how you can see whether these people are out of the network or in the network.

01:03:12.887 --> 01:03:17.228
You would never promote Robert Malone unless you were on his team at this stage.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:25.730
You would never promote anyone just like out of a list of people unless you were really on their team.

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:29.171
So him and Mary are going on podcasts.

01:03:29.231 --> 01:03:31.892
Podcast with, I've already shown you, with,

01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:35.859
Andrew Wakefield and Nicole Shanahan.

01:03:36.906 --> 01:03:42.287
Possibly three liars and Mary and now he's talking about the podcast.

01:03:42.327 --> 01:04:00.490
I just showed you with Casey means or no, he's Callie means and Jack Krause and Mary again Two liars against an unwitting participant three liars against an unwitting participant I was on the defender podcast in 2022 with Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:03.171
Probably an unwitting participant and

01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:07.675
Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rosen, Tess Laurie.

01:04:09.978 --> 01:04:13.922
Four liars against an unwitting participant.

01:04:14.903 --> 01:04:15.184
And me.

01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:38.187
And so I am gonna say it right now, if this guy lists the wrong people and promotes the wrong people, it is an admission that he is on their team, just like I made the, I could be wrong, I could have been wrong about him and Callie if he says the wrong names here, but I don't think he's gonna.

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:41.570
With a bioweapon that can subtract time for you literally?

01:04:42.603 --> 01:04:48.727
overnight, like the fruit loops and the red dye, that's going to kill you too, but it's going to take three, four decades for that to happen.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:50.969
This can kill you immediately.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:57.133
I mean, look at, look at the soccer player, Mike on the field that I think everybody who will listen to this has seen it.

01:04:57.153 --> 01:05:04.798
I think his name is Christian Hendrickson, a guy from outside, threw the ball in and he dropped and he died on the field.

01:05:05.759 --> 01:05:07.280
This guy is physically fit.

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:11.043
He played the whole soccer game and he drops dead.

01:05:13.186 --> 01:05:14.646
That doesn't happen with Froot Loops.

01:05:14.706 --> 01:05:17.947
If you find me one person that's happened with Froot Loops.

01:05:18.407 --> 01:05:22.148
Remember, it's safe to say the COVID shots are bad as long as you don't talk about 2020.

01:05:23.028 --> 01:05:24.508
So that's the narrative he's on.

01:05:24.708 --> 01:05:25.849
It's not dangerous yet.

01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:32.310
After getting the Froot Loops, you know, in the last, last little injection, you know, then I'll change my tune.

01:05:32.330 --> 01:05:34.151
I'll be right behind Casey and Callie Means.

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:37.531
But that's not reality.

01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:39.272
That's not the reality that's unfolding.

01:05:40.132 --> 01:05:40.852
You know, and then we have,

01:05:41.963 --> 01:05:42.664
Robert Malone.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:47.767
What he just came out and said, you know, against Nicole Shanahan was nothing.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:52.691
Robert Malone said something bad about Nicole Shanahan, strike one.

01:05:55.653 --> 01:05:56.433
More than stunning.

01:05:57.174 --> 01:06:03.158
But again, I'm not surprised because remember, he's a stakeholder in the mRNA platform.

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:08.642
He also happens to be a doctor that- He's a stakeholder in the mRNA platform.

01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:15.238
So getting details wrong about Robert Malone is also a very big failure.

01:06:15.919 --> 01:06:16.939
What else is he gonna say?

01:06:16.979 --> 01:06:21.200
I just wanna go back to make sure I hear it right and you hear it correctly.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.601
Let me just put it back a little bit here.

01:06:28.922 --> 01:06:35.524
Robert Malone, what he just came out and said, you know, against Nicole Shanahan was nothing more than stunning.

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:38.845
But again, I'm not surprised because remember,

01:06:39.793 --> 01:06:42.235
He's a stakeholder in the mRNA platform.

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:46.798
He also happens to be a doctor that took and got high off his own bag.

01:06:46.838 --> 01:06:49.260
He took his own shot and actually had a vaccine injury.

01:06:50.221 --> 01:07:04.071
So he also knows the exact narrative that Robert Malone has been selling from the very beginning, which is despite being a multi-year genius and a multi-scandal bioethics superhero,

01:07:05.996 --> 01:07:14.283
When it came right down to it and he had to travel during COVID, he decided to take two shots of something that he otherwise knew was dangerous from the very beginning.

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:20.188
And this guy is happy to repeat that.

01:07:20.308 --> 01:07:23.651
And he's not clever enough, despite the fact that he's a brain surgeon.

01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:24.972
They're the smartest doctors.

01:07:25.973 --> 01:07:32.078
He's a brain surgeon, but he can't figure out that maybe that might not be a very congruent story.

01:07:32.984 --> 01:07:37.426
And instead, he's just willing to say it out loud in the name.

01:07:37.486 --> 01:08:02.098
I mean, it's remarkable unless you see that it's just a script that provided by or in harmony with the script of Kevin McKernan, the script of Kevin McCairn, and the script of Robert Malone, and the script of Mary Holland, and the script of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the script of Brian Hooker, and the script of all of these people.

01:08:07.179 --> 01:08:15.765
But you have to decide, as the guy that's doing podcasts, and the audience has to decide, well, who do I really wanna listen to?

01:08:15.785 --> 01:08:17.066
Who's gonna pack my parachute?

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:18.868
Who do I wanna listen to?

01:08:18.968 --> 01:08:20.669
Who's gonna pack my parachute?

01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:28.114
Now, that's already an enchantment, and it's an enchantment that says one specific thing, that all these people are telling the truth.

01:08:29.636 --> 01:08:31.177
All these people are telling the truth.

01:08:31.617 --> 01:08:33.198
All these people are telling the truth.

01:08:33.598 --> 01:08:35.020
You're just gonna have to decide

01:08:35.925 --> 01:08:37.406
which the truth is for you.

01:08:39.367 --> 01:08:40.908
And that's incongruent.

01:08:40.928 --> 01:08:42.289
That doesn't make any sense at all.

01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:46.151
Some of these people have to be lying, but no, that's not it at all.

01:08:46.231 --> 01:08:47.092
Nobody's lying.

01:08:47.132 --> 01:08:48.733
Everybody believes what they say.

01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:55.677
Like my big problem with Aseem Malhotra, because he's now kind of on my side of things.

01:08:56.518 --> 01:08:58.099
This is the point I would make to you, Mike.

01:08:58.599 --> 01:09:00.100
Aseem Malhotra?

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.041
I mean, how many...

01:09:02.836 --> 01:09:04.397
Strike two at least.

01:09:22.486 --> 01:09:24.127
It's because his father took the job and died.

01:09:24.668 --> 01:09:25.528
That's what woke him up.

01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:26.989
So let me ask you.

01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:32.053
And so in 2025, it's some kind of revelation that Dr. Jack Kraus can drop on the world.

01:09:32.113 --> 01:09:34.795
That's been very well known from the very beginning.

01:09:35.235 --> 01:09:44.102
And incidentally, Asim Malhotra was on stage with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, and Sasha Latupova in Stockholm in January of 2023.

01:09:45.643 --> 01:10:06.971
Telling Stockholm that this was five fifth generation warfare and that you had no hope of figuring out who was doing it And if I was if I wish I was making that up but a C Mahal tra Sasha Latipova the mother of Soph and

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:25.964
Meryl Nass, longtime scientific advisor to CHD, longtime collaborator of Mary the Fake Holland, was on stage with Robert Malone and Mike Palmer of the Doctors for COVID Ethics, who's also a shithead.

01:10:28.106 --> 01:10:37.414
It's all one malevolent show, and most of these actors are on a script provided by Robert Wallace Malone.

01:10:40.475 --> 01:10:45.478
Do you pay doctors, Mike, to make the accurate diagnosis?

01:10:46.299 --> 01:10:49.982
Because isn't it true that when you go to see, he's a cardiologist, I'm a brain surgeon.

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:55.565
If we make the wrong diagnosis, your life can be extinguished like that.

01:10:56.506 --> 01:11:07.654
So pardon me if I point out the obvious in the room, that this guy is a bigwig cardiologist from NHS, was not a good diagnostician,

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:14.486
not only for his own family, but not for the public, and certainly not for the NHS.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:19.493
And that's why when Doc Malek called him out on it, I really appreciate it.

01:11:19.533 --> 01:11:22.558
When Doc Malek called him out on it.

01:11:23.632 --> 01:11:25.394
That's at least three strikes now.

01:11:25.454 --> 01:11:27.436
I mean, this is impressive.

01:11:27.476 --> 01:11:30.940
Because Doc Malek got the message earlier.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.221
And who paid the price?

01:11:32.582 --> 01:11:35.665
Doc Malek got the message earlier?

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.707
He didn't even start his podcast until 2023.

01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:46.953
Maybe it was 2022, but that's when Asim Malhotra came out.

01:11:46.993 --> 01:11:58.039
He was on Bret Weinstein's podcast in 2022, and you should check that out because Bret Weinstein introduces him as somebody who admittedly came to the light a little later than us.

01:12:01.001 --> 01:12:02.442
Did a Seema Holter pay the price?

01:12:02.562 --> 01:12:02.822
No.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:04.362
He's been elevated.

01:12:04.703 --> 01:12:09.785
He's making more money now than he's ever made because he's working on the Maha side of things.

01:12:10.305 --> 01:12:12.766
The food and exercise influencers.

01:12:13.867 --> 01:12:14.407
But guess what?

01:12:14.467 --> 01:12:17.488
Doc Malik doesn't have a job anymore.

01:12:17.548 --> 01:12:19.789
Doc Malik doesn't have a job anymore.

01:12:19.849 --> 01:12:23.951
Doc Malik was almost the EU representative for the wellness company.

01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:27.652
He asked for $10,000 a month plus travel, plus all kinds of other stuff.

01:12:27.672 --> 01:12:28.853
And I guess they turned him down.

01:12:31.383 --> 01:12:35.066
Doc Malek was recruited by Robert Wallace Malone.

01:12:35.106 --> 01:12:39.630
They met in person, took a picture and everything, and then they built him a studio in the backyard.

01:12:40.751 --> 01:12:43.573
They built him a studio in his backyard.

01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:51.580
Doc Malek is one of the fakest of all of the fakes here, and I was connected to him by another fake.

01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:57.607
who now wants me to present again, you know, the seventh or eighth time.

01:12:57.627 --> 01:13:02.068
I do a show every night now so that I don't have to present to anybody else.

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:05.730
I don't have to do another panda presentation or all this other stuff.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.110
I'll just do a show every day.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:13.752
And then when, you know, you want to watch it, you can watch it because this truth remains the same.

01:13:14.592 --> 01:13:16.133
It is a Lollapalooza of liars.

01:13:18.382 --> 01:13:24.687
And they recruit new people when Mark Kulak or myself make people a liability.

01:13:25.207 --> 01:13:43.662
That's the reason why Sasha Latupova will slowly disappear, why Kevin McCairn was going to be a flash in the pan, and why Charles Rixey will never actually amount to anything significant, even though the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project says he was like a dog on a bone with this stuff.

01:13:45.342 --> 01:13:49.366
because he actually told the savages in the audience the truth.

01:13:50.507 --> 01:14:02.780
So you have to realize people, doctors who made the tough decision, but the correct diagnosis for the patients, those are the people that I have my ultimate respect.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.101
Why?

01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:06.284
They got the arrows in the back and they got pounded.

01:14:06.704 --> 01:14:07.625
Some of them lost.

01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:10.471
So talk about losing jobs.

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:36.186
I lost a job at a top 10 university medical school in America as a faculty member, having gone through doing one of my post-secondary degrees, as Jessica Rose calls it, but I'll call it what it was, which was a postdoc and staff scientist position at the NTNU in Trondheim, Norway, when about nine months after I left that lab, that whole lab, the directors of it won the Nobel Prize.

01:14:37.153 --> 01:14:42.763
and actually used my paper in their presentation in accepting their award.

01:14:43.885 --> 01:14:48.193
You know, like their Nobel lecture had Cooey et al on one of the slides.

01:14:49.830 --> 01:15:04.603
So it's not an insignificant event to fire such a guy, especially because they fired me with such a YouTube channel called JC on a Bike, which sits there as a reminder of how I got sucked into this narrative.

01:15:04.643 --> 01:15:16.474
Because in July on that YouTube channel, in July of 2020, I was saying that they were stealing the rest of the value out of the treasury and lying to us about a background signal using bullshit PCR.

01:15:19.298 --> 01:15:22.900
And then the next three years of my life were full of all of these people.

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:27.143
From Kevin McCairn all the way to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:28.203 --> 01:15:36.428
Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, I've seen them all, talked to them all, argued with them all, been in Zoom meetings with them all, been across the dinner table from a lot of them.

01:15:37.128 --> 01:15:43.152
It is not possible for any other explanation other than for me to be more or less right

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:49.556
And if I was more or less right about all of those other people, I think I'm dead on balls accurate about Mr. Cruz here.

01:15:50.056 --> 01:15:51.036
He's part of the show.

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.377
He's happy to do it.

01:15:52.857 --> 01:15:53.738
Look at that pool.

01:15:54.098 --> 01:15:56.259
If you had that pool, you'd be happy to do it too.

01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:58.760
Some of the things that were most heated up.

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:08.225
I'm trying to come on podcasts and tell people, why would you support someone like Peter Attia or Rhonda Patrick or Huberman?

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:12.987
Peter Attia has never even- Rhonda Patrick or Huberman

01:16:14.366 --> 01:16:17.889
Or this Peter Atiyah, he keeps repeating their names.

01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:21.592
And these are just people within the controlled opposition.

01:16:21.632 --> 01:16:23.713
These are safe people for him to name.

01:16:24.274 --> 01:16:25.955
He'll probably give links to them later.

01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:27.797
He finished the residency.

01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:34.742
If you can't even do the basic qualifications, even if you know the qualifications are bullshit, great.

01:16:34.782 --> 01:16:40.927
But Peter's another guy that, just like a SEMA Ultra, told his longevity members that pay him $250,000 a year,

01:16:43.274 --> 01:16:44.842
to take the jab and take statins.

01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:47.516
So how good's that advice?

01:16:49.099 --> 01:16:52.681
Joe Lee was another guy who came on the scene exclusively for me.

01:16:53.202 --> 01:17:05.509
The only reason why he came on scene was for his stupid antibody, silly experiment idea hypothesis, as dumb as the bolus hypothesis from Marc Giraudoux.

01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:11.593
And then for him to attack me on social media and for them to promote his dismissal of me.

01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:13.775
That's the only reason why they brought him on X.

01:17:14.906 --> 01:17:18.048
and it's the only place anybody saw him, Joe Lee.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:19.970
What a joke that clown was.

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:25.194
And you need to tell people.

01:17:25.454 --> 01:17:27.476
But see what that means, right?

01:17:27.536 --> 01:17:28.156
Do you see it?

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:39.405
Just like Kevin McCaird, the very existence and track record of Joe Lee suggests that what I'm doing is very legitimate.

01:17:40.307 --> 01:17:44.330
Otherwise, Joe Lee would have never bothered to even come on Twitter or even tweet once.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:54.216
Just like Kevin McCarron would have never gotten paid any money for doing anything that he's doing, except because what I'm doing is a problem.

01:17:55.017 --> 01:17:56.738
Otherwise, you can't explain his existence.

01:17:56.778 --> 01:17:58.519
You can't explain Rixey's existence.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.441
It sucks, but it's the truth.

01:18:06.502 --> 01:18:06.982
The truth.

01:18:07.242 --> 01:18:09.363
Some people won't like the way I deliver the truth.

01:18:09.564 --> 01:18:11.304
I'm perfectly okay with that, Mike.

01:18:12.445 --> 01:18:14.286
But I'm going to keep doing the way I do it.

01:18:14.686 --> 01:18:14.966
Why?

01:18:15.506 --> 01:18:25.812
Because I find that when the world is completely artificial and made up with bullshit and filled with influencers, the only way to fucking get through to people is to punch them square in the mouth.

01:18:27.292 --> 01:18:28.373
And I'm really good at that.

01:18:29.633 --> 01:18:30.494
Really good at that.

01:18:30.888 --> 01:18:33.570
That's one of the things I respect about you, doctor, because you just don't give a fuck.

01:18:36.273 --> 01:18:37.133
Anybody know this guy?

01:18:37.153 --> 01:18:40.616
The reason why I don't is because I know that life is on the line.

01:18:42.698 --> 01:18:43.359
Here's a question.

01:18:43.479 --> 01:18:45.621
So you know that life's on the line.

01:18:47.273 --> 01:18:52.777
but you don't really take any action that suggests you know the lives are on the line.

01:18:52.818 --> 01:18:54.539
It's like Pauly Tommy.

01:18:54.639 --> 01:19:04.467
Either you know that injections are wrong and then you would say it every day until it stopped, or you know they're wrong but you know that

01:19:04.987 --> 01:19:13.838
You know, you can make more money if you're kind of a little obtuse about it, or you just say, you know, health freedom so you can absorb the, you know, little EMF money too.

01:19:14.258 --> 01:19:24.230
Like, the grift is obvious now, because either you believe that people are being killed by a not only irrelevant, but actually malevolent scheme,

01:19:25.563 --> 01:19:36.891
then you should be acting differently than I buy a lot of Bitcoin and go on podcasts with my shirt off next to my foggy pool and tell people the truth by punching them in the mouth.

01:19:37.771 --> 01:19:37.971
Wow.

01:19:41.147 --> 01:19:46.690
And of course, nothing about the, absolutely nothing about the opioid epidemic at all here.

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:49.572
Nothing at all about the population pyramid at all here.

01:19:50.072 --> 01:20:00.918
Nothing at all from the brain surgeon about, you know, supplementary oxygen or the misuse of ventilators or even the lack of antibiotic use that could lead to a lot of excess deaths.

01:20:01.038 --> 01:20:02.839
No, no, it's just scripted bullshit.

01:20:02.879 --> 01:20:08.823
But I want to ask you, why did Callie Means agree to do Danny's podcast with you and Mary?

01:20:09.901 --> 01:20:17.628
I think that one is simple, and maybe someday you can actually have Danny on your podcast, because I think Danny does need to come out publicly.

01:20:17.668 --> 01:20:22.292
He's been very quiet, because I don't think he wants to talk about this.

01:20:22.713 --> 01:20:23.614
Danny has to.

01:20:23.814 --> 01:20:25.776
Ooh, Danny might be coming off the bench.

01:20:25.836 --> 01:20:26.356
Look out.

01:20:28.879 --> 01:20:31.901
Because future guests may say, oh, he's going to spill the beans.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:48.637
he had cali schedule for the podcast when i did my first one when cali heard that one hello now we're going to try and substantiate the myth that cali is not filled playing fair that cali is a lobbyist and i'm exposing him

01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:52.481
Who gives a shit if this guy exposes Callie?

01:20:53.101 --> 01:20:54.843
We already knew who Callie was.

01:20:55.243 --> 01:20:56.724
We already knew who Casey was.

01:20:57.165 --> 01:21:01.068
The moment they went on Tucker Carlson, this guy has no revelations for us.

01:21:01.108 --> 01:21:02.649
He's punching no one in the mouth.

01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:06.092
This is Malone and McKernan scripted bullshit.

01:21:06.372 --> 01:21:08.014
He called me and said, I'm out.

01:21:08.494 --> 01:21:09.315
You can interview me.

01:21:09.395 --> 01:21:13.318
This is like Robert Malone saying that Mike Callahan called me from Wuhan.

01:21:13.378 --> 01:21:14.799
At least that's where I thought he was.

01:21:14.839 --> 01:21:16.361
And he told me to spin my team up.

01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:20.201
me in May of 2025, okay?

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:23.844
Then what did I do when Danny told me that?

01:21:24.185 --> 01:21:30.390
Danny said like he will not, he canceled our podcast because his podcast was supposed to be at the end of December.

01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.551
Just him?

01:21:31.751 --> 01:21:32.892
Just him or was it just him?

01:21:33.152 --> 01:21:34.653
No, it was just him and Danny.

01:21:35.574 --> 01:21:41.338
And he canceled his podcast because he knew that Danny was probably going to be a little bit

01:21:42.499 --> 01:21:48.083
adversarial, especially since I was on and Kevin was on, Kevin McKiernan.

01:21:48.844 --> 01:21:50.685
Oh, Kevin McKiernan.

01:21:51.265 --> 01:22:04.975
So he's telling you the story about how Danny Jones almost broke the internet because first he had Kevin McKiernan on who told about 20 minutes of lies about the Wuhan cover up and about the book and about Charles Rixey's contribution to it.

01:22:05.015 --> 01:22:06.436
And oh, Alex Washburn too.

01:22:07.816 --> 01:22:14.864
And then I came on the Danny Jones podcast, and there was already this huge nuclear crater from Kevin McKernan.

01:22:14.904 --> 01:22:19.028
And then you put my kilotons of knowledge in there, and I blew a crater.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.590
Boy, you can't even believe it.

01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:22.112
We almost ended the internet.

01:22:22.132 --> 01:22:22.672
With Danny.

01:22:23.033 --> 01:22:24.694
And so was Alexis Jasmine.

01:22:25.075 --> 01:22:27.297
He had three podcasts in a row that was all science.

01:22:28.118 --> 01:22:41.203
So he knew that he was going to get pounded, and he wouldn't be able to get his food babe message out, you know, or his Paul Saladino message out, or his Peter Attia message out to the masses.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.164
Say the names again.

01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.785
Say the names again.

01:22:46.065 --> 01:22:46.425
Oh my gosh.

01:22:46.445 --> 01:22:50.847
What you guys don't know is that his sister was already up for the Surgeon General then.

01:22:51.588 --> 01:22:52.468
And what did I do?

01:22:52.508 --> 01:22:57.170
That's when I started, if you look back at my Twitter feed, in November and December early,

01:22:58.211 --> 01:23:06.759
I started releasing all the- Look at my Twitter feed where I release all the information you need.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:15.107
Go to X. The things that the investigators that I hired, I didn't release at all.

01:23:15.987 --> 01:23:17.468
But enough to smoke him out.

01:23:17.628 --> 01:23:22.951
Danny calls me up and tells me, uh, Jack, by the way, he's agreed to come on the podcast.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:23.631
Wow.

01:23:23.751 --> 01:23:28.814
He used X to manipulate Callie into coming on the podcast.

01:23:29.234 --> 01:23:31.895
He is a Jedi master.

01:23:33.416 --> 01:23:33.616
No.

01:23:34.617 --> 01:23:38.699
And, uh, he goes, that's when Danny said, would you be okay?

01:23:39.505 --> 01:23:40.905
coming on the podcast with him.

01:23:40.945 --> 01:23:42.006
I said, absolutely.

01:23:42.086 --> 01:23:46.066
And that's when I said to Danny, I said, Danny, I think you should bring Mary on as well.

01:23:47.227 --> 01:23:49.767
So I'm the one that suggested Mary.

01:23:50.767 --> 01:23:55.688
I said, now you're going to have two doctors and a guy who's going to be in the cabinet.

01:23:56.649 --> 01:24:04.970
And we're going to see, my belief is that when you watch that podcast, you will clearly see a lobbyist and you'll see two doctors.

01:24:05.751 --> 01:24:07.831
And then you'll see a guy that's running his podcast.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:17.562
He was trying to be the matador, but really he was out of his league too, because some of this was high level science.

01:24:17.582 --> 01:24:21.463
And I know Danny's not, he was out of his league because they were in cohorts.

01:24:23.423 --> 01:24:36.526
I don't think Mary was read in, but she was briefed in a way that she could not escape from the ruse and Casey or sorry, Callie and Jack are on the same team and they are liars.

01:24:37.779 --> 01:24:38.820
That's how this works.

01:24:39.021 --> 01:24:49.954
And until you're willing to at least consider that long enough to see it, it will be as invisible as it is to everybody else that skillfully uses social media and is unaware of it.

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.143
It's not AI that you have to be afraid of.

01:24:53.203 --> 01:24:57.928
It's not baby videos you have to be afraid of, or fake videos even.

01:24:57.948 --> 01:25:07.279
You have to be afraid of multiple people going on podcasts and coordinating their life to the extent that they would even coordinate their apparent disagreements.

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.742
Scientists, but he also wasn't willing

01:25:12.045 --> 01:25:17.812
to step on Callie's toes a little bit when Callie clearly was off.

01:25:18.492 --> 01:25:19.574
And it's very unusual.

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:29.145
You know, Mike, when you have a lobbyist on, lobbyists are the smooth-talking guys, you know, that no matter when you put a camera on them, they're ready to go.

01:25:29.949 --> 01:25:34.172
And that's very clear from both Callie and Cassie's interviews.

01:25:34.793 --> 01:25:38.395
And if you look at the way the interview... If you put a camera on them, they're ready to go.

01:25:38.475 --> 01:25:52.166
So now you can see what this auditioning is all about and why these people had to be in place and why they had to rehearse and why Marty and Vinay and ZDogg were all doing podcasts because they're rehearsing.

01:25:52.206 --> 01:25:54.848
They're getting ready for their role.

01:25:55.695 --> 01:26:00.276
in narrative control, in the governance of people by mythology.

01:26:00.917 --> 01:26:04.538
This guy's now auditioning for a higher position, just like they all are.

01:26:04.598 --> 01:26:06.438
Series have gone on podcasts and things like that.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:14.361
They always keep it to, like I told you, inferior talent is really good when they're carrying an inferior message.

01:26:14.621 --> 01:26:16.541
And their message has always been the same.

01:26:17.362 --> 01:26:18.402
They've never gone off.

01:26:19.252 --> 01:26:24.096
So in that podcast, that's the first time you actually see, not the podcast.

01:26:24.116 --> 01:26:30.741
It's funny that he can't see through the fake anti-vax movement of Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker in the same way.

01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:32.283
Like they haven't made any progress either.

01:26:32.323 --> 01:26:33.604
Their message has never changed.

01:26:34.384 --> 01:26:36.086
It's a big top 10 for health freedom.

01:26:36.126 --> 01:26:37.787
They don't have any specific goals.

01:26:38.267 --> 01:26:45.893
It's rise and resist, people over profits, truth over fear and courage, sorry, truth over lies and courage over fear for shit's sake.

01:26:46.794 --> 01:26:47.475
The doctors.

01:26:48.626 --> 01:26:50.007
putting it to the lobbyists.

01:26:51.107 --> 01:27:08.554
And I said to Callie at the end of the podcast, I said, I'm perfectly happy with the audience making the determination for the reasons that I mentioned to you, Mike, earlier, that I believe the savages in the audience will look at that and go, the savages in the audience.

01:27:08.614 --> 01:27:10.915
Is that like, is that supposed to make you feel good?

01:27:12.199 --> 01:27:14.860
Is that supposed to make you feel good about yourself?

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.022
Should that make you feel good about using social media to learn from Jack Cruz?

01:27:20.363 --> 01:27:21.123
What a cunt.

01:27:21.524 --> 01:27:22.004
Sorry.

01:27:22.104 --> 01:27:22.804
Wow.

01:27:23.285 --> 01:27:25.466
All this stuff that's in my head is coming out right now.

01:27:25.546 --> 01:27:26.246
I apologize.

01:27:26.486 --> 01:27:27.186
Okay, I got it.

01:27:27.567 --> 01:27:28.907
Now I understand what's going on.

01:27:29.588 --> 01:27:38.852
Now, the reason I wanted to smoke him out is because I knew his sister wasn't going to get the Surgeon General job once this came out.

01:27:38.932 --> 01:27:39.873
And if you want to know the truth,

01:27:40.894 --> 01:27:43.716
Kali knew it too, because what did he immediately do that night?

01:27:44.336 --> 01:27:50.000
He called Danny Jones and told Danny Jones, do not release this podcast anytime soon.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.282
Because remember, when did they announce the Surgeon General?

01:27:53.322 --> 01:27:54.523
It was in January.

01:27:55.023 --> 01:27:55.224
Well,

01:27:56.104 --> 01:28:01.409
That's when Susie Wiles came up with the idea, OK, let's put a place card holder and wait till all this dies down.

01:28:01.429 --> 01:28:04.252
Do you know who Susie Wiles is?

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:09.837
Susie Wiles is the chief of staff for the Trump administration that nobody but Jack Krause talks about.

01:28:09.877 --> 01:28:17.704
But now I think if he's on script, what he's going to do is try to explain to you that that lady represents big pharma.

01:28:19.264 --> 01:28:31.791
So we're not gonna talk about anything else, even though there are corporations that are 10, 20, or even 100 times as big as pharma companies with much more profit and money to throw around.

01:28:32.711 --> 01:28:39.235
We're gonna talk about big pharma being in control of Donald Trump's administration.

01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:48.020
I also believe, my personal belief, if you look at what's going on with Danny's podcast, both of mine, the original one,

01:28:48.908 --> 01:28:51.250
has over two million hits on all those platforms.

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:55.793
The second one was even more powerful than that, but it was algo suppressed.

01:28:56.113 --> 01:28:56.433
Why?

01:28:57.594 --> 01:28:59.315
Because of Susie's friends in big tech.

01:28:59.836 --> 01:29:02.898
Those are the people that are behind, you know, KCMe.

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:05.300
Oh, big tech, that's okay then, that's better.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.242
At least he's saying something besides pharmaceutical industry.

01:29:09.082 --> 01:29:16.308
And she was hoping that if we could keep the lid on this, that nobody except a small part of the internet would ever

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:21.814
here, who he almost said it, nobody, but a small part of the internet would hear it.

01:29:23.156 --> 01:29:25.978
So he's kind of aware that that's a possibility.

01:29:26.399 --> 01:29:29.641
What he doesn't understand is that's a feature of the internet.

01:29:29.682 --> 01:29:40.992
It's a feature of social media, that any particular message can be segmented and corralled into a corner of the internet effectively.

01:29:42.321 --> 01:29:47.025
That is the primary way that the internet and social media are used against you.

01:29:47.565 --> 01:29:48.946
It's not the algorithm.

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:54.150
It is flipping switches and programming the absence of things.

01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:58.034
And so he's still saying it's the algorithm.

01:29:58.054 --> 01:30:01.716
No, they just decided if they wanted to, then not see that video.

01:30:01.757 --> 01:30:04.839
My guess is, is there would be no evidence of that if you looked at it.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.663
And if anything, now that he's been able to say that, a bunch of people went to find it.

01:30:11.004 --> 01:30:22.698
And so again, it's an illusion, because if you want to see what censorship looks like, you should look at the graphs for Housatonic Live's YouTube channel, one of which doesn't exist anymore.

01:30:23.079 --> 01:30:26.683
And you should also look at the one for JC on a Bike, because it's remarkable.

01:30:27.671 --> 01:30:29.472
I cannot gain subscribers.

01:30:29.512 --> 01:30:30.313
It's not possible.

01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:40.261
And it doesn't matter if I do five days a week for five weeks or 50 weeks, I will still have less than 4,000 subscribers because that's the way YouTube works.

01:30:40.641 --> 01:30:42.402
And this guy is not a victim of it.

01:30:42.442 --> 01:30:44.724
He is being promoted on YouTube.

01:30:44.884 --> 01:30:50.045
this interview because this interview was not a good look for Callie at all.

01:30:51.066 --> 01:31:00.688
It exposed him for what he really is, a lobbyist, and who he was working for and what his leaks were to both the WEF and also to A16Z.

01:31:04.013 --> 01:31:05.254
I think it worked.

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:11.556
And then just lay in some groundwork there in case you need another hamster wheel, you can go Google that, that nonsense.

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:18.238
Mary took the bull by the horns when she posted her substack on April 22nd, that went into all the details.

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:19.739
Oh, the substack.

01:31:19.759 --> 01:31:21.240
You got to look at the substack.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:25.001
Don't forget that the truth is only available on X and substack.

01:31:25.061 --> 01:31:28.322
It sounds like this guy might work for Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.

01:31:28.422 --> 01:31:29.223
Go figure.

01:31:29.263 --> 01:31:32.024
Maybe, maybe that's who Robert Malone works for.

01:31:33.084 --> 01:31:34.724
of all the other influencers.

01:31:34.784 --> 01:31:47.988
Like when you wanted to know when they named Casey why all the other influencers came out, didn't you find it amazing when you read Mary's sub stack that most of those influencers are actually in line for this huge payoff as well.

01:31:48.608 --> 01:31:51.469
So remember, in Bitcoin world, what do we say?

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:53.429
Incentives dictate outcomes.

01:31:53.549 --> 01:31:54.329
What else do we say?

01:31:54.529 --> 01:31:56.450
Always verify, don't trust.

01:31:57.438 --> 01:32:00.199
And that was the message, really, that I delivered.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:06.643
Make sure you understand that none of these people are advocating for this strategy, including him.

01:32:07.023 --> 01:32:09.765
Otherwise, they would be talking about ideas and not people.

01:32:10.145 --> 01:32:15.207
We wouldn't be dropping names and calling things like foodie foodie and whatever.

01:32:15.247 --> 01:32:20.550
We would have a specific set of objectives that we would be asking people to prioritize.

01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.432
But that's not really what he's saying here, is he?

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:36.212
And of course he's pushing Bitcoin, which I, you know, I know there's people in my own group, in my own chat that also believe wholeheartedly in that technology.

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:37.092
I'm not so sure.

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:39.814
I think if you want my advice, you better buy dirt.

01:32:40.974 --> 01:32:46.637
Or you can buy dirt and rent it to my family.

01:32:46.817 --> 01:32:49.498
And that would also help me, but buy dirt.

01:32:49.538 --> 01:32:50.419
Don't buy gold.

01:32:50.719 --> 01:32:52.980
Don't buy Bitcoin, buy dirt.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:33:00.038
Maybe you could buy a rural farm in Pennsylvania somewhere in the middle and rent it to my family.

01:33:00.078 --> 01:33:03.779
We would take really good care of it and we'd make rent payment every month.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.000
I don't know what you got from it.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.601
I don't know what your audience got from it.

01:33:07.221 --> 01:33:12.643
But I was the first one that outed them before anybody else.

01:33:13.203 --> 01:33:14.464
Because I knew what the game was.

01:33:15.284 --> 01:33:17.965
And the point that I'm trying to make to you is what I said to Malholtra.

01:33:18.888 --> 01:33:19.829
or about Malhotra.

01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:23.212
I made the correct diagnosis.

01:33:23.992 --> 01:33:24.753
That's my point.

01:33:25.293 --> 01:33:26.895
That's all I wanted people to know.

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:34.862
That to me, that's the single most important thing, because when people know that they can trust you, even if they don't like you, that's okay.

01:33:35.442 --> 01:33:36.323
That's all that matters.

01:33:36.363 --> 01:33:37.244
When you're

01:33:38.396 --> 01:33:43.283
having surgery with a brain surgeon, you wanna make sure that that fucking guy can do the job to save your life.

01:33:43.864 --> 01:33:46.949
You don't give two shits about anything else but that.

01:33:47.089 --> 01:33:49.012
And that's the way it should be in regular life too.

01:33:50.635 --> 01:33:52.638
All I'm doing now is brain surgery without a scalp.

01:33:57.442 --> 01:33:59.863
He's doing brain surgery without a scalpel.

01:33:59.903 --> 01:34:04.725
It's like Robert Malone saying that he was the disambiguation wizard a few years ago.

01:34:09.090 --> 01:34:11.031
Like right when- Mary wasn't there.

01:34:11.311 --> 01:34:12.272
Mary wasn't there.

01:34:13.272 --> 01:34:14.753
Callie was very nervous.

01:34:14.973 --> 01:34:18.595
And Callie, I didn't know this until I got there, because I was the first one that showed up.

01:34:19.795 --> 01:34:23.857
When I showed up, there was armed police at the podcast.

01:34:23.957 --> 01:34:28.619
And I said to Danny and Steve, who's his engineer, you know, because I had met these guys before.

01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:31.921
I had done a podcast, I guess it was a month or six weeks before.

01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:35.603
I'm like, what's the deal with all the cops and the weapons?

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:37.744
He goes, oh, well, Callie asked for that.

01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:39.680
I'm like, really?

01:34:40.521 --> 01:34:47.603
So I can tell you when he came and sat down, I think that was part of his NLP training from Edelman.

01:34:48.403 --> 01:34:57.727
He was trying NLP training to get me off the game.

01:34:57.747 --> 01:35:07.110
And the funny thing for me was, if this guy thinks his lobbying tactics are going to work with me, he's in for a rough couple of hours.

01:35:08.055 --> 01:35:09.496
And I think you saw that develop.

01:35:09.836 --> 01:35:12.799
I don't, I don't give a shit if Jesus Christ was sitting out in the hallway.

01:35:13.819 --> 01:35:17.462
I came there with a task to show the world who he really was.

01:35:18.343 --> 01:35:18.723
That's it.

01:35:19.624 --> 01:35:21.085
And then the world makes a determination.

01:35:21.105 --> 01:35:27.110
Like I already know, but you know, the, the funny part is Mike didn't know your audience didn't know.

01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:29.071
Shannon joy didn't know.

01:35:30.172 --> 01:35:36.637
Mary didn't know when Mary sat down, Mary was like, and I can tell you, I know that I made Mary uncomfortable.

01:35:37.452 --> 01:35:38.453
with some of the things I did.

01:35:38.573 --> 01:35:40.654
Did I have a discussion with Mary before I got there?

01:35:40.694 --> 01:35:40.894
No.

01:35:40.914 --> 01:35:45.497
I didn't even tell Mary of the things I found because I wanted her to be surprised.

01:35:46.697 --> 01:35:50.079
And then when she found out what she found out, then what did she do?

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.821
Exactly what a Wolverine doctor does.

01:35:52.861 --> 01:35:55.583
She's like, I'm going to go deeper.

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:57.464
I'm going to really dig into this now.

01:35:58.705 --> 01:35:59.585
And that's what we've done.

01:36:00.426 --> 01:36:02.347
That's the reason we have a problem.

01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:03.871
with these two.

01:36:04.552 --> 01:36:08.434
And you know, it's, it's, to me, it's actually even more ironic here.

01:36:08.474 --> 01:36:10.876
Mary is the same specialty as Casey.

01:36:10.916 --> 01:36:13.717
You think that Casey would have called Mary back?

01:36:13.777 --> 01:36:15.198
They also went to the same medical school.

01:36:15.238 --> 01:36:20.541
Do you think that no, nothing like radio silence, what does that tell you?

01:36:20.822 --> 01:36:27.906
Like any doctor, like the regular audience here may not understand this, but when another doctor in your specialty calls you,

01:36:28.567 --> 01:36:29.227
It's a big deal.

01:36:29.648 --> 01:36:36.472
So the other day, Trump made a comment when I went on Lyndell TV to talk to Emerald Anderson about this.

01:36:36.812 --> 01:36:39.353
Trump said that she was at Lyndell TV.

01:36:40.994 --> 01:36:42.475
And now he's plugging Trump.

01:36:43.636 --> 01:36:44.376
Is Trump good?

01:36:44.837 --> 01:36:46.097
I bet Trump is really good.

01:36:46.157 --> 01:36:47.278
The top of her class in this now.

01:36:47.698 --> 01:36:50.140
I talked to the dude that was at the top of her class.

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:51.301
Turns out he's a neurosurgeon.

01:36:51.961 --> 01:36:53.442
And boy, did he have a lot to say.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:54.743
OK.

01:36:55.839 --> 01:37:03.267
So I can tell you right now, she's a manufactured TV Surgeon General for big pharma.

01:37:03.988 --> 01:37:06.150
That's who she is for big tech.

01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:12.036
Callie is a lobbyist that's in place to make sure that Bobby Kennedy stays in amber.

01:37:13.817 --> 01:37:16.138
That's the real story.

01:37:16.478 --> 01:37:19.478
Bobby Kennedy stays in Amber?

01:37:20.438 --> 01:37:21.239
Oh, here we go.

01:37:21.299 --> 01:37:22.399
This is going to get rich.

01:37:22.499 --> 01:37:28.680
Susie is the person, who's the puppeteer, who's being directed by the DOD, DARPA, and Big Pharma.

01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:35.882
DOD, DARPA, and Big Pharma is directing the chief of staff of

01:37:36.636 --> 01:37:41.639
the Trump administration and keeping him in amber, Mr. Kennedy.

01:37:42.279 --> 01:37:43.080
Holy shit.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.601
It's the hierarchy that is in Mahan.

01:37:48.683 --> 01:37:54.005
When the conversation ended and Danny stopped recording, what was that conversation after?

01:37:54.106 --> 01:37:54.746
Was there any talk?

01:37:55.697 --> 01:37:56.378
Yeah.

01:37:56.458 --> 01:38:05.144
First thing Callie did when he stood up, he said to me, he goes, okay, Jack, now that we've hashed this out, are you going to be nicer on Twitter and this and that?

01:38:05.164 --> 01:38:08.827
And I said, yeah, I think when this goes live, everything will be fine.

01:38:08.867 --> 01:38:10.749
I said, but now I'm on to your sister.

01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:12.490
And he was stunned.

01:38:13.991 --> 01:38:15.893
I told him, I said, I'm done with you.

01:38:15.953 --> 01:38:17.053
Now I'm coming for your sister.

01:38:19.055 --> 01:38:19.936
It's fake rivalry.

01:38:19.956 --> 01:38:22.778
Why wasn't she, was she invited to that conversation?

01:38:23.038 --> 01:38:25.400
I think Danny did extend the invite and she declined.

01:38:27.466 --> 01:38:28.287
Why do you think that was?

01:38:29.247 --> 01:38:32.029
Very, very fake scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:32.049 --> 01:38:33.390
This is a team of performers.

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:34.631
He cited a few people.

01:38:35.251 --> 01:38:40.154
A very curious one is this guy, one of the worst of all the worst ones.

01:38:40.354 --> 01:38:45.317
One of his first podcasts was recording me, and then he put it behind a paywall.

01:38:45.397 --> 01:38:49.660
And only after I exposed it did he, I never had it behind a paywall.

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.681
He did two recordings of me.

01:38:51.761 --> 01:38:53.102
Both of them were behind a paywall.

01:38:53.142 --> 01:38:53.803
He also put,

01:38:54.843 --> 01:38:59.905
The other paywalled episode was Mike Eden, which at the time I thought was pretty shitty.

01:39:01.706 --> 01:39:05.487
This guy Cruz mentions Robert Malone, not in a bad light.

01:39:05.887 --> 01:39:08.809
Mentions Kevin McKernan, not in a bad light at all.

01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:15.371
And of course mentions Bobby being held in amber by these people, these means twins and stuff.

01:39:15.391 --> 01:39:16.111
They're bad guys.

01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:19.293
It couldn't be these two behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.193
No, no, it's not them.

01:39:20.653 --> 01:39:21.974
Those guys are good guys.

01:39:24.082 --> 01:39:38.414
And so I am making the argument that the way we got here is because of Steve Bannon and a network of liars that he helped put together to support the possible presidential candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:38.994 --> 01:39:47.041
And this was already planned a long time ago with his good friend Tony Lyons when they put an epilogue in the back of Jesse Ventura's book that included

01:39:48.049 --> 01:39:49.150
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:54.317
as an independent candidate that would then be the vice presidential candidate of somebody that would get shot.

01:39:54.777 --> 01:40:00.525
And here we are in 2025, not that far away from that little silly story.

01:40:01.205 --> 01:40:04.269
I think the biological forces that are behind the

01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:12.994
fake anti-vax movement in America, maybe for a few years now, before the pandemic even was Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone.

01:40:13.434 --> 01:40:32.083
Kevin McKernan was at a few places and on a few things that lead me to believe that he was probably in the background during this whole operation to try and build this fake anti-vax movement that included Suzanne Humphreys and Mary Holland.

01:40:33.023 --> 01:40:33.883
and Meryl Nass.

01:40:33.943 --> 01:40:36.444
I think these guys may have been behind them all along.

01:40:37.425 --> 01:40:42.266
And then, of course, there are unwitting recruits that are just too dumb to know.

01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:45.267
I think Brett Weinstein is one of those people.

01:40:46.067 --> 01:40:47.008
They give him a script.

01:40:47.048 --> 01:40:57.671
He reads it and thinks that if he reads it really well and contributes a few extra vocabulary words to the script, that he's doing a really good five-star job and his wife is

01:40:58.371 --> 01:41:16.502
is I don't know she's just clueless I guess and I got connected to this guy by no less than Piper Stover somebody who spent like 10 years in China and for some reason nobody cared that I wrote a review with somebody like Piper Stover everybody just ignored that extra author on there and when I figured out

01:41:17.202 --> 01:41:21.605
that I had been played for five months while that review was being written.

01:41:21.685 --> 01:41:25.367
She was giving it to him and giving it to him and giving it to him.

01:41:25.828 --> 01:41:31.271
And eventually after the review was written, somehow or another, this guy would contact me and say he wanted to be on my stream.

01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:35.574
And then a few weeks later, Charles Rixey would show up at my house.

01:41:36.995 --> 01:41:38.796
All conveniently at the end of the murder.

01:41:41.638 --> 01:41:44.099
Ladies and gentlemen, sculpted bullshit for what?

01:41:44.179 --> 01:41:50.860
That's really the question, and you gotta really be willing to answer that it's for murder and lies.

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:55.361
They used murder and lies in America to convince the world that this pandemic happened.

01:41:55.781 --> 01:42:10.164
They used murder and lies in America and a myth about autism spectrum disorder to make sure that your children will never question intramuscular injection as a methodology, virology as a science, or public health as a reason and an answer.

01:42:11.766 --> 01:42:23.230
The same thing that they did with the pandemic to reinforce those same myths, to make sure that these same questions are never asked, is gain of function and pandemics.

01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:29.232
Once you start to understand that no one's been able to say this except for me,

01:42:30.086 --> 01:42:32.508
despite them being on the job a lot longer.

01:42:32.548 --> 01:42:38.813
You know, like Polly Tommy on the job a lot longer, doesn't seem to figure it out yet because she's part of this.

01:42:39.093 --> 01:42:44.418
She's part of this very, very malevolent narrative control grid.

01:42:44.718 --> 01:42:50.242
And wittingly or unwittingly, these people are participating and they need to be shown.

01:42:50.823 --> 01:42:59.109
You need to be able to see them because we are at a time point where a national security priority extends across national borders.

01:43:00.014 --> 01:43:04.515
A national security priority extends across generational borders.

01:43:06.655 --> 01:43:12.316
And it's a national security priority that has been running in the background for much longer than any of us have been aware.

01:43:13.196 --> 01:43:20.798
And if you want to know how long, I think one of the best places to find out is to look at Mark Housatonic, Mark Kulak's work on Housatonic ITS.

01:43:20.818 --> 01:43:22.258
Get off social media if you can.

01:43:22.278 --> 01:43:26.119
I don't care how you get there.

01:43:26.139 --> 01:43:28.799
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:31.452
goals to win.

01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:55.234
We're just halfway done, Susie.

01:43:55.274 --> 01:43:56.196
Don't go anywhere.

01:43:56.216 --> 01:43:58.583
We got a new show set up.

01:43:58.623 --> 01:43:59.826
You've been gone for a while.

01:43:59.846 --> 01:44:01.872
I do the intro in the middle.

01:48:22.927 --> 01:48:23.447
so so

01:48:50.842 --> 01:48:52.403
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:48:52.423 --> 01:48:53.363
Good afternoon, actually.

01:48:53.403 --> 01:48:55.545
It's 1.28 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:48:55.605 --> 01:48:57.726
Welcome to GigaOM Biological's second half.

01:48:58.946 --> 01:49:05.270
This is a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist by the name of Jonathan Cooey out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:07.771
I'm coming to you live out of the back of my garage.

01:49:08.692 --> 01:49:14.535
I was a former scientific advisor to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense.

01:49:15.456 --> 01:49:26.406
I've got a big fan in the name of Jessica Hockett who uses my ideas on her substack, Woodhouse76, to have fake arguments with Claire Craig and Pierre Cory and Mike Eden and Jay Bhattacharya.

01:49:27.046 --> 01:49:29.709
I've actually been to a few barbecues with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:49:29.749 --> 01:49:30.569
He likes me a lot.

01:49:30.609 --> 01:49:35.154
I'm his, I'm his, used to be his favorite biologist, but I'm not anymore apparently.

01:49:35.274 --> 01:49:36.275
Sorry about that loud music.

01:49:37.155 --> 01:50:02.070
This is giga ohm biological if you want to share the stream, please go to stream giga ohm bio And if you want a notification, please go to giga ohm HQ at proton dot me with your own email address You can also send a self-addressed stamped envelope to PO box 802 in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania and get a sticker or two and even a velcro backed patch Yesterday I covered this slide deck

01:50:04.912 --> 01:50:05.352
There we go.

01:50:05.492 --> 01:50:06.933
Oh, no, they're not set up.

01:50:06.953 --> 01:50:07.774
I have to do that.

01:50:07.874 --> 01:50:08.094
Sorry.

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:16.521
I'm gonna do that right now I'm gonna leave that up there while I set this up What do I need to do I have to turn this on

01:50:17.791 --> 01:50:18.392
Oh, that's on.

01:50:18.552 --> 01:50:19.413
Oh, I have that already.

01:50:20.214 --> 01:50:26.961
Um, so yesterday, uh, I read a little list of things that I'm going to flash up on the screen again.

01:50:26.981 --> 01:50:32.948
Um, and, and you can go back to yesterday's show and find that right after the music, just like I put it here.

01:50:33.809 --> 01:50:33.909
Um,

01:50:36.505 --> 01:50:41.829
I've been asked a few times to summarize my points a little bit and of course there are no citations here.

01:50:41.889 --> 01:50:47.213
I'm a biology coach and the things that I'm coaching you about are available widely.

01:50:48.454 --> 01:50:59.943
It would be a bit like trying to convince you to believe that basketball is a sport and then me needing to actually tell you how to find it.

01:51:00.403 --> 01:51:01.904
You can go out and find it yourself.

01:51:02.825 --> 01:51:10.650
This biology is something that at this stage, because we understand it as well as we do, and we can explain it as well as we do, you can go out and find it yourself.

01:51:10.690 --> 01:51:18.555
And that's why I keep referring to myself as a biology coach rather than a biology teacher or a biologist or something like that.

01:51:19.015 --> 01:51:28.581
For you and for my viewers, for my students, I want to be a biology coach for my upcoming high school students, my incoming freshman students that I'm going to teach this summer.

01:51:29.001 --> 01:51:31.422
I want you guys to think of yourselves as more like

01:51:33.083 --> 01:51:35.264
athletes and me as your coach.

01:51:35.324 --> 01:51:40.287
So the first thing you need to realize is that a lot of countries on earth don't have a way out.

01:51:42.148 --> 01:51:44.569
All the countries of the EU, they don't have a way out.

01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:50.872
They're gonna have to actually physically remove themselves from the EU or they have no way out.

01:51:52.618 --> 01:51:55.120
And the Canadians, they have no way out.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.802
There's no legislative mechanism, no loophole.

01:51:59.262 --> 01:52:09.468
There is no exhaust port the size of a womp rat that you can shoot a couple photon torpedoes down and blow up the Death Star.

01:52:09.908 --> 01:52:19.053
In Canada, there is no two meter exhaust port that you can throw proton torpedoes down and blow up the Death Star.

01:52:19.631 --> 01:52:21.413
and blow up the Death Star of the EU.

01:52:21.473 --> 01:52:22.173
There just isn't.

01:52:23.134 --> 01:52:42.271
But in America, we have a constitution, and that constitution provides a couple exhaust ports through which we could, with the right set of circumstances, the right case, the right federal judge, the right circumstances, created by a smart and tactical lawyer.

01:52:43.772 --> 01:52:49.093
we could expose the PrEP Act as unconstitutional and leave it up to a single judge to strike the law.

01:52:49.753 --> 01:52:53.874
That would be a great start toward progressing ourselves out of this mess.

01:52:54.295 --> 01:52:56.975
But we will still be trapped in the currency hole that we're in.

01:52:57.855 --> 01:53:04.637
We'll still be trapped with the infrastructure problems that we have, and we will still be trapped in the same population pyramid.

01:53:08.298 --> 01:53:12.839
But that was what this text was about, about getting the PrEP Act struck for unconstitutionality.

01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:19.874
Next thing, virology is a fraud, but it's fraudulently presented and fraudulently represented.

01:53:19.914 --> 01:53:22.677
It's not fraud in the sense of there's no biology there.

01:53:23.578 --> 01:53:28.503
And so I tried to explain that yesterday with this distinct little diagram or text.

01:53:30.242 --> 01:53:34.124
And RNA not being able to pandemic can be expanded a little bit.

01:53:34.724 --> 01:53:41.128
But if you want to do the requisite homework, you need to go to the primary literature and read about Remdesivir and see who the authors are.

01:53:41.968 --> 01:53:56.436
Then you need to read about XON and see who the authors are, and then try to understand that the only evidence for pandemics was created by the very same people that we are now identifying as just actors.

01:53:57.423 --> 01:53:59.105
Peter Daszak is not real.

01:53:59.565 --> 01:54:04.329
He's someone that was recruited at roughly the same time that Andrew Wakefield was recruited.

01:54:04.369 --> 01:54:10.535
That's why they have a publication record with regard to irritable bowel syndrome and the measles virus.

01:54:11.155 --> 01:54:12.356
It's not by accident.

01:54:13.698 --> 01:54:20.684
They actually had to work very hard to separate their narratives so that they could play opposite roles in the Scooby-Doo.

01:54:22.318 --> 01:54:23.999
and they have to keep them segregated.

01:54:24.059 --> 01:54:49.889
That's why the fake anti-vax movement of Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker have not been able to draw the very easy line between Andrew Wakefield and Peter Daszak and how it can't be possible that they used to be colleagues and now they're on opposite ends of a Scooby-Doo mystery about a lab leak virus.

01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:51.510
It's not possible.

01:54:52.409 --> 01:55:09.542
But even the no-virus people, the brilliant Andy Kaufman or the multiple book-writing Baileys from New Zealand haven't been able to see that America seems to be under the spell of a couple shitheads on both sides of the narrative about a fake virus.

01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:19.920
We'll just write books about fake viruses and how there's no contagion, but we won't actually try to save America from being trapped by foreign invaders.

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:23.340
You know, like the Iranian at the head of U.S.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:31.002
Emirate, or the Australian at the head of DITRA, or the German couple at the head of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, for goodness sakes.

01:55:33.542 --> 01:55:35.323
No, we wouldn't want to talk about any of that.

01:55:35.363 --> 01:55:37.883
We have to focus on Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak.

01:55:40.168 --> 01:55:44.872
And the reason why they don't is because it's all part of one malevolent narrative.

01:55:45.432 --> 01:55:59.683
If the DoD and DARPA are doing anything, they have controlled this narrative and created the illusion of a pandemic out of a pre-existing anticipated phenomenon in the population pyramid.

01:56:00.584 --> 01:56:01.945
It's a magnificent trick.

01:56:07.236 --> 01:56:13.920
And so PCR is not a valid diagnostic because it's not being used as it's used on an academic bench.

01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:24.786
And all the academic biologists in America and around the Western world should have been able to figure this out by now if it wasn't for the fact that social media is weaponized against them.

01:56:26.769 --> 01:56:32.692
Because anybody that hears me explain it, that actually has the requisite knowledge to understand it, it immediately snaps in their head.

01:56:33.312 --> 01:56:36.714
That's why they can't let me talk to college professors.

01:56:36.754 --> 01:56:38.495
That's why they have to keep me away from them.

01:56:39.676 --> 01:56:41.917
And they put Kevin McKernan in front of those people.

01:56:41.977 --> 01:56:44.038
They put Del Bigtree in front of those people.

01:56:44.078 --> 01:56:49.161
They put Robert Malone and Mary Holland in front of those people.

01:56:50.021 --> 01:56:51.762
And social media allows that.

01:56:53.083 --> 01:56:56.027
It's not because they're in lots of conferences that I'm not.

01:56:56.087 --> 01:56:58.170
It's because social media does that.

01:56:58.871 --> 01:57:04.117
It can be the difference between 3000 people seeing you and 3 million people seeing you.

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:09.084
And there's no amount of virality involved in it.

01:57:14.301 --> 01:57:20.148
And so the FDA should have evaluated every diagnostic product as a separate medical device.

01:57:20.188 --> 01:57:30.741
And that's the main reason why they needed control of the FDA now is to make sure that nobody was there to look back on the disaster that is PCR and think, wow, are we still using this for something?

01:57:31.162 --> 01:57:32.023
But of course we are.

01:57:32.123 --> 01:57:33.585
Even the measles outbreak

01:57:34.085 --> 01:57:50.832
in Texas is being defined by PCR and the only effective resistance to it, you know, like Pauly Tommy and Brian Hooker on the VSRF podcast with Steve Kirsch, do not question PCR at all.

01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:54.114
They don't question PCR at all.

01:57:54.174 --> 01:57:57.035
They say that they are identifying measles

01:57:59.158 --> 01:58:04.122
posthumously, like posthumously, like, you know, like after death.

01:58:05.864 --> 01:58:07.185
And they don't argue about it.

01:58:07.225 --> 01:58:08.306
They don't question it.

01:58:10.288 --> 01:58:23.099
And that's how you can see that this illusion is being sustained by this fake anti-vax movement that will never question the foundational myths of the pandemic, which are still in existence and probably are providing

01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:34.292
a system-wide level of fraud there that is the remnant stream that the freaking Human Genome Project has always wanted.

01:58:34.332 --> 01:58:44.637
This is a national security priority to flip us from sovereign individuals to experimental animals and community members.

01:58:46.077 --> 01:58:50.359
And they're going to use this anti-vax vaccine, you know,

01:58:51.516 --> 01:58:53.679
pandemic narrative to do that.

01:58:54.139 --> 01:58:56.442
And they need to do it to your kids, not you.

01:58:56.742 --> 01:58:58.765
Your kids have to believe this shit.

01:58:59.606 --> 01:59:09.939
And so if we don't mount a real rescue mission for our grandchildren by trying to rescue our children from the social media control of their brain,

01:59:12.125 --> 01:59:20.732
and teach them never, never to accept intramuscular injection, never to accept virology, and never to accept public health as a reason and an answer.

01:59:21.252 --> 01:59:26.376
Our children will be enslaved because people like Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are being paid very well to do it.

01:59:27.297 --> 01:59:29.118
It is a national security priority.

01:59:31.311 --> 01:59:37.016
And so yeah, the DOD is definitely involved, but it's so much bigger than that because there are countries involved.

01:59:37.577 --> 01:59:38.598
NATO is involved.

01:59:39.058 --> 01:59:46.385
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the only explanation for Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan for betting in this space.

01:59:47.026 --> 01:59:49.008
So this scripted bullshit goes on.

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:52.731
I just want you to see how bad it is, and then we'll end the show for today.

01:59:53.432 --> 01:59:54.052
Check this out.

01:59:55.113 --> 01:59:56.715
This is another podcast.

01:59:56.735 --> 01:59:57.896
This is the one from yesterday.

01:59:57.916 --> 01:59:59.357
We're going raw and live.

01:59:59.397 --> 01:59:59.997
Good to see you.

02:00:00.198 --> 02:00:00.818
Good to see you.

02:00:01.058 --> 02:00:04.681
Vinay Prasad and Sangela J. Nagpal.

02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:05.522
Great to have you here.

02:00:06.603 --> 02:00:07.143
What in the hell?

02:00:07.744 --> 02:00:09.305
Of course, this is a conversation.

02:00:09.325 --> 02:00:12.788
This is not a show or really a podcast.

02:00:12.808 --> 02:00:13.689
This is just a conversation.

02:00:13.709 --> 02:00:14.209
Hold on a second.

02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:17.171
I think I made a mistake here and there's like two videos.

02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:17.632
Let me check.

02:00:19.488 --> 02:00:38.003
uh video format selection pane yes that's correct two videos are here we don't want that animation that needs to go where oh okay playback automatically and then that goes up there and then we are good to go sorry about that

02:00:43.496 --> 02:00:44.677
We don't even need a countdown.

02:00:44.697 --> 02:00:46.157
We're going raw and live.

02:00:46.197 --> 02:00:46.798
Good to see you.

02:00:46.998 --> 02:00:47.618
Good to see you.

02:00:47.878 --> 02:00:51.500
Vinay Prasad and Sanjula J. Nagpal.

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.340
Great to have you here.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:55.041
And of course, this is a conversation.

02:00:55.081 --> 02:01:01.124
So they're doing like podcasts every few days, which suggests to me that they don't have a lot of other things to do.

02:01:01.664 --> 02:01:07.427
And what suggests to me even more that they don't have a lot of things to do is this podcast and the content of it.

02:01:08.564 --> 02:01:14.728
These are professional bullshitters that I guess Jack Krause doesn't care about at all.

02:01:15.248 --> 02:01:17.530
He's more concerned about Callie and Casey Means.

02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:23.334
He's not at all worried about the foreign clown show at the head of the FDA.

02:01:23.374 --> 02:01:33.220
The only regulatory agency that could reverse the foundation of the pandemic myth is now headed by a bunch of posers.

02:01:33.701 --> 02:01:38.124
And they're doing podcasts as part of their duty to the American people.

02:01:38.544 --> 02:01:39.225
Stop lying.

02:01:40.006 --> 02:01:42.709
Oh my gosh, this is infuriating.

02:01:42.989 --> 02:01:47.233
Not a show or really a podcast, this is just a conversation.

02:01:47.814 --> 02:01:54.001
We were in my office chatting and we said, hey, let's just walk out to the chairs and just have this conversation on the cameras.

02:01:54.522 --> 02:01:58.363
so we can be transparent and the glass box that we are.

02:02:10.643 --> 02:02:25.248
People really appreciate these conversations because too often the FDA was completely opaque, that black box, and now we're just having these conversations on camera, talking about whatever we're working on this week and into the future, and letting the American public know directly.

02:02:25.288 --> 02:02:30.590
I mean, this guy makes Peter Marks look like Albert Einstein, and I don't mean with the hair.

02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:32.751
It's remarkable.

02:02:33.071 --> 02:02:33.691
Our thoughts on that.

02:02:34.642 --> 02:02:40.223
and there is the FDA with all the scientists busy at work, and it's just been awesome getting to know so many of them.

02:02:40.504 --> 02:02:41.384
Really impressive people.

02:02:41.964 --> 02:02:42.524
Brilliant people.

02:02:42.624 --> 02:02:47.305
I mean, I have learned, I made a joke that I've learned more in two weeks than I learned in two years.

02:02:47.665 --> 02:02:57.648
I mean, I'm talking to people all the time who are educating me on topics that I had only scratched the surface on, and you think you know a topic deep, there's depths beyond that.

02:02:57.688 --> 02:02:58.708
There's oceans beyond that.

02:02:58.808 --> 02:03:01.289
Oceans of subspecialization, and it's,

02:03:01.829 --> 02:03:02.309
It's kind of cool.

02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:03.210
It's kind of cool.

02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:04.511
It's an intellectual feast.

02:03:04.691 --> 02:03:08.954
We're never going to talk about the oceans of bacteriophages in the background, though, are we, Angela?

02:03:09.074 --> 02:03:09.874
That is for sure.

02:03:09.934 --> 02:03:13.256
I mean, yesterday alone, I mean, I was just thinking on my drive home.

02:03:13.316 --> 02:03:18.440
I mean, I learned so many things that I thought I knew something about just a little bit and completely changed my mind.

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.281
And I'm excited to talk about some of that today, too.

02:03:20.421 --> 02:03:24.563
And the vaccine framework, which has been out now for a day.

02:03:25.284 --> 02:03:29.847
So we've been absorbing what some of the response and feedback to it and

02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:34.679
It's been, I think, overall very positive.

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.042
How would you describe what you've seen?

02:03:37.102 --> 02:03:39.024
I've been inundated with emails.

02:03:39.204 --> 02:03:49.476
Emails, text messages, phone calls from all of the doctors I trained with at University of Chicago and Northwestern and the National Cancer Institute and OHSU and UCSF, as well as my European colleagues.

02:03:49.897 --> 02:03:51.899
And I would say the overwhelming majority

02:03:52.319 --> 02:03:57.163
are telling me, boy, finally a return to a common sense, evidence-based framework.

02:03:57.843 --> 02:04:04.888
You really struck the perfect balance between making the product available to a huge group of Americans, but also getting the evidence we need.

02:04:05.469 --> 02:04:07.670
And I think they think we threaded the needle nicely.

02:04:07.890 --> 02:04:11.013
And we are now no longer a contrarian nation.

02:04:11.293 --> 02:04:14.835
We're in line with all of Western Europe, which has been doing this for a long time.

02:04:14.855 --> 02:04:17.377
The European doctors are like, what took you so long?

02:04:17.397 --> 02:04:21.040
My Canadian family members are finally like, great, now we don't have to think about what's different.

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.941
My Canadian family members.

02:04:28.422 --> 02:04:32.824
There's too much maha in Canada, too much overlap.

02:04:34.084 --> 02:04:35.805
They used Canada against us.

02:04:36.065 --> 02:04:39.346
They used Canadians on social media against us.

02:04:40.186 --> 02:04:45.708
There's this little bald, it's Malik, not Malik, it's not Merrick.

02:04:47.498 --> 02:04:47.998
Malice?

02:04:48.539 --> 02:04:49.420
I mean, come on.

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.101
This is all a joke to me now.

02:04:51.181 --> 02:04:52.262
It's really gross.

02:04:52.782 --> 02:05:02.491
And if America doesn't wake up to how we have been Trojan-horsed, and that there are no Americans in control anymore, we have a very big problem on our hands.

02:05:02.551 --> 02:05:07.655
And all the Americans that are in control have a tattoo of the Israeli flag on their back.

02:05:08.456 --> 02:05:09.276
when we come visit you.

02:05:09.457 --> 02:05:14.339
We are no longer an international outlier in regulation of COVID vaccine boosters.

02:05:14.399 --> 02:05:15.940
Yeah, but Vinay, I have to commend you.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:23.765
I mean, the way that you presented the framework really struck a great balance of kind of that scientific technical discussion, but also in a way that my grandmother could understand.

02:05:23.825 --> 02:05:27.987
I think those figures in the paper were really helpful because I've been following both.

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:31.369
I bet her grandmother doesn't know what equipoise means.

02:05:31.869 --> 02:05:32.870
Holy shit.

02:05:36.943 --> 02:05:38.125
because it worked for years.

02:05:38.225 --> 02:05:43.791
And even for me, a lot of things really connected when I heard you present it yesterday.

02:05:43.811 --> 02:05:45.253
It just, it made so much sense.

02:05:45.273 --> 02:05:47.135
I am like, wow, how did I not know this before?

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.121
Well, I think that's really kind of you to say.

02:05:49.201 --> 02:05:55.024
And I've actually learned a lot from watching Marty over the years, because I think he's been an expert communicator from before I was in this business.

02:05:55.084 --> 02:06:14.234
But I think it is something you have to work at, which is that you go from talking to scientists where you speak a certain way to trying to make that more accessible to everybody, which means take out the jargon, substitute plain words insofar as possible, try to make simple visual images that walk through the core of the problem, as simple as possible, but no simpler.

02:06:14.794 --> 02:06:16.555
And that's what we were trying to do in that talk.

02:06:16.766 --> 02:06:18.587
I mean, to your point about learning every day, right?

02:06:18.607 --> 02:06:21.828
I mean, even though I'm in this world, I'm less on the clinical side.

02:06:21.988 --> 02:06:27.170
I think the most important thing to see here as an American is that this is insulting to you.

02:06:29.071 --> 02:06:34.092
That these are supposedly the adults that we're supposed to look up to now, that your kids are supposed to look up to.

02:06:34.132 --> 02:06:35.233
You should be insulted.

02:06:36.053 --> 02:06:38.154
You should be pissed.

02:06:38.194 --> 02:06:42.856
That there are hundreds of Americans more qualified than these people.

02:06:43.076 --> 02:06:46.117
Hundreds of Americans more qualified than these people.

02:06:48.206 --> 02:06:50.911
And I can say it like that because none of these people are American.

02:06:52.714 --> 02:06:54.116
None of these people are American.

02:06:54.156 --> 02:06:54.717
Like I am.

02:06:55.098 --> 02:06:56.380
None of these people are American.

02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:57.502
Even like my kids are.

02:07:01.991 --> 02:07:06.054
How do we have right now a naturalized citizen at the head of the FDA?

02:07:06.374 --> 02:07:09.096
How do we have now a naturalized citizen at Siebert?

02:07:09.377 --> 02:07:12.539
How do we now have somebody with Canadian family?

02:07:12.579 --> 02:07:28.551
I mean, this is absurd only if you understand how bad it is, because we have a foreigner at the head of US Amerit, a foreigner at the head of DITRA, and a foreigner at the head of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories for quite some time now.

02:07:30.148 --> 02:07:31.990
And they're all attached to Robert Malone.

02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:37.936
They're all attached to this Ralph Baric narrative because they don't want you to say any of those names.

02:07:38.336 --> 02:07:40.899
Robert Malone definitely doesn't want you to say David Hone.

02:07:41.199 --> 02:07:42.741
He wants you to say Davis Hone.

02:07:45.606 --> 02:07:50.148
I didn't know when the end point was until yesterday, and I finally understood the difference between surrogate and non-surrogate.

02:07:50.208 --> 02:07:55.290
Wow, that's a big bomb you just dropped there to the world.

02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:57.871
Totally qualified for her post though, right?

02:07:57.911 --> 02:07:58.892
Totally qualified.

02:07:59.052 --> 02:08:03.494
The way you explain it, and so a lot of great enthusiasm for the framework.

02:08:03.534 --> 02:08:08.716
I think a lot of the scientific community is really celebrating, wow, that we're finally following the science.

02:08:09.597 --> 02:08:16.143
But I was scanning some of the various headlines and all of the others, and there's always going to be critiques and pushback.

02:08:16.183 --> 02:08:17.664
In both directions, I'll have you know.

02:08:17.684 --> 02:08:20.467
I saw some people saying, like, what's wrong with them?

02:08:20.507 --> 02:08:23.410
They didn't yank all these shots off the market tomorrow.

02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:25.732
And I saw some people saying, what's wrong with them?

02:08:25.772 --> 02:08:29.496
They're not giving us a booster every six months in perpetuity for the rest of our lives.

02:08:30.797 --> 02:08:35.039
In some ways, all great compromises make extreme positions unhappy.

02:08:35.059 --> 02:08:42.021
I mean, it's the nature of compromise and pragmatism is that we're aiming for the middle for most Americans, you know, but yeah.

02:08:42.221 --> 02:08:46.063
Yeah, but by my assessment, there's kind of kind of two themes of those comments, right?

02:08:46.083 --> 02:08:48.003
There's kind of two camps that I think are emerging.

02:08:48.283 --> 02:08:51.945
There's someone with a camera and someone is moving the camera.

02:08:51.965 --> 02:08:55.426
So people are being paid to produce this shit.

02:08:56.119 --> 02:09:01.562
One is I would call the blind boosters in perpetuity.

02:09:01.602 --> 02:09:03.543
So let's call that the blind strategy.

02:09:03.563 --> 02:09:06.905
And then the other is more of that evidence-based strategy.

02:09:07.165 --> 02:09:07.405
Would you?

02:09:07.947 --> 02:09:08.948
Would you both agree with that?

02:09:08.968 --> 02:09:10.609
Yeah, I think we're in the evidence-based camp.

02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:25.083
I mean, I think the idea that we should recommend a booster for healthy people in perpetuity, that is, a young girl born today in her average lifespan will get 80 of these COVID boosters, that is a theory, okay?

02:09:25.163 --> 02:09:29.927
And with hepatitis B, the number ends up being two or three.

02:09:31.068 --> 02:09:33.869
HPV, the number ends up being two or three, depending on your age.

02:09:33.969 --> 02:09:38.691
With MMR, the number ends up being two in the United States, one in some other countries.

02:09:39.252 --> 02:09:46.675
And so somebody can make an argument just to keep going with MMR annually for the rest of your life, but there's a general recognition

02:09:47.375 --> 02:09:50.758
that you sort of optimize your cellular immunity after a certain number.

02:09:50.818 --> 02:09:54.021
And so there's still a scientific unknown.

02:09:54.401 --> 02:09:58.625
That is, is the blind boosters in perpetuity with no clinical trial?

02:09:59.606 --> 02:10:05.331
And let's be honest, that's what some people are suggesting.

02:10:06.368 --> 02:10:07.310
Are you stunned yet?

02:10:08.011 --> 02:10:17.105
Are you stunned at the lack of depth and understanding, the lack of insight, the lack of progress in five years after having spent all those hours streaming with ZDogg?

02:10:17.125 --> 02:10:18.648
They still don't know jack shit.

02:10:22.017 --> 02:10:22.257
Wow.

02:10:22.457 --> 02:10:28.263
We do not do any more randomized trials and just keep going forever in infinity.

02:10:28.423 --> 02:10:29.404
I might have to escape for a second.

02:10:29.424 --> 02:10:30.244
With boosters every year.

02:10:30.525 --> 02:10:31.605
There's so many problems.

02:10:31.625 --> 02:10:32.947
Having a little crash problem.

02:10:33.087 --> 02:10:34.068
Yeah, of course.

02:10:34.088 --> 02:10:38.091
Which I guess is a nice way of putting what had been the status quo for a long time.

02:10:38.812 --> 02:10:40.653
Among those problems is, why only once a year?

02:10:40.673 --> 02:10:41.935
I hope it's not messing with the stream at all.

02:10:41.955 --> 02:10:42.995
Why not every three months?

02:10:43.015 --> 02:10:43.456
Or every four months?

02:10:43.476 --> 02:10:44.217
Man, oh man, it's maddening.

02:10:44.237 --> 02:10:44.837
Or every six months?

02:10:44.897 --> 02:10:45.978
And why not 18 months?

02:10:46.078 --> 02:10:47.519
You know, it's also sort of random.

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.960
Yeah, I don't know why that works like that.

02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:52.001
Sometimes it doesn't work.

02:10:54.261 --> 02:10:56.362
I could go on with that, I guess, but I won't.

02:10:56.782 --> 02:10:59.022
It's been a long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:59.542 --> 02:11:01.403
That's all I can really express it as.

02:11:01.423 --> 02:11:02.703
A long, strange trip.

02:11:03.323 --> 02:11:04.223
And I need some lunch.

02:11:05.484 --> 02:11:11.205
So, you know, if you don't understand the trap you're in, then you're not going to get out.

02:11:11.625 --> 02:11:14.806
And if you don't understand how these people were put in place,

02:11:15.806 --> 02:11:27.833
and auditioned and were selected and are now placeholding like Ronald McDonald or the guy in the mouse suit at Chuck E. Cheese, then you're not seeing the danger that America is in.

02:11:28.474 --> 02:11:33.617
We have been infiltrated by traitors, and these people are lying to us about it.

02:11:33.777 --> 02:11:37.199
They are lying about their motives and who's put them there.

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:47.047
And I don't know the answer from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:11:47.187 --> 02:11:56.114
But what I can tell you as an American is that these people in the middle here, especially Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are two key players in this illusion.

02:11:57.055 --> 02:12:04.039
There are lots of other American traders that I could mention, but they have less of a role in the maintenance of the narrative.

02:12:04.079 --> 02:12:05.179
They just do what they're told.

02:12:05.579 --> 02:12:07.801
Their Substack puts out whatever they let them put out.

02:12:08.521 --> 02:12:11.582
You don't even have to attribute Substack to the author anymore.

02:12:11.642 --> 02:12:24.349
You can just assume that they could be putting AI articles out on anything they wanted to because they have been using Substack as a training tool for their chatbots already for a long time.

02:12:25.393 --> 02:12:34.004
And so Robert Malone might put out one article a week and five of them might be produced by a chat bot that already uses his previous writing to write something similar.

02:12:34.765 --> 02:12:39.071
And he just has to give it a few other articles and say, write something like this for me.

02:12:39.431 --> 02:12:40.633
And that's not magic.

02:12:42.128 --> 02:12:47.093
That's just machine learning and brute force and that being used against you.

02:12:47.193 --> 02:12:54.381
And so you should be afraid of it, but you should be afraid of it if it is weaponized against you using liars that represent it as real.

02:12:54.461 --> 02:12:58.205
Not if it's just AI, it's when liars use it.

02:12:58.725 --> 02:13:04.391
And when liars work together, because then it's very, very difficult to win.

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:12.009
And so you're in condition that we will not call autism.

02:13:12.049 --> 02:13:13.791
We're not going to like the word autism.

02:13:14.431 --> 02:13:15.632
Um, he was vaccine damage.

02:13:15.672 --> 02:13:22.498
We're not going to change Brian hooker either, unless we wake him up and he breaks free, but he's part of this script.

02:13:22.558 --> 02:13:28.183
He is going to release the Simpson wood data, which will show that autism is more prevalent in black kids.

02:13:29.964 --> 02:13:35.849
And that will be part of a another, you know, knocking another layer of the foundation out.

02:13:39.068 --> 02:13:42.351
and undermining the trust in America's government even more.

02:13:42.391 --> 02:13:47.876
And only half of America will believe that narrative, of course, because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:13:48.036 --> 02:13:51.099
and his accolades will be the delivery mechanism.

02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:54.302
Donald Trump will be the delivery mechanism.

02:13:54.322 --> 02:14:01.028
And so this fracture is going to continue, and they're going to continue to use these people as pawns, and they will continue to use you

02:14:01.866 --> 02:14:10.553
insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:14:10.853 --> 02:14:12.835
If you let them use you, they will use you.

02:14:12.875 --> 02:14:16.618
Transfections rather than vaccines.

02:14:17.398 --> 02:14:19.360
And they will stand in front of you for years.

02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:22.723
They will deny your existence for years if they are a part of this.

02:14:22.803 --> 02:14:30.269
And Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying had all of my tutelage for almost a whole year and knew everything that you know now, but didn't tell you.

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:37.022
and in fact slow rolled it because they are part of this national security narrative control on the internet.

02:14:37.802 --> 02:14:52.226
These people were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure the damage from transfection could be effectively blamed on the novel virus and specifically the spike protein, as you heard Dr. Jordan Vaughn say two days ago in front of our Congress.

02:14:53.647 --> 02:14:55.447
And the way they do it is just like that.

02:14:55.547 --> 02:14:57.448
They put you in front of five people,

02:14:57.964 --> 02:15:12.992
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy.

02:15:13.172 --> 02:15:15.373
You see those eyeballs pop out right there?

02:15:15.393 --> 02:15:18.714
I couldn't believe what he was saying when he said it.

02:15:19.995 --> 02:15:24.918
And I had seven minutes to present what I thought, and then these people all confused me afterward.

02:15:26.158 --> 02:15:27.399
They all know who I am.

02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:36.797
I have recordings of Jessica Rose telling me that my story about the clones kept her up at night, and she's sure that's what happened.

02:15:37.878 --> 02:15:38.419
JJ!

02:15:38.439 --> 02:15:42.143
JJ, are you going to tell them about the mixed tape analogy?

02:15:42.183 --> 02:15:43.685
Because that really worked for me.

02:15:50.026 --> 02:15:51.368
I'm mad, ladies and gentlemen.

02:15:51.408 --> 02:15:51.968
I'm mad.

02:15:52.008 --> 02:15:52.829
I'm really mad.

02:15:52.849 --> 02:15:54.852
I'm mad because I've been played.

02:15:54.872 --> 02:15:59.997
I'm mad because they use me to play a lot of people, including my friend, Nathan, who's dead.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.603
And I want some revenge.

02:16:04.743 --> 02:16:05.844
I want some justice.

02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:07.987
I want something to happen.

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:11.602
I want something to happen.

02:16:11.642 --> 02:16:12.964
I want somebody to wake up.

02:16:13.024 --> 02:16:15.846
I want America to wake up because the right is trapped.

02:16:15.866 --> 02:16:17.028
The left is trapped.

02:16:17.048 --> 02:16:17.908
We're all trapped.

02:16:18.429 --> 02:16:23.374
And so, you know, we're trapped because we use social media the way we do.

02:16:24.435 --> 02:16:28.980
The left probably doesn't know who Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are.

02:16:29.955 --> 02:16:39.439
And if you see my stream and you're on the left, what you should be thinking is, wow, do they have a whole nother set of actors for the conservative side of America?

02:16:39.479 --> 02:16:44.481
And I'm watching a set of actors on the progressive side of America.

02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:48.602
And could it be that they're both the same malevolent show?

02:16:49.282 --> 02:16:52.804
I've never thought about that before, but that's what my message is.

02:16:53.964 --> 02:16:58.426
Donald Trump and the Trump administration is mostly composed of Democrats.

02:16:59.383 --> 02:17:02.766
The only one you have to believe is not a Democrat is Trump.

02:17:03.587 --> 02:17:05.329
And the whole illusion is sustained.

02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:16.380
All you have to do is go back to that one dunk where Hillary says something about the tax code and Donald Trump says, that makes me smart.

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:17.641
All of your friends do it.

02:17:19.056 --> 02:17:21.136
That was a dunk that was scripted.

02:17:21.657 --> 02:17:37.080
And once you see that as scripted, and the near miss in Butler, Pennsylvania as scripted, and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:43.721
as scripted by Tony Lyons in 2008, then you can see where we are.

02:17:44.847 --> 02:17:48.950
We are in the midst of a coup, so to speak.

02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:53.072
American government is out of our control, ladies and gentlemen.

02:17:53.092 --> 02:17:55.493
The American government is out of your control.

02:17:55.514 --> 02:17:59.856
And I don't think Big Pharma has control of it.

02:17:59.896 --> 02:18:01.957
I don't think the DOD has control of it.

02:18:01.997 --> 02:18:14.325
I think the national security state is one malevolent group of people, of insiders, that when they decide the fire alarm has been pulled, they are willing to lie about what they're actually doing.

02:18:15.882 --> 02:18:21.907
They have been chosen because they are willing to lie about what they're actually doing and not look behind the curtain.

02:18:24.189 --> 02:18:33.938
And those people have been put in place in all of these organizations so that they are all essentially traps where nobody will effectively get out.

02:18:34.318 --> 02:18:39.183
The same way that social media is used against you, those organizations are used against you.

02:18:39.203 --> 02:18:41.825
They're part of the same malevolent symphony.

02:18:43.587 --> 02:18:47.513
And the theme that runs through this malevolent symphony is this bad biology.

02:18:47.634 --> 02:18:49.937
It's you're a consequence of your genes.

02:18:50.799 --> 02:18:51.460
Racism.

02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:53.643
Evolution because DNA.

02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:57.271
And we can get rid of that by teaching our kids something different.

02:18:57.411 --> 02:19:01.332
We can get rid of that by teaching our kids that endemicity is a myth.

02:19:02.052 --> 02:19:08.634
They've taken an irreducibly complex background and told us a cartoon story because this is about all the grandchildren of Earth.

02:19:08.714 --> 02:19:14.976
That's why there's an anti-vax movement that's actually fake in America and why none of these people seem to be aware of it.

02:19:16.403 --> 02:19:33.690
None of these people on the internet seem to be aware of the fact that America is being attacked and destroyed by a health freedom movement that has been faked for two decades and has its roots in the UK and in Peter Daszak, Polly Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield.

02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:34.410
It's remarkable.

02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:44.995
It's remarkable that these people don't see that this goes all the way back to Hilary Koprowski and Stanley Plotkin and Maurice Hilleman and all these guys

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:49.178
who established this narrative and this mythology.

02:19:49.719 --> 02:19:52.360
The maintainers of it now are just acolytes.

02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.201
They're stooges.

02:19:53.801 --> 02:20:00.584
This irreducibly complex background has been reduced to a single signal by non-specific PCR tests.

02:20:00.644 --> 02:20:01.385
It's a fraud.

02:20:01.885 --> 02:20:09.129
It's a global fraud because using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real or does it make you a ghostbuster?

02:20:09.189 --> 02:20:11.090
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:13.451
Thanks for tolerating my long shows.

02:20:14.532 --> 02:20:15.733
And please share them.

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.174
Have a great weekend.

02:20:17.735 --> 02:20:19.276
I don't know if I'll be online or not.

02:20:19.296 --> 02:20:24.820
I think I'm going to make my first JC on the hardwood video again this weekend.

02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:25.601
I'm feeling it.

02:20:26.461 --> 02:20:27.722
I'll see how I feel tomorrow.

02:20:28.583 --> 02:20:31.665
But I think I'm going to shoot the first one again.

02:20:33.887 --> 02:20:34.948
I made my 8,000th jump shot.

02:20:36.909 --> 02:20:41.533
in the last 100 days or so yesterday, which is kind of cool.

02:20:43.694 --> 02:20:44.695
I've been shooting a lot.

02:20:45.155 --> 02:20:47.977
I think I've taken... I can show you right now.

02:20:47.997 --> 02:20:53.301
I can show you on the app.

02:20:56.184 --> 02:21:03.569
It'll show you how many shots I've taken and how many I've made since I started preparing for the...

02:21:05.711 --> 02:21:08.874
for the transition to JC on the hardwood.

02:21:08.914 --> 02:21:12.757
So I'm going to show you the app that I have on my phone for this thing.

02:21:14.019 --> 02:21:15.520
Can I do that now like this?

02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:15.900
Yes.

02:21:16.641 --> 02:21:19.383
So never mind the camera taking pictures.

02:21:19.864 --> 02:21:24.929
I've been there 108 days in the last roughly three and a half months.

02:21:25.849 --> 02:21:34.136
My shot percentage is 52% and I've made 8,193 shots out of 15,661 taken.

02:21:34.196 --> 02:21:35.977
Every one of those shots is a jump shot.

02:21:37.339 --> 02:21:40.561
And here's my arc and depth and left and right.

02:21:40.601 --> 02:21:41.322
I'm doing okay.

02:21:41.842 --> 02:21:44.164
And if you look at the history, it's kind of cool.

02:21:44.664 --> 02:21:50.529
It'll even give you the last workout and it'll give you where all the shots were, where you were shooting from.

02:21:52.151 --> 02:21:53.972
It's really, really slick.

02:21:54.153 --> 02:21:55.494
And so I've improved a lot.

02:21:55.714 --> 02:21:58.797
I'm in a lot better shape after 14,000 shots.

02:21:58.857 --> 02:21:59.678
I trust me on that.

02:21:59.718 --> 02:22:00.699
I'm in a lot better shape.

02:22:01.199 --> 02:22:04.342
And so I won't make such a huff and puff of myself on the hard way.

02:22:04.362 --> 02:22:05.303
I'm looking forward to it.

02:22:05.363 --> 02:22:06.104
Thanks for being here.

02:22:06.124 --> 02:22:07.565
See you guys again soon.

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:08.866
Have a great weekend.
