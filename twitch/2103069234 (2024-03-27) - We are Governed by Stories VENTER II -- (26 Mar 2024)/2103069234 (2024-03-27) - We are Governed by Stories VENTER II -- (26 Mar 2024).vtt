00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
I may need to just briefly check to see if I can find myself on YouTube and then see

00:13.000 --> 00:24.120
what's going on here should be live right now but I'm not which is weird go live I

00:24.200 --> 00:30.080
should be live right now because I using that same key excellent connection it says

00:30.080 --> 00:39.280
so why am I not live it says viewers will be able to find your stream once you go

00:39.280 --> 00:53.840
live but the privacy is unlisted so it should be public done save but I'm not

00:53.840 --> 01:04.520
there I don't see any copy I'm gonna stop this and I'm gonna modify it I'm

01:04.520 --> 01:09.100
gonna put this key in I'm gonna paste it down I'm gonna say okay and then I'm

01:09.100 --> 01:16.440
gonna start it what does it do now it says I'm not doing it anymore on there

01:16.440 --> 01:24.520
goes live on YouTube it's yes live on YouTube it's alright we're there we're

01:24.520 --> 01:29.080
live on the YouTube as well so here we go ladies and gentlemen thank you very

01:29.080 --> 01:33.560
much for joining me let's do this thing peer tube should be up can you check

01:33.560 --> 01:39.320
that for me peer tube should be up we should be live there I see myself live

01:39.320 --> 01:44.400
there I should also be on rumble peer to good here we go ladies and gentlemen

01:44.400 --> 01:47.120
thanks for joining me

02:14.400 --> 02:36.160
thank you very much the latest data tells us that we're dealing with

02:36.160 --> 02:39.160
essentially a worst case

02:56.560 --> 03:03.240
what kind of link did you put in there that YouTube video what is that and enjoy

03:03.240 --> 03:14.600
skip to six minutes and enjoy what's that all about I'm curious what that is I

03:14.600 --> 03:19.600
think truth is good for kids we're so busy lying we don't even recognize the

03:19.600 --> 03:24.240
truth no more in this society we want everybody to feel good that's not that's

03:24.240 --> 03:31.000
not the way life is but you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of

03:31.000 --> 03:36.360
feel it in people and I have lied I'm sure I'll lie again I don't want to lie

03:36.360 --> 03:40.000
you know I don't think I'm a liar I try not to be a liar I don't want to be a

03:40.000 --> 03:45.600
liar I think it's like really important not to be a liar

04:01.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar

04:31.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm a liar I'm a liar I am a liar I am a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a modifier I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a

05:01.000 --> 05:03.480
Afternoon, I'm 20 minutes late again,

05:03.480 --> 05:06.120
but that seems to be the way it is.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.960
20 minutes late, but on time, so to speak.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.320
Business can go on biological.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.080
We are still trying to dispel the mythology

05:19.080 --> 05:21.360
that people are doubling and tripling down on,

05:21.360 --> 05:23.240
and we're trying to dispel that mythology,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.240
that enchantment with some knowledge.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.160
If you've been staying focused on the biology,

05:29.160 --> 05:30.840
you are not drowning in this way.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.440
You've been skillfully using TV and social media.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.560
You might be in big trouble,

05:35.560 --> 05:37.280
but if you stay focused on the biology,

05:37.280 --> 05:39.680
you don't take the pain on those systems,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.720
and you love your neighbor, you can escape.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
I do believe that.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.560
I do believe there's hope.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.320
And most of the hope comes from the fact

05:46.320 --> 05:49.360
that people are still sharing this work after four years.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.720
Still think that this is a viable message.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.240
You can find it at gigahomebiological.com,

05:55.240 --> 06:00.200
gigahome.bio, and stream.gigahome.bio.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.400
There are ways to support the links, share the links.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.960
We're trying to do our best to make sure

06:05.960 --> 06:09.120
that we can get it out as far as we can.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.720
My friends and friends next day.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.960
And so that's why I haven't done a sub stack

06:16.960 --> 06:18.800
in more than a week, which is not good,

06:18.800 --> 06:20.440
but I do have one translated.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.720
I just haven't done the transcript,

06:23.720 --> 06:26.520
which is, I admit, is frustrating.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.000
I also have an updated this list,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.520
which is also frustrating.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.320
But I have a lot of things that I'm working on

06:32.320 --> 06:35.040
that I think are more important than updating this list,

06:35.040 --> 06:36.680
even though I do appreciate it.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.440
We are going to update it soon.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.120
I really think there's work to be done.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.720
Everybody that's supporting this stream,

06:42.720 --> 06:47.080
I think, understands very well what we're up against.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.840
And so, if your name is not on this list

06:49.840 --> 06:51.200
and it should be, please forgive me.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.200
It will be there in a couple of days.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.360
And the list is slowly growing,

06:56.360 --> 06:58.880
but we could use always more subscribers.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.200
We're far lower than we need to be.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.800
If this is gonna be a real sustainable action,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.600
we can't run on fumes forever,

07:06.600 --> 07:10.280
but my wife and my family will do it as long as I can.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.840
This is the independent bright web.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.080
That means that we're not sponsored by anybody but you.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.520
We don't have, we're not selling lotion or soap

07:18.520 --> 07:23.520
or neutraceuticals, none of that stuff.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.680
We are just supported by people with kids,

07:27.680 --> 07:29.200
people who lost jobs,

07:30.520 --> 07:34.040
people who are trying to engage in United Noncompliance

07:34.040 --> 07:38.560
and establish the system,

07:38.560 --> 07:41.520
the network of people that can help you

07:41.520 --> 07:43.480
engage in United Noncompliance.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.640
I hope that's what GINGO and biological will be

07:45.640 --> 07:49.200
in the future is a network hub for people engaged

07:49.200 --> 07:51.640
in United Non Compliance.

07:57.680 --> 08:04.680
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,

08:04.680 --> 08:07.680
this is GINGO, biological and high resistance.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.240
Low noise information we've brought to you by a biologist.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.200
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

08:12.200 --> 08:13.280
in the back of my garage.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.560
It is the 27th of March, 2024.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.320
I am a human just like you fighting

08:18.320 --> 08:19.880
for our grandchildren's future,

08:19.880 --> 08:21.680
our grandchildren's freedom,

08:21.680 --> 08:23.920
our grandchildren's informed consent.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.360
And I hope you are too.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.360
If you're joining me for the first time,

08:27.360 --> 08:32.000
GINGO and biological is a news source

08:32.000 --> 08:34.600
that is more than well aware of the idea

08:34.600 --> 08:37.240
that we've been consciously and intelligently manipulated

08:37.240 --> 08:40.200
in our habits and in our opinions for decades

08:40.200 --> 08:42.560
and that this has only increased in power

08:42.560 --> 08:47.560
and in its all encompassing application to our lives

08:48.240 --> 08:50.880
with the advent of the cell phone and the internet.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.800
These social media apps have been weaponized also

08:55.840 --> 08:58.600
from the perspective of who these people are

08:58.600 --> 09:00.080
and who is on them.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.200
You can see all kinds of people in this picture

09:03.200 --> 09:07.240
that I believe are very much in on this.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.640
You can look at the picture behind me

09:09.640 --> 09:11.760
and you can find lots of people

09:11.760 --> 09:14.520
who have wittingly and unwittingly contributed

09:14.520 --> 09:19.120
to this slow motion demolition of Western society

09:19.120 --> 09:22.360
and particular the jewel of Western society,

09:22.360 --> 09:23.640
the United States of America.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.280
And it's not because we do everything right

09:25.400 --> 09:27.040
because all of our teams are the best

09:27.040 --> 09:30.560
or because we win the gold medals.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.000
It's because our system is the one

09:33.000 --> 09:34.960
that has that inertia built into it

09:34.960 --> 09:38.760
around free speech and other protected freedoms.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.120
That inertia is what they need us to kind of discount

09:43.120 --> 09:46.840
as valuable and not be vigilant enough to guard

09:46.840 --> 09:50.680
and to eventually just give up for our children

09:50.680 --> 09:55.000
or not teach our children the level of vigilance

09:55.000 --> 09:57.720
that's necessary in order to preserve those freedoms.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.880
I think that's where we are.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.440
And they have been consciously manipulating our opinions

10:01.440 --> 10:04.000
about these freedoms for decades on purpose.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.360
And the last manipulation that occurred indeed

10:06.360 --> 10:10.440
was the declaration of a coronavirus pandemic

10:10.440 --> 10:13.760
wherein most of our understanding of public health

10:13.760 --> 10:17.720
was permanently shaken and we are now just basically

10:17.720 --> 10:19.640
under the influence of a mythology

10:19.640 --> 10:21.400
and those people who are willing

10:21.400 --> 10:24.280
to spectacularly commit to it.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.960
To the mythology.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.680
And that's why we haven't been able

10:29.680 --> 10:31.200
to exercise informed consent.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.040
That mythology is based around an ongoing RNA viral pandemic

10:36.040 --> 10:39.320
that has changed color, that has changed flavor

10:39.320 --> 10:43.360
and has changed flavor in a very uniform planetary manner.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.360
It is a phenomenon at a molecular level

10:46.360 --> 10:49.720
that we have never witnessed anything remotely close to it

10:49.720 --> 10:50.760
in the past.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.320
It is blamed on things as simple as a few bases

10:54.320 --> 10:56.600
or a few amino acids which encode

10:56.600 --> 10:58.160
an extra fear and cleavage site

10:58.160 --> 11:00.360
or an extra poly basic cleavage site.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.600
And with with those a few basic mythological assumptions

11:04.600 --> 11:07.200
inserted into the storyline carefully on the left

11:07.200 --> 11:10.280
and the right by actors that were agreed to disagree.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.480
We now believe that variants are trackable

11:12.480 --> 11:14.000
and that their evidence of evolution.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.520
We believe that lockdown would have done correctly

11:16.520 --> 11:19.440
prevents the spread of dangerous viruses like this one.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.160
And that we believe that without strictly regulations

11:22.200 --> 11:25.200
these kinds of gain of function things will happen again.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.560
We are being led to believe that this faith

11:28.560 --> 11:30.440
is something that we cannot question

11:30.440 --> 11:33.440
and we've been led to believe it by different narratives.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.000
Narratives were different in Australia

11:35.000 --> 11:37.200
than they were in Europe than they were in America.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.240
The number of participants that come out of the audience

11:40.240 --> 11:43.560
pretending to be innocent audience members

11:43.560 --> 11:46.160
when really they're participating in the illusion

11:46.160 --> 11:48.440
was different depending on what country you're in.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.000
But I in America, I assure you that we were involved

11:52.000 --> 11:55.480
in a magic show and audience members

11:55.480 --> 11:57.920
were pulled out of the audience and brought on stage.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.120
And we were made to believe that those people

12:00.120 --> 12:02.120
were innocently participating in the show

12:02.120 --> 12:03.840
when they were not.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.440
They were definitely not.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.240
And those same people now agree across the board

12:11.240 --> 12:13.040
that transfection isn't bad.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.440
Transfection probably saved millions of lives

12:15.440 --> 12:18.100
even if it also injured hundreds of thousands.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.360
That's where we are.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.160
And unfortunately, the faith in the novel virus

12:24.160 --> 12:26.520
going on for five years is now converting

12:26.520 --> 12:28.400
into a faith in a novel biology

12:28.400 --> 12:30.680
that again includes the biology of the virus,

12:30.680 --> 12:32.760
which is the fear and cleavage site

12:32.760 --> 12:34.680
as evidence of laboratory leak

12:34.680 --> 12:39.160
and then the complete unnecessary effort

12:39.160 --> 12:42.920
to track this thing all over the place

12:42.920 --> 12:44.720
but then not look at any epitopes

12:44.720 --> 12:48.040
that we were told to be afraid of from the very beginning.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.360
It's laughable to me that people who have claimed

12:51.360 --> 12:52.720
that the fear and cleavage site

12:52.720 --> 12:57.280
is a singular attribute of the virus

12:57.280 --> 13:00.040
which can contribute to both its infectivity

13:00.040 --> 13:02.960
and also its rapid spread around the world

13:02.960 --> 13:05.480
never bothered to keep track of it.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.040
Not even in one strain, not even commenting

13:08.040 --> 13:10.960
on whether the fear and cleavage site had optimized

13:10.960 --> 13:12.640
or disappeared in any of the strains

13:12.640 --> 13:14.040
and they still don't care.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.840
And if that doesn't strike you as odd,

13:17.840 --> 13:19.080
I don't know what to tell you

13:19.080 --> 13:21.600
because those same people are also convinced

13:21.600 --> 13:23.840
as they were in 2020,

13:23.840 --> 13:25.840
that there would be neurological side effects

13:25.840 --> 13:29.160
that at first started from the traveling of the virus

13:29.160 --> 13:33.480
up the olfactory bulb and into the brain directly

13:33.480 --> 13:35.480
but it also had to do with the spike protein

13:35.480 --> 13:37.920
and its ability to cause other proteins to fold

13:37.920 --> 13:40.920
by some heretofore, undescribed pre-onogenic

13:40.920 --> 13:43.520
or amyloidogenic mechanisms.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.680
These terms and these potentials

13:46.680 --> 13:51.680
were thrown around as often and as frequently as possible

13:52.520 --> 13:55.240
by a number of actors on the left and the right,

13:55.240 --> 13:57.800
on the front and the back in the mainstream media

13:57.800 --> 14:00.480
and on social media backwaters.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.240
And they were all united on these things very early

14:03.240 --> 14:06.000
which is odd because they're still central

14:06.000 --> 14:08.360
to the faith in this novel biology.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.520
We keep coming back to these same storylines

14:11.520 --> 14:15.240
that just don't have a basis in biology

14:15.240 --> 14:18.320
playing little clips where virologists complain

14:18.320 --> 14:21.640
about fear and cleavage sites is not sufficient evidence

14:21.640 --> 14:25.240
to explain how a few amino acids or a few bases

14:25.240 --> 14:30.240
in an mRNA, a modified RNA, a synthetic RNA spilled

14:30.240 --> 14:33.360
on the ground could result in pandemic coverage

14:33.360 --> 14:37.680
of that same molecule and insists that it has to do

14:37.680 --> 14:41.200
with this particular set of bases, it's absurd

14:41.200 --> 14:43.400
but they're still doing it now.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.880
The same fake people that claim to be really interested

14:47.880 --> 14:50.040
in finding the origin and really interested

14:50.040 --> 14:53.400
in catching the bad guys that are really interested

14:53.400 --> 14:56.480
in blaming eco-health alliance and the diffuse proposal.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.200
These clowns are the same clowns who were saying this stuff

15:00.200 --> 15:02.440
in 2020 with less evidence,

15:04.040 --> 15:06.600
with less basis for these speculations

15:06.600 --> 15:08.800
but they were just as certain back then.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.800
And there's still video evidence of these people

15:13.800 --> 15:16.800
and their certainty online freely available for you

15:16.800 --> 15:19.800
to go and check that these aren't new ideas.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.800
These are ideas that were planted very early

15:21.800 --> 15:26.800
by a coordinated obviously group of people loosely connected

15:27.800 --> 15:29.800
to a couple of weaponized piles of money.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.800
That's the best way I can describe it

15:31.800 --> 15:35.800
and if we don't break this faith in a novel virus

15:35.800 --> 15:37.800
that was probably a conflated background signal

15:37.800 --> 15:42.800
be it actual endosomes, exosomes, viruses, whatever

15:43.800 --> 15:47.800
or be it just genetic noise in the background

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
as the cartoon up there just changed to.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.800
Either way, a noise signal in the background

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
that we weren't detecting but could be detected

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
that was then misconstrued as spread

15:58.800 --> 16:02.800
is a very parsimonious explanation for what really happened.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.800
It's funny because no one with any social media reach

16:07.800 --> 16:10.800
has ever even bothered to consider the possibility.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.800
That's the one possibility that Kevin McCurnan,

16:13.800 --> 16:17.800
Jessica Rose, John Bodewin, Steve Kirsch,

16:17.800 --> 16:22.800
Robert Malone, Robbie Kennedy Jr., Peter McCullough,

16:22.800 --> 16:25.800
Jay Bhattacharya, anybody that's ever talked to me

16:25.800 --> 16:28.800
when they hear me say that, that's the one thing that they,

16:28.800 --> 16:31.800
I don't know, I can't really understand that.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.800
I don't fully get it. You'll have to explain that.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.800
I can't really think about that hypothesis.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.800
That's hard for me. That's outside of my expertise.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.800
How many times have I heard that nonsense about clones?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.800
How about transfection and about previous

16:45.800 --> 16:48.800
and conflated background signals over and over again?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.800
These people who see me in person meet me at parties,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.800
take selfies with me and tell me how great they love my stream

16:55.800 --> 16:59.800
but they just can't verify or think about some of the ideas.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.800
They're really compelling, but it's not my expertise.

17:03.800 --> 17:10.800
They've had four years, just like I have, just like Mark has,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800
just like George Webb has.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
We've all had four years and somehow or another,

17:14.800 --> 17:18.800
they still have their heads in the exact same holes.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
That's how you know that they're...

17:23.800 --> 17:26.800
Scientific questions, I think, are very hard to get a handle on.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.800
The reason for this is that in late modernity,

17:30.800 --> 17:34.800
which we're living in, there's simply too much knowledge

17:34.800 --> 17:37.800
for any individual human to understand all of it.

17:37.800 --> 17:43.800
In this world of extreme paper specialization

17:43.800 --> 17:48.800
where it's narrower and narrower subsets of experts policing themselves

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
and talking about how great they are,

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
the string theorists talking about how great string theory is,

17:52.800 --> 17:55.800
the cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer,

17:55.800 --> 17:59.800
the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum computer

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
that will be a massive breakthrough.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.800
If you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening,

18:04.800 --> 18:06.800
people just don't have the authority for this.

18:06.800 --> 18:11.800
This is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge

18:11.800 --> 18:15.800
than you would have had in 1800 or even in 1900.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.800
1800 Goethe could still understand just about everything.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.800
1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
And so the sort of...

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
Oh, I'm in the wrong...

18:27.800 --> 18:31.800
I think it has made it a much harder question to get a handle on.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.800
So I would say that he is misleading the young with this presentation

18:35.800 --> 18:38.800
because he is calling knowledge that's not knowledge.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.800
It should be called noise.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.800
We have come to acknowledge those of us who understand

18:43.800 --> 18:46.800
what academic biology and science has become

18:46.800 --> 18:51.800
with the P-value hypothesis falsification thing

18:51.800 --> 18:56.800
from Paparian science has created a scenario where

18:56.800 --> 19:03.800
there is much more noise in our academic understanding of the world.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.800
And so he's suggesting that that noise is knowledge

19:06.800 --> 19:10.800
and it's just so specialized and so detailed

19:10.800 --> 19:13.800
that people can't be general scholars anymore.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.800
And that's absolutely not true.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.800
What he is suggesting is that young people don't bother to try.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.800
What he is suggesting is that young people don't bother to try.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.800
Now, with a little bit of work,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
I feel like that I've always been there.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.800
I've always been trying to integrate across fields as best I can

19:34.800 --> 19:36.800
as a biologist at heart.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.800
And so for me, this has always been the shortcoming of neuroscience.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.800
Is that the specialization makes it very hard for us to evaluate

19:45.800 --> 19:47.800
what each other is doing.

19:47.800 --> 19:52.800
And very hard to understand where the real cutting edge of understanding is.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
And it's almost by design.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.800
And I was frustrated by it, but I didn't know how to express that.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
I didn't know why I was frustrated.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.800
And I didn't know at the heart of it was this ritual of probability

20:04.800 --> 20:09.800
and falsification that created the illusion of progress.

20:09.800 --> 20:15.800
And so he's not saying that even though I assure you he understands it perfectly.

20:16.800 --> 20:21.800
He is signaling to some people and he is enchanting others.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.800
That's the beauty of this.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.800
Using the right code words, everybody that knows that he's the head

20:28.800 --> 20:33.800
of a giant weaponized pile of money and that he's the head of a information

20:33.800 --> 20:39.800
algorithmic mining DoD operation called Palantir.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.800
Then you know that he's not saying exactly what he means.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.800
But if you're just a casual listener to the portal podcast on its eighth episode

20:48.800 --> 20:51.800
or its second episode or its first episode.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.800
And then what you hear is somebody you think is telling the truth.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.800
But if he was telling you the truth, then he would have listed cancer

21:01.800 --> 21:06.800
and quantum computing and virology.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.800
And molecular biology and neuroscience.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.800
As places where it's very hard to tell how much progress is really being made.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.800
And in fact, in many of these fields, it may not be being made.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.800
So he listed a couple, but he didn't list them all.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
And so is that lying?

21:30.800 --> 21:35.800
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.800
And I have lied.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
I'm sure I'll lie again.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
I don't want to lie.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.800
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
I try not to be a liar.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
I don't want to be a liar.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.800
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.800
It's really important not to be a liar, says Tucker Carlson, the professional liar.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.800
The critical cut I have on the specialization is always that if you analyze

21:56.800 --> 21:59.800
the politics of science, the specialization should make you suspicious.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
It's because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.800
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.800
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

22:09.800 --> 22:14.800
So they are lying and exaggerating.

22:14.800 --> 22:19.800
Just like Peter Thiel says, they are lying and exaggerating about the fidelity of

22:19.800 --> 22:24.800
understanding in virology, the fidelity of understanding in cancer biology,

22:24.800 --> 22:28.800
the fidelity of understanding in the genetic causes of childhood diseases.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.800
They are feigning this.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.800
Every time they do a TED talk about what's going to happen in 10 years and about what

22:36.800 --> 22:39.800
the AI is going to do and about what climate change is going to happen,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
they are feigning this knowledge.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.800
They are feigning this certainty because the hyperspecialization of science

22:45.800 --> 22:50.800
and the use of reiterative, prepare and falsification of hypotheses has

22:50.800 --> 22:55.800
allowed the creation of this noise that is being misconstrued by people as

22:55.800 --> 22:58.800
powerful as Peter Thiel as knowledge.

22:59.800 --> 23:04.800
And if people as powerful as Peter Thiel and the puppets that he puts on the

23:04.800 --> 23:08.800
internet and promotes, like the Weinstein brothers are going to say that

23:08.800 --> 23:12.800
this guy is right, then we have an illusion of consensus.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.800
And that's what the intellectual dark web provided them.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.800
An illusion of consensus that could be used to govern, that could be used to

23:20.800 --> 23:25.800
influence the very opinions and habits of the masses.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.800
Just like Edward Bernays described, just like Noam Chomsky described a

23:32.800 --> 23:36.800
limited spectrum of debate within which there is a very lively discussion

23:38.800 --> 23:42.800
within which you can even encourage the most critical views

23:43.800 --> 23:49.800
because even the most critical views reinforce the presuppositions of the state.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.800
In this case, the presuppositions are the model of reality.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.800
The model of reality that they have been enforcing is one of lots of viruses,

23:59.800 --> 24:03.800
lots of pathogens, lots of dirty in the nature.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.800
And lots of things that you need as products to protect you from that,

24:10.800 --> 24:15.800
to detect that, to monitor that, to administer

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
prophylactic for that.

24:19.800 --> 24:26.800
And it's a giant mythology created by our willingness to give over our attention

24:27.800 --> 24:32.800
and our trust to people like him and the applications that they sell us

24:32.800 --> 24:33.800
on our phones.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.800
So I wanted to go back to the video that I watched the other day because we

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
didn't finish it yesterday.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.800
So this is, I'm just going to start it right away.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
Here we go.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.800
This is when Venner comes on stage and he talks about how we've,

24:47.800 --> 24:51.800
we've gone from understanding protein as a genetic material to DNA.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
It's a genetic material.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
I'm going to speed it up through that part.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.800
And then I'm going to set it back to somewhat normal when he gets done

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
with the part that we saw yesterday.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
Thanks for joining me.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.800
Here for yourself as well.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.800
I'd like to welcome Craig Venter who's going to speak about what is life,

25:06.800 --> 25:07.800
a 21st century perspective.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
Craig.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.800
I see in the chat there that somebody's talking about.

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
Thank you for that.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.800
We already heard this part.

25:20.800 --> 25:25.800
I can't stress enough how the power of AI is being used to distort what's

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
actually going on.

25:26.800 --> 25:31.800
I'm going to watch a video tomorrow from 2017 where someone explains to us

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
what's really happening on social media.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.800
It has nothing to do with, with neuronal networks and AI spontaneously

25:38.800 --> 25:42.800
becoming intelligent or, or algorithms that we don't really,

25:42.800 --> 25:43.800
I don't know.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.800
I don't know.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.800
I don't know.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.800
I don't know.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.800
I don't know.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.800
It's a simple, intelligent or, or algorithms that we don't really understand.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.800
It has to do with, as I've said in the last few days, very succinctly,

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
it has to do with simple programming.

25:55.800 --> 26:00.800
If then else, that's it.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.800
Simple programming is enough to put Robert Malone at the top of the feed

26:04.800 --> 26:07.800
and put Jonathan Cooey on somebody else's feed.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.800
It's, it's simple programming is enough to make Jonathan Cooey think his

26:11.800 --> 26:14.800
message is getting out while everybody else doesn't see it.

26:14.800 --> 26:20.980
doesn't see it. It's as simple as that. It doesn't have to be a magic algorithm. You

26:20.980 --> 26:27.920
know what? Approving Remdesivir is as simple as saying that an AI chose it. And that AI

26:27.920 --> 26:33.640
could have been a simple one line code as Mark Housatonic has so eloquently said, if

26:33.640 --> 26:43.120
then else, Remdesivir. And so one of the bamboozledments, one of the greatest illusions that's currently

26:43.120 --> 26:51.840
being foisted upon us is the idea that AI is at the cusp of becoming more than just machine to

26:51.840 --> 26:59.320
control other people more than just a fancy machine. They want you to believe it's something

26:59.320 --> 27:06.600
that's going to have emergent properties very similar to life. And that's an illusion. That's a

27:06.600 --> 27:12.480
mythology. That's not going to happen. Can they use these algorithms and these, these, these

27:12.600 --> 27:22.200
software to control people to manipulate their opinions and their habits? Absolutely. But

27:22.200 --> 27:31.120
it's not gain a function in AI. It's not quantum computing that they were waiting for, or the

27:31.120 --> 27:36.960
big and a big enough computer, or a fast enough CPU. It's already happening right now with if

27:36.960 --> 27:46.400
then else statements, just programming the application to do it. And so when we talk about this, make

27:46.400 --> 27:50.960
sure you understand that part of this long term programming is getting people to think of

27:50.960 --> 27:57.160
themselves as a machine that the ghost in the machine doesn't matter that the sum of the whole

27:57.160 --> 28:03.920
doesn't matter. The whatever the pattern integrity becomes doesn't matter. We are, we are the

28:03.920 --> 28:10.720
Manila rope, we are the hemp rope, we are the nylon rope. That's what he wants us to believe chemistry

28:10.720 --> 28:18.800
and physics to be here for this event. And I was asked earlier whether the goal is to dissect what

28:18.800 --> 28:24.480
Schrodinger had spoken about in Britain, what to prevent, to present the new summary. And I always

28:24.480 --> 28:29.640
like to be forward looking. So I won't give you a history lesson except for very briefly. I will

28:29.640 --> 28:34.320
present our findings on first on reading the genetic code and then learning to synthesize and write

28:34.320 --> 28:38.600
the genetic code. And as many of you know, we synthesized an entire genome, booted it up to

28:38.600 --> 28:44.720
create an entirely new synthetic cell where every protein in the cell was based on the synthetic

28:44.720 --> 28:50.120
DNA code. So as you all know, Schrodinger's book was published in 1944. It was based on a series of

28:50.120 --> 28:55.440
three lectures here starting in February of 1943. And he had to repeat the lectures I read on the

28:55.440 --> 28:59.960
following Monday because the room on the other side of campus was too small. And I understand people

28:59.960 --> 29:03.640
were turned away tonight but were grateful for internet streaming so I don't have to do this

29:03.640 --> 29:10.560
twice. So also do clearly do his historical role and it's interesting to be sharing this event with

29:10.560 --> 29:15.120
Jim Watson who have known and had multiple interactions with over the last 25 years and including most

29:15.120 --> 29:19.080
recently sharing the double helix prize for human genome sequencing with him from Cold Spring Harbor

29:19.080 --> 29:25.320
laboratory a few years ago. Now Schrodinger started his lecture with a key question in an

29:25.320 --> 29:29.040
interesting insight on it. The question was I'll read it. How can the events in space and time which

29:29.040 --> 29:33.000
take place within the boundaries of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?

29:33.000 --> 29:36.880
It's a pretty straightforward, disembow question. And then he sort of answered what he could at the

29:36.880 --> 29:41.160
time. The obvious inability of present day physics and chemistry to account for such events is no

29:41.160 --> 29:47.400
reason at all for doubting that they will be accounted for by those sciences. So while I only have around

29:47.400 --> 29:52.120
40 minutes not three lectures I hope to convince you that there has been substantial progress in the

29:52.120 --> 29:57.240
last nearly 70 years since Schrodinger initially asked that question to the point where the answer is

29:57.240 --> 30:03.360
at least nearly at hand if not in hand. So I view that we're now in what I'm calling the digital age

30:03.360 --> 30:09.920
of biology. My teams work on synthesizing genomes based on digital code in the computer and four

30:09.920 --> 30:14.520
bottles of chemicals illustrates the ultimate link between the computer code and the digital code.

30:15.240 --> 30:20.120
Life is code as you heard in the introduction. It was very clearly articulated by Schrodinger.

30:21.320 --> 30:26.040
I know he's already starting out with a simplification that I didn't plug yesterday but I will now

30:26.680 --> 30:35.720
in that the DNA and the four bases can be translated into a computer code and digitized and then we

30:35.720 --> 30:41.320
have essentially taken that data and transferred it to another medium. What does that assume?

30:42.280 --> 30:47.880
It assumes a lot of things. First of all it assumes that any proteins or RNA that are

30:47.880 --> 30:54.600
associated with that DNA molecule are completely irrelevant and contain no information at all.

30:55.480 --> 31:02.440
It also suggests that the methylation state of the DNA doesn't matter at all and contains no

31:02.440 --> 31:09.800
information relevant to understanding its function. Now we could go on and on and on and on and on

31:10.360 --> 31:15.720
about all the things that's saying that taking DNA in the four bases and turning it into computer

31:15.720 --> 31:21.480
code is digitizing that information. Even if you can take that and make synthetic copy of it and

31:21.480 --> 31:27.000
put it back into a cell structure and get something resembling cell division to occur

31:28.680 --> 31:36.120
still does not say that you understand how that DNA works after you put it into that context that

31:36.120 --> 31:42.920
you can no longer probe. They don't have a bunch of cameras inside of their synthetic cell to

31:42.920 --> 31:48.120
see that everything is functioning and working the way that they think it does and that the DNA

31:48.120 --> 31:54.680
is not being chemically altered or that proteins and chaperone proteins and facilitating proteins

31:54.680 --> 32:00.440
and enzymes and RNA are not binding to that DNA and causing it to integrate back with that

32:00.440 --> 32:08.920
machinery to work properly. And so there are an extraordinary number of assumptions that are

32:08.920 --> 32:15.000
being made in order to simplify our own understanding of this irreducible complexity to make it seem

32:15.000 --> 32:21.080
like it's pretty it's not that complex at all. Code script. I think perhaps even more importantly

32:21.080 --> 32:26.120
and something I missed on the first few readings of his book early in my career was as far as I

32:26.200 --> 32:31.800
can tell it's the first mention that this code could be as simple as a binary code and he used

32:31.800 --> 32:37.400
the example of Morris code with just dots and dashes could be sufficient to give 34 different

32:37.400 --> 32:44.440
specifications. I've searched and I have not find any earlier references to the Morris code although

32:44.440 --> 32:50.920
historian that I know wrote a quick letter asking about that then and Chris response was

32:50.920 --> 32:53.800
it was a metaphor that was obvious to everybody. So I don't know if it was obvious to everybody

32:53.800 --> 32:59.240
after Schrodinger's book or sometime before. One of the things though Schrodinger was right

32:59.240 --> 33:03.320
about a lot of things which is why in fact I think we celebrate what he talked about and what he

33:03.320 --> 33:09.400
wrote about but some things he was clearly wrong about like most scientists in his time and he

33:09.400 --> 33:14.840
relied on the biologist of the day. They thought that protein not DNA was the genetic information

33:16.120 --> 33:21.720
and I think it's really quite extraordinary because just in 1944 in the same year that he

33:21.720 --> 33:27.400
published his book is when the famous experiment by Oswald Avery who was actually 65 and about

33:27.400 --> 33:32.360
ready to retire along with his colleagues Colin McCloud and McLean McCartney published their

33:32.360 --> 33:39.240
key paper demonstrating that DNA was actually the Colin McCloud of the clan McCloud is that the

33:39.240 --> 33:44.600
the immortal in Highlander one of the best movies of all time in case you haven't seen it Highlander

33:44.600 --> 33:48.360
great movie substance that causes bacterial transformation and therefore was the genetic

33:48.360 --> 33:55.080
material. His experiment was remarkably simple and I sort of wonder why it wasn't done 50 years

33:55.080 --> 33:59.240
earlier because with all the wonderful genetics work going on in Drosophila certainly people were

33:59.240 --> 34:03.640
looking at chromosomes. He simply used proteolytic enzymes to destroy all the proteins associated

34:03.640 --> 34:08.440
with the DNA and showed that the DNA the naked DNA was in fact of the transforming factor.

34:09.800 --> 34:15.560
The impact of this paper was far from instantaneous as has happened in this field I think in part

34:15.560 --> 34:20.920
because there was so much bias against DNA and towards proteins that it took a long time

34:20.920 --> 34:26.120
for that to sink. Now if you were paying attention there he's citing a paper that that tried to

34:26.120 --> 34:31.240
address the issue that I just said earlier which is if you just take that DNA and you don't have

34:31.240 --> 34:35.320
any chemical information about it you don't have any of the chaperone proteins or proteins or

34:35.320 --> 34:40.920
RNA that bound to it in in vivo then how do you know what you're really getting out of there and

34:41.080 --> 34:46.280
to a certain extent that experiment is valid in the sense of that the DNA transferred from

34:46.280 --> 34:53.960
one bacteria to another transferred those genes and those traits and so I'm totally willing to

34:53.960 --> 35:02.040
accept that some of these experiments are real and demonstrate that DNA is a genetic material that

35:02.040 --> 35:08.680
can carry a code that can be translated into proteins. I'm not suggesting that those kinds of broad

35:08.680 --> 35:15.320
ideas are incorrect. Please don't misunderstand me what I am suggesting though is that as they

35:15.320 --> 35:19.560
are described they are described in a very cartoonishly simple way

35:22.840 --> 35:28.680
and that cartoonishly simple thing involves DNA to RNA to protein with some ribosome in the middle.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.880
Not thinking about okay for example when we read RNA don't we isn't that basically this a very

35:40.760 --> 35:46.600
there are two steps there right understanding how those work in different tissues in different

35:46.600 --> 35:53.320
species with different ribosomes in different enzymes in different nucleic nuclear enzymes

35:53.320 --> 36:00.600
and nuclear chaperone proteins and and the variable list is endless and we're not talking

36:00.600 --> 36:04.920
about that variable list at all we're trying to ignore it we're doing as much reductionist

36:05.960 --> 36:11.160
discussion as we can about DNA here and reductionist experiments are important

36:13.160 --> 36:20.760
but not exhaustive and certainly not the experiments that are going to get across

36:20.760 --> 36:27.480
get us across the finish line of trying to crack this irreducible complexity. Ken in 1949

36:27.480 --> 36:33.960
obviously was the first sequencing of a protein by Fred Sanger and the protein was insulin and

36:33.960 --> 36:40.520
this work showed in fact that proteins consisted of linear amino acid codes so and he won the Nobel

36:40.520 --> 36:46.600
Prize in 1958 for that achievement and was very key in terms of leader understanding of the link

36:46.600 --> 36:51.560
between DNA and proteins but as you heard in the introduction obviously the discovery that

36:51.560 --> 36:59.080
changed the whole field and started us down to DNA root was the 1953 work by Watson and Crick

36:59.080 --> 37:03.560
with help from Maurice Wilkins and Roslyn Franklin showing that DNA was in fact a double helix

37:03.560 --> 37:08.760
and had a clear explanation of how it could be self-replicated. Again this was not as I

37:08.760 --> 37:14.440
understand instantly perceived as a breakthrough because the biochemists were still hanging on

37:14.440 --> 37:21.000
to genetic code but soon with a few more experiments from others the world changed

37:21.000 --> 37:25.640
pretty dramatically. I think the next big thing came from the work obviously of Carana and Marshall

37:25.640 --> 37:31.480
Nuremberg in 1961 where they worked out the triplet genetic codes of three letters of genetic

37:31.480 --> 37:37.080
code coding for a single amino acid and then this became clear how the linear DNA code encoded for

37:37.080 --> 37:42.520
the linear protein code. This was followed a few years later by Robert Holly's discovery of the

37:42.520 --> 37:48.440
structure of tRNA and tRNA is the key the key a link between the messenger RNA and bringing the

37:48.440 --> 37:54.840
amino acids in for protein synthesis though Holly Nuremberg and Carana shared the Nobel Prize in 1968

37:54.840 --> 37:59.320
for that work. The next decade brought us restriction enzymes so my friend and colleague Ham Smith

37:59.320 --> 38:04.360
who was at the Venture Institute now in 1970 that found the first restriction enzymes these are

38:04.360 --> 38:09.640
the molecular scissors that cut DNA very precisely and enabled the entire field of a molecular

38:09.640 --> 38:13.560
engineering and molecular biology and Ham Smith and Warner Arbor and Dan Nathan shared the prize

38:13.560 --> 38:19.240
in 1978 for that work. The 70s brought not only some interesting dress codes and characters

38:20.440 --> 38:25.720
but the beginning of the molecular splicing revolution using restriction enzymes Conan Boyer

38:25.720 --> 38:31.800
and Paul Berg published the first papers on recombinant DNA and Conan Boyer at Stanford

38:31.800 --> 38:36.520
as Stanford father patent on their work and this was used by Genentech and Eli Lilly to produce

38:36.520 --> 38:43.800
a human insulin as the first recombinant drug. DNA sequencing and reading the genetic code

38:43.800 --> 38:50.360
progressed much more slowly so in 1973 a maximum Gilbert published a paper on 24 base pairs 24

38:50.360 --> 38:56.920
letters of genetic code RNA sequencing progressed a little bit faster so the first actual genome

38:56.920 --> 39:03.000
viral genome an RNA viral genome was sequenced in 1976 by Walter Fier is it from Belgium and this

39:03.080 --> 39:08.280
was followed the following year by Fred Sanger again a sequence in the first DNA virus and this was

39:08.280 --> 39:15.640
phi X 174 that I'll bring back to mind with you so this became the first DNA virus in the first

39:15.640 --> 39:20.040
viral DNA genome and it was also accompanied by this new sequencing technique called now referring

39:20.040 --> 39:25.720
to a Sanger sequencing that Sanger introduced. This is a picture of Sanger's team that sequenced

39:25.720 --> 39:30.760
phi X the second guy from the left on the bottom is Clyde Hutchinson who was also a member of the

39:30.760 --> 39:36.120
Adventure Institute and joined us after retiring from the University of North Carolina and took

39:36.120 --> 39:41.960
played a key role in some of the synthetic genome work. So in 1975 I was just getting my Ph.D. as

39:41.960 --> 39:47.080
the first genes were being sequenced 20 years later I led the team to sequence the first genome

39:47.080 --> 39:52.040
of a living species and Cam Smith was a key part of that team this was homophilus influenza

39:52.040 --> 39:56.520
instead of 5000 letters of genetic code this was 1.8 million letters of genetic code

39:56.600 --> 40:02.600
or about 300 times the size of the phi X genome. Five years later we up the ante another 1,600

40:02.600 --> 40:07.800
times with the first draft of the human genome using these new whole genome shotgun techniques

40:07.800 --> 40:12.920
and the smaller papers the the public genome effort size doesn't reflect its significance

40:12.920 --> 40:17.720
only its relative significance to me. So the human genome is about a half a million times

40:17.720 --> 40:22.440
larger than the phi X genome so it shows how fast things were developing and reading genomes is

40:22.440 --> 40:27.320
now progressed extremely rapidly so instead of years or decades it now takes about two hours

40:27.320 --> 40:33.240
to sequence a human genome instead of genomes per day or genomes per hour or hours per genome

40:33.240 --> 40:37.320
we can now in a recently done a demonstration sequencing 2000 complete microbial genomes

40:37.320 --> 40:45.320
in one run in one hour so the pace is changing quite substantially. Now I view DNA as an analog

40:45.320 --> 40:50.120
coding molecule and when we sequence the DNA we're converting that analog code into digital code

40:50.840 --> 40:56.680
the ones and zeros in the computer very similar to the dots and dashes that Schrodinger

40:56.680 --> 41:00.280
indicated might be the original code and I call this process digitizing biology.

41:01.080 --> 41:06.520
A numerous scientists have drawn the analogy between computers and biology I take these even

41:06.520 --> 41:11.560
further I describe DNA as the software of life and when we activate a synthetic genome in a cell

41:11.560 --> 41:15.880
we call we describe it as booting up a genome in a cell the same way we talk about booting up

41:15.960 --> 41:20.280
software. Now June 23rd of this year was Alan Turing's would have been his hundredth birthday

41:21.080 --> 41:26.040
and Turing described what has become be known as Turing machines and the machine described a

41:26.040 --> 41:30.600
set of instructions written on a tape. He also described the universal Turing machine which was a

41:30.600 --> 41:37.240
machine that could take that set of instructions. I hope you can already feel how inadequate this is

41:38.040 --> 41:46.440
that our existence is really a machine that reads a tape. I hope you can understand how

41:46.440 --> 41:51.880
ridiculous it is that he is trying to convince this audience after years of failure that they

41:51.880 --> 41:58.520
are almost there to understanding the machine that reads the tape. Computers equal life,

41:58.600 --> 42:09.320
computers equal biology is one of the most absurd insults to God's creation one of the most absurd

42:09.320 --> 42:16.760
insults and it's a verbal abomination of the beauty of life. But that's what we're doing here

42:16.760 --> 42:22.040
right it's it's chemistry and physics which essentially means it's a bunch of zeros and ones

42:22.040 --> 42:27.640
it's a bunch of variables that if we had sufficient ability to measure them we could predict all of

42:27.720 --> 42:31.960
them. It essentially means we have no free will because we're just machines.

42:33.560 --> 42:36.040
The free will is an illusion. Do you see where this goes?

42:38.360 --> 42:46.120
This is from years ago this is one of the granddaddies of this mythology. This guy has been claiming

42:46.120 --> 42:53.240
that if we just had enough sequences like every baby on earth we would have a chance at figuring

42:53.240 --> 42:58.040
out how the genome works. This guy says that. This guy's got a foundation that has that as a goal.

42:59.000 --> 43:07.240
They charge you to sequence you and then they also use your sequence and sell it to pharmaceutical

43:07.240 --> 43:15.640
companies. That's his company. This is one of the darkest players in this mythology that understands

43:15.640 --> 43:23.160
that the value of the people on the planet right now is is there what they represent as data.

43:24.120 --> 43:29.800
And rewrite them and this was the original origin of the digital computer. His ideas were

43:29.800 --> 43:36.040
carried further in the 1940s by John Van Neumann as many people know and he conceived of the self

43:36.040 --> 43:41.000
replicating machine. So Von Neumann's machine consisted of a series of cells which encoded a

43:41.000 --> 43:45.320
sequence of actions that be performed by the machine and using a writing head the machine can print

43:45.320 --> 43:50.840
out a new pattern of cells allowing it to make a complete copy of itself on the tape. So many

43:50.920 --> 43:55.800
of people have certainly made the analogy most recently in nature Sydney Brenner who played a role

43:55.800 --> 44:01.640
in almost all these stages of early biology wrote an article about Turing and biology and in this

44:01.640 --> 44:06.600
he argued that the best examples of a Turing and von Neumann machine is found in biology with the

44:06.600 --> 44:13.400
self replicating code the internal description of itself and that this is the key kernel of

44:13.400 --> 44:18.840
biological theory. So while software was pouring out of sequencing machines around the world

44:18.840 --> 44:25.000
substantial progress was going on describing the hardware of life or proteins. So in biochemistry

44:25.000 --> 44:29.880
the first two decades of the 20th century were dominated by what was called the colloid theory.

44:29.880 --> 44:34.120
So life itself is explained in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances

44:34.120 --> 44:38.920
in an organism. We now know that these substances are a collection of three-dimensional protein

44:38.920 --> 44:45.320
machines each evolved to carry out a very specific task. Now these proteins have been

44:45.320 --> 44:50.840
described as nature robots and if you think about it for every single task in a cell every

44:50.840 --> 44:55.480
imaginable task is described by a Tanford and Reynolds there is a unique protein to carry out

44:55.480 --> 45:01.720
that task. It's programmed when to go on when to go off and it does this based on its structure

45:01.720 --> 45:07.160
it doesn't have consciousness it doesn't have a control from a mind or a higher center everything

45:07.160 --> 45:14.280
a protein does is built in to its linear code derived from the DNA code. Just so that's a pretty

45:14.360 --> 45:21.240
bold bold certainty there with no room for subtleties that I hope he's going to build in later.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.920
Briefly there's multiple protein types everything you know about your own life

45:24.920 --> 45:29.080
most of it is protein derived about a quarter of your body is collagen it's a matrix protein

45:29.080 --> 45:34.200
that's built up in multiple layers we have rubber-like proteins that form blood vessels in the lung

45:34.200 --> 45:39.160
we have transporters that move things in and out of cells enzymes that copy DNA metabolized sugars

45:39.160 --> 45:45.960
etc. Now the most important breakthrough I think outside of the genetic code is determining the

45:45.960 --> 45:50.520
process of protein synthesis. To show you how recent all of this is this is the three-dimensional

45:50.520 --> 45:58.360
structure of the bacterial ribosome determined in 2005 and the three angstrom structure of the

45:58.360 --> 46:01.880
eukaryotic chromosome was just determined and published in December of last year that this is

46:01.880 --> 46:08.120
all recent science in recent history and these are extraordinary molecules but that's a weird

46:08.120 --> 46:12.760
thing right I mean if we sequence the whole human genome already then why do we wait so long

46:12.760 --> 46:22.360
to sequence a bacterial ribosome what did he say exactly because it doesn't make sense we sequence

46:22.360 --> 46:29.640
the whole human genome two decades ago already this is this is the three-dimensional structure

46:29.640 --> 46:37.720
of the bacterial ribosome determined in 2005 and the three angstrom structure of the eukaryotic

46:37.880 --> 46:42.520
weird because 2005 was one of the first I think it's one of the first years where we started to

46:42.520 --> 46:48.760
actually get coronavirus sequences did you know that the first human coronavirus that was actually

46:48.760 --> 46:50.200
sequenced and understood

46:53.000 --> 46:57.960
around 2005-2006 what a weird time for all these narratives to start right

46:59.240 --> 47:04.920
all together so it was just determined and published in December of last year that this is all

47:04.920 --> 47:09.160
weir of the eukaryotic chromosome was just determined and published in December and the

47:09.160 --> 47:13.640
three angstrom structure of the eukaryotic chromosome was just determined and published in December of

47:13.640 --> 47:17.960
last year is that the bacteria chromosome then I don't know what he's talking about there but

47:17.960 --> 47:23.240
it seems really weird this is all recent science in recent history and these are extraordinary

47:23.240 --> 47:30.360
molecules there it's the most complex machinery we have in the cell as you can see

47:31.160 --> 47:36.920
there's numerous components to it I tried to think of this as maybe the Ferrari engine of the cell

47:38.040 --> 47:42.040
if the engine can't convert the enmester RNA tape into proteins there is no life

47:42.760 --> 47:47.000
and if you interfere with that process you kill life so major antibiotics that we all know about

47:47.000 --> 47:52.360
the immunoglycosides, ceterocycline, quorum phenylchol, erythromycin, etc all kill bacterial cells

47:52.360 --> 47:57.320
by interfering with the function of this structure how many people knew that how many

47:57.400 --> 48:05.800
people knew that a ribosome was composed mostly of RNA so ribo proteins ribonucleic proteins

48:06.520 --> 48:13.000
and that it had 47 different proteins subunits or whatever that come together to form it including

48:13.000 --> 48:19.400
the RNA molecules that are hybrid in there does that sound like something that we understand

48:22.040 --> 48:25.880
or does that sound like something that they desperately want to understand if they don't

48:25.960 --> 48:33.800
understand that machine then what do they really understand about DNA to RNA to protein not very

48:33.800 --> 48:42.360
much think back to the violin analogy from the last couple days if they can explain to you why

48:42.360 --> 48:48.200
a crack in the neck can be absolutely catastrophic for a strativarius violin do they understand anything

48:48.200 --> 48:53.960
about the varnish process or about how a perfect violin works or how a violinist produces the music

48:54.040 --> 49:01.560
on a violin they haven't even bothered to study it and so by sequencing the human genome using

49:01.560 --> 49:10.120
restriction enzyme maps they haven't even started actually studying it by sequencing or crystallizing

49:10.120 --> 49:18.280
the bacterial ribosome we're just getting started studying it in 2005 at the same time where

49:18.920 --> 49:24.600
we're just starting to study coronavirus biology and and and able to find them in the wild

49:26.040 --> 49:30.440
and now we're supposed to believe that this is basically subject matter that is mastered

49:31.640 --> 49:39.960
that we can feed mRNA into a child's body through the muscle and expect ribosomes in their tissue

49:40.520 --> 49:46.680
to faithfully translate the protein that we want them to translate and for their immune system

49:46.680 --> 49:54.040
to faithfully respond to it with a useful response that's the model of reality that these guys

49:54.040 --> 50:01.720
want us to accept right now that the that the original story line was written for and laid down

50:01.720 --> 50:11.080
by charlatans like this man who are telling the same mythology the same nonsense story about how

50:11.080 --> 50:18.920
eventually we're going to be able to do all this stuff

50:20.920 --> 50:25.800
so the ribosome is clearly the most unique and special structure in the cell it has seven major

50:25.800 --> 50:31.480
RNA chains including three messenger three tRNA chains and one messenger RNA it has 47 different

50:31.480 --> 50:36.760
proteins going into the structure in one newly synthesized protein chain the size is several

50:36.760 --> 50:40.920
million dolphins so this is the heart of all biology we would not have cells we would not have

50:40.920 --> 50:45.480
life without this working and this is the machine that converts the linear dna code

50:46.520 --> 50:52.200
into proteins and the process with doing this what did he just say i mean think about how he said it

50:52.200 --> 50:56.920
so from there's a several million dolphins so this is the heart of all biology we would not have

50:56.920 --> 51:02.360
cells we would not have life without this working this is the heart of biology they don't have a

51:02.360 --> 51:07.480
clue how it works they've been telling you for years the heart of biology is dna it's the tape

51:08.280 --> 51:13.880
the tape that goes into the machine it's not the tape that goes into the machine at all

51:17.400 --> 51:25.160
it's the machine or the machines they don't know how the dna copying machine works they don't know

51:25.160 --> 51:30.360
how the RNA polymerase works they don't know how reverse transcriptase works they don't know how

51:30.360 --> 51:35.640
a ribosome works they can tell you they know but they don't

51:41.480 --> 51:43.160
do you see what we're dealing with here

51:46.040 --> 51:48.200
they can talk out of both sides of their mouths

51:51.000 --> 51:56.600
these people know that they haven't made progress just like peter teal told you in that video in

51:57.160 --> 52:04.200
2019 they know that the progress is stalling out that yeah we can sequence things faster we can

52:04.200 --> 52:14.120
sequence more things in less time we can identify cracks in the neck of the violin faster we can

52:14.120 --> 52:19.240
find them easier we have technology to locate hairline cracks that we're hard to see before

52:19.960 --> 52:24.360
does that mean that we understand how the violin makes music no we don't

52:26.120 --> 52:34.200
no we don't and these kinds of observations are being misconstrued as understanding they're not

52:34.200 --> 52:44.600
understanding please see it this is the biology the big picture biology we need to teach to our kids

52:45.400 --> 52:49.400
we are being misled by a bunch of people who have been misled

52:51.160 --> 52:53.640
who are too naive or too smart to see out of it

52:59.880 --> 53:06.200
and this is the machine that converts the linear dna code into proteins and the process with doing

53:06.200 --> 53:11.640
this RNA synthesis from RNA is called transcription and protein synthesis is called translation

53:12.600 --> 53:17.160
so if these processes were highly reliable life would be very different and perhaps not need the

53:17.160 --> 53:21.160
same kind of information driven system if you were building a factory to build automobiles

53:21.160 --> 53:25.720
that worked the way the ribosome did you would be out of business very quickly a significant

53:25.720 --> 53:30.120
fraction of all the proteins synthesized get degraded shortly after synthesis because they

53:30.120 --> 53:34.920
formed the wrong confirmations they aggregate in the cell or cause another problem so as

53:34.920 --> 53:39.400
transfer RNA brings in the final amino acid to a growing peptide chain coming out of the ribosome

53:39.400 --> 53:43.080
the next step is truly one of the most remarkable and that's the protein folding

53:43.080 --> 53:48.360
so the number of protein confirmations if you have 100 amino acids is only a word of 2 to the 100th

53:48.360 --> 53:55.400
power 2 to the 100th power if you have 100 amino acids so tell me again how we understand that

53:55.400 --> 54:02.440
preons can cause other proteins to misfold how does that work exactly why do we believe that

54:02.440 --> 54:10.440
that seems like a good idea like that makes sense proteins that have countless configurations

54:10.440 --> 54:17.560
that are complex electrostatic magnets with three dimensional shapes inside of a polar solvent

54:17.560 --> 54:26.760
called water and yet somehow or another despite that absolutely irreducible complexity this old

54:26.760 --> 54:30.360
man is still trying to tell us that we basically have a grip on how all that works

54:32.120 --> 54:42.120
or is he or is he listen the next step is truly one of the most remarkable

54:42.120 --> 54:46.600
and that's the protein folding so one of the most remarkable that we still don't understand but

54:46.600 --> 54:53.080
google tells us we do it's too bad that google fold can't explain the simple mechanisms by which

54:53.160 --> 54:59.400
proteins go into prion states or go into amyloidosis and cause other proteins to do it

55:01.960 --> 55:07.240
if the way that a protein folds is dependent on its sequence then how can a prion protein

55:07.880 --> 55:12.200
influence another protein without the right sequence to fold into that protein

55:14.040 --> 55:18.520
how come we don't talk about any of this stuff in the prion literature we just talk about in very

55:18.520 --> 55:32.120
grand terms he's telling you that proteins misfold all the time that if you started a car

55:32.120 --> 55:38.840
manufacturing plant that made cars as well as a ribosome does that you'd go out of business

55:39.960 --> 55:46.200
think about how extraordinary what he's saying is that must mean that there's a lot of misfolded

55:46.280 --> 55:50.600
protein in every cell that we have that must mean that misfolded protein must be dealt with pretty

55:50.600 --> 55:56.680
effectively but how do they know that it's a misfolded protein after it gets translated from

55:56.680 --> 56:03.800
DNA to RNA to protein who's checking what what mechanism is checking to see if that protein has

56:03.800 --> 56:10.600
all the right amino acids do they line it up against a standard i thought these things were

56:10.600 --> 56:16.440
just molecules with no mind yet somehow or another you're just going to keep hand waving

56:16.440 --> 56:20.440
over and over this happens and then that happens and then this happens and then they do this and

56:20.440 --> 56:25.800
then they do this and the most amazing thing is despite all of these errors and terrible folding

56:25.800 --> 56:32.520
and and the last transfer RNA being wrong the body is able to get rid of those proteins very

56:32.520 --> 56:37.080
quickly if they're folded wrong or if they're translated wrong because there's all these magic

56:37.080 --> 56:49.000
mechanisms that do it he is trying to make you believe that protein misfolding is a very normal

56:49.000 --> 56:54.760
thing it happens all the time it's something we have to deal with and can be pathogenic if it goes

56:54.760 --> 57:05.880
wrong is it true that's the question you have to ask yourself is it a natural process or is it

57:05.880 --> 57:11.800
something that happens after a long exposure to a toxin repeated exposure to chronic inflammation

57:12.840 --> 57:17.800
other insults to the brain or tissues which go through this protein misfolding process

57:17.800 --> 57:27.000
electromagnetic radiation or other damaging sources of biodamaged nobody talks about any of

57:27.000 --> 57:33.480
that stuff here and the reason why is because they are oversimplifying your understanding of

57:33.480 --> 57:38.280
what is irreducible complexity in biology the number of protein confirmations if you have 100

57:38.280 --> 57:43.560
amino acids is on the order of two to the 100th power it would take about 10 to the 10th years

57:43.560 --> 57:49.080
that for you to even try all those if you can try one a second so wait i thought that google

57:49.080 --> 57:54.360
already has a algorithm that figured it all out and can do it for any protein do you see where we are

57:55.720 --> 58:02.840
did we figure that out in like 10 years just hardcore number crunching but built into this

58:02.920 --> 58:06.520
linear code of the amino acid based on the linear genetic code these processes

58:07.080 --> 58:12.840
happened very quickly so here's a movie that spreads out that six microseconds

58:13.400 --> 58:19.320
slightly longer to show you a folding of a small protein so this is the end folded structure

58:19.320 --> 58:24.040
so you'll see it starts with a linear protein and over six microseconds it goes through all

58:24.040 --> 58:29.880
these different confirmations to try and get to the final fold so somehow the linear code limits

58:29.880 --> 58:33.000
the number of folds it can take but it tries a number of different ones and if it gets them

58:33.000 --> 58:39.720
wrong the protein has to be degraded very quickly or it will cause problems so imagine all the

58:39.720 --> 58:43.880
selection that went into this because the protein structure actually determines its rate of folding

58:43.880 --> 58:50.040
as well as the final structure in fact the end terminal amino acid determines how fast a protein

58:50.040 --> 58:56.920
is degraded this is now called the the end rule pathway for protein degradation for example if

58:57.000 --> 59:01.640
you had a amino acid a lysine and arginine or tryptophane as an interminal on a protein beta

59:01.640 --> 59:07.400
galactosidase it results in a protein with a half-life of 120 seconds in E. coli or 180 seconds in

59:07.400 --> 59:11.080
eukaryotic cell yeast whereas you have three different amino acids a serine of valine or

59:11.080 --> 59:16.760
methionine you get a half-life of over 10 hours in bacteria over 30 hours in yeast but these are

59:16.760 --> 59:22.360
still relatively short times a bacteria will sell in an hour will have to remake half of all its

59:22.360 --> 59:29.720
proteins we make things at almost similar rate but because of this instability and the random

59:29.720 --> 59:34.920
folding and misfolding of proteins protein aggregation is a key problem so we have to constantly synthesize

59:34.920 --> 59:40.360
new proteins and if they fold wrong you have to get rid of them or they clog up the cell this I

59:40.360 --> 59:45.640
think it's absolutely extraordinary that he's spending so much time talking about protein

59:45.720 --> 59:47.720
misfolding I can't even believe it

59:50.600 --> 59:56.360
he is emphasizing this for like four minutes already that the ribosome isn't very good

59:56.360 --> 01:00:02.280
even though it's the most beautiful thing and it is it is the secret to life it's not very

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:08.680
good machine it makes errors all the time and this protein misfolding has to be is a source of

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:16.280
danger like what is he talking about here how can we replace our gut epithelial cells every

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:25.080
three to five days if protein misfolding in RNA and ribosomes is so shitty how the hell would that work

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.320
I'm sorry but I feel like what I see here is exactly what I thought I would see here

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.800
I'm going to find as we look back on these scientists talking about the human genome project talking

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.600
about sequencing talking about the idea of DNA to RNA to protein are going we're going to find

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.960
out that we missed it but they were emphasizing protein misfolding for a lot longer than we thought

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.960
and not because they have a plethora of evidence about how devastating this is or how important it

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.920
is to understand but because they knew it was going to increase in the future and they needed to be

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:13.720
sure that we had a naturally occurring mechanism cartoon in our head already when it started to

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:22.200
become more and more apparent more and more part of our daily lives Alzheimer's cannot be a toxin

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.840
or will be angry it cannot be poisoning or will be angry it cannot be something in the water

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.920
or will be angry it cannot be electromagnetic radiation or cell phone towers or anything or

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:40.120
we will be angry it has to be a natural thing that just happens to some old people when they get

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:50.280
unlucky or they use too many aluminum pans this guy is laying down a narrative of protein

01:01:50.280 --> 01:02:00.840
misfolding that is absolutely ridiculous because they have no absolutely none zero zip evidence

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:06.040
for how it is that if the ribosome is making so many mistakes how in the world do we compensate

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.400
for all that wasted energy all that was wasted raw materials that get assembled into something

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.000
that just needs to be broken down again how in the world can we take this seriously

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:28.600
when our endothelial cells are replaced weekly our epithelial cells in our gut are replaced

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:35.000
weekly how can we possibly take this guy seriously how much wasted energy is he actually describing

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:43.320
as part of the perfect symphony of life i hear mythology being laid here folks same way as if

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.920
you stop taking out the trash in a city and this is definitely not doubling everything comes to a

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.640
halt so cells work the same way you have to degrade the proteins you have to pump the trash

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:59.160
out of the cell it can be toxic very quickly there's a number of diseases known to most of you

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.880
that are misfolding or aggregation diseases and Alzheimer's disease and macao disease are

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:10.280
examples of accumulation of toxic protein aggregates but recently a new drug came out to deal with

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.120
cystic fibrosis and it's quite interesting people thought the mutations in cystic fibrosis

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.560
just yielded in a less functioning chloride ion channel that affected the cell's ability

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.440
to survive properly it turns out the single mutation that's the major mutation cystic fibrosis

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.240
actually blocks the protein from disassociating with its chaperonin and never gets to the cell

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.480
surface so simple changes a single letter change in the genetic code in this case doesn't allow

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:40.200
it to fold properly and get associated so lots of diseases are turning out to be problems from

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:47.240
protein folding but it's weird right so it doesn't fold properly but the RNA gets translated by the

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.120
ribosome and the system doesn't recognize it as being folded incorrectly so alchemy doesn't get

01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:00.760
degraded so there's mechanisms that he talks about then not talk about then ignores then says

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:08.200
are there then says aren't there the incongruencies come every other sentence because he's describing

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.800
something with certainty of which he has no actual certainty about and he knows it

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.280
and these incongruencies are there because the story of what they understand is incongruent

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:26.200
they don't understand it they're still shooting in the dark and pretending they got this all under

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.760
control so you and I don't ask any questions and so that the government keeps funding them

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:41.560
these are the exact charlatans that peter teal was warning us about where the hyper specialization

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:49.800
allows people to lie and to exaggerate the politicization of science allows people encourages people to

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:55.000
lie and exaggerate that's what you see here a man who's done it his whole career

01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:06.040
because he's been encouraged to do it by people like David Baltimore and Stanley Plotkin

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:18.280
and all the other people like Robert Gallo and Murray Gardner and everybody else who has

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:24.040
a vested interest in no one actually understanding the biology at the molecular level

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.080
so that the biosecurity state can have an imperative to control us forever

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.320
and more importantly so that they can invert the sovereignty that we feel over our own bodies

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.680
and that of our children so that guys like Craig Venter can finally have the genetic data that

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:47.720
they have already told us many decades ago they need that Mark Lander told us already a decade ago

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.480
that we would need without all the genomes we need all of them we're not going to have a chance

01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:00.680
of figuring this out that's what the human genome project's final answer was that they got to the

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.560
meeting they went to the the secret room in the Department of Energy and they said well we've

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:13.480
got the restriction enzyme maps but they are so a specific that we can barely even see patterns

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:19.640
between people that are closely related so I think the only choice for us is to have as many

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:26.280
genomes as possible we need all the sequences we need them all and so China being partnered

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:30.360
with that with that whole movement just said okay well we'll start collecting ours we're

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:38.520
going to do it right now meanwhile we with our inertia in our system still have this thing called

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:45.880
privacy and and all that other stuff and and so we couldn't convert we couldn't just start

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:52.040
collecting all the data from all our kids and so instead what we did was we had people like Craig

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:59.640
Venter and and people like like James Giordano and others brief secret meetings and tell people

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.400
that look China is already collecting all this data and they might even be collecting it on us

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.320
too and in the meantime we're not doing anything and at some point in time they're going to have

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.440
enough data to make very big progress in cracking the pattern integrity that is the genome and how

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:19.080
it's translated into people or animals or viruses or bacteria and so we don't do what they are doing

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:27.160
we will be behind forever and so their plan was well we'll create a pandemic and we'll

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:33.800
invert the sovereignty that people currently have in our system to permission we might have

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.200
to do it gradually over a couple executions of it but that's what we'll do and in the end we'll

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.760
collect the data that we need just like the Chinese are collecting the data that they need and that's

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:50.120
what people like Craig Venter say at the back rooms of TED Talks and at at food conferences after

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.400
the main audience leaves and they have meetings with the directors and the people that coordinate

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:01.320
these things that's what they talk about that's what Peter Thiel and his friends at the top of

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.640
these weaponized piles of money are talking about when they talk about us and how they're

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:11.240
going to use us we are data and if we're not going to give up our data and then you can die at 55

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:19.640
am I pessimistic yeah I kind of am because it's starting to become obvious to me that this has

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.680
been going on for a very very long time and I like everybody else was a victim of it since a child

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.480
based on this genetic code so I'm trying to leave you with a notion that life is a process of

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:37.880
dynamic renewal we're all shedding about 500 million uskin cells every day that dust that

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.000
accumulates in your home that that's you so you shed your entire outer layer skin every two to

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.960
four weeks you have five times 10 to the 11 blood cells that die every day if you're not

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:53.400
constantly synthesizing new cells you're in trouble and can you see how easy it would be to get rid

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:59.400
of virally replicating cells that we're replicating a an RNA they weren't supposed to replicate if

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.880
that's what happens in a viral infection do you see how easy it would be if there's such high turnover

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:11.080
at these barriers give me a break ladies and gentlemen well and this surprised me the most

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:16.280
I'm looking at this about half of all our cells die during normal organ development so everything

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.680
is constantly turning over and changing looking at cancer cells the half-life of human proteins

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.960
was between 45 minutes think about all this turnover of proteins and of cells and of tissues but

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.400
all this extremely erroneous protein production that he just described five minutes ago

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.240
it just doesn't all jive together it doesn't make sense unless he's trying to lay down

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:45.480
a narrative about how protein misfolding can be caused catastrophic disease states unless he's

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:52.680
actually trying to convince people of this extremely rare possibility there's no reason for

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:00.680
him to talk about the extreme infidelity of of RNA translation by ribosomes and pretend that

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:06.440
there that so many errors in folding are made that that you know we get one out of every what four

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.080
proteins are good then or what what's his what's the ratio there because the way that he talks about

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:17.160
it it sounds like it's a really crappy thing as he said if you built a car factory out of ribosomes

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.720
you'd go out of business because they don't make cars very well what in the world is he talking

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.240
about then if we have such high turnover how do we succeed in getting all that height millions of

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.400
cells are being produced with perfect proteins apparently and despite that they're also making

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.280
on top of that a bunch of shitty proteins that waste all that energy waste all that ribosomal

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:46.680
uh uh sort of translation time and also waste all that degradation machinery think about how many

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.440
proteins that we eat digest into amino acids and then reassemble into garbage that we then

01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:01.320
have to digest again according to this guy it's spectacular that's in 22 hours if you take the

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:07.240
DNA out of the cells the cells die uh so this is a key part of things that we were looking into

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.040
going forward now as you know all life is cellular and the cellular theory is that you can only get

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.400
life from pre-existing cells and people attributed all kinds of special parameters to these cells

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.560
over time this is what an artist version view of what a cell cytoplasm might be it's actually

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.800
quite a crowded place it's relatively viscous it's not this empty bag with a few proteins

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.840
floating around in it and it's a very unique environment so you know why isn't he talking

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.440
about the aspect that it's in water and at that scale water is a polar solvent with his

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:47.880
definite shape and so with a simple computer model you can you can show that water can arrange

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:55.720
very well in a compact matrix where the positive and negative dipoles of the of the molecules are

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:02.040
lined up in a pattern that's almost a crystal lattice and thinking about how proteins behave

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:08.200
inside of that highly organized water lattice is crucial to understanding how these things

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.200
would come together in this three-dimensional space that is the cytoplasm of the cell instead

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:19.400
he's talking about the proteins without the context in which they are found he's talking

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.040
about the proteins without talking about how they are actually electrostatic three-dimensional

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:31.960
shapes that at those size scales have great forces of repulsion great forces of hydrophobicity

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:45.880
and what's the opposite of hydrophobicity hydrophilic behavior so we really need to understand how

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:53.400
many of these really almost infinite variables are being edited out of this reductionist model

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.520
of the cell your cytoplasm when he says a pretty crowded place with lots of proteins and stuff

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:04.360
that are all floating around in a very highly organized polar solvent of water

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:11.320
which is again what Luke Montagnier was working on as he died when he passed away he was working

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:22.120
on what happens when water is occupied by biomolecules is it possible that biological molecules

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.240
have a property where they cause the water around them to organize now i want you to think about this

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.920
because this is again one of those things where the real data and the real ideas have been put

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.720
out there and just you've been distracted by people who have said that you can freeze water and capture

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.120
the emotion in it like in a picture of a wedding ring or some nonsense like that those kinds of

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:53.160
water memory bullshit stories are out there because Luke Montagnier was onto something

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.640
onto something that physicists and chemists have known about for a long time

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.360
has something to do with the the surface tension of water and what happens

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.720
at this where water becomes at a surface but it's how the water molecules are able to organize

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.840
relative to one another and change their properties the way that that you can move through them

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:19.880
and Luke Montagnier was onto the idea that if you had a DNA molecule and a DNA molecule could have

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:29.400
the propensity to organize the water molecules around it you can imagine a scenario where a

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:37.000
a DNA molecule could cause a crystal lattice to form around it in the polar solvent of water

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.800
and because of the way that water organizes itself that that shadow in the water could be more than

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.080
spun it could exist for longer than the molecules present

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.520
and curiously in my humble opinion this would have to play a crucial role in any pathogenic

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:11.480
infectiousness of a prion protein because in between each protein is going to be a water layer

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.480
or layers and so in order to understand how a prion protein can cause a non-prion protein to

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:25.240
become a prion protein we need to understand how these two electrostatic shapes complex shapes

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.520
can come together in the polar solvent of water and then produce essentially the same structure

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:40.760
function that's the model that we have been given that's the model that we're we're we're

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.440
going to try to understand over the coming days and weeks and when we do as we approach that

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.840
model and we see how people have have tested and tried to verify you're going to find that nobody

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.040
nobody did anything that everybody just keeps making the assumptions that this guy's making

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.480
which is that ribosomes make a lot of errors and that sometimes those errors are catastrophic I guess

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.080
but if you listen to Craig describe and it sure seems like there should be a lot more

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:15.720
misfolded proteins than than we seem to be aware of and we sure waste a lot of energy on it then

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.440
the proteins are actually in solid phase now a key tentative chemistry that's developed

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:26.840
is the notion of synthesis as proof this perhaps dates back to 1828 when Francis Waller first

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.880
synthesized urea now this is herald is the end of vitalism because the thought that you could

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:38.440
only get organic molecules from living entities and so a great amount of attention was given to this

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.160
but now there's tens of thousands of papers published that either have proof by synthesis as

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.600
the starting point or key point of the title we decided to take the same approach of dealing

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:53.880
with DNA and dealing with life back in 1995 when we sequenced the first genome we actually did a

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:58.840
second one that year looking for the cell with a smallest genome and we chose microplasmid genitalium

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.440
it has 482 protein coding genes and 43 RNA genes we ask simple questions how many of these genes

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.760
are essential for life but what's the smallest number of cells needed for a cellular machinery

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:15.160
and ultimately to answer these questions could we design and construct a minimal DNA genome

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.920
of the cell as soon as we went down that route we had new questions would chemistry even allow us

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.160
to synthesize a bacterial chromosome and if we could would we just have a large piece of DNA

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.200
or could we actually boot it up on the cell like a new chemical piece of software we decided to

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:34.440
start where DNA history started with phi X 174 we chose it as a test synthesis i still think that

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.760
he is again casting an enchantment here what he uses that you know see if we can boot it up

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.440
if you had a machine

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:52.760
that could take a book

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.920
and turn it into a movie

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:04.760
just coming up with an analogy off the cuff here if you had a had a machine that could turn a book

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:15.560
into a movie and i told you that the words were turned into images and sometimes those images

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.040
come out wrong but most of the time they come out right

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:26.280
and i can make a copy of the book and i can put it into the machine and it will make the same

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:33.240
movie that i copied the book that i copied would make do we understand the machine

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.280
because i believe that's the kind of bamboozlement that's happening here we're being made to believe

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:53.320
that we have a machine that can take a book that's the tape right this is a Turing machine

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.800
it can take a tape and it can read the tape and it can make a copy of itself

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:09.480
and so if we copy the tape and put the tape through in the machine do we understand how the

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:15.000
machine works then the answer is no no matter how many ways we make a copy of the tape

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.200
or a partial copy of the tape or we put the tape in a different machine and it still works

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:26.040
we still don't understand how the machine works and the machine is life it's a big

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:31.000
ship in a bottle variable that we keep calling it nothing because we can't penetrate it

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.440
we can ting the bottle at all different sides and stuff like that but we can't explain how that

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.640
ship got assembled in there how it was done or who did it and why

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:51.880
and so make no mistake about it he's not describing a fidelity of understanding he's

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:58.200
actually describing a lack of understanding a horrible lack of understanding this because

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:03.880
you can make very few changes on the genetic code of phi x without destroying viral particles

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.880
so Clyde Hutchinson who helped sequence phi x ham smith and i developed a series of new techniques

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.280
to correct the errors that take place when you synthesize DNA but the machines that make DNA

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.880
are not very accurate and the longer the piece of DNA you make the more errors so we had to find

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.680
ways to correct errors we corrected the errors and had this 5 000 letter piece of DNA we injected

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:25.320
into e coli and this is the actual photo of what happened the e coli recognized this synthetic

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.720
piece of DNA as normal DNA and the proteins being robots to started reading this piece of genetic

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.560
code because that's what their program to do they made what the DNA told them to do is to make viral

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.640
proteins the virus self-assembled and it showed us gratitude by killing the cells which is how

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.600
we defective we get these clear spots on the cell so the virus self-assembled is another one of

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.680
those very large mythologies that completely discounts the possibility like i've said before

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:55.400
and i'm going to say it again you can't make a cuckoo clock make toast you cannot hijack the

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:03.240
machinery of a cell and make it do something that it already doesn't do so cells already produce

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:14.200
exosomes which are are lipoprotein coated vesicles that have receptor agonists on the outside or

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.200
targeting proteins on the outside and they have a genetic signal on the inside

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.640
and i believe that all tissues likely communicate this way signal to the immune system this way

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:31.400
and communicate their state of homeostasis with the rest of the body in this way and if there are

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:37.160
RNAs which are capable of hijacking this machinery they don't hijack this machinery to make

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:44.840
the cells do something they don't already do they make the cells produce exosomes that contain their

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:57.080
sequence and so he is explaining something again laying down a mythology that precludes any other

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:03.320
interpretation of their limited data set a virus is replicating because and making copies

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:09.240
of itself and hijacking the bacterial machinery because we put the DNA in there and then stuff came

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:16.600
out that couldn't be a natural process that's already there all the time that your that your

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:23.960
experimental transfection is harnessing it couldn't possibly be that it has to be evidence of pathogens

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:32.120
and evidence of the fidelity of these RNA pathogens that's that it's it's another illusion it's

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:38.040
crazy how succinctly it's being done so we call this a situation where the software is building

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.520
its own hardware all we did was put a piece of DNA software in the cell and we got out a protein

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:49.800
virus with a nucleic acid a core you could call it was not to make viruses you could call it an

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:54.360
exosome but if they called it an exosome then they would let you know that it's a natural process

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.240
that it's a process that already exists inside of the cell so it's not surprising

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:05.560
that we can put a transfection in a cell and that a cell will produce

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.600
vesicles that contain the contents of that production it's not unusual because it happens

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.360
this we wanted to make something substantially larger we wanted to make an entire chromosome

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.600
of a living cell but we thought if we could make viral size chromosomes accurately maybe we could

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.520
make a hundred or so of those and find a way to put those together so that's what we did we sent

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:30.120
out set out to sequence these pieces that we made these small pieces we sequenced them verify them

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:35.000
and put them together and it looks like a soccer or basketball playoff so we put four pieces together

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.320
and we had pieces now that were 24,000 letters long we would draw these up sequence them in

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.400
assemble those together to get pieces that were 72,000 we would do this again it was very

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.960
what in the hell are you hearing here except for the assembly of recombinant clones

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.000
i thought that that Ralph Barrick invented the no-seum technique where you use restriction enzymes

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:04.360
to stitch things together oh no he didn't invent that oh i see craig venter says craig venter says

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:10.600
that we had restriction enzymes back before 1973 and that we were making recombinant DNA clones

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:16.680
back in the 70s isn't that strange because i thought i was told by all these people in the

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:22.200
magic show that it was Ralph Barrick's no-seum technique and the things that he shared with the

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:29.000
with the Chinese that was so scary are you telling me that we've had restriction enzymes and been able

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.400
to make and assemble clones just like he recited already since the 70s and 80s wow what does that

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:45.080
mean for Ralph Barrick as a bad guy i guess he's not really a bad guy anymore

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.400
can you see this the guy Kevin McCurnan trying to tell me that i didn't have anything to stand

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:59.000
on i didn't know what i was talking about kevin McCurnan knows this history he was working for

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.600
the department of energy and mit and the whitehead institute in this very project he knows the

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:13.320
limitations of those restriction enzyme maps he knows that they need countless more human

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.880
genomes to have any clue about what actually is working and how these are organized

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.320
as kevin McCurnan ever said that it actually all comes down to understanding the ribosome

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.000
i'm going to play that back because this is really important pieces we sequence them verify

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.120
and put them together and it looks like a soccer or a basketball playoff so we put four pieces

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.760
together and we had pieces now that were 24,000 letters long we would draw the 24,000 letters

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:53.240
long the coronavirus genome is 30,000 bases at most you need to freaking hear this you need to

01:25:53.240 --> 01:26:00.680
hear it right now this molecular biology was not invented by Ralph Barrick this molecular

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.760
biology was not invented by Ralph Barrick no matter how many people insist it was

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:12.680
i have been saying it since bobby asked me to figure it out in 2022 that they were telling a

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.120
story about Ralph Barrick inventing this stuff because these are old school techniques that go

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:24.440
back to the very basics of molecular biology back before 1973

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:32.280
we are being misled ladies and gentlemen we are knee deep in it

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.480
leaves up sequence them and assemble those together to get pieces that were 72,000

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.120
we would do this again it's very laborious let's talk about a year and a half to do

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:51.560
and we got pieces 144,000 letters in length this was 144,000 base pairs in length

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.480
don't tell me for one second that we couldn't have made this don't tell me for one second

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.280
that we couldn't made enough of it to put all over the place so that the pcr's would be positive

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.440
and the sequencing reactions would be exactly what we wanted them to be so that all molecular

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:18.040
biology could be distorted into this very obvious planted phylogenetic tree where nobody pays

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.080
attention to anything they paid attention to in 2020 like fear and cleavage sites or hiv inserts

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.520
or staphylococcan and tangerine toxin B homologies none of those things that were

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:33.480
screamed about in 2020 were tracked at all despite the fact that we can sequence it 15

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.920
million times in four years

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:44.600
and we're supposed to believe that eco-health alliance a guy like like Peter Dasek and a guy

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.120
like like Ralph Barrick are responsible for what just happened here instead of the weaponized

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:57.320
piles of money that are currently trying to permanently have a hold on our our habits

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:07.880
and and our our intuition about reality decades of lying ladies and gentlemen decades of lying

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.440
about protein misfolding decades of lying about about DNA to RNA to protein decades of lying about

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.600
how we understand it decades of lying about how close we are to understanding all these

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.640
nano machines including the most beautiful important one key to all life on earth target of antibiotics

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.920
the ribosome beyond the largest piece that ever been synthesized to 30,000 letters

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.840
and at this time E. coli didn't like these large pieces of synthetic DNA in them so we

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:44.520
switched to yeast I found out last night this is a city that loves beer that comes from this

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:50.440
same brewer's yeast a beer and bread but aside from fermentation this little cell has remarkable

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.400
properties of assembling DNA so all we had to do was put the four synthetic quarter molecules into

01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.520
yeast with a small synthetic yeast centromere and yeast automatically assembled these pieces

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:05.480
together so that gave us the first synthetic bacterial chromosome and this is what we published

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:12.280
in 2008 this was the largest chemical structure of a defined a structure ever assembled we continued

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.760
to work on DNA synthesis and a somebody started out a young postdoc Dan Gibson came up with a

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:22.680
substantial breakthrough instead of the hours the days to years he found out that by putting

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.160
three enzymes together with all the DNA fragments in one pot at 50 degrees centigrade for a little

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:33.080
while it would automatically assemble these pieces so it went from a year or so down to an hour

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.520
and there's a breakthrough for a number of reasons most importantly it allows us now to

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.240
automate these processes so having a simple one step method allows us to go from the digital

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.280
code in the computer to the analog code of DNA in a robotic fashion see it's weird that he's not

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:51.160
mentioning Ralph Barrick with all these technologies I really thought that he was responsible for like

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:56.520
half of all the molecular biology techniques that were used in the world but it turns out

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:01.400
that what he did was take proven molecular biology techniques that were developed in the

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.840
70s 80s and 90s and applied them to coronaviruses that were really only discovered and became

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:21.240
tractable in 2006 and 7 and 8 the pandemic narrative is is falling apart like wet tissue paper

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.600
and this is being scaled up substantially we proved this initially by in just one step

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.560
synthesizing the mouse mitochondria genome so I had two teams working one on the chemistry

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.320
and one on the biology and it turns out the biology ended up being more difficult than the chemistry

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.880
so how do you boot up a synthetic chromosome in a cell this took us a substantial time

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:43.960
at the workout and this paper that we published in 2007 I think is one of the most important

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.840
for understanding how cells work and what the future of this field brings so this is where we

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.480
describe genome transplantation in simply by changing the genetic code the chromosome in one

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:59.160
cell swapping it out for another we converted one species into another because it's so important

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.600
to the theme of what we're doing I'm going to walk you through this a little bit and by the way

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:06.680
these are two of the scientists that led this at Carol Luckteague was the one with a breakthrough

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.200
John Glass and there was a large team working with them so we initially did this by isolating

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:18.600
the chromosome from a cell called in my coides and chromosomes are enshrouded with proteins

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.880
which is why there was confusion for so many years whether proteins are DNA with the genetic

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.560
material we simply did what Avery did we treated the DNA with the proteolytic enzymes removing all

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:31.800
the proteins because if we're making a synthetic chromosome we need to know can naked DNA work

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.320
on its own or there are going to be some special proteins needed for transplantation

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:38.680
we added a couple of cassettes to it one so we could select for it and another so it turns

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:44.520
cells bright blue if it got activated and we found a way to get these genome into a recipient cell

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.080
a cell m cap or colon which is about the same distance apart genetically from my coides as we are

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.160
from mice so relatively close on the order 10 percent are more different

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.240
but let me show you what happened we have this very sophisticated movie

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:02.120
so we inserted the n-microious chromosome into the recipient cell and just as with the phiaxis

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:06.920
soon as we put this DNA into the cell the protein robots started producing mRNA started producing

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.240
proteins some of the early proteins were the restriction enzymes that ham smith discovered

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:16.360
in 1970 they recognized the initial chromosome in the cell as foreign DNA and shoot it up

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.360
so now we have the body and all the proteins in one species and the genetic software of another

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:27.160
so what happened in a very short period of time we had these bright blue cells when we

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.880
interrogated the cells they had only the transplanted genome but more importantly when we sequenced

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.440
the proteins in these cells there wasn't a single protein or other molecule from the original

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:42.200
species every protein in the cell came from the new DNA that we inserted into the cell life

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.400
is based on DNA software we're a DNA now did you listen because I didn't hear that the cells divided

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:55.720
what I heard was that he transfected the cells the DNA was translated there were enzymes that

01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:03.800
were present that degraded the other genome and by the time it had transfected the whole dish

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:10.760
then they had blue cells that were not expressing their own proteins but the ones that they were

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:16.360
transfected with that's not that I'm sorry but I'll look up the paper later but that's not

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:22.760
artificial life that's not reprogramming a cell that's just transfection or transformation

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:32.280
of a of a bacteria and again I'm arguing that I think Craig Venter like Peter Thiel suggested

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:38.040
has a vested interest in lying and exaggerating about the significance of these these experiments

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:43.400
with the idea of making sure that he stays an expert in his hyper specialized field that he

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.440
keeps getting all of the the funding and that nobody questions his actual progress and the

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.400
significance of it and nobody will right because these people all need us to believe that it's

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.920
just a matter of time you might as well go limp where we are about to to solve all of these problems

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.080
a software system you change the DNA software you change the species it's a remarkably simple

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.520
concept remarkably complex in its execution now we had a problem that some of you may have

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:17.080
picked up on or have read about we were assembling the bacterial chromosome in a eukaryotic cell

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:21.320
so we're going to take the synthetic genome and do the transplantations we had to find a way to

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.880
get the genome out of yeast that transplanted back into a bacteria and we developed a whole new way

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.280
just to grow bacterial chromosomes in yeast as eukaryotic chromosomes and it was remarkably

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:35.400
simple in the end all we do is add a very small synthetic centromere from yeast to the bacterial

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.600
chromosome and all of a sudden it turns into a eukaryotic chromosome the centromere is when

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.360
you look at pictures of chromosomes it's that little piece in the middle of the y for example

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.680
so now we can stably grow bacterial chromosomes in yeast so we had the situation where we had

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.040
the emicoidy's chromosome in the eukaryotic cell we could try isolating it and doing the

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:55.000
transplantation the trouble is it didn't work and this little problem took us two and a half years

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.480
to solve of why it didn't work and it turns out when we initially did the transplantations taking

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.520
the chromosome out of the emicoidy cell that DNA had been methylated and that's how cells

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:11.640
protect their own DNA from interloping species so we proved this by isolating the six methylases

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.720
and methylating the DNA when we took it out of yeast if we methylated the DNA we could then do

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:21.080
the transplantation we proved this ultimately by in the recipient cell removing the restriction

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.640
enzymes and in that case we can just put a naked unmetallated DNA because there's nothing to

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.120
destroy the DNA in the cell so we're at this point now where we thought we had solved all the problems

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.240
we could create these new bacterial strains from the bacterial genomes cloned in yeast

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.280
and we had this nice cycle we could work our way around the circle we could add a center

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.840
mirror to the bacterial chromosome and turn it into a eukaryotic chromosome the advantages for

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.440
those of you who work with bacteria most bacteria do not have genetic systems which is why most

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.520
scientists don't work with them as soon as you put that bacterial genome in yeast we have the

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.680
complete repertoire of genetic tools in yeast such as homologous recombination so we can make

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.160
rapid changes in the genome isolate the chromosome methylated if necessary and do a transplantation

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.280
to create a highly modified cell so at this stage we decided to synthesize the mycoides genome

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.800
with all these new synthesis techniques Dan Gibson took this on almost single-handedly

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.240
if 1.1 million base pairs we started with pieces that were 1,000 letters long we put 10 of those

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.680
together to make pieces that were 10,000 letters long we put 10 of those together to make pieces

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:22.040
now that are 100,000 letters long and we had these 11 100,000 base pair pieces we put them in yeast

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.600
yeast assembled the DNA we knew how to transplant it out of yeast we did the transplantation and it

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.720
didn't work so those of you are software engineers that software engineers have debugging software

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.560
to tell them where the problem is in their code so we had to develop the biological version of

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.720
debugging software which was basically substituting natural pieces of DNA for the synthetic ones

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.280
until we could find out what was wrong we found out we could have 10 of the 11 synthetic pieces

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.480
and the last piece I had to be native DNA to get a living cell now what I do think Robert

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.040
Ralph Barrick did contribute is what he's talking about now which is idea of coming up with the

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:05.560
minimum coronavirus genome to get exosomes to be produced and so Ralph Barrick used very

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:12.200
standard restriction enzyme ligation techniques to create synthetic DNA versions of RNA viruses

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.440
but more importantly because the RNA virology that they had at that time was very sketchy and

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:24.120
only could find the RNA to pet an RNA polymerase or this protein or that protein but not the whole

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:31.560
genome one of the contributions that Ralph Barrick made was that here are the

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.800
minimum number of proteins that you need and so if you find a spike protein in the wild that you

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:43.800
want to test you can add that spike protein to all of these now why is that important ladies and

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:50.600
gentlemen please let's go back to the frontier why is that important because in a viral replicating

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:57.560
cell according to their cartoon by far and away the most abundant RNA present is the spike protein

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:04.120
by several orders of magnitude perhaps hundreds of thousands of more spike protein sub genomic

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:13.320
RNAs than any other transcript including the end protein and definitely including the probably

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:23.160
protein of 1a1 or rf1a in other words if you were to do a PCR test in a bat and you were looking for

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:29.160
novel coronaviruses their strategy was to look for the most conserved gene which was the RNA

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:35.160
dependent RNA polymerase and the most abundant one which was the spike protein and they look

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.360
for a conserved region of the spike protein because as you know spike proteins are highly

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.480
homologous because they have this conformational change that allows membranes to come together

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:53.160
we use a very similar protein in our in our developing embryo yada yada yada so our immune

01:38:53.160 --> 01:39:00.920
system looks for that commonality that conserved hydrophobic damage associated molecular pattern

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:08.280
and so my point is is that they looked for those two signals if they found them then Ralph Barrick

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.720
had a whole set of genes that you could just put in with that spike protein and now you could make

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:23.640
a synthetic clone of a purported novel coronavirus if you just found the sub genomic RNA of the

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.120
spike protein that's how it was done from 2005 until very very recently ladies and gentlemen

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.680
exactly as he's describing it where you come up with a minimum set of genes

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:42.280
and by substituting natural ones in until it grows or until it works you can eliminate

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.800
the genes you don't need find the genes that you do need and now you have a minimum set

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:54.680
and that's what Ralph Barrick did he didn't invent no serum technologies what he did

01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:01.880
was identified the minimum set of genes that would be necessary for an RNA to cause reproduction

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:08.680
of itself and packaging into exosomes not something that the cell doesn't normally do not hijacking

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.680
the cell and reprogramming it to make viruses for the first time in its existence but to hijack

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:21.080
the already existing exosomal production machinery to reproduce package and send out the RNA

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.680
and I think that Ralph Barrick and these coronavirus people found the minimum set of genes proteins

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.880
it's necessary to get that phenomenon to happen and they are telling you that that's a pathogen

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.200
that does it when in reality they are hijacking the synthetic machinery of a cell to try and

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:48.120
understand how the hell it works absolutely no different than the illusion created by this

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:53.640
guy claiming to try to create synthetic life I really think we're on to this

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.040
re-sequenced it and found one letter wrong and an essential gene made the difference between life

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:02.200
and no life so it was in the DNA gene which is important for starting the whole process of binding

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:08.360
to DNA we corrected that error so one out of 1.1 million we corrected that error and we got the first

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:14.520
actual synthetic cell from the genome transplants one of the ways that we knew this was a synthetic

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:20.360
cell we watermarked the DNA so we could always tell our synthetic species from any naturally occurring

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:26.840
one this was reported in early 2010 and science published it shortly thereafter

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.880
the watermarks we watermarked the first genome that we did just using the single letter amino acid

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:37.240
code and we were accused of not having much of an imagination so for this new genome we went a

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:42.120
little bit further and I added three quotations from the literature but first we developed a

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.560
whole new code where we could write the english language complete with numbers and punctuation

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.560
in DNA code and it's quite interesting we set the paper to science for review and one of the

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.080
reviewers sent back the review written in DNA code much to the frustration of the

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.720
science editor who could not do separate but the reviewers DNA code was based on the ASCII code

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.080
and with biology that creates a problem because you can get long stretches without a stock code

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.920
on so we developed this new code that puts in very frequent stock code ons because the last thing

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.440
you want to do is put in a quote from James Joyce and have it turn into a new toxin that kills

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.640
the cell or kills you you didn't know poetry could do that I guess so we built in the names of the

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.520
46 scientists that contributed to this and also there was a message with a URL so being the first

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:25.880
species to have a computer as a parent we thought it was appropriate it should have its own web

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.120
address built into the genome and as people solve this code they would send an email to the web

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:36.840
address written in the genome and once numerous people solved it we made this available and let

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:40.680
me just I know what this is hard to read the three quotes are the first one and probably the most

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.400
important one to Ireland is James Joyce the live to air to fall the triumph to recreate life out

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.280
of life somehow that seemed highly appropriate the second is from Oppenheimer's biography American

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.080
Prometheus see things not as they are but as they might be in the third from Richard Fineman what

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:01.640
I cannot build I cannot understand everybody thought it was very cool until a few months after this

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:08.200
appeared we got a letter from James Joyce estate attorney saying did you seek permission to use

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:13.960
this quotation and in the US at least there's fair use laws allow you to quote up to a paragraph

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.440
without seeking permission so we sort of dismissed that one then James Joyce was dead we didn't know

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.080
how to ask him anyway and then we started getting an email trail from a Caltech scientist saying

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.840
we'd misquoted Richard Fineman but if you look on the internet this is the quotation that you find

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.080
everywhere and we argued back this is what we found and this was what was in his biography

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.840
instead of proof his point he sent a picture of Fineman's blackboard with the original quotation

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:42.520
and what it was what I cannot create I do not understand what I cannot create I do not understand

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:51.720
and so rather than that being a a sort of a cardinal teaching of sacred biology which it should be

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.880
you can't create it so you don't understand it we can try

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:05.640
but what he's arguing of course is is that because he claims to have created it he understands it

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:12.360
that's what he's arguing here that's the arrogance that he's putting out here in a very

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:19.720
indirect way it is ugly it is an ugly arrogance make sure you see it

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.200
I think it's actually a much better quotation and we've gone back to correct the DNA code

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:33.080
so that Fineman can rest much more peacefully so we can actually go much further now there's

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.840
an exciting paper that includes out of Stanford that includes John Glass from my institute using

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.240
our work on the micro plasma cell to do the first complete mathematical modeling of a cell

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.920
now I was going to show you the movie of their mathematical model but it has so many different

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.280
components it would take about 20 minutes to show but this is coming out in cell I think

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.520
next week it is going to be an exciting change so we can go from the digital code to the genetic

01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:00.360
code and now modeling the entire function of the cell in a computer going to complete a digital

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:05.160
circle we're going further now we're using computer software to design new DNA software

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:12.120
to create a new cells and this is an important part of what I'll be talking about on a Saturday

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.480
evening now in conclusion I hope it's starting to become clear if it wasn't already that all

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:24.280
living cells that we know of on this planet are DNA driven DNA software driven biological machines

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:29.480
comprised of hundreds to thousands of proteins and these are protein robots coded for by the DNA

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.400
these protein robots carry out these very precise functions and developed by billions of years of

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.240
evolution you make a change in the DNA code it makes a change in the protein code that can

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.280
affect whether the protein is functional or not it can affect whether the cell lives or not

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:48.520
billions of years of evolution that he's not at all concerned about screwing up billions of

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:54.040
years of evolution that he's not at all worried about his lack of understanding of to go ahead

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:59.320
and start thinking that everything is a nail it can affect the rate that the protein folds how

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.200
fast it is degraded this is all programming built into life that controls the three-dimensional

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:11.160
structure so this is dynamic regulation and explains most of what Darwin described as Darwinian

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.440
evolution by making a copy of the DNA software the cell can self-replicate making another copy

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.800
of itself as Schrodinger described all these processes require energy and from all the genome

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:26.920
two sequences a range of mechanisms that cell cells can provide energy as you know if we eat

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.400
sugar that's one way to do it and with simple metabolism it's been well worked out pathways for

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.960
decades how we extract the energy contained in the sugar molecule converting it into cellular

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.040
energy that can drive all these different processes in 1996 we sequenced the genome of

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.120
methanococcus genacia the first archaea and the first autotrof that means it makes everything

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:49.080
from life from inorganic substances and it makes its energy by converting co2 into nothing it also

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:54.280
uses the carbon and co2 to make all its proteins in lipids all these processes are coded for in

01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:00.280
the DNA we've shown now using synthetic genomes when you put new DNA software into the cell the

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.600
protein robots read it immediately start producing the proteins coded for changing the cellular

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:09.560
phenotype and when you change the DNA software you change the species this is all consistent with

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:14.360
Schrodinger's code script and organisms astonishing gift of concentrating a stream of order on itself

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.000
Schrodinger citing the second law of thermodynamics the entropy principle the natural

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.920
tendency of things to go over into disorder describe the notion of order based on order

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.200
we get the order from the genetic code we get the order from its interpretation into

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.600
we can digitize life and regenerate life from the digital world and just as the ribosome can

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:38.120
convert the analog message and mRNA into a protein robot it's becoming standard now in the world

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:45.000
of science to convert digital code into proteins viruses and now cells scientists send digital

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.160
code to each other instead of sending genes or proteins and there's several companies around

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.440
the world that make their living by synthesizing genes for scientific labs it's faster and cheaper

01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.440
to synthesize a gene than is the clonet or even get it by federal express an example of this

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:06.040
digital biological conversion is we've been working on new ways to make vaccines using synthetic DNA

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:10.040
and we progress this process very efficiently and now working with barda in the u.s. government

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:15.000
and novartis barda sends us an email containing a test pandemic flu sequence and we have less

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.760
than 24 hours to convert that digital code into a virus we now have that process under 12 hours

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.960
we get that to novartis and they're ready to scale up production for vaccines now we're in the process

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:32.520
of building a much smaller simpler what i call digital conversion device so my digital biological

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.000
converter is going to work somewhat like the telephone where it takes digital waves and converts

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.560
it into sound waves so you can hear it only will have a small box that you could attach to a computer

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:48.600
to in fact receive a digital wave and convert it into a protein perhaps a vaccine or even a cell

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.800
so think about in a future flu pandemic we could this sounds a lot like that that thing that David

01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.840
Hone talked about where you got a arm band on one side that reads the pathogen and arm band on the

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.200
other side that makes the vaccine and injects it in you is he not talking about exactly the same

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.520
thing am i a am i a crazy person here barda and novartis

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.200
we distribute a new vaccine in seconds around the world because this is biology now moving

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:22.520
at the speed of light perhaps even through each individual home oh no this wasn't a plan there's

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.480
no way that this was a plan how could you possibly believe it's a plan if it was a plan they would

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:34.040
have been talking about what they were going to do for years already uh all life is derived

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.080
currently from other cellular life but i think it's just a short matter of time before someone

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:44.120
discovers the right chemical cocktail of enzymes ribosomes lipids together with the synthetic genome

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:49.080
to just to create a simple boot up system to get cells without a prior cellular history

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.200
wow that's amazing i'm sure it's you know only a matter of time before we are curing childhood

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:59.400
diseases with retroviruses in every childhood her every uh children's hospital in america i'm

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:04.200
sure it's not very long before the futurist dream of being able to look at your kid and

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.920
pick all the phenotypes you want and dial up the intelligence and musical creativity

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.240
will be as simple as calling craig ventors uh company and saying sequence me

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.520
so let's look at the tremendous progress in this last seven years and shorteners

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.080
lecture on this campus and try to imagine things 70 years from now uh jim watson still with us

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.600
whether he'll be with us 70 years from now is an open question try to imagine 70 years from now

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:36.360
is exactly the bamboozlement and mythology they want you to do by imagining a future that he just

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:42.440
brainwashed you into believing in or imagining you are accepting the model of reality that is in

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:49.880
that imaginary model in that imaginary image that model is what he just got through describing

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:58.280
which is that we are the summation of chemistry and physics there's nothing else

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.760
protein machines mindlessly do what they're told

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:08.200
and we are nothing more than a Turing machine that reads a tape

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:16.280
that's what craig vetner that's what all the people at the human genome project that's what

01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:21.800
all the people that want to enslave your grandchildren want you to believe about your biology

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:28.120
about your children's biology and about the flawed nature of every child that's born

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:35.160
when in reality it's exact inversion of the truth children are born perfect

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:42.840
and even if they're born imperfect it is a perfect imperfect that cannot be augmented

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:50.360
through any rudimentary understanding that we think we have of this pattern integrity

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:53.880
it can't it simply cannot

01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:00.120
but certainly some of you will be here in 70 years so in the year 2082 what will be happening

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:06.440
well we just saw my friend Elon Musk launch a private space flight to go up to the space station

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.520
certainly within 70 years we will have colonized the moon and Mars there's several working on trying

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:15.640
to do that so just like new life forms for food in 70 years we're going to be on Mars you see

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:21.000
where we're going here and I mean Robert Malone thought within 10 years we would be curing childhood

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.360
diseases with retroviruses and we're at least 30 years off on that if not 40

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:34.200
WTF ladies and gentlemen how can we take these people seriously when they've been doing exactly

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:40.040
what Peter Teal said they've been doing which is lying and exaggerating because of the hyperspecialization

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:47.080
completely allows it and because we're producing so much knowledge i.e. noise

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:54.440
with this endless reiterative falsification of hypotheses driven by preparean thinking

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:02.680
and every one of these people knows it Peter Teal knows it Elon Musk knows it

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:07.480
the Weinstein's probably know it because they've probably had it explained to them by their father

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.280
by these guys

01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:16.120
it's an elaborate hoax ladies and gentlemen the quicker that we can teach it to our kids the quicker

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:22.840
that we break free energy production new medicines perhaps a vaccine could be sent from earth to

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:28.600
Mars at the speed of light taking somewhere between 4.3 and 21 minutes to get their depending on the

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.560
distance between earth and Mars the digital and biological worlds are now becoming interchangeable

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:39.160
perhaps more importantly and i'll speak to this again on on Saturday evening synthetic life

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:43.000
is going to be the tool that allows us to understand the diversity of life on this planet

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.160
and hopefully enable new industries to produce food fuel clean water and medicine

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:53.000
as we add a billion people to the planet over the next 12 years and every 12 years of following

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.400
that as we'll hear in a few minutes and you heard in the introduction Schrodinger's life

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:02.520
helps to stimulate the Jim Watson and Francis Crick over 60 years ago to help kick off this new

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:08.520
era of the DNA world with their discovery of the double helix one can only hope that this new

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.400
frontier of synthetic life will have a similar impact on the future thank you very much

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:27.640
yeah go back and sit down there sir ladies and gentlemen this has been giga ohm biological

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:33.240
it is a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist make no

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:39.160
mistake about it ladies and gentlemen why is it doing that dang it i clicked on that slide like

01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:48.440
three times now click click current slide there we go so we are in a trap right now ladies and

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:54.200
gentlemen we are in a trap and we are being trapped in this new world order where all of these things

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:59.560
that peter vetner said are about to come true all of this virology is real all this pandemic

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.480
potential is real and if we allow this mythology to be passed on to our children our children will

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:13.800
be enslaved by these machines by these softwares and by these apps not by the ai to come but by the

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:22.120
algorithms currently deployed and by the liars currently lying ladies and gentlemen please stop

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.920
all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:34.520
necessary intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.440
immune system is dumb transfection is criminally negligent and viruses are not pattern integrity

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:44.600
so thanks very much for joining me i will see you again tomorrow i have an interview with

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:50.760
thomas binder and we are trying to decide whether we want to do 12 o'clock or i rather one o'clock

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.760
and have two hours and i think that's what we're going to do right now it's scheduled for two

01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:00.520
but don't be surprised if it starts at one or if it's scheduled for one don't be surprised if it

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:05.720
starts at twelve because i'm going to try and get two hours with thomas instead of one so

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:09.880
he's offered an earlier hour i'm going to take it and then i'll change the schedule when i have

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.280
confirmation i'll see you tomorrow for thomas binder it's going to be a great discussion one of my

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:20.680
favorite people on the interwebs with regard to the pandemic and speaking truth to this power

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.680
i'm really excited about that you can find me at giggleonbiological.com don't underestimate how

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:32.200
much we are sacrificing for this it might look like this is a very rich production but it's a

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:38.840
couple of free cameras got a couple of craigslist hardware devices and an old mac that's what we're

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:45.480
doing this with and my family is absolutely positively living off of this stream so

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.160
if you can see that i've got about a hundred and ten subscribers that's about a thousand

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:54.840
dollars a month we have two thousand four hundred dollars a month in rent because we rent from

01:56:54.840 --> 01:57:01.800
a weaponized pile of money that's starting to take over the residential property in in

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:07.560
pittsburgh so i'm i'm asking for help i'm begging for help i need everybody's help and if you are

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:14.520
already helping then share if you are already helping then share and if you can't help please

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:19.800
share that's about all i can say because that's what we need we need millions of viewers thousand

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.320
subscribers and we can actually win i'm convinced of it thank you very much for joining me and i'll

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:32.920
see you again soon tomorrow for sure intellectual bright web we'll be back tomorrow for sure thanks

01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.960
you

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:19.960
i would be very up for meeting anyone in northern corner of western pennsylvania for a picnic

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:25.000
on the eighth of april if you want to organize that with me you got to email me directly i'm not

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:30.200
gonna tell everybody in the world where my little family's gonna go but i would be happy to have

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:36.520
anybody who wants to join me it is the eighth it is i think two monday's from now um we won't

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:42.040
have a chance to see this again without a big travel expense so hopefully we're gonna get clear

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:47.640
weather um my boss at the university of pittsburgh actually didn't let me go see the one at the

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:53.960
beginning of the pandemic and uh we got in a big fight about it actually uh i wanted to go camping

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.920
in tevisi and see it and he wouldn't allow me to do it so this this is one i'm not gonna miss i

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:04.040
just hope that i hope that we have cloudless day on that day okay see you later guys thank you

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:06.760
i'll see you tomorrow

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.280
you
