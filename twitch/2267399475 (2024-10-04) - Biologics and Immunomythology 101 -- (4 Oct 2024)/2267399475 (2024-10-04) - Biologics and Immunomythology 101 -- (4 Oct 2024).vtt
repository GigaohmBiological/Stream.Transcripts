WEBVTT

00:44.628 --> 00:46.569
Oh, yeah.

00:47.069 --> 00:49.971
Everybody knows it's the Twin Towers.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.652
Our big, strong, high buildings, yeah.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.534
Larger than any buildings in New York City.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.176
These guys are big and bad.

01:00.916 --> 01:20.102
i'm telling you something right now they may be earthquake proof they may be typhoon proof they may be tidal wave proof but when the mega powers the strongest force in the universe goes against the twin towers it's gonna be like a ball angle

01:20.302 --> 01:22.083
going right through their foundation.

01:22.863 --> 01:32.869
And the Richter scale is going to spin around 42 times, go into orbit, and you're going to see the twin towers come crumbling down.

01:32.909 --> 01:33.009
Yeah.

01:33.029 --> 01:43.155
Well, you know, brothers and sisters, reading back through time, there was one character.

01:53.069 --> 02:06.652
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.733
I don't know crash the dollar.

02:08.953 --> 02:13.854
I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value We have left.

02:14.054 --> 02:17.235
I don't know but I know for sure that

02:17.523 --> 02:34.948
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

02:37.069 --> 02:43.811
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.272
But actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:47.352 --> 03:03.396
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually JJ Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.411
Ruby is doing great.

03:13.491 --> 03:20.099
As far as we can tell, Ruby is back to 99.9% healthy for a nine-year-old dog.

03:21.481 --> 03:27.408
Her legs are a little weaker than they were, but up until last week she was still running upstairs.

03:29.491 --> 03:34.598
We're not letting her do that anymore because the vet told us that was really dumb for already many years.

03:35.699 --> 03:40.225
But she still wants to do it, and so we have to make her walk through the front door.

03:40.685 --> 03:41.606
But she's really good.

03:42.928 --> 03:47.013
She's back to her old self again, at least as far as we can tell, of course.

03:47.874 --> 03:56.366
As her owners, we're still always seeing something wrong with her now because we came so close to feeling like we lost her.

03:56.426 --> 04:00.091
So we're still getting over that a little bit, but thanks for asking.

04:01.253 --> 04:01.553
It's good.

04:48.953 --> 04:49.333
Ha!

04:49.614 --> 04:51.616
The wrestler said that in 1989.

04:51.656 --> 04:54.538
He said that in 1989.

04:55.099 --> 05:09.233
The overhead view is of me in a maze.

05:10.053 --> 05:12.476
And you see what I'm hunting a few steps away.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.457
But I take a wrong turn and I'm on the wrong path.

05:21.077 --> 05:24.098
And the people all watching enjoy a good laugh.

05:29.159 --> 05:34.221
Embarrassed with failure, I try to reverse the course that my train had already commenced.

05:53.186 --> 06:21.192
Subduing the trauma, engulfing my dream Invaded through what was an unguarded sea The torrent of helplessness swept me away To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay Inside me a voice was repeating the phrase You've lost it, you'll never get out of this maze

06:23.147 --> 06:25.411
We'll never get out of this maze.

07:20.895 --> 07:31.022
Seriously, it's time to start making your plans to be in Pittsburgh for November 3rd, the first live live stream of GigaOM Biological.

07:31.803 --> 07:37.066
It will take place here in Bethel Park, just south of Pittsburgh in the little suburb where I live.

07:38.447 --> 07:41.529
If not too many people show up, we're going to have a gathering afterward.

07:43.442 --> 07:58.100
There are people coming from Switzerland already, so if you're in the United States and you have the means to drive here, by all means get here, because we need to start building this real live

08:00.165 --> 08:08.409
We need to build this community and the way to do it is for us to hug and to share a room together, if you will.

08:09.550 --> 08:16.413
A stage and a room and a mic and music and commiserate together, if you will.

08:16.513 --> 08:17.974
So that's the 3rd of November.

08:18.754 --> 08:26.118
The first two days of that weekend are actually a Brownstone meeting here in Pittsburgh, not sold out.

08:26.198 --> 08:27.579
It's incredibly expensive.

08:27.619 --> 08:28.319
It's like $500 to attend.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.240
But I already have tickets.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.041
Mark Kulak already has tickets.

08:33.921 --> 08:35.522
Joe Marshall already has tickets.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.782
And we're all going to be there.

08:36.822 --> 08:55.569
And so if you wanted to be at the Brownstone with people that are allies and help us to force them to see and to hear the messages that we are there, join us if you can afford it.

08:57.821 --> 09:03.165
We'll find a way because now is the time, ladies and gentlemen.

09:03.185 --> 09:10.191
The window of opportunity will start to close over the next year or so as the kids tune out.

09:11.712 --> 09:24.662
And as the skilled social media users continue to tune out, we're not going to have a lot of time for them to keep looking back to still be able to see clearly enough

09:25.598 --> 09:29.804
what they did to us and what they tricked us into telling our kids.

11:25.506 --> 11:26.867
You'll never get out of this maze.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.409
You'll never get out of this maze.

11:28.429 --> 11:33.214
You'll never get out of this maze.

11:33.234 --> 11:38.059
You'll never get out of this maze.

11:38.780 --> 11:41.443
You'll never get out of this maze.

11:41.463 --> 11:43.966
You'll never get out of this maze.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.131
Never get out of this maze.

12:05.151 --> 12:06.692
Never get out of this maze.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.193
Never get out of this maze.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.594
Never get out of this maze.

12:39.304 --> 12:41.225
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

12:42.285 --> 12:47.048
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.249
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.590
It's embarrassing.

13:01.194 --> 13:02.074
Well, darn it.

13:02.534 --> 13:03.335
Just ignore this.

13:09.065 --> 13:11.326
Let me check that study for you there fella.

13:11.406 --> 13:26.471
I think that's probably the one this will this will pause for a second Load up already with you I don't know why I'm going to the wayback machine.

13:26.531 --> 13:26.691
Yes.

13:26.751 --> 13:37.575
That's the one that is the that is the that is the paper That is the paper, uh that you just dropped in there that is the paper

13:41.933 --> 13:43.214
Sorry for the long introduction.

13:43.254 --> 13:48.658
It takes me a while to get everything running here and to get all the coffee down my throat before I can start.

13:49.739 --> 13:56.564
We are still trying to take back the power from these charlatans, the charlatans that we inherited from our parents.

13:57.364 --> 14:04.389
Interestingly, Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS has posted some stuff on X and elsewhere.

14:05.290 --> 14:06.390
Might be of interest to you.

14:06.450 --> 14:08.012
It seems like some of the data

14:08.772 --> 14:13.994
from World War II may not have disappeared in the fires, you know, may not have been buried or lost.

14:15.055 --> 14:19.777
It may have been funneled through the Vatican and to the Rockefeller Institute.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.037
Wouldn't that be interesting?

14:21.517 --> 14:27.380
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

14:28.180 --> 14:31.003
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

14:31.503 --> 14:35.287
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

14:35.327 --> 14:39.971
We're working on a biology 101 course curriculum.

14:40.231 --> 14:46.557
It's a curriculum development progress right now, but that project is also available on PeerTube.

14:48.038 --> 14:52.523
I'm gonna escape out of here and restart the show.

14:53.854 --> 14:56.877
The mystery virus is not equal to the excess deaths.

14:57.017 --> 15:01.961
In fact, they have very good explanation for why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

15:01.981 --> 15:13.871
And we have a very good explanation for why none of the lawyers that are involved in any of these fake groups will talk about strict liability or the Seventh Amendment violation that these laws are until very recently.

15:14.571 --> 15:24.573
Very recently, people are starting to slip up because this call for a new consensus about these ideas is starting to become unignorable.

15:25.173 --> 15:39.436
And so rather than them giving us credit or Mark credit or anyone credit for having figured this out in 2020, the same people that created this illusion by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate

15:40.356 --> 15:49.065
are now trying to absorb these ideas, trying to pretend that they've been telling people all along not to take vaccines.

15:49.626 --> 15:55.112
We've been saying that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal for years.

15:58.029 --> 15:59.731
And of course they're lying about that.

16:00.051 --> 16:05.837
And they're gonna keep lying because they need to be able to control this illusion of consensus.

16:06.017 --> 16:11.842
Even if the limited spectrum of debate needs to be expanded a little bit to contain me.

16:12.603 --> 16:24.774
or needs to be expanded a little bit to contain Mark, maybe they need to have some guy like Matt Crawford start a campfire wiki so that we can have some of this stuff archived on the internet.

16:24.814 --> 16:36.765
Or maybe they can get some other chick to start archiving stuff on the internet instead of just all these people saying, well, you know, Jonathan Cui has pretty much nailed the biology about RNA not being able to pandemic.

16:37.245 --> 16:44.290
And Mark Kulak has done a pretty good job of cataloging the real history of these people and the real mentors that matter.

16:45.031 --> 16:56.859
But they're not doing that because these people are in charge of, paid to create and maintain the illusion of consensus and the limited spectrum of debate that is defined by it.

16:57.560 --> 17:02.784
Because we are currently experiencing a transition to a new kind of totalitarianism.

17:03.504 --> 17:14.110
where the highly trained acolytes of the ruling oligarchy will quietly bamboozle us on social media while we think that they are the heroes.

17:14.851 --> 17:23.696
In fact, these are fake heroes that were provided to us by the exact same military operation that

17:25.057 --> 17:29.360
Tony Fauci is behind, that all of these people are behind.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.501
It's a military operation.

17:31.741 --> 17:40.767
It is a government operation around the world to invert all of our sovereignty so that they can start mass data collection openly.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.429
They don't have to hide it anymore.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.110
They don't have to steal it anymore.

17:44.410 --> 17:48.092
They don't have to lie about it or just get the data from sick people.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.394
They can take it from everyone.

17:52.133 --> 18:07.000
And that's why the weaponized piles of money have used social media to convince us that these people are the people that are arguing for us, and they know what to argue about, and they are definitely the people we want arguing for us.

18:11.351 --> 18:19.432
And no more than I want Tony Fauci arguing for my kids do I want Brett Weinstein or Robert Malone arguing for my kids.

18:19.973 --> 18:27.754
And yet somehow or another, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the rest of these oligarchs have decided that these are the people that we should argue with.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.474
And these are the things that we should argue about.

18:30.494 --> 18:36.835
And conveniently for the slavers, this has enforced the narrative of a novel virus that we needed to be saved from.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.696
And we probably need digital ID to protect us from in the future.

18:40.731 --> 18:48.618
And as long as we allow ourselves to be governed by social media monkeys, we will always be governed by their mythology.

18:49.078 --> 18:51.720
You need to get off social media and get off now.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.943
If you want to know who this is, my name is Jonathan Couey.

18:54.963 --> 19:05.251
You can search for me on PubMed to find the record of the work that I did when I was still chasing tenure at a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine faculty.

19:07.363 --> 19:10.265
I am, as far as I know, the only U.S.

19:10.325 --> 19:13.786
faculty member to lose a career because I spoke out about this stuff.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.467
Everybody else hasn't lost a job.

19:15.527 --> 19:16.547
They've gotten a book deal.

19:17.067 --> 19:18.508
Everybody else hasn't lost a job.

19:18.548 --> 19:19.809
They started a new business.

19:20.369 --> 19:29.272
And all I got is this little stream and my name in Robert F. Kennedy's book as an advisor.

19:30.013 --> 19:31.794
You can find my work on PeerTube.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.894
You can find clips from Jeff.

19:35.575 --> 19:41.476
Also there, you can find a calendar and the coursework we're working on, as well as the books to download there.

19:42.416 --> 19:45.337
And the Batcave is a significant archive of videos.

19:45.357 --> 19:48.218
And of course, Housatonic ITS is publishing there as well.

19:48.278 --> 19:50.598
So it's a one-stop shop for the truth, really.

19:51.278 --> 20:02.041
It's a one-stop shop to find out what's going on without having to input a name or have an algorithm store or throw things at you afterward.

20:02.381 --> 20:03.381
No ads, nothing.

20:04.963 --> 20:07.144
That's what we are doing there.

20:07.204 --> 20:12.405
That's what the viewers of GigaOM Biological are actually doing there, which is pretty cool.

20:13.525 --> 20:24.448
And if you are a supporter of this stream, you should definitely take credit for and share that Peertube site because that's really what I invest my money in besides

20:26.508 --> 20:43.296
besides food and rent uh anyway ladies and gentlemen we are still working on the covid shots are bad situation uh i'm gonna go back to this if you don't mind what is happening here glitch out glitch out hello glitching out

20:47.329 --> 20:49.411
That's what happens.

20:49.491 --> 20:49.851
Good morning.

20:50.331 --> 20:50.952
Hello, welcome.

20:51.432 --> 20:56.016
This is Jonathan Cui from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, coming to you live from my garage as usual.

20:57.817 --> 20:59.038
It is the 4th of October, 2024.

20:59.779 --> 21:11.548
I wanted to do a study hall today, but as usual, I'm going to give you a very brief introduction as to where we are, just in case there's somebody here for the first time or catches this stream live or not live for the first time.

21:12.468 --> 21:15.390
I just want you to understand where we are and what's going on.

21:15.450 --> 21:27.478
Right now, social media and our really skillful use of it has convinced us to pay attention to a certain subset of dissidents and a certain subset of, let's say, mainstream leaders.

21:27.958 --> 21:38.565
And those groups of people have been put in front of us artificially, programmed to be in front of us, so that no matter whether you questioned the television narrative or not,

21:39.065 --> 21:46.013
you had a group of controlled individuals that was going to tell you that the COVID shots are bad, but let's not talk about 2020.

21:47.154 --> 21:53.882
And that is the magic because Robert Malone and Tony Fauci, Francis Collins and people

21:53.882 --> 21:57.544
Peter McCullough, apparently Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:57.844 --> 22:09.151
and Del Bigtree are not able to know or figure out or go back in history or the numbers to see that there were bigger families in America after World War II.

22:09.211 --> 22:15.135
And that trend of bigger families did not sustain itself until the 90s, but in fact decreased.

22:15.195 --> 22:21.899
And at the same time, our ability to make people live longer, to extend their lives with end-of-life care,

22:22.279 --> 22:33.365
has greatly increased, and a lot of our medical system is based on that for-profit model of taking care of old people in their old age, because they have retirement money that they can spend.

22:33.845 --> 22:50.693
And so they knew, they knew that slowly but surely we were gonna have a problem as the percentage of our population that was approaching the end of life increased, and in fact increased in a mathematically identifiable way 20 years ago already.

22:50.753 --> 22:51.274
They knew

22:52.054 --> 22:59.198
that the combination of better health care and these large families was going to eventually leave us with a big pile of old people.

22:59.698 --> 23:12.085
And what better way for a biosecurity state that was really interested in getting rid of the individualism of America, the sovereignty of individuals, and conforming to a more globalist idea

23:12.925 --> 23:20.287
of our biology, you know, like that contained in this book, where we need to get our big boy pants on and take control of our evolution.

23:20.327 --> 23:23.267
And the only way to do that is get rid of these pesky nation states.

23:23.447 --> 23:33.249
I assure you that all of the governments in the West coordinated at the beginning of the pandemic for one reason and one reason only, because they all had this problem.

23:33.809 --> 23:41.671
And a mismanagement of this problem could have potentially bankrupt any Western nation because a population pyramid of this shape isn't good.

23:42.796 --> 23:48.242
And it's only gonna get worse as the replacement population underneath is smaller and smaller.

23:48.262 --> 23:55.028
It is potentially in 20 or 30 years when our children are having children, a kind of collapse.

23:56.330 --> 23:57.010
And they know this.

23:57.864 --> 24:02.927
They know that this increase in all-cause mortality is going to go away.

24:03.527 --> 24:14.734
And unfortunately, I am pessimistic enough to believe that it's possible that they put Denny Rancourt in place early in 2020 to control the narrative about all-cause mortality.

24:15.154 --> 24:20.077
And very specifically, the super smart, very brilliant, highly insightful, hundreds of

24:20.877 --> 24:45.409
of figures and hundreds of pages of publications since May of 2020, this guy, Denny Rancourt, is apparently unaware that the entire Western world was expecting this, unaware of why China would have instituted a one-child policy and what could possibly be the mathematical consequences of that over time in a population.

24:49.827 --> 24:55.095
I'm sorry, but I'm very frustrated because I see only liars.

24:56.096 --> 24:59.761
And so unless these people come clean very, very quick.

25:00.592 --> 25:19.272
and admit that all Western nations knew this was coming, and it would have been a trivial thing for them to have tweaked the protocols around standard respiratory disease to increase the all-cause mortality in line with this, to take advantage of this, and then tell us it was a crisis.

25:19.312 --> 25:20.293
And that's what they did.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.715
They murdered people and lied about it.

25:22.795 --> 25:32.717
And now weaponized piles of money, convincing us with whom to argue and what to argue about, have effectively pulled the wool over our eyes and run out the clock on this.

25:36.318 --> 25:42.720
And now we're worried about the election and what's going to come in Ukraine and whether or not Israel and Iran are going to bomb each other.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.580
And we're worried about all of these things.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.101
And that has run out the clock.

25:49.394 --> 25:54.317
It's run out the clock for all our neighbors, and more importantly, it's run out the clock for our young people.

25:54.357 --> 26:11.128
You know, those 20-somethings that were completely lost at the beginning of the pandemic because none of us adults were capable of standing up because we were skillfully using social media and completely unaware that most of the people that that algorithm was putting in front of us were liars.

26:13.320 --> 26:34.294
not spontaneously rising despite the censorship, or not fighting the censorship, but actually being elevated by the censorship, put in front of us by the censorship, given Joe Rogan promotion by the censorship, put on Tucker Carlson by the censorship, given new social media like Locals and Gab and Telegram by the censorship.

26:36.004 --> 26:44.790
We thought that that was the writhing of the free system, trying to fight against the oligarchy, when in reality, that was just part of the theater.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.451
And they got names from that.

26:47.531 --> 26:53.855
They got names of people who would take action, people who were willing to leave one platform to go to another.

26:53.895 --> 26:56.097
They got all kinds of names from that.

26:57.386 --> 27:00.588
We gave them information and we continue to give them information.

27:00.648 --> 27:13.694
Every time we tweet on X, every time we post and we think that it's just going out into the public, it's going into their machine and their machine through programming decides whether that's worth anybody seeing or not.

27:14.474 --> 27:17.236
It's not an algorithm that's out of their control.

27:17.696 --> 27:21.699
It's not a algorithm that does things they don't want it to do.

27:21.819 --> 27:31.365
It is a programmed set of programs that are probably military, and you don't see reality.

27:31.425 --> 27:33.607
You see what that program wants you to see.

27:33.647 --> 27:41.172
You see the struggle of Pierre Kory trying to come to terms with the fact that he didn't know any of this before the pandemic.

27:41.212 --> 27:42.493
He's so frustrated.

27:44.059 --> 27:52.548
You see Mary Holland fighting for free something, free health speech or something.

27:54.270 --> 27:55.931
You don't see reality.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.894
You see what YouTube puts in front of you.

27:59.335 --> 28:01.197
You see what X puts in front of you.

28:02.878 --> 28:06.222
And unless we start building an independent bright web,

28:07.188 --> 28:24.220
where people that matter have their peer tube, people that matter have their soapbox, people that have something to say have a website and host some videos there or run a podcast and people share that stuff by sharing it via email.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.781
Unless we go back to that,

28:26.980 --> 28:48.532
If we continue to acquiesce to the idea that either government has to keep their hands off or the government has to make it free or something, if we don't make it free ourselves, and if we don't free ourselves from this mythology and how it is generated, then we will be enslaved by it.

28:48.612 --> 28:50.713
Our children will be enslaved by it.

28:54.636 --> 28:59.998
And if you want to learn how they did it, you have to look at the recent history that is still available on the web.

29:00.279 --> 29:01.259
It's still out there.

29:01.919 --> 29:11.424
You just got to stop looking at the current crap and do the homework necessary to see who talked about repurposed drugs when, the spike protein, the fear and cleavage site.

29:11.464 --> 29:16.466
We still have people saying things that are absurd.

29:18.698 --> 29:32.241
I just heard the guy from Bay John Health today say that people who made antibodies to the fear and cleavage site, yada, yada, yada, in 2024, he's that guy, yes.

29:33.601 --> 29:43.403
And this is a narrative that is seeded so that they would have the excuse, the intellectual cover, and the plausible deniability.

29:44.565 --> 29:50.636
to say that we don't know whether it's the spike protein from the virus or the spike protein from the transfection.

29:50.696 --> 29:51.959
And so it must be both.

29:53.522 --> 29:57.068
And now that that's run its way out, now they're gonna go to contamination.

29:58.581 --> 30:01.263
because millions of people were saved by transfection.

30:01.323 --> 30:03.125
And that was the plan all along.

30:03.165 --> 30:07.509
That's why all of these people were put in place and given little nuggets of information.

30:08.409 --> 30:16.316
Any of these nuggets of information that these people were on and all about for so long were ceded to them, encouraged to them.

30:16.476 --> 30:20.400
Or when people stumbled upon these ideas, they were promoted artificially.

30:21.431 --> 30:31.322
And they thought that they were rising because they were smart or because they were onto something, just like I thought I was rising when I was coming out about the lab leak in 2020 and I was getting promoted.

30:31.802 --> 30:35.646
That Bret Weinstein was really listening to me in a single signal chat.

30:45.222 --> 30:55.702
And so the main trick to hear is, of course, that before the pandemic, there were people like Lori Garrett and many others who were

30:58.029 --> 31:07.651
who were talking about endemicity and how if the bat cave virus gets out, the reason why we need these pandemic preparedness plans is so that we can really close it down, right?

31:08.171 --> 31:25.694
Remember that Robert Malone was involved in the ring vaccination studies where they would have an Ebola outbreak, which is a virus that's curiously, closely, structurally related to a viral-like protein patent held by David Hohn and Sina Bavari.

31:25.734 --> 31:26.474
You could look that up.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.755
But Ebola looks a lot like that.

31:28.795 --> 31:42.662
But anyway, when Ebola broke out, then Robert Malone was involved in the ring vaccination stuff, you know, where he would go or help design the deployment of vaccine in nearby villages to prevent the spread of Ebola.

31:42.722 --> 31:47.384
Not very different from this idea that we've got to prevent endemicity.

31:47.904 --> 31:51.566
If a virus gets out, the worst case scenario would be it would contribute

31:52.246 --> 32:03.534
be a new part of the already existing background of death that Mother Nature provides for us and that public health saves us from with their miracle vaccines.

32:04.574 --> 32:12.302
And so the idea of a new virus going endemic was a story that these people were telling on Brett Weinstein's podcast.

32:12.322 --> 32:13.303
They were talking about it.

32:13.923 --> 32:22.752
And the reality is, is that they don't want you to realize that a background versus endemicity, there's no difference biologically because we got no data from before 2020.

32:27.958 --> 32:38.161
And you can guarantee that any national security state, anybody like James Giordano or the like would have known that, would have seen that years and years and years ago.

32:38.201 --> 32:49.965
You don't think that somebody as smart as Henry Kissinger or Hilary Kaprowski or Stanley Plotkin or Tony Fauci or Francis Collins or Mark Lander or Kevin McKernan wouldn't know that?

32:51.238 --> 32:56.764
wouldn't know that the background isn't any different than endemicity if we don't have data before 2020.

32:57.345 --> 32:58.466
Wouldn't they know that?

32:58.506 --> 32:59.927
Of course they'd know that.

33:00.949 --> 33:03.972
And that's why they haven't explained it.

33:05.250 --> 33:12.753
because they are all part of this imperative that was identified by the Human Genome Project's lack of completion.

33:13.014 --> 33:20.977
Lying about being complete was really an admission behind closed doors that, holy crap, the problem is a lot bigger than we thought.

33:21.017 --> 33:27.880
The only way it'll ever happen is if we have computers that don't exist now and we have data collection systems that don't exist now.

33:27.940 --> 33:33.623
Otherwise, we've got no hope and a snowball's chance in hell of even coming close to cracking this problem.

33:38.234 --> 33:40.796
And that's why none of them will talk about the background.

33:40.836 --> 33:46.400
They'll never talk about the real ways that PCR can be used on an academic bench that weren't used during COVID.

33:46.780 --> 33:51.804
They won't talk about how transfection is transfection, even in its purest form, it would have been stupid.

33:52.304 --> 34:02.752
And they won't tell you why transformation and transfection and the history of them, so that you'd know that Jesse Gelsinger already told us that transformation wasn't gonna work in healthy humans.

34:03.152 --> 34:07.576
And so that's why they rolled it out in a limited way and then said, oh, no, it doesn't work.

34:07.596 --> 34:09.077
We're going to pull that one off the market.

34:09.097 --> 34:10.519
But the MRNA works great.

34:11.059 --> 34:11.800
Stop lying.

34:13.161 --> 34:20.447
And Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose, they're all were involved in that debate to make it seem like there was something real happening there.

34:20.487 --> 34:21.048
And it wasn't.

34:22.130 --> 34:36.873
And meanwhile, these very sophisticated molecular biologists with decades of experience still can't explain to you how, what infectious clone means in the virology literature is actually transfection and transformation of cell cultures.

34:37.113 --> 34:37.393
Done.

34:37.413 --> 34:41.654
And the weird part is, is even the no virus people can't explain that.

34:41.754 --> 34:46.435
Even after I wrote them a letter about it, the only thing they could do is say, send me some papers.

34:48.669 --> 34:57.773
And CHD, they also can't seem to teach this, even though I've taught them this, even though I taught the entire staff of the book editing staff.

34:58.173 --> 34:59.234
Everybody knows this.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.515
They've heard this in Zoom meetings.

35:01.575 --> 35:03.176
Mary Holland knows this.

35:03.276 --> 35:07.438
She might not be sophisticated enough to understand it, but she definitely knows it.

35:08.584 --> 35:13.931
And I assure you that Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:14.012 --> 35:17.937
all are sophisticated enough to understand how RNA cannot pandemic.

35:17.957 --> 35:19.299
It's a pretty bold statement.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.884
It's a pretty bold statement, isn't it?

35:23.024 --> 35:24.526
And if you look into the literature,

35:25.478 --> 35:26.959
excuse my incredible spit there.

35:27.340 --> 35:46.418
If you look into the literature and the only thing you can find are papers by Ralph Baric and Mark Denison about remdesivir or Allison Totura and Sina Bavari about remdesivir saving us from a coronavirus pandemic and that remdesivir is a really interesting drug because it works on the proofreading protein of coronaviruses.

35:46.758 --> 35:47.439
Stop lying.

35:47.939 --> 35:50.980
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

35:51.020 --> 35:57.841
And the only way that they can avoid acknowledging this is by either lambasting me or ignoring me.

35:57.881 --> 36:00.582
That's why that's what's all going to happen from now on.

36:01.262 --> 36:03.703
I assure you, that's all that's going to happen from now on.

36:04.183 --> 36:09.044
At first, it was just me sitting in the chair on social media thinking eventually these people would

36:09.704 --> 36:11.565
would pivot to these ideas.

36:11.645 --> 36:18.088
But now I know, and I have learned through painful experience, that they will never pivot to these ideas unless we make them.

36:18.128 --> 36:20.769
And then when they do, they will do it minimally.

36:23.070 --> 36:25.672
And you can see it on social media right now.

36:25.752 --> 36:32.135
These people are already doing it, that they're admitting that the food processed is bad, that the environment is polluted.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.850
Big agriculture is bad.

36:35.331 --> 36:36.651
Cosmetics are toxic.

36:36.671 --> 36:38.231
We should have never used sunscreen.

36:38.632 --> 36:41.853
The old vaccine schedule wasn't tested, and RFK Jr.

36:41.893 --> 36:42.973
has been right all along.

36:43.433 --> 36:45.034
They will admit that COVID shots are bad.

36:45.054 --> 36:45.814
Of course they are.

36:45.834 --> 36:47.814
I mean, you know, they screwed them up.

36:47.854 --> 36:49.335
They got DNA in them.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.431
And they're just gonna use science to fix this stuff.

36:52.511 --> 36:57.074
Kevin McKernan will clean it up with his friend Buckhalter.

36:57.094 --> 36:58.975
They'll clean up all these transfections.

36:59.015 --> 36:59.755
They're really good.

37:00.496 --> 37:05.999
And Bobby will get the Health and Human Services and the CDC to pay for real trials.

37:07.780 --> 37:12.162
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, these people aren't risking anything, because they're playing for the slavers.

37:12.202 --> 37:14.103
That's why they rise on social media.

37:14.504 --> 37:18.366
And they won't speak candidly about 2020, because that's when they got all their instructions.

37:19.451 --> 37:23.873
That's when they still didn't really understand what the goal was and they went along with it anyway.

37:25.654 --> 37:28.415
They were aware of who they were playing for.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.176
They just weren't aware of where we were going.

37:30.216 --> 37:35.318
Now they know where we're going and they're even playing and doubling down because they know where we're going is terrifying.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.601
And they will attempt to awkwardly blame the U.S.

37:40.661 --> 37:42.001
military even though the U.S.

37:42.061 --> 37:43.142
military takes orders.

37:44.801 --> 37:57.671
even though the US military is actually in the hierarchy, lower than Health and Human Services, is very easy to misconstrue with the State Department and DITRA.

37:59.552 --> 38:03.235
These people are gonna continue to be very, very imprecise.

38:04.747 --> 38:15.552
with who they blame because they don't want to blame traitors in the American government, traitors in the UK government, traitors in the Canadian government for undermining the West.

38:15.612 --> 38:21.935
They don't want to admit that this is a coordinated operation across these countries that all had the same population problem.

38:23.896 --> 38:30.980
And they would love it if we could control, demolish America and the rest of the nation states that matter at the same time.

38:36.078 --> 38:46.327
I am absolutely terrified of the moves that Mike Eden is making right now because it feels very, very disingenuous.

38:46.387 --> 38:52.412
The first move that he made about a week ago was promoting someone who I know is a traitor, Jonathan Engler.

38:55.194 --> 39:13.056
chats from Twitter and emails that catalog exactly why he's a liar and why he is fake, including his never-ending defense of Claire Craig, who is a sequencing enthusiast.

39:14.197 --> 39:18.318
and somebody who worked very closely with Kevin McKernan in the beginning of the pandemic.

39:18.438 --> 39:20.079
So these are traders.

39:20.179 --> 39:29.482
These are people that are working against their own governments and against their own population to undermine nation states for some global imperative.

39:29.582 --> 39:32.643
And I'm afraid that Mike Eden has been playing along all along.

39:33.423 --> 39:43.126
Remember that when Mike Eden came out, he said that natural immunity was okay and that T-cells, which doesn't deny that there's a novel virus, doesn't even question it.

39:44.082 --> 39:49.752
and now for him to be usefully questioning it by promoting the Bailey's book is very bizarre.

39:51.295 --> 39:54.701
Very bizarre to the point of frightening to me because now

39:56.047 --> 40:08.077
Apparently, even Paul Alexander, who texts me regularly about how great I am and every once in a while does a very over-the-top sub-stack saying Jonathan Cooey is still the most right or something like that.

40:08.697 --> 40:17.885
Now, apparently, according to Paul Alexander, Dr. Michael Yeadon has discovered that Del Bigtree and some of the other skeptics are actually limited.

40:20.567 --> 40:23.830
Isn't that what we've been saying for like a year now, since I got fired?

40:25.399 --> 40:39.364
Isn't my being fired by CHD and Mary Holland for speaking about Robert Malone and interfering with the way that they can interact with their partners, isn't that the best evidence?

40:41.087 --> 40:43.388
for CHD being sabotaged from within.

40:43.548 --> 40:56.632
Isn't that the best evidence for these people that the biology that we're teaching about intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb or that RNA cannot pandemic, or we should call it transfection.

40:57.192 --> 41:03.974
None of those things are good evidence, but Mike Eden saying it is now the mother of all bombs.

41:05.049 --> 41:15.672
Or someone else saying it is the mother of all bombs, according to Paul Alexander, when he knows, Paul Alexander knows that he has been sending me texts over the last few days.

41:17.032 --> 41:26.074
Paul Alexander's texts is... Is it there or does he do signal?

41:26.114 --> 41:26.814
I can't remember how.

41:26.874 --> 41:28.315
Oh no, he's sending me emails.

41:28.375 --> 41:29.015
Sorry, my bad.

41:31.485 --> 41:34.950
Wanting to do a, let's see if I can find it here.

41:36.332 --> 41:38.856
The last email that I got from him was yesterday.

41:38.876 --> 41:41.840
And, oh no, sorry.

41:50.427 --> 41:51.628
two yesterday I got.

41:52.109 --> 41:56.213
So, hi, JJ, can we set up an interview for this weekend or Monday or Tuesday?

41:56.834 --> 42:00.358
The day we can use your platform, one hour, wide ranging.

42:00.418 --> 42:04.042
I want to get COVID across the spectrum, even politics.

42:04.082 --> 42:06.965
Look, this is literally from yesterday.

42:06.985 --> 42:07.045
See?

42:12.682 --> 42:13.983
Literally from yesterday.

42:14.043 --> 42:25.407
So it's strange to me that Paul Alexander, the guy who's been in contact with me sometimes daily now, just like Brett Weinstein was in contact with me daily for a while.

42:26.207 --> 42:29.008
Just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

42:29.068 --> 42:31.329
used to be in contact with me daily for a while.

42:32.150 --> 42:35.551
You know, Brian Hooker was in contact with me daily for a while.

42:37.042 --> 42:43.425
Paul Alexander says that Mike Eden has finally figured it out, that maybe these people never really intended to get us across the finish line.

42:43.465 --> 42:53.710
Maybe that's the reason why Del Bigtree and Mary Holland, until only very, very recently, have even approached the idea of using the word criminal to apply to a vaccine schedule.

42:54.851 --> 43:03.835
Because remember, when Mary first came out in 2015, she wasn't anti-vax, she just wanted the MMR tested and wanted to figure out what part of the MMR might've hurt her son.

43:05.253 --> 43:08.314
Don't forget that James Lyons Weiler isn't anti-vax.

43:08.334 --> 43:15.195
He just wants the vulnerable population to be identified so that the rest of the people can be mandated to take the vaccine.

43:16.075 --> 43:17.695
Remember that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:17.755 --> 43:18.916
isn't a vaccine skeptic.

43:18.956 --> 43:21.476
He just wants to give us tested vaccines.

43:22.436 --> 43:30.318
And so now the guy that they promote as having this message is Mike Eden, a non-American.

43:31.550 --> 43:33.591
We wouldn't want to have an American say this.

43:33.671 --> 43:36.813
Maybe an American that actually worked for the people who are saying this.

43:36.873 --> 43:40.335
Maybe a guy who is a consultant for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:40.375 --> 43:51.301
for a year and a staff scientist for CHD for half a year might have a little more insight into this than Mike Yeadon, who's been chilling on an island for a couple of years now because the pressure has been so great.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.103
No offense intended.

44:02.069 --> 44:17.739
If Mike Yeadon won't explain to you that all pharmaceutical companies that were making biologics before the pandemic had the facilities to make cDNA and synthetic RNA en masse, which would be PCR positive and sequence positive,

44:19.048 --> 44:31.854
He hasn't explained that to you in four years, just like Brian Artis, who's gone around the United States talking about venom and showing pictures of these big silver tanks, hasn't explained to you that before they make the venom, they make the RNA.

44:35.076 --> 44:41.078
Before they make the RNA, they make the DNA and they grow it up in a great big vat of bacteria.

44:41.098 --> 44:46.361
You know, like the lady from Inovio showed us yesterday.

44:51.052 --> 44:52.913
Please send this video to Mike Eden.

44:52.953 --> 44:54.194
I'd love to have him on the show.

44:54.254 --> 45:06.163
I'd love to have him and interview him and talk to him about why there is nuance required because there are industrial processes that can make synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA.

45:06.223 --> 45:11.486
And the only thing required for a pandemic would be to place these signals wherever they needed to be found.

45:12.467 --> 45:21.196
independent of whether they'd make people sick, independent of whether they would transmit for a long time or a short time, independent of whether they're self-replicating or not, it doesn't matter.

45:23.398 --> 45:31.887
If they wanted to find gigaohm biological encoded in DNA and tell you it was spreading everywhere, they could make it and put it everywhere.

45:33.568 --> 45:34.970
They could distribute it in vapes.

45:36.517 --> 45:44.200
and it could be harmless, but everybody would test positive for gigaohm biological written in DNA because they put it in the vapes.

45:44.961 --> 45:48.482
And because DNA is so stable, it would be there and it would last.

45:50.083 --> 45:52.604
So the signal that they wanted to find could be created.

45:52.644 --> 45:54.184
They could tell you it was whatever they want.

45:54.224 --> 46:01.207
The test could test for gigaohm biological written in DNA and they could tell you it was a new coronavirus and they were testing for the RDRP.

46:01.567 --> 46:02.208
How would you know?

46:02.248 --> 46:03.068
Do you work at Abbott?

46:04.209 --> 46:05.770
Do you work at the testing facility?

46:05.790 --> 46:08.872
So how do you know what they're really testing for when the thing turns pink?

46:13.715 --> 46:14.696
Did you make the primers?

46:14.736 --> 46:19.259
Do you even know if the primers that they say are in there are in there or are they primers that they wanted you to use?

46:25.503 --> 46:33.568
I'm sorry, but at some point in time, these people are gonna have to step out of the spotlight and they're gonna have to admit

46:35.964 --> 46:37.325
They're gonna have to admit something.

46:38.826 --> 46:47.971
Mike Eden is gonna have to admit something soon because he's not so naive as to not see the population problem.

46:48.011 --> 46:51.093
He's not so naive as to see the use of a background.

46:51.753 --> 47:01.799
He's not so naive to not know that pharmaceutical companies that make biologics can make DNA and RNA and have all the facilities to do it and had it before the pandemic.

47:02.745 --> 47:04.527
The biologics are harder to make.

47:04.867 --> 47:06.028
He could explain that.

47:12.054 --> 47:14.036
And they will promise to fix all of these things.

47:14.116 --> 47:15.057
Mike Eden is right.

47:15.077 --> 47:20.842
But why does Mike Eden get promoted by Paul Alexander when we have been saying it for months and months now?

47:23.144 --> 47:26.848
Why is Paul Alexander promoting a foreigner in America?

47:31.411 --> 47:34.112
I think you know the answer, and I think Paul knows the answer too.

47:34.132 --> 47:39.853
If they're safe and effective, you should go get yours, because that's not what the news media should be doing.

47:40.193 --> 47:51.196
They should be reporting on what's actually happening and pointing out to people that side effects do occur, and that they should always, before getting any medical intervention, understand the risks and the benefits.

47:51.616 --> 48:04.162
Now, for all vaccines, it turns out that the, except in extremely rare cases, like, you know, maybe this one might have been a case, but I really don't think so.

48:05.223 --> 48:13.747
In pretty much every case I know about, the benefits of vaccination never outweigh the risks, and people should always be refusing vaccination.

48:13.767 --> 48:16.368
We've been telling people that for a long time.

48:16.388 --> 48:19.510
Okay, so you do agree that nobody should ever take another vaccine.

48:21.151 --> 48:25.754
No, people should not take any of the vaccines that are currently approved.

48:26.134 --> 48:31.737
There may be a time, Stu, in five years from now that they actually have a safe vaccine.

48:32.238 --> 48:35.660
That is it, okay?

48:37.181 --> 48:40.182
There may be a time in five years where they have a vaccine.

48:40.222 --> 48:41.543
So Mike Eden is correct.

48:42.664 --> 48:43.705
Mike Eden is correct.

48:43.745 --> 48:47.687
These people are offering a fake solution.

48:59.294 --> 49:03.116
But today, I feel like I need to call out Mike Eden, so I'm going to do it.

49:04.278 --> 49:15.145
And the way that I'm going to do it is I'm going to suggest to you that Mike Eden could have told you all about this video and all about its contents and more, including anion exchange chromatography.

49:15.485 --> 49:22.049
He could have told you that biologics, which are made by pharmaceutical companies around the world before and after the pandemic,

49:22.589 --> 49:28.636
that include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies whose intellectual property was drastically changed.

49:28.656 --> 49:37.626
The landscape of pharmaceutical value in patents was changed drastically at the start of the pandemic due to the ruling of the U.S.

49:37.666 --> 49:43.233
Supreme Court about what patents on antibodies could be enforced.

49:46.035 --> 49:57.231
And so Mike Eden knows all of this stuff because he told you himself, he is a pharmaceutical executive who sold his spinoff company to Pfizer before the pandemic.

49:57.551 --> 49:59.214
He knows how this stuff works.

50:01.107 --> 50:27.155
And so Mike Eden, the guy who says he's sure that they designed the transfections to make people not be able to have babies, is also completely unable to have taught you anything about biologics manufacture, almost in the same way that Brian Artis, while pretending to tell us about biologics manufacture, has never bothered to point out that biologics, like venom, are manufactured by making cDNAs and then mRNA and then the protein.

50:28.325 --> 50:29.986
Just conveniently left that out.

50:30.367 --> 50:31.107
Stop lying.

50:33.109 --> 50:35.010
So let's watch a video together, shall we?

50:35.030 --> 50:38.793
Is this the one?

50:39.514 --> 50:39.774
Yes.

50:41.175 --> 50:42.836
This video is from Amgen.

50:43.997 --> 50:46.539
It's available on YouTube, and it's about 11 years old.

50:47.219 --> 50:54.305
So I'm sure nothing in this video will be surprising, and everybody will be like, oh, wow, I already knew that.

50:58.211 --> 51:08.581
The Challenges in Manufacturing Biologics A key objective in medicine is to improve patients' health while ensuring their safety.

51:09.522 --> 51:16.609
One breakthrough that has revolutionized medicine and helped meet this objective is the development of a newer type of drugs called biologics.

51:17.330 --> 51:21.153
More than 200 biologics have benefited millions of patients worldwide.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.041
biologics are very complex molecules.

51:24.662 --> 51:29.745
Because of this, each step in their manufacturing requires rigorous quality control and testing.

51:30.566 --> 51:35.289
Now, first of all, I'd like you to remind you if you haven't seen biology 101 from yesterday, please watch it.

51:35.329 --> 51:39.671
We are now we have added to the reading list.

51:41.443 --> 51:48.266
a wonderful book which is called What is Life by Erwin Schroeder, and we read the first part of it.

51:48.846 --> 52:09.054
And one of the ideas that's here that we're going to revisit over and over in Biology 101 is the idea of a periodic crystal being the subject in general of physics and chemistry, and an aperiodic crystal being a concept to better describe the phenomenon that occur in life.

52:11.144 --> 52:13.126
to ensure their efficacy and safety.

52:14.567 --> 52:24.814
Prior to the development of biologics, most drugs were composed of small molecules, which are developed in laboratories by using chemical building blocks that are bound together in discrete chemical steps.

52:25.815 --> 52:32.880
There could be multiple methods to manufacture them, allowing the drugs to be duplicated and sold by multiple companies when patents expire.

52:33.980 --> 52:38.744
Small molecule drugs include most drugs taken orally, in addition to some given by injection.

52:40.398 --> 52:47.062
So this is important because they're going to establish what generic drugs are and what they are, are these small molecules.

52:47.622 --> 52:56.587
You learn how to make them, you know, like brewing beer, and then you can give that, you know, that recipe to somebody else and they can brew the same beer.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.449
And so then there's now generic small molecules, right?

53:00.689 --> 53:09.798
Contrast, biologics are usually proteins, can be up to 1,000 times as large as small molecule drugs, and are given by injection or infusion.

53:10.659 --> 53:14.543
Because of their complexity, biologics must be manufactured in living cells.

53:16.965 --> 53:21.970
The initial step in developing a biologic is inserting the DNA that codes for it into cells.

53:23.592 --> 53:24.273
What's that called?

53:25.242 --> 53:28.366
Transformation, if they use a virus, it's called transformation.

53:28.406 --> 53:38.277
If they use naked DNA, I think you can still call it transfection, but we would have to talk to somebody like Robert Malone, who was around when they defined these words back in the 70s and 80s.

53:45.507 --> 53:50.652
Once the DNA is inside the cells, it uses the cell's machinery to transcribe and translate.

53:51.073 --> 54:01.623
So what's happening there is an RNA dependent, or sorry, an RNA polymerase is taking the DNA and opening it up and manufacturing an mRNA.

54:01.663 --> 54:04.946
And then that will be out of the nucleus to the ribosome.

54:04.966 --> 54:07.008
Played the DNA message into the biologic.

54:09.815 --> 54:14.939
So that's the ribosome there on the edge of what is supposed to be the endoplasmic reticulum.

54:14.979 --> 54:20.924
And so then the RNA apparently goes in from the outside and then the protein forms on the inside.

54:20.944 --> 54:25.087
As the biologic is made, the cells fold it into its functionally active structure.

54:28.049 --> 54:31.652
And the biologic is transported to a cellular organelle called a Golgi body.

54:33.547 --> 54:40.656
Within the Golgi body, specific chemical groups are added, such as sugar groups, to ensure the biologic functions as intended.

54:41.917 --> 54:46.763
If a group is added incorrectly, this can alter the biologic's physiologic effects.

54:47.546 --> 54:55.033
After post-translational modifications are completed, the biologic is isolated from the culture system and the selection process can begin.

54:55.253 --> 55:06.264
And the isolation process includes what is called anion exchange chromatography, where all the RNA and DNA from these processes can be separated from the protein biologic.

55:07.569 --> 55:19.836
And all of these people, Kevin McKernan, Jessica Rose, Meryl Nass, Robert Malone, anybody that's worked in industry or adjacent to that knows that this is the most expensive step in the process.

55:19.876 --> 55:36.946
Mike Eden must know that the most expensive process of manufacture of a biologic is the separation of these endotoxins and these DNA and these RNA from the manufacturing process from the protein that you intend to inject intramuscularly or by IV.

55:39.062 --> 55:41.444
You don't want a bunch of bacterial endotoxins.

55:41.464 --> 55:43.366
You don't want a bunch of DNA in there.

55:43.466 --> 55:45.007
So you have to clean it out.

55:45.067 --> 55:49.451
And all of these people before the pandemic already knew this.

55:51.553 --> 55:53.214
Mike Eden had to know this.

55:58.478 --> 56:06.225
During the selection process, the cells that produce the biologic product most effectively are identified and expanded to manufacture the biologic drug.

56:07.861 --> 56:11.702
This is called the cell line, which is unique to each manufacturer.

56:12.502 --> 56:23.465
This cell line is the source of all future drug product and is then grown in large bioreactors where the growth and metabolic activity of the biologic are carefully monitored in all stages.

56:23.605 --> 56:31.687
It seems like they have a lot of the infrastructure they would need already to make all of the mRNA or DNA that they would ever want to find anywhere they wanted to put it.

56:32.607 --> 56:34.307
Those things back there look big enough.

56:34.367 --> 56:36.708
That big steel thing right there looks pretty good size.

56:39.104 --> 56:42.745
It's definitely not some undergraduate in their garage, right?

56:42.785 --> 56:47.187
With some eBay equipment like Robert Malone said is threatening us in the future.

56:48.708 --> 56:55.250
Robert Malone actually said that in front of some parliament members in the UK like a year ago or so.

56:56.070 --> 56:58.371
That we didn't need to worry about this, this is nothing.

56:59.452 --> 57:07.435
But we need to worry about our undergraduates in their garage with nefarious ideas about making gain of function proteins or gain of function viruses

57:08.300 --> 57:19.291
stop lying brian artist is saying they're making venom like this they make venom until the biologic is collected for purification

57:22.250 --> 57:27.857
The production process is highly controlled and involves many steps that need to be carefully executed.

57:28.597 --> 57:35.285
These steps ensure that the three-dimensional structure of the biologic is replicated precisely each time a new lot is produced.

57:35.305 --> 57:41.773
Does anyone else find the small sounds of a watch beeping in the background in this video super annoying?

57:45.017 --> 57:49.561
Different raw material sources and process variability can affect product quality.

57:50.081 --> 57:59.168
Isn't that weird that even the source of their materials and the particular place that they get their raw materials from could affect the biologic?

58:00.709 --> 58:03.011
Oh my goodness, that sounds complicated.

58:06.385 --> 58:16.334
Raw materials and process controls will differ among manufacturers, and consequently, the same biologic manufactured by two different companies is likely to be different.

58:17.916 --> 58:21.739
This is the reason why such drugs are called biosimilars and not generics.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.162
They are similar, but not the same.

58:24.983 --> 58:30.408
Accordingly, a separate regulatory pathway has been developed for them by various health authorities around the world.

58:31.931 --> 58:32.371
Oh my gosh.

58:32.432 --> 58:40.656
Because biologics and biosimilars may have slight differences, as a physician, I believe that doctors should know as... I'm not making that beeping noise.

58:40.716 --> 58:42.036
They are making that beeping noise.

58:42.416 --> 58:44.317
Oh my gosh, there's a flag behind him.

58:45.038 --> 58:46.098
Can you believe this?

58:47.939 --> 58:49.100
Biosimilars.

58:49.800 --> 58:55.043
And conveniently, there's a whole other regulation thing for the biosimilar deals.

58:56.024 --> 58:59.270
I wonder if mRNA vaccines were considered biosimilars.

58:59.891 --> 59:05.862
I wonder if the adenovirus things are considered biosimilars and fall under a different regulatory.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.207
Isn't that interesting, right?

59:08.993 --> 59:13.874
Ooh, and it makes it easier for everybody to have the same intellectual property.

59:14.374 --> 59:31.717
Then we can have intellectual property also on the methodologies, you know, like the special way that we make the lipid nanoparticles come together with the mRNA so that people like Peter Cullis can be give credit for or blamed for having told us that the, oh my gosh, it is gross.

59:34.298 --> 59:34.758
This is a,

59:35.708 --> 59:36.168
11-year-old video.

59:36.188 --> 59:36.549
I'm sorry, what?

59:36.569 --> 59:37.309
Even small differences in what?

59:37.450 --> 59:37.770
Sorry, what?

01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:11.803
Extra care is needed for biologics because even small variations in their complex structure may contribute to immune reactions in patients.

01:00:12.663 --> 01:00:19.807
These reactions occur when a patient's immune system identifies a substance as foreign and targets it for removal.

01:00:22.908 --> 01:00:24.169
Wait, how would that happen?

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:26.690
Isn't that the intention of transfection?

01:00:28.769 --> 01:00:34.816
Didn't they just tell us that the whole thing of transfection is that they would recognize the protein and remove it?

01:00:35.657 --> 01:00:39.141
Now this guy's telling me that that's not a really good idea for biologics.

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:40.603
We don't really want that for biologics.

01:00:40.663 --> 01:00:42.625
What in the hell is going on here?

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:58.294
extra care is needed for biologics because even small variations in their complex structure may contribute to immune reactions in patients.

01:00:58.394 --> 01:01:07.462
What about the small changes in the complex structure of the spike protein when our body makes it in different tissues?

01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:18.387
He's telling you that the cell line that they chose will determine the biosimilarities here, and we can't call them the same because they're not.

01:01:18.447 --> 01:01:28.813
Because the raw materials that we start with matter, the cell line that we start with matter, and small variations in the production of the biologic could result in immune responses that we don't want.

01:01:29.173 --> 01:01:33.696
And yet with the mRNA transfection of healthy humans, they don't give a shit about that.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.561
Because our bodies are the vaccine factory.

01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:39.761
Isn't that handy?

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:41.062
Stop lying!

01:01:43.522 --> 01:01:50.625
These reactions occur when a patient's immune system identifies a substance as foreign and targets it for removal.

01:01:51.245 --> 01:01:54.966
These immune reactions may lead to serious health complications.

01:01:55.346 --> 01:01:57.987
Oh, serious health complications.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:58.867
But never mind.

01:01:58.907 --> 01:02:04.029
We'll let your body be the vaccine factory so that all those vats aren't needed.

01:02:05.902 --> 01:02:08.484
And so all this quality control isn't needed.

01:02:09.885 --> 01:02:12.347
We'll just let any cell in your body make this stuff.

01:02:12.387 --> 01:02:13.087
Who cares?

01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:18.031
Only when they manufacture it in their big steel bins.

01:02:18.131 --> 01:02:28.619
Only when they manufacture it in their big, big chromatography columns is it important for the bio, you know, whatever to be good and pure.

01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:34.644
So don't you see that transfection just avoids all these problems?

01:02:35.925 --> 01:02:42.927
All these purification problems and safety controls and chemical testing and screening for purity.

01:02:43.207 --> 01:02:43.887
Come on!

01:02:45.508 --> 01:02:54.390
We're wasting millions of dollars producing biologics when we could just leave all the production up to your body by transfecting you.

01:02:58.351 --> 01:03:14.135
This is before the pandemic where they're telling you why biologics are so expensive and why almost nobody's insurance will pay for them and why pharmaceutical companies are dealing with these like table chips in a poker game because they're so valuable, the intellectual property.

01:03:14.155 --> 01:03:17.796
And then suddenly at the start of the pandemic, the Supreme Court says,

01:03:21.184 --> 01:03:24.285
Sorry, all those things that you said were valuable, they're not really valuable.

01:03:24.325 --> 01:03:27.946
I don't think they'll stand up in court because the biology doesn't stand up in court anymore.

01:03:28.546 --> 01:03:29.307
Wow.

01:03:31.347 --> 01:03:32.188
Isn't that weird?

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:41.051
So now all of a sudden, investing in these biologics and all these big steel tubs and all these clean rooms and all these people is really a waste of money.

01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:45.392
Because we can't enforce our patent anyway.

01:03:48.615 --> 01:03:52.076
Concerns over these complications have arisen in some products.

01:03:52.617 --> 01:04:03.681
To help avoid problems, it's important for a manufacturer to have a deep institutional knowledge, safe check systems, and best practices for large-scale production of these biologics.

01:04:04.562 --> 01:04:11.744
That experience has helped us at Amgen respond... Or you could just distribute placebo and say you're able to make large quantities.

01:04:11.784 --> 01:04:13.525
That would also work great now, wouldn't it?

01:04:13.665 --> 01:04:17.587
...quickly to safety issues and prevent product shortages for patients.

01:04:18.294 --> 01:04:42.499
products shortages since their introduction approximately 30 years ago biologics have helped more than 30 years ago you mean we've been making this stuff for 40 years are you telling me that we've been making biologics for 40 years using recombinant dna and rna are you telling me that these people in the human genome project didn't really do anything special uh-oh than 325 million patients worldwide

01:04:47.901 --> 01:04:52.863
Manufacturing a safe and effective biologic medicine requires tremendous effort and vigilance.

01:04:53.444 --> 01:04:54.424
Every step is critical.

01:04:55.785 --> 01:05:02.368
It is this rigorous commitment to quality that helps ensure that each dose is both effective and safe for patients.

01:05:02.388 --> 01:05:06.490
2012, ladies and gentlemen, 12 years ago.

01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:17.937
I'm not even really sure what to say about that other than I told you.

01:05:20.777 --> 01:05:24.959
I'm not even really sure what to say about that other than I told you.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:40.503
I am very serious when I say that we need to have a new consensus about the fact that the vaccine schedule in the USA was a criminal enterprise and people like Mary Holland could have said that in 2017, but they didn't.

01:05:43.342 --> 01:05:49.544
Mary Holland could have said that in 2015 when she was on the Democracy Now program against Paul Offit.

01:05:49.564 --> 01:05:53.965
She could have just said that the whole vaccine schedule is criminal because there's no strict liability.

01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:56.986
Do you know why she could have said that in 2015?

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.607
Because in 2015, she was also a lawyer.

01:06:04.248 --> 01:06:05.889
Just like she remains a lawyer now.

01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:08.130
In 2015, Aaron Seary was a lawyer too.

01:06:13.018 --> 01:06:24.334
The only lawyer that I know that has said the vaccine schedule is criminal is named, shoot, now I can't think of his name.

01:06:25.095 --> 01:06:26.117
I'll come up with it in a minute.

01:06:27.674 --> 01:06:31.237
But I think he used to work for a CHD, but he doesn't work for CHD any longer.

01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:32.217
Ralph Hazlehorst is his name.

01:06:32.237 --> 01:06:33.378
He's the only one that I know who's ever said it.

01:06:46.427 --> 01:07:01.577
uh is like brett weinstein's wife she didn't say that the vaccine schedule she thinks the vaccine schedule is great we just need safe ones and she wouldn't call she said the transfection we should call it transfection instead of a vaccine because the the efficacy fades

01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:06.663
Not because transfection is the right name for it, but because the efficacy fades.

01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:17.535
And she told you that on her podcast one year or more, probably a year and a half after I told her and her husband and explained the biology of it on Signal in 2021 or 2020 even.

01:07:21.178 --> 01:07:29.765
That's why I'm going to hammer on Brett and his wife until they are off the internet or until GigaOM Biological is self-sustaining.

01:07:29.825 --> 01:07:34.749
Right now, GigaOM Biological is paid for by a couple people and my credit card.

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:35.209
That's it.

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:42.755
And Mark Kulak shouldn't be giving me $100 a month for me to pay my bills, but he is because that's how this show runs.

01:07:45.265 --> 01:07:54.590
Jeff from Earth in Canada, who makes the clips on PeerTube, shouldn't also be donating massive amounts of money to my family.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.231
It just shouldn't be, but that's the way it is.

01:07:56.271 --> 01:08:04.055
There are just a few people who are floating this boat, like Simon, and Steven, or Stefan, and Greg, and Jeff.

01:08:05.756 --> 01:08:06.857
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.338
is not a subscriber for $10 a month.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:15.862
You know, Jessica Rose isn't a subscriber for $10 a month.

01:08:15.962 --> 01:08:19.423
Nobody of these people is a subscriber for $10 a month.

01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:27.945
Heck, you know, even Malik, when he had me, you know, there was a cool show, the cool show on Rumble, K-U-W-L.

01:08:28.445 --> 01:08:30.826
That guy did an interview for me.

01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:34.987
We got connected through G. Edward Griffin and the red pill thing.

01:08:35.607 --> 01:08:39.148
And after I did an interview with him, about an hour later,

01:08:40.441 --> 01:08:46.089
He gave me the link to where he was gonna post the video and he donated $50 to Gigaohm Biological.

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:54.281
The Cool Show, K-U-W-L, the only person to ever interview me and then also donate.

01:08:54.621 --> 01:08:56.364
No one else has ever done it.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.131
That's how bad this is right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:02.651
It is very, very bad.

01:09:02.711 --> 01:09:27.175
When Mark Kulak is paying for my lunch, my kids' lunch, and some people from Canada and California and across the ocean are the only people that are keeping this stream afloat, along with the 140 people scrolling over there that give some amount that's all important.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:33.841
But I don't have a substack with thousands of subscribers that pay like Robert Malone does.

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:41.462
I don't have a substack with thousands of subscribers that pay like Jessica Rose does, where those people have not lost anything.

01:09:42.723 --> 01:09:45.743
Was Jessica Rose trying to get tenure somewhere that I missed?

01:09:47.463 --> 01:09:50.784
Was Robert Malone working somewhere that I missed?

01:09:50.824 --> 01:09:54.085
Did he lose some contracts with DITRA that weren't reported?

01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:55.465
No.

01:09:57.256 --> 01:10:05.758
These people are dishonorably misleading the young about what they've suffered and their role in this.

01:10:05.838 --> 01:10:15.941
They have all participated in this slow roll to the truth, this controlled demolition of America, and that's the reason why none of these people will talk about any of these things.

01:10:17.441 --> 01:10:21.182
This list will remain untouched by these people.

01:10:22.924 --> 01:10:25.349
and ignored because that's all they can do at this stage.

01:10:25.369 --> 01:10:27.133
That's why they also have to ignore Mark.

01:10:27.193 --> 01:10:34.388
They can't talk to you about what Mark's doing right now because if they do, this whole house of cards will fall apart.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.903
just like they can't talk to you about what we're doing here in Biology 101 or what we just did today.

01:10:41.464 --> 01:10:46.387
Because what we did today is going to be so inconvenient that either one of two things can happen.

01:10:46.407 --> 01:10:50.390
Either Mike Eden can say, wow, you know what, Jonathan Cooley's right.

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.091
And the last show that he did, wow, I should have known better.

01:10:53.672 --> 01:10:54.152
He's right.

01:10:54.272 --> 01:10:55.753
I knew all about biologics.

01:10:55.813 --> 01:10:56.714
I knew how they were made.

01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:57.735
I should have seen this.

01:10:57.815 --> 01:10:58.715
What is wrong with me?

01:10:59.276 --> 01:11:03.659
Of course, transfection and transformation in cell culture is all that virology really is.

01:11:05.589 --> 01:11:06.530
but he's not going to do that.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:14.776
I almost guarantee you, he's not going to send me an email or Paul Alexander's not going to send me an email and say, Oh my gosh, I should have promoted you.

01:11:17.257 --> 01:11:25.984
The complete ignoring of the truth that Mark is bringing to the table, that I'm bringing to the table, that Scott Schar is bringing to the table, that Joe Marshall are bringing to the table.

01:11:26.024 --> 01:11:27.525
They are going to ignore them.

01:11:28.426 --> 01:11:32.849
That Uwe Altschner in Germany is bringing to the table.

01:11:32.869 --> 01:11:34.350
They are ignoring all of us.

01:11:36.909 --> 01:11:49.561
and they will continue to do it because they don't want you to get to these big ideas about RNA can't pandemic or that the idea that endemicity versus a background that was already there because we don't have any data from 2020 is impossible.

01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:58.429
That means that all of these people could have explained this by now, but haven't just like they could have explained that the increase in all cause mortality was expected.

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:18.413
And they're all getting away with it because they won't talk about 2020 and that they could have known in 2020 about biologics manufacture, about transfection and transformation because it was on their CV and about the coming increase in all cause mortality because of the size of difference between families in the after World War II and families now.

01:12:19.074 --> 01:12:21.776
The one child policy in China versus before it.

01:12:22.476 --> 01:12:25.739
They're all the same problem that all these countries had to solve.

01:12:26.119 --> 01:12:28.421
And that's why all these people have to be in on it.

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:32.924
So we need a new consensus, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:32.944 --> 01:12:35.969
We need people to understand this biology, and I hope you'll help me do it.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:40.736
And if you want to help, please go to gigahomebiological.com and find a way to support.

01:12:41.505 --> 01:12:53.673
and otherwise share everything that you can find on stream.gigaohm.bio and everything that you see Mark Kulak tweet, for example, retweet it because he only puts stuff on X when it's necessary.

01:12:54.594 --> 01:12:57.156
And I'm going to move toward that model more and more.

01:12:57.216 --> 01:13:01.719
But right now, I still feel like X is worth trying to burn down, so to speak.

01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:04.200
And so I go there with a lot of sarcasm and a lot of

01:13:06.602 --> 01:13:08.423
A lot of sharp tongue, and I don't care.

01:13:09.023 --> 01:13:16.328
If you follow me there, just understand that that's me trying to push back against that military program and nothing more.

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:21.911
Thank you very much for joining me, and I'll see you guys again... Yes, I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

01:15:14.665 --> 01:15:28.121
I'm gonna talk to Mark this afternoon and see what Mark's plans are, when he's gonna stream, and I might do, after lunch, a catch-up on the stats thing and put another one of those episodes out.

01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:28.581
We'll see.

01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:30.804
Otherwise, I'll definitely see you tomorrow.
