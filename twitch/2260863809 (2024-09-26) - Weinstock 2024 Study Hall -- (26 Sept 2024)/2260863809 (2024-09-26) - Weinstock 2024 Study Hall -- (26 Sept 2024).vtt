WEBVTT

01:08.297 --> 01:16.100
We have spent more than $2 billion on the greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.

01:17.420 --> 01:28.084
But the greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise, its secrecy, or its cost, but the achievement of scientific brains in making it work.

01:29.565 --> 01:36.567
And hardly less marvelous has been the capacity of industry to design and of labor to operate

01:37.216 --> 01:41.738
the machines and methods to do things never done before.

01:42.958 --> 01:54.363
Both science and industry work together under the direction of the United States Army, which achieved a unique success in an amazingly short time.

01:55.784 --> 02:01.206
It is doubtful if such another combination could be got together in the world.

02:02.167 --> 02:05.088
What has been done is the greatest achievement

02:05.760 --> 02:08.062
of organized science in history.

02:31.052 --> 02:55.036
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know, but I know for sure

02:55.424 --> 03:12.883
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

03:14.970 --> 03:21.716
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

03:22.136 --> 03:25.179
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

03:25.259 --> 03:34.707
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

03:34.727 --> 03:41.333
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:52.302 --> 03:56.567
Whoa, Albert and Pamela met in Harlem over the weekend.

03:56.667 --> 04:01.173
What a spectacular connection that is to hear about.

04:01.233 --> 04:03.235
I get little goosebumps thinking about that.

04:03.275 --> 04:05.057
Thanks for sharing that with me.

04:05.318 --> 04:07.741
That's absolutely fabulous.

04:21.135 --> 04:21.816
do do

04:49.525 --> 04:49.686
you

05:37.529 --> 05:37.589
you

07:31.687 --> 07:31.827
do

09:31.414 --> 09:31.794
so so

10:08.501 --> 10:10.062
My throat still hurts a little bit.

10:10.102 --> 10:13.424
Ruby is doing pretty darn well for what she went through.

10:13.464 --> 10:21.728
She's still probably recovering a little bit with weight and everything, but temperament-wise and everything, she's doing 10,000 times better.

10:33.607 --> 10:54.448
yeah that's for sure go ruby go go ruby go i think everybody is feeling like uh go go gadget here i'm running around in circles uh it's been five years of social media running around in circles like that watching fancy computer generated cartoons that are supposed to give us some idea of what

10:55.109 --> 11:03.155
reality is looking at our own little curated window of artificial reality in social media.

11:04.856 --> 11:16.824
I'm afraid we're surrendering a new level of power to these charlatans as we engage in this pseudo free speech on social media and we've really really got to make sure

11:17.685 --> 11:31.580
that we don't miss this last, maybe last opportunity to take back the power from these charlatans and not, more importantly, not allow our children to inherit the same charlatans and their descendants.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.805
It sounds spooky, but I think it really comes down to some pretty simple ideas.

11:37.586 --> 11:42.529
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

11:43.249 --> 11:49.633
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

11:50.633 --> 11:55.716
I need people to understand that the mystery virus does not equal all the excess deaths.

11:55.796 --> 12:02.360
In fact, they knew these excess deaths were coming, and they swept a few extra together in order to create this illusion.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.241
If you look at it under a real scale,

12:04.841 --> 12:13.166
where between 70,000 and 50,000 people die every week in America, you can see that this mystery virus is not equal to the excess deaths.

12:13.826 --> 12:22.952
But instead it is, can be explained by a series of lies and misdirection that led to the murder of perhaps thousands of Americans.

12:23.032 --> 12:28.155
And then these murders were misconstrued as evidence of a spreading pathogen.

12:29.015 --> 12:33.458
And that was used around the English speaking, in fact, around the entire world.

12:34.591 --> 12:44.935
And within the context of our own legal system, despite 10 years of this being a pseudo issue, no one can seem to tie the two words strict liability together.

12:44.995 --> 12:53.898
No one seems to mention what role the Seventh Amendment might play in interpreting some of these legislative traps that we are in.

12:54.018 --> 12:57.540
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

13:00.666 --> 13:04.547
I think we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

13:04.567 --> 13:17.771
I think we need a new consensus about what academic biologists and academic doctors and any bench biologists could have known if they would have just done the due diligence that a normal adult would do.

13:19.092 --> 13:27.174
And any biologist can actually work hard enough on PubMed to prove to themselves that RNA cannot pandemic.

13:27.194 --> 13:28.455
There's only a few papers

13:29.315 --> 13:43.710
that might argue against this and it really um if you take away the papers that talk about remdesivir you're left with like one and that's the reality of it uh that's the reality that none of these people want to discuss that's why they went from

13:44.991 --> 13:51.314
kind of in small groups paying attention to me, to eventually all of them ignoring me.

13:51.374 --> 13:56.477
There's an illusion of consensus that's being sustained by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

13:57.478 --> 14:03.381
And if we don't get out of that limited spectrum of debate soon, then our children will inherit it.

14:03.461 --> 14:08.203
That's actually the kind of new totalitarianism that all of these people envision.

14:09.264 --> 14:11.505
And in fact, it's the no-sphere that

14:12.589 --> 14:18.853
Yeah, Thiel Desjardins was talking about in a book a long, long time ago, the 1930s already.

14:21.295 --> 14:35.624
And so with the help of social media, with our own acquiescence to using social media as a primary means of communication, we have surrendered essentially to this highly trained set of acolytes.

14:36.685 --> 14:40.368
And behind them, the ruling oligarchy is just quietly running the show.

14:40.408 --> 14:52.917
Every once in a while they send one of these people to a podium and they say a few words that seem to acknowledge that what the general populace is thinking on social media is acknowledged by them.

14:52.957 --> 14:54.779
But in reality, this is all a show.

14:56.843 --> 15:02.827
And the latest iteration of this show is called Rescue the Republic, and it's at jointheresistance.org.

15:02.847 --> 15:13.154
And if you go there, you can see exactly what I'm talking about, that weaponized piles of money have used their acolytes on social media, some of them being these people, many of them being these people.

15:13.915 --> 15:20.700
And it is these people who have convinced us what to argue about when and with whom to argue about these things.

15:21.650 --> 15:35.636
And it is not by accident that these people have assembled now because it is their continuing role to frame an argument that will accept the ruler's narrative by default.

15:36.577 --> 15:41.519
And we will continue to be governed by this theater until we take back the

15:42.557 --> 15:44.079
the sort of assent to do it.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.363
We take back the consent.

15:46.443 --> 15:49.667
We have to take back control of social media somehow.

15:49.747 --> 15:55.255
I mean, I can envision open source type social media that's decentralized, federalized.

15:57.386 --> 15:59.527
that everybody could have their own instance of.

16:00.547 --> 16:03.288
I can envision a lot of interesting ways to do it.

16:03.328 --> 16:04.428
Look at our PeerTube.

16:04.928 --> 16:06.049
You don't have to sign in.

16:07.449 --> 16:08.609
Everybody can access it.

16:08.649 --> 16:12.031
There's no algorithm that's going to throw ads your way.

16:12.111 --> 16:14.451
There's no none of that at PeerTube.

16:15.091 --> 16:21.413
In case you're wondering who you're listening to, you're listening to a used to be career academic looking for tenure.

16:21.433 --> 16:22.094
You can find

16:23.834 --> 16:52.352
the methodology, the papers that I've been involved in on PubMed using my last name C-O-U-E-Y dash J-J, and all of those papers that come up will show you the rather mediocre scientific record that I have relative to some of these heroes in the NIH and people who really succeed at a career in academia will have two or three times the papers that I have there over that.

16:53.432 --> 16:54.914
roughly 20 year span.

16:55.995 --> 17:12.450
If you want to know more about what has happened to me over the last 20 or so months and then more all the way back to 2020 and all the coinkydinks with people that have occurred there is a stream a few days ago where I cover this list where we are now.

17:13.351 --> 17:16.273
I do think it's kind of important to think about these things because

17:17.254 --> 17:36.059
We have a situation here where we have, let's say, a number of people that are posing as patriots and as conservative icons that supposedly had principles when we needed principles.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.440
And I kind of beg to differ.

17:39.941 --> 17:43.742
And so in that vein, I'm kind of looking to

17:45.359 --> 17:47.140
I don't know, I'm trying to keep working here.

17:47.160 --> 17:53.581
I know that we were, we are planning to do a regular biology and uncertainty course.

17:54.782 --> 18:00.783
But some of these things, because they're so present and they're so now, they need to be addressed now.

18:01.043 --> 18:07.865
And so I do feel like it's really important to address some of these things today.

18:08.266 --> 18:11.286
And so that's why I'm doing a, oh, I forgot to change that one.

18:11.446 --> 18:13.007
I'm going to change that one right now.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.226
So I hope everybody's doing okay.

18:16.326 --> 18:24.771
I hope you are also still following Mark Kulak, Mark Hucytonic ITS.

18:27.672 --> 18:31.254
He's done some really good stuff over the last few days.

18:31.794 --> 18:35.496
And I think it's, wait, wait, we're not Weinstein, Weinstock.

18:39.278 --> 18:40.119
Make it a little bigger.

18:42.546 --> 18:43.907
And then we'll resume the show.

18:45.008 --> 18:46.570
So yeah, that's the plan.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.052
We're going to look at a video promoting this.

18:49.072 --> 18:50.313
There were a couple, actually.

18:50.353 --> 18:51.574
We could also look at one.

18:52.295 --> 18:54.597
I'm not sure if I have that one in the folder.

18:54.617 --> 18:55.698
Let me just check quick.

18:55.878 --> 18:56.579
Sorry about that.

18:57.079 --> 19:00.642
You can hear the basketball in the background.

19:01.457 --> 19:02.538
Obviously that's not me.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.960
Come on, load it up already.

19:04.980 --> 19:07.242
Let's see if I downloaded that one.

19:07.282 --> 19:08.403
Did I download that one?

19:08.444 --> 19:20.855
There's another one with Robert Kennedy, but I wanted to watch this one because it is... Yeah, I think that's it.

19:20.935 --> 19:21.796
We'll just watch this one.

19:23.388 --> 19:24.889
because it is also Jordan Peterson.

19:24.949 --> 19:29.551
And Jordan Peterson, as you know, had really no special insight into the pandemic.

19:29.631 --> 19:39.296
And he thought that we should, you know, wait, hold off judgment for a number of six months before we, you know, make any rash judgments, because it could have been a heck of a lot worse than it was.

19:39.396 --> 19:40.937
And he's wearing the masks.

19:41.057 --> 19:43.718
And so, you know, we should just take the shot and get it over with.

19:44.258 --> 20:06.699
And I think it's a very significant thing to remember that none of these people had the principles or the insight to make a significant difference in the rollout of transfection, specifically in the oldest population, the one that was probably the most fragile and probably the least healthy candidates for a transfection like this.

20:07.694 --> 20:11.855
And so it's pretty extraordinary that that timing is virtually forgotten now.

20:11.915 --> 20:32.242
And that's what I feel like a lot of my work is really, you know, bent on doing, is trying to bring people back to this idea that if we don't talk about 2021 and 2020, and how these people's role, how these people's principles, how these people's outlook, what the story they were telling at that time was,

20:33.382 --> 20:39.844
and we don't scrutinize it carefully enough, we are going to miss some very big signals that these people were put in place.

20:40.844 --> 21:00.990
That was the name of the show yesterday that some people thought Putin was what I was talking about, but no, these people were put in place and they're put in place because there was already an expected to be an increase in all cause mortality because we have a population pyramid with this little bump of a lot of kids that were born

21:02.515 --> 21:04.496
around the time after World War II.

21:04.536 --> 21:10.720
So that's about a decade or so of increased all-cause mortality that is not a cause for alarm.

21:11.140 --> 21:26.109
It might be a cause to be investing in funeral businesses or in crematoriums or in caskets and plots in cemeteries, but it's not a reason to panic.

21:26.169 --> 21:27.409
It's not a health crisis.

21:27.469 --> 21:27.910
It might be a,

21:31.378 --> 21:41.046
a boon for the old folks healthcare industry, the home healthcare industry, the old folks home healthcare industry, but they knew this was coming.

21:42.307 --> 21:49.192
There are entire buildings full of actuaries whose job it is to see these things coming.

21:49.633 --> 21:58.800
And this was one of the biggest natural phenomenon in the American population to be coming for the last 30 years.

22:00.520 --> 22:07.164
And that's why it's been talked about on news programs and in The Economist for decades already.

22:11.906 --> 22:15.228
That's what this population pyramid data will show you.

22:16.409 --> 22:29.296
And so it is with some urgency that I suggest that people need to work a little bit harder archiving whatever data is available that will most accurately

22:31.636 --> 22:36.479
catalog this expectation, the predictions that were made about this.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.781
That is important.

22:38.921 --> 22:59.795
It is so important that we don't lose that data, because in just a few more years, right, this population pyramid will have moved up, and those people will be gone, and that bump will be gone, and the signal will be lost, and its impact, its significance, and it as an opportunity will be kind of lost to history.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.575
And I don't want that.

23:01.855 --> 23:02.715
I don't want this.

23:03.456 --> 23:05.077
Maybe I should make myself a little smaller.

23:06.018 --> 23:17.385
I don't want this to be missed, that the mismanagement of this bump in the population pyramid could have potentially bankrupt many Western countries.

23:17.425 --> 23:27.732
That's the reason why in the UK, euthanasia was already kind of a thing, why it was being made a thing in the Netherlands and other places in highly advanced Europe.

23:29.707 --> 23:43.281
And so they took advantage of this opportunity to stage the pandemic so that the governing structures around the world could absorb this coming potential healthcare cost tidal wave.

23:46.383 --> 24:10.744
And because of the lack of good health in America and our lack of biological understanding, this tidal wave was potentially disastrous in the American budget, in the American system, uniquely different than in other places like Canada, where although everybody has healthcare, nobody can get it when they need it or when they want it.

24:11.690 --> 24:16.352
And so it all looks great on paper, but I mean, it's not.

24:16.832 --> 24:21.814
And so all of these Western countries have been facing the same problem.

24:21.874 --> 24:28.437
All of these Western countries have the same problem and they were able to solve it in the same way.

24:32.588 --> 24:33.869
It would be really crazy, right?

24:33.909 --> 24:41.514
If you went and looked at the Chinese population pyramid and figured out that they also had the same problem, that would be weird, right?

24:41.974 --> 24:44.216
If that happened, woo, that would be spooky.

24:45.156 --> 24:47.078
So weaponized piles of money have used this.

24:47.218 --> 24:51.341
They want you to participate in the argument that gets you to accept the bad guys.

24:51.361 --> 25:02.008
It gets you to accept their monsters so that when they reveal who the monsters are, when they take their mask off, like in every Scooby-Doo episode, you end up believing wholeheartedly

25:02.748 --> 25:05.371
in the whole story and you think you solved the mystery.

25:06.292 --> 25:20.225
And so you accept Fauci as a bad guy, you accept the diffuse proposal as real, you accept COVID as something that for extra special reasons, it's still going around the world and actually managed to become endemic.

25:21.266 --> 25:27.112
And endemic was actually the way that they characterized the worst case scenario before the pandemic and right afterward.

25:28.607 --> 25:38.293
in movies and in podcasts, which is extraordinary as we move forward to really see how it is that so many of these things are indeed that way.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.495
Let me see if I can figure out what I'm needing there.

25:41.515 --> 25:42.215
That's right.

25:43.236 --> 25:46.598
And then I need, yeah, that's it.

25:46.758 --> 25:46.998
Okay.

25:47.899 --> 25:49.600
Do I have something else that I wanted to see?

25:49.880 --> 25:50.461
That one also?

25:50.481 --> 25:51.761
Oh yeah, that also works.

25:52.082 --> 25:52.542
Okay, good.

25:53.829 --> 25:57.552
So first of all, I just want to kind of remind you of this time frame.

25:57.612 --> 25:59.554
OK, maybe I have to get this off for a second.

26:00.154 --> 26:05.118
I want to remind you of this time frame that I've been trying to account.

26:05.138 --> 26:12.324
That's the homeschooling kid in the garage doing his basketball ball handling drills, if you can hear any of that banging in there.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.187
We have a law professor.

26:16.348 --> 26:16.648
Sorry.

26:16.668 --> 26:18.950
I think this should work.

26:19.482 --> 26:27.768
We have a law professor who's a mother of an infected child who says that the MMR, some components of it are what caused her son's autism and she's sure of it.

26:29.109 --> 26:39.736
And she advocates for, you know, just better testing because there could be a genetic predisposition to this damage or it could be a particular component of the vaccines.

26:41.778 --> 26:55.268
In the same exact program, actually, we had another professor that might not even have any children saying that parents should be liable for the damage done to other people when they don't vaccinate their own children.

26:55.748 --> 27:03.754
That was one of the counterpoints to Mary Holland on this program called Democracy Now in 2015.

27:03.854 --> 27:06.056
Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense.

27:06.894 --> 27:18.504
And so she was very much out in front of this issue, so much so that in 2015, on the same program, they showed a response from Paul Offit.

27:18.804 --> 27:29.393
And at the end of this response, it's curious because the host explains that they didn't want to do this at the same time, but somehow or another, the entire dialogue of

27:30.467 --> 27:39.357
of Paul Offit seems to be responding to Mary's comments and calls Mary Holland and Miss Holland by name several times.

27:39.437 --> 27:46.164
And so although they didn't want to do a back and forth interview, neither one of them did.

27:46.704 --> 27:48.026
They allowed

27:48.459 --> 27:53.320
Paul Offit to be actually responding to the things that Mary Holland said.

27:53.380 --> 27:59.501
And it sounds like he even listened to what they recorded with her or what she said in the studio.

28:00.021 --> 28:04.422
And so he says that Mary Holland is a conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer.

28:04.462 --> 28:16.925
Now, my argument is, is that one possible interpretation of reality that I don't think is that crazy is that what you're seeing here is already the staging

28:18.001 --> 28:32.832
of what is going to be a very carefully titrated debate about the vaccine schedule and contagious disease and chronic disease and allergies and environmental toxins and bad processed foods.

28:34.513 --> 28:39.017
And they're going to roll this up all into one big health debate that over the next

28:40.572 --> 28:47.177
Let's say five years is going to bounce around between vaccines cause autism.

28:47.257 --> 28:47.918
No, they don't.

28:48.378 --> 28:52.902
It's the tripling of vaccines and putting back three things in one vaccine that does it.

28:52.922 --> 28:57.766
We need separate vaccines or it's a genetic predisposition to it.

28:59.554 --> 29:05.855
back to, you know, chronic disease in food or environmental toxins and mercury in the water and yippee-yi-yay.

29:06.575 --> 29:16.377
Like, we're another associate professor that has a vaccine patent on the schedule, says they should be liable, and calls her a conspiracy theorist by name several times.

29:16.497 --> 29:24.038
Vice President Joe Biden is spearheading a series of corporate and government partnerships aimed at speeding up the national fight against cancer.

29:24.278 --> 29:28.319
Imagine a day, perhaps, when my grandchildren had children of their own.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.661
when the threat of cancer is a distant memory.

29:32.402 --> 29:37.204
When their children can be vaccinated for cancers as routinely as we vaccinate for measles and mumps.

29:38.805 --> 29:42.507
And other cancers can be treated and cured, made into chronic conditions.

29:43.667 --> 29:46.649
Biden kicked off the effort with the- I'm sorry, did you hear?

29:48.410 --> 29:50.971
They can be cured and made into chronic conditions?

29:51.051 --> 29:51.791
Is that what he said?

29:52.512 --> 29:54.232
This is in 2016, ladies and gentlemen.

29:58.749 --> 30:06.295
Vice President Joe Biden is spearheading a series of corporate and government partnerships aimed at speeding up the national fight against cancer.

30:06.515 --> 30:19.465
Imagine a day, perhaps when my grandchildren have children of their own, when the threat of cancer is a distant memory, when their children can be vaccinated for cancers as routinely as we vaccinate for measles and mumps.

30:21.046 --> 30:24.729
And other cancers can be treated and cured, made into chronic conditions.

30:25.882 --> 30:30.486
Biden kicked off the effort with the Cancer Moonshot Summit at Howard University on Wednesday.

30:30.906 --> 30:37.272
Over 350 researchers, oncologists, data and technology experts and others were present at the summit.

30:37.552 --> 30:42.836
An additional 6,000 people will join more than 270 events around the country.

30:43.277 --> 30:50.243
The goal, to harness American innovation to identify new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer.

30:51.328 --> 30:54.690
Here are five things to know about the national cancer moonshot.

30:55.290 --> 31:01.533
Number one, the president convened a cancer task force, which he announced during the 2016 State of the Union.

31:02.494 --> 31:09.217
And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control.

31:12.219 --> 31:14.080
For the loved ones we've all lost.

31:15.285 --> 31:20.908
For the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.

31:21.208 --> 31:22.049
What do you say, Jeff?

31:23.810 --> 31:35.957
The task force is made up of the heads of multiple executive branch departments, agencies, and offices, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation.

31:36.597 --> 31:44.722
Vice President Biden became committed to leading this national fight against cancer following the 2015 death of his son, Beau, who battled brain cancer.

31:45.925 --> 31:50.207
Number two, the White House has set aside $1 billion for the initiative.

31:50.347 --> 31:53.928
We marshaled the full force of the federal government.

31:55.189 --> 31:59.711
And our goal is to make a decade's worth of progress within the next five years.

32:00.580 --> 32:09.943
While the full funding request is still being considered in Congress, the National Institutes of Health received $195 million for new cancer research in fiscal year 2016.

32:11.523 --> 32:19.066
Another $755 million in funds will be awarded to both the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration in the following fiscal year.

32:19.606 --> 32:28.869
Additionally, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are increasing their spending on cancer research and will be conducting large studies to help determine risk factors and better treatments.

32:29.571 --> 32:33.354
Risk factors for cancer would be like biomarkers, right?

32:33.474 --> 32:46.485
Like genetic markers, biomarkers, point mutations, like this kind of thing, errors, deletions, in particular genes that can be associated with the physiology of diseases.

32:47.085 --> 32:55.212
That's very interesting because there are other people in this narrative that of course are very interested in biomarkers like anybody associated with the Human Genome Project.

32:56.474 --> 33:05.983
Anybody associated with pathogens or with the immune system or with the WHO or with vaccine technologies is very interested in biomarkers.

33:07.104 --> 33:09.587
So just keep that in mind as we move forward.

33:10.871 --> 33:14.654
Number three, there's a supercomputer taking on cancer.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.718
IBM is donating access to its Watson supercomputer.

33:19.138 --> 33:20.860
Watson famous for beating human.

33:20.900 --> 33:31.709
Now, that's really interesting because that's also a very diverse set of people that thinks that computers combined with genetic technology is how biology is going to move to the next level.

33:31.749 --> 33:35.753
That goes all the way back to somebody like, I don't know, like Joshua Lederberg.

33:36.133 --> 33:38.435
But it comes all the way up to people like

33:38.876 --> 33:45.307
Robert Malone who have a computer background and who have been apparently involved in a AI sort of

33:46.539 --> 33:55.902
fueled, I don't know, drug screening domain program at the beginning of the pandemic that helped us identify so many useful repurposed drugs.

33:57.263 --> 34:00.984
And so again, I need you to see, I hope you can see, this is 2016.

34:01.024 --> 34:09.387
This is just one year after Paul Offit called Mary Holland a conspiracy theorist on Democracy Now.

34:10.902 --> 34:15.644
contestants on Jeopardy can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds.

34:16.184 --> 34:27.189
The New York Genome Center will use Watson to generate new analysis and insights to create the New York Genome Center world's most comprehensive open cancer data repository.

34:27.569 --> 34:29.110
according to a statement from the White House.

34:29.130 --> 34:35.734
Prevention and cancer vaccine development, early cancer detection, cancer immunotherapy and combination therapy, enhanced data sharing,

34:49.303 --> 35:01.746
genomic analysis of tumor and surrounding cells, pediatric cancer, as well as the establishment of the Oncology Center of Excellence under the Federal Drug Administration, which will coordinate the review of all the agency's cancer treatments.

35:03.004 --> 35:13.346
And five, the Moonshot Initiative to fast-track cancer research is named after President John F. Kennedy's 1961 commitment to land a man on the moon.

35:13.946 --> 35:19.267
Cancer will kill an estimated 600,000 Americans in 2016 alone.

35:19.747 --> 35:26.288
Globally, cancer is expected to kill an estimated 8.2 million people this year, according to the World Health Organization.

35:26.588 --> 35:30.549
The number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next two decades.

35:33.311 --> 35:40.257
And I think I'm in a position to say, without being totally naive, that we're on the cusp of breakthroughs that can get us there.

35:42.459 --> 35:46.503
On the cusp of breakthroughs is what all these futurists say all the time.

35:46.563 --> 35:51.747
That's what they said in this book, The Phenomenon of Man.

35:51.787 --> 35:54.110
That's what they said in this book, Man and His Future.

35:56.513 --> 36:00.257
These are the two books that I'm starting the Biology 101 classes with.

36:00.337 --> 36:04.441
The PDFs are posted in different places that you can find on the internet.

36:04.481 --> 36:08.886
At some point in time I'll also have them somewhere on my own archive because I think it's

36:09.591 --> 36:13.234
Those books are that important for everybody to read so you can really see where we are.

36:13.274 --> 36:15.616
So we just move one year in the future.

36:15.656 --> 36:28.166
And now we have, you know, by now, Robert Malone has been busy for nearly a decade as the private broker of vaccines and vaccine technology, you know, like fill in fit and finish technology.

36:29.167 --> 36:33.531
He associates himself with assisting with Zika and Ebola and SARS and MERS.

36:34.111 --> 36:36.092
as an outbreak specialist in 2020.

36:36.932 --> 36:45.154
And so this guy is not a humble horse farmer and homesteader, but he's a guy who is an insider since the very beginning.

36:45.194 --> 36:58.578
He has fancy black and white newspaper photos where he's already a sort of the most interesting guy in the room with his beard and whatever, and already quite the expert.

37:00.534 --> 37:08.219
So let's go up to 2019 now and see what... Thank you very much, Hop.

37:08.239 --> 37:09.259
Thanks for the invitation.

37:09.319 --> 37:11.500
See where we're talking about at the Chatham House.

37:11.540 --> 37:19.005
Now, remember at the Chatham House, this guy here is from Belgium and he was the flu commissioner in Belgium for 2009.

37:19.365 --> 37:23.887
This guy is one of the biggest virologists in the Netherlands.

37:24.007 --> 37:27.810
And he's actually the guy that we've looked at in a video where his postdoc

37:29.091 --> 37:35.717
And that would be Fauchier, the guy that supposedly enriched avian flu in ferrets in 2011.

37:35.817 --> 37:37.499
That was this guy's postdoc.

37:37.959 --> 37:43.504
He's sitting on stage actually as kind of, I guess, some kind of reinforcement that this guy's really good.

37:44.405 --> 37:52.212
And so this is the guy that we saw hold his cell phone up in the hallway of the Rotterdam Erasmus MC, where I used to work.

37:53.073 --> 37:57.315
and hold his phone up and say, wow, 35 million doses.

37:57.375 --> 38:05.499
Like they bought something after he decided that it was a positive case for the Mexican flu that some kid had brought back from vacation.

38:05.959 --> 38:06.899
And so there you go.

38:07.360 --> 38:11.321
The Dutch government bought 35,000 doses of his vaccine and he was happy.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.282
He went like this.

38:12.882 --> 38:14.443
And so that's that guy right there.

38:14.843 --> 38:18.065
And now they're talking in 2019 in January.

38:18.105 --> 38:21.967
I want you to think about how incredible it is, the kinds of things that he says.

38:22.007 --> 38:23.608
And I don't know how long we're going to go on.

38:24.148 --> 38:25.509
It's 25 minutes long.

38:25.609 --> 38:33.654
I think the most important part is the first part, but the entire presentation is on YouTube and it's about 25 minutes and it is

38:34.875 --> 38:36.256
absolutely spectacular.

38:36.296 --> 38:39.397
It is an admission as to what really happened here.

38:40.717 --> 38:49.400
And if you think about the population pyramid on the background of this, you can also understand why they knew that it would work this time.

38:50.341 --> 39:00.184
And I was asked to tell you about my experiences being the crisis manager, the flu commissioner for Belgium and highlighting the communication aspects there.

39:00.585 --> 39:03.446
These are some of my conflicts of interest over the past

39:04.486 --> 39:05.107
20 years, I guess.

39:06.347 --> 39:09.450
It all started for me at that time, well, actually in 2000.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.031
So what a weird way to start, right?

39:11.051 --> 39:13.792
He's got a conflict of interest of over 20 years.

39:14.113 --> 39:15.694
That's what it means.

39:15.794 --> 39:17.655
Conflicts of interest are not good.

39:18.255 --> 39:22.698
And if he's got a lot of them over 20 years, that's not good.

39:23.598 --> 39:27.461
You know, I don't understand how he gets away with that, but he does.

39:27.901 --> 39:31.784
For Belgium and highlighting the communication aspects there.

39:32.164 --> 39:36.708
These are some of my conflicts of interest over the past 20 years, I guess.

39:37.929 --> 39:42.252
It all started for me at that time, well, actually in 2006 when I was appointed.

39:42.272 --> 39:46.135
This is an unpaid hobby, so it's not a profession or a function, whatever.

39:46.215 --> 39:50.238
It's really a hobby, that flu commissioner thing.

39:51.038 --> 40:00.002
On April 24, 2009, that was when WHO said, OK, there will be a pandemic, and that's when the thing started.

40:00.723 --> 40:02.784
And then you have one opportunity to do it right.

40:02.804 --> 40:05.125
I mean, day one is so important.

40:06.045 --> 40:11.948
In day one, you start your communication with the press, with the people, and you have to do it.

40:11.968 --> 40:13.408
Now, he's talking day one.

40:13.448 --> 40:18.651
Now, this is kind of, again, almost like an outward-facing brochure version of the truth.

40:20.376 --> 40:47.572
just like James Giordano talking about seeding a few cases in a few places and then the rest is the internet, is kind of not quite right because his story doesn't tell you anything about how you control the narrative after that and how you can put all these people in place to create a limited spectrum of debate that everybody will fall into and solve a mystery and convince themselves that they figured it out.

40:49.614 --> 41:12.179
And what he's talking about here is also very disingenuous because he, and if you apply this model to the pandemic, you would ignore the fact that right before the pandemic, about a year before the pandemic, there was a scientific meeting which talked all about a coronavirus, the real event 201, which Mark Kulak has called the real event 201.

41:13.599 --> 41:23.665
And it is a meeting of all of these scientists that are talking about these coronaviruses and these spike proteins and these new RNA vaccine technologies.

41:25.228 --> 41:51.488
And then in October, the year following, right before the pandemic, October of 2019, of course, everybody knows that event 201 happened where all these bureaucrats, like our current director of national intelligence was there at the table talking about how the narrative needed to be controlled from day one, and especially on social media, which this guy will lament that in 2009, they just didn't really have

41:52.048 --> 41:53.610
the social media that you have today.

41:53.650 --> 41:57.934
And he really wishes they did because they could have gotten much better results.

41:59.568 --> 42:02.010
I'll just let it play for a little while longer and then we'll move on.

42:02.430 --> 42:02.651
Right.

42:02.671 --> 42:05.273
I mean, you have to go for one voice, one message.

42:05.973 --> 42:10.517
In Belgium, they chose to appoint a non-politician to do that.

42:10.537 --> 42:16.242
I mean, I have no party affiliations and that makes things a little bit, at that time at least, a little bit easier.

42:16.542 --> 42:24.629
So he claims that they chose to appoint a non-politician and since he doesn't have a party affiliation, it makes it a little easier.

42:25.708 --> 42:50.906
But he just showed you he has 20 years of conflict of interest of all the industries and interests that believe and want us to believe, more importantly, our kids to believe that pandemics are real and that you need corporations and multinational corporations at that, and government-funded multinational corporations to save you from these natural disasters.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.633
because you're not attacked politically.

42:55.994 --> 43:00.678
Majority, minority, that doesn't come into play, and that was a huge advantage.

43:00.718 --> 43:08.986
The second advantage is that you can play in Brussels the complete naive guy and get a lot more done than you would otherwise be able to do.

43:09.346 --> 43:17.334
So one voice, one message, that's the tone that you set on day one, and you have to be very transparent in that.

43:18.175 --> 43:21.780
My name is the Interminister of Commissary for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Planning.

43:22.020 --> 43:23.202
That, of course, is too long.

43:23.502 --> 43:27.869
That became the Flu Commissary and that was a lot easier.

43:28.069 --> 43:33.377
You have to be omnipresent that first day or the first days so that you attract the media attention.

43:34.197 --> 43:38.960
You make an agreement with them that you will tell them all, and if they call, you will pick up the phone.

43:39.000 --> 43:48.905
When you do that, then you can profit from these early days to get complete carpet coverage of the field, and they're not going to search for alternative voices there.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.447
And if you do that, that makes things a lot easier.

43:53.107 --> 43:58.994
And then you convey the message, and you can do that, and you should do it that way, that our country is ready for a pandemic.

43:59.014 --> 44:10.508
That is a gross overestimation for sure, but it is crucial to... It's odd that that's funny to the people in the room.

44:12.236 --> 44:14.038
And then it's odd what would happen.

44:14.198 --> 44:18.243
How many people have to laugh before everybody's laughing and half of them don't know why they're laughing.

44:18.503 --> 44:20.085
Well, to go into that pandemic.

44:21.186 --> 44:24.590
First of all, what's in the name if you talk about the pandemic, it's quite important.

44:24.990 --> 44:26.933
People are talking about the swine flu, the pandemic H1N1.

44:29.275 --> 44:33.418
2009 virus, novel influenza, 2009 AH1N1 flu.

44:33.878 --> 44:37.681
At some point it was called the North American influenza, the novel flu virus.

44:38.081 --> 44:40.343
That was way too difficult, so we called it the Mexican flu.

44:41.364 --> 44:48.850
That got me into huge trouble with the ambassador of Mexico at that time, and she was furious.

44:49.290 --> 44:50.691
Afterwards we became good friends.

44:50.791 --> 44:53.934
I still get invited to their New Year's reception every year.

44:54.694 --> 44:58.295
But people were making fun of it, and OK, that's probably unavoidable.

44:58.975 --> 45:07.578
But the fact to have a clear and recognizable name, which was easy for the lay public to understand and use, was actually quite important.

45:07.658 --> 45:08.319
It also worked.

45:08.619 --> 45:10.059
This is the word of the year of 2009.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.900
Defriending on Facebook became number one.

45:15.221 --> 45:17.702
To my big disappointment, Mexican flu was second.

45:17.862 --> 45:21.743
Defriending on Facebook became number one, and they laughed about it.

45:25.773 --> 45:27.794
and flu commissary was number six.

45:28.174 --> 45:31.676
So the term works and that makes things a lot easier.

45:32.017 --> 45:34.678
These first weeks, that's easy street.

45:35.138 --> 45:50.026
When you have no opposition and everybody needs news and they can come to you for news, you can bring quite a lot of neutral information and it is picked up and it is, well the news is brought the way you bring it.

45:50.406 --> 45:52.548
So you can only do that in the first couple of weeks.

45:52.648 --> 45:53.948
I encourage you to watch that.

45:53.988 --> 45:58.751
If you look for Chatham House and Mark Van Ronst, I'll put it in the chat.

45:59.172 --> 46:06.777
I don't have the link, but if you just do... And Mark Van Ronst.

46:07.890 --> 46:12.371
I think if you just search for those things, I think you can find it on YouTube really easy.

46:12.951 --> 46:17.592
And the point again is to remember that this hasn't been not done before.

46:17.652 --> 46:18.993
This has been done before.

46:20.733 --> 46:25.654
And so control the narrative from day one is what Marc Van Raam said.

46:25.714 --> 46:29.835
And I would suggest to you that Robert Malone was more than available in 2020.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.096
And if you looked where he was in 2020,

46:33.496 --> 46:38.078
It's very likely that he was present to control the narrative in lots of places.

46:38.118 --> 46:43.481
He admits himself that he was at the Biogen conference, which was a super spreader event.

46:44.141 --> 46:51.605
He admits that he got a phone call at the beginning of January from a CIA agent in Wuhan that told him to spin his DITRA team up.

46:52.245 --> 47:14.553
And he did that, and the DITRA team used the domain server, apparently, to screen all FDA pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals for their potential to interact with two proteins in the virus that he had used a computer simulation to create x-ray crystallography models of, which is no small feat.

47:15.653 --> 47:18.274
And he did that in a matter of weeks with a volunteer team.

47:19.332 --> 47:32.445
this vaccine broker later in 2021 would come out on Bret Weinstein's podcast and claim to be kind of a savior, a horse breeder, a homesteader, but also the inventor of all genetic vaccines.

47:32.465 --> 47:33.486
This was his idea.

47:33.506 --> 47:36.068
And he always knew it was going to need nuance.

47:37.029 --> 47:42.675
And later we would find out that he thinks that Peter Cullis kind of lied to him about whether or not that nuance was met.

47:45.666 --> 47:47.827
And we're supposed to believe that this is where we are.

47:47.887 --> 47:56.610
But I would suggest to you that these people have been put in place on purpose because they knew that this bump in the population pyramid was coming for many, many years.

47:56.690 --> 48:09.994
And so they had many, many years to carefully invest in people's reputation and position and make sure that the titration toward the truth, this is a society and a culture.

48:10.034 --> 48:11.835
You have to think of it as a cruise ship

48:12.691 --> 48:15.373
You can't turn the cruise ship very fast.

48:15.433 --> 48:24.099
If you play Dungeons and Dragons, this is like an aerial creature with the maneuverability of E, like a dragon would have a new maneuverability.

48:24.139 --> 48:26.801
You can't turn very fast in such a big thing.

48:28.042 --> 48:33.385
And so if you're going to turn something as big as a cruise ship, then you need to plan ahead.

48:35.007 --> 48:40.951
And in the event of trying to use a known

48:42.051 --> 48:57.903
Phenomenon in a culture and a society and a population of our size and a economy of our size And and you had years to to prepare for it and years to position people for it I assure you because this is for all the marbles.

48:58.363 --> 49:03.527
They definitely did it And this is just one little tiny player in it.

49:03.587 --> 49:04.948
This guy's not that important.

49:04.968 --> 49:10.532
He might not even be that important when the trump administration is elected or or if not

49:11.570 --> 49:20.178
He may only have played a fringe role for the million or so followers that he has because those million followers needed somebody.

49:23.188 --> 49:26.992
to control them, to distract them, to keep them running in a treadmill.

49:27.032 --> 49:32.278
That's why he came out with Steve Kirsch, introduced the world to Steve Kirsch, Brett Weinstein.

49:32.318 --> 49:33.259
And what happened here?

49:34.040 --> 49:35.882
We heard the pronunciation COVID.

49:36.563 --> 49:43.250
We heard about vaccines or ivermectin as being a way of getting to some kind of hybrid herd immunity.

49:44.090 --> 49:51.976
We heard about repurposed drugs and how if you have the right, you know, the right, the right trick with ivermectin, it's like a perfect prophylactic.

49:52.797 --> 49:56.800
There's definitely a virus, but zero COVID was still a very realistic goal.

49:56.840 --> 50:01.804
And on the flip side, Robert Malone said, well, you know, endemic was always the worst case scenario.

50:01.924 --> 50:09.850
Usually these things peter out, but sometimes if you get a really good one, that's got really good pieces in it, it can go endemic.

50:10.851 --> 50:14.553
the same worst case scenario that was actually presented before the pandemic.

50:15.773 --> 50:20.935
That's not by accident, that's by absolute curation of the narrative.

50:20.975 --> 50:31.100
That's why in 2020, there was another person saying COVID, who knew about the fear and cleavage site, who knew that we had to be focused on genetic causes of autism.

50:33.021 --> 50:43.468
and knew before the pandemic that we should look for biomarkers, that we should be looking for biomarkers in the population because there's a certain vulnerable population to vaccines.

50:43.868 --> 50:46.730
And that's how we would make vaccines safe again.

50:46.790 --> 50:47.871
Now, why is that interesting?

50:47.911 --> 50:56.637
Because this is one of the most important people in the movement that came out early, that's promoted by CHD as one of their foremost flag-bearing experts.

50:58.359 --> 51:04.744
And that's no different really because these people all came out about the same thing and agreed about, well, the spike protein is curious.

51:05.525 --> 51:07.246
If you're in Cleveland site is curious.

51:07.306 --> 51:09.428
Well, you know, there is that HIV paper.

51:09.488 --> 51:10.869
The gain of function is real.

51:10.889 --> 51:13.291
I mean, look back to 2015, they were doing it.

51:13.852 --> 51:14.993
Lab viruses are real.

51:15.033 --> 51:17.715
I mean, there were, why would the Chinese delete the database?

51:19.793 --> 51:25.560
And so all of these parties in 2020 accepted that the worst case scenario was really bad, bad.

51:25.580 --> 51:29.305
The only question was whether this was bad, bad, or just bad.

51:31.553 --> 51:32.773
And that is by design.

51:32.833 --> 51:34.594
That's why these people came out then.

51:34.634 --> 51:56.221
That's why Kevin McKernan came out so early and talked about how PCR works and an expert in it on different podcasts, including a guy who used to work for the World Bank named Vance Crow and why he wrote this paper with Claire Craig and some of these other people in late 2020, objecting to the PCR test, but not really objecting to it.

51:56.302 --> 51:57.282
I've got three of those.

51:57.822 --> 52:03.750
videos from the Vance Crowe podcast on my own website because I don't want to lose them because it's obvious.

52:04.551 --> 52:18.322
that that is a person who used to work for the Human Genome Project, whose father was involved in micro-AI technologies, probably working for the same biosecurity state that his sons did and spun off technology from the Human Genome Project.

52:18.362 --> 52:19.784
That's why he's so wealthy.

52:20.224 --> 52:22.466
I mean, I'm not worried about that.

52:22.526 --> 52:28.631
I just think that you can't see him as being a patriot loyal to our grandchildren's freedom.

52:29.031 --> 52:36.517
He is a patriot as it is loyal to the national security state where he cut his teeth at the Human Genome Project.

52:36.557 --> 52:46.304
That's why he says PCR works for detecting SARS-CoV-2, that all those sequences are real and that the phylogenetic trees that we've built are real.

52:46.704 --> 52:54.610
And it's just not as novel as Tony claims because it was probably circulating in the backwoods of China where there is no sequencing before the pandemic.

52:54.650 --> 52:56.851
And that's why he's testing weed for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.

53:00.745 --> 53:09.671
And that's why these guys were writing a paper together and why Claire Craig, when she finally came out, you find out that she's a clinical pathologist.

53:09.751 --> 53:10.992
She worked on cancer.

53:11.092 --> 53:12.233
She was a geneticist.

53:12.293 --> 53:18.557
She wanted to use genomes to look for biomarkers, to find descriptions for cancer.

53:18.697 --> 53:25.222
On her own Twitter handle, she says she's an AI optimistic skeptic and data lover.

53:26.496 --> 53:33.421
And the PCR, she told us, was a trade-off, kind of like how food is a trade-off with fast food or tasty food.

53:36.524 --> 53:38.845
It's all the same game, ladies and gentlemen.

53:38.866 --> 53:45.691
That's why when Jimmy Dore was coming out on the Joe Rogan podcast, it didn't go fast.

53:47.819 --> 53:56.045
It took many, many years before the rest of these posers were on his show and they started talking about more and more of the things freely.

53:56.105 --> 54:03.971
This is all, each one of these is an example of how we have been titrated to an artificial finish line each time.

54:04.972 --> 54:16.881
And that all of these people, by stepping in front of real patriots, stepping in front of real biologists, stepping in front of real, real resistance,

54:17.932 --> 54:19.933
We haven't gotten as far as we should have.

54:19.993 --> 54:40.238
If Mary Holland was already able to get on Democracy Now in 2015, if Vaxxed was on Good Morning America and discussed on Good Morning America, then when the pandemic happened, those people should have been in positions where they could have completely taken over the narrative, but they weren't.

54:41.239 --> 54:42.259
They didn't even try.

54:42.279 --> 54:45.860
It was about free speech and mandates.

54:51.178 --> 55:00.382
That's why it's important to realize that I don't, I'm doing okay because I have a few tiny supporters that give me enough money to pay rent and it's crazy.

55:00.902 --> 55:02.103
I love you all very much.

55:03.023 --> 55:04.304
I should put you guys back up.

55:07.585 --> 55:13.007
And there are a few that are really responsible for the vast majority of, of the touchdowns that we score here.

55:13.027 --> 55:16.509
But every one of these names matters and the people that are, that are

55:17.847 --> 55:22.228
The people that are going above and beyond know who they are because I'm in contact with them pretty regularly.

55:22.308 --> 55:32.531
But, you know, Steven, Jeff, Greg, Kerry, it's a lot of people that make this happen, you know, and I'm grateful for all of you.

55:33.371 --> 55:39.653
But I got fired by CHD at the end of 2023 specifically because I was talking about Robert Malone.

55:42.334 --> 55:47.155
And this cannot be by accident because it was Mary Holland that fired me.

55:48.533 --> 55:51.755
And so what you have here is a group of people.

55:54.757 --> 55:57.999
You have a group of people that refuses to

56:00.532 --> 56:12.879
refuses to talk about big picture ideas, refuses to talk about simple ways to get lots of people to understand where we should be and the understanding that they are fighting for.

56:12.979 --> 56:23.946
Instead, these people are very happy to use words like rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear, and rescue the republic and join the resistance.

56:26.189 --> 56:31.553
And we should be pretty alarmed at this lack of specificity after 10 years.

56:31.593 --> 56:39.359
We should be pretty alarmed at this lack of specificity after five years of this performance.

56:41.361 --> 56:44.663
Because it is a signal that they are way off script.

56:45.584 --> 56:47.886
The only thing they can do is ignore these points now.

56:48.846 --> 56:55.792
None of them can be refuted usefully without drawing attention to the fact that there is so much here.

56:57.816 --> 57:05.217
and that they then have been ignoring it for a very long time because people who've been watching for a while know where we've been and how far we've, how long we've been there.

57:06.238 --> 57:17.760
And so that's, what's really interesting about this Weinstock 2024 is because it really seems like these weaponized piles of money have used us and convinced us that these are the people that are going to fight for us.

57:17.800 --> 57:18.820
That's the whole idea.

57:19.280 --> 57:23.321
And Brett Weinstein really thinks that this is going to be the next Woodstock.

57:26.425 --> 57:48.298
And we need to talk about PCR with academic biologists so that they understand how they use it versus how it was used in the 220 plus, 220 plus EUA granted diagnostics that were used in America for the first two years.

57:49.379 --> 57:54.842
How virology can be a lie, but transfection and transformation can be misconstrued as virology.

57:55.802 --> 57:58.143
and also be used to produce biologics.

57:59.824 --> 58:06.368
So there's lots of truths out there that these people all could have and should have known, especially the ones that have been in pharma for a really long time.

58:07.209 --> 58:21.217
And so finally, the other thing that I've not been hammering home enough since I brought it up in 2021, and then kind of left it behind, is how the population pyramid and an expected rise in all cause mortality provided the opportunity for them to tell us this story.

58:23.686 --> 58:29.129
And that's why I think these things are where we need to focus and what we need to teach our children right now.

58:29.169 --> 58:45.739
We need to get them to be able to usefully think about these ideas and usefully represent them to others so that other people are more or less forced to hold these thoughts in their head for a little while and realize, with the help of them perhaps, how contradictory some of their

58:46.656 --> 58:52.921
the people that they follow and the people that they respect have been with regard to these ideas not getting there in 10 years.

59:05.686 --> 59:12.295
And so Weinstock 2024 is something that we all should kind of pay attention to.

59:12.956 --> 59:18.503
My gut feeling tells me that if you're gonna go to DC to be a part of this event, that you should not bring your phone.

59:19.564 --> 59:38.553
One of the easiest ways that any intelligence agency interested in keeping track of who would invest resources to participate in this event, given who's going to be there and what the theme is, the very easy way to keep track of who's there is just keep track of the devices that come.

59:39.773 --> 59:46.917
So, although I'm not going to be there, even if I was going, I wouldn't bring my phone and

59:48.464 --> 59:49.564
Gee, I'd probably, I don't know.

59:49.964 --> 59:50.344
I don't know.

59:50.965 --> 59:53.205
I was tempted, but I don't think I'm going to go.

59:53.945 --> 59:56.706
Anyway, I wanted to take a look at this.

59:57.106 --> 01:00:07.768
And this is a podcast done with Jordan Peterson on Jordan Peterson's podcast with Heather and Brett there.

01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:09.448
And they did like an hour and a half.

01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:14.789
And if you want to watch the podcast, I think it's worthwhile to watch the beginning and the end.

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:15.690
And the reason why,

01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:21.496
Maybe I'll have to show those clips later.

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:44.734
I don't know but in the beginning Brett Weinstein says that he's pretty sure that this is a spiritual battle which is you know, it's a It's funny that he says that now I don't think I'm sure it's a spiritual battle But it's just odd for him to start that podcast with a clip like that and then at the end of the podcast they're actually talking about how

01:00:47.308 --> 01:01:14.923
Useful knowledge is transmitted across generations and The idea that they come upon or the analogy that they come upon or the model that they talk about is essentially They call it a meme so that you use memes to transmit ideas across generations and then somehow or another they say they're debating a third guy and they say that I just find it strange and

01:01:15.484 --> 01:01:26.582
that one of the examples that this guy chooses to use to describe a meme that transmits information across generations is singing Happy Birthday instead of the Catholic Church.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:31.240
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:01:31.981 --> 01:01:35.944
And so to just, I found that a really strange remark by Brett.

01:01:37.025 --> 01:01:41.067
You know, at the beginning, they use a clip where he says he thinks this is a spiritual battle.

01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:56.398
And then at the end, he kind of argues for the Catholic Church as being a fairly effective transmitter of information across generations, which is, you know, I don't know, it's at least alarming.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.780
And so anyway, let's watch this clip.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.021
It's only 15 minutes long and then we'll wrap it up.

01:02:04.622 --> 01:02:08.903
You have a rally planned in Washington on September 29th.

01:02:09.743 --> 01:02:19.467
And so would you walk us through, well, let's start with who's involved in exactly what this is and what its aims are and just tell the whole story.

01:02:20.785 --> 01:02:23.707
Sure, and I will say I struggle with the terminology.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:29.131
This, to me, is post-political, non-ideological.

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:37.618
Yes, it's technically an event, but it's an event, or we are hoping it is an event in the same way that Woodstock was a music festival.

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:49.987
We are hoping, actually, that this is a moment at which we first see a seed change in the way we conduct ourselves and interact with each other.

01:02:51.636 --> 01:03:06.730
I think of it actually as hopefully the bookend that closes the era that opened with Woodstock and opens the next era in which we recognize just how much we have in common, just how much we have to lose if our system fails, which it seems to be doing in front of our eyes.

01:03:08.011 --> 01:03:13.314
The rally, the event, is called Rescue the Republic.

01:03:14.835 --> 01:03:20.258
The idea was originally framed as save or defend the West.

01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:28.963
We recognize the crisis is so charged within the U.S.

01:03:29.023 --> 01:03:36.047
that we decided to focus on the Republic, rescue the Republic first in order to save the West.

01:03:37.768 --> 01:03:40.710
And, well, you asked who is involved.

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:50.213
I'm going to undoubtedly forget important people who have agreed to come speak on our behalf.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.895
Well, where can people find the full list?

01:03:53.175 --> 01:03:57.797
Ah, they can find all the information at jointheresistance.org.

01:03:58.377 --> 01:03:59.958
Jointheresistance.org.

01:03:59.998 --> 01:04:03.279
And they can follow us on Twitter at RescueRepublic.

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:10.816
Okay, so if you do miss anyone, that's where people can go for the additional information, and we'll post that in the description of the video as well.

01:04:10.956 --> 01:04:11.156
Yes.

01:04:11.276 --> 01:04:14.059
Okay, so fire away with regards to participants.

01:04:14.319 --> 01:04:27.132
Okay, and I will also say that there are people who are in the process of agreeing to come who aren't listed yet, so stay tuned, even somebody who's not listed today, maybe tomorrow.

01:04:28.421 --> 01:04:31.883
So we have Bobby Kennedy coming to speak.

01:04:32.323 --> 01:04:33.704
We have Tulsi Gabbard.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.365
We have Laura Logan.

01:04:37.025 --> 01:04:38.346
Heather and I will be speaking.

01:04:38.686 --> 01:04:39.887
We have Russell Brand.

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.308
We have Matt Taibbi.

01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:46.470
We have Jimmy Dore.

01:04:48.731 --> 01:04:49.231
Rob Schneider.

01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:50.191
Rob Schneider.

01:04:50.211 --> 01:04:50.912
We have

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:53.715
Several musicians.

01:04:53.755 --> 01:04:55.356
Yeah, we have Skillet coming.

01:04:55.516 --> 01:05:02.179
We have Five Times August, who was a tremendous voice during the COVID madness.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:08.702
We have Tennessee Jet coming, Deepak.

01:05:10.465 --> 01:05:13.628
Are any of these people going to play as well as talk to you?

01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:19.874
Yeah, we have speakers, we have comedians, and we have musicians.

01:05:20.034 --> 01:05:21.275
Great, great, great.

01:05:21.295 --> 01:05:24.157
That's a good approach, that multi-modal approach.

01:05:24.678 --> 01:05:28.942
And that does make it different than the standard, let's say, political rally.

01:05:29.562 --> 01:05:35.626
Right, and I think partly what that does, we did that a bit at this ARC, Alliance for Responsible Citizenship meeting in London.

01:05:36.686 --> 01:05:44.511
I was very insistent on the musical and artistic element, and I think it's because the propositional has to be surrounded by the

01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:46.952
imagistic and aesthetic.

01:05:47.012 --> 01:05:49.033
That's more like the domain of dream, right?

01:05:49.093 --> 01:05:59.019
It's like the way that I look at cognitive architecture is that there's a propositional landscape, which we've actually modeled pretty well now, I would say, with large language models.

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:03.662
But outside of that, there's an imagistic, aesthetic and dreamlike landscape.

01:06:03.722 --> 01:06:05.683
That's the landscape of the imagination.

01:06:06.224 --> 01:06:09.466
And outside of that is the embodied procedural realm.

01:06:10.447 --> 01:06:13.891
And a full event covers all three of those domains.

01:06:13.931 --> 01:06:17.516
You can't assume that the propositional alone is going to carry it.

01:06:17.837 --> 01:06:20.481
And I think it's partly because the propositional is easier.

01:06:21.282 --> 01:06:24.626
In some ways it has flaws and it's easier to dement it.

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:32.875
and capture it than it is to capture the imagination and the procedural landscape.

01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:39.900
Anyways, if you flesh it out with those additional sources, it's also a much richer experience for the people that are involved.

01:06:40.141 --> 01:06:43.803
What I hear here, and I wonder if you hear it here too,

01:06:47.806 --> 01:07:02.499
is this discussion of how we can better get everybody to engage in a way where their whole being is a part of it, where they are participating in the most

01:07:03.973 --> 01:07:10.519
positive and engaged way and he thinks that music and artists and laughter is a way to do it.

01:07:10.579 --> 01:07:20.608
Now what's interesting is in this book that I want you to start reading when you get it from eBay or wherever you find it called The Phenomenon of Man,

01:07:22.822 --> 01:07:43.536
In this book, I want you to be aware that in the beginning of the book, don't forget that if you send a self-addressed stamped envelope to my PO box, you can get some stickers for your water bottle and a Velcro-backed patch for all your tactical needs.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.783
Oops, that's not what I wanted.

01:07:47.803 --> 01:07:52.485
I want this one I really need you to hear that in the beginning of this book.

01:07:52.725 --> 01:08:14.897
You can already hear it in the in the introduction There is something about the idea and I won't find it right now But I just trust me that it's in the book The idea is that fish fish swim in schools in the ocean

01:08:15.911 --> 01:08:17.932
And bees make hives.

01:08:19.052 --> 01:08:23.794
And humans make this sphere of consciousness.

01:08:23.874 --> 01:08:27.235
Where we swim as fish is in thought.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:32.397
And that is what makes the man unique.

01:08:33.097 --> 01:08:34.477
That's the gift that we have.

01:08:35.638 --> 01:08:44.721
And so mankind is a phenomenon different from other animals because of this extra layer upon which evolution can act.

01:08:45.672 --> 01:08:46.313
and direct.

01:08:46.793 --> 01:08:49.317
And that layer is our layer of consciousness.

01:08:49.397 --> 01:09:03.594
And more importantly, thinking of it as a school of fish, it is these different schools of fish that are swimming around in this conscious layer, tribes of humans, cultures, societies, civilizations.

01:09:06.297 --> 01:09:32.070
And so in the same context, in the same conversation where I'm trying to get my viewers to understand the foundations of the illusion of biology that is being foisted on people in the academic setting, that's based on genes and reductionist thinking and investigations, is based on a very parallel need

01:09:33.123 --> 01:09:43.591
to get people to accept this general idea that if we're going to put our big boy pants on as a species, we're going to need to take control of our evolution.

01:09:43.631 --> 01:09:49.315
And our evolution is a lot like the evolution of schooling in fish.

01:09:49.776 --> 01:09:55.720
If we're going to take that to a new level, we need to understand how the school is formed and control the school.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.743
If we are the fish in the analogy.

01:09:59.803 --> 01:10:00.644
That's this book.

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:13.739
That's a Jesuit priest writing in the 30s, not published till the 50s, ranted and raved about by people like Julian Huxley, all the way up until people like Jeffrey Sachs and Peter Hotez.

01:10:14.279 --> 01:10:15.740
That's what we're talking about here.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.161
That's what Mark's working on.

01:10:17.602 --> 01:10:18.843
That's what I'm working on.

01:10:18.883 --> 01:10:28.650
We need to understand that this, the foundation of this fiction that we are being governed by, this mythology that we are being governed by is founded in

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:47.423
logic and reasoning and a sort of insight into the phenomenon of man on earth, in nature, outside of the context of a Creator, but instead as our own Lord of creation.

01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:48.144
That's the trick.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:55.670
Nowhere in this book do we really talk about the Creator, but instead we talk about how man has responsibilities.

01:10:57.025 --> 01:11:00.389
because I guess the Creator left those responsibilities to us.

01:11:02.671 --> 01:11:10.981
And so it's important for me to read these books with you, to take notes on these books, so that we really understand the foundations of these ideas.

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:17.388
And if we don't do that work, then we're inevitably going to be kind of floating in the middle somewhere.

01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:45.125
Instead of building a firm foundation on which we can now move forward and look at the observations that have been made over the last hundred years and reinterpret them in the context of an irreducible complexity, a sacred irreducible complexity in biology that we can appreciate has evidence of a creator rather than some, I don't know, very, very fancy watch that we can tweak and make better.

01:11:47.133 --> 01:12:10.372
Never mind the idea that this, we need to take control of the collective consciousness is what is really what they're talking about in that book and what they're advocating for with regard to a universal religion that will take control of a humanity that has become so connected that individual societies and cultures and languages are no longer sufficient to control them.

01:12:12.116 --> 01:12:20.822
It used to be that languages could insulate people from one another and make it hard for bad ideas to spread too fast for the ruling elite.

01:12:21.663 --> 01:12:26.806
Now they have a new problem, and it's a new problem that was already seen coming for decades.

01:12:26.826 --> 01:12:39.695
They've already been preparing for, for decades, just in the same way that they've been preparing for the coming increase in all cause mortality that none of these people, after five or 10 years of thinking about this, have been able to see.

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:43.632
That's it.

01:12:44.813 --> 01:12:53.177
It's more engaging, it's more fun, and that's not trivial if the fun isn't, you know, that short-term hedonic immediate gratification that we were describing earlier.

01:12:53.557 --> 01:13:00.741
If it's allied with something like upward striving, it's much more profound and impactful occurrence.

01:13:01.121 --> 01:13:22.966
and integrated and more human and more holistic, because what you're calling propositional, I might call features of the enlightenment, of the rational, of the logical, of the analytical, whereas we have sort of lateral to that, but no less important narrative and art and creativity.

01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:29.907
And by sort of moving between these two spaces, we have the opportunity for discovery that we may not have in either place.

01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:30.887
Yeah, definitely.

01:13:31.187 --> 01:13:44.891
And also what you're calling the propositional, what I think of as sort of the fruits of the enlightenment, are easily made into reductionist tenets that then become metrics that are quantifiable.

01:13:45.491 --> 01:13:50.053
And numbers are necessary and important for us to understand our world, but they are not sufficient.

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:52.253
And they can be made to seem sufficient.

01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:54.034
And that's one of the lessons, I think, of COVID.

01:13:54.934 --> 01:14:04.661
and frankly, to some degree, of this political moment we're living in too, that you throw enough, these are the numbers, don't worry about it, I'm the expert, just trust me at people.

01:14:05.182 --> 01:14:09.405
And many of them kind of go, okay, yeah, I'm just not educated enough to understand that.

01:14:09.705 --> 01:14:12.206
You've got the numbers, you're the expert, we'll go with that.

01:14:12.507 --> 01:14:16.690
Well, it's also possibly the case that that also accounts for

01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:28.240
maybe why the Democratic tradition or the Republican tradition works, you know, is because intellectuals are propositional experts, but that doesn't make them wise.

01:14:28.921 --> 01:14:36.868
And wisdom, I suspect, has something to do with the alignment between the propositional and the imaginistic and the procedural.

01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:38.890
So it's an embodied quality.

01:14:41.832 --> 01:14:43.614
And it's a quality of the imagination.

01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:50.041
There's no shortage of people who aren't educated and who aren't very articulate who can still tell the difference between right and wrong.

01:14:50.581 --> 01:14:52.083
And they can do it pretty unerringly.

01:14:52.604 --> 01:14:54.846
I mean, dogs can do that to some degree, right?

01:14:54.886 --> 01:15:00.952
I mean, they're not so bad at sniffing out pathological character, but they can't propositionalize it.

01:15:01.616 --> 01:15:08.866
You know, I mean, and dogs are very good at identifying boundaries between different territories and what's a threat and what's not.

01:15:08.926 --> 01:15:17.158
Do you see how weird it is as a psychologist that he's not saying that people can sniff out?

01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:20.314
Like it's weird, right?

01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:34.302
Because you would think that if, if, if this guy, for example, argues that like fish swim in schools in the water, man swims in conscious thought together in groups.

01:15:35.303 --> 01:15:44.709
You hear that as fish swim in schools in water, men swim in groups in conscious thought.

01:15:48.379 --> 01:15:50.260
That's what we're talking about here.

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.660
These are the ideas.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.040
We are being governed.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:16:06.464
And it is an illusion of biology, an illusion of global politics, of war, and clashes of civilization by which we are being governed.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.985
Wittingly and unwittingly, these people are participating in it.

01:16:11.972 --> 01:16:24.502
I think these people were put in place before the pandemic to be sure that by now it would seem, well, it just so happens that these are the people that we're listening to because, you know, they were there.

01:16:25.303 --> 01:16:26.463
And that's a lie.

01:16:26.544 --> 01:16:40.795
That's the exact illusion that is created by social media, that you think that everybody on social media that has reach got it because that's the way the algorithm sorted out, you know, like kind of a big Plinko game.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.920
And that's absolutely incorrect.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.602
These people were put in place before the pandemic and artificially elevated at every point during the pandemic.

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:52.802
And this is the kind of censorship you need to be concerned about.

01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:59.924
Not whether anybody can find me or someone else or somebody got canceled on one place or another.

01:17:00.064 --> 01:17:05.685
No, because how does that affect millions and millions of people around the earth?

01:17:06.285 --> 01:17:06.685
It doesn't.

01:17:07.697 --> 01:17:23.375
but artificially promoting somebody like Jordan Peterson for five years does, artificially promoting someone as Brett Weinstein for the last five years certainly affects millions of people.

01:17:25.578 --> 01:17:40.089
And so his censorship was more spreading of his, his image and his ideas and his suffering as a, as a guy who had apparently principles of some kind and is now one of these leaders of the resistance.

01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:43.291
This is, this is no.

01:17:52.318 --> 01:17:52.718
Darn it.

01:17:53.659 --> 01:17:53.779
So,

01:17:55.256 --> 01:17:58.818
My point is there are other forms of intelligence that aren't propositional.

01:17:58.898 --> 01:18:13.486
And it's very easy for those who have the advantage in the propositional space to assume that they're superior in terms of their grip on knowledge, even outside their specialized domains, but that they're also wiser and more moral.

01:18:13.566 --> 01:18:18.889
And there's no correlation between cognitive ability and conscientiousness, zero.

01:18:19.269 --> 01:18:20.710
There's no correlation between

01:18:21.866 --> 01:18:26.589
intelligence, intelligence looks like it's orthogonal to all the personality traits.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:32.373
And so it's a funny thing that there's no relationship between general cognitive ability and wisdom or morality.

01:18:33.394 --> 01:18:37.217
So if you're really smart, you can go bad very badly, very, very badly.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:40.987
Well, I wonder if that's going to hold up, actually.

01:18:41.087 --> 01:18:51.812
There are reasons to imagine that you might start seeing a correlation between intelligence, the fly in the ointment being, how good are you at actually measuring that?

01:18:51.872 --> 01:18:59.596
We have proxies for measuring your capacity to succeed, but to succeed in an amoral system, maybe it's not such a good proxy for intelligence.

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:02.298
But back to the earlier point,

01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:10.662
I want to point to something that Tom Stoppard said about humor.

01:19:12.183 --> 01:19:17.685
He said, laughter is the sound of comprehension.

01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:19.366
Right, that's good.

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:20.567
My point would be,

01:19:22.819 --> 01:19:30.026
that the comedians, this will become less and less true the more they leverage AI to figure out what people will laugh at.

01:19:30.046 --> 01:19:31.728
It will become a self-referential.

01:19:32.008 --> 01:19:44.600
OK, I think I'm going to hear something here that I'm going to be able to completely invert and teach you something very fundamental about neurobiology, neuroscience, and human energies.

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:50.703
that I think I've learned in my many years as a 52-year-old adult.

01:19:50.963 --> 01:19:59.791
I'm really excited about this statement that he makes because if I remember it correctly, it's really absolutely positively an inverted form of the truth.

01:20:00.452 --> 01:20:01.313
Land of nonsense.

01:20:01.813 --> 01:20:07.618
But for the moment, while AI is decidedly not funny, and it's really terrible at being funny so far,

01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:20.822
The comedian is traversing an edge between what we are conscious of and what we are barely conscious of.

01:20:21.002 --> 01:20:25.264
And when the comedian delivers a joke that causes the room to erupt in laughter,

01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:33.076
The comedian has found something that everybody in the room is aware of, but they are not aware that everybody else is aware of it.

01:20:33.216 --> 01:20:38.040
And so the room comes to understand itself as of like mind all at once.

01:20:38.661 --> 01:20:38.861
Right?

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:43.164
That's an extremely powerful, very ancient property.

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:45.706
Often of like mind about something forbidden.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:49.770
I think of that as, that's often the translation of the pursuit.

01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:52.831
And so what he's talking about here, I believe,

01:21:13.658 --> 01:21:34.393
is what Teilhard de Chardin was talking about and what Julian Huxley are talking about when they say that like fish school in the water, men school in conscious thought, in groups.

01:21:36.621 --> 01:21:46.245
What he's talking about here now is schooling behavior within conscious thought that occurs when you're at a good comedy show.

01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:49.207
But it also happens when you're at a good rock show.

01:21:51.087 --> 01:21:54.589
It also happens when you go to a great and beautiful moving choir.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:10.470
or when you're at a church service with an especially moving sermon, or at a funeral with a bunch of people who all agree on why the person who just recently died that they're there to honor is so worth honoring.

01:22:12.692 --> 01:22:16.355
A collective shared thought, a shared feeling,

01:22:17.987 --> 01:22:20.469
results in some kind of experience.

01:22:20.729 --> 01:22:22.831
I don't know really how else to explain it.

01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:28.896
If you were, for example, and I'll just give you an example that I think might ring a bell with some people.

01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:37.184
If you had a band that you really, really liked, that you liked for a very long time, but for whatever reason, you were never able to go to a concert.

01:22:37.204 --> 01:22:43.349
It never even was a possibility because you were too much of a kid and you had just recently gotten to college.

01:22:43.369 --> 01:22:45.531
And then all of a sudden they came to your town

01:22:47.557 --> 01:23:06.812
And your friends got tickets, and you got tickets, and you went to see this band that you've been listening to since you were a freshman in high school, that you listened to on the beach when you were a teenager while you were lifeguarding, that you had playing on a boombox at the playground when you were shooting buckets.

01:23:08.053 --> 01:23:10.215
And now suddenly you're standing with 50,000 other people, or

01:23:12.884 --> 01:23:26.614
not likely 50,000, but let's say 20,000 people at Alpine Amphitheater in northern Wisconsin, where you're outside and there's a big hill of grass and it's just a sea of people all the way down.

01:23:27.155 --> 01:23:33.980
And then everybody in the place agrees that if they play this one song, you're going to freak out.

01:23:34.946 --> 01:23:58.281
and it's the second set, and you're three songs in, and they're doing some drum solo, and you went to get drinks, and you come back with like four, and you're barely able to get through the crowd, and then suddenly you hear the first notes of that song that is your favorite song, and you realize, and everybody in the place agrees that, oh my gosh, they're actually gonna play it.

01:24:01.533 --> 01:24:18.457
And now anybody that's experienced that is probably listening to this story and already getting goosebumps and substituting their own particular experiences for that, where they heard for the first time the dead play, or the first time a particular song of the dead being played.

01:24:19.158 --> 01:24:28.420
It is without a doubt the absolute truth in this book that men swim in groups of conscious thought.

01:24:30.484 --> 01:24:42.354
and knowing that fact, then you understand how we are intended to and are successfully governed by creating these schools within which men can swim.

01:24:43.735 --> 01:24:45.316
These schools of thought.

01:24:46.297 --> 01:24:47.118
Isn't it weird?

01:24:49.559 --> 01:24:51.561
These schools of thought.

01:24:53.903 --> 01:24:59.808
In all my life, I've been thinking school like S-C-H instead of S-C.

01:25:03.157 --> 01:25:09.160
And so it is really important to see where they're going and what they're doing here and what they are saying and what they're not saying.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:24.926
Because of course, a religion and singing hymns and having a service of any kind, prayer in groups of any kind, is exactly what they're talking about.

01:25:24.966 --> 01:25:28.648
It is the generation of a shared thought in real time

01:25:30.615 --> 01:25:33.697
And something occurs in groups of people when that happens.

01:25:35.099 --> 01:25:47.708
You can't watch a comedian all by yourself and laugh as hard as you would laugh if just your wife or husband or best friend was in the room with you and laughed with you at the same time.

01:25:48.429 --> 01:25:49.290
It's impossible.

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:56.655
And that energy, that cognitive energy is not well understood, but is 100% real.

01:25:56.715 --> 01:25:57.636
You can count on it.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.022
And sometimes it takes forms that you can almost cut like a knife.

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:31.298
And for the last decades, they have been thinking about how it is that they are going to cope with the idea that all of these disparate schools of thought are going to be somehow starting to intermingle because of the internet, because of connectivity, because of the size of the population and the size of the planet and whatever else forces you want to bring to the table.

01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:39.819
The school of thought is about to change across Western world.

01:26:42.303 --> 01:26:50.315
And they're using this opportunity of an increase in all-cause mortality for 10 or 12 years to stage that change.

01:26:56.749 --> 01:27:00.931
That's an extremely powerful, very ancient property.

01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:03.492
Often of like mind about something forbidden.

01:27:03.873 --> 01:27:16.279
I think of that as, that's often the translation of the procedural or imaginistic into the explicit, because that's, the comedian gives words, he gives words to something inchoate, it's like it's already

01:27:17.179 --> 01:27:21.601
It's it's captured in the relationship between the ideas that already exists, right?

01:27:21.982 --> 01:27:25.564
And then the comedian puts his finger on it, just like someone who coins a word does.

01:27:25.904 --> 01:27:27.445
You know, all of a sudden words pop up.

01:27:27.865 --> 01:27:38.191
And that's part of the reason, for example, why the routine that that George Carlin does, where it's almost exclusively the American dream, is it is just that a dream?

01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:40.732
And, you know, you're it's a big club and you're not in it.

01:27:40.792 --> 01:27:42.533
It's not really a very funny.

01:27:43.754 --> 01:27:44.374
Diatribe.

01:27:45.905 --> 01:27:48.866
It's not a very funny diatribe at all, but why is it effective?

01:27:48.906 --> 01:27:56.549
It's effective because the language that he chooses is very, very sharp and it is sharp enough

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:10.955
and delivered with enough skill so that the people in the audience are more or less brought to the identical place in the thought line as he walks you down the thought line.

01:28:10.995 --> 01:28:16.059
And so when he says it's a big club and you're not in it, everybody knows exactly what he means.

01:28:16.119 --> 01:28:18.961
And they have that thought at the same time and they can feel it.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:29.131
That's why when you watch that rant by yourself, it would not ever be the same as if you were in an audience of people watching that rant, even if it was a recording.

01:28:30.945 --> 01:28:43.769
It is the collective feeling that is in a group of people that you cannot be denied and is actually that energy is what they greatly reduced on purpose since the beginning of the pandemic.

01:28:43.809 --> 01:28:53.353
The assembly of people, the free assembly of people to share ideas and to agree on things, even if it's as mundane as agreeing that

01:28:54.113 --> 01:29:01.901
that it's okay to have a drink in a bar and smoke cigarettes inside while listening to a live band.

01:29:04.043 --> 01:29:15.454
The group of people that agreed that that was a good way to spend a Friday or Saturday evening has been greatly reduced on purpose because in those places there is an extraordinary potential for free thought.

01:29:18.815 --> 01:29:29.440
And that potential is being mimicked on the internet by putting three people on a screen and having you watch as though you're participating in a conversation.

01:29:32.761 --> 01:29:41.765
And maybe even we're starting to only feel that energy when we try to send it out in the presence of these fake conversations.

01:29:42.725 --> 01:29:43.986
And we're sending it nowhere.

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:52.174
instead of sending it to our loved ones and to our friends and to the people that we're playing poker with on a given night.

01:29:55.617 --> 01:30:07.766
And so while they're going to go and pivot and now give you a real good explanation for what we mean, they're not going to say it's an illusion of consensus that can be created by three people who go on a podcast and agree to lie to you about something.

01:30:08.951 --> 01:30:16.296
They're not going to say how this could be weaponized against a population for decades to get them to believe a mythology about their biology.

01:30:16.977 --> 01:30:18.718
They wouldn't want to tell you that, right?

01:30:19.839 --> 01:30:22.421
You have a rally planned in Washington.

01:30:22.801 --> 01:30:26.044
There's no correlation between intelligence.

01:30:26.884 --> 01:30:30.147
Intelligence looks like it's orthogonal to all the personality traits.

01:30:30.227 --> 01:30:35.911
And so it's a funny thing that there's no relationship between general cognitive ability and wisdom or morality.

01:30:36.929 --> 01:30:40.770
So if you're really smart, you can go bad very badly, very, very badly.

01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:44.530
Well, I wonder if that's going to hold up, actually.

01:30:44.630 --> 01:30:55.352
There are reasons to imagine that you might start seeing a correlation between intelligence, the fly in the ointment being, how good are you at actually measuring that?

01:30:55.412 --> 01:31:03.153
We have proxies for measuring your capacity to succeed, but to succeed in an amoral system, maybe it's not such a good proxy for intelligence.

01:31:03.193 --> 01:31:05.834
But back to the earlier point.

01:31:07.074 --> 01:31:14.217
I want to point to something that Tom Stoppard said about humor.

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:21.239
He said, laughter is the sound of comprehension.

01:31:22.199 --> 01:31:22.899
Right, that's good.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.100
My point would be,

01:31:26.371 --> 01:31:33.559
that the comedians, this will become less and less true the more they leverage AI to figure out what people will laugh at.

01:31:33.599 --> 01:31:36.783
It will become a self-referential land of nonsense.

01:31:37.304 --> 01:31:43.090
But for the moment, while AI is decidedly not funny, and it's really terrible at being funny so far,

01:31:45.112 --> 01:31:56.299
The comedian is traversing an edge between what we are conscious of and what we are barely conscious of.

01:31:56.499 --> 01:32:00.742
And when the comedian delivers a joke that causes the room to erupt in laughter,

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:08.568
comedian has found something that everybody in the room is aware of, but they are not aware that everybody else is aware of it.

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:18.731
And so side note, Brett Weinstein has figured out the psychology of standup comedy, just making sure you're aware of what he's declaring right now.

01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:19.111
And.

01:32:19.731 --> 01:32:38.803
and not explaining it in any other way, but very certain terms, not broad enough terms where I would say the energy between humans that are thinking the same thought is not really well described, but definitely there and manifests in whole different ways is not the same as what he's saying.

01:32:38.863 --> 01:32:48.589
He's actually trying to tell you that he is certain, understands the psychological mechanism by which and what's actually occurring when people get a joke and laugh together.

01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:54.094
So the room comes to understand itself as of like mind all at once, right?

01:32:54.134 --> 01:32:58.398
That's an extremely powerful, very ancient property.

01:32:58.638 --> 01:33:00.960
Often of like mind about something forbidden.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:13.752
I think of that as, that's often the translation of the procedural or imaginistic into the explicit, because that's, the comedian gives words, he gives words to something inchoate, it's like it's already

01:33:14.557 --> 01:33:16.459
I mean, are we casting spells here?

01:33:16.499 --> 01:33:17.299
What is he doing?

01:33:17.319 --> 01:33:19.061
The ideas that already exists, right?

01:33:19.441 --> 01:33:23.024
And then the comedian puts his finger on it, just like someone who coins a word does.

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.046
You know how all of a sudden words pop up and we need them.

01:33:26.546 --> 01:33:29.989
And they'd spread like mad because they've specified something.

01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:31.530
You mean like transfection?

01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:32.731
You mean a word like that?

01:33:33.632 --> 01:33:34.913
Maybe like transfection?

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:35.854
Stop lying!

01:33:37.489 --> 01:33:42.156
that was a gap in our propositionalization and everyone recognizes it.

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:43.038
It's implicit.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.682
And it's funny too, because

01:33:46.775 --> 01:33:54.802
And this is a strange thing, is that it isn't obvious at all that that capacity for spontaneous laughter can be gamed, you know?

01:33:54.822 --> 01:33:59.626
I mean, you can get... Are there cruel forms of laughter?

01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:04.029
There are, but it's such an unconscious response, right?

01:34:04.089 --> 01:34:08.052
It's pre... It's... You laugh despite yourself often.

01:34:08.313 --> 01:34:08.593
Yeah.

01:34:08.613 --> 01:34:12.156
You certainly laugh before you think about whether you should laugh.

01:34:12.236 --> 01:34:12.616
And in fact...

01:34:14.217 --> 01:34:34.254
More than two years ago, I think is the first time I used the soup Nazi without the laugh track to tell you about how an illusion of consensus or a Feeling that there's an illusion of consensus can be used to make you think a sitcom is funny and I also used a a clip from

01:34:36.179 --> 01:34:42.020
Um, the other one with the physicists and the girl with the blonde girl, like, I don't remember what that one's called anymore.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.500
I want to say third rock from the sun, but that's not what it's called.

01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:51.482
Um, anyway, the one with the, the, the three geeks that are all physicists that live together.

01:34:51.522 --> 01:35:03.184
I looked at a clip like that too, that had no laughter in it to show you that that laugh track creates an illusion of consensus that gets you to think something is funnier and you feel something there.

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:04.304
It actually works.

01:35:04.864 --> 01:35:10.267
And so now Brett is going to claim that this is kind of his idea, which I'm absolutely certain.

01:35:10.307 --> 01:35:22.035
It's not just like transfection, just like autoimmunity from transfection and the mechanism for understanding it is not something that he arrived at with a lot of study and careful reflection.

01:35:24.715 --> 01:35:33.218
If you think about whether you should laugh, then you will commit a humor sin, which is laughing at the wrong moment.

01:35:33.878 --> 01:35:35.999
It's interesting that there's a cost to laughing.

01:35:36.019 --> 01:35:37.219
A humor sin.

01:35:37.239 --> 01:35:46.742
When the punchline hasn't been delivered, or after you know everybody else is laughing and it's like you're trying to cover the fact that you're really not, you're not one of us.

01:35:47.301 --> 01:35:56.523
Yeah, that inappropriate laughter has been pointed out as like that's one of the things that comes up as a critique of Kamala Harris consistently.

01:35:57.763 --> 01:36:03.364
For better or for worse, she's tarred with the brush of inappropriate laughter.

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:12.166
And you're pointing out that that's the gaming of something that's an evolutionarily designed marker of something like cognitive integrity.

01:36:12.186 --> 01:36:13.266
So evolution

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:21.845
And evolving to swim in schools means laughing at the appropriate time.

01:36:22.546 --> 01:36:24.488
It means cheering at the appropriate time.

01:36:24.528 --> 01:36:26.689
It means getting mad at the appropriate things.

01:36:26.749 --> 01:36:28.391
It means wearing the right costume.

01:36:31.834 --> 01:36:36.497
Because these are all kind of part and parcel for the cognitive space that we exist in.

01:36:37.578 --> 01:36:44.104
How we present ourselves physically to our conspecifics with what we wear, what skin we expose.

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.740
These are all part of the conscious space that we exist in.

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:48.960
Some of it is very physical.

01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.021
Others of it is really more meme-like.

01:36:51.081 --> 01:37:00.384
It's more ideas and even groups of ideas, maybe even rituals, music, language.

01:37:01.905 --> 01:37:13.629
And so are they going to explain that, that like these places that we find ourselves and groups of people find themselves in are places that can be created?

01:37:14.591 --> 01:37:25.618
and especially easily by social media, given that we are now swimming in that instead of the actual groups of people that we used to swim in.

01:37:28.359 --> 01:37:30.220
I think you can see where I'm going with this.

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:31.861
I think you can see the point I'm making.

01:37:31.922 --> 01:37:34.083
I don't wanna over, I don't wanna beat a dead horse.

01:37:34.763 --> 01:37:36.724
Laughter itself has been gained.

01:37:37.867 --> 01:37:43.713
And I would say that actually one of the most troubling inventions that human beings have devised.

01:37:43.993 --> 01:37:47.477
Troubling inventions that human beings have devised.

01:37:47.517 --> 01:37:52.562
Now, remember the studio audience is not, has not always been fake.

01:37:55.625 --> 01:38:01.771
This is something that again, Brett's not really saying it accurately enough to portray the danger.

01:38:03.988 --> 01:38:05.289
And that's what's really sad about it.

01:38:05.429 --> 01:38:07.490
The studio audience used to be a real thing.

01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:08.571
It's not anymore.

01:38:10.613 --> 01:38:11.793
It is augmented now.

01:38:11.853 --> 01:38:15.716
There might be a studio audience, but if they don't laugh when they're supposed to laugh, they'll augment it.

01:38:19.281 --> 01:38:30.224
And they even have a guy, I don't know if you've ever seen this before, but there's a guy who very long time had this invention that he had made that was kind of like a big suitcase that you could wheel around.

01:38:30.264 --> 01:38:34.385
And it had like recordings in it that were all queued up by buttons.

01:38:34.445 --> 01:38:43.147
It was almost like, if you've ever seen Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Future Man, his drummer, has invented this thing that he calls the Synthax Drumatar.

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:48.508
And it's just basically a MIDI triggered thing that looks kind of like a weird guitar with a bunch of MIDI triggers around it.

01:38:49.088 --> 01:38:54.671
And then when he triggers those triggers, they play all kinds of sounds behind him and he can load whatever he wants up into there.

01:38:55.112 --> 01:39:02.536
And so this, this kind of device was actually already around in the 70s when they still only had analog loop tapes.

01:39:02.976 --> 01:39:10.461
And this guy had made this machine, a custom machine that he could wheel into a sound studio, plug it in directly to the soundboard.

01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:35.308
and with you know his own special key you know he knew what all the keys were he could blend together this fake studio audience and make it sound like there was really a spontaneous audience but it wasn't it was hundreds of of clips that he had that he could sample different parts of in real time in some kind of really weird makeshift i don't know swiss family robinson kind of thing

01:39:36.465 --> 01:39:43.108
Back before the day any of this, now you could just have something like, I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:39:43.349 --> 01:39:44.989
Queued up in the form of what?

01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.550
Laughter.

01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:46.530
I mean.

01:39:53.474 --> 01:39:55.835
And so he's talking about that, of course, right?

01:39:55.855 --> 01:39:58.897
He's talking about that, but we already knew about that, right?

01:39:58.957 --> 01:40:01.818
So I just want to play first, just to remind you,

01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:10.333
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:40:10.753 --> 01:40:13.814
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:23.338
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:40:23.378 --> 01:40:29.961
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:40:30.961 --> 01:40:51.652
I don't know if I've ever pointed it out before, but what she says there, anything with rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, or Canada is saying nine months, is not questioning the efficacy of transfection to treat you against the novel virus that Brett still thinks we can get to zero.

01:40:53.613 --> 01:40:55.715
It's not questioning the efficacy at all.

01:40:55.775 --> 01:40:58.256
It's just saying that it might be rapidly fading

01:40:59.847 --> 01:41:07.953
And therefore, because the efficacy is rapidly fading, that you need another shot within a year, we can't call them vaccines.

01:41:08.713 --> 01:41:09.414
Stop lying.

01:41:10.655 --> 01:41:20.662
And so even that, and then conceding that, you know, Jonathan Cooey might be right, we should call these transfections, still is lying.

01:41:22.622 --> 01:41:30.045
because she didn't give any information, not even really the information that I would have wanted her to give about transfection.

01:41:30.105 --> 01:41:38.629
They're not a vaccine because they are not intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system.

01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:50.574
They are injection of a transfection, a previously described category of

01:41:52.542 --> 01:41:54.384
of applications, of methodologies.

01:41:54.424 --> 01:41:56.287
This is not unknown.

01:41:56.387 --> 01:41:57.027
They knew it.

01:41:58.129 --> 01:42:08.361
And even though they tried to give me credit for it in 2022 out the side of their mouth by saying my name and that transfection is what he insists we should call it,

01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:15.215
They said, maybe I'm right because, you know, they do have pretty rapidly fading efficacy.

01:42:15.235 --> 01:42:19.559
And if you need another shot in, you know, maybe we shouldn't call them vaccines.

01:42:19.599 --> 01:42:21.520
Maybe we should call them something else.

01:42:21.621 --> 01:42:25.564
No, we should call them transfections because they are transfections.

01:42:25.604 --> 01:42:27.206
You see the problem?

01:42:29.793 --> 01:42:41.877
And so just to remind you, I played you this clip almost two and a half years ago for the first time to tell you that the illusion of consensus, an illusion of consensus can be created on even sitcoms.

01:42:41.937 --> 01:42:42.557
We ready to go?

01:42:42.697 --> 01:42:44.158
Yes, please, please let's go.

01:42:45.098 --> 01:42:46.779
We're in the mood for a cheeseburger.

01:42:46.899 --> 01:42:48.139
No, we gotta go to the soup place.

01:42:48.519 --> 01:42:49.620
What soup place?

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.680
There's a soup stand.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:51.700
Kramer's been going there.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.741
He's always raving.

01:42:52.761 --> 01:42:56.742
I finally got a chance to go there the other day and I tell you this, you will be stunned.

01:42:57.375 --> 01:42:58.356
Stunned by soup?

01:42:58.696 --> 01:43:00.317
You can't eat this soup standing up.

01:43:00.377 --> 01:43:01.138
Your knees buckle.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.721
There's only one caveat.

01:43:05.842 --> 01:43:09.825
The guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure.

01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:13.048
He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.

01:43:14.429 --> 01:43:14.609
Why?

01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:16.050
What happens if you don't order right?

01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:17.671
He yells and you don't get your soup.

01:43:18.232 --> 01:43:18.492
What?

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.374
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.

01:43:21.394 --> 01:43:21.955
All right, all right.

01:43:22.075 --> 01:43:23.236
Let's go over that again.

01:43:23.356 --> 01:43:23.756
All right.

01:43:23.977 --> 01:43:26.939
As you walk in the forest, move immediately to your right.

01:43:28.562 --> 01:43:29.443
It's pretty funny, right?

01:43:29.483 --> 01:43:30.384
Oh boy, I'm really scared.

01:43:47.085 --> 01:44:05.631
What I'm suggesting to you is, is that without this illusion of consensus about a novel virus that killed millions of people, that millions more were saved from, that might've come from a laboratory and could definitely come again, without this illusion of consensus, the young college kids in 2020 and 2021 would have not been misled.

01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:07.632
And in 2021 and 2022, they would have not transfected themselves.

01:44:14.554 --> 01:44:39.314
And in 2022, parents would not have transfected their young kids if this illusion of consensus created by these people that were put in place many years before the pandemic, because they knew that this rise in all-cause mortality was coming, and they knew it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reorganize the thought structure of Western civilization.

01:44:46.127 --> 01:44:59.802
That's the reason why a book-selling law professor had a very limited spectrum of understanding of what might have caused it in her son and a limited spectrum of answers that she offered

01:45:01.050 --> 01:45:17.465
and why she was put opposite somebody like Paul Offit in 2015 and has not made any progress in sharpening the biological message that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:20.788
And so to allow pharmaceutical companies to do that,

01:45:21.488 --> 01:45:28.070
under some guise of mandate with zero liability for even making a pure product, this is just absurd.

01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:35.653
And there's no way you can tell me that Mary Holland couldn't have adequately explained that at least once in the last 10 years, and she has not.

01:45:37.578 --> 01:45:38.699
neither is CHD.

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.020
CHD is now really excited.

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:41.520
Let's read.

01:45:41.981 --> 01:45:45.202
Dear Jonathan, this is what momentum looks like in case you missed it.

01:45:45.262 --> 01:45:50.305
Newsweek just ran an op-ed for everything you and CHD have been demanding for years.

01:45:50.365 --> 01:45:57.069
The end of public health agency corruption and the end of childhood chronic disease epidemic.

01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:58.630
Is that really what Laura Bono

01:46:00.485 --> 01:46:08.411
And that was her founding idea was to sit in front of Bobby's house and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:46:08.371 --> 01:46:10.993
's house with a box full of primary sources.

01:46:11.873 --> 01:46:15.836
And her idea was to end the chronic disease epidemic.

01:46:15.896 --> 01:46:17.417
Is that what CHD was doing?

01:46:19.999 --> 01:46:21.280
I don't think that's it at all.

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:28.126
It was remarkable to see the mainstream media run an article laden with scathing criticism of our public health institutions and their utter failure.

01:46:28.846 --> 01:46:30.707
to protect kids.

01:46:30.767 --> 01:46:33.168
Is that what public health institutions are supposed to do?

01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.809
Protect kids?

01:46:34.449 --> 01:46:42.554
Even more stunning, I mean, because if public health institutions are supposed to protect kids, maybe they're also supposed to protect kids from their parents.

01:46:43.975 --> 01:46:44.455
Right, Mary?

01:46:44.595 --> 01:46:47.977
I mean, the language that she uses is very curious.

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:53.200
Even more stunning, the author was none other than the former director of the CDC.

01:46:54.810 --> 01:47:02.416
In under 800 words, Robert Redfield highlighted the corruption you and CHD have fought so many years to expose.

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:16.006
He called out the poisoning of our food with pesticides, the royalties NIH scientists collect from big pharma, the cozy relationships between industries and the agencies that are supposed to regulate them.

01:47:19.352 --> 01:47:24.295
And so at the end of the letter, she says, we have a real chance at ending agency capture.

01:47:24.895 --> 01:47:30.519
So it sounds like she wants to fix the CDC and the FDA and the education department and the NIH.

01:47:30.539 --> 01:47:31.539
She wants to fix them.

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.441
She wants to fix public health.

01:47:36.723 --> 01:47:40.625
Because again, you know, the public health is supposed to protect kids.

01:47:46.578 --> 01:47:49.779
Does Ralph Hazlehorst work for CHD anymore?

01:47:50.679 --> 01:47:51.499
Ralph Hazlehorst?

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.020
I don't know.

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.180
Does he work for them anymore?

01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:54.300
Somebody should find out.

01:47:55.741 --> 01:48:00.642
Because I think they're lying about murder and lies that they expected, you know, this deaths to happen.

01:48:00.682 --> 01:48:02.663
And so they swept a few together in New York.

01:48:03.502 --> 01:48:05.304
and called it a pandemic around the world.

01:48:05.925 --> 01:48:12.551
That's why there are very good explanations for how PCR can be highly accurate and also a complete lie for SARS-CoV-2.

01:48:13.152 --> 01:48:18.257
That's how the population pyramid provided that opportunity for them to create this illusion.

01:48:18.297 --> 01:48:19.438
They knew this was going to happen.

01:48:19.479 --> 01:48:21.160
They only needed to make it a little steeper.

01:48:22.021 --> 01:48:23.463
And how useful is that, right?

01:48:23.483 --> 01:48:26.165
I mean, we wouldn't want to take care of these people for five more years.

01:48:27.341 --> 01:48:48.766
And finally, virology can definitely be a lie, but the reason why Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan, who also had books around the same time that Mary and everybody else was selling books before the pandemic, like James Lyons Wyler was selling a book before the pandemic, the reason why they haven't been able to get that ball across the finish line is because their job is not to do that.

01:48:49.146 --> 01:48:56.808
Otherwise, they would have stolen this from me a long time ago and said that transfection and transformation can be done in cell culture and in animals,

01:48:57.288 --> 01:49:04.017
And a lot of the sort of experimental measurements that can be done in that context have been misconstrued as virology.

01:49:04.077 --> 01:49:07.881
And Jonathan's totally right about that because RNA can out-pandemic.

01:49:08.578 --> 01:49:27.960
But of course, we're not going to get there because they are part of this show, part of this really, really awful malevolent show that is covering up murder and lies in America and the Western world and misconstruing what was to be an expected rise in all-cause mortality as an ongoing

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:36.089
public health crisis for which we're eventually going to need digital ID and digital currency and a patrolled internet.

01:49:36.369 --> 01:49:38.551
And we need to advocate against that.

01:49:38.591 --> 01:49:44.518
Ladies and gentlemen, if you liked what you saw, please go to GigaOMBiological.com, a semi-renewed website.

01:49:44.558 --> 01:49:45.879
A little bit, things have changed.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.362
I realized that I actually have a mailing list there, which is really extraordinary.

01:49:50.402 --> 01:49:53.524
I sent out the first check email a couple of days ago.

01:49:53.584 --> 01:49:55.665
I have gotten a couple, please take me off your list.

01:49:55.725 --> 01:49:56.605
You're a crazy person.

01:49:57.606 --> 01:50:00.187
But other than that, it seems like everybody's reading me loud and clear.

01:50:00.207 --> 01:50:05.090
I think I'm gonna use that email list to announce streams starting next week.

01:50:05.130 --> 01:50:12.373
So you'll get some idea maybe on Monday, Tuesday, whenever I'm gonna go on in the morning, I'll already let you know at 6 a.m.

01:50:12.413 --> 01:50:13.234
that I'm gonna go on at 10.

01:50:14.114 --> 01:50:16.975
or let you know at 10 that I'm going to go on at 1 or something like that.

01:50:17.015 --> 01:50:21.517
And that might work better than the instantaneous notifications you get from Twitch.

01:50:21.557 --> 01:50:22.958
And we'll see how that goes right now.

01:50:22.998 --> 01:50:29.280
If you're not on that list, just go to GiggleAndBiological.com and enter your email in any one of those places, either on the

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.483
Contact form or the the email box or whatever.

01:50:33.523 --> 01:50:36.705
They all go to the same place I just didn't understand where that place was.

01:50:36.765 --> 01:50:37.886
So I apologize for that.

01:50:38.307 --> 01:50:48.054
It's a one-man show I don't know what to tell you My wife is starting to help again feel is starting to write emails and stuff like that, but that's gonna take time to ramp up Thanks very much for joining me.

01:50:48.134 --> 01:50:55.239
Sorry about that And I will hopefully see you tomorrow if all goes well tomorrow's Friday I love it.

01:50:55.479 --> 01:50:56.040
Thank you very much

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.361
I mean, it's just impossible.

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:44.450
It is impossible that all these people are now on the same team, that Mary Holland is on the same team as Kevin McKernan, the same team as Robert Malone, the same team as Meryl Nass, the same team as Jessica Rose.

01:51:44.490 --> 01:51:52.934
They were all put in place before and during the beginning of the pandemic, and that's why they've all come together at this time to rally in DC.

01:51:52.994 --> 01:51:53.395
It's just...

01:51:54.475 --> 01:52:03.743
I just worry that maybe Bobby's being misled by these people and thereby potentially Trump and his team will be misled by these people.

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:07.446
I mean, that's the best sort of most optimistic appraisal, right?

01:52:07.466 --> 01:52:12.810
I mean, you can be totally negative and say that there's nobody coming to save us and I wouldn't argue with you.

01:52:13.911 --> 01:52:19.836
But right now, I think there are still some unwitting participants and that means that there's still hope that

01:52:20.496 --> 01:52:36.099
More people will will help break the narrative And if we break the narrative who knows what can happen right because once the cruise ship starts turning And is going somewhere than other than they want it to Then all bets are off and that's that's what I'm hoping for.

01:52:36.139 --> 01:52:40.560
That's what I'm praying for Let's turn the cruise ship together ladies and gentlemen.

01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.340
I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:52:45.701 --> 01:52:48.842
I Have no responsibility for the current pandemic
