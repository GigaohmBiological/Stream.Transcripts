WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
I think here we took the light turn shaking, sure.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We took this road and turned to the right.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
No wonder we're lost.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
You've been reading the map upside down.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Stop lying!

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Welcome to the show.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It's 8th of September, 2023.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Good to see you this evening.

02:01.000 --> 02:24.000
There probably was no spread in New York City.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Infectious clones are probably the only real threat.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
The SIBO batches were likely distributed to confuse us a little more.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And transfection, healthy mammals is dumb.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Protocols were murdered, gained a function as a mythology.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
The Scooby-Doo is real.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
You have been fooled into thinking you've solved this mystery

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
and the players are committed to the lies.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You're just going to have to cover terms with it.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
They're going to look you right in the face.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
While they tell you they love you, they're going to lie to you.

02:58.000 --> 03:15.000
MUSIC

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Right to your face, they're going to lie to you.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And that's why we've got to keep vigilant.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
That's why we've got to keep vigilant.

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
I can't stress enough how important it is to go forward with your heart wide open.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Feel what people are saying.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And if you don't trust them, then stop watching.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's really that simple.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Because we are at a stage where you've only got about...

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
You've only got so many waking hours in the day.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And if you don't manage your brain well enough, you're going to become a depressed animal.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
And if you want to know, anybody is trying to shoulder that weight for you.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It's me.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
And what you see happening before you is the slow withering of somebody who used to believe

04:08.000 --> 04:17.000
that America and biology and life was nothing but excitement and positivity and promise.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And while I still want to believe that for my children and for my grandchildren,

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
I am disturbed to realize that we are three years into this and we are not as far as I hope we would be.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But there is a light.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
There is a shining light in this tunnel.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I assure you.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And that is that if you just follow the rule of ignoring the television,

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
if you follow the rule of ignoring the bait on social media, Twitter is so awful.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm trying to move exclusively to my soapbox.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
And I'm just going to clip pictures from soapbox and post them on Twitter.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
For the people that like to follow me on Twitter, I'm very, very sorry.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But it's just too much awfulness there.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And it is really designed that way.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
And couple that with the fact that we give away so much of what we're thinking when we're on that platform.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
I think it's best if you just show up there, you take a crap and you leave.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
I hate that place and I don't want to hate anything anymore.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm sure these people have changed the way we think about certain things in biology

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
and that led to certain calamities over the last three years.

05:35.000 --> 05:45.000
And I'm just not going to pull any punches anymore because I really believe that the bottom line is

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
that some of these people are responsible.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
And they're responsible because they weren't really fighting to find the way out of the cave.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
They were actually taking advantage of everybody being in the cave and them having some clue

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
as to what was going to be okay to talk about or what was going to be exciting to talk about.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And gaining some comfort.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I don't know what.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
But some of these people were tipped off to the fear and cleavage site in January of 2020.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
I will go so far as to say that anyone that didn't have a coronavirus paper on their CV

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
and was not actively working at a university,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
and you wrote a blog about the fear and cleavage site in January of 2020,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
you need to come forward and admit it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That somebody called you.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Somebody tipped you off.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
If you were talking about spike protein toxicity before anybody was even sure this was a pandemic,

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
some of you definitely need to cop to the fact that you were tipped off.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
And no matter how much of a hero you like to think of yourself as,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
you need to think back and realize that, oh my gosh,

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
I might have been responsible for ceding the panic that they were able to take advantage of,

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
ceded by the theater of New York City, so carefully documented now by Jessica Hockett.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
This aberrant four weeks in New York City that was paraded around the world as the start

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
of worst case scenario as Dr. Kevin McCarran so aptly described it back in February and March of 2020

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
already with such certainty about the coming calamity.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
That's how we got here.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
And you will find that many of the people that are in this diagram have been very accurately

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
characterized by me as being people who should have done known better.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
And it's too late for Brett Weinstein to figure out that anywhere that the LMB takes the RNA

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
that there's a potential for auto immunity.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It's too late.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
I was explaining to that him in his signal chat in 2021 and he ignored me.

08:10.000 --> 08:20.000
And in 2021, that coward had Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his stream in his house.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
And that coward didn't release that podcast until it was cool in 2023.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And I can say a lot about everybody on this side of the graph because of when they came out,

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
how they came out and where they are now.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
None of them questioned the virus.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
None of them questioned the danger and the crisis.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
None of them really questioned the intention of the RNA.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
And none of them questioned the gain of function could be the source of it and it could be the source of it again.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
They're all members of the same faith.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
And it's a very different kind of faith than what I'm talking about here.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
This is a faith that if we are fighting for the sake of heaven, if we are fighting for the sake of truth,

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
not for the sake of victory, then our fight will will stand the test of time.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
And our goals are valid.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And I'm happy to be wrong.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm happy to be wrong, but don't make any mistake about it.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
I have been fighting and working tooth and nail since 2020.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
I have every right to be where I am with the relative confidence that I have.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Because I bend down the other roads.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I explored all those caverns first too.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And they're all dead ends.

09:51.000 --> 10:00.000
And I came back to the center and I'm the one with the flashlight in the front of the cave while everybody's still yelling about rooms back there.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
Those people don't want you out.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I think Nick Hudson wants you out.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I think Mark Koolak wants you out.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I think definitely Jessica Hockett wants you out.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I think Thomas Binder wants you out.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I think Dennis Rancor wants you out.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Denny.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
All the other people on this screen, I'm not so sure.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I hope and pray that Bobby wants us out.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
I hope and pray that Robert Malone wants us out.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But I've been paying attention to people's behavior.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And I've had the privilege of having them pay attention to me.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
And that means I get to see a different kind of behavior that a lot of other people don't see.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And I believe that we are the victim of a very, very deep con.

10:59.000 --> 11:09.000
Lots of people have been conscripted into this con to control the narrative from both sides, whether they know it or not.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Whether they understand the depth and the breadth of the operation or not.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
That is what has been done to us.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
We have been fooled as a society.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Think about that.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
The breadth and the depth of that attack cannot be underestimated.

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
And to think about the potential for how many people are involved and how many different levels.

11:33.000 --> 11:46.000
Everyone on this screen, wittingly or unwittingly, has taken part in the authentication and mystique of the intellectual dark web

11:46.000 --> 11:58.000
and the ones that have prarited and not questioned the faith in the novel virus, the faith in the crisis, the faith in the countermeasures, the faith in the return of a new virus.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
The belief in the mythology of gain of function.

12:01.000 --> 12:12.000
These people and many others have never questioned those tenements.

12:12.000 --> 12:25.000
And that's how the Scooby-Doo works, because you get fooled into thinking that you solved the mystery, you uncovered the monster, and Barrick and Daisyak and Fauci go to jail.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Or maybe the Chinese government gets blamed.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Or maybe we find out it was Ukrainian labs.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
But in the end there's going to be another monster.

12:35.000 --> 12:44.000
In the end we're going to have to have the same panic again with the same mystery of which garage did it come out of.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
And the way out is biology.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
The way out is coming to understand that transfection can never be immunization and we have even learned more than that.

12:54.000 --> 13:07.000
What we've learned is that there's no combination of chemicals that can be justifiably injected intramuscularly to usefully augment an immune system.

13:07.000 --> 13:19.000
Now I'm not going so far as to say that there aren't vaccination methodologies that couldn't impart immunity that's useful to humans and done in the skin, inhaled, maybe even drank,

13:19.000 --> 13:28.000
but do not and repeat do not forget that the immune system is a very special system.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
Do not underestimate the danger of inhaling things to augment your immune system.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Do not underestimate it.

13:39.000 --> 13:49.000
The only way in my humble opinion that you can be immunized safely is either through the skin by variation which I'm not even really sure about.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And the other way would be through the gut.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
Because there in the payer's patches is where the rubber meets the road as far as tolerance and immunity.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
And without that crucial part of the immune system interacting with others, you have nothing.

14:08.000 --> 14:19.000
And that is the basis. That is the reason. That is the why of why you cannot inject somebody in their muscle and usefully augment their immune system.

14:19.000 --> 14:29.000
So everybody that's talking about gain of function viruses and crazy spike proteins with HIV inserts is talking about nothing really.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
Because even if all those stories are true, we don't win by crying about the gain of function virus.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
We don't. We win by no longer complying.

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
We win by no longer allowing them to inject our children by making them test these products.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
That's the only way we win.

14:52.000 --> 15:04.000
All other avenues lead to capitulation, lead to digital IDs, and lead to your children being basically bio-surveiled as slaves for their entire lives.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
That's what's coming.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
And so if you don't believe it, here's Mr. Yee, Michael Yee, aka Mr. Sparkle.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Mr. Sparkle is disrespectful of dirt.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
And in this case, Michael Yee is disrespectful of BS from all sides.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
And I want you to watch and listen carefully for the words that he chooses, the rationales that he makes.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
And listen carefully for when Steve Kirsch talks, because it ain't very often.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And I have a feeling there's a good reason why.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm really excited.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Oh shoot, I did the cut wrong again.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Gosh darn it.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So terrible at this self-direction crap.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Really make this a great turnout.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
All right, so now for Steve's very compelling interview with Dr. Mike Eden.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm going to go over to the Gricketts a little bit.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
He was formerly a chief scientist and vice president at Pfizer's Allergy and Respiratory Research Division.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Went on to form his own biotech company.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
However, in the wake of COVID-19, Dr. Yee has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of the COVID-19 quote vaccines, end quote.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
And the broader vaccine agenda propagated by big pharma.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
He has of course been the object of their attacks, but he is a trusted and important voice in our movement.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
So let's take a listen.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Hey Mike, it's good to talk to you again.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Steve, great to be with you here today.

16:48.000 --> 16:59.000
So you probably have an interesting story to tell in terms of what you'd like people listening to this broadcast to know.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So what's kind of on the top of your mind right now?

17:02.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah, so people probably know that I'm a lifetime professional research scientist.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Always wants to do that since I was a kid.

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
Properly qualified, full career in big pharma and then 10 years independent and biotech did very well.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
So I was enjoying it with a light consulting when we were told a pandemic had begun in 2020.

17:29.000 --> 17:40.000
And I think famously I realized very early on that people I faintly knew of on the telly because I've been around so long that I know some of the people in public health.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
They were lying.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
So I didn't say that first of all, but I realized they were using things like PCR tests.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
I knew just about enough of those to know like with any test you have to do internal controls.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
There was no sign of any of that.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
And so I smelled a rat early on and that I probably became infamous on Twitter,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
arguing the talks about PCR tests and no one cares.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
And it's occurred to me later in the year that they were not only lying about these diagnostic tests,

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
but in my view about absolutely every other part of the narrative, including masking,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
asymptomatic transmission, lockdowns, border closures, all that sort of stuff.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
And so later in the year, I think I became the first person using the L word.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
They are lying because if scientists give their opinion,

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
and Graham's pumber on the telly with the tie and the title is saying something else,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
they'll never take.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
They'll never, the public won't weigh those things.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
If you say they're lying and here's why, or here's how, you got a chance.

18:42.000 --> 18:49.000
And so, and I'm afraid, yeah, I've noticed that the authorities have been lying continuously.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Whether there was, I don't believe there was a pandemic, but let's say there was something.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
It was no more serious than flu.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Do we ever close the world down for flu?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
No, we don't close the world down for flu.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
So straight away folks, whether you believe there has been a pandemic or has not been a pandemic,

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
some great and powerful people have closed the world down based on a public health hazard

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
that is not abnormal.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
And then the persuaded banjoed, coerced, and sometimes mandated used to roll a sleeve up

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
to take a completely novel concoction, a so-called gene-based, gene-based vaccines.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I don't think of them as vaccines.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
And I knew because of my toxicology and drug discovery and experience that these things,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
if they did anything at all, would be harmful and said so.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
That's when my world fell in.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
In early December 2020, I'd been banjoed a bit on Twitter by presumably paid trolls and people

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
who had just disagreed with me.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
But that's when the National Broadcaster and several well-known journalists decided that

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
they'd have enough of me and were going to tell me off.

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
So that's when I became the anti-vaxxer darling or whatever it is.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
And basically, I've said to people, this is an important thing to say,

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
my radar, my job is to join dots.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
That's what I've always done on my life.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And it's probably about the only thing I was unusually good at.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
So I often see patterns in sparse data before other people do.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Danger of that is sometimes I see patterns that aren't there.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
But if you're forming the patterns and you're doubling back on yourself,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I tend to be ahead.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
So my mind is usually several months ahead of my mouth.

20:40.000 --> 20:49.000
So by summer of 2020, I was alluding in interviews to the possibility that if somebody

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
wanted to poison a significant proportion of population that could come up with a better

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
way than lying about a pandemic and saying, here's a medicine.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
I already knew by the end of March 2020 that the only thing that made sense to shut the

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
world down, therefore with enormous financial consequences when it was not necessary,

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
that meant the owners of assets and capital must have signed the box for that.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
You must have signed that off.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Why would they do that?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And I came to the conclusion and I think that was right.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Control was the reward.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Digital control.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
By the end of the year, I could see it's as simple as this.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
I think there may be more than this, but just from the biology,

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
I believe the perpetrators intend to require us to carry mandatory digital ID.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Hopefully in your hand rather than inside your forehead, but I wouldn't count on it being

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
limited to a device in your hand and then cashless central bank digital currencies.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's all that's required.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
That is all that's required to remove every last wisp of your freedom because if I'm running

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
this and I say, I'm going to require digital ID, valid digital ID before you do anything

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
before you buy anything.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
He's not running right now.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
It's all across any regulated threshold.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
And if I define value as up to date with the latest WHO recommended inverse commerce

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
vaccines, that's all I need to remove all of your freedom permanently.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
And it's quite shocking when you realize it would take only two or three acts.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
If we didn't react, I'm not sure any of us are going to have enough of us will react.

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
For example, in Britain, the Bank I banked with national Westminster, I've been with

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
them for 40 something years, and they just likely announced last week that as from then September,

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
they're going to reduce the amount of cash a customer can obtain every day from the bank

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
regardless of their balance.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
It's at £250.

23:01.000 --> 23:09.000
And I think when did the bank last decide how much of my post-tax money I may obtain?

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
So I went into the bank to reminisce straight in the start so that we didn't know anything

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
about it.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
But it's on their website.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So they're about to do it.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
There are no pitchforks and torches in the street.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
This is how they get us.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
So I've made sure I've got plenty of cash and non-cash equivalents because at some point

23:33.000 --> 23:42.000
I think people's money will be stolen in some way through banking crisis or whatever.

23:42.000 --> 23:50.000
So if you want to carry on using a live outside the system, then you'll need some means of

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
exchange that's not dependent on whatever restrictions they put in place.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So I think that's where we're going.

23:57.000 --> 24:04.000
Some other friends who are cleverer than me in military matters are concerned that there

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
could be a more could be precipitated or food shortages.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
I've nothing to say yes or no on those things.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
What do I know?

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
But in terms of the controller agenda, I think what I've described is seems like a

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
relatively close and the clues are there, aren't they?

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
The WHO and the European Union announced last month that they were going to adopt the EU

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
would adopt this sort of travel pass which will contain your health status.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
So that's I think vaccine passport at some point, which is unnecessary of course.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
And then like I've just said, the bank is making it harder to obtain and to use cash.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
So it's like it's converging on the spot I pointed to.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
And I've already made my decision and I recommend to people that you don't need a digital

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
ID.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
I don't need a digital ID and your whole life has been lived in a law abiding successful way

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
without digital ID for every sort of zero trust society that they're talking about.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
So I've resolved not to sign up for it.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
And if I'm told that's the end of your access to money, then so be it.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
I believe this is this machine is one that will be used kilowatt of people and I'm not

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
going to step into the machine.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's what I'm not going to do.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
And I'll keep speaking because I was discussing with your assistant.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I characterise every day and a brave person dies only once.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
I may not be accurate in every deduction I make.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I always say to people, I don't have a copy of the script.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
But I'm sincere in what I'm saying.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It's complete nonsense, isn't it?

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
I mean, the shutting the world down for a few like illness, even if it was a multiple of

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
its lethality is mad, but they've done it everywhere.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
And that means that's proved positive.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
The national activity, right, straight away in March 2020, super national activity.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
Because how could 160 countries decide at once to do the same crazy,

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
unprecedented, not in their pandemic preparedness plan restrictions?

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
And the answer is that it was agreed at a level above.

26:29.000 --> 26:38.000
And there were loads of tabletop simulations of this kind of event,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
including famously event 201 in 2019.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
But these started in the late 90s.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
And there have been tabletop simulations of pandemics and bioterror.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I think there's like 15 of them run by Johns Hopkins,

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
Bellarmine, the Gates, the US military, and increasingly senior ministers in each

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
of the Western countries and eventually including China.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
So there's been a lot of rehearsal for this.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And I'm not convinced.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
I'll put my stick my neck out and say, I don't think severe respiratory illness

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
pandemics are possible.

27:21.000 --> 27:29.000
And that's because you're not infectious until you're loaded with whatever the pathogen is.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And when you are, you are symptomatic.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
That is ill and you withdraw from circulation.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
And the worse it is, the more quickly and more categorically you withdraw and that terminates

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
transmission.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
So the idea that there could be a like flying Ebola,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I mean, you wouldn't want to catch it.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Probably killing it, assuming it's real.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
But it's not going to spread very far.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Because these people who get Ebola or whatever it's got, whatever it is,

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
they get sick apparently, really ill the same day that they contact the person with the

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
symptoms and often they're dead the next day.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
So you're not going to be breezing around, you know, Kmart and buying gasoline and going

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
to have the only true apartheid.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
So you're not going to be infecting very many people.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And that's the whole point.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
There's a R0 R0 transmission number is great with things that leave you symptom free for

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
a long time.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
But you're not, I just don't believe in respiratory illnesses that people are symptomatic.

28:34.000 --> 28:43.000
Sorry, are infectious unless they're symptomatic because they both pivot on a common factor,

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
which is a long full of pathogen and both, you know, both situations to be a good source

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
of infection.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
You have to have a lot of it and you will have symptoms.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
That's according to the narrative.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
I, as you've heard, I want to say I've had a conversion and I'm not sure of the sort of

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
no virus arguments.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
But I don't believe there's been a pandemic that set me apart from quite a few people.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm a scientist and I'm following the data.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
So the reason I say it, the reason I say it, it's just one, one reason.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It's nothing to do with the no virus arguments.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
It's nothing to do with whether it's been isolated or not, nothing at all.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
It's wholly down to the epidemiological work of Dennis Rancourt and his colleagues who

29:33.000 --> 29:42.000
looked at all course mortality, asking only the date of a death, the sex and age of the

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
person who died, and they collected data from each of the 50 states every week.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
And I think they've done at least three years' worth.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
And there was no pandemics to use.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
There was no increase in all course mortality anywhere until WHO called the pandemic.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
And then as we know, mad protocols were introduced in hospitals like mass ventilation.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm a respiratory guy.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I understand a bit about that.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Listen to this.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Listen to this.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
If you have an open airway, you haven't got asthma or an object in your throat.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
So if you can breathe in and out through your airway and you haven't been stabbed or shot or crushed.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So your chest wardens intact.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
You never, ever sedate, intubate and ventilate.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Unless it's for something like elective surgery.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
You don't do it for flu.

30:32.000 --> 30:41.000
So when tens or hundreds of thousands of people were subjected to this treatment, I knew that that was going to end badly.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
And then these poor souls were also given intravenous remdesivir in the US, I believe, from a company called Gilead.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
And the material is poisonous.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
And that combination of a very stressful mechanical ventilation is life saving.

30:59.000 --> 31:08.000
When you come in with a head injury and you're not breathing or, you know, or as I say, elective surgery or perhaps your burns and you need to be stated.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
It's a lifesaver.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
It's and the trade-offs of risks for your pulmonary health are definitely worth it.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
But a person who comes in anxious, short, short of breath and so on.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Give them an oxygen mask and half a valium tablet and put them on around them.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
You definitely don't do what they did.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
But that was mandated.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So I knew that was going to happen.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Give them a half a valium and put your arm around.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
That's brilliant.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Oh, it's brilliant.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
People were given my jazz 11 morphine in Britain for short, which is two thirds of the lethal injection I've used in some US states.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
My PhD was in the effects of opiates on respiration.

31:45.000 --> 31:53.000
So I knew that my jazz 11 morphine was, you shouldn't give, if you give that to unattended elderly, somewhat frail people.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Most of them will have stopped for you to give enough of those.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Steve is speechless.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
It's contrary indicated, except in your high dependency setting.

32:03.000 --> 32:10.000
So the fact that we're giving them to tens of thousands of elderly folk and care homes is that's mass murder.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Sorry.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
And then look at Steve.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
There was a long running controversy.

32:16.000 --> 32:25.000
It's like a jet in front of a industry about whether or not it was appropriate to give antibiotics for people who had a chesty cough after they'd had a cold or something.

32:25.000 --> 32:32.000
We usually do it because on the precautionary principle, if you don't and they get pneumonia, they could die in a few days.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
So, but people were saying, well, we've never done the controlled trial.

32:36.000 --> 32:54.000
They have now because during 2020, on all sorts of fraudulent grounds, doctors were instructed pretty much to withhold antibiotics from people who had a positive COVID test on the grounds that antibiotics don't kill viruses.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
It's like, that's true.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
But people who've had one acute episode often follow it with bacteria on pneumonia.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
That's well known.

33:03.000 --> 33:15.000
And so they halved the number of prescriptions for antibiotics, chest infections, and people, young people as well, just died in their very, so tough way to get the experiment done.

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
But that's those with us three main methods. I call that Iatrogenic murder.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
I don't think a new path doesn't kill anybody. I could be wrong, but there's no evidence for it.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Well, no, that's not true.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
There's lots of bits of evidence, most of which I think is fraudulent.

33:34.000 --> 33:44.000
Molecular biology is the best biological science to cheat in because it nearly all involves computers, algorithms, assumptions.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
It's a bit of tissue twitching or an animal breathing or not breathing.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
You get a bunch of code.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
And even when they do sequencing, it's not what you think it is.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
It doesn't do what you think it does.

33:58.000 --> 34:06.000
Next generation sequencing, for example, is just, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a mad lottery that's decoded using software.

34:06.000 --> 34:17.000
And I remember when I was in the industry speaking to experts, I said, this is, this just strikes me as statistical, statistical, like, this is like probabilistic pharmacology.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
And they said, yeah, that's right.

34:20.000 --> 34:34.000
So I, anyway, so the fact that there was not an increase in all cause mortality when this virus was supposed to be sweeping across Western Europe and America tells me,

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
and also I'd say to Steve, that we, I think we would agree that authorities lied to us about masking.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
They lied to us about the spirit of public health emergency.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
The lie to us about the necessity is still going testing.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
They lied about asymptomatic transmission.

34:49.000 --> 34:56.000
They lied about the needs for border closes, small business closes, exception, et cetera, et cetera.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
So the same people, some of those lying down on that line.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
They're the people who told us there's a novel, novel virus.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
And yet the all cause mortality data says there's nothing unusual happening in the spring.

35:09.000 --> 35:16.000
So I think it's a real stretch to go and find, find a virus.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
And I think, again, I've said to people, I'm not going to fight people on our inside.

35:21.000 --> 35:30.000
We've got enough bloody common greeze things running against us that let's not fall out over this stuff.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Or if you want to, I'll let you fall out.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But that's where I've got to.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
I've said before that I'm not clever enough to follow the so-called no virus arguments completely.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
And also I know people who work in virology.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
I've explained this to them and they said, no, no, you don't understand Mike.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
And then they start talking in deep technical terms.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
And they've said, I know that virus X and Y exist because I work top.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
And I think, you know what, I'm not going to gain to say these people.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
So that's where I get caught.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
I look at the data for the pandemic.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
If no viruses really exist, I'm not clever enough to make the arguments.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
That is a great way to pass that buck.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
And I may even start using it.

36:21.000 --> 36:31.000
But for him to do it that way and for anyone, for anyone to do it that way is perfectly legit.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Why?

36:32.000 --> 36:42.000
Because you're only not consenting to be governed by that premise that there are viruses that can threaten the world.

36:42.000 --> 36:55.000
Even if, even if your stance is, I don't, I'm not smart enough to understand if that phenomenon is possible, but I will not be governed by it.

36:55.000 --> 37:05.000
And I really think it's an important thing to take away from this because you don't ever need to get into the weeds with anyone about if there's a virus or not.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You can if you want to.

37:07.000 --> 37:26.000
And I think it's a very interesting discussion to have with somebody who wants to have it with you in earnest, who wants to talk about the lack that pure missing data at this size scale and our horrible inability to analyze at this size scale.

37:26.000 --> 37:43.000
If somebody's really willing to talk about it, it's a great and wonderful discussion about how complex biology is and about how difficult it is to distill it down further than where we have it right now, just because our tools can't allow us to.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And that's okay.

37:45.000 --> 37:53.000
Because there are many biologists out there that think there is a complexity beyond which we're not really going to penetrate.

37:54.000 --> 38:04.000
Because when you remove a piece, it doesn't work anymore. So there are no evolutionary steps that lead to an airplane.

38:04.000 --> 38:12.000
And so at some moment, you've got to realize that there might be something more here, whatever it is.

38:12.000 --> 38:22.000
And whatever it is, there's going to be a lot of this biology that we're never going to understand because it's layers and layers of complexity.

38:22.000 --> 38:30.000
And so even if we think we can see how the gears are working together, we can't see it across time and space, my friends.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
We can't see it across generations.

38:34.000 --> 38:49.000
And so we've got to come to terms with the fact that these kinds of cartoons that are flying behind my head, they're all imaginary ways of mystifying you to make you think that the computers have solved how proteins fold.

38:49.000 --> 38:57.000
Or that we know how viruses and exosomes and the immune system all work together.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
We don't.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
And so it's okay to say, I'm not clever enough to make that argument because in reality, probably none of us are.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
And in fact, I'm kind of making that argument.

39:11.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm kind of making the argument that if you really argue in earnest and you argue with honest, forthright admission of what's real and what's not, you have to acknowledge the swarm.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
You have to acknowledge clones.

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
You have to acknowledge the preponderance of particles that appear to be not infectious.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
You have to acknowledge the ridiculous cartoon of the infectious cycle.

39:37.000 --> 39:46.000
You have to acknowledge the ridiculous cartoon of next generation sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.

39:46.000 --> 40:00.000
And you have to acknowledge the fact that we've gone from almost unable to track them to being able to apparently track one all around the world for years and years.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Mike Eden just mopped the floor with Steve and he's going to continue to do it.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't make the argument, but we've been lied to definitely.

40:11.000 --> 40:29.000
And the perpetrators meant us harm initially, because as soon as the pandemic was called, they changed hospital care home and community treatments that predictably resulted in hundreds of thousands of innocent people using their lives.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I mean, I think they were murdered.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I had a gigantic murder.

40:33.000 --> 40:41.000
And then while that was going on, a bunch of people in my former industry of which I'm going to have thoroughly ashamed.

40:41.000 --> 40:47.000
I wouldn't, I was dropped by all my consulting funds in the summer of 2020.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
I didn't mind them doing that.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I didn't need their money.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
And you know what?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I didn't need them contacted me now.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
I would say screw you, you know, don't work for a crooked industry.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
And so I feel embarrassed that I didn't realize it wasn't all crooked.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I, I, I assure you, there are some very good drugs.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
I think it got crooked around the turn of the century.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
And I can even remember, I think we were running out of drug targets, Steve, and management realized we couldn't produce the output required.

41:17.000 --> 41:26.000
And some clever people came up with molecular biological ways to make, to identify and validate new targets quickly.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
And it was like the human genome project sequencing whole humans.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
And that's faster and faster.

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
And they said, if we can sequence whole, whole organisms and do high throughput screening.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Mark, do you hear it?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Okay.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Game of function is something I've even done.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
You, if you, if you have a protein, you don't even know what it does.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
You can, you can do what's called an alanine, an alanine scan.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
So you change all the side change one after another.

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
Position one, two, three, four, five, you sequence, you change it from alanine, which is normally a small, non-polar thing.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And you see, does that change the function?

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
And often it does.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
It's a, and anyway, so senior management persuaded the board that if we spent all these dollars on,

42:10.000 --> 42:18.000
I think Pfizer made a big six investments in sort of bioinformatics, screening, human genome and stuff.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
I remember speaking to people at the time and I'm saying, this process requires what I call a Tamobox Steve.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
You're moving from the left to the right.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
You've got information on the right is the pot of gold.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Tamob stands for then a miracle occurs.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
It's like you couldn't logically follow all the steps and have any real chance of getting a drug.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
And I only know of one drug that emerged out of that, out of that investment.

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
And dammit, it's supposedly treats HIV that I think is fraudulent.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
You know, I'm afraid HIV was made up by the people.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
She's joking.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That has made this up.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
But so that's like an end of anyway.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
So like it's just to be clear, it hasn't been a pandemic.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I can't comment on whether or not someone's got something in a test tube.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
And I'm not willing to make some statement about the entire cast.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Okay, I think it's really important to point out right here before I forget it.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
And before Mark puts down his phone or wherever you're listening, Mark.

43:25.000 --> 43:49.000
Realize that what Michael just said was that at certain point in the 90s or whenever they were running out of drug targets about the same time that the human genome project starts and finishes and gives these people all kinds of new drug targets that they can make antibodies to

43:50.000 --> 43:57.000
And target them and patent the methodologies by which they generate those antibodies and boom.

43:57.000 --> 44:09.000
There's this explosion of intellectual property that's based on the NIH decoding the human genome and giving them all these novel targets.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Did you hear it?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
That's exactly what he said.

44:16.000 --> 44:24.000
It's really wonderful. I guess is the best thing I've ever listened to in the last like month and a half period of pathogens. I'm not clever enough.

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
That's what I'll stop. But nasty people are coming at us. The evidence for that was very clear very early.

44:30.000 --> 44:39.000
And I say that I think the last conscious decision, the last decision that you have to make folks that's not.

44:40.000 --> 44:52.000
That's not that after this, all the other things that the crooks don't require your consent. So I think the last thing they need of you is to sign up for digital ID.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
And it's appearing in certain US states when I was still living in Florida.

44:56.000 --> 45:04.000
They said it'll be very convenient. You can combine your health records and your driver's license and whatever your Starbucks loyalty card.

45:04.000 --> 45:12.000
Before you know it, they'll have everything on that. And you'll be required to show it to get gasoline to enter a store or at least to buy anything in the store.

45:12.000 --> 45:24.000
And then ultimately to enter a mall. It's so easy to search out of that out of that investment. And it's supposedly to treat HIV that I think is fraudulent.

45:25.000 --> 45:33.000
You know, I'm afraid HIV was made up by the people, including fancy.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
That has made this up. But so that's like an end of anyway.

45:38.000 --> 45:45.000
So like it's just to be clear, it hasn't been a pandemic. I can't comment on whether or not someone's got something in a test.

45:46.000 --> 45:55.000
And I'm not willing to make some statement about the entire category of pathogens. I'm not clever enough. So that's where I'll stop.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
But nasty people are coming at us. The evidence for that was very clear very early.

46:01.000 --> 46:10.000
And I say that I think the last conscious decision, the last decision that you have to make, folks, that's not.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
That's not that after this, all the other things that the crooks don't require your consent.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
So I think the last thing they need of you is to sign up for digital ID.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
And it's appearing in certain US states when I was still living in Florida.

46:26.000 --> 46:34.000
They said it'll be very convenient. You can combine your health records and your driver's license and whatever your Starbucks loyalty card.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
Before you know it, they'll have everything on that. And you'll be required to show it to get gasoline to enter.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
And just make sure that all the Americans in the audience understand that that ID is a real ID.

46:45.000 --> 46:55.000
So in Pennsylvania, all your driver's license will be necessarily converted to a real ID driver's license this year or next year.

46:55.000 --> 47:03.000
And what that means is it'll have a chip in it just like your passport does that has the capability of storing any amount of data.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
I don't know how much, but enough for there to be records on there.

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
And so that's already mandatory. And it's been mandatory for years already.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
Florida just happened to already have it in place when the pandemic started.

47:19.000 --> 47:28.000
So it became very ironic that people were leaving New York to avoid the mandates and converting their driver's license to the real ID of Florida,

47:28.000 --> 47:35.000
not realizing that they had just taken a step closer to the totalitarian nightmare

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
by moving away from New York and converting their driver's license in Florida.

47:40.000 --> 47:47.000
And that's the whole trick of DeSantis. In case you didn't know, he's totally on board with this too.

47:47.000 --> 47:57.000
That's why he plays along so well and his script fits so well with everybody else's.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
And sort of store or at least buy anything in the store and then ultimately to enter a mall.

48:03.000 --> 48:10.000
It's so easy to see. Don't sign up for it. You don't need it. They need you to have it.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
If enough of us refuse and just say, well, thanks very much for the convenience of that.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
I'm going to stick where I am. That will force them to become more aggressive and that will wait more people up.

48:21.000 --> 48:30.000
So I think the strategy of perpetrators is never to do anything that will activate more than a small percentage of the population at any one time.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
And it's been pretty successful. So please don't sign up for digital ID.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
If they say, oh, you won't be able to do certain things.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Did you go? Dang it.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
That's not what I wanted to have happen. So I want to go back. Did you catch that? What he said really makes us agree.

48:47.000 --> 48:58.000
What he said with regard to they're doing things right now not to get too many people riled up at any one time.

48:58.000 --> 49:08.000
And I think that's a very important thing to understand from the perspective of looking around and watching things happen now and watching how different groups get ignited at different times.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
It's exactly intended to be this way because the ignition of one group is kind of the yin and the yang for another group.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
And so everybody's getting jerked around. It's kind of like getting jerked around by the collar.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
And they're doing that to everyone. And they're forcing parents to do it to their kids.

49:28.000 --> 49:39.000
And we cannot continue to participate. But as the people in the chat are saying, there's no way realistically without really dropping out.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
You're going to have to at some point make the choice of not flying anymore.

49:43.000 --> 49:56.000
That's one of the scary things for me and my family is that as the inevitable decline of air travel happens, which it is definitely going to be orchestrated to happen over the next few years.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
We're going to have to make a choice about where we're going to live and then we're going to stay there.

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
And we have a very big extended family here and a very big extended family in the Netherlands.

50:08.000 --> 50:16.000
And my wife has been away from her extended family for a long time. There's a huge temptation to move back.

50:16.000 --> 50:23.000
And with the flights getting more and more expensive and the air travel becoming more and more painful.

50:23.000 --> 50:31.000
And soon going to be does already requires digital ID to go international because your passports are all digital ID.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
So don't think that this system isn't already in place.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
Everything's already in place. It's just a question of whether they turn the keys or not.

50:41.000 --> 50:50.000
And that's part of what what Michael is saying here, but we really don't understand none of you, none of us.

50:50.000 --> 51:01.000
I don't want to talk down to you because I'm also naive to how far this legislation has taken us already in theory.

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
And even if it's not already in place, what is already made possible by existing legislation, I don't think you can underestimate.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
And again, how they played this game between state legislatures and state laws.

51:14.000 --> 51:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we need utmost, utmost vigilance.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
We and our kids and their kids lose it forever.

51:28.000 --> 51:41.000
And that's why it's so inane that there are people that claim they are trying to help us by talking about HIV inserts that were originally found in the original virus in 2020.

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
While not talking about where those inserts are now in Amacron WD-40.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
This is all hands on deck because billions and billions of dollars were at stake.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
This is for trillions of dollars. This is for all the marbles.

52:02.000 --> 52:09.000
So the more they get you to argue about gain of function and amyloidosis and the LNP's chemistry,

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
the more time you waste not organizing, the more time you waste not organizing.

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
Which means when they pull the turn the next key, you won't have your community organized.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
When they turn the next key, your parent teacher association will not know your opinion yet.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
And so this is really a call to arms now.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
You really got to start taking action.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
You got to send letters. You got to talk to your friends. You got to be vocal.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
And when you hear this bullshit call it out unapologetically.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Arm yourself with the biology so that you can.

52:53.000 --> 53:03.000
And even if there is a clever argument to be made, you don't need to make it because this is about freedom.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
It's about sovereignty.

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
And it's about the idea that there are parts of our biology that aren't going to be solved in our kids' lifetimes.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
And all this talk has gotten us nowhere other than...

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
Mike Eden is mopping the floor. Steve Kirsch has said nothing!

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
The crooks bent the choir consent.

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
So I think the last thing they need of you is to sign up for digital ID.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
And it's appearing in certain US states when I was still living in Florida.

53:36.000 --> 53:43.000
They said they'll be very convenient. You can combine your health records and your driver's license and whatever your Starbucks loyalty card.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Before you know it, they'll have everything on that.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
And you'll be required to show it to get gasoline, to enter a store, or at least to buy anything in the store.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
And then ultimately to enter a mall. It's so easy to see.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
Don't sign up for it. You don't need it. They need you to have it.

54:02.000 --> 54:09.000
If enough of us refuse and just say, well, thanks for not for the convenience of that. I'm going to sit where I am.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
That will force them to become more aggressive and that will wait more people up.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
Now, would you agree that his main message at this stage is the digital ID we've got to reject it?

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
That's the only way out. That's the main game.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
And that's really his main message. There was no pandemic.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
Protocols were murder. And they're trying to hurt us into the digital ID pen.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Now, we're about to transition. Steve's about to awaken.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
I don't know if he's going to get a fentanyl injection or what's going to happen.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
But at some point he's going to start talking.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
And I want you to pay attention very clearly to the fact that he points out right away.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Hey, isn't there a green van outside with some daisies on it?

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Is that a great game? Wow, that looks like Scooby-Doo outside.

54:53.000 --> 55:02.000
So I think the strategy of the perpetrators is never to do anything that will activate more than a small percentage of the population at any one time.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
And it's been pretty successful. So please don't sign up for digital ID.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
If they say, oh, you won't be able to do certain things.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
And you think, well, I'll sign up so as to avoid those harms.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
I'm telling you, if you sign up for the harms, you're going to get much worse.

55:17.000 --> 55:28.000
Because then they can tell you, unless your digital ID that you've now voluntarily taken up is valid and up-to-date with your jobs, then you'll still lose validity.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
So you will have to do that anyway.

55:31.000 --> 55:38.000
And I think that's one of the most likely methods that will be used to kill all some of the people.

55:38.000 --> 55:48.000
I know from my first few plus years of rational drug design experience, the structure of molecules are not random.

55:48.000 --> 55:57.000
They are a consequence of intentions in the mind of the designer that are then sort of rendered into a practical thing.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
And so given that's what I did for a living for a long time, I was quite good at it.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
I worked shoulder to shoulder with medicinal chemists and biotechnologists.

56:06.000 --> 56:16.000
If you examine a kind of medicinal entity written on paper or whatever, you have a way of looking into the mind of the designer.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
What were the signs to accomplish?

56:18.000 --> 56:28.000
And those injections folks were definitely designed with the intention of causing injury, maiming and killing.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
There's no other purpose for them.

56:31.000 --> 56:40.000
Even if I believe the narrative about respiratory viruses and injected material designed to produce immunity,

56:40.000 --> 56:51.000
couldn't possibly work because that's not how humans, human immunity in the respiratory tract does not depend on circulating antibodies.

56:52.000 --> 57:00.000
Because of decreased antibodies that these injections do not elicit and see cells that they, I'm not sure whether they elicit.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
So they could never have worked. It would not be inappropriate to take them.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
They were definitely rushed.

57:06.000 --> 57:15.000
They could not possibly be manufactured in the time they said they were manufactured and have been reproducible batch to batch.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
That's absolutely certain, not my opinion.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
That's the opinion of Headley Reese, R-E-E-S, Headley Reese.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
He spent almost 40 years in pharmaceutical production.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Boom, I mean, are you hearing how devastating this is?

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Steve Kirschkamp, break in.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
He's not nodding.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
He's just sitting there.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Maybe he's got jet lag.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
I don't know.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Maybe his audio doesn't work.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
Mike is mopping the floor.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Every single thing he says is spot on.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Man, Mike, you are the man.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Mr. Sparkle.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
We've spoken many times and he knew it was a fake.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
So don't take digital ID for good and sick.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
Don't allow yourself to be jumped by anything that's got.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
Emergency, Fauci, Gates, WHO.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Even at one remove.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
These people are not good.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
They want to harm you and they've harmed many people.

58:13.000 --> 58:30.000
And the reason I think they'll make another run this is that the virus story is so compelling that I've said to people like I mentioned Steve, that the epidemiological data is really oddly in contradiction to the narrative.

58:30.000 --> 58:39.000
And I think if you don't read that, you think, oh, my God, that there wasn't a pandemic or at least not there and then where they said there was.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
But the thing is, despite that analysis and despite me and a few others saying it, nobody cares.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
They're all scared of the bug.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
They're scared of the lab-made bug out of Wuhan.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
They could easily do it again tomorrow.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
And then these gene-based injections, I mean, it's horrifying to realize.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean, that was the Scooby-Doo, right?

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
They're all afraid of the lab-based virus.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
That is the Scooby-Doo.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
And to get people to come to that conclusion on their own over years.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I mean, it's a brilliant plan.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
And it worked like a charm, except we figured it out.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Now, can we get the message out?

59:24.000 --> 59:39.000
Or will people like Steve Kirsch stop us by professing the faith even after he gets told for 35 minutes why the faith is bounded in mythology?

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
It's extraordinary.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Watch.

59:42.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Several months ago, that government's government said we're so pleased with the performance of these new technology vaccines that we've agreed to work with, modern Pfizer, whatever it is, to build a manufacturing plant for mRNA vaccines in every country.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And it's like, oh, my God, these things can't be safe.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They'd never be safe for a mass market, never, ever, because they prompt your body to make things that are non-human.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And if your body is finely tuned, it plays nicely with itself if things that are inside might even are Mike's proteins or inside Steve Kirsch's proteins.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
But if, for example, we cleaned and expressed a bit of me and Steve or vice versa, our immune system would attack it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That's the same basis of transplant rejection.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And so if your body is induced to make a piece of non-human protein, wherever it comes from, from a virus, if it exists, or just from an invention sequence, your body will assume it's either infectious or cancerous.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And it will only say lethal attack on every cell that's taken up and expressed that injection.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And so, you know, these cannot be saved mass market products.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It doesn't matter what they tell you, it doesn't matter what clinical trials they do.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Retire.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Okay.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So let me interrupt.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Sorry.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Are you saying that all of the people on the CDC outside committee, for example, all of those people are in on the plan?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Oh, come on, Steve.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
With the plan.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You're such a shit.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Okay. So, so, I think they know what they're doing.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I think they know what they're doing is wrong.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And I don't know anything about what else they know.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And you know what?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I think a lot of people haven't even realized that.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So let me just, if I could just briefly, I'm so well, despite my bush, useful looks.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Three of the four senior vice presidents or executive vice presidents that were responsible for these gene based chat programs in J&J, AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I know them personally.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
They're either work colleagues, two of them that I work with between, say, five and 15 years.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And another one was someone I met professionally and, you know, we stayed in touch for about a decade.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So I know this three of the four people.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I contacted them in 2021 saying, you know, guys, you know, they're all male.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And it's laid out some basic facts.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
You should, I always thought you were smart and good, you know, good person and smart.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And I must be wrong.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
At least one of these determination, these assessments.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Two of them blocked me on social media.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And one of them a few months later resigned to Mattie Mammon resigned from J&J without comment.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Now, Steve, you understand, defer compensation at that level.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I, I, he must have walked away from at least 10 million into third compensation.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
He didn't announce a new position at the time, although he's moved back into biotech.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
No one leaves an SVP VP job like that with no comment.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
They just thanked him for his service.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And I, when was the last time I referenced him and he thought, Oh my God, he didn't realize.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Oh, when you say nobody has, nobody leaves a VP, a job like that.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
When was the last time that happened?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
How do you ever, how do you?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
When's the last time that happened?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So do you see how insightful of an interviewer he is?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
He actually makes me look pretty good.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Because rather than talking about anything that he spoke about in the last 40 minutes

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and really being like, wow, that's a really amazing summary, Mike.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I wasn't there yet.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
He says how many times have people walked away from a VP job without their golden parachute?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You see how he does it?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's really, it's really extraordinary.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
He's probably been reading a chat the whole time down here.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And somebody's frantically typing about the kind of crap that they need to say.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And there is no response here.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Mike, you cleaned house.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Nice work, Mr. Sparkle.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's, you know, put it this way.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Actually, you probably know, you can't see some salary, but your percentage of bonus,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
bonus could be 100% salary, sometimes more.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And then there'll be, you know, his number is your comment on why he left.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
No, no, he didn't.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
He didn't.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So the people on the CDC outside committee who approve these vaccines for people in America,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
just as a small example, they're not in on it.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And why did they approve the vaccines?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So, I mean, obviously, I have no idea why they did what they did.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But, of course, we don't know.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
They've been a racket for decades.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
As your work recently has been, vaccines are a racket.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I wouldn't recommend anyone currently, certainly in the current environment,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
to accept any vaccine.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Not against anything.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm not saying none of them are any good.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But when you look, as you have found off, do you know the good vaccine?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
No, I don't.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Okay.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So I'm saying speaking.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I was just checking.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
No, no.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
To make sure.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Again, I often say my mind is months ahead of my mouth.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I mean, I'm pretty bloody sure that they're all neutral to harmful and not useful.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
And I will never subject myself voluntarily to another one.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But in terms of my recommendation, definitely don't take it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
How dangerous do you think these gene-based jobs are?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Give me the kill rate.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
If I give you a thousand doses and inject it into a standard population in the U.S.,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
how many people will I kill?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I'll answer the questions one in a thousand, but it will depend on injecting a representative sample population.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Yeah, so I see the standard population.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Okay.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The representative sample injected, but it's harder than that as well.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
If you will be aware, the lots and lots variability means-

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
No, no.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I'm saying on average.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Okay.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It's just there aren't really any average ones.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's like Russian roulette.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There's a chamber with a shell in it.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You can't compute an average for any set of criteria.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
You can compute an average for any set of criteria.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Is that Steve Kirsch trying to dunk on Mike Eden?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Is that really all he's got?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
There isn't an average.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And I'll tell you why, because we did a show yesterday listening to a guy by the name of Robert Malone.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Talk about the variable chemistry of pegulated liposomes.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And specifically, we talked about how liposomes aren't really nanoparticles.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Because after you shake them up or pass them through a barrier to make them really tiny, they can go...

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and get right back together again, and become large enough to be toxic.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And it is the size of these bubbles, whether or not they were transported correctly.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
All these things changed the level of toxicity.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And if the CVS down the street didn't treat them the same way that the Walgreens did, then even if they're all the same lot, Steve,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
the actual chemical properties of the liposomes that are in there are pretty variable.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So variable, that Robert Malone decided that this was a craft technology to use in animals.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Do you not see it, ladies and gentlemen?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
We are right there at the precipice of this being done for us.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
All we need to do is wear the armor and start marching.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Because the cave opening is right over there. I don't even need my flashlight anymore.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The protocols were murder. There is a spectacular commitment to lies happening right now.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And everybody who's spectacularly committed was tipped off.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I love it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I think it's about one in a thousand.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:53.000
One in a thousand, because that tends to match my number that I've been saying for a couple of years now.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Where did you get your one in a thousand number?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The same place that you got it.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
There were three or four other people who were.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
He got his number from the same place you got it except his comes with experience.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And yours comes from where the sun doesn't shine, Steve.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You said one in a thousand?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That's a pretty crazy guess, Steve.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Come on.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I mean, can you not see it?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Is there any humbleness in the guy in the blue shirt?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Is he going to say, wow, Mike, that's the best summary?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
No, he's not.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That's not what the chat in front of him for the last 40 minutes has been telling him to do.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It's been telling him to interrupt him, stop him, ask him about something else.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I think it looked like a satellite of over.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yeah, Dennis, Dennis Rancourt.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I must say, when I realized these things were potentially harmful and

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
potentially harmful and actually harmful, unfortunately, they're different things because it's all in the dose.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
If you take a small enough dose of pretty much anything, it will be harmless.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
But if you take a large dose of things that we normally think of as benign, it could kill you.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000
A famous example is, believe it or not, people would encourage to drink whilst running marathons.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And you might think, obviously, you must drink when you're running marathons.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It's like, you actually don't need to drink very much when you're running.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I mean, I've run 15,000 miles at least.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And when you think the water comes from, it comes out of your skin.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
It's metabolic water.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
As you burn and substrate, you produce CO2 and water.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And your body's clever.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You can go through unbelievable motivations without drinking.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So I'm not recommending you run 26 miles without a water.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But people who died in marathons, most of them had hypo-nestremia.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
They deluded to hell, the sodium in their blood and their heart spots.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So even water in the kind of constants you can drink whilst running a marathon can kill.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So the one in a thousand thing, sir.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So did you follow what he said?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
That when you're running a marathon, you're actually burning glucose?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You're burning starches.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You're consuming and metabolizing.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And in that metabolism, you create water.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Metabolic water.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And so you don't need to replace as much water as you think during a marathon.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
If you don't take into account the fact that your body, as it expends energy, makes water.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And if you overhydrate during a marathon, you can result in extreme bodily stress.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Because again, you've diluted the nutrients of your blood.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
You've looted your plasma. Too much water.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And then your body makes more water.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.000
It's brilliant because it's just another example of one of these dumb, simple understandings

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000
that we have of our physiology as a result of consuming TV and social media for so long unhindered.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:22.000
All of us, even the smartest of us, the brightest doctors have fallen victim to some of these

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
ridiculous truths based in mythologies.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Because there has been a concerted effort to create mythologies that can be used to profit

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
from us, used to control us.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And once companies get so big, they cooperate with each other to maintain these mythologies.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Once powers, once piles of money get large enough, they cooperate with one another.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
To maintain these mythologies, to make sure that they can both take advantage of it.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Calling someone else's grift out, if it's your grift, doesn't do you much good.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I think we're winning, ladies and gentlemen. I think Mike Eden's definitely winning.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Some of the lots, I think, were 10 times more lethal.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Some were 100 times less lethal.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So we can't conclude anything.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
We can't reliably predict anything about what will happen next time.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Because it depends on what they want to do.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But just for the rule of thumb, it is one in a thousand so far.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
That's about a little over 10% of the normal population death rate.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What is striking about what's happening now is that the excess deaths are occurring

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
in people who generally would be very unlikely to die.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Young women, for example, I was a doctor and they had a manager which was young women don't die.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Once they sorted out obstetrics and gynecological related problems, pretty much.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Young men, of course, kill themselves with violence and automobiles, motorcycles.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But young people generally don't kill everyone dying.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Unfortunately, it's a new normal now, Mike.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Do you think the increased rate is of young people killing over and dying?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What kind of question is this?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
19 or 2020?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I've seen work from actuarial work from insurers that talk about 50% increase in death rate,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
which is shocking and it sounds shocking.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
There's a butt, of course.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
If the death rate is very low and if only two people would have died over the six months

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
period, if you had three deaths, that's 50% increase.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Now, obviously it's tragic and the person has been murdered.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But it's not the numbers.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Two and three, the numbers are quite a bit higher.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I was just pointing out that these percentages can be, you know, I just want to put them in contact.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So it's a big number. It's a big percentage.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It may not be a big number.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Whether or not it is, these people didn't deserve to be injured and killed.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And that's what's happened to them.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
These things cannot be safe.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
So let me ask you this.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Some mic on the vaccine.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
If you give somebody the vaccine, the vaccine itself will kill them.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Will the vaccine or can kill them?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Yeah.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And the vaccine also can cause them to get COVID and then die from COVID.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
What do you think the...

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I don't think COVID exists.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I don't think...

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I think that the COVID exists.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Okay.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So, okay.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
No.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
No.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Wait a second.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Wait a minute.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So you're saying...

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
We won't get into viruses, but are you saying that the COVID virus doesn't exist?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
No.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I don't know if it exists or not.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I'm saying it's not circulating.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It can exist in a lab if it wants or a computer if it wants.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It's not circulating.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You mean it's never circulated?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Obviously, I can't tell you what I don't know.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But from the beginning of 2020, when we were told this pandemic is coming from Wuhan,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
according to the epidemiological or cause mortality data in the U.S., state by state,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Dennis Rancourt and colleagues show there was not an increase in all cause mortality.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And in the absence of that, I think that tells us that there was not an additional for public health threat.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So I see in the chat that somebody's saying that yes, it is novel and yeet in 2020.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Well, I would have been there too.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.000
In September of 2020, I was still not at the stage where I understood it like I do now.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And so I was thinking there was a novel virus.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:19.000
But our previous immunity to other coronaviruses would be applicable enough so that there was no virus that could pose a pandemic threat.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But I was still, and maybe part of me hasn't ruled it out yet, that there is a novel pathogen with limited spreading capabilities

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
or extreme spreading capabilities and very low disease incidents.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
This works just as well, right?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You release it a few years earlier.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You make sure that everybody has it.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I think one of the things that everybody needs to consider that I haven't really been putting on the table yet because I think it complicates the situation a bit much.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:05.000
But everybody should consider the possibility that a bacteriophage, meaning a virus that infects bacteria, is another possibility.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And a bacteriophage that could change the gut biome might be responsible for what Dr. Sabine Sahan has found.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And so we don't understand everything yet.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
We don't have all the biology to explain everything that has been observed.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And so I, like Michael Eden, doesn't, I don't think we should feel obliged to answer questions like how many people do you think are being killed by the shot?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
How many kids are dying now?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Or is everyone at the who lying?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I mean, these are all questions that from the perspective of there's a crime having been committed.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:07.000
If you call the cops and say a crime is being committed, you don't have to tell the 911 operator who's doing it and what their motivation was, how they got there, and what they planned to do with what they stole.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And yet every time somebody makes these statements and shows you the data and says, look, let's be real simple, let's be as parsimonious as possible.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:27.000
A bunch of people were bamboozled into doing some really dumb stuff by other people who knew they could take advantage of this mythology and went for it.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And this combination of ignorance and dumb and greed and pre programming set us up for something that I think a lot of people are taking advantage of.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
They knew the pieces were going to move the way they were and they knew that when the things were loose, that they could push stuff in the way that they needed to.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And people are playing games with patent law, they're playing games with intellectual property, and they're playing games with the future of medicine.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Behind the scenes, all the while, while we're arguing about variants and amyloidosis and whether or not the LNP is responsible for all the deaths or whether it's the DNA that's in there.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That's in there with SB 40.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That's the magic of the Scooby-Doo.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Not only does it trap you in this illusion that you figured out the mystery, but the real mystery and the real people that need unmasking and the real scam is going on in a completely different direction.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Not even in the cave, but outside the cave and a whole law school away.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Mike Eden is still mopping the floor with Steve Kirsch.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
That would kill elderly and frail people, which is what they told us, and that's a lie.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Basically, I think most of the deaths of the Kurds in 2020 were murders in hospitals, care homes and the community where medical procedures were changed by dictation.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
People were paid money to follow the dictats.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You know, it's very well in America.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It was overt and outrageous.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:19.000
If you've had a COVID-19 or a COVID-19 ventilation or a COVID-19 reservoir and a COVID-19 death, Kirsch in, I think.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Explain to me, Mike.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
My wife and I have a lateral flow assay test.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Here we go.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Most people have the...

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Here we go.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
These are the quick tests.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Watch Mike mop him up.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Swab your nose.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You swirl it around.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You drop tooth.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:48.000
This is really important because this is the kind of conversation that you will have with your family or with your neighbor at a barbecue.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Or maybe we have to look forward as far as Thanksgiving.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Where people will talk about a lateral flow test and about how I got it, then she got it.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
What's the answer, Mike?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Things.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And then the liquid then flows along a...

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And then you see the lines.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Okay.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So it's known as the lateral flow.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
That's right.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Yeah.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And so my wife got sick with what she thought was COVID.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And she took one of these tests and the test was positive.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And I didn't think anything of it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I ended up getting sick and I then used the test and the test showed that I was positive.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And after I got better and I was checking myself every week to see...

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Okay.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So what's going on?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And so the line is getting fainter and fainter.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And then it had that it disappeared.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It's perfectly consistent, isn't it?

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Okay.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So my question is, if I didn't get COVID, what did I get that is being detected by that lateral flow assay test?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Can you expect if I had multiple brands that they would also show the same thing?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Maybe.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Sure.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Tell me...

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I don't know.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I didn't do that.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Tell me.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Tell me what the...

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000
First of all, we should replay it again because what Steve described was not a controlled experiment.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Because he did not test himself when his wife was sick.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So he doesn't know if he was already positive for it then either.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:34.000
In other words, the whole household could have been positive from the very beginning for whatever that lateral flow test test for.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But because he only tested himself when he had symptoms, he's correlating it with the symptoms.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I'm going to listen to it again to make sure that I'm right because I think I'm right.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Swirl it around.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You drop two things and then the liquid that flows along a...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And then you see the lines.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Okay.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So it's known as the lateral flow.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And so my wife got sick with what she thought was COVID.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And she took one of these tests and the test was positive.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Yeah.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And I didn't think anything of it.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I ended up getting sick and I then used the test and the test showed that I was positive.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And after I got better and I was checking myself every week to see...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Okay, so what's going on?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And so the line is getting fainter and fainter and then it disappeared.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It's perfectly consistent, isn't it?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Okay.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So my question is, if I didn't get COVID, what did I get that is being detected by that lateral flow assay test?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And I suspect if I had multiple brands that they would also show the same thing.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So tell me...

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I don't know.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I didn't do that.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Tell me what the most likely scenario...

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So he suspects if he would have used other tests that he would have seen positive results, but he didn't do it.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So he doesn't know.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So that was already dumb for him to say, but we're just going to point out that he said it.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It is.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yes.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Where my wife got symptoms consistent with what is known as COVID.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And then days later, I got the same symptoms consistent with COVID.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And I used the same test and it showed the same thing.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So tell us, please, if this was not COVID, what was it and what is being detected by these tests?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Like I said, what you just outlined is extremely consistent with the narrative.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
There's a virus going around that you caught successfully, which made you ill.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And you can see evidence of it with a test that you were told is at least you don't highly select it.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I got that. That's the official explanation.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I want to understand.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000
All I'm telling you is that large numbers of people also, like, including me, got ill and had negative test results.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Loads of other people were not ill and had positive results.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So basically, I'm saying that though you had a coincidental finding symptoms and a positive test,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I'm not even sure they're related.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So here's the question.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I remember these tests were not random.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I mean, I took the test.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
We don't know what it's measuring.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
You see now that he's lying and I can spool it back, but I don't have to.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
He said he took the test once a week.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Now he's saying he took the test many times.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Many times he took the test.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
No, he said he took it once a week.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I can spool it back.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
You can look at it later.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I know he said it.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000
This is the third time I've watched this video because it's so good because it's not a man who is hearing an explanation that he believes.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:21.000
This is a man that is reading a chat in front of him that is encouraging him to go on detours and dead ends and straw man arguments with this man.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:32.000
To try and obfuscate his message, which is that we need to back the truck up.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Seriously, the people who made it belong to a group of companies, a segment of society, which are clearly crooked seriously at this point.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And so I believe that there is no one will tell us what's in these lateral playlists.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
We're told that it's an immobilized antibody to some part of the alleged violence.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
That's what they've told us.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I know evidence for it whatsoever.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Because it's so important.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Anything.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So Mike, has anyone then why not expose this?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Okay.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Because what you can do is you can get.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
It's the same argument that Kevin McCurnan makes.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
If it was clones, why don't you find evidence in the jet set database?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
If these tests were faked, why doesn't somebody prove it?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Because there were over 250 tests during the first two years of the pandemic in America and most of those tests and the companies that put them out are out of business.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And if they're not out of business, it is a patent nightmare because every one of these lateral flow tests is a multi-patented device.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
It's got a patent here and a patent there and this part's a patent and that part's a patent and this part's somebody else's patent.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
You think that this is some kind of joke?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You got another thing coming.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:21.000
These emergency use authorized products were potentially the craziest expression of our free for all medical society, pay to play garbage system that we have that's ever been experienced by our country.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And these tests and their validation and their use, none of it was controlled.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
These were all just.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Yep.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
There's the paperwork.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Yep.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Go ahead and distribute it.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000
They paid people to track and trace during 2020.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Do you understand there were thousands of companies around the United States hired people to track and trace people that tested positive for COVID?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000
To make phone calls to go knocking door to door to tell people that, hey, you know, that's the person that you're working with had COVID.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent buying these tests, distributing these tests, processing these tests, tracking and tracing the results of these tests.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve is now asking what happened if we had positive tests?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And Mike's answer is, you know, there were lots of people who got positive tests that had no symptoms.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And there were lots of people who had symptoms that got negative tests.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And so maybe your wife's test and your test aren't even related.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Boom.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I wish William Briggs was here to listen to this stuff because this probabilistic crap that Steve Kirsch is pulling is amazing.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And Mike Eden is immune because he is Mr. Sparkle.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
He is disrespectful to dirt.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:02.000
The virus samples from ATCC for the Coronavirus.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Okay, I got to go back. I got to go back because what he's proposing right now is that you get samples of the Coronavirus from this ACTT place, which is going to be an infectious clone of a particular variant.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And then use it to validate these tests.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I'm just breathless. I'm breathless, but I want you to hear him say it because it's so asinine.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Society, which are clearly crooked, seriously, at this point.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And so I believe that there is no one will tell us what's in these lateral plate tests.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We're told that it's an immobilized antibody to some part of the alleged virus.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I told this. I've never been through it whatsoever.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Okay.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Anything.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So, so Mike, has anyone then why not expose this? Okay.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Because what you can do is you can get the virus samples from ATCC.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
He's laughing for the Coronavirus for SARS-CoV-2.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Did you hear it? You're laughing.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And you can go and run a bunch of viruses that you get from ATCC against the lateral flow test.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I'm personally completely interested in experiments. Sounds like you're interested.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I think you should do that.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
But why has it somewhere?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
If they're lying to us.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Sounds like you're interested, Steve.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Is there a reason why someone...

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Oh, man.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
The why?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I would love it to be exposed.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But whatever you find, there will be some people who will continue to believe what they believe today.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Yeah, I know.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I get that.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I get that.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But at least...

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
It's a wheel spin. It's a wheel spin.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Unless you...

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:03.000
No, no, no. It's not a wheel spin at all because I'm actually interested in seeing the outcome of that test if someone wants to do it.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I agree. I think it'll be...

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I do think it will be... I think you're agreed. I hope.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
But what is the conclusion?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:20.000
If you get viral samples from a central source made by clones and you put it on a lateral flow test and you get a positive result, what's the conclusion?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
That there's no possible...

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
There's no possible false negatives in the background.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.000
That there's nothing else on planet Earth that can make that test turn except for those viruses.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So if you're testing with the virus and it turns, then what happened with Steve's test proves that it was the virus.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That's the fallacy.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
That antibodies are so perfect that they only bind to one thing.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And so if they bind, it has to be that one thing.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
This is a fallacy.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And the idea that Steve thinks you can check that by ordering some clones in the mail and then running them over these lateral flow tests shows you that he's not playing fair.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
It shows you that he's pushing the faith.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It shows you that he's trying to trip Mike up and it shows you that Mike is fools mating him because he hasn't made one forward step yet.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Mike is Mr. Sparkle.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
That would be very important to know what's inside the test.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Don't take us red that it's detecting capsid protein from this season with no idea if they're telling us the truth.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Seriously?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
That's why I'm saying it.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Why hasn't someone just independently tested it?

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Because testing it on the virus or a clone of it will not prove that there is not another million things in somebody's saliva, including endogenous proteins that can also result in the test turning positive.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Gosh darnit people, are you listening?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Antibodies are not magic.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
They have a very small segment that is specific for the target that they bind.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And as easy it is, it should be to imagine that three-dimensional electrostatic shape is not hyper-unique.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And that's the reason why the immune system tries really hard not to roll those weapons out for everything.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Because they're not perfect.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And you gotta know when you're gonna actually use antibodies to make an immune memory.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
You don't just want to willy-nilly do it.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But the use of antibodies to detect things is one of the cardinal intellectual property spaces that has drastically changed as a result of the pandemic.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And it's this changing intellectual property space uncovered by Mark Hewson-Tonic Mark Koolag that is gonna be one of the, I think, most interesting stories of 2024.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Because what you're gonna find is that most of these people who are entangled in this mess are entangled with it because they understand the value and the use of intellectual property and specifically patents.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:33.000
How patents can be used to extract money, how patents are valuable, and how they can be used to leverage power.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Control over entire corporations in theory could be leveraged by patents depending on their value or perceived value.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And their perceived value can change in an instant upon one court ruling, one supreme court ruling, or one simple case law decision.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Guess who knows a lot about patents besides Mr. Mike Eden, who was saying in the 90s we were running out of patent targets.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
And then the Human Genome Project gave us a bunch more.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Steve Kirschknows about patents too.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Against various.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I don't think they know I seriously don't think people know what's in the test.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I certainly had this conversation.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Do you know Jonathan Engler? You're probably aware of it, Claire Craig.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
We tried to find out what was in them.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Early 21, I think, and their companies just simply said, thank you for your inquiry. That's commercial confidential.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So, yeah, that's why I'm saying that you have to treat it Mike as a black box and someone that has to go and do the experiments by exposing it to do you not remember Steve that somebody did it with mango or something like that.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And it also tested positive is so dumb. Steve is really playing the weakest card.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Whoever his handlers are in his chat, you guys are weak. Mike Eden against all. Man, oh man, I need a jersey.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:17.000
To various pathogens and people can basically get a, you know, you can take samples from me and we can do.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Sanger sequencing on those samples and compare it to the SARS.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Can I just see the comments at this point?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And then I could I could then do the same thing.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But Mike, I mean, I don't understand why nobody would do this.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I'm very happy to do it. I'm personally what's in the test.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Hold on.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It certainly has this conversation.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Do you know Jonathan Engler? You're probably aware of Claire Craig.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
We tried to find out what was in them.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Early 21, I think, and their companies just simply said, thank you for your inquiry. That's commercial confidential.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So, yeah, that's why I'm saying that you have to treat it Mike as a black box and someone that has to go and do the experiments by exposing it to various pathogens.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And people can basically get a, you know, you can take samples from me and we can do.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Sanger sequencing on those samples and compare it to the SARS.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Can I just make a comment at this point?

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
What, what does he get a sequence?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
You can take samples from him and you can send your sequence in them and compare.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000
What is he talking about? That didn't even make any sense.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And again, I'll state the testing the lavender flow with viral samples that you get from a central location.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Doesn't make any sense either because you're talking about trying to identify the.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
The specificity.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And then I could, I could then do the same thing.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Mike, but Mike, I mean, I don't understand why nobody would do this.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I'm very happy to do it. I'm personally, I can't with all this.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
No, I get that.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I get that.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So, I'm communicating the public and not very interested in the actual flow.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
But I only need to pay someone to do it.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.000
No, no, no, but, but, but the claim is that the, that, that the, that these COVID tests,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
which everybody gets in the master's distribution uses to say,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I think it's really important thing.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
If the test is wrong.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
No, that's not Mike's claim.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Mike's claim is what he just said.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000
The protocols were mass murder and everybody's committed to lie.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Mike's claim is not that the lateral flow tests don't work.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Sometimes they do work in that they change color because they buying stuff because the antibodies move from one part to the other.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And then the fluorescence changes. Sure, they work.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Clocks work.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Even a broken clock reads right twice a day.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
We are talking here about obfuscation.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
This is essentially Steve Kirsch showing you his colors.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Because rather than picking Steve up like Rocky and carrying him off into the sunset,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
he's trying to knock him down.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And he's misrepresenting what Mike just said and repeated several times.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I just want to be clear.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I don't think there was a pandemic. Nothing ever spread.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000
The protocols were murder and these people are lying.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Mr. Sparkle.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
It could really bring down the narrative. And I'm saying if the test is wrong, it's easy.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
It seems that it's so easy.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Exactly.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Well, I agree.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It is.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And I would say it's almost certainly nonsense that test.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Almost certainly.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Because here's the thing.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:06.000
How much of any one thing would the be in the sample from your nose compared with all of the other potentially detectable materials?

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's going to be, you know, it'll be a tiny fraction of the bulk of biological materials that are being chromatographed by the, as you say, by the few drops through this lateral thing.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I've developed myself. This isn't a PCR where I hired people who have done it.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I've done these tests.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.000
What you would need is something that's exquisitely selective and very, very potent in terms of binding.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And where did they get that from?

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
You know, we don't know to get it from a donkey because that's quite common. You might vaccinate a donkey.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And then you would have, you know, whatever, donkey, anti-sars, whatever it is.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And even then they would get a piece of the alleged patent and they would usually bind it on something else.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
So there'd be loads of other antibodies as well.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It's really, really difficult. It's unlikely for these tests to be knocked out as quickly as they claim to have done it.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I mean, that was another giveaway that it sort of like, it pops up after a few months.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
And I thought, there's no way, there's no way you've done this properly.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And now you've manufactured millions, tens of billions, hundreds of millions of tests.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It's like, it's all aligned.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Do you see what he's saying? You can't make a product that fast. Never mind mass produce it that fast.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Never mind validate the biology that fast. Never develop the biology that fast.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:40.000
And they did it with everything. Everything, ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Steve is, is befuddled because Mike Eden has finally given us a way to argue that we don't have to fight these silly battles anymore.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
We really don't. It's wonderful. Mr. Sparkle.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Has any lab basically bought all these tests and swab somebody who's...

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
He's still talking about it.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Through Sanger sequencing. And then tested that person with five samples of the tests and five swabs.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000
As you can tell, it's something I lost interest in it quite early.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I'm not asking whether you've done it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.000
No, no. I don't know if anyone's done it.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.000
You must hear that I'm, you know, basically it's a detail by the side of the road.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And the idea, it would be lovely if we could show something.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
It's a detail beside the road. It is really like the caves back there.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
We have the flashlight in front. Everybody's been following us.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:53.000
We went down all the dead ends already in 2020 and 2021 with Mike Eden.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:01.000
In fact, I consider Mike Eden the only one that I've been following in this cave exploration trying to get out.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
And now I think we know where the door is. And I think Mike is leading us there.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I'm following Mike and Steve is trying to get us to look back because there's a bunch of stalagtites back there.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
And some of them have quartz on them and they're really shiny.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I mean, we should go back and take a look at those. Did you make a picture with those yet?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
The cave door is right over there. You can hear the crickets.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Mike is leading us right out right now. And Steve wants us to look back at stalagtites and stalagmites.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000
We can't reach enough to people in a single level to bring down anything.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:52.000
That's why it's a game of attrition, really. And that's why I think it's more at least the service I can be to the world.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So it's focused on the things I'm very sure about. And I've said, I said to you earlier, I don't want to fight people about this.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:09.000
So let's talk about the bigger issue. Do you think that so you believe that this is all planned that people that the people in charge, whoever they are?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Do you know who the people in charge are? Is Bill Gates like one of the people in charge?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Does he take orders from someone else?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I would imagine. I mean, remember, until the spring of 2020, Steve, I believed everything pretty much everything the government told us.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I believe national broadcaster. I read the daily paper. What a sap. But I used to believe.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:40.000
What a sap. We were all saps back then. Oh, my gosh, I was the biggest sap. I actually listened to NPR.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I listened to NPR all the time before the pandemic started. I mean, I'm why do you think I like to watch PBS NewsHour?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Because PBS NewsHour went off into another galaxy in months. I mean, I couldn't believe it. I love Mike Eden.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I used to believe broadly that what I was being told with a little bit of spin was probably right.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And I've now come to the conclusion that almost everything they tell us is untrue.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And certainly everything about this so-called pandemic is a bloody lie. Everything.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So I'm not going to try to accommodate them. It's a sign up. Although I know you're sincere and I've definitely spoken to several people who have this experience.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And so they can't have astonished. I don't agree with them. And the only reason I don't is the epidemiological evidence shows there was not an increased cause of death.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:55.000
So what about the scene in the U.S., CNN is showing all these hospitals.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Showing overflight, claiming that they're overflowing in emergency rooms and people sick in the hospital.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
The hospitals are overwhelmed with people sick with COVID. True or false?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So what they did is they found the one hospital in America. Do you think it was all made up?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
In terms of an overflight. There were a few hospitals. Are you kidding?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
CNN says, hey, these hospitals are overflowing and they go and they go back and find the report. Show it.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Actually constructing a hospital and doing it like- Like Matt shows something.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Well, or not not the match. But I'm thinking of the great, what was the- CNN, they use green screens.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Is it like the scene where they set the whole thing up and-

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I think it's worth saying that. I didn't know this in 2020, but I learned it shortly thereafter.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Do you know what the most potent stimulus for increased illness in loss of health status in human beings,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
other than actually giving them something that will make them ill?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But if you weren't able to give them something that would make them ill, do you know what is the proven best way of making them much more likely to become ill?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.000
It's to frighten them. Chronic fear kills.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Some social isolation also kills.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.000
You put them in a position where they're highly stressed, frightened, anxious.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
They don't have a place to hide, you know, where they need to be hyped.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Or they don't have an opportunity to socialize and suddenly literally just die and humans are just the same.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:02.000
So I think we suffered from all normal illnesses amplified by a deliberate policy of high propagandized fear.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I like that a lot.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I like that a lot.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I know there is a Sanger sequencing that is done and the genomic sequences match SARS-CoV-2.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:23.000
So you're not denying that there's a virus out there and that people get it, right?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:31.000
I think it's certainly possible that there's something that moves from person to person that definitely isn't something that causes mass illness and death, Steve.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Unless you haven't read the paper or you have a reason to disagree with it.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I think you have to, on the one hand, in addition to what you're saying, you have to accept,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
there was not an increase in all causes and substances.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
So I'm not looking for a pathogen.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
There wasn't a pattern of death.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And the whole thing, like I said, 25 years of preparing for pandemics, which I think actually can't happen.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
See, the thing is, is you do very simple math.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Just do very simple math.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Round the numbers off.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
300 million people, sorry.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
350 million people in America, 320, I don't know, whatever it is.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.000
We have one every year we have between 2.8 and 3 million people die.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Every year.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000
That's the expected number of people to die and it goes up and down a little bit with the seasons.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And if a million people in America were killed by COVID and they were extra deaths, over one year,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000
that would be a 25% increase from 3 million people to 4 million people dying in that year,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
a 25% increase in all cause mortality.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:54.000
So if there was a novel, deadly, gain a function virus that spread like wildfire through a novel,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000
sorry, through a vulnerable population whose age didn't matter or mattered a little bit.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
You would still have seen it in the all cause mortality and you don't.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
You don't see it anywhere.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And when you do see it, you don't see signs of spread.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:23.000
You see point functions of protocols being applied and then not applied anymore.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Do not resuscitate orders applied and then not applied anymore.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Ventilation protocols applied and then not applied anymore.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I don't know if I'm going to let it run now that this Sanchez guy has come in just because the talk,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
the discussion gets a little weaker now.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
You can tell that Steve is very frustrated because he can't get Mike off of message.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I'll just let it go a little while longer, but I might go to bed soon, just warning you.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I think they're all, they're all fake.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Why would they?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And then also, even from wrong about that, did you look at any of them?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Did you watch even like 15 or 20 minutes of any of these tabletop simulations,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000
the so-called Atlantic storm and lock step and whatever,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
critters and contagion, all these things.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Basically, pretty quickly Steve, the objective was to lock people down, to control them,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
to control the narrative and get an needle in their arms.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
They were never interested in helping them.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I wanted to step in and go back a second to the conversation about the hospitals.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I was living in Fairfield County, Connecticut at the time when COVID hit and at the time,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000
my region had the largest COVID cases in the state.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:51.000
And at the hospital, quite regularly in February and March because my son was in the hospital

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
and it was packed most of the time.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
This is before COVID, the emergency room was packed.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It was just, it was a busy hospital.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Before COVID, before COVID, COVID hits, lockdowns hit.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I saw the reports on the local news about how we had the highest number of cases

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
and stay away from the hospitals unless you're really sick.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I remember being in the emergency room right at the beginning of COVID before the lockdowns

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
and people were coming in to the emergency room going,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I think I have COVID and the receptionists were saying,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
now you don't go back home.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
You're fine.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
They were literally sending them away because they had people with real emergencies in the emergency room

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
and they were busy.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:39.000
But I decided to take a drive when I saw how the COVID was spreading in my region

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
and how busy the hospital was.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And I do have a video of this somewhere.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I've got to find it in my archives because I shot footage from my car

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
and I drove to the hospital and it looked like it was closed.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Literally there were three or four ambulances in front of the emergency room.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
There were a couple of guys standing out there.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
There was a journey, they're empty out, almost for display.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And there was, it looked to me as if the hospital was closed.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000
But the news was telling us it was overflowing with patients and bodies.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
So I just wanted to step into the conversation and share that anecdote.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Two things to add, I didn't do this, but people I know did do exactly what Livia said

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
in the corner of Kent where I live.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And they said that the emergency room is often full to overwhelm in the winter.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
In other words, we've got inadequate capacity.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And they've deliberately taken, well deliberately, I don't know, the motive.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.000
They've reduced the number of inpatient beds and ventilated beds, just quite a lot over the year.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And after the COVID, after the pandemic was declared, the number of admissions for symptoms

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.000
that predominated with respiratory as the main reason fell like a stone.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It's like they're almost half, they're almost half.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So whatever they were being admitted with, whether or not they're the positive quotes,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
PC artists, they weren't, they didn't have a respiratory illness.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
That wasn't what was happening.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And also the, in Britain, they were telling us that they're desperately short.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
See, the problem with this that I see is that if there's no respiratory illness,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
but they're coming in for COVID, it makes me think that the virus is not necessarily

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
communicating in the lungs, but replicating in the gut.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And now you might say, well, wait, why, what?

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
They have to have it in their nose if they're testing positive.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000
They have to have it in their saliva if they're testing positive.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And I'm interested to see how many of these would have been.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Nasal swabs.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Don't forget that when you cough, you cough.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
It goes up into your nose.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
So if there was something that was growing in, yeah, I don't know.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I'm just trying to think about the flora in your mouth and whether a bacteria can work in there.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
One of the reasons why I'm saying that is very anecdotal, but I went into the pandemic

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
being a 50 year old guy with no cavities.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:21.000
And at some point during the pandemic, all of my mouth flora went out the window.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And I now have two cavities I'm pretty sure that I haven't had filled yet because we just got insurance

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:32.000
two months ago after two years of not having insurance thanks pandemic.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But I didn't change my tooth brushing or my toothbrush or my habits that got me 50 years of no cavities.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000
But something happened in my mouth flora where now I can get cavities apparently.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And I don't know when it changed, but it definitely changed very rapidly because these cavities were not there before.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I've got an x-ray where my teeth are like laughable and they've invited other doctors in or other dentists in to say,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
look at this guy's mouth, he's 51 years old.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
And that's not the case anymore, I know.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:19.000
So I'm very skeptical that we understand the biology as yet.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And Mike is very skeptical that we understand the biology yet.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Steve is really sure that there was a novel virus that tests work, it was a calamity, we had to shut down.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000
A lot of these products must work, including the mRNA, has some value, doesn't it?

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Maybe it's the LNP, but sure it was a gain of function virus.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Definitely coming back, saying or sequencing matches.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
A lot of intensive care beds.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:56.000
I personally know the person who used to manage for NHS England, it's about 90% of the UK population.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:04.000
When I say manage, he ran the database of which beds have got what person in them and when did they arrive and so on.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:10.000
And he showed me that in the summer of 2020 and he said, I've never.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I got to type this in there, I'm just going to say it.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So somebody says hypoxiaptide toothpaste repairs cavities, here's the irony.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I started using this toothpaste that was these little knobs that you chew them up and then you brush your teeth with them.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And the guy who I heard those from was Brent Weinstein.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
And they actually did.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Well, I had toothpaste and the toothpaste is now gone and I use this toothpaste.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000
So I don't know if that meant my cavities are healed, but.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Brett Weinstein.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Yeah.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I've seen the intensive care facility so, so empty.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And the part of the reason for that was I don't think it was pandemic and people were advised not to come to hospital.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:04.000
And then the major thing that happened is because of the pandemic, elective surgery almost stopped.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.000
So in the summer, they would do bypass surgeries, varicose veins and even more invasive.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
None of this made it into the BBC, for example.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Sorry.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
How come none of this none of these empty ICUs made it on the BBC?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Oh, Steve.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
OK, I'm probably going to come across as a conspiracy theorist.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But as I say to people, the bloody well is a conspiracy.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
There's nothing theoretical about it.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:40.000
A small number of corporate sort of small number of big companies own almost all of the mass media in the world.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I think it's like less than 10.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And I think those 10 are in on it.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000
They're probably through the world economic forum. They probably have the sidebar and then made it a policy.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
It's like you're going to basically there'll be a line to take. That's always been true.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
The media follows lines to take.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
And basically lines not to take.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So, so do you.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I think it's all line.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Is there media that you consider reliable, like that?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Times, for example.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
No, no, no.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
No, no, no media.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
He said epic times.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
He said epic times.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Steve Kirsch said epic times.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Oh, I see.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I would say I would recommend a UK column, capital U, capital K space column.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
UK column.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
It's run by a couple of good people.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:44.000
And they saw UK column is covered gigo and biological like a whole show.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I'm not kidding.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
It's a big column is cool. That's awesome.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
They are.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
I think at least one of them is one or maybe two.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Yeah, two of them are professional journalists and one is a former British service man who realized that things were not well.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
And they were running UK column before COVID.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And so they've got a wider span.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Yeah.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And I think they're doing their earnest best, but I'm afraid all other.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I think all main media, whether it's TV, radio or prints.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I think there's virtually no independence of editorial.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I don't know.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Again, I don't know whether a couple of phone calls were made in Britain.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
It would be a dream care for a gentleman's club.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I would say, yeah, for you want to make sure that BBC BBC one BBC channel four are both actually part fully apart government owns.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.000
So one phone call and then ITV independent television.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:50.000
You know, I think it's a floated thing, but they'll probably have cross holdings in terms of board membership.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
It's not.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
It's not difficult.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:00.000
It's also, I think, I think the media Steve have been very controlled probably all of my life and probably before that.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I think it's time for bed.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
There is no reason why.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
You can't find that video for yourself.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Just look on YouTube for the VSRF and look up my key.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
It's like one of their recent videos.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I don't want to stay up too late. It's been two hours.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I hope you enjoyed it.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I hope you'll take the time to share the original video and share this one.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I'm going to be on again tomorrow and Sunday.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I don't know when yet.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
But I'm going to try and make more of a habit of this without making any promises.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Just look out for more streams because we're not stopping anymore.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
We're going all the way.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Do not forget, please.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.000
They've lied to you about this stuff in order to steal your kids' freedom.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.000
And the way that they've done it is that they told us this crazy story about a novel virus.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:09.000
And now all the people involved are not talking about the PCR fraud or the masking fraud or the lockdown fraud

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
or the protocols being murdered.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Steve Kirsch couldn't talk about it.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
That's all you need to know.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is where we are.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Let's walk out of the cave together.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Thanks for joining me.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Thanks for joining me.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Good night, everybody.
