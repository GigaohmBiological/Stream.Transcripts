00:02.076 --> 00:05.659
the country is heading towards a cliff, a demographic cliff.

00:06.019 --> 00:11.022
Over the next decade, there will be fewer 18-year-olds available to fill the nation's universities.

00:11.603 --> 00:19.608
An analysis of census data projects that by 2039, the pool will drop by 15% every year thereafter.

00:20.209 --> 00:29.876
In tonight's interview, Jeff Stroll, Director of Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce, explains what it means for America's future.

00:31.266 --> 00:37.852
Jeff, colleges and universities have been experiencing an enrollment drop-off that's known as the demographic cliff.

00:37.932 --> 00:39.213
Can you explain to us what that is?

00:40.997 --> 00:45.201
Yeah, what we're having over time in the United States is declining population.

00:45.221 --> 00:54.689
We just hit the marker where our high school class is going to go down in absolute terms, which then affects the enrollments into colleges.

00:54.789 --> 00:58.031
Now, the demographic cliff spreads wider than that.

00:58.071 --> 01:08.340
I often think about that enrollment decline as a small stream into a big pond, because we've been having these demographic declines for some time, and they're just catching up with us now.

01:08.760 --> 01:14.484
And how long have we been seeing these colleges prepared for the demographic cliff?

01:14.765 --> 01:20.389
They're not as prepared as one might have thought they would be, because we've known this has been coming.

01:20.449 --> 01:29.015
But people have treated it as 2042 is where people have talked about the United States becoming a minority-majority nation, et cetera, et cetera.

01:29.055 --> 01:29.836
But it's here today.

01:29.856 --> 01:35.300
This is the beginning of what's going to be, I think, a major crisis.

01:35.720 --> 01:42.010
And Jeff, this challenge to college enrollment that we're talking about, this is really about American opportunity, right?

01:42.050 --> 01:45.255
I mean, college was a road to opportunity in America.

01:45.775 --> 01:51.344
What's the health of that road to opportunity in the context of these challenges to enrollment?

01:51.804 --> 02:05.116
I would say with the demographic cliff that is coming at us right now is we're going to be leading into skill shortages, meaning that we're just not going to have enough college-educated workers, middle skills, BA and beyond.

02:05.196 --> 02:11.201
So it will actually increase the opportunity potentially for the students who are coming in.

02:11.682 --> 02:12.662
Now, for the U.S.

02:12.742 --> 02:17.627
economic growth, I think it's going to be more troubling because under the current circumstances,

02:18.087 --> 02:27.414
we're going to fall well short of the college educated that we need for a more complex and quickly moving global economy.

02:27.755 --> 02:42.066
When you talk about the skill gap that will grow, how much is that hastened by the fact that people are talking about artificial intelligence unleashing something more disruptive even to the job market than the industrial revolution?

02:45.187 --> 02:46.548
I'm always hearing this every day.

02:46.608 --> 02:48.589
I said, aye, aye, aye, AI.

02:49.009 --> 02:57.034
And so we in the United States have faced several similar waves, be it automation, be it offshoring.

02:57.074 --> 03:01.837
And in each case, we've had some extremely large estimates about how much impact it's going to have.

03:02.217 --> 03:07.180
So I am one of the skeptics about just how big the impact of AI will be.

03:07.700 --> 03:17.971
And I think our future forward is working with AI, learning how to use it as a tool in preparing the next generation of the workforce for working with it.

03:18.331 --> 03:23.817
Now, we can fear it as replacing, but I tend to suspect that's not going to be in the main.

03:23.857 --> 03:29.442
Yes, of course, there's going to be substitution, but we've always had structural change in the U.S.

03:29.482 --> 03:30.724
economy, and we've bounced back.

03:31.264 --> 03:37.450
So, I think that the American workforce can learn to use AI as a tool, which then will enhance productivity.

03:37.510 --> 03:49.641
And facing this demographic cliff, we've seen in Japan that they've been very successful in integrating technology to maintain productivity and benefit both the workers and the economy.

03:49.701 --> 03:51.543
So, there is a hopeful future.

03:51.743 --> 03:56.888
We can talk about Armageddon, but I prefer to go on the â€” be more optimistic than that.

04:48.683 --> 04:52.812
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

04:53.442 --> 04:56.924
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

04:57.184 --> 04:58.225
But this one is pretty cool.

04:58.585 --> 05:01.326
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

05:02.046 --> 05:05.308
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

05:05.908 --> 05:08.370
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

05:08.410 --> 05:13.412
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

05:13.712 --> 05:16.154
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

05:16.174 --> 05:18.395
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

05:35.663 --> 05:37.425
the question about pandemic.

05:38.326 --> 05:45.453
And Stephen, your immunology professor said, very good, because the question was very good.

05:46.254 --> 05:57.004
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

05:57.685 --> 05:57.805
And

06:00.811 --> 06:04.134
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

06:04.354 --> 06:04.814
It can't.

06:05.435 --> 06:09.178
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

06:09.198 --> 06:14.222
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

06:20.683 --> 06:24.687
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

06:24.907 --> 06:26.469
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

06:26.489 --> 06:27.149
Thank you very much.

06:27.209 --> 06:28.410
Can you hear me better now or not?

06:28.751 --> 06:30.312
Yes, much better.

06:30.392 --> 06:34.256
It was really like, it nailed down two things for me.

06:34.376 --> 06:38.840
But I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

06:39.141 --> 06:42.664
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

06:46.638 --> 06:47.098
JJ?

06:47.639 --> 06:48.559
Sorry, yes, go ahead.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.722
Are you going to do the CD and tape analogy?

06:52.782 --> 06:55.484
Because that really, really hit home for me.

06:55.605 --> 07:08.354
And I think people would love to hear that analogy, because they can, A, relate to it, and then, B, really understand the significance of the lab versus the wild type thing.

07:08.674 --> 07:10.735
I love you for saying it, because I cut it out.

07:10.775 --> 07:12.497
I wanted it to be short, but I'll put it in.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.018
It's only going to take me two more seconds.

07:29.059 --> 07:32.222
Just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

07:33.242 --> 07:36.405
Just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

07:37.426 --> 07:40.588
Just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

07:40.928 --> 07:45.112
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

07:45.672 --> 07:49.835
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

07:50.396 --> 07:54.499
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.319
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

08:08.399 --> 08:09.780
His name is J.J.

08:09.940 --> 08:21.325
Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD, and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

08:35.902 --> 08:54.458
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:55.559 --> 09:04.006
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

09:07.250 --> 09:21.613
who are fellow members of EXCO, and whose intellectual company I've really enjoyed and found, you know, just very revealing of the nature of reality.

09:22.373 --> 09:35.835
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like JJ Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people as sort of this kind of

09:37.495 --> 09:44.477
savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learned.

09:44.537 --> 09:46.158
And in many ways, they are.

09:46.858 --> 09:49.799
But that's throwing baby out of bathwater.

09:49.859 --> 10:00.483
I mean, the best thinkers in the world all trawl through and suffer through the consequences of 10 bad ideas for every good one, you know, the best creative thinkers.

10:01.483 --> 10:15.509
And so if you're going to jump on every one of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with, that you don't agree with, and use that as tar to smear the person, I think that's just, you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself.

10:15.549 --> 10:19.371
You won't find the muses, the creative inspiration.

10:20.131 --> 10:22.032
So I certainly think that J.J.

10:22.112 --> 10:23.813
Cooey's overall take is very good.

10:31.209 --> 10:48.484
None of them mention that supplementary oxygen induces acute respiratory distress syndrome, that ventilators were used to stop spread, that a lack of antibiotic use would be murder, or that the multi-year opioid crisis gave us a wonderful decrease in life expectancy.

10:49.105 --> 10:50.966
And none of them mentioned Brandy Vaughn.

10:51.767 --> 11:14.842
It's really obnoxious how none of them are able to adequately explain how PCR is just a fraud as a diagnostic, none explain injection versus ingestion like Brandy did, and none of them mention the population pyramid even though so many of them are actuaries or employees of insurance companies or long-time servants of big pharma.

11:15.964 --> 11:22.409
It's really remarkable how exclusively these people are able to avoid saying murder.

11:23.370 --> 11:26.232
They do it so well, it's almost as if they're on a script.

11:31.476 --> 11:38.101
These actors were put in place to curate a narrative to make sure any damage from transfection could be blamed effectively on the novel virus.

11:38.161 --> 11:45.067
And I know what I'm saying when I read these words, and I don't like having to read them, but no one else will say it.

11:46.798 --> 11:50.721
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

11:52.522 --> 11:53.223
And I have lied.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.263
I'm sure I'll lie again.

11:54.283 --> 11:55.224
I don't want to lie.

11:55.704 --> 11:57.065
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

11:57.165 --> 11:58.206
I try not to be a liar.

11:58.226 --> 11:59.087
I don't want to be a liar.

11:59.647 --> 12:02.369
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

12:04.514 --> 12:06.436
the specialization should make you suspicious.

12:07.116 --> 12:13.361
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

12:13.802 --> 12:15.763
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

12:15.783 --> 12:18.946
And that's sort of my starting bias.

12:25.691 --> 12:29.755
Your consciousness is definitely their prime real estate, ladies and gentlemen.

12:31.156 --> 12:32.117
What an atrocious,

12:33.174 --> 12:37.177
What an atrocious Joe Rogan interview that was.

12:37.837 --> 12:38.998
This is an interview from 2018.

12:39.418 --> 12:47.204
She had a book in 2013 and still can't say it because she plays for the slavers.

12:48.585 --> 12:54.269
Like a lot of these people do, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to think your way out, you got to learn biology.

12:54.289 --> 12:56.490
You can learn it from me or you can learn it from the books.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.592
It doesn't really matter how you do it.

12:59.372 --> 13:20.441
but you got to open your mind to the possibility that these people have coordinatedly lied to us to the point where essentially our parents gave us, you know, handed down to us a mythology crafted by people like Bob Gallo and the Human Genome Project, etc.

13:20.541 --> 13:28.124
You can find my work, well you should be able to find my work in the Archive of Panda, but they seem to have lost all three presentations I did

13:29.013 --> 13:41.585
But lucky for me, there's a couple people that still are in Panda and active, Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler, and they seem to be pretty good at taking my ideas and turning them into substack articles under their own names.

13:42.686 --> 13:49.353
They also have a nice running dialogue with Claire Craig, one of the biggest fakes, next to Pierre Cory in America.

13:50.433 --> 13:58.595
It's a really remarkable show that Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler are putting on by essentially pretending that they don't watch my show.

13:59.515 --> 14:00.335
But I know they do.

14:00.556 --> 14:10.538
I've got their, you know, lots of their direct messages from the year and a half or so that they tried desperately to get me to play along with them in their little game.

14:11.478 --> 14:16.942
Unfortunately, these, like many others, are just traitors to our grandkids working for somebody or something.

14:17.002 --> 14:32.951
I don't know what, just like Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense, just like a lot of the people that are behind Skyhorse Publishing, I believe, and a lot of the people that are influencing our current Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:32.991 --> 14:33.752
I just don't think

14:34.617 --> 14:40.860
that being the victim of a Truman show for as long as he has been, we can hope that he will think his way out.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.982
But I assure you, he is surrounded by people who will never allow him to.

14:46.122 --> 14:48.944
I've met Jay Bhattacharya on several occasions.

14:49.004 --> 14:50.484
Jayanta is a good friend of mine.

14:51.285 --> 14:55.166
Since he's become the NIH director, I haven't gotten a phone call, but I'm still waiting.

14:55.807 --> 15:00.569
And perhaps my best fan is Kevin, worst case scenario, McCairn.

15:01.289 --> 15:01.929
in Japan.

15:01.949 --> 15:02.750
There he is.

15:02.790 --> 15:05.011
He came to visit me in Pittsburgh a couple years ago.

15:06.471 --> 15:08.992
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological.

15:09.192 --> 15:12.373
If you want to share this work, go to stream.gigaom.bio.

15:12.974 --> 15:16.175
The stream is live there and also archived there.

15:16.375 --> 15:20.837
And as soon as we get the next version of PeerTube, you'll be able to download them all again.

15:22.057 --> 15:24.118
GigaOM.bio is a place to talk to us.

15:24.198 --> 15:27.599
And if you want to find a way to support the work, please go to gigaombiological.com.

15:33.231 --> 15:53.647
I don't care how you get there.

15:53.668 --> 15:56.370
I don't care what you do to get there.

15:58.071 --> 15:58.932
The goal is to win.

16:03.669 --> 16:04.834
What time is it?

16:04.854 --> 16:05.417
Game time!

16:05.517 --> 16:05.658
Woo!

16:40.382 --> 16:40.502
So

18:48.641 --> 18:52.302
I'm not streaming on YouTube, somebody says.

18:52.322 --> 18:56.503
We're gonna pause this for a second.

18:58.464 --> 18:59.584
We're gonna open this.

19:00.945 --> 19:03.306
Gonna leave that music running for just a second.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.267
I think I can pull it off.

19:07.207 --> 19:07.947
What's the title?

19:08.007 --> 19:09.067
Podcast Hell.

19:09.087 --> 19:12.008
I'm gonna podcast hell.

19:12.629 --> 19:13.769
Hold on one second.

19:17.682 --> 19:25.006
Boy, would it be great if I had a production crew here and I'm going to make this small again.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.908
I should be able to go start over here.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.250
I should see a green light there.

19:31.390 --> 19:31.750
I do.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.011
And then I can hit resume the show.

19:34.532 --> 19:39.835
Ladies and gentlemen, they created this illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

19:40.737 --> 19:58.031
that's right this little team of meddlers team worst case scenario i like to call them here's a a family photo from january 2024 where they are in front of the u.s senate um this is their one and only chance in history to collect this much data this many genomes and the medical data to go along with it

19:58.511 --> 20:03.233
this much behavior, this much data for their AI.

20:03.294 --> 20:10.437
They imagine if they collect enough of it and then put it into the big computer and store it and shuffle it around that they're gonna be able to figure something out.

20:10.897 --> 20:13.018
That's why they want your kids wearing stuff.

20:13.839 --> 20:21.002
Because again, ladies and gentlemen, we are being manipulated on a multi-generational timescale.

20:21.062 --> 20:24.144
So it's not just about right now and selling a widget.

20:24.784 --> 20:26.345
It's also about your grandkids.

20:27.125 --> 20:41.065
don't forget it's about your grandkids it may even be that this guy was never a good guy and that everything that he said has to be taken with a grain of salt because he was always a bad guy always telling you only what they wanted you to hear

20:42.193 --> 20:57.984
and a spectacular commitment to lies is all that is required from the computer generated graphics that bamboozled us in 2020 to the wonderful people on podcasts that giggle and agree with one another now.

20:58.985 --> 21:03.869
They still need us to teach this mythology to our kids, so there's still time to turn it around.

21:04.569 --> 21:10.734
We can still teach our kids to use their own common sense and to understand their responsibilities to their creator.

21:11.454 --> 21:17.317
that they understand their responsibilities to what they've been given, you know, the opportunity they've been given on this planet.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.478
I have the feeling that my desk is rolling around here.

21:20.718 --> 21:24.700
I hope that's not the case, but it feels like it may have rolled out of position.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.802
And in that case, who knows what we'll look like here in a minute.

21:30.282 --> 21:33.084
It is a history that people are going to need to reckon with.

21:33.124 --> 21:38.186
You know, it's a history, not only this, you know, history that everybody's willing to talk about on TV,

21:39.875 --> 21:46.779
but also that painful history, how long these people have been pretending to be fighting for something.

21:46.799 --> 21:48.480
I don't know exactly what.

21:48.520 --> 21:56.364
I guess it's against vaccines because they call themselves anti-vaxxers, but they haven't achieved much anti-vax action.

21:56.384 --> 21:58.925
It's just a lot of shameless money-taking.

22:05.769 --> 22:06.329
and murder.

22:07.770 --> 22:14.151
And I don't use that picture with me and Polly because I was just hoping for a very long time.

22:14.231 --> 22:30.695
But I mean, with a track record of in 2010 being on 90 billboards to sway votes about autism and not advocating to protect kids from the potential cause of it, it's really remarkable.

22:31.215 --> 22:52.798
it's all about the history ladies and gentlemen if you know who Soph is and you know who her mom is and you know what Soph was up to before the pandemic and and the year before the pandemic you know that she was on Alex Jones and then you know that her mom was involved in this by being on stage with Robert Malone and Meryl Nass in the January of 2023 talking about how the DoD did it

22:53.960 --> 22:55.582
Ladies and gentlemen, it's just gross.

22:56.804 --> 23:05.315
I don't know how to explain it any other way than people like Sasha Latupova and her daughter are not the Americans that I grew up with.

23:05.335 --> 23:08.219
It's probably why Sasha Latupova still has an accent.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.260
Because she's really not an American.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.601
She's masquerading as an American.

23:13.521 --> 23:25.785
And in reality, she is a meddler and probably a part of the controlled demolition that this trader, Robert Malone, is also intricately involved in, that Brett Weinstein is intimately involved in.

23:26.755 --> 23:35.842
Bret Weinstein could have told you in 2021 that this was a transfection because I screamed it at him and begged it to him to tell him in signal.

23:36.502 --> 23:43.467
Him and some other people that I also include in this list of traitors because they knew the right word in 2021.

23:43.527 --> 23:44.488
I taught him what it meant.

23:44.568 --> 23:46.790
I taught him the biological consequences of it.

23:47.310 --> 23:54.535
And people like Kevin McKernan and his anonymous accounts on Twitter have created the illusion that this doesn't matter, but it does.

23:55.456 --> 24:07.417
It does because for two and a half years, everybody was calling them investigational vaccines, including someone as sophisticated as Kevin McKernan or as sophisticated as Brian Hooker.

24:09.279 --> 24:15.464
And that's the kind of spectacular commitment to lies that is required.

24:15.824 --> 24:25.951
And we have gotten unwavering commitment to this lie from Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:26.191 --> 24:30.874
and Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and Merrill Nass.

24:31.035 --> 24:34.217
All of these people are spectacularly committed to a lie

24:35.495 --> 24:39.178
where people got sick and it correlated with molecular tests.

24:41.180 --> 24:52.470
Here's, here's, here's, here's Ryan Cole telling you that he too is spectacularly committed to the lies that there's a sickness that correlated with tests.

24:52.490 --> 24:58.395
Physician, Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology, subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.576
I do molecular biology.

24:59.596 --> 25:02.239
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

25:02.987 --> 25:07.728
This is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, because there is a consistent theme between these people.

25:07.788 --> 25:12.830
From 2020 onward, Kevin McKernan was whining about the FDA being in the way of testing.

25:17.431 --> 25:22.653
And all the way until 2024, when Mary Holland, who's been at it for decades already,

25:23.740 --> 25:29.363
meets him outside of the Senate where he tells them about the DNA contamination in the shot.

25:30.143 --> 25:36.006
A narrative that I was already able to call as coming in 2022.

25:41.529 --> 25:45.931
Ladies and gentlemen, they only were able to come for your kids because we submitted.

25:47.571 --> 25:48.472
That's how it happened.

25:50.472 --> 25:52.253
And we have one chance to take it back.

25:52.293 --> 25:53.154
We have one chance.

25:53.234 --> 25:56.476
But the way to take it back is to take it back with our kids.

25:57.617 --> 25:59.158
It can't be our kids alone.

25:59.539 --> 26:00.800
It's us and our kids.

26:01.280 --> 26:10.727
We are under a multi-generational assault on all fronts, including the military social control programs that we call social media.

26:12.594 --> 26:21.187
And if we don't work now together with our kids to take back the power from these charlatans, we will never get it back and we will be enslaved for generations.

26:21.688 --> 26:25.394
This time could be different because there are people who can see them.

26:26.667 --> 26:36.990
There are people who have been tracking down the mentors of these people and tracking down the lineage of ideas that has propelled us to this place.

26:37.651 --> 26:45.393
I've got a great deal of hope, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope you can see that in my Biology 101 lectures that I've given over the last couple days.

26:45.433 --> 26:55.797
They're kind of impromptu, but they are working out very well, I think, because biology is the truth, so it's kind of easy once you understand it from a gut perspective.

26:56.998 --> 26:58.119
Oh, that was a great pun.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.401
Wow, I didn't even think that was going to come out.

27:02.063 --> 27:04.866
Look, there's no way that these people can avoid us anymore.

27:04.886 --> 27:07.089
The future is us.

27:07.649 --> 27:08.190
Everywhere.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.673
The future is this truth everywhere.

27:10.733 --> 27:15.898
The future is this new Biology 101 everywhere.

27:16.379 --> 27:17.240
That's the reality.

27:20.600 --> 27:28.584
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb, transfection in healthy people is a crime, and RNA cannot pandemic.

27:28.924 --> 27:34.366
You can assure yourself that there is more than enough science to edify these ideas because the U.S.

27:34.406 --> 27:36.387
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

27:36.427 --> 27:44.691
In fact, all of the vaccine schedules around the world are essentially a criminal enterprise, and these people have known it for a very long time.

27:56.019 --> 27:57.760
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.421
Welcome to the show.

27:59.461 --> 28:00.001
It is 5.31.

28:00.101 --> 28:08.604
Giggo and Biological is the show with the longest intro that isn't just a movie.

28:10.385 --> 28:11.226
I don't know why I do that.

28:11.246 --> 28:12.426
It kind of gets me warmed up.

28:12.546 --> 28:14.107
It makes sure everything is working.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.428
It gets all my levels right.

28:16.468 --> 28:17.688
It gets things in my ear.

28:17.768 --> 28:18.609
Gets me grooving.

28:19.289 --> 28:20.470
Loosens me up a little bit.

28:20.490 --> 28:20.770
I don't know.

28:20.810 --> 28:21.890
It's kind of like a runway.

28:25.272 --> 28:27.293
It's kind of a ritual I almost have to go to.

28:27.813 --> 28:32.736
It's the 5th of April, 2025, and I'm very happy to be here.

28:32.756 --> 28:34.877
I'm going to fade this out a little bit.

28:36.778 --> 28:39.100
I got a lot to say.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.781
It is still a message of hope.

28:40.961 --> 28:42.843
It's not for everyone, but it is for anyone.

28:42.903 --> 28:49.888
I'm very, very, very, very, very excited about it because Biology 101 is just falling together.

28:50.388 --> 28:52.590
Can I just share some stuff?

28:52.730 --> 28:59.415
I mean, you know, it is absolutely essential that everybody understand that right now,

29:00.868 --> 29:09.292
There exists a treasure trove of knowledge on eBay that is sometimes available by the box.

29:10.473 --> 29:17.096
I've found a couple booksellers that sell books at $5 each, and they will ship them in big boxes together.

29:17.116 --> 29:19.978
And I have just been winning.

29:19.998 --> 29:24.240
I mean, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.521
Where did I put the big bag?

29:25.641 --> 29:27.042
I must have moved it out of here now.

29:27.062 --> 29:27.582
What did I do?

29:28.137 --> 29:30.397
I mean, I got microbiology books back here.

29:30.457 --> 29:36.479
In case you were unaware, there used to be a course in university called microbiology.

29:36.999 --> 29:43.040
There's an encyclopedia of microbiology that is edited by Joshua Lederberg.

29:44.420 --> 29:47.061
And there's just so much information out there.

29:47.941 --> 29:49.221
Where did I put that book?

29:50.202 --> 29:51.762
I have this really wonderful

29:53.696 --> 29:57.219
I just got back from the basketball court not too long ago.

29:57.239 --> 30:00.342
Oh, there's a huge pile over there, but that's not what I want to do.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.243
Sorry, so I'm not going to go over there now and get those.

30:02.283 --> 30:03.204
I'm already wired in.

30:04.525 --> 30:06.607
But I've got lots of books about

30:08.433 --> 30:10.154
viruses as they were found.

30:10.274 --> 30:12.415
Viruses, really contemporary books.

30:13.795 --> 30:18.697
And I'm really excited about the library that I'm building because it makes it very fun to come down here and do homework.

30:19.737 --> 30:26.060
And homework right now for me just consists of opening a book, taking notes, and trying to understand how these

30:26.957 --> 30:29.379
you know, foundational ideas have changed.

30:29.439 --> 30:31.021
It really feels like a shell game.

30:31.641 --> 30:52.159
That for a long time, when Joshua was still alive, everybody really understood that this was all bacterial genetics, and bacterial tools were being used in mammalian examples, but, and, and, and, and, and eukaryotic examples, but they weren't, they weren't, how do I say it?

30:53.260 --> 30:54.121
They weren't under any

30:55.114 --> 31:03.981
preconceived notions that all of these mechanisms would have their very accessible homologue in our own biology.

31:04.081 --> 31:17.471
And so it's really remarkable how quickly this all fell together once the main puzzle pieces that I think are essentially there because of Joshua Lederberg, once those puzzle pieces fell in place.

31:19.172 --> 31:27.940
I've already had some very, very talented and insightful biology teachers in my life, and so I didn't come to this battle unequipped.

31:29.282 --> 31:37.369
I came with some previous extra weaponry, and that served me well, and it also was a great handicap.

31:39.050 --> 31:42.411
as a would-be tenure-track professor wannabe.

31:43.931 --> 31:58.975
And since this whole shake-up has happened with Corona, it's really, it's just been an invaluable kind of big-picture understanding of biology that goes all the way back to me as a kid and my grandmother and I watching birds together.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.161
So this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

32:04.221 --> 32:05.981
It is for the grandchildren of Earth.

32:06.021 --> 32:09.103
If you want to know what all the marbles are, it's for the grandchildren of Earth.

32:09.163 --> 32:19.947
And the people that we're fighting against, the forces we're fighting against, are forces which act on, plan on, and think on multi-generational time horizons.

32:21.198 --> 32:34.911
And those time horizons make it harder for us, trapped on social media in very, very tiny short time horizons, to see the effect of their plans and to see evidence of their plans.

32:35.031 --> 32:43.759
But the pandemic, I hope, has been something that's allowed a lot of people to step back and see a five-year time span.

32:45.171 --> 33:08.460
And then even now, I'm hoping that I can help you see like a 15 year time span where so many people had ideas that didn't change, had a trajectory of ideas that didn't progress logically fast enough for them to claim to be only where they are after the experience of the pandemic.

33:09.963 --> 33:20.927
And I believe that careful inspection of many of these people reveals them as to what they are, as essentially actors put in place, given a role, following a script, not asking any questions.

33:20.967 --> 33:23.548
And even if they ask questions, they don't do it on camera.

33:24.849 --> 33:33.112
It's really very simple because when it comes to all the marbles, there wasn't really a lot necessary.

33:33.152 --> 33:37.814
And I hope that that has become more and more clear as we've moved forward.

33:39.469 --> 33:48.152
Um, I think this one, the, the murder and lies that I'm depicting here comes my mouse.

33:50.213 --> 33:53.034
The murder and lies here don't require that much.

33:53.694 --> 34:06.239
It doesn't require thousands and thousands and thousands of people to be put on ventilators and against their will and thousands and thousands of people to be put on remdesivir.

34:07.742 --> 34:13.164
And the reason why it doesn't require that is because there was already a rise in all cause mortality.

34:13.204 --> 34:21.667
We already had an abundance of people that we had been doing very much all we could to keep them alive.

34:22.167 --> 34:35.352
And so even just the vigorous treatment of old people in distress could be tweaked enough to create peaks that would otherwise not be there.

34:36.618 --> 35:06.160
And so with careful application of certain things that included but are not limited to the not using antibiotics for pneumonia, often causing pneumonia by giving pure oxygen when it wasn't necessary, and using PCR as a diagnostic tool to justify treating someone as if they had a respiratory disease and therefore maybe causing pneumonia with a mask, with ventilator, with, you know, these kinds of things.

35:07.694 --> 35:15.660
And so I keep going back to pneumonia because behind me, you can see that we have not had any problem with pneumonia.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.863
This graph goes back to 2014 down here.

35:19.383 --> 35:25.008
And we haven't had any problem with pneumonia until 2020 when we lost control of it until exactly the end of 2021.

35:25.488 --> 35:27.530
And then we got control of it again.

35:28.310 --> 35:30.132
And that's not, that doesn't really make sense.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.715
Unless you think of it primarily as murder and lies.

35:34.707 --> 35:37.029
And so the question becomes murder and lies for what?

35:37.189 --> 35:52.159
And I think I've done my best to explain that the dynamics of world population being what they are in that McKinsey report, being shaped more like an obelisk instead of like a pyramid, we are looking at a population collapse.

35:52.239 --> 35:59.625
Right now we have 10 billion people, but we don't have the kids coming up in the Western world to replace those people.

36:01.001 --> 36:04.443
The boomer generation is bigger than the generations behind it.

36:04.963 --> 36:08.044
And every generation behind those are getting smaller.

36:08.905 --> 36:16.108
And people like my brother and sister-in-law think it's their duty not to have children because, again, this message has been sent.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.230
And so I have been arguing that

36:21.761 --> 36:27.644
Depopulation is a very small aspect of this because depopulation was already taken care of.

36:28.165 --> 36:32.187
And you want to, you can hear it in the video that I played at the beginning of this stream.

36:32.907 --> 36:41.512
They are now preparing for a collapse of the college age demographic, which will start this year and continue into the foreseeable future.

36:41.972 --> 36:44.634
We have way too many colleges.

36:46.977 --> 36:49.739
for the number of kids we have coming in America.

36:49.799 --> 36:57.845
That's also why all the elementary schools that you see in your local communities are unnecessary in 10 years or 20 years.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.926
Many of them will be redundant.

37:01.067 --> 37:05.910
And it wouldn't surprise me if some of or all of your school boards are already planning well ahead of that.

37:07.751 --> 37:15.557
And the thing to understand is that people like the Human Genome Project and the NIH and the US military and all the militaries around the world

37:16.232 --> 37:31.805
and all of the pharmaceutical companies around the world that make money off of sick people, and all of the multinational corporations that make billions of dollars off of millions of people, understand that their consumer demographic is changing in the future and are planning ahead for it.

37:32.385 --> 37:34.687
It would be absurd to think that they wouldn't know that.

37:35.427 --> 37:40.171
That any actuary worth their salt wouldn't already be projecting this in the 80s, in the 90s.

37:42.386 --> 37:58.451
And so they know that they have this one chance to collect the grandchildren of Earth, to convince the parents of Earth that the grandchildren of Earth and their data are part of a greater mission, a bigger thing, because the species is multi-generational.

37:59.331 --> 38:09.814
And so these rich people actually want to take control of the evolution of the species by collecting all the data that they can and feeding it to their god, artificial intelligence.

38:11.894 --> 38:20.757
Now, we can have a whole nother show about how artificial intelligence is an absolute myth, and it is, but it's nonetheless a myth that is very compelling.

38:22.497 --> 38:39.142
And if you combine that myth with the idea that maybe in the future that won't be a myth, and you combine that with the reality that this is the last time they're gonna be able to collect 10 billion grandchildren before that number is going to collapse,

38:40.606 --> 38:47.367
then they better collect all of this data now because there will never be a chance to collect this many humans again.

38:49.348 --> 39:05.891
It's a real mathematical certainty that at some point there will never be this many humans on the planet again unless we allow or somehow the prosperity of the human race again starts to blossom like it did, I guess, after World War II.

39:09.312 --> 39:10.713
And so murder and lies for what?

39:10.793 --> 39:11.493
Well, for what?

39:11.593 --> 39:15.256
They need to start the human genome project in earnest.

39:15.376 --> 39:25.542
They needed to collect data and they needed to do a test run and they will probably do another test run because remember, they don't even know what all the data is yet.

39:25.703 --> 39:30.546
The whole idea of sequencing a human genome is still an illusion.

39:30.586 --> 39:38.751
They don't, when 23andMe sends you back the sequence, they don't give you a list of 4 billion bases, honey.

39:40.205 --> 39:42.907
And so this is an illusion.

39:43.067 --> 39:45.149
And so they needed to do a test run.

39:45.789 --> 39:47.250
And what is the test run they did?

39:47.291 --> 39:54.916
Well, they created a remnant stream, a leftover medical waste stream, which could provide

39:56.042 --> 39:58.964
a endless source of genomic data.

39:59.324 --> 40:04.067
And that is PCR testing, swabs, saliva samples, all this stuff.

40:04.727 --> 40:07.709
And this is going on regularly in all our corporate hospitals now.

40:07.789 --> 40:12.112
And that remnant stream has been in existence unstoppable since 2020.

40:15.994 --> 40:21.858
And all of those samples, at least for a long time, were going through DITRA and collected through DITRA.

40:21.898 --> 40:24.739
And so in some ways you could see that harvesting was one and done.

40:24.799 --> 40:25.160
I don't know.

40:26.069 --> 40:30.551
But then they have all that data, then they need to sequence it, then they need to store it on a computer.

40:30.631 --> 40:34.173
And that would be like a test run, right?

40:34.193 --> 40:35.774
That would be like a test database.

40:35.794 --> 40:36.775
So how many could they get?

40:36.815 --> 40:37.635
How well did it go?

40:38.035 --> 40:38.956
What was the error rate?

40:39.076 --> 40:40.197
What was the coverage rate?

40:40.277 --> 40:43.718
All these questions needed to be answered and are being answered, I assure you.

40:45.880 --> 40:55.765
And that's the same reason why all these people are in the fake anti-vaccine movement, including Kevin McKernan, the former research and development director for the Human Genome Project.

40:57.489 --> 40:57.989
That's why.

41:00.210 --> 41:03.171
Because it's one big malevolent show.

41:06.433 --> 41:08.014
That's why these people were put in place.

41:08.034 --> 41:15.317
That's why Claire Craig is a pathologist who worked on the 100,000 Genomes Project before the pandemic.

41:15.937 --> 41:17.077
That's not accident.

41:18.598 --> 41:19.939
Darn it, it's not accident.

41:19.979 --> 41:20.699
My ear itches.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.760
Because I didn't clean this thing well enough.

41:24.501 --> 41:25.081
Sorry about that.

41:26.311 --> 41:28.693
That's details you don't need to hear.

41:29.354 --> 41:50.933
While Bobby is focused on ending the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies, I am going to assemble the best technologists and scientists in the world, and we will use the latest in AI and computation to examine the health records databases of our nation and those other nations who are also on a quest to solve chronic disease.

41:53.766 --> 42:09.734
It's an interesting thing that she says on the campaign trail that they're gonna use AI and all of the data to solve chronic disease because later today we're gonna watch a little podcast with that Huberman guy who claims to be a neuroscientist as well, like a me.

42:10.754 --> 42:16.697
But he's gonna say exactly the same thing like a clown reading a script.

42:17.904 --> 42:22.935
It's really remarkable, ladies and gentlemen, how easy it is to see it if you just allow yourself to look.

42:23.095 --> 42:27.365
Because only together can we seize the moment to defeat cancer.

42:28.362 --> 42:29.884
This is in 2016.

42:29.944 --> 42:34.128
We watched this video a couple of weeks ago where they talk all about getting the data.

42:35.129 --> 42:36.291
It's all about the data.

42:37.512 --> 42:44.479
And it's easy to imagine that Big Pharma is involved because they are multinational.

42:44.560 --> 42:48.904
It's harder to imagine that social media is involved, but the Human Genome Project

42:49.845 --> 42:51.627
is a military project.

42:51.687 --> 42:57.973
It is a national security level one Department of Energy, just like the nukes are.

42:58.833 --> 43:00.115
And so this is no joke.

43:01.536 --> 43:09.143
And they put the military on the internet, on podcasts performing for us, because this is that important.

43:10.433 --> 43:23.321
And remarkably, it is a recycling of a political stunt that I think that actually maybe was discovered by Steve Bannon and used to try and position Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:23.381 --> 43:24.821
perhaps as vice president.

43:26.102 --> 43:33.126
And him getting to HHS secretary is maybe like a, you know, slightly outside of the bullseye dart, but he's there.

43:34.267 --> 43:39.470
And this guy and that guy and this guy down here, they all really wanted him to be vice president.

43:40.464 --> 44:07.810
And it should be absolutely remarkable to you that these people, a Goldman Sachs intellectual property, Navy, Human Genome Project intellectual property, fake biologist, intellectual property father, worked with intellectual property father and DO Department of Justice father on the FDA.

44:08.834 --> 44:11.336
And this guy's complaining about the FDA in 2020.

44:11.396 --> 44:12.416
They're in the way.

44:12.436 --> 44:16.639
And now the FDA is all but destroyed.

44:19.460 --> 44:22.522
Nobody and nothing is in this narrative by chance.

44:22.582 --> 44:24.223
I've really come to understand that.

44:24.263 --> 44:32.288
The Human Genome Project is behind all of this, or at least one of the main motivating factors behind all of this, I assure you.

44:33.269 --> 44:36.771
That is the only explanation for these people to be where they are.

44:37.371 --> 44:52.723
Robert Malone, and the domain server, and the anthrax vaccine with Merrill Nass, and this person who worked on AIDS, this person, the 100,000 Genomes Project, a college dropout turned

44:53.363 --> 44:56.266
turned research and development director for the Human Genome Project.

44:56.306 --> 44:57.527
Brothers work on cancer.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.989
Dad worked on microarrays.

45:00.049 --> 45:11.380
This guy who worked for Solvay with Robert Malone, that lady over there's at MIT talking about glyphosate ineffectively for years.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.922
We gotta, you gotta be joking.

45:18.351 --> 45:19.872
Everybody has a timeline.

45:19.952 --> 45:23.996
My timeline, I think, reveals somebody trying really hard to figure it out.

45:24.436 --> 45:35.185
And I go from thinking it's a lab leak being covered up to trying to argue the biology doesn't support that idea and being meddled with consistently for five years.

45:37.307 --> 45:47.035
And I have a consistent track record that includes an unfortunate acknowledgement in this book, which is super bizarre now that he is Health and Human Services Secretary.

45:48.243 --> 45:57.051
It's super bizarre that the guy who is the scientific director of children's health defense, who essentially fired me at the end of 2023, in 2013, he had it all right.

46:03.679 --> 46:08.943
In 2013, he said, I don't say autism, I say vaccine neurological injury.

46:09.404 --> 46:14.308
I question the entire idea of vaccines and it's not just the MMR, it's many shots.

46:14.368 --> 46:17.030
That's 2013 Brian Hooker.

46:17.070 --> 46:23.456
In 2020, Brian Hooker is all about asymptomatic spread and doesn't know who Brandy Vaughn is.

46:24.897 --> 46:27.399
It is remarkable, ladies and gentlemen.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.502
It is remarkable where we are right now.

46:32.059 --> 46:57.103
because somebody like Polly Tommy, who never in 2010 was even fighting to end any shots or become aware of how autism is caused, she was actually campaigning and had billboards where she was in a bra and got to talk to the prime minister and sway 6 million votes in order to get autistic kids to be treated better in school.

46:59.403 --> 47:09.130
not to save anybody from making more autistic kids, not to save any future kids from injury, but to get autistic kids better jobs.

47:09.931 --> 47:10.812
I shit you not.

47:20.632 --> 47:31.676
So it's pretty remarkable that the only person or organization that I know of that was able to say that vaccines do more harm than good is Brandy Vaughn's Learn the Risk.

47:33.457 --> 47:35.678
Children's Health Defense never says that.

47:36.038 --> 47:37.798
They don't make banners that say that.

47:37.858 --> 47:39.799
They don't make billboards that say that.

47:39.859 --> 47:44.601
They make banners that say rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

47:46.789 --> 47:58.877
And so the courage that Brandy Vaughn had to do that with her own money in 2016 without having a vaccine injured kid, but feeling guilty about having a vaccine free child.

48:02.439 --> 48:05.701
But we have to defer to Brian Hooker because his kid's injured.

48:05.721 --> 48:09.083
We have to defer to Polly because her kid's injured.

48:09.103 --> 48:12.005
We have to defer to Mary Holland because her kid's injured.

48:13.757 --> 48:18.458
I know Polly and Mary's kids are being taken very well care of.

48:18.498 --> 48:30.581
I don't know about Brian's kid because I think they use Brian's job and the pain and suffering that he goes through as the father of an adult autistic kid against him to control him, to keep him where he is.

48:31.341 --> 48:33.801
Because he was saying it right in 2013.

48:35.482 --> 48:36.982
And now he can't say it right anymore.

48:39.206 --> 48:41.327
Brandy Vaughn could make billboards.

48:41.467 --> 48:43.829
They made two movies with Brandy Vaughn.

48:44.209 --> 48:53.716
They took pictures with her, including James Lyons Weiler, the guy that Children's Health Defense and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland put on stage at every one of their fricking shows.

48:54.276 --> 48:59.880
Every one of their conferences, he's been there on stage pushing his own IPAC crap.

49:02.261 --> 49:03.122
And same with Dell.

49:04.810 --> 49:06.130
And none of them can say it.

49:06.270 --> 49:08.651
None of them say the vaccine schedule is criminal.

49:08.711 --> 49:11.312
None of them say that intramuscular injection is dumb.

49:13.152 --> 49:15.092
They keep asking it might be adjuvants.

49:15.193 --> 49:17.073
Maybe it's the EMF.

49:19.294 --> 49:21.654
Hell, they just said that fluoride could do it.

49:25.855 --> 49:28.736
So Brandy Vaughn died on the 7th of December, 2020.

49:29.636 --> 49:33.337
And then after that, the union of the unwanted

49:34.093 --> 49:35.134
It was so great.

49:35.334 --> 49:36.034
So great.

49:37.875 --> 49:49.123
So my first stop after I finished seeing my patients today was to- So two weeks after, after Brandy died, they're all having a laugh because it's, you know, pandemic and they're going to Costco to buy everything out.

49:49.183 --> 49:50.684
Cause you know, that's how I roll.

49:50.704 --> 49:52.545
I bought everything.

49:52.585 --> 49:54.026
I bought like six chickens.

49:57.486 --> 50:07.930
And of course, what's disturbing about that little video is that there's Brian Hooker and his friend, there's some other doctor who just are on a script and they're calling back and forth to each other.

50:07.990 --> 50:10.051
Hey, Brian, what do you know about B-cells?

50:10.131 --> 50:10.711
Wink, wink.

50:11.132 --> 50:14.733
Hey, Dr. Kendra, what do you know about antibodies?

50:14.793 --> 50:15.393
Wink, wink.

50:15.914 --> 50:17.694
And the whole list that comes out of them at 2020,

50:19.315 --> 50:21.257
two weeks after Brandy was killed.

50:21.657 --> 50:24.820
His safety studies are too short on these vaccines.

50:25.240 --> 50:29.024
These vaccines during illness can cause, you know, crazy stuff.

50:29.384 --> 50:31.386
His 5G warfare, what is that?

50:31.446 --> 50:32.647
That must be 5G.

50:33.548 --> 50:38.572
Neutralizing antibodies, they fade, so they're not really, you know, they're not really immunity.

50:38.952 --> 50:43.913
And asymptomatic carry, it can be asymptomatic for like five days, so it's totally crazy.

50:44.253 --> 50:47.594
And these vaccines, do they target T-cells, Brian?

50:47.994 --> 50:55.236
Yeah, I don't really know, you know, it's important to talk about T-cells, but right now they're talking about neutralizing antibodies, so that's what I'm gonna say.

50:55.716 --> 51:01.077
And nothing at all about the PCR, nothing at all about the word transfection.

51:01.497 --> 51:07.399
And here we have Brian Hooker with 16 years transforming and transfecting plants.

51:08.629 --> 51:10.030
And he said that in 2013.

51:13.253 --> 51:18.097
You know, when he said that he doesn't use the word autism, he says neurologically injured kids.

51:20.659 --> 51:25.063
So somewhere between 2013 and 2020, Brian Hooker got on board.

51:26.545 --> 51:29.567
Maybe because he was told that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:29.627 --> 51:30.608
is going to be president.

51:30.648 --> 51:33.731
And so if you want to be part of that, you know,

51:34.986 --> 51:35.786
Now's your chance.

51:36.326 --> 51:38.387
It's gonna, you're gonna have to hold your breath for a minute.

51:38.407 --> 51:43.049
You're gonna have to, you know, help us with this narrative, help us with this stuff.

51:43.149 --> 51:48.091
But in the end, you'll get your book, which came out in 2023.

51:49.211 --> 51:53.252
Vax Novax still doesn't say it, but you know, at least he's got a book.

51:57.814 --> 52:03.136
Oh, it's brutal, ladies and gentlemen, because these happy little accidents didn't start in 2020 and they didn't end yet.

52:04.309 --> 52:05.910
They've been going on for decades.

52:06.771 --> 52:10.994
And they're getting more and more frequent as they put more and more players on the field.

52:11.454 --> 52:18.839
And during the coronavirus pandemic, they had a whole team of people out there that I'm calling team worst case scenario.

52:19.240 --> 52:27.886
They were out there specifically to make sure that PCR would never be questioned as a diagnostic, only debated about the details.

52:29.690 --> 52:32.652
That's why Kevin McKernan was out in front of that in 2020.

52:33.072 --> 52:39.797
That's why he helped with Claire Craig to gather all these cats to write the Corman-Jorston report.

52:41.017 --> 52:43.979
Get them all on board, all on message.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.740
The PCR works.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.082
PCR is a great way to find a coronavirus.

52:48.142 --> 52:55.707
It's just that the way the WHO did it and Jorston did it, it wasn't fair because their peer review was too fast and their primers make dimers.

52:58.854 --> 53:04.658
So PCR is now a widely used medical diagnostic standard and the FDA of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

53:04.698 --> 53:05.778
does not give a shit.

53:07.660 --> 53:09.421
Marty McCarty does not care.

53:11.242 --> 53:12.763
And this is by design.

53:12.823 --> 53:16.085
This is one of the main reasons they put all these people where they are.

53:17.867 --> 53:20.489
and why they are there now, because they're gonna go along with this.

53:20.529 --> 53:33.958
You think Jay Bhattacharya learned anything from me in those three years that would lead him to, you know, recommend to his director or to his secretary that, you know, maybe we should look at the, put the FDA on this, get Marty on this.

53:33.998 --> 53:36.820
Maybe we should look at these as individual medical devices.

53:40.262 --> 53:41.463
Of course, they're not gonna do that.

53:43.558 --> 53:50.340
The vaccine schedule has been successfully insulated from any real scrutiny.

53:51.821 --> 54:00.483
And I assure you, within a decade, they will have almost exclusively turned it into an mRNA schedule, if they have anything to say about it at all.

54:01.684 --> 54:04.825
And I called that already a couple years ago, but it's clearly going to happen.

54:05.945 --> 54:07.786
And it's going to happen because of this.

54:07.946 --> 54:17.309
Because the public scrutiny into the nature of intramuscular injection has been effectively nullified by these clowns and their clown show.

54:18.090 --> 54:19.250
Asking dumb questions.

54:23.192 --> 54:26.033
And it will continue to expand both younger and older.

54:27.079 --> 54:34.563
pregnant women and to old people until personalized transfection will become the gold standard because that's how they're going to purify it.

54:34.603 --> 54:41.087
They can't make it in big batches because that makes for a lot of impurities they can't separate and they already knew that.

54:41.940 --> 54:44.381
But the next generation of these will be printed.

54:44.441 --> 54:48.322
They will essentially make them, synthesize them, and that will make them very pure.

54:48.342 --> 54:52.003
And that will be their, also their way of making it to order.

54:52.423 --> 54:57.704
And then there's no need for an FDA anyway, because it's not a product that you're going to put in a bottle with a label.

54:57.724 --> 55:01.965
You're just going to put it in a bottle and put a name on it, like Jonathan Cooley.

55:03.769 --> 55:06.951
And that will be the vaccine schedule going forward.

55:06.991 --> 55:09.953
There was no epidemiological evidence of spread, ladies and gentlemen.

55:09.993 --> 55:14.076
Instead, there was an anticipated rise and expected deaths.

55:14.656 --> 55:16.877
And they sculpted that using murder and lies.

55:17.378 --> 55:21.120
And that's how they got this myth to look like, the myth that they wanted it to look like.

55:21.580 --> 55:29.805
But this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality is visible in any honest population pyramid.

55:29.866 --> 55:31.767
Here you see the population pyramid

55:32.327 --> 55:43.011
the change in population here, and the aging population getting older and older, and you can see the expanding population up here past retirement.

55:43.091 --> 55:47.692
That is an economic disaster, if not properly managed.

55:48.673 --> 55:54.715
And the coming collapse in the population is also a very bad disaster.

55:55.295 --> 56:01.637
It doesn't look like it here, but in fact it is much worse than that, and especially in many Western nations in Europe.

56:03.208 --> 56:08.272
Over the next decade, there will be fewer 18-year-olds available to fill the nation's universities.

56:08.833 --> 56:16.840
An analysis of census data projects that by 2039, the pool will drop by 15% every year thereafter.

56:17.460 --> 56:27.129
In tonight's interview, Jeff Stroll, director of Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce, explains what it means for America's future.

56:28.519 --> 56:35.105
Jeff, colleges and universities have been experiencing an enrollment drop-off that's known as the demographic cliff.

56:35.185 --> 56:36.466
Can you explain to us what that is?

56:38.250 --> 56:42.431
Yeah, what we're having over time in the United States is declining population.

56:42.471 --> 56:51.933
We just hit the marker where our high school class is going to go down in absolute terms, which then affects the enrollments into colleges.

56:52.033 --> 56:55.274
Now, the demographic cliff spreads wider than that.

56:55.294 --> 57:05.556
I often think about that enrollment decline as a small stream into a big pond, because we've been having these demographic declines for some time, and they're just catching up with us now.

57:06.024 --> 57:11.725
And how long have we been seeing this come, and are colleges prepared for the demographic cliff?

57:12.025 --> 57:15.066
They're not as prepared as one might have thought they would be.

57:16.726 --> 57:18.066
Why would they be prepared?

57:19.166 --> 57:27.368
In other words, what they needed to do was take advantage of it, because it was more college kids than would ever exist again.

57:28.128 --> 57:32.229
Our generation was the most college kids that would ever exist.

57:32.249 --> 57:33.629
So if you were going to harvest,

57:34.728 --> 57:46.892
all the tuition money that you could harvest through all the student loans you could get, you need to open every freaking college you can possibly open and charge as much money as those kids would possibly spend.

57:49.693 --> 57:57.275
That's one way that you can imagine them sucking the life out of America in a controlled demolition over a generation.

57:58.749 --> 58:06.511
I feel very much responsible for that by having gone to one of these liberal arts colleges and taking out massive loans and spending Pell Grants.

58:08.691 --> 58:09.131
For what?

58:10.172 --> 58:14.433
To get the same thing I could have gotten at the University of Wisconsin for a fraction of the cost?

58:14.933 --> 58:19.594
But they were doing it on purpose because there was a once in a generation chance.

58:23.114 --> 58:26.777
They're never going to have this many deans of medical schools again.

58:26.837 --> 58:31.801
The dean of the medical school at the University of Pittsburgh gets paid more than $2 million a year.

58:33.442 --> 58:36.104
I mean, they're never going to have that again.

58:37.806 --> 58:44.271
The head of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine makes more than $500,000 a year in raw salary.

58:44.691 --> 58:49.175
They're not going to have the infrastructure to create those kinds of jobs ever again in academia.

58:51.294 --> 58:57.097
The whole illusion of academia is based on all these kids percolating up through the grad schools.

58:57.157 --> 58:57.918
It's all over.

58:58.098 --> 58:59.119
That's all done.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.781
And it's going to be done very quickly.

59:03.481 --> 59:04.882
It's a steep slope now.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.583
It's unsustainable.

59:08.703 --> 59:23.207
And just as cool as it would have been to be at the start of that when anybody could have gotten a job at any university because everybody needed a professor because they had to get all these classrooms open before all these kids were ready to enroll.

59:23.227 --> 59:26.548
Or otherwise they would have missed the chance to make the money.

59:29.509 --> 59:35.971
And now those chairs aren't gonna be filled anymore and so I'm sure we're gonna have to subsidize or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you'll see.

59:38.814 --> 59:40.855
But the point is that they knew this was coming.

59:41.155 --> 59:42.936
They've known it was coming for decades.

59:43.036 --> 01:00:03.884
And the way that they managed it is through careful managing of the narrative, careful curation of the protocols, careful curation of the fear and frustration and doubt, and making sure that none of the most senior doctors would be there because they would be afraid to catch this disease, which primarily affected old people.

01:00:04.384 --> 01:00:09.408
Ladies and gentlemen, letting the opioid deaths go wild for a few years helped them tremendously.

01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:12.971
It's all sculpting using murder and lies.

01:00:15.853 --> 01:00:19.616
Lots of people don't like sometimes I emphasize one thing or another thing.

01:00:19.757 --> 01:00:23.159
I don't know how they killed the majority of people.

01:00:23.279 --> 01:00:28.143
I don't know exactly how many people needed to be killed to create whatever this was.

01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:29.504
But it wasn't that many.

01:00:31.046 --> 01:00:32.627
And there were lots of ways to do it.

01:00:36.789 --> 01:01:01.620
And so you have to imagine a team of performers with elaborate costumes and scripts all on that same script provided by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan about a spike protein that could affect the mitochondria, a spike protein that could affect the heart, a spike protein that could cause amyloidosis or prion disease.

01:01:03.598 --> 01:01:11.043
a spike protein with furin cleavage sites and HIV inserts, and a staphylococcan enterotoxin B homology.

01:01:12.924 --> 01:01:22.011
This script was given to these performers and they went and pretended that they were rushing to stop the train and pulling hard on it was helping to stop it.

01:01:23.692 --> 01:01:25.013
Just like this guy's performing.

01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:43.613
Everybody from Kevin McCairn, to the Baileys, to Andrew Kaufman, to Merrill Nass, to Robert Malone, to Mike Eden, to Nick Hudson and Panda, to all of these people that were on the boat off of Turkey in 2022.

01:01:44.594 --> 01:01:50.438
All the people that have been in hot tub shots or shoe photographs together.

01:01:51.559 --> 01:01:59.025
Wittingly or unwittingly, they are participating in this train stopping exercise where nobody needed to be rescued.

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:08.412
And it's only because everybody is pretending to have to stop this train and pulling really hard on it that people stop and start helping them.

01:02:10.387 --> 01:02:24.877
Jessica Rose complaining about VAERS consistently for five years, learning nothing, even though for like two and a half months, she was just absolutely spellbound by me and my biology and just thought it was keeping her up at night, this clone idea.

01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:31.122
And then they reissued the script and she went right back on it because that's what they do.

01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:42.719
That's why she can surf on three continents and not have a job and have no real track record even though she was apparently chasing tenure for quite some time.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.581
She never really had a job.

01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:54.048
She just did a postdoc and then another postdoc and another postdoc and then started at the start of the pandemic called all those postdocs post-secondary degrees.

01:02:57.742 --> 01:03:12.021
I mean, if I went around saying that I have a post-secondary degree in Neuroscientific Modeling and Systems Neuroscience and Molecular Neuropsychiatry and also Biophysics, would that be cool?

01:03:13.503 --> 01:03:15.366
Or would you know that I was full of shit?

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:29.991
But for some reason, nobody knows that this person is full of shit when she says that she's an immunologist, and a computational biologist, and a molecular biologist, and an applied mathematician, and something else, and something else.

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:41.381
Or that this guy is a bioethicist, and also the inventor of mRNA, and also a horse breeder, and an emu breeder, and a barn builder, and a guy who consults for the Vatican.

01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:48.104
And this is supposedly somebody who's been to Africa and Rhodesia for Ebola.

01:03:49.985 --> 01:03:55.567
And then was on stage with Stephen Hadfield in 2023, the Ebola guy.

01:03:58.149 --> 01:04:00.330
I mean, it's all just one big show.

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:10.455
And if these people right here in the middle were all in on it and agreed to be all in on it, everybody else could be essentially bamboozled because they trust those people.

01:04:11.254 --> 01:04:21.853
because they hang out with them, because they've had drinks with them, because they met them at the hotel bar late night or had hotel breakfast with them in Romania or in Iceland.

01:04:28.018 --> 01:04:30.740
That's why they're doing it, and that's why it's now obvious.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.581
You can go to my website and download this.

01:04:32.601 --> 01:04:38.426
You gotta go to the link called Stuff on the top, and you can download the McKinsey Global Institute report.

01:04:39.106 --> 01:04:42.168
It shows you that these population pyramids are inverted.

01:04:42.569 --> 01:04:48.753
It shows you that that's gotta be why Denny Rancor is involved, because Denny Rancor doesn't seem to know anything about population pyramids.

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:54.017
An increase in all-cause mortality expected for a couple years, for a couple decades?

01:04:54.077 --> 01:04:55.118
No, I'd never heard of that.

01:04:56.721 --> 01:04:58.905
And so I think this is when I kind of all figured it out.

01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:03.753
When I saw all these guys on stage together in Romania, I couldn't really, why Romania?

01:05:03.813 --> 01:05:07.179
Why the hell would you go to Romania and give a talk?

01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:08.722
Why not do this in Chicago?

01:05:09.887 --> 01:05:11.748
or do a tour in America and Canada.

01:05:11.788 --> 01:05:14.090
What in the hell did they go to Romania for?

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:19.354
How much money did they spend on the flights and the hotels to be over there with the Tate brothers?

01:05:19.414 --> 01:05:20.495
What was that all about?

01:05:21.195 --> 01:05:28.761
And what in the hell is Stephen Hatfield standing right next to my friend, used to be Nick Hudson.

01:05:29.181 --> 01:05:30.582
I mean, that's just creepy.

01:05:33.649 --> 01:05:42.574
You know, Stephen Hatfield's the guy who said that Barney the dinosaur should have a mask on at the beginning of the pandemic to teach two-year-olds what masks mean.

01:05:43.835 --> 01:05:47.937
And all those people except Steve Hatfield were in front of the Senate about a month later.

01:05:48.538 --> 01:05:50.179
It's just, it's just traitorous.

01:05:51.019 --> 01:06:00.385
So we are being governed by a group of meddlers that are creating this limited spectrum of debate, like national security operators.

01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:14.125
And they are on social media, but they're also behind the scenes influencing lawmakers and lawyers and teachers and congressmen and congresswomen and business people.

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:17.066
It's a very powerful weapon.

01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:26.909
If you send Robert Malone and Ryan Cole and one other of these to some meeting, it's over.

01:06:27.861 --> 01:06:38.043
You know, their celebrity status takes over, their charm takes over, their well-rehearsed pitches take over, and their limited spectrum of debate is completely enchanting.

01:06:39.073 --> 01:06:43.837
And I think that's why some of those people at the top are even probably just enchanted, you know?

01:06:43.977 --> 01:06:46.759
I mean, I don't think Wolfgang Wodock's a bad guy.

01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:48.581
I hope someday I can write a book with him.

01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:51.303
I mean, I don't think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:51.343 --> 01:07:06.916
can possibly be considered a good guy, but on the other hand, you gotta have a little sympathy for a guy whose dad and uncle were murdered because most likely ever since that happened, he's been the victim of an influence operation, a Truman show.

01:07:08.868 --> 01:07:11.269
And there's no doubt in my mind he's a victim of it now.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:13.770
Just like I was.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.511
It's a Lollapalooza of liars.

01:07:15.551 --> 01:07:16.632
They suck you in.

01:07:17.112 --> 01:07:19.773
They tell you how great you are and how smart you are.

01:07:20.213 --> 01:07:22.934
And then they say, why don't you go along with us on just this one thing?

01:07:23.575 --> 01:07:24.495
You know, the lab leak.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.337
Just don't say it so rough now, you know.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.998
First, let's just make it about choice.

01:07:31.038 --> 01:07:34.039
Let's make it a big top tent of health freedom.

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:37.021
You know, we'll teach your immunology in a couple years.

01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:40.573
We'll tell them about Brandy Vaughn in a couple of years.

01:07:40.613 --> 01:07:44.055
We'll tell them about ingestion versus injection in a couple of years.

01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:50.559
Right now, let's make it about free speech and free choice because that's what the lawyers say is the best way to fight.

01:07:54.008 --> 01:08:00.752
Those same lawyers, every time I talk to them about holding the government to strict scrutiny when they suspend fundamental rights, they're all kind of like, huh?

01:08:01.532 --> 01:08:01.792
What?

01:08:02.433 --> 01:08:03.433
What do you mean by that?

01:08:03.533 --> 01:08:04.254
What does that mean?

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:05.554
What do those words mean?

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:06.375
I don't get it.

01:08:06.975 --> 01:08:08.136
What's strict scrutiny?

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:28.693
So I think you can find out what's going on with this picture right here, because his father hired his father, and those two fathers are essentially responsible for the FDA, plus a guy by the name of Senator Kefauver.

01:08:29.054 --> 01:08:33.577
And Senator Kefauver got killed like three weeks before or after his uncle.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:45.383
Senator Keefofer may have wanted the FDA, I think, that bill to be a lot stricter and sharper than it ended up being, but that's neither here nor there.

01:08:45.403 --> 01:08:46.924
I mean, that's just old history, right?

01:08:46.964 --> 01:08:47.404
Who cares?

01:08:47.884 --> 01:08:52.126
The point is, is that these people are involved and it's not for nothing.

01:08:52.586 --> 01:08:54.847
It is absolutely essential to see that.

01:08:55.227 --> 01:09:03.810
This guy has lied about me and my family on the internet, prominently on podcasts and on Twitter.

01:09:04.651 --> 01:09:05.571
This is big time.

01:09:09.758 --> 01:09:12.220
And so the Lollapalooza of liars continues.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.363
And I just wanted to cover a couple of things before I go.

01:09:21.045 --> 01:09:22.626
That was very loud.

01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:27.249
We're going to do an Iverson, then we're going to do a Shanahan, then we're going to do a Huberman.

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:28.990
The bench is being emptied.

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.292
And it's funny because these people are coming off the bench and their script

01:09:33.195 --> 01:09:35.197
is one of the rungs of the hamster wheel from 2020.

01:09:36.098 --> 01:09:39.180
It is a joke, quite frankly.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.622
It's absolutely a joke.

01:09:40.702 --> 01:09:45.306
Remember just to recap what I've been ranting about for the last hour or so.

01:09:46.026 --> 01:09:51.931
These people have had, for example, Brian Hooker has had since 2023, sorry.

01:09:53.653 --> 01:09:54.934
Brian Hooker has had since 2013.

01:09:57.924 --> 01:10:08.052
when he had 16 years experience as a transforming and transfecting plant biologist, doing genetically modified plants to create medicines.

01:10:09.933 --> 01:10:21.242
He's had that long since 2013 to say that intramuscular injection is dumb or that you should compare the vaccine schedule in America to any other schedule in the world.

01:10:22.563 --> 01:10:25.605
And he could have called it transfection in 2020 and he just didn't.

01:10:27.159 --> 01:10:32.403
Well, it might not be news to some, but doctors are facing censorship from the government, especially in states like California.

01:10:32.443 --> 01:10:33.343
Surprise, surprise.

01:10:33.543 --> 01:10:34.724
So what are they allowed to say?

01:10:34.824 --> 01:10:37.046
And more importantly, how does this impact your health?

01:10:37.286 --> 01:10:43.090
So what are they allowed to say is exactly the issue that it has been and remains and always has been.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:48.854
Every time we talk about this, it's either mandates or medical freedom or freedom of speech.

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:50.034
And this is bullshit.

01:10:50.895 --> 01:10:55.158
It's bullshit because vaccination is a crime.

01:10:56.667 --> 01:11:05.890
Vaccination is more equivalent to hitting kids in the head with a baseball bat than it is something that works sometimes, and sometimes it hurts people.

01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:07.550
That's not what we're dealing with.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.731
That's what the narrative is.

01:11:10.051 --> 01:11:19.574
That's what all these witting and unwitting stooges keep saying for the last 15 or 20 years, that we have to fight mandates, that we have to have free choice.

01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:32.284
even though free choice about something that is poison, free choice about something that is murderous or damaging or injurious is not the right argument.

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:43.153
Just like arguing that kids should have the choice of whether they get a sex change operation or not is ridiculous.

01:11:46.138 --> 01:11:52.405
Kids should not have the right or the choice to drive a car into a crowded building.

01:11:55.762 --> 01:12:05.168
It would be absurd to say that, well, everybody's got the right to choose who they wanna kill, and then we'll deal with the consequences afterward, because sometimes people choose the right.

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:25.622
I know these are not perfect analogies, but you need to understand that if you're arguing for mandates or you are arguing for freedom of speech or freedom of choice in 2025, you're making the same argument that Brian Hooker's been making for the last decade, that Mary Holland's been making for the last decade,

01:12:26.102 --> 01:12:32.809
that Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy have been making for the last two decades.

01:12:38.931 --> 01:12:46.437
Joining us today is Dr. Azadeh Khatibi, a board-certified physician with a master's in public health and a master's in health and medical sciences.

01:12:46.898 --> 01:12:56.966
Dr. Khatibi is also a staunch advocate for medical freedom, having filed multiple lawsuits against California's government for violations of physicians' First Amendment rights.

01:12:57.487 --> 01:13:04.413
She's testified before Congress on issues like patient autonomy and the physician-patient relationship during the COVID pandemic.

01:13:04.853 --> 01:13:12.700
In addition to her medical work, Dr. Khatibi is an accomplished actor and filmmaker with experience on Academy Award eligible and shortlisted films.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.023
Currently, she's working on a documentary exploring free speech in medicine.

01:13:17.524 --> 01:13:18.825
Dr. Khatibi, welcome to the show.

01:13:18.865 --> 01:13:19.866
Thank you so much for being here.

01:13:20.977 --> 01:13:22.118
Oh, thank you so much.

01:13:22.238 --> 01:13:23.839
I really appreciate this time, Kim.

01:13:24.119 --> 01:13:27.761
I'm super excited and hope that whatever I say will serve your audience.

01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:28.741
I'm sure it will.

01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:34.384
You know, I have to tell you, I, um, to, to get ready for this interview, I watched you on Dr. Drew's show.

01:13:35.104 --> 01:13:41.088
And, um, and it was so funny to watch how you were like, Drew, you know, Dr. Drew, I've watched you forever.

01:13:41.108 --> 01:13:42.308
I mean, I listened.

01:13:42.328 --> 01:13:42.748
Okay.

01:13:42.768 --> 01:13:47.471
So going nuts about Dr. Drew, a fellow rumble performer.

01:13:48.888 --> 01:14:06.637
having an actress on to talk about free speech and a flubbed response to a coronavirus pandemic in 2025, to talk about medical freedom, to talk about doctor's first amendment rights, and to flatter about how handsome Dr. Drew is.

01:14:07.478 --> 01:14:14.041
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but Kim Iverson is not cutting any clips of Jonathan Cooey for YouTube.

01:14:17.384 --> 01:14:17.624
None.

01:14:18.805 --> 01:14:21.146
She cuts clips for everybody else, but not for me.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:28.430
I don't know if she's cut clips for Tom Cowan yet, but Tom Cowan was on her show a few days after me.

01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:33.053
And there was no, you know, conversation about, you know, I just talked to some guy.

01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:37.776
They don't learn.

01:14:39.176 --> 01:14:45.460
Nobody who's podcasting is learning, you know, like if, if somebody tells them that

01:14:51.036 --> 01:14:52.657
It's just it's remarkable to me.

01:14:52.717 --> 01:14:53.478
It's remarkable.

01:14:53.538 --> 01:14:58.781
I sometimes I'm just at a loss of words to you all the time when I was young on Loveline.

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.603
And it's so funny because I used to listen to Loveline all the time.

01:15:02.703 --> 01:15:04.345
And now and I'm in my 40s.

01:15:04.445 --> 01:15:07.547
And now the younger kids like do not know who he is.

01:15:07.607 --> 01:15:09.728
They do not know the show Loveline.

01:15:10.108 --> 01:15:17.713
Like they don't know who this guy and it to me, it's just like, wow, we're old if we've hit the point where they don't know who Dr. Drew and Adam Carolla and love

01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:28.295
Yeah, and also, like, now I'm at this stage where I see people on social media at these, like, red carpet events, like, big time, and I don't recognize the celebrity at all.

01:15:28.515 --> 01:15:30.536
And I'm just like, I'm really old now.

01:15:30.616 --> 01:15:31.876
I don't know the young people at all.

01:15:32.096 --> 01:15:36.038
But I have to tell you, it was funny because you were telling Dr. Drew, you're like, oh, and he was saying, oh, it's full circle.

01:15:36.078 --> 01:15:36.638
Here you are.

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:38.319
You used to listen to me.

01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:38.759
Now you're here.

01:15:38.799 --> 01:15:41.500
And then you said, oh, and we both were on Wheel of Fortune, but 20 years apart.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.681
I have to tell you, full circle, so this will come full circle.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.043
I actually co-hosted Loveline with Dr. Drew for a week.

01:15:49.724 --> 01:16:08.417
Back in my radio days, yeah, back when I used to, before I switched over into political, like digital online political news, I used to do a syndicated radio talk show, and when I was, and it was about relationships, it was women's topics, it was very, it was love line, but for women, and it was at night, it was, and it competed, but it got,

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:10.498
you know, was targeting a different audience.

01:16:11.179 --> 01:16:27.665
But when I was in between syndications, I had left the contract with one of the companies and I was, before I moved on to iHeart, which ended up being iHeart, Loveline actually was trying to get me to potentially co-host with Dr. Drew, and they invited me in to test me out and sit there and do a week.

01:16:27.705 --> 01:16:32.727
But ultimately, I didn't want to, I'm a host, I'm not a co-host, it was just I,

01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:40.592
So I did launch a second syndication, but with iHeart before I left three years after that one and became a political.

01:16:40.772 --> 01:16:41.292
Here I am.

01:16:41.412 --> 01:16:42.493
So full circle.

01:16:42.513 --> 01:16:42.933
I love it.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.695
But you know, I think what was missing on that show was like a strong.

01:16:46.916 --> 01:16:50.838
So she's saying there she's a political reporter or she's a political something or other.

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:53.800
So she she's just going to use that outright.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.181
It's not her specialty.

01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:56.201
She's not a scientist.

01:16:56.221 --> 01:16:58.003
She's not even a science communicator.

01:16:58.043 --> 01:16:58.163
So

01:16:58.763 --> 01:17:00.764
You know tom cow and jonathan cooey.

01:17:00.804 --> 01:17:08.607
They're all the same, you know, robert f kennedy jr It's all the same stuff to her and so now we're gonna have this lady on who's who's I guess somebody who?

01:17:09.147 --> 01:17:23.552
Who advocated for something and uh, it's just gross feminine Counter yeah a lot of masculine energy on that show, which is cool Like that's how they want to do it But that would have been awesome because you are that very strong feminine instead of that passive feminine

01:17:23.592 --> 01:17:28.577
But I have to tell you, the only celebrity crush I've ever had in my entire life is Dr. Drew.

01:17:28.737 --> 01:17:39.286
I don't know, and for whatever, you know, there's a lot of good-looking celebrity guys out there, but Dr. Drew, for whatever reason, and I had the hardest time sitting there in that room with him.

01:17:39.426 --> 01:17:41.108
I was like, this guy's so cute.

01:17:42.509 --> 01:17:43.590
And he is in person.

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:44.951
He's so much more handsome.

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:46.393
Really?

01:17:46.413 --> 01:17:47.013
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:47.274 --> 01:17:47.954
He's a good looking.

01:17:48.054 --> 01:17:49.276
He's a good looking gentleman.

01:17:49.556 --> 01:17:52.298
And I had a girl moment.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:56.562
I had a fangirl moment when I was like, you know, oh my god, I'm talking to this guy.

01:17:56.863 --> 01:17:58.724
Yeah, he had he died.

01:17:58.744 --> 01:18:02.328
I can I could totally see that I actually probably have a little bit of a crush on him, too.

01:18:03.459 --> 01:18:08.340
I'm sorry to all the male audience right now watching everybody's a man like most of the audience is male They're like, oh great.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:26.044
These girls are sitting here talking about some other guy Sorry about that gag I know okay Yes back then this was like, you know when I was doing that sitting in that I was like 30 I mean I was like over 10 years ago.

01:18:26.124 --> 01:18:28.324
So yeah that I tried that out and

01:18:28.624 --> 01:18:29.364
Tread out love line.

01:18:29.384 --> 01:18:31.205
But I just thought that was funny as I was watching that.

01:18:31.245 --> 01:18:33.486
I was like, Oh, full circle again, little, you know, here.

01:18:33.706 --> 01:18:35.006
And I've been on that show.

01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:38.868
And so, okay, so let's talk.

01:18:39.268 --> 01:18:41.188
And he's also here in California, right?

01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:46.530
And somehow still, I'm leaving though, in two weeks, I'm out of here.

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.971
But so let's talk about what the heck is going on.

01:18:50.752 --> 01:18:54.773
I've known that there's a lot Kim Iverson lives in California and Idaho.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:57.374
I think she has two different houses, which is pretty good.

01:18:57.622 --> 01:18:58.362
A lot of censorship.

01:18:58.402 --> 01:19:00.423
Of course, we've been talking about this since the pandemic.

01:19:00.843 --> 01:19:06.606
The censorship against people like myself, the media was censored heavily, independent media.

01:19:06.726 --> 01:19:16.330
I'm really getting tired of these people saying that they're censored because if you have a rumble contract where they're paying you to make a show, you're not censored.

01:19:17.431 --> 01:19:21.112
Censoring resulting in a career is not censoring.

01:19:21.192 --> 01:19:26.094
Censoring resulting in you getting on Tucker Carlson twice is not being censored.

01:19:26.114 --> 01:19:26.695
I don't know who

01:19:27.873 --> 01:19:37.017
Who thinks getting fired from a university but also getting a $500,000 settlement is the same thing as getting fired from a university?

01:19:37.457 --> 01:19:44.940
It's all these people from rich, ridiculously rich families that are actively working against my family.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.503
Why is Steve Kirsch and his hundred million dollars of bullshit working against me?

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:54.766
Why is a longtime DoD contractor like Robert Malone working against me?

01:19:55.266 --> 01:19:59.088
Why is somebody like, I don't know, well who are these people?

01:20:00.549 --> 01:20:01.430
Kevin McKernan?

01:20:02.415 --> 01:20:21.650
A guy whose family has been taking contracts from the government and grants from the government to do cancer and has spun off companies from the Human Genome Project spends his time attacking me from his house on the Atlantic Ocean?

01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:24.072
How is that even remotely possible?

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:36.166
A woman whose daughter was on Alex Jones in 2019 who says she's retired after selling a company to Pfizer.

01:20:36.186 --> 01:20:40.369
I mean, who are these people?

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:47.475
And now she's told to complain about censorship?

01:20:47.535 --> 01:20:48.556
Are you kidding me?

01:20:50.757 --> 01:20:54.000
Mark Kulak makes more videos than he gets views.

01:20:55.356 --> 01:20:56.756
censorship my ass.

01:20:56.916 --> 01:21:10.760
Yeah, where we would say something about, and I remember just reflecting back now, in hindsight, saying early on that the COVID vaccine is doing, there's reports that it's having some effect on the heart.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.341
We don't know what the effect is, but it's doing something to the heart.

01:21:13.981 --> 01:21:16.562
That was totally ripped off online.

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:20.463
They then slapped a, you know, a sanction on my show.

01:21:20.483 --> 01:21:22.944
Basically they said, I couldn't, I got suspended for a week.

01:21:22.984 --> 01:21:24.284
I wasn't able to do any content.

01:21:24.804 --> 01:21:30.447
And then, you know, fast forward a couple of months, and they're like, Oh, yeah, it actually does cause myocarditis and pericarditis, you know, just that.

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:45.917
And so there we are right here, it's the hamster wheel, right, they introduced the the myocarditis in the background with a bunch of meddlers knowing all along, eventually, it was going to be acknowledged as one of the many things that was already expected.

01:21:48.575 --> 01:22:01.544
But it was expected because it was a transfection, not because of the spike protein going to the heart, like Richard Fleming said, or like Kevin McCarran was saying, until he said it was going to the brain.

01:22:04.642 --> 01:22:07.224
Ladies and gentlemen, I am really upset because this is terrible.

01:22:07.244 --> 01:22:09.566
The censorship was intense against those of us in the media.

01:22:09.606 --> 01:22:10.466
We saw the Twitter files.

01:22:10.506 --> 01:22:11.147
We saw all of this.

01:22:11.687 --> 01:22:13.268
But what was going on with the doctors?

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:15.910
What kind of censorship was happening on the physician's side?

01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:20.993
Because all we saw was our doctors all following along like zombies, like, get the shot, get the shot.

01:22:21.053 --> 01:22:22.134
Everybody needs the shot.

01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:24.875
And you're like, OK, but, and I'll get the shot.

01:22:24.936 --> 01:22:25.476
And we can't even.

01:22:25.516 --> 01:22:28.158
We're not talking about the two years of murder, right?

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:28.798
You see this.

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:30.459
2020 and 2021 were murder.

01:22:32.912 --> 01:22:34.214
We're talking about the shot.

01:22:36.197 --> 01:22:38.279
See you, you can't even step foot in our office.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:44.288
I mean, I had a legitimate heart concern and the cardiologist saw me the first time.

01:22:44.608 --> 01:22:48.474
For the follow-up, during the pandemic, would not see me without a vaccine.

01:22:49.805 --> 01:22:55.491
I mean, patients were being censored from even seeing physicians, heart doctors.

01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:57.292
I wasn't able to get into a heart doctor.

01:22:58.033 --> 01:23:03.038
And it was because, well, if you're not gonna get the vaccine, then we can't see you, you can't come into our office.

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.999
So what was going on there?

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.860
What the heck happened?

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.322
Why is this still happening?

01:23:08.706 --> 01:23:16.290
So I think there's a couple of factors that we're playing, at least a couple of factors that we're playing into it.

01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:20.592
One was in the beginning, a lot of doctors just didn't even know what was happening.

01:23:20.612 --> 01:23:22.373
And they're trying to get information from studies.

01:23:22.473 --> 01:23:24.314
She's looking to the left an awful lot.

01:23:24.574 --> 01:23:25.795
I think she's got cue cards.

01:23:26.863 --> 01:23:28.004
There's not a lot of studies.

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:30.125
They're trying to get information from what's happening overseas.

01:23:30.145 --> 01:23:38.531
So the media is also affecting that, and they're trying to, and there's also like scrambling to see like, can we see patients safely?

01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:39.111
Is it good for us?

01:23:39.151 --> 01:23:41.292
Is it going to be good for our kids if we go see a patient?

01:23:41.332 --> 01:23:44.134
And then we, what's the latency period of this virus?

01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:46.376
So we're all scrambling to get information.

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:49.658
And then because there was the reactivity,

01:23:49.858 --> 01:24:00.949
The idea that they are interviewing somebody like a Hollywood actor and wannabe producer of movies about what happened during COVID when they were

01:24:02.383 --> 01:24:06.066
they were rolling out the vaccine early on Hollywood sets.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:17.736
Before anybody else got the vaccine, they were already on news sets with the newscasters, and were already on Hollywood sets with the actors and all the people on set.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:18.836
How do I know?

01:24:18.896 --> 01:24:27.043
Because my friend Annie Wershing took a shot to be on the set of Picard, where she played the Borg Queen.

01:24:28.004 --> 01:24:30.166
And she died of brain cancer in

01:24:32.631 --> 01:24:38.116
She died of brain cancer because she took this stupid shit to be on a fricking set.

01:24:38.596 --> 01:24:40.718
And she's not even talking about that.

01:24:40.798 --> 01:24:41.779
She's part of that.

01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:45.651
I'm sure they'll talk about it in an hour.

01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:48.892
So the point is, is that these are not the people.

01:24:48.912 --> 01:24:58.114
Why do we want to talk to somebody who thinks it's that simple, who has no more insight than what she just said, and is going to have no more insight than this.

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:04.936
In the mainstream media was promoting certain narratives where you were seeing pictures of people dying in Italy.

01:25:06.278 --> 01:25:11.281
And there was mismanagement of systems in New York.

01:25:11.601 --> 01:25:14.963
So you were having people die at unnecessary rates.

01:25:15.463 --> 01:25:21.807
And people were just extrapolating that to mean that that was gonna be their experience when COVID hit among their patients.

01:25:22.607 --> 01:25:25.268
It created a lot of reactivity.

01:25:25.789 --> 01:25:27.049
This is an audition.

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:29.851
This is somebody who's auditioning to play a new role.

01:25:30.631 --> 01:25:31.372
This is gross.

01:25:32.662 --> 01:25:37.725
And it's very frustrating because this is the kind of thing that I call a hamster wheel.

01:25:37.745 --> 01:25:45.770
There's no fricking excuse for the censored Kim Iverson to even be tolerating this.

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:46.670
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:47.731
We already know this.

01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:49.091
Tell us something we don't know.

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:53.194
But she actually started the interview with a question that she already knows the answer to.

01:25:54.375 --> 01:25:56.116
What was going on with the doctors?

01:25:56.156 --> 01:25:59.898
We know our doctors, I don't even, oh my gosh, this is just gross.

01:26:01.667 --> 01:26:21.885
sorry kim but it's really it's really it's terrible and um so that was one the news was interfering the lack of information the need for security and security what you ended up seeing and what i started seeing very early on what she started my physician facebook groups there was a lot of like contentious discussion in a rate that i was

01:26:22.185 --> 01:26:26.246
Her physician Facebook group, such a contentious discussion.

01:26:26.386 --> 01:26:29.087
Worried, I was like, this is not calm centered discussion.

01:26:29.508 --> 01:26:33.129
Even though you have this emergent thing, you need to have centered discussion.

01:26:33.569 --> 01:26:37.370
What is this emergent thing that we have to have a centered discussion about?

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:40.531
This is the biggest crock of bullshit I've ever heard.

01:26:41.932 --> 01:26:45.653
And this is what amounts to programming on the internet.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.874
She's making this clip for YouTube.

01:26:49.684 --> 01:27:02.634
But no clips of the former scientific advisor for the current Health and Human Services Secretary, no clips of the friend of Jay Bhattacharya, just clips of this clown telling us what we all knew in 2020.

01:27:03.014 --> 01:27:03.835
Thanks a lot.

01:27:03.975 --> 01:27:04.395
Wow.

01:27:04.916 --> 01:27:08.138
So insightful from your script to your left.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.202
Or instead of like calling people names, there was.

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:20.738
Dr. David Weldon, it is such an honor to be here with you today.

01:27:21.058 --> 01:27:23.405
When I went to Congress, I took a pay cut.

01:27:24.093 --> 01:27:27.855
You are the only one who can tell this story well, because you were there.

01:27:27.995 --> 01:27:30.256
This music makes me want to hurt somebody.

01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:37.219
The American people need a CDC that they can trust, and they don't have that right now.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:40.521
I feel like I'm being patronized right now.

01:27:40.601 --> 01:27:44.263
Wakefield was dealt with wrongly.

01:27:44.603 --> 01:27:47.044
It's a complete distortion of free markets.

01:27:47.324 --> 01:27:53.134
When it comes to vaccines, there's no duty to really investigate the safety.

01:27:53.194 --> 01:27:59.184
Basically, Uncle Sam, the taxpayer, is going to pick up the tab if something goes wrong with this vaccine.

01:28:00.293 --> 01:28:01.294
I'm Nicole Shanahan.

01:28:01.614 --> 01:28:13.061
Welcome to Back to the People podcast, which highlights the growth of a movement uniting America, where our government is free from corporate capture and where we give voice back to the American public.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:21.247
Remember, this is the same lady that I just showed you a video of about a half an hour ago saying that she wanted all the data to fight chronic disease with AI.

01:28:23.808 --> 01:28:26.410
And now we're talking to Dave Weldon,

01:28:27.588 --> 01:28:37.882
who Pauly Tommy said would be the CDC director in 2017 on the VAX bus with Brandy Vaughan.

01:28:41.848 --> 01:28:44.712
That, ladies and gentlemen, cannot be ignored.

01:28:46.001 --> 01:28:47.161
that he was nominated.

01:28:47.381 --> 01:28:59.645
I know that he didn't go to the Senate and get an interview or whatever and he didn't get approved, but he was nominated and Pauly Tommy knew that he would be the nominee in 2017 on the VAX bus.

01:28:59.765 --> 01:29:08.868
Tell me that this is not a plan to use a fake anti-vaccine movement to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:10.789
as close to the White House as possible.

01:29:12.069 --> 01:29:13.850
That started all the way back in about 2015.

01:29:16.448 --> 01:29:16.488
or 2016.

01:29:16.528 --> 01:29:16.928
Dr. David Weldon.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.836
It is such an honor to be here with you today.

01:29:33.856 --> 01:29:39.898
Your story is, I think, the modern American story.

01:29:40.258 --> 01:29:43.218
You spent time serving in our military.

01:29:43.499 --> 01:29:44.679
You're an internist.

01:29:45.019 --> 01:29:47.580
You spent 14 years in Congress.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.440
You are a model American.

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:56.302
14 years in Congress should be an automatic disqualifier for being a good guy.

01:29:56.322 --> 01:29:59.983
You can't be 14 years in Congress without having totally played the game.

01:30:00.899 --> 01:30:01.420
I don't think.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.282
In every possible way.

01:30:04.243 --> 01:30:11.430
You're a devout Christian and you're an active physician still at Health First Medical Group in Florida.

01:30:12.498 --> 01:30:14.479
and you are now famous.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:23.844
I did not know much about you until I actually read your exit letter and really spent time.

01:30:23.864 --> 01:30:32.129
I knew a bit about you when you were nominated by President Trump to serve as our next CDC director.

01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:36.351
And I have to say, Dr. Weldon, that the,

01:30:39.790 --> 01:31:05.652
you know, 12 hours before your confirmation hearing when I heard that you were no longer going to sit before the Senate committee and give your testimony on why you would make probably America's best head of the CDC restore honor to that department, a department agency that 40% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans do not trust anymore.

01:31:06.393 --> 01:31:07.934
You are going to restore trust in it.

01:31:10.091 --> 01:31:20.284
I'm glad you started with that because that really was one of my primary goals and I thought the best way to achieve that was through

01:31:21.694 --> 01:31:24.876
transparency and high quality research.

01:31:25.036 --> 01:31:27.598
High quality research and transparency.

01:31:27.638 --> 01:31:29.179
So we're going to do more studies.

01:31:29.219 --> 01:31:30.740
We were going to test the vaccines.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:37.004
Just like Steve Kirsch said on the Stu Peters podcast that in five years, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:39.726
will have given us a safe vaccine schedule.

01:31:43.328 --> 01:31:44.689
It is the same bullshit.

01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:47.291
They haven't moved an iota.

01:31:48.499 --> 01:31:51.361
It's the same song and dance bullshit.

01:31:52.061 --> 01:31:54.363
It's not a real anti-vax movement.

01:31:54.383 --> 01:31:56.104
You want a real anti-vax movement?

01:31:56.584 --> 01:32:01.867
The anti-vax movement that's real is right here at Giga Home Biological, and I don't know if they're anywhere else.

01:32:03.628 --> 01:32:15.255
And not calling people anti-vax and not calling people names, but actually- I'm not anti-vax, I'm sorry.

01:32:15.315 --> 01:32:17.957
We are the anti-intramuscular injection.

01:32:18.795 --> 01:32:19.195
movement.

01:32:20.776 --> 01:32:23.496
Anti-intermuscular injection movement.

01:32:23.556 --> 01:32:24.257
That's what we are.

01:32:25.477 --> 01:32:40.221
Actually listening to the public, you know, another amazing figure, the CDC is now recommending COVID shots for little children, and 90% of parents are refusing these shots.

01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:46.042
Now, are we going to say 90% of the American people have it wrong?

01:32:46.182 --> 01:32:47.643
At some point, you have to say,

01:32:48.658 --> 01:32:53.922
Maybe the American people have it right and CDC has it wrong.

01:32:54.643 --> 01:33:01.228
And maybe a lot of people at pharma who are trying to promote all these vaccines have it wrong.

01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:04.370
So I wanted to try to get everybody together.

01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:06.052
Sounds like it's pharma's fault.

01:33:08.173 --> 01:33:10.395
And get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.

01:33:10.935 --> 01:33:13.958
I was very disturbed by the lack of confidence in CDC.

01:33:14.638 --> 01:33:16.600
You know, the other analogy I like to point out

01:33:17.872 --> 01:33:22.113
I'm still practicing medicine, part-time, but I still practice medicine.

01:33:22.934 --> 01:33:42.079
If you're a practicing physician and anything below 92% of your patients approve of you, like let's say you only have a 85% approval rating from your patients, you are considered a troubled physician.

01:33:42.872 --> 01:33:47.876
The average doctor is approved by their patients, 96%.

01:33:49.258 --> 01:33:52.140
Otherwise, the patients wouldn't be there in the office.

01:33:53.121 --> 01:33:55.943
So yeah, it's a real crisis.

01:33:56.403 --> 01:33:57.905
What in the hell did that mean?

01:33:58.345 --> 01:33:59.766
What was he telling us that for?

01:34:01.167 --> 01:34:04.330
That approval ratings of doctors are going down on Google?

01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:05.731
What is that bullshit?

01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:07.933
Let's talk the truth.

01:34:08.888 --> 01:34:10.309
Let's talk transfection.

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:12.872
Let's talk intramuscular injection.

01:34:13.512 --> 01:34:21.179
Let's talk about how the CDC has been lying about infectious disease and gaming the numbers for decades.

01:34:23.161 --> 01:34:23.341
No?

01:34:24.142 --> 01:34:24.742
Not gonna do it?

01:34:25.223 --> 01:34:25.483
Okay.

01:34:26.348 --> 01:34:28.950
real problem, and I wanted to try to turn it around.

01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:34.354
You were 12 hours from going before that first committee.

01:34:35.495 --> 01:34:39.578
Can you believe that this was a vice presidential candidate for shit's sake?

01:34:41.039 --> 01:34:44.882
For this country to see and actually get to meet you.

01:34:44.902 --> 01:34:51.928
And you get a call from the White House saying that your nomination has been rescinded.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:59.103
And I mean, I can't imagine how that must have felt, Dr. Weldon.

01:34:59.123 --> 01:35:04.265
Oh, it was, you know, like being punched in the head.

01:35:04.446 --> 01:35:12.370
I mean, you know, just for your viewers, OK, you know, I got nominated November 22nd.

01:35:13.803 --> 01:35:16.525
And I began a preparation process.

01:35:17.406 --> 01:35:19.387
I mean, he's about to get a fat job.

01:35:19.467 --> 01:35:22.029
So of course he began a preparation process.

01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:25.351
And of course he's disappointed he didn't get the super fat job.

01:35:26.492 --> 01:35:30.774
Just as happy as Jay Bhattacharya is to have gotten that super fat job.

01:35:32.135 --> 01:35:43.303
And the four weeks leading up to that hearing that got canceled, uh, I was basically staying in a hotel in Washington, DC and living out of a suitcase.

01:35:44.127 --> 01:35:48.271
They want you to meet with all the senators on the committee.

01:35:48.371 --> 01:35:51.854
And, you know, a lot of times they move the appointments around.

01:35:51.894 --> 01:35:54.036
And so you just have to be available.

01:35:54.176 --> 01:35:59.120
And so I was doing a lot of research, a lot of meetings for a very, very long time.

01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:10.950
And I thought I had a problem with the confirmation basically coming from Senator Cassidy, maybe one or two of the other committee members.

01:36:12.728 --> 01:36:18.292
but to just get it at the 11th, literally almost the 11th hour, it was 10 o'clock at night.

01:36:18.752 --> 01:36:20.693
And my hearing was 10 o'clock in the morning.

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:31.960
And this poor staff guy at the White House was tasked with the responsibility of telling me, no, we're withdrawing your nomination.

01:36:32.401 --> 01:36:36.743
And of course, that's the news line that Trump withdrew my nomination.

01:36:36.783 --> 01:36:39.345
Well, Trump withdrew my nomination because there were people

01:36:40.163 --> 01:36:43.045
specifically Senator Cassidy, who didn't want me.

01:36:43.525 --> 01:36:51.991
And he specifically didn't want me because, you know, I wanted to do some more research on vaccine safety.

01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:56.634
And he wanted to do some more research on vaccine safety.

01:36:56.654 --> 01:37:04.979
I don't know, maybe they would get around to testing some of the adjuvants or, I mean, I know that's on their list of things to test the adjuvants.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
It might be the adjuvants.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.021
The rest is history.

01:37:07.537 --> 01:37:20.828
Well, Cassidy has a lot of people right now who want him to step down and find him a bit treasonous for interfering with what the American people want.

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:25.932
I think they're using that word on purpose because they're trying to take the teeth out of it.

01:37:26.553 --> 01:37:27.834
It's treason, really.

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:41.164
Treason is when you lie about who you are and you lie about your motives of why you're running for president, or why you're supporting a candidate, or why you are objecting to the coronavirus narrative.

01:37:41.304 --> 01:37:51.490
And all of the people that I put on the screen, like Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone, are traitors in the worst kind of way.

01:37:52.011 --> 01:37:57.674
Not in this flimsy, floofy, meaningless sort of way that this

01:37:58.958 --> 01:38:00.813
podcaster is using the word.

01:38:02.196 --> 01:38:07.777
The American people need a CDC that they can trust, and they don't have that right now.

01:38:08.037 --> 01:38:29.223
And the reason they don't trust it is because of a plurality of reasons, which you so beautifully, and if our listeners haven't read this yet, this is the official statement of Honorable Dave Weldon, MD, regarding recent withdrawal of nomination for CDC.

01:38:30.203 --> 01:38:40.588
And I read this, and I couldn't help but get very emotional because you discuss how we got here.

01:38:40.608 --> 01:38:44.829
And you give a few examples, really, really good examples.

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:46.930
And these are lived examples.

01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:56.514
You know these characters in DC very well because you spent nearly 15 years working on the Hill.

01:38:58.495 --> 01:39:11.426
What you describe is, you describe a situation in which, by far, Big Pharma is the largest presence in D.C.

01:39:11.486 --> 01:39:18.992
lobbying, and you describe having relationships with some of these people that then turned on you.

01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:24.276
You know Dr. Bill Cassidy.

01:39:24.636 --> 01:39:25.997
He's also an internist.

01:39:27.276 --> 01:39:29.537
Um, and you once considered him a friend.

01:39:31.418 --> 01:39:31.698
I did.

01:39:31.718 --> 01:39:42.884
I actually, uh, went to a Christian couples retreat with him and his wife and my wife got to spend time with his wife.

01:39:42.964 --> 01:39:47.247
Now, just because you're Christians doesn't mean you can't disagree on policy and issues.

01:39:48.147 --> 01:39:54.771
Uh, but it was, it was a little surreal to find myself, uh, opposed by, um,

01:39:56.226 --> 01:39:58.027
you know, a colleague, essentially.

01:39:58.087 --> 01:40:08.274
Now, Rand Paul is also a physician, ophthalmologist, not an internist, but, and he was Foursquare trying to help me.

01:40:08.855 --> 01:40:12.877
You know, there's another irony in all this that I didn't include in that letter.

01:40:12.897 --> 01:40:18.962
The CDC director was previously, historically just hired by the secretary.

01:40:19.162 --> 01:40:23.665
So Bobby could have had me in there at the CDC three or four weeks ago,

01:40:25.358 --> 01:40:37.425
The two principal people who wanted to make the CDC nominee confirmable, okay, and that's called Presidential Appointed, Senate Confirmed.

01:40:37.525 --> 01:40:49.331
It's a special category, cabinet officials and key sub-cabinet officials were Tuberville from Alabama and Rand Paul himself, and they were both supporting me.

01:40:49.951 --> 01:40:51.632
They both wanted me in the position.

01:40:53.403 --> 01:40:56.928
And of course, you know, we all know what happened.

01:40:57.269 --> 01:41:01.495
I was going to be the first one to face Senate confirmation.

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:08.584
and it didn't go as planned, at least as Bobby Kennedy wanted.

01:41:08.644 --> 01:41:12.007
And many millions of Americans wanted, including myself.

01:41:12.547 --> 01:41:17.931
Oh, so many millions of Americans were hoping that Dave Weldon would be the CDC director.

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:20.613
Even Pauly Tommy has been hoping since 2017.

01:41:28.154 --> 01:41:36.978
There's a- I guess that makes her like a 10 year failure then if she's been working to get Dave Weldon at the CDC and fix that problem with vaccine research.

01:41:37.478 --> 01:41:43.341
And now, darn it, that's too bad.

01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:44.462
That's a long road.

01:41:44.482 --> 01:41:55.867
You know, there's a story you tell in your letter about Dr. Andy Wakefield that I actually didn't have the full background of.

01:41:57.223 --> 01:41:59.465
And I had the pleasure of meeting.

01:41:59.485 --> 01:42:03.428
I love that you guys found the interior memory pathway.

01:42:05.009 --> 01:42:09.472
It's quite a revelation once you see the symbiosis for what it is.

01:42:10.272 --> 01:42:13.475
I was told to ignore Wakefield that his research was bad.

01:42:13.495 --> 01:42:15.256
And so I did.

01:42:15.276 --> 01:42:18.558
I ignored it for a good number of years.

01:42:18.698 --> 01:42:23.121
So she ignored Wakefield because people told her that Wakefield's research was bad.

01:42:23.482 --> 01:42:25.163
His performance was flawless.

01:42:26.516 --> 01:42:28.598
Their acting was flawless.

01:42:28.678 --> 01:42:30.359
Their theater was flawless.

01:42:30.439 --> 01:42:32.721
It moved 6 million votes.

01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:43.629
And then they took that theater over to the United States, tried to apply it to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I guess, and the Trump administration.

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:44.710
It's just gross.

01:42:47.752 --> 01:42:50.555
And in your letter, you describe

01:42:51.753 --> 01:43:07.176
Um, his co-author, an Irish virologist, O'Leary, who he co-published, um... It's funny that they want to talk about people that published with Andrew Wakefield, but they don't want to talk about Peter Daszak, who published with Andrew Wakefield.

01:43:07.196 --> 01:43:16.817
You know, that... that EcoHealth Alliance guy with the... with the diffuse proposal that... that... that Charles Rix... Rixey risked everything to bring to light.

01:43:22.473 --> 01:43:24.355
one of Wakefield's 15 papers.

01:43:24.395 --> 01:43:28.539
So Wakefield published 15 papers, and only one was withdrawn.

01:43:28.559 --> 01:43:33.704
It was that famous paper in The Lancet that he co-published with O'Leary.

01:43:33.724 --> 01:43:37.829
And you describe with great detail.

01:43:38.349 --> 01:43:39.410
Great detail.

01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.750
The PCR.

01:43:39.771 --> 01:43:40.271
The PCR.

01:43:45.236 --> 01:43:48.319
the samples and how they showed strain.

01:43:48.379 --> 01:43:52.103
Is she not the most compelling podcast host you've ever, ever seen?

01:43:52.243 --> 01:44:01.773
Of the virus in the vaccine strain measles virus in the biopsies, in the bowel biopsies of the children.

01:44:02.884 --> 01:44:03.084
Yes.

01:44:03.264 --> 01:44:09.066
And so, um, you, you, your, it didn't sound, it doesn't sound like she prepared very well for this, does it?

01:44:09.106 --> 01:44:13.167
And now they're going to go on to tell everybody how Andrew Wakefield is great.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:14.447
And his data is great.

01:44:14.507 --> 01:44:16.828
And he's just the best guy.

01:44:17.288 --> 01:44:23.010
And he's of the highest ethical standards, yada, yada, yada, or, or you think I'm full of it.

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:25.631
Self looked at the results.

01:44:26.971 --> 01:44:29.672
Yes, that was, you know,

01:44:32.261 --> 01:44:34.182
It amazes me to this day.

01:44:34.202 --> 01:45:00.736
I actually sat down with O'Leary and PCR stands for polymer polymerase chain reaction and he clearly showed that these were vaccine strain viral particles infecting the intestinal tract of these these children and It caused

01:45:02.401 --> 01:45:08.967
many parents to start refusing the measles vaccine, the MMR, in England.

01:45:09.247 --> 01:45:11.849
And then, of course, they started having measles outbreaks.

01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:19.916
And retelling this story is actually the hamster wheel incarnate.

01:45:21.015 --> 01:45:28.877
There's no excuse for this story to be being told right now on this podcast in 2025.

01:45:29.337 --> 01:45:32.478
This is old bullshit history.

01:45:33.858 --> 01:45:37.919
It is old bullshit questions with bullshit answers.

01:45:38.339 --> 01:45:42.941
And they're telling it like it's history that nobody wants to talk about.

01:45:43.561 --> 01:45:45.301
Oh my goodness.

01:45:45.781 --> 01:45:48.182
British health officials basically pressured

01:45:48.991 --> 01:45:53.353
O'Leary into withdrawing his statements.

01:45:53.393 --> 01:45:58.194
I'm only going to let this go until you hear him say that Andrew Wakefield is the greatest guy.

01:45:58.214 --> 01:46:01.375
You know, and then they went after Wakefield's license.

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:14.120
So the tagline in the media is always repeating it all over the place that paper was withdrawn, Wakefield lost his license, portraying him as being this disreputable, unethical

01:46:14.878 --> 01:46:16.439
person and it couldn't be further.

01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:18.880
The truth couldn't be further from that.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.381
I mean, it's just it's breathtaking.

01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:28.304
Thank God for the Internet and thank God for podcasts like yours.

01:46:28.584 --> 01:46:35.867
And I have invitations to do more of these down the road because more and more people are getting very, very well informed.

01:46:36.567 --> 01:46:43.330
And it's only going to undermine and cause more problems for CDC if they don't face this head on.

01:46:43.902 --> 01:46:51.829
What I wanted the CDC to do way back then, 20 years ago, was to just repeat Wakefield's study.

01:46:52.349 --> 01:46:58.915
Just do the bowel biopsies, send the specimens off, do the PCR.

01:46:59.974 --> 01:47:02.356
Because that's the way science is supposed to work.

01:47:02.456 --> 01:47:12.204
Science is supposed to work when you publish a sort of a revolutionary, iconoclastic... I don't think you need to see any more to know where this is going, right?

01:47:12.264 --> 01:47:14.966
This is pure narrative nonsense.

01:47:15.466 --> 01:47:22.672
And quite frankly, I think it is such a ridiculous admission to have a video from 2017 on the original vaxxed bus

01:47:25.274 --> 01:47:39.862
interviewing Brandy Vaughn and having behind the camera one Pauly Tommy from the UK who was on billboards in 2010 not trying to save anyone from making another autistic kid.

01:47:40.722 --> 01:47:45.965
Not trying to save anyone from injuring another child, but advocating for

01:47:46.713 --> 01:47:54.075
better educational opportunities for the existing autistic kids, in a bra, on 90 billboards.

01:47:54.855 --> 01:48:06.619
Now, supposedly, that organization, Children's Health Defense, backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is at the forefront of this, and this interview is at the forefront of this.

01:48:10.057 --> 01:48:14.941
If you are not from America, I am pleading you, pleading to you for help.

01:48:15.181 --> 01:48:16.362
America needs help.

01:48:16.542 --> 01:48:22.567
We are captured by an anti-vaccine movement that is fake and full of traitors.

01:48:23.528 --> 01:48:25.750
I think they're on the same team as Tony Fauci.

01:48:27.991 --> 01:48:30.013
Get somebody to try to repeat it.

01:48:30.253 --> 01:48:32.495
And a lot of times, they can't.

01:48:34.176 --> 01:48:34.917
How about this one?

01:48:36.072 --> 01:48:36.913
This one's extraordinary.

01:48:36.933 --> 01:48:46.100
Is there any evidence that vaccines or the adjuvants for vaccines or anything about vaccines and their delivery can disrupt mitochondrial function?

01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:58.110
You know, so often... Think about how extraordinary it is that our new Biology 101 has something very, very, very unique and interesting to say about mitochondria.

01:48:58.991 --> 01:49:09.601
And it's not unique and interesting to say that mitochondria are endosymbionts, primary symbionts, remnants of bacteria that we've now adopted essentially as organelles.

01:49:09.981 --> 01:49:20.050
But what is very interesting to say is that the phages from our endosymbionts, the ones that are in our gut, our ectosymbionts,

01:49:23.393 --> 01:49:35.535
Those phages are free to pass through our body, which means that they're free to be selected for by our immune system, and they are free to communicate with maybe the mitochondria in every cell of our body.

01:49:35.956 --> 01:49:37.216
And it would make perfect sense.

01:49:39.316 --> 01:49:52.479
And it would be part of a magnificent symbiosis that would be an incredibly loud background of signaling, not a sterile background that we can find individual coronaviruses on.

01:49:54.139 --> 01:50:09.512
not a sterile background that we can find individual measles viruses on, but an infinitesimally dense background of phages and bacterial signals that are free to move through our body.

01:50:11.434 --> 01:50:16.719
If bacteria can move through your body, escorted by your immune system, and pass through

01:50:18.655 --> 01:50:33.344
the milk of lactating mothers, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very big problem on our hands because we do not understand our biology the way that the CDC and the NIAID and the NIH want us to believe that we understand it.

01:50:34.885 --> 01:50:36.345
We don't understand anything then.

01:50:37.786 --> 01:50:40.368
And that means they've been lying to us for a very long time.

01:50:41.749 --> 01:50:43.990
And I think Joshua Lederberg knew they were going to do it.

01:50:45.757 --> 01:50:48.100
Mitochondria, are you shitting me?

01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:51.803
Don't forget that the spike protein attacks mitochondria.

01:50:52.204 --> 01:50:56.969
And Walter Chestnut's been on the internet saying that for like literally five years.

01:50:59.271 --> 01:51:00.592
And Jessica Rose too.

01:51:00.693 --> 01:51:02.074
Jessica Rose has done a lot of that.

01:51:02.214 --> 01:51:03.696
And we think that it's like.

01:51:04.636 --> 01:51:11.782
the vaccine having a specific effect on what the vaccine was designed to target that could potentially cause side effects or something like that.

01:51:12.043 --> 01:51:15.105
I mean, phages affecting our cells is also very possible.

01:51:15.125 --> 01:51:16.146
Of course, that's possible.

01:51:17.367 --> 01:51:23.213
Many of the theories hold, but given the key role of mitochondria

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:25.691
in all aspects of brain functioning.

01:51:26.192 --> 01:51:33.377
And given that some... See, he's got a script that he's reading and he's trying to stay on brain functioning because he is hyper-trained to stay in his lane.

01:51:33.877 --> 01:51:41.363
He's got to make sure that he couches all of his questions in his own expertise so that he doesn't feel like he's stepping on anybody's toes.

01:51:41.743 --> 01:51:45.446
And more importantly, he doesn't feel like he's taking any risks as a professional.

01:51:46.047 --> 01:51:49.950
This is how pathetic these brainwashed mental midgets are.

01:51:51.235 --> 01:51:54.398
I used to be one of them, so I know very well what I'm listening to.

01:51:54.418 --> 01:51:58.221
This Huber guy is one of the worst liars on the internet.

01:51:58.261 --> 01:52:02.364
He has taken advantage of everything that he could possibly take advantage of.

01:52:02.804 --> 01:52:16.335
His good looks, his testosterone treatments, his MMA buddies, his tough guys, his everything, everything, everything, everything is done for his media.

01:52:17.075 --> 01:52:26.178
enrichment and for his role in this ridiculous governance by personalities and by podcasts.

01:52:28.719 --> 01:52:29.879
He is awful.

01:52:30.519 --> 01:52:36.601
And if he's ever given out good ideas and ever given out good information, it was before he was co-opted during COVID.

01:52:37.061 --> 01:52:39.082
Now he's just a fake.

01:52:39.922 --> 01:52:42.603
And this podcast is just absurd.

01:52:43.755 --> 01:52:51.120
And if Mr. Huberman ever watches this and feels a little bit hurt by it, please feel free.

01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:59.106
I would have hours of discussion with you about how much of an idiot you are relative to a true biologist.

01:52:59.206 --> 01:53:05.190
You're masquerading as a biologist in your neuroscientist clothing.

01:53:05.290 --> 01:53:06.131
Like it's a joke.

01:53:10.339 --> 01:53:18.121
convinced, I'm not saying I believe this, but are convinced that vaccines are tied to these mental health challenges or to autism, let's be direct about this.

01:53:18.841 --> 01:53:20.442
Is there any evidence that vaccines can?

01:53:21.042 --> 01:53:25.763
And remember, 2013, Brian would not allow him to use the word autism.

01:53:25.803 --> 01:53:28.544
He would just call it neurological damage from vaccination.

01:53:29.064 --> 01:53:34.145
It should be called neurological damage from intramuscular injection.

01:53:35.686 --> 01:53:36.526
Let's just be real.

01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:41.252
It is neurological damage from intramuscular injection.

01:53:41.372 --> 01:53:43.194
It's damage from intramuscular injection.

01:53:43.214 --> 01:53:44.535
It doesn't have to be neurological.

01:53:45.255 --> 01:53:46.436
Could be physiological.

01:53:46.936 --> 01:53:48.457
It could be metabolic.

01:53:53.921 --> 01:53:55.222
Gosh, I hate these fakes.

01:53:55.702 --> 01:54:00.025
Of any kind can disrupt mitochondrial function or support mitochondrial function for that matter.

01:54:00.851 --> 01:54:03.513
It is a contentious.

01:54:03.553 --> 01:54:04.194
Maybe it's a different.

01:54:04.354 --> 01:54:05.635
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:54:05.675 --> 01:54:12.600
And I definitely I'm definitely going to answer it, but I'm going to give a long winded answer, if that's OK, because I because I want whatever I want to give credible information.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:12.800
Yeah.

01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:14.922
And I know that's the only information we're interested.

01:54:14.962 --> 01:54:19.225
And I don't want to come down on one side that vaccines are 100 percent safe.

01:54:19.245 --> 01:54:20.726
There is no question about it.

01:54:21.947 --> 01:54:23.888
Or yes, vaccines cause autism.

01:54:23.928 --> 01:54:28.650
And that's why we've got skyrocketing rates of autism, because I don't think either of those extreme positions is true.

01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:31.211
And so he has no explanation at all, then.

01:54:32.911 --> 01:54:38.433
So this is just it's just the absolute most malevolent bullshit ever.

01:54:39.954 --> 01:54:44.355
And either these people are unwitting and therefore just really dumb.

01:54:46.076 --> 01:54:48.137
And that's probably the way it is with this guy.

01:54:48.956 --> 01:54:55.861
He just wants to say the right thing so that his rising star keeps rising, just like the jackass on the other microphone.

01:54:55.881 --> 01:54:57.762
They don't have thoughts of their own.

01:54:58.283 --> 01:55:02.606
They're not trying to evaluate the world and come up with their own ideas.

01:55:02.646 --> 01:55:05.448
They are trying very hard to play a political game.

01:55:05.948 --> 01:55:07.869
They're climbing a ladder of the elite.

01:55:08.230 --> 01:55:11.432
They are auditioning for greater roles in this show.

01:55:12.674 --> 01:55:14.897
They've just seen Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:14.917 --> 01:55:17.299
get all the way to HHS Secretary.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:21.764
They've just seen Jayanta Bhattacharya get all the way to NIH.

01:55:21.824 --> 01:55:26.390
They know that if they do it right, there's big things for big people.

01:55:31.912 --> 01:55:37.335
So I want to first back up and just ask a slightly different question.

01:55:38.275 --> 01:55:42.937
Is there any evidence that high levels of inflammation impair mitochondrial function?

01:55:43.338 --> 01:55:45.399
Oh, high levels of inflammation.

01:55:45.459 --> 01:55:46.199
Now, here we go.

01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:47.600
And I'll just summarize it for you.

01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.540
Guess what they're going to say.

01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:51.662
We should use AI to fix chronic disease.

01:55:55.069 --> 01:56:01.952
they're gonna say that it's not just vaccines, but it's vaccines given during a state of inflammation.

01:56:02.132 --> 01:56:03.853
Oh, wow, isn't that interesting?

01:56:03.893 --> 01:56:11.457
That's the same thing that Suzanne Humphrey says repeatedly since 2018 and then on the Joe Rogan show.

01:56:12.137 --> 01:56:13.818
And yeah, it's really gross.

01:56:20.492 --> 01:56:22.434
Ladies and gentlemen, these are all liars.

01:56:22.494 --> 01:56:29.180
They're put in place, wittingly or unwittingly, to cover people like Brandy and cover biology like mine.

01:56:30.652 --> 01:56:33.314
And it's not my biology, but I'm the only one teaching it.

01:56:33.534 --> 01:56:44.282
And it's not my politics, but I seem to be the only one besides Mark Kulak who's able to point out why it would be that these particular clowns would jump out of the car in 2020.

01:56:45.202 --> 01:56:47.824
Why these particular clowns were put in place.

01:56:48.485 --> 01:56:51.007
Why these particular clowns contacted me.

01:56:51.407 --> 01:56:53.488
Why these particular clowns paid me.

01:56:56.771 --> 01:56:58.512
And why now no one will talk to me.

01:57:00.353 --> 01:57:04.737
The only way to understand it is I think that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:57:04.897 --> 01:57:11.804
I think the way to teach your children to think about pharmaceuticals is that there's a huge difference between injection and ingestion.

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:17.689
And I think you should teach people that this was always transfection and transfecting healthy people is nuts.

01:57:18.590 --> 01:57:24.236
And I think since 2013, Brian Hooker has been more than equipped to say those words.

01:57:25.168 --> 01:57:29.369
and he's chosen not to, probably because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:34.490
and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass convinced him that eventually they would do it together.

01:57:41.571 --> 01:57:44.391
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud.

01:57:44.411 --> 01:57:53.733
I gotta really say, I think, where is my beater head?

01:57:55.228 --> 01:57:58.816
Yep, right there that goes there you

01:57:59.884 --> 01:58:02.265
Synthetic recombinant genetics is all they really got.

01:58:02.305 --> 01:58:05.487
What that means is that they can make large quantities of DNA.

01:58:05.527 --> 01:58:09.049
And large quantities of DNA are exactly how they transfect things.

01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:13.892
It's exactly how they make synthetic biologics at all pharmaceutical companies.

01:58:13.952 --> 01:58:24.779
And therefore all these people that descend from pharma already knew a long time ago that making the mRNA using bacterial cultures was going to result in an impure mRNA.

01:58:25.499 --> 01:58:27.681
and also a contaminated RNA.

01:58:28.101 --> 01:58:30.963
And so acting surprised about it is ridiculous.

01:58:31.043 --> 01:58:36.787
And in fact, ladies and gentlemen, saying that they found SV40 is also ridiculous.

01:58:36.807 --> 01:58:36.867
Why?

01:58:37.327 --> 01:58:51.598
Because at every university, in every place in the Western world, in every pharmaceutical company that's making a biologic, they are probably using the sequence of SV40 to drive the expression of plasmids in bacteria.

01:58:52.398 --> 01:59:08.719
That means everywhere that this process is happening, there's a potentially an SV40 gene sequence being produced in high pure quantities and being carried home on shoes, being inhaled, being aerosolized, being a background signal

01:59:10.834 --> 01:59:14.395
and maybe integrating, who knows, maybe being in somebody's gut, who knows.

01:59:15.056 --> 01:59:32.363
But to say that every SV40 signal in the world is based on Pfizer's vaccine is so stupid, and such a lie, that only someone like the Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project could go on stage repeatedly and tell that lie.

01:59:33.752 --> 01:59:40.316
Ladies and gentlemen, all they would need to do is release a small synthetic pure quantity of the sequence they wanted to find anywhere they wanted to find it.

01:59:40.356 --> 01:59:46.480
And it would be very findable by PCR and sequencing reactions with primers aimed at it.

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:49.963
Especially if you had an agent in Wuhan paid to do it.

01:59:50.463 --> 01:59:53.105
Ladies and gentlemen, transfection was always a crime.

01:59:53.505 --> 01:59:56.006
The way they got away with it is most of them were placebo.

01:59:56.026 --> 01:59:59.449
That's probably the way they get away with the vaccine schedule and in general.

02:00:00.209 --> 02:00:03.350
Merck gets away with the vaccine schedule in general.

02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:07.251
Ladies and gentlemen, teach your kids that endemicity is a lie.

02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:08.391
It's a mythology.

02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:10.552
It's a basis for all of this shit.

02:00:11.572 --> 02:00:15.913
Things cannot go from being a molecule in a mud puddle to endemicity.

02:00:16.373 --> 02:00:17.394
That is nonsense.

02:00:17.474 --> 02:00:23.355
Ladies and gentlemen, this was a background signal that was exaggerated with non-specific PCR tests.

02:00:23.515 --> 02:00:24.655
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:00:24.696 --> 02:00:26.276
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:00:26.776 --> 02:00:31.881
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime and the population pyramid is a problem that needed solving.

02:00:32.501 --> 02:00:33.662
Thanks very much for being here.

02:00:33.682 --> 02:00:34.763
I hope you have a good evening.

02:00:35.164 --> 02:00:41.149
I don't think I'm going to do a show on Sunday, but I will be here again for a whole week, Tuesday through Friday.

02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:43.611
Same schedule as last week.

02:00:45.393 --> 02:00:47.515
I have to look it up what the exact schedule was again.

02:00:47.535 --> 02:00:48.757
Let me see.

02:00:48.777 --> 02:00:54.903
Over here, I'm going to go to gigaohm.home.

02:00:54.923 --> 02:00:57.646
I'm going to grab this and put it over here.

02:00:57.667 --> 02:00:59.729
I'm going to make it big.

02:01:01.110 --> 02:01:03.913
And then I'm going to scroll down and I see

02:01:05.526 --> 02:01:29.065
Tuesday's taco Tuesday, so it could be anything you just have to show up and see what I'm serving And then Wednesday will be the journal club for biology 101 I'll post those papers up by email soon, and then we'll have a lecture on biology 101 on Thursday And then Friday we'll have another one of these shows They got postponed because I got a little thrown off this week I'm gonna start shooting on the basketball court now.

02:01:29.106 --> 02:01:30.547
I've got really far ahead.

02:01:30.647 --> 02:01:31.708
I'm finally in shape and

02:01:32.248 --> 02:01:37.396
Today I can finally hang on the rim comfortably with just one step.

02:01:37.936 --> 02:01:39.959
It's taken me about two months to get there.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.042
I'm very very proud of myself.

02:01:42.243 --> 02:01:46.529
I've actually been on the gym floor, jumping rope,

02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:50.851
91 days out of the last 96 days.

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:55.752
And I'm doing it all for Ego Home Biological on the hardwoods.

02:01:55.812 --> 02:01:59.393
So I don't know if it's going to be worth it or not, but I'm certainly in better shape than I was.

02:01:59.993 --> 02:02:05.674
I'm spending a lot of time with my kids, and it's all because I've got a few supporters out there.

02:02:06.314 --> 02:02:06.975
Thank you very much.

02:02:07.335 --> 02:02:08.135
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
