WEBVTT

01:30.000 --> 01:51.000
I fixed the stream with Dennis, and I should have it up on Rumble and Vimeo overnight.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I'll put a link up in a few places so people can share that.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
It was a really good recording. It actually jumped a couple times, so it might happen again tonight.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
We'll see. I didn't really ever figure out what caused it, so we'll see.

02:57.000 --> 03:10.000
He's scheduled for 16 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
But there's still one thing on top. What happened to the real mummy?

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
It's my own test, Dusty.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I found the mummy.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Well, gang, I guess that wraps up the mystery, and the mummy, too.

03:56.000 --> 04:17.000
We're going to understand that you're in the city of the A's.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes, yes, two days ago. One side stood your seat.

04:26.000 --> 04:40.000
I didn't have to remind me again about what that inside I had on the stream a couple of days ago.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
There's been a lot of stuff happening. It's been hard to keep track of all of it.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Give me another hand to maybe it'll spark something, and I'll start with that.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
By myself, you're having a piece.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh, yeah, now I remember a good, good hand. Excellent, good hand.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
That's about antibodies and neutralization in Vivo and Vitro.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Good one, that's right. I remember.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We've been misleading the young about a lot of things.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
That's one of the things we've been misleading the young about my goodness.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
All these in Vitro assays and what they really mean or don't mean.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
We've got to learn our history before it's race forever because that's where these assays all came from, is this history.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
If we figure that out, we can take it back from these challenges of convinced.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm convinced we're making progress even though it doesn't sound like it in my voice.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I really think we're making progress.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I see bricks for sure.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I see bricks because there wasn't any evidence of spreading New York City.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
I see it, but I see bricks because infectious clones are the only real way that they can make something like this.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
I see bricks because placebo batches were likely distributed.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
And I see bricks because I knew transfection was a bad idea before they ever rolled it out.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
Shoot, I see bricks because protocols were murder, gain of function as a mythology.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
They tried to fool us into solving this mystery and all of these people are still committed to lying.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That's why I see bricks.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
That's why you see bricks.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The bricks at the back of the theater.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
It's really hard to tell with people who have taken the shot,

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
because they're probably really taking in social media and trying to digest it, and that can hurt you.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
This is Kego on Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by Biologist.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It's the 11th of October, 2023.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Welcome to the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
It is the 11th of October of 2023.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And this is Kego on Biological.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Thanks to the people scrolling at the top of the screen we exist.

07:47.000 --> 07:57.000
And although I've been an independent biologist for about three years now, I'm also a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Although here at Kego on Biological I speak for myself and for Kego on Biological and the views expressed

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
on this show have nothing to do with that aforementioned non-profit organization.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm simply here to share my opinions from a starship.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
You wouldn't want to take any medical advice from a biologist of a starship.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Don't take the bait on TV and social media.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm not saying that there's fake stuff on TV and that you shouldn't watch it

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
or try to figure out what's going on in the world.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm saying that no matter what's going on in the world they're going to try and use it, twist it, contort it, invert it

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
in order to make us fight and in order to make us ask the wrong question.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
One of my good friends expressed it this way and I do think it's a very, very good way of saying that they have tricked us

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
into asking the wrong questions for a real long time.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
And asking the wrong questions does not get you the answers you need.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
And that's what social media and that's what TV and that's what the bait on TV and social media does.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
It gets you to ask the wrong question.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
It gets you to attribute, cause and effect relationships incorrectly.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
And that's extremely dangerous to our democracy.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
We are, yeah, we're trying to solve this mystery of who set us up for this Scooby-Doo, how long they've been setting us up

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and how much of it's a set up, but it's a lot.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
It's a lot.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
And that's because for a very long time people under the tutelage of Henry Kissinger have been thinking

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
that it's not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

09:52.000 --> 10:03.000
And it is this collection of players that we've been trying to dissect over the last three years to try and figure out what's going on.

10:03.000 --> 10:16.000
And it's the illusion of consensus that they have created both on TV and in the mainstream as well as behind the scenes in the dissident groups.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
There has been also an illusion of consensus created.

10:22.000 --> 10:39.000
And this illusion of consensus has brought the dissident movement and the mainstream movement trying to solve this mystery to the same conclusion as if they went to the same address from two different starting points.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And that was, I believe, by design.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
And you can see it because the people who are elevated by pseudo censorship, people, I'm sorry, I'm going to really stop doing this.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
The last time I watched myself and saw myself do this, I got very angry.

10:58.000 --> 11:07.000
So we should make a button or something that you can push the X key when I do that and it will cause my chair to buzz me or something, but I'm not going to do it anymore.

11:08.000 --> 11:31.000
But this illusion of consensus that has been created by this perceived dissident debate about where did the virus come from and did they really cover it up and which of these parties is lying has all been an elaborate theater designed to get all of us to fall for the same

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
trick to ask the wrong question and accept the same wrong answer.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
And once we accept the same wrong answer on the left and on the right, the entire system is usurped.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
We are trapped and worse.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Our children are trapped because they will grow up with adults that don't understand the cage.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And they don't understand why the cheese is free.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
And that's why we need to work so hard right now to get people to understand the transfection is not immunization.

12:08.000 --> 12:18.000
And we need to get people to really understand that immunization is something that we understand a lot less about than we then they have claimed.

12:19.000 --> 12:29.000
Because there has been no legal or or economic reason for them to investigate the technology further.

12:30.000 --> 12:46.000
Because once something is classified as a vaccine and you show that it that it works almost did it that you actually have quite an easy time after that there will be no evaluation.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
There's no way that anything that happens in the VICP is going to push through to disqualify your product.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
And this is where we are. And so we need to start understanding the immunology.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
We need to start understanding our immunology well enough.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
So that saying the words intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
When you say those words it should make so much sense.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
Because you get this little cartoon in your head of how the immune system is organized around barriers.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
It's organized around sites of infection.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's organized around lymph nodes.

13:32.000 --> 13:43.000
It's organized around the lymph the lymphatic system and it's organized around the continuous defense of this barrier from the inside out.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
And therefore augmenting that system by putting something on the very inside of that which it is supposed to defend.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It's not the best idea.

13:56.000 --> 14:07.000
And so yesterday there were the audio was completely destroyed.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I haven't looked over here but I guess nobody's complaining.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
The audio was completely destroyed yesterday but I was able to line it back up.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
I'm not really sure what happened.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
It could have just been that my computer was on for a long time and I was doing a lot of things all day.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
It doesn't really matter.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
If it's not working or not happening now then we somehow figured it out.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
We talked about this Lancet paper.

14:29.000 --> 14:43.000
How this Lancet paper had said that the COVID-19 vaccinations could be calculated using a mathematical model to have saved between 14 and 19 million lives around the world.

14:44.000 --> 15:06.000
And now that the RNA has been awarded the Nobel Prize, of course this claim has also been used in New York Times and other articles to further cast wonderful trumpets and sunshine on the mRNA technology.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
And as reported in the Lancet this technology has saved almost 20 million people.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
And so with careful inspection using a lot of the work that he's already done with all cause mortality around the world.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I guess I should stay there.

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
Denny was able to put together a little paper using the data that he had already compiled from all cause mortality numbers around the world.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
And using the data that he had already compiled about all of the shots rolled out.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Because of course the vaccines can't save anybody before they were rolled out.

15:48.000 --> 16:09.000
And Denny and his colleagues had previously done work where they had taken the number of vaccines administered over time and graphed them in a cumulative line so that you can see zero vaccination up to some fully vaccinated state or, you know, wherever the highest number is.

16:10.000 --> 16:18.000
And so you would expect that as that line went up you'd expect the all cause mortality to go down right because it's saving lives.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And of course there's no such signal.

16:22.000 --> 16:38.000
And in fact when the countermeasures the the transfections are rolled out in time with a huge media campaign there's more likely to be a pretty strong signal in the all cause mortality that correlates with them.

16:40.000 --> 16:51.000
And so he was able to do that. I think it's a really nice paper. We had a really nice discussion about it. As I mentioned earlier, I reset the time and and I'll put that up later on the website and on rumble and et cetera.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And I hope you'll share it with people.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Tonight we're going to look at Campbell and Doug leash.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't know how to say his name. He's a real nice guy. They're both really nice guys.

17:02.000 --> 17:16.000
And a lot of people on my last video came to defend both Campbell and Professor DeGlish and and the Glish. I don't know how to say it. I apologize. I'm sure it's going to get corrected right now.

17:16.000 --> 17:29.000
Because they've come so far, especially John Campbell has come so far and he's been on YouTube for a long time.

17:29.000 --> 17:38.000
And he and he didn't want to jeopardize his channel. And so he's had to be very careful.

17:38.000 --> 17:49.000
And he's had some videos taken down. And so he's got to be very careful and I understand all of that to a certain extent.

17:49.000 --> 18:05.000
But at some moment, we're going to they're going to have to come to realize that they're in action or their inability to actually say it out loud their inability to find a better way.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
To awaken is just delaying and inevitable and causing more harm.

18:12.000 --> 18:20.000
More people to get farther down the road where it's harder to turn around and see what happened.

18:20.000 --> 18:30.000
And that's part of what the extremely long time it took for John Campbell to wake up. I want to I want to give him credit.

18:30.000 --> 18:38.000
But it's like at some moment, you know, when the when people are all dead and buried for a year or two.

18:38.000 --> 18:47.000
And people have been hurt for like a year or two and you didn't do anything. You didn't say anything. You ignored people.

18:48.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't know. If John Campbell didn't do that, then he's definitely a good guy and we need to support him. But we need to also bring him to understand that he's still under this enchantment that is the Scooby-Doo mystery.

19:04.000 --> 19:13.000
And he's still patting himself on the back for having finally figured it out, albeit a year or two to late.

19:14.000 --> 19:22.000
And in this video, I'm going to try and be very sweet because again, everybody seems to like these guys and want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

19:22.000 --> 19:41.000
But we are in 2023. We are in October of 2023. Do not forget that in 2020 and in 2021, neither of these guys was doing anything to get anybody to stop transfecting themselves.

19:43.000 --> 20:02.000
And they still aren't really questioning the existence of a virus relative to the existence of some really nasty protocols, some really nasty choices, and some really nasty lies that had some really nasty consequences.

20:02.000 --> 20:15.000
And they are confused. And so we need to really see it for what it is because this is the Scooby-Doo resolution on the TV narrative side.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
This is the Scooby-Doo resolution on the YouTube narrative side because this is not crushed from YouTube.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
This video has not been taken down. John Campbell still has his channel.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
And so this is not, and let me say it again, this is not the dissident narrative.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
This is the resolution of the Scooby-Doo as the two stories come together.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
As we are made to feel like, see, we were right.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
And these people are made to feel like, Oh, wow, I guess we were a little bit wrong about that, but we weren't wrong about everything else.

20:58.000 --> 21:08.000
And so then it's kind of like a rub, right? Because we're going to end up being wrong because 19 million people were saved by the mRNA and the mRNA was contaminated.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
So once we fix it, it'll be fine. And they were wrong about the lab leak.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
But, you know, that's okay. You guys were wrong about the shot.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
You see?

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
It's very, very scary where we are and we cannot be too excited about it, I don't think, but I'm going to watch this video because

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
a lot of people seem to think that John Campbell is on the right way.

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
And I don't, I don't want to break anybody's body burst anybody's bubble, but John Campbell has always been a hundred percent on book.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
And recall, please, that the Scooby-Doo mystery needs to resolve.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
And that's what makes the, the, the whole enchantment so wonderful.

22:01.000 --> 22:14.000
Is that it will resolve to where the vast majority of people that disagree about gay marriage and disagree about, about transsexuality and disagree about abortion will agree that this was obviously a lab leak.

22:16.000 --> 22:25.000
Which means that they all just agree, even though they don't agree on abortion or gay rights or transsexuality, they all agree that gain a function.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Viruses are real.

22:28.000 --> 22:42.000
And these people who can't agree about Donald Trump or endangered species or climate change will agree that gain a function viruses are the most likely cause of the pandemic and therefore they could come again.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
Please, please start to really understand what I'm trying to propose.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
So that if it's right and it feels right to you, you can also share it with other people.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Because it's possible that a bunch of dudes in a room came up with this idea a long time ago.

23:07.000 --> 23:20.000
It's possible that a bunch of dudes said, how can we use a harmless, ubiquitous RNA signal to our advantage?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Well, we could call it a virus. Yeah. Well, what is what good does that do?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Well, we could say it causes the common cold, it causes respiratory.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Okay. Well, what good does that do?

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Maybe we can use it for vaccines or something. What is good does that do?

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, maybe we can blame it for a really bad virus.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You see where we're going here? It's a background signal.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
They've known it's a background signal for decades.

23:53.000 --> 24:03.000
And they have used that background signal and called it novel based on a preponderance of evidence of detection.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And that detection is based on nothing.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
Nothing that they've proven or shown previously that can detect how they're detecting.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
They say they're detecting it.

24:17.000 --> 24:28.000
Previously, PCR would have been used as a pan coronavirus test, not a specific one, a pan coronavirus test.

24:29.000 --> 24:38.000
Once you identify the presence of a coronavirus, you need to carefully and painstakingly attempt to sequence it.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
There's never been a specific coronavirus PCR test for a specific coronavirus.

24:47.000 --> 24:57.000
And it's really annoying how many of these poser molecular biologists and poser armchair biologists won't just say that.

24:58.000 --> 25:14.000
You can go back in the literature and find absolutely zero examples of PCR being used to differentiate between different coronaviruses in the same sample.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
It's not done.

25:16.000 --> 25:26.000
It's not done because PCR doesn't work that way and because coronavirus sequences don't work that way.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
And that's part of this illusion, this part of this fidelity illusion.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And now one thing I want you to see in this video, I'm just going to preface it.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
You're going to see it is it's finally dawned on me where this name came from.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
But DeGliche has published with Dr. Quay from Australia.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And he was on one of Dr. Quay's original publications.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
And so from my perspective, we're in really drastic territory.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
We are in worst case scenario, team territory.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
We are in red team, blue team in the beginning of 2020 territory.

26:08.000 --> 26:33.000
And Dr. Quay is definitely one of these people who has a really weird CV to be so out in front of a fear and cleavage site and so insistent that changing for or even two amino acids or with funny codons for arginine somehow makes the RNA able to circle the globe.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
We're going to interrupt and talk about it.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
It's a crazy time right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's a real crazy time.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Oh, I thought I had it up there.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Shoot.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Sorry about that.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Me thought I had it up here.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Where did I have it?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
History, I should be history, right?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
That worked.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
No.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Back.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Sorry, this is out of different screens, so it's just a little funny.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Yes, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
Now, today we wanted to talk about viral origins, talking about the SARS coronavirus to virus.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Where the heck did it come from?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And you rumbled this.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
You were on the ball on this earlier than anyone else as far as I'm aware.

27:33.000 --> 27:47.000
Just tell us what your background is in that field of study and why you were able to get to the right conclusion or what I perceive now as the right conclusion so much quicker than as far as I know the rest of the academic medical world.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
Well, this goes back to the fact that there's a lot of research in HIV and I've been working in HIV for a long time.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.000
And I picked up at this obsession with using HIV envelope as the vaccine was completely.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
This is the vaccine for eggs.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
HIV was completely flawed because it had 3000 antigens in it, which present this to immune system as an antigen.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
It's basically just going to get confused.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
It's a decoy, a decoy.

28:13.000 --> 28:20.000
And the more that we looked at malarized the virus, which I got into doing because I found the CD4 as the receptor, which has hailed as a great discovery.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I don't think it's anything on power of things I've done since.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
It's still pretty good.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
The CD4 is the receptor on the white cell that the AIDS virus binds into.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Absolutely.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And just next to it is a region called C5.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
And we realized that this was probably the Achilles heel of the virus.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
This was over the months and years and years.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
This was no overnight.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
And it was by pursuing a lot of avenues and finding.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
It was a bit like Occam's razor that eliminated absolutely everything up.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
This was the only thing that stood the test of time.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
And it was the only thing that you didn't make responses to if you did the vaccine because the other things drowned it all out.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
So I realized this was the Achilles heel.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And I predicted all the failures of the virus.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
I was furious because we had all our applications turned down by the NIH, which I now realized as Fauci.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Fauci didn't understand it.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
The Gates Foundation, we now know the two of them work very closely about how things should be funded.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
I don't believe that if these things were properly peer reviewed, as we've told them, they would have been rejected given how logically we laid it up.

29:19.000 --> 29:29.000
And because of this and all the work I've done on this, I was contacted through an old PhD student who was working for a company in Norway, which was working on an HIV vaccine.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
With the same philosophy, get rid of as much as you can.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
Go for those concerned elements that if they no longer exist, the virus no longer exists.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Get rid of anything that might be a decoy.

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
So that's an interesting statement that to get rid of all the things that if you get rid of them, the virus no longer exists.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
So that's, that's more or less what I'm talking about.

29:52.000 --> 30:00.000
If you focus on the things that are necessary for the virus to exist that are functionally constrained, you're going to be fine.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
And unfortunately for virology and for public health, your body's already cracked that code.

30:07.000 --> 30:25.000
Your immune system already knows how to deal with with self replicating RNA, like a coronavirus, and it knows to focus on conserved epitopes and conserved antigenic domains, like those found on the receptor binding or sorry.

30:26.000 --> 30:38.000
Those found on the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, those found on the end protein, the nucleocapsid protein around which the mRNA or the RNA genome is supposed to be wrapped.

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
And other proteins, especially, I think the envelope protein because it's kind of vital for the formation of the coronavirus particles.

30:48.000 --> 31:06.000
Now, it's important because he starts out here again, just as he did on the previous episode from a week or so ago, plugging the discoveries that he made about HIV beyond the CD4 receptor.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
CD4 receptor being the helper T cell receptor that the AIDS virus supposedly uses to infect T cells.

31:13.000 --> 31:23.000
And he claims to have discovered another receptor, a co-receptor, or something else that works alongside of it, that's more important than CD4.

31:24.000 --> 31:45.000
He also claims to have made viral vaccine candidates and proposals which were rejected by the NIH, which he seems to oddly say he's only recently figured out is Fauci, which I've watched this video a couple times and it strikes me the same way every time.

31:46.000 --> 32:02.000
It feels weird. Anybody that was in the HIV field and making discoveries in the HIV field and publishing in HIV would have known that Tony Fauci was one of the grandfathers of the HIV field.

32:02.000 --> 32:22.000
And certainly anybody that's passed through America would have eventually had to pay fealty to Tony Fauci. And in fact, we know that the vast majority of the players who orchestrated the theater from 2020 and 2021 were people that cut their teeth in AIDS,

32:23.000 --> 32:43.000
redfield, Berks, Walensky, the Surgeon General Dude, they're all from HIV. They're all went through Brigham Young. They all went through some serious HIV clinical rotation of some kind or did their bench research in HIV.

32:44.000 --> 32:57.000
And this is not a coincidence. And it's not because everybody in viruses is doing HIV. It's something more complicated than that.

32:58.000 --> 33:08.000
So we started collaborating. We got very good grants from the Norwegian Research Council together for doing this. The vaccine is very good. It worked very well, but it wasn't as good as we'd like, but nothing is first time round.

33:08.000 --> 33:16.000
And I got involved in adapting it to make it even better. And one of the things was to add my Achilles heel to it.

33:17.000 --> 33:27.000
Their HIV vaccine was just based on the core and the nucleus was very conservative. So I've added my bit in and it works really beautifully. We've given it a booster with the IMM 101. So it's really perfect now.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
And it was going to go and be taken all the way up for registration.

33:31.000 --> 33:42.000
Now, this is frustrating because he said it again, just like he said it on the last stream. And just like John Campbell repeated it, he said he added his own little thing, which he's keeping secret.

33:42.000 --> 33:51.000
Apparently he has Achilles heel that he found. And their virus was focused on the nucleus on the core.

33:52.000 --> 34:00.000
And I don't like that language because I think it's technically almost certainly incorrect.

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
And so what he's doing here and see this as I see it.

34:07.000 --> 34:18.000
He's setting John Campbell up to be discredited, right? Because if John Campbell ever talks about the core of a virus or the nucleus of a virus.

34:18.000 --> 34:27.000
If anybody ever wants to make John Campbell look like a fool, like let's say debunk the funk, for example, he plays this clip.

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
And he says that this guy doesn't know what he's talking about. He's talking about the core of a virus or the nucleus of a virus. They don't have those.

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
So, you know, John Campbell doesn't know what he's talking about either because he listens to this guy and doesn't ask a question.

34:41.000 --> 34:58.000
This is going to happen more and more. You're going to see people like Brett Weinstein debunked in the exact same way where they will make almost obvious imprecise statements, almost obvious inversions.

34:59.000 --> 35:13.000
And now he's done it twice. This is the second time he did it on the stream. He didn't correct himself. He hasn't been become more precise. It's almost exactly the same wording, which concerns me a lot.

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
Now I know that you guys like him and I know you like John Campbell. So don't take this to heart. Don't get all worked up.

35:20.000 --> 35:29.000
I understand what it's like to be trapped inside the psychotic mind of a, of a, of a biologist in his back in the back of his garage.

35:29.000 --> 35:36.000
Because that's what I see here. I see people who aren't telling us a straight story, especially this fellow here.

35:36.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't know if John Campbell can tell the difference between a straight story and a real one. And if he can't, that would be a bit more in line with him just trusting the TV in 2020 and 2021.

35:52.000 --> 36:04.000
If he can actually smell BS, then it concerns me a little more that he was on narrative for so long. But if you really can't see through this guy makes kind of sense.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
But I know this guy knows more than what he's saying and I do not.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
I don't know. I don't. And you'll see.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
And one of the things was to add my, the Achilles heel to it.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
Their HIV vaccine was just based on the core and the nucleus was that's very concerned. So I've added my bit in and it works really beautifully.

36:24.000 --> 36:36.000
We've given it a booster with the IMM 101. So it's really perfect now. And it was going to go and be taken all the way up for registration by a company called Seljine with whom I've worked with for that work with them for over 20 years.

36:36.000 --> 36:45.000
When I said, you know, thalidomide is a drug which is magical, which is being tarred by the birth defects and, you know, going through that, they were going to pay for the whole thing to go through.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
So we've had an HIV vaccine, but unfortunately, Seljine was taken over by Bristol Myers Squibb, which is an enormous pharmaceutical company who just wanted their cancer agents.

36:52.000 --> 37:02.000
They took them over and threw every other project out, which was a tragedy. However, the bottom line of that was that we were working hard together, collaborating, making this vaccine, he already put into the clinic before I met him.

37:03.000 --> 37:11.000
And I realized the right way to go. I was suspicious of the technology at first, always own. And you always should be. Otherwise, you take everything for granted. You end up in the mess. We are now.

37:11.000 --> 37:20.000
So we worked really hard on this. I mean, you're exactly how to do it. And he'd worked with people who had tremendous algorithms mathematical for picking out sequences that are really important.

37:21.000 --> 37:32.000
And he was far, far above a spot above all the so-called molecular biologists who just look at sequences. Because he was a biophysicist, he realized that sequences mean nothing until you translate them into amino acids.

37:32.000 --> 37:40.000
And the amino acids mean nothing until you've built them like a Lego block into a 3D protein. And here they have their own laws. And that was the secret. That's where he was great at.

37:40.000 --> 37:47.000
So you could take the sequences and make it even stronger by making sure they're charged with all these things, which when I talk about the people, they might as well talk over their heads.

37:48.000 --> 37:58.000
And so when the COVID sequence came along, the burgers are in some of you as my big friend and colleague over there, he called me up and he said, Gus, there's going to be a real need for a vaccine.

37:58.000 --> 38:09.000
Shall we collaborate and go for one along the same lines? And I said, yeah, absolutely. Because I said, before we go any further, this virus has a big spike protein, rather like the HIV has a envelope.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
And we know the HIV envelope using it was a disaster. I would predict using the whole spike will be a disaster. So we need the pickler bits that are really important.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
So he said, great, I'll get working on those now with the algorithms.

38:19.000 --> 38:28.000
So one of the first things he did in his team was they did blast analysis, which means you take the sequence of all the proteins it could possibly make, and you look at the sequences.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
And the blast analysis showed that 79% of the spike protein had human homology.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
That meant if you use that 79% of the spike protein, there was going to be a very high chance you were going to induce autumn.

38:39.000 --> 38:49.000
Now this might be the Norwegian guy who wrote the article about warning that AstraZeneca might be a bad idea. I don't know.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
This would be curious.

38:53.000 --> 39:06.000
I didn't like his equivalents there, although I kind of liked his equivalents there in the sense of, you know, the spike protein and the envelope protein that I knew the envelope protein would work. So I knew the spike protein wouldn't work.

39:06.000 --> 39:14.000
So let's pick out the bits that are important. And 79% of this is overlapping. It shouldn't be very surprising.

39:14.000 --> 39:21.000
We have a lot of viral homology in our genome because viruses are derived from us.

39:21.000 --> 39:37.000
And we have this innate communication system using small vesicles and viruses if they exist as separate entities would use that existing communication system to their advantage.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.000
And if they are noise within that communication system, then obviously they are derived from it.

39:44.000 --> 40:04.000
And so there's still some sort of disconnect between the almost obvious biology at this stage and this illusion of pathogenic viruses that exist separately from us and waiting to pray upon us in nature.

40:04.000 --> 40:15.000
So here we are talking about vaccination again and we're not talking about whether a vaccine is necessary. We're not talking about the strength of natural immunity. We're not talking about previous immunity to previous RNA viruses.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
They use homologous proteins to do the same things.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
But instead, we're just talking about which vaccine was good and which mistakes did they make and I would have done it better.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
I had a better plan with my Norwegian friend.

40:31.000 --> 40:40.000
And so you can see coming from the TV, social media side of the Scooby-Doo, it's a very different elephant.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
New reactions against human epitopes. Can you just unpick them in what you mean by human homology?

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
Well, it means that the bits of the virus, which have a very similar sequence as a very important protein in the human.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
And we picked out the two had the strongest homology. One was played the factor four, which means the sequence is near identified.

40:57.000 --> 41:05.000
So by inducing antibodies against this, you would develop a clotting pathway and seriously, it would explain the VIIT, the thrombocytopenic condition.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
It would be absolutely exfoliant.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
This has now been accepted by the authorities as a side effect on the vaccine, albeit very rare and worth it in the long run type of approach.

41:12.000 --> 41:19.000
The other was myelin. Now, myelin is you get that attacked, you get transverse myelitis, givian virus and etc.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
So myelin is this insulating material around?

41:22.000 --> 41:31.000
Actually, you could also get, right? You could also get MS.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
I'm pretty sure that's what MS is.

41:34.000 --> 41:49.000
In fact, didn't I read in guns, germs and steel that the Russians once made a salmonella bacteria that express myelin protein on the outside?

41:49.000 --> 42:00.000
And if they put that salmonella bacteria in animals, they would develop a real acute MS.

42:00.000 --> 42:08.000
I'm pretty sure I read that in some book. Guns, germs and steel, something like that. I don't know. Anyway.

42:08.000 --> 42:29.000
So protein homology in the spike protein with myelin could cause a number of autoimmune consequences and any autoimmune consequences aimed at myelin would be a bad thing.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
And then platelet factor four.

42:34.000 --> 42:44.000
And so this is quite a bit different than, well, let's first say a couple things and then we'll let it go.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
What controls do we have here? None.

42:48.000 --> 43:01.000
So we haven't looked at the fusion proteins of other endemic human coronaviruses to see if they have homology on a similar scale.

43:01.000 --> 43:14.000
Maybe this is just a typical level of homology between a fusion protein of a human coronavirus and our own genome in this in this fragment size.

43:14.000 --> 43:27.000
We don't know because no one told us. If we were told that other coronaviruses have a spike protein that has almost no homology with our own, but this coronavirus has homology of like 70%.

43:27.000 --> 43:35.000
So it's super dangerous to use this spike protein. Hey, now you're telling me something.

43:35.000 --> 43:47.000
If you tell me 5,000 people died of COVID this week in America, but you don't tell me that we expected between 55 and 65,000 people to die this week.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
The numbers don't mean the same things.

43:51.000 --> 43:59.000
And so again, just keep putting salt in your mouth. Lots of grains of salt here because I'm not smelling fish.

44:00.000 --> 44:11.000
The virtually all nerve fibers. Yeah. And that again is exactly what we see. And it's not a brand new thing because the 1976 flu epidemic in America for Dietrich one that was killing young people, they rushed out a vaccine for it.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
And they were bright doctors and they weren't bullied and they reported back.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Gillian Barry syndrome seems to be much more common since we rolled out these 42 million vaccines.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
And they looked at this. They sent people out to check it and they found that it was much more common and they looked around and they said that no one's dying of the flu anymore.

44:28.000 --> 44:37.000
So they killed the vaccine program. That was Gillian Barry. It was because it wasn't a vaccine. It was a flu vaccine. So there's, there's a generic thing between the viruses and cross reactivity.

44:37.000 --> 44:46.000
Now we spotted that. So one of the questions I'd like to ask is why did the 150 other people designing vaccines all go with the whole spike protein and we shouted and we said, don't do it, don't do it.

44:46.000 --> 44:56.000
And because all the lemmings had all decided it was a good idea to jump with this type of protein. We were just ignored and off they go and every, every vaccine can take use of the whole spike protein one way or the other.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
And we had the experience and everything to do that. But we never had the funding properly because.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
I mean, think about what's happening here and I hope it's obvious to you what's happening here because it's certainly obvious to me.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
My parents, for example, I can just put myself in their shoes. They're not listening to their son.

45:13.000 --> 45:22.000
They think their son is an idiot. And maybe they finally found John Campbell and they're watching this and they're for the first time.

45:22.000 --> 45:31.000
Hearing someone describe the possibility that something like a spike protein in its relative size could have hundreds of epitopes.

45:31.000 --> 45:39.000
And many of those epitopes, if not almost all of them, will not neutralize the virus in like in the cartoons.

45:39.000 --> 45:50.000
And not all of those epitopes will necessarily help us to bring in the complement system or bring in macrophages or bring in antigen presenting cells to get rid of the viruses.

45:50.000 --> 45:59.000
It might not, it might not aggregate them because of the nature of off target antibodies.

46:00.000 --> 46:10.000
And the fact that we don't really use antibodies to fight off a respiratory disease in general, not seroprevalent IgG in the blood antibodies.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
None of that's being discussed right now.

46:13.000 --> 46:26.000
And so it's a very piecemeal display of skepticism. It's a piecemeal display of skepticism around the origins of the virus.

46:26.000 --> 46:37.000
And the target of the vaccine and the obviously dumb choice of using the whole spike protein as an antigen.

46:37.000 --> 46:48.000
And this is exactly what we said they were going to do actually almost three years ago now.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Almost three years ago.

46:52.000 --> 47:02.000
It's really October. It will be it is three years ago that we first stated they are going to blame.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
The injuries and deaths of the vaccine on the poor choice of antigen.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
And here we are in October of 2023.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
I guess that's two years later because it's 21 October of 2020.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Yeah. Wow. Holy cow.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
It is three years since I first got the idea that they were going to do that.

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
And it's not like it was my idea, but it just became obvious to me once I understood.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
Once I understood what Mike Eden was saying.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
And that expression of a foreign protein was going to lead to an autoimmune response.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Once I had heard.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
A secret Bakti say it.

47:53.000 --> 47:59.000
It became very obvious, right? It became very obvious that something was going to go wrong.

47:59.000 --> 48:04.000
But more importantly, it became obvious that they had to already know.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
And so they had to already have a plan of what they were going to do.

48:09.000 --> 48:19.000
And at that time, guess what the biggest, craziest, nuttiest uproar of was about.

48:19.000 --> 48:27.000
It was about the spike protein of the virus and about how the spike protein of the virus was revealing that it was actually a lab leak

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
and potentially much more dangerous to get infected with than we thought.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
It's not your everyday virus.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
That's what people were whispering behind the scenes.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
That's what everybody was afraid of.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
You don't want to get this thing, man.

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
Like this is not the way in natural immunity is not the way you don't want to get this at all.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
That's what Dan was saying. That's what Paul Cottrell was saying.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
That's what a lot of people were saying.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Because the spike protein could cause autoimmunity.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
The spike protein could cause amyloidosis.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
Spike protein could cause prion disease.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
Spike protein was neurotropic.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Spike protein caused clotting.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
And so this is the TV side of the narrative.

49:19.000 --> 49:27.000
This is the TV side of the narrative coming to the first time to understand what it means that it's a lab leak.

49:27.000 --> 49:35.000
Because they just thought that the lab leak, natural virus, it's equivalent because the lab leak came from a bad cave.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
And the natural leak is from a bad cave. So they're the same. Who cares?

49:39.000 --> 49:48.000
Who cares if it was a lab leak from a virus or a lab or a virus from a lab leak or a virus from a bad cave if they're both from a bad cave?

49:49.000 --> 49:58.000
But now they're being introduced to the part of the narrative, the villain part of the narrative that we've been aware of the whole time.

49:58.000 --> 50:10.000
That if it's a lab leak and it's got a fear and cleavage site and a bunch of AIDS inserts, it could be much worse than anything Mother Nature could have ever made.

50:10.000 --> 50:21.000
Look, Montagnier referred to this as a watchmaker's creation meticulously assembled.

50:21.000 --> 50:39.000
And so all you normies out there who believe the TV have grossly underestimated the danger of this virus because lab leak and natural are not the same as like Tony Fauci would like you to believe they are.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
Why didn't that do? I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
And that's really the trick here. That's what you see here.

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
Remember, this is the TV and social media narrative side of the Scooby-Doo coming in for a landing.

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
This is the first time they're getting this notion dropped into their lap.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
That lab leak or natural virus is not the same thing.

51:07.000 --> 51:21.000
They have been sitting on their couch with their feet up watching Netflix under the false assumption that lab leak or natural viruses the same because they both came from a bad cave.

51:21.000 --> 51:37.000
Who gives a dart? Whether it was somebody at a market or somebody who didn't shower after they got out of the PSL four lab or someone who was climbing around in a cave for fertilizer and brought it back on a train.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's all the same.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
Now they're being told the truth.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
No use silly billies.

51:46.000 --> 51:57.000
No use silly billies. It's much worse than that because this is a gain of function virus with lots of things added to it.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
People like without using gates are refused to fund us.

52:00.000 --> 52:09.000
So if 79% of the spike protein is the same as human proteins and you make antibodies to that spike protein, that means to me that 79% of those antibodies are going to cross react with human.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
But some of them will be weak and inconsequential.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
Some of them will be the medium and cause all sorts of funny things. You wonder what's going on like skin reactions and things.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
It's been very common. The whole range of weird wonderful reactions would be due to that.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
But the one where the homology is very strong, you're going to induce these conditions.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
And one of the things is they always trump.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Oh, but these side effects are very rare.

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
See, but what's what's deceptive about this is that how do we tell you really.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
The prediction that he's making has a very finite.

52:42.000 --> 52:50.000
Range of possibilities because he has described the homology to human proteins.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
And he's suggesting that that homology is the source of the autoimmunity.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
That that homology is the source of the clotting.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
That that homology may be the source of some of the, the, the neurobiological effects.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Maybe long COVID.

53:10.000 --> 53:18.000
Now, the one problem with this is that the spike protein is a limited set of epitopes. It's a limited antigen set.

53:19.000 --> 53:33.000
And so if there's nothing there to create autoimmunity to your ovaries or autoimmunity to your testes or autoimmunity to your liver, then it shouldn't show up.

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
If there's nothing to explain autoimmunity in the skin, then it shouldn't show up.

53:39.000 --> 53:52.000
Unless you transfect cells with a foreign protein and the autoimmunity is generated by the general immune response to that self tissue that's expressing the non-self protein.

53:53.000 --> 54:08.000
And what I see here is a very convenient narrative about a spike protein with lots of mimicry and overlapping epitopes with our own epitopes that's leading to autoimmunity that is actually

54:08.000 --> 54:19.000
describing away the main mechanism of autoimmunity in transfection, which is transfection itself, which is exactly what I said they were going to do.

54:20.000 --> 54:28.000
I said this exact thing for the last three years, that people were going to keep coming on the scene and retelling us the tail.

54:29.000 --> 54:37.000
And every time they tell us the tail, there's going to be a new biological explanation for why the transfection caused all the things that it caused.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
But they're never just going to say that because transfection causes those things.

54:43.000 --> 55:06.000
They're going to try and blame it on the spike protein, on the LNP, on the DNA, on the purity of the DNA, the RNA, whatever, whatever, whatever, in the best case scenario with the purest RNA and the cleanest lipid nanoparticles, the best intramuscular injection, and the optimal health of your patient.

55:07.000 --> 55:19.000
Because transfection is still not a way of augmenting the immune system, we have no reason to believe it is, it's just a bunch of lipids and RNA.

55:24.000 --> 55:32.000
It's an intramuscular injection of a combination of substances intended to augment your immune system, and as we've said, that's dumb.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
We induce these conditions. And one of the things is they always trumpet, oh, but these side effects are very rare, and in the end they're worth it.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Well, if you tell that somebody's paralyzed, that they didn't get COVID again, because it's worth it.

55:45.000 --> 55:52.000
To me, that was just ridiculously unacceptable when we were warned about it, and they haven't stopped the program knowing that the incidence is on the MHRA website about Gilean Bari.

55:53.000 --> 56:01.000
I mean, so that is not acceptable in young people who are, and they're often the ones that get it, they're the worst because they've got the strongest immune response to do something, who've got zero chance of dying of any of these variants.

56:02.000 --> 56:12.000
All these variants coming along. There's no evidence at all that they're ever going to be worse than the initial virus, which is why we're here to talk, because it was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells.

56:13.000 --> 56:22.000
Supremely adaptive at infecting and destroying human cells. It was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
If we were in a church, you would repeat that after me.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Right from the beginning, because it had spent years being manipulated in the laboratory in order to do so.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
It had been spent years in a laboratory being manipulated to do so.

56:42.000 --> 56:50.000
Listen to the faith, who are, and they're often the ones that get it, they're the worst because they've got the strongest immune response to do something, who've got zero chance of dying of any of these variants.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
All these variants coming along. There's no evidence at all that they're ever going to be worse than the initial virus, which is why, you know, we're here to talk.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
Because it was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells. Right.

57:03.000 --> 57:23.000
The original virus was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells. And then what's he saying right after that?

57:23.000 --> 57:30.000
In the beginning, because it had spent years being manipulated in the laboratory in order to do so.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Of course, I'm probably pronouncing it wrong. I've always said Guillaume-Barry.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
My French is always applauding.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
My French is nonexistent, so yours is clearly better than mine. But it can be a devastating disease.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
I've looked after patients for months on intensive care with hypoventilation, paralysis.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
And again, transverse myelitis. Transverse means it goes across the spinal cord.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
And again, I've seen people with total paralysis below that level of delusion, just like in a spinal cord injury.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
These can be quite devastating diseases.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Now, one of the things I think that you noticed early on was what you call viral inserts.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
What did you mean by viral inserts?

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Right. Well, this goes back to my friend, Berber Sorensen, who we are selecting.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
Having decided that 80% of the spike protein should be avoided at all costs.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
Well, putting that into what amino acids are going to be programmed by these sequences.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
So these are the sequences in the letters of the RNA of the virus?

58:25.000 --> 58:33.000
Yes. And we found that when you did that into the amino acids, there were regimens where you had amino acids which had a positive charge.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
Say four of them together. Now, this never happens normally because of the equilibrium cozine.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
There's a higher level of editing. So you have four amino acids positive.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
The other thing will show that you're going to have two positive, two negative.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Right. Three to one is the most extreme, not four.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Not four.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
And it was Berber, who's, I mean, I think he was a genius of being involved in vaccine design as a biophysicist.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
He said there are amino acid runs here, which shouldn't be here.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
And I discussed them with my colleagues and they said, oh, no, it's all random mutations.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
It doesn't mean anything.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
But then we looked that they were all around the receptor binding site.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And they were all heavily positively charged.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
Now, I know great biophysicists, but I could see what this meant very quickly.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
And we looked at the positive charge of the membrane compared to any other coronavirus or similar virus.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
It's unbelievably high.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
So this receptor binding domain is the very bit of a spike protein that fits in soon.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
Yes. Now, if you accept us, my analogy, the way I saw it, and I think it's a good way to explain it,

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
is the cell membrane for a virus is rather like the fridge door.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
So if you hypercharged it up, it's like a magnet. It goes bang and it locks in.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
And it locks in.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
That is why it's so supremely adapted to infecting human cells via the ACE receptor.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
In fact, it's so good. It's even learned to use other receptors.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And that was the other thing that came through from that.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
So Virgo spotted it with his team who analyzed all the sequences.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
He spotted that these were positive charge.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
I went in having spent, you know, I discovered the receptor in 1984.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So even though I was a clinical oncologist, I kept my interest in HIV all along.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And couldn't understand why so many top class scientists went down so many rabbit holes for years on it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I found the most alarming insight that nobody was as clever as I thought we were.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We know when I started this, but I knew the receptor that I was involved in discovering the CD4.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
One of the first things insights I had was, it's not enough.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
There's something else required, something else required.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And we predicted very accurately that it was something else required, but it wasn't discovered for another 10 years.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
This is the HIV transition we're talking about.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
After I was wondering around the wards, being a cancer doctor.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And so because of all that insight, I was very well primed to understand what he was doing and realized he was completely right.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And all the people who shouted from the sidelines saying this is all nonsense erosion.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
In other words, I went and looked at papers and read papers.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And there was a very important paper came out about this time.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And it was called on the proximal evidence.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It was by a fellow called Christian Anderson who wrote this paper with five or six other top virologists.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And it said there's no chance it could have escaped from that.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That was their constant thing.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And I thought that was.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But that's pretty funny, right?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
To bring up the proximal origins paper now that like we all aren't aware of that one.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I wonder how long he's going to talk about that.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Did I put this faster yet?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It doesn't feel faster.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Okay, it is.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
After what I've done with Burger, I thought it was absolutely rubbishly.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And if you don't agree, you're a conspiracy theorist.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
You don't agree, you're a conspiracy theorist.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So anyway, I read this paper.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And unlike I would say the vast majority of people, I actually read their references.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You always cloud a load of references on the paper superficially as a decoy to make other people think you know what you're talking about.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You've read everything, but in actual practice, most of the people who put their names to these things have not read them.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So I took it upon myself to read them.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And it was beyond belief that they quoted these papers as references because two or three of them were really cool.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But they were references to that viruses, which have been genetically engineered in Google, perhaps, for a gain of function or to translate to make them more infectious to human cells.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And they described perfectly how they done it.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
They had to also show that that they did.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:20.000
In case you're unaware, you can still go to this channel here, J.C. on a bike, and you can still see.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:33.000
The proximal origin paper to these viruses, which is pretty cool.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Hey, this is J.C. on a bike.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Thanks for joining me on this ride.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I'm going to talk about the new nature medicine paper, the proximal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And I'm also going to mention this other nature paper, which recently came out by one of those same authors showing the various recently discovered.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Coronavirus variants that are found in pangolins, specifically pangolins that were sort of stopped by customs in China in 2017, 18, and 19.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So very interesting data. Join me on the bike.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So the point is that this never got taken down from YouTube, even though I talk all about how they're full of crap.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Why wouldn't it get taken down from YouTube?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Because it's part of the Scooby-Doo.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's right on narrative. That's why it didn't get taken down.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I don't challenge anything in this that they didn't want me to challenge.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I don't figure out anything in this that they don't want everybody to figure out.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And this guy isn't helping us figure out anything that they don't want us to already want to figure out.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:56.000
This is part of the Scooby-Doo. And either he is completely taken or he is completely taking John Campbell.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I encourage them to get even better at this by passaging them.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
That means putting them through all different types of human cells so they take and they adapt to and they get more infectious.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
They also virologists are rather amusingly call this polishing.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
You polish the virus so it becomes even more adaptable to the cell that it seems.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I wish they wouldn't bother.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So this is like a natural evolution, but it's accelerated.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's accelerated evolution dramatically.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So when I looked at these papers, I thought, this insert they just put in and they published.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It's exactly the same one that said the cells do.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
They're using this as evidence that didn't come from the map.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So the same insert that the genetic instruction, the letters, the RNA letters in the Wuhan publication were the same as the ones that turned up in the virus.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And strangely, I believe the Wuhan database went.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That's not real.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
That's not right.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
That's crazy.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Listen to this carefully.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
That is not right.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Papers.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I thought this insert they just put in and they published.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's exactly the same one that said the cells do.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
They're using this as evidence that didn't come from the map.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So the same insert.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
No, what they did was they moved a receptor binding domain from one virus to another.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And maybe they even moved a spike from one virus to another.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000
They made a chimera, but they didn't take the exact insert and put it in this virus.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That's wrong.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And so again, here's another one of these.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Anybody that wants to like that, that lady with the little dog with the really annoying voice that likes to debunk biology can look at John Campbell and say to John Campbell and this other guy don't know what they're talking about.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And debunk the funk and do the same thing here.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because this is wrong.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But it's not what they did. They made a chimeric virus and it was actually, they did it on pseudoviruses too.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And so it's the same mistake that everybody makes is that they don't actually do what they have led you to believe that they did.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:20.000
They have not created pandemic potential in the laboratory by making infectious clones of a chimeric RNA sequence.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
They haven't.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And these guys are John Campbell is being fooled by this guy and it's terrible.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's terrible.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The genetic instruction, the letters, the RNA letters in the Wuhan publication with the same as the ones that turned up in the virus.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And strangely, I believe the Wuhan database went offline. I believe it was September 2019.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes, it did. And that's a very important date this September, because just from my personal view and interest in getting interested in COVID, I was able to identify two families who clearly went down with COVID in November.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
So what are we getting out here now spread.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
There was absolutely spread because they brought it from Hong Kong.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Could have brought a clone clones would spread.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I do think clones would spread for a few people. If you got the clone, you can make your your family get sick.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
So what are we getting out here now spread.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
There was absolutely spread because they brought it from Hong Kong.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Could have brought a clone clones would spread.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I do think clones would spread for a few people. If you got the clone, you can make your your family get sick.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's possible.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You have more chance of shedding infectious RNA than somebody who gets an actual coronavirus. That's for damn sure.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And more likely to shed a consistent sequence.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's all clones. The only thing that could do this is clones and they know that.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And this guy's covering it up. That's what I think I'm just going to be real pessimistic and honest.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I don't I think he's fooling. He's fooling John Campbell to make sure that John Campbell doesn't go all the way to figuring out that Mike Eden was right and it's just a bunch of lies.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000
He doesn't want him ever to get that far. So, you know, he gives him a lot of good biology. He gives him a lot of good cancer data.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Now he comes on for a second time and takes the Scooby-Doo and dunks it.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Closely connected to London and Birmingham here. You've always got to be back and forth.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
In the November 2019 in the UK.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And the thing about the the importance of September was they were they were very suspicious about something going on.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
That's why they took it down. It was also interesting that that viruses that they were working on,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
which had clearly been harvested from a mine that thousand miles away.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It's like North Thailand area, wasn't it?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And they brought them back and they sequenced all sorts of things that they started working on.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
They didn't register them in the databases until all this stuff started.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Now, that's extremely unusual to do this very late registration for viruses that have been there you've been working with.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
That not only made us very suspicious, but also other people suspicious who started to wonder what's going on.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And the whole details of these sequences, the evolution history,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
has actually been very well documented by Matt Ridley and his collegely Shannon there.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But while they go into that part of the evidence, Matt Ridley and his collegely Shannon there.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But while there's actually been very well documented by Matt Ridley and his collegely Shannon there.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
But while they go.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Did he say Alina Chan? I don't think he said that he said at least something or other,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
but it's Alina Chan that wrote the book with Matt Ridley, right?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Into that part of the evidence extremely well, which I believe is very very complimentary to the way we did it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And then after with the paper, I mentioned about this person Anderson one,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
that one that we then found that Fauci had a commissioned.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
They were a bit suspicious about being so black and white about it.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
But once he had that paper published in nature medicine, which was submitted and published in five days,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
something which never happened in a peer reviewed journal ever.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And, you know, as soon as it was out, Fauci was waving it around Congress, NIH, here's the proof.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And this became a very everybody was sort of proof.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And anybody who said anything else was a conspiracy theory.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Well, it's got to be true because it's in nature.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
At until you've chosen it.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So I pointed out with my colleagues, like this paper was the most flawed.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
In fact, I actually said it's the worst scientific paper I've ever come across in my life,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
because normally you have to search hard to find out that the references don't support the ludicrous statements.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So this was glaring in the, that even I could pick it up quickly.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That's wrong.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And they turned it down and said, we've got nothing against your science,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
but it's not in the public interest for us to report this.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That's what nature told you.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
That's what they told me.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
We did the same to science, general virology, landscape.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
They all said exactly the same thing.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And sometimes we were rejected within five hours, because you can do electronic submission.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Well, he's got to know that the journals have got the public interest at heart professor, isn't it?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
This is just unbelievable censorship.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And it's a public interest to think about the truth out there.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It's the only situation I can come to.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And so if they're prepared to do that with something as obvious as the original virus,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
what are they prepared to do with everything else?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The social implications, the non-pharmaceutical interventions, drug treatments, vaccines,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I think they basically are clearly to let us.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
That's what that's like.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Well, then you just almost got there though, see?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
If they're willing to lie about the origin, what else are they willing to lie about?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
He's so close.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
He's so close.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
All he has to realize is that they might lie about the virus itself.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:27.000
So the combination of tests, fear, uncertainty, doubt, bad protocols.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Rinse and repeat.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
There's been an equation I can come to.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And so if they're prepared to do that with something as obvious as the original virus,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
what are they prepared to do with everything else, the social implications,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
the non-pharmaceutical interventions, drug treatments, vaccines,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I think they basically are clearly to let us.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That's what that's my take.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
You know, we can say.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Okay.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So now all he has to do is come to the realization that he is still apportioning blame

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and cause and effect incorrectly.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And that he's still attributing too much to the virus.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
But he believes that some people brought the virus from Hong Kong.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So obviously there's a virus he believes in the variants,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
even though they're not as dangerous as the first one,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
because the first one was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And then it's been here as being manipulated in a laboratory to do so.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's possible that people on this side of the narrative are only going to be

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
get this far without our help.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
That's the design.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
This is supposed to feel like an extremely comfortable landing to these people.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So don't underestimate.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It doesn't have to be that he was chosen to carry it.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
This is where we want him to go.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
This is where everybody that's influencing him,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
everybody that's influencing John Campbell,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
wants him to go right here.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000
This is the sweet spot where we're not really talking about what percentage

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Professor DeGlish would you attribute to all cause mortality?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
What percentage would you attribute to the protocols versus the virus?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
He's not at the point where we are, where we see the

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Iatrogenic murder for what it is.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
He sees that as a complication.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
He sees it probably there,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
but he would really need to be convinced by somebody like Denny

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
that the all cause mortality does not reveal a novel,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000
new cause of death on top of all the other ways that people were dying before this.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And he is convinced that there is a new cause of death.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
A new cause of death that was supremely adapted to infecting

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
and destroying human cells upon release years after being years

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
manipulated in a laboratory to do so.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
We've got a lot of work to do, ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
because this is the landing bay.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
This is where they're landing and we've got to catch them now

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
before they pad themselves on the back too much and walk off into the sunset

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
and get a drink together.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Confused.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Well, you don't sound confused to me,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and if we can't rely on the medical journals,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I mean, you know, as someone who's, I mean, I taught evidence-based practice

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
since it first came out in the 1990s with David Sackett teaching.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You know, to take away this fundamental axiom of evidence-based medicine,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
which is the best available evidence, then we stand on fresh air.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
We stand on nothing.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But they even took away the ability to debate it.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Yeah.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's all about debate.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It's not about sensory.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And that's why, I mean, I've recently sent a book with colleagues

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
to the press called The Death of Silence.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Yeah.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And it was brought to that.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Because I started writing about the, you know,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
clearly a nonsense and logicality of lockdown.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And a friend saw me doing that.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I said, what do you think? How should we do it?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
He said, I've got a lot to learn.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
The next thing we knew, anyway, we were editors.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
We were not authors anymore.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I can't wait to get a copy. When's this out?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's going to come out very shortly. It's in the printers now.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Probably in November.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And if you'd like to come on and talk about it,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
we would like to hear about it.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And it was because, you know, when I was writing about lockdown,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I said, evidence is all here, but they take no notice of it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
This really is The Death of Silence.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And my friend said, that's a brilliant title.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
We're going to use this.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And I'm going to expand it with you.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Well, it's brilliant.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
One word I would say tragic or devastating is another word.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Now, there doesn't seem to be any naturally occurring

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Saskarone virus to that's ever been found in animal reservoirs

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
or human reservoirs or before the pandemic.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Was there any immunological evidence of these, of such a virus?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Do you think that is relevant?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Well, you've touched on something.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's not exactly what you asked me,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
but it actually helps explain very, very well what's going on here.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
When we had MERS, and we had the first...

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
That's not true, though, because we had seroprevalence in blood samples.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
We looked at this in...

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
God dang it.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
We looked at this...

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm going to get this open.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I'm so upset that he's saying this.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
This is not right.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
We looked at this.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's part of an immunology talk I gave many years ago already.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
He's wrong.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
We looked before the pandemic.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Or is this paper?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And there are healthy donors that have the same...

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
The same look.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I mean, this is here it is.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
This is really it.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
If I just... This is just one paper.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
This is healthy donors pre-COVID.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
This is healthy donors, health care staff pre-COVID.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
They have ORF1A.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
They have S.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
They have N.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's not nothing.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
They have T cells.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
They have T cells that overlap with this virus on many epitopes.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And it's not this one paper.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It's hundreds.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Well, maybe tens.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So it's a very strange thing to say when there are papers in highest journals

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
which have shown overlapping T cell memory that existed before the pandemic

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
from around the world and seroprevalence studies.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Saskarone virus too.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That's ever been found in animal reservoirs or human reservoirs.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Or before the pandemic, was there any immunological evidence of the...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
...of seroprevalence?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Do you think that is relevant?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Well, you've touched on something.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's not exactly what you asked me,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
but it actually helps explain very, very well what's going on here.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
But when we had MERS, we had the first...

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It's 2001.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
In 2003.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And then we had the SARS one.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Oh, yeah.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Sorry, yeah.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And anyway, one had camel and the other was back to civic and things.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But the MERS was camels and the SARS was a civic.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Now, when you had those viruses on the test,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
you could go back to the area they were found in

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and you could do serological analysis of everybody being into hospital

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and they had a blood test.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And you could show they were traces there for months in the community

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
while said virus jumped back and forth from back to civic,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
so it's a human or the camel that comes up to it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And it was doing the polishing.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It was getting good enough to get infected to build up a viral load

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
whereas, from the first time, the disease become evidence.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Now, that you can find for months.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
In SARS two, they couldn't find a single serological imprint around...

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
...even around Wuhan or anything.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
They could find absolutely nothing.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Which meant it had not escaped naturally.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It had gone out there, full bore, able to infect and cause high viral loads

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
in the first people that went out and hit.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And the other thing is, in previous outbreaks...

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You know, it caused high viral loads and the first people that it hit

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
is a transfection agent encoding a coronavirus genome.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
A transfection agent encoding a coronavirus spike protein.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:53.000
A transfection agent encoding a coronavirus genome, a coronavirus clone...

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
...would definitely cause high viral loads.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
A well-developed high-fidelity molecular signature...

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000
...with a high probability of giving you the sequence that you wanted to find...

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
...that you wanted to include in your vaccine.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
It had all the inserts in it.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You see, you can't have it both ways.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
If this was a genuine coronavirus consensus sequence...

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
...the sequences would not have had all of these inserts in it, and it wouldn't have been so obvious.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
If it would have been a natural sequence, it would have been a consensus sequence...

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
...not the sequence generated from a clone.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Therefore, the odds of this actual sequence having been found in multiple places around the world is zero.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
It's zero.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The only way that can happen is through a clone.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And what that got them was their protein in the virus...

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
...that they wanted to use for their transfection because they knew that their protein would cause a robust...

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
...repeatable, redosable, antibody response.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And that's all they cared about because they knew they could make the pandemic.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The pandemic was a lie.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
What they needed to also be able to do was make it seem as though...

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
...the RNA saved people.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And if there wasn't a clear clinical signal to point to...

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000
...if there wasn't a clear seroprevalence to point to that they could call immunity...

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
...then they wouldn't be able to tell the story that they're telling now...

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
...which between 14 and 19 million people were saved by it.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
These guys are confused by the same thing that we were confused...

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
...but they're coming at it from the TV and social media side...

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
...as far away from the truth as you could be.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
That's why it's difficult to watch.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That's why it's frustrating to watch.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
That's why it seems like I'm so critical.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But this is what's necessary.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
We've been able to find multiple outbreaks at multiple times.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So if the virus becomes endemic in a human or an animal population...

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
...then the animals could spread out over 10 miles, 100 miles, 700 miles.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
The bizarinotic transfer here, then the bizarinotic transfer in Carl Ireland...

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
...zarinotic transfer in London and zarinotic transfer in Johnny Groats...

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
...and we would get different outbreaks at different times.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
We didn't see that sort of single outbreak.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Is that significant as well?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I think it's highly significant.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
They may well have been two or three seedings in different populations...

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
...for slightly different takes.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But they all at the same time, they all came from the same laboratory specimen.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And they found some of the first people to get infected with people actually involved.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
If the same laboratory specimen or what would a laboratory specimen be a clone...

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
...there is only one kind of laboratory specimen...

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
...that exists in sufficient purity and sufficient quantity...

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
...to cause a lab leak with a significant...

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
...and high enough fidelity signal like this...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
...and that would be an infectious clone.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Laboratory sample is an infectious clone.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Olden mixing the suits of these viruses.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And the other thing I could not understand is when we pointed out...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
...it has to be a lab leak.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Whereas the fact that no of these labs are tubular...

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
...they can't possibly escape.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
When we could find six reports of the standard literature...

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
...six detailed reports of the SARS virus having escaped from laboratories...

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
...one in Taiwan, one in Singapore, four from China.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
This is the original SARS-2000.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
There are more reports of audio on a sink besides family.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And the other thing that was very clear from a previous inspection of Wuhan...

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
...was the level of security.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
It was very poor for a laboratory specimen.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So, it meant that escape was inevitable in my book.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So, why should they call such a fuss about it couldn't possibly escape?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And anything to say, well, I'm a great believer in the...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
...I called it the...

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
...the first Douglas Law of Universal Human Incompetence.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I subscribe to that one as well.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Human incompetence is far more likely than any sort of...

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
...inline intent.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
It may be behind it, but usually what you end up dealing with...

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
...is a piece of human incompetence.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It was a way with the mouth outbreak, too.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
So, the three options for the viral origin are natural zoonotic...

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
...accidental lab leak or deliberate lab leak.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I think I'm with you, accidental lab leak.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So, that's where I came from.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
That this was a lab leak.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And the problem was they tried to cover it up.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Yeah.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Instead of coming clean.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And here is something really, really nasty and sinister.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
They actually got the WHO into going along with them trying to cover it up.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
If the WHO had been under the previous ages of the...

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
...the previous head whose name just escapes me...

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
...who was not under the control of the child.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
The, like, Tetris was...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
...and who should never be dead at WHO.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
He wasn't even a medic.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
He was over there for political reasons.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
He did what he was told.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Shut up, didn't do it.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Had they done their job, this would never have escaped to the rest of the world.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm talking to lots of people involved in these things.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I completely believe that.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
It would have been contained in Wuhan area, Kubei area.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And it would never have gone outside China.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So, flights from China, the WHO at the time specifically said...

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
...we should carry on flying in and out of China.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Even at that time I was bemused.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
That was madness.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But the real sinister thing here is that the WHO said...

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
...in order to handle this better next time, we need all the powers assigned to us.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That is, I would rather sign a suicide pact.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I know UK.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Well, never let a good crisis go to a waste professor.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Well, hopefully we've got to May next year to come to our census.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
But I don't hold out much properly.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
People who seem to run and advise these things seem to be the most inappropriate people.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And the government seems to be so poorly educated.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And so intellectually lazy.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
They go along with all this.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Yep.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And we have done several videos on that.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
People like James Riggoski, who has done absolutely stirling work on that.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Now, I keep getting questions on this.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I've never fully understood it.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
How similar, how homologous...

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
...are SARS coronavirus 2 sequences with the HIV virus?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
With the...

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
...which virus?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
...the human immunodeficiency virus.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Oh, sorry.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
HIV virus.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Yeah.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Yeah.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I got told off one.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
A viologist told me off.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
He says, I said the HIV virus.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
He said, how can you have the HIV virus virus?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
So, since then, I've always tried to say HIV virus.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I always...

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I've always just say HIV.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
There's very, very little homology.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
But there is a tiny little bit of homology.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And this little homology is real.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
But I think we've discovered why it's there.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
When I mentioned about how they get their back viruses,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
and they train them to infect human receptors,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
they put the human ACE receptor into a cell,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
a neutral cell, with an HIV lentivirus.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So, the virus takes some receptor in,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
gets integrated up, and then it gets expressed on the cell

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
that would never normally present it.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Those little HIV sequences...

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
...but it was an HIV lentivirus.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So, when you look at the sequences, you're picking up

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
the sequences from the vector.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
The ACE receptor was introduced to the cell with.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The viruses picked them up.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So, the homology is really...

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
There's nothing to do.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
There's no link with the two.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
But...

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
...but...

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
...those sequences to be absolutely confirmed.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But it was not only genetically engineered,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
but it was heavily passaged through that.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And that's because of that passage,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
it's picked up those HIV sequences.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
But that's purely all it is.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
There's no big homology with the two.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Right.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Good.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Now, the last question is...

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I've only ever...

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So, he says that the HIV homology is coming from

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
repeated passage in cells

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
in which they are expressing the ACE2 receptor using...

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
...using HIV retroviruses...

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
...or pseudoviruses of HIV.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So, that's a technique that I don't...

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
...I can't come up with a paper that uses...

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
...sudo-virus...

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
...HIV pseudoviruses to...

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
...express ACE2 in cells...

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
...has a model of viral infection.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I don't... I can't think of one off the top of my head.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I don't think he's right about that.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I think that might be another mistake.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'm really sorry that the...

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
...that the audio keeps going out of sync.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
It could be that my hard drive is just getting full.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And so, I need to do something about that.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's hard for me to believe that's the case.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I think it's more likely that...

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
...I don't know. I have something set up wrong.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I think...

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
...maybe I'll just leave it go.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
We'll get done.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
But partly understood this.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
There's a furin cleavage site on the spike protein of the virus.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And furin is a protein on the surface of human cells.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Now, this furin cleavage site...

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
...I kind of think of it as kicking over...

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
...kicking open these furin doors...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
...to allow the virus into the cell so it can reproduce.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So, is that kind of vaguely right?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And what is the significance of finding the furin cleavage site on the spike protein?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
The significance of furin cleavage site...

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
...is the spike protein of the SARS and MERS virus group...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
...because it's never been there any of these viruses whatsoever.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
So, just to clarify that, sorry, the MERS and the SARS-Coronavirus-1...

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
...don't have a furin cleavage site.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
No, no, no, no.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But any... within that phylogeny of the coronaviruses...

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
...from which these...

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I'm pretty sure MERS does, doesn't it?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I think it does, but I could be wrong.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It's alright, whatever.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
So, SARS-Coronavirus-2 is the only coronavirus that we know of...

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
...with a furin cleavage site?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Of the sort that can infect man?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Yes.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
There are some animal coronaviruses...

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
...and my virus, your friends, keep proudly telling me...

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
...do have furin cleavage sites, but they don't infect us.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
This is the only one that does.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Now, the furin cleavage site was put into these bat sounds by people...

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
...in the way they found that, because they boasted about it that they did it.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
These same people, when they presented the sequence of the virus in nature...

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
...the furin cleavage site is screaming and playing sight.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
They discuss everything else about the sequence...

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
...but they don't discuss the furin cleavage site.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
They probably forgot.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Oh, that's a very kinder.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
They put it in there.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Good, yeah.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
No.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And what a furin cleavage site does is basically...

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
...if you have the virus getting onto the cell, you can lock on pretty tight...

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
...but you have to work pretty hard to get through the cell membrane.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
But a furin cleavage site is like giving the virus an extra pair of scissors...

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
...so I can just spit through and get into that very, very quickly.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That never occurs in this type of virus.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It was put there in the Wuhan lab...

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
...and it was like magic.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
You don't see it there, but you had to look very carefully...

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
...and my colleagues picked it up and pointed it out.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And they found that other people had pointed it out...

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
...they had bought it more almost a famous virus.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It's very hard.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
They called it the smoking gun.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
This David Baltimore saw the furin cleavage site.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I didn't know that.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
That's a nice little tidbit we get out of this.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
David Baltimore.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Wow.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's a regular home run there.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
This went as far as the Washington Post, and it was all dismissed.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
There was nonsense of no importance.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And then another load of virologists came up and said,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
well, some viruses had this, which is true.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But not the sort of viruses we're dealing with.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It's like saying some animals have trumps, if humans don't.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Exactly.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And then the other thing about this, they tried so hard to say...

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
...to go against our discussions here, which other people joined slowly.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
They said, oh, but we found this virus as present in a raccoon.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And so it came from the raccoon.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So they looked around all the raccoons.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
No, this is the only one. It could be a false positive.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And you get papers coming.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
There was a paper from, say, a city in Scotland...

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
...which tried desperately hard to open up the narrative.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It was a natural jump, apparently.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
And by this time, I don't have to do my science.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I just looked at their funding.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
China.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It's ridiculous.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
They might have to go to the river.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
The first scientific analysis is these days.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Who the heck paid for this?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Who is funding?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And unfortunately, it's even more important when you get into treatments of vaccines.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yeah.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I don't want to get into that now.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
But the reason I'm so concerned about the virologians is,

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
is it possible that humans could be jiggery-pokering around with a virus,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
which is as transmissible as, say,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
these also are an omicron virus, but as deadly as, say,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
in a bowl of virus, it's such a thing possible.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Yes, it is.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And this is all called the gain of function.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And this is under the Obama administration they banned.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
The scientists and I've got a colleague I know myself.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Basically, he calls all virology gain of function in the desperate attempt to try and preserve it.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
No, it is...

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I mean, the sort of thing that was being done was absolutely mad.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
It was basically...

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
It was inevitable that a pandemic would arise out of this nonsense.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Obama and people banned it, but they tried to go to an exception.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And who was the person who tried to get the exception?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And that was Anthony Fauci in order to have things in case something dreadful came along.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Very exceptional cases.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Well, he wasn't allowed to do it in his own place.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So he funded this work to be done in Wuhan via the eco-health alliance,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
via a person called Peter Doze, who is very, very friendly with back woman,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
who's lab did this very manipulation that led to it coming out, to escaping.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
So Wayne Fauci went to these extreme lengths to deny this.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I immediately knew he was covering his backside over this,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
but he realized he was in trouble.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So whereas, initially, I blamed the Chinese for which I was called by some people,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
a racist.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I don't know how...

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
When you actually point out that something comes from somewhere, you're a racist with one thing of that.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
But when I trace everything back, if somebody has to take the rack for this,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
it has to be Fauci.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
To me, he is the one single person guilty.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
He's just used his excessive outrageous power.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And I'm a lot of watchers to...

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I have no responsibility...

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I have no responsibility...

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
...to have the current pandemic.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
...because it'd be Kirsten Anderson, who wrote...

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
That ludicrous paper for him, that he got the narrow nature.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Immediately got an nearly $9 million grant to carry on his work in his institute,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
which did not go out to peer review in all the normal sentences, according to my sources.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And I'll just have another bizarre temporal correlation, isn't it?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And the same happened with Dazep.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
The same happened with Dazep.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
They wrote a letter to the Lancet saying,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
this is absolutely ludicrous.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Anything that suggests it came out of China land is...

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
We use the word it was racist and demean it.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
God, everything else, 26 people signed it.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
No conflict of interest.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
The sector declared 25 or 26 of those people were all funded directly or indirectly by that charity.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And they now, a lot of them have come out and they want to withdraw it.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
They realise they've been...

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Why that paper has not been withdrawn, I have no idea.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
If you told me it had been withdrawn, I would have expected it.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
But the fact it's still not.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's still arguably amongst themselves.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Unbelievable.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So, is existential means existence?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Is a future lovely, potentially an existential threat to humanity?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Yes, I think it is.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And I think all this work should be stopped wherever anybody says.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Because it really does get rather circular all this.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
They say we have to do this.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So we have the tools and understanding to make drugs and vaccines for the next pandemic,

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
which will surely arise.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
So now, no, we have not had the COVID pandemic, had they not been doing this research,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and also doing it so badly and sloppily and incompetently under an auspices

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
of things like the WHO where the most unfit people to have done this.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And they should be removed.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I think the WHO should be defunded.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I really do.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It's so corrupt.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So is Garvey.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It's so seppy.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
All these organizations, which managed to sack hundreds of millions of dollars for the UK government

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
on the grounds we're doing are part protecting the world, the snappy other.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
With all it's doing is, is handsome corrupt incompetence in my book.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So I think this is the Scooby Doo and a nutshell.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And they think that it's enticing enough for you to blame.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Seppy and the WHO and all these big name people and all these big organizations of corporations.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000
They think you are going to be enticed just like these guys are enticed

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:45.000
to blame the profiteers, to blame the arrogant biologists, to blame the arrogant virologists,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
to blame the bioweapons guys.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And I would argue that the fifth generation war that's being waged on you counts on you

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
not seeing any farther than that.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It counts on you needing a bad guy.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It counts on you needing someone to blame.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And it counts on you believing in a virus because it's spread from Hong Kong.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Because it was supremely adapted to infecting and destroying human cells after years of being

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
manipulated in a laboratory to do so.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Do you think that gain of function is a possibility in the future?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I absolutely do, he says.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000
This is the Scooby Doo in a nutshell.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Told to you by somebody on the TV narrative side, on the social media narrative side,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
with a video still on YouTube with not struck.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And it won't be struck because this is exactly where they want the TV and social media people

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
to land, right here.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And when they land there, the vast majority of our side will come to say,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
see, basically we told you so.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And five years from now, our children will be permanently misled.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I think it's a good place to stop here.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
It's like if I'm out of sync, then what's the point, right?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I'm annoyed that I was out of sync.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I apologize for being out of sync.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I think it's kind of a memory problem, and I've already backed up everything twice,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
and so it's just a matter of deleting and cleaning that disk.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
It's not a matter of what is true of the council, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
The big Scooby Doo mystery is still being solved on this one right here.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
John Campbell and Professor DeGlish would have us believe that coronaviruses have pandemic potential

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
that can be accessed in laboratories and stitched together to make even worse.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So they basically have bought into the narrative the illusion of consensus

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
that will end up with our kids surrendering their sovereignty

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000
to this global fundamental inversion of human rights to free them to fascism.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000
This illusion of consensus is being perpetuated by Campbell and his guest.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I know they're nice guys. I know they've come a long way.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
But if you come a long way from being a totalitarian fascist creep

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000
with no idea of what's going on to kind of sort of understanding some stuff,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
it's not exactly progress. I'm sorry.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000
But if they're not questioning every single thing they thought right now,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
after he just said that, well, you know, if they'll do this for the origin of the virus,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
then why wouldn't what would they do for all this other stuff?

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Exactly!

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
This illusion of the consensus about what mystery needs to be solved is what we need to break.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:04.000
We've been set up to think differently about immunology and about virology

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and about biology so that we accept these ridiculous things happened

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
and we couldn't have stopped it.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
We accepted these ridiculous things happened and we couldn't have done nothing about it

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
because it was an emergency, because it was rushed.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
This illusion of consensus about a bat cave or natural virus that's now

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
maybe more dangerous than we thought because it was from a laboratory.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
You don't think that guy's smart enough to explain clones?

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
You don't think that guy's smart enough to know that there might have been a background signal there?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
You don't think that guy's smart enough to know that the protocols were murder

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
and the transfection is not medicine, but he's not saying it.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
He's saying that the spike protein was bad.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Spike protein caused clotting.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Spike protein has 78% of homology with human proteins.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So the spike protein itself is causing autoimmunity, not transfection, come on.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Come on, it can't be a transfection that they sprayed on us and then sequenced

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
and then claimed spread.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Couldn't be that.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
There's no viruses, they don't do that.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
There's no measles either.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Ladies and gentlemen, they took a conflated background signal with a crappy PCR test

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and told us lies about a pandemic potential that never existed in the first place.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And the pandemic potential that actually showed up at the beginning of the pandemic

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
was nothing more than bad protocols, fear, frustration, confusion and doubt.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Transfection is a medicine, ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000
They turned this into a mythology that they planned to govern our children by.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
A mythology about a novel virus that came and is still going.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
A novel virus that we can track and all the variants to.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
But who cares if it has a fear and cleavage site anymore?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Hey, Mr. DeGlish, can you tell us when the fear and cleavage site in COVID disappeared?

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Since the fear and cleavage site is so important, what variants have it still?

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Has anyone ever said anything about that to you?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000
What variants still have the fear and cleavage site, the special gain of function gift?

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
What variants still have the HIV inserts that are all positive, charged amino acids?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Where did they go?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
How come we're not charting those on the CBS news every night like we did with the deaths

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
on the chart of the globe?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Because they're a mythology!

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Because the only reason why that would matter if it was from a clone.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Because if you transfected people with a bunch of clones of a coronavirus that had a nasty spike protein

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.000
then there would be a lot of that nasty spike protein for a little while in those people.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And you'd be able to sequence it, you'd probably find the RNA, it'd be all great,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
but it would be in no danger.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:22.000
There'd be no danger of RNA sweeping the globe because RNA doesn't work like that.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
But we could trick them into believing that it did.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000
We could fool an entire planet with an infectious clone as long as we deny that clones matter.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000
As long as we can get every virologist to call Jonathan Cui an idiot.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:50.000
The moment that you start talking about clones, and the fact that the only way people can work with RNA viruses

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
is to make clones of them, people stop talking.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000
The moment you bring up recombinant DNA is the way they make chimeric antibodies, they go silent.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Recombinant DNA is the only thing they got.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
And that's why they're lying to our children because they want our children to be enslaved by this mythology,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.000
to surrender to this mythology so that they don't even see the cage that they're trapped by.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Ladies and gentlemen, you can find me at giggleonbiological.com.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.000
You can become a supporter if you scroll down.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:43.000
You can also join us here at giggleon.biow, where I'm sometimes announcing things, but I'm still not very good at it

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
because I do have a day job and I'm actually trying to do it well.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You can also support my work here with a one-time donation if you feel that need, but I would rather have you share my screen far and wide

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000
because right now I don't seem to be gaining any views at all.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And yeah, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, and you can say that very shortly for the current.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
My saying transfection is not immunization.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Please stop all transfections in humans. They are trying to eliminate the control group.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
By any means necessary.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Please make sure you stop by broken science initiative.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You can see my friend Matt Briggs has done in his own essay about the same paper that

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Jenny Rancord just came on my show to talk about yesterday,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
another wonderful lampooning of that paper.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.000
This has been Giga Home Biological, High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by Biologist.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Thanks for joining me. I'll see you tomorrow.
