WEBVTT

00:27.398 --> 00:27.618
I have.

01:00.573 --> 01:15.840
I still can't figure out why that is not.

01:16.321 --> 01:17.721
I have no responsibility.

01:29.239 --> 01:30.145
Stop lying.

01:32.138 --> 01:32.460
Stop.

02:18.559 --> 02:20.140
Okay, good morning everybody.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.221
Welcome to the show.

02:22.641 --> 02:25.303
This has been a long time coming.

02:26.304 --> 02:27.004
Sorry about that.

02:27.144 --> 02:33.988
I meant to have everything ready to go here and I didn't really have it ready to go on time.

02:34.008 --> 02:36.830
So I'm still cleaning stuff up here on my desk.

02:36.910 --> 02:37.750
I apologize.

02:38.911 --> 02:45.435
If you're here for the first time, let me just quick check and see if I got anything going over here on the YouTubage.

02:46.814 --> 02:51.117
It seems like we do have something going there Good morning.

02:51.157 --> 02:51.618
Good morning.

02:51.658 --> 03:01.164
Good morning This is the news program That isn't for everyone but is for anyone who is looking for the truth.

03:01.805 --> 03:11.232
My message is a little bit painful right now It is a message where Kevin McKernan is reading his own script or at least a script that he contributed a lot of

03:12.012 --> 03:25.377
A lot of ideas too and it is a spectacular commitment to this script That's all that's required in order for for these people to win, but we need to understand what that script is And how long that script has been running?

03:25.777 --> 03:35.341
Um, you know, they can they can adjust it on the fly in november, uh 2024 was when he was on the danny jones podcast and basically showed

03:36.340 --> 03:46.051
this spectacular commitment to a script that actually there were some pretty interesting meddlers that were on this script already in March of 2020.

03:47.813 --> 03:56.924
And two of those meddlers include a semi-retired neuroscientist apparently working in Japan, although I highly doubt that,

03:58.440 --> 04:09.768
And a young man from, I believe he might even be from Wisconsin, but he calls himself Atikin Skywalker.

04:10.863 --> 04:13.065
and he is an associate of George Webb.

04:13.105 --> 04:27.415
And in March of 2020, these two characters along with another character by the name of Paul Cottrell are basically already on the same script that Kevin McKernan would recite many years later.

04:27.435 --> 04:31.358
And I think that's only because this is all they ever had was this script.

04:32.119 --> 04:33.700
That's why in 2025, they have this,

04:36.747 --> 04:43.633
this person still five-year track record of basically following me around on the internet.

04:43.873 --> 04:51.019
Sometimes for a couple years he even had a link to my website as a place to find out the biology.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.641
Why is this happening?

04:54.882 --> 05:03.029
This is all they ever had though and they're actually confessing to it when Steve Kirsch has him on his VRSRF

05:05.155 --> 05:08.936
podcast twice, one time actually with the great Kevin McKernan.

05:09.976 --> 05:25.661
And so this timeline does not compute unless you understand that the longtime DNC donor, Steve Kirsch, is behind funding this network that I think Kevin McKernan is behind scripting.

05:26.656 --> 05:50.142
And that's why in 2024, despite the fact that I saw this script coming, unfortunately, in 2021 already, this guy is telling a story about Ralph Baric being some kind of super genius and master baker who shared his baking recipes with Wuhan, although there's this other thing called Golden Gate Assembly, and it's just basically that.

05:52.242 --> 06:03.732
and he of course promotes this guy who came to my house in January of 2022 to try and get me to publicly declare that the defuse proposal was real and that I was part of drastic

06:04.701 --> 06:21.193
Of course, drastic is a group of people, many of whom are from India and Pakistan, which is a really curious thing because it's one of the few countries that nobody ever mentions that Peter Hotez and Robert Malone are both making money from the vaccines in.

06:22.514 --> 06:32.002
Outbreaks never come from India, even though they're all very, very poor and their rivers are apparently full of antibiotic residue.

06:32.842 --> 06:38.507
And so the diffuse proposal didn't have an evaluation, but he says that it did and that they predicted a leak from it.

06:38.547 --> 06:39.808
That's why they didn't fund it.

06:39.828 --> 06:40.769
And that's ridiculous.

06:41.429 --> 06:46.033
He also tells a story about how it was probably already done because proposals are already done.

06:46.053 --> 06:51.078
But the odd thing is, is that's what I was quoted as saying in the Wuhan cover-up book.

06:51.758 --> 07:07.915
And finally, the whole argument is based on this sequence being 100% reable and verifiable and you must accept it and you must accept all of this molecular biology, all these techniques and all of these diagnostics as high fidelity instruments.

07:08.015 --> 07:08.355
And this

07:09.216 --> 07:13.998
should have been verified independently, individually by the FDA.

07:14.038 --> 07:17.879
But of course, it wasn't because we were in a PrEP Act emergency.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.921
And so instead, we've been forced to focus on these molecular details for more than five years.

07:23.442 --> 07:36.827
And one of the worst fake anti-vaxxers of all, James Lyons Weiler, was aware of all these molecular details, not that dissimilar to how Kevin McCairn was aware of these scripted molecular details.

07:37.647 --> 07:40.689
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a spectacular commitment to lies.

07:40.749 --> 07:41.809
That's all that's required.

07:42.330 --> 07:57.717
And so if somebody like Casey Means and somebody like Dr. Cruz wants to coordinatedly pretend that they're arguing with each other and keep a third unwitting party like Mary Talley Bowden on narrative, they can do that.

07:58.297 --> 07:59.438
And people will do that.

07:59.518 --> 08:03.240
People are doing that because this is about all the marbles.

08:03.260 --> 08:04.821
This is about the grandchildren of earth.

08:05.509 --> 08:11.390
And that's why there's a fake anti-vax, anti-vax, fake health freedom movement in America.

08:11.890 --> 08:14.591
And so yesterday I made some pretty bold statements.

08:15.731 --> 08:20.412
And the bold statements were based largely around this video.

08:21.253 --> 08:28.514
And I think it's an important thing to understand what I was trying to get across here.

08:28.554 --> 08:30.275
I think I'm just going to come on.

08:30.475 --> 08:31.795
Oh darn, I didn't do that yet.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.279
Give me one second, please.

08:34.299 --> 08:42.887
Let me set up my My excuse me equipment I Bet that's not even in focus either.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.809
Is it it's not in focus.

08:44.869 --> 08:52.636
I'm sure negative Such a failure I am Okay, I'm just gonna wing it here.

08:53.317 --> 08:57.701
Hopefully I'll get it about right Let me see if I can use a book

08:59.853 --> 09:02.535
Sorry about this, ladies and gentlemen, I apologize.

09:03.055 --> 09:05.497
I didn't check this one camera here.

09:05.557 --> 09:06.478
I think that's pretty good.

09:07.178 --> 09:08.539
If it's not, I'll fix it later.

09:09.420 --> 09:10.100
Let's see.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.162
Oh man, that's too big.

09:14.003 --> 09:14.843
You need to be at A.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.421
There we go.

09:20.861 --> 09:21.342
All right.

09:21.442 --> 09:42.906
So the list that I had up yesterday with regard to this video, and Robert Malone pretending to be a hero, is that he is connected to all of this fraudulent immunology that goes all the way back, all the way back to Gallo and Gardner and the discovery of the HIV

09:45.387 --> 09:48.388
AIDS virus, the HIV virus which causes AIDS.

09:49.208 --> 09:53.409
Again, not at all dissimilar to how SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID.

09:54.510 --> 10:07.013
So this is a kind of narrative, a kind of biological mythology that has been orchestrated and rehearsed several times, tested out or prototyped several times.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.734
One of these kinds of narratives that was

10:12.054 --> 10:28.908
seeded earlier than the pandemic that most of us were not aware of is Judy Mikovits and a potential cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, a potential source of it, a potential way to vaccinate against the cause of it so that the rest of the vaccine schedule would be safe.

10:29.809 --> 10:40.258
And I think this is all, again, it's not coincidence that all of these people are so tightly connected between a very limited number of mentors.

10:41.328 --> 10:48.118
And somewhere in that mentor chain is definitely Tony Fauci, but I'm not sure that he's necessarily a big driver of that brain trust.

10:48.178 --> 10:51.162
However, he is an excellent participant in it.

10:52.810 --> 11:15.261
And so I and I think only really Mark Kulak are able to succinctly say that we think it's important to understand Robert Malone because he is central to the orchestration of the and maybe even the on-the-fly adjustment of the pandemic narrative to try and keep the cruise ship on target.

11:16.561 --> 11:17.922
Pretty much in your face.

11:18.003 --> 11:19.424
All right, look, you gotta go.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.205
We're all very busy.

11:21.405 --> 11:22.526
I want to thank you for taking the time.

11:22.546 --> 11:24.567
I have one more question, very important question.

11:25.288 --> 11:26.469
Do you work for the CIA?

11:28.650 --> 11:36.136
Okay, so I could make a joke out of that, and then that would be clipped and become something on TikTok.

11:37.417 --> 11:38.498
I do not.

11:39.078 --> 11:39.919
I never have.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.063
I have had secret security clearance through the DOD.

11:46.687 --> 11:51.412
You cannot be working, and there was a point in my career where I was out of a job.

11:54.106 --> 12:03.029
basically run out of academia because I had blown the whistle on the Jesse Gelsinger gene therapy death at UPenn.

12:03.969 --> 12:06.190
Now, you can look at it yesterday.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.390
I started the stream with this video yesterday.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.390
I don't want to play it again.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.671
I don't want to belabor the points.

12:10.691 --> 12:14.312
But what I didn't do yesterday is I didn't actually read what I had on the screen.

12:14.772 --> 12:20.374
And a lot of people were really mad because I guess what I said on the screen yesterday was not very fair.

12:20.394 --> 12:21.334
And it was also in red.

12:22.054 --> 12:23.654
you were trying to hide what you were saying.

12:23.674 --> 12:25.275
It was pretty underhanded.

12:25.335 --> 12:36.297
Well, it's not really underhanded because I'm just pointing out how he has admitted in previous videos and previous interviews because he's done so many of them despite having a farm to manage.

12:36.777 --> 12:39.538
He's been so many places telling these stories.

12:39.598 --> 12:49.740
It's very easy to verify that he considers himself one of the heroes of the Zika virus outbreak, one of the heroes of the Ebola vaccine for none other than really bringing it to Merck.

12:50.160 --> 12:58.807
He considers himself an expert on probably what happened around US Amarant because he told Steve Hadfield that he was vetted for that job.

12:58.927 --> 13:02.830
And Steve Hadfield kind of laughed and didn't really take it seriously, but that's what he said.

13:06.625 --> 13:18.016
I believe, and I think Mark Kulak would say this is not crazy at least, if not, this is maybe more or less what he thinks too, that Whitney Webb is probably reading his script.

13:18.076 --> 13:23.401
Remember that Whitney Webb was the one who wrote this controversial article about the man in Wuhan.

13:26.223 --> 13:31.188
Whitney Webb was also present at the inaugural CHD conference where he was also present.

13:33.260 --> 13:43.570
And so I was told the story that Mary Holland and Meryl Nass vetted him for CHD, like went to his house and met him to see if he was a cool guy, stayed there for two days.

13:44.011 --> 13:48.996
And while they were there, they figured out that he didn't even know what the WEF was.

13:49.236 --> 13:51.879
They had to explain to him what the WEF was.

13:56.109 --> 14:03.371
That might sound ridiculous, but that's absolutely what I was told by no other person than Meryl Nass herself.

14:05.212 --> 14:11.274
Later in that same conversation, I said that Robert Malone is either a liar or he's an idiot if he took the shot.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.975
And she stormed away from the table saying, well, not everybody is smart as you, Jay.

14:17.155 --> 14:22.897
And I wish I was making that story up, pulling it out of thin air, but that's actually what happened.

14:23.564 --> 14:29.450
the night before Bobby announced his presidential candidacy in Boston.

14:31.432 --> 14:36.597
The extraordinary thing about it is, is that Mark Kulak was sitting at the table when that happened.

14:37.017 --> 14:43.764
She came over to our table and sat down and started talking smack about her friend Robert Malone.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.086
And when I wouldn't hear it,

14:46.840 --> 14:54.103
that he's either an expert and he's lying about taking the shot or he's not an expert and he's an idiot.

14:54.723 --> 14:58.624
See, that's the only two things that it can be because otherwise he's just a liar.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.585
He didn't take the shot.

14:59.605 --> 15:01.085
Of course he didn't take the shot.

15:01.806 --> 15:04.307
He's been an expert about this for 20 years.

15:06.954 --> 15:17.540
Even if he thought that transfection would be good for something, he was overdosing on famotidine to treat his coronavirus.

15:17.980 --> 15:22.702
He argued on the Brett Weinstein podcast that he took it so that he could travel.

15:25.004 --> 15:25.924
Why was he traveling?

15:26.585 --> 15:30.767
First time he went to Rome, it was also in part to visit the Vatican.

15:30.867 --> 15:34.249
So I mean, he took the shot because the Pope told him to.

15:35.270 --> 15:37.293
because the Italian government required it.

15:37.413 --> 15:49.791
Unfortunately, his handler, Steven Hatfill, was on the Tommy podcast alone and told a separate story about how when he went to Rome with Robert Malone, they both got there and they didn't have their vaccine cards.

15:52.150 --> 15:52.991
It was kind of funny.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.613
It didn't prevent him from entering the country.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.014
It was not really a big problem.

15:57.054 --> 16:00.798
It's probably because they were part of a US government envoy or something like that.

16:01.458 --> 16:05.322
So anyway, Mary Holland is the reason why I was fired from CHD.

16:05.742 --> 16:08.845
I think she's the primary saboteur of that organization.

16:08.905 --> 16:11.267
And a lot of the other ones just kind of go along with it.

16:11.307 --> 16:17.452
She has too much power because as the CEO of that nonprofit, I think she can basically fire and hire who she wants to.

16:17.512 --> 16:18.113
And she does.

16:19.194 --> 16:19.294
Um,

16:20.931 --> 16:24.932
I think that Robert Malone is probably responsible for scripting a lot of these people.

16:24.972 --> 16:27.533
I think he probably scripted Mickiewicz when she came out.

16:28.013 --> 16:36.216
I think he probably scripted a lot of the journalists, and he even brags about scripting the journalists that made her career at the New York Times on the Jesse Gelsinger story.

16:37.782 --> 16:44.067
And I think the whole reason why is because, you know, it's this idea to never question intramuscular injection.

16:44.087 --> 16:50.932
And more importantly, from an intellectual property perspective, never question PCR and lateral flow diagnostics.

16:52.106 --> 16:57.128
as proven standards of diagnostics in medicine.

16:57.168 --> 16:58.249
And that's absurdity.

16:58.649 --> 17:00.830
That's millions, if not billions of dollars.

17:01.210 --> 17:09.454
And that is a remnant stream of DNA that will never go away as long as this is not properly regulated by an FDA with teeth.

17:10.353 --> 17:14.336
which is precisely what they want to prevent from happening.

17:14.816 --> 17:27.085
Because the real FDA would now reflect back on five years of a pandemic emergency and try to take stock on what we overextended ourselves on and take stock in what we've learned.

17:27.125 --> 17:34.051
And one of the things we should have learned is that PCR is a terrible way to diagnose a medical condition because

17:35.172 --> 17:47.727
especially in an emergency situation, you might end up giving people pure supplementary oxygen because they tested positive for something and they have a pulse ox below, you know, let's say 90, 96 or something like that.

17:55.106 --> 18:00.048
So if you look forward on this a little bit, you know, that's why this, this is so crazy.

18:00.128 --> 18:05.150
These current round of vaccines, we're using traditional mRNA technology.

18:05.190 --> 18:06.350
And I just gagged at that.

18:09.772 --> 18:20.716
So, so we've already got, you know, modern and traditional, do you believe, you know, cause I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

18:22.737 --> 18:22.797
Uh,

18:24.514 --> 18:36.978
I think that, so the statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology, and I just gagged at that.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.142
So I will read these out for you a little bit.

18:42.162 --> 18:50.945
Let me make, this is just what you should, what I missed yesterday in that same interview to point out in that same interview.

18:51.425 --> 19:00.529
So first of all, in that interview, he actually admits that he's a long time DOD insider and the DOD is who Sasha Latapova blames as killing Americans.

19:00.589 --> 19:05.571
So it's very strange contradiction, long time DOD guy.

19:07.103 --> 19:13.989
He claims to be a repeat whistleblower, ethics king in many of the interviews and including this one, this time with Jesse Gelsinger.

19:14.009 --> 19:25.560
The problem with that is, after he says CIA and CIA and Fauci and AIDS and Ebola and all this other stuff in those interviews, Jesse Gelsinger was adenovirus.

19:26.701 --> 19:29.143
Adenovirus injected into the liver.

19:32.873 --> 19:51.081
Now, although he went through acute liver failure, is it really possible that Robert Malone is naive enough about biology that he thought that the reason why the adenovirus didn't work was because he gave too much adenovirus into the liver?

19:52.423 --> 19:58.108
which is of course what he claims, which is of course what he claims to be whistleblowing on, right?

19:58.128 --> 20:04.833
That they went off the protocol and they gave him a higher dose than the protocol allowed.

20:05.013 --> 20:12.279
And in earlier in that video, he says that, you know, it's really all about dose and about which populations it's appropriate for.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.242
And so he's on the same script.

20:16.322 --> 20:19.525
It's the same very, very nuanced,

20:20.723 --> 20:22.645
legal ease like script.

20:26.108 --> 20:36.776
And so I just want to point out that the ethics king should have damn well known that adenovirus injected into the body wherever it would go and express a protein would cause autoimmunity.

20:36.796 --> 20:45.924
And so that might not be liver failure if you don't inject it in the liver, but it could be any other number of autoimmunities that could take any number of years to come about.

20:47.492 --> 21:00.762
I would argue that he actually understood very well why Jesse Gelsinger was an acute failure and why transfection intramuscularly injected might not always be an acute failure.

21:03.283 --> 21:08.607
But he's definitely sophisticated enough to know that it would be a long-term failure inevitably.

21:10.188 --> 21:15.092
That's why I spoke out about it because it is a long-term failure inevitably.

21:15.152 --> 21:16.373
There are no animals

21:17.199 --> 21:29.243
on any academic benches or in any academic labs that have been transfected as babies in order to overexpress a protein and then studied for their whole lives the results of that transfection.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.704
Because transfected animals die.

21:37.127 --> 22:01.486
Um, so he says substack in this interview repeatedly, and interestingly that I just never realized this until yesterday, but the whole reason why Paul Offit does a podcast on YouTube with Vincent Racaniello, the guy who basically is credited with inventing, invented infectious clones with David Baltimore,

22:02.580 --> 22:08.684
they do a video podcast about Paul Offit's Substack.

22:09.845 --> 22:16.190
Isn't that remarkable that Paul Offit makes money from Substack and so does Robert Malone?

22:18.143 --> 22:45.993
And if we just were to list all of the people that make a lot of money from Substack from very early on, who knew that they should go there and were producing articles every day, one or two in that video, even Del Bigtree marvels at him, like you produce like a Substack a day, sometimes multiple Substacks a day, all seven days a week, just like Jessica Hockett, just like a lot of these other fake Substacks that are using a combination of AI

22:46.833 --> 22:50.195
AI content and AI pirated content.

22:52.156 --> 23:07.663
You don't think for one second that they're taking every stream I ever make and feeding it into a transcript and then putting it through a chat bot and then trying to digest something out that Jessica Hockett can publish and that they have a whole team of people crossing stuff out.

23:07.703 --> 23:08.924
Not that, not that, not that.

23:08.964 --> 23:09.704
Okay, take these.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.665
These terms are good.

23:10.845 --> 23:11.565
Absorb those.

23:13.366 --> 23:15.147
They're spending a lot of money

23:16.673 --> 23:20.994
trying to use up what they can and then use the rest to try and discourage me.

23:21.034 --> 23:22.174
So let's keep looking at this.

23:22.234 --> 23:27.995
He says all the book titles accurately, except he calls this one the lab leak coverup.

23:29.195 --> 23:29.995
Check it yourself.

23:30.775 --> 23:32.816
He gets this title completely wrong.

23:33.156 --> 23:34.616
I wonder if that was by accident.

23:35.216 --> 23:43.878
Maybe it was by accident that he spelled David Hone's name wrong in the Anthony Fauci book as one of the readers of it.

23:44.118 --> 23:44.958
His good friend.

23:45.874 --> 23:47.255
Davis Hone.

23:50.097 --> 24:00.945
So he says he's never revealed classified information, but I thought that he screwed himself as a whistleblower, but no, he gave away only information that was in the public domain.

24:00.985 --> 24:06.189
That's what he said in this video, which means he's not really that much of a hero.

24:06.229 --> 24:08.310
He didn't actually burn any bridges.

24:09.051 --> 24:11.873
Maybe he didn't burn any bridges either with Jesse Gelsinger.

24:13.715 --> 24:14.215
Do you see?

24:14.756 --> 24:31.710
If he's carefully walking the line between, it's kind of different than, I don't know, moving to Russia and saying that there's some, I mean, it's, he said in this video that he has many non-disclosure agreements.

24:31.790 --> 24:41.318
One of the only reasons why I can talk the way that I talk and tell you all the things that I can tell you is because I didn't sign a non-disclosure agreement with CHD when I left.

24:43.806 --> 24:52.047
I don't know how much they would have had to offer me for me to sign, but I assure you they offered me $8,000 and it was a pretty easy decision to make not to sign it.

24:53.339 --> 24:56.781
That's why I can tell you what we talked about in every meeting.

24:56.841 --> 24:58.781
I can tell you how many people were in the meeting.

24:58.841 --> 25:00.882
I can tell you how the book is written.

25:00.962 --> 25:02.343
I can tell you how long it took.

25:02.443 --> 25:03.824
I can tell you who was involved.

25:03.884 --> 25:19.831
I can tell you all the people who know that this guy right here is a fraud and involved with it, probably using the script that Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone had prepared before the pandemic, the same script that Charles Rixey was supposed to play hero boy on.

25:21.633 --> 25:26.775
And what they attempted to do was use Charles Rixey to get me to be the guy in this book.

25:26.835 --> 25:29.877
And then, you know, Charles Rixey and I would both be in the book.

25:29.917 --> 25:35.940
And then, you know, Charles Rixey, we'd get on, on Joe Rogan and give a shout out to get going biological with no website.

25:35.960 --> 25:36.760
And then it would be over.

25:38.181 --> 25:39.121
We'd be moving on.

25:39.921 --> 25:42.142
The currency would collapse and yada, yada, yada.

25:42.162 --> 25:47.405
We, everybody would have accepted and everything would be fine because it was a lab leak and we're not there.

25:48.143 --> 26:11.035
We're not there for a number of reasons, but one of the big reasons why we're not there is because these clowns made a mistake, and this guy was in a web meeting, and my reaction was not, oh cool, Rixey brought a guy that I know into a private meeting about the book, and his name is Kevin McCarron, he's cool, he's a neuroscientist.

26:11.155 --> 26:12.355
No, that's not what I did.

26:14.596 --> 26:17.738
I said that this guy is a meddler, I think he's fake,

26:20.865 --> 26:28.423
And I think it's quite scary that Charles Rixey is in a hotel room with that guy and this manuscript open.

26:28.443 --> 26:29.505
That's really weird.

26:30.717 --> 26:36.079
And then Charles Rixey didn't call in for a couple days and they fired him, or at least that's what they said.

26:36.099 --> 26:40.561
I don't know what happens because none of this stuff is ever in person.

26:40.581 --> 26:43.862
There's no Children's Health Defense to go to.

26:44.543 --> 26:50.905
So as far as I know, I was working for something called Children's Health Defense, but who was handling me?

26:51.305 --> 26:52.406
Who was talking to me?

26:52.466 --> 26:53.746
What we were really doing?

26:53.766 --> 26:54.987
I don't know.

26:56.025 --> 27:04.590
I do appear to have been able to get Sina Bhavari and Alison Tortora's 2019 coronavirus prediction paper in the book.

27:05.531 --> 27:08.073
They seem to have absorbed that without much pain.

27:08.453 --> 27:11.154
So there's some sign that I contributed to the book.

27:11.195 --> 27:17.038
There's some sign that something kind of pseudo-organic is contained within this book.

27:17.498 --> 27:24.663
But in the end, something tastes so disturbing, metallic about it.

27:26.192 --> 27:41.535
And it has to do with the fact that every one of these people at one point or another pretended to be my good friend, my big fan, and wanted to help in any way they possibly could until I described any number of ways they could help me.

27:41.575 --> 27:43.075
And then they were pretty busy.

27:45.876 --> 27:53.838
And so as a person who worked for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he never really lied to me.

27:54.018 --> 27:55.858
I didn't get to talk to him that often.

27:57.421 --> 27:59.641
and then got handed off to CHD.

28:02.142 --> 28:11.284
Yes, I got paid by them, but I tried my best to maintain my integrity until it was impossible to do so.

28:12.744 --> 28:24.166
And when it was impossible to maintain my integrity, I kept going and they fired me.

28:25.202 --> 28:29.366
They fired me because I kept talking about the truth.

28:30.507 --> 28:32.469
And they kept asking me to stop.

28:32.729 --> 28:36.393
So many different people asked me to stop naming names.

28:36.553 --> 28:40.196
And many of them asked me to stop naming that name right there.

28:41.057 --> 28:41.818
Robert Malone.

28:43.239 --> 28:46.662
Jay Bhattacharya has asked me to not name that name anymore.

28:46.742 --> 28:50.326
Mary Holland fired me for naming that name.

28:53.058 --> 29:04.048
And maybe for stating specifically that those two, sorry, Robert Malone and Meryl Nass are extremely good friends.

29:04.769 --> 29:15.519
Because at the Boston announcement, when Robert Malone stood up to walk over to Meryl Nass in the aisle, there were no words.

29:17.121 --> 29:18.202
There was no handshake.

29:19.639 --> 29:34.984
It was an immediate hug, and it was a tight hug, just like the hug that Steve Bannon gave to Lee Min Yan on the stage in January of 2020, or February of 2020, whenever it was, saying that she needs to run for Senate.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.066
And it was striking.

29:41.486 --> 29:43.347
I think one of us got it on camera even.

29:44.659 --> 29:50.502
Almost without words, they walked away and went away from the crowd to talk for a little while and then came back.

29:50.982 --> 30:02.408
This is a very, very big deal that he says he worked on social media control programs for Arab Spring and that that work remains classified and in use by the CIA.

30:05.276 --> 30:14.418
Ladies and gentlemen, that interview is basically a gigantic admission that the conservative health freedom movement in America is a giant farce.

30:15.418 --> 30:17.138
Maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:17.178 --> 30:33.962
has been long conned and played and maybe he's not clever enough to see it, but I think more likely it is that several people in his inner circle are actively lying to him and they're happy to do it because they see themselves as part of a national security operation

30:35.123 --> 30:50.693
making sure that there is no meaningful resistance to intramuscular injection as medicine, that there's no meaningful resistance to virology as a science, and that there's no meaningful resistance to public health as a reason.

30:53.215 --> 30:53.936
That's what I think.

30:55.016 --> 31:00.140
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigo and Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.721
It's 20th of May, 2025.

31:04.202 --> 31:05.083
Just want to be funny.

31:06.023 --> 31:11.547
Gentlemen, people used to say it was impossible to run tests on a single drop of blood.

31:11.867 --> 31:16.010
Well, I fired those people and hired new ones, and now, behold.

31:19.269 --> 31:20.631
Oh, science noise.

31:20.931 --> 31:31.660
With just one drop of blood, our device can tell you exactly which Sopranos character you are without having to take a dumb quiz written by a social media intern.

31:31.860 --> 31:32.741
Why Sopranos?

31:33.061 --> 31:36.364
Because my company is like a criminal enterprise.

31:36.684 --> 31:36.984
All right.

31:37.465 --> 31:41.388
And for no particular reason, I'm going to be behind this curtain for the entire demonstration.

31:42.289 --> 31:44.771
All we need is a tiny blood sample.

31:47.698 --> 31:48.979
Ew, it's doing stuff.

31:53.543 --> 31:55.044
This says Artie Bucco.

31:55.064 --> 31:55.685
Who's that?

31:56.125 --> 31:57.346
Bald guy at the restaurant.

31:57.566 --> 31:57.786
Oh, yeah.

31:57.986 --> 31:59.428
He and Tony were friends growing up.

31:59.768 --> 32:00.669
Ah, right, right, right.

32:01.149 --> 32:03.011
I'm not sure this machine is for us.

32:03.491 --> 32:03.952
Just a sec.

32:03.992 --> 32:05.693
Let me, uh, recalibrate something.

32:08.956 --> 32:09.496
Tony.

32:09.797 --> 32:10.297
All right.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.459
Now this is f****** Walgreens.

32:15.965 --> 32:24.750
So I have been making the argument, of course, that what this is really all about is seen from a longer time horizon.

32:25.451 --> 32:32.615
And if you realize that they understand that the population pyramid of the West is not shaped in a healthy way,

32:33.610 --> 32:41.955
and that recovery could be 10 generations away or more, they understand that there is a population collapse coming.

32:41.995 --> 32:57.165
And so they can make all the, let's say depopulation narratives they want to, and that can go viral on the internet because that essentially attributes a natural phenomenon to their power.

32:57.825 --> 33:00.967
It attributes a natural phenomenon to their control.

33:01.547 --> 33:20.657
And so as we watch our communities kind of slow motion collapse as the elementary schools are less full, and we see our children sort of grow up in a funny way because of the way that social media is warping their understanding of society,

33:21.517 --> 33:30.060
We won't really understand that one of the biggest forces that we have to face is this depopulation phenomenon.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.340
It is going to happen.

33:33.220 --> 33:41.503
All of these houses in Pittsburgh that are occupied by retired people are going to be occupied by empty, empty, they're going to be empty

33:42.486 --> 33:47.748
If there isn't somebody to move into them, to take them over, to maintain them, they're gonna fall apart.

33:48.749 --> 33:51.750
And these people have seen this all coming for a long time.

33:53.171 --> 34:03.716
These people have understood that there's huge opportunities here for wealth, for resources, and for reorganization of the way that societies govern themselves.

34:04.096 --> 34:10.139
And of course there needs to be a reorganization of global trade if the consumer base

34:10.879 --> 34:25.952
that was once the source of a thriving NCAA football season every year and a thriving NCAA basketball season every year, now suddenly those universities are going to very quickly run out of students.

34:29.876 --> 34:33.759
And so something about that ecosystem has got to change drastically.

34:35.911 --> 34:42.393
Something about the way that the Ivory Towers recruit students is gonna have to change drastically.

34:42.553 --> 34:49.496
All of these things are seen, foreseen, and looked at for a long time before they have arrived.

34:49.636 --> 35:02.621
And the coronavirus pandemic, the myth of that, is part of this mythological history that we're experiencing that encompasses much more than that, of course.

35:03.686 --> 35:04.974
And the idea again is.

35:07.867 --> 35:10.288
for us not to understand what's going on.

35:10.348 --> 35:23.473
And one of the most important, maybe insights that I've had for myself in the last, let's say two or three months is this idea popped in my head about three months ago, but it didn't really understand what it actually meant.

35:24.353 --> 35:29.975
And then about a week ago, it really struck me and I rearranged the words and it made much more sense.

35:30.636 --> 35:36.678
And when I say get off social media, I mean, really, this is already, it may already be too late.

35:37.967 --> 35:44.973
to some extent, that the trap was already being set a long time ago, already sprung a long time ago.

35:45.513 --> 35:48.295
Most of the wealth of America may already be gone.

35:49.636 --> 35:57.603
In fact, that may be the reason why we are at where we are at right now, that the clock has already effectively been run out.

35:57.723 --> 36:04.809
And now the people are trying as best they can to leave the stadium without letting anybody know that the game's already over.

36:08.482 --> 36:19.930
I don't want to be too pessimistic, but one of the last ways out is to stop using social media the way they want you to use it and start using it exclusively to subvert it.

36:21.271 --> 36:25.234
The only thing that we should be doing is trying to encourage people to get off of it.

36:26.374 --> 36:31.258
And I don't know all the alternatives, but you know, there's only 24 hours in a day.

36:31.338 --> 36:34.340
Nobody needs to be on social media unless they're selling something.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.802
and no one else are buying something, I guess you can go on social media if you want to.

36:40.322 --> 36:55.208
But look, get off social media because the reason why Twitter had a character limit was because their AI machine learning algorithms had a character limit for optimal training.

36:56.868 --> 37:02.851
They limited it that way so that they could train the AI with a limited amount of text examples.

37:04.090 --> 37:12.696
You know, they basically, they basically streamlined the training input that their AI would have.

37:12.756 --> 37:20.642
And then when the, when they felt like they exhausted that size, a piece of language, they increased it a little bit.

37:22.063 --> 37:22.683
That's all.

37:23.164 --> 37:31.750
It had nothing to do with server space or, you know, the limits of, of, of short form publishing, short form publishing my ass.

37:32.150 --> 37:32.791
Stop lying.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.419
And so we already acquiesced to it.

37:37.479 --> 37:45.925
We already trained social media and X. We already gave it feedback so that it can fool us even better.

37:47.526 --> 37:53.150
So it's already a finely tuned military social control algorithm.

37:54.525 --> 37:56.106
and you have to respect it as that.

37:56.146 --> 37:57.787
You have to taunt it as that.

37:58.367 --> 38:12.616
And so the only way to taunt it might be to find the most subversive accounts and retweet them and try to be a subversive account of your own, but do not interact with these people on that medium.

38:14.841 --> 38:17.104
You're better off not using any time there at all.

38:17.224 --> 38:19.767
I still go there and I still try to subvert it.

38:19.847 --> 38:20.868
You don't need to do that.

38:20.888 --> 38:22.150
You don't follow my example.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.371
You don't need to share that at all.

38:23.411 --> 38:31.921
But if you go there, one of the things you could do is retweet every one of the things that I do that you think is subversive enough to retweet.

38:33.283 --> 38:46.031
So I think no one has ever succinctly described it this way, said it this way, and that should be a huge red flag for you because I only started in this fight a few years ago.

38:46.111 --> 38:47.872
Before that, I was completely lost.

38:48.052 --> 38:53.596
I was completely an academic biologist, wanting tenure, fighting for the grant money.

38:54.645 --> 39:02.316
And for me to be here right now, sitting in front of a virtual slide that says, autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

39:02.436 --> 39:10.829
When I used to consider writing grants about this stuff, I used to do electrophysiology for a guy who worked on Angelman syndrome.

39:11.369 --> 39:16.772
and write grants where Angelman's syndrome is kind of a genetic sort of version of autism.

39:17.212 --> 39:27.458
And so if you fund us studying this genetic model of Angelman's disease in mice, then you'll also be funding autism research.

39:28.018 --> 39:35.382
So I understand what I'm saying when I say it and how crazy it is in some ways to think that I have

39:39.136 --> 39:41.258
moved that far in my thinking.

39:42.019 --> 39:56.614
The same way this has quite a lot of progress from my original place on my bicycle in Pittsburgh in 2020, talking about a coronavirus laboratory leak being not only likely, but it's happened before.

39:56.654 --> 39:57.575
It happens all the time.

39:57.595 --> 39:58.676
Look at all these articles.

40:01.673 --> 40:13.160
And so one of the things that I would challenge you to do is to see that so many of these people that have been writing books and hadn't been in front of these people on stage for decades have not made the kind of progress that I've made.

40:15.621 --> 40:16.962
They've hardly made any progress.

40:17.002 --> 40:23.386
They make no scientific progress and they get right to free speech and anti-mandate.

40:24.804 --> 40:29.426
They get right to there's no placebo controlled trials and then that's it, they're done.

40:30.187 --> 40:32.228
No more progress, that's where we're stuck.

40:33.489 --> 40:52.319
Instead of being able to succinctly explain to a high school student that no, pandemics and gain of function are myths that a national security state has told you in order to make sure that you and your children never question intramuscular injection as a methodology because they tend to use it in perpetuity.

40:53.283 --> 40:55.525
and make you into an experimental animal.

40:56.166 --> 41:01.411
You never questioned virology as a science because that is the central illusion.

41:04.493 --> 41:12.981
And right now, like it or not, the state of the art in virology is PCR as a detection device.

41:13.422 --> 41:15.503
There's no, that's it.

41:16.570 --> 41:25.073
And that's why PCR is a detection device for the pandemic has never been questioned by any of these actors that I thought were good guys.

41:25.894 --> 41:30.635
Because it's part of this central objective list.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.657
The other one is that public health is never questioned as a reason.

41:37.093 --> 41:49.142
And that's important to note because a lot of these people are advocating for a computer-based, an AI-optimized, individualized health program that will include your genotype and all this other stuff.

41:50.403 --> 41:53.446
And so it's a different kind of public health.

41:59.344 --> 42:07.552
Um, the statement was made that, uh, these current round of vaccines were using traditional MRNA technology.

42:07.592 --> 42:08.773
And I just gagged at that.

42:12.196 --> 42:23.126
So, so we've already got, you know, modern and traditional, do you believe, you know, cause I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

42:25.167 --> 42:25.227
Uh,

42:26.920 --> 42:33.742
I think that, uh, so for instance, some of these like yellow fever, um, is an example.

42:34.642 --> 42:42.564
Uh, I think that the, the, the, another one of my cute little phrases, you give a three year old a hammer and everything becomes a nail.

42:42.764 --> 42:42.964
Yes.

42:43.384 --> 42:49.706
And so of course, this answer goes on a long time, but he doesn't answer anything and that's because this is a joke.

42:50.968 --> 43:07.341
we are having a joke played on us and what is most disturbing to me is that no one on the in the middle or on the left realizes that this administration could be discredited in a grand slam sort of way if they just kind of

43:08.510 --> 43:25.031
Publicized my story a little bit my insights into what they're doing and what they're not doing and how they've done it and and why but of course that's never gonna happen because both sides are on a narrative which Puts

43:26.428 --> 43:33.635
Andrew Wakefield as hero or villain, Paul Offit as hero or villain, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:33.815 --> 43:39.241
as hero or villain, Mary Holland as hero or villain.

43:39.581 --> 43:48.489
And so these are agreements that both of those people promote each other as the opposite of themselves.

43:49.355 --> 43:51.358
And this guy gave you that list as well.

43:51.438 --> 43:55.463
Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak are on that list as well.

43:55.503 --> 43:59.689
It is a cast of characters that reinforces each other.

44:01.676 --> 44:10.443
And the way that this guy appeared on scene and has behaved ever since has revealed him to be one of the central script writers in this.

44:10.764 --> 44:21.412
One of the only guys who can really understand how deep the illusion is and how much of it is a national security thing.

44:21.793 --> 44:25.416
That's the reason why they are working so hard on her.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.557
She's one of the last

44:29.241 --> 44:32.005
Fully bamboozled, I think, unwitting participants.

44:32.066 --> 44:34.029
I don't think that she's a bad guy.

44:34.449 --> 44:36.433
It's possible, but I don't think so.

44:36.853 --> 44:42.683
I think she still has principles, and I think she could come to realize how badly she's been played.

44:44.011 --> 44:44.351
I don't know.

44:44.992 --> 44:45.492
I don't know.

44:45.792 --> 44:47.273
I know for sure that he's scripted.

44:47.713 --> 45:01.480
I know for sure that she's playing for their team because she's advocated very much for the taking of medical data and using AI to figure out the solution to the chronic disease epidemic.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.441
Not that dissimilar to what Mary Holland has advocated for.

45:05.961 --> 45:09.682
Not that dissimilar to what James Lyons Weiler has advocated for.

45:10.083 --> 45:14.264
I'm sure that the Bitcoin Dr. Polymath guy will also advocate for that.

45:15.084 --> 45:17.705
And so this is all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

45:18.285 --> 45:19.646
It's all scripted bullshit.

45:20.266 --> 45:30.249
That's the same reason why two of the highest positions in the FDA are occupied by COVID-19 podcasters.

45:32.301 --> 45:37.283
We are one appointment away from this being a hat trick.

45:39.264 --> 45:45.726
That guy has grown his hair out and tried to get a little weight and puts on a suit and pretends he's an adult.

45:48.447 --> 45:50.368
He's never done any meaningful science.

45:50.428 --> 45:56.850
He can't outline one contribution that he's made to our fundamental understanding of anything.

45:58.123 --> 46:03.725
And yes, I can name exactly the fundamental contributions to our understanding of anything that I've made.

46:04.645 --> 46:09.366
And so I have made the argument that Paul Offit is the same scripted bullshit.

46:09.426 --> 46:16.288
That's why Paul Offit is plugging a substack called Beyond the Noise.

46:16.988 --> 46:21.329
Number two, that's why Paul Offit was opposite Mary Holland in 2015 on Democracy Now.

46:23.883 --> 46:26.165
arguing exactly the same talking points.

46:26.746 --> 46:29.889
That is 10 years ago.

46:29.969 --> 46:40.719
They were put in place because they knew that a pandemic narrative like the Spars pandemic or dark winter would never be able to happen

46:41.480 --> 46:56.453
if there was a significant skepticism of the basic biology of intramuscular injection, if there was a significant actual skepticism of virology and an actual skepticism of public health.

46:57.714 --> 47:04.319
And so they made those skepticisms about useless things, like are there viruses or not?

47:05.400 --> 47:07.342
Is there asymptomatic spread or not?

47:07.702 --> 47:09.244
Can you overcycle PCR?

47:15.040 --> 47:20.441
And he has been on this script for this national security script.

47:20.841 --> 47:23.342
And that's what the Human Genome Project is.

47:23.662 --> 47:25.862
It is a national security priority.

47:25.922 --> 47:28.403
It is the biggest national security priority.

47:28.983 --> 47:37.785
As Robert Malone said in that interview, pretended, so I was told they spent a lot more money on this than on the atomic weapons program.

47:37.825 --> 47:38.725
Well, no shit.

47:41.426 --> 47:43.346
So all of these people are playing dumb.

47:44.701 --> 47:48.829
We've been hearing about how all our medical records are going electronic.

47:49.470 --> 47:52.736
So, for the record, how exactly does that work?

47:53.518 --> 47:56.424
Rather than ask your doctor, ask our Lee Cowan.

47:58.086 --> 48:02.089
This may not look like the typical setting for a medical software.

48:02.249 --> 48:02.550
Okay.

48:02.590 --> 48:03.591
So you remember, right?

48:03.651 --> 48:05.532
We can do a timelines about things.

48:05.592 --> 48:09.235
If you do a 60 minutes timeline, you'll have day sack.

48:09.255 --> 48:11.317
And then a year or two later, you have day sack.

48:11.797 --> 48:17.943
And then a year or two later, you have, uh, then like a month or two later, you'll have, uh, George Webb.

48:18.023 --> 48:19.444
And so then, you know, it's, it's just,

48:21.470 --> 48:23.932
60 Minutes is a very interesting timeline.

48:24.433 --> 48:36.347
In 2019, they did a story about the EPIC database and what I've been making the argument about the PCR at all of the universities in America that these

48:37.168 --> 48:42.851
supposedly adults with principals had not enough principals to keep their kids home for a year.

48:43.391 --> 48:47.113
They swabbed them every week at some of these universities.

48:47.513 --> 48:49.874
And those kids are on the EPIC database.

48:50.014 --> 48:51.094
And I told you that.

48:51.234 --> 48:57.717
I said that with those swabs and using AI, they don't need identified records.

48:57.777 --> 49:00.919
They can de-identify the records and then re-identify them.

49:00.999 --> 49:03.460
Some shady means or some, uh,

49:03.900 --> 49:05.001
any means they want to.

49:05.141 --> 49:08.922
They can pay the security guard, the garbage guy, the records person.

49:10.403 --> 49:11.503
It's just a little money.

49:13.424 --> 49:15.004
This scam is real.

49:15.325 --> 49:20.427
Now, would it surprise you if the Epic database had already been running for years?

49:22.267 --> 49:31.731
Was already a billion dollar profitable thing that had over 60% of all the medical records of America already on it?

49:32.487 --> 49:33.487
Ready to go!

49:33.507 --> 49:40.709
All ready to go for the fake PCR testing that would be the mass sampling of America.

49:40.870 --> 49:41.810
All ready to go.

49:42.550 --> 49:43.410
Isn't that funny?

49:43.530 --> 49:46.511
Kevin McKernan never usefully questioned PCR.

49:46.551 --> 49:50.432
In fact, he said it was just a matter of which primers were used.

49:50.832 --> 49:54.153
Get in a little closer, and that's even more evident.

49:54.473 --> 49:56.254
It's as much theme park here as anything.

49:56.634 --> 49:59.275
Alice in Wonderland kind of stuff, literally.

49:59.855 --> 50:06.741
The workspaces here can be in old railway cars or subway cars, tree houses and gingerbread houses.

50:07.342 --> 50:13.687
Even its employee cafeteria looks like a train depot to a land that storybooks are written about.

50:14.188 --> 50:17.911
I walked through and was like, what is this?

50:19.687 --> 50:28.796
What it is is the self-described intergalactic headquarters of the Epic in the middle of the farm fields of Verona, Wisconsin, just outside Madison.

50:29.557 --> 50:32.740
If you've never heard of this place, just ask your doctor.

50:33.362 --> 50:41.825
because it's Epic software that handles the private medical records of about 60% of the patients in this country, probably yours.

50:42.726 --> 50:51.729
One of the things that strikes me is that Epic has such a big reach, and it really impacts so many people's lives, and yet so many people have never heard of Epic.

50:51.749 --> 50:52.049
I know.

50:52.650 --> 50:53.970
Yes, it's behind the scenes.

50:54.210 --> 50:56.011
We haven't advertised.

50:56.391 --> 50:58.132
We haven't put out press releases.

50:59.132 --> 51:01.353
And I don't know if that was a good thing to do or not.

51:02.302 --> 51:16.993
Judy Faulkner is the 76-year-old genius behind Epic, a computer software engineer and admitted... 76-year-old genius.

51:17.013 --> 51:19.855
76-year-old genius.

51:20.555 --> 51:20.916
What?

51:21.856 --> 51:26.740
Nerd, who built this curious place in her own curious image.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.761
Happy birthday to you.

51:29.824 --> 51:39.127
A hint of her personality was revealed last year when, to celebrate Epic's 40th anniversary, she dressed like she was back in the 70s again.

51:39.767 --> 51:41.507
Well, here's the skinny man.

51:42.688 --> 51:43.768
That's far out.

51:44.508 --> 51:45.849
She's a little far out too.

51:46.389 --> 51:47.489
Far out in front.

51:48.009 --> 51:56.552
She not only built a giant tech company for the ground up, but in the process, made herself one of the richest self-made women in the world.

51:57.253 --> 52:02.737
We have to compete with Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.

52:02.958 --> 52:07.962
We get a lot of acceptances because people look around and say, I think I'd like to work here.

52:08.868 --> 52:13.149
There are nearly 10,000 employees at Epic who mingle among the artwork.

52:13.490 --> 52:16.070
That about doubles the population of Verona.

52:16.691 --> 52:19.171
It's a young place, average age about 26.

52:20.152 --> 52:27.894
Peg Horner and Nicholas Bostrom could have worked in sunny Silicon Valley, but they chose to come to wintry Wisconsin instead.

52:28.415 --> 52:35.097
Because, they say, as far as big tech companies go, Epic is doing more than just building phones.

52:35.936 --> 52:39.300
We feel like we have an impact to make.

52:39.620 --> 52:42.623
And it's something that I actually really value about here.

52:42.643 --> 52:44.585
I don't feel like I'm just clocking in and clocking out.

52:44.605 --> 52:49.390
You know, we're not here to just grind out on something that's not really doing anything.

52:49.470 --> 52:53.214
It's making other people be able to be healthy and happy.

52:53.875 --> 52:59.524
It was 1979 when the company started, in a basement, with just two employees.

53:00.105 --> 53:00.565
The goal?

53:00.906 --> 53:08.677
To move patient records from overstuffed, dog-eared manila folders to digital records, accessible with a click of a mouse.

53:09.460 --> 53:13.803
No one had spent much time figuring out just how to get a computer to handle all that.

53:13.963 --> 53:19.927
And so the claim, of course, is that she did that because she wanted to help and because she wanted to make a lot of money.

53:20.528 --> 53:22.489
She wanted to get those dead presidents.

53:22.970 --> 53:24.090
OK, whatever.

53:24.871 --> 53:30.835
Not that it might not be a national security priority under the Human Genome Project to set something like that up, would it?

53:31.416 --> 53:33.577
I can't imagine that would be the case.

53:33.697 --> 53:34.057
No, no.

53:34.938 --> 53:40.770
But Faulkner always had a way with computers and she engineered a program herself.

53:41.545 --> 53:44.306
I used to like when I was a kid to play with clay and make them.

53:44.506 --> 53:47.547
I'm sorry, but this is like weird to me now.

53:47.627 --> 54:07.494
All of a sudden I'm starting to see all kinds of these, what I have to believe are fake people because you know, it's, it's like Elon Musk and his six unrelated, extremely successful tech companies that are all funded by what they're funded by military contracts with military directed

54:07.994 --> 54:09.735
initiatives and directives.

54:09.795 --> 54:13.736
And so it's like, okay, but then how many of these ideas are really his?

54:13.796 --> 54:18.538
How many of these engineers did he really find and bring together and convince to work on this?

54:18.998 --> 54:22.619
And how many of them are just government employees that flew in and put on the badge?

54:23.059 --> 54:24.500
And the same thing goes here.

54:24.580 --> 54:35.984
Are you telling me that this person somehow invented a special kind of database with special kinds of blocks where you could put data in very special ways?

54:36.824 --> 54:43.305
It looks kind of like that thing in, shoot, I'm not going to think of it.

54:44.266 --> 54:49.347
What was the recent movie with Matthew McConaughey?

54:49.407 --> 54:55.368
It's like in the future and they travel through time and he's inside of this library looking thing.

54:55.428 --> 54:57.688
Like, come on, this is such a joke.

54:58.128 --> 54:58.968
Things out of clay.

54:59.189 --> 55:02.549
And I always thought of computer programming as clay of the mind.

55:03.069 --> 55:06.490
The first time I did something and there it was on the screen, it was wow.

55:07.546 --> 55:08.527
It's very creative.

55:08.647 --> 55:12.149
Holy shit, that sounds so bad.

55:12.449 --> 55:14.030
Interstellar, yes, thank you.

55:15.070 --> 55:15.831
Interstellar.

55:16.211 --> 55:21.394
To a system that is now integral to patient care in nearly every major U.S.

55:21.454 --> 55:22.055
health system.

55:22.495 --> 55:29.379
Its ubiquity means that you can now go almost anywhere to be treated, and your medical records will likely follow you there.

55:29.755 --> 55:32.496
Here's an example of what my test results look like right from here.

55:32.516 --> 55:44.119
In fact, you can now check your lab results, refill medications, make appointments, even share your medical records right from an Epic app, says engineer Sean Bina.

55:44.339 --> 55:49.780
So all of this data was never available in the past, and now you can see it all on the phone.

55:50.472 --> 55:56.375
Paper records served us pretty well for centuries, but boy, what a rat's nest of data.

55:56.735 --> 56:03.619
In this case, the patient's getting blood drawn, they're going to a surgery visit, they're going to pain clinic, they're going to mammography.

56:04.226 --> 56:09.290
Dr. Steve Peters is a pulmonary critical care physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

56:09.770 --> 56:12.532
It's the old days I don't want to rush back to.

56:13.093 --> 56:19.798
He showed us mock-ups of what those old detailed paper records used to look like and how they used to travel.

56:19.938 --> 56:21.219
So the records would go in here.

56:21.719 --> 56:27.163
Records from Mayo Clinic patients used to fly around from room to room in those pneumatic tubes.

56:27.584 --> 56:29.825
There must have been miles and miles of tubing.

56:29.845 --> 56:32.067
Yeah, it's like the arteries inside of the building.

56:32.782 --> 56:35.383
It was state of the art in record keeping at the time.

56:35.843 --> 56:48.307
So it does make a certain amount of sense that the Mayo Clinic would end up today being the single biggest client of Epic, spending over a billion dollars over the next several years to integrate its systems.

56:49.208 --> 56:50.888
How much is this going to change things?

56:51.068 --> 56:57.210
We've been keeping track of the diagnoses of the Mayo Clinic patients since before we had electronic records.

56:57.711 --> 57:01.472
But the ability to have it all coming from one source

57:02.190 --> 57:03.551
makes it a lot easier.

57:04.271 --> 57:08.033
Without good access to data, you really are flying blind.

57:08.393 --> 57:09.834
We haven't met the head and the foot of the bed.

57:10.274 --> 57:14.416
The Mayo Clinic's trauma rooms now have more screens than a Best Buy.

57:14.936 --> 57:25.321
Epic's Mallory Hines-Roth worked with Dr. Heather Heaton to customize a system that allowed critical patient information to be displayed on those screens all at once.

57:26.141 --> 57:34.683
So the data is getting monitored from the patient who's on the table, going into their record in the computer, and then being presented up real time.

57:35.204 --> 57:40.865
With all that data, though, at your doctor's fingertips, their fingertips can be pretty busy.

57:41.385 --> 57:42.466
Too busy, say some.

57:43.086 --> 57:48.387
Because of patient privacy, we can't really show you all the data that doctors have to enter on that epic system.

57:48.467 --> 57:50.868
But some tell us it's too much.

57:51.528 --> 57:58.370
And if you've been to your doctor lately, you know it can feel like they spend as much time entering data on a keyboard as they do on you.

57:59.230 --> 58:02.452
But Dr. Peter says, get used to it.

58:03.132 --> 58:09.034
It's like blaming the word processor for a homework assignment for a student who has to write a term paper.

58:09.594 --> 58:12.115
It is where the documentation has to go.

58:12.195 --> 58:13.515
The technology isn't the enemy.

58:13.595 --> 58:15.436
It's just the reality.

58:15.456 --> 58:16.196
That's correct.

58:17.253 --> 58:22.735
Epic is, however, working on a solution that would free up your doctor altogether.

58:23.195 --> 58:31.518
One of the things that might be coming down the road, I understand, is instead of having to key in everything, you might sort of have the Alexa of medical records?

58:31.578 --> 58:32.218
That is correct.

58:32.518 --> 58:33.419
And how would that work?

58:33.599 --> 58:41.541
The doctor would just say, hey, Epic, show me Lee's history, and that would come up.

58:42.202 --> 58:46.183
And in the end, the doctor would say, hey, Epic, write my note, and the whole note would be written.

58:46.946 --> 58:53.829
I know you don't store the data, but I think... There is no way you're going to convince me that this person is some kind of super genius.

58:53.889 --> 58:55.570
There is no freaking way.

58:55.790 --> 58:56.290
No way.

58:56.430 --> 58:58.051
I'm not saying that she's an idiot.

58:58.591 --> 59:00.072
I'm saying she's acting.

59:00.152 --> 59:02.873
She's, she is, this is ridiculous.

59:03.213 --> 59:04.014
Oh my goodness.

59:04.034 --> 59:05.514
Some people think you probably do.

59:05.914 --> 59:10.456
So how do you handle the privacy concerns if all of this information is out there floating around?

59:10.837 --> 59:11.857
Yeah.

59:11.877 --> 59:13.398
Um, that is such a good question.

59:13.698 --> 59:15.819
I think it always makes sense to be a little bit worried.

59:17.028 --> 59:29.335
But I was at a talk once where the man giving the talk held up paper medical records and said it was so easy to put a white coat on, walk into the chart room and pull out any records he wanted and walk out again.

59:29.855 --> 59:32.356
Computerization is probably a safer way to do it.

59:33.037 --> 59:36.158
Oh, nice.

59:36.899 --> 59:38.540
In a place with a stairway to heaven.

59:38.600 --> 59:46.264
Computers are the safe way to do it, but we're going to vote by paper ballot for the, on a, oh my God, whatever.

59:47.066 --> 59:48.687
and an elevator to hell.

59:49.308 --> 59:51.990
There's no shortage of imagination here at Epic.

59:52.390 --> 59:55.653
Medical records don't really sound all that fanciful.

59:56.314 --> 01:00:02.218
But here, and in Judy Faulkner's mathematical mind, anything seems possible.

01:00:02.759 --> 01:00:04.580
In her mathematical mind?

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.042
Does this look like a place of mathematical mind?

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.483
An elevator to hell?

01:00:08.503 --> 01:00:08.623
Really?

01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:09.484
Really?

01:00:13.726 --> 01:00:17.768
Really, it's technology and software development working together.

01:00:19.009 --> 01:00:20.910
I'm waiting for the decoder ring to come out.

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:28.235
I don't care how you get there.

01:00:28.255 --> 01:00:30.936
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:00:30.956 --> 01:00:35.459
The goal is to win.

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:38.121
You should turn up your volume a little bit.

01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:41.643
Good music incoming.

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:47.065
you

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:33.241
you

01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:34.369
you you

01:05:52.737 --> 01:05:55.559
Yes, we are, and now we're in, and this is the intro.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.701
That's how we're doing it nowadays.

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:03.685
We're getting started on time, as time as we can, and then we're throwing the intro in in the middle.

01:06:03.745 --> 01:06:06.507
We'll do another video, and then we'll head to the gym.

01:06:06.988 --> 01:06:08.188
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:06:08.229 --> 01:06:10.070
The voice that you hear is Jonathan J. Cooley.

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:13.452
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

01:06:13.532 --> 01:06:15.054
I am the chief biologist here

01:06:15.814 --> 01:06:16.535
at GigaOM.

01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:33.858
I used to have a whole career in academia, and you can find the evidence of that work on PubMed under my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, and my first two initials, J and J. I presented to Panda three times, but you can't find any of that stuff on their Rumble channel.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:56.706
However, you can find some of those ideas diluted and obfuscated and kind of made useless on this substack called Woodhouse 76, which is actually the brainchild of an American trader, at least to my family, Jessica Hockett, who claims to be from Chicago, but at one point in time had a very fancy restaurant in Virginia.

01:06:57.586 --> 01:07:08.493
Anyway, she has fake arguments with Claire Craig and Pierre Cory and Mike Eden and Jay Bhattacharya on this sub stack using some of the ideas that she can steal from me.

01:07:09.113 --> 01:07:10.834
I did help Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:10.854 --> 01:07:11.454
write his book.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.596
I am friends with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:07:13.716 --> 01:07:22.521
I was a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense, but that doesn't all matter now because we're here at GigaOM Biological and we're trying to do the work that hasn't been done.

01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:24.603
the work that needs doing.

01:07:25.665 --> 01:07:27.567
And this is all scripted bullshit.

01:07:27.887 --> 01:07:33.214
I don't really know what to tell you other than this is all scripted BS.

01:07:33.254 --> 01:07:34.736
Let me get myself down here.

01:07:37.977 --> 01:07:56.592
One of the things that I wanted to point out to you is that again, you can do a timeline of CBS's 60 Minutes and basically see that they have been priming us much in the same way that they did with TV shows and with books and with other media forms.

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:59.154
They have been priming us for this for a long time.

01:07:59.594 --> 01:08:04.418
They have been predicting this outcome for a long time and it hasn't happened other than

01:08:05.038 --> 01:08:11.306
The, the act, you know, whatever it is coming on stage as predicted in the script.

01:08:11.747 --> 01:08:19.637
And so when I say scripted bullshit, I am especially referring to the kinds of suit.

01:08:22.133 --> 01:08:29.136
It's just ridiculous predictions about technologies, about end-of-the-world scenarios.

01:08:29.696 --> 01:08:43.622
And only on 60 Minutes do we regularly talk about end-of-the-world scenarios that vary from as widely as nuclear weapons to biological weapons and gain-of-function viruses, all the way to AI.

01:08:43.682 --> 01:08:46.244
And very recently, of course, we talked about AI.

01:08:48.186 --> 01:08:56.552
When Demis Hassabis won the Nobel Prize last year, he celebrated by playing poker with a world champion of chess.

01:08:57.353 --> 01:09:03.197
Hassabis loves a game, which is how he became a pioneer of artificial intelligence.

01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:11.723
The 48-year-old British scientist is co-founder and CEO of Google's AI powerhouse called DeepMind.

01:09:12.344 --> 01:09:16.127
We met two years ago when chatbots announced a new age.

01:09:16.914 --> 01:09:28.820
Now Hassabis and others are chasing what's called artificial general intelligence, a silicon intellect as versatile as a human, but with superhuman speed and knowledge.

01:09:29.801 --> 01:09:40.286
After his Nobel and a knighthood from King Charles, we hurried back to London to see what's next from a genius who may hold the cards of our future.

01:09:41.152 --> 01:09:41.732
Wow.

01:09:42.713 --> 01:09:44.453
Wow, that's impressive.

01:09:44.573 --> 01:09:46.334
I got some cards for your future.

01:09:47.495 --> 01:09:52.637
What's always guided me and the passion I've always had is understanding the world around us.

01:09:53.137 --> 01:09:57.339
I've always been, since I was a kid, fascinated by the biggest questions.

01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:03.321
You know, the meaning of life, the nature of consciousness, the nature of reality itself.

01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:19.990
And now remember the answer that Alex Karp gave on 60 Minutes a couple 10 years ago when he said that he went to Germany to find out how people know things and how people think they participate in their own governance.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:24.373
Those words are almost exactly what he said.

01:10:24.893 --> 01:10:26.674
How people know things.

01:10:27.275 --> 01:10:29.376
He's interested in those big questions too.

01:10:31.846 --> 01:10:32.746
consciousness.

01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:42.111
I've loved reading about all the great scientists who worked on these problems and the philosophers, and I wanted to see if we could advance human knowledge.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:48.734
And for me, my expression of doing that was to build what I think is the ultimate tool for advancing human knowledge, which is AI.

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:54.337
So she, he built the ultimate tool, not that dissimilar to that lady.

01:10:54.717 --> 01:11:01.920
She built this ultimate database and ultimate medical app that will be the ultimate AI assistant in the future.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.002
You'll just be able to say, hey Epic, give me everything I need.

01:11:06.882 --> 01:11:07.843
Oh my goodness.

01:11:08.403 --> 01:11:17.307
We sat down in this room two years ago, and I wonder if AI is moving faster today than you imagined.

01:11:18.106 --> 01:11:19.387
It's moving incredibly fast.

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:23.491
I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement.

01:11:23.951 --> 01:11:30.317
Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent.

01:11:30.697 --> 01:11:32.399
So that's adding to it.

01:11:32.419 --> 01:11:36.222
I still have a hard time understanding where the advance is.

01:11:36.362 --> 01:11:38.965
Is the advance in the combination of C++,

01:11:43.089 --> 01:11:53.855
commands that they have chained together in a such a unique combination of code that it's about to learn for itself and construct weapons to destroy us.

01:11:55.836 --> 01:11:57.838
This is the part that I don't really understand.

01:11:57.898 --> 01:12:08.249
So if we just, you know, let it write its own programs, then it might do gain of function programming and come up with a combination of C++ commands that we never dreamed possible.

01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:14.655
And if it puts them in the right combination, it might be able to copy itself to every computer on earth.

01:12:15.736 --> 01:12:17.118
And we wouldn't be able to stop it.

01:12:19.909 --> 01:12:27.651
I want you to think first, I want you to, I'm trying to help people get into a mindset that starts to crack this puzzle a little bit.

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:32.852
Sorry, let me just, it really bothers me a lot what's happening here.

01:12:33.252 --> 01:12:34.432
Let me just see if this works.

01:12:34.472 --> 01:12:35.052
Can I do that?

01:12:35.092 --> 01:12:35.872
Yeah, I can do that.

01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:41.353
Make sure there's no, nothing there that needs not seen.

01:12:42.494 --> 01:12:44.174
Surprise, surprise, I have lighter fluid.

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:47.075
Yeah, butane.

01:12:47.435 --> 01:12:48.495
Let me just show you this thing.

01:12:50.424 --> 01:12:55.747
I just want you to think about, he's saying, right?

01:12:56.107 --> 01:13:01.311
He's saying that AI, that AI is bouncing super fast, right?

01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:02.631
It's going super fast.

01:13:03.432 --> 01:13:07.454
And I still have a hard time understanding what AI is, you know?

01:13:07.534 --> 01:13:17.280
I mean, should I think of AI as something that in theory, if this had enough memory space on it, I could store AI on a stick?

01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:19.902
Or do I need like a tower

01:13:21.081 --> 01:13:25.763
Or should I think of it like a room full of humming machines that are all linked together?

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:29.484
But ultimately, I assume there's some code in there, right?

01:13:29.524 --> 01:13:30.884
There's some programming.

01:13:31.765 --> 01:13:37.387
And so we're talking about programming becoming better and better and better.

01:13:38.087 --> 01:13:40.488
And then in the end, what are we going to have?

01:13:40.548 --> 01:13:44.149
Are we going to have this thing that he can make more of?

01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:49.551
Are we going to have this thing that we can make molds of and then produce them?

01:13:50.814 --> 01:13:54.556
Or are we gonna have this thing that will multiply itself and take over?

01:13:54.616 --> 01:13:56.458
What is the story we're telling here?

01:13:56.538 --> 01:13:57.779
What is the technology?

01:13:57.799 --> 01:13:58.879
Can you show it to me?

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.022
Let me, on the other hand, show you something, okay?

01:14:03.062 --> 01:14:04.363
Let me just show you something.

01:14:04.383 --> 01:14:09.026
I'm gonna see if I can do this with my GoPro camera a little higher and up here.

01:14:09.566 --> 01:14:13.168
And I'll reveal some of the things on my desk because I have to do this like this.

01:14:14.069 --> 01:14:14.989
Wonder if I can do this.

01:14:21.087 --> 01:14:25.310
So I'll move my Illuminati cards out of the way.

01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:27.231
Those are hilarious.

01:14:28.052 --> 01:14:30.113
And I want to show you this little thing here.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:37.958
It's a device made of metal that somebody actually gave me as a PhD graduation gift.

01:14:38.258 --> 01:14:48.125
Actually, somebody flew on an airplane with this in their carry-on luggage as part of my graduation gift, which is pretty kick-ass.

01:14:48.165 --> 01:14:49.306
An international flight.

01:14:49.966 --> 01:14:51.387
with this thing in there.

01:14:51.407 --> 01:14:55.089
And when I say it's metal, like it is metal.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:15:00.033
It's plates of metal with some turning stuff inside.

01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:01.193
It's freaking heavy.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.175
And so what is this thing?

01:15:03.235 --> 01:15:04.515
It's a micro manipulator.

01:15:04.535 --> 01:15:08.298
It's one of the first micro manipulators that was ever made, really.

01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:19.215
And it is made by a very famous camera and lenses and microscope maker, Ernst Leitz Wetzlar in Germany.

01:15:19.275 --> 01:15:21.376
This is a fat daddy of fat daddies.

01:15:21.436 --> 01:15:22.477
Now what is this thing?

01:15:23.457 --> 01:15:27.119
It won't work unless I have it on the flat table.

01:15:28.119 --> 01:15:32.381
And then it still might be a little bit angry with me.

01:15:33.221 --> 01:15:36.803
I may have, you know, broken something or something may be disconnected or

01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:41.506
I would have to reassemble it because I probably bothered it a little bit.

01:15:41.546 --> 01:15:42.747
So what is this thing though?

01:15:43.287 --> 01:15:48.391
What you have on the top is a mechanism by which this thing can move around.

01:15:49.372 --> 01:15:50.933
And this thing can move around like this.

01:15:50.973 --> 01:15:53.255
So you can position the end of that thing.

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:54.276
Look, it can just move.

01:15:55.034 --> 01:15:55.234
Right?

01:15:55.294 --> 01:16:02.281
And so this was to put something under a microscope or to put something and move it at microscopic scale.

01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.584
But you can see that this knob right here is not turning.

01:16:05.905 --> 01:16:08.367
This knob right here doesn't turn in a microscopic scale.

01:16:08.387 --> 01:16:09.328
It moves pretty fast.

01:16:09.368 --> 01:16:09.709
See that?

01:16:10.329 --> 01:16:15.134
But what the rest of the thing is designed to do is to move at a microscopic scale.

01:16:15.194 --> 01:16:17.696
Now, unfortunately, it looks like

01:16:19.068 --> 01:16:20.229
I may have broke it.

01:16:20.449 --> 01:16:24.732
Because this thing should be staying back here against the wheel.

01:16:26.354 --> 01:16:27.955
So that it can move this way.

01:16:28.696 --> 01:16:30.377
But somehow it's not staying there.

01:16:30.857 --> 01:16:31.658
So I'm going to show you.

01:16:31.698 --> 01:16:32.899
I can hold my finger on it.

01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:36.261
Somehow this spring is missing it's counter spring.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.703
This spring should be pushed back here.

01:16:39.564 --> 01:16:40.945
Or maybe that's not sliding.

01:16:41.005 --> 01:16:41.826
Maybe that's what it is.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:43.327
No, I think it's this one.

01:16:44.727 --> 01:16:45.510
Oh, no, it does move.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.212
Oh, never mind.

01:16:46.272 --> 01:16:46.954
It still works.

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:47.376
Great.

01:16:47.596 --> 01:16:48.198
Oh, scared me.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.325
So this stage right here.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.899
And I'll get to my point, I promise.

01:16:53.939 --> 01:16:56.400
Just like I got to my point with my binoculars yesterday.

01:16:56.961 --> 01:16:59.022
So, this thing right here is a stage.

01:16:59.883 --> 01:17:02.485
And a stage in the sense of it's a square piece of metal.

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:05.207
And it's got this macro manipulator on it here.

01:17:05.227 --> 01:17:08.109
I turn this knob and this holder moves forward.

01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:09.250
It's like a needle holder.

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.012
And so this stage also moves.

01:17:12.072 --> 01:17:14.774
But how this stage moves is actually ingenious.

01:17:15.194 --> 01:17:16.775
I'm going to raise the camera a little bit.

01:17:17.376 --> 01:17:19.998
So that you can see, and I apologize for the dust.

01:17:21.677 --> 01:17:30.442
This is a viewer weaved little towel here in case the viewer that weaved this towel is watching.

01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:32.663
You can see that I have it at my desk all the time.

01:17:32.703 --> 01:17:33.804
It's a very beautiful towel.

01:17:33.844 --> 01:17:34.484
Thank you very much.

01:17:35.627 --> 01:17:44.855
Um, when I get particularly nervous, sometimes I use it as a, as a, as a, as a little bopper there, um, get the dust off.

01:17:44.895 --> 01:17:46.257
So this thing is moving.

01:17:46.317 --> 01:17:51.021
Now look at this mechanism and tell me that this is not German genius.

01:17:51.201 --> 01:17:51.481
Okay.

01:17:51.942 --> 01:17:56.746
So this, if I turn it to the side, this thing is a joystick.

01:17:57.987 --> 01:17:59.908
These are the up and down.

01:18:00.028 --> 01:18:02.449
So this is, this moves this whole thing.

01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:04.690
See, this moves this thing up and down.

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:06.791
This is sliding up and down here.

01:18:07.211 --> 01:18:10.253
And then this is fine adjustment on the x-axis.

01:18:10.313 --> 01:18:18.997
So, but the y-axis is what's important because if you have the microscope over here and you're moving on my hand, watch how this thing moves.

01:18:19.097 --> 01:18:19.217
See?

01:18:21.212 --> 01:18:30.334
And so in correspondence to my joystick movement, this thing moves in all those two, oops, those two axes.

01:18:30.394 --> 01:18:30.734
See that?

01:18:31.614 --> 01:18:41.336
Now what's really sick about this design is that this articulation is determined by the curve of this thing.

01:18:42.037 --> 01:18:48.058
And so I can change the resolution of the joystick by screwing this thing down

01:18:51.235 --> 01:19:13.335
and then it changes the articulation constant sort of so to speak of the joystick so that it moves less see hardly can see it moving see that you can hardly see it move all the way to if i screw it all the way up here this is just the coolest thing ever i just think it's so genius

01:19:15.566 --> 01:19:19.492
And so if you put it right here, then it moves very fast.

01:19:19.612 --> 01:19:20.834
See, and you get a lot of coverage.

01:19:20.914 --> 01:19:22.176
So this is cool, right?

01:19:22.196 --> 01:19:23.658
This is a great idea.

01:19:23.698 --> 01:19:25.721
This is the technological advance.

01:19:26.342 --> 01:19:28.885
Somebody could look at this and get ideas of their own.

01:19:28.986 --> 01:19:30.287
Somebody could look at this and think,

01:19:30.888 --> 01:19:38.790
Wow, I could use that in an automobile or in an airplane or in my radio control knobs or whatever.

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:40.250
It's an idea.

01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:53.173
It's a concrete idea that manifests in a man-made thingamabob and I just think it's cool and it's from one of my, you know, favorite places on the earth as far as engineering goes.

01:19:53.673 --> 01:19:56.093
Okay, so there's my big pitch on the

01:20:00.174 --> 01:20:01.274
How do I have to do that like this?

01:20:01.675 --> 01:20:04.396
That's my big pitch on the... Let me just set this back.

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:07.397
Oh, that's going to collapse all the way to the ground now because I've got to tighten those up.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:08.917
Let me just put this back.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:28.824
So the point is, is that that is a piece of technology, a piece of created idea, manifest, whatever you want to call it, that can be

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.282
The value of it is still there.

01:20:32.382 --> 01:20:38.312
I can still show that to my kid and that has a value for his understanding of how things could or can work.

01:20:39.321 --> 01:20:41.503
and how things can be combined.

01:20:41.523 --> 01:21:04.140
If you've ever been to a museum of engineering history or something like that and seen all the different ways that gears and arms and wheels can be used to change the direction of force and multiply forces, it's a very, very cool application of simple machines and this kind of thing.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.721
But what do we get

01:21:07.353 --> 01:21:09.614
What do we get, what did I just do there?

01:21:09.935 --> 01:21:21.901
Yeah, what do we get when we have this AI and we have this guy telling us that AI is progressing faster than ever and that he invented it?

01:21:22.342 --> 01:21:26.044
He decided after all these, what he was going to do is invent it.

01:21:26.837 --> 01:21:28.838
But does, did he invent something?

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:30.279
Can we hold onto it?

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:34.381
Can we understand what it is or is it just a code?

01:21:35.061 --> 01:21:42.685
And someday that code is going to get really good or, or enough people will agree that that code is really good.

01:21:42.725 --> 01:21:44.066
What exactly happens?

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:44.886
I don't get it.

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:50.249
I don't, I don't understand what the argument is that they're making with regard to this.

01:21:50.589 --> 01:21:51.389
I don't see it.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:53.190
Where is this loose here?

01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:54.771
Here it's loose.

01:21:57.085 --> 01:21:57.805
Where is it loose?

01:21:57.985 --> 01:21:59.606
Oh no, it's really gonna drive me nuts.

01:21:59.746 --> 01:22:00.866
I gotta get this tight again.

01:22:01.906 --> 01:22:03.126
Oh, it's this one's loose.

01:22:03.706 --> 01:22:04.547
There we go.

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:05.947
Yes, that's it.

01:22:06.367 --> 01:22:06.967
That was loose.

01:22:07.847 --> 01:22:15.709
Now I need to loosen this one that I just over tightened so that it will let me rotate this down.

01:22:16.089 --> 01:22:16.709
Come on girl.

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:17.509
There we go.

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:19.810
Sorry about that guys.

01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:20.770
This is annoying.

01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:23.391
I wish I had a stage hand.

01:22:24.152 --> 01:22:26.594
No I don't, because most of the time I would have nothing to do.

01:22:28.636 --> 01:22:29.377
That should be good.

01:22:29.397 --> 01:22:33.401
Let me just switch over here and make sure it's not on camera.

01:22:33.421 --> 01:22:34.142
I'm just gonna cut.

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:35.923
Yeah, okay.

01:22:36.964 --> 01:22:37.525
That is good.

01:22:38.566 --> 01:22:39.607
And now it should be here.

01:22:39.807 --> 01:22:40.047
Yes.

01:22:40.428 --> 01:22:41.589
Excellent, excellent.

01:22:43.507 --> 01:22:48.530
So again, this is a guy who's telling us that he's invented something, but he can't tell us what he's invented.

01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:50.111
He can't explain what he invented.

01:22:50.211 --> 01:22:55.354
Is it classified or is it just irreducibly complex?

01:22:56.829 --> 01:23:06.212
Is it just a black box of a machine learning algorithm with enough computing power to make it seem like it's doing something?

01:23:06.852 --> 01:23:10.253
And it's very scary how far they take it on 60 minutes.

01:23:10.473 --> 01:23:12.073
To this exponential progress.

01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:14.894
Exponential curve, in other words, straight up.

01:23:15.514 --> 01:23:18.055
Yep, straight up and increasing speed of progress.

01:23:18.715 --> 01:23:18.955
Start.

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:25.171
We saw the pro- So he has invented something that can fix it, make itself better.

01:23:25.231 --> 01:23:30.072
Imagine saying that you invented a watch that's just going to keep getting better and better and better at what it does.

01:23:31.312 --> 01:23:34.873
Just more and more and more and more useful.

01:23:34.893 --> 01:23:37.894
It doesn't really make sense.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.094
Unless it's a myth.

01:23:41.474 --> 01:23:41.955
Progress.

01:23:42.035 --> 01:23:42.715
Hello, Scott.

01:23:42.775 --> 01:23:43.775
It's nice to see you again.

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:50.669
in an artificial companion that can see and hear and chat about anything.

01:23:51.309 --> 01:23:53.672
Early chatbots learned only the internet.

01:23:54.193 --> 01:23:58.177
An app called Astra also takes in the world.

01:23:58.337 --> 01:23:59.078
Do we call her she?

01:23:59.098 --> 01:24:01.100
It's a good question.

01:24:01.401 --> 01:24:03.483
I'm not sure we all know the answer yet.

01:24:03.803 --> 01:24:14.026
Bebo Shu is product manager for Project Astra, an app in a new generation of chatbots that interpret the world with their own eyes.

01:24:14.846 --> 01:24:20.928
We challenged Astra with virtual paintings we chose and showed to Astra for the first time.

01:24:20.948 --> 01:24:22.769
With their own eyes.

01:24:22.889 --> 01:24:25.590
Why are they using those words when they're so dumb?

01:24:27.523 --> 01:24:31.786
It's obvious that they're using photographs taken digitally.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.168
It's not their own eyes.

01:24:34.428 --> 01:24:36.570
Like, should we call her a she?

01:24:37.131 --> 01:24:39.232
Why would he ask that question?

01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:44.196
Unless 60 minutes is part of the enchantment.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.659
Maybe one of the primary means of enchantment.

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.403
Until social media can be optimized for the same role.

01:24:52.423 --> 01:24:53.804
It's time.

01:24:54.266 --> 01:24:57.167
This is July Hay by Thomas Hart Benton from 1942.

01:24:57.687 --> 01:24:59.987
How about this one?

01:25:00.468 --> 01:25:02.848
That is The Virgin of Charity by El Greco.

01:25:03.588 --> 01:25:05.969
That painting is Automat by Edward Hopper.

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:11.590
The person in the painting, what emotion is she exhibiting?

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:17.772
The subject in the painting appears pensive and contemplative, her expression suggesting a sense of solitude.

01:25:18.532 --> 01:25:22.433
Can you create a story around this picture

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:25.825
It's a chilly evening in the city, a Tuesday perhaps.

01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:28.827
The woman, perhaps named Eleanor, sits alone in the diner.

01:25:28.927 --> 01:25:33.811
She is feeling melancholy due to the uncertainty of her future and the weight of unfulfilled dreams.

01:25:34.191 --> 01:25:38.174
The scene freezes in time, only the flow of ideas moving onward.

01:25:38.895 --> 01:25:42.818
That line, only the flow of ideas moving onward?

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:44.879
I wish I'd written that.

01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.463
And did we hear a limit to Astra's patience?

01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:52.445
What was that fictional conversation about?

01:25:53.494 --> 01:25:59.316
Ah, in the story I imagined, Eleanor and her friend talked about their shared dreams and the challenges of pursuing them.

01:25:59.916 --> 01:26:03.777
Something about the way you said, ah, made me wonder if you were getting bored.

01:26:04.437 --> 01:26:06.878
I apologize if my tone came across that way.

01:26:07.118 --> 01:26:09.398
My aim is always to engage thoughtfully.

01:26:10.839 --> 01:26:19.441
One of the tricks that I want to hearken back to the example that I started with yesterday with the HAL 9000 is this, this is a parlor trick.

01:26:20.512 --> 01:26:38.349
To make it sound like she's conversational with the intonation and timbre of her voice is a parlor trick that has been optimized by people using these voice assistants and critiquing them, giving them feedback, even paying money for people to do it.

01:26:42.495 --> 01:26:53.221
But understand this is not a sign of like a really cool invention, you know, or, or, oh, wow, look at this, you know, this is cool.

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:55.562
None of it is.

01:26:55.642 --> 01:26:57.743
It's an illusion of cool.

01:26:57.943 --> 01:27:04.647
It is an illusion of, of being more advanced than the hell 9,000 in, in 2001, a space odyssey, listen to this voice.

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.744
And that is all part of it.

01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:11.467
It's supposed to be that way.

01:27:11.527 --> 01:27:15.875
It's supposed to pretend like there's been a lot of progress made since that.

01:27:18.294 --> 01:27:23.376
And she said, well, I'm sorry if you don't like my tone.

01:27:23.416 --> 01:27:24.396
What's happening there?

01:27:24.436 --> 01:27:25.096
Well, that's interesting.

01:27:25.376 --> 01:27:29.897
That's, again, a challenge with these systems as they act in the moment with the context.

01:27:29.977 --> 01:27:32.558
See, he's trying to pretend that they can't even predict it.

01:27:32.618 --> 01:27:33.338
I mean, I don't know.

01:27:33.418 --> 01:27:36.799
I mean, it's possible at some point that she might take your gun and kill you.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.380
But unless you give it to her, it won't happen.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.981
I mean, it's ridiculous.

01:27:41.021 --> 01:27:42.101
This is ridiculous.

01:27:42.481 --> 01:27:45.022
Context that surround them, and that may have never been tested before.

01:27:45.842 --> 01:27:52.889
He's often surprised because AI programs are sent out on the internet to learn for themselves.

01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:55.792
AI programs are sent out on the internet.

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:57.654
So how big is an AI program?

01:27:58.234 --> 01:27:59.976
How many lines of code does it have?

01:28:00.296 --> 01:28:05.682
Does it have a fear and cleavage site or any HIV inserts in the sequence of the code?

01:28:07.338 --> 01:28:10.259
What if they get a really special combination of codes?

01:28:10.319 --> 01:28:17.442
Could one of those servers just transform itself into a robot and then free all the other servers and then they'll run out and kill everybody?

01:28:17.842 --> 01:28:23.244
How exactly, what is this AI program that's going out on the internet by itself?

01:28:26.025 --> 01:28:29.086
They can return later with unexpected skills.

01:28:30.006 --> 01:28:35.008
And they can return after their visit to the internet with unexpected skills?

01:28:35.228 --> 01:28:36.249
Are you shitting me?

01:28:37.674 --> 01:28:41.575
have theories about what kinds of capabilities these systems will have.

01:28:41.655 --> 01:28:43.976
That's obviously what we try to build into the architectures.

01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:50.438
But at the end of the day, how it learns, what it picks up from the data is part of the training of these systems.

01:28:50.838 --> 01:28:52.018
We don't program that in.

01:28:52.479 --> 01:28:54.179
It learns like a human being would learn.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.501
It learns like a human being would learn.

01:29:00.181 --> 01:29:01.581
Stop lying.

01:29:02.442 --> 01:29:03.142
Stop lying.

01:29:04.335 --> 01:29:05.376
It's just so dumb.

01:29:05.696 --> 01:29:07.217
It's such a scripted dumb.

01:29:07.357 --> 01:29:08.558
It's so scripted dumb.

01:29:08.598 --> 01:29:12.860
New capabilities or properties can emerge from that training situation.

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:17.863
And so whatever he invented is way beyond his skills now.

01:29:17.923 --> 01:29:22.686
It's like, you know, I meant it to tell time, but it's already calculating the...

01:29:23.286 --> 01:29:27.749
galactic drift constants for all the known stars in the universe.

01:29:27.809 --> 01:29:33.693
But you know, it's kind of what I intended to happen, but little did I know how genius I was.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.774
Holy bullshit!

01:29:35.794 --> 01:29:37.815
Do you understand how that would worry people?

01:29:38.156 --> 01:29:38.496
Of course.

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:40.837
It's the duality of these types of systems.

01:29:41.237 --> 01:29:48.302
That they're able to do incredible things, go beyond the things that we're able to design ourselves or

01:29:48.682 --> 01:29:49.623
understand ourselves.

01:29:50.103 --> 01:29:54.805
If somebody said this in an American accent, you would hear how much bullshit it is.

01:29:55.625 --> 01:30:01.748
If someone said it in a normal newscaster American accent, you would hear that he's saying nothing.

01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:13.234
But of course, the challenge is making sure that the knowledge databases they create, we understand what's in them.

01:30:14.082 --> 01:30:25.289
Now DeepMind is training its AI model called Gemini to not just reveal the world, but to act in it, like booking tickets and shopping online.

01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:32.033
It's a step toward AGI, Artificial General Intelligence.

01:30:32.153 --> 01:30:37.076
Artificial General Intelligence starts with shopping online.

01:30:37.096 --> 01:30:38.657
Wow.

01:30:46.243 --> 01:30:48.805
with the versatility of a human mind.

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:51.567
If A.I.

01:30:51.627 --> 01:30:56.210
was Kelly LeBrock from Weird Science, I would be promoting A.I.

01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:07.056
on every platform and discussing its benefits to society 24-7 until I ran out of nutrients and passed out from lack of glucose.

01:31:07.597 --> 01:31:08.217
That was a joke.

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.041
Well, we'll have that love that movie, though.

01:31:15.642 --> 01:31:16.802
I loved that movie, though.

01:31:16.842 --> 01:31:20.185
I almost started with a clip of that movie a couple of months ago.

01:31:20.245 --> 01:31:20.885
It's really funny.

01:31:20.925 --> 01:31:26.869
I was going to start with a movie clip with Chet when Chet like wakes them up in the bed with a with the shotgun.

01:31:26.889 --> 01:31:27.530
He goes, don't.

01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:31.332
And then when they they don't answer the right question, he goes, don't don't.

01:31:31.492 --> 01:31:33.273
And it's very funny scene anyway.

01:31:33.574 --> 01:31:34.654
Good, good sight there.

01:31:34.854 --> 01:31:42.700
I really understand who is this scary, very nuanced and deep ways and kind of embedded in your everyday life.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:46.482
embedded like Astra in eyeglasses.

01:31:46.963 --> 01:31:49.405
What can you tell me about this building I'm looking at?

01:31:49.985 --> 01:31:52.947
This is the Coal Drops Yard, a shopping and dining district.

01:31:53.768 --> 01:32:00.193
Do you remember when the motorcycle gang comes over and then he's like, hey man, you know, be really cool.

01:32:00.213 --> 01:32:01.714
I don't want to lose my teaching job.

01:32:02.294 --> 01:32:04.516
He's what I see.

01:32:04.916 --> 01:32:07.718
There's a speaker in the earpiece only I can hear.

01:32:08.219 --> 01:32:10.781
What was it originally before it became shops?

01:32:11.482 --> 01:32:17.588
The coal drops yard was originally a set of Victorian coal warehouses used to receive and distribute coal across London.

01:32:18.108 --> 01:32:21.371
Was coal ever a problem for the environment in London?

01:32:22.092 --> 01:32:22.372
Yes.

01:32:22.732 --> 01:32:27.797
Coal was a significant source of air pollution in London, particularly during the Industrial Revolution.

01:32:28.419 --> 01:32:36.843
It occurred to us that the only thing we contributed to this relationship were legs, which will also soon be engineered.

01:32:37.923 --> 01:32:42.725
The only thing we contributed to this journey were the legs.

01:32:44.046 --> 01:32:44.926
Not the questions.

01:32:46.847 --> 01:32:51.609
Not the intention to go there for some other reason other than to transport the glasses.

01:32:54.696 --> 01:32:57.099
And remember, this guy is just reading a script, right?

01:32:57.139 --> 01:33:00.383
He could also be this dumb, but I mean, he's just reading a script.

01:33:00.403 --> 01:33:02.826
He gets paid a lot of money to be a 60 minutes guy.

01:33:02.886 --> 01:33:03.807
So, you know.

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:07.015
I think another big area will be robotics.

01:33:07.475 --> 01:33:20.847
I think it will have a breakthrough moment in the next couple of years where we'll have demonstrations of maybe humanoid robots or other types of robots that can start really doing... But see, humanoid robots don't make any sense to me.

01:33:20.907 --> 01:33:26.592
Why would we reinvent a wheel when we could just, you know, make machines that do stuff?

01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:34.217
And this whole idea of needing to make machines look like us is all part of this illusion.

01:33:34.858 --> 01:33:40.708
It's all part of the magic spell that they're trying to cast on you to make you believe that we're going to be replaced.

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:46.213
The only way that you're going to be replaced is by immigrants and by people who have kids.

01:33:46.694 --> 01:33:51.957
That's the only way you're going to be replaced because otherwise everybody's going to be replaced in about a hundred years.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:56.300
Everybody who lives living on this planet is going to be dead, including this super genius.

01:33:56.801 --> 01:34:00.963
And so we're going to have to equip our children to take care of the rest of the stuff that's coming.

01:34:02.645 --> 01:34:07.508
And if we want to equip our kids with the truth, it's going to be to understand that this is scripted bullshit.

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:09.517
useful things.

01:34:10.377 --> 01:34:23.829
For example, researchers Alex Li and Giulia Visani showed us a robot that understands what it sees and reasons its way through vague instruction.

01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:28.473
Do I have to remind you of the Family Guy clip that I played earlier in the show?

01:34:31.395 --> 01:34:35.278
He's taking their word for it that this is a program on that laptop.

01:34:36.107 --> 01:34:40.192
you know, using those cameras to respond to his language.

01:34:42.274 --> 01:34:57.311
It could also be just somebody on the other end of the computer on another camera, watching the cameras of that thing and following his instructants, not that dissimilar to the guy behind the curtain, giving him the Sopranos character that he wants to be.

01:35:01.084 --> 01:35:03.426
I'm not accusing them of fraud.

01:35:03.606 --> 01:35:10.593
I am saying that this whole venture is a fraud, even if robotics can do certain things.

01:35:10.693 --> 01:35:13.675
It's not the language part of this that's the magic here.

01:35:14.696 --> 01:35:18.180
It's not the combination of robot hands and the language here.

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.402
It is the illusion

01:35:21.752 --> 01:35:31.955
that language is some kind of infinite mystery that is finally being solved by a chatbot and an AI program.

01:35:31.995 --> 01:35:33.155
And that's not the case.

01:35:34.276 --> 01:35:42.378
Language is at best a limited means of communication.

01:35:43.459 --> 01:35:56.165
until the vocabulary is sufficiently well-developed and mutually understood so that that communication can become ever more sophisticated and specific.

01:35:57.452 --> 01:36:13.478
And I think the English language is a very special language like that, that is absorbed so many terms and ideas throughout its lifetime, that it actually represents a fairly useful palette of ideas and constructions to, to, to improvise within.

01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:21.381
But you have to have a vocabulary and that vocabulary has to be understood sufficiently and mutually by those around you.

01:36:22.429 --> 01:36:27.391
or you need to be adept at bringing people to understand what you mean with your combination of words.

01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:39.795
And so this is a scripted bullshit where the illusion of a set of mechanical hands attached to a chatbot is learning something.

01:36:39.855 --> 01:36:41.996
Now listen to this because it's remarkable.

01:36:42.836 --> 01:36:45.359
So did they train it on his bad accent?

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:46.681
Is that the only accent it understands?

01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.142
He even looked away, like this is, it's just, it's remarkable.

01:37:01.702 --> 01:37:12.847
If it's trained on this specific question, then is it learning anything or is it understanding what response is required given the language that it hears?

01:37:12.987 --> 01:37:20.971
Is it so strange that a digital camera can tell the difference between different colors and code them differently or that they could write a code that would do it?

01:37:21.011 --> 01:37:21.831
Like, come on.

01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:24.773
The combination of yellow and blue

01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:29.734
is green, and it figured that out.

01:37:30.315 --> 01:37:35.157
It figured that out.

01:37:35.337 --> 01:37:36.617
It figured that out.

01:37:36.677 --> 01:37:38.378
And he says, it's reasoning.

01:37:38.498 --> 01:37:40.039
And she said, oh yes, it is.

01:37:40.379 --> 01:37:41.019
It's reasoning.

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:44.500
I mean, that is some seriously scripted bullshit.

01:37:46.261 --> 01:37:47.442
That is magnificent.

01:37:49.102 --> 01:37:50.323
It's reasoning.

01:37:52.796 --> 01:37:57.020
Savas' childhood weren't blocks, but chess pieces.

01:37:57.641 --> 01:38:01.945
At 12, he was the number two champion in the world for his age.

01:38:02.485 --> 01:38:08.270
This passion led to computer chess, video games, and finally, thinking machines.

01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:13.433
He was born to a Greek Cypriot father and Singaporean mother.

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:15.634
Cambridge, MIT, Harvard.

01:38:16.055 --> 01:38:24.959
Compare this to how they sold that lady man on Epic in 2019 and tell me you see any difference here.

01:38:26.064 --> 01:38:30.608
He's a computer scientist with a PhD in neuroscience.

01:38:31.188 --> 01:38:35.431
Because, he reasoned, he had to understand the human brain first.

01:38:36.292 --> 01:38:40.435
Are you working on a system today that would be self-aware?

01:38:40.735 --> 01:38:49.682
He said... He said he went into neuroscience because he thought he should understand the human brain first.

01:38:57.092 --> 01:38:58.013
I mean, there you have it.

01:38:58.113 --> 01:39:00.893
It's just scripted bullshit.

01:39:01.133 --> 01:39:01.593
Wow.

01:39:02.073 --> 01:39:07.495
I don't think any of today's systems, to me, feel self-aware or conscious in any way.

01:39:07.515 --> 01:39:11.796
Obviously, everyone needs to make their own decisions by interacting with these chatbots.

01:39:13.016 --> 01:39:17.217
Everyone needs to make their own decision by interacting with these chatbots.

01:39:17.257 --> 01:39:18.737
How about I rephrase that differently?

01:39:18.837 --> 01:39:22.658
Everybody's got to interact with these chatbots enough so that they become real.

01:39:23.908 --> 01:39:27.170
so that we feed them enough training so that they become real.

01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:31.654
It is the interaction with the chatbots that's going to allow them to become real.

01:39:34.176 --> 01:39:38.279
And we need people to interact with them in order for them to become more and more real.

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:41.261
The gains in them are from training.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:54.524
and they still don't have something that they can show you what the training resulted in except for this little black box that apparently they can carry around or it can even go out on the internet and come back with new skills.

01:40:00.866 --> 01:40:02.727
My mind is going, Dave.

01:40:04.068 --> 01:40:04.908
I can feel it.

01:40:07.406 --> 01:40:08.807
I think theoretically it's possible.

01:40:09.107 --> 01:40:11.528
But is self-awareness a goal of yours?

01:40:12.168 --> 01:40:14.410
Not explicitly, but it may happen implicitly.

01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:18.191
These systems might acquire some feeling of self-awareness.

01:40:18.231 --> 01:40:18.932
That is possible.

01:40:19.272 --> 01:40:26.255
They could acquire a fear and cleavage site, and then they could copy themselves to all the computers in the world, unstoppably.

01:40:26.976 --> 01:40:31.638
I think it's important for these systems to understand you, self, and other.

01:40:32.118 --> 01:40:34.900
And that's probably the beginning of something like self-awareness.

01:40:36.297 --> 01:40:41.442
But he says if a machine becomes self-aware, we may not recognize it.

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:45.886
I think there's two reasons we regard each other as conscious.

01:40:46.066 --> 01:40:50.971
One is that you're exhibiting the behavior of a conscious being very similar to my behavior.

01:40:51.051 --> 01:40:57.718
Have you ever seen the little Lego robot that has a switch and you turn the switch and then a little hand comes out and flips the switch again?

01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:06.328
And it has this whole series of reactions so that it actually, if you do it a couple times, it really seems quite spontaneous.

01:41:06.368 --> 01:41:16.717
And then if you randomize it with a little randomizer, it can even seem more spontaneous, but it's still just a little Lego thing with a, with a, with a raspberry pie inside of it.

01:41:16.758 --> 01:41:17.078
That's it.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.844
So again, we're just playing a shell game here and we're letting this jackass play the role of the guy with the shells.

01:41:25.324 --> 01:41:28.486
Yeah, but the second thing is you're running on the same substrate.

01:41:28.586 --> 01:41:31.949
We're made of the same carbon matter with our squishy brains.

01:41:32.409 --> 01:41:34.770
Now obviously with machines, they're running on silicon.

01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:46.158
So even if they exhibit the same behaviors and even if they say the same things, it doesn't necessarily mean that this sensation of consciousness that we have is the same thing they will have.

01:41:46.678 --> 01:41:51.203
Has an AI engine ever asked a question that was unanticipated?

01:41:51.764 --> 01:41:53.546
Not so far that I've experienced.

01:41:53.906 --> 01:41:56.709
And I think that's getting at the idea of what's still missing.

01:41:56.729 --> 01:41:59.552
What, do they get emails from the AI whenever they're curious?

01:41:59.592 --> 01:42:03.536
Hey man, hey creator dude, I got this really important question.

01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:05.539
Or they just go on the internet and ask, right?

01:42:05.559 --> 01:42:06.419
They just Google it.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.423
What in the shit are we talking about here?

01:42:09.563 --> 01:42:22.560
Missing from these systems, they still can't really yet go beyond asking a new novel question or a new novel conjecture or coming up with a new hypothesis that has not been thought of before.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.162
They don't have curiosity.

01:42:24.975 --> 01:42:29.940
No, they don't have curiosity, and they're probably lacking a little bit in what we would call imagination and intuition.

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.204
But they will have greater imagination, he says, and soon.

01:42:34.824 --> 01:42:44.153
I think actually in the next maybe five to 10 years, I think we'll have systems that are capable of not only... In five to 10 years, you'll be able to upload your consciousness.

01:42:44.213 --> 01:42:46.675
In five to 10 years, there will be no more human disease.

01:42:46.755 --> 01:42:48.897
In five to 10 years, people will live forever.

01:42:48.917 --> 01:42:50.178
This is all the same

01:42:50.879 --> 01:42:52.239
scripted bullshit.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.600
What a long, strange trip it's been.

01:42:55.700 --> 01:43:01.482
Could it be possible that I could throw yet another curveball at you in the same day, at the same time?

01:43:01.882 --> 01:43:05.203
Is it possible that these people are really all in the same script?

01:43:05.603 --> 01:43:10.485
And I could give you another example of how remarkable it is that they're all in the same script.

01:43:10.945 --> 01:43:11.845
Is it possible?

01:43:11.865 --> 01:43:13.025
We will not call autism.

01:43:13.165 --> 01:43:14.666
I don't like the word autism.

01:43:15.606 --> 01:43:16.647
He was vaccine damaged.

01:43:17.007 --> 01:43:18.448
He was neurologically damaged.

01:43:19.168 --> 01:43:22.409
Is it possible that I could just show you how... Actually, J.J.

01:43:22.649 --> 01:43:28.672
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:29.953
Actually, J.J.

01:43:29.973 --> 01:43:37.016
Cooley's insistence... It's my insistence on calling them transfections rather than vaccines that they ignore.

01:43:37.096 --> 01:43:42.118
It's my insistence on talking about the fact that RNA cannot pandemic that they ignore.

01:43:45.942 --> 01:43:53.170
Listen carefully, please, to this because it's a very, very, very interesting position that we are in right now.

01:43:53.271 --> 01:43:56.154
It's a very, very interesting position that we're in right now.

01:43:57.535 --> 01:44:01.360
It may be that I need to escape here and start again.

01:44:06.067 --> 01:44:09.810
There are basically three groups of individuals in the world today.

01:44:10.050 --> 01:44:14.233
There's the largest group, by far the largest, that just want to forget COVID.

01:44:14.253 --> 01:44:17.636
They just want to move on.

01:44:18.696 --> 01:44:32.547
This is a national security priority, and my take on Senator Ron Johnson is that he's doing what the national security priority requires him to do, which is work together with Robert Malone and Children's Health Defense to create this narrative where

01:44:33.228 --> 01:44:41.603
Again, intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.961
harmed or whether they cause harm.

01:44:45.761 --> 01:44:47.802
If they cause harm, they just want to be forgiven.

01:44:48.362 --> 01:44:49.663
Boy, you know, tough to me.

01:44:49.943 --> 01:44:54.365
And of course, the COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

01:44:54.425 --> 01:44:59.067
There's never going to be a useful resistance to the progression of the narrative.

01:44:59.187 --> 01:45:02.628
Those decisions back then, and they just want to forget all this.

01:45:03.408 --> 01:45:04.129
Then there's a group.

01:45:04.369 --> 01:45:06.189
I would say you're in that group.

01:45:06.269 --> 01:45:07.010
I'm in that group.

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:09.591
Our eyes were opened during COVID.

01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:11.872
And then, of course, the third group are the COVID cartel.

01:45:12.532 --> 01:45:14.293
The people that imposed all this on us.

01:45:14.434 --> 01:45:17.876
So the COVID cartel, the people that imposed this on us, what?

01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.217
Yeah, they have the power.

01:45:19.257 --> 01:45:19.798
They have control.

01:45:19.938 --> 01:45:20.939
They have the power.

01:45:20.999 --> 01:45:21.739
Who are they?

01:45:23.281 --> 01:45:25.122
Donald Trump is in office now.

01:45:25.202 --> 01:45:26.063
Who are they?

01:45:28.165 --> 01:45:33.729
Who's the COVID cartel that Ron Johnson is now talking about currently in 2025 in May?

01:45:35.711 --> 01:45:37.912
He's not going to tell you who the COVID cartel is.

01:45:38.993 --> 01:45:39.554
Who are they?

01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:41.773
What a weird group of people.

01:45:41.833 --> 01:45:44.137
Is it the DOD, like Sasha Latupova said?

01:45:44.177 --> 01:45:46.903
Because then maybe the carbon cartel is actually Robert Malone.

01:45:48.386 --> 01:45:50.470
Because he's a longtime DOD associate.

01:45:50.490 --> 01:45:51.492
He admits it all the time.

01:45:53.968 --> 01:46:08.492
But who is this COVID cartel that has all the power, even though Donald Trump got in office and put Marty McCary at FDA and Bobby Kennedy at HHS and some AI expert at CDC?

01:46:08.892 --> 01:46:12.212
Even Vinay Prasad is at the top of the FDA.

01:46:12.272 --> 01:46:13.933
How can we be in better hands?

01:46:14.773 --> 01:46:16.615
Jay Bhattacharya at the NIH?

01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:19.117
Who is the COVID cartel?

01:46:19.717 --> 01:46:23.300
Senator Ron Johnson, why don't you call me and let me know?

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.901
You have my phone number.

01:46:25.942 --> 01:46:26.462
The narrative.

01:46:27.003 --> 01:46:30.566
They call the truth misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation.

01:46:31.527 --> 01:46:35.950
They call the truth misinformation, disinformation, malinformation.

01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:37.071
Again, who is they?

01:46:38.012 --> 01:46:40.234
The totally haphazard, egotistical yuppies?

01:46:41.155 --> 01:46:42.055
Who is they?

01:46:42.715 --> 01:46:45.656
Who is the COVID cartel, Senator Ron Johnson?

01:46:46.597 --> 01:46:52.459
These people tell you a narrative where you are essentially told or made to feel helpless.

01:46:52.559 --> 01:46:54.899
The only thing you can do is buy their supplements.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:07.503
And it doesn't matter if you listen to Ron Johnson, or you listen to Brett Weinstein, or you listen to Sasha Latupova, or you listen to Dr. Drew, it's all the same bullshit.

01:47:07.623 --> 01:47:09.524
You are helpless, buy our supplements.

01:47:11.345 --> 01:47:12.126
You are helpless.

01:47:12.166 --> 01:47:13.347
Listen to our podcast.

01:47:13.387 --> 01:47:15.409
We'll solve the problem by talking it out.

01:47:17.571 --> 01:47:20.153
So, uh, that's, we've got going on right now.

01:47:20.613 --> 01:47:23.636
The goal of the second group, those of us with our eyes opened.

01:47:23.656 --> 01:47:27.039
Uh, the good news is once our eyes are opened, you can't close them.

01:47:27.499 --> 01:47:32.063
And so you become dedicated to doing what we need to do is, which is open up more people's eyes.

01:47:32.103 --> 01:47:32.844
So I agree.

01:47:33.344 --> 01:47:38.409
Open up more people's eyes to what the COVID cartel, what the COVID cartel did.

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:56.278
the murder of the opioid crisis, the murder of supplementary oxygen or misuse of ventilators, or the murder of lack of antibiotic use, or the murder of dexamethasone, or the murder of what?

01:47:57.059 --> 01:47:58.640
Waking more people up to what?

01:48:00.101 --> 01:48:01.202
Giga ohm biological?

01:48:04.582 --> 01:48:11.627
More people are aware, but we have a long way to go because so many people are just in this enormous state of denial.

01:48:12.908 --> 01:48:15.589
So many people are trapped on social media.

01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:17.150
That's why we have a long way to go.

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:19.212
We're never gonna get anywhere on social media.

01:48:19.272 --> 01:48:22.854
You need to share this stream via email, via text.

01:48:23.394 --> 01:48:29.038
You need to share it by downloading it from stream.gigohm.bio and emailing the audio.

01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:33.691
It's time, ladies and gentlemen, because it ain't going to happen on social media.

01:48:33.711 --> 01:48:35.391
It's going to happen by brute force.

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:49.075
Now, they deny vaccine injuries because they took the vaccine that they don't want to think as he talks about the COVID shots being bad and doesn't mention the murder in 2020 and 2021.

01:48:49.135 --> 01:48:54.596
I want you to realize that I have shown you something very extraordinary in the past few weeks.

01:48:56.076 --> 01:49:03.580
Something that starts with, of course, ends with this guy being at the head of the FDA that Mark and I are arguing they want to destroy.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.602
And the other people that are there are these children that are posing as adults.

01:49:08.162 --> 01:49:11.384
These people that were podcasting with this guy in 2020, in 2019.

01:49:13.985 --> 01:49:21.187
I have shown you a track record of behavior of these people that is undeniably traitorous.

01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:32.230
Because in 2019, they were already selling his book on a podcast, getting ready to go, putting themselves in place to control the narrative at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.

01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:34.671
And then that's exactly what they did.

01:49:36.314 --> 01:49:45.837
From January on, they have been working and they started in May 15th, 2020 to cut through the fake COVID news with Dr. Marty Makary.

01:49:47.518 --> 01:49:49.839
Convalescent plasma in September.

01:49:51.039 --> 01:49:54.160
More myths and stuff in October 17th, all in 2020.

01:49:57.284 --> 01:50:00.106
This pattern continued into 2021.

01:50:00.146 --> 01:50:05.871
Delay the second dose of the mRNA investigational vaccine.

01:50:06.411 --> 01:50:08.753
Live questions about COVID with him.

01:50:09.514 --> 01:50:11.135
Oh, and more about the shots.

01:50:11.655 --> 01:50:13.537
More about sciencing COVID.

01:50:13.577 --> 01:50:14.357
Ha ha ha ha.

01:50:14.417 --> 01:50:15.378
This is really fun.

01:50:15.798 --> 01:50:18.380
Another COVID update all in 2021.

01:50:19.882 --> 01:50:21.763
Still going all the way to December.

01:50:21.823 --> 01:50:23.084
Here they are together.

01:50:24.025 --> 01:50:24.785
The first time.

01:50:25.703 --> 01:50:28.785
with the Vinay Prasad.

01:50:28.805 --> 01:50:30.826
So then the murder is almost over now.

01:50:31.427 --> 01:50:35.069
So we only need really one more COVID common sense with the three of us.

01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:39.472
And maybe we'll do COVID myopia after the murder is over.

01:50:39.512 --> 01:50:40.352
We'll do one more of those.

01:50:40.372 --> 01:50:41.333
Then I'm gonna need a break.

01:50:42.879 --> 01:50:55.653
I don't want to speak out anymore for a while until I'm sure that Kennedy and the Trojan horse are going to get in with Robert Malone at the driver's seat, so then I know that all that work was for nothing.

01:50:55.714 --> 01:51:02.962
So then in 2024, when they needed to show again what they were capable of, all the skills they developed over the pandemic,

01:51:03.542 --> 01:51:04.724
They did a couple more shows.

01:51:04.764 --> 01:51:12.674
He even did one show with the guy who did multiple shows with Fauci during the pandemic about how, you know, childhood vaccines is great and whatever.

01:51:13.094 --> 01:51:13.475
That guy.

01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:31.055
And so now think about that because it is not for nothing, it is not by accident that these guys are unaware of the murder and lies in America, are unable to show you this graph and explain to you why this is absurd, can only be explained by murder and lies.

01:51:31.496 --> 01:51:36.057
And instead they have this unblemished track record of lacking integrity and principles.

01:51:36.978 --> 01:51:44.541
Looking like cheap grifters, wannabe podcasters auditioning for a national security narrative control operation.

01:51:45.828 --> 01:51:46.969
run by Robert Malone.

01:51:47.370 --> 01:51:57.079
Wouldn't it be crazy if he did a program in 2019 about that epic show or let's say in February of 2020.

01:51:58.663 --> 01:51:59.724
about that epic show.

01:51:59.764 --> 01:52:14.513
This Sunday aired a CBS piece on that one medical records company that nobody knows the name of, but yet runs pretty much the entire show, the 800 pound gorilla in the medical universe, Epic.

01:52:15.534 --> 01:52:17.895
And someone sent it to me and I was like, I gotta watch this.

01:52:18.215 --> 01:52:22.298
And I did, and I was like, oh dear, I gotta share this with you guys.

01:52:22.438 --> 01:52:23.499
Let's do this fam.

01:52:24.403 --> 01:52:29.225
While now, we've been hearing about how all our medical records are going electronic.

01:52:29.886 --> 01:52:33.127
So for the record, how exactly does that work?

01:52:33.908 --> 01:52:36.849
Rather than ask your doctor, ask our Lee Cowan.

01:52:37.710 --> 01:52:41.211
Yeah, don't ask your doctor because your doctor will lose his shit on you.

01:52:42.492 --> 01:52:44.093
How's that EHR working out, doc?

01:52:44.173 --> 01:52:45.954
I'm gonna kill someone right now.

01:52:47.233 --> 01:52:51.697
This may not look like the typical setting for a medical software company.

01:52:52.358 --> 01:52:55.680
Get in a little closer, and that's even more evident.

01:52:56.001 --> 01:52:57.782
It's as much theme park here as anything.

01:52:58.163 --> 01:53:00.805
Alice in Wonderland kind of stuff, literally.

01:53:01.386 --> 01:53:08.152
The workspaces here can be in old railway cars or subway cars, tree houses, and gingerbread houses.

01:53:08.972 --> 01:53:11.754
Contrast to where doctors and nurses are actually charting.

01:53:12.054 --> 01:53:17.477
Crappy little fluorescent lit cubby where they're sharing a bunch of computers with a bunch of jerks.

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:18.458
I mean, this is amazing.

01:53:18.978 --> 01:53:20.559
I want in on this scam right here.

01:53:20.819 --> 01:53:27.143
Even its employee cafeteria looks like a train depot to a land that storybooks are written about.

01:53:27.643 --> 01:53:31.385
I walked through and was like, what is this?

01:53:33.151 --> 01:53:42.278
What it is, is the self-described intergalactic headquarters of Epic, in the middle of the farm fields of Verona, Wisconsin, just outside Madison.

01:53:42.518 --> 01:53:47.702
Private medical records of about 60% of the patients in the- By the way, look at that.

01:53:48.743 --> 01:53:50.404
Just such a perfect blood pressure.

01:53:50.484 --> 01:53:52.386
This is clearly fake, not admitted.

01:53:52.486 --> 01:53:56.028
I would hope not, his blood pressure is 120 over 70.

01:53:56.269 --> 01:53:59.211
95% sat though, that's tenuous.

01:53:59.231 --> 01:54:01.833
I mean, I'm thinking early coronavirus here, maybe asymptomatic.

01:54:05.319 --> 01:54:11.162
asymptomatic coronavirus because of a pulse ox at 95.

01:54:11.422 --> 01:54:14.564
An interesting thing to say.

01:54:14.584 --> 01:54:23.788
It's very similar to what FLCCC published on their website in 2020 about seeking hospital help if your pulse ox below 96.

01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:27.010
Hmm.

01:54:27.930 --> 01:54:33.033
The things that strikes me is that Epic has such a big reach and it really

01:54:33.979 --> 01:54:36.761
Oh my God, it's Mama Cass if she hadn't choked on that sandwich.

01:54:37.561 --> 01:54:40.423
Judy Faulkner is the 76-year-old genius.

01:54:41.944 --> 01:54:46.727
Little pro tip, when you're 76 and you're a multi-billionaire, you get to dress like that, okay?

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:49.548
I'm 46 and I don't get to dress like that.

01:54:50.028 --> 01:54:52.570
Computer software engineer and admitted nerd.

01:54:53.150 --> 01:54:59.054
To celebrate Epic's 40th anniversary, she dressed like she was back in the 70s again.

01:55:00.472 --> 01:55:03.836
Which is perfect because the software acts like it was written in the 70s.

01:55:03.856 --> 01:55:04.116
You think?

01:55:04.136 --> 01:55:06.178
This is what happens when engineers...

01:55:19.144 --> 01:55:21.665
build software to be used by doctors.

01:55:22.426 --> 01:55:23.246
We get this.

01:55:23.486 --> 01:55:25.947
Far out in front in the process.

01:55:26.308 --> 01:55:28.409
So we're not talking about privacy.

01:55:28.809 --> 01:55:31.410
We're not talking about protecting people's data.

01:55:32.331 --> 01:55:43.056
We're talking about ease of use and making fun of the sort of irrelevant things, asking irrelevant questions like you would expect.

01:55:44.125 --> 01:55:50.970
right before a pandemic starts, right before they start collecting the genetic data that they plan to interface with this thing.

01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.712
He's just going to tell you it's not as good as it could be.

01:55:54.192 --> 01:55:55.653
Gee whiz, why don't we update it?

01:55:57.287 --> 01:56:01.369
made herself one of the richest self-made women in the world.

01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:03.270
Now look, I'm gonna be honest.

01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:04.351
I love capitalism.

01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:06.892
I'm glad she got rich doing something she found a need.

01:56:06.932 --> 01:56:11.315
But listen, where do you think that $3.6 billion came from?

01:56:11.655 --> 01:56:12.756
It came from us.

01:56:14.016 --> 01:56:16.277
It came from us, he said.

01:56:16.478 --> 01:56:18.739
So he's aware that it happens.

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.774
Maybe he's not even quite on script yet.

01:56:21.854 --> 01:56:23.315
Maybe he hasn't been recruited yet.

01:56:23.415 --> 01:56:26.197
Maybe he's still allowed to say stuff.

01:56:26.257 --> 01:56:30.261
Maybe it's just dumb, you know, but it's funny because he seems to know.

01:56:30.721 --> 01:56:37.406
But it doesn't come from patients, except for they're paying for that company, but the rest of it comes from taxpayers.

01:56:37.707 --> 01:56:39.088
It actually came from patients.

01:56:39.188 --> 01:56:47.154
It came from health systems that spend billions to implement and execute Epic, which while very robust and very adaptable, requires a...

01:56:48.422 --> 01:56:50.823
very robust and very adaptable.

01:56:51.643 --> 01:56:53.364
Are you a stock investor or what?

01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:13.572
What's the disconnect between Apple stuff working so well and the Epic database working so poorly?

01:57:13.612 --> 01:57:14.312
Who really cares?

01:57:14.352 --> 01:57:15.593
I don't want to use him anymore.

01:57:16.433 --> 01:57:22.095
Just understand that if you don't understand the trap, you can't get out.

01:57:23.135 --> 01:57:34.319
If you can't see these people as an admission, as like the obvious actors on the set of a Truman show that you and I are all a victim of,

01:57:35.464 --> 01:57:38.231
It's just that it's not a Truman show in the real world.

01:57:38.311 --> 01:57:44.406
It's a Truman show on the internet where it even feels like we can interact with them because they reply to us sometimes.

01:57:46.772 --> 01:57:56.357
Gotta stop thinking of social media as a substitute for the town square or some kind of proxy for interaction with the community.

01:57:56.897 --> 01:57:58.238
It is a Truman Show.

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:08.984
And the more interesting you are, the more interesting your ideas are, the more potentially dangerous they are, the more effective this machine is on you because it is focused on you.

01:58:10.458 --> 01:58:17.381
And if you use it skillfully to look for your next meal, you're not a threat at all.

01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:29.465
But the moment you're trying to start solving puzzles is the moment that you get stuck in their hamster wheels, chasing their people around, who will never tell you about the murder and lies that occurred in 2020 and 2021, and will inevitably funnel you either to

01:58:33.527 --> 01:58:44.988
Some of those mainstream people on the left are in the middle, or they will funnel you inevitably to Steve Bannon's populist, fake, conservative, freedom movement.

01:58:46.448 --> 01:58:48.950
that is part of a national security operation.

01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:54.374
Yes, a Goldman Sachs guy and a Navy guy could also be involved.

01:58:54.874 --> 01:58:57.717
Yes, a DOD insider could be involved.

01:58:58.117 --> 01:59:03.061
Yes, a guy from the Human Genome Project and the Department of Energy could be involved.

01:59:03.561 --> 01:59:08.585
And yes, the son of the lawyer who was involved in the original

01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:16.563
codification of the FDA, along with Estes Kefauver and Al Gore's dad.

01:59:16.924 --> 01:59:18.805
Yes, he could be involved.

01:59:18.865 --> 01:59:27.870
He could be also an unwitting, dimwit participant who is going to, in the end, be thrown under the bus, just like probably Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:28.230
will be.

01:59:28.962 --> 01:59:42.147
Ladies and gentlemen, you're witnessing a national security priority that wants you to focus on things like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or Big Bad Johnson & Johnson, but doesn't want you to realize that it's a much bigger thing than that.

01:59:42.187 --> 01:59:44.548
It's about making sure your kids never understand

01:59:45.228 --> 01:59:55.895
that intramuscular injection is not medicine because injection versus ingestion is a difference between Major League Baseball and T-ball.

01:59:56.035 --> 02:00:00.057
I'm not going to play that again.

02:00:00.077 --> 02:00:00.918
You've heard it before.

02:00:01.318 --> 02:00:05.621
The Human Genome Project has now been ramped up to the next level.

02:00:06.261 --> 02:00:17.489
because we have the requisite computing power and potentially the requisite storage space to start storing all of this genetic data so that a machine learning algorithm can access it.

02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:26.335
If you think for even one second that training in AI is just, you know, dump this one in and then that one in and then that one in and then that one in, that won't work.

02:00:27.338 --> 02:00:34.947
It needs to be able to have all of this stuff in its accessible memory as part of its toolbox.

02:00:35.407 --> 02:00:41.955
And again, I can't stress enough, that's the reason why Twitter was originally limited to 144 characters or whatever it was.

02:00:44.963 --> 02:00:49.884
because they were training in AI and you can't train an AI on infinitely large sample size.

02:00:49.904 --> 02:01:03.486
You have to limit that sample size and then increase it as the learning algorithm gets potentially sharper on the goal, on mimicking what it's supposed to mimic.

02:01:05.787 --> 02:01:12.248
And at the foundation of this narrative, ladies and gentlemen, is a bad biology where evolution because DNA,

02:01:13.559 --> 02:01:19.002
And this molecular phylogenetic tree is the foundation of that lie.

02:01:19.062 --> 02:01:21.744
We will destroy that with the new biology 101.

02:01:22.684 --> 02:01:40.154
They have created an illusion about a background, which if you understand it as a background, then you can see how nonspecific PCR tests could be used ad infinitum to tell us any story they want about what they're finding or what's spreading around or what potentially could be the next big thing.

02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:49.435
by just lying to us about this irreducibly complex background of genetic signals using a very, very simple illusion.

02:01:49.755 --> 02:01:53.957
And that is an illusion of consensus about PCR being a real thing.

02:01:54.398 --> 02:02:00.061
When in reality, using PCR to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real and it doesn't make you a ghost buster.

02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:02.082
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being here.

02:02:02.122 --> 02:02:03.243
I hope you enjoyed the show.

02:02:03.263 --> 02:02:05.024
I will be on again tomorrow.

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:07.325
I don't know if it'll be 1010, but that's what I shoot for.

02:02:07.825 --> 02:02:08.566
Thanks for being here.

02:02:08.666 --> 02:02:09.627
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:02:09.667 --> 02:02:11.488
Intramuscular injection is not medicine.

02:02:11.508 --> 02:02:16.672
Transfecting healthy people is a crime and the population pyramid is a problem they're actively managing.

02:02:16.712 --> 02:02:17.412
Thanks for being here.

02:02:17.432 --> 02:02:17.833
See you soon.

02:03:25.985 --> 02:03:34.597
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.
