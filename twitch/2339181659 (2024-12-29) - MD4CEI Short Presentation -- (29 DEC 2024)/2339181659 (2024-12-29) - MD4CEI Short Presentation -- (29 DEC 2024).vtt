WEBVTT

00:24.915 --> 00:29.757
Well, why don't we have the guest who watched it describe it for you?

00:30.458 --> 00:31.378
That'd be probably better.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.159
I'd like to hear it.

00:34.240 --> 00:34.520
Marv?

00:36.641 --> 00:40.463
Oh, well it just tells the story of Papadopoulos and the

00:41.636 --> 00:47.580
The whole scam, the Russiagate scam from start to finish.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.900
It wasn't about the Nixon.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.563
It was about the Russian collusion investigation.

00:52.623 --> 00:53.843
I played a big role in that.

00:54.544 --> 01:02.589
They wanted to, as you know, they wanted to put me in prison because they thought I had a tie to Julian Assange, which I did not have.

01:03.609 --> 01:08.632
And they offered me, they said they'd put me for a jury, put me in prison the rest of my life, jury in Washington.

01:09.193 --> 01:11.214
They would hate me and convict me even if I was innocent.

01:12.065 --> 01:19.149
Or I take their plea deal, admit I had a tie to Julian Assange, which then would have made their Russian collusion case against Donald Trump.

01:19.770 --> 01:30.296
Well, I finally decided that I could not bear swearing to a lie before God and a judge that I had a tie with Julian Assange that I did not have.

01:30.336 --> 01:31.617
So I refused the plea deal.

01:32.257 --> 01:34.599
I told him to get ready to put me in prison the rest of my life.

01:35.379 --> 01:37.861
And I went public with it, wrote a book on it.

01:38.812 --> 01:39.953
And they never indicted me.

01:39.993 --> 01:41.934
In fact, they closed the Mueller investigation.

01:42.694 --> 01:48.418
And so I was dealing with Papadopoulos and Carter Page and the whole group of them, Roger Stone.

01:49.098 --> 01:52.240
I was very deeply involved in the whole Russian collusion investigation.

01:52.260 --> 01:57.984
And I suspect that when we get a new attorney general and we begin to examine those crimes, I'm going to be very involved again.

01:59.309 --> 02:00.972
Because I have testimony against all of them.

02:01.533 --> 02:08.244
I've got specific testimony that could be used in criminal cases against the entire Department of Justice that was involved in it.

02:08.284 --> 02:09.986
I wrote a book on it called coup d'etat.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.673
And it's done quite well.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.253
That book, I think, will sell again.

02:14.273 --> 02:25.397
And we'll be even more deeply getting into the story of the criminal nature of the Russian collusion investigation, which was predicated on a lie.

02:26.097 --> 02:30.599
Because there was no Russian collusion.

02:30.639 --> 02:31.739
It was all fabricated.

02:32.599 --> 02:39.081
And I think that, again, this is the kind of thing that needs to be brought public and will be brought public more in the next bit of time.

02:39.322 --> 02:40.582
I'm very much looking forward to it.

02:42.108 --> 02:43.149
All right, wonderful.

02:43.189 --> 02:44.069
We'll have to move on.

02:44.369 --> 02:45.370
Thank you for that, Jerome.

02:45.410 --> 02:46.090
Thank you, Marv.

02:46.110 --> 02:52.274
So everybody, all the President's men, go and watch it on Netflix or wherever you consume your movies.

02:52.935 --> 02:54.315
JJ, good to see you.

02:54.335 --> 02:56.057
We will start this recording.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.477
Happy Christmas.

02:57.577 --> 03:03.261
As I said, I hope you all had a good Christmas, good Hanukkah, whatever you were celebrating.

03:03.321 --> 03:04.241
It was Christmas.

03:04.842 --> 03:06.363
What was Hanukkah, Charles?

03:06.383 --> 03:07.644
I have no idea what it is.

03:08.804 --> 03:10.265
Oh, well, that's a good opportunity to

03:12.728 --> 03:40.485
to discover it and if we've got time at the end someone will be able to it's the Jewish eight days of celebration so is it on Australian recording in progress just give us a clue it's a Jewish it's a Jewish celebration of Christmas time okay so everybody welcome to Medical Doctors for Covid Ethics International with today's discussion again with JJ Cooey so we had him last week we didn't have a meeting on

03:41.568 --> 03:46.352
on Christmas Eve, UK time, Christmas Day, Australian and other times.

03:46.392 --> 03:50.055
This group was founded by Dr. Stephen Frost over three years ago.

03:50.075 --> 03:54.018
He's a doctor, medical specialty, radiology.

03:54.299 --> 03:56.540
I'm Charles Coves, former lawyer.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.683
I won't do my full scale introduction.

03:59.703 --> 04:05.788
I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever celebration you want.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.311
We're here, we have lots of professions here from all around the world.

04:10.325 --> 04:14.848
If this is your first time here, please feel free to introduce yourself in the chat.

04:16.289 --> 04:23.213
Most of us understand we're in the middle of World War Three and the medical science battle is only one of 12 battlefronts of this World War Three.

04:23.673 --> 04:38.242
Someone has put in the chat already that King Charles, to quote the wonderful Susan, that he wrote a memo that individual country sovereignty should be abolished and a universal government for the

04:38.524 --> 04:40.245
The World Economic Forum should be established.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.125
There you are, everybody.

04:41.485 --> 04:42.946
That's more than we are, really.

04:43.026 --> 04:43.886
One world government.

04:46.127 --> 04:48.968
So, there's no time for us to be tired.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.308
Look after your health.

04:50.348 --> 04:51.269
Be ready for the fight.

04:51.289 --> 04:54.450
We're four and a half years into a seven-year war.

04:54.610 --> 04:59.752
ISSB will probably go on much longer than that in lots of elements, but that's what we do here.

05:00.112 --> 05:03.813
Most of us understand the development of science, and the science is never settled.

05:03.853 --> 05:07.595
Anyone who tells you it's settled, as Michael Crichton says, reach for your wallet.

05:08.789 --> 05:10.510
Some of us believe that viruses exist.

05:10.530 --> 05:13.591
Some of us believe that viruses are a hoax and some of us are on the fence.

05:14.131 --> 05:17.052
And many of us think that debating that issue is a waste of time.

05:17.132 --> 05:19.693
And many of us think that we are negligent to not debate that issue.

05:19.713 --> 05:20.293
So there you are.

05:20.773 --> 05:21.714
We have lots of different views.

05:21.734 --> 05:29.076
I had a meeting on the weekend from one of my very intelligent, allegedly experienced business colleagues.

05:29.557 --> 05:32.197
And he said that Trump is going to destroy America.

05:32.237 --> 05:32.878
So there you are.

05:32.898 --> 05:35.018
I scratched my head.

05:35.038 --> 05:36.339
I go, how anybody could think that?

05:37.162 --> 06:00.901
is amazing when Biden and Kamala what they've done over the last four years so there you are that's the value of different opinions this meeting runs for two and a half hours afterwards for those with the time Tom Rodman runs a video telegram meeting Tom puts the links into the chat if you're able to join we will listen to JJ Cooey for as long as JJ wishes to speak and then we have Q&A Stephen Frost

06:02.116 --> 06:05.458
By a long established tradition, ask the first questions for 15 minutes.

06:05.478 --> 06:07.879
This is a free speech environment with appropriate moderating.

06:07.939 --> 06:11.540
Free speech is crucially important in our fight to preserve our human freedoms.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.662
We have a rule here of no ad hominem attacks.

06:15.802 --> 06:18.303
So there's free speech and an ad hominem attack.

06:18.343 --> 06:26.267
An ad hominem attack essentially is what you are saying is wrong versus you are an idiot for saying that.

06:26.947 --> 06:27.607
Quite clear.

06:27.667 --> 06:28.668
It's an attack on the people.

06:29.363 --> 06:33.025
We are given examples every day in government, in Congress, in Parliament.

06:34.085 --> 06:38.267
In Australian Parliament, they attack each other like by the kindergarten children.

06:38.287 --> 06:39.668
It happens all around the world.

06:40.068 --> 06:43.969
This, I don't allow as a moderator, ad hominem attacks.

06:44.230 --> 06:47.551
You can attack an idea, but not the person.

06:48.872 --> 06:50.952
If you're offended by anything, be offended.

06:50.992 --> 06:52.193
We're lovingly not interested.

06:52.583 --> 07:00.646
interested, we reject the offence industry that requires nobody to say anything that may offend another, and we similarly reject the triggering industry.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.607
Don't say something that might trigger someone.

07:03.547 --> 07:06.388
We come with an attitude and perspective of love and not fear.

07:06.749 --> 07:08.049
Fear is the opposite of love.

07:08.089 --> 07:10.110
Fear squashes you and enslaves you.

07:10.770 --> 07:13.271
Love expands you and liberates you.

07:13.311 --> 07:16.892
And the great challenge of the Christian message of love

07:19.105 --> 07:20.766
is loving people who disagree with you.

07:21.367 --> 07:22.427
It's a big challenge.

07:23.168 --> 07:24.549
We disagree with people.

07:24.669 --> 07:26.910
How do you love people who behave that way?

07:27.951 --> 07:30.312
These twice weekly meetings are not just talk fests.

07:30.372 --> 07:42.880
An extraordinary range of actions and initiatives have been generated from linkages made by attendees in these meetings, including Jerome Corsi getting publishing deals or offering publishing deals to people here and lots of other activities.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.283
The meeting is recorded, is uploaded onto the Rumble channel.

07:48.328 --> 07:50.970
And now welcome to our guest presenter again, J.J.

07:51.010 --> 07:51.350
Cooey.

07:51.370 --> 07:55.013
Thank you again, J.J., for giving us your time.

07:55.553 --> 08:02.618
For those who didn't get the invitation, I'll do a quick rundown of J.J.'

08:02.598 --> 08:05.820
's bio for the purposes of the recording.

08:07.001 --> 08:07.481
J.J.'

08:07.461 --> 08:10.003
's website is GigaOM Consulting.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.745
He's a lifelong biologist.

08:12.925 --> 08:13.966
He grew up in northern

08:15.218 --> 08:17.219
What's WI?

08:17.499 --> 08:18.340
Wisconsin.

08:18.360 --> 08:18.660
Thank you.

08:19.581 --> 08:25.103
Catching bull snakes and making plaster casts of bear tracks and fishing for bluegill.

08:25.864 --> 08:29.846
His last faculty position was a member of the research faculty of the University of Pittsburgh.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.324
School of Medicine until 2021.

08:32.384 --> 08:39.850
His research focused on trying to connect structure to function using patch, clamp and optogenetics in the brain.

08:40.170 --> 08:45.195
He's published work in science, natural neuroscience, PNAS and neurons.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.317
His teaching resumes, he's a natural teacher.

08:48.337 --> 08:52.321
His teaching resume started with substitute teaching in Chicago public schools in 1998 at the age of 21.

08:55.013 --> 09:04.695
And in the 26 years since, he's taught neurobiology at university level in countries all around the world, including the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and USA.

09:04.715 --> 09:10.777
He has years of, Jojo has years of experience with academic science, having chased tenure on two continents.

09:10.857 --> 09:14.818
The pandemic exercise forced him to reconsider all that he knew.

09:15.558 --> 09:19.479
Jojo has been trying to share his unique pandemic awakening ever since.

09:21.519 --> 09:21.619
And

09:24.045 --> 09:33.970
JJ is convinced after years of careful study and direct contact with a number of the central actors that the childhood vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise.

09:34.631 --> 09:37.212
This was well known before the pandemic was declared.

09:37.752 --> 09:46.757
The pandemic was a multinational military operation intended to use an expected rise in all-cause mortality across the Western world to create a mythology about gain of

09:47.216 --> 09:52.461
function viruses that could be used to negate national sovereignty and enslave our kids.

09:53.422 --> 09:55.424
As it happens, I totally agree.

09:55.484 --> 10:03.431
I've been engaged in helping parents whose children are being damaged by vaccines in Australia for 14 years.

10:03.631 --> 10:04.972
It is a criminal enterprise.

10:05.032 --> 10:06.754
I call it out as a criminal enterprise.

10:07.233 --> 10:18.438
And I quote Stanley Plotkin, the alleged godfather of children's vaccines in America, who has acknowledged that no vaccine ever in history has been properly tested for safety and efficacy.

10:19.218 --> 10:24.520
JJ, Stephen Frost, thank you again for creating this group and for organising JJ to be with us.

10:25.401 --> 10:28.082
And JJ, we are in your proverbial hands.

10:28.642 --> 10:31.143
Charles, can I just say one thing before JJ starts?

10:31.664 --> 10:35.025
I'm not sure, JJ, whether I've introduced you to Jerome Corsi,

10:35.745 --> 10:39.667
But I think you've got at least one book in you, and he's a publisher.

10:40.127 --> 10:43.248
So if I haven't introduced you, that's a big miss by me.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.589
Sorry about that.

10:45.729 --> 10:46.489
Have I introduced you?

10:46.889 --> 10:50.351
You mentioned him after last week's talk.

10:51.191 --> 10:54.112
JJ, I have watched a couple of your presentations.

10:54.212 --> 10:57.114
And if you want to do a book, just let me know.

10:57.214 --> 10:58.714
You certainly have the material for a book.

10:58.754 --> 10:59.995
And when you're ready, let me know.

11:01.175 --> 11:30.245
Okay, well First of all, let me just start out by saying that the last time that I was here my performance was a little bit subpar especially at the end with questions and Why I in no way shape or form want to try to defend myself here I want to remind everybody that two talks before that the same gentleman was telling us about the 666 in the in the Twitter logo that was on all of our phones and

11:31.060 --> 11:35.522
as part of a 15 minute presentation before I gave my presentation.

11:35.562 --> 11:42.764
So I was kind of, you know, I was already alerted that something weird was going on.

11:42.784 --> 11:50.067
And when he insisted that he had exposed me or something like that, I guess at that stage I reacted very poorly.

11:50.127 --> 11:57.009
But in my own defense, it's very hard to be one of the only people who can see the alien so clearly.

11:57.869 --> 11:59.651
I want to be very clear.

11:59.671 --> 12:04.735
I still have one main message and I want to kind of stick to it.

12:05.496 --> 12:07.378
I'm going to move over to this screen.

12:08.759 --> 12:17.767
I know I just heard Charles say it, but I think it is very likely that there are forces at work that make it

12:18.752 --> 12:21.073
relatively irrelevant who's in the White House.

12:21.153 --> 12:31.239
And even though we cheer for different teams in America, and it really feels like sometimes we're winning and sometimes we're really getting our butt kicked unfairly, that's actually all part of the theater.

12:31.259 --> 12:32.880
And that's what makes it so engaging.

12:34.061 --> 12:44.007
I can't stress enough how I think, especially in America, it's important for all of us to probe this possibility very deeply.

12:45.267 --> 12:46.188
Because if we don't,

12:47.146 --> 12:56.730
and it's true, we will effectively run into their trap at full speed because that's how they're going to run us into the trap in my estimation.

12:57.250 --> 13:09.455
And so one of the guys that's in behind the scenes from the very beginning, last week I tried to encourage everybody that there's a lot of homework for everyone to do because actually all the information is still available on the internet.

13:09.495 --> 13:10.175
You can go back

13:10.655 --> 13:14.437
And you can find the videos and you can find who was saying what, when.

13:14.457 --> 13:19.820
And one of the most interesting characters that slipped my radar for a long time is Steve Bannon.

13:19.840 --> 13:27.724
Steve Bannon basically introduced most of the characters in the pandemic mythology, including Li Min Yan.

13:29.082 --> 13:36.026
including Robert Malone, including a lot of these other places like the Epoch Times and promoting them.

13:36.466 --> 13:41.069
He was on top of the lab leak idea in January 25th.

13:42.789 --> 13:50.992
2020.

13:42.889 --> 13:50.992
That's one of the earliest people to ever enunciate the full theory that the Chinese were having a Chernobyl event.

13:51.032 --> 14:02.377
And it's not by accident, because actually Steve Bannon is probably the accepted godfather of the Q movement in America, which is also a complete nonsense movement.

14:02.917 --> 14:10.223
that is embraced by a lot of people as being a real patriot or patriotic movement, and it's not.

14:10.303 --> 14:19.430
It's the same kind of fake conservative circus on the Internet that Steve Bannon is responsible for coordinating and may indeed

14:20.285 --> 14:23.586
be one of the people responsible for coordinating all of these people.

14:23.646 --> 14:27.328
Remember, he also worked for Goldman Sachs, like Aaron Siri.

14:27.368 --> 14:31.009
He knows how insider trading can be used to create a lot of money.

14:32.089 --> 14:36.691
And then that's another weaponized pile of money that you can use for whatever reason you need to.

14:37.171 --> 14:38.792
So make no mistake about it.

14:38.832 --> 14:40.812
I don't think anybody's gonna come to our rescue.

14:41.453 --> 14:47.295
I actually think that Americans need to rescue America from traitors within.

14:48.175 --> 14:50.437
And that's why we are here.

14:50.617 --> 14:52.179
I outlined this last week.

14:53.059 --> 15:01.927
We are in a very broken state where half of the United States is very convinced that vaccines are the greatest discovery in modern medicine.

15:01.967 --> 15:06.691
And the other half of the United States is at least skeptical, if not full on out.

15:07.271 --> 15:13.176
The trouble is the people that are leading these two sides are both on the same team.

15:13.917 --> 15:37.487
That's the reason why despite being fighting this battle against the vaccines or something to do with vaccines for more than 10 or 15 years, these people that are in front of us haven't usefully progressed their narrative, haven't usefully progressed their language, haven't usefully progressed their legal arguments, and instead we find ourselves here.

15:38.087 --> 15:45.510
where we could have been five years ago, where we were five years ago, where we were 10 years ago in certain people's presentations.

15:46.516 --> 15:55.958
And this is the key to see, because if we were making progress, then anytime somebody said it better, everybody on that team would adopt the language.

15:56.358 --> 16:00.179
Anytime anybody made a significant win, they would adopt the language.

16:00.319 --> 16:08.541
Anytime there was a wait a minute moment, everybody would adopt that new position, but that never happens in the anti-vax movement.

16:08.561 --> 16:13.942
And I think that's one of the overarching signals that you can find that they brought us here.

16:14.762 --> 16:19.609
CHD, ICANN, Heart, Panda, they all brought us here.

16:19.629 --> 16:20.210
They're all

16:21.266 --> 16:25.088
responsible for not making useful progress in five years.

16:25.648 --> 16:31.410
CHD, as I pointed out last week, had the movie vaxxed and the movie vaxxed too.

16:32.071 --> 16:36.212
At the beginning of the pandemic, they could have gone full court press and said, hey, guess what guys?

16:36.232 --> 16:37.833
We've got two movies and they're great.

16:38.273 --> 16:42.815
And they're going to tell you a lot about what you need to know before these new vaccines come out.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.776
But did they do that?

16:44.556 --> 16:46.197
Absolutely not.

16:47.157 --> 16:55.145
not even remotely close to a strategy that would think about, let's say, taking advantage of the opportunity to move the ball forward.

16:55.185 --> 17:06.416
But instead, they took the advantage to put themselves in the forefront while not actually taking a useful position on anything except for health freedom.

17:09.713 --> 17:18.720
Now, I don't know how to explain it too many different ways, but I do know that this needs to be repeated and you need to learn how to repeat this to your family and friends.

17:19.741 --> 17:28.167
The people that are running this show, that think on multi-generational time horizons, they already knew

17:29.269 --> 17:57.454
that the big families after World War II and then the subsequent decline in family size was gonna result in a period of time in the future where we would have a top-heavy population pyramid, and that there would be an increase in all-cause mortality or an increase in end-of-life care necessary, and that could be a budgetary problem, could be a hospital shortage problem, it could be a public health problem.

17:58.775 --> 18:09.997
And they have been planning meticulously how to use this huge opportunity to craft a narrative that would entrap generations to come.

18:12.658 --> 18:21.580
And nobody from CHD, nobody from ICANN, nobody with a book in 2015 about the vaccine schedule has been able to get here yet.

18:23.752 --> 18:31.218
And I would suggest to you, it's not because I am some kind of savant, it's because these people aren't actually trying.

18:31.979 --> 18:40.867
And for the last five years, I have been, as best I can, trying to understand how it is, where we are, and where we're trying to go.

18:41.748 --> 18:49.254
And I tried hard enough so that I got the attention of the biggest players and got my names in the biggest books, and now they all ignore me.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.236
This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.

18:52.918 --> 19:04.504
It's huge because there's very little evidence of what I'm trying to say that you can just see without working at it, without asking the questions yourself.

19:04.544 --> 19:16.589
There's very little evidence you can see because no matter which direction you look on social media, you're going to see a military representation of a set of ideas that will never get you out.

19:17.270 --> 19:19.851
Hamster wheels is what I've been calling them.

19:20.973 --> 19:29.837
And these people on social media are responsible for curating those hamster wheels, maybe even identifying them and amplifying them.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.299
They don't necessarily need to create all of the wrong narratives.

19:34.339 --> 19:43.984
They just need to find people that are very excited about the wrong narratives and give them trinkets to keep them excited about that narrative.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.165
And if they play along, they play along.

19:47.245 --> 19:48.326
It's herding cats.

19:49.915 --> 19:51.937
It's not, it's not herding sheep.

19:53.099 --> 19:56.262
You got to find them doing things and then just keep them doing those things.

19:56.302 --> 19:57.043
That's what they want.

19:57.103 --> 20:07.555
And there is only one chance right now, only one chance where we can still keep our children effectively off of social media and not using it like idiots.

20:08.136 --> 20:10.479
This is the last, this is the last opening.

20:11.522 --> 20:24.370
and Robert Malone, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Mary Holland, and none of these people are at all mentioning in the defense of children's health that we should get our children off of social media.

20:24.430 --> 20:28.192
Now, I understand there's gonna be people in the audience saying, oh, but then what are you gonna do?

20:28.652 --> 20:30.834
You're gonna control age on the internet?

20:31.034 --> 20:33.896
Now Jonathan Cui is advocating for digital ID.

20:34.036 --> 20:34.916
No, I'm not.

20:36.317 --> 20:39.459
I'm advocating for parents to take the phones away from their kids.

20:41.468 --> 20:46.432
I'm advocating for parents to make the decision for their kids not to be on Snapchat.

20:47.632 --> 20:49.233
Not to have a phone to take to school.

20:51.995 --> 20:53.717
I don't need the government to do that for me.

20:53.977 --> 20:59.281
I need adults to wake up and apologize to their kids for ever not realizing how stupid that was.

21:03.083 --> 21:03.944
We have one chance.

21:05.663 --> 21:08.325
And I need everybody to see it as clearly as possible.

21:08.405 --> 21:09.946
This is a population pyramid.

21:09.986 --> 21:12.007
I didn't explain it very well the last time.

21:12.648 --> 21:20.813
There are men on this side, there are females on the pink side, and represented by the horizontal bars are different age groups that you can see here behind me.

21:21.614 --> 21:25.176
And so each age group is composed of five years of lifetime.

21:25.957 --> 21:33.402
And so you can see the large families from World War II moving up the population pyramid as they age.

21:34.454 --> 21:44.520
And what I'm suggesting to you is that the people that rule our world have seen this coming in the Western nations in particular, not in the third world.

21:45.621 --> 21:48.423
That's why Africa doesn't have to worry about COVID.

21:48.463 --> 21:50.484
They don't have this problem to manage.

21:53.346 --> 22:03.452
And it is extraordinary how long I've been saying this particular thing, which is 2021, and then stopped saying it for almost a year and a half because of these people.

22:04.878 --> 22:16.569
coming to my house, signal chats, telegram groups, phone calls, private Zoom meetings, steering committees, full-on jobs that pay $100,000 a year.

22:21.650 --> 22:32.618
They did everything they could to get me to forget about this, to forget about this, and to move on from the biology, instead of saying what I've been saying for almost three years straight.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.100
The protocols were murder.

22:35.860 --> 22:36.981
It's not accidents.

22:37.021 --> 22:38.022
It's not wrong.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.584
It's supplementary oxygen used incorrectly.

22:42.505 --> 22:44.446
It's ventilators used incorrectly.

22:45.147 --> 22:47.108
It's midazolam used incorrectly.

22:47.208 --> 22:50.411
It's antibiotics not used for a viral syndrome.

22:51.877 --> 22:54.840
It's all of those things and they are all murder.

22:54.981 --> 23:04.832
And anybody that was fighting for our grandparents that were murdered or our parents that were murdered should have been calling it murder a long time ago.

23:06.053 --> 23:08.716
Grace was murdered.

23:09.377 --> 23:12.801
Grace Shara was murdered in the hospital.

23:14.170 --> 23:15.630
Gain of function is a mythology.

23:15.670 --> 23:19.831
I think I've been saying that for almost four years, but three years for sure.

23:20.691 --> 23:27.032
And it's an interesting thing that nobody really wants to talk about or acknowledge and just take and make some t-shirts of it.

23:28.253 --> 23:30.973
I don't care, or prove me wrong.

23:32.373 --> 23:40.795
And the reason why they don't wanna talk about that is because gain of function is a mythology, is the perfect way to imply that virology is also a mythology.

23:42.517 --> 23:44.698
It's not a question of whether it's real or not.

23:44.778 --> 23:50.781
It's a question of what it really means, and what those people mean by it, and whether they even understand what they're doing.

23:51.702 --> 23:54.903
So the Scooby-Doo is real, and I'm gonna just make this point for sure.

23:55.463 --> 24:06.769
They tricked us over the last five years into solving a mystery, and that's why now, right now in the United States, both the left and the right are kind of like considering the possibility that maybe China did leak something.

24:09.175 --> 24:13.437
And all it takes is a spectacular commitment from all these people to the lie.

24:15.097 --> 24:18.639
Jessica Rose, Nick Hudson, all of them are committed to the lie.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.621
And you might say, yeah, but those people, those people are all really good.

24:24.681 --> 24:25.202
They're not.

24:27.122 --> 24:27.763
They're not.

24:29.083 --> 24:35.266
I know because even if they say it now, those people could have said it three years ago.

24:36.576 --> 24:54.122
Nick Hudson, remember, just to remind you again, because it's a particularly beautiful data point, has three hour and a half presentations of me from 2022 and 2023 that he could put on the Rumble channel of Panda, but has not.

24:55.402 --> 25:00.264
And I'm probably one of the only people who presented to Panda that doesn't have a video somewhere on Rumble.

25:01.650 --> 25:03.592
And that's not by accident, that's by design.

25:04.292 --> 25:12.900
The same reason why I have pages and pages of direct messaging on Twitter from Jonathan Engler of Heart and Nick Hudson of Panda.

25:14.401 --> 25:15.702
Because they are meddlers.

25:16.282 --> 25:19.385
They take information and they try to dilute it.

25:19.445 --> 25:21.427
They try to pretend like it wasn't yours.

25:21.487 --> 25:25.811
They try to pretend like it's theirs in order to

25:27.156 --> 25:33.561
essentially try to distract from the idea that these things are real, that nobody's saying murder.

25:34.902 --> 25:47.851
Even Nick Hudson is unable to say that they are murdering people because the vaccine schedule around the world is criminal and they need to murder people in order to manage that population pyramid problem.

25:47.931 --> 25:48.812
And think about that.

25:48.872 --> 25:50.273
Nick Hudson is an actuary.

25:50.914 --> 25:56.498
Do you actually believe that Nick Hudson doesn't know that there's such thing as a population pyramid?

25:58.078 --> 26:11.825
You really think Nick Hudson and Danny Rancor and that guy named Dodd who works for the life insurance industry don't know that these graphs exist and didn't know that there was a bump coming?

26:15.807 --> 26:20.269
It's impossible for Nick Hudson the actuary and for

26:21.175 --> 26:31.966
Dodd the actuary and for Denny Rancor, the polymath physicist number cruncher from May 2020, not to know of this signal.

26:32.587 --> 26:33.367
It's impossible.

26:35.049 --> 26:38.693
And the fact that none of them have said it, even though they know I've said it to them,

26:41.147 --> 26:44.750
is evidence that they are collaborating against this mythology.

26:44.830 --> 26:48.694
And so what I am suggesting is that the people that were there are put in place.

26:48.894 --> 26:53.198
Everybody in the no virus group, quite a few of them were put in place.

26:53.298 --> 26:54.559
I mean, look at this.

26:56.261 --> 27:02.887
Tom Cowan had a book in 2018 about vaccines and autoimmunity.

27:02.907 --> 27:02.947
In 2018,

27:06.604 --> 27:14.566
And so think about the possibility that this guy could have just held up his book and said, Hey, look, you know, public health and biology, it's all kind of a lie.

27:15.007 --> 27:18.307
And they're murdering people in the United States in order to cover that up.

27:19.708 --> 27:20.508
But he didn't say it.

27:22.029 --> 27:23.029
Still hasn't said it.

27:23.689 --> 27:26.710
How simple would it be for him to say that viruses aren't real?

27:27.150 --> 27:29.991
And they murdered people in America to make sure that we would believe it.

27:31.596 --> 27:35.958
The vaccine schedule is criminal and they're murdering people in America to make us believe it.

27:35.998 --> 27:39.179
Why hasn't he gotten there yet?

27:39.319 --> 27:41.000
Why haven't the Bailey's gotten there yet?

27:43.981 --> 27:47.243
Why hasn't James Lyons Weiler got there yet?

27:47.283 --> 27:49.183
He was there in 2016.

27:49.924 --> 27:53.145
Environmental and genetic causes of autism.

27:53.365 --> 27:55.426
That doesn't say much about vaccines, I guess.

27:56.526 --> 27:58.767
Wouldn't wanna step on anybody's toes in 2016.

28:02.486 --> 28:04.728
They don't cite each other in any of their books either.

28:04.768 --> 28:12.736
It's not like one anti-vax book says, hey, there was a book before me and a book before me, and those guys got some of those things right.

28:13.216 --> 28:19.502
They just ignore all the other books that came before them and just write a book like they're the first person to ever talk about it.

28:22.076 --> 28:39.608
I mean, once you see it for what it is, that Stephen Hatfield, the original guy that was accused of being the anthrax leaker in 2001, associated with Ebola and Rhodesia, associated with Meryl Nass and Robert Malone already with the Amerithrax vaccine back in 2001.

28:41.169 --> 28:42.570
The last time I was talking to you, I said 2011.

28:43.370 --> 28:47.633
It's actually 2001 that those three are associated with each other and the anthrax vaccine.

28:49.367 --> 29:05.463
In 2019, the illustrious master of no virus, Andy Kaufman, was taking a grant from the state of New York to invent biotech devices to detect suicide in prisons.

29:07.765 --> 29:12.610
And now we're supposed to believe that somehow or another he couldn't get to call it murder in New York.

29:14.534 --> 29:17.315
They were murdering people with oxygen and ventilators.

29:17.375 --> 29:21.357
The hospitals were empty, but they were murdering people.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.339
They let people die in their homes with do not resuscitate orders.

29:25.379 --> 29:28.901
But somehow or another, that never made it to the top of his discussion.

29:28.921 --> 29:32.263
It was really just, you know, they don't culture viruses.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.624
They don't isolate them and they don't purify them.

29:34.644 --> 29:40.107
And I got this friend named Christine Massey, who's got all these FOIA requests who say that they don't do it either.

29:42.079 --> 29:48.460
So rather than saying that they're lying and they're murdering people to cover the lie, these people got into these hamster wheels.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.901
Semantic hamster wheels.

29:51.601 --> 29:53.241
Methodological hamster wheels.

29:54.262 --> 29:55.582
Genetic hamster wheels.

29:55.662 --> 29:57.682
Molecular biological hamster wheels.

29:57.702 --> 29:58.322
It doesn't matter.

29:58.342 --> 30:02.543
As long as you don't say murder and lies, then it's all good.

30:05.244 --> 30:09.985
Brett Weinstein, first year and a half locked down with a bandana and woodchop goggles.

30:11.027 --> 30:12.268
It definitely was a virus.

30:12.348 --> 30:13.788
I mean, AIDS came from bushmeat.

30:16.110 --> 30:19.331
It's been many years, ladies and gentlemen, and this has not progressed.

30:20.492 --> 30:22.032
We have not moved forward.

30:22.092 --> 30:23.113
We have not woken up.

30:26.154 --> 30:37.200
And if you see that in November, 2023 in Bucharest, Romania, Merrill Nass up there, not circled, Robert Malone and his wife,

30:38.813 --> 30:42.555
Brett Weinstein, Jessica Rose, that's Harvey Reich.

30:43.196 --> 30:44.937
There's Nick Hudson in the middle.

30:45.457 --> 30:47.218
And who's Nick Hudson standing next to?

30:47.619 --> 30:50.620
Nick Hudson is standing next to Stephen Hatfield.

30:51.381 --> 31:01.147
Stephen Hatfield, the guy who said that Barney should be wearing a mask to teach children how to lock down.

31:03.008 --> 31:04.529
That guy is on stage.

31:05.658 --> 31:17.185
Right next to Nick Hudson in November of 2023, the guy who said that for the health of America, Barney the dinosaur should also be wearing a mask so that kids really get it.

31:17.625 --> 31:22.428
He also said that people should wear a rubber apron when in taking care of their kids when they have COVID.

31:23.749 --> 31:30.113
And those videos are still available for anybody that, you know, dares to ask a question.

31:31.465 --> 31:33.146
That's the remarkable thing about it.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.887
I'm not doing anything magic.

31:34.947 --> 31:37.629
I'm just going and asking the relevant questions.

31:37.669 --> 31:39.550
Like, what were these people up to?

31:39.930 --> 31:44.473
And why would they be up to it with Steven Hatfill in Romania?

31:46.915 --> 31:53.079
Why would Denny Rancourt choose Romania of all the places to go hang out with these people and have breakfast with them at the hotel?

31:54.909 --> 31:57.330
Does that make you trust Denny Rancor more or less?

31:57.710 --> 32:00.352
Does this make you trust Nick Hudson more or less?

32:00.372 --> 32:06.335
What if I told you that Nick Hudson was on a cruise off the coast of Turkey with a lot of these people the year before this?

32:09.397 --> 32:10.937
Would that make you feel better or worse?

32:11.838 --> 32:13.399
Because these are all just truths.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.342
Not everybody's aware of them, but I am because these people were talking to me about it.

32:21.297 --> 32:27.842
Trying to explain to me that on that cruise, Robert Malone and his wife fought so much that they have to be real.

32:28.362 --> 32:31.004
And that I definitely shouldn't attack Robert Malone anymore.

32:32.646 --> 32:33.747
I can't make this stuff up.

32:33.807 --> 32:34.247
It's real.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.869
It's just what I can't forget it either.

32:36.889 --> 32:37.770
I don't have to remember it.

32:37.790 --> 32:38.910
I don't have any notes here.

32:39.371 --> 32:40.532
What do I need notes for?

32:41.152 --> 32:42.994
This is the trauma of my adult life.

32:43.074 --> 32:44.635
These people lying to me like this.

32:46.144 --> 32:55.186
And I think my testimony about these people is one of the best red threads that puts them into one gigantic show.

32:57.147 --> 33:05.489
Keep in mind that Stephen Hatfield was on Steve Bannon's show in January, 2020, talking about a lab leak.

33:08.749 --> 33:09.990
This is significant.

33:12.971 --> 33:14.591
And this is a year ago.

33:18.598 --> 33:28.666
And so Denny Rancor says that it's poverty level and household income, serious mental illness, obesity, and the excess mortality is a direct correlation across states to all of these things.

33:28.686 --> 33:30.987
There's no correlation with age, he says.

33:32.268 --> 33:35.311
Oh, sorry, true with and without the vaccines, not correlated with age.

33:35.871 --> 33:41.656
So if it's not correlated with age, he says it's the vaccine.

33:43.337 --> 33:46.199
But can you see what's, can you see the graph he's showing here?

33:46.239 --> 33:47.320
Can you see the slope of it?

33:48.922 --> 33:52.324
Maybe I should use this graph to show you how obvious the signal is.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.485
Maybe I'll just use this graph to show you how obvious the signal is.

33:55.505 --> 33:57.746
What if I just put this graph right here and let this thing run?

33:58.806 --> 34:01.668
Can you please tell me that you can see that there's a signal coming?

34:02.568 --> 34:05.129
That in 1980, there's already a signal coming.

34:05.149 --> 34:05.689
I can see it.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.511
All I had to do is put Denny Rancor's graph here.

34:08.851 --> 34:15.213
You can see the slope in Denny Rancor's graph, which corresponds to this thing coming up here.

34:15.354 --> 34:16.114
Can you see it yet?

34:17.577 --> 34:19.398
And Denny Rancor says, this is nothing.

34:20.178 --> 34:22.219
That slope that you see there is nothing.

34:22.839 --> 34:26.120
That's not a rise in all-cause mortality at all, he says.

34:27.701 --> 34:30.902
No increase in all-cause mortality because of opioids.

34:31.642 --> 34:41.886
There's no correlation with age, but there's 500,000 people dead in the United States from opioids, but he doesn't seem to think that that number matters, even though they're not old people.

34:43.286 --> 34:45.047
Can you see the signal coming yet, guys?

34:47.608 --> 34:53.331
And can you understand why it would be that they would need people talking about all-cause mortality so early and so often?

34:53.371 --> 34:54.352
There's Dodd over there.

34:55.192 --> 34:55.632
This guy.

34:55.652 --> 34:57.453
He never says it.

34:57.533 --> 34:58.694
Harvey Reich never says it.

34:58.714 --> 35:00.195
He's also an epidemiologist.

35:00.235 --> 35:00.975
He's really smart.

35:01.295 --> 35:06.778
We can't expect Sabine Hazan to say it because she's just, you know, an expert in talking shit.

35:07.478 --> 35:08.519
And I mean that literally.

35:08.559 --> 35:10.380
That's the name of the book that she's selling.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.281
And she sequenced the COVID virus in the gut.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.322
So that makes it real.

35:17.711 --> 35:20.413
Why do we have a Canadian in front of the Senate?

35:20.534 --> 35:23.396
Why do we have a Dutch or a Belgian guy in front of the Senate?

35:24.697 --> 35:27.340
Why do we have these Romanian guys in front of the Senate?

35:27.600 --> 35:39.971
Who are these people getting flown in, except for people getting flown in as part of Team Robert Malone, Team Kevin McKernan, Team Human Genome Project, Department of Energy, DITRA, I don't know.

35:43.882 --> 35:47.986
There's no explanation for how we can be 2024 and be where we are.

35:48.026 --> 35:54.353
There's no explanation for it at all, other than the fact that most of the people that got us here are in on it.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.879
There's no other explanation.

35:57.479 --> 36:03.841
And that's the reason why in America, we have Bloomberg saying that vaccines are crazy, crazy amazing.

36:04.361 --> 36:06.801
And if we get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:06.861 --> 36:10.282
in the White House somewhere useful, then it could be a disaster.

36:10.922 --> 36:14.743
And these other channels are finally solving the lab leak.

36:14.783 --> 36:16.463
And of course, it's a gain of function virus.

36:16.503 --> 36:18.124
Boy, we better regulate this stuff.

36:20.224 --> 36:24.865
And I'm suggesting to you that the only way we got here is because Brett Weinstein.

36:25.751 --> 36:37.035
because of Robert Malone, because of Pierre Cory, because of Peter McCullough, because of all of these people not having the principles to continue to speak out and move as they learned.

36:37.435 --> 36:39.775
I'm not saying all of them knew, because I didn't know.

36:40.316 --> 36:42.636
I didn't know in 2020 that this could all be a lie.

36:42.656 --> 36:44.757
It never even dawned on me that it was possible.

36:45.874 --> 36:55.844
And you notice, notice carefully how the no virus group wasn't very good at getting anybody on their side in 2020 or 2021.

36:55.904 --> 36:57.125
They were so bad at it.

36:58.066 --> 36:59.567
It was just extraordinary.

37:00.268 --> 37:03.671
Because in the end, by 2021, I was already saying Mark Bailey's right.

37:04.272 --> 37:09.317
Everything that Mark Bailey wrote in his farewell to virology is correct.

37:10.481 --> 37:13.142
It doesn't get rid of the observations that are made.

37:13.182 --> 37:16.062
It doesn't get rid of what happens in those experiments.

37:16.202 --> 37:18.723
It gets rid of the conclusions that were drawn.

37:18.783 --> 37:24.004
It gets rid of the implication of high-fidelity understanding that was implied by that work.

37:25.804 --> 37:27.625
It doesn't mean that there's no biology there.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.205
It doesn't mean that there's no molecular biology there at all.

37:30.245 --> 37:38.447
It means that we don't understand it yet, that we need to revisit these observations to see where we went wrong and that there's scholarly work to do.

37:39.403 --> 37:42.306
And I have said it many times, I think Mark Bailey made a good start.

37:42.366 --> 37:45.249
I think Stephen Lanka made a good start on it.

37:47.571 --> 37:49.553
But then again, I come back to the same thing.

37:49.593 --> 37:56.640
Then why in all these years have you not said that they are murdering people in order to lie about this?

37:57.881 --> 38:02.246
Why in all of these years have you not said that there is this population pyramid thing?

38:03.010 --> 38:05.613
And they knew that all-cause mortality was going to go up.

38:05.673 --> 38:12.100
And so what they did was they used this signal and misconstrued it as evidence of a public health crisis.

38:13.341 --> 38:17.385
And they're using it to convince us that virology is real, but virology is not.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.807
They're murdering people to hide it.

38:19.247 --> 38:20.449
Why didn't they say that?

38:21.330 --> 38:23.512
Because that wasn't on their script, ladies and gentlemen.

38:24.687 --> 38:26.450
and it's still not on their script now.

38:26.610 --> 38:37.027
Actually, Sunday, the 29th, 2024, I got an email right before this talk from Christine Massey, and I just want to read it out loud.

38:38.493 --> 38:43.237
Hi, JJ, I'm 44 minutes into your latest rant on Stephen Frost's platform.

38:43.677 --> 38:46.899
You've accused Andy Kaufman of being part of an elaborate hoax.

38:46.979 --> 38:47.680
Yes, I have.

38:48.321 --> 38:55.246
Can you please specify exactly what hoax he is allegedly a part of and cite your evidence for this accusation?

38:55.286 --> 39:07.055
Again, I will cite the idea that he was connected to Cuomo directly in New York by a grant to produce biometrics for prisons in New York.

39:08.189 --> 39:26.387
at the start of the pandemic, he took a very obtuse position on vaccines or medicine or the COVID or whatever, nothing useful, and definitely, definitely, definitely suggested that there was no murder going on, that they were lying about it, that there was nothing happening.

39:27.709 --> 39:28.449
And that's not true.

39:29.570 --> 39:31.152
We know now that they murdered people.

39:32.862 --> 39:34.683
and I believe that he was part of it.

39:34.743 --> 39:57.740
And I think there's five years of video evidence on Rumble and on Telegram groups and on Signal groups and on Twitter and everywhere else to see that if you go back to 2020 and then go to 2021 and try to remember in your goldfish memory that that's two years now and then go to 2022 and that's three years and compare.

39:58.652 --> 40:13.658
what he was saying in 2020, and in 2021, and in 2022, and then rub your little Fu Manchu beard, and ask yourself the question, how the hell did he make no progress in three years, if he was so far ahead in 2020?

40:13.838 --> 40:22.961
And you can ask the same question of Brett Weinstein, you can ask the same question of Robert Malone, or Pierre Kory, or any of these people.

40:24.021 --> 40:27.423
And once you really do the math and realize that it's years,

40:29.585 --> 40:30.605
They didn't learn anything.

40:31.646 --> 40:42.470
And in those years was when I was a faculty member at a medical school crying to them, then losing my job and still crying to them, then getting hired by them.

40:43.390 --> 40:44.451
You see the problem?

40:45.711 --> 40:47.112
Then getting published with them.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.534
And now I'm telling you that they're lying about it.

40:50.594 --> 40:53.034
I'm telling you that I've figured out that they're lying about it.

40:53.074 --> 40:56.736
And I'm burning all the bridges that I could have kept with all of these people.

40:57.276 --> 40:58.896
And it's not enriching my family.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.237
It's not making me famous.

41:02.477 --> 41:04.938
And I don't care about my name.

41:05.078 --> 41:11.180
I want somebody to believe that these people were involved in the same thing that they're involved in now.

41:11.560 --> 41:17.062
The same thing that a lot of these sabotaged organizations are involved in now and have always been involved in.

41:20.345 --> 41:39.436
Also, recall last May, you were still promoting a narrative involving four imaginary endemic coronaviruses, but never cited any valid scientific evidence to show that any exist because there isn't any such evidence, and claiming that the fraudulent COVID-19 PCR tests used to generate the fake cases were crazy specific.

41:40.782 --> 41:51.633
Now, of course, this is again, remember, the secretary of the no virus people, this is the one that sends all the nasty emails to Mary Holland that I was supposed to answer two years ago, and I did.

41:52.254 --> 42:04.006
And I tried to answer in a way that said, we can get together on the idea that there's no viruses if we make it a little more subtle, a little more nuanced argument, and I want you guys to get together about this, and they shot it down.

42:06.311 --> 42:11.376
And instead, they did stuff like this, saying, well, why don't you give us more evidence of coronaviruses?

42:11.436 --> 42:19.745
And I have been saying for at least two years now that the evidence that they have for coronaviruses in the wild is sequence evidence alone.

42:21.086 --> 42:25.711
And so if you don't take the word of the sequences, then already the whole thing falls apart.

42:25.751 --> 42:26.572
And I'm fine with that.

42:27.892 --> 42:47.421
But they take those sequences and using standard methodologies developed in the Human Genome Project more than 10 years ago, maybe even 20 years ago, they create synthetic copies of those sequences in large, pure quantities that cannot be generated by any other means and do not exist naturally in nature.

42:47.521 --> 42:48.682
And that starting point

42:49.827 --> 43:00.232
when transfected, applied to a cell culture, transfected into a cell culture, can result in all kinds of changes that can be misconstrued as the effects of viruses.

43:02.148 --> 43:05.250
And for the most part, RNA virology is done that way.

43:05.310 --> 43:12.134
And ladies and gentlemen, I have been trying to get the no virus people and the CHD people to teach everybody this for more than two years.

43:12.174 --> 43:14.976
That's what my red pill talk was about last year.

43:15.476 --> 43:28.924
Brian Artis, for example, when he argues about venom, is telling you that they're making these proteins in huge quantities, but he seems to skip over the fact that in order to make those proteins in huge quantities, they have to do exactly what I am warning you about.

43:29.568 --> 43:37.973
They have to make large quantities of pure DNA and then have bacteria grow them up into even larger quantities and then convert that to a protein.

43:39.394 --> 43:46.778
In the case of the mRNA shot, they do that but they don't have to convert to protein because they can leave it at an mRNA.

43:47.218 --> 43:52.101
They can use a commercial enzyme to convert that DNA to RNA and then that's their product.

43:53.462 --> 43:56.984
It's a hundred times cheaper than making a monoclonal antibody.

43:58.055 --> 44:02.656
Billions of doses are very cheap to make, and they didn't even need to make them, right?

44:02.696 --> 44:08.918
Because of course, one of the things that I keep arguing is, is that none of these meddlers are talking about placebo.

44:08.978 --> 44:11.298
Why don't any of these people talk about placebo?

44:11.959 --> 44:25.202
I've been saying it for three years, that they could make a further argument of why people aren't always injured by the shot for a simple placebo substitution, which makes manufacturing easier, and it makes keeping track of the hot lots very much easier as well.

44:26.343 --> 44:28.565
but nobody can get there in five years.

44:30.026 --> 44:34.609
So they want me to give examples of endemic coronaviruses.

44:34.669 --> 44:38.932
And I have been saying for the last couple of years that RNA cannot pandemic.

44:38.992 --> 44:40.493
It can't be endemic.

44:40.513 --> 44:41.614
That doesn't make sense.

44:42.855 --> 44:49.060
Now, if I was not as good last May at saying it, I will submit that's probably true.

44:50.174 --> 45:00.021
But again, rather than trying to build bridges, or get me on their team, or to try and work together to solve this problem, it is an attack.

45:01.602 --> 45:19.675
Now what I want you to see, and I need you to see it very clearly, is that Christine Massey, and Andrew Kaufman, and Tom Cowan, and Zeck, and I don't know, there's one other one, and the Baileys,

45:20.325 --> 45:22.447
are all part of a little group, they all have books.

45:24.289 --> 45:31.937
And yet somehow or another, this guy, James Lyons Weiler, he's got an online university called IPAC.

45:32.618 --> 45:36.762
He's on stage with CHD every conference they ever do.

45:38.305 --> 45:44.368
He's raising money on his own nonprofit at CHD events, every time they have a CHD event.

45:44.928 --> 45:49.230
He's got a book called, The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

45:50.150 --> 45:53.592
It precedes Tom Cowan's book by two years.

45:54.232 --> 46:04.017
And yet Tom Cowan and the no virus people have spent weeks harassing me and meddling with my ability to make a living.

46:04.980 --> 46:08.682
to try and scratch my way back to sunshine.

46:10.623 --> 46:11.704
They've never attacked him.

46:12.464 --> 46:18.568
They've never criticized him, even though he's got thousands of more followers than me in any measure you could go on.

46:19.728 --> 46:25.832
And he's actively having a university that supposedly teaches this stuff where he teaches immunology.

46:27.381 --> 46:36.737
And yet she has the audacity to send me an email asking me to give her some evidence of some of this stuff, but not this guy with a book.

46:39.980 --> 46:42.361
And it goes on and on and on and on like this.

46:43.141 --> 46:47.123
In this new rant, you have insinuated that there are pathogens for which people need immunity.

46:47.163 --> 46:51.564
So I'm asking you if you can cite valid scientific evidence for this claim.

46:52.244 --> 46:55.986
Also, you make condescending and accusatory comments about the discussions of fluoride.

46:56.006 --> 47:00.167
Can you explain what your problem with is with exposing the issues around fluoride?

47:00.547 --> 47:02.068
And you can see, you can read it here.

47:03.160 --> 47:10.288
mass drugging, uncontrolled experimentation without informed consent, using hazardous waste, acid, also contaminated with arsenic and other toxins.

47:12.151 --> 47:20.901
It's all disingenuous, as disingenuous as the pushing of foyas for two years as evidence of something.

47:21.550 --> 47:31.078
when every lawyer knows that the exact language that you choose and the exact honesty of the organization all has a lot to do with what your request finds.

47:31.638 --> 47:33.320
And you can never really know for sure.

47:34.761 --> 47:35.882
Now, here's the deal.

47:36.702 --> 47:39.004
You know, because you were here, you saw it last time.

47:39.605 --> 47:41.586
I've said it a million times and I'll say it again.

47:41.807 --> 47:43.688
They need us to teach this to our kids.

47:44.309 --> 47:45.370
Where is that coming from?

47:47.752 --> 47:48.812
Why is that not in this?

47:48.852 --> 47:50.674
Well, anyway, it doesn't matter, that's good.

47:52.595 --> 48:08.367
The illusion that they've created is one that everybody agrees on, and please keep in mind, it's Peter McCullough, it's Jessica Rose, it's Brett Weinstein, it's Merrill Nass, it's Mary Holland, and they all say the same thing.

48:08.407 --> 48:10.749
Well, I certainly had something strange.

48:10.909 --> 48:12.530
I had something strange a couple times.

48:12.650 --> 48:16.773
It was one of the strangest, heaviest sicknesses I've ever had.

48:17.294 --> 48:19.896
I lost my sense of smell and taste.

48:20.902 --> 48:27.248
And so they have all testified for five years that there was something novel, even if they are the most skeptical of people.

48:28.430 --> 48:37.336
And interestingly enough, the people who say there's no virus are never called to the mat to explain the strange happenings.

48:37.476 --> 48:38.796
I'm always asked that question.

48:38.836 --> 48:45.140
Every time I speak, somebody says, yeah, but what about all the people that had this really strange sickness that they've never had before?

48:45.881 --> 48:50.704
And these no virus people have never bothered to explain it, but they want me to explain it.

48:51.064 --> 48:52.205
They want me to explain it.

48:52.665 --> 48:53.465
And here's the deal.

48:54.086 --> 48:57.128
They ran out the clock just like Robert Malone did.

48:57.952 --> 49:01.176
They ran out the clock by sticking to their little part of the narrative.

49:01.236 --> 49:07.663
That's the reason why in 2024, five years later, we are debating whether it was a lab leak or not.

49:07.724 --> 49:11.388
Just like Steve Bannon said on January 25th, 2020.

49:12.269 --> 49:17.976
Just like Stephen Hatfield implied in January of 2021, Stephen Hatfield's war room.

49:18.976 --> 49:22.559
And five years later, that's where we are.

49:23.199 --> 49:39.350
Because of a coordinated group of liars that extends beyond country borders and is probably paid by insider trading and social media money laundering through Substack and all these other things where you can just have fake followers.

49:39.390 --> 49:41.272
You can even sell fake books on Amazon.

49:42.233 --> 49:46.914
And that's why in 2020, I was already saying that the PCR was fake on a background.

49:47.654 --> 49:51.055
And these people have been working me for five years straight.

49:51.395 --> 49:59.437
That's why the only people that haven't visited your house, they haven't flown across the world to visit you in Pittsburgh.

50:00.517 --> 50:03.598
It's 2024, that's where we are right now.

50:04.198 --> 50:07.319
These guys want me to explain what's all about fluoridation.

50:07.359 --> 50:08.419
I explained it yesterday.

50:08.439 --> 50:10.940
You see fluoridation, it's down here at the bottom.

50:12.162 --> 50:18.063
this processed foods, seed oils, fast food, cosmetics, sunscreen, air, water, soil pollution.

50:18.083 --> 50:22.504
Everybody can get mad about that because we could agree about that 25 years ago.

50:22.544 --> 50:24.945
Those are not even low hanging fruit.

50:26.445 --> 50:35.487
Those are common sense things that in America we should have fixed decades ago, but we didn't because we had our head somewhere it shouldn't be.

50:36.724 --> 50:43.891
And it's no different than the ridiculous argument about Israel and Gaza and what's going on there and not going on there.

50:43.911 --> 50:47.914
And it's no different than the argument about Ukraine and what's going on there and not going on there.

50:48.835 --> 50:50.897
It's fine to argue about those things.

50:50.957 --> 50:59.485
Those are exactly the limited spectrums of debate they want you in because you don't have any way of getting any useful information about Israel and Gaza.

51:00.626 --> 51:02.007
You got top secret access.

51:02.898 --> 51:04.499
You know what Palantir's doing there?

51:04.539 --> 51:07.080
Do you have any access to the Mossad files?

51:07.100 --> 51:08.741
You know how to read Hebrew or something?

51:10.062 --> 51:11.303
And the same thing with Ukraine.

51:12.323 --> 51:22.309
Even the known history of Ukraine is probably curated in a way to make it obvious that there's bad guys and good guys in a way that completely hides what's actually going on there.

51:23.549 --> 51:28.472
I don't think I know what's going on in Ukraine, but I know for sure that they're lying about it.

51:30.435 --> 51:39.860
And the crazy part about it is, is that some of these same people that have been experts during this nonsense five years are also now experts on some of these political things.

51:43.182 --> 51:45.843
And none of them will bother to take this language.

51:45.903 --> 51:48.365
Look, intramuscular injection is dumb.

51:49.365 --> 51:51.366
I said it last time and I wanna say it again.

51:51.446 --> 51:55.949
We need to focus on this idea because think about how important it is if it's true.

51:57.119 --> 52:04.063
If you can't, as an MD, figure out the exceptions to that, or why, well, he's exaggerating, he can't say that.

52:04.543 --> 52:10.846
If you can't come up with a very succinct reason why that's wrong, we have a very big problem.

52:13.788 --> 52:22.072
If you can't figure out that Robert Malone is the inventor of transfection and two other people on that patent that nobody talks to.

52:23.333 --> 52:23.713
Funny, huh?

52:24.884 --> 52:30.105
Now, transfection is a real thing that we already knew how it worked and we already knew it would be criminal.

52:30.145 --> 52:32.706
And that's why I lost my job at the University of Pittsburgh.

52:32.746 --> 52:33.366
That's the truth.

52:33.886 --> 52:34.086
That's 2021.

52:34.526 --> 52:42.048
And ever since these people have been trying to get me to talk about something else other than this and the population pyramid, because it bothers them.

52:42.468 --> 52:53.631
And then some years later, thanks in part to the persistence of the no virus people and the good writing of Mark Bailey, I got to the stage where I could put it in three words.

52:54.434 --> 52:56.415
Don't need to download a PDF, just read.

52:57.195 --> 52:58.416
RNA cannot pandemic.

52:59.517 --> 53:04.579
And any academic biologist worth their salt could think about it for a second and be like, wow, that's interesting.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.340
Viruses are not pattern integrities.

53:07.420 --> 53:10.462
It's a little bigger idea, but I think it's something worth fighting for.

53:11.002 --> 53:17.425
And none of these people are doing it, including the no virus people that I tried to give the top two already three years ago.

53:17.525 --> 53:22.168
I just wanted to bring CHD and the no virus people together.

53:23.337 --> 53:25.498
on the idea that they were never vaccines.

53:25.538 --> 53:29.680
They were always transfection, very old technology based on recombinant DNA.

53:30.301 --> 53:35.723
And interestingly, the exact same reason why infectious clones are so interesting, because that's the term.

53:36.424 --> 53:48.270
That's the semantic sheet that gets hidden, gets pulled over everybody's eyes when they use recombinant DNA to do virology in cell culture or in animals.

53:49.358 --> 53:53.500
All of it is done with recombinant RNA and DNA.

53:54.260 --> 53:58.321
And if that's the starting point, then they're not recapitulating anything in nature.

53:59.042 --> 54:00.742
They're saying they find a sequence.

54:01.283 --> 54:06.825
And then since the sequence won't grow by itself, we have to use industrial methods to make the sequence.

54:06.885 --> 54:15.068
And then we can use a pure quantity of that sequence in cell culture to get a handle on what that sequence does in the wild.

54:15.108 --> 54:18.249
And that is an extraordinarily amazing why.

54:19.059 --> 54:33.924
that Peter Daszak is involved in, and Tony Fauci's involved in, and Kevin McKernan is involved in, and everybody who sits on the assumption that RNA can and does pandemic, and that RNA can and is endemic.

54:35.185 --> 54:36.005
It's not possible.

54:37.105 --> 54:42.547
That's not biologically possible because these are just molecules, they're not pattern integrities.

54:42.627 --> 54:42.887
And so,

54:45.100 --> 54:55.529
I'm not really sure, I don't wanna say too much more because I think I wanna be plenty open for questions, but I think the best way to summarize it is very simple.

54:56.670 --> 55:10.642
At any time in 2020 or 2021, any of these people, like I would suggest the earlier your book about vaccines came out, the more the onus would be on you to be ahead of us on this.

55:12.253 --> 55:28.218
If your book came out in 2016, or you had a book in 2018, I don't think you can really explain away the fact that you're not already calling the vaccine schedule criminal, and that they murder people in order to hide that.

55:29.098 --> 55:36.440
That there is a population pyramid problem in the West that needs managing, and that's why they murdered people in Scotland.

55:37.250 --> 55:43.112
That's why they murdered people in the Netherlands with a shortage of healthcare workers and a lack of antibiotics.

55:43.152 --> 55:49.614
People died of urinary tract infection in the Netherlands and Scotland and other places in the UK, and that is murder.

55:51.215 --> 55:55.016
And it's not just because they said it was COVID and it wasn't COVID.

55:55.116 --> 55:59.018
No, they murdered people and then called it COVID.

55:59.678 --> 56:02.439
That's very different than even letting people die.

56:03.219 --> 56:04.880
They murdered people.

56:06.147 --> 56:09.110
because otherwise the peaks wouldn't have been there, do you see?

56:10.511 --> 56:23.461
The all-cause mortality expected from this ever-increasing bump in the population pyramid, that wasn't necessarily going to just go in one go, right?

56:24.082 --> 56:30.007
If those are rich people, those people are in Medicare, then we should be spending money to keep them alive.

56:31.431 --> 56:41.736
And in America, the last six months of a person's life costs about a half a million dollars on Medicare or Medicaid, whichever one it is, I apologize for not knowing.

56:42.436 --> 56:58.844
But that's important to see because if you can just kill those people instead of doling out that six months, well, that's a pretty big bonus, especially if in addition to that, you're gonna pay those corporate hospitals for that death because it's a crisis and COVID deaths are worth about $50,000.

57:02.938 --> 57:04.279
It's murder and lies.

57:04.519 --> 57:10.884
And we need to go back to 2020 and 2021 and 2022 and see that they were murdering people and lying about it.

57:11.325 --> 57:15.168
They were letting an opioid crisis in America go wild and lying about it.

57:15.548 --> 57:23.614
And then people like Pierre Corey perpetuated the myth that this was all evidence of COVID and creating a decrease in life expectancy in America.

57:23.694 --> 57:24.935
Wow, scary.

57:26.176 --> 57:31.060
The same guy who told us that we needed to use pure oxygen in hospitals up to 60 liters a minute.

57:32.469 --> 57:38.672
And nobody, none of these people are talking about the fact that if you wear a mask all day, that your pulse ox might go down.

57:39.132 --> 57:48.096
And none of these people are talking about the fact that the FLCCC said, while you're wearing a mask, if your pulse ox goes down to 94, you better go to the hospital.

57:48.116 --> 57:50.357
So then you'd go to the hospital and you get pure oxygen.

57:50.397 --> 57:57.760
And we've already known since the late 80s, that pure oxygen or even 80% pure oxygen without proper controls and humidification,

57:58.240 --> 58:03.964
will cause extreme detrimental damage to the lungs called ARDS.

58:05.666 --> 58:21.217
And none of these doctors, Pierre Cory, none of these doctors, Robert Malone or Jessica Rose or any of these people are talking about how supplemental oxygen was used to kill Grace Shara and hundreds if not thousands of other people in the hospital.

58:21.917 --> 58:25.140
It's not the last thing they were on, it's the first thing they were given.

58:25.950 --> 58:32.756
that caused all of the symptoms in their lungs to go haywire and ask for further treatment.

58:34.297 --> 58:49.289
The very progression of the disease only occurring in hospitals that Denny Rancor noticed can probably be tied directly to the use of supplemental oxygen by untrained staff without the proper equipment to manage it.

58:50.810 --> 58:52.692
And then those people being placed on vents.

58:53.743 --> 58:56.667
Remember, supplemental oxygen was used because we were running out of vents.

58:56.767 --> 59:00.432
Remember that Elon Musk was going to convert one of his factories to make vents.

59:02.274 --> 59:07.161
You know, the same Elon Musk that now got Donald Trump elected and is going to clean up our government.

59:11.127 --> 59:13.688
I don't know what to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, but I think we've got them.

59:13.748 --> 59:14.649
I think we really do.

59:14.729 --> 59:17.571
I think if you want to, you don't need me.

59:17.611 --> 59:18.451
You can do the work.

59:18.491 --> 59:35.720
It's just the right search terms in the YouTube search engine, in the Rumble search engine, and you will find videos from 2020, and you will see that these people were seeding a Scooby-Doo narrative that we have solved over five years, and that they didn't make any progress for five years.

59:35.760 --> 59:40.103
They just kind of ran around in circles with their heads cut off, focused on one thing or another thing,

59:41.107 --> 59:53.997
and never focused on the murder, never focused on the predicted rise in all-cause mortality that could have bankrupt any of our countries if let gone, unchecked, and unmanaged.

59:56.079 --> 01:00:02.544
And instead now we have the Magnificent Seven, including Steve Bannon, marching into the White House supposedly.

01:00:02.584 --> 01:00:04.526
I guarantee you none of those people are gonna be there.

01:00:05.346 --> 01:00:05.947
There's no way.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:14.083
And if they are, then it's even further evidence of a sort of ridiculous theater that cannot be taken seriously anymore.

01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:15.264
America is in big trouble.

01:00:15.905 --> 01:00:16.585
That's for sure.

01:00:19.406 --> 01:00:28.770
If I'm wrong about some of these things and I'm wrong about some of these people, then it shouldn't change what they can do with the words, choices that I've come up with.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:40.516
So the bottom line is, is that it feels very disingenuous to me that these people after five years haven't at least said, well, Jay's a dick, but he says some things really well.

01:00:41.673 --> 01:00:47.695
And I'm sorry, but if these guys were really trying to win, then that should have been their conclusion a couple, three years ago.

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:48.536
Jay's a creep.

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:49.896
Boy, I don't like him.

01:00:49.916 --> 01:00:50.976
He's angry all the time.

01:00:51.277 --> 01:00:58.639
He's wrong about a lot of people, but man, oh man, when he summarizes biology, boy, he's spot on, dead on balls accurate, but they don't.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:10.864
Instead, they send emails asking for evidence of coronaviruses or evidence of contagion or asking me why I'm so against fluoride or something like that when they know that's wrong.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:13.997
So that's where we are.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:18.940
I think 2025 can be really hopeful because we have the language, we have the language.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.341
And if we wanted to have more of the language, I've got more of it and other people might have more of it.

01:01:23.382 --> 01:01:30.805
We could work together to get the best one page of language together that would end this, but these people don't wanna do that.

01:01:31.765 --> 01:01:33.946
So I think some of us should try to do it.

01:01:33.986 --> 01:01:37.628
I think I have been trying to do it for a couple of years now.

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:42.570
And every day I push stream, I think I'm gonna break something and nothing ever breaks.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:50.300
But I've had this slide or a less accurate version of it for almost three years now.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.861
And all of these people have seen it.

01:01:51.901 --> 01:01:53.421
They've all gotten it in an email.

01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:57.762
They all know that, okay, some of you want to argue about viruses, that's fine.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:02:03.003
But you could start here and say, we really like what Jay says here, but he's wrong about viruses.

01:02:03.063 --> 01:02:04.723
And then we would be making progress.

01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:06.584
And they could have done that in 2021.

01:02:08.717 --> 01:02:09.317
And they didn't.

01:02:09.778 --> 01:02:10.638
They knew my name.

01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:17.102
They even did a whole stream with me, the six of them or five of them together to talk about how infectious clones are.

01:02:17.142 --> 01:02:19.504
He hasn't given us any evidence of infectious clones.

01:02:19.544 --> 01:02:24.407
The entire PubMed archive is infectious clones, which is what?

01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:32.833
It is recombinant DNA produced the same way that they produce it in all other commercial applications to make antibodies or make venom.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.881
except they don't have to go all the way to the protein.

01:02:35.921 --> 01:02:37.362
They don't have to purify a protein.

01:02:37.402 --> 01:02:40.804
They just make a lot of DNA using a big bacterial culture.

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:46.268
They lyse the bacterial culture, isolate the DNA, pass it through a commercial RNA.

01:02:46.488 --> 01:02:54.193
And now you have the RNA that you can call a transfection or you can call an investigational vaccine and pad yourself on the back for having saved the world.

01:02:54.895 --> 01:03:01.859
and it's the exact same technology that they use when Metobiota or Peter Daszak says, we found a sequence.

01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:10.984
Well, then they go and they order it from some company that like Kevin McKernan would be at, and they get a tube in the mail with pure DNA that couldn't be produced any other way.

01:03:11.844 --> 01:03:15.046
And then that's what they start with when they do virology.

01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:18.428
And that's also what they start with when they do gain-of-function research.

01:03:18.448 --> 01:03:21.609
So gain-of-function research is not anything special.

01:03:21.649 --> 01:03:32.655
It is just synthetic DNA and RNA transfected into cell culture and then elaborate stories told about what those experiments mean and what they represent as potential dangers.

01:03:34.147 --> 01:03:35.368
So I don't know what to say.

01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:36.709
I agree with Mark Bailey.

01:03:36.749 --> 01:03:43.015
I think Mark Bailey's probably the closest to a true player in the no virus people.

01:03:43.416 --> 01:03:48.280
I'm absolutely convinced that Tom Collin and Andy Kaufman were hired and are doing a schtick.

01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:57.853
I don't know if Christine Massey knows, she could just be naive and believe in these people and they could have convinced her a long time ago and been very loyal and that's fine.

01:03:59.094 --> 01:04:10.084
But I assure you, just like CHD, there are sabotagers in all of these little conclaves of ideas that refuse to sort of

01:04:11.045 --> 01:04:11.906
touch each other.

01:04:11.966 --> 01:04:20.069
The no-virus people have never even come close to touching the anti-vax stance of the CHD.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.170
They're just all garbage.

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.691
And that is by design.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:27.393
And that's because they're there to do that.

01:04:28.033 --> 01:04:34.697
CHD's not making any more progress than the no-virus people and not making any more progress than the natural virus people.

01:04:34.757 --> 01:04:37.738
It's all the same set of hamster wheels.

01:04:37.798 --> 01:04:39.039
And once you realize that,

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:51.586
You can see how cheaply the people that run this show could populate all of these places, especially if they had control over social media, which you already know they do.

01:04:53.101 --> 01:05:15.952
Elon Musk and Peter Thiel control the keys to several very key and in play social media including Telegram and Gab and Substack and Stripe and Twitter and X and PayPal and all of these things that in the background are moving money, moving influence and herding cats.

01:05:17.816 --> 01:05:26.340
And people like us who have been thinking that, you know what, if we just keep streaming and we keep sharing, then eventually we're going to get enough subscribers that we're going to be okay.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.263
I have had 3,100 subscribers on Twitch for the last three years.

01:05:32.063 --> 01:05:37.966
I've had 14,000 followers on Twitter for the last three years until this year when I went down to 13,800.

01:05:41.414 --> 01:05:43.935
And so it could be that I have nothing to say.

01:05:43.955 --> 01:05:45.816
It could be that I have no new message.

01:05:47.357 --> 01:05:52.319
Or it could be that, like a lot of people who have been censored, you don't see them.

01:05:52.659 --> 01:05:53.599
You can't find them.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.621
It might even look like people are seeing my tweets, but they're not.

01:05:58.301 --> 01:05:59.102
Nobody sees them.

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:00.602
And that's the point.

01:06:00.803 --> 01:06:05.345
You can't rise on social media if social media is pre-programmed.

01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:10.867
And every single one of these platforms, you should treat as pre-programmed.

01:06:11.502 --> 01:06:20.148
that all the people that are put in front of you are pre-selected from a group of maybe thousands of people that want to be, and hundreds of people that were screened.

01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:29.055
And you only need to see 40 or 50 in your YouTube feed before you won't realize that 40 or 50 of them are put there.

01:06:29.972 --> 01:06:34.716
And I assure you, all the marbles are at stake.

01:06:34.736 --> 01:06:37.859
We're talking about multi-generational enslavement.

01:06:37.899 --> 01:06:46.206
So if it takes a few hundred people to be on the internet for a few years and lying consistently together, that's child's play.

01:06:46.926 --> 01:07:06.879
If you want to believe that Robert Malone is selling a book through CHD, and that book is called The Psywar, but he's not going to tell you that The Psywar is composed of hundreds of people placed online that don't have to pay rent, or worry about where their money comes from, or do their own tech, or even cut their own videos.

01:07:07.537 --> 01:07:13.601
Do you know how long it takes me to cut a video when I just want to cut me and two cameras on the basketball court?

01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:16.662
It takes me like four days to make that video by myself.

01:07:17.103 --> 01:07:19.704
And if I make that video, then I'm not coaching basketball.

01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:21.925
I'm not making a slide deck like this.

01:07:21.985 --> 01:07:25.507
I'm not posting shorts on Instagram or doing anything else.

01:07:26.348 --> 01:07:36.234
I'm just watching my own video over and over again and editing every cut and editing all the subtitles and all the other bullshit that's involved in editing a video that none of these people ever have to do.

01:07:37.165 --> 01:08:00.144
because they have a staff, because Rumble paid for a studio in their backyard, because these people are part of an elaborate international illusion that is designed to enslave our children after we teach them that the gain-of-function mythology that's on TV is real, that the pandemic really happened, and that vaccines usually work, but sometimes people are hurt.

01:08:01.586 --> 01:08:05.389
And it's as simple as saying intramuscular injection is dumb, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:06.229 --> 01:08:13.252
And if we start there, and if we really did just start there, do you realize we would win also on 5G?

01:08:13.312 --> 01:08:18.214
Because 5G does not work if you don't inject something into the person first.

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:23.756
You can't put a 5G tower outside of my house and crank it up, then I'll just move.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.938
If it's not close enough, it's not gonna matter.

01:08:28.918 --> 01:08:30.619
But if you put something in my body,

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:41.813
and I do believe there are things that they can put in your body, then yes, 5G, even 4G, even regular radio waves could potentially, magnets could potentially be dangerous.

01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:44.116
And that's the point.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.820
intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:53.982
And so I don't need to bitch about 5G and scream and yell about what I know and don't know about 5G.

01:08:54.042 --> 01:09:12.607
What I do know as a ham radio operator for 30 years, and as a guy who was an electrophysiologist and has done actual optogenetic experiments that are published in actual journals, I can tell you that this kind of controlling of the brain or manipulating of the brain from remote is absurd.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.001
It's absolutely absurd.

01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:19.284
That's very different than me saying that I don't believe people get headaches from their phone.

01:09:19.324 --> 01:09:20.024
Of course they do.

01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:25.128
It's very different than me saying that nobody's sensitive to Wi-Fi, because I'm sure there are.

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:34.394
But understanding those mechanisms and weaponizing those mechanisms is ridiculous, because first and foremost, in order for that to happen,

01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:38.327
Ultimately, they need us to give this sovereignty up.

01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:40.549
And that's why I think this is the most important thing.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:42.410
5G can be paused.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:47.054
If we got everybody to stop taking intramuscular injections, all of this would end.

01:09:48.115 --> 01:09:48.835
All of it would end.

01:09:49.275 --> 01:09:51.797
They don't have anything if we don't take intramuscular injections.

01:09:51.817 --> 01:09:53.579
What are they gonna do, send us pills in the mail?

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.060
What can they do?

01:09:56.941 --> 01:09:58.142
They can't do anything.

01:09:59.231 --> 01:10:03.656
The real thing to realize is that our children only need to understand that.

01:10:03.696 --> 01:10:04.657
Everything else goes away.

01:10:04.717 --> 01:10:06.459
Transfection is a big detail then.

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:08.941
Because of course you're not going to transfect yourself.

01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:10.303
It's an intramuscular injection.

01:10:11.877 --> 01:10:14.578
So I think this is crucial.

01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:17.358
RNA cannot pandemic is great for biologists.

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:24.620
Transfection is great for people who should have done known better and have familiarity with that word.

01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:30.682
But intramuscular injection is dumb as something that even somebody at a gas station could go, wait a minute, really?

01:10:30.702 --> 01:10:34.523
And there is real biology to support that.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:38.104
And I think the real biology to support that is the thing that I want to leave off with.

01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:41.758
I just want to draw it in a cartoon the way that I've drawn it before.

01:10:42.579 --> 01:10:47.905
I want you to think of yourself as a bit of a tube and that's it.

01:10:49.427 --> 01:10:52.110
And you shouldn't really think of yourself as any more than a tube.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.313
And the food comes in one end and it goes out the other.

01:10:56.214 --> 01:10:59.278
And you also get some air in here and that goes out the same end.

01:11:00.199 --> 01:11:04.104
Well, occasionally some air comes out the other end as well, but that's not usually inhaled air.

01:11:04.605 --> 01:11:06.808
But the point is, is that this is a tube.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:15.079
And so, on the inside of and the all barriers of your body are aligned by epithelial cells.

01:11:16.212 --> 01:11:22.740
It doesn't matter whether you're talking about on the outside or whether you're talking about on the inside, there's a lining of epithelial cells.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:31.632
And epithelial cells are the gatekeepers of our bodies and they decide what gets absorbed and how it gets absorbed and whether it gets actively transported or not.

01:11:32.344 --> 01:11:53.910
And those mechanisms are well understood in the gut and well understood in the skin to a certain extent, but they also understand beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is another layer of that system there with several autonomous cells that seem to serve some role as gatekeepers in terms of even gatekeeping the ability of things to pass between

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:55.856
epithelial cells.

01:11:56.296 --> 01:11:59.438
And so, we understand a little bit about that and we call that the immune system.

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:05.301
We also have a couple other evidences of the immune system that if anybody asks you, I don't believe in the immune system.

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:11.245
There's evidence that there's some system there and there's a couple anecdotal things that you can point to.

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:18.409
One would be the way that the body reacts to tissue transplants and how we can reasonably predict

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:26.474
that some tissue transplants will be relatively successful and others are very likely to not be successful.

01:12:26.874 --> 01:12:29.016
And that has something to do with these cells.

01:12:29.456 --> 01:12:39.542
Now, to what extent these cells learn or memorize molecular memories to pathogens or some signal in nature is up for debate.

01:12:39.562 --> 01:12:41.464
And I'm fine for that being up for debate.

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:46.267
But what I'm not fine for is the idea that if we understand this broad biology

01:12:47.932 --> 01:13:08.130
where an inside of our body is protected from the outside by a barrier, then trying to augment the effectiveness of that barrier by injecting medicine beyond it is logically incorrect.

01:13:08.897 --> 01:13:12.080
It is on its face objectionable.

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:31.956
And if we can on its face object to vaccines, then there is a case from the 80s, I believe, in Idaho, which already established that as a legal precedence, that if the intervention itself doesn't make sense, then a mandate for it or a government support of it cannot exist.

01:13:33.274 --> 01:13:40.996
And so somebody tried to challenge some vaccine thing in Idaho and challenged it on the basis that the vaccine itself wasn't working and it didn't work.

01:13:41.056 --> 01:13:43.297
And so that's why they were challenging it.

01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:45.157
And the court said that was a legal way.

01:13:45.177 --> 01:13:50.298
I don't know the details of it, because I'm not a lawyer, but I do know that there's a little kink in the armor there.

01:13:50.699 --> 01:14:00.261
And this would be the big biological picture that I don't think there's an academic biologist in America or in the EU that could make a useful argument against it.

01:14:01.147 --> 01:14:06.649
I don't care how many details you add or how much more you know about payers patches than I do.

01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:09.810
This means checkmate.

01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:18.753
If you understand the immune system like I do, if you understand the immune system like Tony Fauci does and NIAID does, then this is real.

01:14:19.614 --> 01:14:22.054
It's got an orientation, it faces outward.

01:14:22.855 --> 01:14:25.276
And outward is also inside of your gut.

01:14:26.256 --> 01:14:29.277
And that orientation is there and it's functional.

01:14:30.296 --> 01:14:37.904
So if you try to augment it or interact with it at the opposite orientation, you won't interact with it usefully.

01:14:42.448 --> 01:14:51.177
And so on its face, methodologically, intramuscular injection of medicine to augment healthy people is dumb.

01:14:55.236 --> 01:14:56.517
I think that's really where we are.

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:58.117
I think that's the best way to end it.

01:14:58.177 --> 01:15:01.039
I think that's what we should discuss.

01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:10.663
I don't think we need to get into a big argument about how high-fidelity information we have about coronaviruses or not.

01:15:11.564 --> 01:15:22.789
We know that there's a huge background of molecular noise that metabiota has been making a living on for decades, and NIH has been making a living on for decades.

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.702
And the fidelity that they claim to have is just not there.

01:15:26.742 --> 01:15:31.606
And I agree with, as much as I know about Mark Bailey, I agree with him.

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:36.771
But as much as I know about these other people, I know that they've been playing a very disingenuous game.

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:43.677
And it has resulted in a lot of suffering for a lot of people and a lot of murder that has yet to be brought to justice.

01:15:45.276 --> 01:15:51.761
So I think everybody's got homework to do and videos to download and people to re-examine.

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:53.822
And I suggest that you also re-examine me.

01:15:55.523 --> 01:16:05.731
Go and look at my track record and find my videos and find my quotes in the Washington Times and see on my website what I admit to, that I was fooled.

01:16:06.631 --> 01:16:13.777
I lost my job at the University of Pittsburgh because I wanted to speak out against transfection, but also,

01:16:14.915 --> 01:16:17.415
but also because I was convinced it was a lab leak.

01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:32.818
And that's what also made me so excited about telling everybody what I knew because it was that desperate that they were going to use this lab leak as an excuse to call transfection an investigational vaccine.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:36.199
And that's crazy because it's crazy.

01:16:36.919 --> 01:16:40.040
And that's about all I could say, but that's what I was saying.

01:16:42.259 --> 01:16:47.322
And I think all of us know, I think all of us have known, it's just how far are you willing to go?

01:16:47.882 --> 01:16:49.363
How far are you willing to accept it?

01:16:49.483 --> 01:16:51.724
I'm willing to go to the point where I will say,

01:16:52.887 --> 01:16:56.269
that I don't think that Donald Trump was shot.

01:16:56.569 --> 01:16:57.630
I think that that was fake.

01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:08.356
And I think that the people that were involved with it are the same people that are involved with controlling or getting Bobby Kennedy into the White House.

01:17:08.876 --> 01:17:11.798
There's a couple real obvious reasons why it was faked.

01:17:11.858 --> 01:17:12.679
The first one is,

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:17.640
that his sons have never bragged about either the lack of scar or the scar.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.081
We've never seen a picture of the scar or the lack of scar.

01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:23.601
And that's a very, very big problem.

01:17:24.981 --> 01:17:32.623
And if you see that for what it is, it doesn't even mean that Donald Trump necessarily has to, he could regret it now.

01:17:33.163 --> 01:17:38.164
It could have been something that he went along with not knowing exactly how bad it was gonna be or how bad it would be.

01:17:38.724 --> 01:17:53.246
But without a doubt, the fact of the matter is, is that a lot of these people, and get this in your heads, a lot of these people that were on the fear and cleavage site in 2020, a lot of these people that were on the spike protein in 2020,

01:17:54.568 --> 01:18:06.132
also spent three weeks after Donald Trump was shot to talk about how many shooters there were, and whether they were on the water tower or not, and whether the Secret Service was in on it.

01:18:06.393 --> 01:18:12.315
All of them were united in the discussion of that, and they all did it together.

01:18:13.175 --> 01:18:15.977
And that's not by accident or because of its current events.

01:18:16.017 --> 01:18:19.260
It's because that's how the narrative is curated on the internet.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.505
It's by a coordinated group of people that keeps us running forward and keeps us focused on the next thing.

01:18:27.005 --> 01:18:41.516
And if we allow that to happen, then we'll essentially miss the opportunity to, number one, remove our kids from social media, and number two, teach our kids and teach our current doctors that intramuscular injection is not all it's cracked up to be.

01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:42.497
In fact, it's pretty dumb.

01:18:44.264 --> 01:18:44.624
That's it.

01:18:46.045 --> 01:18:46.545
Okay.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.508
JJ, thank you for sharing.

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:54.431
Again, great work.

01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:58.213
Now, Stephen's going first set of questions.

01:18:58.313 --> 01:18:59.434
JJ, one problem.

01:18:59.994 --> 01:19:00.314
Oh, sure.

01:19:02.496 --> 01:19:03.717
I'm a former lawyer.

01:19:03.837 --> 01:19:04.977
I'm a legal strategist.

01:19:06.058 --> 01:19:09.060
I finished law school in 1973, so 51 years ago.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:09.200
And

01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:30.025
And the law courts have a problem, JJ, and I just bring it to people's attention that I have no problems with your proposition on criminality and murder.

01:19:30.285 --> 01:19:32.005
However, they need to be proven.

01:19:33.426 --> 01:19:42.128
And listening to you, I'm going, hmm, which experts do we bring before the courts to support the proposition?

01:19:42.188 --> 01:19:45.329
Because judges know shit from clay about what you've just been talking about.

01:19:46.909 --> 01:19:47.229
Okay.

01:19:48.129 --> 01:20:01.472
And I want everyone to understand, gosh, if you're a judge and not a biologist, and indeed, JJ, we've all been fooled, or as I said at the start, I've had 14 years of understanding this.

01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:05.713
And, you know, I love that's why we come here to express our views.

01:20:06.853 --> 01:20:08.494
What do we do with the judges?

01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:09.334
How do we get

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:11.339
a judge to understand.

01:20:11.419 --> 01:20:17.743
And I want you to think about this because we go, which experts can the courts rely upon?

01:20:18.604 --> 01:20:22.967
And if the experts have been bought, they've got great names.

01:20:23.007 --> 01:20:26.850
They can stand up there with all these qualifications and say, here's the expert.

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:30.332
And the judge says, I prefer Tom Cowan to JJ.

01:20:31.413 --> 01:20:32.173
And that's what they do.

01:20:33.614 --> 01:20:35.096
And it's a real problem for all of us.

01:20:35.176 --> 01:20:35.536
And so

01:20:37.447 --> 01:20:46.492
Think about this and Jay, it ties into what you're suggesting that we do our homework because here's the rule.

01:20:47.912 --> 01:20:51.894
The courts follow culture, they don't create culture.

01:20:52.675 --> 01:21:04.621
And so what we have to do is what you're saying is to, in the court of public opinion, so that the judges stop just listening to, choosing from a bunch of experts.

01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:18.810
And therefore, our knowledge around this, what you're encouraging us to do, is to learn this stuff so that we can talk to our neighbors, so that the court of public opinion says intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:19.370
Stop it.

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:28.495
And perhaps that leads to then the children of judges and the grandchildren of judges not being

01:21:29.153 --> 01:21:37.276
injected so that the judges are sitting there and really hammering any expert who says intramuscular injection is a good thing.

01:21:39.137 --> 01:21:39.837
Does that make sense?

01:21:40.037 --> 01:21:40.237
Yeah.

01:21:40.537 --> 01:21:49.881
This problem of competing experts for the judges and so and the judges will are influenced by by public opinion.

01:21:50.181 --> 01:21:54.643
And that's why demonstrations in front of courts happen because they work.

01:21:57.762 --> 01:22:06.851
Food for thought, everybody, because I want you to think about if you're going to court, which expert, based on what we've just heard today, which expert are we going to use?

01:22:07.251 --> 01:22:07.511
All right.

01:22:07.551 --> 01:22:08.993
That's what I wanted to say.

01:22:09.113 --> 01:22:16.700
It's somewhat of a rhetorical question, but it's a real problem because you can't prove something's criminal until the judge says it's criminal.

01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:18.181
All right.

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:24.855
Stephen next 15 minutes is yours, buddy And I can see your face how pretty with a tie.

01:22:24.915 --> 01:22:26.136
What's the story with a tie?

01:22:26.616 --> 01:22:39.001
I've never seen Stephen Frost with a tie Yeah, I do wear ties occasionally, especially when I was working in the military But anyway, otherwise it'll get through got thrown out of the officers mess but anyway

01:22:40.734 --> 01:22:51.244
JJ, so talking about these experts, so I think the expert who is trying to help the judges should be able to say there was no pandemic in the London.

01:22:53.326 --> 01:22:55.709
And furthermore, there was no COVID-19.

01:22:56.529 --> 01:23:02.195
That would really, and furthermore, it would be very helpful if people like Mark Bailey,

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:27.164
and others who maybe agree that they could say that they're medical doctors and they are experts in interpreting the as far as human beings are capable of analyzing everything interpreting a medical purported medical emergency and I think that

01:23:28.407 --> 01:23:30.274
You know, JJ, I'm a big fan of yours.

01:23:30.314 --> 01:23:34.128
I think it's obvious to you that there was no pandemic and that there was no COVID-19 even.

01:23:35.489 --> 01:23:58.746
though to me as a medical doctor that is absolutely well I can't say there's no doubt but I think I'm 90 10 saying that in my opinion as a medical doctor there was no pandemic and that is the most important message to the public and as Charles has just said we need to influence public opinion so saying that intramuscular injections are

01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:10.300
shouldn't, it's dumb, and also to say that, again, the function is mythology, the average member of the public doesn't understand that.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:21.210
So I think you're missing a trick by not simplifying it and saying the obvious stuff like there was no pandemic and there was no COVID-19, or at least that's extremely likely in my opinion.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:37.493
And until people are prepared to hypothesize without proving it beyond reasonable doubt, or beyond the balance of probabilities, or proving it as a scientist, we're never going to get out of this trap, because they are doing things.

01:24:38.034 --> 01:24:39.734
You were the one who suggested it to me.

01:24:40.214 --> 01:24:41.854
You said, gain of function.

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:45.795
This was about two years ago, and that really got me going.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:48.196
You gave me the idea that

01:24:49.776 --> 01:25:06.688
what they say they can do they're not capable of doing but it's enough to just say it to create the fear to get everybody into the matrix of a pandemic occurring every five years or whatever and the only people are going to be able to save us are the politicians who are advocating world government

01:25:07.108 --> 01:25:19.138
And we've just had the king of our country saying that we need to get rid of nation states, essentially, and we need to have world government.

01:25:19.238 --> 01:25:22.020
The guy is an absolute nutter, and he's our king.

01:25:23.101 --> 01:25:28.886
At least I live in a country where I can be confident that I won't be dragged off to prison for criticizing the king.

01:25:29.006 --> 01:25:31.768
Well, I think I can, tomorrow.

01:25:32.388 --> 01:25:43.177
So anyway, there are some good things about the UK, for example that, but the guy is an absolute tosser, Charles III.

01:25:45.313 --> 01:26:10.973
If let me just be a devil's advocate for a minute if if The the worst-case scenario stories from people like Catherine Watt are true and The US military has has killed people with toxins or kill boxes or whatever other operations that that they claim is here Would it would it be Would it be?

01:26:17.202 --> 01:26:21.365
then I guess I had it in my head and now I dropped it.

01:26:22.125 --> 01:26:32.052
I want you to consider that without the requisite knowledge, no matter what you say, there was no pandemic.

01:26:32.172 --> 01:26:33.293
It's not gonna be good enough.

01:26:33.433 --> 01:26:39.717
So in other words, let's say there's no war in Israel right now.

01:26:42.493 --> 01:26:44.394
You could say that because there isn't.

01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:47.116
There's no war in Israel right now.

01:26:47.276 --> 01:26:49.017
There's not a conflict going on.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:54.641
A lot of people don't even think what happened in October when they used hand gliders and stuff.

01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:56.442
A lot of people think that wasn't even real.

01:26:57.703 --> 01:27:00.645
But saying there's no war happening in Israel,

01:27:01.798 --> 01:27:07.923
is not really correct because there's people being murdered there and killed there and shooting and bombs all the time.

01:27:08.543 --> 01:27:10.104
So there's something happening there.

01:27:10.585 --> 01:27:21.412
And so I think that the very dangerous position of there is no pandemic is exactly what people like Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman said without

01:27:22.452 --> 01:27:27.134
any details, without any qualifications, without any description of what that meant.

01:27:27.595 --> 01:27:40.081
And what that did was that left people with all these images of Israel and all these images of dead bodies and all these news reports of bombs and fighting, and then these people over here saying there's no war in Israel.

01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:47.871
And I don't think that you can underestimate how dangerous that position was in 2020 and how dangerous it remains now.

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:50.212
Something very bad happened.

01:27:50.672 --> 01:27:52.473
It was a coordinated bad thing.

01:27:53.033 --> 01:27:58.455
And saying that there was no pandemic will turn a lot of people's brain off.

01:27:59.355 --> 01:28:01.958
And if I notice they have, sorry, go on, JJ.

01:28:01.998 --> 01:28:07.303
No, I just think that if you say something like intramuscular injection is dumb, at least they have to think about it.

01:28:07.423 --> 01:28:11.326
If you say there's no pandemic, they can, oh, there he is, another one of those guys.

01:28:11.366 --> 01:28:16.631
That's like saying, anti-vaxxer doesn't mean anything anymore without some level of nuance.

01:28:16.651 --> 01:28:20.074
But that's the response I used to get, but I don't get that response now.

01:28:20.435 --> 01:28:22.016
Okay.

01:28:22.657 --> 01:28:24.518
So once they hear that I'm a doctor,

01:28:25.539 --> 01:28:33.307
and that I look a bit serious about this subject, they actually want to listen because they are very doubtful themselves about what happened.

01:28:33.687 --> 01:28:35.469
They don't understand what happened.

01:28:35.909 --> 01:28:42.536
And nobody, as you rightly said, all these people who made great progress at the beginning in 2020 and 2021,

01:28:44.798 --> 01:28:48.220
They didn't do anything in the last three years, I agree with you.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.183
Why aren't they speaking out about this and saying people need to be held responsible?

01:28:52.583 --> 01:29:02.249
Why aren't people outside the COVID inquiry in the UK demonstrating and saying this is all nonsense and calling people out by name?

01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:10.774
Because actually they've all been encouraged to believe that it's all over now and we don't need to do anything because human beings are very lazy.

01:29:11.415 --> 01:29:12.996
So I do think that

01:29:14.212 --> 01:29:17.094
The public are incredibly confused about what's happened.

01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:24.200
They've been psychologically tortured by their own government, and they are actually mystified as to what happened.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:37.451
So someone coming along and planting a seed that there was no pandemic, and someone else coming along the same day and encouraging that seed to grow by saying the same thing, I think could work.

01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:38.892
Nothing else is going to work.

01:29:40.533 --> 01:29:41.413
expose these.

01:29:41.513 --> 01:29:42.974
We think these people are liars.

01:29:43.094 --> 01:29:44.314
I think they've lied about everything.

01:29:47.574 --> 01:29:47.834
Anyway.

01:29:49.875 --> 01:29:50.715
I know I'm with you.

01:29:51.815 --> 01:29:52.135
Okay.

01:29:52.435 --> 01:29:52.615
Yes.

01:29:53.536 --> 01:29:54.656
So go ahead, Charles.

01:29:54.696 --> 01:29:55.596
Let's let someone else.

01:29:55.636 --> 01:29:55.956
Okay.

01:29:56.136 --> 01:29:56.356
All right.

01:29:56.376 --> 01:29:57.776
We've got lots of hands up now.

01:29:57.796 --> 01:30:00.657
I'm concerned about the order of hands going up.

01:30:00.677 --> 01:30:05.398
You need to, everybody, please understand that Zoom plays tricks on us because

01:30:07.267 --> 01:30:10.529
I think Mark, or Anderson, Mark had their hands up first.

01:30:10.569 --> 01:30:15.551
Now, Thorbjorn, you're first, and on my screen, and it keeps chopping and changing.

01:30:15.591 --> 01:30:16.531
We'll be efficient.

01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:20.973
If you're efficient in your answers, Jay, then we'll get through them.

01:30:21.393 --> 01:30:25.675
Charles, you're the moderator, so I trust you to, but I will say this.

01:30:25.995 --> 01:30:27.116
JJ is the guest.

01:30:27.896 --> 01:30:31.897
And so he gets to decide whether he wants to answer the questions.

01:30:32.097 --> 01:30:37.158
If he doesn't want to ask the questions from Anders and Mark because they're aggressive, that's fine with me.

01:30:37.418 --> 01:30:38.398
He doesn't need to.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:38.958
It's fine.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:41.619
I won't lose my cool this time.

01:30:41.739 --> 01:30:43.659
And we're not having ad hominem attacks.

01:30:43.759 --> 01:30:45.300
Remember the distinction, everybody.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.420
You can express the view.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:54.922
And I agree, Stephen, with you that none of our guests have to answer any question like, you know, Jay, when did you stop masturbating?

01:30:55.811 --> 01:30:57.452
You know, that's the classic question.

01:30:57.512 --> 01:30:58.712
When did you stop beating him up?

01:30:58.732 --> 01:30:59.312
That's the problem.

01:30:59.532 --> 01:31:00.953
No, I'm joking, JJ.

01:31:02.753 --> 01:31:03.073
All right.

01:31:04.914 --> 01:31:07.915
On my screen, I've got Thorbjørn, then Anders, then Mark.

01:31:07.935 --> 01:31:08.775
So go, Thorbjørn.

01:31:08.875 --> 01:31:09.416
You go first.

01:31:09.876 --> 01:31:10.296
Thank you.

01:31:11.676 --> 01:31:16.778
First of all, there is this documentary called Watch the Waters.

01:31:17.858 --> 01:31:23.180
And that's what I've been doing for the last years.

01:31:23.981 --> 01:31:24.721
I'm coming from

01:31:28.225 --> 01:31:32.726
14 years of experience when it comes to nanotechnology.

01:31:39.989 --> 01:31:50.752
I don't like the word agendas and yet many people around the world are talking about the agenda that is moving from one year to another.

01:31:53.948 --> 01:32:05.550
the World Health Organization has been, they have an agenda and in their agenda on an official level, they're talking about

01:32:07.785 --> 01:32:11.469
how they're going to distribute their economics.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:22.941
And nanochemistry, nanophysics, nanotechnology is 17 out of 24 different issues.

01:32:23.682 --> 01:32:28.707
So nanotechnology is quite the core of the matter.

01:32:29.308 --> 01:32:29.428
And

01:32:31.264 --> 01:32:43.695
I have discovered what scientists, professors and medical doctors have found in a different way than all of these people.

01:32:44.996 --> 01:32:47.278
Namely, in nature, in raindrops.

01:32:50.234 --> 01:33:07.545
in drinking water, and it's far from being chloride or the usual things that we have more or less been aware of as not good for the health in the drinking water, that is.

01:33:08.843 --> 01:33:29.496
So, and there is quite some speculation on different usage of filters when it comes to buses, tramways and airplanes and so on, and the usage of filters will help a lot for the agenda to just spread

01:33:31.677 --> 01:33:38.939
nanochemistry through the filter because I know from experience how easy that is to just spread out.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:50.302
So JJ is spot on when he's talking about how easy it is to manipulate

01:33:53.823 --> 01:34:04.193
different RNA-based codes and why not some parasites and back and forth on that level.

01:34:04.313 --> 01:34:07.195
And it's actually called lipid nanoparticles.

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:18.226
It used to be a necessity to go through the process of what was used to call CRISPR technology.

01:34:19.087 --> 01:34:26.469
But now you can forget about the CRISPR technology because of lipid nanoparticles.

01:34:27.089 --> 01:34:29.509
They have a split nature.

01:34:30.449 --> 01:34:35.451
They're partially metallic and partially biological.

01:34:36.111 --> 01:34:40.392
And the biological spectrum of those particles

01:34:42.768 --> 01:34:45.170
are not good for health because they're all sick.

01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:55.279
They're all certainly not fitting into the immune system or the stem cells.

01:34:56.220 --> 01:35:01.524
And so they get kind of muted as soon as they get into the body.

01:35:01.764 --> 01:35:06.488
But it's not only through the vaccines, it's also in the air.

01:35:07.469 --> 01:35:07.769
And so

01:35:08.968 --> 01:35:30.265
I don't want to be the first one and certainly not the last one to talk about chemtrails, you know, but I have written a lot of texts where you're changing the point of view from chemtrails into nano chemical gases, because I've made them.

01:35:31.957 --> 01:35:50.169
Let's say, for example, that if I were to challenge people on this platform or any other platform, if the ladies and gentlemen have ever sat down and created graphene oxide and know what it means.

01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:51.710
That's just an example.

01:35:53.531 --> 01:35:57.774
The experience of having created graphene oxide

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.986
Well, there is two ways to do it.

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:06.720
Either you create graphene oxide using lead,

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.322
straight from the metal and black nanoparticles.

01:36:13.782 --> 01:36:15.923
That's how you create so-called oxide.

01:36:16.263 --> 01:36:17.203
It's not an oxide.

01:36:17.683 --> 01:36:20.184
It's trillions of nanocapsules.

01:36:20.284 --> 01:36:20.965
That's what it is.

01:36:21.905 --> 01:36:26.247
And that concerns all the other nanochemical oxides as well.

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:26.987
All of them.

01:36:27.307 --> 01:36:28.688
They are nanocapsules.

01:36:29.388 --> 01:36:32.929
They are the hidden enemy that the

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:39.892
the psychopaths or the Mengele guys are using.

01:36:40.512 --> 01:36:41.432
That's the trick.

01:36:42.813 --> 01:36:49.216
That covers and explains that the invisible enemy and the information war

01:36:50.393 --> 01:37:10.359
because if you can't speak the non-chemical language, then not professors that are more or less corrupt or any kind of AI mechanics will just tell you that you don't know what you're talking about.

01:37:10.539 --> 01:37:11.219
This is all wrong.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.700
just because you don't know the language.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:26.947
So what I did in order to make this more as simple as possible for the Norwegian people at least, and now my writings are coming up out in several languages, and that's been going on for many years now.

01:37:28.128 --> 01:37:30.989
Many years, I mean, the last two, three years.

01:37:31.809 --> 01:37:40.174
Well, I've studied and translated American patterns.

01:37:41.115 --> 01:37:42.095
And it's obvious.

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:43.416
It's in the patterns.

01:37:43.796 --> 01:37:48.258
You can see all kinds... Thorbjörn, hold that thought.

01:37:49.138 --> 01:37:54.120
Stephen, I think we should have Thorbjörn do a presentation to us, if this is so important.

01:37:54.521 --> 01:37:57.322
Because we've got a lot of questions and we're tight for time.

01:37:57.402 --> 01:38:02.144
So, Stephen, are you happy to present to us, Thorbjörn?

01:38:03.764 --> 01:38:04.405
Oh, I would...

01:38:05.948 --> 01:38:06.808
It will be my dream.

01:38:07.609 --> 01:38:07.949
Excellent.

01:38:07.989 --> 01:38:08.269
Great.

01:38:08.329 --> 01:38:13.712
So, Stephen, if you send Stephen your email in the chat, we'll talk about that.

01:38:13.952 --> 01:38:15.032
Do you have a question of JJ?

01:38:15.092 --> 01:38:16.513
Because we've got to keep moving through.

01:38:17.073 --> 01:38:23.656
Or you've shared the view on the lipid nanoparticles, the relevance of nanocapsules.

01:38:23.676 --> 01:38:25.257
I've taken a note of that.

01:38:25.717 --> 01:38:28.679
JJ, any comment or Thor Bjorn, is there a specific question?

01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:41.293
To end, I really have a question to JJ, and that is actually, what is his take on nanotechnology in medicine?

01:38:43.856 --> 01:38:47.200
I think I would stick with just what I said in the talk.

01:38:49.864 --> 01:38:58.011
First of all, they have to have access to you, so if you don't let them inject you, then nanos, for a lot of reasons, are not that big of a danger.

01:38:58.071 --> 01:39:11.463
I understand that they could deploy them in many ways and put them in food or other things like that, but I think intramuscular injection is a particularly diabolical way to put things into people's bodies that cannot be

01:39:12.558 --> 01:39:14.520
you can't get a better way in.

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:26.088
So for me, all the other ways in are less dangerous and certainly will be harder for them to get away with and harder for them to achieve what they would want to achieve.

01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:37.157
I think nanotechnology and medicine is for the most part still kind of a pipe dream and I could just be naive, but we have to be very careful

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:51.123
to allow people to create things that are not that different from chemicals or from proteins or from, I mean, if you engineer a protein and the protein moves, is that a nanomachine or is it a protein?

01:39:53.022 --> 01:40:01.465
If you make an antibody that can spin because of the nature of its chemical bonds, does that make it a nanomachine instead of a protein?

01:40:01.585 --> 01:40:10.950
And for me, a lot of this is creating a semantic, as you just said, if you don't know the words, then all of this stuff will go over your head.

01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:27.657
And more importantly, if you learn the definition of those words and all of those words are nonsense, then just like I was in 2020 arguing about coronaviruses and flu viruses and how they work, I was arguing for them.

01:40:27.877 --> 01:40:34.659
And it is very, very possible that right now, most of the arguments about nanomedicine are

01:40:38.877 --> 01:40:40.799
are traps in one way or another.

01:40:41.059 --> 01:40:50.348
And again, if nanomedicine is coming, we can fight it by not allowing intramuscular injection to be a way of administering medicine.

01:40:50.368 --> 01:40:56.895
And if nano things are coming, then it's even more important for us to understand that there was a brief period of time when they

01:40:57.515 --> 01:41:16.808
Needed to murder people in order to manage the problem and we don't want to skip that problem We don't want to skip that part of the story We have to tell that part of the story and then they're using that to bring in all of these technologies to encourage people to develop them to move all of the piles of money around that support these ideas going from theory to practice and so

01:41:17.548 --> 01:41:21.309
Again, I'm not, I don't want to take a stance on whether it's fake or not.

01:41:21.389 --> 01:41:31.452
I definitely agree that these people would love to have this technology, are willing to invest years and invest in human experiments in order to get these technologies to work.

01:41:31.972 --> 01:41:34.532
And so, of course, the overarching

01:41:36.753 --> 01:41:44.596
Message that I've been saying is that they're trying to invert our sovereignty into test animal subjects as status And so this would go right along with it.

01:41:44.616 --> 01:41:48.417
They're not going to be able to develop nanotechnology without us being the experimental animal.

01:41:48.577 --> 01:41:51.598
So I Agree, and I'd love to hear you give a talk.

01:41:52.078 --> 01:41:56.040
I just want to know where Charles Are you blocking me and mark to be on the show?

01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:58.820
Will you shut up and as your next?

01:42:00.601 --> 01:42:03.242
I just asked you because I was just shut up for I

01:42:04.704 --> 01:42:05.985
Don't ask stupid questions.

01:42:06.945 --> 01:42:10.668
Thorbjørn, thank you, JJ, on that comment.

01:42:10.888 --> 01:42:12.489
Anders, you are being objectionable.

01:42:13.009 --> 01:42:13.690
Behave yourself.

01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:18.213
Thorbjørn, I'd love you to share your knowledge in this group.

01:42:18.973 --> 01:42:20.974
Anders, I said you are next, then Mark.

01:42:21.815 --> 01:42:22.075
Go.

01:42:27.799 --> 01:42:31.161
Thank you very much for allowing me to be coming here.

01:42:31.181 --> 01:42:34.123
I would say that I was

01:42:35.576 --> 01:42:48.969
on this show a little while ago and I had a talk with JJ and he called me not an honest man, which was a bit of an offense to me.

01:42:48.989 --> 01:42:52.592
I will not go against that now, Charles.

01:42:53.713 --> 01:42:56.836
I would say that I'm working very closely.

01:42:56.856 --> 01:43:00.380
Don't, because deal with the questions, deal with the issues.

01:43:01.294 --> 01:43:03.435
Yes, yes, I will, I will.

01:43:03.495 --> 01:43:04.475
We're not bothered about it.

01:43:04.495 --> 01:43:29.267
I will say that I will say Charles that I'm working very closely with Robert Young and we are about to publish our understanding of what is the, let's say, connection between the, let's say, the magnetic

01:43:31.363 --> 01:43:35.624
toxins in the vaccines and the 4G, 5G.

01:43:36.504 --> 01:43:42.665
And this interfaction has been denied by JJ earlier.

01:43:42.885 --> 01:43:57.988
And this is a concern because this is the most important issue of the killing mechanisms, which me and Mark agree on, which is that this

01:44:01.059 --> 01:44:06.822
if you have a magnetic shoulder after vaccination, it is an evidence there is something bad happening.

01:44:07.042 --> 01:44:10.864
And what we see is that a lot of people are dying.

01:44:12.025 --> 01:44:29.374
And if you people don't want to understand the seriousness of that 17 million people have died and about four to eight, 900 million people have been wounded,

01:44:29.974 --> 01:44:33.736
that you need to reconsider what the hell is going on.

01:44:33.916 --> 01:44:36.798
And I would say, this is facts.

01:44:37.398 --> 01:44:38.198
These are facts.

01:44:39.579 --> 01:44:44.042
And if you don't want to realize these facts, it's not really my problem.

01:44:44.582 --> 01:44:45.983
So what's the question then, Anders?

01:44:47.343 --> 01:44:59.610
The question is, you need to realize, Steven, that you are in this group subverting the

01:45:01.169 --> 01:45:03.330
facts of what is really going on.

01:45:04.811 --> 01:45:05.671
That's not a question.

01:45:05.691 --> 01:45:11.534
And Stephen, you are actually, Charles, you are really suppressing the facts.

01:45:12.675 --> 01:45:13.375
No one answers.

01:45:13.535 --> 01:45:14.396
Ask the question.

01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:16.217
I'm not interested in your opinion.

01:45:18.318 --> 01:45:21.479
Is this group part of the deep state or what?

01:45:21.699 --> 01:45:22.620
Yes, absolutely.

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.560
Don't be ridiculous.

01:45:25.245 --> 01:45:27.166
You are stupid to ask that question.

01:45:27.566 --> 01:45:36.271
You need to realize you are subject to this question because this question must come to you.

01:45:36.411 --> 01:45:45.475
Anders, do you think that I'm misleading people when I say that there was a population pyramid?

01:45:45.495 --> 01:45:48.357
You know, JJ, if you look into your

01:45:48.797 --> 01:45:57.889
Chinese statement in a peer-reviewed report from March 2021, you are supporting the idea that there was a virus from Wuhan.

01:45:58.009 --> 01:45:59.191
Do you agree or do you not?

01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:04.930
I have admitted many times that in the beginning of this pandemic, I was fooled like everyone else.

01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:06.571
You're not dunking on me here.

01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:10.152
It says that on my website.

01:46:10.492 --> 01:46:12.232
It says it on my website.

01:46:12.372 --> 01:46:14.953
It was part of the illusion, my friend.

01:46:15.033 --> 01:46:16.573
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:46:16.973 --> 01:46:18.794
They caught people like me in it.

01:46:19.554 --> 01:46:26.585
And you're trying to somehow or another undermine my confession and try to make it seem like I'm trying to sabotage.

01:46:27.126 --> 01:46:30.270
I'm trying to admit that I was as fooled as anyone.

01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:35.057
In fact, I was so fooled that I am the expert in this book.

01:46:36.078 --> 01:46:41.239
And I feel like a jackass for being the expert in this book, but some of you, you don't get it.

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:46.241
You don't get that I've been saying that for the last two years or you're trying not to get it.

01:46:46.281 --> 01:46:51.642
You're trying to obfuscate that idea and trying to make it about 5G or something else.

01:46:51.682 --> 01:46:53.963
Now listen carefully, I'm gonna give you a chance.

01:46:55.017 --> 01:47:21.672
Do you think that I'm misleading people when I suggest that Great Britain and Scotland and the Netherlands and Germany and America all had a population pyramid problem of old people that needed managing and that they murdered them in order to create this illusion that may very well be to roll out 5G technology, but in order to do it, they murdered people that needed managing.

01:47:21.752 --> 01:47:23.893
Do you disagree with that or not?

01:47:26.838 --> 01:47:27.939
You are muted, Anders.

01:47:27.959 --> 01:47:29.139
Do you see how this works?

01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:35.463
Do you agree that intramuscular injection is dumb and that all of us should have known it before the pandemic?

01:47:36.103 --> 01:47:38.625
Or do you think I'm misleading people with that statement?

01:47:42.067 --> 01:47:43.307
Anders, you are muted.

01:47:43.527 --> 01:47:45.188
It's just amateur hour here.

01:47:46.329 --> 01:47:46.829
Come on.

01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:49.811
We're all trying to get to the truth.

01:47:49.871 --> 01:47:51.752
We all suffered.

01:47:52.072 --> 01:47:52.953
It's ridiculous.

01:47:54.537 --> 01:47:57.759
Charles, move on to the next question, if you wish.

01:48:03.503 --> 01:48:10.808
Anders, if you don't know that you're muted and you keep talking away when no one can hear you, you shouldn't be on a Zoom meeting.

01:48:10.968 --> 01:48:12.649
You shouldn't be on a Zoom meeting, Anders.

01:48:13.469 --> 01:48:14.090
What's your screen?

01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:23.216
I'm happy for the answer, but I must say that it is a question which should be asked and

01:48:24.103 --> 01:48:37.554
I am really interesting to know this group because... So you're also saying, right, Anders, you're also saying, right, that they didn't murder people in the hospitals, they murdered people with 5G, right?

01:48:37.614 --> 01:48:39.255
No, I never said that.

01:48:39.455 --> 01:48:40.176
I never said that.

01:48:40.236 --> 01:48:42.437
So what did 5G cause?

01:48:42.618 --> 01:48:43.959
What did 5G cause?

01:48:44.019 --> 01:48:46.060
The sickness that people say was strange?

01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:47.862
Or what did the 5G do?

01:48:48.789 --> 01:48:49.729
And where did it do it?

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:53.671
Is it in proximity to certain towers that they turned on or was it just everywhere?

01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:58.913
Can you develop this a little bit farther or is it really just trying to cover up?

01:48:59.473 --> 01:49:01.273
Are you trying to cover up the fact?

01:49:01.834 --> 01:49:08.096
JJ, I'm about to release a peer-reviewed paper along with Robert Young.

01:49:09.517 --> 01:49:11.499
I got the email this morning.

01:49:11.579 --> 01:49:14.021
And don't try to tell me that I'm a joke.

01:49:14.401 --> 01:49:17.123
I got the email this morning.

01:49:17.143 --> 01:49:18.545
Charles, this is not going anywhere.

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:19.445
Nobody said that.

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:27.712
I'm just waiting for you to address any points instead of just making the points you made last time, which were, again, we addressed them the same way.

01:49:27.752 --> 01:49:30.234
The point was that you called me a liar last time.

01:49:30.394 --> 01:49:30.675
Yes.

01:49:30.695 --> 01:49:31.736
And that's not acceptable.

01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:35.799
Anders, we're going to Mark.

01:49:37.426 --> 01:49:38.468
I'm not going back there.

01:49:38.608 --> 01:49:40.190
Mark, you're next.

01:49:42.413 --> 01:49:43.294
I think it was Mark.

01:49:43.314 --> 01:49:45.918
I think it was actually Mark that I called the liar.

01:49:46.078 --> 01:49:46.659
I didn't call.

01:49:46.719 --> 01:49:48.221
I don't think I called anyone a liar.

01:49:48.301 --> 01:49:49.903
I called Mark a liar.

01:49:50.204 --> 01:49:52.387
JJ called me the liar, not Anders.

01:49:52.567 --> 01:49:53.208
Yeah, that's right.

01:49:54.241 --> 01:49:58.543
And what I want to understand is what were the lines that you thought I was telling you?

01:49:58.563 --> 01:49:59.244
No, we're not going there.

01:49:59.264 --> 01:50:00.404
We're not going there.

01:50:00.444 --> 01:50:02.045
You guys can have a conversation about it.

01:50:02.785 --> 01:50:04.906
Mark, what's your question this time?

01:50:05.227 --> 01:50:08.828
The question is, well, I want to put it straight to JJ, right?

01:50:09.149 --> 01:50:12.810
The 5G is instrumental in this kill, right?

01:50:12.911 --> 01:50:17.413
Now, we know he's spoken about the vaccines and how they're dangerous.

01:50:17.593 --> 01:50:18.313
I get that.

01:50:18.613 --> 01:50:19.994
No, I'm not talking about that.

01:50:20.054 --> 01:50:20.995
I don't care about that.

01:50:22.162 --> 01:50:23.263
I don't care about that.

01:50:23.903 --> 01:50:24.963
JJ, let me speak.

01:50:24.983 --> 01:50:26.964
You're putting words in my mouth.

01:50:27.084 --> 01:50:28.505
Just ask the question.

01:50:28.585 --> 01:50:29.905
You're putting the words in my mouth.

01:50:29.925 --> 01:50:30.846
Just ask the question.

01:50:30.886 --> 01:50:32.086
You called us a liar.

01:50:32.306 --> 01:50:34.367
You called me a liar.

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:36.268
I did.

01:50:36.288 --> 01:50:37.088
I did.

01:50:37.188 --> 01:50:39.929
We're not interested in who called who a liar.

01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:43.591
Well, what was I lying about?

01:50:45.892 --> 01:50:47.213
Listen, ask the question.

01:50:47.253 --> 01:50:48.353
What's the question you want to ask?

01:50:48.373 --> 01:50:50.054
JJ, listen to the question.

01:50:51.909 --> 01:50:52.610
I think you're right.

01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:53.512
I think you're right.

01:50:53.692 --> 01:50:54.553
I think you're right.

01:50:54.593 --> 01:50:58.339
Contamination in the vaccine is interconnected with 5G for the kill.

01:51:06.824 --> 01:51:09.747
You called me a liar for saying that.

01:51:10.067 --> 01:51:10.968
Can you explain?

01:51:11.368 --> 01:51:12.769
Do you know what's in the vaccine?

01:51:13.329 --> 01:51:15.972
And do you actually know what 5G actually is?

01:51:16.452 --> 01:51:20.315
You also made a statement about optical radiation being safe.

01:51:20.836 --> 01:51:22.737
I'm not saying that's nonsense in all my life.

01:51:23.097 --> 01:51:30.984
So can you just explain what your knowledge base is of 5G or light-emitting diodes?

01:51:32.235 --> 01:51:39.741
And so again, here we are trying to impose some kind of weird, what is your expertise?

01:51:39.781 --> 01:51:46.706
So you're using two words together, optical radiation, which I think is just two words that actually mean light.

01:51:47.346 --> 01:51:54.952
And you're trying to use it in a specific way, meaning that if you use certain frequencies in combination, then you can make people psycho and crazy.

01:51:54.992 --> 01:51:57.113
And that's probably true in a laboratory setting.

01:51:57.613 --> 01:51:59.615
However, the idea

01:52:00.402 --> 01:52:18.013
that 5G and all these other things are responsible for the kill when we know that the simple lack of antibiotics, the application of supplemental oxygen, the lack of even giving people water, the horrible abuses that happened in the hospital are how people were killed.

01:52:18.513 --> 01:52:24.417
That's the reason why most of the old people that died were past the years of life expectancy.

01:52:24.837 --> 01:52:26.037
It was murder first.

01:52:26.178 --> 01:52:46.770
And what I think you're lying about or being misled about by people who are lying to you is that this 5G thing could have some seminal role in what happened here instead of just a bunch of people lying about virology and molecular biology and the population pyramid that they needed to murder people.

01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:52.012
in order to save that these Western economies from crashing.

01:52:52.072 --> 01:52:59.174
And you spending your time asking me what I know about LEDs and what my knowledge base is, I'm on PubMed.

01:52:59.634 --> 01:53:04.276
I've got 15 years of publication to tell you exactly what my expertise is.

01:53:04.716 --> 01:53:07.497
I've had faculty positions at several universities.

01:53:07.917 --> 01:53:09.898
This track record is available for you.

01:53:10.458 --> 01:53:14.520
can find exactly what I know and you know exactly what you don't know.

01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:19.742
And that's why you use terms like optical radiation and think you're dunking on someone.

01:53:19.862 --> 01:53:21.763
It's kind of scary actually.

01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:28.486
You should really consider who's teaching you this stuff and reconsider what their loyalties might be.

01:53:28.526 --> 01:53:36.850
Because I think just like with the batches, you've been misled by people and misled very badly into believing that you know something that's really crucial.

01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:38.451
when it's very simple.

01:53:38.651 --> 01:53:44.374
Intramuscular injection is dumb and they needed to murder people in order to make us teach it to our kids.

01:53:45.915 --> 01:53:49.637
I think, well, let me just, you know, progress this.

01:53:50.758 --> 01:53:57.041
In New York, people are suffering from pulmiedema, that was flooding the lung, all right, like altitude sickness.

01:53:57.842 --> 01:54:00.303
Electromagnetic radiation causes that.

01:54:00.971 --> 01:54:14.942
So this is one of the main symptoms from electromagnetic radiation pollution and you're trying to tell me with your lack of knowledge in relation to electromagnetic radiation pollution that that wasn't the case.

01:54:15.546 --> 01:54:15.766
Good.

01:54:16.046 --> 01:54:16.947
Mark, stop.

01:54:17.247 --> 01:54:19.268
We are not having an EMR discussion.

01:54:19.288 --> 01:54:20.209
You've made the point.

01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:21.429
JJ's answered.

01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:22.550
You've made the comment.

01:54:23.591 --> 01:54:25.111
We've had numerous presentations.

01:54:25.171 --> 01:54:26.252
Mark, you've presented twice.

01:54:26.412 --> 01:54:27.653
Anders has presented twice.

01:54:28.253 --> 01:54:29.214
You've made the point.

01:54:29.774 --> 01:54:30.294
On we go.

01:54:30.354 --> 01:54:31.295
We're running out of time.

01:54:31.555 --> 01:54:31.895
Thank you.

01:54:32.335 --> 01:54:32.776
Teresa.

01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:36.358
Thank you, Charles.

01:54:36.378 --> 01:54:39.099
Sorry, JJ.

01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:44.444
Oh, God bless you, fella.

01:54:44.925 --> 01:54:45.848
That's hilarious.

01:54:46.549 --> 01:54:47.231
Theresa.

01:54:48.433 --> 01:54:49.295
Okay, thank you.

01:54:50.737 --> 01:54:51.558
Thank you, JJ.

01:54:52.158 --> 01:54:55.901
I missed the beginning, so I'll go back and catch it on the Rumble channel.

01:54:56.121 --> 01:54:59.163
But everything was really great that you've been saying.

01:54:59.844 --> 01:55:00.564
I agree with you.

01:55:00.744 --> 01:55:02.906
I'm a bit dubious about Trump's assassination.

01:55:03.306 --> 01:55:09.771
It's strange that RFK has appointed Huff that makes it look like we're going to go down the leak path, which is really worrying.

01:55:10.391 --> 01:55:10.691
I agree.

01:55:10.731 --> 01:55:11.612
Of course we are.

01:55:11.652 --> 01:55:13.853
He's also going to provide safe vaccines.

01:55:13.894 --> 01:55:14.514
You know that, right?

01:55:14.534 --> 01:55:16.675
He's going to test them and they're going to work out great.

01:55:16.716 --> 01:55:17.876
He's going to clean these up.

01:55:17.956 --> 01:55:18.657
It's going to be awesome.

01:55:19.528 --> 01:55:21.048
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm seeing it.

01:55:21.108 --> 01:55:21.708
I'm seeing it.

01:55:21.889 --> 01:55:27.730
And I also agree with you that RNA can't pandemic and the intramuscular injections are done.

01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.710
Now.

01:55:32.071 --> 01:55:33.191
I have to say I was sick.

01:55:33.971 --> 01:55:36.231
I was sick with something in 2019.

01:55:36.752 --> 01:55:42.373
And I was sick again with something after I went to an anti-vax conference in 2022.

01:55:43.733 --> 01:55:44.733
I was hallucinating.

01:55:45.733 --> 01:55:46.333
I couldn't move.

01:55:46.534 --> 01:55:47.134
It was horrible.

01:55:47.854 --> 01:55:48.594
I don't think I

01:55:49.218 --> 01:55:52.641
had a virus, I think I was poisoned.

01:55:52.661 --> 01:55:54.603
A lot of people were sick after that conference.

01:55:56.364 --> 01:56:01.148
Coming on to my question, it concerns the cancer that we're seeing.

01:56:02.309 --> 01:56:10.876
I don't have many friends, you can imagine, but of the friends I do have, half of them have a loved one or themselves with cancer.

01:56:11.036 --> 01:56:17.622
I've already lost a friend and also an acquaintance from what I would call turbo cancer.

01:56:18.444 --> 01:56:20.884
They were both unvaccinated.

01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:31.446
I've got about six people on my radar now, loved ones, friends, who have got sudden onset cancer, quite often stage three or stage four.

01:56:32.647 --> 01:56:36.347
All but one are unvaccinated.

01:56:36.987 --> 01:56:42.828
I spoke to a lady who is a cancer surgeon in the United States.

01:56:42.928 --> 01:56:46.669
She's running a trial with ivermectin and fenbendazole as a treatment for cancer.

01:56:47.518 --> 01:56:53.864
she told me that half of her turbo cancer patients are unvaccinated.

01:56:54.585 --> 01:57:05.555
There are certain physicians now saying that something is shedding from the vaccine injured onto the unvaccinated and making them sick.

01:57:05.975 --> 01:57:11.180
It kind of tallies because four of the friends that I know with cancer were working with the vaccine injured

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:21.466
you know, a GP, a herbalist, an acupuncturist who said that she was getting rashes on her arms after treating people with vaccine injury.

01:57:22.507 --> 01:57:27.630
And I'm just wondering, what would be your take on that?

01:57:27.730 --> 01:57:33.794
What do you think might be causing this rash of what can only be described as turbo cancer?

01:57:33.814 --> 01:57:36.816
Because of these friends and close friends of friends,

01:57:39.396 --> 01:57:42.178
They're dying from diagnosis to death.

01:57:42.358 --> 01:57:44.900
They're like three weeks, four weeks.

01:57:46.261 --> 01:57:51.125
I've got a friend who's been diagnosed with stage four cancer and he feels fine.

01:57:51.385 --> 01:57:53.767
He doesn't even, you know, he had prostate cancer.

01:57:53.807 --> 01:57:54.887
How did he get to stage four?

01:57:54.927 --> 01:57:56.869
He doesn't even feel sick.

01:57:58.850 --> 01:58:00.852
What's going on there, JJ?

01:58:01.372 --> 01:58:05.975
So I'm not a medical doctor, so this is really just shooting in a barrel here, but

01:58:07.298 --> 01:58:18.124
You know, this this for me would be a much more plausible reason for Anders and for Mark Steele to be arguing about 5G as a causing these cancers.

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:26.149
And in fact, it makes perfect sense to me that that one of the best ways to roll out something, especially because, again,

01:58:27.009 --> 01:58:36.457
I made this point the last time when Mark was here last week, that you should be arguing about the phones then, because the phone is transmitting this shit right next to your head.

01:58:36.958 --> 01:58:42.823
And so if 5G is a problem, then the handheld 5G receptors transmitter might be the worst of all of it.

01:58:43.323 --> 01:58:49.008
And so they seem to be talking about when the towers were turned on, but the towers need to talk to something.

01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:56.312
I just still can't get my head around the idea that we're giving our kids these phones when they're five or six or seven years old.

01:58:56.812 --> 01:59:05.597
And so for me, again, we're obfuscating the idea that there has to be one cause of these turbo cancers.

01:59:05.937 --> 01:59:09.379
If you got a hot transfection, maybe you get turbo cancer.

01:59:09.779 --> 01:59:17.083
But if you have a new iPhone 14 and the right towers in your city, I don't know, maybe you get a glioma from that.

01:59:17.563 --> 01:59:26.948
The gliomas that people are getting, I don't think you can blame that on the vaccine because it's not very likely that the transfection is going to make it into your glial cells.

01:59:28.248 --> 01:59:30.729
It's going to go somewhere else before it makes it there.

01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:35.352
And yet, you know, if you're holding the phone up to your head all day.

01:59:35.872 --> 01:59:38.733
So for me, I don't have any easy answers.

01:59:41.659 --> 01:59:48.408
I assure you that what they're putting in all of the shots, not just the COVID shots, can potentially be manipulated.

01:59:48.869 --> 01:59:55.378
And so again, I'm not saying that some of the people aren't experiencing some of the things that they're experiencing, but

01:59:56.599 --> 02:00:16.086
What I hear when Anders talks or when I hear when Mark talks is a gross overgeneralization where just like saying there's a pandemic that killed 17 million people, you generalize and say that 5G killed all those people or that all these cancers can be explained by the shot.

02:00:16.266 --> 02:00:21.088
And that's a very, very dangerous tactic.

02:00:21.148 --> 02:00:21.408
I think

02:00:22.408 --> 02:00:30.815
You've got to cast the widest net possible, and I think any explanation that fits is fine with me.

02:00:30.855 --> 02:00:36.740
We're all exposed to so much that maybe it's just all coming to a head now.

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:38.262
Maybe we're diagnosing better.

02:00:38.722 --> 02:00:39.983
Maybe doctors are doing it.

02:00:42.859 --> 02:00:45.501
I got to say, there's going to be an explanation.

02:00:45.541 --> 02:00:46.261
We're going to find it.

02:00:46.341 --> 02:01:00.449
And what you started with, which again, with Anders and with Mark and with Sasha Latapova and with Catherine Watt and any of these other people, the idea that they could have poisoned people in some places is, of course, plausible.

02:01:01.321 --> 02:01:10.709
The idea that they would have used different means of creating the same confusion in different places is not only plausible, but very likely from a military perspective.

02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:18.295
You wouldn't want to roll out the same toxin at an anti-vax conference as you did in the subways of New York, or there might be some connection there.

02:01:18.815 --> 02:01:36.527
But if you could roll out something that irritated the lungs in New York and something that rolled out that that irritated the lungs and made you hallucinate in somewhere else, and then roll out something that made people have stomach flu elsewhere, and everything could be described as COVID, well, that's all the better for this military PSYOP.

02:01:36.567 --> 02:01:37.988
So for me, the

02:01:39.494 --> 02:01:47.740
I would err on the side of caution and keep your mind open, but turbo cancers are definitely something that seem to be universally acknowledged as new.

02:01:49.021 --> 02:01:51.522
And that I think is quite significant.

02:01:51.562 --> 02:01:57.827
Now what's causing them, especially when you, I know you're not making this up and telling me that these people are not vaccinated, I'm sure they're not.

02:01:58.787 --> 02:02:02.250
I'm also sure that in certain scenarios, shedding has to happen.

02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:03.711
The question is, what are they shedding?

02:02:04.332 --> 02:02:07.595
I don't think it's guaranteed they're shedding a spike protein.

02:02:07.635 --> 02:02:13.560
They could be shedding a toxin that was designed by DITRA or by the U.S.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:15.361
military to cause irritation.

02:02:15.421 --> 02:02:15.882
I don't know.

02:02:15.902 --> 02:02:26.150
I mean, they tell us it's a spike protein and that it's made after this sequence in Wuhan, but none of us has the ability to sequence that RNA and verify what protein is being produced.

02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:29.432
for sure they can produce different batches.

02:02:29.552 --> 02:02:38.617
I mean, placebo batches, batches that are nasty and cause one thing and nasty and cause another and it wouldn't need to be very fancy.

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:44.660
It's just, you know, make this RNA and we know what that RNA does and make this RNA and know what this RNA does.

02:02:46.053 --> 02:02:48.995
I, uh, well, yeah, anyway, I don't want to give too long of an answer.

02:02:49.015 --> 02:02:50.395
I hope that that said something.

02:02:50.735 --> 02:02:51.816
I don't really have a good answer.

02:02:51.856 --> 02:02:52.496
I'm not an MD.

02:02:52.536 --> 02:02:57.379
I just know that these turbo cancers, we're going to keep moving because we're tight on time.

02:02:58.119 --> 02:03:00.981
Teresa, it's a, it's an excellent question.

02:03:01.021 --> 02:03:05.163
And the point that I raise and raise again, look at all the people on this call.

02:03:05.203 --> 02:03:05.483
We are.

02:03:06.610 --> 02:03:09.012
Each not only unique, but weirdos.

02:03:09.392 --> 02:03:16.137
And I say each one of you on this call is a weirdo and each one of your bodies functions uniquely and weirdly.

02:03:16.678 --> 02:03:25.144
And this mad idea of EBM and protocols is such bullshit that every one of us is a simple proposition.

02:03:25.184 --> 02:03:26.926
When I say to people I've been presenting

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:30.208
I've been presenting for 31 years as a professional speaker.

02:03:30.248 --> 02:03:34.150
When I say to people, you are not the same as the people beside you, everyone agrees.

02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:36.511
And yet we have this stupidity.

02:03:36.551 --> 02:03:38.853
So perhaps that's an angle, Jay, in terms of culture.

02:03:39.093 --> 02:03:45.237
We stop saying that we accept evidence-based medicine and protocols.

02:03:45.717 --> 02:03:47.559
That's all we have to do, just talk shit.

02:03:47.839 --> 02:03:50.781
I'm a human, I'm an individual, as the classic line goes.

02:03:50.881 --> 02:03:51.842
Thank you, Teresa.

02:03:52.182 --> 02:03:52.823
Johnny's next.

02:03:53.123 --> 02:03:54.564
And Johnny's certainly a weirdo.

02:03:54.864 --> 02:03:57.106
He's the weirdest of the weirdos that we have here.

02:03:57.386 --> 02:03:57.687
Jay?

02:03:59.628 --> 02:04:00.149
Thanks for that.

02:04:02.170 --> 02:04:09.056
JJ, can you back up and tell me how Jessica Rose fits into this again?

02:04:11.107 --> 02:04:14.929
kind of, I don't know, I'm kind of having, I'm missing where she fits.

02:04:15.389 --> 02:04:16.730
I do know who she is.

02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:33.097
I did write about her in my books, and she was, you know, her statistical analysis was very helpful in, I think, proving that vaccines were causing harm, but where did she go wrong with you?

02:04:33.117 --> 02:04:35.358
Because I just, I don't know, I'm not seeing it.

02:04:39.176 --> 02:04:48.472
She was in a stream with me and Kevin McKernan when I explained how virology is faked using infectious clones.

02:04:49.608 --> 02:05:10.329
and how they could manufacture infinite quantities of DNA that would be perfect PCR positives and put them wherever they wanted to, whenever they wanted to, and find them however they wanted to with very high fidelity, and even fool the Chinese into thinking they found a sequence when it could have easily just been produced by very normal commercial means and then just spilled somewhere.

02:05:11.892 --> 02:05:16.494
And she actually stated in that that was a you can find it on rumble.

02:05:16.574 --> 02:05:18.855
It was on St.

02:05:18.895 --> 02:05:19.916
Patrick's Day in 2023.

02:05:20.476 --> 02:05:22.196
So that would be March 17th, I think.

02:05:23.757 --> 02:05:25.298
And John Baldwin was the host.

02:05:25.398 --> 02:05:35.862
Kevin McKernan tried to misconstrue what I meant by infectious clones and that I are you suggesting that they seeded this and that it spread?

02:05:35.922 --> 02:05:37.903
And I said, no, I'm not saying that it's spread.

02:05:37.983 --> 02:05:40.884
I'm saying that if they wanted to find a sequence somewhere, they could find it.

02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:47.755
And if they wanted to characterize a background signal and then say they found something new, they could also do that.

02:05:48.276 --> 02:05:58.926
And since all of these things are proprietary and virology is essentially based on this recombinant DNA, then a lot of what the no virus people say is right.

02:05:59.426 --> 02:06:01.288
And that was all part of that discussion.

02:06:01.368 --> 02:06:06.072
And after that is the last time Jessica Rose ever acknowledged that I existed.

02:06:07.539 --> 02:06:09.681
So she was kind of her bailiwick, basically.

02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:11.643
I mean, she knows.

02:06:11.863 --> 02:06:25.974
She actually, in that talk, if you go and listen to it on Rumble, she's the one who encourages me to go back to an earlier slide deck and get my slide with the mixtape analogy so that I could explain why RNA cannot pandemic.

02:06:26.875 --> 02:06:34.041
She actually said, wow, the idea that you explained to us was so crazy that it kept me up all night.

02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:36.122
You got to explain it the way you explained it then.

02:06:36.929 --> 02:06:42.566
And so after that talk, Kevin McKernan said that I was chemtrail retarded.

02:06:43.755 --> 02:06:45.856
Jessica Rose never mentioned me again.

02:06:46.236 --> 02:06:48.657
Stephanie Seneff never mentioned me ever.

02:06:49.157 --> 02:06:54.859
John Bodwin says that he's afraid of me now because apparently I yelled at him on the phone too loud.

02:06:55.299 --> 02:07:01.301
And so all of these people just vanished after I finally was able to succinctly explain.

02:07:01.741 --> 02:07:02.761
And what did I explain?

02:07:03.381 --> 02:07:06.622
Very succinctly that it was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:07:06.662 --> 02:07:09.123
who asked me to teach him what infectious clones were.

02:07:09.163 --> 02:07:11.124
And three weeks later, I knew it was a lie.

02:07:11.784 --> 02:07:23.814
And I explained it to him to the best of my ability, so much so that he put me on the Defender podcast with Jessica Rose and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Tess Laurie.

02:07:23.894 --> 02:07:27.197
And they all pretended not to understand what I was saying.

02:07:27.237 --> 02:07:28.538
And they still do today.

02:07:28.958 --> 02:07:30.880
Just another player on Team Enigma.

02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:31.580
I got it.

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:32.641
OK, thank you.

02:07:32.661 --> 02:07:33.902
All right.

02:07:34.302 --> 02:07:35.003
Thank you, John.

02:07:35.063 --> 02:07:36.004
G'day, Ahmed.

02:07:36.644 --> 02:07:38.466
One thing before we go to Glenn, then Jim.

02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:55.636
Armour did a great interview of William Bay, and all of you need to be aware of Dr Billy Bay, an Australian who won a Supreme Court case, Supreme Court of Queensland, attacking the medical regulators who suspended him.

02:07:56.056 --> 02:07:57.538
And rather than going through the

02:07:57.918 --> 02:07:59.219
bullshit appeal process.

02:07:59.259 --> 02:08:11.190
He went straight to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court held that the actions of APRA, the Australian Regulatory Agency and the medical boards were totally unlawful and void and invalid.

02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:15.374
And he has been he has been re licensed.

02:08:16.415 --> 02:08:18.057
But it's an excellent interview, Ahmed.

02:08:18.297 --> 02:08:18.857
Well done.

02:08:19.057 --> 02:08:20.499
And we'll have a look at Stephen.

02:08:20.519 --> 02:08:22.441
We've got to get Billy onto here because

02:08:23.061 --> 02:08:30.186
because his courage is wonderful, the courage to stand up against the system rather than following the system.

02:08:31.147 --> 02:08:39.853
And Billy and all of you doctors, anyone watching this recording, has to understand that if you step into the medical board system,

02:08:40.533 --> 02:08:42.575
that is attacking you, you are stuffed.

02:08:42.895 --> 02:08:45.957
There is no justice, as Billy Bay says, all right?

02:08:46.477 --> 02:08:47.718
So, it's very relevant.

02:08:47.778 --> 02:08:48.539
Armand, well done.

02:08:48.819 --> 02:08:51.300
Get on to Armand's sub stack, put it in the chat, Armand.

02:08:51.341 --> 02:08:53.242
All right, let's go to Glenn, then Jim.

02:08:53.642 --> 02:08:57.365
So, Charles, if you introduce me to Bobby, is it?

02:08:58.345 --> 02:08:59.566
Billy, William Bay.

02:09:00.267 --> 02:09:01.768
Okay, William Bay, yeah.

02:09:01.908 --> 02:09:02.748
Armand, Armand.

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:04.469
I agree, he's one of the ones I

02:09:05.717 --> 02:09:08.939
have noticed and he needs to present to us.

02:09:08.959 --> 02:09:10.360
We want him here.

02:09:10.581 --> 02:09:12.262
His courage is excellent.

02:09:12.282 --> 02:09:14.203
His thinking process is excellent.

02:09:14.644 --> 02:09:14.944
All right.

02:09:15.604 --> 02:09:20.988
Ahmed, organize that for Stephen to get Billy Bay onto here.

02:09:21.208 --> 02:09:21.428
Done.

02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.889
All right.

02:09:21.929 --> 02:09:23.530
Glenn and then Jim.

02:09:23.770 --> 02:09:24.871
Charles, Jim was next.

02:09:25.717 --> 02:09:26.897
No, Jim wanted you to go next.

02:09:27.638 --> 02:09:28.118
I said yes.

02:09:28.218 --> 02:09:28.478
OK.

02:09:29.258 --> 02:09:30.459
All right.

02:09:31.399 --> 02:09:32.019
That's awesome.

02:09:32.039 --> 02:09:41.362
So JJ, there's so many things I fully agree with you, especially in this space where you have the depth and the knowledge.

02:09:41.742 --> 02:09:45.784
Oh, let me put my camera on.

02:09:45.964 --> 02:09:50.785
From your research and your educational cycle,

02:09:52.846 --> 02:10:02.411
Unfortunately, I think there are some areas that you kind of extend into as being associated with the overall attack that's going on.

02:10:03.051 --> 02:10:15.638
And that presents a problem where people feel that the mix of things you understand well, like the protocols of murder, the gain of function as a mythology, the

02:10:16.431 --> 02:10:24.523
The RNA cannot pandemic, the muscular injection is dumb, and the transfection of healthy humans was always criminal.

02:10:24.884 --> 02:10:28.549
Those are all good and solid and associated with the knowledge space you have.

02:10:29.912 --> 02:10:34.354
But there's certain other areas where you seem to just link people and associate them.

02:10:36.314 --> 02:10:42.816
There's a lot of discussions around the correctness and the intent around Robert Malone.

02:10:43.756 --> 02:10:47.718
I personally put him into the bad cycle and the evil side.

02:10:49.158 --> 02:10:55.520
But once one does that, you can't simply say anybody that shows up in the same room with him is also guilty.

02:10:56.517 --> 02:11:06.604
And therefore, I think you go a little too far in identifying people like Peter McCullough and Jessica Rose as also equally guilty.

02:11:08.745 --> 02:11:26.117
And in addition, in that same kind of space, I think you've gone a bit too far in your characterizations of certain things with President Trump and the state of Israel, where these are spaces that you may have heard about and read articles.

02:11:26.617 --> 02:11:31.758
But I'm being a fairly good expert in a number of these.

02:11:31.858 --> 02:11:36.580
You've gone way too far with your extension and your extrapolation of your position.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.581
What is your understanding of my position on Israel?

02:11:41.841 --> 02:11:45.702
Because I think I made it very clear that I don't think I know anything about Israel.

02:11:45.762 --> 02:11:48.723
And I think the only thing you know is what you know from social media.

02:11:48.763 --> 02:11:49.263
So then what?

02:11:50.097 --> 02:11:55.118
Well, I know far more than that because I have a direct linkage with the intel side of the U.S.

02:11:55.379 --> 02:11:57.659
Okay, but then you heard me then.

02:11:57.739 --> 02:12:05.441
You're mischaracterizing me and you heard me say that nobody knows and that I think everything that's there is being controlled.

02:12:05.481 --> 02:12:06.602
You heard me say that.

02:12:06.682 --> 02:12:09.363
So what is my position on Israel then?

02:12:09.423 --> 02:12:13.944
What is my position that you think is not good if I'm saying that I don't know?

02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:21.375
because you just said that I had a position that you thought I was overextended on, but I said I don't know.

02:12:21.975 --> 02:12:23.417
So what are you doing here, Glenn?

02:12:24.838 --> 02:12:25.278
Calm down.

02:12:25.839 --> 02:12:27.040
No, you calm down.

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.921
You just accused me of something.

02:12:28.961 --> 02:12:35.547
What am I doing wrong if I say I don't think that I know enough about Israel to have a stance and I think it's a trap?

02:12:36.434 --> 02:12:38.576
What if I said the same thing about Ukraine?

02:12:38.616 --> 02:12:46.101
And now you're actually used a pretty significant amount of time to say something about me that I don't think is accurate.

02:12:46.562 --> 02:12:49.304
So maybe you should start over and rephrase it with a question.

02:12:50.705 --> 02:12:59.791
Well, I mean, if your point is you don't have a position around Israel or its secret service.

02:12:59.912 --> 02:13:05.816
What is your position on the population pyramid and the need to murder people in order to fix that problem?

02:13:07.637 --> 02:13:11.839
I think those that have put us in this position, that that's absolutely part of it.

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.042
I also think that... And so then don't you think we should talk about that before we argue about Israel?

02:13:19.183 --> 02:13:20.424
Because that's America.

02:13:20.844 --> 02:13:22.184
That's murder in America.

02:13:22.264 --> 02:13:26.987
And indeed, and indeed everybody, this is the, as a moderator, I just want, you know,

02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:34.293
Glenn, Jay didn't go, he didn't do a treatise on Israel, he did a treatise on the population pyramid.

02:13:34.593 --> 02:13:42.236
Now we can, as I said before, we can talk about lots of other things, and we do sometimes in this group, and we're tight for time.

02:13:43.017 --> 02:13:50.540
So just, you know, that's where I draw the line as moderator, not because it's not free speech, but because we don't have unlimited time.

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:53.802
Some of you here on this call do have unlimited time,

02:13:54.382 --> 02:13:55.722
I don't, and most people don't.

02:13:56.002 --> 02:13:59.143
Most people do not want to be on unlimited time calls.

02:13:59.583 --> 02:14:01.504
So Glenn, please ask your question.

02:14:02.144 --> 02:14:04.844
Okay, then I'm going to switch it into one of the other areas.

02:14:05.304 --> 02:14:13.926
You did specifically call out during your presentation your impression that Donald Trump's shot on his ear was a big fake.

02:14:15.006 --> 02:14:17.527
Do you have any strong evidence of that other than

02:14:18.217 --> 02:14:23.382
that there was a lot of other poor information being talked about at the time, including shooters on them.

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:24.483
That's a question.

02:14:24.543 --> 02:14:25.764
That's that's the question.

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:26.304
Good.

02:14:26.525 --> 02:14:26.725
OK.

02:14:27.305 --> 02:14:28.026
Yeah, I do.

02:14:28.166 --> 02:14:37.554
Actually, the the wearing of of Band-Aids at the Republican National Convention is really the same thing as wearing masks.

02:14:37.635 --> 02:14:39.817
And if you don't see that, then you're kind of scary.

02:14:40.857 --> 02:14:44.621
They actually performed that people actually performed for you.

02:14:45.265 --> 02:14:48.607
to make sure that you believed that they believed that there was a shot.

02:14:48.767 --> 02:14:54.010
Now remember, his sons are the people that brag and they take pictures with dead animals.

02:14:54.650 --> 02:15:00.413
He's a guy who brags about his fitness, he brags about his doctors, he brags about his health.

02:15:00.873 --> 02:15:08.337
But we haven't seen one close-up Instagram picture of his perfectly healed ear or his tiny little scar.

02:15:08.837 --> 02:15:13.780
What I have seen are plenty of analysis of ballistics where the tiniest bullet

02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.402
would tear apart the cartilage of this ear if it hit it at all.

02:15:18.943 --> 02:15:27.627
There is no video evidence anywhere where they tried to recreate the destruction of the cartilage of the ear where the ear wasn't almost torn off.

02:15:28.228 --> 02:15:32.070
And they used the smallest bullets with the most minute grace.

02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:42.936
And these were actually trained soldiers that were surprising themselves when they watched the fast-forward footage or the slow-motion footage of the ear exploding.

02:15:43.891 --> 02:15:53.955
So I strongly encourage you to consider the possibility that Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and the rest of the people that run this show are laughing.

02:15:54.941 --> 02:15:57.343
about the fact that you think that somebody was shot.

02:15:58.184 --> 02:16:16.058
It's crazy to think that these people spent so much time analyzing audio footage and audio recordings and video footage and deciding whether there was a shooter on which roof or from which window and we all took it very seriously just like

02:16:16.858 --> 02:16:23.321
when they argued about it in January, about whether there's a furin cleavage site or whether there's a patent on this spike protein.

02:16:23.682 --> 02:16:27.463
I bet you they released this already in October at the military games.

02:16:28.084 --> 02:16:40.330
And none of those discussions ever once questioned the premise, just like the discussion of a water tower shooter or the discussion of who's going to wear a Band-Aid is immediately not questioning the premise of the narrative.

02:16:40.470 --> 02:16:43.912
Nobody questioned the premise of the narrative, not even the Democrats.

02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:46.430
That's how I know.

02:16:46.550 --> 02:16:49.093
So do you care?

02:16:49.213 --> 02:16:49.674
That's enough.

02:16:50.155 --> 02:16:50.675
That's enough.

02:16:50.715 --> 02:16:51.436
Wait, wait, wait.

02:16:52.097 --> 02:16:53.459
No, you don't have unlimited questions.

02:16:53.539 --> 02:16:54.280
One more question.

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:56.262
No, I'm not having a debate.

02:16:56.282 --> 02:16:57.564
You asked a question, Glenn.

02:16:57.824 --> 02:16:58.705
We're tight for time.

02:16:58.785 --> 02:17:00.047
Listen to what I say.

02:17:01.664 --> 02:17:06.227
He challenged my statement on an area I know a lot more than he does.

02:17:06.267 --> 02:17:06.487
He did.

02:17:06.507 --> 02:17:06.687
He did.

02:17:06.788 --> 02:17:07.528
And he answered it.

02:17:08.108 --> 02:17:08.769
He answered it.

02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:12.031
I, I'm simply going, I want to answer the point.

02:17:12.071 --> 02:17:15.654
He said, he's challenging that it could have happened from a shot.

02:17:16.254 --> 02:17:19.396
And I can tell you things happen with bullets in proximity.

02:17:19.937 --> 02:17:23.879
I have seen a deer die with a, with a 50 caliber bullet.

02:17:23.899 --> 02:17:24.299
Excellent.

02:17:24.339 --> 02:17:24.780
Excellent.

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:25.500
Excellent.

02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:26.121
All you're doing.

02:17:26.581 --> 02:17:27.802
So a shot going.

02:17:28.662 --> 02:17:30.804
I'm we've had enough Jim.

02:17:33.857 --> 02:17:58.456
so i want to just i want to give him the benefit of the doubt i want to just say that i'm not not listening to him glenn please understand that we have the state of the art of state of the art of investigative techniques in order to do the ballistics in order to to find that that crime scene could have been exhaustively exposed as being the site of a shooting and every single detail

02:17:59.116 --> 02:18:02.919
could have been sorted and published, and it would have been fine.

02:18:03.359 --> 02:18:13.547
But instead, we had people like Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and a bunch of random people like Dr. Drew talking about multiple shooters.

02:18:13.627 --> 02:18:19.812
Not the CBS News, not the Democratic National Committee, not CNN.

02:18:20.292 --> 02:18:27.578
None of those people cared to do any analysis at all, not questioning anything about what happened or what mistakes were made.

02:18:27.938 --> 02:18:28.279
Only

02:18:29.099 --> 02:18:38.405
These people who knew that there was a fear in cleavage site and knew that the spike protein was toxic and knew that it might be generating amyloid and that we're screaming about 5G.

02:18:38.465 --> 02:18:39.705
You see the problem here?

02:18:40.346 --> 02:18:41.186
That's the problem.

02:18:43.247 --> 02:18:46.569
I do and that's where people were talking outside their expertise area.

02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:49.491
This happens to be one that is my expertise area.

02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:53.573
What does that mean that you're an expertise in assassinations or what?

02:18:53.934 --> 02:18:55.955
You have not been watching my video on it.

02:18:56.644 --> 02:18:57.285
What video?

02:18:57.425 --> 02:18:59.046
What is the video about?

02:18:59.567 --> 02:19:00.648
That there was a shooting?

02:19:00.848 --> 02:19:01.969
And you know for sure?

02:19:01.989 --> 02:19:11.238
This supposedly involved the child that lived two blocks from my house and goes to the same high school as my son.

02:19:11.658 --> 02:19:14.420
Do you think I'm screwing around here, calling this out?

02:19:15.541 --> 02:19:21.047
I walked down to that house on the day after it happened with my dog because it's that close.

02:19:21.957 --> 02:19:23.618
Do you think I'm screwing around here?

02:19:23.978 --> 02:19:26.800
This happened less than 45 minutes from my house.

02:19:28.461 --> 02:19:29.962
This is not a joke to me.

02:19:30.122 --> 02:19:31.203
All right.

02:19:31.303 --> 02:19:31.783
That's enough.

02:19:32.224 --> 02:19:32.464
Jim.

02:19:34.325 --> 02:19:34.785
Hey, JJ.

02:19:34.825 --> 02:19:36.266
Thanks very much for your insights.

02:19:39.168 --> 02:19:46.133
I put in some documents inside the chat here, so you can read them or save the chat.

02:19:48.074 --> 02:19:49.675
Number one, you talked about

02:19:51.837 --> 02:19:55.479
who said the COVID was first lab created?

02:19:55.519 --> 02:19:59.181
I think the first person who said it was January 29th, 2020.

02:19:59.942 --> 02:20:01.202
His name is Danny Shoham.

02:20:01.242 --> 02:20:03.023
Are you familiar with Danny Shoham?

02:20:03.263 --> 02:20:05.905
He's an intelligent agent.

02:20:06.145 --> 02:20:09.787
But Bannon reported Shoham on the 25th.

02:20:11.048 --> 02:20:14.470
I don't know if he mentioned him by name, but he does mention him right after that.

02:20:14.530 --> 02:20:15.070
So you're right.

02:20:15.130 --> 02:20:16.231
It's all the same week though.

02:20:16.391 --> 02:20:16.651
Okay.

02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:18.432
I know who Danny Shoham is for sure.

02:20:19.835 --> 02:20:20.295
Okay, good.

02:20:20.656 --> 02:20:23.297
So, you know, Danny Shoham, okay.

02:20:23.577 --> 02:20:37.866
Number two, are you familiar with Goldman Sachs, who made a $1.5 billion bet in November of 2019 that the entire world economy would collapse by the third week of March 2020, and if it did, they would make $100 billion?

02:20:39.047 --> 02:20:40.928
I am aware... And they did, and they put a...

02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:53.611
They put their money, if you're familiar with intelligence betting, you would stagger your bets out, but they put it on one date, third week of March.

02:20:53.931 --> 02:21:01.213
And if they did bet, they bet a $1.5 billion bet November of 2019 that paid $100 billion on that date.

02:21:01.693 --> 02:21:04.754
And then they hired the former head of MI6, a guy named Younger.

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.981
I didn't know some of these details.

02:21:09.041 --> 02:21:18.988
I do know that Aaron Seery, the leading failure of the anti-vax movement lawyer team, he worked for Goldman Sachs and also Steve Bannon worked for Goldman Sachs.

02:21:19.008 --> 02:21:21.550
Let me keep going and then I'll get to my question.

02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:23.191
I'm tying it all into intelligence.

02:21:23.872 --> 02:21:26.233
Next is Devin Dalio.

02:21:27.434 --> 02:21:29.976
Ray Dalio is a guy who ran Bridgewater Capital.

02:21:30.953 --> 02:21:37.837
but the guy who actually ran, who owns Bridgewater Capital, but the guy who was actually running it is a guy named Mark McCormick in 2020.

02:21:38.037 --> 02:21:40.098
Excuse me, David McCormick.

02:21:40.318 --> 02:21:43.640
David McCormick is now Senator from Pennsylvania.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:45.161
He used to run Bridgewater Capital.

02:21:45.201 --> 02:21:49.204
He ran the money for Goldman Sachs, okay?

02:21:49.564 --> 02:21:51.845
And now he's Senator of Pennsylvania, your state.

02:21:53.486 --> 02:21:56.768
Another issue is the DNA plasmids.

02:21:56.788 --> 02:21:58.429
You're talking about an intramuscular injection.

02:21:59.286 --> 02:22:02.749
DNA plasmids don't need refrigeration, whereas the mRNA does.

02:22:02.889 --> 02:22:06.613
And when you thaw out mRNA, you have to thaw it out and inject it within three hours.

02:22:07.173 --> 02:22:08.674
Many of these vials are sitting around.

02:22:08.694 --> 02:22:20.244
The one thing that can be in the vials, the DNA contaminants that the eagle talks about, Bienevendez, talks about contaminating, and it correlates directly

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:24.147
with the toxicity of each vial by lot number.

02:22:24.788 --> 02:22:31.932
So I encourage you to, you know, DNA plasmids, electroporation, intramuscular injection, that's all very real.

02:22:32.753 --> 02:22:37.256
And that is done by a company called Inovio, I-N-O-V-I-O, and they're in Pennsylvania as well.

02:22:37.987 --> 02:22:47.996
And they made a vaccine that actually worked because they used the, or may have worked, I'll say, because they used the DNA of the capsid protein.

02:22:48.236 --> 02:22:55.583
You know that Robert Malone and his wife are responsible for that company originally in Norway, right?

02:22:55.683 --> 02:23:03.070
Yeah, and that's all through the University of Pennsylvania who invented the DNA, who makes money on the mRNA vaccines as well.

02:23:04.575 --> 02:23:13.478
So what again we're talking about we're talking about a coordinated effort to roll out I'm very detailed.

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:15.598
I'm getting very detailed about who's coordinating.

02:23:15.858 --> 02:23:19.799
Yeah, I've been to all these details Five years ago already.

02:23:19.819 --> 02:23:23.320
That's why Robert Malone and I have a have a few selfies together.

02:23:23.681 --> 02:23:24.821
I've been chasing it, right?

02:23:25.481 --> 02:23:25.901
I understand.

02:23:26.701 --> 02:23:27.662
No, no, no problem.

02:23:27.682 --> 02:23:31.383
So the next thing is the medical examiner for the for the

02:23:32.879 --> 02:24:01.846
for Pittsburgh he cremated the body within two weeks of the shooting so uh... and the people behind some of the people standing behind trump were actually killed by the bullets so there were bullets going by uh... the issue with my question is could any intelligence media be covering this up and intelligence media is the smith munt modernization act of twenty twelve which allows propaganda on the united states citizens

02:24:02.526 --> 02:24:02.947
Absolutely.

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:04.328
I believe it wholeheartedly.

02:24:04.368 --> 02:24:05.449
That's what I'm trying to say.

02:24:05.529 --> 02:24:08.411
People like Brent Weinstein are working on that.

02:24:08.851 --> 02:24:09.912
I agree.

02:24:10.273 --> 02:24:20.201
And is there an intelligence medical division in a group called Six Eyes that could have designed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?

02:24:20.281 --> 02:24:24.825
And that intelligence network is in a book called Rainbow Six.

02:24:26.587 --> 02:24:29.809
and they describe a virus being released.

02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:31.311
I've heard of that.

02:24:31.331 --> 02:24:43.179
And games and a vaccine being worse than the virus to depopulate the earth in name of of economic, excuse me, radical environmentalists.

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:46.082
So could this be an intelligence effort?

02:24:46.482 --> 02:24:50.365
And if so, which country has not signed the

02:24:51.866 --> 02:25:06.003
biological weapons convention that prevents the, and the real question is how could they prevent their families from being affected by it, or how could they prevent certain people by being affected?

02:25:06.792 --> 02:25:12.377
by this weapon while mandating it be disseminated on everybody in the United States and the world?

02:25:13.138 --> 02:25:14.659
That's enough questions.

02:25:14.699 --> 02:25:19.864
The main one being that I don't think transmission is very likely.

02:25:20.204 --> 02:25:21.806
I mean, that's the easiest way.

02:25:22.086 --> 02:25:25.669
Just keep away from the peasants and transmission doesn't happen.

02:25:25.729 --> 02:25:26.350
Even shedding

02:25:27.188 --> 02:25:31.249
I think is a, not saying it's not happening.

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:33.510
Please understand, I'm not saying the shedding is not happening.

02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:34.630
I think it's quite rare.

02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:43.453
It has to, you have to be transfected in a place in your body where the long-term production of the protein will continue.

02:25:43.493 --> 02:25:47.355
And I don't know if that means it has to go to your liver or it has to go somewhere else.

02:25:47.395 --> 02:25:50.055
I don't know what that would be, but that would be my guess.

02:25:50.195 --> 02:25:53.557
And so again, the answer,

02:25:55.701 --> 02:26:13.392
long and short is that I really think that this goes back to the Human Genome Project and the need to collect as much data as possible while the population is as large as it is, knowing that it's not always going to be this large and that they have every intention of reducing it.

02:26:13.853 --> 02:26:18.316
They need to collect this data now, so they need to invert our sovereignty and if part of that

02:26:19.296 --> 02:26:25.737
inversion is to get us to accept pandemics so that we accept all the countermeasures that come with it, then yes, for sure.

02:26:26.538 --> 02:26:36.960
Just keep in mind that my answer is being hedged because I want you to consider the possibility that they can't just kill us, just like the Nazis didn't just kill people.

02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:40.580
They did experiments on them first and they kept meticulous records.

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.281
And I think they're doing that to us now.

02:26:42.781 --> 02:26:48.622
And so if they're killing us, they're doing it in a meticulous enough way so that they're using us on the way out and they're going to do it to our kids too.

02:26:50.455 --> 02:26:50.995
Thank you, Jay.

02:26:51.136 --> 02:26:51.696
Thank you, Jim.

02:26:51.716 --> 02:26:52.997
We've got three more.

02:26:53.417 --> 02:26:56.760
Lars, James, Ahmed, and then Stephen.

02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:59.522
We'll declare another 20 minutes if you've got time, Jay.

02:26:59.622 --> 02:26:59.802
Sure.

02:26:59.842 --> 02:27:00.382
I guess I can do that.

02:27:00.403 --> 02:27:01.283
20 more minutes and then we'll stop.

02:27:01.523 --> 02:27:01.824
Okay.

02:27:02.564 --> 02:27:03.105
Thank you, Jim.

02:27:04.225 --> 02:27:04.826
Hi, JJ.

02:27:05.166 --> 02:27:06.427
I don't have a question for you.

02:27:06.547 --> 02:27:07.768
I sent you an email today.

02:27:07.788 --> 02:27:09.149
Hey, it's Lars.

02:27:09.209 --> 02:27:09.609
Hello.

02:27:09.730 --> 02:27:10.030
Yes.

02:27:11.531 --> 02:27:17.035
Check your inbox if it's important to you and send me the answer and we'll fix it.

02:27:17.195 --> 02:27:17.575
Very good.

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:17.716
Yep.

02:27:19.022 --> 02:27:19.382
Very good.

02:27:19.623 --> 02:27:20.544
Lars, very efficient.

02:27:20.684 --> 02:27:21.084
I like it.

02:27:21.925 --> 02:27:22.345
Good job.

02:27:24.327 --> 02:27:25.389
James, good to see you.

02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:27.371
Well done on all your ongoing great work.

02:27:29.773 --> 02:27:30.694
I trust you can hear me?

02:27:31.355 --> 02:27:31.515
Yep.

02:27:32.356 --> 02:27:32.656
Wonderful.

02:27:33.577 --> 02:27:40.140
JJ, I have an affinity for all of your work for a strange reason, because I grew up in Youngstown, Ohio.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.403
I've got family in Pittsburgh, and every time I see your face or your name, it makes me think of my childhood, okay?

02:27:46.143 --> 02:27:48.124
I would love to have an opportunity to talk with you.

02:27:48.624 --> 02:27:49.965
I want to support what you're doing.

02:27:51.225 --> 02:27:53.806
I put my contact information every place I go.

02:27:54.027 --> 02:27:54.987
It's in the chat right now.

02:27:55.287 --> 02:27:56.828
Please call me at your earliest convenience.

02:27:57.248 --> 02:27:59.849
Not immediately after this, because we're going to eat lunch.

02:28:00.049 --> 02:28:08.073
But I definitely really have experienced many similar things dealing with people that you have talked about.

02:28:08.353 --> 02:28:09.434
So I hear you.

02:28:11.875 --> 02:28:15.177
Charles, I'd like to get in line behind Thor.

02:28:15.637 --> 02:28:20.359
I'd love to talk about the project that I'm working on when you have a chance for me to present.

02:28:20.419 --> 02:28:21.180
I would love to do that.

02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:24.501
And Dr. Malik, I'd love to talk to you about that as well.

02:28:26.189 --> 02:28:28.672
here is invited to look at what I'm doing.

02:28:29.313 --> 02:28:35.161
And if you want to give me your two cents and you want to help, I'm as open as open can be.

02:28:35.341 --> 02:28:35.902
Give me a call.

02:28:36.142 --> 02:28:37.144
Love to talk to anybody here.

02:28:37.744 --> 02:28:38.505
I really can help.

02:28:40.899 --> 02:28:42.460
I would love to hear it.

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.781
Who's saying that?

02:28:43.861 --> 02:28:44.601
I'm helping.

02:28:46.062 --> 02:28:46.663
Who's saying that?

02:28:47.463 --> 02:28:47.964
Thorbjørn.

02:28:48.744 --> 02:28:49.545
Oh, I see.

02:28:49.565 --> 02:28:50.405
Thorbjørn.

02:28:51.106 --> 02:28:51.626
Amazing.

02:28:51.666 --> 02:28:53.087
We've got James.

02:28:53.267 --> 02:28:55.388
We've got Thorbjørn as a speaker.

02:28:55.408 --> 02:28:56.509
We've got James as a speaker.

02:28:56.529 --> 02:28:57.990
We've got Billy Bay as a speaker.

02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.410
Ahmed.

02:28:58.450 --> 02:28:59.791
We've got Ahmed as a speaker now.

02:29:00.832 --> 02:29:02.513
But anyway, talk to Jay.

02:29:02.973 --> 02:29:10.118
I just want to say very quickly, I really enjoyed watching Thorbjørn smoke and eat and smoke.

02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:13.470
It's just been fantastic.

02:29:13.890 --> 02:29:14.930
Anyway, moving on.

02:29:16.891 --> 02:29:20.893
JJ, I totally agree with you about the ear and the ballistics.

02:29:21.073 --> 02:29:22.434
Yeah, it just would not happen.

02:29:22.934 --> 02:29:32.819
You know, I've seen enough injuries with rounds and bullets as an orthopaedic surgeon to know there's no way it would have nicked his ear and he wouldn't have gone deaf.

02:29:33.199 --> 02:29:34.720
And if you look, he clutched his ear.

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:39.022
And when he gets up to do the fist pump, his cuff is completely clean.

02:29:39.562 --> 02:29:40.903
There's no blood on his palm.

02:29:41.243 --> 02:29:44.725
I'm telling you right now, the ear is one of the most bloody parts of your body.

02:29:44.745 --> 02:29:46.286
There would be blood everywhere.

02:29:46.766 --> 02:29:49.028
And that little streak of blood across his chest.

02:29:49.428 --> 02:29:54.271
It's all theatre and anyone who falls for it and all the ballistics and the set, it's all bullshit.

02:29:54.291 --> 02:29:55.932
You're just getting lost in the crap.

02:29:56.292 --> 02:29:58.274
It's just theatre and it's garbage.

02:29:58.294 --> 02:30:02.476
And if you're falling for it, I'm sorry, you're a schmuck.

02:30:02.736 --> 02:30:04.617
But anyway, JJ, my question to you is,

02:30:05.758 --> 02:30:15.184
my friend, on your podcast, you said, I'm a globalist serving American interfering, blah, blah, blah, dude.

02:30:16.244 --> 02:30:17.665
Where did you come up with that from?

02:30:17.705 --> 02:30:18.646
And why did you say that?

02:30:19.066 --> 02:30:20.547
So it's pretty harsh comments.

02:30:20.867 --> 02:30:22.808
I'd love to have the evidence to back it up.

02:30:24.609 --> 02:30:27.891
Did anybody pay for a studio in your backyard?

02:30:29.426 --> 02:30:29.667
Nope.

02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:31.069
You bought that yourself?

02:30:31.169 --> 02:30:31.910
Built it yourself?

02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.390
Yes.

02:30:32.931 --> 02:30:33.252
Yes.

02:30:33.272 --> 02:30:35.575
Like I said, I want evidence.

02:30:35.655 --> 02:30:36.776
Have you got evidence?

02:30:36.877 --> 02:30:39.640
I'm asking, when did you decide to speak out again?

02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.042
How did it actually work for you?

02:30:41.102 --> 02:30:41.743
What did you lose?

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:43.267
It's all there.

02:30:43.347 --> 02:30:44.288
It's on public.

02:30:44.788 --> 02:30:47.131
Everything's on Twitter, Instagram.

02:30:47.451 --> 02:30:49.473
I've told you on Signal personally.

02:30:49.513 --> 02:30:56.580
And so why do you have a penchant for people like Sasha Latupova, for example?

02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:58.962
Do you not understand what she's done with her daughter?

02:30:59.063 --> 02:31:00.384
You didn't investigate that at all?

02:31:00.404 --> 02:31:01.745
You just give people a platform?

02:31:02.666 --> 02:31:03.487
Sorry, penchant?

02:31:03.567 --> 02:31:04.668
Penchant for Sasha?

02:31:04.728 --> 02:31:05.189
What does that mean?

02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:17.734
It's a for me for me liking the the it's it's strange that that My first podcast of yours was behind a paywall until I complained about it.

02:31:17.794 --> 02:31:28.017
It's very much the same as like that's not true Signal I've measured yeah, you can say that on signal but it doesn't change the fact that it was true.

02:31:28.177 --> 02:31:29.237
It was always public and

02:31:29.577 --> 02:31:31.377
The second one was always public.

02:31:31.557 --> 02:31:34.258
It's curious how those things change.

02:31:34.418 --> 02:31:35.858
And it's fine.

02:31:36.339 --> 02:31:40.659
The bottom line is that you're somebody who spoke out when it was too late to save anybody.

02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:43.500
You still haven't really said that it's murder.

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:49.281
You still haven't really acknowledged that it's actually supplemental oxygen that was used in the United States.

02:31:49.301 --> 02:31:51.882
You haven't acknowledged that there's an opioid epidemic

02:31:52.342 --> 02:31:59.806
that even Mark Kulak was on your stream to talk to you about, and you decided to ridicule him about it instead of just giving that message out.

02:32:00.206 --> 02:32:01.827
How did I ridicule him?

02:32:02.327 --> 02:32:05.529
Oh, I play your voice message several times on my stream.

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:08.410
So you played my private voice message to him.

02:32:08.430 --> 02:32:10.471
Yeah, the one that you insulted him about.

02:32:10.511 --> 02:32:12.993
You made it public and then therefore ridiculed him.

02:32:13.053 --> 02:32:16.154
I did, because people are being murdered and you're lying about it.

02:32:16.194 --> 02:32:17.295
That's why I made it public.

02:32:17.335 --> 02:32:17.715
That's right.

02:32:18.914 --> 02:32:22.836
I think you're, I think you're, I think you are actually taking a lot of money.

02:32:22.976 --> 02:32:25.617
In fact, you tried to get a lot of money from the wellness company.

02:32:25.637 --> 02:32:26.137
Did you not?

02:32:26.197 --> 02:32:29.458
Is that also a personal email that nobody was supposed to see?

02:32:29.858 --> 02:32:31.519
Have you read my email thread?

02:32:31.739 --> 02:32:33.780
So basically your rationale, let me speak now.

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:42.983
Your rationale is anyone who wakes up to things after you did is basically not sincere and not legitimate and shouldn't be allowed to wake up.

02:32:43.003 --> 02:32:46.065
Yes, anybody, anybody that lacks the humility that you do.

02:32:47.145 --> 02:32:51.348
that lacks the humility that you do, yes, yes, definitely.

02:32:51.388 --> 02:32:53.350
You had no principles when it counted.

02:32:53.370 --> 02:33:04.559
So what you're trying to say is there's an hierarchy of awake, and if you've been awake from the beginning, great, and anyone who wakes up later on is not to be trusted.

02:33:04.579 --> 02:33:06.080
How are we ever going to get

02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:09.261
You woke up after Robert Malone visited you.

02:33:09.321 --> 02:33:14.603
You woke up after Robert Malone encouraged you to start a podcast.

02:33:14.703 --> 02:33:20.265
You woke up when Robert Malone suggested you do a podcast.

02:33:20.385 --> 02:33:20.985
You... Oh.

02:33:21.065 --> 02:33:21.305
Yeah.

02:33:21.565 --> 02:33:22.066
Uh-huh.

02:33:22.106 --> 02:33:22.286
Yeah.

02:33:22.306 --> 02:33:22.546
Uh-huh.

02:33:32.069 --> 02:33:48.597
i am not working as an orthopedic surgeon anymore i don't know what more of a sacrifice that would unbelievable sacrifice right and that comes back now you're paying all of your bills with a podcast isn't that great with a little explain with a little tiny studio in your backyard what the details are

02:33:48.897 --> 02:33:53.420
nice big rumbles, contract, or something like that.

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:55.182
You mean murder?

02:33:55.642 --> 02:33:57.423
You don't mention murder.

02:33:57.963 --> 02:34:02.206
Murder in Scotland, murder in the UK, murder in the United States.

02:34:02.267 --> 02:34:03.227
It's not mentioned.

02:34:03.327 --> 02:34:04.788
It's just not mentioned.

02:34:05.109 --> 02:34:06.810
We're all fascinated by you.

02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:07.490
Sorry, what?

02:34:15.154 --> 02:34:16.255
JJ, you're muted.

02:34:16.575 --> 02:34:17.376
Oh, I didn't mute me.

02:34:18.676 --> 02:34:19.497
Somebody muted me.

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:28.563
No, I'm actually quite, I think... I muted you because Ahmed was speaking and we can't have two people talking at once.

02:34:28.603 --> 02:34:29.944
So, Jay, we're now listening to you.

02:34:30.705 --> 02:34:31.265
No, it's okay.

02:34:31.285 --> 02:34:32.346
I don't have much more to say.

02:34:32.786 --> 02:34:44.094
I firmly believe that Ahmed Malik was recruited and has been working with people like Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Sasha Latupova, CHD and the wellness company who wouldn't give him a job.

02:34:44.694 --> 02:34:51.356
trying to find a way to grift on the back of this fake pandemic and participate in the destruction of the West.

02:34:51.496 --> 02:34:52.796
And I think that's what he's doing.

02:34:52.836 --> 02:34:54.816
And he's making a fine living doing it.

02:34:54.976 --> 02:34:56.517
And more power to him.

02:34:56.917 --> 02:34:59.177
I hope his kids grow up well.

02:34:59.318 --> 02:35:02.378
I'm at any final voice before we go to Thomas and then Stephen and then we're finishing.

02:35:02.418 --> 02:35:05.779
So basically I've been recruited by the CIA, but I'm still trying to get a job.

02:35:05.799 --> 02:35:06.959
No, I didn't say CIA.

02:35:07.219 --> 02:35:08.300
I didn't say CIA.

02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:09.380
I said Robert Malone.

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.981
I said Panda and Heart.

02:35:12.061 --> 02:35:13.682
I said all of them.

02:35:13.882 --> 02:35:15.062
I said all of them.

02:35:15.582 --> 02:35:17.483
Do you want to come and fix my leaky roof then?

02:35:17.843 --> 02:35:18.864
Oh, please, man.

02:35:18.884 --> 02:35:19.864
Since I'm rolling in it.

02:35:19.984 --> 02:35:21.005
Since I'm so rich.

02:35:21.185 --> 02:35:22.765
Please, my friend, please.

02:35:22.845 --> 02:35:24.366
The lies are said.

02:35:24.686 --> 02:35:28.408
The smile on your face is what caught... You're not angry, and that's why.

02:35:28.508 --> 02:35:31.269
Because you haven't lost anything and you haven't risked anything.

02:35:31.289 --> 02:35:32.670
Because I'm not like you.

02:35:33.010 --> 02:35:33.290
No.

02:35:33.350 --> 02:35:33.770
No.

02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:34.250
No.

02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:35.971
It's because you're lying.

02:35:36.551 --> 02:35:37.151
I can't talk.

02:35:37.271 --> 02:35:38.052
I need to talk, right?

02:35:40.454 --> 02:35:49.204
I'm not filled with darkness because if you're gonna defeat the enemy and the darkness you need to be filled with the light And I think really you need to go on a mushroom trip Oh my gosh

02:35:58.414 --> 02:36:00.015
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:00.756 --> 02:36:01.857
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:02.037 --> 02:36:03.178
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:03.258 --> 02:36:05.039
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:05.459 --> 02:36:06.780
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:07.521 --> 02:36:09.042
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:09.282 --> 02:36:10.483
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:10.523 --> 02:36:13.585
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:13.625 --> 02:36:14.746
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:14.806 --> 02:36:17.528
We don't all need to be different.

02:36:17.708 --> 02:36:19.529
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:19.649 --> 02:36:21.110
I've got to take drugs.

02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:22.231
He recommended that I take drugs.

02:36:22.251 --> 02:36:23.952
He recommended that I take drugs.

02:36:26.714 --> 02:36:28.115
What a sad little man.

02:36:28.255 --> 02:36:29.635
Thomas, thanks, Ahmed.

02:36:29.895 --> 02:36:39.719
Anyway, I'd just like to say I like both these guys, JJ and Ahmed, and I think it's a pity that both of you are engaging in slagging each other off.

02:36:39.739 --> 02:36:44.141
Stephen, according to JJ's logic, that means that you're part of the enemy as well.

02:36:44.621 --> 02:36:49.863
No, because unlike you, he has promoted me to other people.

02:36:50.203 --> 02:36:52.604
Unlike you, he has promoted me to other people.

02:36:53.724 --> 02:36:57.048
Unlike you, Stephen Frost promotes me to other people.

02:36:57.108 --> 02:36:59.810
He represents my ideas to other people.

02:36:59.870 --> 02:37:02.893
He asks and checks my ideas with other people.

02:37:03.013 --> 02:37:13.164
Unlike you, who has a podcast and has had me on a couple times, but never checked my ideas with anybody else, never tried to contrast my ideas with anybody else's.

02:37:13.244 --> 02:37:17.268
In fact, you're just a guy who has a podcast, but no real insight into anything.

02:37:17.708 --> 02:37:18.969
and good luck with that.

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:22.450
So, unless I'm promoting you 24-7 and I'm your personal... None!

02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:23.811
I'm talking about none.

02:37:23.831 --> 02:37:24.851
I'm part of the problem.

02:37:24.891 --> 02:37:25.652
Who's right?

02:37:25.952 --> 02:37:27.773
Do you know anything about who's right?

02:37:27.833 --> 02:37:31.755
Are you making any decisions or you're just interviewing people like a Joe Rogan?

02:37:32.415 --> 02:37:33.455
This is unedifying.

02:37:33.515 --> 02:37:34.296
Next, Thomas.

02:37:34.916 --> 02:37:35.877
Oh, what a pathetic man.

02:37:35.897 --> 02:37:36.697
Guys, calm down, please.

02:37:36.797 --> 02:37:37.738
I love you both.

02:37:37.918 --> 02:37:39.959
I mean, I'm not... Can I just say one thing?

02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:49.626
Ahmed, you need to understand that JJ did lose... Sorry, JJ, you need to understand that Ahmed did lose his profession as well as his job.

02:37:51.027 --> 02:37:51.867
Good.

02:37:51.887 --> 02:37:52.208
Thomas?

02:37:52.828 --> 02:37:56.530
As did I. I agree with almost everything you say.

02:37:57.011 --> 02:37:57.451
You know this.

02:37:59.156 --> 02:38:03.437
I think I have a good gut feeling concerning Ahmad.

02:38:03.577 --> 02:38:04.798
I had it from the start.

02:38:06.438 --> 02:38:12.840
One thing we must be careful is to judge people from the distance.

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:25.223
I mean, when this whole thing started, I thought, oh my God, how can everybody in politics, in media, in medicine, et cetera, become evil overnight?

02:38:26.581 --> 02:38:28.102
And the truth is they have not.

02:38:28.122 --> 02:38:32.926
I mean, this is a conspiracy of a bunch of psychopaths.

02:38:33.847 --> 02:38:36.449
And then there is the convergence of interests.

02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:46.818
I mean, such a banality of evil is only possible because many people join their bandwagon for personal interests.

02:38:47.439 --> 02:38:53.404
And I think it's really difficult to say that everybody

02:38:54.087 --> 02:38:57.389
Who mentions he's on the other side, he's really on the other side.

02:38:58.030 --> 02:39:01.772
I fully agree concerning Robert Malone.

02:39:01.792 --> 02:39:13.760
I mean, yeah, he's a clown and a joke, but I guess many, many people there are not on the other side, or at least I'm not sure.

02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:21.866
And I think it's very difficult and problematic to say if that's this

02:39:22.719 --> 02:39:25.880
certitude as you do, that they are on the other side.

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:27.400
This is just my recommendation.

02:39:27.481 --> 02:39:35.123
I love you and you do a great job, but there I recommend to be a little bit more careful.

02:39:35.303 --> 02:39:38.904
I would just submit to you, Thomas Binder, with the utmost humility.

02:39:39.684 --> 02:39:44.246
You're one of my heroes, of course, and I say this with the utmost humility.

02:39:46.546 --> 02:39:48.247
Ahmed Malik has

02:39:49.195 --> 02:39:54.962
has emails and private messages and signal chats where if you saw them all, you would see it.

02:39:55.963 --> 02:39:59.387
And I have these... You have no right to see his emails.

02:39:59.447 --> 02:40:01.689
Please talk to Thomas and stop attacking Ahmed.

02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:06.455
Well, but I mean, what if I'm not allowed to say why... I'm not interested in attacks.

02:40:06.475 --> 02:40:07.516
I don't give you the gift.

02:40:07.756 --> 02:40:09.018
You will not attack people.

02:40:10.018 --> 02:40:11.180
You don't need to.

02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:13.082
You're too brilliant.

02:40:13.282 --> 02:40:17.067
Is it attacking people to say that they have communicated with me?

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:18.569
You have not seen all of Ahmed's emails.

02:40:18.609 --> 02:40:19.209
That's bullshit.

02:40:19.250 --> 02:40:20.211
Not my emails.

02:40:20.251 --> 02:40:21.632
The emails he sends to me.

02:40:22.679 --> 02:40:25.120
the text messages that he sends to me.

02:40:26.001 --> 02:40:31.004
I have a right to make a decision about him based on that relationship that is not just me.

02:40:31.064 --> 02:40:32.744
I don't give a shit about your conclusion.

02:40:32.785 --> 02:40:33.505
Let's move on.

02:40:33.705 --> 02:40:36.046
Yeah, but now you're playing their game.

02:40:36.266 --> 02:40:38.748
Now you're discounting my personal experience.

02:40:39.408 --> 02:40:41.969
And my personal experience is these people lying to me.

02:40:44.191 --> 02:40:46.592
I mean, sorry if that's the problem.

02:40:46.992 --> 02:40:48.193
Sorry if that's a problem.

02:40:50.413 --> 02:40:51.334
Yes, it is a problem.

02:40:51.414 --> 02:40:52.774
Grow up, Stephen.

02:40:53.175 --> 02:40:55.596
Oh my gosh, that is sad.

02:40:55.656 --> 02:41:00.779
I don't think anybody does themselves any favours by engaging in this kind of chit-chat.

02:41:00.799 --> 02:41:02.700
Do people lie?

02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:04.241
Do people lie or not?

02:41:06.716 --> 02:41:12.098
JJ, I want to do you a favor by saying I've spoken to you privately many times, and I've said that to you.

02:41:12.118 --> 02:41:19.541
You don't need to engage in this, JJ, but what you've spoken about today was very important because I think you've explained to us.

02:41:20.061 --> 02:41:24.263
Notice that Ahmed Malik did not challenge intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:41:24.323 --> 02:41:27.925
In fact, he didn't want to talk about it at all because he's not trying to win.

02:41:28.465 --> 02:41:32.386
If he was trying to win, like I said, he would say, Jay's a dick, but he's right about this.

02:41:32.446 --> 02:41:33.467
And he didn't say that.

02:41:34.187 --> 02:41:36.269
He didn't say it at all and none of them have said it.

02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.909
I'm done.

02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:39.091
I'm sorry that this didn't work out.

02:41:39.151 --> 02:41:41.273
I'm sorry that I'm not getting my message through.

02:41:41.933 --> 02:41:44.335
But it's a lot of work.

02:41:44.495 --> 02:41:45.396
It's a lot of work.

02:41:45.556 --> 02:41:51.841
I've spent a lot of time on this and I've done a lot of reading that these ideas come from.

02:41:51.901 --> 02:41:56.825
I'm not pulling them out of the air and I'm not making these judgments very, very off the cuff.

02:41:57.085 --> 02:41:58.106
I have years.

02:41:58.286 --> 02:41:58.987
I know you are.

02:41:59.087 --> 02:42:03.230
I'm just saying that I'm kind of tired and I don't have much more to say because

02:42:04.171 --> 02:42:07.615
I shouldn't have to defend myself.

02:42:09.878 --> 02:42:11.500
My track record speaks for itself.

02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:17.647
You've got hours and hours of my stuff, and I've never, ever, ever said I

02:42:19.208 --> 02:42:24.432
I just got through saying today that I think Mark Bailey has had most of this right, and yet everybody ignores it.

02:42:24.452 --> 02:42:31.036
I've just gotten through saying that they murdered people with specific ways in specific places, but now everybody is still ignoring it.

02:42:31.116 --> 02:42:32.597
And that is the message.

02:42:32.657 --> 02:42:42.123
The message is that they murdered people because they had to, and they took advantage of it to tell a story to cover up all these lies that have been going on for a couple generations.

02:42:42.544 --> 02:42:48.628
And if you want to add to that 5G or magnetism or control of the weather, I don't care.

02:42:49.048 --> 02:42:51.090
because it still stays the same message.

02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:57.817
Intramuscular injection is dumb, and they murdered people and lied about it in order to make us teach our kids that it wasn't.

02:42:58.297 --> 02:43:06.686
And if we don't focus on that point, and that RNA cannot pandemic, we're done.

02:43:06.846 --> 02:43:12.271
We're enslaved because we're arguing about something that ultimately is not a first cause.

02:43:12.351 --> 02:43:12.692
It's like,

02:43:13.092 --> 02:43:15.574
You got to go down all the way to the bottom.

02:43:15.594 --> 02:43:18.216
And the bottom is, is they will murder people and lie about it.

02:43:18.257 --> 02:43:19.698
They've lied about World War II.

02:43:19.738 --> 02:43:20.859
They've lied about AIDS.

02:43:20.899 --> 02:43:22.180
They lie about homelessness.

02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:23.921
They lie about taxes.

02:43:23.981 --> 02:43:25.523
They lie about everything.

02:43:26.123 --> 02:43:29.026
And they murdered people and they lied about that too.

02:43:29.266 --> 02:43:29.706
That's it.

02:43:31.748 --> 02:43:32.489
Good.

02:43:32.549 --> 02:43:33.910
David, last question, comment.

02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:34.571
We're finishing.

02:43:35.211 --> 02:43:35.672
Thank you, Jay.

02:43:36.673 --> 02:43:48.202
Well, I still think that the most important thing is to change public opinion about, or at least get a good 10% more people on our side in the UK, for example.

02:43:49.703 --> 02:43:54.247
And I think that people are very confused about what's happened in the last five years.

02:43:54.907 --> 02:43:58.410
And they have no idea what's happened to them and the seriousness of it.

02:43:58.830 --> 02:44:00.632
And we need to explain to these people

02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:05.042
So I think I've said it before, JJ, it's not a criticism, it's just you.

02:44:06.263 --> 02:44:14.687
You have, how should I say, you have such a knowledge of biology that some things are so obvious to you that they don't need to be said.

02:44:14.887 --> 02:44:22.071
And I said it earlier, I'll say it again, just to kind of nail it down, that I think it's not so much to me, the

02:44:24.348 --> 02:44:47.669
the intramuscular injection is dumb they might not understand the nuance of that and the other things you've been saying so I think what the public need to understand is that they've been lied to seriously lied to by their own government and psychologically tortured into a state of Stockholm syndrome and they don't even know it and they're still in that Stockholm syndrome and and we need to tell

02:44:48.249 --> 02:44:49.849
people as often as we can.

02:44:50.089 --> 02:44:53.130
There was no pandemic and there was no COVID-19.

02:44:53.490 --> 02:44:55.150
So what the hell were we locked up for?

02:44:56.811 --> 02:44:56.971
Good.

02:44:57.151 --> 02:44:57.411
Okay.

02:44:57.451 --> 02:44:58.431
Thank you for that statement.

02:44:58.471 --> 02:45:00.952
Thank you everybody for being here.

02:45:01.072 --> 02:45:01.672
We'll see you next time.

02:45:01.692 --> 02:45:03.392
Charles, let JJ have the last word.

02:45:04.132 --> 02:45:06.413
It's very okay.

02:45:06.453 --> 02:45:08.153
Please let Charles have the last word.

02:45:08.193 --> 02:45:11.434
I am just grateful you guys even give me a microphone.

02:45:11.454 --> 02:45:12.294
So thank you very much.

02:45:13.654 --> 02:45:14.635
And have a great new year.

02:45:14.655 --> 02:45:15.016
Thank you, Jay.

02:45:15.036 --> 02:45:15.636
Thank you, Steven.

02:45:15.676 --> 02:45:18.038
Thanks, everybody, for being here.

02:45:18.279 --> 02:45:18.919
Have a good night.

02:45:19.139 --> 02:45:23.103
And we're back again, not on New Year's Eve, on New Year's Day.

02:45:23.143 --> 02:45:24.424
We're back on Sunday next week.

02:45:24.464 --> 02:45:24.825
Bye.

02:45:24.845 --> 02:45:26.206
Bye-bye.

02:45:26.226 --> 02:45:26.646
Thank you.

02:45:27.587 --> 02:45:28.108
All right, guys.

02:45:28.148 --> 02:45:29.008
I'm sorry about that.

02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:35.394
I try my best, and it's always, they pull it all out of me.

02:45:37.506 --> 02:45:40.308
I try my best to remember all the points that I need to remember.

02:45:40.368 --> 02:45:42.710
I try to bring it back to the center all the time.

02:45:42.771 --> 02:45:44.692
And I just, sometimes I can't take it.

02:45:44.892 --> 02:45:47.014
Sometimes it drives me nuts.

02:45:47.314 --> 02:45:54.120
And I don't know if Ahmed Malik's a bad guy or not, but once again, I think I made the point at the end.

02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:58.304
If he's not a bad guy, then he should be saying what I'm saying because nobody else is saying it better than me.

02:45:59.298 --> 02:46:00.980
and that's part of what frustrates me.

02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:14.774
You can't have this meeting of the medical doctors for COVID ethics and have me come in there and hit home runs for nine innings straight and then leave and there's still a debate about who's playing the best baseball.

02:46:16.195 --> 02:46:16.916
I'm tired of it.

02:46:18.066 --> 02:46:28.538
They have all these other people in there to try and explain what's going on, and they don't manage to hit any home runs or convince anybody of anything or explain the big picture in the way that I do.

02:46:28.658 --> 02:46:37.889
And yet somehow or another, after hitting home runs for nine innings straight, everybody just goes home as if they've never seen anything extraordinary at the baseball field today.

02:46:40.549 --> 02:46:51.613
And I don't think, besides Mark Kulak, I don't think there's anybody else who can explain what happened as succinctly as I can with the potential for going into depth on some of these questions that I can.

02:46:52.093 --> 02:46:57.135
And yet, for some reason or another, Ahmed Malik doesn't come on to challenge my biology.

02:46:57.155 --> 02:47:00.016
He comes on to make fun of whether or not he's a good guy or not.

02:47:01.376 --> 02:47:09.319
But what I'm suggesting to you is, if these people are good guys, then what they would say is, Jonathan Cooey's a dick, but he's gosh darn right about this stuff.

02:47:10.922 --> 02:47:11.582
and they don't.

02:47:12.683 --> 02:47:13.543
And that's how you know.

02:47:14.784 --> 02:47:15.725
That's really what I think.

02:47:15.805 --> 02:47:18.626
I think that's how easy, that's how close we are to winning.

02:47:18.966 --> 02:47:19.867
That's it.

02:47:20.147 --> 02:47:26.670
Like if they addressed my points and just addressed the points, we would win.

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:29.012
That's what I see.

02:47:29.452 --> 02:47:33.554
So I don't really know what else to say besides that.

02:47:36.556 --> 02:47:37.216
What am I doing here?

02:47:37.256 --> 02:47:38.597
Resume, escape.

02:47:39.935 --> 02:48:08.153
this one current slide switching over to here oh no here so anyway um this video will be up uh right away i think i'm also live on twitch i'm not sure i think i am um i tried to stream it straight because i didn't want to try and edit it um this has been gigo and biological just trying to give another presentation where somebody gets it right um

02:48:09.414 --> 02:48:10.535
I'm gonna be back online.

02:48:10.555 --> 02:48:12.917
I had some problems with my sound.

02:48:12.958 --> 02:48:14.079
How is the sound right now?

02:48:14.139 --> 02:48:28.094
By the way, that's a great question I have two sound boards in cooperation now one under the table and one over here because the 48 volt phantom power in this big board went out and so I had to

02:48:29.278 --> 02:48:30.379
regulate this a little bit.

02:48:30.419 --> 02:48:33.522
And it wasn't very, the solution is not elegant.

02:48:34.162 --> 02:48:37.925
So there's a new piece of equipment coming from eBay in the next couple of days.

02:48:37.965 --> 02:48:41.048
But if the sound is good, then I guess I solved the problem.

02:48:41.068 --> 02:48:42.489
And that means I can stream tomorrow.

02:48:43.069 --> 02:48:47.273
Thank you very much for being here and for having the patience to follow me as long as you have.

02:48:47.353 --> 02:48:53.738
And if you can, and aren't already, please go to Gingko and Biological and find a way to support the stream.

02:48:54.699 --> 02:48:55.259
Thank you very much.

02:48:55.279 --> 02:48:56.160
And I'll see you again tomorrow.
