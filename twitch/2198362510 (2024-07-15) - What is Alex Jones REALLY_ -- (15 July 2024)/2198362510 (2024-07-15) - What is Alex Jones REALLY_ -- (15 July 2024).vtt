WEBVTT

00:42.415 --> 01:00.950
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.251
It's just a big hassle in the end.

01:03.852 --> 01:11.618
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75 percent mortality and

01:16.182 --> 01:19.545
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:19.605 --> 01:22.106
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

01:30.472 --> 01:49.004
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:49.024 --> 01:58.591
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

02:00.788 --> 02:02.348
I think truth is good for kids.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.569
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.730
We want everybody to feel good.

02:08.850 --> 02:11.091
That's not the way life is.

02:13.631 --> 02:15.132
But you can tell if someone's lying.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.552
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:19.353 --> 02:20.073
And I have lied.

02:20.253 --> 02:21.133
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:21.153 --> 02:22.073
I don't want to lie.

02:22.573 --> 02:23.914
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:24.014 --> 02:25.054
I try not to be a liar.

02:25.074 --> 02:25.934
I don't want to be a liar.

02:26.494 --> 02:29.215
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

02:31.587 --> 02:34.728
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:35.229 --> 02:37.029
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:39.030 --> 02:39.770
Isolation, what was it?

02:39.930 --> 02:41.171
Isolation and purification.

02:42.892 --> 02:43.612
Of the virus?

02:43.692 --> 02:43.892
Yes.

02:45.153 --> 02:46.913
Well, you isolate a virus by

02:53.709 --> 02:56.192
finding the virus which causes a disease.

02:56.852 --> 03:01.717
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

03:02.518 --> 03:04.540
I don't understand what the issue.

03:04.660 --> 03:10.105
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

03:11.207 --> 03:12.328
No, it depends on how they used it.

03:12.348 --> 03:14.069
Okay.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.632
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

03:19.215 --> 03:21.116
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

03:21.196 --> 03:23.038
I mean, he actually isolated it.

03:23.298 --> 03:27.221
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:27.301 --> 03:29.362
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:33.646 --> 03:36.207
Just, it's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

03:36.227 --> 03:39.550
I'm afraid the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:01.078 --> 04:03.840
He is the life of parties he has never attended.

04:06.042 --> 04:10.085
If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.

04:10.105 --> 04:14.008
When in Rome, they do as he does.

04:15.669 --> 04:18.551
He is the most interesting man in the world.

04:21.173 --> 04:26.937
I don't always ruin things, but when I do, I prefer the Great Reset.

04:27.998 --> 04:29.219
Stay awake, my friends.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.655
That should have been in black and white.

04:33.695 --> 04:34.980
Darn it, I screwed that up.

05:00.623 --> 05:09.045
I step out the front door like a ghost into a fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white.

05:09.065 --> 05:19.008
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

05:20.168 --> 05:27.630
I walk in the air between the rain through myself and back again where, I don't know,

05:30.213 --> 05:51.031
Maria says she's dying Through the door I hear her crying Why, I don't know Around here We always stand up straight Around here Something radiates

06:01.254 --> 06:19.902
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land Just like she's walking on a wire in a circus

06:21.772 --> 06:26.335
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off.

06:26.955 --> 06:30.258
Says she's close to understanding Jesus.

06:31.098 --> 06:35.741
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood.

06:36.361 --> 06:44.727
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous around here.

06:44.847 --> 06:47.929
Carving out our names.

07:06.957 --> 07:14.325
But we sacrifice like lambs around here.

07:15.286 --> 07:23.394
She's slipping through my hands.

07:23.595 --> 07:26.598
Home, sleep into the morning.

07:35.442 --> 08:00.542
Mama's little baby better get herself in Oh, you blame her She says it's only in my head She says, I know it's only in my head

08:04.471 --> 08:09.397
But the girl on the car in the parking lot says, man, you should try to take a shot.

08:09.898 --> 08:13.262
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?

08:14.023 --> 08:18.869
And she looks up at the building, says she's thinking of jumping.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.172
She says she's tired of life.

08:21.773 --> 08:23.675
She must be tired of something.

08:36.889 --> 08:42.930
Man, I got lots of time.

08:43.991 --> 08:49.092
Around here, we never sense a better wind.

08:49.292 --> 08:53.633
Man, nobody makes us wait.

08:54.333 --> 09:03.775
Around here, we stay up very, very, very, very late.

09:04.395 --> 09:06.596
I can't see nothing.

09:09.432 --> 09:31.059
Around here You catch me if I'm fallin' You catch me if I'm fallin' You catch me cause I'm fallin' down on you I set off under the gun Around here

09:35.643 --> 09:44.028
Man, I said I'm under the gun around here.

09:44.848 --> 09:55.635
And I can't see nothing, nothing around here.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.437
The End

10:44.326 --> 10:44.387
you

11:06.576 --> 11:10.278
It does look like the Counting Crows landed a little flat.

11:10.859 --> 11:11.599
That's okay.

11:12.660 --> 11:13.360
I don't know why.

11:13.420 --> 11:17.282
It was just something that popped into my playlist today.

11:18.483 --> 11:21.084
It used to be music that I listened to way back when.

11:21.845 --> 11:22.245
I don't know.

11:23.106 --> 11:26.568
Sorry I failed on the DJ thing today if you didn't like it.

11:27.428 --> 11:32.811
We're still here trying to dispel the enchantment and the music is supposed to be a little bit of an on-ramp.

11:34.312 --> 11:40.214
can't always be Def Leppard or Pantera, and so that's where we are.

11:40.234 --> 11:48.117
I think interesting times are not really how I would describe it anymore.

11:48.137 --> 11:50.598
I would describe it a little more malevolent than that.

11:52.959 --> 11:53.619
The truth

11:55.166 --> 12:13.319
is hard to find nowadays and i don't i i didn't do a stream yesterday because i was actually pretty confident i didn't know what the hell was going on and i didn't know what the truth was and therefore it didn't seem very it didn't seem very smart for me to um go live yesterday and uh instead

12:15.509 --> 12:26.935
You know, there's still no focus on any of these ideas, placebo batches, you know, nobody giving you an infectious clones, you know, lecture.

12:26.995 --> 12:29.776
There's nobody talking about transfection and transformation.

12:31.557 --> 12:37.020
And it just feels really like the protocols are basically out of everybody's mind.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.442
I mean, if you said ventilators sometime in 2021, I guess that's all you had to do.

12:42.522 --> 12:46.586
Or if you said Remdesivir sometime in 2021, I guess that's all you had to do.

12:47.126 --> 12:56.675
And we're still just accepting this mythology of gain of function, and we're still running behind people who claim to be solving this Scooby-Doo mystery still.

12:56.795 --> 13:02.920
That's the mainstream narrative right now, that the mystery's been solved and the left doesn't want to accept it.

13:05.031 --> 13:14.814
I'm afraid the weaponized piles of money that had convinced us to argue about the novel virus are now convincing us to argue about the happenings over the weekend.

13:15.074 --> 13:16.534
You know, what really happened.

13:18.775 --> 13:25.916
Did the guy who shot at Donald Trump really live, really live just down the street from me?

13:29.417 --> 13:30.057
Yeah, he did.

13:30.918 --> 13:31.938
Apparently the guy,

13:32.873 --> 13:34.674
lived like right up the block.

13:35.094 --> 13:48.480
I have a photograph on my phone of me on my dog walk and met somebody on my way up there that was coming back from their walk and said they had just been interviewed on the local news.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.442
And they had it closed for most of the day yesterday, the street up there.

13:52.462 --> 13:53.502
I don't know what they were doing.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.383
I mean, I assume

13:55.583 --> 13:58.645
you know, trying to figure out whether he's the real bad guy or not.

13:58.685 --> 14:08.130
And then there's all these things going around the internet that that's not the real, or he is the real bad guy, or, you know, his name is Crooks and his dad was in a Black Rock video.

14:09.851 --> 14:12.793
Bethel Park High School, that's what they say on BBC.

14:12.853 --> 14:13.633
That's what they said.

14:13.673 --> 14:15.434
He graduated in 2022.

14:15.474 --> 14:18.936
I don't know.

14:19.077 --> 14:19.977
I don't know the truth.

14:20.057 --> 14:24.820
I just know that we are seeing things because we are being allowed to see them.

14:26.949 --> 14:35.671
I still have a hard time getting my head around the idea that possibly some of these things escape their control, but I guess it's possible.

14:36.451 --> 14:46.693
I guess it's possible the plan didn't go as they wanted or the increasing likelihood of this randomly happening didn't quite come to fruition.

14:46.713 --> 14:49.254
I don't know how to see it.

14:49.354 --> 14:49.974
I really don't.

14:50.074 --> 14:53.895
All I know for sure is that it's evidence that our country is not out of danger.

14:55.379 --> 15:15.599
It is evidence that these weaponized piles of money that are trying to divide us in every way possible to dice us up into a million meaningless communities instead of having us organize in the only meaningful communities that matter, our town halls, our school boards, that's what this is all about.

15:16.590 --> 15:33.898
And so although I am gonna be focused on the biology for the rest of the summer most of the time, it's important to take days like this to see that this malevolent mythology that's governing us, that's been placed on the internet by these weaponized piles of money is real.

15:34.878 --> 15:35.859
It's very real.

15:36.059 --> 15:40.721
And they organized it before the pandemic was ever even announced.

15:42.369 --> 15:54.884
because as Mark Van Rans said in front of the Chatham House in 2019 or whenever it was about the 2009 swine flu, we didn't have control over the messaging like you do now.

15:54.985 --> 15:58.249
What we would have done with Facebook, oh my gosh, chef's kiss.

15:59.591 --> 16:19.277
And so we're there now, we're in 2024, we are five years into this operation, and I am desperately trying to show people that some of these people, wittingly or unwittingly, were put in place early and participated in the bamboozlement of us, our families, our children, our communities, and our nation, and our world.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.298
And we are still being governed by these same people today.

16:27.140 --> 16:28.080
That's the truth, Ruth.

16:40.319 --> 16:43.000
I mean, yeah, of course they likely used the guy.

16:43.060 --> 16:51.781
If it's real, if there were real shots fired by a real dude on the roof, then I guess security didn't do their job.

16:53.202 --> 16:56.923
Something really badly went wrong there, and then something missed.

16:58.743 --> 17:02.964
I'm under the understanding that some people died yesterday, though, or one person died at least.

17:04.201 --> 17:16.692
And so, um, as we try to wake up to the illusion of AI and the illusion of, of their, their goal, just to collect data in hopes that someday they'll be able to solve the problem.

17:17.192 --> 17:21.436
We need to look at our history and realize that they've been lying to us like this for a very long time.

17:21.496 --> 17:22.877
These orchestrated events.

17:23.462 --> 17:29.467
These orchestrated narratives are essentially how America has been run for a very long time.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.029
That doesn't mean Americans are bad.

17:32.089 --> 17:34.811
It doesn't mean America as an idea is bad.

17:34.851 --> 17:42.077
But it does mean that the people that have been in the driver's seat have been metaphorically running over a lot of people around the world for a long time.

17:42.117 --> 17:45.320
And we need to take control of our vehicle again.

17:45.921 --> 17:47.382
That's what really needs to happen.

17:50.177 --> 17:52.638
Oh wow, that was not really a good break there.

17:52.678 --> 17:53.599
That was the wrong button.

17:53.779 --> 17:56.380
Again, I remember I had to program all this in again today.

17:59.081 --> 18:05.324
The charlatans that have power over us are not just these people that we inherited from our parents, but it's also these people.

18:05.344 --> 18:18.470
And we need to be aware of it, that the pandemic exercise, the national security operation that was and is remaining to be operating on us, includes these people, at least many of them.

18:19.230 --> 18:25.581
And if we're going to make gentle the life of this world as we move forward, we're going to need to break through every one of their illusions.

18:26.903 --> 18:29.687
And their illusions could include this picture.

18:31.963 --> 18:47.067
Because on the internet, I believe it is now very visible to me that these people have created an illusion of consensus about what questions to ask, and what people are asking the right questions, and which people everyone should pay attention to.

18:50.248 --> 18:56.415
And that illusion of consensus, if it's not shown to your children correctly, they will be swallowed up in it.

18:56.876 --> 19:01.040
If it's not shown to your relatives correctly, they will be swallowed up in it.

19:01.180 --> 19:09.390
And they will think that the 40 comments that come after someone's post are all spontaneous conversations that

19:10.327 --> 19:13.650
illusions of consensus just happen randomly and that's not true.

19:13.690 --> 19:24.942
The only way that you're gonna see through this or your kids are gonna see through it is if you frame their contradictory information, their counter information in the biology.

19:25.562 --> 19:28.465
You don't take their bait on social media and you love your neighbor.

19:29.306 --> 19:31.949
It's not a generic statement, love your neighbor.

19:33.246 --> 19:36.349
It's about setting an example with your heart.

19:36.629 --> 19:46.076
It's about setting an example with your actions, with your words, saying what you mean and meaning what you say, and telling your neighbor the truth.

19:47.097 --> 19:52.761
It might not feel like love right away, but in the end, this is what we need to do.

19:52.801 --> 19:56.104
We need to inform, and we need to spread the word as often as we can.

19:56.124 --> 19:59.126
Giga Home Biological is going to try to be on.

19:59.146 --> 20:00.648
I'm going to try to be on every day.

20:04.593 --> 20:15.616
I have done 53 daily shows in a row once, but I don't think that record is going to be broken by me anytime soon, just because there are times when I get gassed out.

20:15.776 --> 20:20.938
I mean, I feel like I've worked so hard and spread myself so thin that I need a day off.

20:20.978 --> 20:27.279
And yesterday, I just needed a friend to come over and troubleshoot a computer build with me and have a beer.

20:27.619 --> 20:28.760
And so that's what happened.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.020
And I feel a lot better for it.

20:31.935 --> 20:37.197
Sometimes we all need a day off and so I worked on Saturday and took Sunday off instead.

20:37.217 --> 20:39.137
Maybe that's how I should be doing it more often.

20:39.757 --> 20:41.638
The paradigm shift is happening right now.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.719
People are panicking, panicking.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.580
It's kind of a freak out right now.

20:48.820 --> 20:52.001
And if you want to see it, we're going to take a look at it today.

20:52.061 --> 20:53.501
I think that's really a good idea.

20:53.581 --> 20:59.583
We take a look at it today so that we can start engaging in United Noncompliance by ignoring these people.

21:03.770 --> 21:03.910
do

21:35.849 --> 21:36.670
Oh, there it is.

21:36.810 --> 21:37.510
Good evening.

21:37.570 --> 21:38.250
Good afternoon.

21:38.290 --> 21:39.011
Good morning.

21:39.271 --> 21:40.351
Good afternoon for me.

21:40.371 --> 21:42.032
It is the 15th of July 2024.

21:43.233 --> 21:44.193
Welcome to the show.

21:45.273 --> 21:50.256
This is giga ohm biological high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.537
I'm very happy to be here today.

21:52.597 --> 21:54.857
I apologize for not being here yesterday.

21:55.678 --> 21:59.219
Quite an interesting, traumatic, dramatic day.

22:00.759 --> 22:02.780
And so I think now we have enough.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.100
I don't know why I'm back there too.

22:04.980 --> 22:12.403
I think we have enough now to follow up on that and try to get an idea of, try to put it in the framework of what's happening now.

22:14.155 --> 22:33.285
There's been some revealing things on the internet lately, behaviors, patterns of behavior, patterns of rhetoric among the clown show, that I think it's finally time to push some of these ideas forward now, and some of these characters need to leave the scene.

22:34.126 --> 22:34.846
Hold on one second.

22:46.323 --> 22:59.452
It is really, really a crucial time right now where an entire house of cards could, in theory, be brought down if we can bring our fellow humans to see these liars for who they are.

22:59.492 --> 23:01.373
And they might not all be witting liars.

23:01.433 --> 23:03.194
Some of them might have guns to their heads.

23:03.234 --> 23:04.735
Some of them might have been coerced.

23:05.436 --> 23:07.777
But a lot of them are doing their job.

23:09.758 --> 23:14.902
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

23:15.822 --> 23:20.365
transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

23:20.845 --> 23:28.589
The reality is, is that weaponized piles of money have gotten us to agree to argue about the origin of the virus and not worry about the countermeasures.

23:29.170 --> 23:41.557
And by accepting this argument, this mystery that needs solving and working very vigorously on it for four years, we have come to accept the premise of it, which is a novel virus that either leaked or was released

23:44.878 --> 24:12.032
And we are still being governed by these same weaponized piles of money and the same clown shows that were put in front of us as part of this military operation to make sure that we never asked meaningful questions until the time ran out on our young people, our young families, our young children and young adults in college, who are now permanently gone because these weaponized piles of money convinced us to argue about the novel virus instead of protecting them.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.448
And so since we argued about the novel virus, we let them go back to college.

24:19.569 --> 24:25.392
And they too have accepted the existence of a novel virus because they had to lock down in their dorms and wear masks.

24:25.512 --> 24:27.873
And everybody was taking it very seriously.

24:28.273 --> 24:37.377
This illusion is sustained by this, by us being ineffective at pushing back from it.

24:37.417 --> 24:40.579
And we need to push back from it now because this, this,

24:42.597 --> 24:47.862
limited spectrum of debate can be broken now, and it might not be able to be broken in a couple more years.

24:49.424 --> 24:56.711
The way that we have been consciously and intelligently manipulated by these people can be broken, but maybe not in a few years.

24:58.292 --> 24:59.594
It can't be history.

24:59.674 --> 25:00.675
It's got to be now.

25:05.694 --> 25:20.403
Now, if we try to pay attention to some of the things and some of the things we looked at last week were that it seemed like the virus debate about the flu was being sort of bookended by two very odd sources of information.

25:20.624 --> 25:33.912
One, Robert Malone, the DITRA World Health Organization, DOD, I don't know what, executive service dude, and the Brownstone Institute and CHD.

25:35.765 --> 25:43.487
where the Brownstone Institute and CHD were saying that, well, there is gain of function, and we've done gain of function on flu lots of times.

25:44.207 --> 25:48.868
And then Robert Malone saying, well, you know, there is flu and it does jump, but it's no reason to be crazy.

25:48.908 --> 25:52.429
And sure, we've tried to work on it, but it doesn't mean that it got out.

25:52.989 --> 25:55.670
Reasonable and alarmist.

25:58.530 --> 26:09.960
And they are part of this controlled debate that does not question the existence of these novel viruses and the doesn't question the background on which these novel viruses are being lifted.

26:12.743 --> 26:25.634
I have two of these texts squared out here because I want you to see the message that they are giving right after the attempted assassination of presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump.

26:26.704 --> 26:31.747
You experienced it all on mainstream television, says Brownstone.

26:32.187 --> 26:35.309
The Facebook empire became practically useless for information.

26:35.349 --> 26:38.811
The one major source for news was Elon Musk's ex.

26:41.553 --> 26:44.275
It is because of this platform that we know what we know.

26:46.976 --> 26:47.637
Stop lying!

26:49.375 --> 27:00.809
Everyone knows a so here we saw all the broken pieces of politics state media and mental health and full display And gained insight into what happens when an elite attempts a great reset.

27:01.049 --> 27:06.115
The result is calamity Compare that language to um

27:10.697 --> 27:17.478
Compare that language up here, while slowly building internal fury regarding the assassination attempt on Trump.

27:17.678 --> 27:21.159
Internal fury, he's angry because he's so conservative.

27:22.359 --> 27:30.841
I have been reading Unhumans, the secret history of the communist revolutions and how to crush them by Jack and Joshua.

27:31.681 --> 27:33.862
And the forward is by Stephen Bannon.

27:33.922 --> 27:38.983
My guess is, is that there's a better book or two about communist revolutions than that one.

27:41.794 --> 27:42.555
That's my guess.

27:42.935 --> 27:45.738
I mean, maybe they should have called it Bolshevik Revolution.

27:45.778 --> 27:48.340
Maybe they should have, you know, the War of...

27:49.292 --> 27:52.194
I don't know, the War of the Flea, something like that.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.415
Maybe that would be a better recommendation.

27:54.495 --> 27:58.337
And then I received this essay as a forwarded recommendation from a friend.

27:58.857 --> 28:03.880
I recommend that you read both this essay and the book because, you know, that's what people do all the time now.

28:03.940 --> 28:06.261
They download essays and buy books and read them.

28:07.222 --> 28:11.764
And then it says, put your big boy and girl pants on and get ready to act.

28:11.844 --> 28:16.067
I cannot predict what is about to happen, but it's not going to be a gentlemanly disagreement.

28:16.767 --> 28:17.448
Stop lying.

28:19.693 --> 28:36.441
So the Brownstone and Robert Malone, the two sources of information that have been bookending the debate on avian flu pandemics, now think that an uprising and action is going to be necessary.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.321
It's not going to be a gentlemanly disagreement.

28:38.361 --> 28:39.422
It could be a calamity.

28:47.873 --> 28:50.995
I find it very, very strange, ladies and gentlemen.

28:51.015 --> 28:53.857
We are up against something very dark and malevolent.

28:56.779 --> 29:05.586
This video was released by my friend Mark Kulak a day or so ago, and a blog post about it was released by

29:07.421 --> 29:12.384
Vilma, which is probably in the, in the sub stack and in the, at the soap box.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.987
And it's probably also here in the chat somewhere.

29:17.908 --> 29:21.030
Let's just watch this video and think about what, what it represents.

29:21.951 --> 29:36.000
Mark put this little Lego ninja baby in front of Sasha Latupova's daughter to respect her as a possible minor in that video, but to still try to emphasize

29:37.921 --> 29:39.723
what these videos have to represent.

29:40.684 --> 29:56.899
And because there are hundreds of hours of these videos, and they are highly produced, highly scripted, highly edited, you can only see this as a malevolent operation, especially because again, we're talking about a minor, and I'm going to make that point in a few minutes.

29:56.959 --> 30:02.044
But again, we're talking about a very specific person here for a very specific reason.

30:07.662 --> 30:08.622
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.003
That's not working.

30:10.623 --> 30:11.283
Sorry about that.

30:11.563 --> 30:14.623
I guess we have a memory problem.

30:18.164 --> 30:22.005
UK cops, put them down.

30:22.645 --> 30:25.666
UK cops, kill them all.

30:26.486 --> 30:35.408
If you live in the UK and you take a gun and go to your local police station and happen to kill all, maybe all the cops in the room,

30:37.074 --> 30:39.597
It might not be the worst thing in the world.

30:40.598 --> 30:41.779
I certainly won't be crying.

30:45.143 --> 30:52.751
But I certainly find your story inspiring because even after every major platform removed you, you're still going on your own website.

30:53.251 --> 30:58.557
And I think that's a step that a lot of us need to take if we want to survive and keep making our content.

30:59.517 --> 31:05.264
Wow, okay, well, I mean, I've got three daughters and they're awesome and they're smart, but I'm impressed.

31:05.644 --> 31:07.746
Tell me something about your parents and something about yourself.

31:08.047 --> 31:10.490
I mean, don't get anything too private, but whatever's okay for you to get in.

31:10.950 --> 31:17.558
So, first of all, realize that this is before the pandemic, by a few months.

31:19.272 --> 31:36.323
exactly the same timing as the Peter Thiel interview on the portal, exactly the same timing as right before the pandemic, Sam Harris saying that, you know, measles is all a big hassle in the end, but when we get this new pandemic, we're not going to be able to tolerate anti-vaxxers anymore.

31:37.683 --> 31:38.924
This is all the same.

31:39.504 --> 31:40.845
It's all the same timing.

31:40.905 --> 31:42.266
It's all the same setup.

31:43.487 --> 31:46.409
And what you see here before the pandemic is Alex

31:47.674 --> 31:55.917
completely discredited Jones, interviewing Sasha Latupova's daughter, who might still be a minor in this video for all I know.

31:58.717 --> 32:02.919
Interviewing her after many years of being a YouTube phenomenon.

32:03.119 --> 32:08.681
And when you look at those videos, you can't see a daughter who's loved by her mom.

32:08.721 --> 32:13.182
You can't see a daughter who's being raised by a responsible adult or adults.

32:14.122 --> 32:15.143
You see child abuse.

32:17.008 --> 32:19.029
What you see is child abuse.

32:20.809 --> 32:37.954
And so even if she were to be 18 in this video when she was on Alex Jones, the whole thing with her on YouTube and the YouTube CEO and all the nonsense videos that she made before that, some of them are absolutely malevolent because it is only, can only be seen as child abuse.

32:38.034 --> 32:40.995
This is not a responsible set of parents here.

32:43.036 --> 32:45.637
It's coming and it's gonna get ugly, I assure you.

32:46.610 --> 32:48.951
into, because I think America really admires you.

32:49.972 --> 32:50.252
Thanks.

32:51.032 --> 32:54.434
My parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.895
They voted for Hillary Clinton.

32:55.955 --> 33:01.458
They're left-leaning people, but they're fine with different opinions in the family.

33:01.898 --> 33:02.759
They think that's fine.

33:02.779 --> 33:04.320
They truly believe in free speech.

33:05.160 --> 33:15.046
They don't necessarily agree with me, but they don't want to shut me down either, because they, and I think that's a stance that more left-leaning people should take, that they should be okay with, you know, ideological dissent.

33:15.754 --> 33:20.758
So your parents are more classical liberals who actually believe in freedom and their children being able to think for themselves?

33:21.519 --> 33:21.679
Yes.

33:31.511 --> 33:34.913
My parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.

33:34.973 --> 33:36.394
They voted for Hillary Clinton.

33:36.434 --> 33:37.614
They're left-leaning people.

33:37.634 --> 33:43.878
Marin County teenager is now at the center of the latest free speech versus hate speech battle.

33:43.918 --> 33:47.680
Yeah, one of her recent YouTube videos has led to a police investigation.

33:48.260 --> 33:56.887
foul-mouthed outspokenness and rants against political correctness has made her a far-right media darling and garnered her nearly a million subscribers.

33:57.507 --> 34:01.711
Some of her comments have also made her the target of at least two police investigations.

34:02.131 --> 34:05.414
One concerned an alleged threat made against the CEO of YouTube.

34:11.731 --> 34:23.576
and she knew where the CEO lived, and she had called an Uber, and she had about 10 minutes to draw up a will, and it wasn't gonna be pretty.

34:23.856 --> 34:30.719
The Tiburon Police Department determined that the threat was not credible since the 14-year-old does not have access to any firearms.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.521
UK cops killed them all.

34:36.167 --> 34:36.507
Okay.

34:36.547 --> 34:40.751
So let's just think about this very carefully because now we're going to watch.

34:40.931 --> 34:47.337
Remember, this is an Alex Jones video from a day ago talking about the Trump shooting.

34:47.417 --> 34:58.708
Remember Alex Jones, you know, 25 or 30 years ago when he was younger and he did the, the, the Bohemian Grove video, he may have already been part of the show.

34:59.943 --> 35:10.990
And if he wasn't very soon after he became part of the show, his, his whole legal thing, you know, he's got to pay a billion dollars, but they can only extract the billion dollars from his LLC.

35:11.050 --> 35:15.653
And so once they sell all the cameras and stuff like that, there's really nothing left to get.

35:16.593 --> 35:22.077
And so this has been a really big show in the legal aspects of it have been a really big show.

35:23.878 --> 35:29.001
And the bottom line is, is that he's probably just going to start another LLC and everything will be fine.

35:31.857 --> 35:36.592
So let's see what Alex has to tell us about the Trump attempt.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.520
Listen to me very carefully.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.962
I have told you for months on air they're going to try to kill Trump.

35:46.582 --> 35:50.485
And when they try to kill Trump, they're going to go after everybody else that is his top supporters.

35:50.825 --> 35:54.187
And they also will try to kill Biden and blame it on a Trump supporter.

35:54.788 --> 35:55.829
That's coming next.

35:56.729 --> 36:01.812
Make no mistake, the same deep state that's behind Biden, that's trying to make him step down, was behind this today.

36:01.832 --> 36:04.554
They're now reporting it was an Antifa shooter who's now been killed.

36:05.035 --> 36:08.077
How convenient is that, that the supposed shooter has been killed?

36:08.905 --> 36:14.390
Ladies and gentlemen, our Republic is in maximum danger right now.

36:14.950 --> 36:21.236
I'm about to go live at Infowars.com for its last show, Vandaught Video, and right here on X. There has been an attempted assassination.

36:21.997 --> 36:26.721
The real President of the United States has been shot, and by God's good graces, has survived.

36:26.741 --> 36:28.963
The bullet only grazed him over the ear and the side of his head.

36:30.544 --> 36:31.265
But ladies and gentlemen,

36:32.605 --> 36:33.827
The deep state is desperate.

36:33.867 --> 36:34.548
They are in trouble.

36:34.588 --> 36:36.050
They're going to try to expand wars.

36:36.370 --> 36:37.411
They can do power outages.

36:37.431 --> 36:38.493
They can do cyber attacks.

36:38.933 --> 36:40.756
We are in such a dangerous position.

36:41.136 --> 36:44.962
And I've noticed with all the viral videos out there, it's like, oh, he took a bullet for America.

36:45.422 --> 36:46.904
He's going to get reelected now.

36:48.027 --> 36:52.411
Ladies and gentlemen, the deep state did this, make no mistake.

36:52.632 --> 36:55.214
And that lets you know they're going for broke.

36:55.254 --> 36:58.978
Do you fucking understand what I'm telling you?

36:59.518 --> 37:03.422
Take this deadly serious, just like war with Russia.

37:04.443 --> 37:06.665
They are going to try to kill Trump again.

37:07.046 --> 37:09.948
Now that they didn't kill him once, they are completely desperate.

37:10.889 --> 37:11.730
And I'm going to tell you again.

37:12.728 --> 37:18.574
Biden won't step down, the deep state will probably kill him or try to kill him in the next few days and blame it on a Trump supporter.

37:18.894 --> 37:22.538
And we may see massive terror attacks in America that are blamed on Trump supporters.

37:22.558 --> 37:24.760
They've been pre-programming it, they've been preparing.

37:24.860 --> 37:30.466
I've been telling you, imminent assassination attempt on Trump every damn day.

37:31.187 --> 37:35.812
Because that's what a dying, corrupt establishment does when their back is against the wall.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.422
We're living in a historical moment right now.

37:40.182 --> 37:45.005
We need Americans, people around the world, to pray for President Trump and pray for America, but also politically.

37:45.325 --> 38:02.873
Get out there on X and everywhere else that has some free speech and get the point out that this- So just like the brownstone said that the only reason why we know anything we know is because of Elon Musk's X, so does Alex Jones, says exactly the same thing.

38:02.973 --> 38:04.734
Alex Jones was brought back to X

38:06.138 --> 38:13.923
The streaming capabilities on X were brought in just for Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson to take advantage of.

38:17.986 --> 38:31.995
And of course, Kevin McKernan in April of 2020 was on podcast telling everybody that the debate about the novelty or lack of novelty of the new virus was happening on Twitter.

38:32.972 --> 38:36.077
Drastic is a group of people on Twitter.

38:38.180 --> 38:46.373
One of the main weapons used against us to make sure that this pandemic in our minds would happen was Twitter.

38:50.643 --> 39:01.168
This attempted assassination that actually wounded the president, took a bullet for America, lies at the feet of the deep state and the corporate media that said, kill him, destroy him.

39:01.588 --> 39:02.589
He deserves to die.

39:02.629 --> 39:03.349
He's a fascist.

39:03.369 --> 39:04.090
He's a Nazi.

39:04.370 --> 39:06.531
It lays at their feet.

39:06.991 --> 39:10.013
Instead, I see conservatives celebrating, hey, he'll win for sure now.

39:12.534 --> 39:15.275
It means the globalists are going to go for a broke.

39:16.736 --> 39:18.257
It means they know their time is up.

39:19.901 --> 39:21.943
So I'm glad Trump survived.

39:22.063 --> 39:23.525
I am so happy.

39:23.885 --> 39:24.386
Thank God.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.146
Thank you, Jesus.

39:25.807 --> 39:29.070
But ladies and gentlemen, do you think this happened by accident?

39:29.471 --> 39:29.691
No.

39:30.292 --> 39:32.614
And do you think the system is going to back down now?

39:33.014 --> 39:33.194
No.

39:34.256 --> 39:38.360
Power outages, cyber attacks, expanded war, China invading Taiwan.

39:39.890 --> 39:40.770
Stock market crash.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.571
It's all on the table and the deep stakes behind it.

39:43.871 --> 39:47.392
I'll be covering it live coming up on X at Rillox Jones in the next 10 minutes.

39:47.592 --> 39:51.193
Join me there and share the link if you want to stop these people dead in their fucking tracks.

39:51.853 --> 39:53.893
It's not about him being a waste of space.

39:54.734 --> 39:56.394
It's about what he represents.

39:56.554 --> 39:57.354
What is he?

39:59.055 --> 40:07.337
Well, he's somebody that the weaponized piles of money pay to do what he's doing and have been paying him since before the pandemic, just like they pay Joe Rogan.

40:07.377 --> 40:08.617
But Joe Rogan is a big deal.

40:10.217 --> 40:14.598
Alex Jones, you know, you don't think about him, you don't, you don't see him, but it's all the same thing.

40:15.058 --> 40:24.320
It's all the same chorus of liars, Lollapalooza of stages, where these different groups, different groups agree that, yeah, I play with him.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.180
He's my bass player.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.080
That's my, uh, she's our lead singer.

40:30.401 --> 40:37.402
And these combinations of people are all over the internet and you just haven't been aware of them because you've only been paying attention to one band.

40:41.360 --> 40:46.061
But Alex Jones is one of the hubs of this kind of nonsense.

40:46.241 --> 40:59.344
And once you start to see the little kind of hierarchy of as Joe Rogan would promote you and then they promote and then they promote each other and they go on each other's streams, that whole thing is now super visible.

41:01.064 --> 41:02.305
It's very easy to see it.

41:03.445 --> 41:08.486
The only thing you have to do is just in your mind figure out that it's Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and a few other

41:09.571 --> 41:14.235
people that were put in place by our national security state to be like these people.

41:15.316 --> 41:17.138
Especially Elon fake Musk.

41:19.680 --> 41:26.225
So this is crazy because this is what I'm talking about when I say child abuse.

41:26.245 --> 41:27.226
This is just child abuse.

41:36.801 --> 41:38.804
Is she pretending to OD right here?

41:38.824 --> 41:42.509
Is that what that was?

41:42.709 --> 41:43.831
Just pretending to OD?

41:52.188 --> 42:21.632
the elusive lieutenant corpus is here once again to shitpost and then leave for another week because making youtube videos is such hard work oh my god but anyways i hope you all had a great fourth of july um and if you don't live in america you know what i feel bad for you because you're missing out on a quite a lot so this is a problem you know i don't enjoy watching this but this is not a an adult this is someone who's supposed to have a couple parental guardians

42:26.095 --> 42:50.831
supposed to have a couple of guiding adults supervising her, making sure that she doesn't make a mistake like this, or she's being used by the adults in her life, which is what this sure looks like, especially if you put it into context where this little girl is going to grow up into the daughter of Sasha Latupova and be promoted three times in 2019 by Alex Jones.

42:58.660 --> 43:01.502
America's basically just the entire planet.

43:02.142 --> 43:14.450
PERSONALLY, I spent my entire Mercaday comping while watching fireworks, cuz I don't know if you noticed, but comping is the shit, and also it's the most patriotic thing an American person can do.

43:14.611 --> 43:25.498
I think we can all agree there's nothing quite like scarring some pure Christian Boy Scouts on a calm summer evening while getting your, uh, your sweet land of liberty liberated to the maximum.

43:26.058 --> 43:36.575
I wanted to tell you all a story of how I almost I Guess I almost got injured cuz I know I didn't almost fucking die and luckily enough.

43:36.635 --> 43:38.779
I don't do that shit Okay enough of that

43:43.061 --> 43:49.569
let's watch her when she's probably closer to the age where we she's probably now maybe 17 or 18 here I don't know how old this is but I believe this is the place where Sasha's picture with her and her daughter

44:03.405 --> 44:13.249
that she posted a few months ago in some of these contexts on the internet where she's losing her mind, which is, again, kind of sad for her daughter.

44:13.269 --> 44:17.831
And I think this video would be the place where these things were done.

44:19.031 --> 44:25.454
And so let's see how she trains or what kind of video she will make as a young adult.

44:25.694 --> 44:27.635
I don't know if this is a very old child here.

44:28.615 --> 44:32.857
Let's see what kind of video she'll make, because I think this will surprise you quite a bit.

44:33.911 --> 44:38.094
and false flag shootings, you might be wondering, how do I get on in on the action, you know?

44:38.154 --> 44:41.156
What do I gotta do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

44:41.176 --> 44:45.518
How do I get on in on that action?

44:45.979 --> 44:52.563
Lucky for you, citizen of the United States, and by this bill, you might be wondering, how do I get on in on the action, you know?

44:52.623 --> 44:55.585
What do I gotta do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

44:58.114 --> 44:59.955
How do I get in on that action?

45:00.435 --> 45:09.961
Lucky for you, citizen of the United States, and Biden's Build Back Better bill, because he loves you so much, absconded in the 10,000 pages federal false flag subsidization program.

45:10.061 --> 45:13.803
For example, if you're thinking, you know what, maybe I don't have the nerve to do something crazy.

45:13.823 --> 45:16.105
We'll give you all the SSRIs and fluoride you need.

45:16.125 --> 45:18.526
You're thinking, where do I get the money for these fancy guns?

45:18.726 --> 45:19.707
Where do you think these, like,

45:20.007 --> 45:39.672
mentally ill mcdonalds workers got the money from in this economy if you're wondering where to get money from just go on the internet and say that you're having violent thoughts all of our boys will swarm in there onto your venmo account to send you money our best discord groomers to your discord account to give you all the instruction manuals the quick rundowns and everything really we're trying to make this as easy for you as possible especially if you're a minority

45:39.952 --> 45:43.856
If you're retarded in some way, we have all the affirmative action to get you on your feet.

45:43.936 --> 45:47.039
Before you get started, though, we don't want you to injure yourself in any way, at least not yet.

45:47.059 --> 45:48.780
You can do that after it's all said and done.

45:48.800 --> 45:54.766
Here's a little thing you gotta know about gun safety, first of all, is you want to be waving it in as many directions as possible at all times.

45:55.306 --> 45:55.646
Loaded.

45:55.666 --> 45:58.048
Check the chamber to make sure there's a bullet in there.

45:58.329 --> 45:59.429
Just have fun with it, really.

45:59.750 --> 46:00.290
Do it for me.

46:00.911 --> 46:01.871
Do it to save the white brains.

46:02.131 --> 46:02.632
Hey, what's up, guys?

46:02.652 --> 46:03.132
It's Soph here.

46:03.152 --> 46:04.353
Just getting ready for the Pride Parade.

46:04.934 --> 46:05.234
Oh, hey.

46:05.574 --> 46:06.255
Didn't see you there.

46:06.515 --> 46:11.098
I'm just here getting ready to go to the Pride Parade, considering I'm going to a GSA meet pretty soon.

46:11.298 --> 46:15.422
So when you're kind of, you know, playing around with a gun as you do, you should always be playing around with it.

46:15.442 --> 46:22.587
You want to keep your finger directly on the trigger so you're always ready in case any sort of homosexual person strolls by.

46:22.607 --> 46:24.869
I need to see you holding the gun like this, okay?

46:26.118 --> 46:27.281
I want you to take yourself out.

46:27.542 --> 46:33.538
The way you gotta do it, you gotta take your gun like so, thusly, and, you know, shoot yourself in the back of the head.

46:35.066 --> 46:39.509
So guys, one of the classic ways to make your whole thing more comical is going akimbo.

46:40.430 --> 46:42.532
Very impractical, very untactical.

46:42.572 --> 46:46.114
You want to make sure you're really close together so you don't start hitting each other when you're trying to shoot.

46:46.835 --> 46:53.980
You start colliding with each other, you're shooting your other gun with each other.

46:54.020 --> 46:58.724
If you're worried your gun might be malfunctioning, it isn't working properly, just make sure to test it on yourself.

47:05.675 --> 47:10.178
Alright guys, you wanna make sure to do some shenanigans as far as, you know, how many bullets your man is actually carrying.

47:10.218 --> 47:12.279
Just make it so that the numbers don't add up.

47:18.322 --> 47:24.846
So, just in case you're not very imaginative, I'll give you some ideas of what sort of things you're supposed to say when you're shooting, okay?

47:24.906 --> 47:25.747
Alright.

47:26.227 --> 47:30.329
I'm doing this for you, Hitler!

47:31.770 --> 47:32.851
I'm doing this for you, Trump!

47:34.622 --> 47:36.785
This is the most offensive one of them all, okay?

47:36.845 --> 47:37.846
Use this one with caution.

47:39.008 --> 47:39.949
Let's go, Brandon!

47:41.111 --> 47:42.352
Subscribe to PewDiePie!

47:43.955 --> 47:46.438
That's resilience!

47:51.245 --> 47:52.066
You find that funny?

47:53.254 --> 47:54.596
You find that satirical?

47:55.016 --> 47:59.321
You find that normal for some late teen to be doing?

47:59.902 --> 48:05.368
Did you find that earlier video normal for a 13, 12 year old girl to be doing?

48:08.151 --> 48:09.353
I don't find it normal.

48:10.802 --> 48:12.003
My kids aren't doing that.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.043
I wouldn't allow my child to do that.

48:14.083 --> 48:23.607
I wouldn't allow my 14 year old boy to make any video even remotely close to anything that might even resemble two guns in each, a gun in each hand.

48:30.190 --> 48:38.113
This, this is the girl that supposedly, you know, isn't really guilty of anything with regard to

48:40.350 --> 48:42.132
It's just all, it's all satire.

48:43.593 --> 48:46.475
Now it is time for lefties losing it.

48:46.575 --> 48:50.659
It's been a big day for the demented, deranged and deluded.

48:50.799 --> 48:54.142
Triple D, triple threat, triple the unhinged.

48:54.602 --> 49:01.529
I mean, truly the left have come out of the woodwork because of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump.

49:02.009 --> 49:05.312
So I'm just warning you, warning you now of the Trump.

49:05.452 --> 49:09.735
Sky News Australia is part of the Five Eyes controlled demolition of America.

49:09.855 --> 49:13.497
Around the world, the idea of America has to be destroyed.

49:14.338 --> 49:20.182
The idea of what America means and what the American culture stands for has to be destroyed.

49:25.065 --> 49:31.810
And so, even though you and I grew up in a country where it was supposed to mean honesty and hard work,

49:34.631 --> 49:37.614
Sacrifice planting trees that you'll never shade under.

49:40.116 --> 49:46.483
These people around the world are taking a lot of pleasure in the controlled demolition of America.

49:46.503 --> 49:54.831
And what I need you to see is what she's about to show you could just easily be another weaponized pile of money version of SOF.

49:56.018 --> 50:09.325
that is being perpetuated, being sucked out of the internet and amplified by news programs around the world with the desire to slowly but surely control, demolish the idea of America.

50:10.225 --> 50:12.706
Not America, the idea of America.

50:14.047 --> 50:22.391
And that's why you're going to see on Sky News Australia, a lot of the people that are involved in this clown show.

50:24.915 --> 50:27.716
And that's why you see these people so happy about it.

50:29.316 --> 50:30.316
Because that's the idea.

50:30.376 --> 50:32.477
It's not tragic what's happening in America.

50:32.957 --> 50:39.399
The idea that America is out of our control as American citizens is not alarming to them.

50:39.459 --> 50:42.719
This is fun and it's exciting and it's hilarious.

50:45.380 --> 50:49.641
They're not concerned about their ally being undermined from the inside.

50:49.701 --> 50:53.102
They're not concerned about their ally, their former

50:54.369 --> 50:59.913
Ally Being undermined by globalist traitors by communist traitors.

50:59.953 --> 51:23.829
They're not worried about it at all They think it's hilarious that finally America's lost control of themselves or their their government What they don't want you to know is that they've we lost control of this government already a long time ago And that these weaponized piles of money have been organizing getting ready for this

51:25.560 --> 51:27.503
And that's why it's so fluid right now.

51:27.543 --> 51:29.686
That's why this woman exists.

51:30.928 --> 51:41.242
That's why the TikTok influencers that she will now show you exist for the same reason that Soph existed before the pandemic.

51:42.523 --> 51:47.047
And I would argue the same reason why her mom was elevated during the pandemic.

51:47.187 --> 51:51.831
It is artificial, fake, clown shows.

51:52.632 --> 51:54.313
They are side shows.

51:55.034 --> 51:58.237
They're just another stage on the Lollapalooza of liars.

51:59.658 --> 52:01.219
And they have them all around the world.

52:01.479 --> 52:10.147
Australia watches them, watches in their own representation because they're watching a different set of stages than we can see at our Lollapalooza.

52:15.512 --> 52:17.394
derangement syndrome ahead.

52:18.034 --> 52:26.101
Let's start with this guy who looks as though he doesn't know if he wants to be part of a boy band or is transitioning perhaps to emo.

52:26.121 --> 52:28.223
How do you miss that?

52:29.824 --> 52:31.726
We don't miss those.

52:33.127 --> 52:34.408
Come on man.

52:35.189 --> 52:36.950
We don't miss those.

52:37.210 --> 52:38.712
And so now we're promoting

52:39.753 --> 52:48.201
The craziest people on the internet as an illusion of consensus about what's happening in America and we're taking pleasure in doing it.

52:48.901 --> 52:50.383
We're getting paid to do it.

52:51.083 --> 52:52.785
We're getting famous to do it.

52:53.846 --> 52:56.448
We're called all stars for doing it.

52:57.949 --> 53:01.292
They call each other all stars on the Sky News.

53:01.352 --> 53:03.014
The all stars from Sky News.

53:04.738 --> 53:09.709
They're all stars because on the internet, a lot of people watch them on purpose.

53:10.491 --> 53:11.493
It's on purpose.

53:14.212 --> 53:17.174
And that video goes on and on to show you lots of this stuff.

53:17.214 --> 53:19.596
I don't want to put you through that because we have work to do.

53:20.136 --> 53:21.937
But I need you to see it for what it is.

53:22.137 --> 53:26.600
One shot at greatness to be mentioned in the history books.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.061
And you missed the shot.

53:28.261 --> 53:30.603
Trump did after he was shot.

53:30.723 --> 53:31.543
What did it say?

53:31.583 --> 53:38.228
So this guy, for example, is a guy who has been on Tim Pool a lot.

53:39.348 --> 53:47.832
has been in a music video produced by Mickey Willis with Nurse Aaron and Robert Malone and a bunch of other guys.

53:48.533 --> 53:50.354
A few music videos actually.

53:50.794 --> 53:53.375
And now this guy is also speaking on Sky News.

53:53.415 --> 54:03.540
Do you see it's the same network of people working with the same outlets, media outlets that are artificially elevated on these social platforms.

54:05.057 --> 54:08.398
They are part of the controlled demolition of America.

54:08.658 --> 54:15.480
That guy, Alex Stein, for example, is intimately involved, just like Rubin and Weinstein.

54:16.980 --> 54:28.603
They are intimately involved in masquerading as people who are speaking out, but essentially create the illusion of consensus that reinforces the presupposition of the state.

54:31.912 --> 54:35.214
And so now, why are we concerned about Sasha Latapova?

54:35.254 --> 54:45.658
Well, here's Sasha Latapova, I presume, responding to some of the commentary on La Gata Politica.

54:46.659 --> 54:50.901
That's a substack written by a woman by the name of Vilma, and Vilma is

54:53.027 --> 54:54.088
I think she's an ally.

54:54.128 --> 54:55.068
I think she's a friend.

54:55.128 --> 54:57.030
I think she's fighting against communists.

54:57.270 --> 55:02.413
I think she might have the life experience to know when communists are pulling their shit.

55:03.014 --> 55:10.658
And so here we have Sasha Latupova not trying to have a reasonable discussion, but actually going really quite bananas.

55:10.719 --> 55:10.819
Now,

55:11.579 --> 55:30.425
this this is revealing of course oh gosh of course save every word i need the records of the pedo attraction cyber stalking of minors by you your pal hooey cooey and other degenerate biden voting fed american hater foreign meddlers in your group you see

55:31.710 --> 55:33.651
So she tries to absorb everything.

55:33.691 --> 55:47.118
We have foreign meddlers like Jonathan Engler and Claire Craig, and we have Biden voting people like her, Sasha Latipova, because her daughter even said it on Alex Jones.

55:47.158 --> 55:48.879
We have Brett Weinstein.

55:48.919 --> 55:57.864
We have Jill Glasspool Malone and Robert Malone, who were huge, staunch supporters of Obama and Biden and have

55:58.224 --> 56:00.566
been complimentary to people like Peter Hotez.

56:01.026 --> 56:19.016
And so these people, like Steve Kirsch, who was one of the largest private donors to the Democratic National Committee before the pandemic, these people are pretending to be conservatives, pretending to support Bobby as an alternative conservative candidate.

56:19.136 --> 56:21.057
And they are definitely lying.

56:21.077 --> 56:21.498
Stop lying!

56:22.418 --> 56:31.819
And so here you have this woman who's got to desperately, desperately try to increase her significance in the story.

56:33.584 --> 56:43.006
And she does it by trying to get any attention possible so that we're afraid to look at the evidence of child abuse in her daughter's life.

56:44.066 --> 57:00.050
She wants us to think that, ooh, if we watch those videos that she allowed to be produced and put on the internet, that Sasha allowed to be produced and put on the internet and remain on the internet now, they are evidence of her malevolence.

57:01.647 --> 57:13.851
They're evidence of her malevolence as a mom and probably her malevolence as not a patriot of America, but some kind of foreign allegiance, meddler, Ukrainian something, something, I don't know.

57:14.891 --> 57:20.993
But she's not just this retired pharma exec who's trying to raise kids in a dangerous world.

57:22.893 --> 57:28.815
And that was what you should see when you look at these old videos of her daughter, of which there are hundreds of hours.

57:31.667 --> 57:34.388
The second one over here, you've been my subscriber for a while.

57:34.448 --> 57:35.968
I haven't said or done anything bad to you.

57:36.008 --> 57:42.729
You find an idiot online who is green with hatred and immediately zero in on this material which is freely available and half of it is my own photos.

57:44.050 --> 57:45.190
Yeah, that's the point.

57:45.230 --> 57:49.991
That's why I showed that gun range video where she probably was filmed by Sasha.

57:51.351 --> 57:55.952
Sasha was probably holding the camera and they took a picture together with the rifles after they were done.

57:57.292 --> 57:58.032
Don't you see?

57:59.073 --> 58:00.233
These are admissions.

58:01.175 --> 58:02.336
These are admissions.

58:02.916 --> 58:16.986
These are admissions that she was involved in a, some kind of elaborate scheme on the internet to create her daughter as some kind of rabble rousing, you know, highly intelligent, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

58:17.006 --> 58:25.712
I don't know what she was, but then to be promoted by these people on censored.tv and by Alex Jones.

58:27.639 --> 58:32.001
Now, what makes this especially, especially malevolent?

58:32.841 --> 58:38.264
Well, because when Sasha Latupova came out originally, she came out and stepped in front of Catherine Watt.

58:39.124 --> 58:53.731
She came out and stepped in front of Craig Partakoper and took over the story of Catherine Watt and took over the story of Craig Partakoper, the story about bad batches and the story about who we should blame and what laws are important.

58:58.311 --> 59:01.772
And then she toured the world with Robert Malone and Meryl Ness.

59:01.872 --> 59:07.634
She spoke in multiple conferences and has been promoted since.

59:09.175 --> 59:25.781
The woman that is the mother of Soph, that abused little girl that we just watched, performing on the internet as a minor and suggesting that people should shoot Hitler or shoot Trump or shoot Brandon, I guess.

59:28.599 --> 59:28.980
in 2019.

59:31.361 --> 59:32.982
Or maybe that video is even from later.

59:33.022 --> 59:34.903
I don't know when that video is from, to be honest.

59:35.683 --> 59:36.844
And so why do I bring it up?

59:36.904 --> 59:53.313
Because look, they gave me seven minutes and I was supposedly one of the experts that contributed invaluably to the production of his book, the writing of his book, The Wuhan Cover-Up.

59:54.690 --> 01:00:08.275
I got seven minutes on a podcast with four other esteemed experts that would reply to my latest distillation of my theory about what happened in COVID.

01:00:13.517 --> 01:00:18.399
And so how many podcasts do you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:21.440
and CHD did with Sasha?

01:00:24.611 --> 01:00:26.232
in 2023 alone?

01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:33.116
Well, first of all, remember in 2019, her daughter was promoted by Alex Jones.

01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:49.666
And before the start of the pandemic, her daughter was something that I don't know how to see it other than a very, very sad example of a child in America growing up with a very, very malevolent set of parents.

01:00:52.222 --> 01:00:57.205
And now that person got a whole morning show with Merrill Nass.

01:00:57.425 --> 01:00:58.186
Oh, interesting.

01:00:58.566 --> 01:01:10.554
You know, this one, that liar right there that works closely with that liar right there and that liar right there and has been either bamboozling this one or coordinating with him.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:26.553
And here she is now on a fun little podcast with Meryl Nass and Sasha Latupova to talk all about how the DoD is so bad, the DoD did this, the DoD, the DoD.

01:01:27.253 --> 01:01:33.134
And I don't think Catherine Watt, I don't think that's her message.

01:01:33.174 --> 01:01:34.975
I think it's a little more complicated than that.

01:01:35.865 --> 01:01:37.767
but they're showing a picture of the Pentagon there.

01:01:38.107 --> 01:01:42.971
Did you know that she was also considered an American thought leader by Epoch Times?

01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:48.196
You know, the same Epoch Times that did a whole series from Robert Malone's farm?

01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:54.201
Did you know that the Epoch Times considered her an American thought leader in 2023?

01:01:55.562 --> 01:01:58.365
You know, the mom of Soph, an American thought leader.

01:01:58.765 --> 01:02:02.669
So much so that she actually had to be on the Defender podcast twice.

01:02:06.448 --> 01:02:15.733
And in the second Defender podcast, Robert takes a long time to compliment her on being an amazing patriot.

01:02:18.094 --> 01:02:21.796
We're so lucky to have her whistleblowing on this stuff, aren't we?

01:02:27.979 --> 01:02:31.501
You can't see it for any other reason other than it's evil.

01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:32.661
It's evil.

01:02:41.252 --> 01:02:42.952
It's very, very evil.

01:02:44.013 --> 01:02:45.713
So what is Alex Jones really?

01:02:45.733 --> 01:03:09.840
I don't know yet, but I do know that you can start to see these connections on the board, and you can start to see that the way these people have sort of articulated with one another over time, it's impossible not to see it as malevolent, that all of these people are organized against me, that they either ignore me,

01:03:10.757 --> 01:03:12.379
or they attribute bad motives to me.

01:03:12.499 --> 01:03:17.543
None of them will discuss the first few slides of any presentation I ever do.

01:03:19.345 --> 01:03:25.110
And Sasha has been one of the worst, most malevolent liars in this show.

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:33.938
And the reason why you can know that is because of the hundreds of hours of videotaped psychological abuse of her daughter.

01:03:36.448 --> 01:03:37.909
And so who is Alex Jones?

01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:43.193
I think we can learn a lot from these people if we watch them on Alex Jones.

01:03:43.233 --> 01:04:00.945
So I want to watch a couple of these people who've been recently on Alex Jones, not Soph, but some of these liars that I've been focused on for a few years now to see how they open on Alex Jones, to see if we can glean anything from how they open on Alex Jones.

01:04:00.965 --> 01:04:02.846
We're not going to watch the hours and hours.

01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:35.907
let's see we gotta go here and then i think it's oh no it's the other one this one yes so we're gonna start with brett on alex jones i'm very sorry about that what's happening now info wars tells you the truth about what's happening next visit infowars.com forward slash show and support the info

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:45.455
What we want is a system that liberates individuals as meaningfully and as broadly as possible.

01:04:45.835 --> 01:04:47.497
That should be our guide.

01:04:47.557 --> 01:04:48.557
That's classically liberal.

01:04:48.798 --> 01:05:02.628
It is classically liberal, and I believe it is also actually liberal, and it is a perfect match for what I find my many conservative friends believe as well, that this is the metric that we can use to test any system that we put in place.

01:05:02.688 --> 01:05:05.030
So there he's already admitting that he's not conservative.

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.451
His conservative friends.

01:05:06.591 --> 01:05:06.892
You see?

01:05:08.018 --> 01:05:14.428
They are infiltrators, they are liars, they are traitors, and they are collaborating with an obvious traitor.

01:05:17.632 --> 01:05:19.836
Does it liberate people or does it constrain them?

01:05:19.936 --> 01:05:23.862
If it liberates them meaningfully over the long term, it's a good thing.

01:05:25.808 --> 01:05:30.172
What they have recognized is that they have no use for us.

01:05:30.813 --> 01:05:39.220
And I wish that was an exaggeration, but you can see this so clearly in what they did to the public over COVID.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.904
He hopes that they'll have use for him and his children because that's what he's doing right now.

01:05:43.984 --> 01:05:50.590
He's showing allegiance to them in hopes that they won't treat him the same way they're gonna treat all of us.

01:05:51.351 --> 01:05:52.492
This is an announcement.

01:05:53.322 --> 01:05:55.522
And it's a declaration of whose side he's on.

01:05:56.303 --> 01:05:59.203
I don't think we really have any choice but to rescue Western civilization.

01:05:59.463 --> 01:06:01.624
It is the best tool we've got, always has been.

01:06:02.044 --> 01:06:05.184
It's not to say that it can't use upgrading here and there, but.

01:06:05.384 --> 01:06:10.125
So we got to rescue Western civilization and he doesn't have a real good description of what it is.

01:06:10.165 --> 01:06:12.166
It couldn't be, you know.

01:06:18.967 --> 01:06:19.807
It's awful.

01:06:20.461 --> 01:06:28.969
We have to save it because your children, my children, and all of the grandchildren that we might ultimately have are depending on us to do it.

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:32.311
And the idea- He's just stealing our message, right?

01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:45.303
It's not about our grandchildren if he didn't stop young people that haven't had children yet from taking a transfection by teaching them what transfection meant when they could have made a decision.

01:06:45.363 --> 01:06:46.444
You understand that, right?

01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:59.255
There's no way for this, this asshole, this traitor to claim that he was trying to save anyone when he didn't teach anybody what the word transfection meant.

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:06.083
When I begged him to do it, when we still could have saved our college kids from them, transfecting themselves.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:12.115
I don't think we really have any choice but to rescue Western civilization.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.537
It is the best tool we've got, always has been.

01:07:14.557 --> 01:07:27.329
It's not to say that it can't use upgrading here and there, but we have to save it because your children, my children, and all of the grandchildren that we might ultimately have are depending on us to do it.

01:07:28.359 --> 01:07:37.444
And the idea of hyper novelty is that although human beings are the fastest evolving animal species that has ever existed.

01:07:38.265 --> 01:07:41.246
And that is largely the result of the fact that we evolve in a different way.

01:07:41.327 --> 01:07:45.429
We are actually able to evolve culturally, which is much more rapid than genetic evolution.

01:07:45.449 --> 01:07:48.851
But even though we are the fastest evolving animal species.

01:07:49.071 --> 01:07:50.412
I'm sorry, but this is wrong.

01:07:50.892 --> 01:07:54.714
And again, this is him trying to inject his,

01:07:56.215 --> 01:07:59.597
his safe language into this to try and claim expertise.

01:07:59.637 --> 01:08:04.221
So as long as he starts talking about evolution, then he becomes the expert in the room.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.442
And this is part of his shtick.

01:08:06.622 --> 01:08:08.524
It is an absolute enchantment.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.464
Don't buy into it.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:13.927
The idea that we're the fastest evolving thing because we have culture?

01:08:14.388 --> 01:08:14.728
Really?

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:15.669
Really?

01:08:16.629 --> 01:08:17.610
All culture's great?

01:08:18.973 --> 01:08:26.780
We've been teaching the good biology to our kids and that's why we have vaccination schedule in America the way we do.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.620
Do you see it?

01:08:29.642 --> 01:08:32.764
This is the worst kind of traitor.

01:08:33.505 --> 01:08:34.926
The worst kind of traitor.

01:08:34.946 --> 01:08:36.688
He's probably lying to Heather about it.

01:08:37.264 --> 01:08:38.205
that has existed.

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:44.210
The rate of technological change is so fast that even our evolutionary capacity, we can't catch up.

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.211
We cannot keep up.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:53.617
And that is resulting in us being sick physically, psychologically, socially, and what you're detecting.

01:08:53.938 --> 01:08:57.381
So the technology of social media is moving so fast.

01:08:57.441 --> 01:08:59.422
It's making us sick because we can't keep up.

01:08:59.783 --> 01:09:01.384
We can't evolve fast enough.

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:15.674
stop lying as the the collapse of civilization is really a manifestation of many different kinds of hyper novelty that is making it difficult for us to see what's in our interest they are gambling with

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:26.065
a planet that isn't theirs to destroy, that is actually, it is the birthright of every living person and it is the entitlement of all the people who will eventually live here.

01:09:26.106 --> 01:09:29.307
They are gambling with it and they obviously don't know what they're doing.

01:09:29.748 --> 01:09:35.291
It is likely that many of the deaths that occur as a result of these shops

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:40.193
It's the result of the mRNA platform itself.

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:48.717
That anything you loaded onto that platform would produce many of these pathologies, because the platform itself is deeply flawed.

01:09:49.137 --> 01:09:52.339
And that is something that he only learned from me.

01:09:54.246 --> 01:09:56.226
There is no one else he learned it from.

01:09:56.246 --> 01:10:05.188
I am the one and I'm gonna put my flag here right now because in 2020, I was the only one saying it.

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:07.089
I got kicked out of drastic for it.

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:09.549
I got attacked for it.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:12.950
I got offered day trading schemes because of it.

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.890
I got asked to write a review because of it.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:23.972
I got meddled with to no end and including the invitation to join Brett Weinstein in a signal chat.

01:10:25.714 --> 01:10:35.018
And it's all the same show, running out the clock on our young people so that we could not usefully question what was happening until it was too late.

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:51.786
And Brett Weinstein is as guilty as Meryl Nass, and is as guilty as Pierre Cory, and as guilty as Jessica Rose, and as guilty as all of these people who have not played fair, but have coordinated their lying.

01:10:52.386 --> 01:11:00.115
coordinated their opposition to each other and occupied our consciousness and the consciousness of our children with their lies.

01:11:12.349 --> 01:11:16.812
Former professor Brett Weinstein is in studio with us for an in-depth interview.

01:11:17.232 --> 01:11:17.913
We're taping this.

01:11:17.933 --> 01:11:25.697
He was a former professor at an undergraduate college and he taught evolutionary biology and biology, I guess, or something else.

01:11:26.138 --> 01:11:28.659
He's got a single research paper.

01:11:30.681 --> 01:11:36.804
He was not doing research of any meaningful kind when he was

01:11:37.964 --> 01:11:47.267
at Evergreen, and what happened at Evergreen was filmed by tens of different cameras at a time when kids did not have cell phones.

01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:50.728
You understand that, right?

01:11:50.828 --> 01:11:53.689
Like they had studio cameras to film him.

01:11:54.329 --> 01:11:57.270
Studio cameras were filming these faculty meetings.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.611
That's not by accident.

01:11:59.511 --> 01:12:02.052
That was because it was a staged event.

01:12:03.183 --> 01:12:07.864
Did you know that Brett Weinstein was involved in the Occupy Wall Street Movement?

01:12:08.404 --> 01:12:18.386
The same one that brought Tim Pool to fame and brought a lot of the people that he works with, that Krasowski guy or whatever, they all cut their teeth in the Occupy Movement.

01:12:18.486 --> 01:12:23.768
On Sunday, while everybody else is watching the Super Bowl, I'm really excited about this.

01:12:23.828 --> 01:12:26.708
The Occupy Wall Street Movement, you know what I'm talking about?

01:12:27.188 --> 01:12:28.689
Does everybody know what I'm talking about?

01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:30.229
Because that was also staged.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:41.627
and the people that rose to prominence in alternative media during that event also was staged.

01:12:41.687 --> 01:12:44.208
That's why Tim Pool rose out of that.

01:12:45.137 --> 01:12:48.758
You should laugh about not having cell phones by go ahead and look at that video.

01:13:15.635 --> 01:13:17.896
and see how many kids end up filming.

01:13:19.597 --> 01:13:20.818
How many kids are filming?

01:13:21.158 --> 01:13:22.499
How many cameras are present?

01:13:23.459 --> 01:13:32.564
Because you would think that all we would have is cell phone footage of those arguments in the hallway, cell phone footage of some of those faculty meetings, but we don't.

01:13:32.584 --> 01:13:43.610
We have very, very, very high res camera recordings from multiple angles, close up and far away of these faculty meetings.

01:13:44.665 --> 01:13:51.871
of these places where supposedly Brett Weinstein's career crashed to the tune of a half a million dollar settlement.

01:13:54.553 --> 01:13:57.435
Boy, it sure sounds like they kicked him out on his butt, doesn't it?

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:04.400
One day, that's a religion to so many, including my family that's all watching it right now and wondering why I'm not there.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:07.963
Well, it's because this, quite frankly, is way more important.

01:14:07.983 --> 01:14:09.665
A game comes, a game goes.

01:14:10.726 --> 01:14:13.027
But this affects the entire future.

01:14:13.267 --> 01:14:16.128
I'm not saying Occupy was not organic.

01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:20.650
What I'm saying is, is that the people that that actually rose from that.

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.192
They were selected and they were programmed to rise.

01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:31.334
They were allowed to rise for species on this planet that has never been in greater crisis, in my view.

01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:36.516
And when I first learned about the doctor and former professor at Evergreen University in 2017,

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:44.343
He was standing up against really horrible racism against white people, saying they couldn't be on campus on certain days.

01:14:44.884 --> 01:14:49.647
And so I just want to remind folks of where we really started seeing this guy explode out there.

01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:54.031
And since then, he's obviously been everywhere where the top guest on Joe Rogan has his own hit.

01:14:55.152 --> 01:14:57.193
podcasts as well that everybody should search out.

01:14:57.854 --> 01:14:59.715
Luke Rudkowski, that's another one.

01:14:59.755 --> 01:15:01.977
That one also is big time planted.

01:15:02.117 --> 01:15:03.639
That's the Dark Horse podcast.

01:15:03.659 --> 01:15:09.123
We'll put all that on screen for folks, darkhorse.locals.com and also on Rump.

01:15:09.163 --> 01:15:14.828
You can just think of them as an extension of this network of the Intellectual Dark Web and The Clown Show.

01:15:15.849 --> 01:15:22.475
and it's a show that I routinely watch, because I do a lot of research, but I certainly don't know a lot of what's going on in the world.

01:15:22.535 --> 01:15:25.938
It was a famous Greek philosopher said, I know nothing.

01:15:25.958 --> 01:15:30.242
Anybody that tells you that they know everything is either a fool or a liar.

01:15:30.282 --> 01:15:32.084
The more you learn, the more you don't know.

01:15:32.424 --> 01:15:37.549
But I learned a lot from Dr. Brett Weinstein, and it's great to have him here with us.

01:15:37.609 --> 01:15:39.731
Now, I've literally got dozens of topics.

01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:40.731
I want to hit.

01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:44.733
Everybody knows half the time I do an interview, it's me doing half the talking.

01:15:45.113 --> 01:15:51.175
I really want to give you, doctor, a chance to start wherever you want to cover them.

01:15:51.615 --> 01:15:54.016
If Luke is from Canada, it wouldn't surprise me at all.

01:15:54.456 --> 01:15:59.698
Here is Brett Weinstein going to tell you a little bit about his past.

01:15:59.858 --> 01:16:05.060
Borders, you were just out at the Darien Gap with investigative journalist and war correspondent Michael Yon.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.941
You just did an amazing podcast.

01:16:07.791 --> 01:16:19.860
Which I just realized while I was looking for videos to archive of Kevin McCairn, because I don't watch his videos, but I archived them on a separate hard drive because I think they're history.

01:16:19.981 --> 01:16:28.107
I think they're evidence of this malevolent little scheme to put a bunch of dipshits on the internet to make us so confused that we would believe a pandemic happened.

01:16:28.147 --> 01:16:29.368
Maybe it was a bioweapon.

01:16:29.848 --> 01:16:33.571
So this guy that they're talking about with the code name Big Honey,

01:16:36.132 --> 01:16:44.836
Supposedly, a month or so ago, after they were at this Dairy and Gap little trip with Chris Martinson and Brett Weinstein.

01:16:44.876 --> 01:16:49.058
Remember, Chris Martinson was also in the Signal chat that I was in in 2021.

01:16:49.599 --> 01:16:52.820
And he also knows that it's a transfection and transformation.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.681
We should have told people that.

01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:58.203
So he's just as guilty as Brett Weinstein.

01:16:58.223 --> 01:16:59.763
He just doesn't have as many followers.

01:17:01.365 --> 01:17:08.815
And so that guy took Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson down to the Darien Gap to show them how we're being invaded by Chinese.

01:17:09.897 --> 01:17:16.867
And that big honey guy supposedly had some connection with Kevin McCarran because they were going to meet up in Japan.

01:17:18.206 --> 01:17:30.401
Now, I didn't see a live stream that came after it, a recording of an interview that came after it, but Kevin definitely said he was going to meet Big Honey in Japan, which is really interesting.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:35.167
Maybe they went to the same pool as Rixey was swimming at when he was there.

01:17:35.347 --> 01:17:36.168
I would talk to Carlson.

01:17:36.188 --> 01:17:37.069
I watched the whole thing.

01:17:37.349 --> 01:17:38.030
Yes, Michael.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.490
Yeah.

01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.552
And then watch the clips again.

01:17:39.592 --> 01:17:40.673
We played him on the show.

01:17:41.053 --> 01:17:42.775
You really nailed what's happening.

01:17:43.436 --> 01:17:45.338
And we were just talking before we started taping.

01:17:45.378 --> 01:17:45.938
You should listen.

01:17:46.419 --> 01:17:47.941
We have to save Western civilization.

01:17:47.981 --> 01:17:48.681
We're in a crisis.

01:17:48.701 --> 01:17:51.885
We've got to transcend these labels of left and right.

01:17:52.085 --> 01:18:11.351
I don't really understand how Rick sees in Japan because when he came to my house he brought a woman and a little baby with him like a little toddler so is he just going and hanging out in Japan and and and being with his best buddy because he's that cool or or exactly what is exactly happening there you should question that a lot

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:17.415
And again, remember, Charles Rixey came to my house here in Pittsburgh and stayed overnight.

01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:27.247
That's how he got me to stream about the diffuse proposal and briefly convinced me that him and I were at least the American wing of drastic and that I should trust him.

01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:29.530
Yes, that happened.

01:18:30.509 --> 01:18:39.055
And then a couple months later, Bobby Kennedy hired me because he said that Robert Malone sat him down and made him watch my stream.

01:18:39.695 --> 01:18:40.936
So you see how that all connects?

01:18:41.496 --> 01:18:45.839
Bobby told me that Robert Malone made him watch my stream with Charles Rixey on it.

01:18:45.879 --> 01:18:48.100
And then Charles Rixey and I got hired by Bobby.

01:18:48.701 --> 01:18:50.942
And so it seems like they're finally hearing me.

01:18:50.982 --> 01:18:53.464
They're finally listening to me, but that's not what's happening.

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:55.609
That wasn't what was happening at all.

01:18:55.669 --> 01:19:16.194
That was this network trying to absorb me to get me to adopt their message or adopt their pace of the titration of the truth so that I wouldn't disturb the narrative of the national security operation that both Brett and his brother and Alex and Jessica Rose and Robert Malone are all involved in.

01:19:17.443 --> 01:19:18.424
I totally agree with you.

01:19:18.444 --> 01:19:20.586
So we're going to cover the waterfront here today.

01:19:20.606 --> 01:19:24.349
And I really appreciate you taking the time to make yourself available.

01:19:24.789 --> 01:19:26.371
So let's, let's start.

01:19:27.231 --> 01:19:27.912
Well, thanks.

01:19:27.952 --> 01:19:30.674
I'm really glad to be here and to meet you finally.

01:19:30.694 --> 01:19:34.858
Uh, I've long been a fan of yours, if a bit cryptically.

01:19:34.878 --> 01:19:38.101
Um, and in fact, maybe that is a place to start.

01:19:39.222 --> 01:19:42.605
Um, many years ago, I guess it would have been something like 2011,

01:19:44.970 --> 01:19:58.634
I was part of the Occupy Movement, and although the Occupy Movement got ridiculous quickly, and I wish I had realized where it was headed earlier, I was paying attention actually to your coverage of it.

01:19:58.714 --> 01:20:07.837
And something that impressed and surprised me was that as the Occupy Movement was being targeted by the federal government,

01:20:08.477 --> 01:20:12.861
You covered that targeting and you were incensed by it.

01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:28.875
And I was heartened to see you defending people who obviously ideologically... So we're supposed to believe that Bret Weinstein, since 2011, has believed Alex Jones despite his conspiracy theory status.

01:20:30.357 --> 01:20:35.121
Despite his Sandy Hook status, whatever that is.

01:20:36.735 --> 01:20:46.506
And so he's praising him, praising Alex Jones for having seen what the Wall Street thing was.

01:20:47.808 --> 01:20:54.736
So can you see now that actually during the Occupy Wall Street, Alex Jones and Brett Weinstein were already working against us.

01:20:55.777 --> 01:20:57.019
They were already a network.

01:20:58.174 --> 01:21:00.177
doesn't mean that they had to acknowledge each other.

01:21:00.217 --> 01:21:12.533
They were already sitting at that same table where the weaponized piles of money convinced people to get on the internet and ask questions that reinforced the presuppositions of the state.

01:21:13.257 --> 01:21:14.338
That's Brett's job.

01:21:14.878 --> 01:21:17.220
That's Brett and Brett's job for a long time.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:30.851
And that transition, that history with Occupy Wall Street and then something happening at Evergreen, this is all orchestrated theater designed to put Brett in exactly the place that he is right now.

01:21:32.048 --> 01:21:34.349
designed to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:59.303
in exactly the place that he is right now, designed to put Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak and Ralph Baric in exactly the places they are right now, to put Bobby Kennedy and Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass in exactly the place they are right now, where they can titrate the truth and make sure that nobody questions the faith in the novel virus that killed millions of people in 2020 and 2021.

01:22:01.677 --> 01:22:15.760
We're not closely aligned with you, and I felt at the time, and I feel even more strongly now, that you're a patriot, and I really appreciate that you see all Americans as worth defending.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:17.260
Stop lying!

01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:21.661
Thank you, but look, if I don't defend everybody, I'm not going to get defended.

01:22:21.681 --> 01:22:24.922
It was that famous quote by the pastor in Nazi Germany.

01:22:25.162 --> 01:22:27.843
We don't need Alex Jones to defend us, you see?

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:30.164
We don't need Alex Jones.

01:22:30.204 --> 01:22:31.906
We don't want Alex Jones to defend us.

01:22:31.966 --> 01:22:35.049
We need to go to our school board meetings and our town hall meetings.

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:38.132
We need to be there for our kids.

01:22:38.892 --> 01:22:42.796
We need to pull our kids out of university if it doesn't suit our family.

01:22:45.538 --> 01:22:53.486
Not share Alex Jones or buy his supplements and not share Bret Weinstein or buy his book.

01:22:55.865 --> 01:22:57.206
That's the illusion here.

01:22:57.726 --> 01:22:58.867
He's not a patriot.

01:22:59.187 --> 01:23:08.573
He works for this national security state that would enslave our children so that they can take their medical data before they run the population down.

01:23:09.594 --> 01:23:12.376
He didn't stand up for this group when they came after him, then he'd stand up for that group.

01:23:12.436 --> 01:23:15.058
And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody left to stand up for him.

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:20.480
I exactly agree with this, and I think that really is the team that needs to assemble.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.202
All of the patriots who respect the principles on which the U.S.

01:23:24.262 --> 01:23:24.942
was founded.

01:23:25.142 --> 01:23:27.544
So they want you to think that they are the team.

01:23:27.604 --> 01:23:30.825
We should assemble around Brett and Alex.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.946
That's the team we need to assemble around.

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:33.387
Why?

01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:42.732
Why can't we assemble a team around teachers like me or lawyers that actually know what they're doing?

01:23:44.355 --> 01:23:48.080
not lawyers that don't work for a law firm and therefore can't do anything for real.

01:23:51.513 --> 01:23:58.017
people that will say strict liability out loud as a combination of words meant to be an idea.

01:23:58.357 --> 01:24:06.182
Western civilization is founded need to put aside ideological differences so that we can fend off what threatens Western civilization.

01:24:06.722 --> 01:24:12.045
And at the point that we've succeeded in doing that, we can go back to fighting over ideological issues.

01:24:12.165 --> 01:24:14.147
But for the moment, they're beside the point.

01:24:14.887 --> 01:24:34.165
Now, I didn't really go into your bio, and most people know who you are, and they know a lot about you, but maybe we should just real quick talk about your background, what you've done, your best-selling book, The Hunter-Gatherer's Guide, The 21st Century, and then kind of your political... Crazy when that came out, just in time for everybody to be locked down and need something to read.

01:24:37.165 --> 01:24:38.906
He said he was going to send me one, but he never did.

01:24:38.926 --> 01:24:40.826
Process and what you would call yourself today.

01:24:40.846 --> 01:24:45.207
And then let's talk about that big attack on Western civilization and then launch into wherever you want to go.

01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:46.808
Sure.

01:24:47.448 --> 01:24:49.509
You want me to tell people my background?

01:24:49.889 --> 01:24:50.769
Just about yourself, yeah.

01:24:50.789 --> 01:24:50.989
Sure.

01:24:51.689 --> 01:24:53.970
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:57.451
I studied bats as part of my dissertation.

01:24:57.771 --> 01:24:58.311
He studied bats.

01:24:58.331 --> 01:25:01.973
But that work led me quickly to the study of biological trade-offs.

01:25:02.433 --> 01:25:06.574
That is to say, oftentimes anybody who's managed a system

01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:12.058
Be careful, don't get bamboozled by the idea that he studied anything beyond reading, which is fine.

01:25:12.158 --> 01:25:24.588
I read now and reading is good, but when he says study, it's not like he's, you know, getting grants and teaching students and supervising PhD students, all of which I've done.

01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:36.378
I've played the Academy Magician game and done it with some varying degree of success, but one of the things I've definitely done is supervise students to fruition.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:44.543
And so he's not one of these kinds of, he kind of worked at a very expensive community college when you think about it.

01:25:45.123 --> 01:25:46.804
Knows that you can't have everything.

01:25:46.844 --> 01:25:49.905
You have to borrow from one thing in order to accomplish something else.

01:25:50.365 --> 01:25:52.946
And it turns out that that's the way biology functions too.

01:25:53.526 --> 01:26:03.991
So anyway, that became my focus and it has an important implication to this day in terms of how I see civilization and other complex systems functioning.

01:26:05.363 --> 01:26:09.566
Complex systems is something that he says a lot as a kind of enchantment.

01:26:09.606 --> 01:26:21.312
It's a very low-level enchantment, but the idea is for him to say that, and then for most of the people that are listening to say, well, I definitely don't understand complex systems like this guy does, so I'm just going to defer to him.

01:26:21.892 --> 01:26:28.516
Taught for 14 years at the Evergreen State College, which was a very strange place.

01:26:28.856 --> 01:26:33.219
It was the most liberal college in the country, I believe, by almost any measure.

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:39.314
And there was a lot to it that was crazy, but there was also a lot to it that was quite brilliant.

01:26:40.054 --> 01:26:47.698
The founders of the college had thrown out every single structure that would exist in or profess at a time, full-time professor.

01:26:47.738 --> 01:26:56.701
Each right to each individual with 23rd of 2017 by 50 students that I had never met accusing me of racism.

01:26:57.282 --> 01:26:58.382
I wasn't concerned.

01:26:58.462 --> 01:27:00.002
Look at all those cell phones, man.

01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:01.623
Everybody's making a recording, right?

01:27:01.663 --> 01:27:04.863
There are just all really, all those cell phones, look at them all.

01:27:05.564 --> 01:27:10.705
There were too many people who knew that that accusation had no reality to it.

01:27:11.585 --> 01:27:13.325
And so I knew it wasn't going to stick.

01:27:13.525 --> 01:27:15.286
So that allowed me to stand up to it.

01:27:15.306 --> 01:27:21.487
I found out that on Kevin McCarron's LinkedIn that he got his PhD from an online university.

01:27:21.547 --> 01:27:22.628
Is that even possible?

01:27:23.568 --> 01:27:24.268
Is that real?

01:27:25.387 --> 01:27:30.089
Did we miss that for four years that Kevin McCairn is an online PhD?

01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:31.290
It's hard for me to imagine.

01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:38.773
And the protesters who came after me made the mistake of proudly filming everything they did.

01:27:39.093 --> 01:27:47.577
And when they released that footage to the internet, people looked at me being confronted by students who weren't willing to even have a conversation.

01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:52.039
So we're talking about experimenting with how to make people go viral.

01:27:53.322 --> 01:27:55.846
We're experimenting with what Alex Karp said.

01:27:55.886 --> 01:27:56.928
How do we know things?

01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:01.957
How do we participate in our democracy or can we participate in our democracy?

01:28:02.538 --> 01:28:05.704
And those questions belie their true motives.

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:17.373
The question is, can we put enough bullshit on the internet and on people's cell phones so that they cannot usefully govern themselves?

01:28:17.933 --> 01:28:24.299
Can we put enough bullshit on people's cell phones so that they cannot usefully know something?

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.762
Those are the real questions that Alex Karp was interested in.

01:28:29.182 --> 01:28:32.083
Those are the real questions that Palantir is interested in.

01:28:32.563 --> 01:28:40.127
Can we control information to the point where people cannot ask useful questions and therefore cannot govern themselves?

01:28:41.027 --> 01:28:53.753
And people like Brett Weinstein are participating in this malevolent removal of our ability to govern ourselves, of our kids' ability to govern themselves, by actually teaching our kids this mythology.

01:28:56.411 --> 01:28:57.471
That's what's happening here.

01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:05.873
That's how malevolent it is, how traitorous these people are, to their own countries or to ours, depending on where they are from.

01:29:05.893 --> 01:29:12.315
I mean, and they knew something was wrong in this diversity.

01:29:12.355 --> 01:29:18.616
I think McCoon graduated from the Open University on the internet, but you got to look at his LinkedIn, because I think it's on his LinkedIn.

01:29:18.736 --> 01:29:20.016
Yes, but he had an inclusion movement.

01:29:20.256 --> 01:29:23.377
Just to interrupt, it felt like a malice struggle section.

01:29:24.696 --> 01:29:30.421
I think it was in every way, except that the students who were confronting me, I don't think knew very much about Mao.

01:29:30.501 --> 01:29:31.842
But in every other way, yes.

01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:33.964
Keep going, sorry.

01:29:34.184 --> 01:29:37.967
So anyway, I was teaching evolutionary biology.

01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:40.249
The mind in his own business.

01:29:40.289 --> 01:29:42.231
Had hired a new president.

01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:45.634
You want to speak on.

01:29:45.694 --> 01:29:47.095
This is not about you.

01:29:47.295 --> 01:29:47.915
I'm talking.

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:49.677
Those are the top.

01:29:49.897 --> 01:29:51.198
Do I think they're targeted anywhere?

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:53.982
See that phone right there?

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:55.863
That's not a very good recording phone.

01:29:56.203 --> 01:30:03.468
I don't think I'm being silly when I say that in 2017, we didn't all have fat iPhones with 4K cameras on them.

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:06.790
That one's filming.

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.112
I get that she's filming, but not everybody's filming like it would be now.

01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:16.150
There's a couple filming.

01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:16.330
See, that.

01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:20.812
This is Brett Weinstein pretending to speak out against something while he shows it to you.

01:30:20.852 --> 01:30:22.532
He's pretending that this isn't spontaneous.

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:39.448
but it's pretty highly produced.

01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:43.773
We don't have any problems showing you how the illusion of consensus is created.

01:30:44.194 --> 01:30:49.941
These are the same videos that they use on Sky News and we can keep going, right?

01:30:49.981 --> 01:30:56.729
He's going to show, you're going to do some nitric boost and then he's going to show a video of, of, uh,

01:30:59.392 --> 01:31:00.693
of Yuri Gavali, right?

01:31:00.713 --> 01:31:04.014
He's gonna go through all these things, scare you with all these things.

01:31:04.054 --> 01:31:05.935
Here he goes, more t-shirts to sell.

01:31:06.636 --> 01:31:11.718
Then we're gonna go to, I know that there's a Yuri, there he goes.

01:31:11.938 --> 01:31:13.259
See, now we're gonna show this guy.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.420
All these bad, that guy.

01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:23.984
We're gonna give him 15 minutes of our time, let him say things, and then Brett's gonna speak against him again.

01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:29.125
They're using the same clips.

01:31:29.185 --> 01:31:31.586
They're using the same sound bites.

01:31:31.627 --> 01:31:33.127
They're using the same samples.

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:35.889
They're just DJing them a little bit differently.

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:39.291
This is no different than Sky News Australia.

01:31:39.351 --> 01:31:45.274
It's just our own version of the Lollapalooza and Brett Weinstein is intimately involved in it.

01:31:45.895 --> 01:31:46.875
Just like Joe Rogan.

01:31:46.995 --> 01:31:52.559
He might be unwitting, but he's unwitting in the way that people look away from things in the military.

01:31:52.639 --> 01:31:54.380
I don't need to know what's behind that curtain.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:54.920
Don't tell me.

01:31:56.328 --> 01:31:58.069
That's how unwitting Joe Rogan is.

01:31:58.629 --> 01:32:04.011
I'll gladly take $100 million and interview anybody that you send to my house.

01:32:04.832 --> 01:32:05.132
Okay.

01:32:09.974 --> 01:32:13.256
Let's go to the next video because I've had enough of Brett.

01:32:15.617 --> 01:32:17.397
Malone on Alex Jones.

01:32:19.198 --> 01:32:25.041
While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:30.734
Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.

01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:37.773
I'm just gonna click through.

01:32:37.833 --> 01:32:40.195
Fight the who, fight the who.

01:32:40.215 --> 01:32:41.757
Reject the amendments of the who.

01:33:01.096 --> 01:33:06.358
Doing a lot of news programming, a lot of news programming, programming, programming.

01:33:06.418 --> 01:33:08.359
Ooh, look at that.

01:33:08.999 --> 01:33:10.040
That's from my show.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.640
I used to dab that as a lead in.

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:12.461
So where is Malone?

01:33:12.561 --> 01:33:13.181
Think about this.

01:33:13.201 --> 01:33:15.442
Think about how much I'm fast-forwarding through.

01:33:25.646 --> 01:33:45.385
nitric boost i've been plugging nitric boost here we go selling stuff maybe we gotta do this is the adult version of soph that's all he is the adult version of soph and soph is the little kid version of alex jones

01:33:46.658 --> 01:33:53.143
And Sasha Latupova, as a parent and a mom, is responsible for the little kid version of Alex Jones.

01:33:53.243 --> 01:34:08.696
It's malevolent, it's child abuse, and it's gross that Bobby Kennedy, wittingly or unwittingly, has promoted her mom as some kind of patriot when she's clearly involved in the same network that these liars have been in for years.

01:34:10.137 --> 01:34:12.499
And she used her daughter to participate in it.

01:34:13.894 --> 01:34:15.675
It's just, it's, it's gross.

01:34:16.115 --> 01:34:17.496
I respond to a lot of them.

01:34:17.516 --> 01:34:18.156
I'm addicted to it.

01:34:18.196 --> 01:34:19.496
I developed 40% on a support and stuff.

01:34:19.516 --> 01:34:19.937
It's the Apple.

01:34:19.957 --> 01:34:22.478
I can buy some more stuff.

01:34:22.498 --> 01:34:24.919
I've started up like a B, James Corbett, James Corbett.

01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:41.130
Blackrock.

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:42.631
Oh, Fish Oil.

01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:45.091
Who's that guy?

01:34:45.132 --> 01:34:46.432
Another one of the dudes?

01:34:46.712 --> 01:34:47.932
Another one of the dudes?

01:34:48.252 --> 01:34:51.293
Another one of the intellectual dark web kind of orbit?

01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:54.314
We're into an hour now.

01:34:57.295 --> 01:34:58.236
More Blackrock.

01:34:58.436 --> 01:35:01.396
Just making announcements for them.

01:35:01.477 --> 01:35:02.157
Nothing more.

01:35:02.677 --> 01:35:05.178
Not giving you a useful way out.

01:35:05.898 --> 01:35:07.518
Just announcing for them.

01:35:10.051 --> 01:35:10.551
Where are we?

01:35:10.591 --> 01:35:11.792
Where's, where's Robert?

01:35:14.313 --> 01:35:14.733
Is that you?

01:35:15.714 --> 01:35:16.934
Oh, hey there.

01:35:17.074 --> 01:35:18.635
I just, I just, there we go.

01:35:18.835 --> 01:35:19.495
More of him.

01:35:19.515 --> 01:35:28.960
Wow.

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:29.560
It's crazy.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.361
Look, selling more stuff where there is alone.

01:35:32.621 --> 01:35:35.703
It just gets worse by the minute and then all the anecdotal evidence.

01:35:35.723 --> 01:35:37.243
So I'm kind of ranting here.

01:35:37.324 --> 01:35:38.264
Robert W Malone.

01:35:38.824 --> 01:35:50.068
MDMS, one of the pioneers, the most sourced, main pioneer into mRNA, been warning about it long before they even rolled out COVID because some of the problems with it, obviously.

01:35:50.789 --> 01:35:54.430
It's great to have you, Dr. Malone, and we really appreciate you coming on today.

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:57.340
Well, thanks, Alex.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:03.922
And I just want to acknowledge your leadership and your ability to see around corners.

01:36:04.622 --> 01:36:16.964
Again and again and again, you have been labeled as a conspiracy theorist and a nutcase for speaking the truth that you were able to perceive earlier than many.

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:20.565
So there's the Venetian lion behind him, I guess, according to Matt.

01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:36.243
Eret, it might be the Venetian lion, the same lion that Bobby Kennedy asks about, asks Sasha about in their second Defender interview, where he says, your lighting is not so good anymore.

01:36:36.623 --> 01:36:40.487
The last time I saw you, you had this beautiful painting of lions behind you.

01:36:40.887 --> 01:36:42.949
And I guess you're a very skilled painter, huh?

01:36:42.969 --> 01:36:43.790
That's really great.

01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:48.653
The one that Robert Malone says is a real bad girl.

01:36:48.713 --> 01:36:49.414
She's naughty.

01:36:49.514 --> 01:36:50.554
She's really mean.

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:51.815
You know, this one.

01:36:52.476 --> 01:36:54.157
Where is the Kersh McKernan?

01:36:55.058 --> 01:36:58.140
And where is that one now?

01:36:59.020 --> 01:36:59.261
Hmm.

01:37:00.267 --> 01:37:01.767
I wanna put that up here really quick.

01:37:02.248 --> 01:37:04.928
So he says that Alex Jones can see around corners.

01:37:04.968 --> 01:37:06.249
I wonder who else has been on.

01:37:06.269 --> 01:37:10.930
So Alex, you know, COVID is a respiratory infection, arguably, right?

01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:11.550
It's supposed to be.

01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:14.551
Well, there's very little in the Pfizer documents on lungs.

01:37:14.651 --> 01:37:19.553
It's all about- Interesting, so she's been on too, that's cool.

01:37:19.713 --> 01:37:20.393
So let's see.

01:37:21.053 --> 01:37:25.435
So Robert Malone says that Sasha's a real bad person.

01:37:25.535 --> 01:37:28.816
She's like hard to handle or something, I don't know.

01:37:30.754 --> 01:37:35.978
So, you know, the reason why I lecture on Willis that I usually... Thank you for coming on, sir.

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.361
This isn't too long ago, Mr. Sanchez.

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:46.946
I did catch your comments regarding such a lot of POVA right before the segment went live.

01:37:47.106 --> 01:37:48.267
I really don't appreciate that.

01:37:48.347 --> 01:37:48.627
Thanks.

01:37:50.429 --> 01:37:51.009
OK, yeah.

01:37:51.029 --> 01:37:51.649
Sorry about that.

01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:58.715
I, you know, if you're going to cite things that you've asserted that I've said,

01:37:59.684 --> 01:38:03.545
Please cite where you got that information and provide context.

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:04.545
Sure.

01:38:04.605 --> 01:38:08.186
I was citing the comment from her letter, her open letter.

01:38:08.206 --> 01:38:09.386
Yeah.

01:38:09.746 --> 01:38:15.347
And the video that she has been extremely rude to me, attacked me multiple times.

01:38:16.527 --> 01:38:18.107
Did she call you a pedophile?

01:38:18.187 --> 01:38:18.447
No.

01:38:18.507 --> 01:38:22.048
The language she's used is way, way over the top.

01:38:22.468 --> 01:38:22.908
I wonder.

01:38:23.528 --> 01:38:26.189
So way, way over the top context.

01:38:27.279 --> 01:38:42.390
And so the the lady who who whose daughter was featured on Alex Jones, who who was has a live shooting video where she says this is for you, Trump, while she's shooting a pistol.

01:38:46.219 --> 01:39:00.611
And her mom is promoted by Robert and they went on, they were so close that he trusted her so much that he took her to Scotland, sorry, to Sweden to be in a Stockholm presentation.

01:39:00.651 --> 01:39:07.257
And she was on stage with him and Meryl Nass together, like asking questions on a panel.

01:39:08.806 --> 01:39:12.731
And now he's trying to pretend that Sasha Latapova has been very rude.

01:39:13.252 --> 01:39:17.317
I guess rude like she is in all the comments and all the tweets she's ever done to me.

01:39:18.679 --> 01:39:21.903
And all the tweets and all the comments she's ever made about Mark or Vilma.

01:39:24.446 --> 01:39:27.650
Ladies and gentlemen, it is one big show.

01:39:30.273 --> 01:39:35.918
and they are all pretending to argue with each other, oppose each other, agree with each other.

01:39:36.418 --> 01:39:40.482
Believe it or not, on this podcast that I showed you earlier,

01:39:48.621 --> 01:40:01.852
On this podcast that I showed you earlier, remember she was on Alex Jones in 2019, then her mom gets promoted by CHD and Meryl Nass, who I know is a meddler from way back, has been working with Robert Malone for a decade or so.

01:40:02.312 --> 01:40:06.616
She gets featured on Epoch Times that also has done a whole series on Robert Malone.

01:40:07.236 --> 01:40:11.240
And she gets two different interviews on the Defender in 2023 with Bobby by herself.

01:40:16.181 --> 01:40:25.249
And she is lauded as a patriot and a whistleblower and a retired pharma exec, risking her future, whatever, I guess.

01:40:27.991 --> 01:40:31.514
And in that video right there, in that video right there, look, look at them.

01:40:34.196 --> 01:40:35.558
That guy's running for president.

01:40:37.379 --> 01:40:40.101
You're telling me that he doesn't know about Soph?

01:40:41.282 --> 01:40:46.506
that his team didn't look up who Sasha was to find out that, oh, her daughter is interesting.

01:40:48.107 --> 01:41:05.741
That Robert Malone just happened to run into her a couple years later after she stepped in front of Craig Pardecoper and Catherine Watt in 2022, came on my podcast in 2022 to tell me about the bad batches, but never said that placebos would be a great way to do it, even though she's a pharma exec.

01:41:09.133 --> 01:41:16.682
There are videos of her young child daughter swearing, talking sexual.

01:41:17.142 --> 01:41:18.724
It's written on her arm.

01:41:18.804 --> 01:41:28.575
It says, it says, it says C-U-N-T on her arm in that video, scribbled in ink.

01:41:32.796 --> 01:41:38.537
This is a malevolent network of liars that is part of the controlled demolition of America.

01:41:38.597 --> 01:41:42.658
The network extends all the way into Five Eyes alternative news.

01:41:43.158 --> 01:41:51.000
It extends all the way to Five Eyes alternative resistance organizations like Heart and probably Panda.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:57.601
It extends to resistance organizations that have been infiltrated like ICANN and CHD.

01:42:00.768 --> 01:42:17.730
And that's why Sasha Latupova was promoted multiple times by these people, including Epoch Times, as an American thought leader, former pharmaceutical executive, who basically got gifted something by the Democratic Party.

01:42:18.786 --> 01:42:22.547
When she moved here, married her husband, I don't know what took some, I don't know.

01:42:22.567 --> 01:42:23.967
It's just, it's disturbing.

01:42:24.007 --> 01:42:31.330
These are not people who were lifted up by their bootstraps, but were gifted multiple gifts by the deep state.

01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:36.171
So many gifts that they said, yeah, you can have our daughter.

01:42:36.891 --> 01:42:37.131
Sure.

01:42:37.191 --> 01:42:37.611
Why not?

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:45.033
If you're trying to figure out how influencers are created, you're trying to figure out how, how internet phenomenon are created.

01:42:45.093 --> 01:42:46.854
We'd be happy to loan you our daughter.

01:42:53.191 --> 01:42:54.031
That's what this was.

01:42:55.412 --> 01:42:58.373
And that's why we need to ask the question, who is Alex Jones?

01:42:58.433 --> 01:43:01.854
Not who, we need to ask the question, what does he represent?

01:43:01.914 --> 01:43:05.315
Just like we need to ask the question, what does Soph represent?

01:43:05.795 --> 01:43:19.559
What does Soph and her mom and Alex Jones and the appearance of Peter McCullough and Brent Weinstein and Naomi Wolf and Robert Malone all on Alex Jones.

01:43:19.639 --> 01:43:20.920
And now there's a whole,

01:43:22.116 --> 01:43:23.497
interview with David Martin.

01:43:26.139 --> 01:43:29.341
And they all agree that Alex Jones sure is ahead of the curve.

01:43:34.404 --> 01:43:35.605
Just like Soph.

01:43:38.271 --> 01:43:45.479
They use the things that they learned by running people like Soph and Laura Loomer and all those other people on censored.tv.

01:43:45.499 --> 01:43:51.125
They learned stuff from those canceled channels, those media exercises.

01:43:51.245 --> 01:43:57.792
And then they applied the lessons that they learned to the promotion of Kevin McKernan at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:43:57.832 --> 01:43:58.813
They weaponized it.

01:44:00.219 --> 01:44:12.441
That's why it's not just these people, but it is also these people that were weaponized against us, put in front of us, elevated on social media, just like Soph, just like Alex Jones.

01:44:12.821 --> 01:44:14.402
But these are good ones.

01:44:16.422 --> 01:44:23.323
They're part of the same, same network that the Tommy podcast is a part of.

01:44:24.444 --> 01:44:26.284
Tommy is just another Soph.

01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:31.112
That's why he's laying under a blanket in a recliner most of the time.

01:44:31.152 --> 01:44:40.920
He's just another SOF, an artificially promoted denizen of the internet that has been used to control the limited spectrum of debate.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.864
That's why these people were all on stage together in Romania, and it includes Steven Hatfill.

01:44:49.206 --> 01:44:53.529
You know, the guy with the bubble suit in Africa in the early 2000s, that guy.

01:44:55.796 --> 01:45:02.121
The guy that the Outback, or sorry, Outbreak movie is written after.

01:45:04.864 --> 01:45:07.867
Ladies and gentlemen, it's not looking good.

01:45:07.927 --> 01:45:09.688
It's not looking good for these people.

01:45:09.929 --> 01:45:19.698
It's not looking good for these people that have bamboozled our children with the argument about the origins of the virus, that they agreed that the argument about the origins was important.

01:45:20.158 --> 01:45:25.963
They agreed so much that they created this illusion of consensus in cooperation with DAISAC.

01:45:26.704 --> 01:45:38.030
and Ebright and all of these people that were in front of the mainstream media just as much as these people that weren't in front of the mainstream media and they all agree on social media now.

01:45:38.911 --> 01:45:42.173
They all agree it's the worst case scenario because it's likely a lab leak.

01:45:42.193 --> 01:45:43.433
They probably released it.

01:45:43.593 --> 01:45:46.475
Oh my gosh, are they trying to kill us or when are they going to start?

01:45:47.349 --> 01:45:56.153
They all agree on this worst case scenario and the way that they're getting away with it is agreeing not to talk about 2020 and just say the shots are bad.

01:45:56.213 --> 01:46:00.495
Like what Brett Weinstein just said, that the shots are killing people.

01:46:00.995 --> 01:46:13.301
Nevermind that they were willing to murder people to convince people to take those shots and that they used Brett Weinstein in order to lie about that murder, to obfuscate that murder long enough so that the clock would run out.

01:46:17.472 --> 01:46:21.534
Clock would run out on this narrative and we would be stuck in the car with them anyway.

01:46:21.634 --> 01:46:23.215
Please, can you stop the car?

01:46:23.235 --> 01:46:23.936
I want to get out.

01:46:24.036 --> 01:46:24.696
No, no, no, no, no.

01:46:24.736 --> 01:46:25.236
We're almost there.

01:46:25.256 --> 01:46:25.877
We're almost there.

01:46:27.057 --> 01:46:27.758
We're almost there.

01:46:30.046 --> 01:46:41.238
That's why Bret Weinstein has never talked about Sina Bavari or David Hohn or the Sina Bavari paper that's in Bobby's book, even though he's listed as one of the experts that contributed to the book.

01:46:41.879 --> 01:46:47.325
He's never covered any of that book, any of the biology in that book, any of the statements in that book.

01:46:48.971 --> 01:47:09.666
never talked about Stanley Plotkin, doesn't know who Hilary Kaprowski is, never talked about the Barr family or the promise system and the theft of medical information a decade ago, and has never talked about Joshua Lederberg and how he has been one of the instrumental forces behind the crafting of these ideas so that we would accept genetic engineering as gene therapy.

01:47:11.588 --> 01:47:18.373
They will not talk about how GigaOM Biological has refuted these ideas with very succinct statements.

01:47:19.209 --> 01:47:25.773
won't talk about them, they just continue to focus because, again, it's a spectacular commitment to lies.

01:47:25.813 --> 01:47:31.136
That's all that is required is a spectacular commitment to lies, and that makes the faith real.

01:47:31.476 --> 01:47:31.857
That's it.

01:47:32.517 --> 01:47:33.478
There's no more magic.

01:47:33.878 --> 01:47:43.824
As long as they keep talking to each other, as long as these people keep swimming in the same hot tubs or taking the same pictures of their shoes together, we will never escape.

01:47:45.575 --> 01:47:48.276
That's why Robert Malone is front and center even now.

01:47:48.356 --> 01:48:08.084
Robert Malone, who studied retroviruses with Robert Gallo and Murray Gardner and David Baltimore, who was interested in packaging sequences when he was a grad student, who got PTSD from that experience because he was so ethically superior, who then went on, despite all of these setbacks,

01:48:08.644 --> 01:48:15.569
who worked for DITRA and DOD and the WHO and NIH study sections to the tune of $50 billion of grants awarded.

01:48:16.029 --> 01:48:27.217
He won't talk about Judy Mikovits because she comes from the same mentor chain and he worked with Gert at Solvay, Gert-funded Bosch, and they also did a COVID movie in 2021 that nobody seems to watch anymore.

01:48:27.558 --> 01:48:34.563
He's the most interesting man in the world, according to the commercial that was made by Mickey Willis.

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:53.147
It's all the same illusion about a bad K virus, an illusion of consensus that they created, an illusion of consensus that these people created in concert with these people.

01:48:53.247 --> 01:48:55.548
They created this illusion of consensus.

01:48:55.588 --> 01:48:56.168
They created it.

01:48:59.403 --> 01:49:05.585
And once you see this, all social media is still worst case scenario, you can see it.

01:49:06.225 --> 01:49:07.685
You can see that they're still doing it.

01:49:07.765 --> 01:49:10.486
It's just an orchestrated Lollapalooza of liars.

01:49:11.186 --> 01:49:13.387
And the way they do it is not talking about this stuff.

01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:14.887
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:49:14.927 --> 01:49:15.728
That's it, it's done.

01:49:16.268 --> 01:49:17.428
The whole thing disappears.

01:49:21.309 --> 01:49:22.469
The faith is a lie.

01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:25.810
Can't grow RNA in a dish.

01:49:26.671 --> 01:49:27.571
Doesn't work very well.

01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:30.105
But you can find RNA in the wild.

01:49:30.145 --> 01:49:32.447
You can purport to sequence things in a wild.

01:49:32.547 --> 01:49:37.371
And whatever you sequence, you can stitch it together and make it however you want to with synthetic DNA.

01:49:37.411 --> 01:49:39.333
We have lots of technology to do that.

01:49:39.393 --> 01:49:39.873
That's true.

01:49:40.474 --> 01:49:44.497
And DNA is very, very high fidelity copying, even in an E. coli culture.

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:48.921
And so if you have a sequence and you want to make a lot of it, that's not a problem at all.

01:49:50.562 --> 01:49:54.865
3,000 bases can be made with high fidelity for pennies.

01:49:55.657 --> 01:50:03.885
And then you can convert it to RNA if you want to, or you could just put it right on a cell culture with electroporation or lipofectamine.

01:50:04.506 --> 01:50:06.728
Put it right in an animal or send it to your friends.

01:50:08.032 --> 01:50:17.477
The point is, is that virology has called this infectious clones, and they've called it that for a couple decades now, ever since David Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello did it.

01:50:18.038 --> 01:50:26.723
And infectious clones are very, very, very, very easily could be made in large quantities the same way that antibodies and venom are made in large quantities.

01:50:27.659 --> 01:50:29.960
And that's why you don't need to call them infectious clones.

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:35.224
You should just call them synthetic RNA and DNA in quantity that can be found by PCR or sequencing.

01:50:35.744 --> 01:50:38.366
And it can probably make cell cultures go bananas.

01:50:38.406 --> 01:50:42.288
It can probably make an immune reaction very reliable in an animal.

01:50:43.289 --> 01:50:43.829
And that's it.

01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:55.016
Virology is transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animals using synthetic DNA and RNA purported to be found in the wild.

01:50:56.664 --> 01:50:59.785
That's how, that was the job of Peter Daszak.

01:50:59.805 --> 01:51:13.830
That was the job of Ralph Baric to create that illusion that synthetic RNA and synthetic DNA can be used to approximate what we find in the wild.

01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:14.930
And that is a lie.

01:51:16.468 --> 01:51:34.451
And so by doing their research, by publishing their papers and choosing the words that they chose, by writing the grants that they chose, they perpetuated the idea that virology was sound, that virology was real, and that synthetic DNA in virology is just a shortcut that recapitulates Mother Nature.

01:51:36.258 --> 01:51:36.719
Lying!

01:51:36.979 --> 01:51:38.020
And that's not true.

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:46.527
But the reason why they had to do that is to convince you that the worst case scenario was in fact a laboratory leak, when it's not.

01:51:46.587 --> 01:51:48.569
It's just transformation and transfection.

01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:53.173
And they are willing to murder people in order to keep this secret.

01:51:53.833 --> 01:52:00.039
Because it is on this secret that the criminal vaccine schedule in America is based.

01:52:01.610 --> 01:52:06.653
Without this secret, there would be no criminal vaccine schedule in America that could be justified.

01:52:06.693 --> 01:52:19.622
But with this narrative and with this mythology of synthetic DNA and RNA approximating very well whatever happens in nature, we have the vaccine schedule that we have.

01:52:20.022 --> 01:52:20.943
That's the reality.

01:52:21.343 --> 01:52:29.308
We have the vaccine schedule that we have because they created an illusion of consensus about a gain-of-function bioweapon.

01:52:30.916 --> 01:52:59.774
because they created an illusion of consensus that vaccines have saved us in the past, an illusion of consensus that was perpetuated very much by Robert Malone, very much by Steve Kersh, very much by Robert Malone, and continues to be perpetuated by people like Jessica Rose, who pointed to the bears and said, wow, look, there's a new signal that we didn't have before, which has led a lot of people to believe that the earlier vaccine schedule was indeed pretty harmless.

01:53:01.468 --> 01:53:03.469
No need to watch the movie Vaxxed, I guess.

01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:07.651
They created this illusion of consensus, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:07.772 --> 01:53:08.592
They created it.

01:53:08.672 --> 01:53:10.033
It's just synthetic DNA.

01:53:11.209 --> 01:53:13.790
All of this stuff is based on synthetic DNA.

01:53:13.930 --> 01:53:17.232
All of their countermeasures are based on synthetic DNA.

01:53:17.812 --> 01:53:26.176
All of their lies are based on hiding the synthetic DNA, hiding the lack of fidelity in full genome sequencing.

01:53:26.576 --> 01:53:31.118
They created the illusion of consensus that the Human Genome Project was complete when it wasn't.

01:53:31.658 --> 01:53:39.165
They created the illusion of consensus that sequencing of this virus is very high fidelity, and we have 16 million sequences of it.

01:53:39.185 --> 01:53:54.338
They created that illusion of consensus, together with people like Pierre Kory, who created the illusion of consensus that we had this crazy virus going around, that we needed to do other things, that we needed alternative treatments, that we could apply as much supplementary oxygen as we need.

01:53:55.345 --> 01:54:02.591
And none of these people will talk about the fact that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:54:03.011 --> 01:54:07.094
None of these people will talk about how transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

01:54:07.495 --> 01:54:10.397
And none of these people will talk about how RNA cannot pandemic.

01:54:10.737 --> 01:54:17.442
They won't admit that these weaponized piles of money are paying for them, that are giving them their comfort and their fame.

01:54:17.583 --> 01:54:21.626
They won't admit that by participating in this argument, they ran out the clock.

01:54:23.154 --> 01:54:26.816
And they won't admit that they are part of this theater that governs us today.

01:54:27.316 --> 01:54:33.219
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:54:33.799 --> 01:54:38.182
And if you like what you saw, please go to GigaOMBiological.com.

01:54:39.923 --> 01:54:41.304
and find a way to support the stream.

01:54:41.344 --> 01:54:45.226
If you want to share this work, please share stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:54:46.007 --> 01:54:53.011
Matt Ehret actually shared stream.gigaohm.bio and that video's got over 1,500 views or something like that now.

01:54:53.511 --> 01:54:56.573
So it's a really great platform because nobody has to sign in.

01:54:56.613 --> 01:54:57.473
There's no algorithms.

01:54:57.493 --> 01:54:58.534
There's no ads.

01:54:58.914 --> 01:55:00.315
You can hear the music in the beginning.

01:55:01.075 --> 01:55:05.600
And most importantly, it is paid for by me, by my subscribers, by you guys.

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.081
So thank you very much.

01:55:07.161 --> 01:55:07.942
Make sure you share.

01:55:08.582 --> 01:55:09.943
That's what I really need right now.

01:55:10.024 --> 01:55:13.887
Yes, I need support, but we'll get the support if you guys work on sharing.

01:55:14.508 --> 01:55:21.854
Because people that find me for the first time and figure out that we've been doing this for four and a half years, a lot of them jump right to the subscribe button.

01:55:21.874 --> 01:55:23.676
But we don't find very many of those people.

01:55:23.756 --> 01:55:26.679
So if you can help me, please help share the work.

01:55:27.599 --> 01:55:28.520
It's really important.

01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:34.062
We don't have much time, but it's only a hundred miles to Chicago So we can still make it.

01:55:34.102 --> 01:55:35.302
We've got a full tank of gas.

01:55:35.422 --> 01:55:36.423
I love you guys very much.

01:55:36.443 --> 01:55:42.686
See you again soon Feels a little slow.

01:55:45.567 --> 01:55:45.907
There we go

01:55:58.004 --> 01:56:04.830
You guys should start forwarding this stream to, you should start forwarding this stream to Donald Trump.

01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:05.670
That's what you ought to do.

01:56:06.111 --> 01:56:07.652
I've seen that kill box lecture.

01:56:08.733 --> 01:56:13.417
It's pretty cool, but it's more complicated than the DOD.

01:56:13.897 --> 01:56:26.988
The DOD may have designed the kill box, but Health and Human Services needs to declare the emergency and Health and Human Services and DITRA and all these other intelligence agencies, they give the orders, they boss people around.

01:56:28.008 --> 01:56:33.232
If the DoD did something, they did something as part of an elaborate theater that they are only one part of.

01:56:33.312 --> 01:56:34.173
I love you very much.

01:56:34.313 --> 01:56:35.174
See you tomorrow.
