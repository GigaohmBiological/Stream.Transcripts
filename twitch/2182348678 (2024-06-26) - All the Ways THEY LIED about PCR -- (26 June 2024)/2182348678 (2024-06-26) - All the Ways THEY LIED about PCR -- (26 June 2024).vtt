00:28.193 --> 00:32.355
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:32.555 --> 00:36.878
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:37.038 --> 00:41.340
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.083
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:46.263 --> 00:50.385
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.587
tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

00:55.607 --> 01:00.048
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:18.331 --> 01:18.872
Ha ha!

01:19.112 --> 01:20.852
Malone was on Joe Rogan, he's our guy.

01:21.334 --> 01:35.173
yeah yeah um uh call me skeptical about that if you don't mind i'm uh like i say it's just gearing you towards major conflict at this point and you know if

01:36.983 --> 01:44.807
If you're still fixated on 2020, you're not seeing the... What's coming at you right now?

01:45.768 --> 01:48.549
And you've got to be iterating on data all the time.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.130
Where is it going?

01:49.150 --> 01:49.770
What does it look like?

01:50.630 --> 01:55.053
What predictions can we make as data points change in real time?

01:56.874 --> 02:06.281
And, you know, Malone is, um, he says some good things that I've agreed with, but I do think he's just too close to that deep state apparatus.

02:08.641 --> 02:17.187
And I don't think it's hurt him at all to be on leading a thought leader on the dissident side.

02:18.287 --> 02:24.311
And it's the same groups and networks that are aggregating and leading the conversation, et cetera.

02:24.371 --> 02:29.034
There are no independent, very few independent voices out there.

02:30.315 --> 02:30.395
Me.

02:33.117 --> 02:36.818
But you could listen to that more on Curie.

02:37.178 --> 02:38.799
But that just fucking stinks.

02:38.819 --> 02:41.320
Put it on their Wikispeaks page.

02:50.163 --> 03:01.047
Well, I heard about the fella you've been dancing with All over the neighborhood

03:02.372 --> 03:04.161
So why didn't you ask me, baby?

03:34.136 --> 03:34.919
Kristen!

03:35.601 --> 03:37.246
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby!

04:05.710 --> 04:07.700
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby!

05:26.550 --> 05:28.210
Check it, check it, check it, check it, neighbor.

05:28.250 --> 05:28.510
Twist it.

05:28.530 --> 05:29.871
Check it, check it, check it, check it, neighbor.

05:41.094 --> 05:41.734
Come on, Powerade.

05:41.994 --> 05:43.374
We're trying to pick our favorite player in.

05:43.454 --> 05:44.714
We heard your handles were pretty tight.

05:44.734 --> 05:45.975
Takes a lot of practice.

05:46.935 --> 05:48.015
Practice at breakfast.

05:48.075 --> 05:49.136
Left hand works the drill.

05:50.376 --> 05:51.596
Right hand gets the serve.

05:52.656 --> 05:53.757
Do you practice in the theater?

05:53.797 --> 05:53.857
Shh.

05:59.394 --> 06:00.475
Doesn't this get annoying?

06:00.955 --> 06:01.876
Does what get annoying?

06:28.675 --> 06:31.904
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.589
Stop lying!

07:40.017 --> 07:41.578
I think truth is good for kids.

07:42.018 --> 07:45.840
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

07:46.321 --> 07:47.961
We want everybody to feel good.

07:48.082 --> 07:50.323
That's not the way life is.

07:52.824 --> 07:54.325
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:54.965 --> 07:56.746
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:58.547 --> 07:59.268
And I have lied.

07:59.428 --> 08:00.308
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:00.328 --> 08:02.009
I don't want to lie, you know?

08:02.129 --> 08:03.090
I don't think I'm a liar.

08:03.210 --> 08:04.251
I try not to be a liar.

08:04.271 --> 08:05.111
I don't want to be a liar.

08:05.671 --> 08:08.393
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

08:10.592 --> 08:30.800
introduced Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:31.901 --> 08:35.222
And then each of us, this incredible, preeminent

08:36.014 --> 08:40.395
panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

08:44.037 --> 09:02.562
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

09:02.862 --> 09:04.803
It's just a big hassle in the end.

09:05.461 --> 09:21.134
But no, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality, there will be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.716
It will be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

09:31.710 --> 09:32.090
The End

10:00.567 --> 10:00.848
you

10:35.225 --> 10:52.557
Here we are again, playing the same game, trying to dispel the enchantment of these enchanters by focusing on the biology that we can understand and know and see what they've been lying to us.

10:52.637 --> 10:57.760
But we're just being honest, we're just showing people messages, we're just showing people emails.

10:59.361 --> 11:08.597
and letting people decide for themselves what the truth is, because otherwise, you gotta take one angle, or the other angle, or one person's word for it, or another person's word for it.

11:08.617 --> 11:10.620
How about just, here's the truth.

11:11.261 --> 11:12.142
Spin it around.

11:15.023 --> 11:21.167
See what you see when you spin it around because what's perceived to be true is all that matters.

11:21.327 --> 11:24.629
And these liars, they have known that for a long time.

11:24.690 --> 11:26.150
They've known that for a long time.

11:26.191 --> 11:29.313
Your consciousness is the prime real estate they've been competing for.

11:30.153 --> 11:31.614
And it doesn't matter what is true.

11:31.674 --> 11:33.315
It matters what is perceived to be true.

11:33.355 --> 11:41.621
And that's why something like Twitter, where fake people can cooperate in lying against us and lying to us about these things.

11:42.141 --> 11:43.642
It's very frightening because

11:46.444 --> 11:53.008
No evidence of spread is a very, very different set of words than fraud in New York City.

11:53.568 --> 11:58.931
Infectious clones are the only real threat is very different than saying fraud in New York City.

11:59.372 --> 12:03.674
Placebo batches is very different than saying fraud in New York City.

12:04.234 --> 12:09.818
And transfections in healthy animals is always dumb is very different than saying that New York City is fraud.

12:10.858 --> 12:15.020
Saying New York City is fraud actually doesn't say that the protocols were murdered.

12:15.540 --> 12:31.148
Saying that New York City was fraud doesn't say anything about gain of function being a mythology, and in fact does nothing to address the scooby-doo, which is why in the world would they want us to believe that all those people were killed in New York City?

12:31.848 --> 12:33.529
And did they really kill no one then?

12:34.830 --> 12:40.154
And it's the spectacular commitment to lies and lies about what questions are the right questions to ask.

12:40.214 --> 12:42.976
Like, you know, who committed the fraud in New York City?

12:43.576 --> 12:51.643
You're not asking the right questions, really, because you're not talking about HIPAA laws and you're not talking about why the data would be available or not available.

12:51.663 --> 12:55.006
You're not talking about what data would have been available before the pandemic.

12:55.939 --> 13:01.161
And you're kind of misrepresenting what a FOIA could get before the pandemic versus after the pandemic.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.882
And whether that's changed or not hasn't even been brought to the table.

13:05.362 --> 13:18.886
And so instead of discussing the right questions and fine-tuning the questions that we're asking, these people have attributed exclusively bad motives to me and to other people who are trying to ask the right questions.

13:21.587 --> 13:29.522
And I believe it's because they have control over weaponized piles of money and other forms of wealth that allow them to do this.

13:31.420 --> 13:35.222
And so we're just trying to show as many people as we can while the showing is good.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.343
Because it's not going to be good forever.

13:37.423 --> 13:38.964
I mean, the internet will be cleansed.

13:39.024 --> 13:39.924
It will be changed.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.845
It will be deleted.

13:40.905 --> 13:43.166
It will be erased or whatever.

13:43.907 --> 13:54.812
And these people will continue to artificially rise because the goal is to invert the way that we think about ourselves as sovereign beings and start to think of ourselves as part of a collective.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.614
They want us to think of ourselves as part of the board.

13:58.638 --> 14:04.400
instead of being God's creation, perfect as we stood at the day that we were born.

14:04.420 --> 14:12.924
If you wanna learn this, you gotta learn the history before it's erased forever, because nothing contemporary about this story is related to the truth.

14:13.004 --> 14:20.687
Everything that is contemporary to this story is reinforcing the narrative that public health is a foregone conclusion.

14:21.608 --> 14:26.690
And that foregone conclusion also is the basis for these charlatans' power.

14:27.728 --> 14:31.170
The trick is to realize that not all the charlatans are on this screen.

14:31.630 --> 14:37.293
If all the charlatans were on this screen, then the Scooby-Doo would more or less be real, and we could just put these people in jail.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.334
But that's not the case.

14:38.394 --> 14:46.378
The Scooby-Doo involves these people being intimately involved, coordinatedly involved, in misleading the young.

14:47.179 --> 14:52.982
And in order to take the power back from these charlatans, we need to take it back from these charlatans, too.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.743
Not just the last screen, but this screen.

14:56.459 --> 15:11.156
And if we want to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of the methodology that these people have curated, then we're going to need to be a little bit more clever than assuming this picture is real American history in the making.

15:12.984 --> 15:24.668
This is a coordinated group of liars that has coordinatedly created a wave of consensus that the only way to save your kids from it is just teach them to see it and to surf on top of it.

15:25.569 --> 15:35.392
Teach them to see it and surf on top of it with a wave of truth and spirituality and faith and love of their neighbor and understanding of biology.

15:35.612 --> 15:41.394
Because then you'll be able to see how much of this is a nonsense wave that's just driving you out into the deep water.

15:41.434 --> 15:42.435
It can't be dangerous.

15:45.100 --> 15:49.825
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave where we stay focused on the biology.

15:49.845 --> 15:51.407
We don't take their bait on television.

15:52.668 --> 15:53.449
We love our neighbors.

15:58.806 --> 16:01.007
And so that's what we got to do in America, ladies and gentlemen.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.628
We got to stay focused on the biology.

16:02.648 --> 16:04.309
We can't take the bait on social media.

16:04.349 --> 16:05.970
We've got to love our neighbors.

16:06.551 --> 16:07.632
Please spread this word.

16:07.692 --> 16:08.812
Please share this stream.

16:08.912 --> 16:10.814
Please share the message.

16:10.894 --> 16:14.516
Share the substack so that lots of people can figure it out.

16:15.757 --> 16:18.138
This is, it's now, they're more visible than ever.

16:18.818 --> 16:22.161
They are scurrying around in a panic, trying to pretend that

16:23.001 --> 16:46.542
something else is happening other than their big game being exposed where this cooperative group of a Lot of anonymous accounts have been supporting a lot of meddlers that are coordinated with a few Americans Or maybe a few liars that pretend they're Americans and this coordinated action between people in five eyes countries and and and people in

16:47.583 --> 16:54.291
in fake organizations in America is the foundation for the Scooby-Doo, the foundation for the pandemic narrative.

16:54.912 --> 17:04.484
And if we can get people to see their coordinated actions, we can get a real paradigm shift to occur, and we can get lots of young people, can give them the opportunity to drop their hands, to...

17:05.365 --> 17:10.966
check out of social media to see it for what it is so that they can engage in informed non-compliance.

17:11.006 --> 17:13.547
Informed non-compliance is the direction we have to go.

17:13.567 --> 17:14.707
Thank you very much.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.148
This is definitely gigaohm biological, definitely.

17:36.260 --> 17:36.461
The End

17:43.934 --> 17:45.735
Good afternoon, everybody.

17:45.795 --> 17:53.942
It is 2.36 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.984
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage as usual.

17:58.185 --> 18:07.412
I've been taking a lot of heat and getting a lot of a little flack for being too dividing and calling too many people out and

18:08.012 --> 18:09.954
telling the story over and over again.

18:09.974 --> 18:12.958
And I need to go back to the biology and I totally agree.

18:13.018 --> 18:15.621
So today we're going to start out with a little biology.

18:15.681 --> 18:17.363
Whoa, that wasn't quite the right cut.

18:17.523 --> 18:18.424
I needed this cut.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.105
There we go.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.612
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

18:25.092 --> 18:40.747
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic I'm gonna get out of this slide deck and open up the second one and Hopefully we'll be able to make a little bit of progress With regard to that's the current slide.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.789
We don't want that one we want from the beginning.

18:43.349 --> 18:50.676
So we just did this one we've also done this one before weaponized piles of money murdered people and convinced people they agree to agree to

18:52.225 --> 18:54.746
convince people they agree about it being a lab leak.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.106
So we argued about it first.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.967
And then once the argument was over, we've kind of come to agree that it's probably a lab leak.

19:00.448 --> 19:04.229
The old vaccine schedule is injuring and killing thousands of people every year.

19:04.289 --> 19:05.709
And that's something nobody wants to say.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.790
And we do not need to fear free-range RNA molecules.

19:09.830 --> 19:12.151
These are all ways to say the same thing.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.652
I'm going to offer you one more here at the bottom.

19:15.653 --> 19:20.196
RNA virology is just transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animal models.

19:20.216 --> 19:23.158
That's another one that a lot of people are getting upset about.

19:23.198 --> 19:34.367
That one on the bottom there is actually one of the more important ones to start sharing, because what they want to do is say there are no viruses, there's no possible way that any of these sequences exist,

19:34.947 --> 19:50.454
or that any of these signals exist and it's no longer a concern and all this biology can be discounted and they're kind of leading you into the same trap that the PCR cycle count and cycle threshold number argument was also kind of a trap like.

19:50.554 --> 19:53.235
So I want to start with a more basic model

19:54.115 --> 20:17.831
Yesterday I also emphasized that the weaponized piles of money are the people that we really have to worry about because they are the ones who are orchestrating this loosely coordinated group of liars that spans from a no virus coordinated group all the way to Children's Health Defense and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan all the way down

20:18.351 --> 20:20.456
to the people that work for NIH directly.

20:20.516 --> 20:26.007
I mean, these are all a coordinated group of people that is orchestratedly

20:27.927 --> 20:35.591
governing a limited spectrum of debate about the conclusions that the public should come to with regard to what's happened here.

20:36.071 --> 20:40.274
And the main issue is trying to mislead the young about the fact that a pandemic happened.

20:40.854 --> 20:55.462
And so I've been pointing out very recently to the chagrin of many people across the board that the people that don't want to talk about what they were talking about in 2020 and have now risen to the forefront in this dissident movement are actually the worst

20:56.042 --> 20:56.923
traitors of all.

20:57.063 --> 21:01.285
And if they're not, if they're not Americans, then they're the worst meddlers of all.

21:02.185 --> 21:10.630
And more and more it's become obvious to me that it's not a bunch of disparate groups of people that are independently trying to move the ball.

21:11.070 --> 21:16.413
These are a coordinated group of meddlers that has centered their operations on Twitter.

21:17.273 --> 21:25.620
and on the anonymous accounts of Twitter that can be used to create illusions of consensus about what questions are currently the best ones to ask.

21:26.020 --> 21:36.969
And of course, they use direct message groups and chat groups on Twitter, as well as Discord groups and Telegram groups and all these other sort of pseudo social media, which are really just

21:37.989 --> 22:00.474
ways for people to be controlled where you have user privileges and the people that are controlling you have administrative privileges and that's really the end of it and all of these people seem to agree that we need to fear free-range RNA molecules if they have the right fear and cleavage site or HIV inserts and so this is the reason why I am like a human like you and sometimes I make mistakes

22:00.894 --> 22:05.778
It is important for us to push these people hard so that we get to the truth.

22:05.878 --> 22:11.562
And one of the things that's been frustrating me is how would you really know the difference?

22:11.602 --> 22:23.450
Have you really ever considered how would you know the difference between a pretend whistleblower that the national security apparatus wanted you to believe was real and one that was actually real?

22:26.893 --> 22:28.494
Because if a real whistleblower

22:29.773 --> 22:31.935
was not supposed to be heard from?

22:33.096 --> 22:36.180
Do you think they would get to be able to speak in a Senate hearing?

22:36.640 --> 22:46.691
If a real whistleblower had information that was dangerous to the national security state, do you think they would be invited to speak at an international COVID summit somewhere in Belgium?

22:48.919 --> 23:01.922
Would you know the difference between a real consensus and a fake one if more than half of the accounts on Twitter are not real people but run by the people who are attempting to create the illusion of consensus?

23:03.123 --> 23:11.185
Would you know the difference between a real foreign war and a fake one if all of the videos and news reports you had were produced by the state?

23:15.563 --> 23:19.565
Would you know the difference between a real shortage and a fake one?

23:19.625 --> 23:23.467
For example, like toilet paper in February of 2020, would you know the difference?

23:29.409 --> 23:32.911
Would you know the difference between a fake series of videos and a real one?

23:32.931 --> 23:43.196
You know, like the videos of people falling down on the street in Wuhan or the building of hospitals in Wuhan or the cruise ship in New York?

23:44.767 --> 23:48.534
or the comfort hospital ship.

23:50.518 --> 23:56.930
And then the question for the day is, would you know the difference between planted PCR positives and a background signal?

23:58.254 --> 24:04.517
How would you tell the difference if the only way that you can measure these things is with products that are not produced by you?

24:05.337 --> 24:07.639
Products that are many of which were produced in China.

24:08.119 --> 24:15.022
Products that are aimed in using methodologies that you don't understand or can't evaluate because EUAs didn't require it.

24:17.163 --> 24:22.286
How would you know the difference between false PCR positives that were planted and a background signal?

24:24.587 --> 24:26.728
Well, you would just be told that those don't exist.

24:28.319 --> 24:33.804
And so that's what I wanna talk about today and how these people may very well have...

24:34.815 --> 24:40.536
twisted things around so that you actually can't tell the difference between a real whistleblower and a fake one.

24:40.576 --> 24:47.478
You can't tell the difference between a real consensus between these people and one that is part of a national security operation.

24:47.918 --> 24:52.239
You can't tell the difference between a real fake, a real shortage and a fake one.

24:52.259 --> 24:58.360
You can't tell the difference between real videos like real podcasts with real arguments and fake ones.

24:59.793 --> 25:05.938
And you can't tell the difference between planted PCRs, positives and a background signal.

25:06.899 --> 25:26.596
And none of these people on any part of this spectrum from up here all the way down to the other side over there, none of these people have bothered to try and explain PCR adequately enough so that everybody understands why it fooled so many people from university professors all the way down to gas station attendants and TV.

25:27.316 --> 25:36.168
and TV newscasters and teachers and lawyers and school board members, everybody was fooled and actually thought that they learned something about PCR.

25:36.528 --> 25:40.954
They learned who invented it, they learned what he said about it, and they learned how it works.

25:42.762 --> 25:46.523
And this is how we're gonna teach our way out of this.

25:46.543 --> 25:48.984
We're gonna talk about six different things today.

25:49.004 --> 25:51.365
We're gonna talk about all the ways they lied about PCR.

25:51.405 --> 25:53.026
The primers versus amplicons.

25:53.806 --> 25:56.667
Reverse transcriptase PCR versus PCR.

25:57.328 --> 26:00.849
Controls, positive and negative, and nested primers.

26:01.009 --> 26:05.231
And then we're gonna talk about amplicon sequencing and the cycle threshold scooby-doo.

26:05.791 --> 26:12.777
And so by the time we get done with this list, you should have a much better understanding of how little you knew about PCR before today.

26:13.277 --> 26:26.168
Even though there were lots of substacks written and videos were made and people talked about it, you will find that no one, nowhere on the internet will have ever summarized it like I'm about to summarize it right now, including myself.

26:26.889 --> 26:27.750
And why would that be?

26:28.250 --> 26:33.654
Well, because up until the last six or nine months or a year, I didn't understand what was happening.

26:34.555 --> 26:42.402
I still believed many of the liars were doing their best and that the information that I got from them was trustworthy or at least worth respecting.

26:44.183 --> 26:52.610
And now over the last nine months, if I slowly pulled my head out and tried to pull yours out with me, I have discovered a distinctive

26:53.704 --> 27:04.849
smell in the room, which is that none of these people, none of them have ever taken the time to write a sub stack about how PCR works and why we never used it the way that we said we used it.

27:07.110 --> 27:22.356
And so this is going to be almost exclusively without, without citation, because there are so many citations available that I want it to be like a, a choose your own adventure that you can fill in the blanks if you're so interested.

27:25.515 --> 27:30.236
And so, first of all, I'd like you to recall, again, maybe I'll get rid of some of this for now.

27:31.197 --> 27:38.579
I would like you to recall, again, the fundamental idea that I'm trying to get across with these discussions about molecular biology.

27:39.300 --> 27:51.444
All molecular biology and all of the observations that we've made at this size scale, even the ones from the 40s and 50s, should not be discounted as false, but rather as misinterpreted.

27:52.851 --> 28:09.589
And a model of reality which can interpret those data correctly will serve mankind a lot better than a model which requires us to throw out all of those observations and try to make new ones.

28:11.115 --> 28:18.659
And we can interpret those experiments correctly if we understand the limitations of those experiments in the new way that we should understand them.

28:19.179 --> 28:26.142
So you can see this model over here of viral infection, and you can see this model as representing any number of ideas.

28:26.622 --> 28:34.246
For example, the gray viruses could be viruses that aren't very dangerous, and the colored ones could be new variants that are evolving.

28:35.006 --> 28:41.670
You could also see it as what Robert Malone said, that most of the viral particles that are released are non-replication competent.

28:41.710 --> 28:42.471
They don't do anything.

28:42.511 --> 28:43.311
They just float around.

28:43.371 --> 28:44.752
So the gray ones could be that too.

28:45.353 --> 28:46.133
It's a model.

28:46.373 --> 29:02.224
It's a silly cartoon to say that if we just try to think of RNA in the lungs, and we try to think of all the different ways that people have talked about this, and we say that the no virus position was a trap,

29:03.206 --> 29:25.767
then we want to have a more nuanced and a more sophisticated explanation that wholly discounts virology, meaning it's destroyed, but still doesn't throw out all of the biological observations that were made and misconstrued as having some edifying powers over virology.

29:27.717 --> 29:49.992
And so the PCR is part of this lie in virology that I think everybody is again, misconstruing the understanding of so that you don't see its implications for virology and it doesn't help you understand what virology is, which is again, as I said in the beginning, it is the transformation and transfection of cell cultures in animals.

29:50.152 --> 29:50.553
That's it.

29:51.795 --> 29:55.139
and using synthetic DNA to do that or synthetic RNA.

29:55.700 --> 29:59.165
So primers versus amplicons is the first thing I'd like to cover.

30:00.647 --> 30:07.656
And what that means is, just make sure I can see it there on the board.

30:14.508 --> 30:21.271
So primers versus amplicons refers to two different parts of the methodology.

30:21.471 --> 30:24.773
One is the target and one are the tools, right?

30:24.793 --> 30:41.041
So the amplicon is the portion of the, in this case, RNA that you want to amplify, the RNA that you expect to find in an infected person or an exposed person or a person in proximity of these signals.

30:41.081 --> 30:43.442
And the primers will be small,

30:45.287 --> 30:52.815
complementary sequences that span a short section of the RNA target that you plan to amplify.

30:53.596 --> 30:58.561
Now the trick to remember here, of course, is that we're not amplifying any RNA at all.

30:59.101 --> 31:00.923
We're actually amplifying DNA.

31:00.983 --> 31:04.587
So PCR cannot find RNA.

31:04.787 --> 31:06.168
PCR finds DNA.

31:07.028 --> 31:18.293
There is a separate step and a separate enzyme that is required in order to change all the RNA present in a sample into DNA before PCR can be used to find anything.

31:19.963 --> 31:22.484
And that's something that a lot of people don't make very clear.

31:22.984 --> 31:36.327
But when you're using RT-PCR to look for viruses in the nasal cavity, then you need to use reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that none other than David Baltimore discovered and got the Nobel Prize for.

31:36.367 --> 31:39.288
You need to use that enzyme to change RNA into DNA.

31:39.328 --> 31:45.510
And then you can use the PCR, the polymerase chain reaction, and two primers, one, two,

31:47.816 --> 31:53.758
to amplify a DNA amplicon that you expect to be in your sample.

31:54.378 --> 32:02.020
Now, with amplicons, the thing to understand is, is that if you want to make PCR more specific, you just do more amplicons.

32:03.381 --> 32:06.802
Meaning you just look for more RNA that you expect to be present.

32:07.282 --> 32:14.224
Since we know that the genome is 30,000 base pairs and it's approximately 30 proteins,

32:17.321 --> 32:19.483
And each of these proteins needs an RNA.

32:20.603 --> 32:36.175
So we could look for any number of RNAs being present in the nasal cavity of an infected person, because during an infection, the virus is producing many, many, many RNAs, subgenomic RNAs, and hundreds of thousands of them.

32:36.956 --> 32:45.742
And that's why you choose the spike protein or the end protein over some of these other proteins that are produced in less abundance.

32:47.543 --> 32:49.725
And those would be the arguments that they would make for it.

32:49.765 --> 33:03.055
But the bottom line is that almost every PCR test had no multiple amplicons used.

33:14.574 --> 33:20.500
So that's not a very good sentence there, but almost every PCR had no multiple amplicons used.

33:20.540 --> 33:28.848
In other words, you can go online right now and you can look up EUA for PCR test 2020 and maybe put in April or put in May.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.180
and see what you find.

33:36.220 --> 33:42.221
And you'll just pull up documents where the FDA has given an EUA for PCR test.

33:42.261 --> 33:52.504
And what you'll find almost inevitably on every one of these is PCR tests that use a single set of primers targeting a single amplicon of the virus.

33:52.544 --> 33:59.265
Now you could have made it a hundred times more specific if you'd have chosen another amplicon or maybe two more amplicons.

34:00.216 --> 34:05.881
But most or all of the PCR tests are looking at one amplicon, especially the earliest ones.

34:06.901 --> 34:21.113
And secondly, they are looking at amplicons which are often represented in their own test by a positive bacteriophage encoding the same DNA.

34:21.173 --> 34:25.176
So in other words, you can find PCR tests online.

34:25.216 --> 34:26.937
Maybe I should just pull one up here.

34:27.298 --> 34:28.739
Maybe that's the easiest way to do it.

34:30.891 --> 34:36.155
Desktop to... Hold on one second, I got something for you.

34:38.577 --> 34:46.042
Let's see... Where's WNDX?

34:46.082 --> 34:46.302
What?

34:47.023 --> 34:49.245
Here you go.

34:49.265 --> 34:51.406
Okay, so let's look at this one here.

34:52.127 --> 34:53.808
No, I gotta switch sides here.

34:53.828 --> 34:55.049
Auto, there we go.

34:56.130 --> 34:56.830
Let's look at this.

34:58.051 --> 34:58.792
Just look at this one.

34:59.983 --> 35:00.684
Come on.

35:03.627 --> 35:11.294
Okay, so here is an accelerated emergency use authorization summary, molecular assay for Ultimate DX Corp.

35:11.914 --> 35:15.918
You can just find this on the internet by looking for Ultimate DX and EUA.

35:16.599 --> 35:21.804
So we're going to look down here and results are for the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

35:22.344 --> 35:23.405
If we go down here,

35:25.087 --> 35:27.929
The COVID assays are multiplex.

35:28.470 --> 35:32.773
We're going to look for the ORF1AB conserved region.

35:32.993 --> 35:33.574
Oh, wow.

35:34.134 --> 35:39.619
The ORF1AB is actually a conserved region across many, many, many coronaviruses.

35:40.159 --> 35:49.127
And in fact, many times in the history of the literature, you can go back and see that they will look for this specific region for coronaviruses in general.

35:49.807 --> 35:51.469
It's pretty funny that they chose that.

35:52.269 --> 35:56.614
And then the other one they're looking for is human beta actin.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.295
And we're going to come back to this in a second.

35:58.315 --> 35:59.296
But let's just go down here.

35:59.917 --> 36:10.867
They're going to use Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 12k platform, which is a platform that is capable of full genome sequencing of humans by 96 well plate.

36:13.191 --> 36:23.438
meaning that they could sequence 100 humans in a few hours and get their full genomes, like a whole restriction enzyme map of all the major disease markers in their genome.

36:24.639 --> 36:31.764
And they chose to use that machine, which is worth about $250,000 a pop.

36:31.884 --> 36:39.650
They chose to use that machine instead of a bunch of hot plates and temperature thermometers to cycle the PCR like anybody else would do.

36:40.470 --> 36:45.554
like anyone else would do, just a little tabletop PCR machine that costs maybe $1,000.

36:46.475 --> 36:57.142
Instead, they invested in machines that already had commercially available products that could do full disease genome sequencing on humans by 486 well played, excuse me.

37:07.628 --> 37:17.370
Now it's interesting because this is the test that was actually used to screen all of the municipal employees in a town in California at the beginning of the pandemic.

37:17.410 --> 37:28.232
And this was a test and a company that was set up by a former porn movie producer in April of 2020, because I guess he got a phone call and was told that PCR is the way to go.

37:28.652 --> 37:36.733
And he bought a half a million, almost three quarters of a million dollars worth of core facility level sequencing machines

37:38.007 --> 37:54.667
and then decided to do PCR on two amplicons, one of which is a human control and the other one is a highly conserved region across all beta coronaviruses or alpha coronaviruses or whatever these are, which doesn't even matter.

37:55.959 --> 37:56.800
So far, so good.

37:56.860 --> 38:09.808
Everybody following the incredible lack of specificity and the incredible dubiousness of the choice of equipment to use for such a simple PCR test that would involve how many primers?

38:10.809 --> 38:15.752
Oh, the assay comes from BGI Technology in Wuhan, China.

38:17.406 --> 38:38.813
So Wuhan, China, and the largest sequencing company in China, a former partner and current partner of the Human Genome Project, is going to provide the materials and methods that are going to be used on an applied biosystems 12K platform capable of doing full genome sequencing 400 at a time.

38:39.493 --> 38:45.175
So the controls are going to be a DNA-free water control,

38:48.916 --> 38:56.058
Positive control, uh oh, non-infectious MS2 phage-based pseudovirus.

38:58.458 --> 39:01.279
Phage-based pseudovirus, that's a bacteriophage.

39:03.839 --> 39:10.401
Manufactured, manufactured bacteriophage containing what?

39:12.341 --> 39:15.602
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA target sequence, oh.

39:18.001 --> 39:27.732
So you mean that bacteriophage that's not infectious could be made at 10,000 copies per mil and then we could put it places?

39:28.621 --> 39:35.606
and it would express the positive PCR target sequence of the test that we have running right here.

39:36.326 --> 39:37.767
Are you sure you can understand this?

39:37.847 --> 39:50.016
Because that's again, one of these ways that the positive PCR could be placed anywhere on earth in a bacteriophage that all the no virus people say exists.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.198
There's plenty of proof for bacteriophages.

39:54.735 --> 40:10.582
And here we have an EUA PCR test from 2020 that was used to test municipal employees on a weekly basis in California that was set up in a company run by a former porn star, porn movie producer, excuse me.

40:10.622 --> 40:11.802
I don't think he's ever been in this.

40:11.943 --> 40:12.883
Maybe he was, I don't know.

40:14.784 --> 40:21.887
And they decided to buy $750,000 worth of equipment that was like a race car for Uber Eats

40:23.823 --> 40:34.887
four of them, and they're running a PCR where their positive control is a bacteriophage that expresses the RNA of the target sequence.

40:41.129 --> 40:42.950
I mean, what is going on here?

40:43.230 --> 40:44.170
Okay, I'll zoom in.

40:44.350 --> 40:45.310
I'll zoom in a little bit.

40:45.490 --> 40:45.831
Sorry.

40:49.072 --> 40:52.113
The internal positive control will be human beta-actin.

40:52.952 --> 41:04.113
And so this means that if the human beta-actin shows up at, should show up at a known amount, so that you can scale the signal of the unknown amount to the known amount.

41:05.799 --> 41:07.240
And so what will they tell you here?

41:07.280 --> 41:14.864
They're gonna tell you that they expect no amplification if they do these controls, which of course the controls are clean.

41:15.445 --> 41:16.926
The controls are pure water.

41:16.986 --> 41:19.627
The controls are having nothing else in them.

41:19.647 --> 41:23.470
They're not a nasal swab from a healthy person.

41:23.510 --> 41:26.712
They're not even a nasal swab from the package.

41:28.973 --> 41:30.834
It is a pure sample of nothing.

41:30.954 --> 41:33.055
And then they say, yeah, well, we don't have any application.

41:33.096 --> 41:33.736
Well, no shit.

41:36.138 --> 41:39.780
And of course the positive controls, the negative controls, how should we interpret it?

41:40.160 --> 41:46.423
It says if there's some of these values are not high enough, then the valid, the test is invalid and you should repeat it.

41:47.004 --> 41:54.568
And we have stacks of tests where this actin, this beta actin signal never comes up under 35.

41:57.369 --> 42:01.952
And so if it doesn't come up under 35, then whatever they're doing with this one is also bullshit.

42:02.745 --> 42:03.526
And they don't care.

42:04.246 --> 42:05.487
They don't redo the test.

42:05.527 --> 42:06.508
They don't give a shit.

42:07.008 --> 42:08.249
Do you know why they don't care?

42:08.269 --> 42:13.213
I think it's because these machines up here don't do PCR.

42:15.354 --> 42:17.556
I think it's the machines up here that they do.

42:18.076 --> 42:28.764
These machines that they chose to use are actually machines that are more than capable of actually finely tuned and extremely well suited.

42:29.827 --> 42:52.615
to high throughput full genome sequencing of all the police officers in this town and all of the EMTs in this town and all of the essential workers in this town that were required to submit to saliva testing, saliva testing and nasal testing when this test wasn't even approved for saliva.

42:57.397 --> 42:58.537
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:59.983 --> 43:02.145
then it's in the name, UDX.

43:02.285 --> 43:07.911
DX is the name of so many of these sequencing things, you can't even believe it.

43:07.931 --> 43:08.812
Look it up on the internet.

43:08.852 --> 43:17.760
Look how many of these companies that don't exist anymore that were around in 20 and 2021 that were doing the testing are named something DX.

43:20.203 --> 43:21.344
Do you know what DX means?

43:30.939 --> 43:32.800
I can tell you that I know what DX means.

43:35.002 --> 43:36.943
DX means Long Range Transmission.

43:40.325 --> 43:43.287
Here's my license in Norway.

43:44.348 --> 43:46.089
Here's my license in the United States.

43:49.351 --> 43:53.294
I'm a licensed operator of Ham Radio for a very long time now.

43:53.334 --> 43:55.355
I've got my general license in the United States.

43:55.375 --> 43:56.956
I've got my full license in Norway.

43:56.976 --> 43:59.858
I actually took that test in Norway and Norwegian.

43:59.918 --> 44:00.659
Thank you very much.

44:01.724 --> 44:05.626
And so I can tell you that DX means transmission, means long-range transmission.

44:05.666 --> 44:19.931
And so I have this sneaky conspiracy theory that all of these so-called sequencing firms that used something DX in their name are actually doing full genome sequencing.

44:20.171 --> 44:21.452
And what they were doing

44:22.665 --> 44:28.487
was then trying to match those back up to the Epic databases and the other databases that they have access to.

44:28.527 --> 44:34.409
They can just use the metadata and see how long it takes and how long does the AI have to crunch it.

44:34.949 --> 44:45.132
These were all things that they were doing at the University of Illinois and the University of Ohio and anywhere else where they were requiring college age kids to take tests every week.

44:45.172 --> 44:46.933
It was a weekly genome screen.

44:47.653 --> 44:49.454
There's no question in my mind about it.

44:50.390 --> 45:01.394
And that's why this kind of company would need to have something like the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 12 platform to run something that you could run with three hot plates and a timer.

45:04.396 --> 45:05.016
That's the truth.

45:05.056 --> 45:08.737
That's how I always used to do a PCR before we got a PCR machine.

45:08.757 --> 45:16.300
You just did it on the table and you had a timer and you move the tubes from hot plate to hot plate or a hot, hot, hot block to hot block.

45:17.281 --> 45:17.701
Old school.

45:22.136 --> 45:24.681
So there is a big deal happening here, I think.

45:24.721 --> 45:31.655
There is an absolutely huge deal happening here and we need to be aware of it or we're not gonna get there.

45:32.594 --> 45:41.282
And so with amplicons and primers, I want you to understand one thing for right now, that the primers, the pair of primers will find an amplicon.

45:41.302 --> 45:47.688
And one of the ways that they could have made this test be much stronger is to have more than one amplicon.

45:47.728 --> 45:53.093
And here is an example of a test that is not using more than one amplicon.

45:53.133 --> 45:55.416
They are using the most conserved region

45:56.551 --> 46:10.309
of all coronaviruses, the ORF1AB, that is the replicase transcriptase, you know, it's the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its chaperone or assistant proteins.

46:11.863 --> 46:18.888
That whole polyprotein gets translated into the replication transcription complex for the virus, supposedly.

46:19.429 --> 46:23.912
And so it is the most conserved region of an active virus.

46:23.952 --> 46:27.955
That's why they looked for it in all those papers before the pandemic.

46:27.995 --> 46:35.220
That's where all of the Sheng-Shi Li and EcoHealth Alliance papers start, is with a conserved region of ORF1A.

46:35.380 --> 46:40.144
And then when they find it, they use metagenomic sequencing to try and pull up the rest of the sequence.

46:44.053 --> 46:52.339
And so again, I'm suggesting to you that there are hundreds of these documents available that you can start to stack up and keep track of.

46:52.419 --> 46:54.961
How many different amplicons did they look for?

46:55.481 --> 46:56.702
Was it more than one?

46:56.782 --> 47:01.165
Because if it wasn't more than one, then no specificity was even intended.

47:03.086 --> 47:11.773
If they didn't at least look for the S protein and the N protein, there was no specificity intended.

47:12.674 --> 47:15.296
And this one, there was clearly no specificity intended.

47:15.937 --> 47:16.978
And so what were they doing?

47:16.998 --> 47:19.480
Well, they were using these amazing machines.

47:19.580 --> 47:20.481
That's what they were doing.

47:21.361 --> 47:29.788
They were using these amazing machines and all of the commercial products already available for them that are probably produced by this company, BGI.

47:30.836 --> 47:32.577
from Wuhan, China.

47:33.237 --> 47:50.024
Why in the hell would the FDA approve and a protocol that is a ultimate DX SARS-CoV-2 assay produced by a manufacturer in Wuhan, China in a company that was set up by a former porn movie producer.

47:51.025 --> 47:58.008
They couldn't find someone from a university in California with some relevant experience to start this PCR company.

48:02.014 --> 48:09.521
So this is just the first part of how they lied to you about the stuff, okay?

48:09.581 --> 48:10.863
This is just the first lie.

48:12.373 --> 48:17.578
The second lie, primers versus amplicons, is RT-PCR versus PCR.

48:17.638 --> 48:22.402
So when we say RT-PCR versus PCR, what we're talking about is this thing right here.

48:22.982 --> 48:29.328
The only way they could find an RNA virus is to sequence RNA, which means they have to convert.

48:30.108 --> 48:37.194
RNA has to be converted to DNA via reverse transcriptase.

48:37.254 --> 48:38.696
And this only happens once.

48:41.058 --> 48:51.431
And so the entire harvest of the RNA platform, RNA signal is based on a single reaction to convert all of this RNA to DNA.

48:51.471 --> 48:51.891
That's it.

48:51.971 --> 48:53.213
That's all the chance you got.

48:53.653 --> 48:59.681
And then after that, whatever DNA you have here is the proxy signal for whatever RNA you had to start with.

49:02.048 --> 49:08.637
and they have to exclude a lot of RNA in that sample because there's a lot of RNA that is ours.

49:09.378 --> 49:14.665
Our ribosomes and our other RNA that's present in there is a gigantic portion of it.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.729
And none of that filtering of

49:26.058 --> 49:55.135
That filtering of human RNA is a trick that we have to take wholly their word for it, that they're doing it correctly, that they're not leaving anything behind that they would misconstrue as a virus, that they're not leaving anything behind that would be identified as a viral enzyme or a viral signal that's actually our signal because we have to take their word for the fact that they're filtering out the human RNA and only looking at viral RNA because they can't do that, but they say that they do it.

49:58.131 --> 50:08.150
It's another thing that is never gonna be explained to you by Jessica Rose or Robert Malone or Brett Weinstein because they've never ever been able to explain even number one.

50:09.042 --> 50:12.063
that with more amplicons, you get a lot more specificity.

50:12.383 --> 50:33.067
They've never been able to explain number two, that you only get one chance to convert viral RNA to DNA, and then you have to filter out all this ribosomal RNA and all this other RNA that's human RNA, and all we can do is take their word for it that that process is something that we can count on as revealing a potential signal of viral RNA, and that's just.

50:34.212 --> 50:36.897
That's just not something to be word to be taken for.

50:36.997 --> 50:39.481
So now we go to the next one.

50:41.311 --> 50:44.013
And that is controls, positives and negatives.

50:44.053 --> 50:51.058
And so we can go back here again and we can think very carefully about this control here, right?

50:51.098 --> 50:53.239
Because this is the control experiment.

50:53.259 --> 50:54.120
Why isn't that working?

50:54.220 --> 50:55.200
Oh, maybe I have to go back here.

50:55.681 --> 51:02.705
The control experiment for this paper or for this test that we were looking at is a human beta actin.

51:02.785 --> 51:09.070
So it is a protein or an RNA that they expect to be present in the swab or present in the saliva.

51:09.690 --> 51:10.110
That's it.

51:10.551 --> 51:11.411
That is the what?

51:11.551 --> 51:14.774
That is the positive control.

51:15.354 --> 51:22.060
In every sample, because they're sampling you, there should be some human beta-actin RNA.

51:22.440 --> 51:29.846
And so there should be a signal from every test that shows that, oh yeah, it's a human and it's got human beta-actin RNA present.

51:30.386 --> 51:35.770
And then relative to that, there should be a second signal for this conserved region of ORF1AB.

51:38.891 --> 51:53.631
And now the way to apply the test again down here, if you see in their description, is that you have this little chart, and if the negative control, which is beta actin, there's no amplification, then there's a sigmoidal curve of less than

51:57.461 --> 52:00.764
less than 35 of the positive control.

52:01.165 --> 52:03.747
Oh yeah, so the positive control is again, what?

52:03.767 --> 52:11.815
The positive control was this mixture of non-infectious bacteriophage that encoded the target at 10,000 copies per mil.

52:14.895 --> 52:20.397
So this description right here is enough for you to seed the narrative of the pandemic, just this one thing.

52:21.257 --> 52:39.122
If you just had this and you produced it like you produce antibodies or like you produce venom or you produce any of these other things, you could produce this bacteriophage in quantity and then put it wherever you want it and you would find a very hot PCR test positive using this test.

52:40.814 --> 52:42.736
That's it, it's that simple.

52:43.297 --> 52:55.010
And every one of these PCR tests probably contains a control reagent that would qualify as a way to seed a positive PCR signal.

52:56.206 --> 53:01.248
Please understand what I'm trying to teach here, because if you don't, write it down in the chat so I can see it.

53:01.568 --> 53:04.009
This is all part of the thing.

53:04.089 --> 53:10.972
So these controls, positives and negatives, would be used to buttress the idea that you have a real signal.

53:11.032 --> 53:14.034
So you would have, for example, a signal like this.

53:14.794 --> 53:41.617
at let's say 21 cycles or 20 cycles and this would be human actin then you would have another signal down here that would be a lower signal and this one might be at 30 and that would also be a signal that you expect to see but at a lower at a lower place so a higher cycle threshold this is ct count this is uh fluorescence and so the fluorescence goes up

53:43.340 --> 53:44.621
as the signal increases.

53:44.701 --> 53:58.193
And the earlier in the cycle count that this signal goes up and plateaus to bright is an indication of the relative abundance of the amplicon that you're looking for here as the PCR cycles.

53:58.334 --> 54:05.240
And so a very abundant amplicon that's found right here at the beginning and that its primers catch right in the beginning.

54:05.720 --> 54:16.194
might amplify and go exponential at cycle threshold 20, where something that's at a lower concentration here might not go exponential until cycle threshold 25 or 30.

54:17.015 --> 54:18.117
And so if you had two

54:19.298 --> 54:32.002
positive controls that you understood well in humans to be a low threshold and a high threshold barrier, then you could really make a nice PCR test for what you find in the middle.

54:32.462 --> 54:37.404
And anything that you find in the middle could be scaled relative to the low end and the high end of this cycle.

54:37.784 --> 54:39.224
But of course, they didn't do that.

54:42.545 --> 54:44.986
They had, in this test, they have just one

54:46.311 --> 54:48.593
count that has to go either less than 35.

54:49.414 --> 55:01.486
So already in this test, they are already seeding the incorrect narrative that the cycle threshold is all that matters.

55:03.047 --> 55:08.012
And that if the cycle threshold is less than 35, then it's a real signal.

55:08.052 --> 55:11.015
And if it's more than 35, it's not a real signal.

55:12.227 --> 55:24.458
but that's not how these controls are supposed to work because in theory, if you start these cycle thresholds or these cycles together, then these two will amplify relative to one another.

55:26.039 --> 55:32.064
And in several replicates, you would get a very good quantification relative to your positive controls.

55:32.124 --> 55:35.007
But again, they're not attempting to do that.

55:37.182 --> 55:44.308
And so positive and negative controls, if they are present, should be used in a particular way that these people are not using them.

55:44.808 --> 55:48.991
They are using them as a yes or no, rather than a scalar.

55:49.812 --> 56:01.642
They are using them as a go or no-go, instead of using them as sort of bookends to understand where the interesting signal lies relative to signals they understand.

56:02.082 --> 56:05.505
Because they don't really have PCR signals that they understand.

56:06.630 --> 56:09.191
because PCR doesn't provide signals like that.

56:09.811 --> 56:33.196
But they want you to believe it does and that's why these controls over here on the far right are the kinds of controls that they use where they set a threshold and it's a go or no go as opposed to being what it should be, which is some kind of scale or metric that they can use to describe what the experimental or the target sequence is relative to a known signal.

56:34.312 --> 56:47.967
And so again, they've told you, these people have told you that they use positive controls, but they haven't really told you what those positive controls and how they would be used, especially how they would be used in a academic setting.

56:48.007 --> 56:56.016
Because academic biologists understand that if you wanted to make PCR more accurate, you would just use more amplicons.

56:56.616 --> 57:05.239
They understand that if you want to make PCR more accurate, then this selection of the RNA that you choose to be good or bad is actually huge.

57:07.140 --> 57:10.261
And so they assume that it's being done with some degree of integrity.

57:12.142 --> 57:23.846
And they also assume that controls like positives and negative controls are used in the same way that they would use them to bookend a signal to make sure that a signal is valid as opposed to just being erroneous.

57:25.253 --> 57:49.133
And they all understand how controls should be used in PCR and assume that because all of their colleagues have been using PCR like this well for decades, that there's no way at the start of the pandemic that the national security state and its cooperating private firms would use less than optimal or less than gold standard approaches.

57:49.953 --> 57:50.454
But they did.

57:53.123 --> 57:55.905
And academic biologists are left assuming that they didn't.

57:57.407 --> 58:00.829
Assuming that they did everything with the same amount of integrity that they did.

58:01.290 --> 58:02.911
So nested primers, what are they?

58:02.951 --> 58:11.218
Well, for every one of these amplicons, ladies and gentlemen, you can choose how specific your primers are by just doing two reactions.

58:11.318 --> 58:18.764
So remember what I said before, please, that depending on the number of primers that you choose, so if this is the whole

58:19.585 --> 58:33.294
available RNA of SARS-CoV-2, and they only chose a primers that will amplify this amplicon, then they have chosen to be rather aspecific.

58:33.775 --> 58:39.198
Whereas if they said, we're going to use this as amplicon number one, and we're going to have two primers for that.

58:39.618 --> 58:43.161
And then we're going to have amplicon number two, and we're going to have two primers for that.

58:43.581 --> 58:47.083
And then we're going to have amplicon number three, and we're going to have two primers for that.

58:47.123 --> 58:49.265
So that's already three pairs of primers.

58:50.265 --> 58:55.228
And if you could say if two of the three amplify, then we have a positive test.

58:55.248 --> 59:02.812
That's already worlds better than just a single Amplicon number one with two primers, for example.

59:04.673 --> 59:18.121
And so that was the first point that I was trying to make with primers versus amplicons is that number one, you can use primers to find amplicons and you can choose different sets of primers to find different amplicons.

59:18.181 --> 59:21.783
And the more amplicons you look for, the more specific your test would be.

59:22.304 --> 59:29.268
And so since most of these tests only use one amplicon with only one set of primers, they're not trying to be very specific.

59:30.230 --> 59:39.492
The one example that I've shown you actually chose the most conserved region of any coronavirus, and so tried to be as aspecific as possible.

59:40.492 --> 59:46.654
And of course, someone like Claire Craig from Heart Group would tell you that at the beginning of the pandemic, you want to catch all the cases.

59:46.994 --> 59:53.035
But once the pandemic has started, now you want to make this choice between fast food and fine dining or something like that.

59:57.728 --> 01:00:10.519
And so now nested primers are very special because if you have one, and you have two, and you have three, and these are the three amplicons that we just had up there, and you have primers that look like this,

01:00:15.063 --> 01:00:33.364
then the real simple way to increase the specificity of your test would be to include a second set of primers that was inside of this one so that when you amplified the first time, you would get an amplicon for which the second primers were good.

01:00:34.225 --> 01:00:35.747
These would be the second primers here.

01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:52.721
And so the first PCR reaction would amplify something, and then the second PCR reaction would verify that what you amplified fit a second set of primers.

01:00:53.142 --> 01:01:05.753
And so essentially, you're kind of blind sequencing this amplicon when you use nested primers, because if the first reaction amplifies but the second one doesn't, then you amplified something erroneously.

01:01:07.557 --> 01:01:09.078
And you don't need to do any more than that.

01:01:09.698 --> 01:01:14.061
It kind of saves you the problem of having to sequence what you just found.

01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:17.643
And instead, you can use nested primers to avoid that problem.

01:01:18.004 --> 01:01:23.027
And you'll only get fluorescence in the second reaction if you have the right signal.

01:01:23.067 --> 01:01:25.108
And so imagine you could do that with all of these.

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:34.034
And so three amplicons with nested primers would give you an incredibly accurate, very specific test.

01:01:34.904 --> 01:01:55.149
Even if you decided that two out of three here was a positive test, you would still have a specificity that would be several orders of magnitude more specific than some tests like this one where you simply are using two

01:01:56.468 --> 01:01:58.230
two amplicons and nothing else.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:01.773
And in fact, a very conserved amplicon and then an amplicon for humans.

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:07.738
It's not even another amplicon for the specific SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that we're all supposed to be afraid of.

01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:19.749
And so what I'm trying to get at here is that there's lots of this PCR test stuff that they didn't really explain to you.

01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:23.041
and didn't really get you across the finish line.

01:02:23.081 --> 01:02:28.486
And instead, we haven't even gotten to this part of the Scooby-Doo where they actually did try to explain something.

01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:48.040
And so instead of very carefully explaining how PCR is so accurate on the academic bench that we believe what we find when we find it, they decided to equate what is done on the academic bench with what they were doing in the field with these tests when they are not the same at all.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:57.605
They're missing all kinds of parts and all kinds of subset methodologies that are used as standard, gold standard procedure in academic bench work.

01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:02.872
nested primers being one of them, but also amplicon sequencing.

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.393
So I already kind of hinted at that.

01:03:04.954 --> 01:03:13.400
But in this scenario here, where you have these amplicons, the very simple way to see if you amplified what you thought you amplified would be to sequence what you amplify.

01:03:14.381 --> 01:03:23.989
And now that sequencing has become so dirt cheap, and nanopore sequencing is so dirt cheap, sequencing the amplicons after a PCR test would be very easy to do.

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:26.131
But they never did it.

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:29.299
I mean, they actually never did it.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:50.744
And even though, for example, our friend here, our friend here has the equipment, this equipment right here is very capable of doing the amplicon sequencing, and probably has already, you know, pre made commercial products that could be used to do it.

01:03:52.104 --> 01:03:55.605
I would suggest to you that they probably were using this machine for something else.

01:03:57.071 --> 01:04:02.478
and pretending to do PCR testing on these people at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.882
That's what I'm gonna posit.

01:04:05.002 --> 01:04:11.991
And I think that's not a crazy thing to posit because of all the stuff that we know and all the things that these people never taught us.

01:04:12.935 --> 01:04:18.639
So besides amplicon sequencing, then how do we get all the way back to the cycle threshold Scooby-Doo?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.702
Well, that's what this whole discussion was about, right?

01:04:22.742 --> 01:04:33.030
Because if you understand what I've said with regard to primers and amplicons and how we could use more amplicons, and then our test would get more specific.

01:04:33.611 --> 01:04:40.116
If you understand that these people were using machines that were really, really, really, really, really overkill,

01:04:40.896 --> 01:04:51.219
for what they just needed three different hot plates and some people with timers, or they just needed a PCR machine that cyclers, those are not expensive.

01:04:51.899 --> 01:05:00.761
Instead, they bought something like a $250,000 core facility machine.

01:05:01.722 --> 01:05:05.503
And you understand that a lot of these companies share this dumb name DX.

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:16.117
And you understand that they have to filter out all of the human RNA before they can start to look for the RNA that they converted to DNA that they claim is from the virus.

01:05:16.557 --> 01:05:20.820
And that we have to just take their word for this extraction because there's no way to check it.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.463
It's just commercial products with proprietary methodologies.

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:36.063
And so the extraction of the RNA that gets converted to DNA that then gets called a positive or a negative test is hidden behind multiple layers of commercial products.

01:05:36.543 --> 01:05:52.688
And the way that they use the positive and negative controls is not in the way that they would use them in an academic setting, but used as a no-go or go or a yes or no answer to the other signal, which is not how it's supposed to be used.

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:56.669
It's supposed to be used as a scalar or as a bookend to give you an idea

01:05:57.429 --> 01:06:08.621
of the relative abundance of these signals and whether or not the reaction that you did can be considered valid given the expectations of these otherwise well understood signals.

01:06:08.661 --> 01:06:11.224
So they're not using the controls in the right way.

01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:18.731
If you understand why using more than one amplicon on a given target sequence could increase your

01:06:19.372 --> 01:06:22.514
your specificity, then you understand what they didn't tell you.

01:06:22.554 --> 01:06:40.766
If you understand that nested primers can make the specificity of each of these amplicon reactions much, much higher in fidelity, and that actually sequencing the resultant amplicon could be the ultimate in gold standard, then you realize when they told you

01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:47.235
that cycle threshold is, can be just, you can just cycle it farther and get a signal.

01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:52.622
You can understand why all the academic biologists in the world were just like, well, that's dumb.

01:06:52.662 --> 01:06:53.363
That's not true.

01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:58.274
Where all the PCR experts in the world can say, that's not true.

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.755
PCR doesn't work like that.

01:07:00.556 --> 01:07:04.440
You can't just cycle it longer and get a PCR signal.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.821
That's not how primers work.

01:07:06.141 --> 01:07:07.743
That's how not nested primers work.

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:09.704
That's not how multiple amplicons work.

01:07:10.025 --> 01:07:12.147
That's not how PCR works on my bench.

01:07:13.728 --> 01:07:16.451
But that's not how they did it in the PCR testing here.

01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:19.494
It's not how they did it at all.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.422
They just told you that it was about cycle threshold.

01:07:23.462 --> 01:07:27.804
And then they had a bunch of people agree that this was what they were doing and they agreed on it.

01:07:27.824 --> 01:07:36.810
Then they argued about where the false positives come from and the fact that you need to have the data on prevalence before you can compute false positives of a test.

01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:46.379
And so they got us arguing about the principles of testing instead of the principles of high-fidelity PCR.

01:07:46.839 --> 01:08:00.655
And when you start to realize who it was that got us arguing about the principles of high-fidelity testing as opposed to the principles of PCR, those people being Jessica Rose and Claire Craig and Kevin McKernan,

01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:14.766
all these molecular biology experts that instead of teaching us how PCR can be wielded like a fine surgical knife on the academic bench to identify the presence of an RNA, even in a single neuron,

01:08:15.731 --> 01:08:25.175
They decided to distort all of these beautiful tweaks that can be used to make PCR one of the most accurate research tools on Earth.

01:08:25.655 --> 01:08:32.859
They distorted it all down to, well, if you push the cycle threshold beyond 35, there's no telling what would be amplified.

01:08:37.887 --> 01:08:51.156
And it definitely is the kind of thing that Kevin McKernan, the guy who's an expert in the PCR space on the Vance Crowe podcast in April of 2024, sorry, April 24th, 2020, should have been saying, but he wasn't.

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:58.921
It was just a blank page and the state narrative of, well, it's not novel like they say it's novel, but it's novel.

01:09:12.526 --> 01:09:24.490
And so that's, again, coming back to this model of molecular biology and what's really happening here and not getting caught up in the argument about the details, but just making sure that we say that these people are lying.

01:09:25.091 --> 01:09:26.811
So they had always lied about this.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:30.993
They always lied about amplicons and specificity and which one was important.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.854
Is it the spike or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the end protein?

01:09:34.894 --> 01:09:36.475
And we're looking for all of them.

01:09:36.515 --> 01:09:37.155
And no, you're not.

01:09:38.868 --> 01:09:47.612
They didn't really explain why RT-PCR versus PCR makes a very big difference in terms of proprietary methodologies and what we have to take their word for or not.

01:09:48.633 --> 01:09:54.796
They didn't tell us how controls are really used on the academic bench to make sure that PCR is highly accurate.

01:09:55.176 --> 01:10:07.222
They didn't show us how PCR controls were used in any of these tests, because every test that you look at, including the ones I've looked at, will show you that these positive and negative controls were never used in the way that they should be.

01:10:07.862 --> 01:10:21.594
So nested primers are something that none of these people will mention, even though we know for sure that they were never used, especially in Canada, where we talked to the guy on stream live with a stutter who did all the PCR testing in Canada.

01:10:22.575 --> 01:10:28.901
They never did any amplicon sequencing to verify these tests, and they weren't required to because the EUAs didn't ask them to.

01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:33.545
And so the cycle threshold story is a scooby-doo that we were

01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:39.008
We were led to believe we were solving a mystery of how they used the PCR test against us.

01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:52.336
And if you believe that, then you don't realize that a background signal could be misconstrued as spread with a few perfectly planted M2 bacteriophages with the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence in it.

01:10:53.362 --> 01:11:09.569
just like is described in the control document of this thing right here, where we scroll down and we see that the control of this experiment is a mixture of non-infectious MS2 phage-based pseudovirus containing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA target sequence at 10,000 copies per mil.

01:11:18.914 --> 01:11:29.917
So what really happened here, ladies and gentlemen, is that the public learned that false positives are not related to the primer or the target sequences, which is a lie, but that's what they learned.

01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:41.240
That's what became common knowledge, that it doesn't matter what primer sequences you use or what the target sequence is, you can just cycle threshold beyond a reasonable amount and get a positive result.

01:11:43.052 --> 01:11:45.453
That's wrong if PCR is used correctly.

01:11:45.493 --> 01:11:47.994
And that's what I've been trying to argue for more than two years now.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:53.637
And that's why it's really annoying that these no virus people haven't been able to say this before me.

01:11:54.717 --> 01:11:57.898
Academics know these errors can be avoided in any number of ways.

01:11:58.338 --> 01:12:02.060
And so these academics assume that many of these ways are used.

01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:04.081
Why wouldn't they be?

01:12:07.674 --> 01:12:11.477
The information most readily available enforces these two positions.

01:12:11.517 --> 01:12:29.692
And then the most malevolent part is that fringe positions like there are no viruses or that FOIAs and over 200 different FOIAs prove that there are no viruses isolated, don't usefully question this limited spectrum of debate where cycle threshold causes false positives.

01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:34.356
And so you're trapped.

01:12:35.939 --> 01:12:41.361
Because none of these people ever meant to throw a lifeline to you or they could have said this three years ago.

01:12:45.902 --> 01:12:47.783
And I haven't been able to say it because of them.

01:12:49.343 --> 01:12:50.584
Because I've been confused.

01:12:51.424 --> 01:12:52.624
Because I've been lied to.

01:12:53.365 --> 01:12:57.086
Because I've been lied to by people who are lying to about people that are lying about.

01:12:59.628 --> 01:13:06.596
and sending me voicemails about the people they're lying about, even after I say that I don't think these people are good.

01:13:07.097 --> 01:13:12.143
I think they are liars, and they still insist on me writing with the liars.

01:13:17.213 --> 01:13:25.745
And so the no virus position is not right, but there are no circulating RNA pathogens like is described in virology.

01:13:26.265 --> 01:13:34.597
And that's why the crossover event of Steve Kirsch and Andy Kaufman is so notable because that puts Andy in a different place.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:49.784
That's why the crossover event with Kevin McCairn, my personal clown show, and the Human Genome Project's high school dropout, Whitehead Institute, Mark Lander, protege,

01:13:51.141 --> 01:14:01.826
getting featured in the same LifeSite news article because Kevin McCairn got to speak in front of the Health Something Australia and because Kevin McKernan got to speak in front of the United States Senate.

01:14:01.866 --> 01:14:03.227
This is not by accident.

01:14:03.267 --> 01:14:07.009
This is an admission that this is all one big show.

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:36.792
It's all one big show, and we've been trapped in the car with these people for four and a half years, where we've defeated epidemics in the past, and vaccines are the greatest thing since buttered bread, and novel coronaviruses can definitely jump because, you know, AIDS jumped from bushmeat, and PCR false positives are rare, and they're caused by overcycling.

01:14:38.794 --> 01:14:42.877
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

01:14:44.488 --> 01:14:53.015
And so it's pretty significant that in the last two days, this person, I didn't even bother to update this, has done another four hour stream about me.

01:14:53.075 --> 01:15:04.404
So I guess I'm at like 21,000 or 21 hours in the last month or so that this person gets to work and gets paid for harassing me and my family about nothing.

01:15:05.723 --> 01:15:18.955
asking the wrong questions in 2020, focused on the wrong biology in 2021, saying it's the worst case scenario in 2023, identifying Malone as sketchy in 2024, and don't talk about 2020, he says.

01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:29.424
It's just all one big show, ladies and gentlemen, one big coordinated Lollapalooza of liars.

01:15:30.768 --> 01:15:38.833
And they all want you to believe that we need to free fear, free range RNA molecules if they have the right fear and cleavage site or if they're sprayed in the right bat cave.

01:15:40.194 --> 01:15:48.239
And it's just as bad that none of these people, we can't just say that someone who worked for the Human Genome Project is probably a liar, but they are.

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:58.333
And that's the reason why these people support the idea of preexisting antibodies being evidence of anything.

01:15:58.994 --> 01:16:03.116
They support the idea of an unusual fear and cleavage site being evidence of anything.

01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:07.358
They support the idea of the diffuse proposal being evidence of anything.

01:16:07.739 --> 01:16:12.561
They support the idea of the proximity of the lab being evidence of anything.

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:18.845
They perpetuate the idea that there's no evidence of an animal reservoir, therefore,

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:24.693
The every single tenement of this... Ten... Tentament.

01:16:24.973 --> 01:16:25.533
Tentament.

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:28.015
Every single tenant.

01:16:28.795 --> 01:16:29.016
Nay?

01:16:29.556 --> 01:16:29.956
Tentent.

01:16:30.156 --> 01:16:30.496
Tenant.

01:16:31.457 --> 01:16:31.937
Tentament.

01:16:32.518 --> 01:16:33.098
Which one is it?

01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:34.879
Now I'm an idiot.

01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:47.447
Every single point that I have been saying as part of the Scooby-Doo was just promoted in Congress as being valid, as being real, as being the consensus.

01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:52.017
And that is the national security operation in a nutshell.

01:16:52.518 --> 01:16:59.442
That's why all these foreign meddlers are in cooperation with American traders to spread the same bad ideas.

01:16:59.502 --> 01:17:07.227
The Heart Group, Panda, and Robert Malone and Children's Health Defense are all working together to spread the same bad ideas.

01:17:07.667 --> 01:17:11.230
And that's why this Human Genome Project employee

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:26.074
was already podcasting in April of 2020, in May of 2020, and it's continuing all the way till now, where he's being promoted by CHD and being promoted by Robert Malone to the highest order of the Senate.

01:17:27.895 --> 01:17:36.537
So that everybody sees these people as heroes, even though they are exactly the same part of the exact same shit sandwich that our children are being served.

01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:42.112
That's why I was on a podcast with all of these meddlers at once.

01:17:42.873 --> 01:17:51.459
Because it's the illusion of consensus that gets created when four liars lie to you about how important your ideas are and then obfuscate them afterward.

01:17:52.159 --> 01:17:56.962
It's very important to see that they did the same thing to Byron Bridle and still are doing it today.

01:17:57.403 --> 01:18:00.165
It's very important to see that this has the same

01:18:01.145 --> 01:18:14.108
A mirror reflection on the other side of the narrative where viruses are believed and worshiped and plush toys of viruses are traded and bow ties of viruses are considered cool fashion.

01:18:14.568 --> 01:18:18.689
It's all part of the same wallopalooza of liars.

01:18:18.769 --> 01:18:19.749
I want people to complain.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:26.091
That this guy did not describe well enough for us to understand, but described it just well enough for us to see it.

01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:30.172
Just well enough for us to escape it if we choose.

01:18:31.997 --> 01:18:38.581
And so please, if you can find an email for this guy, send him an email and tell him that Jonathan Cooley wants to interview him, because I think he's a whistleblower.

01:18:39.122 --> 01:18:45.426
I think he was telling us so that we can fight our way out of this, so that we can pull our heads out, and more importantly, the heads of our children out.

01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:52.144
Because this is a trap and these people are the trap.

01:18:52.684 --> 01:18:57.909
These people and their consensus about free-range RNA molecules is the trap.

01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:59.771
They're the trap.

01:18:59.891 --> 01:19:01.393
These people are the trap.

01:19:01.473 --> 01:19:02.334
These liars.

01:19:03.215 --> 01:19:07.739
These coordinated, artificially elevated liars are the trap.

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.624
And that's why none of these people have ever taught you about PCR the way that I just did.

01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:17.453
None of these people will ever teach you about transfection the way that I've done.

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:26.457
None of these people will ever just say that, well, RNA virology is basically transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animals, and we just call it virology.

01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:40.282
No, they're never going to say that because that is the illusion that all these, these, these acolytes of, of Kaprowski and Plotkin and Hohn and Bavari and, and, and,

01:19:41.142 --> 01:19:54.637
and all these people are descended from the same teachers, Baltimore and Gallo, and all of these retrovirus people and latent virus people of the AIDS era.

01:19:54.977 --> 01:20:03.426
They're all descended from the same people and they're all defending the same dumb ideas by limiting the spectrum of debate and getting us to focus on dumb questions.

01:20:06.294 --> 01:20:07.936
because they've been doing it for decades.

01:20:08.196 --> 01:20:16.004
Edward Bernays told us in 1924, and Noam Chomsky told us in the 90s, that it's always been a limited spectrum of debate.

01:20:16.384 --> 01:20:21.409
And we don't understand it because we believe this illusion of consensus about what is to be asked.

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:26.354
And we also think that it's a legitimate way to argue with people by attributing bad motives to them.

01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:27.815
And so that's what they're doing right now.

01:20:28.576 --> 01:20:33.760
And they do it very cleverly because they get people to do it together and to argue about it.

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:39.484
Like Zuby and Dan Wilson have become elevated as two authorities from different sides of the aisle.

01:20:40.084 --> 01:20:42.987
They are foreign meddlers who are American traitors.

01:20:44.327 --> 01:20:45.028
And nothing more.

01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:50.512
There's no doubt in my mind that Dan Wilson sold himself out and is too stupid to know how badly.

01:20:51.493 --> 01:20:53.594
And there's no doubt in my mind that Zuby is 100% sold out.

01:20:56.499 --> 01:20:57.560
Because that's what they do.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.485
They're part of the ruling elite and the ruling elite agree to do what this guy is doing.

01:21:03.006 --> 01:21:09.573
They agree to argue about things that don't need to be argued about and pretend that they're being very serious about it.

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:14.538
They do podcasts where they talk and argue very seriously about ideas.

01:21:16.178 --> 01:21:23.961
And it's the equivalent of this man's act, where he's pretending to stop and start a train, and that he's some kind of superhero, only they work together to do it.

01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:33.165
It's four or five or six people that are coordinatedly acting like they need to stop and start the train, and so it's a much more convincing act than what this guy's doing.

01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:37.972
It's a much more convincing act when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:38.132 --> 01:21:42.936
and Meryl Nass say that Robert Malone really is stopping the train, so we better help him.

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:50.021
It's a much more convincing act when Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:55.845
and Mary Holland say that Robert Malone is really trying to stop this train, and so we should stop him.

01:21:56.325 --> 01:22:01.869
And that's exactly how they are working for the slavers, working to control, demolish America.

01:22:01.909 --> 01:22:02.310
They're lying.

01:22:03.496 --> 01:22:08.662
That's also why the heart group exposure that happened this week is also really important to see.

01:22:09.082 --> 01:22:21.396
The almost rabid defense of someone like Claire Craig, who has a history of being part of the Genome Project, history of part of AI and cancer work, and a co-chair of the heart group with

01:22:21.816 --> 01:22:33.125
a known meddler, Jonathan Engler, were to say something so stupid as you can believe there was a virus, you can believe that it killed people, you can believe the gain of function played a role, and it's all easier if a virus is spreading too.

01:22:33.566 --> 01:22:34.847
She's not trying to save us.

01:22:35.247 --> 01:22:36.768
She's not trying to break the narrative.

01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:45.636
And Jonathan Engler coming to her defense in private messages saying that there's lots of different views in heart is just wrong.

01:22:46.738 --> 01:22:55.161
And we can see it very clearly in this video that's still on YouTube where she talks about the PCR test that I just talked to you about.

01:22:55.881 --> 01:23:11.586
And curiously says nothing at all about how many amplicons or how many pairs of primers or how well they clean up the human RNA or whether or not they're sequencing any of the amplicons.

01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:26.453
Now, testing itself can fail.

01:23:27.114 --> 01:23:28.415
Every test involves a compromise.

01:23:28.435 --> 01:23:34.198
You have to choose, do I want to find every possible case, or do I only want to find the definite cases?

01:23:35.119 --> 01:23:40.603
And at the beginning of an epidemic, when cases are growing, over-diagnosing a few people is acceptable.

01:23:41.403 --> 01:23:43.705
But at peak deaths, you have to change strategy.

01:23:44.205 --> 01:23:45.166
You change strategy.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:48.829
Instead of focusing on the individual, you look at the population.

01:23:49.049 --> 01:23:53.353
Instead of trying to diagnose every possible case, you want to find the definite cases.

01:23:53.773 --> 01:23:55.835
And you have to change your laboratory strategy.

01:23:56.856 --> 01:24:01.320
So you may have heard people talk about restaurants and say that there are three things restaurants can do.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.521
This is terrible.

01:24:03.567 --> 01:24:19.487
And once you see that I was pressured and coerced and encouraged and lied to in order to trust these two gentlemen over there, one of which is the co-chair of HART, and that the person who did that is named Jessica Hockett,

01:24:20.711 --> 01:24:30.735
Then it starts to become very strange that these people wrote a virology review that incorporates my ideas, but in the absolute worst way possible.

01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:36.938
And then they got mad after I told them a week before they published it, that it isn't a review that I was ever going to write.

01:24:36.978 --> 01:24:38.678
They wanted me to write this for three years.

01:24:39.219 --> 01:24:40.759
Welcome to where I was in 2020.

01:24:41.139 --> 01:24:41.560
I'm sorry.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.081
I'm not going to share it with people because this is the trap that we're in.

01:24:46.762 --> 01:24:47.442
They got mad.

01:24:49.312 --> 01:24:58.762
Then when I called out Claire Craig, they all came to her defense and then said, why aren't you sharing this claim of function article that we wrote?

01:24:58.822 --> 01:24:59.763
We gave you credit.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:11.845
And then I sent a few direct messages to Jessica Hockett saying that these people and this article are evidence that they are meddlers.

01:25:11.925 --> 01:25:12.765
They are liars.

01:25:12.845 --> 01:25:16.227
They wrote this article and their citation is bullshit.

01:25:16.647 --> 01:25:17.967
These people are liars.

01:25:18.088 --> 01:25:20.789
You've got to understand, Jessica, they're liars.

01:25:27.938 --> 01:25:31.139
And she said, well, you should give them the benefit of the doubt.

01:25:31.179 --> 01:25:33.681
You should definitely give them the benefit of the doubt.

01:25:33.721 --> 01:25:37.242
Even though I showed you the messages, I showed you what I said to them and they ignored it.

01:25:39.463 --> 01:25:45.326
And they instead defended and they continue to share Claire Craig as if she's helped anybody.

01:25:47.844 --> 01:25:50.986
And they continue to pretend that they always meant to help me, but they didn't.

01:25:51.487 --> 01:25:59.452
Jessica's now back on Substack, but kind of forgot that she released the Johnson video that I just reviewed a couple days ago.

01:26:00.033 --> 01:26:07.438
She kind of forgot that she released that video and then disappeared on Twitter and nobody knew where she was on Substack anymore.

01:26:07.478 --> 01:26:11.581
But it was right then that she also sent that really weird message to Mark.

01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:18.253
that Mark posted on his substack as an image, and we got no comments, no communication.

01:26:19.114 --> 01:26:28.940
She accused me of meddling with her sister, who I didn't even know existed as far as I know, and tried to get Mark to contact her.

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.703
When Mark contacted her, according to Mark, she said she was gonna call the cops.

01:26:36.444 --> 01:26:37.325
But she called him.

01:26:41.075 --> 01:26:58.121
Now, the interesting thing that I posted on Substack recently is another email that is in the exact same time frame where she seems to have tried to get Mark to call her and say, I didn't know that Jay was talking about your sister, and get me to call her and say, hey, we're fellow academics.

01:26:58.161 --> 01:27:03.543
We should repair this damage between you and Jonathan and iron anything out.

01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:12.593
So she completely ignored the messages where I said I was sure that Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal are liars.

01:27:14.034 --> 01:27:14.854
She ignored it.

01:27:16.575 --> 01:27:20.357
The idea, I said that they wrote this and they did not help me.

01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:22.357
They did not represent my ideas well.

01:27:22.718 --> 01:27:24.898
It has to be a bad sign.

01:27:24.938 --> 01:27:26.839
They have to be meddlers.

01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:28.400
And she ignored that.

01:27:30.234 --> 01:27:39.181
She ignored that and she, in fact, released the Johnson video after they published that, and after I got mad about it, and after I went bananas.

01:27:41.863 --> 01:27:57.495
And so... I'm gonna keep going with my previous, uh... my previous pattern here.

01:27:59.567 --> 01:28:04.989
Don't be surprised if I play a message of yours online if you're a meddler.

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:10.991
And so I'm just going to play a random voicemail from June 9th.

01:28:12.472 --> 01:28:16.153
It's a voicemail from June 9th, which means, sorry, it's not June 9th.

01:28:16.253 --> 01:28:20.595
It's June 6th, Thursday, June 6th.

01:28:20.635 --> 01:28:22.195
I have to correct that.

01:28:22.275 --> 01:28:22.995
Sorry, my bad.

01:28:26.957 --> 01:28:27.557
Where are we here?

01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:32.331
Which one is it?

01:28:35.593 --> 01:28:36.394
Oh yeah, I gotta get that.

01:28:36.454 --> 01:28:37.454
June 6th, sorry.

01:28:38.455 --> 01:28:52.165
And that's important, right, because the... That's important because the mail that I posted on Substack was from... Let's see.

01:28:54.887 --> 01:28:58.210
Where was that Substack from?

01:29:05.695 --> 01:29:08.556
Sorry, I'm just gonna look it up and look at the recent posts here.

01:29:12.838 --> 01:29:14.399
And then I'll see what that email says.

01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:15.740
I can't remember what it said anymore.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.820
I got another email.

01:29:18.741 --> 01:29:20.042
Can I see the post please?

01:29:20.142 --> 01:29:20.762
What's going on?

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:21.342
View post.

01:29:24.076 --> 01:29:25.577
So that email's from June 9th.

01:29:25.718 --> 01:29:31.923
So this is an email, is rather, this is a voicemail that I got on June 6th.

01:29:32.184 --> 01:29:42.694
And I believe that this is a voicemail which corresponds to, it corresponds to, sorry, I'm getting a little screwed up here.

01:29:43.114 --> 01:29:48.699
It corresponds to the release of the Johnson video.

01:29:50.772 --> 01:30:19.181
I had just told her on Twitter a couple days earlier that I'm sorry, but that virology review that those two guys wrote is bullshit, and they have to be meddlers because they didn't represent my idea as well, and they never wanted to help me with McKernan's article, the article that I told you already, we were writing together, we were supposed to write a rebuttal to Kevin McKernan about infectious clones, and these people didn't do anything, and then suddenly a couple weeks, three months later, I don't know when it was, because I don't pay attention to them,

01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:23.424
But for a long time, they were trying to get me to write something that they ignored.

01:30:24.025 --> 01:30:26.006
And then I just decided, forget it.

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:30.230
I took away all their permissions from the Google Doc and I brought it all back offline.

01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:35.434
And then like four weeks later, they're asking me to read this review.

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:37.396
And Jessica's saying, yeah, you should trust them.

01:30:37.756 --> 01:30:39.097
You should read this review for them.

01:30:39.137 --> 01:30:42.460
They really like you and they really like your ideas and they're trying to spread them out.

01:30:42.941 --> 01:30:44.242
At least they're writing something.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:53.366
And so at the same time, she's trying to get me to release or help release this Johnson video.

01:30:53.446 --> 01:30:58.150
And so I told her, you can do whatever you want with the Johnson video, but I know these guys are liars.

01:30:58.210 --> 01:31:02.694
And so this is the voicemail that she sent on Thursday, June 6th.

01:31:03.394 --> 01:31:05.916
Okay, so let's just listen to see what she's got to say.

01:31:05.956 --> 01:31:06.997
It's like three minutes long.

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:13.703
So for what it's worth, I mean, it's such a chaotic,

01:31:14.255 --> 01:31:15.276
seen right now.

01:31:15.296 --> 01:31:21.101
It seems like, you know, intentionally, obviously it's only going to get worse with the election coming up.

01:31:21.922 --> 01:31:25.605
I still, you know, I don't follow very many people anymore.

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:27.307
I just follow like 22.

01:31:27.967 --> 01:31:41.239
If I follow somebody, I trust them, you know, as far as like, I know, as much as it depends on my knowledge and sense of things, you know, that, that it's not that I agree with everything that person says necessarily, but

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.893
That person is, they are who they say they are.

01:31:45.273 --> 01:31:46.655
They are authentic.

01:31:48.257 --> 01:31:56.245
If, you know, I admit that I'm biased because I know that, especially Jonathan Engler, I know him well.

01:31:57.126 --> 01:32:00.970
So I have, you know, for a year plus.

01:32:01.731 --> 01:32:01.951
So,

01:32:04.893 --> 01:32:13.116
If Jonathan Engler turns out to be something that he's not, or some kind of manipulator, I would be devastated.

01:32:13.136 --> 01:32:19.058
I would be absolutely devastated and probably quit this whole thing and be like, OK, then I don't know anybody.

01:32:19.398 --> 01:32:20.519
Then I can't tell anything.

01:32:21.279 --> 01:32:23.860
So that doesn't mean that you have to see it the same way.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.900
Martin's saying, as far as I know,

01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:36.307
Martin and Norman Fenton are putting, you know, they put their substacks over the past four years into a book.

01:32:36.367 --> 01:32:54.695
I mean, I've read the, I skimmed the book and the chapter, or excuse me, that paper that they, that Jonathan and Martin just wrote, or they included your work, it's going into that book and content that I wrote

01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:57.582
Wow.

01:32:57.982 --> 01:33:00.264
Martin's in the academic world.

01:33:00.344 --> 01:33:03.546
He was finishing marking up papers this week.

01:33:04.286 --> 01:33:10.091
And he does play things a little closer to the best, right?

01:33:10.211 --> 01:33:12.933
That is the way he is on social media.

01:33:12.973 --> 01:33:15.915
But my experiences with him have been very good.

01:33:16.175 --> 01:33:22.680
So yeah, if those guys are like playing me or using me or who knows, right?

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.301
Again, I don't know what to say.

01:33:28.807 --> 01:33:38.472
I can't tell you what to do, but I would continue to give them, I recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt until there's really, really good reason not to.

01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:43.334
Catherine Watts, an interesting one for me.

01:33:43.354 --> 01:33:46.936
I mean, I replied to her on Sage Hanna's sub stack.

01:33:47.376 --> 01:33:54.440
I actually blocked Sage Hanna, but cause he told me he didn't care if I got shot in the head or some kind of crazy nonsense.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.001
I have no idea who runs that sub stack.

01:33:56.818 --> 01:34:00.501
I think Catherine's legitimate.

01:34:00.561 --> 01:34:07.167
I don't understand the role of Sasha Latapova 100%, but I've been honest about that with people about what I think is going on there.

01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:23.441
Again, head down, I'm really trying to focus on what I'm doing and what I do well as much as possible because I believe that that will bring the best result.

01:34:23.601 --> 01:34:24.501
And you've been really,

01:34:25.401 --> 01:34:52.848
Informative you know for for me, and I think a lot of other people and you've taken the hits not not just with the clone stuff or the possibilities of You know building a biological bridge there with the clone But you've been helpful in helping people see who some of these players really are No, I think that in some ways is probably your best You know biggest contribution, and I've tried to honor that and cite you where and when I can so you know

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.577
I only know who I am and I'm legit.

01:34:59.318 --> 01:34:59.498
Okay.

01:34:59.538 --> 01:35:00.059
Have a good day.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.021
Okay.

01:35:03.121 --> 01:35:05.002
So, uh, that's all one message.

01:35:05.722 --> 01:35:18.531
Um, and then three days later, uh, something like a, um, something happens where she sends a text message to Mark.

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.121
What does that mean?

01:35:22.062 --> 01:35:35.716
And then says to Mark in a long paragraph that she's become aware that I've disparaged her sister and so this has resulted in her not trusting me anymore because I also was siding with Jiki or something like this.

01:35:36.917 --> 01:35:42.743
And so she wanted to inform Mark that she wasn't gonna talk to me anymore and that I'd lost all trust in her.

01:35:43.621 --> 01:35:45.422
or that she'd lost all trust in me.

01:35:46.222 --> 01:35:56.767
And then at the same time, she sent me an email that I posted on my substack that says, I copied Jonathan Engler here and it would be great if we could have a meeting and we could work this out.

01:35:58.387 --> 01:36:01.549
So somewhere there in there, somebody's not being honest with someone.

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:24.876
because if she lost all trust in me because I was disparaging her sister and was siding with Jiki Leaks according to Mark's message, but according to my message, she's decided to break off contact with Mark, and maybe we should work out something to get the details ironed out with our relationship as academics.

01:36:26.837 --> 01:36:29.058
I'm sorry, but that's the worst kind of,

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:33.503
ego-stroking trap that I've ever heard of.

01:36:34.103 --> 01:36:34.944
It's just gross.

01:36:35.985 --> 01:36:38.207
It's definitely not somebody being honest.

01:36:38.407 --> 01:36:39.928
It's somebody maybe being played.

01:36:40.168 --> 01:36:46.193
It's a very generous interpretation if you think that she's being so played by these

01:36:46.874 --> 01:37:02.222
foreign meddlers, that she trusts these foreign meddlers, that she's only known over Zoom, that she only met in Panda, that she trusts these foreign meddlers after over a year of knowing them online, she trusts them more than somebody like me, who is an American.

01:37:02.242 --> 01:37:16.269
I don't know what to tell you, because she did not tell the truth to Mark, or she did not tell the truth to me, or she lied to both of us, while at the same time lying to all of her followers, pretending nothing's going on.

01:37:17.193 --> 01:37:37.880
that there's nothing to answer for, that she didn't make any mistakes on the Cori timeline, that she didn't take up too much time in that Senator Ron Johnson meeting, that it isn't sketchy that she got the attention of Ron Johnson's staff, even though I was called by Ron Johnson three years earlier and have been in contact with his staff ever since.

01:37:39.693 --> 01:37:53.158
And that this intermediate doctor, the second speaker in the Ron Johnson interview spoke for all of us saying that we think that gain of function leaks are responsible for the increase in deaths over many years.

01:37:53.658 --> 01:37:57.539
And that these gain of function viruses have been in the background for many years.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.601
And that guy, I didn't even meet until that meeting.

01:38:04.782 --> 01:38:08.343
And yet he's selling biology as a dentist

01:38:10.421 --> 01:38:13.844
that in some ways was more sophisticated than, it's crazy.

01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:34.265
And so I feel no, I feel no, I have no other choice other than to fully disclose how I've been manipulated so that other people can make a judgment as to whether I'm dumb or not, whether these people are liars or not, or whether I stood any chance or not.

01:38:35.848 --> 01:38:58.538
knowing that people from Panda were cooperating with people from other groups to make me feel like Jessica Hockett was a real legitimate person, and that she was getting real legitimate attention without ever mentioning Hippolaz once, and saying that she was doing all the foyas, and I was too dumb to see that she's no different than Christine Massey.

01:39:01.039 --> 01:39:02.679
Foyas don't solve any problems.

01:39:02.779 --> 01:39:04.140
Foyas don't prove anything.

01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:16.733
And the HIPAA laws that existed before the pandemic needed to be suspended at the start of the pandemic so that employers could actually enforce a vaccine mandate.

01:39:16.833 --> 01:39:22.194
Otherwise they couldn't, because they wouldn't be able to ask for that information from their employees, don't you see?

01:39:22.214 --> 01:39:28.396
And so the fact that she's complaining about the lack of data before the pandemic is a ruse.

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:34.177
The fact that she's complaining about the lack of this data being provided by New York State is a ruse.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.280
The data still is protected.

01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:45.503
Even if it was partially suspended for national security reasons, that doesn't mean that it now becomes publicly available.

01:39:46.083 --> 01:39:49.344
And yet she's pretending as though it was always publicly available.

01:39:49.704 --> 01:39:53.326
And this is just one of her little, little, little scams.

01:39:55.766 --> 01:39:58.827
Where focusing on fraud means that there's no murder.

01:39:58.887 --> 01:40:01.908
It couldn't be that they murdered 10,000 and lied about 15,000.

01:40:02.829 --> 01:40:04.769
That is not even on her radar.

01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:06.290
It's just fraud.

01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:11.683
And that's what she came back on Twitter and on Substack to say today.

01:40:12.064 --> 01:40:17.911
And that's exactly what the founder and head of the Brownstone Institute retweeted today.

01:40:20.534 --> 01:40:22.917
That's exactly what Nick Hudson retweeted today.

01:40:27.711 --> 01:40:34.102
Their illusion is breaking extremely rapidly because it's really hard to keep track of all the lies, ladies and gentlemen.

01:40:34.603 --> 01:40:40.753
And that's why you're going to see something like Jonathan Engler's podcast being unavailable.

01:40:41.949 --> 01:40:44.390
on the Doc Malek podcast.

01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:48.090
It's just unavailable, even though he was one of his earliest guests.

01:40:48.591 --> 01:40:53.252
And that mine remains behind a paywall, and that the other one that I recorded is gone.

01:40:53.852 --> 01:41:01.433
And that perhaps the most important speaker of the pandemic is behind a paywall.

01:41:01.473 --> 01:41:06.695
But of course, his original podcast, when he came out in May of 2023,

01:41:14.366 --> 01:41:19.429
That, that podcast, that podcast is still available.

01:41:19.869 --> 01:41:25.412
And the first Sasha Latapova podcast from June of 2023 is available.

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:29.915
The first podcast of Claire Craig in July of 23 is available.

01:41:30.295 --> 01:41:32.777
The first podcast of what Martin Neil.

01:41:34.238 --> 01:41:36.020
is available from July of 2023.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.244
Interesting all these heart and panda associated meddlers.

01:41:41.664 --> 01:41:44.707
And then of course, there's a free Robert Malone podcast.

01:41:44.747 --> 01:41:49.971
There's a free second Sasha Latipova podcast because you know, you can never get enough of her.

01:41:50.932 --> 01:41:53.494
And then also Peak Prosperity finally showed up.

01:41:54.281 --> 01:42:10.115
The retired pharma exec that PBS News promoted in 2008 during the financial crisis and one of the first people on YouTube to be ahead of the ball on the lab leak and not really get censored about it.

01:42:11.276 --> 01:42:16.361
You know, Brent Weinstein's best friend, they went to Panama together to see all the invaders.

01:42:20.748 --> 01:42:28.633
And that's why they don't want to have a reasonable discussion about how RNA virology is just transfection and transformation of cell culture and animals.

01:42:28.653 --> 01:42:33.276
They want to talk about no virus or viruses, gain-of-function virus or no virus.

01:42:33.316 --> 01:42:34.757
And that's how they're misleading the young.

01:42:36.152 --> 01:42:40.093
They don't want to tell you that RNA is like a mixtape or like a cassette tape.

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.734
It doesn't grow well in culture.

01:42:41.774 --> 01:42:46.055
You're not going to be able to sustain that because that's not how RNA works.

01:42:46.815 --> 01:42:52.237
But you can use DNA to make a much more high fidelity copy of it and much more of that copy.

01:42:53.058 --> 01:43:00.400
And then you can transform or transfect cell cultures by either making a lot of that DNA in bacterial culture,

01:43:02.646 --> 01:43:14.214
Or you can just, after you make that DNA, you can convert it to RNA, or you can transform and transfect cell cultures, and you get all of the things that you want to happen to happen, and they will happen just fine.

01:43:14.234 --> 01:43:17.336
I don't know why this is running so slow.

01:43:17.376 --> 01:43:18.717
I might have to just start this over.

01:43:19.557 --> 01:43:20.278
Maybe now it'll work.

01:43:24.929 --> 01:43:32.918
And so you can go here, you can convert that DNA to RNA, and then you can put it on cell culture, that's transfection or transformation.

01:43:33.319 --> 01:43:36.262
You can put it in animals, that's transfection or transformation.

01:43:36.662 --> 01:43:39.365
And you can give it to your friends and they can do the same experiments.

01:43:40.026 --> 01:43:46.369
And in virology, they call this infectious clones, whether they make a little bit of it or they make a lot of it, they call it infectious clones.

01:43:46.389 --> 01:43:47.430
But that's just a lie.

01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:56.474
That's just a secret word for synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA and quantity and being used to transfect and transform things.

01:43:57.394 --> 01:43:59.335
And they have all kinds of different ways to do it.

01:43:59.375 --> 01:44:06.799
They even have patents on virus-like particles that really resemble Ebola and can contain huge RNA molecules.

01:44:08.186 --> 01:44:12.929
And those patents are owned by David Hohn and Sina Bavari that we never talk about.

01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:26.639
Just like we never talk about how a conflated background signal with a few good PCR positives, you know, with bacteriophage or something like that could be misconstrued as spread.

01:44:26.799 --> 01:44:32.163
And then all it was required is a absolute commitment to the faith, a faith in a lie.

01:44:34.656 --> 01:44:39.698
And it's not a lie about bat cave viruses or about gain of function in cell culture and animals.

01:44:39.758 --> 01:44:43.119
It's not even about lies about stitching things together.

01:44:43.619 --> 01:44:44.800
That's not what it's about at all.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:52.082
It's a lie about how synthetic RNA and DNA can be used to create all of these illusions.

01:44:52.142 --> 01:44:55.123
And it's really just boils down to transfection and transformation.

01:44:55.783 --> 01:44:57.864
And they can put these signals anywhere they want to.

01:44:57.904 --> 01:44:59.004
They can create sickness.

01:44:59.184 --> 01:45:01.525
They can create autoimmune reactions.

01:45:01.585 --> 01:45:03.266
They can create seroprevalence.

01:45:04.212 --> 01:45:06.396
And it's all transfection and transformation.

01:45:06.796 --> 01:45:13.908
And it's all possible with the technology that has become exponentially cheaper every year, according to all of these people.

01:45:15.311 --> 01:45:17.675
And that's the lie that all of these people are hiding.

01:45:19.226 --> 01:45:26.955
that RNA virology is a lie and transfection and transformation are very real and they want you to accept that as the new way forward.

01:45:27.015 --> 01:45:34.004
The new personalized medicine, the new vaccine schedule, the new cancer cures, all of them will be the same.

01:45:34.585 --> 01:45:38.970
Transformation and transfection that they have bamboozled you into believing is much more.

01:45:43.533 --> 01:45:48.537
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:45:48.777 --> 01:45:52.540
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.603
RNA virology is just transformation and transfection in cell cultures.

01:45:56.643 --> 01:46:01.586
This is the one you got to start tweeting because this is the one that hurts them the most.

01:46:01.647 --> 01:46:03.768
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining me.

01:46:04.168 --> 01:46:07.611
This has been Gigaohm Biological, the high resistance low

01:46:17.253 --> 01:46:19.294
Don't fight in the chat.

01:46:19.374 --> 01:46:23.717
Chances are very good that if you're instigating fighting, you're probably a meddler.

01:46:24.758 --> 01:46:26.959
So try to build bridges in my chat.

01:46:27.739 --> 01:46:31.942
Try to build bridges with the biology so that everybody understands the biology better.

01:46:31.982 --> 01:46:38.246
Don't dunk on people and don't insult people for doubting me or doubting any of the biology.

01:46:38.306 --> 01:46:39.827
Just help us climb out.

01:46:40.467 --> 01:46:41.208
Work together.

01:46:42.168 --> 01:46:43.109
Do not fight.

01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:44.509
Work together.

01:46:44.529 --> 01:46:47.591
And if you want to share this work, this is the way to do it.

01:46:47.731 --> 01:46:48.572
These two things.

01:46:48.992 --> 01:46:52.534
And if you want to support it, please go to GigaOM Biological and find a way to do it.

01:46:53.114 --> 01:46:56.977
Thank you very much for taking the time to be a part of this stream.

01:46:57.417 --> 01:46:58.898
And I will see you again tomorrow.

01:46:59.878 --> 01:47:00.499
Thanks very much.

01:47:46.735 --> 01:47:48.358
You're all very, very welcome.

01:47:48.378 --> 01:47:50.341
You're all very, very welcome.

01:47:51.002 --> 01:47:51.744
I do it for you.

01:47:51.764 --> 01:47:52.846
I do it for my kids.

01:47:52.906 --> 01:47:53.867
I do it for all of us.

01:47:53.927 --> 01:47:55.250
Just push this out, baby.

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:56.111
Push it out.

01:47:56.792 --> 01:47:58.515
Push this stream as far as it can go.
