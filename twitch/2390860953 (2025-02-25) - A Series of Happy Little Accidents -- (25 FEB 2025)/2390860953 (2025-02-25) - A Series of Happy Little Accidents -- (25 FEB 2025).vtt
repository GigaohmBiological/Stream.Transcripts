WEBVTT

00:34.272 --> 00:34.432
so

01:05.376 --> 01:05.596
you

01:32.984 --> 01:42.288
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, good afternoon, good night, wherever you are on this great planet Earth, this tiny little blue ball in space, if you will.

01:42.348 --> 01:52.652
I don't know if it's a disc or whatever it is, but it is 1114 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the voice that you are currently hearing is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

01:53.513 --> 01:58.378
I am chief biologist at GigaOM Biological based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

01:58.398 --> 02:08.548
I used to be an academic biologist and you can find the stain of that work on the National Library of Medicine using my last name C-O-U-E-Y and my first two initials.

02:10.535 --> 02:19.501
I think you should take note of the second paper that shows up on PubMed there and the list of authors that is featured in that paper.

02:20.261 --> 02:28.287
It's a weird 2021 paper that no one seems to really care about even though it's a roadmap to the

02:29.053 --> 02:33.736
the list of international meddlers that started this mess on Twitter.

02:34.817 --> 02:39.639
I have spoken three times to a group called Panda, which I think is basically sabotaged.

02:39.659 --> 02:46.804
I've also spoken and presented one time to the National Citizens Inquiry in Canada, which I also think is probably compromised.

02:47.404 --> 02:50.026
I have presented to the steering committee or the

02:50.726 --> 02:55.850
the trustees or whoever the hell they were of the wellness company a few years ago.

02:55.870 --> 03:07.480
I have worked for more than a year and a half in the employment of children's health defense that had culminated in the publishing of this book where I am listed as one of the experts that made it possible.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.144
I was also given a little shot at the Red Pill Expo thanks to my friend G. Edward Griffin.

03:14.405 --> 03:19.750
Not to say that there weren't other meddlers there, but I was at least given a platform and if you haven't seen that,

03:20.651 --> 03:21.935
presentation from June 2024.

03:21.975 --> 03:22.757
I highly recommend it.

03:26.937 --> 03:36.123
If you want to be notified of this work when it happens, starting probably next week, please follow the directions on the screen and send an email to that address.

03:36.644 --> 03:40.626
Or you can go to gigaohmbiological.com and there's a little button that will kind of do it for you.

03:41.127 --> 03:44.669
If you want to support the stream, there's also ways to do it there at that website.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.871
I host all of my videos at stream.gigaohm.bio.

03:48.491 --> 03:55.836
I host a private public conversation at gigaohm.bio and I take donations and

03:57.137 --> 04:01.300
You know, whatever you want to send in the way of references to P.O.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.103
Box 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, 15102.

04:06.584 --> 04:07.704
RNA cannot pandemic.

04:07.864 --> 04:09.425
Intramuscular injections are dumb.

04:09.485 --> 04:13.068
Transfection is a crime and population pyramids are real.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.730
And they told us something before the pandemic.

04:16.910 --> 04:18.512
I will be back in a few minutes.

04:18.592 --> 04:22.414
This intro is new and kind of serious.

04:22.774 --> 04:24.756
And like I said, I'll be back in a few minutes.

04:26.954 --> 04:28.755
shouldn't just be a few people that are leaders.

04:28.855 --> 04:31.776
Everybody has to figure out their own leader inside themselves.

04:32.177 --> 04:38.800
If they're too shy to go approach somebody in person, then stick a card or a flyer on someone's car next to you every time you park your car.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.383
Stick a card inside of a gas station credit card slot every time you get gas.

04:44.443 --> 04:53.828
If everybody that is aware of the truth and awake to the truth started to do these things, we can touch people, the hearts and minds of people, one person at a time,

04:54.361 --> 04:55.302
in day-to-day living.

04:55.342 --> 05:00.785
We don't need these echo chambers online where we're all repeating to the same followers most of the time.

05:01.125 --> 05:08.670
We get a few new people, but I think we really need more people to take what they're learning and get out there and touch the people that they're in a community with.

05:08.970 --> 05:20.818
By about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids must be told what to believe.

05:21.403 --> 05:25.112
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.

05:27.085 --> 05:50.264
So that is what I've been predicting all the time, that ultimately this evolution would inevitably lead to the emergence of a highly virulent variant that would cause waves of hospitalization and severe disease in highly vaccinated countries.

05:50.404 --> 05:55.068
Of course, always the same, only in highly vaccinated countries, right?

05:56.627 --> 05:57.468
So that's a relief.

06:02.332 --> 06:04.794
It's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

06:04.814 --> 06:08.336
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:08.416 --> 06:13.380
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.004
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

06:18.064 --> 06:24.189
I'm afraid that... But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

06:25.999 --> 06:26.740
And I have lied.

06:26.900 --> 06:27.780
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.701
I don't want to lie.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.562
I don't think I'm a liar.

06:30.662 --> 06:31.703
I try not to be a liar.

06:31.723 --> 06:32.584
I don't want to be a liar.

06:33.144 --> 06:35.926
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.968
Specializations should make you suspicious.

06:40.649 --> 06:46.893
Because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.295
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

06:49.315 --> 06:51.836
And that's sort of my starting bias.

07:01.892 --> 07:03.673
the question about pandemic.

07:04.534 --> 07:11.679
And, Stephen, your immunology professor said, very good, because the question was very good.

07:12.099 --> 07:23.227
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

07:23.907 --> 07:24.008
And

07:27.046 --> 07:30.347
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

07:30.567 --> 07:31.048
It can't.

07:31.668 --> 07:35.409
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

07:35.429 --> 07:40.431
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

07:45.478 --> 07:49.462
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.244
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

07:51.284 --> 07:51.945
Thank you very much.

07:51.985 --> 07:53.206
Can you hear me better now or not?

07:53.547 --> 07:54.808
Yes, much better.

07:55.169 --> 08:03.638
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

08:03.918 --> 08:07.442
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

08:07.742 --> 08:12.867
It aligns so well with the fact that I don't think anybody has been wrong so far.

08:13.027 --> 08:15.330
It's just nobody had a complete picture.

08:15.810 --> 08:19.093
And this kind of suits all of these things.

08:19.314 --> 08:23.358
There was a misinterpretation of the real question that was being asked.

08:23.478 --> 08:27.422
And what people really wanted to know is this SARS-2 thing of virus.

08:27.662 --> 08:31.243
That's the real question, not whether or not viruses exist in general.

08:31.283 --> 08:33.704
I mean, I think that just got mixed up too much.

08:33.724 --> 08:35.364
They get mixed up in there indeed.

08:35.544 --> 08:38.505
And I think that people get, yeah, they get swept away in that.

08:38.965 --> 08:48.068
And it's a very much more, I think the people that are actually misrepresenting the no virus angle, and I do believe there are people that are doing it.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.489
are purposefully not curious about what happened.

08:51.570 --> 08:54.191
They're just sure that what they say didn't happen.

08:54.231 --> 08:56.312
And that part of it really bothers me.

08:56.352 --> 08:57.452
It drives me bananas.

08:57.612 --> 09:00.234
And it's the reason why I don't think it makes complete sense.

09:00.354 --> 09:05.316
That's a perfect segue, by the way, to go to JJ's ideas about the infectious clones.

09:05.376 --> 09:09.198
I mean, it's a fascinating idea, and it makes so much sense.

09:09.558 --> 09:14.160
It gives credence to the they did it on purpose as a biological weapon idea.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.481
You want to go JJ?

09:15.581 --> 09:16.782
Yes, I'll go.

09:16.922 --> 09:24.467
So I've been active like a lot of these, these humans, and trying to get the word out about basic biology.

09:25.548 --> 09:39.337
And I've been kind of focused on learning the immunology again, after having learned it as an undergraduate as a grad student, and trying to figure out where the line of fidelity in virology is really drawn.

09:40.594 --> 09:49.836
And after about a year and a half of this struggle, I had my path cross the path of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

09:50.056 --> 09:55.337
And so since then I've been a scientific advisor for him behind the scenes.

09:55.997 --> 10:05.599
And a lot of my recent work has been spurred by questions and specifically questions about what does, what is an infectious clone?

10:05.619 --> 10:07.099
What do they mean when they say this?

10:08.544 --> 10:10.946
was a question that was posed to me by Bobby.

10:11.166 --> 10:27.044
And over the course of trying to figure out what the implications of this methodology were, I've come to realize that I think it's possible that there are more smoke and mirrors than anybody wants to really admit.

10:35.957 --> 10:37.858
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

10:37.938 --> 10:43.242
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

10:44.102 --> 10:50.886
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

10:50.906 --> 11:01.473
Let me introduce.

11:02.571 --> 11:21.105
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

11:21.125 --> 11:30.693
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

11:37.529 --> 11:42.951
So for what it's worth, I mean, it's such a chaotic scene right now.

11:43.112 --> 11:48.754
It seems like, you know, intentionally, obviously, it's only going to get worse with the election coming up.

11:49.574 --> 11:53.256
I still, you know, I don't follow very many people anymore.

11:53.276 --> 11:54.957
I just follow like 22.

11:55.617 --> 11:58.418
If I follow somebody, I trust them.

11:58.699 --> 12:04.081
You know, as far as I know, as much as it depends on my knowledge and sense of things,

12:04.881 --> 12:12.547
It's not that I agree with everything that person says necessarily, but that person is, they are who they say they are.

12:12.927 --> 12:14.288
They are authentic.

12:15.909 --> 12:26.658
I admit that I'm biased because I know that, especially Jonathan Engler, I know him well, and have for a year plus.

12:32.559 --> 12:40.764
If Jonathan Engler turns out to be something that he's not or some kind of manipulator, I would be devastated.

12:40.784 --> 12:46.729
I would be absolutely devastated and probably quit this whole thing and be like, okay, then I don't know anybody.

12:47.069 --> 12:48.150
Then I can't tell anything.

12:48.930 --> 13:17.749
So that doesn't mean that you have to see it the same way, you know Martin saying like as much as far as I know Martin and Norman Fenton are putting you know, they put their sub sacks over the past four years into a book I mean I've read the I skimmed the book and the chapter or excuse me that paper that they that Jonathan and Martin just wrote where they included your work it's going into

13:18.493 --> 13:24.820
that book and content that I wrote with them is going into that book.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.923
Martin's in the academic world.

13:28.003 --> 13:31.226
He was finishing marking up papers this week.

13:32.628 --> 13:37.533
He does play things a little closer to the vest, right?

13:37.873 --> 13:40.416
That is the way he is on social media.

13:41.249 --> 13:43.550
My experiences with him have been very good.

13:43.830 --> 13:50.313
So yeah, if those guys are like playing me or using me or who knows, right.

13:50.373 --> 14:06.080
Again, I don't know what, I don't know what to say, but I would, I would continue if I were, I can't tell you what to do, but I would continue to give them, I recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt until there's really, really good reason not to.

14:08.188 --> 14:11.008
Catherine Watt's an interesting one for me.

14:11.209 --> 14:14.589
I mean, I replied to her on Sage Hannah's Substack.

14:15.029 --> 14:22.090
I actually blocked Sage Hannah, but because he told me he didn't care if I got shot in the head or some kind of crazy nonsense.

14:22.130 --> 14:23.711
I have no idea who runs that Substack.

14:24.511 --> 14:28.171
I think Catherine's legitimate.

14:28.251 --> 14:34.833
I don't understand the role of Sasha Latupova 100%, but I've been honest about that with people about what I think is going on there.

14:37.313 --> 14:37.533
Again,

14:38.815 --> 14:51.082
I head down, I'm really trying to focus on what I'm doing and what I do well as much as possible because I believe that that will bring the best result.

14:51.262 --> 15:01.508
And you've been really formative for me and I think a lot of other people and you've taken the hits, not just with the clone stuff or the possibilities of

15:02.228 --> 15:04.709
you know, building a biological bridge there with the clone.

15:04.729 --> 15:10.131
But you've been helpful in helping people see who some of these players really are.

15:10.151 --> 15:15.393
You know, I think that in some ways is probably your best, you know, biggest contribution.

15:15.453 --> 15:18.594
And I've tried to honor that and cite you where and when I can.

15:18.694 --> 15:25.337
So, you know, I only know who I am and I'm legit.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.778
OK, have a good day.

15:35.231 --> 15:36.775
None of them say murder.

15:37.777 --> 15:44.252
None of them mention supplemental oxygen and how it can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome.

15:45.089 --> 15:57.533
None of them mention the poor use of ventilation, the lack of antibiotic use being murder, or the multi-year opioid crisis and how it contributes to the effects that they are attributing to the novel virus.

15:58.334 --> 16:00.174
And none of them mention Brandy Vaughn.

16:00.755 --> 16:13.039
None of them say murder, none of them explain PCR as a fraud, none explain injection versus ingestion, none mention the population pyramid, and none mention Brandy Vaughn.

16:28.404 --> 16:48.854
I don't care how you get there.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.576
I don't care what you do to get there.

16:53.497 --> 16:54.157
The goal is to win.

16:58.844 --> 16:59.794
What time is it?

16:59.855 --> 17:00.583
Game time!

17:58.325 --> 18:00.365
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

18:00.445 --> 18:05.646
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:05.686 --> 18:08.007
Make sure you're following Housatonic Live.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.007
Of course, that's a little joke there.

18:10.027 --> 18:14.968
You can see it in the web address, housatonicits.com.

18:15.028 --> 18:18.229
Make sure you're also following the Liberty Perspective on Rumble.

18:19.489 --> 18:25.470
I hope you're also aware of Grace's Dad on Rumble that is deprogramming with Grace's dad.

18:26.410 --> 18:29.592
And I hope you're also aware of Uwe Altschner on Substack.

18:30.052 --> 18:31.733
Denver, again, is now global.

18:32.313 --> 18:40.357
And finally, I'd like to give a shout out to Ned on Substack, who's done some great artwork inspired by Giga Home Biological and others.

18:40.897 --> 18:44.258
A great little Substack to check out.

18:44.299 --> 18:49.221
Ladies and gentlemen, those who see and those who need to be shown need to be shown quickly.

18:50.241 --> 18:53.423
because our children are about to be enslaved by these people.

18:54.804 --> 18:59.247
They are committed to a spectacular level to these lies.

19:00.588 --> 19:10.915
These groups have expanded, not because the message is spreading, but because it's being titrated and diluted and obfuscated because it's part of the game.

19:11.095 --> 19:12.536
It is part of the illusion.

19:13.136 --> 19:17.779
Team Worst Case Scenario was part of the illusion because they're all trying to get us into the same trap.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.441
Same, same trap.

19:23.102 --> 19:31.468
It is all part of a global system to manipulate the organized manipulation of the habits and opinions of the masses.

19:32.068 --> 19:33.309
That's what we're dealing with here.

19:34.110 --> 19:41.475
And I think it's an important place to be right now to understand it this way that Noam Chomsky has said it for a while correctly.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.656
And it is simple.

19:43.896 --> 19:49.240
It is simple to say a spectacular commitment to lies is all that is required.

19:50.180 --> 20:06.409
One of the best examples I had in the pandemic was the idea that my little boy and my little boy were going to play a joke on the little sister by coordinatedly lying to her about something in Minecraft and pretending that one wasn't there when he was or something like that.

20:06.469 --> 20:08.811
But it is the coordinated action.

20:09.631 --> 20:14.313
of one or more persons lying together that can be especially convincing.

20:14.353 --> 20:23.356
And that's why I open with all of these group podcasts where four or five people sit in front of you and talk about and agree about something.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.617
It is very difficult to resist that.

20:26.837 --> 20:28.578
And if it is composed

20:29.418 --> 20:45.148
If that group of people is composed of fake accounts and real accounts on social media, if you are interacting with people like Soph or her mom on social media, there's really no telling who you're actually interacting with.

20:45.808 --> 20:52.010
There's no telling what the motives of them might be because of who they have coordinated their lies with.

20:52.110 --> 20:53.691
Who's coordinating their lies?

20:53.731 --> 21:04.515
That includes Meryl Ness and Robert Malone and a lot of other characters that at this time should really be on your radar as shady simply because of their track record.

21:04.815 --> 21:09.877
Bret Weinstein doesn't have the track record of somebody who's usefully fighting.

21:10.317 --> 21:12.378
He has the track record of a performer.

21:12.938 --> 21:23.767
Very similar to that of Meryl Ness, of Mary Holland, and many of these others that we're just afraid to admit haven't made any progress in a decade.

21:25.287 --> 21:29.450
They are traitors to our children, and the only thing they can do now is make admissions.

21:30.010 --> 21:31.591
Pretend that they always knew.

21:32.092 --> 21:33.513
Pretend that it didn't matter.

21:33.593 --> 21:44.541
For example, here's Kevin McKernan in concert with an anonymous account, pretending that telling people that these were transfections in 2020 wouldn't have mattered.

21:44.941 --> 21:48.784
He's pretending that maybe he even said it once, which he didn't, of course.

21:49.204 --> 21:53.167
He's pretending that not one college kid would have cared to know

21:53.667 --> 21:57.709
that they were being coerced into transfecting themselves.

21:58.709 --> 22:05.312
And that same liar is spectacularly committed to other lies now that he's telling on big podcasts.

22:06.973 --> 22:11.695
And he has actually been doing it for the entire duration of the pandemic.

22:12.755 --> 22:18.918
He's been doing it on Twitter, where he has also been very vocal about how that's where the mystery is being solved.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.417
And of course, this is all about teaching our children gain of function.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.100
It's all about teaching our children this mythology.

22:27.120 --> 22:35.209
And the trick is getting us to teach it to our kids, because if it's just on the news, but all the parents say the news is bullshit, then this won't work.

22:35.890 --> 22:41.196
We have to be scared enough to teach our kids, and that's why it's dangerous that the farm animals are waking up.

22:42.503 --> 22:46.384
That's why it's dangerous that adults are starting to find common sense again.

22:47.125 --> 22:53.827
That's why it's dangerous that adults are starting to realize that the other adults on TV are just kids in adult clothing.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.008
They are just children like we are.

22:57.748 --> 22:59.429
We are all children of Earth.

22:59.469 --> 23:01.630
And this is about the grandchildren of Earth, actually.

23:01.790 --> 23:05.231
And once you realize that, you realize that the only way out is noncompliance.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.541
And that's not what any of these people are engaged in.

23:08.581 --> 23:12.441
The truth is right in your face, but they're not engaged in noncompliance.

23:12.461 --> 23:17.963
Not by any stretch of the imagination was Bret Weinstein engaged in noncompliance.

23:18.023 --> 23:21.223
Did he save anyone from the masks in the band room?

23:22.324 --> 23:28.525
No one is talking about the history and how it matters, but it definitely matters.

23:28.605 --> 23:31.586
We have given power over to these charlatans.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.995
And this might be time to take it back.

23:35.055 --> 23:39.738
It might be the one time in history where it's possible to take it back from them.

23:39.778 --> 23:44.221
And the reason why is because they've goofed up, ladies and gentlemen.

23:44.261 --> 23:46.202
I really think that they've goofed up.

23:48.891 --> 23:52.232
I think it's actually possible that they have goofed up.

23:52.252 --> 23:54.233
I don't know what I just did there.

23:54.273 --> 23:55.134
Hold on one second.

23:57.715 --> 23:58.535
Is that possible?

23:59.635 --> 24:00.276
Yeah, that's right.

24:00.436 --> 24:02.056
Wow, I don't know what happened there.

24:02.116 --> 24:02.937
I didn't mean to do that.

24:02.977 --> 24:03.537
Sorry about that.

24:04.057 --> 24:05.438
This time could be different though.

24:05.458 --> 24:18.323
And I think if we start to realize who these people are on this map and who they've been connected to that I didn't have personal connections to, all these people are people that I would be willing to bet all the chips on.

24:20.174 --> 24:29.139
And if I'm wrong, I'm only gonna be wrong about a couple of those people because I have a detailed diary of the experiences I've had with these people.

24:29.239 --> 24:36.122
And I think that part of the role that I have, the gift that I might be able to offer the world is just that truth.

24:36.162 --> 24:44.366
Whatever happened to me, the alien that I saw, I want to tell that story to as many people as possible because I think it is a message of hope.

24:45.126 --> 24:46.347
It is a message of truth.

24:46.427 --> 24:47.808
It is a message of biology.

24:47.828 --> 24:53.091
It is a message of the triumph of friendship over this.

24:53.772 --> 25:00.416
Because my friendship with Mark Kulak is one of the reasons why I am where I am.

25:00.636 --> 25:04.619
My friendship with some of these other people is one of the reasons why I am where I am.

25:05.580 --> 25:13.803
like Jeff and Kara, like Greg in California, and other Greg in California, like Rodney in California.

25:13.843 --> 25:20.745
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is intramuscular injection is dumb, and Brandy Vaughn told us that in 2015.

25:21.726 --> 25:29.849
Transfection in healthy people is definitely a crime because every academic biologist in America and around the world should know that.

25:30.909 --> 25:32.250
And RNA cannot pandemic.

25:32.590 --> 25:35.110
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

25:35.150 --> 25:50.655
And if you know anything about DNA and all the magic that it's responsible for, then you should know enough to be skeptical of this idea that an RNA molecule spilled in a mud puddle at the market in Wuhan is responsible for the last five years of human history.

25:51.235 --> 25:58.684
That is a mythology that a lot of people are doing heavy lifting on, and we're gonna stop it by trying to spread the word very simply.

25:58.764 --> 26:01.127
Something that can fit on a billboard, for example.

26:01.688 --> 26:06.774
Something that could be on an 8x10 or on a business card.

26:07.935 --> 26:08.535
like the U.S.

26:08.596 --> 26:11.157
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.698
Oh my goodness, that's pretty scary to say, isn't it?

26:13.758 --> 26:23.162
But it's not really when you understand that the foundational principle of the vaccine schedule, intramuscular injection, is just plain dumb.

26:23.822 --> 26:24.583
It's just dumb.

26:25.083 --> 26:32.166
You don't need a bunch of randomized controlled trials with placebo to understand that intramuscular injection is dumb.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.764
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

26:38.804 --> 26:40.104
This is GigaOM Biological.

26:40.144 --> 26:44.826
I'm my own producer, so give me one second to flip over to another camera.

26:46.346 --> 26:48.167
Good morning, everyone.

26:48.187 --> 26:49.647
This is GigaOM Biological.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.608
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

26:50.648 --> 26:53.249
I'm coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

26:53.709 --> 26:54.709
I'm very happy to be here.

26:54.749 --> 26:55.870
It's been a few days off.

26:55.910 --> 26:56.490
I've had a lot of

26:57.230 --> 26:58.411
A lot of balls in the air here.

26:59.071 --> 27:00.552
Trying to keep ends meet.

27:00.672 --> 27:02.093
Yesterday the furnace died.

27:02.193 --> 27:04.054
Long story short, the furnace is working again.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.496
Hopefully this is a giant cup of something coming.

27:07.656 --> 27:09.057
Oh my gosh, look at that.

27:09.758 --> 27:13.100
This is a new cup that I got from my wife, which I think is really great.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.081
It's a cup of coffee that is covered in mixtapes.

27:16.662 --> 27:24.707
I don't know if mixtapes matter or anything like that, but mixtapes was a metaphor that Jessica Rose really liked.

27:25.467 --> 27:26.447
I thought it was pretty cool.

27:26.587 --> 27:27.647
Nice gift from my wife.

27:27.667 --> 27:32.468
Ooh, that's hot.

27:32.508 --> 27:33.448
I like my hot coffee.

27:34.088 --> 27:34.869
Welcome to the show.

27:35.689 --> 27:37.069
It is the 25th of February, 2025.

27:37.769 --> 27:40.350
I've got a long one for you, but there's lots of work to do.

27:40.370 --> 27:42.630
There's lots of work to do.

27:43.570 --> 27:45.850
It's a lot about connecting the dots, okay?

27:45.890 --> 27:54.112
It's a lot about understanding really what's happening and it's also about my maturing from a

27:56.479 --> 28:10.758
from somebody who's trying to understand what's going on frantically, trying to still deal with the loss of what I thought was the career that I was going to have for the rest of my life, the idea that I had an identity as a neurobiologist that I've now

28:11.519 --> 28:18.948
kind of lost in the sense of what I thought it was and what it meant to me and all the people that whose respect I thought was important.

28:19.809 --> 28:22.432
It's been a long five years for me and my family.

28:22.472 --> 28:29.260
It's been a long five years for me and my wife, who is my best friend and who, you know, has watched me

28:30.498 --> 28:39.184
grow and wither and grow and wither through the waves of pain that this whole ordeal has been for our family.

28:39.244 --> 28:46.708
But in the end, we've come through stronger and it is 2025 and it is absolutely remarkable where we are.

28:46.748 --> 28:51.291
And I'm really excited to be able to take you on this little journey today.

28:51.311 --> 28:53.913
It is a journey of hope.

28:54.613 --> 28:56.074
I really think it's a journey of hope.

28:58.176 --> 28:59.877
It's a journey of hope in the sense that

29:02.990 --> 29:09.392
in the sense that I think the evidence is clear now.

29:09.752 --> 29:11.113
Let me make myself a little bigger.

29:11.133 --> 29:27.118
It is clear now from the behavior of these people that if you just lay it out on a calendar, it's kind of like you just have to shoulder shrug and say like, okay, so maybe Jay's right about these people.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.859
Like it doesn't really make sense anymore.

29:30.931 --> 29:56.610
And I think Mark Kulak has done a really good job of archiving everything that needs to be archived, but his latest work, archiving Brandy Vaughn's recent history and her work as an anti-vaxxer when she came on the stage, on the scene in 2015 or something like that, has really been vital to kind of demonstrating to me

29:57.822 --> 30:02.786
as a biologist who's been struggling to understand and struggling with doubt.

30:02.906 --> 30:05.848
Every day I wake up and wonder if I'm wrong about this stuff.

30:05.868 --> 30:08.390
Have I made a fool of myself for the last five years?

30:08.871 --> 30:11.072
Is there something really big that I've missed?

30:11.833 --> 30:17.798
Is it possible that I've dragged my family through all of this and I'm a fraud?

30:18.618 --> 30:21.180
You don't think I ask myself that every once in a while?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.121
Well, of course I do.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.525
In fact, the only reason why I could possibly be here

30:27.737 --> 30:29.598
or here, whatever you want to see it as.

30:30.439 --> 30:39.125
The only way that I could be here, where I am, is because at every possibility, I have doubted myself.

30:39.605 --> 30:49.512
Every person that I've met, I've asked to help me, to reassure me that I'm not wrong about these things, that I'm not crazy for asking these questions.

30:49.573 --> 30:56.898
And so for me, my best thing that I can offer you is, is that for your family and friends, it might not be for all of them.

30:57.895 --> 31:01.677
This message of hope might not be for all of them, but it is for any of them.

31:03.018 --> 31:07.380
Any of them that is willing to just listen and think along can hear it.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.501
And it will take an hour or two.

31:11.002 --> 31:27.710
But if changing the fundamental way that someone thinks about their world in a positive, in a enlightening, in a freeing and invigorating sort of way costs an hour and a half, I don't really think that's a big price to pay.

31:28.888 --> 31:35.552
And so I'm going to attempt to take a swing at the fence today because I really think some people have made a pretty big mistake.

31:35.613 --> 31:46.019
And if I can carefully, without too much emotion, illustrate what these people have done, I think it will become very obvious and it will line up so well.

31:46.100 --> 31:55.586
It will harmonize so well with all of the other examples of very similar meddling that we've seen throughout the pandemic.

31:55.626 --> 31:58.648
And you will actually see that it's just all one big show.

32:00.089 --> 32:06.112
And it will become a message that you, one of you out there, might become more motivated to share than you've ever been before.

32:06.172 --> 32:16.699
Maybe there's 10 people out there who've been sitting and passively taking in my work for a year that will finally be spurred to action by today's show.

32:17.677 --> 32:33.469
That's the only thing I can really hope is that every show might change one person's mind who will start to decide to make their own gigaohm biological business card and start to distribute it with the link that they think is most important.

32:34.656 --> 32:41.879
And very soon we will have landing pages on GigaOM Biological that will succinctly be these kinds of things.

32:41.939 --> 32:47.381
You know, it's not very hard for you to take a screenshot of any of these slides and put them out there.

32:48.041 --> 32:52.622
But we'll make it easier and easier because this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of Earth.

32:52.662 --> 32:56.504
And that means that this is about you and me and our kids.

32:57.389 --> 33:08.998
And we have to start to realize that we need to bring our kids on side to understand that this is a multi-generational war for their children, which is our grandchildren, right?

33:10.599 --> 33:21.928
It has been a long strange trip since somebody stapled my website to a trucker billboard or a trucker sign in Canada.

33:23.626 --> 33:31.488
It's been a long, long trip since this picture was taken at the inaugural CHD conference in Knoxville, Tennessee.

33:34.468 --> 33:50.912
It's been a very long, strange trip that it's taken me in order to get to the stage where I too could kind of try to say it like Edward Bernays has said it, like Noam Chomsky has said it, like lots of scholars have said it.

33:52.551 --> 34:19.600
but say it in a way that's meaningful for today's kids, for today's teenagers, the overclass, the people for whom money doesn't matter, are able to remain in control of the world and ever more influential on our governments because they place highly trained acolytes in positions on social media with artificial elevation to manipulate the habits and opinions of the voters

34:21.892 --> 34:24.553
to whom these people are responsible.

34:27.074 --> 34:34.656
And so they can manipulate the system from within and from out in order to control it.

34:34.856 --> 34:51.321
And so, yes, you know, for a long time, we've been talking about the fact that our government is corrupted, but on not understanding the breadth and the depth of the corruption will never allow our kids to understand why voting is not gonna get them out unless they're voting for each other.

34:53.561 --> 34:56.863
Voting is never gonna get us out unless we're voting for each other.

34:56.923 --> 35:00.185
Unless you know who you're electing, you're done.

35:00.365 --> 35:08.169
And unless that person is going in with the intention of wrecking it, we're just gonna have the status quo.

35:08.229 --> 35:09.690
And that is what's happening.

35:09.730 --> 35:18.035
Maybe I'm getting a little off message here, but to understand what happened in the pandemic, ladies and gentlemen, you need to accept the fact that it's been a while now.

35:18.917 --> 35:25.000
since the overclass has had people in place on YouTube and on social media doing stuff

35:26.158 --> 35:33.381
that you thought was just another person out there, another person out there, another guy out there, another girl out there, somebody with a dream.

35:33.501 --> 35:49.228
No, these are people that were paid, placed, and artificially promoted in front of us so that they rose in our consciousness as people that we think about on social media, doing things that we ourselves would never have time for.

35:51.926 --> 36:03.741
And that is ultimately what happened at the beginning of the pandemic until now, is that they were able to convince us to teach our children that there was a novel virus, although we can't be sure when it really broke out.

36:04.301 --> 36:07.866
And some people think it's a lab virus, other people don't, I don't even know.

36:07.886 --> 36:10.349
You know, I'm kind of agnostic about that.

36:12.307 --> 36:25.979
And in the meantime, because these people were in place on social media, manipulating the questions that we asked, no one has come to the useful conclusion that PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud, period.

36:27.260 --> 36:35.306
No one has come to the conclusion that pure oxygen could be used to create everything that happened in America in 2020.

36:35.507 --> 36:40.691
Even though Pierre Kory and Peter McCullough surely could figure that out.

36:42.230 --> 36:47.273
The literature goes back to the late 80s, early 90s.

36:50.874 --> 37:04.061
And finally, any doctor worth their salt should at this point be saying that anybody who was not given antibiotics in 2020 under the pretense that it's a viral pneumonia should be considered a murder.

37:05.662 --> 37:06.763
That's the bottom line.

37:06.863 --> 37:11.205
Anybody that didn't get antibiotics and had a urinary tract infection, that's murder.

37:13.072 --> 37:17.433
Anybody that died of cold or thirst, like in the UK, that's murder.

37:19.434 --> 37:21.034
It's not democide.

37:21.915 --> 37:22.795
It's murder.

37:22.875 --> 37:26.476
Democide is a dumb word that doesn't mean what you think it means.

37:29.437 --> 37:29.917
It's murder.

37:31.690 --> 37:40.054
And so now what has been established as a result of these coordinated liars is a existing remnant stream.

37:40.094 --> 37:55.200
And in case you're not aware of it, because you've been asleep at the wheel like many adults on earth, the remnants from hospitals are sold to pharmaceutical companies and to biotech companies and to universities.

37:56.314 --> 38:03.079
and the more consistent the source of remnant, the more valuable it potentially is.

38:04.139 --> 38:09.283
For example, you can do the research yourself and find out that placentas are sold.

38:10.404 --> 38:24.934
You can also do the research to find out that C-section placentas are sold at a significantly higher rate of cost and they get much more money for them than they do a normal birth placenta.

38:27.227 --> 38:35.513
You also may not be aware, but circumcising male babies is still going on in America, and it's still happening really close to the birth date.

38:35.573 --> 38:42.198
Like sometimes the same day, they cut all the foreskin off the penises of babies in America.

38:42.698 --> 38:45.060
And that is not done for the health of the baby.

38:45.100 --> 38:51.705
That is done because those remnants are valuable, because they are the source of cell culture, fibroblasts.

38:54.909 --> 38:56.610
And this is still ongoing.

38:56.650 --> 39:01.093
You can find virologists who just talk about it in their Virology 101 lectures.

39:03.455 --> 39:18.326
And yet somehow we still have a Health and Human Services Secretary who's mainly focused on certain number dyes and any number of other things at random, but not a priority one, two, three, four list.

39:21.041 --> 39:33.050
And Children's Health Defense, you know, the premier organization in America that's supposedly fighting against this medical-industrial complex, has never once mentioned remnants.

39:34.485 --> 39:40.190
Not once, none of these dissidents mentioned it, but actually think about the number of remnants.

39:40.530 --> 39:43.392
This is a message specifically to the college kids out there.

39:44.393 --> 39:53.260
If you went to a college in 2020 and 2021, where you were made to test any amount, your DNA was sampled.

39:53.841 --> 39:57.964
If you were made to quarantine and test your way out of quarantine, your DNA was sampled.

40:01.367 --> 40:02.308
That's the bottom line.

40:03.479 --> 40:08.002
And so if you went to a university where testing was mandatory, your DNA was sampled.

40:13.066 --> 40:20.232
And you should form a class action lawsuit with everybody that matriculated in that school during those years with you.

40:20.312 --> 40:21.893
You should be doing that right now.

40:23.837 --> 40:35.113
And this is going on right now in all of our hospitals and it's going to continue to go on as long as these people are allowed to distract the American public and most adults with their nonsense.

40:39.008 --> 40:55.010
Now the bottom line is I'm going to have to present this like a hundred more times so it's not going to be the best presentation today but the content of the presentation is what is most important right now and what we've uncovered and should have probably uncovered already a year ago if I would have been paying attention or my email wouldn't have been screwed up or I wasn't an idiot

40:56.158 --> 41:02.801
is that Brandy Vaughn's story is like a repeat of all of our stories, but it's like a few years before the pandemic.

41:03.561 --> 41:13.726
Basically, she's a lady who got very close to pharma, figured out that pharma was full of crap, and then suddenly realized, wait, if pharma's full of crap, then what about these vaccines?

41:13.786 --> 41:16.307
And then realized, oh my goodness, what's happening here?

41:18.410 --> 41:19.771
and started speaking out about it.

41:19.831 --> 41:28.034
And she spoke about it with very much precision that included things like, you know, ingestion versus ingestion is very, very different.

41:28.234 --> 41:34.196
And injection versus ingestion is very close to what I've been saying lately, which is intramuscular injection is dumb.

41:34.636 --> 41:43.400
And when I finally pulled my head out and figured out that Brandy had it right in 2016, it actually shockingly lines up

41:45.069 --> 41:52.216
with the time frame of the people that I've worked with during the course of the pandemic who curiously never told me about Brandy Vaughn.

41:54.418 --> 41:55.179
It's weird, right?

41:55.219 --> 41:58.062
To be an employee of CHD and never hear of Brandy Vaughn.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.551
Anyway, that's my story.

42:02.672 --> 42:06.714
Brandy Vaughn, in 2015, we watched a video from 2016.

42:07.455 --> 42:13.539
In 2016, on April 1st is when VAX was released and also when ICANN was formed.

42:13.979 --> 42:18.642
And actually the World Mercury Project didn't change its name to CHD until 2018.

42:19.103 --> 42:26.648
And so there's a whole couple years here where Mary Holland is promoted on Democracy Now opposite Paul Offit

42:27.981 --> 42:36.705
as an anti-vaxxer who's worried about a component of the MMR and just wants testing.

42:37.665 --> 42:38.385
Strange, huh?

42:38.665 --> 42:51.491
Sounds like a very familiar message that hasn't gotten Mary Holland to save very many people since October of 2015, seeing as we're now in 2025, which, if you can do the math, is about 10 years later.

42:53.051 --> 42:56.773
I mean, democracy now, 10 years ago, and this is all we got?

43:01.104 --> 43:04.768
And so of course, Brandy had billboards in more than 30 states.

43:04.808 --> 43:15.520
Would it surprise you at all that even before this, that Pauly Tommy had more than 90 billboards in the UK and got to meet with the prime minister?

43:17.903 --> 43:19.024
Would that surprise you at all?

43:23.874 --> 43:33.178
So my statement, to be very clear, is that I suspect that most of these, if not all of these organizations are essentially front groups to waste our time.

43:33.798 --> 43:35.519
They are front groups to waste our money.

43:35.539 --> 43:38.820
You know, front groups to oppose the who.

43:39.080 --> 43:45.103
Front groups to get free speech or a health, big top tent of health freedom.

43:45.523 --> 43:48.344
And none of these are useful organizations.

43:48.384 --> 43:49.664
They are all compromised.

43:49.764 --> 43:53.346
I'm sure of it because they all brought us this and all do not question it.

43:57.082 --> 44:12.354
And so if you want to understand where we are, I think the best way to do it, I think, is to understand that probably Steve Bannon is behind a lot of these people in some way or another, either trading money to fund them or coordinating their work.

44:14.415 --> 44:19.259
giving some, you know, playbills or sharing scripts, distributing scripts.

44:19.359 --> 44:19.739
I don't know.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.884
But this is a Goldman Sachs guy who was one of the first people to declare a lab leak likely.

44:25.964 --> 44:40.475
One of the the guy who gave us Li Min Yan, who toured the United States Christian churches in the South with Ryan Cole and Paul Urso and Karma Doc and Robert Malone.

44:42.882 --> 44:42.962
in 2021.

44:43.142 --> 44:47.184
Steve Bannon is the guy, I think.

44:47.965 --> 44:50.926
And Kevin McKernan is obviously very important.

44:51.006 --> 44:57.309
His father was already into sequencing technologies and microarray stuff, his brother's work on cancer.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.190
And there's just no explanation for this guy's calendar.

45:01.250 --> 45:09.754
From 2020 onward, he's playing their game, singing their song, announcing their questions and manipulating our habits and opinions on social media.

45:11.314 --> 45:23.560
And quite frankly, Bright Weinstein was given a half a million dollars to transition to social media manipulation of opinion and habits, and has been busy with it ever since.

45:23.960 --> 45:35.705
And just keep in mind that I was connected to him by someone named Piper Stover, who for some reason, even though her name has been available since I published my review in 2021, nobody cares about her.

45:37.046 --> 45:39.547
And the fact that she worked in China for 10 years.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.162
and all the things she's connected to.

45:45.004 --> 45:45.785
It's just weird.

45:47.006 --> 45:51.232
They can't investigate anything, but they can post Zillow pictures of my old house.

45:54.542 --> 45:56.703
So I think that all of these people are in on it.

45:56.743 --> 45:59.185
I think that some of them have the whole script.

45:59.265 --> 46:05.969
Some of them just go along because they want fame and fortune, like Julianne Michaels has just been waiting for her call, you know, to get up there.

46:06.049 --> 46:11.592
She got called a year before this or two years before this, and Vincent Radcinello was like an audition.

46:12.113 --> 46:18.957
And then a year later, this Sheckenberger guy from California who's,

46:19.657 --> 46:29.059
one of Brett Weinstein's friends kicks off her podcast and away we go and the latest one was was Brett Weinstein's wife talking about shedding spike not even four days ago.

46:34.221 --> 46:43.923
And so since the beginning of the pandemic, Jessica Rose, Kevin McKernan, Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone, Harvey Rice, they've all been at table meetings, they've all been

46:44.887 --> 46:58.012
at private meetings on different islands and and cruises and whatever where they where they game this stuff out where they decide what parts of the narrative each one of them is going to stick to and they're all basically just a team of epigirls

46:58.763 --> 47:05.647
And if you're not familiar with EpiGirls, I think Jessica Rose is probably the EpiGirl character in this show.

47:05.727 --> 47:08.809
And EpiGirl is a character in the SPARS pandemic document.

47:08.889 --> 47:15.713
SPARS, S-P-A-R-S, is a hypothetical pandemic that occurred between 2025 and 2028.

47:17.994 --> 47:32.750
And in that document produced by the American government and its associates, there's a girl by the name of Epigirl on social media that exposes the vaccine injuries that occurred during the pandemic.

47:34.690 --> 47:38.714
I mean, this is just, this is laughable at this stage, how exposed they are.

47:38.774 --> 47:48.983
These same people have been traveling the world for about three years, because remember, the COVID international COVID summits didn't really start until the murder was almost over in 2021.

47:50.484 --> 47:53.987
The vast majority of the murder is committed really before the end of 2022.

47:54.147 --> 47:57.931
And so really starting the COVID summit in 2021 is kind of a joke.

47:59.997 --> 48:05.281
And in fact, if you realize there were six COVID summits after that, it's like, come on, come on.

48:07.203 --> 48:13.908
And so what I am again stating very clearly is that I believe Edward Bernays had it right, I just don't think he knew how bad it would be in 2025.

48:14.948 --> 48:28.599
I think that Noam Chomsky had it right, although I don't think he had any idea how bad it would be in 2025, so much so that I think actually Noam Chomsky has no idea that he's also fooled.

48:29.417 --> 48:29.957
Maybe he does.

48:30.297 --> 48:30.597
I don't know.

48:31.118 --> 48:33.978
Ever since 9-11, I haven't really listened to Noam Chomsky anymore.

48:33.998 --> 48:37.900
And of course, this quote is not from more recent Noam Chomsky.

48:37.940 --> 48:43.621
This is from old rebel Noam Chomsky, back when he was probably telling mostly the truth.

48:44.742 --> 48:46.642
And so I think these people were put in place.

48:47.282 --> 48:48.963
I think they've coordinated their lying.

48:49.003 --> 48:56.225
And I think only because of my persistence and my, you know, unblemished track record of integrity, can you see it.

48:57.284 --> 49:01.708
If you just take their word for what they said and what they did when they did it, you'll never see it.

49:01.808 --> 49:17.183
But if you actually allow an objective portrayal of what they said when they said it, what you will find is that they have been avoiding saying this for more than five years now, which is there's an anticipated rise in expected deaths.

49:17.984 --> 49:26.010
The population pyramid of America and all Western nations in Europe will show you that it's not a good population pyramid.

49:26.051 --> 49:30.314
We don't have a replacement population coming and we have a little bubble of old people right now.

49:31.315 --> 49:32.836
People that are going to age out.

49:33.797 --> 49:38.661
And all of these people know that that population pyramid signal, like an eclipse,

49:39.676 --> 49:46.400
was taken advantage of and lied about in order to create the illusion of a pandemic using murder and lies.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.301
That's where we are.

49:48.021 --> 49:50.603
And I'm going to demonstrate exactly how they do it.

49:51.523 --> 49:52.304
So, um,

50:09.304 --> 50:19.186
It is with much humility that I remind you, please, if you haven't or you can and haven't really thought about it, please go to gigahomebiological.com and find a way to support this work.

50:19.246 --> 50:25.607
It is really just me, and I am trying my best to make ends meet with a couple other little side jobs.

50:26.667 --> 50:29.928
But as much as I can, I'm trying to produce as many of these shows as possible.

50:29.948 --> 50:34.008
But it does take some research and some time to put all this stuff together.

50:34.309 --> 50:36.269
And so I really appreciate everybody who is

50:37.209 --> 50:38.069
supporting this work.

50:38.609 --> 50:41.570
There's quite a few of you that need to be added to the list of thank yous.

50:42.150 --> 50:46.891
It's really, it's quite overwhelming sometimes how many people show up on any given week.

50:47.991 --> 50:50.872
Again, this is for all the marbles, all the grandchildren of Earth.

50:51.772 --> 51:02.634
I think that's the best way to frame it because you want to understand it from a, on the right time horizon and so the whole point of there being a five-year

51:03.834 --> 51:07.657
pandemic was for this thing to be engaging.

51:08.418 --> 51:11.381
It needed to be something that felt like you figured it out.

51:11.521 --> 51:24.612
It needed to be something where you recalled the argument in front of the Senate three years ago and then added it up to what you just heard on Tucker Carlson and then added it up to what you just heard on Alex Jones.

51:25.053 --> 51:30.598
That's what had to happen in order for there to be this many people this convinced.

51:31.258 --> 51:34.919
It wouldn't be as simple as just leaking the diffuse proposal.

51:34.939 --> 51:39.981
It wouldn't just be as simple as having somebody speculate about it on Bill Maher.

51:40.721 --> 51:52.665
It was required for there to be an active sort of limited spectrum of debate within which there was a very lively debate within that spectrum, right?

51:52.705 --> 51:56.406
That's exactly what Noam Chomsky is explaining there.

51:57.344 --> 52:00.465
So can you explain how this coronavirus?

52:00.985 --> 52:12.208
And so what we saw yesterday or the day whenever I did a show last was that on March 18th, 2020, this guy already knew to start a podcast and this guy was already podcasting.

52:12.248 --> 52:13.168
And who is this guy?

52:13.208 --> 52:21.531
This is the guy who in 2016 has a book with Sky Horse Publishing called The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

52:21.571 --> 52:24.411
You might remember that 2016 is the year that Vaxxed came out.

52:28.233 --> 52:32.977
2016 is the year that ICANN was formed.

52:33.457 --> 52:46.068
2016 was also the video that we watched where Brandy Vaughn was already saying that intramuscular injection is dumb and that all vaccines are stupid because intramuscular injections are dumb.

52:48.342 --> 52:54.366
And so remember, this timeline is very important to understand because this guy got a book deal from Skyhorse.

52:55.027 --> 53:01.291
Skyhorse would then move on to be the publishing partner of CHD a couple years later.

53:02.852 --> 53:06.675
And the title of this book is The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

53:08.136 --> 53:10.778
Is intramuscular injection an environmental cause?

53:14.997 --> 53:24.659
I want you to see this for what it is, because this guy in March, 2020, knew more about the virus than anybody else I could find.

53:25.619 --> 53:30.160
That's why I featured him in a bike ride on JC on a Bike, my YouTube channel.

53:31.581 --> 53:35.802
Because he knew more about the virus than anyone else I could find.

53:39.062 --> 53:41.483
Again, it's hard to understand why.

53:43.632 --> 53:45.514
Hard to understand why.

53:45.574 --> 53:52.841
You know who had a book in 2018 about vaccines and autoimmunity and the changing nature of childhood illness?

53:53.681 --> 53:54.502
Thomas Cowan.

53:55.984 --> 54:02.590
The no-virus guy that I feature in the beginning of this talk that actually also has never mentioned Brandy Vaughn.

54:11.195 --> 54:15.397
So let's listen to this for just a second so you can hear how staged this is.

54:15.497 --> 54:20.899
And you only maybe can see it now in retrospect, but this is ridiculous for him to say in March 18th, 2020.

54:21.339 --> 54:28.763
This is, we've had other coronaviruses before.

54:28.803 --> 54:30.704
We had SARS and we had MERS.

54:31.264 --> 54:35.606
And right now this coronavirus is different than the other coronaviruses.

54:36.443 --> 54:36.984
Absolutely.

54:37.084 --> 54:43.172
So I'm going to be on that topic, I'll be talking about published research and not yet published research.

54:43.232 --> 54:51.143
So in a published research, we know that there are genomic differences at the genome level and important parts of

54:51.403 --> 55:00.347
Now, the important thing to see here is if you just go back in that video a few seconds, what you will notice very clearly is that this dude clicked on his screen.

55:00.407 --> 55:02.387
So he had to go back to the script.

55:02.407 --> 55:04.768
Let's just watch it again so you can see it.

55:04.888 --> 55:07.169
And I know I'm not nuts.

55:07.870 --> 55:08.690
Watch his hands.

55:08.870 --> 55:10.791
Watch his hands.

55:11.011 --> 55:13.612
We've had other coronaviruses before.

55:13.672 --> 55:15.553
We had SARS and we had MERS.

55:16.133 --> 55:20.455
Explain how this coronavirus is different than the other coronaviruses.

55:21.286 --> 55:21.846
Absolutely.

55:21.947 --> 55:27.590
So I'm going to be on that topic, I'll be talking about published research and not yet published.

55:27.631 --> 55:39.759
So he just in a public, he queues up a script and starts talking about things like, you know, GP 140 and, and the fear and cleavage site and the whatever other things that he decides to bring up.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.481
This is not normal.

55:42.561 --> 55:43.722
This is not okay.

55:44.462 --> 55:45.203
This is a traitor.

55:46.186 --> 55:56.892
This is someone who was given a script by some of the same people who were likely meddling with Brandy Vaughn and were responsible for funding all the people that tried to step in front of Brandy before the pandemic.

55:57.773 --> 55:58.894
It's all the same people.

55:59.894 --> 56:02.096
So it's likely all the same money.

56:02.216 --> 56:14.263
It's all the same interests trying to take a movement, which was identified in the UK by Polly and Andrew Wakefield as being actually very politically valuable.

56:17.066 --> 56:19.648
and make it into a populist movement in America.

56:20.469 --> 56:21.690
Hijack it, more or less.

56:23.451 --> 56:24.552
And I think that's what's happened.

56:25.032 --> 56:34.920
I think that the fake populist Steve Bannon and his associates, maybe Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, I don't know,

56:36.144 --> 56:55.380
have collaborated to hijack the conservative right in America as a populist right movement, disguised as an anti-vax health freedom movement, when in reality what they've done is completely bamboozle us for the sake of the same state that everybody else is working for.

56:56.567 --> 57:15.225
whether he knows, he's been on stage at every CHD event I've ever been at, as an expert promoted to the highest place on stage, equal to Susan Humphreys, equal to Bobby Kennedy, equal to Brian Hooker, they're always on stage together.

57:17.588 --> 57:20.571
This is not a mistake, ladies and gentlemen, this is an admission.

57:21.969 --> 57:25.512
And five years in retrospect, this is much more than admission.

57:25.552 --> 57:29.615
This is criminal evidence.

57:30.135 --> 57:37.220
We know that there are genomic differences at the genome level and important parts of important proteins.

57:37.540 --> 57:39.122
There are large differences.

57:39.322 --> 57:48.689
Now, the reason why this is criminal evidence, in my humble opinion, is because, again, the track record seems to belie obfuscation.

57:49.625 --> 57:54.026
It seems to suggest that they heard the right language and they just chose not to say it.

57:55.707 --> 57:57.627
They heard the right language from Brandy Vaughn.

57:59.908 --> 58:07.110
And that's why Brandy Vaughn is on stage with at least four people we now know are probably not good guys.

58:08.430 --> 58:14.112
It is remarkable to see Judy Mikovits and James Lyons-Weiner there.

58:15.832 --> 58:17.213
It is remarkable.

58:17.967 --> 58:33.791
to think that we are in 2025 and none of these people talk about Brandy, none of them have shown you, none of them have shown you that Brandy was on Dateline ABC in Australia.

58:34.272 --> 58:42.514
Now what's interesting about this is that I want you to use your mind to realize how

58:43.817 --> 58:49.519
Australia and New Zealand were used against us during the pandemic and how we were used against them.

58:51.100 --> 58:59.583
During the pandemic in 2020, everybody agreed that something terrible was happening in America because we couldn't get our story straight.

58:59.683 --> 59:02.984
Some people wanted to lock down, other people didn't want to lock down.

59:03.044 --> 59:12.888
And so the virus was spreading like mad, but because New Zealand and Australia had such strict lockdowns, they didn't have the waves of death that we had, the waves of murder.

59:14.949 --> 59:23.352
And so both countries were portrayed as their respective example of what works or doesn't work during the pandemic.

59:23.392 --> 59:34.756
And it would have been very hard if you weren't trying to see how we were used as an example of a failing response, and they were used as an example of a successful response.

59:37.077 --> 59:38.037
But that's how it happened.

59:39.016 --> 59:46.079
murdering people in America was necessary in order to seed the pandemic around the world because there needed to be numbers.

59:49.181 --> 01:00:00.546
And before the pandemic, brandy was used to demonstrate that anti-vax in America was causing a disaster, a measles disaster.

01:00:00.566 --> 01:00:05.609
This is a public health crisis and it is time to sound the alarm and take the appropriate action.

01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:10.406
as the United States battles the worst measles outbreak in decades.

01:00:10.546 --> 01:00:11.947
We're not vaccinating.

01:00:12.007 --> 01:00:13.388
We're not endangering our children.

01:00:13.408 --> 01:00:16.009
There's an information war on vaccination.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:17.510
I get death threats.

01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:20.432
I get death wished upon my child.

01:00:21.392 --> 01:00:26.896
There is a small group of people who are behind this incorrect science.

01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:30.938
Why is one particular community getting the blame?

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:39.122
I came here today to show the world that the majority of Orthodox Jewish people in the United States do get vaccinated.

01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:58.247
An hour outside New York City is a quiet suburban community at the epicenter of a severe measles outbreak.

01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:14.111
Now make no mistake about it, it's not by accident that we're now talking about measles again with Robert F. Kennedy in the spotlight about Samoa and all this other stuff because this debate was set up.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:22.594
Part of the effectiveness of a limited spectrum of debate is that it's historically set up on a time horizon that you can't really see.

01:01:23.074 --> 01:01:25.835
So it feels real because Mary Holland and

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:32.200
Paul Offit were opposing each other 10 years ago, so it makes sense that these are the same people that are fighting now.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:39.866
I think that people have gotten so carried away that they're not even thinking rationally anymore.

01:01:48.058 --> 01:02:01.305
One of the things that causes the angst, the anguish, the anger in our community, among many people such as myself, is that the world is getting a skewed picture of what Orthodox Jews believe.

01:02:02.105 --> 01:02:11.690
Because there are some nincompoops, unfortunately, that are uneducated and believe that shots are dangerous, or they're harmful, or they cause

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.372
disease more than they cure or they prevent diseases.

01:02:15.913 --> 01:02:19.535
There's an old expression that for every two Jews are three opinions.

01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:28.541
Martus is talking about the growing anti-vax movement within his community.

01:02:31.403 --> 01:02:37.267
Only 77% of children in Rockland County have had the measles vaccine, known as MMR.

01:02:39.286 --> 01:02:46.410
and in a desperate attempt to control the spread of the disease, around 6,000 unvaccinated kids were pulled out of school.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:53.613
Most of them are ultra-Orthodox Jews, a community rooted in traditional beliefs.

01:02:54.073 --> 01:02:56.074
They're less connected to popular culture.

01:02:56.114 --> 01:02:57.495
That would be the best way of saying it.

01:02:57.995 --> 01:03:02.458
Preserving the old ways and staying exactly, staying as close to the Torah as possible.

01:03:02.518 --> 01:03:07.280
Now, Hasidim would never go to a movie theater, but they're never supposed to.

01:03:11.337 --> 01:03:12.097
Thanks for coming out.

01:03:12.217 --> 01:03:14.298
A movie theater is where things would spread, of course.

01:03:14.338 --> 01:03:22.162
So far this year, there have been over 1,100 reported cases across the US and 296 in Rockland County alone.

01:03:22.822 --> 01:03:24.943
That's no deaths, I just hear cases.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:29.605
Measles is an incredibly contagious disease.

01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:30.925
Incredibly contagious.

01:03:30.945 --> 01:03:37.268
You can catch it through droplets in the air or by touching infected surfaces where the virus can live for up to two hours.

01:03:38.843 --> 01:03:46.026
In extreme cases, the symptoms of fevers and red spots... I mean, even using the word live for two hours is already mythology, right?

01:03:46.066 --> 01:03:46.986
That's how you hear it.

01:03:47.787 --> 01:03:51.708
...can be followed by pneumonia and encephalitis, which can lead to death.

01:03:52.188 --> 01:03:56.070
And pneumonia and encephalitis are both bacterial, you know, so that's also weird.

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:56.830
It's just weird.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:02.632
But the real story of a vaccine is told in the fears and smiles of a little girl.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:06.674
In the 1960s, a vaccine became... Listen to this music.

01:04:07.782 --> 01:04:09.644
leading to a breakthrough in the year 2000.

01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:15.688
CDC reports the measles practically wiped out tonight in the United States.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:20.852
In just under 20 years, measles has made a comeback.

01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:22.714
In the U.S.

01:04:22.874 --> 01:04:34.143
over the last decade, the virus has spread amongst tight-knit communities where immunization rates are low, like 383 cases in an Amish community in Ohio in 2014.

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:43.042
Around 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to stop the spread of measles.

01:04:43.763 --> 01:04:51.309
It's called herd immunity, and it protects those who can't be immunized, like newborn babies and cancer patients.

01:04:51.509 --> 01:04:54.471
Newborn babies can't be vaccinated?

01:04:54.551 --> 01:04:55.452
Wow, that's weird.

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:57.994
I thought that they could, at least to hep B, you know.

01:04:58.014 --> 01:05:03.919
World Health Organization now lists vaccine hesitancy a top 10 threat to global health.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.402
The World Health Organization's opinions matter.

01:05:09.207 --> 01:05:11.349
Anti-vaccination movement is growing.

01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:16.113
This anti-vax movement has proven to be very dangerous.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.496
The anti-vaxxers are putting their kids lives at risk.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:21.637
There's an information war.

01:05:21.697 --> 01:05:32.246
Don't forget in December 19, Sam Harris will go on Brett Weinstein's podcast to say that when the next pandemic comes, we won't be able to tolerate this anti-vax shit anymore.

01:05:33.168 --> 01:05:36.129
This is all one timeline on one planet.

01:05:36.449 --> 01:05:39.090
Don't forget, one country, actually, America.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:43.491
Or across the US, as the anti-vaxxers take on mainstream medicine.

01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:47.292
Okay, can you carry this bag for me?

01:05:47.532 --> 01:05:50.693
I'm so happy!

01:05:52.193 --> 01:05:54.354
Hey, normal face.

01:05:54.374 --> 01:05:54.674
Look at me.

01:05:54.974 --> 01:05:55.374
Normal face.

01:05:56.593 --> 01:06:01.841
In California, I meet Brandy, an ex-pharmaceutical sales rep turned anti-vaxxer.

01:06:02.502 --> 01:06:07.189
She believes harm caused by vaccines is the most pressing health issue of our time.

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:15.199
I started Learn the Risk after working in the pharmaceutical industry for Merck and selling a product that was killing people.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:21.261
The name of the drug was Vioxx and I saw how everything went down.

01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:22.741
Looks like a great house.

01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:26.062
She looks like she's making a crap ton of money being an anti-vaxxer.

01:06:26.102 --> 01:06:27.743
She looks rich and famous.

01:06:27.823 --> 01:06:28.283
It's awesome.

01:06:28.303 --> 01:06:29.083
From the inside.

01:06:31.877 --> 01:06:37.504
Vioxx was an arthritis drug that allegedly caused 140,000 heart attacks.

01:06:38.566 --> 01:06:47.578
It cost Merck nearly 7 billion Australian dollars in damages and has left Brandy questioning the integrity of the pharmaceutical industry.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:54.991
I speak about the dangers and the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, medical products, and vaccines.

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:58.173
And this is the information that people need to know.

01:06:58.773 --> 01:07:12.900
But since the pharmaceutical industry is one of the leading advertisers on media, television, print media, radio, they don't get the right information on the side effects and the real dangers of all pharmaceutical products, including vaccines.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:20.848
Brandy says a healthy immune system is the best defense rather than vaccines like MMR.

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:24.931
But voicing these opinions comes at a cost.

01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:26.712
I get death threats.

01:07:27.393 --> 01:07:30.996
I get death wished upon my child.

01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:34.999
I get accused of child abuse when my child is far, far healthier than his peers.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.521
And, you know, it just never stops.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:46.963
It's a barrage of attacks from both the pharmaceutical industry, from the public, from the media.

01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:50.184
It's not easy.

01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:51.725
How does that make you feel?

01:07:54.005 --> 01:08:10.330
You know, as much as it's a challenge on a daily basis, it doesn't distract me from the main purpose, because I feel like this is the reason I was put on the earth, and this is my mission, and the children are counting on me.

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:16.532
Brandy is rallying vaccine sceptics in California to tackle a proposed new law.

01:08:17.652 --> 01:08:23.554
The government wants to make it harder for people to get exemptions from mandatory vaccination based on their medical condition.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.561
They're trying to mandate vaccines, and it's all about profit, not health.

01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:36.263
So, vaccines have a longer patent life, they don't have liability, and they don't go through the rigorous safety testing.

01:08:36.963 --> 01:08:43.005
If you don't like the truth, if you want to softball or sugarcoat things, you should probably leave the event now.

01:08:48.413 --> 01:08:54.855
If you want a big top tent for health freedom, you better leave the event right now is how I would currently frame it.

01:08:55.015 --> 01:08:59.917
Because that's really what CHD drops the ball on since I've known them.

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:05.559
They opt for the big top tent of health freedom and taking a stand on nothing.

01:09:06.519 --> 01:09:13.384
and having banners that they throw in the garbage after their conferences, so much so that I could take one home.

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:20.170
And it says, rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear, committed to nothing.

01:09:21.601 --> 01:09:25.722
And Brandy, if you want something sugarcoated, you better get out of here now.

01:09:25.802 --> 01:09:27.242
That's how I kind of feel too.

01:09:27.762 --> 01:09:37.404
If you want this story sugarcoated about who these people are and how malevolent they are, it's time to leave the stream right now because it's about to get really ugly.

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:50.886
Because actually, if we just do the timeline here, you know, the 24th of September was where she was featured on the news in America having billboards.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:02.168
And on the 19th of September, just a couple weeks after this dateline Australia, you can hear her say it very clearly.

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:03.590
Whoops.

01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:05.451
My bad.

01:10:06.052 --> 01:10:06.612
What happened there?

01:10:07.774 --> 01:10:08.434
I have to click on it.

01:10:08.915 --> 01:10:09.836
Cannot play media.

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:11.597
Oh, then I have to escape and start again.

01:10:13.241 --> 01:10:14.803
Sometimes I just run out of room.

01:10:15.363 --> 01:10:15.903
All at once.

01:10:16.244 --> 01:10:16.644
Here it is.

01:10:17.365 --> 01:10:33.698
And so now I'm going to turn the camera and I'm going to introduce you to a woman that I met and I met her because she came up at the Q&A and she said, mentioned that her 11 year old had started having seizures after just one shot and before that he was completely unvaccinated.

01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:45.333
And the reason I wanted to share her story is because so many times lately with the new law in California and all of this, I hear so many parents saying, well, like nonstop.

01:10:46.595 --> 01:10:47.176
That's mine.

01:10:47.436 --> 01:10:48.077
Yeah.

01:10:48.097 --> 01:10:48.137
Um,

01:10:49.369 --> 01:10:49.929
Isn't he cute?

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.912
Anyway, I see your parents.

01:10:53.952 --> 01:10:59.875
He hasn't seen me much today, so he's sticking close by.

01:11:00.435 --> 01:11:04.938
Anyway, I hear a lot of parents say, well, my children only need one more shot.

01:11:05.258 --> 01:11:08.520
Or what if we did a selective schedule or delayed?

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.282
And people ask me about that all the time.

01:11:12.322 --> 01:11:16.285
And I tell them, point blank, that I could never

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:20.667
One of the people that CHD has done a book with recently, Mr. Paul Thomas, Dr.

01:11:20.707 --> 01:11:22.208
M.D., is an advocate for a slightly altered schedule.

01:11:42.059 --> 01:11:51.862
There's a video of him at the beginning of 2016 saying that he's really excited about RFK being chosen as advisor for the new Trump president in 2017.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:57.963
It's remarkable what these people and how long they've been entangled in this little mess.

01:11:59.244 --> 01:12:04.805
Here she is stating it plainly that I could never recommend anybody to take any shot because I just wouldn't.

01:12:05.445 --> 01:12:08.406
I have too many examples of single events.

01:12:10.615 --> 01:12:13.636
where what they wish they could go back and not give them that shot.

01:12:14.016 --> 01:12:20.557
Grandma, massive seizures after just one shot of DTAP at 11 and he had no previous vaccine.

01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:27.899
So you really never know when that last shot or that one shot is gonna have a serious effect on you or your children.

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:34.660
And the reason why is because intramuscular injection is in fact Russian roulette.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:54.528
Some of the reason it is Russian roulette is because of this mechanism that Marc Giraudeau was shouting from the rooftops in Panda and all over the place a couple years ago about how bolus injection and how they talking about you have to, you have to retract the needle a little bit to aspirate it to see if you're in a blood vessel.

01:12:54.588 --> 01:12:59.711
Yeah, that could be an additional way the damage is done.

01:13:01.155 --> 01:13:13.263
But it really actually is an admission that there is a time frame that if you do intramuscular injection correctly, it will be a very slow release of this combination of toxins and biologics.

01:13:14.543 --> 01:13:20.167
With untold numbers of consequences over an uncalculable time frame.

01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:28.412
Because we don't know how long it's there, because you've already bypassed the normal means by which the body would protect itself from these things.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:37.313
that include the toxic adjuvants that are in there as part of a medicine, a pharmaceutical that is injected as opposed to swallowed.

01:13:43.315 --> 01:13:49.057
And so I'm gonna keep hammering as other people I think will keep hammering on Brandy because Brandy really brings it home.

01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:55.239
Now, what if Pauly Tommy also had a video before Brandy died

01:13:56.004 --> 01:14:09.792
where she said, basically, they were trying to get us to focus on the MMR or a component of the MMR or Andrew Wakefield, instead of realizing that the truth is in the unvaccinated kids.

01:14:10.193 --> 01:14:11.573
Wouldn't that be weird?

01:14:12.154 --> 01:14:15.816
If there was a video from 2019, where Polly said that?

01:14:18.578 --> 01:14:25.522
Well, make no mistake that the other side, without a doubt, do not want

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.503
the public, the people, the parents, to hear the stories of the unvaccinated.

01:14:30.523 --> 01:14:35.386
They want us to talk about MMR, autism, Andrew Wakefield.

01:14:35.406 --> 01:14:39.649
They want that to go down the same path every single time because they can attack us.

01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:44.673
But you cannot attack the generations and generations

01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:47.232
of the health of the unvaccinated.

01:14:47.992 --> 01:14:59.983
Vax2 does mean- If you knew this truth, and then you realized that they were going to roll out an intramuscular injection and try to coerce everyone on earth into taking it, what would your message be?

01:15:01.524 --> 01:15:13.054
If you knew this truth from more than a decade of fighting, because this woman has been fighting for, up to 2019, she's been fighting for almost two decades.

01:15:15.822 --> 01:15:21.608
She's had books, multiple movies, over a hundred billboards.

01:15:22.469 --> 01:15:25.472
She's met the prime minister all before this.

01:15:27.494 --> 01:15:30.758
Years and years and years and years before this.

01:15:31.158 --> 01:15:35.283
Her daughter was an autism advocate in the UK.

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.717
So they've had a long time to get this message out.

01:15:42.817 --> 01:15:58.135
And so after all this time, in 2019, she is saying that they are just trying to make you about MMR and Andrew Wakefield and autism and not talk about the unvaccinated kids and their health and they're exceptional.

01:15:59.837 --> 01:16:00.738
Interesting, isn't it?

01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:11.998
Because that's nowhere part of the newly formed CHD that was only formed about a year before this when the World Mercury Project changed its name.

01:16:17.263 --> 01:16:20.206
Even begin to cover the health of the unvaccinated.

01:16:20.286 --> 01:16:21.767
We uncovered so much.

01:16:22.247 --> 01:16:28.413
We uncovered generations and generations standing there saying, we've never had any cancer in our family.

01:16:28.897 --> 01:16:31.539
We've never had rheumatoid arthritis in our family.

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:32.940
We've never had diabetes.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.405
We've never had any of these things that you see that are just common elderly conditions.

01:16:38.945 --> 01:16:41.788
They don't have them in their families.

01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:51.556
And as we went deeper and deeper into the world of the unvaccinated, I could see, the team could see, this is why they don't do the vaccine back study.

01:16:52.036 --> 01:16:53.097
This is why

01:16:53.601 --> 01:16:55.242
They're trying to censor us and stuff.

01:16:55.482 --> 01:17:05.427
If you knew this truth, and I do know it now, why is your message not the vaccine schedule in America is criminal?

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:10.710
Why isn't your message that intramuscular injection is dumb?

01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:16.973
Why aren't we trying to score this touchdown and never vaccinate another kid again?

01:17:20.299 --> 01:17:23.441
It's hard to explain it any other way than she was co-opted.

01:17:25.382 --> 01:17:30.244
Somehow or another, after the death of Brandy Vaughn, this message disappears.

01:17:30.384 --> 01:17:32.005
Brandy's message disappears.

01:17:32.085 --> 01:17:45.432
The succinct, coherent, dead-on-balls-accurate messaging disappears, and we pivot to a pig-top tent for health freedom with Mary Holland,

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:50.805
and Polly Tommy doing podcasts for CHD.

01:17:59.351 --> 01:18:11.400
The same people that were in this photograph, James Lyons Weiler, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Judy Mikovits.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.481
Why is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:18:15.032 --> 01:18:19.157
April 16th, 2020 doing this.

01:18:19.317 --> 01:18:21.239
What is happening in this video?

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.103
Please tell me what's happening in this video.

01:18:48.001 --> 01:18:49.824
Please tell me what's happening in this video.

01:18:51.606 --> 01:18:59.917
How is it possible that on April 16th of 2020, we are going to sit down in the house of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:04.604
and he is going to tell us her story?

01:19:06.152 --> 01:19:09.335
How in the nine hells is that possible?

01:19:09.355 --> 01:19:09.736
Sorry, it's May.

01:19:09.756 --> 01:19:10.457
It's May, I gotta change that.

01:19:28.849 --> 01:19:47.497
I want to start just by asking Mr. Kennedy, you recently wrote the introduction to Judy's book, Plague of Corruption, and in that you placed her in a long line of dissident scientists from Rachel Carson, who discovered the dangers of DDT, to Alice Stewart, who found that x-rays during pregnancy led to carcinomas in children later on.

01:19:47.837 --> 01:19:50.898
Researchers who were at first scorned and later hailed as heroes.

01:19:51.138 --> 01:19:55.420
What makes Judy a dissident in this tradition, and what is the Semmelweis effect?

01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:16.980
Well, the Semmelweis effect is that dynamic that you described where a predominant medical orthodoxies are safeguarded ideologically and kind of a knee-jerk reaction by the medical community.

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:29.962
And particularly the doctors and the medical cartel and the medical community had to go immediately into a defense posture.

01:20:31.072 --> 01:20:44.200
to defend things like x-raying pregnant women, even long after the establishment between that procedure and cancers in those children as well established.

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:46.261
The same thing happened with thalidomide.

01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:56.167
The same thing happened with calomel, which was a mercury-based tooth powder that was used for a hundred years and was finally terminated in the 1950s.

01:20:56.347 --> 01:20:59.889
It was causing these devastating illnesses in children.

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:17.383
DDT was another thing that the American Medical Association, because it had recommended DDT for the suppression of malaria, it was the last group to really, to be willing to back off and say, yeah, there is a problem here.

01:21:17.884 --> 01:21:20.906
Even when the science was well, well established.

01:21:22.167 --> 01:21:27.232
Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian doctor

01:21:28.322 --> 01:21:40.761
at a time when more than half of the women who went to hospitals were dying for childbirth, were dying of peripheral fever, which was also known as birth bed fever.

01:21:43.516 --> 01:22:10.029
He had an idea, this was before Pasteur, before germ theory, before anybody knew about germs, but he had an idea from his own anecdotal observations that the scientists who were the doctors, who were the same doctors who were performing autopsies, that they were not cleaning their hands between the autopsies and delivering babies, and that they were bringing some kind of toxic particle

01:22:11.335 --> 01:22:12.816
into the birthing rooms.

01:22:13.476 --> 01:22:16.798
And he did an experiment where he got them to wash their hands.

01:22:17.879 --> 01:22:24.922
And he dropped birthbed fever from around 50% mortalities from around 50% to around 2% of the women who came to the hospitals.

01:22:24.942 --> 01:22:28.384
When he published on that, at first he was applauded.

01:22:29.485 --> 01:22:32.046
But then suddenly he was derided.

01:22:32.106 --> 01:22:37.009
And ultimately he was tricked into going into a mental institution and apparently murdered.

01:22:38.214 --> 01:22:55.360
And the medical associations at that time went against him with a vengeance, because it challenged their- He is telling this story under the pretense that very similar to this guy, Judy is a hero.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.502
This is where, this is something serious, serious here.

01:23:00.562 --> 01:23:01.642
This is really something.

01:23:01.782 --> 01:23:05.984
Their kind of deified position as physicians

01:23:07.133 --> 01:23:13.298
by saying something that you're doing instead of helping patients is actually hurting them.

01:23:14.539 --> 01:23:21.886
And that's part of the reason that we see this enormous reaction to any kind of criticism of vaccines.

01:23:23.107 --> 01:23:34.537
And of course, Judy's science was a devastating blow to them because what Judy discovered, among many other things,

01:23:35.899 --> 01:23:43.683
What Judy discovered was that there was a virus that had been grown on mouse brain tissue.

01:23:44.143 --> 01:23:52.928
When you grow a vaccine, when you're making a vaccine, you grow them on animal tissues, on cocker spaniels, on... On cocker spaniels?

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:58.310
On mice, on pangolins, on bats.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:59.771
On pangolins?

01:24:00.451 --> 01:24:01.352
On bats?

01:24:02.839 --> 01:24:04.040
Are you kidding me?

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.481
Did he just say that?

01:24:08.181 --> 01:24:11.823
While Judy Mikovits sits quietly at the table of his house?

01:24:13.343 --> 01:24:14.384
Holy shit.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:15.704
What?

01:24:16.865 --> 01:24:18.185
You gotta be kidding me.

01:24:19.606 --> 01:24:26.229
On horses and on insects and on humanified position as physicians,

01:24:27.355 --> 01:24:33.520
by saying something that you're doing instead of helping patients is actually hurting them.

01:24:34.761 --> 01:24:42.106
And that's part of the reason that we see this enormous reaction to any kind of criticism of vaccines.

01:24:43.327 --> 01:24:54.756
And of course, Judy's science was a devastating blow to them because what Judy discovered among many other things,

01:24:56.141 --> 01:25:03.687
What Judy discovered was that there was a virus that had been grown on mouse brain tissue.

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:21.000
When you grow a vaccine... When you listen to what he says right now, when you grow a vaccine, you grow it on, and he lists things that are involved in the pandemic, you can hear that the script is not done yet.

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:28.872
The script was going to be, and I heard it very early in the pandemic, that it was a vaccine candidate.

01:25:28.992 --> 01:25:34.180
It was a self-replicating vaccine for HIV that got out of the lab.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:38.265
And it was an HIV vaccine that was based on coronavirus.

01:25:40.256 --> 01:25:41.577
And what is he doing right now?

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:56.724
With Judy Mikovits at the table in 2020, he is seeding a narrative that he's been given about the idea that, well, when you make vaccines, you grow them in all kinds of stuff, like cocker spaniels and pangolins and bats.

01:26:01.446 --> 01:26:05.408
What I need you to see, ladies and gentlemen, is this book was teed up already in 2020.

01:26:05.748 --> 01:26:07.209
They already knew what they were going to do.

01:26:09.329 --> 01:26:10.770
They already knew what they were going to do.

01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:12.732
They already knew how they were going to do it.

01:26:12.772 --> 01:26:18.456
They were going to fool us into solving a mystery and all of these anti-vax people were going to be part of it.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.943
Listen carefully because there is no mistaking this.

01:26:27.023 --> 01:26:28.284
This is impossible.

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:34.870
Why would he list all of these animals instead of saying fetal cell lines?

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.900
or saying 06 cells.

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.881
Why would he say these things?

01:26:42.241 --> 01:26:42.681
Ha ha!

01:26:43.121 --> 01:26:43.561
Ha ha!

01:26:44.422 --> 01:26:59.865
You're making a vaccine, you grow them on animal tissues, on cocker spaniels, on mice, on pangolins, on bats, on horses, and on insects, and on human lung tissue from aborted fetuses.

01:26:59.945 --> 01:27:03.886
And that's how vaccines are made, most vaccines, or many vaccines.

01:27:05.317 --> 01:27:10.659
and Judy discovered a virus where she was assigned to work for the law.

01:27:10.679 --> 01:27:14.020
Keep in mind that she has not said a word yet.

01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:33.787
The son of Robert F. Kennedy, the guy whose Department of Justice presided over the creation of the FDA with Brett Weinstein's father, this guy is now explaining the history of Judy Mikovits.

01:27:36.155 --> 01:27:36.815
It's pretty awesome.

01:27:38.556 --> 01:27:40.656
The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome.

01:27:41.497 --> 01:27:53.320
Chronic fatigue syndrome was a devastating illness that appeared in an epidemic form in the 1980s and it affected mainly women and the medical community behaved reprehensibly.

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:58.216
They dismissed the disease as a psychosomatic illness.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:03.941
It was at a time when women were first entering the job force, high positions in corporations.

01:28:05.122 --> 01:28:16.212
And they said, this illness is because women are not biologically equipped to handle that kind of responsibility that was traditionally belonged to men, was a province of men.

01:28:17.553 --> 01:28:21.256
and that that's why they're getting these psychosomatic breakdowns.

01:28:21.616 --> 01:28:32.804
And what Judy found when she actually started studying the disease for NIH was that the women who complained of chronic fatigue syndrome had been diagnosed.

01:28:32.824 --> 01:28:36.607
63% of them had a virus.

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:45.153
So this is basically stupid, complicated explanation for how intramuscular injection is generally dumb, especially if you're going to do all kinds of biologics and stuff.

01:28:47.807 --> 01:28:51.751
It's a stupid, complicated explanation that gets nobody out.

01:28:53.693 --> 01:28:54.634
It saves no one.

01:28:55.735 --> 01:29:06.225
And in 2020, a year after that photo was made, and about five months before Brandy's going to die.

01:29:06.245 --> 01:29:07.867
Hmm.

01:29:10.236 --> 01:29:15.339
And she was able to find and identify and isolate, that was called the XMRV virus.

01:29:15.359 --> 01:29:22.464
She isolated a virus that she also advocated to vaccinate against so that that would make the vaccine schedule safe.

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:33.671
Her argument was that if we first vaccinated everybody against XMRV, then we could use the contaminated vaccines and it wouldn't matter because we'd already have immunity to XMRV.

01:29:34.132 --> 01:29:35.413
I shit you not.

01:29:37.014 --> 01:29:38.595
We watched that video on this show.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:40.936
I'm trying to isolate.

01:29:42.857 --> 01:29:45.198
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, right here.

01:29:45.458 --> 01:29:47.859
And how many of these heroes have mentioned Brandy?

01:29:47.899 --> 01:29:57.724
How many of these heroes have been able to say anything remotely as succinctly as pre-pandemic Polly or Brandy Vaughn?

01:29:57.984 --> 01:29:59.445
Apparently nobody can say it.

01:30:00.845 --> 01:30:03.266
But everyone has a timeline, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:03.707 --> 01:30:05.027
Everyone has a timeline.

01:30:05.107 --> 01:30:05.948
I have a timeline.

01:30:05.988 --> 01:30:07.969
I met the drastic people in February of 2020.

01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:16.553
I have a timeline where I started speaking out about transfection at a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine faculty meeting.

01:30:16.673 --> 01:30:23.155
And in fact, the only person I know of who spoke out about transfection in 2020 at a U.S.

01:30:23.215 --> 01:30:25.696
medical school and was told not to come back.

01:30:28.438 --> 01:30:38.602
And about a month after that, I met this lady named Piper Stover who delayed my production of the review that said stop all transfection until May.

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:51.864
And at that time I was introduced to Brett Weinstein, Heather Haying, and Alexandros Marinos, and Chris Martinson, and Jumi Kim, and Matthew Crawford of Rounding the Earth, all who have ended up being more or less traitors.

01:30:52.544 --> 01:31:04.747
Meddlers who knew everything in this signal chat that I was telling them, including transfection is bad, that the PCR is on a hot background so it's bullshit, and so the entire pandemic is a fraud.

01:31:05.467 --> 01:31:08.888
in order to get us to accept transfection as a successful vaccine.

01:31:09.348 --> 01:31:12.409
They knew that in 2021, because I told them.

01:31:13.650 --> 01:31:15.951
And I have the signal chat messages to prove it.

01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:17.291
I have all of the receipts.

01:31:19.252 --> 01:31:21.112
University of Pittsburgh has all the receipts.

01:31:22.273 --> 01:31:25.394
Drastic, as a chat group, has all the receipts.

01:31:26.054 --> 01:31:34.797
The splitting of Drastic into two groups happened because of me saying that we had to start talking about transfection and screw the origin of the virus.

01:31:38.806 --> 01:31:43.969
So then during December of 2021, Kevin McKernan was on my stream.

01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:57.576
And then about a week and a half later, Charles Rixey came to Pittsburgh to do a stream with me that a couple months later would be told to me by Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the reason why they wanted to hire me.

01:31:57.616 --> 01:31:59.958
And then I worked for CHD for about a year and a half.

01:32:00.945 --> 01:32:03.606
And at the end of that, the book was released.

01:32:03.646 --> 01:32:13.148
And I spent about a year during the finalizing of the book, trying to get people to realize that if you understand infectious clones, then you understand that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:32:13.188 --> 01:32:16.309
And we're kind of not writing the book right, but it didn't happen.

01:32:16.989 --> 01:32:17.929
I ended up getting fired.

01:32:19.509 --> 01:32:21.850
That's my story in a nutshell.

01:32:25.376 --> 01:32:32.379
And so what I'm suggesting to you is that a timeline for any of these people would reveal their malevolence.

01:32:32.859 --> 01:32:47.026
And in such a ridiculous list of happy little accidents that it would be almost vanishingly unlikely that it's due to just sheer incompetence.

01:32:47.066 --> 01:32:49.687
It almost has to be on purpose, but let's just go

01:32:50.785 --> 01:33:01.773
with the pretense from now on that all of these coincidences across these last five or these last 10 years are just happy little accidents.

01:33:03.054 --> 01:33:13.102
And those happy little accidents have resulted in an illusion where we've all engaged in trying to stop something that doesn't need to be stopped.

01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:22.983
and that these people engaged in a theater that made us believe that we were contributing to stopping the train to helping it start again.

01:33:24.364 --> 01:33:30.528
This is the best way to think about Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:30.868 --> 01:33:40.034
and Judy Mikovits and James Lyons Weiler relative to what they did with Brandy because Brandy walked into this subway station

01:33:40.974 --> 01:33:44.537
and saw Judy Mikovits and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:44.857 --> 01:33:57.166
and James Lyons Weiler and all of these people pretending to fight against the vaccine schedule to try and slow it down, to give people choice, to give people free, to give people informed consent.

01:33:57.346 --> 01:33:59.167
And then they said, Brandy, come help us.

01:33:59.788 --> 01:34:01.129
We got this movie we're making.

01:34:01.169 --> 01:34:01.749
It's vaxxed.

01:34:01.829 --> 01:34:02.450
Come help us.

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:08.427
And she started stopping the train with him and pushing to start again.

01:34:08.887 --> 01:34:15.410
And for a while she felt like she was participating, but then she started to say, hey guys, I mean, we're kind of wasting our time here.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:18.191
Maybe we should just tell people not to get on the train at all.

01:34:20.752 --> 01:34:28.676
And that's when those people started ignoring her and kept going, well, we've got to stop this train or it won't stop.

01:34:28.776 --> 01:34:29.816
No, I don't think you need to.

01:34:29.856 --> 01:34:32.157
I don't think we just need to tell people not to get on the train.

01:34:32.197 --> 01:34:32.517
No, no.

01:34:32.977 --> 01:34:34.038
They kept doing it.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:43.724
For years, they kept stopping this train even after Brandy said, no, we could just tell people not to get on the train and then we wouldn't need to do this anymore.

01:34:46.226 --> 01:34:46.626
Do you see?

01:34:47.667 --> 01:34:58.573
Because the same thing was done to me several times over the course of the pandemic where I was given another set of these people that I should try to convince them of what I thought.

01:34:58.633 --> 01:35:02.475
Maybe if I just convince Brett Weinstein and his signal chat

01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:19.777
then everything will be okay and we'll finally make some progress oh no maybe if i convince the writing the writing crew of the wuhan cover-up then maybe we'll be okay oh no maybe if i'm a staff scientist at chd and i convince the internal staff of chd then maybe we'll finally make progress oh no no no no no

01:35:20.879 --> 01:35:21.819
That's not how it works.

01:35:21.879 --> 01:35:27.241
It's just a bunch of happy little accidents that happen where no progress is actually made.

01:35:27.281 --> 01:35:29.542
And that's what you see with Brett Weinstein.

01:35:29.582 --> 01:35:38.865
It's a happy little accident in 2017 where he just sues a college for a half, $2 million and gets a half a million.

01:35:39.605 --> 01:35:45.968
It's just a happy coincidence that he's on Rogan saying all of these things that are exactly what the narrative needs.

01:35:46.368 --> 01:35:49.029
It's just a happy coincidence that after

01:35:50.109 --> 01:36:17.508
over five years of following me, three times admitting on his own program that he listens to me and that learned biology from me, although I think I thought of this myself as well, on my own, while he's promoted people like Aseem Malhotra, while he's been in front of the Senate and also in Romania with none other than Steve Hatfill on stage.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.184
I don't think it's ominous, is any discussion of mRNA being used.

01:36:23.364 --> 01:36:35.514
There is no way to explain the language that they are using in this current video, given the fact that what I just told you, that in 2021 he was in a signal chat with me and he knew everything.

01:36:36.234 --> 01:36:45.401
Because I could say everything about the PCR, everything about virology, and everything about the transfection and how it was being misled about it.

01:36:45.482 --> 01:36:45.742
All of it.

01:36:49.995 --> 01:37:07.680
all of it and now listen to what him and his wife said a couple days ago just for things like cancer or bird flu uh you know within either the you know american uh body politic or more globally

01:37:08.649 --> 01:37:08.889
Yes.

01:37:08.949 --> 01:37:29.340
And actually, since you mentioned it, this is a great place to remind people of what you and I, you know, the, the hard one insight that we have over this is that a lot of ink has been spilled over the spike protein and the spike protein is a problem in and of itself to be sure, but

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:36.787
The spike protein is a problem in and of itself, and it is not, but it is, as I've told you for five years, the illusion.

01:37:36.847 --> 01:37:46.036
They want you to believe that it's a toxic protein so that you don't blame transfection as a generally bad idea for healthy people.

01:37:46.876 --> 01:37:52.582
And now what Brett is going to do is to try and dilute and titrate that idea to the point of uselessness.

01:37:52.662 --> 01:37:53.503
Listen carefully.

01:37:54.946 --> 01:38:05.350
The lion's share of the harm that seems to come from the mRNA shots is the platform itself, not the payload.

01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:09.092
And because of that, this should be dead on arrival.

01:38:09.512 --> 01:38:19.716
When we are told, this should be dead on arrival is something that Brett could have said before any college kid took the shot, but he did not.

01:38:21.897 --> 01:38:24.698
I know he could have said it because I was trying to get him to say it.

01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:31.379
because I was saying it at a US medical school before I ever met him.

01:38:31.919 --> 01:38:33.599
And I in fact lost my job.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:45.462
A 20 year career that you can find on PubMed ended because I insisted that people at a medical school ought to be calling it a transfection, not an investigational vaccine.

01:38:46.102 --> 01:38:54.524
And they asked me not to come in anymore and to turn in my badge and keys and paid my contract out for another 10 months without a word.

01:38:57.777 --> 01:39:05.488
I think because I was being used by the national security state to set me up to be a lab leak whistleblower of some kind.

01:39:08.513 --> 01:39:09.114
It's possible.

01:39:10.222 --> 01:39:32.106
It sure feels a lot more likely now that I realize when Piper Stover came into my life, when and who brought Brett Weinstein into my life, how long this clock has been running and how long I've had it right and then been confused and then been right again and then confused and then come right back to right again while all of these people have been running around in circles driving motorcycles in a metal sphere.

01:39:35.034 --> 01:39:46.282
bird flu might be addressed with mRNA, the answer is, well, how the hell are you going to do that without causing myocarditis and a bunch of other pathologies that are the result of the immune system attacking your own tissues?

01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:50.365
You still don't have an answer to that question because we know what an answer would look like.

01:39:50.625 --> 01:39:51.286
It would look like

01:39:52.026 --> 01:40:10.633
basically an addressing system that sent the mRNA to specific tissues that... He's still talking about ways to fix the methodology if we had an addressing system that could send it to tissues that are okay to destroy is the biggest bullshit nonsense statement he's ever made in the history of the pandemic.

01:40:11.073 --> 01:40:15.175
And he is exactly revealing that he's doing nothing but following a script.

01:40:16.556 --> 01:40:21.898
If he actually could understand these ideas, he would know how ridiculous what he's saying is.

01:40:22.658 --> 01:40:34.882
And how incongruent it is with the foundational conclusion that you can't express foreign proteins using transfection in a healthy mammal and expect the immune system to just go on.

01:40:37.253 --> 01:40:40.075
not have catastrophic consequences.

01:40:40.095 --> 01:40:50.884
We're effectively okay to be destroyed, but it has to be an addressing system that's good enough to prevent it from getting into your heart, or the whole thing is, you know, the idea is DOA.

01:40:51.204 --> 01:40:53.506
So as long as it doesn't go to your heart, it's okay.

01:40:53.546 --> 01:40:54.346
Do you see?

01:40:55.587 --> 01:40:56.768
Listen to the language.

01:40:57.549 --> 01:41:06.756
And we, A, don't have an addressing system at all, and B, once one begins to be developed, there will be, of course, questions about its efficacy and safety.

01:41:08.122 --> 01:41:13.443
100% and you would need honest-to-goodness testing and we have a system that isn't even capable of honest-to-goodness testing.

01:41:14.364 --> 01:41:15.804
One final thing as long as we're here.

01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:19.665
People should be paying attention to the following thing.

01:41:20.225 --> 01:41:28.027
When you propose an mRNA platform shot to address a contagious pathogen,

01:41:29.315 --> 01:41:32.418
you're not going to escape the problem that's being described.

01:41:32.778 --> 01:41:36.261
There is no known mechanism to address these things.

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:40.665
And so you should simply say no to any proposal.

01:41:41.046 --> 01:41:45.049
And anytime you hear it discussed, the answer is, well, have you solved that basic problem?

01:41:45.069 --> 01:41:47.251
Because until you have, this is a non-starter.

01:41:47.352 --> 01:41:51.956
And so in 2025, it is absolutely inexcusable for them to only be here.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.341
It is absolutely inexcusable.

01:41:55.381 --> 01:42:11.553
In fact, it is just a happy little accident that they're here, despite having had my ear and my tutelage for almost a year, available to them on a daily basis, answering questions, repeating things, explaining it in another way.

01:42:13.334 --> 01:42:15.555
These people are just plain old charlatans.

01:42:17.177 --> 01:42:18.498
They're just plain old traitors.

01:42:19.403 --> 01:42:27.367
And they're probably members of the SAG union because they're just on social media lying as part of their job.

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:28.247
That's how they grift.

01:42:28.307 --> 01:42:29.328
That's how they take money.

01:42:29.368 --> 01:42:30.729
That's how they get sponsors.

01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:33.770
That's how they get, you know, the support that they get.

01:42:34.891 --> 01:42:38.393
And it's probably a network of people connected to Brett's dad.

01:42:41.194 --> 01:42:44.055
You know, the dad that worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:42:44.035 --> 01:42:46.757
's dad during the development of the FDA.

01:42:56.161 --> 01:42:58.641
And so these happy little accidents continue to happen.

01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:16.445
One of the greatest ones that I find really funny is that you go to Tess Laurie's, you know, LinkedIn page, and she says that she's the director of the Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy in Bath, the UK, and mentions nothing about the World Council for Health.

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:20.133
That's weird.

01:43:20.153 --> 01:43:24.697
I guess the evidence based medicine consultancy is where she gets her money from or something like that.

01:43:24.757 --> 01:43:25.618
Oh, yeah, we're very sorry.

01:43:25.998 --> 01:43:33.143
There's also coincidences about who she publishes papers about, you know, detoxing the spike protein with Jessica Rose and Paul Merrick.

01:43:34.784 --> 01:43:42.190
It's all just one big network, ladies and gentlemen, the latest sort of shenanigans in my timeline involve these three.

01:43:42.951 --> 01:43:47.414
And Professor Martin Neal, who I ever never really talked to just had a couple messages from

01:43:48.861 --> 01:43:55.990
Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler are actually members of Panda and I've known them for a while because I presented three times to Panda.

01:43:57.311 --> 01:43:59.053
Jonathan Engler is kind of a guy who

01:44:00.814 --> 01:44:02.175
you know, is like Brett.

01:44:02.335 --> 01:44:08.701
He likes to think that every idea is his own and he never will give any credit to anybody he hears anything from.

01:44:08.741 --> 01:44:12.204
He'll just adjust the words a little bit and say that he's known it.

01:44:12.564 --> 01:44:17.188
He's a guy who worked in pharma for a long time until he retired and then became a lawyer.

01:44:17.228 --> 01:44:18.609
So I'm sure he's a really good guy.

01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:25.215
And Nick Hudson is a guy who lives on top of a mountain in a fantastic house.

01:44:26.376 --> 01:44:28.537
I guess semi-retired in South Africa.

01:44:29.498 --> 01:44:42.132
in the jungle, and he's an actuary, so he knows all about population pyramids and the expected, anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was used to create the illusion of the pandemic and has never mentioned it.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:54.023
And so this guy and this guy together at Panda, this is also a Hart co-founder with Claire Craig, these two guys lost all of those presentations.

01:44:54.063 --> 01:44:55.544
They're not on their Rumble channel.

01:44:55.604 --> 01:45:07.348
So what's interesting is that Jessica Hockett contacted me as somebody who had more recently joined Panda and heard of me through the people in Panda, Nick and Jonathan.

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:27.027
Now, what's curious about this is that the second or third time I presented to Panda, Panda added to their Slack group and to their group in general, because that's what Panda was, a Slack group where people had discussions and of course they could mine the information and other people could read what we were thinking.

01:45:28.427 --> 01:45:33.392
They brought in two virologists, one virologist named Mary and one virologist named Jennifer.

01:45:33.432 --> 01:45:48.889
Mary the virologist was actually hilarious because she was so naive to this scam that she was being brought into that she actually did a live stream with Kevin McCairn in Japan around this same time, which is a dead on balls accurate admission that it's just one network.

01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:57.576
So these two ladies were brought into Panda to kind of, you know, be my opposition to virology and to tell us that virology is real.

01:45:57.636 --> 01:45:59.817
And one of them worked on flu in Hawaii.

01:45:59.877 --> 01:46:03.180
That's Jennifer, the virologist, and Mary did some other stuff.

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:04.401
Anyway, the point is.

01:46:05.894 --> 01:46:08.695
is that I left Panda after those two joined.

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:17.557
And after that Slack group kind of just started to become so dumb with, you know, those two virologists basically saying, Jay doesn't know what he's talking about.

01:46:17.597 --> 01:46:20.518
And most of the people in the chats, I guess, thinking that's true.

01:46:21.058 --> 01:46:22.118
I just left Panda.

01:46:22.198 --> 01:46:23.379
I didn't trust them anymore.

01:46:23.399 --> 01:46:27.080
And then here comes Jessica saying stuff about New York City.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.541
And when I contacted her, she said, these two guys are the guys I trust the most.

01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:31.441
We should work with them.

01:46:34.477 --> 01:46:36.799
So I want to explain what happened with Jessica Hockett.

01:46:36.819 --> 01:46:38.801
Jessica Hockett is not on X anymore.

01:46:38.841 --> 01:46:46.006
I think she quit because she realized that her private messages or direct messages to me are incriminating.

01:46:46.086 --> 01:46:48.088
Unfortunately, she's not aware of that.

01:46:48.108 --> 01:46:50.150
I've been copying all of those for years already.

01:46:51.131 --> 01:46:55.314
So even though she left Twitter, we still have all the receipts.

01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:00.644
Anyway, the point would be, you know, these little accidents happen.

01:47:00.724 --> 01:47:08.633
Nick Hudson and, you know, Jonathan Engler losing my presentations on Rumble.

01:47:08.653 --> 01:47:11.676
You can just search for Panda and maybe you can't see that now.

01:47:12.557 --> 01:47:15.481
You can search for Panda and you can search for...

01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:25.861
You can search for my name and you can find me, but if you search for me in Panda or you search for me in the Vaccine Safety Research Council, you're not going to find me.

01:47:25.901 --> 01:47:28.224
But if you do JJ Cool, you can find me on Rumble.

01:47:29.737 --> 01:47:35.820
And if you look for Cooey and Pandata, you're not gonna find me, but there are three presentations that I did that are in my archive.

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:44.383
But if you look for Rose and Panda about the second to the way down, you're gonna find both of Jennifer, or Jessica Rose's presentation to Panda.

01:47:44.403 --> 01:47:46.304
So it's not like the search engine doesn't work.

01:47:47.004 --> 01:47:54.087
It's just that those were just, you know, happy little accidents that those three presentations that I did for Panda in 2022 were lost.

01:47:56.609 --> 01:47:57.369
That's too bad.

01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:11.340
So Jessica Hockett, according to her own description on Substack, is actually an independent researcher focused on COVID events in early 2020 with an emphasis on the New York City death spike.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:17.785
And she's writing from a wood house and that's her handle, woodhouse76 or something like that.

01:48:18.645 --> 01:48:21.568
So interestingly, I would characterize her as an American trader.

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:34.943
I would characterize her as a collaborator of PANDA, which is also a sabotaged organization, an international organization used to kind of split the resistance up and to undermine America as a culture.

01:48:35.483 --> 01:48:40.144
That's why they're especially active as a group on X, for example.

01:48:41.084 --> 01:48:43.265
Jessica Hockett left X last year, though.

01:48:43.285 --> 01:48:46.446
I mean, she's blocked me everywhere, including on

01:48:48.206 --> 01:48:54.407
including on Substack, which is really cute because, you know, of course, you can still read things that people send you.

01:48:55.167 --> 01:48:57.348
And so other people have sent me her recent work.

01:48:57.768 --> 01:49:17.632
But I think it's really important to put into context why I would strongly advise you to put these three people into the bucket of international traders that are working to extend and maximize the chaos created by the pandemic and its effect on the American culture in a negative way.

01:49:18.712 --> 01:49:23.635
The reason why I would say that is because these people have been involved with me for at least a year and a half.

01:49:23.695 --> 01:49:31.820
They've known who I am, they've been watching my shows, and they've been direct messaging me since about August 2023.

01:49:32.261 --> 01:49:44.288
And so it's very important to understand that Jessica Hockett says fraud, not murder, and she never mentioned supplementary oxygen ever since we came to that conclusion with the help of her.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:51.023
Mark and I stumbled upon supplementary oxygen because of her, more or less.

01:49:51.583 --> 01:50:06.290
And questioning the protocols in New York led us back to Kyle Seidel saying that they're running out of oxygen because they're using it at 60 liters a minute, which was very similar to Leslie Batts' husband's death sort of protocol list.

01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:09.292
And so Nick Hudson never says murder.

01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:12.951
And Jonathan Engler never says murder either.

01:50:13.051 --> 01:50:20.015
So the idea that a murder in America was used to create the illusion of the pandemic is something that none of these people will say.

01:50:20.575 --> 01:50:23.336
I will explain that again and say it succinctly.

01:50:23.837 --> 01:50:32.381
The idea that murder in America was used to create the illusion of the pandemic around the world will never be

01:50:33.101 --> 01:50:41.248
mentioned by these people, even if we give them the numbers, even if Denny Rancor shows them in numbers, even if we give them mechanisms, they will never say it.

01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:44.892
And that makes them guilty.

01:50:45.785 --> 01:51:03.659
Now in the same way that I can show you that I contacted James Lyons-Weiler in February 22nd, 2020 to show him my JC on a bike coronavirus ride and asked him for an interview, I can also show you when these people contacted me first on X.

01:51:04.895 --> 01:51:11.239
And that should be pretty definitive evidence of when these people started communicating with me, because that's where this is done.

01:51:11.299 --> 01:51:13.700
That's where this whole show is done.

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:21.064
So I will remind you again of when I came up with transfection as being a bad idea, when I finally figured out infectious clones.

01:51:21.104 --> 01:51:34.012
And I show you here that Jessica Hockett, Nick Hudson, and Jonathan Engler, and Martin Neal got in contact with me in the middle of 2023, when I was still employed by CHD, but the book had not come out yet.

01:51:36.946 --> 01:51:49.417
And so Nick Hudson contacted me first on, after three presentations for his group, Panda, he had not contacted me yet, except for in the, in the Panda Slack.

01:51:51.499 --> 01:51:53.701
And he contacted me on July 8th, 2023 in Twitter.

01:51:58.418 --> 01:52:09.308
And about a week later, I sent a message to Jessica Hockett because she was brought to my attention by Nick, if I remember correctly, but it may be somebody else showed me her work.

01:52:09.348 --> 01:52:13.271
And I contacted her and she said, sure, I'd be honored to be on your show.

01:52:13.311 --> 01:52:14.192
That was July 19th, 2023.

01:52:18.995 --> 01:52:22.917
And August 13th, Jonathan Engler joins me.

01:52:23.017 --> 01:52:23.297
Why?

01:52:23.397 --> 01:52:25.958
Because Jessica said I should trust him.

01:52:25.998 --> 01:52:26.678
He's a good guy.

01:52:26.718 --> 01:52:27.778
Let's make a little group.

01:52:28.619 --> 01:52:32.340
Why don't you let him, why don't you follow him on X so that he can DM you?

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:40.123
And then on the 31st of August, Professor Martin Neal also joined me.

01:52:40.183 --> 01:52:40.903
Great to meet you.

01:52:41.703 --> 01:52:42.844
This is my substack.

01:52:42.904 --> 01:52:44.064
Here's one article of mine.

01:52:44.084 --> 01:52:45.705
I'm looking forward to working together.

01:52:45.745 --> 01:52:46.205
There it is.

01:52:46.245 --> 01:52:48.006
We're gonna write a virology review.

01:52:48.446 --> 01:52:51.228
This is August 30th, 2023.

01:52:51.708 --> 01:52:54.149
We're gonna write a virology review about clones.

01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:58.471
And so I started making that substack and I've shown it to you.

01:52:59.397 --> 01:53:08.125
where I was telling them how virology is done in cell culture using transfection, etc, etc, etc, and they ignored it.

01:53:09.046 --> 01:53:10.227
Ignored it for a long time.

01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:12.811
Ignored it for a long time.

01:53:12.911 --> 01:53:25.097
Actually, the book came out and then they ignored it for another five months before finally on May 30th, Jonathan Engler sends me this article that they wrote that Jessica Hockett said, I should have written with them.

01:53:25.157 --> 01:53:27.258
I could have written with them, but you didn't want to work with them.

01:53:27.318 --> 01:53:28.078
It's unfortunate.

01:53:28.098 --> 01:53:29.359
And I was like, what are you talking about?

01:53:29.399 --> 01:53:32.901
I've been putting together the Substack article with notes.

01:53:32.941 --> 01:53:33.961
You guys are ignoring it.

01:53:34.021 --> 01:53:34.782
You wrote this.

01:53:37.723 --> 01:53:38.944
And that was a year later.

01:53:40.703 --> 01:53:49.645
a year of talking on DMs, of having signal chats, of getting little cute voicemails from Jessica.

01:53:49.665 --> 01:54:02.429
And it culminated in May of 2024 with me and Jessica and her friend, Hugh Gaston, who was presenting to Senator Ron Johnson's staff members.

01:54:03.509 --> 01:54:06.290
And then Jessica basically broke off contact with me.

01:54:07.847 --> 01:54:10.148
And so let's put this in perspective again now.

01:54:10.228 --> 01:54:12.669
I met Drastic in 2020 in February.

01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:16.992
Then I lost my job for saying transfection in around August.

01:54:17.712 --> 01:54:28.697
Then around, I guess, September, Piper Stover gets in contact with me and delays the publishing of my review that says stop transfection in humans until May.

01:54:28.777 --> 01:54:31.739
And then I get in contact with Brett Weinstein through Piper.

01:54:33.103 --> 01:54:35.444
Then Kevin McKernan comes on my stream.

01:54:35.504 --> 01:54:37.425
Then Charles Rixey comes to my house.

01:54:37.845 --> 01:54:41.627
Then Senator Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:41.667 --> 01:54:45.828
call me on the same day to tell me that Robert Malone sat them down and made me watch my stream.

01:54:46.909 --> 01:54:48.990
Then CHD hires me for a year and a half.

01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:51.831
Then I figure out clones because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:51.911 --> 01:54:52.932
asked me to teach it to him.

01:54:53.932 --> 01:54:59.454
Then Kevin McCarran came to Pittsburgh, which is so strange still, and not till August, 2023,

01:55:02.196 --> 01:55:04.098
Do these four people get in touch with me?

01:55:04.198 --> 01:55:13.606
And then a year later, a full six months after the book comes out, they release this virus origins claim of function.

01:55:14.426 --> 01:55:20.331
Not gain of function as a mythology, like I've been saying for two years, but claim of function.

01:55:20.351 --> 01:55:21.052
It's our idea.

01:55:21.933 --> 01:55:22.593
It's our idea.

01:55:23.834 --> 01:55:30.220
After Jessica trying to get me to write something with them for like seven months and me telling them they're ignoring what I want to write.

01:55:31.101 --> 01:55:32.102
They're not listening to me.

01:55:32.182 --> 01:55:33.622
They're writing a virology review.

01:55:33.663 --> 01:55:34.443
This is stupid.

01:55:37.365 --> 01:55:40.406
And so that came out May 30th, 2024.

01:55:41.027 --> 01:55:49.252
And that thorough review of the available evidence suggests that the emergence of a novel engineered virus is the least likely explanation for the event known as COVID pandemic.

01:55:49.792 --> 01:55:53.074
The discovery of novel virus is a function of how we determined to find them.

01:55:53.674 --> 01:55:55.936
This looks like, and if you read it for yourself,

01:55:56.852 --> 01:55:58.633
You have to go behind a paywall now, of course.

01:55:58.973 --> 01:56:04.777
If you read it for yourself, this is not a simple explanation for a lie based on a hot background of a PCR test.

01:56:05.158 --> 01:56:09.040
This is a stupid, complicated explanation that never commits to anything.

01:56:09.881 --> 01:56:13.943
Doesn't explain anything and makes it wishy-washy and bullshitty.

01:56:13.984 --> 01:56:15.865
And it's like 20 pages long.

01:56:16.305 --> 01:56:20.068
And on the 13th page, supposedly they cited me.

01:56:20.448 --> 01:56:22.970
Jessica says, they really, they cited your work.

01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:24.751
They're really great guys.

01:56:27.253 --> 01:56:28.494
And how did they cite my work?

01:56:28.534 --> 01:56:35.316
With two giant paragraphs where they just say down on the bottom here, Jonathan Cooey, Dead Link, and James Giordano.

01:56:37.477 --> 01:56:42.640
And here in the first paragraph, they seem to be explaining something that they say is their own idea, but it's not.

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:47.582
It's also just a stupid, complicated misrepresentation of mine.

01:56:48.262 --> 01:56:52.544
And this is also a stupid complication of a very simple idea.

01:56:54.389 --> 01:56:56.732
And this they did in May of 2024.

01:56:57.793 --> 01:56:59.895
Ladies and gentlemen, that's like seven months ago.

01:57:02.237 --> 01:57:10.466
Now, the reason why this is important is because right after this happened, I begged Jessica Hockett to see that this is not a genuine review.

01:57:10.947 --> 01:57:12.829
This is not a genuine citation.

01:57:12.869 --> 01:57:16.833
If they wanted to help me, there would be a link here to GigaOM Biological.

01:57:17.896 --> 01:57:19.577
Not a link to James Giordano.

01:57:19.937 --> 01:57:26.201
They would have linked to me all the way up at the top of the article, not in page 13 in the 16th citation.

01:57:28.102 --> 01:57:35.286
After a year of courting my ideas, of asking questions in direct messages, this is the thanks I got.

01:57:37.007 --> 01:57:37.848
And so I was mad.

01:57:39.659 --> 01:57:48.824
I was very, very mad at these two guys, because I thought all this talk, all this explanation, all these things I've shown you, and then this is what you get?

01:57:49.324 --> 01:57:50.584
That there is a real virus?

01:57:51.385 --> 01:57:52.065
It doesn't matter?

01:57:54.106 --> 01:57:55.647
And what does that mean, it doesn't matter?

01:57:55.687 --> 01:58:05.332
Well, I even, I have the direct messages right here to Jonathan Engler, where in this message, I say, this is what I sent to Marty, Martin,

01:58:07.133 --> 01:58:09.994
I sent a message to Martin saying, this is the stupidest review.

01:58:10.374 --> 01:58:11.494
Welcome to 2020.

01:58:12.454 --> 01:58:15.895
This review I did on a bike in 2020, dude.

01:58:16.595 --> 01:58:19.976
Why are you writing this review now after a year of talking to me?

01:58:20.016 --> 01:58:21.157
This is bullshit.

01:58:21.617 --> 01:58:30.519
And in fact, in the subsequent message to Jonathan Engler, I say, I'm starting to doubt simply because we don't seem to make progress.

01:58:30.999 --> 01:58:35.141
Just you and Nick and Hart seem to make progress and get noticed.

01:58:35.601 --> 01:58:39.963
Maybe it's just an illusion but I pay pretty gross attention to the patterns are pretty stark.

01:58:40.503 --> 01:58:50.667
I've tagged all of you hundreds of times over the years and you all have mentioned my work a couple times and can't even get to the point to another biologist explain it better than me.

01:58:51.087 --> 01:58:52.488
It's extraordinary.

01:58:53.588 --> 01:58:55.829
I said it and these messages are real.

01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:57.550
These messages are recorded.

01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.411
These messages are going in my book because these people

01:59:01.806 --> 01:59:02.867
These people ignore it.

01:59:03.687 --> 01:59:06.388
And that's why I got mad because look at the date of this tweet.

01:59:06.408 --> 01:59:07.389
This is June 8th, 2024.

01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:16.014
It's about a week after their big claim of function sub stack that you should have written with us, but you didn't.

01:59:16.074 --> 01:59:18.315
And now you're missing out on all the accolades.

01:59:20.091 --> 01:59:24.753
And this Claire Craig person tweets, you can believe there was a virus.

01:59:24.793 --> 01:59:26.494
You can believe that virus killed people.

01:59:26.534 --> 01:59:28.635
You can believe gain of function played a role.

01:59:29.056 --> 01:59:31.777
And none of that would contradict what Allen says here.

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:35.459
In fact, it's easier when there's a virus spreading too.

01:59:38.165 --> 01:59:41.227
Claire Craig is co-chair of Heart.

01:59:41.767 --> 01:59:46.769
Claire Craig was an author on the paper with Kevin McKernan about the Corman-Jorston report.

01:59:47.169 --> 01:59:52.652
She has over 200,000 followers and these people promote her and would not correct her about this.

01:59:53.192 --> 01:59:56.113
In fact, this is after their virology review.

01:59:56.153 --> 02:00:00.615
They could have corrected her by citing their virology review, but they did not.

02:00:00.675 --> 02:00:01.856
They admonished me.

02:00:03.302 --> 02:00:03.963
for saying it.

02:00:04.103 --> 02:00:10.710
I said on Twitter, hey dudes, since you're so good at saying there's no pandemic, why don't you correct this nutcase?

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:17.197
And they admonished me offline that Claire Craig's a good guy.

02:00:18.179 --> 02:00:19.780
You can't, she's a great person.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.282
She doesn't, she means well.

02:00:21.642 --> 02:00:22.984
You're misunderstanding that.

02:00:23.524 --> 02:00:24.646
No, I'm not.

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.806
I've been trying to tell them for a year that there is no gain of function virus that can go around the world.

02:00:31.846 --> 02:00:34.209
That's a mythology and RNA can't do it either.

02:00:35.271 --> 02:00:36.532
The whole thing's a mythology.

02:00:37.533 --> 02:00:40.036
And so we've got to get people like Claire Craig to believe that.

02:00:40.077 --> 02:00:40.817
But did they do that?

02:00:40.898 --> 02:00:43.120
No, no.

02:00:44.923 --> 02:00:45.964
Instead they blocked me.

02:00:47.782 --> 02:00:51.987
Now, I pleaded with Jessica Hockett on this date.

02:00:52.188 --> 02:01:01.419
I pleaded with her to see that this was a disaster, that these people had to be lying, because that virology review is shit, and now they won't check,

02:01:03.021 --> 02:01:09.543
Dr. Claire Craig, who they of course chair the heart group with, and he is co-chair of PANDA.

02:01:10.044 --> 02:01:21.688
So it's very strange that Nick and this guy agree that we shouldn't touch her, even though she has never questioned the PCR test.

02:01:23.365 --> 02:01:26.067
Never questioned it, ladies and gentlemen, never questioned it.

02:01:26.107 --> 02:01:31.452
In fact, Claire Craig is a genome collector from before the pandemic.

02:01:31.872 --> 02:01:40.919
Since 2016, she was the day-to-day lead for the pathology and clinical data in the cancer arm of the 100,000 Genomes Project.

02:01:42.401 --> 02:01:45.844
She also worked in AI cancer diagnostics.

02:01:47.765 --> 02:01:51.148
So a former retired pharma exec turned lawyer

02:01:53.461 --> 02:02:01.866
and a 100,000 Genomes Project doctor founded Heart, and we're supposed to believe they're good guys.

02:02:02.507 --> 02:02:12.933
And an actuary who never talks about population pyramids founded Panda with that same retired pharma guy turned lawyer.

02:02:13.293 --> 02:02:15.975
And we're supposed to believe Panda's a good organization too.

02:02:18.176 --> 02:02:18.977
So this woman,

02:02:19.841 --> 02:02:27.543
who says that you can believe in a virus, you can believe virus killed people, you can believe gain of function played a role, and you can believe that a virus is splitting too.

02:02:27.583 --> 02:02:29.004
It's actually easier if you do.

02:02:29.524 --> 02:02:32.825
This is what she said about the PCR test in 2021.

02:02:46.007 --> 02:02:48.208
Now, testing itself can fail.

02:02:48.869 --> 02:02:50.170
Every test involves a compromise.

02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:55.953
You have to choose, do I want to find every possible case, or do I only want to find the definite cases?

02:02:56.874 --> 02:03:02.397
And at the beginning of an epidemic, when cases are growing, over-diagnosing a few people is acceptable.

02:03:03.178 --> 02:03:05.479
But at peak deaths, you have to change strategy.

02:03:05.979 --> 02:03:08.801
You change strategy instead of focusing on the individual.

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:11.463
So at peak deaths, you have to change strategy.

02:03:11.503 --> 02:03:12.944
So nothing about this talk

02:03:13.604 --> 02:03:18.966
will tell you that PCR is bad and in fact it's going to compare it to restaurant food in about two seconds.

02:03:20.566 --> 02:03:21.686
You look at the population.

02:03:21.946 --> 02:03:28.728
Instead of trying to diagnose every possible case, you want to find the definite cases and you have to change your laboratory strategy.

02:03:29.729 --> 02:03:36.431
So you may have heard people talk about restaurants and say that there are three things restaurants can do but they can only do two of them well.

02:03:36.791 --> 02:03:40.152
You can have fast food, cheap food or high quality food.

02:03:40.752 --> 02:03:47.895
Well, it's the same with laboratories, but the three things are high volume of tests, high speed of tests, or quality test results.

02:03:48.175 --> 02:03:48.916
And you choose two.

02:03:49.376 --> 02:03:50.676
We chose volume and speed.

02:03:50.977 --> 02:03:52.057
And actually, there's a good one.

02:03:52.217 --> 02:03:54.558
This is malevolence at its finest.

02:03:54.758 --> 02:04:03.002
She is not usefully questioning the foundational myths of the pandemic that are very, very, very much surrounding the tests.

02:04:04.246 --> 02:04:11.111
This is absolute malevolence, and her coordinated actions with Kevin McKernan make it obvious.

02:04:11.171 --> 02:04:16.434
Her coordinated actions and protection on social media by these other actors makes it obvious.

02:04:17.035 --> 02:04:28.683
And their ignoring of my ability to more succinctly summarize these ideas than they themselves can is further evidence of their collaboration with this malevolence.

02:04:32.785 --> 02:04:32.986
Now,

02:04:34.147 --> 02:05:01.775
without wanting to beat too much of a dead horse here, I think it's very important to understand where this occurred and at what time it occurred, because again- So for what it's worth, I mean- The voicemail that I had played at the beginning of the show is a voicemail that comes right after I beg Jessica to understand that this virology review and their inability, they're ignoring Claire Craig,

02:05:02.865 --> 02:05:13.548
as wrong, as perpetuating a lot of these myths when she could have spoken out, ignoring her connections to Kevin McKernan, it means that they're bad guys.

02:05:13.728 --> 02:05:24.632
And I pleaded with her as an American to understand that these guys are foreigners and they would happily work against us if they're not working for America.

02:05:25.512 --> 02:05:31.654
If they're part of this controlled demolition of America, you need to be scared of them, Jessica.

02:05:33.444 --> 02:05:37.162
And this is the voicemail she sent to me one day before she blocked me.

02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:45.093
this is the voicemail she sent me really one day after she released a video of our presentation to Senator Ron Johnson.

02:05:45.553 --> 02:05:47.614
I had no idea that she would block me.

02:05:47.654 --> 02:06:03.960
I had no idea why she blocked me because this is the last communication I had with her and it was very specifically about me pleading with her to understand that Nick Hudson had been on a boat with these people off the coast of Turkey and that

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:07.062
Jonathan Engler had been ignoring me for too long.

02:06:07.122 --> 02:06:09.083
I've had too much conversation with these people.

02:06:09.123 --> 02:06:11.124
They're not interested in moving the ball.

02:06:11.544 --> 02:06:15.047
And that this substack was evidence for it.

02:06:15.227 --> 02:06:17.288
This is her voicemail response to that.

02:06:18.429 --> 02:06:20.930
It's such a chaotic scene right now.

02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:26.714
It seems like, you know, intentionally, obviously, it's only going to get worse with the election coming up.

02:06:27.558 --> 02:06:31.241
I still, you know, I don't follow very many people anymore.

02:06:31.261 --> 02:06:32.922
I just follow like 22.

02:06:33.583 --> 02:06:36.405
If I follow somebody, I trust them.

02:06:36.665 --> 02:06:50.535
You know, as far as I know, as much as it depends on my knowledge and sense of things, you know, it's not that I agree with everything that person says necessarily, but that person is, they are who they say they are.

02:06:50.915 --> 02:06:52.296
They are authentic.

02:06:53.897 --> 02:06:54.718
If, you know,

02:06:56.504 --> 02:07:01.868
I admit that I'm biased because I know that, especially Jonathan Engler, I know him well.

02:07:02.749 --> 02:07:06.591
So I have, you know, for a year plus.

02:07:07.112 --> 02:07:10.274
A year plus, and this is June, 2024.

02:07:10.654 --> 02:07:15.818
So she's known him for at least a year, almost as long as she's known me.

02:07:15.838 --> 02:07:15.878
So,

02:07:27.336 --> 02:07:35.560
if Jonathan Engler turns out to be something that he's not, or some kind of manipulator, I would be devastated.

02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:41.503
I would be absolutely devastated and probably quit this whole thing and be like, okay, then I don't know anybody.

02:07:41.843 --> 02:07:42.944
Then I can't tell anything.

02:07:43.724 --> 02:07:46.345
So that doesn't mean that you have to see it the same way.

02:07:47.706 --> 02:07:53.688
Martin's saying, as far as I know, Martin and Norman Fenton are putting, they put,

02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:58.811
their sub-stacks over the past... Listen, they always try to tempt you.

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:00.052
Oh, you're going to get published.

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:00.792
They're going to publish.

02:08:00.812 --> 02:08:03.073
They're going to cite you, and that's going to make you feel better.

02:08:03.113 --> 02:08:03.413
Listen.

02:08:04.994 --> 02:08:06.895
...four years into a book.

02:08:06.935 --> 02:08:21.643
I mean, I've read the... I skimmed the book, and the chapter, or excuse me, that paper that they... that Jonathan and Martin just wrote, where they included your work, it's going into that book.

02:08:23.806 --> 02:08:27.749
and content that I wrote with them is going into that book.

02:08:27.789 --> 02:08:30.851
You know, Martin's in the academic world.

02:08:30.932 --> 02:08:33.854
He was finishing marking up papers this week.

02:08:34.014 --> 02:08:35.955
He's in the academic world.

02:08:36.015 --> 02:08:37.156
What is that supposed to mean?

02:08:37.196 --> 02:08:39.338
I was in the academic world for 20 years.

02:08:39.398 --> 02:08:40.439
What does that even mean?

02:08:40.499 --> 02:08:42.080
It sounds like she's just naive.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:46.543
So, and you know, he does play things a little closer to

02:08:48.015 --> 02:08:48.816
the best, right?

02:08:48.856 --> 02:08:51.859
That, that is the way he is on, on social media.

02:08:51.899 --> 02:08:54.862
But my experiences with him have been very good.

02:08:55.142 --> 02:09:01.648
So yeah, if those guys are like playing me or using me or who knows, right?

02:09:01.688 --> 02:09:04.171
Again, I don't know what, I don't know what to say.

02:09:04.651 --> 02:09:05.392
Who knows?

02:09:06.032 --> 02:09:06.713
Who knows?

02:09:06.813 --> 02:09:07.094
Right.

02:09:07.154 --> 02:09:08.615
It's just for all the marbles.

02:09:09.136 --> 02:09:10.557
It's just for all the marbles.

02:09:10.617 --> 02:09:11.157
Who knows?

02:09:11.218 --> 02:09:11.438
Right.

02:09:11.478 --> 02:09:12.539
I can't tell, but.

02:09:14.515 --> 02:09:25.246
I would continue, I can't tell you what to do, but I would continue to give them, I recommend giving them the benefit of the doubt until there's really, really good reason not to.

02:09:25.837 --> 02:09:29.198
Now, if she'd have stopped right there, it would be fine, right?

02:09:29.238 --> 02:09:31.798
Then it just seems like, Jay, it seems like you're right.

02:09:31.878 --> 02:09:41.620
Maybe she was, you know, just one, maybe, maybe it was that Panda and, and maybe Jonathan Engler and, and, and Nick Hudson have fooled her.

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:46.601
And, uh, she really does think they're good, but, but she doesn't stop there.

02:09:47.402 --> 02:09:49.142
The amateur hour continues.

02:09:50.333 --> 02:09:54.796
because they really think I have the hook deep in my throat.

02:09:55.477 --> 02:09:56.357
She doesn't stop.

02:09:56.758 --> 02:09:57.578
She keeps going.

02:09:58.059 --> 02:10:06.905
And what she says on June 6th, 2024 at the end of the last voicemail that I got from her is such an admission, it's kind of comical.

02:10:09.639 --> 02:10:12.440
Catherine Watt's an interesting one for me.

02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:16.022
I mean, I replied to her on Sage Hanna's subset.

02:10:16.482 --> 02:10:21.824
I actually blocked Sage Hanna, but because he told me he didn't care if I got shot in the head.

02:10:22.432 --> 02:10:26.294
Okay, so you gotta break that down, right?

02:10:26.754 --> 02:10:33.417
Because out of nowhere, she brings up Catherine Watt, which I don't think I ever said anything about Catherine Watt.

02:10:33.437 --> 02:10:36.558
I don't know what, I can't understand why that came up.

02:10:37.039 --> 02:10:50.685
But then she says Sage Hannah, and then she says she blocked him because he said, because he said, but then she's gonna say that she doesn't know who writes that sub stack.

02:10:52.097 --> 02:10:54.600
I have no idea who runs that sub stack.

02:10:56.562 --> 02:10:59.085
I think Catherine's legitimate.

02:10:59.145 --> 02:11:05.733
I don't understand the role of Sasha Latupova 100%, but I've been honest about that with people about what I think is going on there.

02:11:05.753 --> 02:11:08.457
Again.

02:11:09.719 --> 02:11:21.985
I head down, I'm really trying to focus on what I'm doing and what I do well as much as possible because I believe that that will bring the best result.

02:11:22.166 --> 02:11:32.411
And you've been really formative, you know, for me and I think a lot of other people and you've taken the hits, not just with the clone stuff or the possibilities of

02:11:33.132 --> 02:11:41.037
you know, building a biological bridge there with the clone, but you've been helpful in helping people see who some of these players really are.

02:11:41.057 --> 02:11:46.300
You know, I think that in some ways is probably your best, you know, biggest contribution.

02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:49.502
And I've tried to honor that and cite you where and when I can.

02:11:49.602 --> 02:11:56.146
So, you know, I only know who I am and I'm legit.

02:11:56.166 --> 02:11:58.087
I'm legit.

02:11:58.147 --> 02:11:58.647
Have a good day.

02:11:58.927 --> 02:11:59.508
Have a good day.

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:01.125
I'm legit.

02:12:01.405 --> 02:12:02.185
Have a good day.

02:12:02.906 --> 02:12:03.566
I'm legit.

02:12:03.846 --> 02:12:04.486
Have a good day.

02:12:04.566 --> 02:12:06.986
Now that's May and June of 2024.

02:12:08.567 --> 02:12:10.767
And if that would have stopped there, it would be fine.

02:12:10.787 --> 02:12:11.507
But guess what?

02:12:12.028 --> 02:12:14.468
Last Friday, they kept going.

02:12:15.448 --> 02:12:16.529
That's the sad part.

02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:19.009
Last Friday, they kept going.

02:12:19.929 --> 02:12:27.251
Now remember, this has been my message for quite some time, certainly as long as Jessica's been my friend, which is like a year or so.

02:12:29.269 --> 02:12:32.651
And certainly it was my message when I presented to Senator Ron Johnson.

02:12:32.671 --> 02:12:37.553
It was certainly my message when I presented for a very long time now, for a couple years now.

02:12:39.093 --> 02:12:58.182
And so all of these people claim to know me or cite me, but don't cite me, are admitting that they are part of this because as Brandy did and as Polly did before the pandemic, if you're not saying it right during the pandemic, it's an admission.

02:12:59.847 --> 02:13:03.809
Especially if you were saying it right before the pandemic, like Polly was.

02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:08.831
So anyway, we are here right now.

02:13:08.911 --> 02:13:15.254
This is the February, 2025, Jessica Hockett, Nick Hudson, Jonathan Engler, Martin Neal.

02:13:15.334 --> 02:13:16.875
Remember, this is the timeline.

02:13:17.355 --> 02:13:18.796
Where are we in February, 2025?

02:13:18.896 --> 02:13:20.316
We're right here.

02:13:21.977 --> 02:13:28.060
Where Jessica Hockett writes a Jonathan Engler article called the false binaries.

02:13:28.993 --> 02:13:37.435
that limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion in the COVID-19 debate and perpetuate lies told by the powers that be.

02:13:37.995 --> 02:13:38.735
Part one.

02:13:42.536 --> 02:13:43.696
Now, why is this funny?

02:13:43.776 --> 02:13:46.156
Remember, they met me in August of 2023.

02:13:46.256 --> 02:13:53.978
They were watching my streams before that because Jessica said it would be an honor to be on your show.

02:13:58.095 --> 02:14:02.617
I had already presented three times to Panda before Jessica was ever in the audience of Panda.

02:14:04.959 --> 02:14:08.420
And all three of those presentations were seen by Nick and by Jonathan.

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:10.021
So it's strange, right?

02:14:10.061 --> 02:14:13.743
That in 2025, that's where these two are.

02:14:14.403 --> 02:14:17.685
Promoting an anonymous account?

02:14:19.026 --> 02:14:19.566
Interesting.

02:14:19.846 --> 02:14:21.287
And Vinay Prasad?

02:14:22.468 --> 02:14:22.968
Interesting.

02:14:23.786 --> 02:14:31.191
Let's look further into this very, very insightful February Substack article by Jonathan and Jessica.

02:14:33.792 --> 02:14:39.656
Oh, so it's a limited spectrum of opinion according to Noam Chomsky.

02:14:40.257 --> 02:14:44.220
Interesting that they use Noam Chomsky's work here.

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:47.162
Of course, they just found that by themselves.

02:14:47.182 --> 02:14:51.986
It wouldn't be that I've been using that slide for like three years that brought it to their attention.

02:14:52.486 --> 02:14:54.708
They're just using Noam Chomsky, which is fine.

02:14:55.208 --> 02:14:56.930
It's a happy little accident, right?

02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:05.095
As we go through this, you will find an enormously stupid, complicated version of the central false binary.

02:15:05.155 --> 02:15:06.636
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:15:06.956 --> 02:15:10.038
The gap between the pro-narrative, permitted dissent views.

02:15:10.098 --> 02:15:11.259
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:15:11.659 --> 02:15:21.145
It's much, much better to explain it this way to young people than to say that they tricked you into solving a mystery and that made you accept they're monsters.

02:15:22.199 --> 02:15:26.002
No, no, let's write a substack where we make it really, really complicated.

02:15:26.403 --> 02:15:39.714
And then in that substack, let's have all kinds of bullshit and all kinds of active links, like an active link for Vinay Prasad on X, like active links for democide or for fraud, but not murder.

02:15:42.469 --> 02:15:50.820
But then when we cite Jonathan Cooey in a substack, there's just this happy little accident that occurs when we cite him in the links.

02:15:51.401 --> 02:15:55.426
We don't know how to put a link for Jonathan Cooey on Jonathan Cooey's name.

02:15:56.187 --> 02:15:57.109
That's pretty hard to do.

02:15:58.092 --> 02:16:06.438
So instead, we're gonna give you a link to Michael Singer's substack with all dead links to Jay's work.

02:16:07.078 --> 02:16:10.420
And then I'm gonna give you a link to my own work.

02:16:10.841 --> 02:16:18.226
And I'm gonna give you a link to the virology review that also kind of cites Jay's work on the 13th page, but not really.

02:16:20.667 --> 02:16:25.771
That's Jessica Hockett, my friend, who was SMSing me for almost a year.

02:16:27.293 --> 02:16:28.714
sending me pictures of her niece.

02:16:30.776 --> 02:16:42.304
That's how she is helping my family right now, by writing a substack that makes my ideas stupid complicated, while giving me credit, but not really giving me credit, and giving me credit for what?

02:16:42.464 --> 02:16:44.025
For the false binary idea?

02:16:45.086 --> 02:16:49.189
Either or fallacies, she calls it, with another link, not to me.

02:16:51.350 --> 02:16:56.094
The real sad part about this, ladies and gentlemen, is it gets much darker, because in the comments,

02:16:58.059 --> 02:17:07.729
The link that she gives right is to this virology review, which is now behind a paywall and that virology review was written in May of 2024 and it is bullshit.

02:17:08.951 --> 02:17:15.798
And in fact, we had a falling out because it was bullshit and she would not accept that these people were not helping me.

02:17:17.748 --> 02:17:31.582
And she goes on to say all the things that I'm saying in her own substack that she also links, not to me, but to her own substack, where she says, again, in a very stupid, complicated way, that this is what I think right now.

02:17:32.102 --> 02:17:34.405
For what it's worth, this is my current view.

02:17:36.887 --> 02:17:42.613
And this is basically just a stupid, complicated, here's infectious clone right there with no citation.

02:17:45.063 --> 02:17:47.744
This is the worst kind of malevolent traitor right here.

02:17:47.784 --> 02:17:48.705
This person right here.

02:17:50.085 --> 02:17:56.308
Jessica Hockett is one of the worst traitors there can be because from the very beginning when she contacted me, she was fake.

02:17:58.189 --> 02:17:59.750
The happiness was fake.

02:17:59.810 --> 02:18:01.170
The friendship was fake.

02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:02.531
The giggling was fake.

02:18:03.031 --> 02:18:04.032
All of it was fake.

02:18:04.492 --> 02:18:05.612
She did it to Mark too.

02:18:07.093 --> 02:18:09.354
In coordination with these people and Panda.

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:22.905
to write these articles over the course of a year and a half that dilute and obfuscate the simple truths that I can put on a single slide and have been able to since the duration of our acquaintance.

02:18:26.606 --> 02:18:29.567
These happy little accidents have been happening to me for five years.

02:18:30.008 --> 02:18:33.389
Another happy little accident that happens in that same substack.

02:18:34.423 --> 02:18:43.592
of Jonathan Engler and Jessica Hockett is that Mike Yeadon comes in and says, thank you both for a fine piece and for making the results of your evaluations clear.

02:18:44.032 --> 02:18:45.193
Very much appreciated.

02:18:47.455 --> 02:18:49.397
And she gets to talk back, oh yeah, very much.

02:18:49.457 --> 02:18:51.119
There's a lot of room for this stuff, you know.

02:18:51.139 --> 02:18:55.803
It's been very hard for me, proverbs, blah, blah, blah, proverbs.

02:18:56.304 --> 02:18:59.307
Oh, wonderful phrase, the phrase false binaries.

02:19:03.675 --> 02:19:11.197
Mike Eden and his collaboration with Sasha Latupova and often promoting Sasha Latupova and now this performance right here.

02:19:11.297 --> 02:19:12.357
I'm sorry, folks.

02:19:13.677 --> 02:19:17.998
Mike Eden's been on my stream and has heard me talk and knows damn well that I got it right.

02:19:18.058 --> 02:19:20.659
Mike Eden is a liar and a traitor to our children.

02:19:21.699 --> 02:19:28.761
It's really unfortunate, but this that happened last week can only be seen as malevolence.

02:19:29.693 --> 02:19:35.515
He is actively coordinating with them the titration of us over the finish line.

02:19:35.555 --> 02:19:39.896
He may be just working with the people that want to control, demolish America.

02:19:41.317 --> 02:19:47.279
But that's what's happening and you can, if you want to, see it for exactly what it is.

02:19:48.339 --> 02:19:50.560
Because Mike Eden's timeline reveals it.

02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:53.861
Mike Eden's interaction with me reveals it.

02:19:54.943 --> 02:19:57.264
They've all known for too long not to say it.

02:19:57.304 --> 02:20:03.366
Mike Yeadon is a guy who knows exactly how biologics are made and has never told you the truth like I have.

02:20:05.146 --> 02:20:11.028
Jonathan Engler is a guy who worked in pharmaceuticals and probably knows how biologic was made and never told you like I have.

02:20:11.088 --> 02:20:15.910
And Jessica Hockett is just somebody they recruited and used because she's willing to lie for pay.

02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:23.032
It's really sad where we are right now where really, if you want to accept

02:20:24.339 --> 02:20:34.464
the last 10 years of history, you have to accept an inordinate amount of happy accidents where people just find themselves in the right place at the right time with the wrong language.

02:20:35.984 --> 02:20:37.624
find themselves in the right Zoom meeting.

02:20:37.644 --> 02:20:39.625
You think that this is, this is, you think this is by accident?

02:20:39.665 --> 02:20:41.225
That that little boy is on with this English guy in 2013?

02:20:41.265 --> 02:20:42.466
Or do you think that we are being set up?

02:20:42.486 --> 02:20:44.286
Just like this was a setup, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:03.271 --> 02:21:11.714
At the start of the pandemic and before, they have been setting up all of these people to play a role in our governance because they saw it coming.

02:21:11.754 --> 02:21:21.797
They saw the internet for what it was, an opportunity to create a noosphere, an illusion of global communication, an illusion of global awareness.

02:21:22.417 --> 02:21:30.360
And so with that algorithmic military tool, they can make it seem like this guy spontaneously rises.

02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:36.903
They can make it seem like there's some spontaneous illusion of consensus about how smart he is.

02:21:38.604 --> 02:21:44.348
Just like they've made an illusion of consensus about this guy being some kind of whistleblower.

02:21:45.629 --> 02:21:48.911
When in reality, he is absolutely part of the narrative.

02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:50.472
He is a malevolent player.

02:21:50.632 --> 02:21:54.495
He is one of the earliest actors and probably one of the guys that's coordinating the script.

02:21:55.796 --> 02:21:58.457
That's the reason why he was in position from the very beginning.

02:21:59.297 --> 02:22:02.299
Think about this very carefully, ladies and gentlemen, and work backwards.

02:22:03.259 --> 02:22:03.819
Get rid of 2025.

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:08.942
Forget about the fact that he went on Danny Jones and lied about Charles Rixey.

02:22:09.002 --> 02:22:12.523
Forget about the fact that he went on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

02:22:12.583 --> 02:22:22.127
Forget about the fact that we were on a stream together with Baldwin and Seneff and Rose, where I told him all of this shit and then he ignored it for a year.

02:22:22.187 --> 02:22:24.148
Forget about the fact that he was in front of the Senate.

02:22:24.588 --> 02:22:31.212
Forget about the fact that Kevin McCarran came to my house, or Rixey came to my house, or that he was on my stream in December of 2021.

02:22:32.633 --> 02:22:41.078
Forget about the fact that he was on that girl's podcast, and just think about the three times in 2020 that he was on the Vance Crowe podcast.

02:22:41.159 --> 02:22:48.643
Vance Crowe being a former World Bank employee who decided to go into podcasting at the start of the pandemic.

02:22:48.683 --> 02:22:52.606
And he went on, this is also before the Corman Jorstin review,

02:22:53.632 --> 02:23:00.401
He was out there in April of 2020, the same month that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:23:00.461 --> 02:23:06.169
was regaling everyone with the amazing history of Judy Mikovits.

02:23:06.209 --> 02:23:08.833
This guy is on a podcast with a former World Bank

02:23:10.225 --> 02:23:17.871
employee telling us all about how PCR can be used and how he uses it and how pot genomes can be sequenced and stuff.

02:23:18.551 --> 02:23:33.862
And then, because he didn't get it quite right or he's still rehearsing, he went on the stream again a month later and said the same thing, except now he was more sure that the FDA was in the way and causing the pandemic, because if they'd just get out of the way, we'd already have all this stuff done, testing and repurposed drugs and stuff.

02:23:35.253 --> 02:23:43.198
And then to make sure that this took, he also had to go again on the 30th of December, 2020 on the same guy's podcast to say the same shit again.

02:23:44.879 --> 02:23:48.521
There is a virus, it is spreading, but maybe it was here in October of 2019, who knows?

02:23:52.031 --> 02:23:54.714
And so then he goes on this other lady's podcast.

02:23:54.754 --> 02:23:58.719
This lady also has Meryl Nass on in the same year.

02:23:58.799 --> 02:24:00.060
So, you know, it's obvious, right?

02:24:00.121 --> 02:24:03.985
Once you start to see that we're in 2025 and all these other things have happened.

02:24:04.566 --> 02:24:12.195
If all of these other things have happened in the context of what started in 2020, there's no way to explain this as random.

02:24:14.974 --> 02:24:26.058
There's no way to explain the Corman-Jorston review in November of 2020, written with Claire Craig of heart, as being accidental, written with Mike Yeadon.

02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:35.321
There's no way to explain it, ladies and gentlemen, other than malevolence.

02:24:35.381 --> 02:24:36.701
These people are in on it.

02:24:37.682 --> 02:24:43.844
And that's why, after he spoke in front of the Senate, Mary Holland of CHD interviewed him about what he said.

02:24:48.115 --> 02:25:02.461
It's all one big show where these people have used acolytes on social media to hijack any meaningful anti-vax movement and turn it into a bullshit health freedom tent.

02:25:04.781 --> 02:25:13.625
A populist movement that could be used to move voters around, just like Polly did in the UK a decade ago.

02:25:15.592 --> 02:25:20.714
They discovered that the anti-vax movement could be a useful political movement, and they hijacked it.

02:25:20.834 --> 02:25:23.315
I think that Mark Kulak is probably right.

02:25:23.355 --> 02:25:25.236
That Bannon helped them hijack it.

02:25:25.816 --> 02:25:27.537
That Elon helped them hijack it.

02:25:27.577 --> 02:25:30.978
That Peter Thiel helped them hijack it.

02:25:33.139 --> 02:25:35.400
That Kevin McKernan helped them hijack it.

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:42.683
The vaccine schedule in America is criminal, and you can learn that by comparing it to any other vaccine schedule in the Western nations.

02:25:43.684 --> 02:25:44.084
Any of them.

02:25:44.104 --> 02:25:44.524
Just do it.

02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:50.703
I have a viewer right now who says she's making a Excel file to do that very thing.

02:25:50.763 --> 02:26:03.748
And once she has it done, I'm going to put it on my website because it's really important to understand that like an eclipse could be used to fool Indians into believing that you can communicate with God, a incoming

02:26:04.893 --> 02:26:27.337
Anticipated rise in all-cause mortality due to the large family size after World War II has been known for 20 years, and they have been positioning people, positioning programs, positioning legislation, and positioning influencers into position to take advantage of that biological phenomenon and turn it into something that could be a myth

02:26:28.021 --> 02:26:31.785
that could govern humans for generations to come.

02:26:31.865 --> 02:26:33.307
Do you understand what I'm saying?

02:26:33.847 --> 02:26:37.191
They took a phenomenon that they knew was coming.

02:26:38.072 --> 02:26:49.764
The pandemic took the population pyramid and an anticipated rise in all cause mortality and turned it into a mythology about how RNA can pandemic.

02:26:51.021 --> 02:26:58.965
and they did it using people on social media, something that was not available in previous exercises like the swine flu of 2009.

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:09.910
They did it using all of this social media that we have acquiesced to, that we all skillfully use as a way to get to the truth.

02:27:13.892 --> 02:27:18.795
The really, the thing that should wake everybody up on our side is to realize that if you think

02:27:19.645 --> 02:27:23.511
That you are following the right people when you are following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:27:23.571 --> 02:27:36.489
You are following Alex Jones and Glenn Beck and Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein and Sam Harris and all of these other shitheads.

02:27:37.517 --> 02:27:43.241
You're not following anybody smart or anybody insightful or anybody with an unblemished track record of integrity.

02:27:43.261 --> 02:27:52.887
You're following compromised people, people like Mary Holland, who have not managed to accomplish anything in the 10 plus years that they've been a public figure.

02:27:55.529 --> 02:28:03.654
You're following people who are leading you into the same trap that Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak are leading other people into.

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:15.928
The same trap that the view is leading other people into because you are being manipulated by these people who are engaged in a very lively debate within a very limited spectrum.

02:28:15.988 --> 02:28:21.332
And within that spectrum, you and your children and your grandchildren will be enslaved.

02:28:24.654 --> 02:28:30.398
That's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and why the murder stops and starts in two years.

02:28:31.379 --> 02:28:34.441
Why there was no useful questioning of this for those two years.

02:28:36.465 --> 02:28:38.888
because it was not a pandemic, it was murder.

02:28:39.008 --> 02:28:44.433
And it was murder that was on the background of an anticipated rise in expected deaths.

02:28:44.474 --> 02:28:50.920
So a lot of these people were gonna die, but they had to sweep them together with murder in order to create these sharp peaks.

02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:52.762
Otherwise, these sharp peaks wouldn't be there.

02:28:52.802 --> 02:28:56.386
This would just slowly rise in a slope like this.

02:28:56.787 --> 02:28:57.728
It would rise like that.

02:28:58.188 --> 02:29:04.030
But instead they had to create these sharp peaks with murder because that's what they pointed to in 2020.

02:29:04.351 --> 02:29:05.311
Look at the curve here.

02:29:05.671 --> 02:29:10.713
If we extrapolate from this using even conservative models, it looks like a billion people are going to die.

02:29:13.774 --> 02:29:14.995
And so that's how this happened.

02:29:15.035 --> 02:29:25.279
An expected rise in an anticipated rise in expected deaths was sculpted using murder and sophisticated liars to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

02:29:25.319 --> 02:29:27.260
And people like Tony Fauci knew it.

02:29:28.877 --> 02:29:29.938
Rick Bright knew it.

02:29:30.758 --> 02:29:31.638
They all knew it.

02:29:31.699 --> 02:29:32.539
Kadlec knew it.

02:29:32.579 --> 02:29:33.419
They all know it.

02:29:36.141 --> 02:29:39.483
And I would argue that also Robert Malone knows it.

02:29:40.663 --> 02:29:42.004
Kevin McCairn knows it.

02:29:42.064 --> 02:29:43.264
Charles Rixey knows it.

02:29:43.305 --> 02:29:46.046
And if they don't, then they're just ignorant.

02:29:47.025 --> 02:29:57.767
They're just bamboozled or they're just taking a paycheck because there is no way there is a novel virus going around the world in light of this list of ways that people were murdered in 2020.

02:29:58.148 --> 02:30:01.848
There's no way to explain away all of these.

02:30:02.228 --> 02:30:08.370
The math is there's nothing left for anything to be killed by a virus when this was going on in 2020.

02:30:11.397 --> 02:30:16.919
And that's why it was so important for these people to be present, so that we would solve the mystery of the novel virus.

02:30:17.019 --> 02:30:21.821
These people enacted the dinner theater that's still going on now.

02:30:23.022 --> 02:30:35.787
In Steve Kirsch's steering committee, and in signal chats about Bitcoin, and in private Zoom meetings, and in steering committees, and in writing committees, and in chapters of books, it's all the same shit.

02:30:37.642 --> 02:30:45.106
That's why all of these organizations that have formed in the last five years have never stumbled upon Brandy's message like I have.

02:30:45.787 --> 02:30:47.428
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:30:47.508 --> 02:30:49.769
And after I gave it to them, they have ignored it.

02:30:50.769 --> 02:30:56.933
The same way they ignored Brandy when she was saying it, they ignore me because that's their job.

02:30:57.213 --> 02:30:58.654
That's the system.

02:30:59.074 --> 02:31:00.175
That's the trap we're in.

02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:08.942
And no matter how succinctly I say it, they're gonna ignore it the same way they ignored Brandy and the same way they ignored Polly before the pandemic.

02:31:10.663 --> 02:31:14.244
The same reason why Polly's not saying it like she said it before Brandy died.

02:31:15.105 --> 02:31:17.705
Because it is real.

02:31:18.306 --> 02:31:19.586
There is no safe vaccine.

02:31:20.086 --> 02:31:23.607
The intramuscular injection of medicine is a lie.

02:31:26.508 --> 02:31:27.589
Brandy said it before me.

02:31:28.871 --> 02:31:33.094
Polly kind of understood it, I think, because Brandy told her and explained it to her.

02:31:33.154 --> 02:31:35.936
And the rest of these people are just liars and traitors.

02:31:36.396 --> 02:31:40.338
James Lyons Weiler, Judy Mickiewicz, Robert Malone.

02:31:41.119 --> 02:31:46.322
These are the worst kind of Americans because they are participating in the enslavement, not of us.

02:31:47.743 --> 02:31:49.024
We're just being fooled.

02:31:49.884 --> 02:31:52.206
They are helping to enslave our grandchildren.

02:31:55.543 --> 02:31:57.224
And so you want to know how to figure it out?

02:31:57.604 --> 02:31:59.766
You got to make a calendar of your favorite heroes.

02:32:00.906 --> 02:32:01.727
And then you will see it.

02:32:03.048 --> 02:32:05.209
Make a list of what they were saying and how they said it.

02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:09.371
And realize that a lot of them knew who Brandy was and have never told you.

02:32:12.994 --> 02:32:15.595
Realize that Americans' grandchildren deserve the truth.

02:32:17.776 --> 02:32:20.298
They deserve to know what these people did and how they did it.

02:32:21.482 --> 02:32:23.183
And there is an easy way to explain it.

02:32:23.223 --> 02:32:28.025
And it's not those substacks about some false dichotomy or some shit like that.

02:32:28.085 --> 02:32:29.706
They fooled us into solving a mystery.

02:32:30.626 --> 02:32:33.067
And by solving that mystery, we accepted the monsters.

02:32:34.648 --> 02:32:36.709
Ladies and gentlemen, this is for all the marbles.

02:32:36.749 --> 02:32:38.109
You want to tell your kids the truth?

02:32:38.189 --> 02:32:43.292
Tell them that there's a huge difference between ingesting a pharmaceutical and injecting it.

02:32:44.552 --> 02:32:50.395
And for some reason, the injected pharmaceuticals are completely void of liability.

02:32:51.488 --> 02:32:52.749
if they're called vaccines.

02:32:53.749 --> 02:33:01.792
Explain that to your kid and explain that as why these people exist in the first place is to make sure that this truth never gets out.

02:33:03.133 --> 02:33:07.335
Ladies and gentlemen, you can also explain to your kid that PCR is a diagnostic, is a fraud.

02:33:08.188 --> 02:33:19.873
You can explain to your kids that the only thing that these pharmaceutical companies have ever had is synthetic recombinant genetics, using DNA in cell cultures to make a lot of DNA.

02:33:20.293 --> 02:33:22.534
And from there, they can make protein biologics.

02:33:22.894 --> 02:33:25.435
They could also make RNA, but it can't be made pure.

02:33:26.465 --> 02:33:29.286
can't be made well, can just be made in quantity.

02:33:29.326 --> 02:33:31.606
And that quantity can be detected by PCR.

02:33:31.646 --> 02:33:33.527
So they can make it and they can put it places.

02:33:33.987 --> 02:33:39.669
And that means that they could have told their agent in Wuhan to claim that she found a sequence that they wanted her to find.

02:33:40.229 --> 02:33:43.550
And that would give them an excuse to transfect everybody to that sequence.

02:33:43.650 --> 02:33:44.370
It's that simple.

02:33:45.250 --> 02:33:46.391
And Robert Malone knows it.

02:33:46.431 --> 02:33:47.771
And Mike Callahan knows it.

02:33:47.851 --> 02:33:49.591
And Sina Bavari knows it.

02:33:49.631 --> 02:33:50.732
And David Hone knows it.

02:33:52.292 --> 02:33:53.172
Rick Bright knows it.

02:33:54.013 --> 02:33:55.073
Peter Daszak knows it.

02:33:56.089 --> 02:33:59.172
Charles Rixey knows it, Robert Malone knows it, they all know it.

02:33:59.632 --> 02:34:02.875
They all know that transfection was always a crime from the very beginning.

02:34:04.136 --> 02:34:06.678
And a lot of these people know that I've been saying that since 2020.

02:34:07.619 --> 02:34:10.862
A lot of these people know that's why I lost my job at the University of Pittsburgh.

02:34:11.322 --> 02:34:16.267
And a lot of people know the easiest way to pull this off would have been to roll out placebo.

02:34:16.767 --> 02:34:21.011
In fact, placebo may be a way that the current vaccine schedule is also protected.

02:34:21.954 --> 02:34:27.156
By rolling out a significant number of placebos, you don't have to worry as much about a signal.

02:34:28.277 --> 02:34:30.958
And since they don't work anyway, what's there to lose?

02:34:32.699 --> 02:34:38.101
I think this is probably one of the biggest lies that was ever told and is still being told today.

02:34:39.142 --> 02:34:41.623
Another big lie is the idea of endemicity.

02:34:41.663 --> 02:34:49.226
This is the concept that if you put a RNA in a mud puddle, that if it's the right RNA, that it could go from there to being in the background forever.

02:34:50.216 --> 02:34:52.557
like coronaviruses are in the background forever.

02:34:53.558 --> 02:34:59.581
And this idea, this biological principle is a foundational myth of virology that needs to be broken.

02:35:02.259 --> 02:35:07.101
just like the idea that PCR is a real high-fidelity measurement and not just a noise measurement.

02:35:07.721 --> 02:35:09.402
RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen.

02:35:09.422 --> 02:35:12.523
The way they did it was placebo and non-specific PCR tests.

02:35:12.983 --> 02:35:15.684
Intramuscular injection is dumb, just like Brandy said it was.

02:35:16.684 --> 02:35:19.485
There is no easy way to say this, guys.

02:35:19.645 --> 02:35:25.447
We are in big trouble because we have been led to believe something that we probably should not believe.

02:35:28.324 --> 02:35:36.810
And it's because there was a biological phenomenon called the population pyramid that they could bamboozle us with and a bunch of coordinated liars on the internet.

02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:46.816
It's not a fun message, but it's a hopeful one because I just see all these little happy accidents, little happy accidents, really very impressive.

02:35:46.856 --> 02:35:54.401
But if we don't realize that they're not just little happy accidents, the past will fade into mist and that past will be erased.

02:35:55.524 --> 02:35:58.906
erasure will be forgotten by our kids, and this lie will become the truth.

02:35:59.346 --> 02:36:00.466
We can't let that happen.

02:36:04.889 --> 02:36:06.689
Please don't let that happen, ladies and gentlemen.

02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:07.730
I love you very much.

02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:08.811
Thank you for being here.

02:36:08.971 --> 02:36:12.492
I'll see you again, maybe not tomorrow, but Thursday for sure.

02:37:59.653 --> 02:38:01.355
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

02:38:01.375 --> 02:38:02.737
I will see you again soon.

02:38:02.937 --> 02:38:04.899
JC on the hardwood has not stopped.

02:38:04.979 --> 02:38:09.465
It's just that I'm getting myself in better shape, because I'm not going to make a fool of myself when I do it for real.

02:38:10.426 --> 02:38:13.450
So give me a couple more weeks on that, and then that's also going to start.

02:38:13.490 --> 02:38:14.491
Thank you very much for being here.

02:38:14.531 --> 02:38:15.292
I'll see you again soon.
