WEBVTT

00:17.267 --> 00:17.368
Mm.

00:47.657 --> 00:47.718
Mm.

01:39.704 --> 01:39.825
you

03:11.639 --> 03:17.487
Isle is the roughest place I've ever been

03:55.976 --> 03:57.638
I heard a woman scream.

03:59.821 --> 04:08.532
Then I peeped through the door.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.074
Some gal was wiggin' on that ass.

04:28.188 --> 04:35.936
That is the roughest place I've ever been.

04:36.377 --> 04:40.181
All the people down there

05:25.214 --> 05:46.341
Somebody killed a crapshooter cause he didn't run Shake, right and wrong Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

06:03.405 --> 06:13.270
All the people down there Killin' for their whiskey, wine and gin

07:58.283 --> 08:00.165
Said there's a red boy now.

08:04.088 --> 08:06.511
Lord, nobody wrong.

08:08.032 --> 08:16.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:17.881 --> 08:19.663
Alley's the roughest place.

08:36.670 --> 08:46.032
Yeah, they took me away from that alley Lord, they took me right back to the bed

09:06.219 --> 09:31.106
Alright, let's get this started.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.126
I'm very excited.

09:32.146 --> 09:34.227
Let's check over here quick.

09:35.484 --> 09:39.446
I see one person waiting, so we should be really ready to go.

09:42.447 --> 09:43.027
Five minutes.

09:44.147 --> 09:49.870
Five minutes and it's 15 after the 15th hour of the day starting up.

09:54.231 --> 09:55.692
Very excited, ladies and gentlemen.

09:55.732 --> 09:58.813
I'm very excited for today because I don't have to work very hard.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.294
I just have to watch these two

10:03.106 --> 10:18.486
have to watch these two guys come together and talk about the things that they've found over the last couple years and it's gonna be a really exciting place for me to sit in on and so just let me make sure everything gets fixed and situated here and we're ready to go.

10:30.990 --> 10:35.152
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

10:37.093 --> 10:38.654
I think truth is good for kids.

10:39.094 --> 10:42.856
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.997
We want everybody to feel good.

10:45.137 --> 10:47.379
That's not, that's not the way life is.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.762
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

10:55.592 --> 10:56.294
And I have lied.

10:56.314 --> 10:57.356
I'm sure I'll lie again.

10:57.376 --> 10:58.319
I don't want to lie.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.163
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

11:00.263 --> 11:01.305
I try not to be a liar.

11:01.325 --> 11:02.167
I don't want to be a liar.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.455
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

11:21.111 --> 11:22.992
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

11:23.092 --> 11:24.492
His name is J.J.

11:24.632 --> 11:28.394
Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for C.H.D.

11:29.254 --> 11:31.415
and I believe he has a P.H.D.

11:31.435 --> 11:36.017
in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

11:41.733 --> 11:41.793
I'm

12:09.614 --> 12:10.975
you.

12:35.205 --> 12:42.791
Hey, it looks like the stands are starting to fill up slowly in the gym and we are ready for the show.

12:42.852 --> 12:51.739
The Enchantment is about to take a serious blow to the broadside today as we try to move forward and we've been working on the biology.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.641
Other people have been working on the history and today we have two

12:56.063 --> 13:10.735
Let's just call them armchair historians that have have found their stride during the pandemic because of the nature of the pandemic's narrative because of the way that whoa whoa whoa something's scooping around I bet somebody connected back there.

13:10.755 --> 13:16.721
We're gonna have to do a sound check and we'll do the sound check and then if it's not right we're just gonna start over again and that'll be fine.

13:18.442 --> 13:20.163
One of our guests is named Mark Kulak.

13:20.323 --> 13:22.084
He's based in the United States.

13:22.484 --> 13:29.027
He is an analyst with a long career in the computer data storage industry.

13:30.447 --> 13:39.372
And the other fellow that's joining us is actually a historian from Germany who does a lot of his work on Substack and had a recent

13:40.552 --> 13:47.818
collaboration with CHD and Veera Sharav in trying to put out the movie and the book called Never Again is Now.

13:48.879 --> 13:55.604
And so these two gentlemen are going to join me in just a few minutes to discuss the current state of the narrative, so to speak.

13:57.145 --> 14:00.087
And I do really think that is the current state of the narrative.

14:00.828 --> 14:05.452
None of the three people that you will see discussing these ideas today are under the

14:07.273 --> 14:09.293
under the illusion that they know the truth.

14:10.354 --> 14:15.115
We are to think I am mainly in agreement that the truth is not available for free on television.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.916
And in fact, the truth may not be available for free on.

14:21.376 --> 14:24.397
It may also not be available for free on social media, at least.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.517
Why is this not advancing?

14:26.597 --> 14:29.398
This would be a very good assumption to start under.

14:31.687 --> 14:32.888
And so that's what we're going to do today.

14:32.928 --> 14:35.991
We're going to try and learn a little bit of our history before it's erased forever.

14:36.051 --> 14:40.896
And we're going to learn a little bit about what each of these guys have kind of separately stumbled upon.

14:40.916 --> 14:46.401
It kind of lines up to helping us understand how it is that we've actually inherited.

14:47.282 --> 14:55.984
these charlatans and how our history can help us understand how we inherited governance by charlatan because that's really where we are.

14:56.024 --> 15:13.628
We are trapped in governance by charlatan and if we're going to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of governance by charlatan, it's going to take people around the world who are able to stay focused on the biology and not take the bait on television and love their neighbors.

15:14.488 --> 15:19.289
because this is a wave of coordinated lying that's been going on for generations.

15:20.289 --> 15:27.511
And so if we want to teach our children to surf this wave with the real truth, we've got to be able to show them the direction to surf.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.331
We've got to be able to show them how to ride.

15:29.351 --> 15:39.093
We've got to be able to show them the people who are coordinated, coordinatedly lying to create this wave that's entrapped us.

15:39.113 --> 15:41.434
And that's what Giga Home Biological is really all about.

15:43.959 --> 15:47.422
It's hard to believe that this next slide is like almost four years old.

15:48.683 --> 15:52.106
But if you are here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

15:52.146 --> 15:59.793
And if not, you might be a skilled TV watcher who needs to be reminded to stay focused on the biology, needs to be told not to take their bait.

15:59.853 --> 16:02.916
It's still not really working very well, so I'm not sure what's going on.

16:02.956 --> 16:04.777
I have the feeling it's Zoom doing that.

16:05.418 --> 16:08.180
So we are going to have to switch out soon.

16:09.501 --> 16:10.122
And that'll be good.

16:12.523 --> 16:15.045
I don't think the computer really likes it.

16:15.065 --> 16:15.886
So this is how it works.

16:15.926 --> 16:19.428
People share this stream and then people find out about it.

16:19.509 --> 16:25.693
So if you're not busy sharing it, maybe take the time right now to tweet it out or put it up on Facebook or whatever you do.

16:25.713 --> 16:27.495
That would be really great.

16:29.296 --> 16:40.724
and you can find us at GigaOMBiological.com but that's not really important right now because we have two other people that we are trying to make you more familiar with and I want to get there as quick as possible.

16:41.245 --> 16:44.947
I'm sure they're already annoyed with the introduction here.

16:46.148 --> 16:48.750
Let's just play this really quick and we'll be there.

16:50.609 --> 16:57.191
I think it is kind of exciting though that this paradigm shift is about to occur and we're gonna be around for it.

16:57.211 --> 17:00.812
We're gonna be around for it and be able to share it with our children in real time.

17:01.332 --> 17:05.213
And that's what's really gonna be necessary as these changes occur.

17:05.233 --> 17:12.455
We're gonna have to be able to share the informed noncompliance with our children and teach them how to engage in it for the rest of their lifetime.

17:13.956 --> 17:14.836
So yeah, that's the plan.

17:18.590 --> 17:18.790
do

17:43.240 --> 17:46.822
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

17:46.942 --> 17:47.822
That looks good.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.163
Let's see if we can get this right away.

17:50.183 --> 17:52.044
I'm a human just like you.

17:52.585 --> 17:57.647
Don't forget intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

17:57.687 --> 18:01.509
The transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

18:02.089 --> 18:05.491
We are trying to stop the spread of bad ideas by promoting people with good ones.

18:05.571 --> 18:07.792
So today I've got two very special guests.

18:09.873 --> 18:13.719
Mark Kulak and Uwe Altschner.

18:15.521 --> 18:18.065
I don't know if they're both in the Zoom already.

18:18.225 --> 18:19.026
Oh, they are.

18:19.086 --> 18:20.408
Look how convenient that is.

18:20.428 --> 18:22.311
I'm just going to hit escape.

18:23.131 --> 18:24.893
Let me get over here and hit escape.

18:25.414 --> 18:32.221
And I don't know if they'll be able to see themselves the way I see them, which may be slightly unhandy for them at times.

18:32.301 --> 18:34.784
But I don't know what you guys see when I do this.

18:34.884 --> 18:36.947
I hope you see yourselves up in the corner there.

18:37.047 --> 18:37.467
Okay, good.

18:38.028 --> 18:39.109
So welcome, gentlemen.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.350
Welcome to the show.

18:41.472 --> 18:52.222
I think it's important first for me to just clarify where you're coming from and who you are and not dig too far into the details because we could go into either of your backgrounds for 20 minutes.

18:52.983 --> 18:58.549
What I want to get to right away is of course where your stories have come together very recently with regard to Hilary Kaprowski.

18:59.289 --> 19:00.991
And of course, I also want you to meet each other.

19:01.031 --> 19:10.659
So let me just very quickly switch over here and just say very quickly, these guys can be found here.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.282
First, you have the substack, never again.

19:15.063 --> 19:16.384
is now global.

19:17.045 --> 19:24.973
You shouldn't confuse that with some other substacks that are out there that are associated with a very similar theme like never again is now etc.

19:24.993 --> 19:31.099
These are all probably and maybe Uwe at some point can say something about it but these are all probably

19:31.940 --> 19:56.870
interesting places to look to but for now we're featuring his and it is again Never Again is now global on Substack and you are all those of you have been here for a while are also very familiar with Housatonic Mark Kulak at housatonicits.com and this is of course the front page of his website and so without further ado gentlemen

19:58.416 --> 19:59.317
Welcome to the show.

19:59.457 --> 20:07.921
I know you guys know each other kind of through me, but, you know, welcome and I'm so happy you guys can finally be introduced.

20:08.181 --> 20:24.750
Maybe it's easier because Mark and I talk more often that you start in Germany and just kind of give maybe a short through the corner version of why you ended up texting me this morning with an audio message and why you were so excited to talk to Mark.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.671
Thanks again for joining, by the way.

20:29.474 --> 20:30.074
Oh, you're muted.

20:31.095 --> 20:31.395
Sorry.

20:33.596 --> 20:34.357
Yeah, sorry.

20:34.877 --> 20:35.337
Can you hear me?

20:35.518 --> 20:35.718
Yep.

20:37.259 --> 20:39.960
So thank you, JJ.

20:40.020 --> 20:43.302
And thank you, Mark, for having me on.

20:43.362 --> 20:43.883
It's an honor.

20:45.764 --> 20:50.086
I have been following both of your work for the better part of

20:51.966 --> 21:01.611
almost two years now, which came about because I worked together with Vera Sharaf on the project Never Again is Now Global.

21:02.291 --> 21:09.395
And that's also why my substack has come to be termed neveragainisnowglobal.substack.com.

21:09.415 --> 21:14.497
So this is something which I started, and it was clear that it was my substack to

21:16.858 --> 21:18.118
some attention towards me.

21:18.538 --> 21:19.059
I'm German.

21:19.079 --> 21:19.859
I'm a historian.

21:20.399 --> 21:28.381
I've got a background in politics, but I left very early in the beginning of the 2000s.

21:28.661 --> 21:37.643
So working inside politics and since then I've been consulting the pandemic or what is called the pandemic has destroyed my business and I've been trying to

21:38.981 --> 21:47.509
reinvent myself and stay afloat whilst also providing information for my fellow Germans.

21:48.490 --> 21:53.916
So I've been doing translation during almost all of 2020.

21:53.956 --> 21:59.641
I had very senior people on my show, translated the whole thing into German.

22:00.262 --> 22:03.024
And that's how I came in touch with CHD.

22:04.846 --> 22:05.967
and with Vera Sharaf.

22:06.207 --> 22:21.461
Vera Sharaf was on my German blog and in April 2021 it was when I asked her for an interview about the situation I was observing from Israel and in this interview which we did

22:22.082 --> 22:26.884
Vera said something to the tune of, this could be the beginning of the Fourth Reich.

22:26.984 --> 22:34.287
And as a German and as a historian, I've been trained to be very, very cautious in making comparisons with the Holocaust.

22:34.447 --> 22:38.829
So I was immediately almost taken aback and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:39.530 --> 22:42.631
But of course, this was a Holocaust survivor who was talking to me.

22:42.691 --> 22:47.413
So therefore, I knew that she would also be well aware of what she was saying.

22:49.494 --> 22:58.579
this triggered me to do more research on what I thought I knew, but I didn't, in fact, because history is something quite different.

23:00.300 --> 23:08.564
So history, the way it is taught in school and university is something quite different from the real history, which is an evolving

23:10.205 --> 23:11.246
organism, basically.

23:11.366 --> 23:21.353
It's something like science, where evidence comes to light and has to be reintroduced and reassessed permanently.

23:21.473 --> 23:30.859
So the history of the Second World War, the rise of the Nazis and all this had to be revisited.

23:31.399 --> 23:35.222
And I have come to understand that the history is completely different.

23:36.703 --> 23:38.905
from what it is we've been taught.

23:38.945 --> 23:41.867
So this is basically where I've been coming from.

23:42.287 --> 24:03.004
And when I saw Mark's most recent show on Joseph Mengele, Hilary Koprowski in the Vatican, this was of course something which I immediately connected to because this was the fact which I was researching for our joint project, which Vera and I had

24:03.652 --> 24:06.414
have been doing until November of last year.

24:06.434 --> 24:14.321
So I'm not working anymore with Vera Sharap, which I do regret, but it is something which I also in some way also

24:15.569 --> 24:21.551
Now I'm relieved of some burden because I can focus on my own work.

24:21.571 --> 24:30.274
And Mark has pointed out very, very important connections, not just in this respect, but also in this respect.

24:30.294 --> 24:44.879
And that's why I reached out to you and said, look, I think we should get on a show together and discuss various aspects of what Mark has been drawing attention to yesterday and the day before.

24:45.703 --> 24:57.110
And Mark, can you give us a one minute or two minute synopsis of what you've been drawing attention to over the last, I mean, I know those shows are very long and they're detailed, but I know you're also pretty good at giving a kind of overview.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.512
And so as best you can, at least just try and help us out.

25:02.953 --> 25:03.233
Sure.

25:04.754 --> 25:10.558
First, I do also have the URL, Housatonic.live, so you can go directly to there.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.004
And it's a pleasure to meet you, Yvette.

25:13.845 --> 25:18.307
Thank you for actually having shared and highlighted some of my work.

25:18.387 --> 25:19.648
Not too many people do that.

25:21.569 --> 25:32.095
It helps me reach my end goal, which is to get whatever information out there that we can, and hopefully get me out of the middle, because I don't actually want to be in the middle.

25:32.115 --> 25:38.259
That was not my desire several years ago when I started on this particular endeavor.

25:38.279 --> 25:39.720
And I think we all have our own reasons.

25:42.311 --> 26:09.822
It was, of course, and this isn't our own words, it's very clear that a large component of the COVID-19 is data collection and potentially utilizing the resources that are available, potentially resources that will be disappearing in the future, to understand or to potentially shed some light on how the machinery of the human organism

26:11.377 --> 26:11.837
operates.

26:13.038 --> 26:16.659
It may never actually happen, but you got to start somewhere.

26:17.719 --> 26:26.623
And I suspect that this data collection has been ongoing, or the infrastructure that has to attain this has been put in place.

26:27.523 --> 26:31.444
The idea of what needed to be collected has changed over the last several decades.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.446
And there are

26:37.699 --> 26:57.813
academic lineages of some of the most important people in virology and immunology and genetics over the last 40 or 50 years, which connect very directly to people who have been hosting and leading conferences at the Vatican, as well as to interests or, how to say, experiments

27:02.776 --> 27:05.338
camps, et cetera, that were in World War II Germany.

27:05.938 --> 27:10.040
And it's a subject that I felt very uncomfortable actually exploring.

27:11.881 --> 27:12.582
What could I know?

27:12.622 --> 27:16.184
I'm not really a historian, but I can follow the clues.

27:17.225 --> 27:22.808
And sometimes, and this is actually a window of time that actually will not last forever for me, right?

27:23.288 --> 27:25.930
We have an opportunity where sometimes someone can come along

27:26.687 --> 27:31.949
with enough capability, but perhaps enough naivety to ask slightly different questions.

27:32.429 --> 27:36.770
Eventually, I'm going to fall into a box, too, where I'll have a difficult time getting out.

27:36.810 --> 27:44.073
But at the moment, I've been able to look at these connections and go, you know, there's just far too close a connection here.

27:45.113 --> 27:46.754
This isn't four levels deep.

27:46.794 --> 27:48.975
This is quite literally the

27:51.682 --> 27:52.582
the same individuals.

27:53.023 --> 28:15.870
In some cases, just like, and I have much to thank for, of all people, and I suspect he's not a very bright bulb, Stanley Prusiner of the, how to say, Nobel laureate, misfolded protein fame, because he just wrote, I think, more than anyone wanted him to write upon the passing of Hilary Koprowski.

28:16.816 --> 28:21.378
And he just shared a lot of details about how close he was with the Vatican and his access.

28:21.438 --> 28:33.702
And I would suspect that if Kiprowski is who the person who I think, and I think you may be suspecting is Yuve, I'm not sure Kiprowski would have wanted that written, but he was gone by that time.

28:34.202 --> 28:42.145
So the memoirs are out there and then you start revisiting things and it would make sense if it was possible.

28:43.095 --> 28:52.318
If it was possible, as we have been told, to commit the atrocities of World War II, and I'm not, I'm only questioning the nature of them and some of the motivations, right?

28:53.039 --> 29:00.321
Then why not just scale that up to ever-increasing populations if the people back then were never caught, really?

29:01.181 --> 29:02.762
Almost all of them were allowed to go free.

29:04.343 --> 29:10.225
I have a lot of questions, none of them questions that people should have asked.

29:11.872 --> 29:17.275
I would be more than happy to be shut up and go away if someone could just resolve these things in a way that makes sense.

29:17.315 --> 29:18.936
So that's where I'm at right now.

29:19.696 --> 29:31.582
And I think there's much I could benefit from working with someone who has been deep in the history, such as yourself, Yvette, because I'm reaching the end of some of my, at least, capabilities right now.

29:31.602 --> 29:33.623
And I think you could help expedite that dramatically.

29:33.643 --> 29:34.704
So thank you for reaching out.

29:38.385 --> 29:39.326
Sure, sure.

29:39.786 --> 29:44.431
JJ, how do you want to have this conversation?

29:44.491 --> 29:50.457
Are you going to ask questions or do you want us to just spit out our thoughts?

29:50.497 --> 29:59.986
Yeah, how about you just start with, you know, kind of what you told me in the audio message about what you'd found and why you think Mark would be interested in it, and then we'll see how Mark responds.

30:00.646 --> 30:00.886
Yes.

30:01.607 --> 30:20.557
And for props, if I may, for the benefit of the audience, every once in a while here or there, if there's a name or a concept that perhaps most people would be just unaware of, feel free to spend an extra minute, not extensively, but just to highlight who this person is or that company is or whatever.

30:21.158 --> 30:23.539
We'll assume that there's a mid-level of knowledge here.

30:23.559 --> 30:25.340
Right.

30:27.109 --> 30:37.460
So in your recent video about Mengele and Koprowski, you said something to the effect that you weren't sure whether the two actually met.

30:38.061 --> 30:45.528
So Mengele lived on until at least 1979 and maybe even longer, as you speculate rightly, because we don't know.

30:45.648 --> 30:48.611
And it's fair to assume that it may just have been

30:50.733 --> 30:55.016
something which we were led to believe for other things to happen.

30:55.276 --> 30:56.217
This is speculation.

30:56.257 --> 31:05.843
And I also applaud you for making very clear where you speculate and where evidence is available to really pin things down.

31:06.824 --> 31:13.448
But in this video, you also asked about whether that you could, correct me if I'm wrong, but that you could not really

31:14.048 --> 31:25.214
a fathom that those guys had been working on their own in Auschwitz and not having gotten support from outside or reported and stuff.

31:25.274 --> 31:36.840
And this is something where I can contribute that indeed there was a reporting which happened from Auschwitz, from Mengele to his

31:38.381 --> 31:40.802
mentor, which was Otmar von Verschuur.

31:41.282 --> 31:48.623
He was a professor in Frankfurt and in Berlin at an institute which was funded by Rockefeller.

31:49.483 --> 31:52.144
So there you have it.

31:52.484 --> 31:53.524
First of all, I apologize.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.244
How was the last name spelled?

31:56.625 --> 31:57.205
Verschuur.

31:57.225 --> 32:01.406
So it's V-E-R-S-C-H-U-E-R.

32:01.426 --> 32:02.526
Otmar.

32:04.071 --> 32:19.543
I am not familiar with that name at all, but you, so Mengele was, and I haven't, I'm not sure Mengele was really a extensively educated virologist or immunologist.

32:19.584 --> 32:28.611
I think he had more of a director role, although I think he was also hands-on, as some people have suggested, but, and he wasn't really that old in World War II either.

32:29.321 --> 32:32.504
I think he was only in his 30s or maybe 40 years old, maybe.

32:32.644 --> 32:33.744
Yeah, yeah.

32:33.845 --> 32:39.189
So he was a very young man when he wrote his dissertation in 1936, I think it was.

32:39.349 --> 32:45.313
And he, as I said, he was a pupil of Otmar von Verschuur, who was a good geneticist.

32:45.633 --> 32:46.654
And of course, this

32:47.995 --> 33:09.257
sorry there you go geneticist that's a key word right exactly so so and there we have we had the connection to the eugenics issue which was at the heart of what vera sharaf and i were researching trying to understand where this came from this belief in you know good genes and bad genes and and and stuff which you want to

33:10.477 --> 33:16.619
promulgate and others which you want to suppress in a population, which was not German.

33:17.719 --> 33:21.980
It comes from basically from Darwin.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.001
So it's a form of social Darwinism.

33:24.481 --> 33:29.082
It's British in essence, but it's spread all around the world.

33:30.049 --> 33:39.535
I was very popular with very, very wealthy people, very powerful people, people we would today maybe call oligarchs.

33:39.855 --> 33:45.779
They wanted and they believed in a superiority of their kind.

33:48.221 --> 33:55.467
then you will have, of course, the Nazis, and I'm far from relativizing any of what the Nazis did.

33:57.108 --> 34:08.057
But it is essential to understand that they did not fall from the sky, that it was a connection which dated back also to connections to Britain.

34:08.758 --> 34:12.141
So Occult History, I can recommend a very good book about

34:13.161 --> 34:29.907
The Empire in Which the Black Sun Never Set, which is by Cynthia Chung, who is Canadian, and who has done extensive research on this whole ideological, but also scientific background of this kind of worldview.

34:29.987 --> 34:40.431
So this is what we were researching when Vera Sharaf said that what is happening now might be something

34:41.593 --> 34:47.798
designed to continue what was left unfinished at the end of World War II.

34:47.838 --> 34:49.139
And these are Vera's words.

34:49.299 --> 34:54.183
It's nothing which I would have ever thought, but Vera is a survivor of the Holocaust.

34:54.783 --> 35:10.035
And as per the presidential commission, so Jimmy Carter in 1979, he installed a commission to give recommendation on proper remembrance of the Holocaust.

35:11.015 --> 35:17.376
and also recommendations on how to best prevent another Holocaust from recurring.

35:17.456 --> 35:22.257
This commission was led by Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel.

35:22.377 --> 35:37.660
In this report, which they handed to Jimmy Carter in the Rose Garden in 1979, it is said that especially the survivors have a responsibility which they owe to the dead to call out any

35:38.553 --> 35:42.916
danger of anything of that kind ever recurring again.

35:43.136 --> 35:45.838
So this is something which people need to understand.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.700
So it's not at all any trivialization.

35:49.880 --> 36:00.687
It is the survivors themselves who feel entrusted with an obligation to do vigilant observation of what is going on all over the world.

36:01.727 --> 36:08.271
And that's what Vera Sharaf has been doing for all of her life, which I respect immensely.

36:08.611 --> 36:11.933
She's a very, very brave woman.

36:12.474 --> 36:17.397
And I was privileged to work with her for a couple of years.

36:17.477 --> 36:22.800
And I'm still committed to trying to shed light to what has been going on.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.262
Now, going back to what you unearthed, of course, Mark, is

36:26.642 --> 36:32.550
the fact that there have been those connections to the oligarchs from the West

36:33.393 --> 36:43.681
the Rockefellers and others, DuPont, and then all those people who had also close ties to fascism, not only in Germany, but in the US.

36:43.781 --> 36:56.931
I mean, remember the Bankers Plot, the Wall Street Plot, which failed under General Smedley Butler, who was hired to eventually

36:58.032 --> 37:00.274
dethroned Franklin D. Roosevelt.

37:00.454 --> 37:07.540
This is something which is a fact, which has been covered up, as many other things also have been covered up.

37:08.040 --> 37:24.333
One of this has been the connections between the research which was done in Nazi Germany, which came into Nazi Germany from places such as the US, where many eugenic laws had been implemented in the 20s already.

37:25.654 --> 37:27.216
for sterilization and stuff.

37:27.316 --> 37:35.006
And this was continued in a way in Nazi Germany and especially in Auschwitz.

37:35.046 --> 37:39.512
And you have pointed out even the economic dimension of

37:40.413 --> 38:01.568
what that meant, how valuable, I mean, it's very hard for me to use this language, but it's right what you said, because it was in their eyes, so those who did this work and those who funded the work, it was a matter of value for them to do research into understanding

38:03.229 --> 38:08.935
the genetics of life and to draw conclusions for their purposes.

38:09.516 --> 38:16.804
Today, we still don't know exactly what those purposes are, what their goal is, because they never

38:17.759 --> 38:26.342
really speak it out completely, but we can make assumptions and we can make deductions from evidence we find.

38:26.422 --> 38:36.266
And one of these evidences is as regards to Koprowski and people he was involved with, you also mentioned Lederberg, Joshua Lederberg.

38:37.366 --> 38:41.388
And in this respect, I find it very, very interesting that in 1962,

38:43.226 --> 38:53.033
There had been a conference in London, which was organized by the Ciba company, which is a Swiss company that was named... Ciba Geigy.

38:53.493 --> 38:55.294
Ciba Geigy, sometimes they're called.

38:55.454 --> 38:55.734
Right.

38:55.935 --> 39:00.678
And since they've ceased to exist under this name, they are now Novartis.

39:02.300 --> 39:18.398
But Geigy and Sieber were two Swiss companies which merged to Sieber-Geigy, and they have been also heavily involved in dealing with the Nazis and providing all sorts of chemicals and stuff which was also used for the war effort.

39:19.284 --> 39:41.470
And this, just as an aside, this went on with the full knowledge of the Allies, at least with the full knowledge of the Allies intelligence, which of course, as pertains to Europe, was controlled by Alan Dulles, who was the OSS head of operations in Bern.

39:41.750 --> 39:45.311
And he knew all this because he was also a lawyer

39:46.351 --> 39:50.233
And his brother was a lawyer in the firm of Sullivan and Cromwell.

39:50.733 --> 40:01.256
And they had many, many, many investments in German businesses or outright even owned those companies themselves.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.357
So this is the background.

40:03.457 --> 40:07.538
And in 1962, this conference in London was held.

40:09.259 --> 40:28.477
organized by CEBA and in attendance were a number of senior scientists from the, today we'd say life sciences, so biology, medicine, genetics, chemistry, biology, and stuff.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.359
Many of them were Nobel laureates.

40:31.679 --> 40:35.343
Joshua Lederberg was one of them, and he was a very young man at the time.

40:36.306 --> 40:42.834
And he was very well acquainted with Hilary Koprowski, as you also mentioned.

40:44.356 --> 40:50.264
And Lederberg made sure that Koprowski was invited to this conference in London.

40:51.706 --> 40:53.468
You didn't say the name of the conference yet.

40:54.454 --> 40:54.854
I don't think.

40:54.954 --> 40:56.035
Oh, yeah, right.

40:56.215 --> 41:02.838
So the conference, I always call it the SEVA conference, but of course, it is the conference on the future of man, right?

41:02.858 --> 41:14.524
I was wondering if Jay would want to, if there's any slides or any pictures online that Jay would want to show the audience for people who are watching, that would be, I could pull it up here, but Jay may want to show the audience.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.661
Up to you.

41:17.761 --> 41:18.722
Yeah, go ahead.

41:18.762 --> 41:20.183
I mean, anyone can show anything.

41:20.203 --> 41:22.985
I've already enabled the screen if you got something you want to pop up.

41:24.245 --> 41:24.446
Right.

41:24.866 --> 41:26.867
I think I would love to hear more about this conference.

41:27.067 --> 41:27.328
Yeah.

41:27.688 --> 41:28.308
The future.

41:28.388 --> 41:29.949
That's that sounds kind of relevant.

41:30.470 --> 41:30.710
Yeah.

41:30.850 --> 41:31.470
Very ambitious.

41:32.611 --> 41:33.152
Absolutely.

41:33.352 --> 41:33.692
Absolutely.

41:33.732 --> 41:36.574
And this was just just what is it 17 years?

41:38.295 --> 41:43.297
after the end of World War II, where people got together in London.

41:43.377 --> 41:52.261
I apologize, I have not prepared a presentation because it was just very, very short notice when we agreed to jump on a call.

41:53.262 --> 41:56.023
But it's available freely on the Internet.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.164
It's on the Wayback Machine.

41:57.224 --> 42:01.566
The whole proceedings can be found on the Wayback Machine.

42:03.747 --> 42:06.408
The conference title was The Future of Man.

42:07.885 --> 42:15.688
several Nobel laureates, but also other high-ranking officials, so let me see whether I can.

42:15.708 --> 42:22.951
In fact, if people go to Google, if you type in 1962 future of man, how sexist.

42:23.971 --> 42:30.634
The very first hit is the internet archive, the full text of man and his future, a SEBA foundation volume.

42:32.210 --> 42:32.690
Absolutely.

42:33.631 --> 42:37.853
And now my screen is... It's coming up right now.

42:40.715 --> 42:45.157
Well done.

42:45.237 --> 42:47.739
And so Koprowski was in this conference.

42:49.099 --> 42:53.862
And what he said is also very, very interesting, I find.

42:53.882 --> 42:55.403
Oh, there he is.

42:55.783 --> 42:56.143
Nice.

42:56.904 --> 42:57.604
Oh, my gosh.

42:57.664 --> 42:57.964
Wow.

42:58.545 --> 42:59.225
Well done.

43:02.389 --> 43:04.455
Yeah.

43:04.475 --> 43:04.896
Go ahead.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.357
Keep going.

43:05.859 --> 43:06.681
Julian Huxley.

43:07.262 --> 43:08.446
People like to talk about him.

43:09.605 --> 43:09.845
Yeah.

43:10.546 --> 43:20.572
And so you always also say that we want to stay away from what people call conspiracy theories or stuff.

43:20.612 --> 43:32.820
But first of all, we must liberate us from those cliches, which are basically designed to stop critical thinking, right?

43:34.084 --> 43:44.186
We've got to deal, we are dealing with something which is so illogical and so weird in so many ways.

43:44.926 --> 43:48.167
Science is not working the way it should.

43:48.547 --> 43:50.547
Politics is not working the way it should.

43:51.767 --> 44:01.589
Even economics has been thrown out of the window because the whole world economy is going down for something which is

44:02.549 --> 44:03.910
Well, it's nothing really.

44:03.930 --> 44:11.277
There hasn't even been any evidence for spread, as you have pointed out repeatedly.

44:11.758 --> 44:14.060
So therefore, we have to investigate.

44:14.180 --> 44:24.489
And in order to investigate, you have to form hypotheses, which then need to be assessed and analyzed as to their content.

44:24.730 --> 44:26.972
And here we see that this is something

44:27.990 --> 44:40.767
very, very real, where people get together and speak freely about their visions of the future of man with even the issue of population control,

44:42.381 --> 44:56.671
population, how to say, not reduction, they're not saying reduction, but they say that, of course, the growth is something to watch, but to selection, right?

44:56.771 --> 45:06.497
So they are talking about traits which they want to have and want to see in future generations and others which they don't.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.559
And they even speak about what might be possible in

45:11.716 --> 45:16.537
creating men without legs for air travel, space travel and stuff like this.

45:16.557 --> 45:17.997
So this is really, really weird.

45:18.938 --> 45:31.320
And it's been done by most senior scientists who are well respected, or at least who, who command respect, whether they deserve it or not.

45:31.800 --> 45:35.181
And this is something where I was shocked by reading it.

45:35.916 --> 45:51.455
again, 17 years after the end of World War Two, after the Nuremberg Code had been passed, they are talking about this kind of, you know, very, very oligarchic, totalitarian,

45:52.355 --> 45:53.816
dark stuff.

45:53.896 --> 45:59.078
And Koprowski and Joshua Lederberg are involved in that.

45:59.218 --> 46:01.679
Koprowski goes back to World War II.

46:02.179 --> 46:03.079
Lederberg doesn't.

46:04.080 --> 46:17.065
But Lederberg goes into the near past, into the early 2000s, as you have pointed out, Mark, and you, JJ, in your research about his involvement in the whole genetics field.

46:17.125 --> 46:17.945
And this is something

46:19.746 --> 46:21.528
I sit and watch your shows.

46:22.249 --> 46:29.175
My jaw drops every time when I see what you present.

46:29.675 --> 46:32.037
And this is just mind-boggling.

46:32.458 --> 46:39.024
And we have to come to terms with this and find a way to communicate these facts to other people.

46:39.384 --> 46:44.246
Okay, so just to read one little part here of Hilly Koprowski's text.

46:44.606 --> 46:53.549
However, during recent years, two splenologists, which I think are cavers, died in the United States without apparently being exposed to the bite of an animal.

46:53.669 --> 47:08.154
Exposure of animals to inhalation of virus from bat excre in the same caves led to the conclusion that the virus had changed its ways of infecting man and that two men died after breathing the infectious agent.

47:08.974 --> 47:13.378
Holy, holy shit.

47:14.919 --> 47:18.462
Okay, so that's, that's literally, that's pretty shocking.

47:20.584 --> 47:25.027
I don't know what to say other than I guess I have to read that document in its entirety.

47:25.848 --> 47:28.710
Yeah, one has to read it in its entirety.

47:29.030 --> 47:30.972
And also to be to be to be fair.

47:33.119 --> 47:38.003
So the whole proceedings is filled with presentations and discussions.

47:38.664 --> 47:52.015
And these discussions are, you know, they are very extensive and people speak their mind, which in a way is good because it helps us to understand what kind of thinking

47:52.635 --> 47:56.139
prevails in these kind of elite circles.

47:56.619 --> 48:05.368
But it's certainly a thinking which has no respect for human dignity, as it has come to be

48:06.734 --> 48:18.967
written into at least the moral code of the world after World War II in particular, after the atrocities which happened, unfortunately, in the name of my nation.

48:19.027 --> 48:23.952
And this is something which weighs heavy on my mind and which is one reason why I work

48:25.833 --> 48:31.576
on this matter to tell people, look, this is something which is not particularly German.

48:31.936 --> 48:38.779
It is something which is present in some people, and it's not present in other people.

48:39.299 --> 48:50.405
But we have to really make an effort to focus on the dignity, on human dignity, on the irreducible complexity, as you say, JJ, and this is something

48:51.286 --> 49:01.557
which is so important about your work and which is a shame why other people do not respect and cherish this as it should be.

49:02.375 --> 49:03.636
It's really nice of you to say that.

49:03.676 --> 49:11.659
Let me just say something before I hand it over to Mark that makes sure that everybody doesn't think that we're trying to circumlocute the truth without actually speaking it out loud.

49:12.359 --> 49:24.364
But it's become clear to a lot of us, kind of because of Mark's work, because of the work of people like Mr. Alsner, that the story that we've been told, where

49:25.985 --> 49:33.991
lots of people were killed by the Nazis in camps with gas and burnt is a partial story.

49:35.352 --> 49:49.423
And that it would be absolutely almost on its face ridiculous to think that something so valuable as an entire population of people that was destined to be destroyed would not have been used for other purposes first.

49:50.224 --> 49:55.047
And in fact, if you think of this idea and then wonder why

49:55.888 --> 50:01.043
whatever they did was not part of the public sort of

50:02.190 --> 50:03.531
Admissions set of okay.

50:03.551 --> 50:30.088
These people did this and here's the details and you know, these aren't suitable for everybody But there should be a museum somewhere that describes how awful these these things were but instead the details of what was most likely done before Extermination are just wholly missing from this history and it's very creepy that someone like Hillary Kaprowski has the history that he does which includes his early contact with a lot of these people in the

50:30.931 --> 50:42.475
in the infancy of this biological mythology about retroviruses and viruses and pathogens, all these things outside of us that cause cancer and all these other things.

50:43.395 --> 50:46.536
It took a while for this mythology to build up and it really feels like

50:47.216 --> 50:59.066
people that Mark has identified, particularly intriguing to me is Alice E. Moore, but also Hilary Kaprowski, you really start to see a frightening continuity.

50:59.086 --> 51:04.350
It doesn't take very many people to sustain these ideas if all these people look up to the same people.

51:04.390 --> 51:04.971
Go ahead, Mark.

51:07.653 --> 51:10.635
First of all, fantastic discovery.

51:12.337 --> 51:16.200
There are papers out there that demonstrate or

51:17.488 --> 51:31.119
provide an exhibit that Kaprowski and Joshua Lederberg, being amongst the other leaders and thought leaders, if you will, in their fields, had collaboration.

51:33.661 --> 51:44.530
Amongst the archives, which we will never get full access to, supposedly there are boxes between of collaboration of notes and whatever, and that's just what was shared between those two scientists.

51:45.490 --> 51:52.614
But Lederberg was known to be quite prolific in his writings, and he had extensive communication with a lot of people.

51:53.215 --> 51:56.016
Whether or not he wrote all of it himself, we'll never know.

51:57.037 --> 51:58.718
He is known to be a wordsmith.

51:58.758 --> 52:00.919
He created a lot of the words we use.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.622
The word microbiome is Hilary Koprowski's word.

52:05.982 --> 52:08.664
The word plasmid is Hilary Koprowski's word.

52:08.844 --> 52:10.125
He invented all these words.

52:10.940 --> 52:12.781
He was just, he just loved words.

52:13.342 --> 52:19.566
So, and I think there's a bunch of other ones, key words that people hang their whole reputation on.

52:20.007 --> 52:38.179
You know, we're not gonna make this a negative show about, or a critical show of some people, but when it comes to plasmids, a lot of the language, for example, like Dr. Kevin McKernan would use, is language created from fragments, no pun intended, that came out of the suggestions of Joshua Lederberg.

52:38.199 --> 52:38.740
Now, if I may,

52:39.571 --> 52:40.872
This conference is fascinating.

52:40.892 --> 52:42.173
First of all, there's two big names.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.354
There's a lot of big names, OK?

52:43.834 --> 52:46.836
Between Julian Huxley and Hermann Muller.

52:47.517 --> 52:51.060
Both of these were, of course, leading geneticists.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.081
Muller was more of an actual scientist.

52:53.141 --> 53:00.226
Huxley was more into just the thinking, whiteboarding, where can future mankind go, et cetera.

53:01.467 --> 53:03.709
They both were involved with

53:05.945 --> 53:08.187
This is an overly used term.

53:08.227 --> 53:19.633
I don't know what else to say, but elite circles in the 1920s and 1930s about eugenics and about life extension and evolution.

53:21.054 --> 53:23.255
It was seen throughout that time.

53:23.275 --> 53:27.578
I was looking for a book called Radium and the Secret of Life.

53:28.522 --> 53:46.514
It well documents that era between 1910 and 1940, where they had discovered radium, they discovered x-rays, they had misunderstandings that they thought were, they actually thought they saw evidence that radiation could mutate flies, and maybe radiation could improve people.

53:46.614 --> 53:48.935
It could improve our genetics somehow.

53:49.396 --> 53:53.858
In reality, they were just poisoning the flies, and they were growing in weird ways.

53:53.898 --> 53:57.821
They really weren't having any real genetic impact, but it got people thinking.

53:59.170 --> 54:06.818
So these are two giants with respect to the advancing and wanting to pour more money into genetics.

54:07.299 --> 54:14.226
I think Muller was one of the mentors of Sagan, I believe, many years ago.

54:14.246 --> 54:14.326
It's

54:15.612 --> 54:16.932
We've covered this a lot.

54:17.673 --> 54:28.917
Now, with Joshua Lederberg there in 1962, it was sometime in the 1960s that Lederberg created another word called euphenics, E-U-P-H-E-N-I-C-S.

54:31.558 --> 54:33.698
Very few people know about this word.

54:33.758 --> 54:43.862
It's so important though, because it shows the mindset and that they really were thinking about what they thought was their problem to solve, which is to live longer and improve humans.

54:44.867 --> 55:03.964
Lederberg had done the math, and he knew that even if we could do selective breeding, it would take, and even if selective breeding works as some people think it does, and there's some questions about that also, it would take tens of thousands of years.

55:04.744 --> 55:05.885
It would take so long.

55:06.005 --> 55:11.430
I mean, just look at the time that a female can start to have children, how many children they would need to have.

55:13.345 --> 55:16.366
Lederberg realized that was just not going to be possible.

55:17.006 --> 55:17.646
Are we still live?

55:17.666 --> 55:18.687
Yes.

55:18.727 --> 55:19.227
Yeah, we are.

55:19.447 --> 55:20.287
Sorry, he just took the screen.

55:20.307 --> 55:20.607
It's good.

55:20.627 --> 55:25.368
Now we're gonna be possible to improve the human race through selective breeding.

55:26.189 --> 55:29.350
Now, he didn't come out and speak against population controls.

55:29.390 --> 55:33.611
In fact, there's an IBM Journal article in the 1960s where he was still very much for that.

55:33.671 --> 55:41.433
But what he saw was that it was important to advance the field of genetics because through the field of genetics,

55:42.191 --> 55:54.742
understand how the code of life works, how the machinery of life works, then maybe you can impact it and change the way the people who are alive right now are functioning.

55:56.023 --> 56:04.791
Whether it's through diet, whether it's through some enzyme, whether it's through some augmentation of genetic code,

56:05.726 --> 56:18.357
Lederberg wanted that pursued more, and he wanted more money put into genetics, but not just to know how people work from scratch, if you will, bootstrapping them, but how can you impact the life of the people that are here now?

56:18.958 --> 56:24.142
And I suspect that that would have been something he would have spoken about at that conference.

56:24.202 --> 56:31.989
So while the eugenics angle, which is absolutely true, I mean, it's clear as day that there were discussions,

56:34.304 --> 56:48.094
presentations done by Hermann Muller, by Huxley, about some people are inferior, some races are inferior, some people are born with defects, you need to get rid of them, you need to clear the genetic pool, the earth is limited in resources.

56:48.955 --> 56:54.419
I don't think they had good enough proof of it, so they advocated for these things.

56:54.479 --> 57:00.484
But Lederberg, while he might have also believed in that stuff, there's no question about it,

57:01.363 --> 57:08.669
He was also looking for more realistic ways of attaining some of those things.

57:08.709 --> 57:10.990
So I think he was aware of euphenics.

57:11.631 --> 57:12.772
That's his word, matter of fact.

57:13.895 --> 57:16.297
I don't know if you actually defined it yet, though.

57:16.477 --> 57:18.318
If you did, I was reading while you said it.

57:18.358 --> 57:19.078
Can you say it again?

57:19.138 --> 57:19.819
What is euphenics?

57:19.979 --> 57:37.309
Euphenics is instead of simply improving the human race or improving life by selective breeding, it's actually understanding how the machinery and code of life works in a way that you can improve it, prove the life that's living now.

57:39.033 --> 57:42.194
via enzymes, via food, via maybe.

57:42.314 --> 57:44.074
Okay, I get it now, thank you.

57:44.154 --> 57:45.194
Viral viruses.

57:45.514 --> 57:46.175
Yeah, I see.

57:46.275 --> 57:56.357
Whatever, the culmination of all of those things, because there's just never gonna be enough time to improve the race in a way through no other means other than selective breeding.

57:57.977 --> 58:01.798
So it doesn't mean that he's a good guy, because that's a more kind way to approach it.

58:02.618 --> 58:05.499
It just shows that he was thinking, how is this more,

58:08.491 --> 58:13.334
how do we make that goal of life extension and improvement more achievable?

58:14.554 --> 58:15.815
So he was pursuing that.

58:15.875 --> 58:35.925
I think it's an important word that probably, as you're implying, gets purposely obfuscated behind the broader term eugenics so that people don't understand that they had thought about the nuances here and they realize that these might even be two different goals or two different sets of experiments.

58:35.965 --> 58:37.606
And so I think it's really important to bring it up.

58:38.186 --> 58:40.547
And to his credit, he was highlighting that.

58:40.987 --> 58:48.789
Again, I sometimes say that I'll offer a compliment to someone, and it does not mean that I'm morally justifying it, okay?

58:48.849 --> 58:55.690
I'm just trying to understand why they were thinking what they were thinking with the values that they had.

58:56.610 --> 58:58.831
But to his credit, in this case, he wasn't

58:59.724 --> 59:02.005
he felt there was a need to differentiate it.

59:02.085 --> 59:03.206
And he did so publicly.

59:03.706 --> 59:07.628
There's multiple US newspaper articles highlighting that word.

59:07.668 --> 59:11.109
So he kind of almost wanted that word out there in a way.

59:12.070 --> 59:21.094
It also goes to show how this crowd of scientists feel as though they are really that far above everyone else.

59:21.114 --> 59:23.555
They're no longer in the mud with the rest of us.

59:23.595 --> 59:25.956
They're making decisions, they're dictating.

59:27.890 --> 59:27.950
of

59:35.501 --> 59:37.741
It just goes really bad, really fast.

59:38.121 --> 59:41.682
Whoa, what are you showing us here, Uwe?

59:42.022 --> 59:43.582
Is that a, wow.

59:43.662 --> 59:47.223
Yeah, so I apologize for sharing the screen.

59:47.243 --> 59:52.144
I didn't know what would happen if I, I just wanted to prepare it for when Mark was finished.

59:52.184 --> 01:00:03.326
But I just tried to just search my notes and for Herman Moore, who was in London, and Mengele, and for sure.

01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:17.018
So there's this book here, The Nazi Connection, Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism from 1994, which I have here done an excerpt into my notes.

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:23.824
And there it says that for sure, so he is the mentor of Mengele, he wrote

01:00:24.264 --> 01:00:35.186
to Herman Muller after the war, because he was whinging and complaining about his life of deprivation, and he wanted, you know, to restore our science.

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:43.788
And there, I think, what you said is right about the language and about the differentiation, which is, of course, happening constantly.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.368
Remember, eugenics is a very old term.

01:00:47.429 --> 01:00:48.949
It is a very discredited term.

01:00:49.870 --> 01:01:00.482
And they were constantly trying to rephrase their doing in terms which are acceptable and palatable to people.

01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:02.687
whom they couldn't avoid, right?

01:01:02.807 --> 01:01:09.031
And we also need to be aware that those proceedings are those which were published.

01:01:10.952 --> 01:01:18.797
We must certainly assume that the real discussion, not everything which was discussed, will go into the proceedings.

01:01:18.837 --> 01:01:23.660
So therefore, there's also this difference between what is said

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
and what is reported.

01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:31.042
But behind all this is, I think, is the clear continuity.

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:43.525
And that's what Vera Sharaf has taught me, the continuity of a kind of thinking of, you know, superiority, biological superiority, by whatever means.

01:01:45.306 --> 01:01:52.968
And certainly, nobody can do it like the Nazis did anyway, after this has happened.

01:01:53.568 --> 01:02:08.277
But they didn't let go of certain concepts of directionality and design and stuff, which is incompatible with basic concepts of a national and personal sovereignty.

01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:12.240
And this is something which you have been pointing out, both of you have been pointing out.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:31.686
the whole time, which has also led you into conflict with other organizations and other people who are doing, well, doing work in some places, but are keeping quiet at others, which is really a shame because this is a

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:39.769
As Vera said, and I believe it's true, it is a very, very existential question.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:49.314
We are being called to understand what is going on, what is continuing to happen, notwithstanding the terms which are being used.

01:02:49.354 --> 01:02:51.416
So today we're talking about transhumanism, right?

01:02:51.456 --> 01:02:59.480
It's totally different, but it's not so different after all, because it also combines the thinking of eugenics, euphanics,

01:03:00.598 --> 01:03:16.760
And, and the, what's it called the technocracy and, and making the word Norbert Wiener coined it for for this, this

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:19.663
It will come to me in a moment.

01:03:20.183 --> 01:03:35.912
So where they really think they can direct whole societies on a technical level, which is why they are implementing all this hardware in our streets in Germany, everything is being connected today.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.374
It has nothing to do with cost-effectiveness.

01:03:39.714 --> 01:03:40.755
Everything is connected.

01:03:41.495 --> 01:03:49.342
because they want to really go into everyone's houses and turn on and turn off everything which they see fit.

01:03:49.402 --> 01:03:54.586
And this is something which is now possible on a technical level.

01:03:55.326 --> 01:03:58.189
It would have happened earlier had it been possible earlier.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.590
I'm very sure.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:10.779
Yeah, I would agree with that in general as well, that I think actually this operation has progressed pretty much in relation to the availability of the technology to be rolled out.

01:04:11.801 --> 01:04:15.782
I mean, that's why they didn't do it in the 80s.

01:04:15.902 --> 01:04:16.503
They weren't ready.

01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:20.804
And yeah, go ahead, Mark.

01:04:20.904 --> 01:04:24.745
In the 1980s, did they believe that they needed to do that, though?

01:04:26.526 --> 01:04:39.911
There were a lot of population reduction plans throughout the 1980s in various governments, which were not necessarily compatible with a worldview that we're going to need a lot of people to monitor.

01:04:41.957 --> 01:04:59.080
I'm currently going down a field where the speculation I believe is true is that it was perhaps hoped that there wouldn't need to be monitoring of everyone to figure it out.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.521
That maybe let's get rid of this excess population and with enough computers and enough animals, we'll figure it out.

01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:07.102
And maybe at some point,

01:05:07.691 --> 01:05:26.205
And these are the types of things that become more and more visible when you really understand the nature of something like the antibody patent paradox, where it's not just the fact that there's a lot of different antibodies, it's the fact that there's a galactic range of proteins made almost to the individual level.

01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:37.274
So with this much, with this many different responses to things, with that much, so much being unknown,

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:45.137
I think that at some point it became clear like, you know, we've started our population reduction program.

01:05:45.718 --> 01:05:56.625
It's going to be very successful now because we have, you know, decreasing levels of population with each generation, which is something, as we see in Japan, very hard to escape.

01:05:59.287 --> 01:06:01.188
The world may never hit this population again.

01:06:01.969 --> 01:06:08.153
And we've just come to the conclusion that what we actually need, we believe, to attain this mission is more people.

01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:10.081
This is not good.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:23.369
No time like the present to have the big pandemic and to really get to new medicine, to get to new monitoring, to double down on selling the capabilities of this.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:29.113
Again, this is speculation and action here.

01:06:29.173 --> 01:06:37.218
We don't have the answers, but I'm feeling very good about working with Jonathan and you, Uwe, and other people that are at least willing to put forth

01:06:38.557 --> 01:06:46.505
explanations that make sense as opposed to Satanism and, you know, just crazy simple things.

01:06:47.385 --> 01:06:57.595
And I think that one of the reasons why we've been so productive here is we've been really kicking out and keeping our distance from the stupid possibilities, narrow it down to things that make sense.

01:06:57.655 --> 01:07:04.481
And then really, you know, none of us really have, it's,

01:07:05.925 --> 01:07:10.049
We're all unified and just wanting to come up with the right answer, whichever one that is.

01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:18.817
So terminology, I came up with the term I was missing earlier.

01:07:18.897 --> 01:07:20.238
It's cybernetics, of course, right?

01:07:20.278 --> 01:07:32.049
So cybernetics is the ideology of a directed evolution of a society, of a whole economy, a world economy, basically.

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:36.291
And so this is tied to technocracy.

01:07:36.311 --> 01:07:38.592
This is tied to fascism.

01:07:40.413 --> 01:07:46.376
And it's also tied to oligarchies because you mentioned Satanists, right?

01:07:46.736 --> 01:07:50.698
This is something which, of course, triggers many people.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:57.023
because they are not at all familiar with thinking along those lines.

01:07:57.523 --> 01:08:08.031
However, we must understand that occult practices have been and still continue to be around and it is provable

01:08:09.274 --> 01:08:14.497
And it also pertains to institutions like the Vatican.

01:08:14.998 --> 01:08:34.089
So oligarchies, you can draw a line and I recommend the work of Cynthia Chang and Matthew Aratt about it, who have really highlighted the continuity of oligarchical structures continuing over millennia.

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:47.905
very precisely until the present, which will then eventually help us understand why, for example, the brilliant U.S.

01:08:47.945 --> 01:08:51.207
Constitution is under threat today.

01:08:52.028 --> 01:09:05.076
Because the United States revolution, the revolution in the colonies and the formation of the United States has been one of the very, very, very few blows delivered

01:09:05.788 --> 01:09:11.550
to the prevailing oligarchy of the time to the one world government of the time, which was the British Empire.

01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:15.231
And they have never, never forgiven.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:20.832
Can I just say that you are the only foreigner I've ever heard say those words before.

01:09:21.172 --> 01:09:22.092
The only foreigner.

01:09:22.252 --> 01:09:27.194
I've never heard any other foreigner on the internet say that fundamental fact.

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:28.034
It's incredible.

01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:38.573
Well, but I have not been able to understand it myself until very recently after reading Matthew Aratt and Cynthia and others.

01:09:40.513 --> 01:09:50.675
Anton Chaitkin, for example, is a brilliant historian who explains the history of the United States in a Republican tradition.

01:09:51.476 --> 01:09:58.437
And we must understand that they tried to overthrow the world with war.

01:09:59.577 --> 01:10:07.258
The Nazi experience, World War II, was an indication that this was not going to happen.

01:10:07.598 --> 01:10:08.859
This was not going to happen.

01:10:08.899 --> 01:10:11.379
People were not going along with that.

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:14.640
So they had to come up with other means.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.501
And now the biosecurity dogma is one way they are trying this.

01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:27.382
They had tried before with the free trade dogma, but people were willing to go to the streets about that as well.

01:10:28.042 --> 01:10:41.469
because it is not in the interest of nations, of individuals, of sovereign nations to have free trade imposed upon them, which only benefits those who are strong, right?

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:52.595
If you are in a position where you want to develop your economy, you need some form of protection until you are ready to embark in open competition.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.837
This is common sense, right?

01:10:55.477 --> 01:10:57.058
And so what they did is

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:02.553
anti-Americanism has been a ploy.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:17.246
They have the British, I'm sorry, forgive me for oversimplifying here, but the British Empire has done everything they could ever since Vietnam, Korea maybe even.

01:11:18.146 --> 01:11:28.012
Maybe even as early as 1946, when Stalin, when Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain, they understood, which, by the way, was a Nazi invention.

01:11:28.052 --> 01:11:36.557
The Nazis invented this as a life insurance to be protected, to help against the bad commies, right?

01:11:37.157 --> 01:11:38.678
And I'm not saying communism is good.

01:11:38.778 --> 01:11:42.460
I'm not saying that's what I'm saying.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.962
I'm saying is that this has been

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:46.362
employed.

01:11:46.382 --> 01:11:49.023
So divide and conquer is one way of looking at this.

01:11:49.503 --> 01:12:14.052
But the British Empire has politely and diplomatically retreated to the background and let the US do the dirty work all over the world, which makes America, which gives America a bad name, when in fact, America has been the only successful democratic, republican, humanist,

01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:20.755
foundation of a nation ever.

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:23.797
And this is a threat.

01:12:23.897 --> 01:12:25.098
And this is under threat now.

01:12:25.418 --> 01:12:32.784
And therefore, I also applaud you, JJ and Mark for calling out this WHO scaremongering.

01:12:33.004 --> 01:12:33.745
Yes, of course.

01:12:34.685 --> 01:12:36.467
It's not good what they are doing over there.

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:45.864
But it's detracting from you, like you said, JJ, to call for a Seventh Amendment violation in America.

01:12:45.984 --> 01:12:47.846
You have the means to do this.

01:12:47.866 --> 01:12:49.948
The Constitution is so strong.

01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:56.415
If you in America are focusing on the WHO, you are playing into their hands.

01:12:57.136 --> 01:13:00.537
This is something which is not the problem from your point of view.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:02.238
From our point of view, it is, right?

01:13:02.398 --> 01:13:04.279
In Europe, it is very different.

01:13:04.299 --> 01:13:05.660
We don't have a strong constitution.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.061
Germany, in fact, has, I mean, there's still two Germanies existing.

01:13:10.722 --> 01:13:15.904
Can you believe the German Reich still exists underneath the Federal Republic of Germany?

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:28.671
What this means isn't even clear to me in its totality because I'm not a lawyer, but certainly the German Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, ruled a number of times that the German Reich still

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:43.646
is inexistent, which must mean that all the rights of the allies will still hold for the German Reich, which is this area underneath the German Federal Republic.

01:13:44.207 --> 01:13:44.547
Okay.

01:13:44.927 --> 01:13:55.152
Which explains why we have to take and swallow that drones are being directed from out of Rammstein.

01:13:55.972 --> 01:13:56.192
Okay.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:58.193
And no German Chancellor can do anything about it.

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:03.405
This is a fact, but it's a fact which is not very well known.

01:14:03.445 --> 01:14:04.926
They don't want us to talk about this.

01:14:05.687 --> 01:14:05.947
Wow.

01:14:06.127 --> 01:14:07.929
So that's a whole other can of worms.

01:14:07.969 --> 01:14:08.569
Go ahead, Mark.

01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:19.799
I have a question, and I think feel free to spend as much time as you need on it for you, Jüge.

01:14:23.973 --> 01:14:37.846
You have, relative to most, a pretty solid understanding of a lot of different dates, leaders, probably military conflicts during World War II, Germany, of course.

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:54.411
Do you see anything that suggests that sometime between, I don't know, end of 1941 and 1942, there was a potential discontinuity or a change in the way some of these prisoner camps were seen?

01:14:55.572 --> 01:15:04.155
Because I have very little understanding, but I never realized this, but because you listen to my shows, you've heard me vocalize it.

01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:11.343
The camp at Auschwitz was for the most part for war prisoners, political prisoners.

01:15:12.004 --> 01:15:27.817
Of course, they were punishing people who they suspected of espionage and foreign spies and not necessarily great things, but it falls into the camp of pedestrian, you know, prisoner camps during the war, right?

01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:31.180
And then its nature changed quite dramatically.

01:15:33.115 --> 01:15:36.556
with the construction and the way it operated in 1942 and afterwards.

01:15:36.736 --> 01:15:45.579
Have you seen or ever thought like there was a weird disconnect, like how the prisoners changed and who might've been involved in that?

01:15:45.599 --> 01:15:52.981
Because if I'm crazy to speculate it, that something happened there, then I have to stop.

01:15:53.001 --> 01:15:54.722
So I'm just wondering what your thoughts were on this.

01:15:56.142 --> 01:15:58.603
To be honest, no, I haven't looked into this at all.

01:15:59.605 --> 01:16:14.534
And there are several reasons for this, but the most important one is that it is very, very difficult for any German to just make thought experiments about what it really was we are dealing with.

01:16:14.634 --> 01:16:18.596
Because we are under, well, I mean, it is,

01:16:20.505 --> 01:16:26.246
you are violating the constitution if you are relativizing the Holocaust.

01:16:26.486 --> 01:16:31.627
And people say that thinking about what was there is already doing this.

01:16:32.327 --> 01:16:36.988
Even if you're not questioning at all arrests, you're not questioning.

01:16:38.048 --> 01:16:42.209
You're just trying to understand the nature of things.

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:44.030
You're not even allowed that.

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:45.030
No.

01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:45.350
Well,

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.806
you're not well advised to do this.

01:16:48.287 --> 01:16:50.509
This has to be done from outside of Germany.

01:16:51.010 --> 01:17:03.886
And this is why I was so motivated to help someone like Vera Sharif because she is a person who can say this without having the slightest

01:17:05.023 --> 01:17:11.185
slightest danger of being labeled antisemitic, Holocaust denying.

01:17:11.225 --> 01:17:18.547
I mean, yes, they even tried this, but that's ridiculous because it will just blow up in the faces of people who do this.

01:17:20.248 --> 01:17:30.471
But it is unfortunate that this area, but to give you another perspective of this, so the Nazis were defeated.

01:17:32.145 --> 01:17:33.626
But the Nazis prevailed.

01:17:34.287 --> 01:17:35.248
What do I mean by this?

01:17:35.668 --> 01:17:39.311
The Nazis were also foreign Nazis.

01:17:40.132 --> 01:17:57.848
Some were even members of the Nazi party, such as Prince Bernard of the Netherlands, who went on with Prince Philip of England to found the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and create the whole sustainability climate hoax.

01:17:59.224 --> 01:18:01.325
He, Bernard, was an SS officer.

01:18:01.565 --> 01:18:02.346
He even was German.

01:18:02.986 --> 01:18:06.147
He married into the Dutch royalty.

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:07.948
He was an SS officer.

01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:18.674
He was very instrumental in aborting the Allied landing at Eindhoven in September of 1944.

01:18:21.269 --> 01:18:37.074
So there was a huge Allied landing with, I think, 30,000 paratroopers going down over the Northwest of Holland, so Eindhoven, Arnhem, the sole area.

01:18:37.514 --> 01:18:38.754
Why would they go there?

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:45.196
Because from there, it's very, very short route to go to the industrial heartland of Germany.

01:18:45.676 --> 01:18:48.417
Had they succeeded in taking

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:53.018
number of bridges which they had to take and they unfortunately failed.

01:18:53.619 --> 01:18:57.202
The war would have been over by winter of 1944.

01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:00.925
So by Christmas of 1944, everything would have been over.

01:19:01.846 --> 01:19:13.336
This operation failed because the Nazi Abwehr got wind of what was happening by way of a double agent from the Dutch, Christian Lindemans, who was sent over

01:19:14.736 --> 01:19:31.949
who had already been apprehended by the British counter intelligence because they figured that he was fishy because he had been surviving operations where everyone else got killed before and only he survived miraculously.

01:19:33.009 --> 01:19:41.115
They had already apprehended him and Prince Bernhard demanded that this man be released in September of 1944.

01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:49.943
to be sent over to Eindhoven to alert the Dutch resistance to the impending operation.

01:19:50.343 --> 01:19:51.364
He did not go there.

01:19:51.564 --> 01:19:59.649
He went to the Germans, betrayed the operation, and many thousands of lives were lost at Arnhem.

01:19:59.769 --> 01:20:06.953
Bilderberg, which is, of course, conspiracy theory, Bilderberg is a place just outside of Arnhem.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:11.416
It is an eyesight of where

01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:26.644
the brave Allied soldiers lost their lives in a three-day meat grind from German tanks with just very light armor or non-armor at all.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:29.664
It's in eyesight where the Bilderberg Hotel is.

01:20:30.385 --> 01:20:40.107
Prince Bernard had the audacity to call the first meeting of the Bilderberg Group 10 years after this right there.

01:20:42.831 --> 01:20:57.016
One piece of information which is missing in this is that, of course, the Germans knew that they were losing in August of 1944, just weeks before the separation was due to go ahead.

01:20:59.011 --> 01:21:05.013
In August of 1944, in Strasbourg, there was a meeting, which is well documented even in congressional records.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:05.773
U.S.

01:21:05.813 --> 01:21:08.914
Congress has heard this evidence right after the war.

01:21:09.494 --> 01:21:18.437
There was a meeting where the captains of German industry were summoned by the SS, and they were told that until then it had been a capital crime

01:21:19.562 --> 01:21:30.966
to extra, how do you say, to ship abroad, to expedite assets, money, patents, anything.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:34.708
You would be hanged if you did this.

01:21:35.128 --> 01:21:35.788
It was treason.

01:21:36.268 --> 01:21:39.770
After that meeting, it was an order to do just that.

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:48.073
So they started to ship assets abroad, particularly to South America, South America, Mangala, and many others.

01:21:49.482 --> 01:21:51.564
This happened in August of 1944.

01:21:52.024 --> 01:21:57.028
They needed a couple of months to complete the mission.

01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:04.335
Had the Allies succeeded in September of 1944, this whole operation would have ended.

01:22:06.196 --> 01:22:10.460
They would not have succeeded in getting the money out of Germany.

01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:13.668
which eventually they did to a very large extent.

01:22:14.288 --> 01:22:16.950
So this is where I say the Nazis survived.

01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:18.071
There were many Nazis.

01:22:18.371 --> 01:22:25.456
Some of those Nazis even managed to survive and get into the next German government, the democratically elected German government.

01:22:25.976 --> 01:22:31.320
We had a head of the chancellor's office, which is the chief of staff in the White House.

01:22:32.383 --> 01:22:33.144
Who was a Nazi?

01:22:33.464 --> 01:22:37.367
Who wrote the commentary of the population laws in 1935?

01:22:37.788 --> 01:22:40.190
He became the head of the chancellor's office.

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:48.757
The chancellor himself, Konrad Adenauer, his wife was a sister of the wife of John J. McCloy.

01:22:49.018 --> 01:22:53.662
John J. McCloy was a Wall Street banker and later became commissioner of Allied

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.303
operations in Germany.

01:22:57.503 --> 01:23:02.024
And Adenauer was handpicked to be Chancellor of Germany.

01:23:02.504 --> 01:23:06.484
And he was in the hand of John J. McCloy and the Americans.

01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:09.665
And his office was run by a Nazi.

01:23:10.445 --> 01:23:16.246
There was Reinhard Gehlen, who was head of Abwehr with regards to the East.

01:23:16.886 --> 01:23:18.767
So Fremde Heere Ost was Reinhard Gehlen.

01:23:18.807 --> 01:23:19.247
He was a general.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:32.106
And he was hired by Ellen Dulles, and he built the German intelligence service, so BND, Bundesnachrichtendienst, the CIA equivalent.

01:23:32.446 --> 01:23:32.986
He built it.

01:23:33.746 --> 01:23:47.209
And the two, Globke, so the head of the chancellor's office, and Gehlen, they met until the late 60s to discuss personnel in the German administration and academia.

01:23:48.678 --> 01:24:03.408
So they even managed to handpick those historians who were charged with working through the mess which was left in the archives.

01:24:03.488 --> 01:24:12.514
And of course, nothing really was understood because those people were the wrong people who sat there.

01:24:12.975 --> 01:24:17.778
They hanged a few small guys and the rest, they got a free pass.

01:24:18.482 --> 01:24:21.224
And then eventually, they were too old and died.

01:24:21.825 --> 01:24:31.634
But this went on until the late 60s, which means that until the 90s, people were put in places by those guys.

01:24:33.215 --> 01:24:37.519
And this has been handling academia in Germany.

01:24:40.563 --> 01:24:48.189
I mean, just an anecdote to kind of bring you back to where you started about how hard it is for you as a German to work on these subjects.

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:54.353
When I moved to the Netherlands in 2002, I can't remember exactly what year it was after that.

01:24:54.373 --> 01:24:55.154
It could have even been 2002.

01:24:56.815 --> 01:25:13.362
when the World Cup was going on and Germany was competing and the Netherlands, the Dutch people were doing news broadcasts about how this was the first time that they ever saw Germans fly the German flag since they surrendered in World War II.

01:25:13.382 --> 01:25:14.403
It was like notable

01:25:15.123 --> 01:25:20.830
that they were finally able to express some form of nationalism, even if it was just for their football team.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:24.334
And so the country of the Netherlands noticed this.

01:25:24.354 --> 01:25:34.866
And then the second thing I want to say is that, I don't know, you're probably aware of it because you live over there, but this story of the dirt and the skeletons in the closet of the royal family of the Dutch

01:25:36.327 --> 01:25:43.511
royal family is now becoming public, I think, in a very controlled and obvious fashion.

01:25:44.592 --> 01:25:45.752
And it's very convenient.

01:25:45.792 --> 01:26:00.080
It's kind of the same undermining the faith and nationalism of the Netherlands by, you know, conveniently releasing this shameful history at a time when they want to undermine the nationalism of every country in Europe.

01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:05.384
I feel like we should try to wrap up though, so if you don't mind.

01:26:05.524 --> 01:26:11.688
One important detail in this, Jay, because it pertains to what happened to Mike Eden.

01:26:12.729 --> 01:26:24.097
This nationalism, which was indeed, it was quite refreshing to see Germans embrace their nation in a sound way in the early 2000s.

01:26:24.117 --> 01:26:24.317
Today,

01:26:26.903 --> 01:26:33.266
I believe that this was maybe even a start of a direction.

01:26:33.847 --> 01:26:50.696
Maybe not, but Mark, you have said that stuff happened in the early 2000s with regards to the World Trade Center, which also has possibly some connection to what is happening now, because stuff couldn't happen then, which maybe they're trying to pull off now.

01:26:51.374 --> 01:27:01.042
Anyway, so the German nationalism at the moment, Germany is again fearing a resurgence of the far right of nationalism.

01:27:01.442 --> 01:27:01.782
Okay.

01:27:02.523 --> 01:27:14.673
And this is something which is connected to this because we have been, we have been spun so extremely that today we have, again, we have a

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:35.237
a nationalist opposition, Alternative für Deutschland, Alternative for Germany, which has been allowed to be the only opposition in the German parliament during COVID, which makes you think, okay, just this one party, and they held the speeches which every decent politician should have held.

01:27:37.399 --> 01:27:38.760
But so this

01:27:40.307 --> 01:27:49.633
brought a huge popular vote, in the polls at least, to this group.

01:27:52.194 --> 01:27:55.817
Come November last year, we see, first of all,

01:27:57.132 --> 01:28:05.021
reports of, of course, fake far-right conspiracies of Wannsee-Konferenz and stuff.

01:28:05.422 --> 01:28:14.532
But we also see in the German Bundestag the same parliamentary group censoring Mike Yeadon because he had the guts to say

01:28:15.293 --> 01:28:18.054
that there was no spread and that it is something else.

01:28:18.214 --> 01:28:26.078
And we don't know exactly what it is, but we should also think about the central bankers and we should think about digital money and all this stuff.

01:28:26.158 --> 01:28:28.979
And this was censored by this very opposition party.

01:28:29.359 --> 01:28:33.121
And they are dividing Germany right along those lines at the moment.

01:28:34.402 --> 01:28:40.264
And the Gaza conflict is just another topping on this devilish cake.

01:28:40.945 --> 01:28:41.345
I'm sorry.

01:28:42.194 --> 01:28:54.567
Jay, you have a phrase like, why would we need to have all of these psychological operations if the truth was just out there?

01:28:55.448 --> 01:29:03.036
Now, if we just had spreading pathogens that were risk additive happening all the time, why would we need

01:29:06.548 --> 01:29:14.078
Why would there be some big conspiracy to, you word it better than I'm wording it right now, but you've been highlighting this lately.

01:29:14.739 --> 01:29:16.622
How much focus has been on that, Jay?

01:29:16.682 --> 01:29:20.467
I mean, let's do one that you just popped in my head this morning.

01:29:20.527 --> 01:29:23.832
Why do you need to use IBM punch cards if you're just murdering people?

01:29:24.784 --> 01:29:28.246
I mean, well, if you're just murdering people, why do you need punch cards?

01:29:28.386 --> 01:29:37.150
I mean, it's IPM punch cards, the Germans have a reputation for meticulous note keeping.

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:47.695
And these, this data collection, this record keeping is just completely inconsistent, as well as all the resources to build and maintain those camps.

01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:56.332
with a population that was starved of resources that was running out of fighting age males that was just gonna kill these people anyways.

01:29:59.154 --> 01:30:01.215
These stories just don't add up.

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:06.179
I'm not trying to be insult, insult anyone.

01:30:06.199 --> 01:30:07.800
I'm not trying to be inflammatory.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.882
I'm not trying to just stir up drama where it's not needed.

01:30:11.202 --> 01:30:12.743
My life is too short as it is.

01:30:12.783 --> 01:30:13.524
I don't need that.

01:30:14.004 --> 01:30:17.727
These are just big questions about something which has been

01:30:19.487 --> 01:30:23.300
which has very, very close connections to what is happening today.

01:30:25.106 --> 01:30:31.889
I mean, I hate to make it so simple, but you know, there are also Holocaust deniers, just like there's no virus deniers.

01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.711
And it's the same kind of stupid question.

01:30:34.731 --> 01:30:46.597
And what we're actually asking is, is it possible that the Holocaust's worst aspects were actually completely hidden from us so that everyone in this group could benefit from their behavior?

01:30:46.757 --> 01:30:54.141
I mean, that to me is the simplest question that no one has ever asked in the history of me ever talking or being told about this story.

01:30:54.761 --> 01:30:59.502
There are stories of Mengele having done horrific experiments.

01:31:00.243 --> 01:31:02.623
And some of them are probably true.

01:31:03.584 --> 01:31:10.726
But then one nature is the ability to change eye color with a dye, something along those lines, which, well, perhaps that did happen.

01:31:10.746 --> 01:31:12.206
I don't know how often that happened.

01:31:13.307 --> 01:31:20.489
But if he was any type of a scientist or with other scientists, did they really think that that was going to have some sort of genetic impact?

01:31:21.218 --> 01:31:34.728
It's almost as if some stories were allowed to bubble up and be retold because they just sound like a bunch of monsters that had nothing to do other than to torture.

01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:48.779
And I'm not questioning whether or not there was torture at all, but it just doesn't make any sense, even from a military perspective, from any type of perspective at all.

01:31:50.732 --> 01:32:14.079
So if what we've just rolled into right now is all 8 billion people on the planet being subjected to a future of data collection and gene therapy, well, why is it out of the question to think that 8 million people in camps 80-something years ago would have been available for medical research?

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:19.121
And most of the experiments which did come out about transplants

01:32:20.424 --> 01:32:24.587
you know, the reactions of the body is effectively immune responses.

01:32:24.627 --> 01:32:39.398
And I think looking at the way freaking vaccines were made, realizing that it was, I'm going to slightly oversimplify it here, but mashing up animal brain and injecting it into people, yeah, they get sick.

01:32:39.498 --> 01:32:40.539
Well, no kidding.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:48.205
How different is that from transplanting, I don't know, bone marrow from different animals into people or between people?

01:32:50.037 --> 01:33:02.893
It is very possible that stunning insights into the way the immune system was identifying different tissues came out of whatever had happened in World War II.

01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:08.480
And it should be no surprise that there were major advances.

01:33:09.085 --> 01:33:19.907
and understanding how DNA was mapped and coming out with new vaccine manufacturing methods with the polio vaccine, there was a huge boom right after World War II.

01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:24.048
And in fact, it was Hilary Kaprowski who made the first polio vaccine.

01:33:25.449 --> 01:33:34.011
As a middleman between that Rockefeller Institute, having gone through the Vatican where he's played his piano, we're not stretching here.

01:33:34.331 --> 01:33:36.191
We're not stretching at all.

01:33:39.163 --> 01:33:53.693
And why is it for me, who is, I'm only the fraction of the historian that you are, and so much other horsepower which has been dumped, which we think anyways, into Twitter and these spaces.

01:33:54.073 --> 01:33:56.314
Why haven't more people gotten to this before?

01:33:57.035 --> 01:34:01.978
I'm actually frustrated that somehow we're at the front of this.

01:34:02.438 --> 01:34:03.119
We shouldn't be.

01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:04.700
We really shouldn't be.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.201
Other people should have done this before.

01:34:07.221 --> 01:34:08.242
I'm very frustrated.

01:34:08.683 --> 01:34:13.965
that either they sold themselves as what they were doing and they didn't.

01:34:14.645 --> 01:34:16.685
They've wasted so many other people's time.

01:34:16.705 --> 01:34:22.047
I'm very disappointed at them, having delayed these insights and this research until now.

01:34:24.347 --> 01:34:25.708
Either, as is me, Marc.

01:34:26.168 --> 01:34:29.849
But definitely, we are where we are at this moment.

01:34:30.849 --> 01:34:33.850
And you and JJ are raising these questions.

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.791
And look at what response JJ has gotten

01:34:38.078 --> 01:34:53.147
for raising concerns with an organisation which is purporting health freedom, instead of, as you say, rightly, really calling out the criminality of the vaccine schedule.

01:34:54.608 --> 01:35:02.192
And so this is something where I would hope that also Vela, who again, I respect greatly.

01:35:03.433 --> 01:35:05.494
She's a very strong, courageous woman.

01:35:06.161 --> 01:35:07.741
who has taken a lot upon her.

01:35:08.341 --> 01:35:13.983
But you should understand that you, Mark, are raising the exact right question at this moment.

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:22.305
And that if CHD was supporting Vera, they should support you in this question.

01:35:22.865 --> 01:35:23.385
Definitely.

01:35:23.405 --> 01:35:28.106
They should support JJ in demanding

01:35:29.406 --> 01:35:39.890
answers from senior scientists within the medical freedom movement about inconsistencies, about the narrative, and about the CV.

01:35:43.451 --> 01:35:48.213
I think we should close it there because it's an hour and a half and you guys have been really, really fantastically

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:54.238
Fantastically clear, I think, and it's been a really good meeting of a back and forth kind of thing.

01:35:54.299 --> 01:36:04.162
I want to encourage you to use the email that I sent the Zoom meeting in to make connections between you guys and do whatever you need to do to extend this connection beyond this little show.

01:36:04.182 --> 01:36:07.243
And I want to thank you again for both coming on.

01:36:07.283 --> 01:36:17.606
You can find Uwe at Never Again is now global on Substack and you can find Mark at HousatonicITS.com and I think also Housatonic

01:36:18.507 --> 01:36:19.108
dot live.

01:36:19.168 --> 01:36:19.728
Is that correct?

01:36:20.749 --> 01:36:22.170
Yeah, I got the URL.

01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:23.110
It's the name of the show.

01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:23.731
It's beautiful.

01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:24.071
Yep.

01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:26.273
Okay, so you can find them both there.

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:27.454
Their names are on the screen.

01:36:27.534 --> 01:36:38.181
Please, please just support their work because there are some of the few people that are that are peeling the onion in the right way asking the right questions and not afraid to admit that they've gotten it wrong a couple times.

01:36:39.222 --> 01:36:40.963
So thanks guys for joining me again.

01:36:41.003 --> 01:36:42.685
I'm gonna I'm gonna stream us out.

01:36:42.725 --> 01:36:43.125
Is that good?

01:36:44.588 --> 01:36:44.948
Wonderful.

01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:46.370
Thank you for this.

01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:47.211
This was great.

01:36:47.231 --> 01:36:48.652
I appreciate it.

01:36:48.832 --> 01:36:49.513
Both of you do.

01:36:50.674 --> 01:36:50.994
Awesome.

01:36:51.015 --> 01:36:52.176
Thanks, guys.

01:36:52.976 --> 01:37:00.324
So I don't really know what to say other than there are certain strategies, certain things going on right now.

01:37:02.242 --> 01:37:06.766
And I think they actually involve trying to mislead the young.

01:37:07.467 --> 01:37:12.731
I'm not necessarily accusing any of these people of being particularly good at misleading the young.

01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:14.673
I just think that they've been hired to do it.

01:37:16.114 --> 01:37:20.117
I do think that we can learn a lot from James Giordano.

01:37:20.177 --> 01:37:28.204
I think we can learn a lot from thinking about how many people don't wanna talk about 2020 and don't wanna talk about the history of the mentorship that underlies this.

01:37:28.824 --> 01:37:43.675
This limited spectrum of debate that we've been talking about today actually extends back to the Holocaust and World War II and whether or not we have been focused on shiny objects rather than the idea that you wouldn't just take people and exterminate them.

01:37:43.715 --> 01:37:47.598
And if you did, you wouldn't need IBM punch cards to keep track of them.

01:37:48.259 --> 01:37:52.862
I think we've been consciously and intelligently manipulated for a very, very long time and to

01:37:54.063 --> 01:37:59.126
acknowledge or hat tip Veera Sharav for using this statement from Edward Bernays in all of her talks.

01:37:59.946 --> 01:38:10.712
We have been manipulated by these people behind the scenes that have been planted very early on from harmless meddlers to people that have worked for the Human Genome Project for many years.

01:38:11.672 --> 01:38:16.154
It's because they have been always there to try and prevent our informed consent.

01:38:16.415 --> 01:38:18.916
And I think this has become very, very clear.

01:38:18.956 --> 01:38:20.857
They get us running around in hamster wheels

01:38:21.857 --> 01:38:24.098
And their stories are all very, very parallel.

01:38:24.138 --> 01:38:37.123
The parallel story from 2021 that Robert Malone told to Paul Cattrell is very parallel to the story told not even a week ago by Meryl Nass and not even a week ago by Mary Holland.

01:38:37.363 --> 01:38:39.423
And it just continues on and on.

01:38:39.463 --> 01:38:42.464
It's a mythology about viruses.

01:38:42.525 --> 01:38:45.105
It's a mythology about what can be done in the world

01:38:47.146 --> 01:38:47.946
in laboratories.

01:38:48.466 --> 01:39:00.710
And this mythology goes all the way back to the whole career of Ralph Baric, who his whole job has been to lay the foundation for this illusion that there is pandemic potential, and his work represents it.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:07.172
This is a group of people that's been busy for many years, but especially since the start of the pandemic.

01:39:07.212 --> 01:39:12.013
It's possible that Robert Malone wasn't even supposed to be part of this, but he is now.

01:39:12.233 --> 01:39:15.294
They have been faking this train stopping for many, many years.

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:19.799
And the way they did it is the best described as a scooby-doo.

01:39:19.879 --> 01:39:30.994
It's a mystery that they tricked us into solving, just like they tricked us into solving, you know, the mystery of how many Jews did they kill and not what did they use them for before they did that.

01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:37.741
I guess I show this guy all the time because I think he's a key to understanding this illusion.

01:39:37.802 --> 01:39:40.204
It's about spreading bad ideas and who's spreading them.

01:39:40.985 --> 01:39:50.756
Ladies and gentlemen, please realize that there was no novel virus that can explain all of these various ways that people were probably just murdered.

01:39:51.497 --> 01:39:58.928
And the fact that nobody wants to say murder is actually a very good clue that we have been misled for.

01:39:58.988 --> 01:39:59.890
How long is it now?

01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:01.652
We're in 2024.

01:40:02.173 --> 01:40:07.220
This is really four and a half, going on five years of a coordinated

01:40:08.361 --> 01:40:10.942
harmonization of liars across the internet.

01:40:11.543 --> 01:40:13.604
They've lied to us about this, this data.

01:40:14.864 --> 01:40:16.945
And that's, that's just I'm going to leave it.

01:40:16.965 --> 01:40:19.687
I'm not going to show any pictures of anybody up there at this time.

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:26.650
Please, ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:32.453
And if I can get this silly mouse to show up, I can probably play us out.

01:40:34.076 --> 01:40:35.277
Thanks guys for showing up.

01:40:36.257 --> 01:40:42.099
Um, this has been Giga Home Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:46.821
Um, thank you very much to my guests, which should be right, probably there still.

01:40:46.901 --> 01:40:48.202
Oh no, it's not.

01:40:48.662 --> 01:40:49.242
Oh no.

01:40:49.722 --> 01:40:50.283
They left.

01:40:50.743 --> 01:40:52.884
That means that the zoom is overloading.

01:40:52.904 --> 01:40:53.464
Look at that.

01:40:54.084 --> 01:40:54.725
Bang.

01:40:55.465 --> 01:40:55.545
Um,

01:41:03.834 --> 01:41:05.935
Oh, I don't even know if I can fix this anymore.

01:41:07.196 --> 01:41:07.996
That's pretty funny.

01:41:08.056 --> 01:41:10.137
We're going to force quit Zoom here.

01:41:10.858 --> 01:41:12.659
That'll do it, I hope.

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.380
Quit, quit, quit, quit, quit.

01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.641
End the meeting for all.

01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:19.042
I'll have to get back to them later.

01:41:19.703 --> 01:41:23.925
Whoa, so that's what happens when you get the infinite screen on Zoom.

01:41:24.265 --> 01:41:25.986
That's pretty funny.

01:41:26.306 --> 01:41:27.627
Anyway, thanks for joining me.

01:41:28.327 --> 01:41:32.129
This has been Giga Home Biological, and these are the people that support the work.

01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:33.130
Thanks, guys.

01:41:42.236 --> 01:41:44.038
I have to make a video for the red pill.

01:41:44.338 --> 01:41:49.523
I'm going to do that probably this afternoon and then send it in so it gets up on the website.

01:41:50.464 --> 01:41:51.325
The talk is fine.

01:41:51.345 --> 01:41:53.387
I mean, I'm not worried about that.

01:41:53.547 --> 01:41:54.328
I'll knock that out.

01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:56.210
Thanks, guys.

01:41:56.630 --> 01:41:57.812
Thanks, Mark.

01:41:58.492 --> 01:41:59.273
Thanks, Ube.

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.355
You guys are the best.
