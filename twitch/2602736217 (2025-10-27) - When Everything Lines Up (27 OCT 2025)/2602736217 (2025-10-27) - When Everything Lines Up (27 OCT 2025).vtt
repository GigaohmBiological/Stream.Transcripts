WEBVTT

02:07.503 --> 02:08.044
Yeah.

02:36.899 --> 02:37.319
you you

03:02.176 --> 03:03.997
Be introduced.

03:15.165 --> 03:33.672
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

03:33.692 --> 03:38.134
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

03:38.783 --> 03:44.928
a panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment on his thesis.

03:45.169 --> 03:51.314
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

03:51.354 --> 03:56.939
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

03:57.619 --> 04:05.947
He was one of the co-founders of RASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

04:07.436 --> 04:20.661
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

04:21.621 --> 04:35.447
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the

04:36.380 --> 04:40.963
on the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

04:41.304 --> 04:43.445
And here's the first paragraph.

05:39.895 --> 05:40.455
so so

06:05.734 --> 06:05.814
you.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.342
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught Webb how to create the coronavirus.

07:22.882 --> 07:24.022
Taught who?

07:24.042 --> 07:25.203
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.602
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

07:36.842 --> 07:37.323
I'm an MD.

07:37.383 --> 07:38.044
I'm a physician.

07:38.866 --> 07:43.513
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

07:43.573 --> 07:44.695
I do molecular biology.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.360
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

08:04.171 --> 08:05.672
but you can tell if someone's lying.

08:06.312 --> 08:08.073
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

08:09.894 --> 08:10.575
And I have lied.

08:10.595 --> 08:11.635
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:11.655 --> 08:12.596
I don't want to lie.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.437
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

08:14.557 --> 08:15.577
I try not to be a liar.

08:15.598 --> 08:16.458
I don't want to be a liar.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.700
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

08:22.003 --> 08:27.185
Specialization should make you suspicious, because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on.

08:27.645 --> 08:30.726
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

08:31.186 --> 08:33.146
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.327
And that's sort of my starting bias.

08:38.228 --> 08:40.789
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes.

08:40.829 --> 08:42.329
And I know that you don't read them.

08:42.998 --> 08:46.439
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass and get a good grade.

08:46.719 --> 08:47.740
But this one is pretty cool.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.861
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

08:51.581 --> 08:54.823
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

08:55.423 --> 08:57.884
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the Queen.

08:57.924 --> 09:02.926
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

09:03.226 --> 09:05.647
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.888
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.252
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

09:14.272 --> 09:17.234
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

09:40.891 --> 09:42.432
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.175
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

09:46.195 --> 09:49.337
They did fool us into solving their mysteries, and by doing so, we have...

09:50.942 --> 09:52.583
to accept their monsters.

09:52.623 --> 10:00.709
In other words, I guess that's not quite right yet, but in order to solve their mysteries, we have to accept their monsters, we have to accept their narrative.

10:00.749 --> 10:14.440
Specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious, and that's sort of my starting bias.

10:14.980 --> 10:21.486
In fact, we actually have to accept the very words that they use to describe the monsters.

10:21.546 --> 10:26.470
The very words that they use to describe the mysteries we are forced to use.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.832
That's why everybody's talking about gain of function.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.275
That's why everybody's talking about viruses.

10:31.315 --> 10:33.436
That's why everybody's talking about antibodies.

10:34.097 --> 10:38.181
Because we are given the vocabulary that traps us.

10:39.369 --> 10:42.991
And it is within their vocabulary that we are trapped.

10:43.932 --> 10:47.034
And yes, that's their biology as well.

10:47.074 --> 10:51.256
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear right now is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.257
I'm chief biologist at Gigaom Biological.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.158
I come to you live.

10:54.898 --> 10:57.100
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

10:57.680 --> 11:24.059
If you wanna find my work as an Academy Magician, you need to go to the National Library of Medicine website, PubMed, use my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, my first two initials, J and J. You'll find a whole list of papers and work that I was associated with and worked on directly, including some of the work that Drastic put together back when I thought they were actually a really fascinating group of scientists and independent researchers doing something useful at the start of the pandemic.

11:24.659 --> 11:27.981
However, I've come to understand it as something completely different.

11:28.442 --> 11:38.809
I tried to explain it to the group called Panda, but they lost all three of those two-hour presentations, and instead, members of that organization, including Jessica Hockett, Jessica Rose,

11:42.156 --> 12:03.015
Jonathan Engler, Nick Hudson, let me think of some other ones, Josh Getzko, and even Mark Giordano have gone around the world talking about little bits and pieces of the real biology that we've been able to put together here at GigaOM Biological, representing it as their own ideas.

12:03.695 --> 12:05.356
even writing books, etc.

12:05.396 --> 12:09.577
Similar things have happened with a lot of the participants at NCI.

12:09.617 --> 12:14.259
I'm afraid that the guy Sean that runs that thing has just taken money.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.820
He's just sold out.

12:17.961 --> 12:19.481
That organization is a joke.

12:19.501 --> 12:28.325
There might be something else called the Canadian COVID Care Alliance that might be a little bit better with a little higher percentage of good actors, but again,

12:28.945 --> 12:29.886
It's really hard to tell.

12:29.926 --> 12:38.514
The Wellness Company, another one of those groups that probably just absorbed anybody that had any good intentions and is putting people in front of those people.

12:38.994 --> 12:41.016
Children's Health Defense does the same thing.

12:41.096 --> 12:43.599
Good meaning, well meaning, well intentioned people.

12:44.239 --> 12:48.161
get involved in that organization, start donating, maybe even get a job for them.

12:48.721 --> 12:55.744
And in reality what you're doing is putting yourself on the team of people that are purposely sabotaging that movement.

12:56.444 --> 13:05.248
That's why somebody as treacherous as Mary Holland has been in front of us on all of the mainstream and alternative news sources

13:05.888 --> 13:27.607
for more than a decade opposite Mr. Paul Offit because it's one great big national security show that has culminated in many books by Skyhorse Publishing and Children's Health Defense Publishing Company, including this Wuhan cover-up book by the now Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I helped write, or I helped write that book.

13:28.548 --> 13:31.250
and am listed as the primary expert.

13:31.471 --> 13:49.165
I delineated my, let's say, terrified position that I found myself in in 2024 at the June 17th presentation that I did in Rapid City, South Dakota for the Red Pill Expo.

13:50.346 --> 13:52.828
I was actually lucky enough to get put in some kind of comic here.

13:53.610 --> 14:06.553
where it looks like Ben Garrison has drawn my face to be part of a weird Mount Rushmore out from which the truth train driven by G. Edward Griffin is being driven.

14:06.593 --> 14:10.894
So I think that was pretty cool, but it didn't amount to anything.

14:10.974 --> 14:17.016
So since then, I've been working hard to get back in shape so that I can teach biology from the basketball court

14:18.076 --> 14:27.460
And also since then I've been declared officially chemtrail retarded and barracks bitch boy By former research and development director of the human genome project.

14:27.500 --> 14:39.084
Mr. Kevin McKernan out of Boston, Massachusetts I think he's one of the worst for most fraudulent national security actors in America today and I think a lot of the

14:40.214 --> 14:43.858
let's say populist movement that Steve Bannon has organized.

14:43.938 --> 14:52.466
The most dedicated members of that movement are keenly aware of the biological mythology that Kevin McKernan has been pushing.

14:53.006 --> 14:54.448
And that's his job.

14:54.948 --> 14:59.913
I don't really see him as anything more than doing his job.

14:59.953 --> 15:00.854
And so I'm doing mine.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.355
Welcome to the show.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.256
See you in a minute.

15:25.329 --> 15:26.069
Kind of cool, isn't it?

15:26.969 --> 15:27.589
It really was.

15:28.369 --> 15:31.590
And now folks, we have Mike Bauer and Bailey.

15:31.650 --> 15:34.231
Come on out and say hello to the folks, Mike and Bailey.

15:38.479 --> 15:38.819
Hi, Mike.

15:38.879 --> 15:39.059
Hello.

15:39.079 --> 15:39.720
How are you?

15:39.740 --> 15:40.240
Nice to meet you.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.201
Fine, thank you very much.

15:41.621 --> 15:42.802
And this is Bailey.

15:43.082 --> 15:43.283
Yes.

15:43.363 --> 15:44.484
Bailey is a beagle.

15:44.904 --> 15:46.585
Now, Bailey, you like Bailey?

15:46.605 --> 15:47.446
How long have you had Bailey?

15:47.466 --> 15:47.806
Three years.

15:47.846 --> 15:48.847
Are they good dogs?

15:49.167 --> 15:52.089
I've heard that they kind of have a rotten disposition a little bit.

15:52.109 --> 15:55.512
They can be a little snarky, you know, a little grumbly.

15:55.552 --> 15:56.392
Is that true or not?

15:56.773 --> 15:57.673
They have a mind of their own.

15:57.733 --> 15:58.414
Mind of their own, yeah.

15:58.634 --> 15:59.675
But they're good dogs.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.898
Well, he's certainly a handsome looking dog.

16:01.918 --> 16:02.719
Where are you guys from?

16:03.079 --> 16:03.780
Buffalo, New York.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.681
What do you do in Buffalo?

16:04.962 --> 16:05.863
I'm a bridge inspector.

16:05.883 --> 16:06.484
Bridge inspector.

16:06.504 --> 16:08.206
Well, you got your work cut out for you now, don't you?

16:08.466 --> 16:08.606
Yeah.

16:08.847 --> 16:11.450
And how did the bridges in and around Buffalo seem?

16:11.590 --> 16:12.291
OK or not OK?

16:13.137 --> 16:13.517
They're good.

16:15.258 --> 16:19.981
And generally, the infrastructure, you believe, in this country, in this state, OK?

16:20.041 --> 16:20.581
Not OK?

16:21.142 --> 16:21.842
They need improved.

16:21.862 --> 16:22.642
Need improvement?

16:22.943 --> 16:24.704
We need money for improvements.

16:24.864 --> 16:26.465
But bridges are safe.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.046
Let's see if you can win some money here tonight.

16:28.246 --> 16:28.646
OK.

16:32.448 --> 16:34.529
Bailey, and what are you guys going to do?

16:35.290 --> 16:36.390
She is going to play dead.

16:36.871 --> 16:37.211
Play dead?

16:38.601 --> 16:40.002
and then come alive, it says here.

16:40.222 --> 16:40.522
Yes.

16:40.622 --> 16:42.183
Play dead and come alive?

16:42.263 --> 16:42.463
Okay.

16:42.523 --> 16:42.763
Yes.

16:42.943 --> 16:45.244
Do you need that other devil dog out here to help?

16:45.444 --> 16:45.824
No.

16:47.265 --> 16:47.685
How was it?

16:47.805 --> 16:49.406
Were you backstage with that crazy dog?

16:49.726 --> 16:50.547
How was?

16:51.947 --> 16:54.869
He was calm until he gets the command.

16:54.989 --> 16:56.310
Yeah, until he gets the command.

16:57.910 --> 16:59.231
Somebody ought to look into that guy.

17:01.703 --> 17:02.624
Okay, Bailey now.

17:02.765 --> 17:03.585
Bailey will play dead.

17:03.625 --> 17:04.546
What do we need to do here?

17:04.767 --> 17:05.227
Anything, Mike?

17:05.247 --> 17:05.568
Nothing.

17:05.908 --> 17:07.049
Okay.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.512
Bailey, play dead.

17:14.978 --> 17:15.298
Play dead.

17:29.946 --> 17:33.808
That was good.

17:34.188 --> 17:34.868
Play dead.

17:35.028 --> 17:35.689
Oh man.

17:35.829 --> 17:39.130
Yeah.

17:39.950 --> 17:43.732
Play dead.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.573
Oh buddy.

17:48.794 --> 17:49.754
Alive.

17:49.874 --> 17:50.555
He's fine.

17:50.655 --> 17:51.035
Okay.

17:52.618 --> 17:53.419
That was great.

17:53.679 --> 17:54.881
Thank you very much, Bailey.

17:54.941 --> 17:55.842
Thank you very much, Mike.

17:55.882 --> 17:58.304
Let's take one more look here in the slow motion.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.226
Here's Bailey playing dead.

18:00.707 --> 18:01.548
And hit the switch.

18:01.788 --> 18:02.148
Clunk.

18:02.569 --> 18:03.510
Good night, everybody.

18:04.211 --> 18:05.632
It's Mike Bauer and Bailey.

18:05.913 --> 18:06.894
Thank you very much, Mike.

18:06.954 --> 18:07.755
Nice meeting you.

18:07.775 --> 18:08.696
What time is it?

18:08.776 --> 18:09.516
Game time!

18:09.617 --> 18:09.677
Woo!

18:25.375 --> 18:25.536
you

19:04.155 --> 19:04.216
you

19:15.899 --> 19:17.140
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

19:17.200 --> 19:22.745
It is not a matter of what is true that counts, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

19:22.805 --> 19:24.927
These people have known that for some time.

19:25.027 --> 19:32.473
They have been taking advantage of that principle with regard to money for more than a few generations now.

19:33.594 --> 19:37.197
And there are very few people on the internet who are going to tell you the truth about that.

19:38.479 --> 19:40.181
One of them might be the Liberty Perspective.

19:40.221 --> 19:40.961
I like that guy.

19:40.981 --> 19:42.543
You gotta watch him on 2X.

19:42.804 --> 19:43.504
That's a warning.

19:44.145 --> 19:44.946
It's a compliment.

19:46.808 --> 19:50.352
And that's Joe Marshall out of New York.

19:50.412 --> 19:51.474
I like that guy a lot.

19:51.654 --> 19:54.197
It's the Liberty Perspective on Rumble and on YouTube.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.678
We need more people to read some books, ladies and gentlemen.

19:59.038 --> 20:02.759
We need more people to be archiving the real history of America.

20:02.799 --> 20:09.261
Besides, although Mark Kulak out of Housatomic ITS out of Boston does a really good job, we need more people doing it.

20:10.262 --> 20:12.222
We need more people than Housatomic.

20:15.023 --> 20:18.385
We need more people than GigaOM Biological pushing this.

20:22.830 --> 20:36.236
There are only three classes of people, and unfortunately, if you skillfully use social media, you will inevitably put yourself into the category of those who do not see and cannot see.

20:37.426 --> 20:38.567
Willfully blinded.

20:39.087 --> 20:41.169
That's what skillful social media does.

20:41.229 --> 20:42.610
That's what it does to our kids.

20:43.390 --> 20:48.594
And if it isn't already doing it to your kids, it will if you allow them to get on social media.

20:49.135 --> 20:53.418
Because social media creates an illusion of consensus about everything.

20:55.019 --> 21:01.184
And with regard to the pandemic, there was this particular team of people called Team Worst Case Scenario.

21:02.546 --> 21:15.910
And I think that America could save itself if they could realize the true meaning and role of these people, what these people represent as an admission with regards to how we are governed.

21:16.610 --> 21:29.474
More importantly, perhaps for the rest of the world, this same cast of characters includes a number of international operators loosely associated with the Commonwealth of the United Kingdom.

21:30.274 --> 21:38.216
And these people were also involved in creating an illusion of consensus that spanned more than just the national borders of the United States.

21:38.276 --> 21:44.558
Because, of course, social media is something that spans more than the borders of the United States of America.

21:44.578 --> 21:50.319
In fact, it acts almost as a cognitive octopus connecting the world.

21:50.579 --> 21:53.360
And why would they ever want to create such a network?

21:55.421 --> 22:03.970
Why would they ever want to create such a network of data collection, data monitoring, data coordination, and narrative coordination?

22:04.350 --> 22:05.872
What would they use that for?

22:06.813 --> 22:09.275
That's the question you really need to ask yourself.

22:09.335 --> 22:11.938
Why would they want all of our children to have wearables?

22:12.599 --> 22:18.665
Why do all of these people that purport to be part of the health freedom movement, why are so many of them selling wearables?

22:20.686 --> 22:24.669
It's because for a very long time we have been on a limited spectrum of debate.

22:24.749 --> 22:39.080
We have been on and in a groove of sorts, a cognitive groove that was going to guarantee that most or all of the thinking, skillfully using social media users would reach the same conclusion about the pandemic.

22:40.168 --> 22:51.853
that coronaviruses are real, that they can be made in a laboratory, that they have spike proteins that can be toxic but also bind ACE2 receptors and also be blocked by antibodies.

22:52.674 --> 22:58.496
And if you have enough of those antibodies and block enough of those spike proteins, then you can save yourself from an infection.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.718
And all of these things just don't seem to add up.

23:02.338 --> 23:03.659
And our kids understand it.

23:05.247 --> 23:13.136
And the reason why they don't add up is because we are still the vessel through which our kids are going to be given this mythology.

23:13.236 --> 23:15.999
We still need to believe it so that our kids believe it.

23:16.039 --> 23:21.586
And that's why this is a once in a multi-generational opportunity to break this spell.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.303
Unfortunately, we are the animals on the animal farm.

23:26.363 --> 23:41.328
We have been led to believe that somehow or another there is equality and we are striving toward this utopian equality, whatever it is, where everybody has an equal opportunity and that's never been further from the case than right now.

23:42.248 --> 23:51.711
It only takes a little common sense to see it, but unfortunately, again, skillful social media use virtually negates any common sense that you might have.

23:51.751 --> 23:53.592
And so the only way out is non-compliance.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.752
Get off of social media.

23:54.772 --> 23:55.572
The truth is out there.

23:55.592 --> 23:56.373
It's just not there.

23:57.493 --> 23:59.434
Halloween is definitely coming.

24:00.094 --> 24:01.794
Halloween 2025.

24:04.235 --> 24:04.895
It's nutso.

24:05.176 --> 24:06.316
It's absolutely nutso.

24:06.336 --> 24:07.456
I don't know about eight years.

24:07.516 --> 24:08.537
What's eight years with that?

24:10.484 --> 24:22.156
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, if you're one of the audience that's watching that went to college or graduated from high school during the pandemic, well then, here's a newsflash for you.

24:22.176 --> 24:25.119
The only reason why you were fooled is because your parents were fooled.

24:25.139 --> 24:28.402
That's kind of the message I'm trying to send right now.

24:28.563 --> 24:31.426
If we hand our children over to these charlatans,

24:32.526 --> 24:42.351
If we hand our children over to these charlatans and their descendants, their acolytes, then our kids will never get that power back.

24:42.411 --> 24:45.152
They will never get that freedom back.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.934
But this time could be different because these people are frauds.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.014
These people right here.

24:49.915 --> 24:55.918
All of these people I have personal experience with, would testify or street fight.

24:56.158 --> 24:59.200
All of these people, I would definitely do it because they are

25:00.120 --> 25:02.421
They are the opposite of patriots.

25:02.521 --> 25:04.402
They are the opposite.

25:07.203 --> 25:07.943
But I've got hope.

25:08.023 --> 25:14.166
I've got hope because of biology, because of history, because we have a lot of choices that we can make from here on out.

25:14.906 --> 25:16.107
Nothing is determined yet.

25:16.167 --> 25:24.390
If we turn our backs on the internet, we learn the biology, and we hunt these people down, the truth will set us free.

25:24.431 --> 25:25.051
That's what I think.

25:26.171 --> 25:27.592
That's what I think.

25:29.488 --> 25:32.050
Intramuscular injection, ladies and gentlemen, is dumb.

25:32.090 --> 25:34.031
Transfection of healthy people is nuts.

25:34.791 --> 25:36.212
And RNA cannot pandemic.

25:36.252 --> 25:38.934
That just doesn't make any sense if DNA is real special.

25:40.435 --> 25:41.255
And that's it.

25:41.375 --> 25:45.958
The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words.

25:46.578 --> 25:50.961
If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.

25:51.021 --> 25:52.062
That's Philip K. Dick.

25:53.507 --> 25:56.611
But that's a wonderful insight into what's happening right now.

25:56.691 --> 26:07.726
Think about it, if you have to argue about autism and vaccines and viruses and pandemics and endemicity, then you are arguing within the trap.

26:08.768 --> 26:14.455
That's why we like to say intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

26:14.896 --> 26:18.541
Transfection of healthy humans was always criminal and actually was nuts.

26:19.542 --> 26:23.367
RNA cannot pandemic and biological men can only ever be trans men.

26:23.427 --> 26:25.690
That's the reality of things, ladies and gentlemen.

26:26.471 --> 26:30.634
It's just not in the way that you've been fooled into believing it.

26:30.734 --> 26:32.996
That's the trick to most of this stuff, actually.

26:33.056 --> 26:34.037
It's pretty bizarre.

26:34.077 --> 26:35.357
It's really pretty bizarre.

26:36.939 --> 26:41.982
And yes, this is Gigon Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

26:42.002 --> 26:42.282
27th of October, 2025.

26:47.446 --> 27:11.245
crazy crazy crazy crazy i will very freely admit um from my position here let me see if i can do this quick um good morning everybody welcome to the show this is get going biological my name is jonathan cooey coming to you live from pittsburgh pennsylvania i will admit that last week i was exhausted um i was just absolutely wiped out

27:13.484 --> 27:17.293
wiped out by the kind of overwhelming

27:19.562 --> 27:44.255
insistence that this narrative continue and it's an overwhelming insistence from all sides right if you watch the left if you watch the right if you watch any angle from from social media even in any country's you know independent little social media bubble you can see the exact same basic progression where there is a populist conservative movement

27:45.095 --> 28:13.819
and a woke left something something movement and these these theaters are enacted in each country and those theaters have the similar components that are skeptical of the mRNA or skeptical of the the local uh vaccine injury safety net um skeptical of the local foreign policy or even in some cases actually skeptical of the identity or sex of the leader

28:15.202 --> 28:29.805
And so you can have a scenario like the Netherlands, a very prosperous country being slowly or even quite quickly wrecked by immigration, and then have their prime minister, who nobody liked,

28:30.686 --> 28:31.767
Nobody respected.

28:31.967 --> 28:40.834
Everybody thought of as kind of having sold out to interests that were not popular and not populist but more aligned with the EU.

28:41.274 --> 28:57.827
That guy goes on to be NATO president or whatever he is, NATO chairman, and the Netherlands still hasn't inverted into this full-blown, you know, conservative, shut all the borders, everybody speaks Dutch, freak out.

28:57.967 --> 28:58.287
Why?

28:59.144 --> 29:03.069
because the population was already more than half foreigners.

29:04.491 --> 29:13.882
More than half with no real ties to Dutch history and therefore just kind of slowly, that's just going to melt away.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.647
Anything that is Dutch will be history.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.826
anything that's Dutch will be history.

29:20.966 --> 29:33.014
It will be a history of the tulips, and a history of shipping, and a history of windmills, and a history of canals, and a history of dyke engineering, and a history of

29:36.243 --> 29:44.191
flaunting Western morals to the point where eventually they just kind of faded away and disappeared into the multiculturalism of the EU.

29:44.972 --> 29:47.874
Very similar to how their neighbor Belgium is fading away.

29:48.455 --> 29:55.522
Very similar to how France could fade away, or Germany could fade away, or any of these countries like Sweden could just fade away.

29:57.293 --> 30:00.935
and the idea of whatever those nation states were will fade away.

30:01.075 --> 30:12.863
At one point in time, you could find and listen to an interview of Muhammad Ali making the argument that ethnicities used to be what countries were.

30:12.923 --> 30:14.704
If you're from Italy, you were Italian.

30:14.744 --> 30:16.885
If you're from Germany, you're German.

30:16.925 --> 30:19.047
If you're from Ireland, you're Irish.

30:19.127 --> 30:21.468
If you were from Sweden, you were Swedish.

30:21.548 --> 30:23.709
If you were from Spain, you were Spanish.

30:23.769 --> 30:25.471
If you were from Mexico, you were Mexican.

30:25.511 --> 30:25.891
And now,

30:30.126 --> 30:31.507
Now it's just a passport.

30:31.728 --> 30:42.118
And in fact, many of those previous distinctions are now considered just a conglomerate subgroup of a crayon we're not even supposed to talk about.

30:44.574 --> 30:55.041
And those of us with a multicultural background, with a multi-ethnic background, with parents that were already multi-ethnic in many cases, now we're left with what?

30:55.501 --> 31:06.828
Some kind of weird identity that doesn't count for anything because we have been told by social media that we are supposed to revert back to black and white and I don't know what else.

31:07.608 --> 31:08.449
Jews, I guess.

31:09.926 --> 31:20.915
This is the kind of intense confusion and incongruency that can only be explained by a national security state and a military operation.

31:20.955 --> 31:22.856
There's no way we're here by accident.

31:23.497 --> 31:25.679
There's no way we're here by bumbling chance.

31:25.739 --> 31:30.843
There's no way we're here because social media algorithms are just yucky because they just work.

31:31.483 --> 31:34.705
to make people participate in dopamine and something.

31:35.025 --> 31:35.446
No way.

31:35.906 --> 31:37.967
No way, no how.

31:38.768 --> 31:42.910
America is here right now because we are in the middle of a controlled demolition.

31:43.511 --> 31:53.757
And if you are outside of America, you could help us by trying to get this out, this story out, that Donald Trump is a puppet, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:53.817 --> 31:59.621
is a puppet, that Jay Bhattacharya is a puppet, that Marty McCary is a puppet.

32:01.087 --> 32:08.655
and that the entire COVID pandemic was a puppeteered exercise that was coordinated across national governments.

32:09.215 --> 32:15.882
We don't know who did it, we don't know who's at the top, but we know the American government and American insiders are very important.

32:15.922 --> 32:20.346
We know that a lot of these social media insiders and social media actors

32:21.287 --> 32:33.474
are strategically activated and present in particular Crown Commonwealth countries including New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, England and Canada.

32:35.855 --> 32:46.300
And so it's not clear, I don't know, I'm not going to tell you it's the Masons or it's Crown Royal, you know, City of London people or it's ultimately the Vatican or whatever.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.142
What I am going to tell you though is it's not the Jews.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.741
It's not Israel.

32:53.881 --> 32:56.203
It's not bad guys in America.

32:56.463 --> 33:01.526
It's not Peter Thiel and Elon Musk getting together and using PayPal money to do this.

33:02.006 --> 33:07.029
This is a coordinated campaign that creates a theater of nothingness.

33:08.584 --> 33:29.405
And so you don't really need to explain the details of the theater of nothingness in order to call it out for what it is, in order to point out that all of these incongruencies are impossible, unless they're scripted, and that all of these people are impossibly, impossibly,

33:31.292 --> 33:33.694
unprofound in order to be where they are.

33:33.794 --> 33:40.040
Peter Thiel is profoundly, normally, profoundly average.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.883
Elon Musk is profoundly average.

33:44.463 --> 33:45.264
My goodness.

33:46.025 --> 33:52.951
I mean, think about Jeff Bezos, how profoundly average he is, how profoundly average Zuckerberg is.

33:54.844 --> 33:56.206
That's not by accident.

33:56.246 --> 33:59.189
That's not because it's hard to get geniuses on camera.

33:59.730 --> 34:12.385
That's because these people are scripted actors and the conservative movement in America that would never exist on its own exists because social media has been used to create it.

34:15.379 --> 34:22.964
And now it will be used to destroy it, to discredit it, to fragment it, to split it all up so that the next phase can happen.

34:22.984 --> 34:28.468
I don't know what that is, but I do know that we need to wake up and realize that that's the trap that we are in.

34:28.488 --> 34:31.350
We need to put our hands up.

34:31.410 --> 34:32.270
You need to admit it.

34:32.370 --> 34:39.535
If you voted for Donald Trump, if you followed that along, you got to understand this is a crucial time in mankind's history.

34:41.189 --> 34:54.919
And it's not that far of a leap to realize that the lifelong scripted Hollywood actor, Donald Trump would do that for a living, would do it for a billion dollar chance at making crypto money.

34:55.480 --> 35:02.325
And now his son is supposedly selling drone parts to the U S government because we can't take drones from China anymore.

35:03.005 --> 35:05.027
Is that a scripted joke?

35:06.877 --> 35:25.603
Is that, is that supposed to be funny that we're just ignoring the fact that he's like come out with cryptocurrency, not Bitcoin, but other stuff that he's making millions and millions of dollars for his friends, if not billions of dollars in insider trading during this tariff theater.

35:27.064 --> 35:32.726
And now we're being told somehow or another that his son has a drone company that now has a DOD contract.

35:32.766 --> 35:34.006
That's gotta be a joke, right?

35:35.728 --> 35:44.773
That this, this Teal funded guy that runs Anduril, this remote control drone missile dude guy with, you know, what is his name?

35:44.833 --> 35:45.654
Lucky Palmer.

35:45.754 --> 35:46.735
Are you kidding me?

35:48.576 --> 35:53.759
America cannot, we as an earth, as a humankind cannot be this dumb.

35:55.592 --> 35:58.233
This is a theater of actors.

35:58.373 --> 36:00.833
It is a Lollapalooza of liars.

36:00.953 --> 36:02.914
And it's not just the COVID thing.

36:03.014 --> 36:07.395
It is all that we are experiencing right now on social media.

36:07.455 --> 36:09.976
You got to first start by discounting all of it.

36:11.436 --> 36:11.896
All of it.

36:13.737 --> 36:17.598
And I think it's more visible than ever that you have to discount all of it.

36:18.398 --> 36:22.819
I think most people have concluded that the creation of COVID was

36:23.638 --> 36:24.939
probably not what they told us.

36:24.999 --> 36:29.022
It probably didn't evolve naturally out of a pangolin in a seafood market.

36:29.782 --> 36:33.364
And the Wuhan Institute of Virology probably played a role, the U.S.

36:33.384 --> 36:43.671
government played a role, but it is impossible to find anyone, or has been for us anyway, to find anyone who has kind of like direct connection to any of the main players here.

36:43.691 --> 36:46.033
None of them will do an interview, none.

36:47.387 --> 36:50.431
You were the vice president of the EcoHealth Alliance.

36:50.451 --> 37:04.048
You're a former military guy, tied to the intel world, you worked at a federal nuclear lab in New Mexico for years, and then you wind up at your scientist PhD, and then you wind up

37:05.279 --> 37:08.322
working for EcoHealth Alliance in New York City.

37:08.922 --> 37:18.411
You think it's like this World Wildlife Fund operation designed to track diseases among wildlife globally and protect the wildlife, protect the people.

37:18.491 --> 37:20.453
It's kind of a crunchy outfit.

37:20.513 --> 37:21.934
It's do-gooders, basically.

37:22.835 --> 37:27.459
You show up there, you help them raise a bunch of money from the feds, and you become the vice president.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.521
And then you discover it's not what you thought.

37:30.681 --> 37:34.423
So that's the story that you told me at breakfast, which is an amazing story.

37:34.743 --> 37:35.663
Thank you again for coming.

37:36.323 --> 37:42.666
I'm going to bow out now and let you continue the story from there, assuming I've been faithful in my rendition of it so far.

37:42.686 --> 37:43.907
That's perfectly accurate.

37:43.927 --> 37:44.807
And thank you for having me.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.788
This is sort of like a dream of mine.

37:47.068 --> 37:48.229
Oh, well, I'm so excited you're here.

37:48.429 --> 37:50.189
And because this has been gnawing at me,

37:52.363 --> 37:53.506
You know, where did COVID come from?

37:53.847 --> 37:54.769
And how is the U.S.

37:54.789 --> 37:55.571
government implicated?

37:55.591 --> 37:59.781
It clearly was, but you never meet anyone who can say that they know the players, but you do.

38:21.127 --> 38:26.312
So with that, you show up there, you become VP of EcoHealth Alliance, the now famous EcoHealth Alliance.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.343
And when did you start to realize this wasn't the World Wildlife Fund?

38:32.064 --> 38:33.024
Shortly after I was working there.

38:33.044 --> 38:43.633
So I was hired as a senior scientist to take over a... I learned after the fact, I sort of lied to you, but it was a failing department that was doing predictive forecasting and analytics.

38:43.673 --> 38:47.876
And after I brought in all that money from the Department of Defense, I actually sort of saved EcoEarth Alliance.

38:47.896 --> 38:49.117
It was financially on the rocks.

38:49.858 --> 38:53.141
That $4 million really transformed the organization.

38:53.901 --> 38:59.708
And with that and my expertise in technology, I was actually improving the systems and technology company wide.

39:00.750 --> 39:07.077
Peter Daszak, who is the president or CEO of Equal Alliance, liked everything that I was doing.

39:07.117 --> 39:07.658
He was very impressed.

39:07.698 --> 39:09.400
Peter Daszak is like a figure out of history now.

39:09.420 --> 39:11.623
I mean, Peter Daszak is like at the very center of COVID.

39:12.023 --> 39:12.724
Oh, absolutely.

39:12.904 --> 39:13.965
And we'll get to that.

39:15.947 --> 39:17.909
So Peter promotes me to vice president.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.953
And then I started attending executive meetings.

39:20.993 --> 39:25.177
And I get involved in all the different other aspects of the company, or at least visibility to what's going on.

39:25.698 --> 39:30.102
The main driver of funding of Equal Alliance was from this program called PREDICT.

39:30.723 --> 39:32.845
And PREDICT was funded by USAID.

39:33.726 --> 39:40.291
to go out and conduct global surveillance of infectious diseases to predict and forecast emerging pandemics.

39:40.351 --> 39:43.153
At least that's what they were telling everyone they were going to do.

39:43.173 --> 39:45.514
That seems like a virtuous thing to do, by the way.

39:45.534 --> 39:46.995
No, and it seemed completely virtuous.

39:47.035 --> 39:53.020
And I had actually been doing that type of research my entire career, at least as a scientist and engineer.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.142
And I was doing that type of work at the National Laboratory.

39:56.242 --> 40:00.425
I continued that work funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency when I was at Equal Alliance.

40:00.445 --> 40:02.386
That's where the first big check comes from for $4.6 million.

40:04.187 --> 40:08.690
And that's an interesting one that I didn't catch before.

40:08.770 --> 40:22.458
But he says there that he used to he was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which you will probably remember is somehow associated with this guy, Robert Malone, who's behind CHD and Merrill Nass.

40:23.458 --> 40:23.598
And

40:25.774 --> 40:26.815
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:26.835 --> 40:37.504
I mean, I don't really know how to quantify the sort of level of deep state shenanigans that this guy, Robert Malone, has been involved in.

40:37.604 --> 40:41.628
And since he emerged as a pandemic actor in 2021, basically,

40:44.344 --> 40:59.476
At least that's when he started to really work as a podcast actor and came out on the Joe Rogan show and the Bret Weinstein podcast among others and then just started doing the circuit sometimes as many as nine a day.

41:00.897 --> 41:07.442
Robert Malone is kind of central to understanding why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:07.502 --> 41:09.184
must be a scripted fraud.

41:10.177 --> 41:13.719
And many of the actors that are around Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:13.739 --> 41:22.142
have had direct personal interaction with me with regard to Robert Malone and interpreting him as a good guy or a bad guy.

41:22.862 --> 41:34.928
And without fail, everybody in this narrative, from the entire book staff of Skyhorse Publishing and the staff that helped write the Wuhan cover-up book for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,

41:36.749 --> 41:46.239
all the way to the entire staff of CHD, Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit that is worth several millions of dollars that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:46.299 --> 41:56.551
was the head of until he ran for president, and Mary Holland is now still the head of after more than 10 years apparently of campaigning against the MMR vaccine.

41:57.171 --> 41:59.253
for having caused her son's autism.

42:00.174 --> 42:05.378
These people are nefarious actors, and that's really the only way to characterize them.

42:05.478 --> 42:15.467
Unfortunately, they probably would not be criminally liable for what they're doing, because they probably have some kind of direct connection to a national security operation.

42:15.507 --> 42:16.428
They have clearances.

42:16.488 --> 42:21.973
They're a part of something that gives them the permission to pretend they're this certain.

42:23.407 --> 42:39.667
They are auditioning for a part in a paramilitary operation on social media that is either directly or indirectly run by some government entity associated with Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

42:39.707 --> 42:40.728
Those two people

42:41.289 --> 42:45.011
are the most important people in American current history right now.

42:45.571 --> 43:07.244
Those two people should be on every journalist's radar that has any remote interest in figuring out what's going on with the fraudulent Trump administration, because a large portion of what could be or is being accomplished with the Trump administration is being accomplished because HHS Secretary, NIH Director, and FDA Director are all

43:08.004 --> 43:37.493
right now stooges people without the professional or or requisite biological expertise to know what the hell they're doing in that office and yet they are there and they are primarily acting as podcast actors they are going on podcasts talking about the stuff they're doing saying things like radical transparency or or talking about food dyes and that kind of thing and and this is malevolence

43:39.093 --> 43:59.190
And at the same time, on the opposite side, no one seems to be able to see that these people are frauds, but instead take them very seriously as lifelong liars that have gotten away with lying for a very long time, and they don't belong where they are, but now we're screwed because we're stuck with them, and that's all so ridiculous.

44:00.751 --> 44:03.093
It's absolutely preposterous.

44:06.892 --> 44:14.703
And yet here we are now with a pretty significant portion of the population of America entranced by Tucker Carlson.

44:15.284 --> 44:21.272
Even if they're skeptical of some of the people that come on Tucker's show, they think Tucker is doing a good thing.

44:21.332 --> 44:23.395
And this is absolutely false.

44:25.014 --> 44:35.161
Carlson has admitted more than three times in the last two years on camera in a sort of semi-fluid conscious rant about how he does lie.

44:35.502 --> 44:36.622
It's part of his job.

44:36.642 --> 44:37.743
He doesn't like lying.

44:37.783 --> 44:41.266
He doesn't think it's good, but sometimes it's just necessary.

44:42.607 --> 44:43.407
Because he's weak.

44:44.988 --> 44:46.670
He says that out loud.

44:48.211 --> 44:51.153
And yet somehow or another, they play some banjos.

44:52.632 --> 45:00.168
and they show you a picture with him as a young man with Jerry Garcia, and I guess everybody thinks he's real.

45:01.172 --> 45:23.130
put a chandelier made of deer antlers over the table, and goodness sakes, all the previously best props that were at Cracker Barrel are all collected in one room, and now you have The Ultimate Podcast with The Ultimate Podcast actors all streaming through The Ultimate Podcast set.

45:25.246 --> 45:35.052
Once I'm promoted and I'm looking at this USAID predict program, I decided to go dig into the literature and all the technical reports to see what this is and how it actually works.

45:37.830 --> 45:43.533
I read through this phone book of material, and I assess that it's a giant boondoggle.

45:43.893 --> 45:48.655
There's no way that they're going to be able to predict or forecast infectious diseases.

45:48.715 --> 45:54.157
They weren't collecting enough samples globally or in the countries where they were collecting them.

45:54.898 --> 46:01.701
They weren't collecting the data on a systematic and routine basis, which is one of the fundamental core concepts in biosurveillance.

46:02.722 --> 46:09.874
And you start to ask the question, well, what... So this is your area, I should just say, like, you've done a lot of research into how do you model this out?

46:09.894 --> 46:11.176
Like, how do you collect the data?

46:11.216 --> 46:11.937
How do you analyze it?

46:12.719 --> 46:16.320
I make the bold claim that I'm probably one of the world's leading experts in the area.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.862
I'm one of the few people that actually predict and forecast infectious diseases before they've occurred.

46:21.522 --> 46:23.123
And I've done it in peer-reviewed literature.

46:23.463 --> 46:27.845
And I was actually so bold when I built my models and tested them.

46:27.865 --> 46:33.527
I actually had this published in, I think it was the Guardian newspaper, the New York Post, before the outbreak hit.

46:33.547 --> 46:35.748
And this was the Zika, you remember Zika virus?

46:35.788 --> 46:36.288
Very well, yeah.

46:36.428 --> 46:45.136
I was working at EcoHealth Alliance when the models that I developed actually forecasted the amount of Zika virus that we'd receive in the United States and where specifically.

46:45.856 --> 46:47.158
And I published that before it happened.

46:47.418 --> 46:53.623
So you were very familiar with the technical details of a study of this kind, of monitoring of this.

46:53.723 --> 46:57.327
How big does the sample have to be in order to do this?

47:00.397 --> 47:01.518
So the devil's always in the details.

47:01.718 --> 47:04.659
It depends on the characteristics of the infectious disease agent.

47:04.679 --> 47:09.360
They're talking about the population, where that population is located, the type of infrastructure.

47:09.901 --> 47:12.922
There's a lot of technical nuance because it's how healthy is the population?

47:13.022 --> 47:15.262
What is the probability that they'll be exposed to something?

47:15.863 --> 47:22.065
And then what are the likely transmission dynamics within that population?

47:22.145 --> 47:27.587
And does it have the ability to go from a small isolated outbreak to an epidemic to a pandemic?

47:27.967 --> 47:39.199
So, but because this is your specific area, you look at the details of what EcoHealth Alliance, your new employer, is now doing, and it's immediately obvious to you, like instantly obvious that this is not real.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.603
It wasn't real, and the real crazy aspect of here is that

47:44.843 --> 47:49.664
Once I'm promoted, I'm going to all these different meetings with the funders of the program.

47:49.684 --> 47:56.846
So Dr. Dennis Carroll, who is the program manager, program director at USAID, who had a very close relationship with Dr. Peter Daszak.

47:57.486 --> 48:07.508
And these fundraising events we're doing where we're telling everyone that we're going to forecast and predict these emerging infectious diseases that can cause pandemics.

48:07.588 --> 48:12.349
And I'm sitting in the audience and I'm watching my boss and these other people telling everyone that they're doing this.

48:13.412 --> 48:18.832
And like I mentioned, if you look at the technical reports, it's just very clear that this is not technically possible.

48:20.657 --> 48:26.981
It begs the question, you know, as me being an ethical person and a good scientist and engineer, what are we doing here?

48:27.682 --> 48:29.923
Right, because we're not doing the thing we said we were doing.

48:29.983 --> 48:30.484
Exactly.

48:31.264 --> 48:33.506
And, you know, it gets sort of darker than that real quick.

48:33.546 --> 48:43.333
So once I'm sitting in these executive meetings, one of the first meetings that I sit in is a budget, a budget, a budget, a budget forecasting meeting.

48:43.373 --> 48:44.233
Budget though, that's perfect.

48:44.253 --> 48:46.014
Yeah, it's a budget meeting, good Freudian slip.

48:46.575 --> 48:48.336
A budget forecasting meeting for the company.

48:48.396 --> 49:08.101
What I think's happening there, and he looks up a couple times, he stumbles through some words, he's already got queued up phrases and queued up talking points that Tucker is kind of working through with him, kind of queuing him up with, making sure that he stays on the script, and he's supposed to have memorized the talking points that come after it.

49:08.722 --> 49:17.544
Now you might think that that's a little harsh, but there's a lot of material out there from previous years of Andrew Huff rehearsing this.

49:18.601 --> 49:28.485
rehearsing how much military speak should he use or not use, how much technical expertise should he claim to have or not, and how should he claim it.

49:28.905 --> 49:42.290
And so this is an iteration of a narrative that anybody that was paying good attention already heard several times because he was, of course, promoted several times during the pandemic in a test sort of way.

49:42.870 --> 49:48.816
He has streamed with somebody with a million followers like Kim.com on X, of course.

49:49.156 --> 49:51.638
He's been interviewed a couple times by The High Wire.

49:51.999 --> 49:54.481
He's been interviewed a couple times by CHD.

49:54.521 --> 50:04.791
And once you start to put all of these on a calendar, it starts to become almost impossible that a guy who was given a Skyhorse book

50:07.128 --> 50:22.872
with the subtitle something about how I uncovered the biggest lie in human history could still be struggling to reach mainstream attention and having a lifelong dream of being on Tucker Carlson finally fulfilled in the end of 2025.

50:24.393 --> 50:35.456
The only way that's possible if we're just watching some kind of dumb theater where the script recall, sorry, the script calls for him to come up now again.

50:36.755 --> 50:38.816
And in a few minutes, we'll go back in time.

50:38.856 --> 50:48.862
We'll look at a couple of clips from when he was in 2022, coming onto the scene and starting to rehearse this story and who he was rehearsing it with.

50:49.282 --> 50:58.648
And then now recall who he's with now, Tucker Carlson, and who he went on with a couple of days ago, Mary Talley Bowden, who now has a really big podcast, of course.

51:00.368 --> 51:07.634
And each vice president in charge of the area is going around talking about our budget, how our employees are doing, you know, operations types of things, typical corporate stuff.

51:08.895 --> 51:14.000
And, you know, I asked the question because I mean, well, how much money are we spending on wildlife conservation?

51:14.840 --> 51:27.010
And because when I interviewed at the company and all our branding and marketing messaging was that we're doing infectious disease research to protect wildlife and engage in conservation activities or something to that effect.

51:28.292 --> 51:29.553
So, I mean, think about this.

51:29.633 --> 51:35.378
He's trying to tell a story that he basically, what, applied for a job that he saw online?

51:36.459 --> 51:42.945
That he filled out an application and then they interviewed him and then they hired him and then he slowly learned what the company was about?

51:44.547 --> 51:44.987
Really?

51:45.447 --> 51:47.309
Is that what they want us to believe?

51:48.590 --> 51:53.435
You know, if I would have applied for the job at EcoHealth Alliance, maybe I would be Andrew Huff.

51:57.498 --> 52:03.317
Maybe if I would have, you know, told the story that I understood to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., maybe I would have gotten in a book.

52:07.119 --> 52:19.562
Instead, what you see is that they basically tried as best they could to trap me into a role very similar to what this clown is doing, where I believed that there was a lab leak, and I believed that I helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

52:19.602 --> 52:20.442
write a book about it.

52:20.502 --> 52:27.783
But unfortunately, during the writing of the book, I explained to all of them why that was ridiculous, because RNA can't pandemic.

52:28.303 --> 52:32.364
An intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is just a dumb idea.

52:32.884 --> 52:35.045
Why hasn't CHD said that?

52:35.825 --> 52:37.166
That's how I got fired.

52:37.206 --> 52:37.986
It's pretty simple.

52:38.026 --> 52:47.830
And it's very similar to how I got fired from the University of Pittsburgh for pointing out to all of my fellow faculty members that this was just transfection being renamed vaccine.

52:48.370 --> 52:49.811
Renaming things!

52:49.971 --> 52:50.811
Isn't that interesting?

52:50.851 --> 52:54.373
It's almost like controlling the language is 90% of the frickin' battle.

52:56.817 --> 53:02.062
It was quiet and I'm looking at everyone and why is everyone sort of staring into space or staring at me?

53:02.723 --> 53:10.250
And eventually Peter Daszak looks at me and with sort of a maniacal laugh says, we're not doing any conservation work.

53:13.753 --> 53:15.735
Is this like a nightmare scenario?

53:15.755 --> 53:15.855
Yeah.

53:17.316 --> 53:19.257
I'm just, I'm just shocked.

53:20.237 --> 53:29.420
And, you know, I came directly from the National Laboratory System, Sandia National Laboratories, and I was trying to get away from that type.

53:29.520 --> 53:39.923
The National Laboratory System is also where Brian Hooker worked for the first 16 years of his life as a geneticist and a genetic engineer trying to make plants make medicines.

53:40.043 --> 53:41.103
I shit you not.

53:42.628 --> 53:48.577
So in 2013, when he came out and said that my son has autism, but I don't like the word autism.

53:48.617 --> 53:51.962
We don't use the word autism because he was just vaccine injured.

53:52.002 --> 53:53.745
He was neurologically damaged.

53:55.373 --> 53:59.598
That Brian Hooker, he worked for National Laboratories for 16 years.

54:00.159 --> 54:13.874
Interesting that this whole cast of characters that all happens to have Skyhorse books all happened to work for National Laboratories associated with genetics and now are coming out fully believing in gain of function viruses.

54:17.205 --> 54:20.106
And they're all behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:20.166 --> 54:21.806
So maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:21.846 --> 54:23.026
is just a stooge.

54:23.707 --> 54:40.971
Maybe he's just an idiot who is just brain fried from 12 years of addiction and brain fried from a lifetime of sex addiction and brain fried from a lifetime of lying and brain fried from a lifetime of a Truman Show populated by people like Gavin DeBecker and

54:41.571 --> 54:45.472
everybody else around him, like Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker.

54:45.852 --> 54:52.093
I was actually excited to go work at a crunchy granola nonprofit organization where I was protecting wildlife.

54:52.133 --> 54:53.674
He's part of the Autobahn Society.

54:53.854 --> 54:57.255
Yeah, and as we were discussing earlier, we're both avid outdoorsmen.

54:57.295 --> 54:58.455
We love nature, that kind of thing.

54:58.475 --> 55:00.235
And I thought I was going to get into more of that.

55:00.255 --> 55:05.156
I was excited, like, hey, maybe I'll get a chance to have a trip out to the woods or the jungle and go protect some wildlife.

55:06.057 --> 55:07.277
And I hear this and I'm like, OK.

55:08.377 --> 55:10.798
And I digest it.

55:10.818 --> 55:11.898
Of course, I don't say anything.

55:11.938 --> 55:13.679
It's my boss, the other executives.

55:14.499 --> 55:16.920
And then it drives more questions.

55:18.441 --> 55:19.421
What are we doing here?

55:20.101 --> 55:26.323
But I don't have to believe in sex addiction to reiterate the fact that that's the narrative we're being pushed, right?

55:26.424 --> 55:27.564
Just keep that in mind.

55:29.591 --> 55:56.622
So I sat in more executive meetings, I learned more, and I quickly learned that we were sort of functioning as a Beltway Bandit type of operation, meaning that we're trying to get large contracts and grants in our area, which is, in theory, predicting and forecasting infectious diseases, but really what we were- Maybe you forgot, but Tucker Carlson went viral about 10 years ago because he was like fly fishing in Central Park.

55:57.242 --> 56:00.003
So he really is an avid outdoorsman.

56:00.403 --> 56:12.147
Doing was the simplest way of explaining is that we were running around the planet collecting infectious disease samples to build a bank or a library of infectious diseases, which was

56:14.055 --> 56:15.716
But not really samples, right?

56:16.336 --> 56:18.398
They were actually sampling the genetics.

56:18.678 --> 56:42.117
So they were taking samples in a very similar way that Metobiota was, which is another partner of EcoHealth Alliance and another stooge organization that was out there perpetuating the myth, seeding the myth that there is an infinite variety of, as of yet, uncataloged pathogens that are evolving in the background and waiting to jump and kill us.

56:42.737 --> 56:56.249
And Nathan Wolf sold that story, and Peter Daszak sold that story, and here's Andrew Huff going to try and tell you that those people were covering up the fact that they actually just made this virus, which is of course absurd.

56:59.541 --> 57:00.921
I'm starting to keep laughing.

57:01.522 --> 57:02.422
This is so dark.

57:02.482 --> 57:03.683
I can't help it.

57:03.883 --> 57:10.366
The keeping laughing is the acting portion of this because he's acting as if he's never heard this before.

57:10.386 --> 57:14.829
He's acting as if they're not following a script and that he's not keeping them on it.

57:15.760 --> 57:20.502
Well, it was odd from the standpoint, I was still looking at this as a scientist trying to figure out what we were doing.

57:20.562 --> 57:27.246
And there's not a ton of publication value in cataloging infectious diseases.

57:27.266 --> 57:33.509
You can get one simple publication from identifying a new or novel pathogen in a species, but it's sort of a one and done thing.

57:33.529 --> 57:37.411
It doesn't really drive future research, right?

57:37.471 --> 57:44.835
So if you find you discover something, it's great, you found it, it's a publication, but that's not going to drive your next cycle of funding because typically you want to be very strategic about this.

57:45.635 --> 58:02.546
Well, then if you start to look at the other portfolio of research at Equal Alliance and what some of my peers, other vice presidents in their areas of research, what they're up to and the places where our employees had joint employment or co-employment with in the work that they were doing, it became apparently obvious.

58:03.386 --> 58:32.069
uh we're engaging in game it became apparently obvious you see it's a script he's trying to sound smart but actually he might not have the vocabulary that he's using and he might be making mistakes not because he's nervous but because he's lying it became apparently obvious you know function research uh and and viral discovery to make new novel pathogens

58:33.622 --> 58:38.524
And I'm buying a newer novel pathogen in a species, but it's sort of a one and done thing.

58:38.544 --> 58:42.426
It doesn't really drive future research, right?

58:42.506 --> 58:49.869
So if you find you discover something, it's great, you found it, it's a publication, but that's not going to drive your next cycle of funding because typically you want to be very strategic about this.

58:50.669 --> 59:07.658
Well, then if you start to look at the other portfolio of research at Equal Alliance and what some of my peers, other vice presidents in their areas of research, what they're up to and the places where our employees had joint employment or co-employment with in the work that they were doing, it became apparently obvious.

59:08.739 --> 59:16.523
We're engaging in gain-of-function research and viral discovery to make new novel pathogens.

59:18.095 --> 59:20.197
And I wanted nothing to do with it.

59:20.498 --> 59:23.481
Well, Grand Canyon University is not like most American colleges.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.903
It focuses on the things that actually matter.

59:26.324 --> 59:29.327
OK, so as I said, I'm going to come back to this video.

59:29.988 --> 59:38.436
What I want to do, first of all, is make sure that you understand that this message is a message for everyone, but it's not for anyone.

59:38.476 --> 59:40.358
It's going to be hard for people to hear this.

59:41.226 --> 59:48.751
It's going to be hard for them to accept the truth that American history is clouded behind lies and myths.

59:49.011 --> 01:00:00.900
And many, many, many books on our shelves are a part of those myths are there on purpose because books represent a kind of investment in a set of ideas.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:07.144
And if you understand that, if you don't invest like that in the truth, then the truth won't be available.

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:28.614
And now suddenly it should start to become obvious, if it hasn't already become so, that the opportunities that are represented by the publishing industry are amplified 10 or 100 times by the opportunities that are offered by skilled social media use.

01:00:29.194 --> 01:00:37.761
Skilled social media use will allow people to be bamboozled in a mass way, in a way that's personalized.

01:00:39.864 --> 01:00:51.337
And so it's no longer about the cover of a book, or the color of the cover, or the font on the cover, or the picture of the guy, or who the author is, and which talk shows they go on to promote the book anymore.

01:00:52.578 --> 01:01:00.067
We don't even need to do that really anymore, but people are still doing it, the guise of having a book as evidence of

01:01:02.256 --> 01:01:04.739
of scholarship is still being used.

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:06.801
That's why Pierre Cory has a book.

01:01:06.841 --> 01:01:09.104
That's why Jessica Rose has a book.

01:01:09.144 --> 01:01:13.148
That's why Robert Malone has three books.

01:01:13.228 --> 01:01:15.491
These aren't real people with real ideas.

01:01:17.472 --> 01:01:30.198
You can't compare their books to the books that were written by, say, for example, Buckminster Fuller, for example.

01:01:30.258 --> 01:01:35.860
Those are books that have ideas that he's trying to offer and develop and ask for a challenge to.

01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:43.804
The book, The Lies My Government Told Me, might as well be a novel written by an AI chatbot.

01:01:44.795 --> 01:01:47.796
as opposed to an emu farmer in Northern Virginia.

01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:52.139
We are being fooled.

01:01:52.479 --> 01:01:53.739
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:01:53.819 --> 01:01:59.062
is probably the number one victim of the American military-industrial complex.

01:02:03.832 --> 01:02:14.522
whatever it is that's responsible for JFK and RFK and Estes Kefauver and probably, I don't know, Martin Luther King and all these others.

01:02:15.663 --> 01:02:19.607
Oklahoma City bombing, 9-11, it's all one control grid.

01:02:19.647 --> 01:02:21.329
Yes, I'm totally down with that.

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:28.836
But then that means that there are lots of actors that have been coerced and trained and brainwashed

01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:36.916
and cajoled into performing for us and many, many more that are doing it willingly.

01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:40.598
You know, like, I don't know, like Joe Rogan, for example, he doesn't care.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.122
You think Jeff Bezos cares that he's fake?

01:02:45.142 --> 01:02:50.646
Do you think Elon Musk cares that he's fake or that Peter Thiel cares if he's fake?

01:02:51.327 --> 01:02:57.271
As long as he's part of this ruling slave trade class?

01:02:58.432 --> 01:02:59.513
Because they're not elite.

01:03:01.052 --> 01:03:04.173
Calling them elite is calling them what they want to be called.

01:03:04.373 --> 01:03:06.594
Call them slavers, because that's what they are.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:08.855
Slavers don't care about race.

01:03:10.936 --> 01:03:12.217
Slaver is a class.

01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:16.118
And we are not in that class.

01:03:16.158 --> 01:03:17.379
This is for all the marbles.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.960
They want our grandchildren in the slave class.

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:26.623
And social media is the way that we will voluntarily enslave ourselves if we are not careful.

01:03:27.984 --> 01:03:31.405
and we will voluntarily enslave our children if we are not careful.

01:03:31.425 --> 01:03:34.526
What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?

01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:38.587
Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.

01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:40.927
The first is to get testing out there.

01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:55.491
I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean- So at the end of 2024, before the handover to Trump, they had Liana Nguyen still on TV now talking about bird flu.

01:03:57.185 --> 01:03:59.847
And you might think, oh yeah, but that's the TV narrative.

01:03:59.888 --> 01:04:01.049
That's the way this works.

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:08.095
But no, because actually the anti-vax movement was also talking about bird flu.

01:04:08.776 --> 01:04:13.520
And you just said you're not seeing any difference in the pasteurized milk.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.942
Pasteurization is not designed to get rid of viruses.

01:04:18.362 --> 01:04:21.684
It is just not able to get rid of viruses.

01:04:21.704 --> 01:04:25.046
So viruses will persist in pasteurized milk.

01:04:25.066 --> 01:04:31.369
The only reason we pasteurize milk is so it doesn't spoil quickly, so we can have it last for a longer period of time.

01:04:31.889 --> 01:04:34.670
So, you know, there is the, you know.

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:37.752
So in 2013, Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:38.772
In the early 2000s, this chick

01:04:40.413 --> 01:04:47.945
was on over 90 billboards in the UK bringing awareness to autism by putting herself out there in a bra.

01:04:49.507 --> 01:04:55.056
And, according to those billboards, also swaying more than 6 million votes for Prime Minister.

01:04:56.087 --> 01:05:00.190
Now she has a palatial estate in Austin, Texas.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:05.833
Not that far away from where Andrew Wakefield also has an estate in Austin, Texas.

01:05:05.853 --> 01:05:10.356
You know that, that far away from where Joe Rogan has an estate in Austin, Texas.

01:05:10.376 --> 01:05:16.599
You know that, that far away from where Barry Weiss has a university in Austin, Texas.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:25.565
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one fraudulent, malevolent show of actors that are part of the controlled demolition of American culture.

01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:30.310
The fake health freedom movement is the controlled demolition of American culture.

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:40.075
The lifelong now fraud of Pauly Tommy and Brian Hooker is a UK-US trader organization.

01:05:42.074 --> 01:05:43.035
cooperation.

01:05:43.195 --> 01:05:44.737
You want to see conspiracy?

01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:54.047
It is UK actors, Commonwealth actors, acting with clowns at CHD and behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:54.528 --> 01:05:58.513
propelling this fake conservative movement in America right now.

01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:10.456
These people are all very, very bad people on a very shitty script, playing very shitty fraudulent roles, fooling young people in America.

01:06:10.516 --> 01:06:19.340
The last bastion of freedom on earth is being demolished culturally by being undermined.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:26.003
But the only people that should be good on the internet are actually actors.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:36.585
The safety benefits of pasteurization against avian influenza really, really don't exist.

01:06:39.809 --> 01:06:42.592
But avian flu influenza definitely exists.

01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:54.010
And so even though we all have a timeline, and I have been trying to teach these people for so long what's going on, I was fooled at some point, by drastic.

01:06:54.690 --> 01:07:05.435
I was fooled until about July 2020, and then I got fooled again, because July 2020, after I said we shouldn't transfect kids, and after I said they're lying about a background with bullshit PCR,

01:07:06.776 --> 01:07:11.257
That's when my life got turned upside down, because that's when I met all these people.

01:07:11.317 --> 01:07:12.938
That's when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:12.998 --> 01:07:15.519
said he wanted to support me.

01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:18.740
That's when Senator Ron Johnson called me.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:33.964
And for the next three years, I was played by all these people to keep my mouth shut, or to yell in the wrong direction, or to chase the wrong ghosts, in hope that I would too end up believing that indeed it was a lab leak, and they did cover it up, but I never fell for it.

01:07:34.952 --> 01:07:39.254
I tried desperately to get some of these people to stop saying it, and they never did.

01:07:39.954 --> 01:07:44.856
And they still won't, because they are all part of a national security theater.

01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:56.039
The same as Tucker Carlson, the same as Jay Bhattacharya, the same as Aseem Malhotra, the same as Veera Sharma, or Pierre Cory, or Ryan Cole.

01:07:56.099 --> 01:08:03.082
Not the same as my friend Nathan, who's now dead because him and his family took a shot that I couldn't convince him not to take.

01:08:10.188 --> 01:08:17.214
And so I try to describe these people as accurately as possible, and I think the most accurate description is Team Worst Case Scenario.

01:08:17.314 --> 01:08:27.123
It is a group of people that was scripted with different complementary narratives that would provide sufficient smoke and mirrors for people to get lost for a few years.

01:08:27.683 --> 01:08:38.867
the no viruses at all people did that, the people who said we needed to fear the natural viruses because they're all over the place, and the people who said that we needed to fear gain-of-function RNA molecules.

01:08:38.927 --> 01:08:53.273
It's all one malevolent show because no matter who you argued with or what time team you defected to, you were always going to in the end believe that COVID came, that it was really nasty, and that it could come again because they can make them.

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.595
And so this team worst case scenario was on social media.

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:06.685
And when they are on social media and you interact with them, it really feels like you're doing something.

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:10.667
It really feels like, you know, that you're gonna convince people.

01:09:10.727 --> 01:09:29.125
And if you tweet the right thing, or you post the right post on Facebook, or you make the right movie, if you're somebody riding their bike and trying to do something real on social media, if you think you're gonna make the right stream, or say the right thing, or the right slide deck is gonna snap everybody out of it, if you just show it to these people, you're wrong.

01:09:29.943 --> 01:09:37.728
because I presented more than a few hours to all of these people on multiple occasions over multiple years and they just ignored me.

01:09:37.808 --> 01:09:40.150
Wow, you're the smartest guy we've ever heard of.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:41.531
God.

01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:47.675
And they're still in front of America and in front of a lot of the other countries right now.

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:50.076
They're still doing their show.

01:09:50.136 --> 01:09:51.577
They're still touring the world.

01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:58.162
Even Robert Malone was just recently trying to establish a European version of Maha not three weeks ago.

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.729
So it's important to put these into perspective.

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:13.172
Trial Site News, terrible, a wonderful resource to find out who was acting in front of us.

01:10:13.352 --> 01:10:18.115
Because everybody that was on Trial Site News was basically part of Team Robert Malone.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:21.736
So from looking at the predict partner, so we had Metabiota, which has a checkered pass.

01:10:21.776 --> 01:10:25.218
If you go search into Metabiota, Nathan Wolf led that.

01:10:25.238 --> 01:10:28.359
So the first thing you're going to notice here is that Robert Malone and

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:37.104
And Andrew Huff are going to enact a similar kind of script where they're kind of working it out together.

01:10:37.605 --> 01:10:50.133
They know that they have a common list of things they want to say, and they're going to pretend as though they haven't worked it out in advance by using language that seems to imply this is the first time we've talked about it.

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:58.138
And also what I find very curious about this interview from three years ago is the amount of military lingo that they try to throw in here.

01:10:58.639 --> 01:11:00.340
And I'm not sure if that's to give

01:11:00.881 --> 01:11:04.913
his background a more military

01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:12.864
feel to it, or whether it's to give Robert Malone's background a little more military feel to it.

01:11:13.305 --> 01:11:30.293
Sometimes it's hard to tell whether this interview is more about blowing sunshine up Robert Malone's, you know, image by trying to make it seem like he's the old, you know, wise man with all this experience talking to this younger guy about this stuff that they both know a little bit about.

01:11:31.234 --> 01:11:33.615
And it's a remarkable rehearsal.

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:35.376
It's a remarkable audition.

01:11:35.996 --> 01:11:44.098
And if you think about the fact that this is just before his book comes out, I think, or just after, it's very, very curious.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:56.941
An organization, and there were a number of disputes with foreign countries over insurance they were going to provide, or informing insurance policies based on their pandemic prediction models, as I recall.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:58.101
Very strange.

01:11:58.121 --> 01:12:05.043
I think I saved one of my friends who said that he wanted to go work at Meda Ballera, and I told him that, no, you don't want to do that, while I was working at EcoHealth.

01:12:05.757 --> 01:12:11.743
Let me just show you here the chat on PeerTube.

01:12:11.823 --> 01:12:12.784
Don't I have that here?

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:14.371
Here it is.

01:12:14.692 --> 01:12:16.313
That's the chat on PeerTube.

01:12:16.353 --> 01:12:20.657
There's Ted B. And there's AM23GP.

01:12:20.717 --> 01:12:24.019
So the thing is, there's no real login right now.

01:12:24.059 --> 01:12:25.280
We haven't worked that out yet.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:30.765
There's a script that needs to be done so that the login on the soapbox will also work with the PeerTube.

01:12:30.785 --> 01:12:33.667
We're trying to figure that out, but that's beyond my skill set.

01:12:34.528 --> 01:12:36.650
So right now you kind of have to just make a...

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.154
come up with a screen name and use it, and then you can chat right there.

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:43.997
And I can put it up on the screen and see it there.

01:12:44.078 --> 01:12:46.340
I believe that should be the current chat.

01:12:47.481 --> 01:12:49.704
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know, yes, that's how it works.

01:12:49.724 --> 01:12:50.845
There's no real log in there.

01:12:50.885 --> 01:12:52.287
Thanks for being here, though.

01:12:52.587 --> 01:12:56.831
We had these three organizations, and even though that UC Davis was the prime,

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:03.432
Each organization was always fighting with the other organizations for who could have the most country.

01:13:03.472 --> 01:13:06.633
So they're all fighting for control of the program.

01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:10.114
And the strange thing- Just to say control of the money.

01:13:10.634 --> 01:13:12.015
Control of the money, yes.

01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:18.077
So UC Davis School of Vet Med was the prime contractor and you were a subcontractor in this.

01:13:18.417 --> 01:13:18.897
Is that right?

01:13:19.377 --> 01:13:21.758
Technically, but it was never treated that way.

01:13:22.959 --> 01:13:29.203
And Dr. Gassig made it a priority for us to do really well at the time so we could have more of the pie, so to speak, which makes sense.

01:13:30.464 --> 01:13:38.989
What didn't make sense either retrospectively or when I was involved was that there were sort of frenemies, all the different organizations.

01:13:39.009 --> 01:13:44.312
So we had to share genetic data or other data that were being collected and put into collective databases.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:46.073
What

01:13:47.512 --> 01:13:53.388
It's very strange because I felt like equal health, at least as far as I could tell, was the only one that was collecting intelligence.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.551
for potentially the agency, I guess.

01:13:57.951 --> 01:14:19.054
But that doesn't mean that that's reality, because it's hard for me to believe that a bunch of- Remember, one possibility is that Andrew Huff himself is not sophisticated enough to know whether the documents that he reads are plausible biologically, or what stage they might be in after he reads the document and then talks to somebody about it.

01:14:19.094 --> 01:14:22.415
He might not have the requisite molecular or biological knowledge.

01:14:23.115 --> 01:14:32.646
to know the fraud that infectious clone technology is and that it's just recombinant DNA made in large pure quantities and then transfected into cell cultures.

01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:37.131
He himself doesn't need to know that and in fact it is

01:14:38.413 --> 01:14:53.367
It is highly likely that he lacks the biological knowledge to know that gain of function is ridiculous and instead is being played right here as we speak by somebody who maybe he was put inside of that organization.

01:14:53.427 --> 01:15:02.616
Maybe he was put in there by somebody else under some other pretenses and now he's starting to find out why he might've been put in there.

01:15:03.723 --> 01:15:07.006
and what his role might be as he's out of there now.

01:15:07.626 --> 01:15:19.896
I don't really know how to gauge this, but I do know for sure that these two feel as though they're feeling each other out on camera, but in a semi-artificial way.

01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:24.080
They are more familiar with one another than what they are pretending to be in this video.

01:15:24.855 --> 01:15:27.056
but they're still work colleagues somehow.

01:15:27.616 --> 01:15:32.878
Academics at UC Davis can be sucked into the intelligence collection activity.

01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:47.424
And if you look at the countries that Equal Health Alliance was assigned, they would be the high-risk bioterrorism countries or countries that would potentially have bioweapons programs that we'd be concerned with.

01:15:48.767 --> 01:15:54.111
And I don't know if that was by design or just random chance.

01:15:54.231 --> 01:16:01.035
And this was, this was USAID money or this was, uh, this was USAID money.

01:16:01.996 --> 01:16:10.441
So the prediction, the prime contract was USAID to UC Davis vet med, and then you were technically subs to them.

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:11.282
Correct.

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.770
Okay, cool.

01:16:13.011 --> 01:16:14.071
And how many other subs?

01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:19.215
It was EcoHealth and- Well, then once you get to the subs of the subs, that's where it gets really interesting.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:35.966
So once you contracted and once you work through a country like Jordan, for example, then we'd contract usually with a research institution if we could, a university, maybe a ministry of agriculture, a ministry of health or- Okay, so those were your subs, secondary subs.

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:41.710
But you were the EcoHealth was the prime sub to School of Vet Med?

01:16:43.030 --> 01:17:08.059
Okay, so the money pipeline goes USAID, School of Veterinary Med, you've named the program officer, we can hunt down their academic appointment in their department, and then it goes to EcoHealth for the countries that are higher risk for, I'm assuming,

01:17:11.288 --> 01:17:26.151
let's just say nefarious activities, and then you would contract for your surveillance and data gathering activity with in-country expertise.

01:17:26.831 --> 01:17:35.813
So you were basically washing USAID money and engaging with

01:17:38.428 --> 01:17:42.671
useful entities and individuals in those regions.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:55.318
And as I recall from my interactions with various of these players, one of the main objectives is to move towards some sort of general data gathering capability

01:17:57.025 --> 01:18:15.855
that would allow early warning signals to be detected, suggestive of some regional player messing about with things and causing some cluster of outbreak signal that would have an unusual pattern in terms of

01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:19.278
various laboratory markers.

01:18:19.359 --> 01:18:22.042
It's surprisingly Bret Weinstein-esque.

01:18:22.502 --> 01:18:35.317
This is like the Steven Seagal of podcasting, Bret Weinstein or Lex Friedman, trying to find as many words as possible to use between point A and point B.

01:18:36.898 --> 01:18:57.326
Basically what he's saying here is that a surveillance program that would look for outbreak signals like a cluster of cases that was standing out as odd in the background and he says it with as many obfuscating words as possible and then he's gonna say something like good copy or something like that and it's ridiculous.

01:18:58.607 --> 01:19:07.179
diagnostic findings that would be potentially picked up through cellular traffic or other types of information feeds.

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.481
Does that sound about right?

01:19:09.076 --> 01:19:09.977
That sounds about right.

01:19:09.997 --> 01:19:15.040
The bigger picture, the 10,000 foot level now to the ability that would actually be effective.

01:19:16.441 --> 01:19:17.121
I don't think it is.

01:19:17.141 --> 01:19:21.004
I mean, there's a simple way and you're a medical doctor.

01:19:21.464 --> 01:19:26.628
I mean, the only way that you're going to pick this up is if you clinically diagnose someone and you test something and you find it in a sample.

01:19:27.288 --> 01:19:29.570
Using a lot of corollary data, which is after

01:19:31.991 --> 01:19:47.404
the event, so to speak, is not necessarily the best way to collect this type of intelligence and for the biological samples that they were collecting, they weren't collecting sufficient sample sizes, and they weren't systematically or routinely collecting samples through the PREDICT program.

01:19:47.444 --> 01:19:49.466
It was almost laughable at the size of the budget.

01:19:50.026 --> 01:20:16.130
So that's one of your main points, is that if this was intended for its purported purpose, it was poorly designed for that, and so you believe, or you're suggesting, because of the exclusive focus on coronavirus, and particularly MERS-like viruses, which at the time everybody was scared silly about, in retrospect,

01:20:17.048 --> 01:20:21.950
you know, in any case, clearly things have played out otherwise.

01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:37.436
But so you were being engaged to operate in largely the Middle Eastern desert communities that were more politically risky to

01:20:39.437 --> 01:20:56.708
specifically perform surveillance for MERS-like coronaviruses that may be circulating in those populations in terms of the physical sample collection activity as opposed to the information processing technology.

01:20:56.909 --> 01:20:57.089
Over.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:59.370
Good copy.

01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:01.932
So my take on that is

01:21:04.312 --> 01:21:11.714
Well, first of all, I volunteered for the North African and Middle Eastern countries based on my combat experience in the Middle East.

01:21:13.115 --> 01:21:21.977
I knew because of those experiences, I understood the culture, where the risks probably could be from actually going over there and having to do the work and politically how to handle situations.

01:21:21.997 --> 01:21:24.258
Because a lot of this I realized was just very political.

01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:25.378
It was very difficult.

01:21:25.498 --> 01:21:28.739
And you were, at the time, you were SOCOM or you were Army or what?

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:30.645
Please keep in mind.

01:21:31.405 --> 01:21:50.959
Let me just go over here really quick right behind me here You can see that I have a jewel sign behind my one that this is my one phage and then up there I have another phage so I'm coming to you every day from between two phages and actually that that that light right there is a jewel light that I got off of a

01:21:52.007 --> 01:22:10.954
That I got off of Craigslist in 2020 Or maybe 2021 And it's not there for nothing just so you know Just so you know, it's not there for nothing Not there for nothing When I was in Iraq

01:22:11.604 --> 01:22:12.645
Yeah.

01:22:12.805 --> 01:22:25.414
So my first appointment, I served in OIF, the end of OIF2 and all of OIF3, which would have been the end of 2004, all of 2005, when things were pretty intense, and then left at the very end of 2005.

01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:28.876
Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF, is that what he said?

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.758
You were combat?

01:22:30.858 --> 01:22:32.519
Oh, you're infantry, you're about to say, OK.

01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:33.319
OK.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.362
So I served in the heat of it.

01:22:36.382 --> 01:22:38.063
I actually have PTSD.

01:22:40.504 --> 01:22:43.386
It'd be funny if Robert Malone said, I have PTSD, too.

01:22:43.466 --> 01:22:45.948
I worked for this crazy Indian named Inder Verma.

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:46.988
He was a jackass.

01:22:47.769 --> 01:22:56.435
I have nightmares and a heightened sense of anxiety from it, but it's sort of a joke that I think about halfway through our deployment,

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:13.111
40 or 45% of my company were on either antidepressants or sleep medications and everybody had issues and nobody was really talking, talking about that everyone started talking about it so yeah we actually you know I served in the height of it fought in the height of it.

01:23:14.312 --> 01:23:14.592
I get it.

01:23:14.952 --> 01:23:15.273
Okay.

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:24.598
So, so that's your, your, your kind of got a battlefield experience, cultural awareness, um, uh, field operational cape.

01:23:24.898 --> 01:23:25.278
Look at him.

01:23:25.298 --> 01:23:26.479
Look down at his script.

01:23:26.519 --> 01:23:34.003
We're trying to make you into as much of a superhero as possible without making you seem too much like Deadpool, but abilities.

01:23:34.827 --> 01:23:37.969
and that are kind of have to do with your cultural awareness.

01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:50.155
And so you feel comfortable operating in those theaters, and that was, you were tasked with, and that was an unmet need that EcoHealth was helping fulfill.

01:23:51.836 --> 01:23:57.099
How do you, what is your inference about the exclusive focus on the coronavirus collection?

01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:58.280
How did that operate?

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.861
Were they going collecting camel poop or?

01:24:01.482 --> 01:24:05.288
blood samples from camel drivers or what was going on there?

01:24:05.929 --> 01:24:14.642
Well, the first thing that we always do is you look at the budget and you look at the budget and see how much can we accomplish with these funds and how low of a rate can we negotiate with the partner.

01:24:15.966 --> 01:24:20.068
So then right away, viral isolation is very expensive for a sample.

01:24:20.108 --> 01:24:26.271
So then you start looking at that cost and figuring that into the budget, travel, all these things, the necessary costs.

01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:29.472
Then you take a look at it and say, well, let's see what we can get.

01:24:29.512 --> 01:24:30.832
So can we get fecal samples?

01:24:31.193 --> 01:24:34.154
Can we get sputum or some kind of nasal swab?

01:24:36.915 --> 01:24:56.943
or any other excretions from the antelope you know you want to collect as many samples of different types of fluids because you never know you're going to find something and that's that's a it's a fishing expedition that's not really surveillance by definition either because the definition of surveillance is the systematic collection of samples or information to then hopefully get an early warning to prevent something from happening.

01:24:57.603 --> 01:25:05.207
while fishing for going on a... And that's not... he's not going too far away from advocating that I just want to do it right.

01:25:06.027 --> 01:25:08.708
I would be able to run an organization that would do it right.

01:25:08.848 --> 01:25:12.190
Any real surveillance would be all the time and ongoing.

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:18.493
It's almost like he's arguing that EcoHealth Alliance had it right on paper but was lying in person.

01:25:18.933 --> 01:25:25.656
And so he seems to be scripted with a certain set of expertise that might be useful in the future.

01:25:25.736 --> 01:25:26.517
Isn't that weird?

01:25:27.639 --> 01:25:33.420
global hunt for viruses is not a systematic collection of information.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:39.121
So back to the state admission of what the project program was and what they were claiming to do, it wasn't doing any of those things.

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:43.582
It was simply just collecting information and hunting for viruses, which I found.

01:25:43.642 --> 01:25:54.584
And I can tell you from working closely with the DITRA chem biodefense folks, they're not always the sharpest tools in the shed and they could,

01:25:55.819 --> 01:26:03.485
you know, they, my sense is they often see their mission space as more pilot program like, not.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:08.468
And so nevermind DITRA, they're just dumb and they just do pilot programs.

01:26:08.508 --> 01:26:10.670
They don't even take their own work seriously.

01:26:12.151 --> 01:26:20.317
Imagine saying that when both these people have worked for DITRA, they've gotten money from DITRA, but DITRA doesn't really do anything.

01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:22.759
They're just kind of a pilot program type thing.

01:26:23.359 --> 01:26:24.120
Imagine that.

01:26:25.162 --> 01:26:35.029
It's almost like they're on a script to make sure that nobody ever looks at DITRA, the organization that was supposedly going around the world, making sure that everybody disassembled and put away their nukes carefully.

01:26:39.412 --> 01:26:42.054
Not a more comprehensive operational.

01:26:42.074 --> 01:26:47.497
They're often trying to prove a concept that then gets passed off to bigger funding.

01:26:47.517 --> 01:26:51.060
Does that comport with your experience?

01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:52.094
Yeah, absolutely.

01:26:52.134 --> 01:26:56.537
And it depends on the program manager that gets assigned to your project.

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:03.220
Some program managers are very much go-getters, want to be involved, are interested.

01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:11.945
And some program managers are just passing their time to get a good review on their portfolio so they can make the next lateral movement or advance in Washington, D.C.

01:27:12.225 --> 01:27:14.827
They were part of the Emerging Pandemic Threats Program.

01:27:15.547 --> 01:27:27.752
But what became weird was every time we were operating in a different country is that you'd get the USAID people in the mission assigned to that country and whatever State Department people were associated with it.

01:27:27.772 --> 01:27:29.253
So there's a lot of appointees.

01:27:29.633 --> 01:27:32.595
So it was a wide variety of characters.

01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:37.757
There were certain leadership personnel that were always involved.

01:27:38.806 --> 01:27:52.831
But depending on which country that shifted dramatically, but I didn't ask answer your earlier questions on that about the funding and how this ties back into equal health alliance so there are a number of organizations funding equal health alliance.

01:27:53.411 --> 01:27:56.052
So private foundations the Google Foundation the school foundation.

01:27:57.012 --> 01:28:00.896
So a lot of big foundations funding one-off projects.

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:05.059
And just because it's a non-profit organization does not mean that it's not profitable.

01:28:05.219 --> 01:28:09.943
So we're actually quite profitable, especially when I start bringing money into the organization.

01:28:10.684 --> 01:28:14.087
Things were improving, profits were increasing at the organization.

01:28:14.147 --> 01:28:41.273
I mean, if CHD is paying Brian Hooker a quarter million dollars a year, and paying Mary Holland a quarter million dollars a year, and paying Pauly Tommy's film production company a quarter million dollars a year, and paying other people, you know, a hundred thousand dollars a year, you can see very quickly, if they have 70 employees, then... If they have 70 employees building a big top tent for health freedom with no real...

01:28:43.482 --> 01:28:44.863
tangible goals.

01:28:48.525 --> 01:28:49.546
And that's where we are.

01:28:49.566 --> 01:28:59.393
A fake conservative populist movement in America that is basically headed by state puppets.

01:29:00.894 --> 01:29:03.436
Deep state puppets.

01:29:04.276 --> 01:29:05.357
NATO puppets.

01:29:05.597 --> 01:29:07.398
I don't know what kind of puppets they are.

01:29:07.518 --> 01:29:08.539
CDC puppets?

01:29:08.659 --> 01:29:08.999
Maybe?

01:29:09.019 --> 01:29:10.100
Pharma puppets?

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:10.640
Maybe?

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.221
I don't know.

01:29:12.898 --> 01:29:14.299
Ditra puppets, maybe?

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:28.405
It's not my job to figure out who pays the frauds, but definitely it should be somebody's job to pay, to figure out who pays these frauds because they are paid to be in front of us.

01:29:28.445 --> 01:29:29.805
They are put in front of us.

01:29:29.845 --> 01:29:32.567
They are programmed to be in front of us.

01:29:33.027 --> 01:29:42.071
And now, four years after this video, Tucker Carlson is promoting this guy as a real whistleblower about a gain of function virus

01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:57.747
produced in Wuhan, China, the exact same lie that the former director of the Health and Human Services, or sorry, former director of the Human Genome Project, the research and development director, Kevin McKernan, also told

01:29:58.428 --> 01:30:05.790
on a podcast, the same story that Charles Rixey was put out there to tell, the same story that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:25.634
has been scripted to tell, the same story that so many of these people are out there scripted to tell when it is a fantasy, it is a mythology that is necessary for the deep state operation, the national security state operation of the pandemic to take full hold in the next generation.

01:30:28.018 --> 01:30:33.443
The only skeptical adults can be the skeptical adults that think we made it.

01:30:33.543 --> 01:30:35.265
Now, listen carefully to this.

01:30:35.325 --> 01:30:36.807
I'm just going to show you this piece of paper.

01:30:36.867 --> 01:30:38.408
It's not very well organized.

01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:42.332
But I've been trying to think about this.

01:30:42.392 --> 01:30:49.079
So the coronavirus, JFK, and 9-11 are all big conspiracy theories in the past.

01:30:49.619 --> 01:30:51.741
And they all seem to have a too

01:30:52.935 --> 01:31:09.185
Basic two narrative either the US government did it but we don't really have any control because it's kind of natural Or the US government or somebody did it because it's a man-made disaster and they're super evil and they can control everything JFK it's kind of the same thing either.

01:31:09.245 --> 01:31:10.906
It's like they have no control.

01:31:11.006 --> 01:31:16.550
It's just there's some evil people in the world some bad actors or there's complete control and

01:31:18.044 --> 01:31:22.668
And so much complete control that they can kill the president and his brother and get away with it.

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:25.691
And no one ever knows, even though there's lots and lots of books written.

01:31:26.392 --> 01:31:28.133
I know that that's not a perfect thing yet.

01:31:28.173 --> 01:31:30.776
It's just something I jotted down while I was listening to this now.

01:31:31.216 --> 01:31:33.018
And then 9-11 is kind of the same thing.

01:31:33.058 --> 01:31:35.700
It's no control because it's just Islamic terrorists.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.782
You know, they're just dicks and they hate our freedom.

01:31:38.223 --> 01:31:39.384
And that's a less evil,

01:31:39.864 --> 01:31:47.810
than if there were space lasers and it was done on purpose because they wanted to get the Patriot Act in or collect insurance or the Jews did it.

01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:52.913
And so what's weird is that in this narrative, the Jews almost so maybe did it.

01:31:53.273 --> 01:31:55.835
In this narrative, the Jews also maybe did it.

01:31:55.955 --> 01:32:06.423
And so it's a strange place that we are because there is a conservative populist movement, a subsect of which believes that the Jews did all of this.

01:32:07.284 --> 01:32:11.948
There's a conservative populist movement that believes that, of course, the Jews didn't do it.

01:32:11.968 --> 01:32:13.790
It's the bankers that did all of this.

01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:26.000
And there is a part of the conservative movement that thinks that Americans, like the Masons, or Freemasons did it, or the City of London does it, and the Vatican does it.

01:32:28.524 --> 01:32:34.451
But it's an all-powerful control of the narrative, time and time again.

01:32:34.531 --> 01:32:37.394
So you might as well just go limp and not fight it.

01:32:38.916 --> 01:32:44.102
Now the extraordinary thing about it is, is that all of the actors in front of us now, all of them,

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:59.974
have opined about all of these narratives and opined about all of these narratives specifically about the natural or the lab leak or the bad guys or the the CIA or it's the

01:33:00.854 --> 01:33:20.813
it's the the bad guys or it's the jews right and the cia so it's a very strange kind of dichotomy of bullshit that we are presented with each time and then each time we are presented with a cast of characters arguing about these possibilities and it is striking

01:33:22.372 --> 01:33:24.953
And credit Mark Kulak for pointing this out.

01:33:25.014 --> 01:33:37.761
It is striking that now, in 2025, the 9-11 narrative need to be opened and curated again by none other than Tucker Carlson, also featured on the RFK frontline thing.

01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:43.544
Tucker Carlson also did a lot on JFK and RFK.

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:46.826
Tucker Carlson was key to the coronavirus, promoted...

01:33:47.682 --> 01:33:54.189
drastic in 2021 as an organization started by by Mr. Jamie Metzl.

01:33:57.892 --> 01:34:09.885
And so it's really strange right now that actually American history and our interpretation of it due to our skillful use of the internet could actually set us free.

01:34:11.877 --> 01:34:16.622
because each one of these narratives is curated in a very similar way.

01:34:16.682 --> 01:34:23.929
It's just evolved over time as our access to people's consciousness has become more and more complete.

01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:30.355
In the time of RFK, we had newspapers and magazines and a couple of TV programs.

01:34:33.238 --> 01:34:36.401
In the time of 9-11, we had a little bit more than that.

01:34:38.447 --> 01:34:52.259
And then in coronavirus, now we have really the next generation of social media out there so that the compartmentalization, the personalization of your own reality is now very possible.

01:34:54.361 --> 01:34:58.785
And people can focus on exactly what they want to focus on for their entire day.

01:35:00.687 --> 01:35:04.190
And so the vast majority of people that don't want to see will never see.

01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:23.242
The very small minority that would like to see will only see this, and more importantly will only see a nearly infinite sea of actors arguing about this script and accepting the basic premises of the mystery science theater that is recent American history.

01:35:25.206 --> 01:35:37.977
And they would love it if Andrew Huff could be another character in that story for you, because the more characters there are that are not at all relevant for reality, the more enslaved you become.

01:35:39.363 --> 01:35:42.825
Well, what does a nonprofit do with basically unrestricted funds?

01:35:43.586 --> 01:35:45.307
You invest that back into research.

01:35:45.347 --> 01:35:51.711
And I think Dr. Malone, you'll understand this, but I think a lot of people outside of science don't understand the simple fact.

01:35:52.351 --> 01:36:00.856
When you submit a proposal to a sponsoring entity, whether that is a drug manufacturer, the pharmaceutical industry, the U.S.

01:36:00.896 --> 01:36:05.119
government agency, you typically already have the first work done in the proposal before you submit it.

01:36:05.399 --> 01:36:07.601
Now that's a funny thing for him to say, isn't it?

01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:22.256
Because that's exactly the same thing that I'm quoted as saying in the Wuhan cover-up book, and it's exactly the same thing that four years later, three years after this interview, Kevin McKernan was scripted to say on the Danny Jones podcast.

01:36:23.143 --> 01:36:26.565
scripted to say that when you submit a grant, you already have it done.

01:36:27.025 --> 01:36:37.852
It's funny that he said that in 2022 in an interview with Robert Malone, the deep state actor that has been scripting Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and the actors of CHD for a decade.

01:36:39.403 --> 01:36:58.870
Very strange that the same thing was said by the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project on a podcast with millions of followers on a podcast hosted by a guy who was encouraged to podcast by Hulk Hogan, the beneficiary of Peter Thiel, our gay space vampire leaders, you know, lawsuit against Gawker.

01:37:00.307 --> 01:37:06.351
It's a very small little club of shitheads and he's auditioning to be a part of it in 2022.

01:37:06.772 --> 01:37:12.036
And it looks like his dreams have finally come true in 2025 because he got on Tucker.

01:37:13.217 --> 01:37:21.082
And if you really, ideally you have about the first year of results, if not the first third of the proposed scope.

01:37:21.603 --> 01:37:23.404
I was just going to go there and I get the best scientists.

01:37:23.424 --> 01:37:28.728
They know I have a friend that is actually three years ahead in his, his grant site cycle funding.

01:37:29.079 --> 01:37:31.664
I have a friend, he's black, so I'm not racist.

01:37:31.864 --> 01:37:36.853
I have a friend and he's on tenure track and he's three years ahead on his grant schedule.

01:37:37.294 --> 01:37:40.540
Therefore, I have evidence that everybody does it this way.

01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:43.148
It's so dumb.

01:37:43.769 --> 01:37:44.529
It's so dumb.

01:37:45.409 --> 01:37:53.673
And you become so good at this that there's no... The reason why it's dumb is because academic grants are that way.

01:37:54.113 --> 01:37:58.495
But DARPA grants and DITRA grants and DOD grants are not.

01:37:58.995 --> 01:38:03.837
And anybody that's in that field that claims to have gotten billions of dollars from

01:38:04.457 --> 01:38:12.463
from the government and helped people get billions of dollars and sat on committees that gave away billions of dollars would frickin' know that.

01:38:14.524 --> 01:38:32.337
That's why people in DITRA and DARPA think of themselves as doing pilot projects because they're doing experiments that they proposed to do but haven't tried because responding to a grant call that's way outside of their defined expertise in terms of science.

01:38:35.737 --> 01:38:38.259
Ladies and gentlemen, this stunt is over.

01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:40.280
This show is over.

01:38:40.821 --> 01:38:47.566
As soon as the world wants to wake up to the fraud that is happening in America right now, we can turn this ship around.

01:38:47.626 --> 01:38:50.068
We could stop whatever is going on in Israel.

01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:56.613
We could restore the national borders and the currencies of the individual countries of the EU.

01:38:56.633 --> 01:38:58.814
We could end the EU Central Bank.

01:38:59.234 --> 01:39:00.415
We could end the Fed.

01:39:00.796 --> 01:39:04.859
We could just do these things if we wanted to, but it cannot be done.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:06.360
on social media.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.185
It will never happen if we try to skillfully use social media against these people.

01:39:12.586 --> 01:39:16.690
It can't happen if we use their vocabulary against them.

01:39:18.791 --> 01:39:29.902
And it won't happen if we try to use their provided heroes as proxies by sending this guy an email and convincing him of something you're not gonna help.

01:39:32.501 --> 01:39:36.884
easier money or money to obtain or get than the work that you've already completed.

01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:40.806
And you sort of sit on it, you polish it, and then you start to get to this point where you can cut and paste out of it.

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:43.948
Okay, so you know, everybody's got a timeline, right?

01:39:44.528 --> 01:39:46.609
Everybody has a timeline.

01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:48.910
So let's just keep working in this timeline.

01:39:49.271 --> 01:39:50.431
It would be terrible, wouldn't it?

01:39:50.471 --> 01:39:53.093
It would be absolutely terrible.

01:39:54.119 --> 01:39:59.322
if his timeline in 2022 contained an Alex Jones appearance, wouldn't it?

01:39:59.863 --> 01:40:00.563
It would just be terrible.

01:40:00.583 --> 01:40:03.885
So you have to ask yourself, you know, when the hell is this insanity going to stop?

01:40:03.945 --> 01:40:05.286
I mean, we have to do something about it.

01:40:05.446 --> 01:40:06.346
That's why I wrote the book.

01:40:07.007 --> 01:40:11.910
And, you know, I realized the psyop that's been going on against the American people is this.

01:40:13.444 --> 01:40:18.325
They try to confuse this whole discussion about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID.

01:40:18.485 --> 01:40:22.006
Just so you know, if you have this book and you want to send it to me, please do so.

01:40:22.046 --> 01:40:23.226
You can send it to the P.O.

01:40:23.266 --> 01:40:23.567
Box.

01:40:24.607 --> 01:40:27.868
It's actually one of the only Skyhorse books that I don't have on my shelf.

01:40:28.508 --> 01:40:30.808
I realized that today when I was looking.

01:40:30.828 --> 01:40:33.829
I was looking at all the red books and I realized that I didn't have this one.

01:40:34.491 --> 01:40:35.571
And I should really have it.

01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:37.712
I should have an autograph copy of it, damn it.

01:40:38.892 --> 01:40:42.274
By talking about this detailed minutiae of virology.

01:40:42.374 --> 01:40:46.555
So I actually became friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:47.135 --> 01:40:47.755
He called me up.

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.456
Now remember my timeline, right?

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:51.417
I just showed you my timeline a minute ago.

01:40:52.877 --> 01:40:57.099
My timeline over here involves meeting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:57.119 --> 01:40:58.079
because he called me

01:40:59.071 --> 01:41:04.995
In my, you know, in my yard, I just picked up the phone and then like a half an hour later, Senator Ron Johnson called me.

01:41:05.035 --> 01:41:07.776
That all happened to me in 2022.

01:41:10.558 --> 01:41:12.059
And so that's an interesting story.

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:18.883
It happened to me when I was saying that we're arguing about all this minutiae about viruses when we don't even know what's in the background.

01:41:18.943 --> 01:41:23.846
We can't possibly be using PCR to pull a specific signal out of a background of infinity.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.681
And that's when I got a phone call from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:41:27.722 --> 01:41:29.843
That's when I was being harassed by Brett Weinstein.

01:41:29.863 --> 01:41:32.824
That's when I got a phone call from Senator Ron Johnson for the first time.

01:41:33.305 --> 01:41:35.766
So we're talking about four years ago, ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:35.986 --> 01:41:39.928
This is a long, long time ago that this kind of shit was happening already.

01:41:40.048 --> 01:41:44.371
And Andrew Huff was doing this performance as well in 2022.

01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:47.072
Now it's interesting what he says in this video.

01:41:47.112 --> 01:41:47.952
Think about it again.

01:41:47.972 --> 01:41:48.933
So you have to ask yourself,

01:41:49.153 --> 01:41:51.615
you know, when the hell is this insanity going to stop?

01:41:51.655 --> 01:41:53.055
I mean, we have to do something about it.

01:41:53.196 --> 01:41:54.116
That's why I wrote the book.

01:41:54.736 --> 01:41:59.719
And, you know, I realized the PSYOP that's been going on against the American people is this.

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:10.366
They try to confuse this whole discussion about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID by talking about this detailed minutia of virology.

01:42:10.466 --> 01:42:14.648
So, I actually became friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:17.390
He called me up and it was a really interesting conversation.

01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:18.351
He said, you know,

01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.215
I heard that you're from Ecolith Alliance, you worked in all these places.

01:42:22.235 --> 01:42:24.958
I hear that you're getting harassed by the CIA.

01:42:25.399 --> 01:42:28.622
My family and I have really interesting history with the CIA.

01:42:29.263 --> 01:42:30.565
And it blew my mind.

01:42:30.645 --> 01:42:32.907
And so he sent me an autographed copy of his book, told me to read it.

01:42:34.833 --> 01:42:41.656
you know, he covers everything so well there, I realized they've been bogging everyone down with the detailed technical minutiae of virology.

01:42:42.056 --> 01:42:42.976
So nobody can understand it.

01:42:42.996 --> 01:42:46.558
I mean, people at my level can barely understand a lot of the technical detail.

01:42:46.578 --> 01:42:49.439
It actually takes me some time to read through these virology papers.

01:42:50.439 --> 01:42:56.762
So what I do in this book is I break it down in layman terms so that a high school student can understand.

01:42:57.062 --> 01:42:59.203
Why are they putting this footage

01:43:00.356 --> 01:43:16.883
Why is Alex Jones putting this footage, the footage of John F. Kennedy getting shot in the background of the whistleblower on the COVID pandemic and the gain-of-function virus that EcoHealth Alliance helped USAID and the Wuhan lab make?

01:43:16.903 --> 01:43:22.646
I don't understand.

01:43:23.506 --> 01:43:24.507
What has happened here?

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.263
And I firmly believe if we can make every American understand, and you know, I'm an educator.

01:43:29.283 --> 01:43:30.504
I love teaching.

01:43:30.584 --> 01:43:31.745
I want everyone to be able to.

01:43:31.785 --> 01:43:33.046
He's an educator.

01:43:33.146 --> 01:43:34.967
He loves teaching.

01:43:35.668 --> 01:43:36.368
Stop lying.

01:43:37.369 --> 01:43:38.710
Stop lying.

01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:39.951
That's amazing.

01:43:40.091 --> 01:43:40.471
Wow.

01:43:40.651 --> 01:43:42.913
Understand that we can prevent this from ever happening again.

01:43:42.933 --> 01:43:44.334
And that's really my goal here.

01:43:46.983 --> 01:43:47.885
It's just incredible.

01:43:48.025 --> 01:43:49.668
And you've got so much courage.

01:43:50.690 --> 01:43:53.836
But what I get from this at first, you were just trying to be helpful.

01:43:54.597 --> 01:43:59.025
And then they came after you and describe some of that harassment for folks that don't know what this is like.

01:44:00.356 --> 01:44:01.437
Yeah, it was really strange.

01:44:01.497 --> 01:44:07.102
I mean, so the first thing that happens is that military-grade quadcopter drones are hovering around my house.

01:44:07.462 --> 01:44:21.074
Military-grade quadcopter drones were hovering over his house, very similar to what is happening in the Ukraine, where the Ukraine is using hundreds of drones to effectively counter all Russian attacks.

01:44:21.594 --> 01:44:26.278
And these FPV drones are being supplied by Chinese company DJI.

01:44:27.119 --> 01:44:28.040
and other companies.

01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:34.064
And the drone company DJI is not going to be allowed in America starting in December of this year.

01:44:34.464 --> 01:44:49.394
And it just so happens that Donald Trump Jr., his son, has decided to go into the drone business and has a company that's ready and willing to provide the drones that DJI and its subsidiaries are no longer allowed to supply because the U.S.

01:44:49.414 --> 01:44:52.036
government isn't going to make that allow them to be legal anymore.

01:44:52.096 --> 01:44:53.977
Now, that's an independent discussion.

01:44:54.257 --> 01:44:57.019
DJI and its software could be proprietary.

01:44:57.499 --> 01:45:18.676
And also spy software it's possible, but the bottom line is is that there's plenty of DJI equipment in America right now and It's being used right now for a wide variety of commercial applications fulfilling a wide variety of government contracts and all those drones and all that equipment will no longer be legally useful

01:45:20.117 --> 01:45:36.364
to a lot of these contractors and I know that firsthand because there are people that do that kind of stuff in Pittsburgh and I have friends who do it because my son and I have started flying FPV drones and so when we go to the park and fly people come over and talk to us and we've met a few people that do the kind of

01:45:36.864 --> 01:45:44.612
construction land mapping that you do with a drone and it's kind of boring because the drone is flying itself on a GPS-coordinated program path.

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:51.138
And so, you know, we joke around a lot with these guys that we have met because, you know, we fly and they don't fly.

01:45:51.778 --> 01:46:00.266
And yet here he is in 2022 seeding a narrative about his Upper Peninsula, Upper Michigan house being

01:46:01.107 --> 01:46:18.861
first surveyed by military military grade i'm not sure how he's able to judge that from his experience of what a military grade drone looks like flying over his house i'm not sure how far away the operator would be it doesn't seem like he really cares but the story gets much better

01:46:20.334 --> 01:46:21.596
And I get really freaked out about this.

01:46:21.616 --> 01:46:25.902
I mean, I live in a remote area, and my driveway is a mile long.

01:46:25.922 --> 01:46:27.323
I live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

01:46:27.363 --> 01:46:29.126
It's one of the most remote areas of Lower 48.

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:37.076
Everyone speculates that I moved here to run from the deep state, and the reality is I'm still connected to a lot of people in the deep state.

01:46:37.356 --> 01:46:50.989
That's so weird because he told the story on that podcast with Robert Malone and he tells it with others that he actually bought the house in Upper Peninsula because of the COVID.

01:46:53.007 --> 01:47:01.155
He says that, that he bought the house up there because of COVID, he moved up there because of COVID, he bought MREs, and he says all that shit.

01:47:01.255 --> 01:47:06.860
So, it's a very bizarre lack of consistency in his narrative.

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:11.304
Again, because you gotta adjust the script until you really get a role.

01:47:11.325 --> 01:47:16.590
I worked with these people for years, some of them are great scientists, not all the bureaucrats are bad, some are terrible, obviously.

01:47:18.311 --> 01:47:27.397
So that's what's happening, and I go to law enforcement, we call up the local sheriff's department, state police, and they verify seeing all these weird drones out here.

01:47:27.677 --> 01:47:33.662
People out hunting, and my neighbors see all these drones, and it just continues to escalate.

01:47:33.722 --> 01:47:46.711
He has a property that has a mile-long driveway, and he's about to tell you that at a certain moment he's willing to shoot at other people, but he never shot at the drones.

01:47:48.413 --> 01:47:58.918
If I had a mile long driveway on my hundreds of acres property and I saw a drone over my house and I had guns, why wouldn't you shoot it?

01:48:00.099 --> 01:48:04.161
What would stop you from shooting that drone with a deer rifle?

01:48:05.017 --> 01:48:07.538
and filling it full of 30-odd-six.

01:48:07.558 --> 01:48:11.641
Why is that missing from this story?

01:48:11.781 --> 01:48:27.489
And yet in the next five minutes, he's gonna tell us about shooting at an unknown number of people on his property and being unafraid to pull the trigger, according to what he told Del Bigtree on the High Wire interview, 150 rounds.

01:48:30.896 --> 01:48:36.682
I've never shot 150 rounds in a single trip to the gun range.

01:48:37.102 --> 01:48:39.945
Never in my life have I shot 150 rounds.

01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:41.827
I can't afford to shoot that many bullets.

01:48:41.887 --> 01:48:42.848
It's like crazy.

01:48:43.088 --> 01:48:47.793
When I start getting followed by teams of people everywhere I go, complex tailing operations, five to 10 vehicles.

01:48:48.774 --> 01:48:51.797
A shotgun would be great for a drone, by the way.

01:48:52.367 --> 01:48:55.029
You know, there's a crazy moment that happens and it's in the book.

01:48:55.049 --> 01:48:57.551
I think it's around December 12th is a specific date.

01:48:57.911 --> 01:48:58.231
The U.S.

01:48:58.271 --> 01:49:01.374
government hovers a Coast Guard helicopter over my house.

01:49:02.474 --> 01:49:11.401
I snap a picture of it and I started laughing because at first I thought maybe I'm like, this is, you know, contractors, you know, hired by the Chinese or what happens in these situations is that the U.S.

01:49:11.441 --> 01:49:15.544
government will sometimes work with foreign intelligence agencies to conduct illegal domestic operations.

01:49:15.604 --> 01:49:16.785
This is well documented.

01:49:17.845 --> 01:49:18.826
But no, it's actually the U.S.

01:49:19.166 --> 01:49:20.066
government doing these things.

01:49:20.127 --> 01:49:22.548
And, you know, I started experiencing hacks on my devices.

01:49:22.768 --> 01:49:27.671
My wife, every... A Coast Guard helicopter?

01:49:27.711 --> 01:49:29.452
Like, what?

01:49:31.153 --> 01:49:33.275
We started experiencing these hacks probably at a rate of every two weeks.

01:49:33.735 --> 01:49:39.579
So I'm spending a fair amount of time just trying to keep a computer, you know, a network operational, devices operational.

01:49:39.879 --> 01:49:44.102
They try to delete and wipe all my Equal Health Alliance records, which I just posted on Twitter.

01:49:44.122 --> 01:49:45.823
How did they try to delete them?

01:49:47.679 --> 01:49:49.961
It's such a wild claim to make.

01:49:50.962 --> 01:49:54.044
It's such a ridiculously wild claim to make.

01:49:54.385 --> 01:49:56.786
I saved it for this big moment so I could release those today.

01:49:57.627 --> 01:49:58.488
So you should go check.

01:49:58.548 --> 01:50:02.751
He saved it for this big moment so that he could release them today.

01:50:02.811 --> 01:50:05.514
Why aren't those documents in a few other places then?

01:50:05.954 --> 01:50:12.339
You know, a trusted friend's house on a hard drive or a bank deposit box on a hard drive.

01:50:12.359 --> 01:50:13.560
What is he talking about?

01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:15.362
It's so dumb.

01:50:17.481 --> 01:50:19.444
those out and download those if they want to see the original.

01:50:19.484 --> 01:50:23.429
The ties to the Rockefeller Foundation, the Google Foundation, Welcome Trust.

01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:25.832
I mean, it's just some really damning stuff.

01:50:25.872 --> 01:50:27.574
Metabiota, which has ties to Hunter Biden.

01:50:28.575 --> 01:50:31.318
And please, everybody on the radio, tell people your Twitter address.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:32.720
AGHUFF.

01:50:36.332 --> 01:50:51.596
And so here we are promoting the new social media as the town square, the place where the truth is getting out the same way that the former research and development director of the human genome project, Kevin McKernan did on every podcast that he was ever on in 2020 beyond.

01:50:52.837 --> 01:50:55.297
Always saying that the truth is getting out on Twitter.

01:50:55.377 --> 01:50:58.658
Follow me on X, follow me on Twitter from 2020 onward.

01:51:03.243 --> 01:51:15.048
So of course the buyout of Twitter and the renaming of it as X as part of Elon Musk's rise to freedom fighter, that's all staged, scripted bullshit too?

01:51:15.108 --> 01:51:15.969
Of course it is.

01:51:15.989 --> 01:51:18.410
It is.

01:51:18.650 --> 01:51:20.011
And let's scroll through that to show viewers.

01:51:20.051 --> 01:51:20.751
This is incredible.

01:51:20.991 --> 01:51:28.895
Do you understand that the reason why Twitter originally started with 140 characters was because they were training chatbots with it?

01:51:30.051 --> 01:51:43.550
And so if you're training a chatbot and it's still in the infinite stages of development, then you can't start with more than 140 characters and you've got to challenge your trainers.

01:51:45.185 --> 01:51:48.509
to succinctly summarize their thoughts with 140 characters.

01:51:48.549 --> 01:51:49.370
And what does that do?

01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:55.677
That teaches the chatbot how to use a minimum amount of words to convey a maximum amount of information.

01:51:56.118 --> 01:51:58.340
And then you can get flowery with it.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.682
Then you can add grammar.

01:51:59.722 --> 01:52:00.503
Then you can add

01:52:01.003 --> 01:52:24.315
sophistication and nuance and so when the chatbot had been trained sufficiently they started rolling them out and asked people to approve of them and at the same time they expanded the number of characters that could be used by super users on X because now we're ready for the chatbot to be trained with more more in-depth language do you see it's all we've participated

01:52:25.177 --> 01:52:34.986
skilled social media use in the last 10 years has largely provided the training data necessary for the chatbots that we're now being bamboozled by.

01:52:35.447 --> 01:52:36.508
Don't you see it?

01:52:37.909 --> 01:52:38.509
Please continue.

01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:42.993
So, you know, it continues to escalate.

01:52:43.034 --> 01:52:48.999
So I finally realized that my only way out of this, because I actually really feared for my life, I didn't know whether or not they were going to try to put a hit on me.

01:52:51.190 --> 01:52:52.852
It's just hard to know, because you can't figure it out.

01:52:52.872 --> 01:52:54.995
So I'm contacted or approached by a number of people.

01:52:55.035 --> 01:52:57.458
Some are probably intelligence assets.

01:52:57.678 --> 01:52:58.819
Actually, some of them I identify.

01:52:58.839 --> 01:53:04.626
So I can trace some of this back to the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

01:53:04.646 --> 01:53:09.973
I mean, I was a little bit soup of agencies they went to, and they actually partnered up with the Michigan State Police.

01:53:11.314 --> 01:53:14.236
Fast forwarding through this story, that harassment just continued to escalate.

01:53:14.516 --> 01:53:18.840
They actually backdoored my security system on my house and I figured out how they did it.

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:19.661
It was a closed system.

01:53:19.701 --> 01:53:21.542
I put it in after all this harassment started happening.

01:53:21.562 --> 01:53:22.923
They dumped, they did some real petty stuff.

01:53:22.943 --> 01:53:24.324
They dumped acid in my wood boiler.

01:53:24.344 --> 01:53:26.506
I had a new high efficiency wood boiler.

01:53:26.586 --> 01:53:30.950
So they broke into his house and dumped acid into his wood boiler.

01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:32.311
Now remember what this means.

01:53:32.371 --> 01:53:37.155
That means that somebody came onto a property whose borders are one mile from the house.

01:53:40.233 --> 01:53:43.836
And then they poured acid in his wood burner and then they ran away, I guess.

01:53:46.339 --> 01:53:54.666
I mean, these are some very remarkable claims that he's been allowed to get away with and is now being promoted as a real guy by Tucker Carlson.

01:53:55.087 --> 01:54:03.034
And if we just come to our senses and realize that these people are scripted actors all the way up to Robert F. Kennedy jr, even if he's just an idiot,

01:54:04.844 --> 01:54:08.927
We can save America, or at least save Americans from this.

01:54:09.368 --> 01:54:11.009
Boiler installed, they dumped acid in the tank.

01:54:11.129 --> 01:54:11.509
Stay there.

01:54:11.549 --> 01:54:12.270
This is incredible.

01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:17.915
And then let's come back and talk about what it is you discovered and how you've reverse engineered what really happened.

01:54:17.935 --> 01:54:18.775
This is incredible.

01:54:18.995 --> 01:54:20.336
We got to get you back again, too.

01:54:20.417 --> 01:54:20.697
Wow.

01:54:20.877 --> 01:54:22.138
Because we need to really promote this.

01:54:22.158 --> 01:54:22.618
This is huge.

01:54:22.839 --> 01:54:23.359
We'll be right back.

01:54:23.819 --> 01:54:25.120
See, we're finishing up with the harassment.

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:33.147
Then let's get into what they don't want us to know, how you reverse engineered this, working in these labs, what you know they really did, and where this is all going, Doctor.

01:54:34.554 --> 01:54:34.674
Wow.

01:54:48.002 --> 01:54:58.166
There are a number of peer-reviewed publications that came out recently that look at this from a Bayesian or statistical approach, which say, what's the probability of this occurring in nature?

01:54:58.787 --> 01:55:06.810
And there is no chance, it's highly improbable, it's one in the billions that this could emerge from nature.

01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:14.392
Now, if you go back, then you look at some of the other publications that came out over the past year, really, since they started clamping down on me.

01:55:14.432 --> 01:55:29.697
So the funny part here is, if they would have let me come forward a year ago, this story wouldn't have been as big, because other scientists who did some great work proved that certain aspects of the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been patented

01:55:30.385 --> 01:55:35.174
by the likes of Moderna, NIH, and Dr. Ralph Baric.

01:55:35.274 --> 01:55:42.528
So that's a paper that came out of the University of Pittsburgh by a guy who works on breast cancer.

01:55:44.204 --> 01:55:51.935
So he's got a breast cancer lab at the University of Pittsburgh and he wrote a paper about this reversed Moderna sequence.

01:55:52.095 --> 01:56:00.207
It was a paper that not very many people followed, but this guy actually met me for coffee in person in Pittsburgh a few years ago and tried to convince me that he went to

01:56:01.449 --> 01:56:07.815
medical school with Jeremy Marks, which is something weird that also Robert Malone has said in an interview.

01:56:07.975 --> 01:56:22.150
Anyway, this guy from the University of Pittsburgh had four authors on the paper and claimed that there was, you know, a statistically zero level of chance that this thing would just be in there and that it's reversed because, you know, they used it in cell culture, yada yada yada, and here's him

01:56:23.371 --> 01:56:39.237
Citing that paper now and that paper is is extreme bullshit again because remember it's all Resting on the presumption that the sequence that was reported in Wuhan is a sequence that has no errors in it It is a hundred percent

01:56:41.007 --> 01:56:58.873
high fidelity sequence of a coronavirus found and there's no wobbles, there's no errors, there's no gray areas, this is the sequence and then now we're supposed to accept the sequence and its HIV inserts and its super antigen sequences and its amyloid

01:57:01.096 --> 01:57:11.345
amyloid and amyloidosis generating sequences and it's clotting whatever else it does like this all of this is

01:57:13.246 --> 01:57:26.201
resting on the presumption that the sequence that they found is real, accurate, and defines both the natural signal and the signal that they transfected in you.

01:57:26.661 --> 01:57:31.927
And because the thing that they transfected in you has all of these extra attributes,

01:57:32.648 --> 01:57:33.749
They hurt you.

01:57:33.909 --> 01:57:35.090
They poisoned us.

01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:36.451
They caused cancer.

01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:46.538
And it's because of this nasty protein that was actually designed by EcoHealth because they're trying to make nasty gain-of-function viruses.

01:57:46.598 --> 01:57:48.700
That's the closure of this.

01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.504
That's the summary of all of these red books put out by Skyhorse Publishing.

01:57:54.564 --> 01:58:01.870
If you believe all of these whistleblowers, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including Brian Hooker, including Robert Malone, and including

01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:04.551
Andrew Huff, then that's what you believe.

01:58:04.971 --> 01:58:09.473
And so if you can't pull your head out now, your kids will be enslaved.

01:58:11.795 --> 01:58:13.215
So think about this.

01:58:13.275 --> 01:58:19.758
They go out and they surveil and they look at, scientists look at the disease that's circulating the planet, okay, after it emerges.

01:58:20.299 --> 01:58:22.980
And then they look at the genetics of it using something called BLAST.

01:58:23.652 --> 01:58:31.537
And then they find perfect matches to specific sequences that have also been patented back in 2015, 2014.

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:34.199
And that tells you everything right there.

01:58:34.419 --> 01:58:50.990
It shows that the agent, SARS-CoV-2- Don't forget that David Martin has been touring the world for the last five years, sometimes on the same stage as Robert Malone and Merrill Nass, talking about the patents that these people have and the reason why the patents show that this was always

01:58:51.690 --> 01:58:52.591
their creation.

01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:53.331
Remember that.

01:58:53.451 --> 01:58:58.415
Please don't forget that Melissa Chen is also an expert on BLAST.

01:58:58.455 --> 01:59:04.919
Don't forget that Dan Saratkin's dad was one of the inventors of some of the algorithms on BLAST.

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:11.804
So don't forget that all of these players are directly connected to the bullshit that they pretend to be talking about.

01:59:13.815 --> 01:59:18.237
and the medical countermeasure, the vaccine, were co-developed together.

01:59:18.258 --> 01:59:21.439
And that's typically what happens in bioweapons programs.

01:59:21.479 --> 01:59:22.320
I get that question a lot.

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:25.101
So they're like, you know, people ask me, is this a bioweapon?

01:59:25.141 --> 01:59:26.862
Well, not in the traditional sense.

01:59:26.902 --> 01:59:33.266
So when you want to use a bioweapon, if you're a state-sponsored actor or military, you want to use it to knock out, debilitate your enemy.

01:59:34.126 --> 01:59:35.647
an incapacitating agent.

01:59:35.687 --> 01:59:50.377
You know, the thing that Charles Rixey and the superclown Kevin McCarren in Tokyo in the UK was talking about since 2020 when they first tried to fool me with the other George Webb associates, Paul Cattrell and Addy Adds.

01:59:50.617 --> 01:59:59.323
This is a long history of bullshit and a long history of a bullshit team of actors on a bullshit script that I think was written by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:59:59.804 --> 02:00:01.885
And those guys have probably been behind

02:00:02.385 --> 02:00:06.106
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., CHD, and ICANN since their inception.

02:00:07.726 --> 02:00:17.609
And, you know, if this is a bioweapon, it's not a very good one, but it could be used for a new type of asymmetrical warfare, where it could be used to stoke fear, like in terrorism, or economically.

02:00:18.429 --> 02:00:22.590
I don't believe that... It could be used as the pretext for lockdowns and the Great Reset.

02:00:23.695 --> 02:00:39.539
exactly and and why that's so interesting is that you know people come to me like oh this is all a big part of the master plan well um maybe some people have had this as part of their master plan but i don't think all the players were on board and that's why they have this event 201 um you know one thing i talk about in the book is

02:00:39.759 --> 02:00:44.063
Event 201 actually happened a year before event 201.

02:00:44.103 --> 02:00:59.816
You can go to the real event, realevent201.com and you can find out all about how the real event 201 had people like, I don't know, Lee Min Yan across from the lady that's supposedly credited with inventing the mRNA.

02:00:59.856 --> 02:01:03.019
They presented in the same fricking, the same fricking panel.

02:01:04.031 --> 02:01:07.936
is that the epidemiology of this disease is clear.

02:01:08.016 --> 02:01:12.181
This, this infectious disease emerged in late August or early.

02:01:12.441 --> 02:01:14.103
Here he is casting the spell.

02:01:14.203 --> 02:01:16.125
This disease is real.

02:01:16.265 --> 02:01:18.288
This disease emerged.

02:01:18.308 --> 02:01:19.709
This disease is real.

02:01:22.811 --> 02:01:24.032
September of 2019.

02:01:24.632 --> 02:01:29.395
That was months before the US government told everyone what was going on here.

02:01:30.135 --> 02:01:31.556
And I didn't do that work.

02:01:31.616 --> 02:01:32.637
Other scientists did that work.

02:01:32.677 --> 02:01:33.297
But I went and looked at it.

02:01:33.317 --> 02:01:33.857
It's excellent.

02:01:34.078 --> 02:01:35.238
And it was replicated.

02:01:35.458 --> 02:01:41.162
And other people independently did different studies, which were correlated or validated the other people's work.

02:01:41.202 --> 02:01:45.965
So this is all rock solid scientists that had been done by science by the global community.

02:01:46.025 --> 02:01:48.366
So a lot of scientists, we weren't all bad.

02:01:48.386 --> 02:01:49.527
Some of us really did the right thing.

02:01:49.767 --> 02:01:51.188
So give us the bottom line, then.

02:01:52.128 --> 02:01:57.592
I mean, obviously it was made of a composite, a chimeric virus of a bunch of already patented strains.

02:01:58.153 --> 02:01:59.274
They've been lying about it.

02:01:59.354 --> 02:02:00.394
Senator Paul's on it.

02:02:00.455 --> 02:02:01.495
He's got your information.

02:02:01.515 --> 02:02:03.117
What do we need to know?

02:02:03.337 --> 02:02:05.338
Senator Paul has your phone number.

02:02:05.358 --> 02:02:08.881
Do you know how many times I've been told that the guy's got your phone number?

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.442
Don't worry, he's going to call you.

02:02:10.983 --> 02:02:14.005
I mean, that's funny.

02:02:14.986 --> 02:02:16.367
How about this and where this is going?

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.721
Well, I don't know where it's going.

02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:24.563
Hopefully, you know, I'm sending, you know, hopefully what happens is we're sending Dr. Anthony Fauci to prison.

02:02:24.583 --> 02:02:26.244
Hopefully we send Dr. Ralph Baric to prison.

02:02:26.764 --> 02:02:30.166
I hope we send Dr. Dasik to prison because that's where they all deserve to be.

02:02:30.226 --> 02:02:35.168
I mean, this is the biggest, biggest scam trap.

02:02:35.248 --> 02:02:44.052
So he agrees that the Scooby-Doo mystery is solved and the Scooby-Doo villains behind the the costumes are those three guys.

02:02:44.132 --> 02:02:45.073
I mean, it's stop.

02:02:45.793 --> 02:02:46.834
It's just terrible.

02:02:47.034 --> 02:02:47.794
I mean, it's terrible.

02:02:47.814 --> 02:02:50.516
Travesty that's ever happened to humanity.

02:02:51.036 --> 02:02:54.358
And I can understand why the Chinese government, the Communist Party, the U.S.

02:02:54.398 --> 02:02:54.978
government tried to.

02:02:55.318 --> 02:03:02.482
And I can understand why the biggest scam, travesty that's ever happened to humanity.

02:03:02.803 --> 02:03:08.486
The biggest scam or travesty that's ever happened to humanity.

02:03:09.366 --> 02:03:33.206
And what you have to decide now is whether the actions and words of 2022 up until now, in 2025 on Tucker Carlson, Andrew Huff is behaving as though he is aware that the biggest scam or travesty in the history of mankind has recently occurred.

02:03:33.286 --> 02:03:34.447
Is he behaving like that?

02:03:36.994 --> 02:03:38.215
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:03:38.275 --> 02:03:45.821
was shown on film saying that the vaccine schedule in America is equivalent to Nazi death camps.

02:03:46.221 --> 02:03:52.846
Has his behavior since saying that suggest that that's actually what he believes?

02:03:53.847 --> 02:04:04.716
Very similarly, you could ask the question, if Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism in 2013 because his son was vaccine damaged, neurologically damaged or poisoned,

02:04:05.558 --> 02:04:08.841
by intramuscular injection, why doesn't he say that now?

02:04:09.101 --> 02:04:12.704
Why does he say that autism was caused by vaccines now?

02:04:13.085 --> 02:04:20.451
Why does he say that we can't get rid of bird flu in raw milk because pasteurization doesn't kill viruses?

02:04:21.913 --> 02:04:30.801
It's because they are all on the same national security script where RNA can pandemic, where transfection worked great,

02:04:32.577 --> 02:04:36.059
and where gain-of-function viruses are real and we need to worry about it.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.362
These are all myths that they want us to pass on to our kids.

02:04:43.985 --> 02:04:47.309
And I can understand why the Chinese government, the Communist Party, and the U.S.

02:04:47.349 --> 02:04:49.351
government tried to cover this up, because it's terrible.

02:04:49.851 --> 02:04:58.961
But if you want to have these key people making stupid decisions, one after another, just to fuel their own greed, we wouldn't have millions of deaths around the planet.

02:04:59.001 --> 02:05:00.503
We want to have these lockdowns.

02:05:01.123 --> 02:05:03.346
And the fact that our governments then go along with

02:05:04.006 --> 02:05:21.268
But we would have had these millions of deaths because the population pyramids around the Western world predicted that we were going to have about a decade-long increase in all-cause mortality because our population was becoming old and there wasn't the appropriate

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:34.655
the way that the population pyramid was, we were just going to have an increase in all-cause mortality, an increase of burden of the very old, of the elderly, who no longer are contributing income tax, but instead are drawing down from the system.

02:05:35.056 --> 02:05:37.278
We have seen this coming for a couple decades.

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:47.631
And so the increase in all-cause mortality was not because of a virus, was not because of the response to a virus or a botched response to a virus.

02:05:48.091 --> 02:05:54.979
It was caused by a predictable rise in all-cause mortality because the population pyramid was shaped that way.

02:05:56.658 --> 02:06:02.203
These globalist type people like the World Economic Foundation, Klaus Schwab, these maniacs.

02:06:02.243 --> 02:06:04.104
The World Economic Foundation?

02:06:04.165 --> 02:06:12.712
He doesn't even know the acronyms and what they mean because he hasn't memorized the script well enough because he's not that good of an actor.

02:06:15.262 --> 02:06:16.383
I mean, it's just insane.

02:06:17.164 --> 02:06:24.592
The whole premise of our freedoms being restricted and taken away to prevent this disease from spreading was ridiculous.

02:06:24.612 --> 02:06:28.476
And this is why I signed the Great Barrington Declaration early on.

02:06:28.636 --> 02:06:32.360
I actually helped work on some of the national pandemic preparedness plans for different agencies.

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.442
And they talked about lockdowns.

02:06:34.642 --> 02:06:35.163
He worked

02:06:36.448 --> 02:06:40.531
on pandemic preparedness plans for different agencies.

02:06:41.151 --> 02:06:44.573
That's why he signed the great Barrington declaration.

02:06:44.653 --> 02:06:48.936
So here he is on Alex Jones promoting the Jay Bhattacharya show.

02:06:51.118 --> 02:06:57.322
Also a very scripted actor, also scripted to come in contact with me three times in three years.

02:06:57.842 --> 02:07:05.067
And then the last time that he was scripted to come in contact with me, really tried to persuade me to stop saying Robert Malone was a traitor.

02:07:06.308 --> 02:07:10.051
because Robert Malone was part of the team that was gonna make him NIH director.

02:07:10.592 --> 02:07:21.761
Now he's NIH director, and I'm still saying that Robert Malone is a traitor, he is a fraud, and he's part of the script behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and there isn't a journalist on Earth who gives a shit.

02:07:22.462 --> 02:07:33.551
Even though I can go on for hours, and Mark can go on for hours, and never stop connecting all the dots, because every single dot lines up over time and space.

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.184
over ideas and their lack of progress.

02:07:40.888 --> 02:07:51.341
And just like every other actor on stage, this guy's understanding, this guy's ability to message about it, this guy's elevator pitch doesn't change over the course of many years.

02:07:53.015 --> 02:07:55.398
We actually modeled and simulate these to see when you use them.

02:07:55.419 --> 02:07:56.740
And actually, it does make sense.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:00.065
When they first came out and said, we need to lock down for two weeks, that was actually part of the plan.

02:08:00.586 --> 02:08:07.957
But when they said, we need to lock down for another 30 days, we need to lock down for another 60 days, we need to keep extending these emergency relief acts, it's all nonsense.

02:08:08.577 --> 02:08:20.130
And really what they've done is they've created a whole biomedical military-industrial complex around this gain-of-function work, which is nonsense, and the medical countermeasure of a vaccine that doesn't work.

02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:27.377
And to show you how, like, you know, to explain this to your audience how I've come along and how I evolved, when this first came out, I was pro-mRNA jabs.

02:08:27.417 --> 02:08:28.719
I said, everyone should go and get this.

02:08:28.779 --> 02:08:29.860
You know, I trust the government.

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.401
And then I started to see the histopathology da-da.

02:08:32.621 --> 02:08:35.122
He was pro-mRNA jabs.

02:08:35.222 --> 02:08:47.165
So again, he does not have the requisite expertise to understand that this is just an old technology called transfection that has been renamed as a vaccine in order to bamboozle people.

02:08:47.985 --> 02:08:50.726
Force them to use a word that will trap them.

02:08:51.587 --> 02:08:54.047
Because vaccine is a word that means nothing.

02:08:54.327 --> 02:08:56.208
It is a trap, just like autism.

02:08:57.588 --> 02:08:58.768
Just like transgender.

02:08:59.089 --> 02:09:00.109
These are all traps.

02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:03.010
You can't argue your way out when you're using their words.

02:09:06.211 --> 02:09:12.673
Alex Jones is an elaborate hoax on Americans all and the world.

02:09:13.034 --> 02:09:16.175
Just like David Ickes is an elaborate hoax on the world.

02:09:16.715 --> 02:09:19.876
Just like Joe Rogan and the intellectual dark web.

02:09:20.196 --> 02:09:22.117
Just like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk

02:09:22.737 --> 02:09:24.557
are elaborate jokes on the world.

02:09:24.618 --> 02:09:43.022
They are constructs that have been created by the national security state in order for you to go limp and believe that there's no way you could possibly be as successful as the gay space vampire, Peter Thiel, or as successful as the son of all that is evil, Elon Musk, I guess.

02:09:43.062 --> 02:09:44.943
I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.

02:09:45.003 --> 02:09:46.383
These people are no one.

02:09:46.483 --> 02:09:49.364
These people are so incredibly average.

02:09:50.387 --> 02:09:55.255
And it is only the skillful use of social media that makes them appear otherwise.

02:09:56.241 --> 02:09:57.602
the pathology reports coming out.

02:09:58.142 --> 02:10:02.765
And then that added with the fact that I read the clinical trial reports of the tests that they conducted.

02:10:02.785 --> 02:10:06.967
And it was clear that the jabs were not preventing transmission.

02:10:07.208 --> 02:10:11.070
In fact, they were causing the new variants to emerge.

02:10:11.110 --> 02:10:12.931
The more you jab people, the more variants you get.

02:10:13.851 --> 02:10:21.416
So he says the exact same thing that that Herod van den Bosch, former colleague of Robert Malone at Solvay,

02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:23.380
Right?

02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:31.242
That guy's been saying that since the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 when I was publishing my review.

02:10:32.842 --> 02:10:50.807
When I was given the Merrick disease, the Merrick's disease paper by Luigi Warren, the former postdoc of the co-founder of Moderna, a member of drastic and a guy who was featured in a USA Today centerfold foldout.

02:10:53.615 --> 02:10:58.719
Drastic was a joke that was played on all of us and on me.

02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:06.546
The entire George Webb Network was a joke played on all of us, including Mark Kulak and myself.

02:11:08.067 --> 02:11:15.913
Robert Malone is a joke that has been played on all of us and probably was never meant to be as public as he is now because they thought that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:11:15.933 --> 02:11:19.056
and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass could keep it under wraps, but they couldn't.

02:11:19.636 --> 02:11:21.438
They couldn't keep it under control at all.

02:11:22.901 --> 02:11:44.524
And Mary Holland's lust for power was best exhibited because she ditched her organization, CHD, in a heartbeat in order to be the general campaign manager of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., just until it was obvious that he was never going to get office and that, more importantly, they hired me at CHD and needed to fire me, so she came back to do it.

02:11:46.147 --> 02:12:01.475
All she did since she came back to CHD after I was hired was drive Laura Bono out and threaten me with firing, threaten me with firing, build the HR reports to justify the firing, and then she fired me.

02:12:01.976 --> 02:12:02.976
And why did she fire me?

02:12:03.356 --> 02:12:13.702
For the same reason that Jay Bhattacharya doesn't talk to me anymore, because I say that Robert Malone is a scripted national security actor, a traitor to my children and yours.

02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:18.624
Then you get to the point where you realize, OK, well, this is having no impact.

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:19.504
It looks like it has.

02:12:20.045 --> 02:12:22.187
It's having no impact on the burden of disease.

02:12:22.407 --> 02:12:24.609
And, you know, it might actually be hurting people.

02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:25.810
There's no informed consent.

02:12:26.811 --> 02:12:27.591
So here we are.

02:12:27.611 --> 02:12:31.635
The government or our government is still recommending this this poison to people.

02:12:31.915 --> 02:12:33.196
It doesn't make sense to me.

02:12:33.696 --> 02:12:35.598
And the problem, it's a slippery slope.

02:12:35.718 --> 02:12:37.419
You know, you go as a scientist like me.

02:12:37.499 --> 02:12:38.680
I work for the government for a number of years.

02:12:39.001 --> 02:12:39.921
Everything's on deep state.

02:12:39.962 --> 02:12:40.242
Fine.

02:12:40.542 --> 02:12:41.142
I'm deep state.

02:12:41.423 --> 02:12:42.744
But they violated my trust, too.

02:12:43.670 --> 02:12:47.455
And through that process, I now question everything that they tell me.

02:12:47.535 --> 02:12:49.017
What can you believe from these people?

02:12:49.578 --> 02:13:00.832
A simple fact that I like to point out to the naysayers on Twitter about this is that the vast majority of scientific research in medicine and psychology cannot be replicated.

02:13:00.852 --> 02:13:02.254
They call it the replication crisis.

02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:03.831
And there's a reason for that.

02:13:03.871 --> 02:13:05.731
If it can't be replicated, it's not valid.

02:13:05.751 --> 02:13:06.632
But they don't want you to know that.

02:13:06.692 --> 02:13:08.213
This is also not his idea.

02:13:08.273 --> 02:13:10.814
This is the same bullshit that Jay Bhattacharya says.

02:13:11.594 --> 02:13:15.016
This is the same bullshit that they say at the broken science meetings.

02:13:16.217 --> 02:13:20.339
The replication crisis, the use of p-values to prove nothing.

02:13:20.379 --> 02:13:21.780
Yeah, that's great, but now what?

02:13:25.381 --> 02:13:26.162
Now what do we do?

02:13:26.722 --> 02:13:28.203
What are the consequences of that?

02:13:29.073 --> 02:13:33.355
If, if we can't replicate virology, then virology might be a hoax.

02:13:33.415 --> 02:13:37.177
If we can't replicate HIV biology, then maybe there's a hoax there too.

02:13:37.537 --> 02:13:47.302
If we can't replicate public health, if we can't verify the vaccine schedule is needing all of the shots as early as they are, then maybe we need to pay attention, right?

02:13:47.342 --> 02:13:57.848
But instead we talk in these general terms and whine about these general ideas in theory, whatever, without ever taking them to their natural sort of brass

02:13:59.428 --> 02:14:01.889
you know, where the rubber meets the road consequences.

02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:11.474
Again, if you think this is the worst fraud and the biggest travesty to ever happen in human history, you should be acting differently by now.

02:14:11.914 --> 02:14:22.560
If you thought that the vaccine schedule was the equivalent to Nazi death camps in the, in the first world already 10 years ago, you should be acting differently by now.

02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:29.083
Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Brian Hooker, Merrill Nass, Mary Holland, all of you, but they don't.

02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:33.031
and therefore they can't believe what they say.

02:14:47.287 --> 02:14:47.988
Well, that's right.

02:14:48.048 --> 02:14:56.313
And we end the last segment with the harassment with them breaking into your new security system to finish up with the harassment.

02:14:56.333 --> 02:14:59.716
Has the harassment stopped now because it didn't work or what's happening?

02:14:59.856 --> 02:15:00.276
Well, yeah.

02:15:00.336 --> 02:15:01.677
I mean, basically, I beat these guys.

02:15:01.717 --> 02:15:05.140
I mean, the height of it is I actually got in a gunfight with these guys on my property.

02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.701
I reported to the Michigan State Police.

02:15:06.741 --> 02:15:07.261
Nobody showed up.

02:15:07.301 --> 02:15:08.442
There's witnesses to this.

02:15:08.462 --> 02:15:09.302
My neighbors, my wife.

02:15:09.603 --> 02:15:10.723
It was a prolonged engagement.

02:15:10.864 --> 02:15:11.484
That's what we call it.

02:15:11.604 --> 02:15:20.407
The witnesses, is it a mile long driveway, but the lot is only a hundred yards wide and you have a next door neighbor?

02:15:21.848 --> 02:15:28.990
Or is it a mile long driveway because you have a really big property and then neighbors can't really witness very much.

02:15:29.090 --> 02:15:29.950
Which one is it?

02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:34.372
The military was an hour long.

02:15:34.412 --> 02:15:35.312
Describe that story.

02:15:35.352 --> 02:15:36.073
Tell us about that.

02:15:36.433 --> 02:15:38.433
An hour long shootout.

02:15:38.473 --> 02:15:39.714
He says, let's hear more.

02:15:41.772 --> 02:15:42.813
Well, it was simple.

02:15:42.853 --> 02:15:51.017
So I was sitting in my house actually in the room next door and there was a man hiding in the bushes who was armed operating a small drone around my house.

02:15:51.037 --> 02:15:53.739
So who cares about the small house actually in the room next door?

02:15:54.279 --> 02:15:55.800
And there was a man hiding in the bush.

02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:58.522
I was sitting in my house actually in the room next door.

02:15:58.542 --> 02:16:03.264
I was sitting in my house actually in the room next door.

02:16:03.384 --> 02:16:05.626
What in the Sam shit does that mean?

02:16:06.866 --> 02:16:07.827
Other than I'm lying.

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:15.228
And there was a man hiding in the bushes who was armed operating a small drone around my house.

02:16:15.248 --> 02:16:16.489
So who cares about the small drone?

02:16:16.509 --> 02:16:18.591
But I have an armed guy trespassing on my property.

02:16:19.152 --> 02:16:20.874
So I did what any American would do.

02:16:20.894 --> 02:16:23.237
Out in a rural area, this is a stand your ground state.

02:16:23.257 --> 02:16:24.638
I grabbed my firearms and I went after him.

02:16:24.698 --> 02:16:25.399
I called the police first.

02:16:25.819 --> 02:16:28.543
I grabbed my firearms and I went after him.

02:16:29.063 --> 02:16:30.465
I called the police first.

02:16:32.090 --> 02:16:34.311
First, I told him there was an armed trespasser on my property.

02:16:34.732 --> 02:16:36.153
When I went after him, they shot at me.

02:16:37.173 --> 02:16:41.176
Actually, he turned at me with a firearm in his pocket, and that's when I started to shoot at him.

02:16:41.316 --> 02:16:47.500
He turned at me with a firearm in his pocket, and that's when I started to shoot at him.

02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.541
This story is so bad.

02:16:51.802 --> 02:16:53.804
And then they started to return fire back across the swamp.

02:16:53.864 --> 02:16:55.345
I own 200 acres in a remote area.

02:16:55.365 --> 02:17:00.308
200 acres in a remote area, but he has witnesses that are his neighbors.

02:17:01.326 --> 02:17:04.910
and he has a swamp and he shot across the swamp at this person.

02:17:05.090 --> 02:17:24.408
In another retelling of this story with Del Bigtree, he uses the figure 150 rounds, which is kind of hard to understand because 150 rounds is quite a lot to carry, even if you have clips or a belt.

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:39.199
Um, and he does claim in that other story that he went back to the house where his, my, where his wife and toddler were sheltering to reload and then went back out and shot some more.

02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:41.902
So let's see if he says that in this interview.

02:17:42.243 --> 02:17:43.424
Um, you know, the whole thing is.

02:17:43.584 --> 02:17:47.967
Which is a lesson everybody, you fired back at the real, you know, people say, oh, you work for the deep state.

02:17:48.207 --> 02:17:52.730
Yeah, we should be ready to have defectors back to America who were never bad and wake up and tell the truth.

02:17:53.791 --> 02:17:56.573
The key to bringing them down is going to be people like you and Edward Snowden.

02:17:56.853 --> 02:17:57.794
It's going to be insiders.

02:17:58.074 --> 02:18:00.376
So when you finally shot back at them, they went away.

02:18:00.396 --> 02:18:04.119
Andrew Huff is the same as Edward Snowden.

02:18:04.159 --> 02:18:04.999
That's amazing.

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:05.940
After that.

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:13.448
They ran away and they actually, I had them pinned down so bad, this gentleman deployed what's known as a tactical rescue beacon.

02:18:13.848 --> 02:18:16.009
I hadn't seen one of these things in the military and I laughed.

02:18:16.029 --> 02:18:19.691
I mean, I was sort of happy that it was had on top of this guy, but this guy actually deployed something.

02:18:19.731 --> 02:18:24.193
I mean, can't you see Mel Gibson and his sons in the woods in the movie Patriot?

02:18:24.913 --> 02:18:50.308
you know shooting from different places and putting rifles in different places so he can make it seem like there's lots of him but there's really only one of him and so he had like these rifles and these these probably game cameras all over the place and so he would run from one place would run from one location to another and shoot from different angles so they didn't know how many people were shooting at him and and then he had him pinned down and and then what?

02:18:51.628 --> 02:18:54.410
Into the sky that made a sonic noise it emitted

02:18:55.242 --> 02:18:59.405
I'm guessing other technology to rescue vehicles would come to his location.

02:18:59.685 --> 02:19:00.806
I mean, you can't make this stuff up.

02:19:01.046 --> 02:19:06.429
The rescue vehicles actually came down to the front of my driveway of a mile-long driveway, and they were waiting to pick this person up.

02:19:06.449 --> 02:19:10.472
When I came back, I had my wife call the sheriff's department again to find out where the heck they were.

02:19:10.492 --> 02:19:12.093
I reloaded.

02:19:12.113 --> 02:19:23.620
I went back to the point where I thought this person was escaping, and the sheriff's department actually went by my driveway with their sirens on at about 100 miles an hour, and I couldn't believe it.

02:19:24.395 --> 02:19:30.242
I mean, I was shocked and I did an interview with Majid Nawaz after this shortly happened with my wife, who's a professor at Michigan.

02:19:30.262 --> 02:19:32.985
I did an interview with Majid Nawaz.

02:19:33.045 --> 02:19:34.787
Now, that's an interesting thing to say.

02:19:34.867 --> 02:19:37.550
Just keep that in your mind right now as I wrap up the show.

02:19:38.050 --> 02:19:40.954
Ladies and gentlemen, this is pretty shocking, right?

02:19:41.014 --> 02:19:42.675
This is absolutely shocking.

02:19:43.436 --> 02:19:45.519
I got to go, but I want you to see it.

02:19:46.516 --> 02:19:49.717
These people were on stage together in Romania in November of 23.

02:19:49.958 --> 02:19:59.462
Then they were on stage together again in the United States in 2024 under the auspices of Senator Ron Johnson and Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

02:19:59.582 --> 02:20:02.323
All of these people are scripted traitors to our grandchildren.

02:20:02.403 --> 02:20:12.288
All of these people are on a national security script and taking benefits from social media and from sponsors and from who knows what else in order to perform this act.

02:20:12.788 --> 02:20:22.394
This is one of the worst ones of all, and it's really remarkable because it's a verifiably false story about the Health and Human Services book about the Wuhan cover-up.

02:20:23.294 --> 02:20:24.395
And no one cares.

02:20:24.955 --> 02:20:29.298
And he told this story on a huge podcast right before the election.

02:20:29.858 --> 02:20:38.564
This man is a traitor, but he's a scripted traitor, so we can forgive him, but we need to find out who scripted him, and we need to find out now

02:20:39.304 --> 02:20:40.785
because this was a narrative trap.

02:20:40.845 --> 02:20:44.367
That's why he was there in 2020 to tell us about PCR.

02:20:44.427 --> 02:20:48.649
And now he's here telling us that PCR works, but the shots are contaminated.

02:20:48.689 --> 02:20:56.194
It's a narrative trap where everybody involved in the trap believes in the novel virus and in gain of function, and that it could come again.

02:20:56.234 --> 02:21:04.218
And they were there from the very beginning as a health freedom movement has children's health defense and ICANN already put in place before the pandemic.

02:21:04.238 --> 02:21:05.279
So that at the beginning,

02:21:05.799 --> 02:21:13.865
There would be people there to set a mythology full of the expected outcomes of transfection that they were going to call a vaccine.

02:21:14.246 --> 02:21:16.047
And they all called it a vaccine.

02:21:16.728 --> 02:21:19.170
All said that PCR works, just not theirs.

02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:23.193
They all agreed that there was some pretty fishy stuff about the spike protein.

02:21:23.573 --> 02:21:29.057
And they all agreed that this virus could have come out of a laboratory and therefore causing all of these problems in 2020.

02:21:30.218 --> 02:21:35.021
The COVID is causing mitochondrial damage and prion disease and amyloid and long COVID.

02:21:35.461 --> 02:21:46.786
And that illusion is to hide the fact that transfection was going to do all kinds of random shit to people because transfecting healthy people was always a dumb idea.

02:21:47.807 --> 02:21:50.808
And in order to get away with it, they needed to have murder and lies.

02:21:50.888 --> 02:21:52.049
Coordinated, of course,

02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:55.030
and it's very simple to sort through it.

02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:58.091
Pure oxygen causes acute respiratory distress syndrome.

02:21:58.111 --> 02:22:05.592
PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool, not then, and it isn't now, but it's being used all over the world as if it is.

02:22:06.092 --> 02:22:07.093
That's by design.

02:22:07.573 --> 02:22:12.954
Not using antibiotics for viral pneumonia was a crime, and if they keep doing it, they can do it again.

02:22:14.614 --> 02:22:15.874
Murder and lies for what?

02:22:15.954 --> 02:22:19.055
It's very simple, because they need the data.

02:22:19.838 --> 02:22:24.083
There's only going to be this much diversity on Earth for another generation or two.

02:22:24.584 --> 02:22:31.552
So they need the infrastructure, the data, the power, the machine learning algorithm, the computing power to do it.

02:22:31.612 --> 02:22:33.374
It's for the Human Genome Project.

02:22:34.736 --> 02:22:36.859
No one else has offered you an answer.

02:22:38.041 --> 02:22:41.303
Everybody else is telling you the DoD is killing Americans.

02:22:41.363 --> 02:22:42.443
That's ridiculous.

02:22:42.523 --> 02:22:50.147
Telling you that the Jews are trying to control everybody and that the Jews have an island with little girls on it or something like that.

02:22:50.187 --> 02:22:51.207
That's ridiculous.

02:22:52.208 --> 02:22:54.009
This is about real stuff.

02:22:55.669 --> 02:23:02.532
about real ideas that originate a decade, I'm sorry, a generation or so ago, a mentor or two ago.

02:23:03.052 --> 02:23:11.516
And those ideas didn't come to fruition, but the motivations for their governance and the motivation for their behavior remains the same.

02:23:12.236 --> 02:23:21.882
They thought that the Human Genome Project was going to be over by now, that we'd have all the data, all the computers, and all the answers, and we'd be programming human genomics by now.

02:23:21.922 --> 02:23:25.044
We'd be programming the human genome right now.

02:23:25.564 --> 02:23:26.125
We're not.

02:23:27.608 --> 02:23:30.789
And that's the shortcoming that they don't want you to ever find out.

02:23:30.849 --> 02:23:38.192
They don't want you to ever know about because they're hoping that in the next 20 years, they'll be able to fill in those blanks and then it won't matter that they lied.

02:23:38.712 --> 02:23:40.552
It won't matter that they exaggerated.

02:23:40.592 --> 02:23:45.614
It won't matter that they told you lies about where this was going or what they were gonna do.

02:23:45.654 --> 02:23:50.496
It won't matter that they lied because then they will have all the power.

02:23:51.687 --> 02:23:54.529
And this Lollapalooza of liars is where we need to grow.

02:23:54.609 --> 02:23:55.590
This is how we get out.

02:23:56.430 --> 02:24:01.894
By showing everybody that from 2020, you can see them clearly.

02:24:02.014 --> 02:24:10.079
Steve Bannon, the fraud, the Weinstein brother fraud, the McKernan fraud, all behind the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:24:10.159 --> 02:24:10.479
fraud.

02:24:10.499 --> 02:24:12.100
And it goes back to their parents.

02:24:13.021 --> 02:24:17.864
Les Weinstein, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Estes Kefauver, and Thalidomide.

02:24:17.944 --> 02:24:19.285
It couldn't be easier.

02:24:20.572 --> 02:24:22.694
Nobody is in this narrative by chance.

02:24:22.974 --> 02:24:24.835
Nothing is in this narrative by chance.

02:24:25.476 --> 02:24:27.057
Everybody has a timeline.

02:24:27.397 --> 02:24:34.103
And if you start holding people to account by looking at their timeline, you're gonna find out that all these people are frauds.

02:24:34.543 --> 02:24:38.346
Brian Hooker's timeline reveals him as a scripted fraud.

02:24:39.508 --> 02:24:41.250
Nobody's in this narrative by chance.

02:24:41.631 --> 02:24:55.770
Brandy Vaughn's timeline reveals these people as a scripted fraud because all of the wonderful teaching that Brandy did, all of the good ideas that she had, all of the beautiful ways that she summarized her objections to

02:24:56.371 --> 02:25:04.119
The injection of a combination of substances to augment a healthy child was omitted from these people's rhetoric since.

02:25:04.179 --> 02:25:07.442
And she died at the beginning of the pandemic and they all forgot about her.

02:25:07.842 --> 02:25:09.344
And that's not by accident.

02:25:09.404 --> 02:25:10.545
It's not a little accident.

02:25:10.565 --> 02:25:12.006
It's not a little happy accident.

02:25:12.427 --> 02:25:13.488
It is by design.

02:25:14.529 --> 02:25:16.430
That's the reason why in 2022, see it for what it is,

02:25:19.557 --> 02:25:27.499
When he said, when Andrew Huff said that he did an interview with Malid Nawaz, he didn't tell you that it was coordinated by CHD.

02:25:28.159 --> 02:25:41.481
He didn't tell you that it was about food supply attacks, which is actually the title of the podcast that he just did with Mary Talley Bowden on X yesterday.

02:25:42.501 --> 02:25:45.002
And so we're supposed to believe, listen carefully,

02:25:48.939 --> 02:25:59.925
Hello everyone from good morning CHD greetings of health and peace from me Shabnam Melissa Mohammed and our technical team including Riley Vujovic me in South Africa.

02:26:00.345 --> 02:26:06.689
So this Indian in South Africa is supposed to be CHD international president

02:26:07.489 --> 02:26:30.819
supposed to be a really good actor in South Africa, you know, the same place where the Panda organization with Nick Hudson is, the same organization that has Jonathan Engler, also of Heart, you know, the organization that Claire Craig, the genetic collector, started, and is on the same paper as Kevin McKernan at the beginning of the pandemic about the PCR non-objection.

02:26:31.279 --> 02:26:36.141
It's all one shitty show, and there's no way that this Indian named Muhammad,

02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:42.669
from South Africa is a legitimate actor and part of the CHD network in South Africa.

02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:48.838
And then what, who is she going to promote besides interviewing Andrew Huff about food supplies?

02:26:49.679 --> 02:26:53.665
She's going to promote a conference with Jessica Rose.

02:26:54.065 --> 02:26:57.248
highly in the US, and you everywhere else in the world.

02:26:57.588 --> 02:27:02.772
Wherever you might be joining this edition of Good Morning CHD, let us know in the chat.

02:27:02.912 --> 02:27:04.594
We love connecting with you.

02:27:04.994 --> 02:27:11.139
So as always, we have an inspiring, informative, and empowering edition of Good Morning CHD for you.

02:27:11.499 --> 02:27:15.923
So I would suggest you grab a glass of water, juice, tea, or coffee, settle in,

02:27:16.523 --> 02:27:23.024
and share the link for the show so people have access to uncensored information guaranteed.

02:27:23.384 --> 02:27:31.045
First up, we'll be sharing some exciting information about the upcoming Children's Health Defense Inaugural Conference coming up in November.

02:27:31.065 --> 02:27:34.566
Of course, I went to this conference thinking that some of these people were good.

02:27:34.646 --> 02:27:39.847
I went to this conference thinking I had to convince CHD that Robert Malone was a bad guy.

02:27:39.867 --> 02:27:45.908
I went to the conference thinking I had to convince Mary Holland that Robert Malone was a bad guy, and that's crazy.

02:27:46.328 --> 02:27:48.809
because they're all on the same team and they know it.

02:27:49.289 --> 02:27:54.591
And so when I started trying to do that, they reacted very odd, as you can imagine.

02:27:55.771 --> 02:27:56.791
Knoxville, Tennessee.

02:27:57.132 --> 02:27:59.932
You can see their beautiful poster up on screen.

02:28:00.333 --> 02:28:01.053
Children's Health.

02:28:01.333 --> 02:28:08.615
Matt Crawford of Rounding the Earth decided to go to this conference and was admitted because Merrill Nass made a phone call for him.

02:28:08.675 --> 02:28:09.736
And he met me there.

02:28:09.956 --> 02:28:11.456
Charles Rixey met me there.

02:28:12.177 --> 02:28:13.497
Robert Malone met me there.

02:28:14.017 --> 02:28:22.928
Ryan Cole met me there, and Pierre Kory met me there, and Brian Hooker met me there, and Brian Hooker didn't really want to meet me there, because I was working on the book then.

02:28:22.988 --> 02:28:30.437
I wasn't really working on for CHD yet, and Brian Hooker hadn't been briefed as to who I was and why he needed to know me.

02:28:31.647 --> 02:28:36.370
Defense, looking for the path forward, uniting to create a better world.

02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:48.777
Excellent speakers, of course, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Catherine Austin Fitts, Mary Holland, Paul Maric, Pierre Corey, Robert Malone, Robert Barnes, Sheila Ely, and Brian Hooker, of course, to register.

02:28:49.177 --> 02:28:52.459
And for additional information, go to our website.

02:28:52.519 --> 02:28:54.180
We would love to see you there.

02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.002
And that's the registration page on the website.

02:28:58.302 --> 02:28:59.043
Get your tickets.

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.924
They're selling out really quickly.

02:29:01.584 --> 02:29:05.107
Let's get together to create a better world for the 99%.

02:29:05.708 --> 02:29:11.193
Then, of course, we'd love to share some important highlights with you from the recent S.A.

02:29:11.353 --> 02:29:12.394
VAERS conference.

02:29:12.714 --> 02:29:13.194
So S.A.

02:29:13.314 --> 02:29:18.198
VAERS is the South African Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in South Africa.

02:29:19.386 --> 02:29:33.690
which is, of course, an independent alternative reporting system by the people, for the people, intended to give voice to victims, to raise transparency, and to enhance chances at accountability and compensation.

02:29:34.490 --> 02:29:45.073
Unfortunately, within the system we're seeing massive amounts of injury, harm, and even death, physical harm, cognitive harm, and, of course, the socioeconomic impact of taking

02:29:45.433 --> 02:29:47.996
the experimental C-19 shots.

02:29:48.516 --> 02:29:54.902
SAV is, of course, supported by medical legal advisors in South Africa and around the world.

02:29:55.183 --> 02:30:01.609
And we held our first conference just two weeks ago, broadcast live on Children's Health Defense.

02:30:01.909 --> 02:30:04.792
If you've missed it, you'll be able to catch that episode

02:30:05.152 --> 02:30:20.865
on chd.tv under the menu tab called events now one of the presenters at the conference was none other than what we call who we call the most dangerous woman in science dr jessica rose who is of course an essayist

02:30:24.682 --> 02:30:31.786
The contract that shows, again, that this is a military project, not a public health project.

02:30:31.886 --> 02:30:32.947
It's a countermeasure.

02:30:33.247 --> 02:30:42.452
So we have the lawyer of Scott Shara pretending to know what he's talking about with regard to the contamination of the shot.

02:30:42.972 --> 02:30:48.077
We have him talking about SV40 and how it was intentionally omitted from the shot.

02:30:48.498 --> 02:30:49.318
And who's doing it?

02:30:49.358 --> 02:30:56.245
Mary Talley Bowden, her on-call podcast, of course, because that's what you do when you're a national security state actor.

02:30:56.646 --> 02:31:06.776
You have a podcast and you interview other national security state actors, and then you publish it on Substack and X. And that's the same thing that these two clowns are doing.

02:31:07.276 --> 02:31:09.678
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna end it really, really fast.

02:31:09.718 --> 02:31:11.099
It's been a long, strange trip.

02:31:11.439 --> 02:31:15.181
Our medical records are being interfaced with our genetic records.

02:31:15.221 --> 02:31:16.142
That's the way they do it.

02:31:16.182 --> 02:31:24.848
They're using this as a standard now, the PCR as standard for diagnosing up to 18 different viral pathogens at once.

02:31:24.888 --> 02:31:26.889
This was accomplished by Team Worst Case Scenario.

02:31:26.909 --> 02:31:31.092
The FDA doesn't care at all because there's a stooge at the FDA and NIH.

02:31:31.132 --> 02:31:36.476
The vaccine schedule has been successfully insulated from any real, real,

02:31:37.717 --> 02:31:43.662
scrutiny, and that was done exclusively by CHD, ICANN, Paul Offit, etc.

02:31:44.043 --> 02:31:53.713
And finally, the vaccine schedule in America will slowly be ramped up and replaced by these new technologies which will eventually be personalized.

02:31:53.733 --> 02:31:58.637
There's no epidemiological evidence of spread because it was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

02:31:59.258 --> 02:32:02.181
and they used murder and sophisticated lies to create it.

02:32:02.221 --> 02:32:06.024
That's why you can see it in this simple graph here.

02:32:06.044 --> 02:32:12.229
You can see the expected rise in all-cause mortality coming already back when I was in high school and in college.

02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:15.812
And this was sculpted using a wide variety of methods.

02:32:15.912 --> 02:32:20.737
Lying about the opioid epidemic was one of the worst ones, but also supplementary oxygen.

02:32:21.137 --> 02:32:23.179
And they needed a team of performers to do it.

02:32:23.579 --> 02:32:25.321
They perpetuated myths.

02:32:25.461 --> 02:32:26.742
They were traitors that did it.

02:32:27.122 --> 02:32:30.604
And they hide those murder with lies, because they're all in the same stupid script.

02:32:31.045 --> 02:32:32.145
That's how you can see it.

02:32:32.345 --> 02:32:34.247
It's the same stupid script.

02:32:34.267 --> 02:32:35.448
This is for all the marbles.

02:32:35.488 --> 02:32:38.229
This is for the children of earth, ladies and gentlemen.

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:40.651
I'm going to snap it right there.

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:43.873
They fooled us into solving their mystery.

02:32:45.074 --> 02:32:47.736
And in so doing, we have accepted all their monsters.

02:32:47.776 --> 02:32:48.516
I love you very much.

02:32:48.596 --> 02:32:50.617
Sorry for the not so great ending.

02:32:51.418 --> 02:32:52.499
I'll definitely see you tomorrow.

02:32:52.519 --> 02:32:53.880
It's going to be a very busy week.

02:32:54.881 --> 02:32:55.603
Thanks for being here.

02:32:55.623 --> 02:32:56.505
See you again soon.

02:32:56.525 --> 02:32:57.828
Bye bye bye bye.

02:33:36.053 --> 02:33:38.057
It's better to be free.
