WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
those are all started. So let's see if we get a stream on Twitch.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.200
Gigalome biological is live right now. Gigalome biological is live right now.

00:28.200 --> 00:35.080
Excellent. Alright, here we go ladies and gentlemen. I'm very happy to be live on

00:35.080 --> 00:42.680
four different streams. I hope it's all working now. Let's get this started.

00:58.200 --> 01:06.840
I had lots of trouble getting that going. Something was out of sync. I had to start over again.

01:06.840 --> 01:13.640
But we're here now. Thanks very much for being here with me. I need a sound check in a minute.

01:13.640 --> 01:35.240
Give me a sound check. I think I should be okay. Don't forget that we are moving toward a

01:35.240 --> 01:43.320
broader understanding of the message here and that includes taking advantage of all the things

01:43.320 --> 01:46.920
that I'm learning through the broken science initiative and all the things that I'm learning

01:46.920 --> 01:51.880
from the reading and from the discussions of this. I think it's really important that if you

01:52.520 --> 01:57.560
want to make a little bit of an impression on them from Gigalome it would be great if you'd go to

01:57.560 --> 02:04.040
brokenscience.org and just open up an account and you know you can make up a name you're going

02:04.040 --> 02:08.840
to give them your email but it would make that an impression on them if suddenly people started

02:08.920 --> 02:14.600
to register on their account in a way that they hadn't in a while so maybe we can send a message

02:14.600 --> 02:19.320
that way. Thank you very much. Maybe we can send a message that way so it's brokenscience.org.

02:19.320 --> 02:26.360
All you got to do is register and when you do so they'll see it. They don't have a lot of members

02:26.360 --> 02:32.760
on that website and there's not a lot yet on that website but I think it's worthwhile to say hello

02:32.760 --> 02:36.920
to them for me so thanks very much and let's get started.

02:41.400 --> 02:47.640
Oh man I'm gonna do this right now because I just think it's so cool. I don't know if you're aware

02:48.920 --> 02:52.920
but this is just for the hard course okay this is just for the hard course

02:54.760 --> 03:01.960
but I don't know I think I have permission to say it just because I said I was gonna say it and I

03:02.760 --> 03:11.400
didn't he didn't say no but I don't know if you're aware or not but Rodney has some bad hips

03:12.200 --> 03:18.280
and if you go on YouTube you can find videos of him telling the story about how his hips

03:19.000 --> 03:28.680
became locked with fibers and he used like the point of a fire hydrant and he used like a screw

03:28.680 --> 03:34.040
driver with some tape on the end to drive into his hips and break that fibrous stuff up

03:34.600 --> 03:38.840
and at some point he figured out that he could really put a lot of leverage on his leg

03:39.480 --> 03:45.080
by putting his leg inside of a wheel well of a car and then leaning back or something

03:45.080 --> 03:52.520
and eventually it popped open and he broke his his fibrotic or whatever it was that was

03:52.600 --> 04:02.680
tearing and clogging and making his hips unable to move he broke that free with free with pure

04:02.680 --> 04:09.720
will but he didn't I mean he didn't escape the damage that all of this this skateboarding did to

04:09.720 --> 04:18.760
his skeleton and musculature so anyway he had surgery about let's say six months ago I don't

04:18.840 --> 04:25.400
know exactly how long ago it was and since he's been recovery I haven't heard very much from him

04:25.400 --> 04:30.440
because he's got a busy life and his wife has a busy life that he's involved in and so it's a

04:31.160 --> 04:38.920
it's a you know I mean who am I right I'm already grateful that that he came to Pittsburgh those

04:38.920 --> 04:44.120
many times and said hello and and it was because of happenstance and serendipity that

04:44.680 --> 04:47.640
that his significant other was working in Pittsburgh and we could meet

04:48.840 --> 04:54.520
but I got this message from him because I asked him how his recovery was after

04:55.080 --> 05:01.480
um his surgery and I I it just touched me so much I wanted to share it with you and I know that

05:01.480 --> 05:08.760
there are some people out there and I know uh welcome the eagle um Albert is a skateboarder

05:08.760 --> 05:12.520
and I know a few other people have given me some crap because I'm not a skateboarder but

05:12.520 --> 05:21.160
somehow or another Rodney Mullen is my friend now um I still have a cough I'm not uh

05:23.000 --> 05:28.040
I'm not unaware of how how blessed I am in that sense let me read this to you please

05:29.000 --> 05:35.160
man thank you for asking so I asked uh I just said please let me know if you are rolling again

05:35.160 --> 05:41.400
and how your recovery is going if you want to send a clip I won't mind um man thank you for

05:41.480 --> 05:48.520
asking I've been rolling since January 1st which felt like a kind of rebirth on that very day

05:48.520 --> 05:56.280
that I started skating as a kid 1 1 1970 70 still remembers that my surgical nurse was so

05:56.280 --> 06:02.360
skeptical and cautious that she couldn't bring herself to say skateboard grinning letting me know

06:02.360 --> 06:09.880
I could return to that thing you do my doctor is so special in that it may be against better

06:09.880 --> 06:14.440
judgment but knows what it means to me and trust that I'll act accordingly so far

06:15.080 --> 06:22.200
so all capital is good it is a gift to be restored every day stronger plus it's a comedy is my

06:22.200 --> 06:28.120
gr- my brain grapples with proprioception my feet are nowhere near where they were plus

06:28.120 --> 06:34.360
angulation plays crazy games with compression and rippling ways has if mocking but it is joy

06:35.000 --> 06:45.320
plus snap uh he does the derivative here of force over time is back in ways that again comedy

06:45.320 --> 06:51.640
and joy no more pain no more waddle a writer friend with a beautiful mind is having me

06:51.640 --> 06:59.080
chronicle at nightly so we can eventually publish something cool so that that's uh he says some nice

06:59.160 --> 07:04.760
things to my hello to my daughter and stuff and uh so that's just a warm message to know that

07:04.760 --> 07:11.560
Rodney Mullen is standing up straight he's keeping his arms straight and after many many many many

07:11.560 --> 07:17.160
years of people telling him he would never skate again he's skating again and then skating again

07:17.160 --> 07:22.840
and then skating on top of that and then he had surgery and now he's skating with a straighter

07:22.840 --> 07:28.920
posture than he has in probably 20 or 30 years I probably won't even recognize him when I see him

07:29.880 --> 07:35.720
and I can still remember that guy that got out of the uber in in Pittsburgh with a hunched over

07:35.720 --> 07:47.720
back and and jeans and a big giant big giant hat on uh stocking cap on and I had no idea who

07:47.720 --> 07:52.760
Rodney Mullen was I actually just thought of him as Rodney M because Rodney M the guy that was

07:52.760 --> 07:56.840
supporting me wanted to meet me at a cafe and I wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not

07:59.080 --> 08:13.720
and to think I almost missed that out I almost I almost missed out on that I mean it's crazy

08:29.080 --> 08:39.960
that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that the latest data tells us that

08:39.960 --> 08:44.600
we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that

08:44.600 --> 08:45.960
we're dealing with essentially I

08:51.960 --> 08:55.960
Mark has been working hard lately I think he's got eight days in a row now check those

08:55.960 --> 08:59.880
streams out if you haven't seen him they should be archived on rumble and elsewhere I know that

08:59.880 --> 09:04.600
he's got to pull him a lot of times from youtube for safety's sake but he does have archive

09:04.600 --> 09:07.000
channels so please check those out

09:20.520 --> 09:25.720
I think truth is good for kids we're so busy lying we don't even recognize the truth no more

09:25.800 --> 09:30.920
in society we want everybody to feel good that's not that's not the way life is

09:33.320 --> 09:37.320
but you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it in people

09:38.920 --> 09:43.720
and I have lied I'm sure I'll lie again I don't want to lie you know I don't think I'm a liar

09:43.720 --> 09:49.080
I try not to be a liar I don't want to be a liar I think it's like really important not to be a liar

09:55.880 --> 09:57.880
Oh

10:20.840 --> 10:23.480
the rules protect yourself at all times

10:23.480 --> 10:28.040
Follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish. Let's do it

10:29.160 --> 10:31.660
20 pounds. This is so crazy

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
Like these bumps

10:34.400 --> 10:38.900
This is so crazy. I feel so nervous like what in the world man

10:53.880 --> 11:00.600
That website is broken science dot org broken science dot org look at Pamela coming in in the clutch I

11:01.720 --> 11:06.040
Got a shirt on that somebody by the name of Pamela sent me in a box. I

11:07.240 --> 11:09.560
Don't really know how that works. I get these

11:11.960 --> 11:18.560
Some lady named Pamela and most of the clothes are cute for my daughter and sometimes my my boys are really

11:19.560 --> 11:23.240
You've been following me for a while. You've been following me for a while

11:25.240 --> 11:31.720
Not you might be a skilled TV watcher or getting washed over because you're not staying focused on the biology

11:31.720 --> 11:37.560
You're taking the bait on TV and social media, and you're probably not loving your neighbor, and that's the reason

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
That's the reason

11:40.720 --> 11:43.760
So this is how it works, you know people contribute to my work

11:43.760 --> 11:49.440
But more importantly they share it and the sharing of the work is finally starting to have some effect

11:52.120 --> 11:56.720
You can find me at giggle biological calm and giga home dot bio

11:56.720 --> 12:04.480
And actually we are now the live stream is at stream dot giga home dot bio, and I think it's actually working if you wouldn't mind checking

12:05.120 --> 12:10.000
That is the chat that I can put up on the stream and we'll put up on the stream

12:10.160 --> 12:15.320
We are also on rumble and youtube and we are trying to make that a more regular thing

12:18.400 --> 12:27.680
There are also lots of ways to help there that are that are all tried to be a little bit more convenient and people that have pulled that trigger and tried to help

12:28.440 --> 12:32.920
The list is long. We just you know put different people there for different reasons

12:33.560 --> 12:41.320
Some people give you know a large sum of money at once, and I consider a large sum of money at once quite frankly a hundred dollars because

12:41.720 --> 12:46.320
I have never given a hundred dollars to anyone on the internet. I once gave a fifty dollar

12:47.520 --> 12:50.880
Super chat to mark use a ton and other than that

12:52.480 --> 12:58.240
I'm not really a big giver, and so I am absolutely shocked at how

12:58.560 --> 13:04.760
How we have been able to raise enough money to have my family

13:07.280 --> 13:14.640
Survived as a part of this independent bright web, and I am very humbled by the fact that so many people support this work

13:15.360 --> 13:16.800
in that vein

13:16.800 --> 13:22.080
Giga home biological is about to really really put the pedal to the metal

13:22.960 --> 13:27.120
And I don't mean that in a desperate way. I mean that in a consistency way

13:27.640 --> 13:29.640
It has been hard for me

13:30.120 --> 13:35.400
To find a consistent pattern, and I'm gonna try redouble my efforts to do that

13:37.280 --> 13:40.880
Given the fact that I do have some reservations about how we move forward

13:41.880 --> 13:45.320
I do have some reservations about how sustainable a

13:46.320 --> 13:51.680
Stream that just constantly complains about the about the world health state

13:51.680 --> 13:56.480
I don't know how sustainable that is and I don't think that that's the message that

13:58.120 --> 14:02.280
I don't think that's the message that I'm meant to be that I meant to be pushing

14:02.280 --> 14:05.240
I think the message that I meant to be pushing is a lot closer

14:06.640 --> 14:11.800
to a more ancient message about peace and love

14:16.680 --> 14:20.400
Because I am a human just like you I don't have much more other than that

14:21.000 --> 14:25.880
and so as a biologist and as a father and as a husband as a

14:26.520 --> 14:28.520
A kite flyer a dog lover

14:30.440 --> 14:33.080
I just want to help people understand

14:33.880 --> 14:40.760
What has happened and where we are and how we got here, and I think it's a little bit of a history of science thing

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
I think it's a little bit of a

14:46.400 --> 14:49.320
There's a lot of pieces of it of the puzzle that are moving

14:50.320 --> 14:58.520
Right now especially and I think it's really really important that that all of us find a place a

15:00.120 --> 15:02.120
A place where we can dwell a

15:03.000 --> 15:07.720
Place where we can come to to find that kind of confirmation that we're not crazy and

15:08.440 --> 15:10.800
for me a lot of times that place is

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
Mark Koolak show

15:13.880 --> 15:17.320
He was a tonic ITS because he's a guy who

15:18.160 --> 15:23.560
Without too much certainty can at least you know throw some stuff up against the wall

15:23.880 --> 15:28.720
Draw some connections with you know articles and and what appear to be

15:29.960 --> 15:31.960
factual

15:32.080 --> 15:39.480
crossing of paths of people in time and in place and and in ideas and

15:40.600 --> 15:43.680
Those intersections I think are really important because

15:47.320 --> 15:52.120
those intersections are where these ideas sets that I think compromise

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
comprise rather a

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
Mythology that we have been handed down

15:59.160 --> 16:02.920
And this mythology is something that actually our our parents gave to us

16:03.480 --> 16:06.120
And I don't think it is too much to say

16:06.840 --> 16:14.920
That the awakening that everyone thinks is happening is actually not happening. We are tumbling down the hill a snowball

16:15.880 --> 16:18.280
Dirty on one side and rocky on the other

16:19.000 --> 16:23.480
And it feels as though we're making progress but in reality

16:23.480 --> 16:27.000
We are tumbling down a hill and at the bottom of the hill is our demise

16:28.600 --> 16:33.560
And that analogy may not be good enough because we have more control over this tumble than you think

16:34.520 --> 16:38.280
But the way that we gain control is to understand that this snowball

16:39.400 --> 16:41.400
Is an illusion

16:41.400 --> 16:46.600
The momentum is an illusion that is created by our continued participation

16:47.320 --> 16:51.160
In this system and our continued participation in the argument

16:52.040 --> 16:53.160
And so

16:53.160 --> 16:55.480
We're going to have to look at the argument regularly

16:55.480 --> 16:57.640
We're going to have to look at the people who are proposing

16:58.200 --> 17:00.920
That one side of the other side of the argument is correct

17:00.920 --> 17:03.480
We're going to have to look at the argument from the inside

17:04.200 --> 17:09.400
In order to be able to see it accurately on the outside for the limited spectrum of debate that it is

17:11.640 --> 17:17.400
And so the giga ohm biological high resistance low noise information brief is a biology centered

17:18.120 --> 17:24.280
Message designed to crack through that mythology which extends its tentacles throughout our

17:28.200 --> 17:29.960
A very understanding of reality

17:31.560 --> 17:38.040
And as much as I would like to say that this is just a very recent development because of the algorithms of social media

17:38.520 --> 17:45.400
We can go back to edward bernays in the 20s and find him describing a very similar system

17:46.680 --> 17:49.480
Albeit executed through a limited

17:50.280 --> 17:52.840
You know, they had many less tv channels

17:53.880 --> 17:56.600
They had many less newspapers or maybe not

17:57.560 --> 18:00.280
Many more magazines, maybe more readership there

18:02.040 --> 18:03.640
But they use the same idea

18:03.720 --> 18:08.440
It is a conscious manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of all of us

18:09.240 --> 18:11.240
That allow us to be governed in this

18:11.880 --> 18:16.680
Huge number of people thinking kind of more or less the same

18:18.520 --> 18:22.760
And in previous generations, this was more aptly achieved by religion

18:22.760 --> 18:26.040
This was more aptly more effectively achieved

18:26.040 --> 18:28.600
Maybe let's say that the levers of

18:29.240 --> 18:32.600
Of social control held by the churches

18:33.560 --> 18:40.200
Were more influential than the levers held by newspapers the printing press or even the ruling class

18:41.960 --> 18:46.760
And as we've moved into our our current state

18:48.120 --> 18:56.280
It might seem as though social media and mainstream media has now taken over the phone has taken over

18:57.000 --> 19:01.720
With with regard to controlling the stories that control us

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
And

19:04.600 --> 19:08.840
I think that's a nice way to look at it is is that we are governed by stories

19:08.840 --> 19:10.840
We have always been governed by stories

19:10.840 --> 19:12.600
The stories that they

19:12.600 --> 19:19.000
Would like you to reject are the stories about God and the stories about creation and the stories about the divine

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
and the stories about our

19:21.720 --> 19:23.720
our

19:25.960 --> 19:28.200
The sacred nature of our existence

19:29.160 --> 19:36.520
Those are the mythologies that they would like you to to discard as as being fundamentalist or crazy or

19:37.160 --> 19:40.040
or based on faith and and

19:41.800 --> 19:43.640
And ghosts or or whatever

19:45.080 --> 19:49.080
And instead they would like you to adapt the idea that science big s

19:50.520 --> 19:55.320
Is the way forward and that our understanding of ourselves has debunked God

19:56.280 --> 20:01.960
Our our understanding and mastery of science has made God irrelevant

20:01.960 --> 20:06.200
And we don't need that explanation for reality anymore when we know so much

20:08.360 --> 20:13.800
And of course this almost when you say it that way almost really comes back to a sort of garden of Eden kind of thing

20:16.600 --> 20:20.360
Where it's the knowledge right that that was so dangerous

20:20.360 --> 20:24.360
It is the idea that we can attain that knowledge that is the danger

20:25.720 --> 20:33.560
And i'm not even sure that that that the parable of of the garden of Eden is that far off from the target in the sense of

20:34.680 --> 20:38.680
How how do you go about out into nature seeking knowledge?

20:38.680 --> 20:46.600
Do you seek knowledge as as an as a mastery or as a as a way of answering the sacred or dispelling it

20:47.240 --> 20:50.200
Which would essentially be the same as as desecrating it

20:51.160 --> 20:55.080
Or do you see knowledge as a way of worshiping the sacred of as a way of

20:55.880 --> 20:57.800
of showing reverence for the sacred

20:58.680 --> 21:02.680
And I think that's where they don't want you to understand the truth of it

21:02.680 --> 21:08.760
Which is that that there's a very healthy way to be a biologist and a scientist and a doctor

21:09.240 --> 21:13.720
And have respect for the sacred have reverence for the sacred operate with the idea

21:14.520 --> 21:16.520
Of the sacred being paramount

21:17.480 --> 21:19.480
But they don't want that

21:19.480 --> 21:23.960
I think that's the part of this big picture that i'm starting to really

21:24.440 --> 21:26.440
get a grasp on after

21:26.840 --> 21:27.960
taking

21:27.960 --> 21:30.680
A few days off and and a few steps back

21:31.400 --> 21:35.240
And trying to understand what it is that they would like me to argue about

21:36.680 --> 21:39.880
Versus what it is that I I probably shouldn't talk about

21:40.440 --> 21:42.920
And so we're going to talk about things that I shouldn't talk about

21:43.720 --> 21:45.720
We're going to talk about

21:45.880 --> 21:50.040
About the stories that they don't want us to talk about in the motivations that they don't want to talk about

21:50.520 --> 21:53.960
In order to try and dispel this lever of power

21:57.000 --> 22:01.080
This lever of power I think has been more most recently expressed

22:02.680 --> 22:04.920
In terms of the intellectual dark web back there

22:06.120 --> 22:08.120
And I think if you can see

22:08.600 --> 22:09.720
the

22:09.720 --> 22:14.760
Internet as being not the wild west but actually a very orchestrated picture

22:15.240 --> 22:17.240
orchestrated in part by

22:17.640 --> 22:23.720
The algorithms but also in part by their being content for the algorithms to choose for you

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
If they didn't produce content

22:27.240 --> 22:28.440
That they

22:28.440 --> 22:33.160
Wanted the algorithm to put in front of you then to a certain extent the system would still be random

22:33.240 --> 22:41.240
And if there wasn't good content out there that fit the needs of the fifth generation warfare that they are definitely waging on us

22:42.040 --> 22:45.560
Then it would be a lot more difficult for them to do it with just an algorithm

22:45.560 --> 22:49.800
But if you have an algorithm and you also have content creators

22:50.680 --> 22:56.440
That are creating the exact content that you need for the exact groups of people that you're trying to influence

22:56.840 --> 22:59.640
With the exact combinations of truth and lies

23:00.040 --> 23:05.560
Has dictated by the formula that you're running across the world in multiple languages

23:06.440 --> 23:10.520
We're supposed to be afraid of the 77th brigade

23:10.520 --> 23:16.120
But assume that there isn't that same thing going on in every western and non-western country in the world that can

23:21.400 --> 23:23.880
We're supposed to assume that every other country in the world

23:24.280 --> 23:28.920
Including our own just goes limp and says please facebook will you censor some of these people

23:30.760 --> 23:32.440
And we're supposed to be angry about that

23:32.440 --> 23:36.120
We're not supposed to be angry about the possibility that there could be planted

23:36.920 --> 23:40.600
messengers that are elevated on the platform

23:47.160 --> 23:52.120
Is it possible to start a podcast and in a year have a hundred thousand subscribers

23:54.920 --> 23:59.640
Is it possible to open a twitter account and in a year have a hundred thousand followers

24:00.520 --> 24:03.320
Unless

24:03.320 --> 24:05.480
The algorithm wants you to

24:05.480 --> 24:08.760
Unless you are pushing a message that the algorithm likes

24:09.640 --> 24:11.480
Is it possible? I don't think so

24:12.280 --> 24:14.680
And I think you could go out and try it you could put out

24:15.240 --> 24:21.640
Open up a thousand accounts and choose a thousand different messages that you think are popular

24:22.440 --> 24:28.040
But not part of the mainstream narrative that the mainstream narrative would like to amplify and I guarantee you

24:28.680 --> 24:31.320
All thousand of those accounts would never find

24:32.040 --> 24:34.360
a hundred thousand followers not in all

24:35.400 --> 24:38.680
The best ways of promoting them it just wouldn't happen

24:39.880 --> 24:47.000
But on the other hand if you if you start a podcast and you talk about the things that you're supposed to talk about

24:48.040 --> 24:50.280
I think there's a good chance that you will rise up

24:51.640 --> 24:54.280
But more importantly, and I think that this is really

24:54.840 --> 24:58.040
So important to understand I'm going to switch back over here

24:59.800 --> 25:03.400
There are people who have been put in place

25:04.040 --> 25:09.080
as early as 2017 in order to stake intellectual

25:10.440 --> 25:16.360
And sort of metaphysical ground if you will inside of the internet in the form of followers

25:17.400 --> 25:19.400
And presence

25:19.880 --> 25:24.360
So that when this job was executed they already had those people there

25:24.760 --> 25:27.240
They already had these trusted opinions there

25:28.200 --> 25:32.760
And if you don't think that that has occurred then you're grossly underestimating

25:33.480 --> 25:38.680
The breadth and the depth of the operation being executed against us that they are using primarily

25:39.320 --> 25:42.200
To undermine the republic of the united states

25:42.200 --> 25:51.160
They were put in place years before because years of trust were necessary

25:53.000 --> 25:57.880
And again, this is a multi-generational operation a multi-generational plan

26:00.440 --> 26:02.440
And it's a club we are not in

26:02.920 --> 26:06.920
But you can see clearly the people who are in the club because they don't

26:07.560 --> 26:14.200
Fight for our grandchildren. They don't plant trees under whose shade they will never shelter

26:18.040 --> 26:21.560
And that's what I believe mark is doing. That's what I believe I'm doing

26:21.560 --> 26:25.160
That's what I believe Jessica hocket is doing in a very few other people

26:30.280 --> 26:36.120
I want this over with so that my children can raise their children in peace and in freedom

26:37.880 --> 26:39.880
I don't want to go back

26:41.240 --> 26:47.080
To 2019 where the flag is here. That's not my plan. It's a reminder of where we were

26:48.680 --> 26:52.360
But I don't want to go back to 2019. I want to go back to something better

26:53.000 --> 26:57.720
With my eyes wide open in 2019. I knew nothing in 2019

26:57.720 --> 27:01.000
I was giving all my shots to my kids in 2019

27:01.480 --> 27:06.280
If my doctor said that my wife should have a hysterectomy, I'd probably be like, okay, I guess you saw you know

27:07.640 --> 27:09.640
I

27:10.200 --> 27:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to go back to 2019. You don't want to go back to 2019

27:15.000 --> 27:19.320
I want to go back. I want to go to a place that is not where we are going

27:21.400 --> 27:25.160
I want to take our children to a place where we are currently not headed

27:26.680 --> 27:29.240
And I want to do it by telling our children the truth

27:30.200 --> 27:35.320
The truth about how we have been governed about how our parents were governed and why it's not their fault either

27:37.800 --> 27:38.920
And

27:38.920 --> 27:41.080
When we wake up to the the

27:42.040 --> 27:45.880
The sheer ridiculousness of how we have been living for the past

27:46.520 --> 27:53.800
40 years and the responsibility that our parents and ourselves have abdicated thinking that everything was fine

27:54.520 --> 27:57.240
When it wasn't because we were told it was fine

27:59.080 --> 28:01.080
When it wasn't

28:02.040 --> 28:08.600
But that's not an excuse to keep sitting in a car that's about to crash. That's not an excuse to not try

28:10.040 --> 28:12.040
And write the ship

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
It's not an excuse to go limp

28:16.760 --> 28:23.000
It's an excuse for every single one of us who knows to take responsibility again first for ourselves

28:24.040 --> 28:27.640
And that means every day we need to be stoic about how we do things

28:28.520 --> 28:29.480
and

28:29.480 --> 28:35.960
Have goals every day of what we want to accomplish a list of things that we want to accomplish of things that we're going to get better at

28:37.160 --> 28:39.160
And we're going to do it

28:39.320 --> 28:41.320
So that our kids see it

28:43.160 --> 28:45.880
And then when we ask when they ask us why we'll have an answer

28:49.080 --> 28:51.960
Because we are fighting for what's sacred we are fighting for

28:52.840 --> 28:57.800
A return to a sort of reverence in a humility to what we don't understand

28:58.760 --> 29:00.760
instead of an arrogance and

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
sort of ignorance

29:04.120 --> 29:07.000
Under the pretense that there is nothing left to know

29:11.400 --> 29:14.120
They have not allowed us to exercise informed consent

29:14.120 --> 29:20.600
And I do think that that is one very good way for us to bridge the gap with these young people to explain to them that look

29:22.280 --> 29:27.160
I didn't know you didn't know and it was by design. And so I'm sorry. I blew it

29:27.720 --> 29:29.720
I should have known better, but I didn't

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
Here's how we get out

29:34.280 --> 29:37.640
Scientific questions, I think are very hard to get a handle on

29:38.120 --> 29:43.000
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in

29:43.960 --> 29:48.920
There's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it

29:48.920 --> 29:54.920
And so um, you know, and so the the um and so in this world of extreme hyper specialization

29:55.080 --> 29:57.880
So I would I would correct that and say that there are too many

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
lies

30:00.760 --> 30:02.760
There are too many false

30:03.480 --> 30:05.480
facts

30:06.360 --> 30:10.440
And because there are so many things that are paraded around as false facts

30:10.520 --> 30:15.000
There are so many models that have not been verified through prediction and testing

30:15.560 --> 30:17.560
And

30:17.560 --> 30:19.560
That is not knowledge

30:20.520 --> 30:28.200
And so he is being very disingenuous here when he says this but he's speaking to a certain audience who understands this subtlety

30:30.280 --> 30:36.200
But I need you to hear this because this is 2019 right before the pandemic where he tells the absolute truth

30:36.600 --> 30:39.880
On the first podcast with eric Weinstein the portal

30:39.880 --> 30:48.360
The intellectual dark web placed right before the pandemic a couple years on purpose

30:50.680 --> 30:52.680
First in the context of

30:53.880 --> 30:55.720
Brett Weinstein's

30:55.720 --> 31:00.120
Senate appearance how many times is this guy bed in front of the senate for doing what?

31:02.680 --> 31:08.040
For being a below average academic at a school that's nobody's heard of where he's never done research and

31:08.520 --> 31:10.520
published exactly one paper

31:12.520 --> 31:15.800
To speaking in front of the senate about the woke culture

31:17.320 --> 31:20.360
Then he went on to have a entirely influential

31:20.920 --> 31:24.040
Influence list podcast that I'd never heard of before the pandemic

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
With the likes of what joe rogan

31:28.840 --> 31:32.200
Sam harris and his brother eric Weinstein a

31:33.080 --> 31:34.680
advisor to

31:34.680 --> 31:36.360
Peter teal

31:36.360 --> 31:38.920
one of the heads of the weaponized piles of money

31:40.760 --> 31:48.520
And so to kick off his podcast in 2019 he thought he'd have his boss on this you know titan of big money

31:51.320 --> 31:57.880
Who was already invested in an antibody manufacturing company in canada among other things

32:00.040 --> 32:06.200
On telling us about how science works and about how science is overextended and about how there's too much knowledge

32:06.440 --> 32:13.640
For anybody to understand no there's too much nonsense in conjecture and bad models out there for anybody to understand

32:15.000 --> 32:22.200
And worse yet there are people who don't seem to understand that their models are not models their their models are not even

32:22.680 --> 32:27.640
Theories or hypotheses yet, but they're just conjecture and they're sticking to them like they're already laws

32:29.720 --> 32:32.280
And that is what he's calling knowledge here

32:33.000 --> 32:35.480
Which makes it very difficult to understand science

32:35.480 --> 32:37.480
This is really it

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
This is how they do it

32:41.240 --> 32:46.840
This is the kind of enchantment that we have been under for years now they have hyper

32:48.440 --> 32:51.160
Sharpen this message messaging style

32:52.360 --> 33:01.960
Where subtle semantics allow this to slip under the radar of skilled social media users and skilled tv watchers

33:02.840 --> 33:09.880
But for their own group for their inside they totally understand exactly what they're saying. He's telling them

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
right now

33:12.600 --> 33:18.440
That science is overextended and the politicization of science is dangerous and so I start with not believing them

33:21.560 --> 33:29.000
Why would he send this message from eric weinstein's podcast six months before the pandemic started or three months before the pandemic started

33:29.400 --> 33:36.920
Why would sam harris be on brett weinstein's podcast and say that we won't be able to tolerate anti-vaxxers in the next pandemic in december of

33:38.040 --> 33:39.320
2019

33:39.320 --> 33:42.680
Really you think that's by accident that they are so smart

33:45.720 --> 33:50.120
Or can you see it like i'm trying to argue it that none of this is by accident

33:53.160 --> 33:55.160
That this is part of a theater

33:56.120 --> 33:58.120
Designed to make you believe a story

33:58.680 --> 34:05.240
An elaborate mythology that has a lot of biological detail to it and even p-values

34:09.400 --> 34:13.640
And this story we are supposed to take seriously enough to teach our children about it

34:15.400 --> 34:18.520
So that our grandchildren are lost and enslaved

34:19.240 --> 34:23.880
To these owners of weaponized piles of money. That's what I think is going on right here

34:23.960 --> 34:26.120
Right, I can't do the pointing with this camera

34:28.040 --> 34:30.040
That's what I think I see

34:30.920 --> 34:36.120
Listen to the rest of this and then we'll skip over it will do the do the second half of the video and then we'll go

34:36.440 --> 34:42.760
To get a handle on and the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in

34:43.720 --> 34:47.640
There's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand

34:48.920 --> 34:53.240
And so you know and so the the and so in this world of extreme

34:53.880 --> 34:56.520
Specialization where it's narrower and narrower um

34:57.400 --> 35:00.920
Subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are

35:01.240 --> 35:06.840
The string theorists talking about how great string theory is the cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer

35:06.840 --> 35:10.680
The quantum computer researchers are just about to build you know quantum computer

35:10.680 --> 35:15.160
There will be a massive breakthrough and then if you were to say that all these fields not much is happening

35:15.800 --> 35:19.080
People just don't have the authority for this. This is somehow a very different

35:19.640 --> 35:21.000
feel for

35:21.000 --> 35:27.480
Science or and so what he said there with too many words is that physics is kind of overextended

35:29.560 --> 35:31.560
Quantum computing kind of overextended

35:32.840 --> 35:37.400
He didn't mention genetics and biology and medicine, but that's also overextended

35:39.960 --> 35:46.440
And what he's suggesting and what he's saying in his coded language is that all of these things have become bs

35:46.520 --> 35:48.920
Caring cancer has is a bs story

35:50.840 --> 35:53.160
Because it's a simple answer to a simply

35:54.600 --> 35:56.600
described problem which we know is

35:58.440 --> 36:00.440
The exact opposite of simple

36:02.520 --> 36:07.960
Because again, we're talking about a complexity which is irreducible. We're talking about a sacredness

36:08.680 --> 36:10.360
That we need to

36:10.360 --> 36:14.840
Forget about or even not acknowledge exists in order to think about that as a tractable

36:15.800 --> 36:18.200
Problem that doesn't have its root in

36:19.240 --> 36:25.480
Environmental toxicity pollution and a thousand other things that we do wrong rather than as a problem with no

36:26.200 --> 36:28.040
No root, but we can cure it

36:30.360 --> 36:33.000
And so he's still not really saying it right

36:33.640 --> 36:38.200
This is still an awful message either coming from someone who his thick

36:38.920 --> 36:42.840
Or actually has an ulterior motive in saying these half truths

36:45.800 --> 36:46.840
I

36:46.840 --> 36:48.360
Apologize for that

36:48.360 --> 36:53.000
Knowledge and you would have had in 1800 or even in 1900

36:53.000 --> 36:55.800
You know 1800 go to could still understand just about everything

36:56.440 --> 37:01.320
1900 hilbert could still understand just about see that's weird though because if he says that

37:02.040 --> 37:06.760
quantum mechanics and quantum computing and cancer research and

37:07.400 --> 37:10.520
And and all these other things are actually nonsense

37:10.600 --> 37:12.680
And they haven't made progress in a long time

37:12.680 --> 37:14.840
And then we're not as far away from those

37:15.320 --> 37:20.040
Earlier days as they would like us to believe as science has led us to believe as

37:20.520 --> 37:23.800
Postmodern science has led us to believe as paparion

37:24.360 --> 37:31.880
Reiterative science and falsification has led us to believe and that's what's at the heart of the broken science initiative

37:33.880 --> 37:37.160
Is this idea that what science has been corrupted

37:37.160 --> 37:44.040
Intentionally or unintentionally wittingly or unwittingly academia over decades

37:44.600 --> 37:48.840
Has been increasingly corrupted into believing that paparion science where you

37:49.320 --> 37:55.720
Divide a hypothesis into two and you decide between one or the other using p values

37:56.680 --> 38:01.720
Has brought us deeper and deeper and deeper into this dark age

38:02.520 --> 38:06.760
Because we call that knowledge just like this

38:07.720 --> 38:12.120
Guy with a shirt bursting open calls it knowledge

38:13.160 --> 38:15.160
It's not knowledge

38:15.960 --> 38:22.440
It's not knowledge if you're not using a model and testing the model to make predictions in the future that you can accurately measure

38:22.440 --> 38:25.880
And then confirming that with the actual measurements then you're not

38:27.240 --> 38:29.240
You're not creating knowledge

38:29.480 --> 38:31.480
And

38:31.480 --> 38:33.480
That's the part of the broken science

38:34.120 --> 38:38.520
Thing that took a really it took a really long time but for that to settle in how powerful

38:39.000 --> 38:41.880
That idea is and how important it is for somebody like me

38:42.360 --> 38:46.760
Who's teaching biology and wants to teach biology in the future more often

38:47.240 --> 38:51.560
Needs to understand and how I can use that to plant hand holds

38:52.760 --> 38:56.760
To plant like safety line as we scale this face

38:59.400 --> 39:01.400
But it's super important

39:02.280 --> 39:04.520
Because when consensus is replaced

39:06.360 --> 39:11.720
Sorry when consensus replaces validation then science becomes nonsense

39:13.640 --> 39:16.760
And since we have replaced consensus

39:17.240 --> 39:20.760
Or sorry, we have replay gosh said it again. We have replaced

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
validation with consensus

39:24.520 --> 39:27.640
Then a lot of these fields have become nonsense cancer

39:28.440 --> 39:30.440
String theory

39:30.440 --> 39:32.280
Quantum physics

39:32.280 --> 39:34.200
Quantum computing whatever he said

39:35.240 --> 39:39.640
These places a lot of things in neuroscience have become nonsense because again

39:40.120 --> 39:47.320
This consensus on preparing science has not has gotten us to the stage where we don't believe anything anymore

39:49.960 --> 39:52.440
We don't think anything is provable anymore

39:52.520 --> 39:59.400
That's one of the foundational ideas of paparian science that that people like sam harris believe in with all their heart and might with

40:00.680 --> 40:04.360
Brett Weinstein would argue that paparian science is what we do

40:04.920 --> 40:06.920
And would not understand

40:07.320 --> 40:12.280
That broken science is an initiative that speaks exactly against that

40:13.640 --> 40:17.240
That's that's it. That's it right there. And that's where we're going

40:17.640 --> 40:23.320
That's how we beat these people who are stuck or rather have used paparian science to

40:23.880 --> 40:28.200
Create so much knowledge that all of us don't know where we are anymore

40:30.520 --> 40:36.600
And that is why this description is so valuable why I keep using it over and over and why every time I listen to it

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
I get more out of it

40:40.360 --> 40:45.160
Because he describes exactly the problem that broken science the initiative

40:45.720 --> 40:50.120
Of of greg glassman and emily caplin has identified as the root

40:50.840 --> 40:52.200
Problem

40:52.200 --> 40:54.920
Is that we do not create knowledge anymore?

40:56.600 --> 41:02.920
We don't make it anymore. We don't know how to make it anymore our academic institutions are

41:03.480 --> 41:06.680
Designed and funded not to anymore

41:09.240 --> 41:11.240
That's what's so brilliant about it

41:12.120 --> 41:14.120
All

41:14.120 --> 41:17.160
All of mathematics and and so the sort of um

41:18.120 --> 41:19.400
feel for

41:19.400 --> 41:21.000
science or knowledge

41:21.000 --> 41:24.920
Then you would have had in 1800 or even in 1900

41:24.920 --> 41:27.560
And 800 greg could still understand just about everything

41:28.120 --> 41:30.120
1900 hilbert could still understand

41:30.680 --> 41:35.880
Just about all of mathematics and and so the sort of um this sort of specialization

41:36.360 --> 41:39.640
I think has made it a much harder question to get a handle on

41:41.240 --> 41:43.240
I

41:46.600 --> 41:48.600
It's harder to get a handle on it again because

41:49.240 --> 41:52.280
People aren't creating knowledge anymore. They're making noise

41:53.240 --> 41:56.120
And that noise does make it more difficult to see the edge

41:57.080 --> 42:02.840
Of knowledge and that's really what's important right? What do we know when we don't know and how well can we describe that edge?

42:04.040 --> 42:05.400
And we are

42:05.400 --> 42:09.880
Academic biology is in a business of not describing accurately that edge and

42:10.440 --> 42:14.440
And pretending that we understand a lot more of what's beyond that edge

42:15.160 --> 42:19.880
Um, then we actually do in fact where we have a vested interest in reducing

42:20.920 --> 42:25.320
The complexity of biology so that we don't have to describe that edge in any

42:25.960 --> 42:29.880
Multi-dimensional way and so therefore we're not really describing the edge at all

42:32.360 --> 42:36.360
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

42:37.160 --> 42:42.680
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie. You know, I don't think I'm a liar

42:42.680 --> 42:48.040
I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar

42:49.560 --> 42:51.560
That's exactly what a liar would say

42:53.240 --> 42:57.560
That's the whole problem here is that we still imagine

42:58.760 --> 43:03.800
We ourselves being honest people that can't lie to anybody or most people can't lie

43:04.520 --> 43:09.160
Without feeling quite bad about it unless it's a complete stranger about a complete nothing burger

43:12.280 --> 43:18.120
And these people have a job they're actors in a way and then you can think of it not really as lying but performing

43:19.320 --> 43:21.320
But this is a performance

43:21.800 --> 43:23.800
Lex Friedman is a performance

43:25.480 --> 43:27.480
Otherwise they wouldn't be where they are

43:28.200 --> 43:30.200
Because we are controlled

43:31.160 --> 43:33.720
By a series of stories and mythologies

43:34.600 --> 43:37.240
that are sustained through a limited spectrum of debate

43:38.200 --> 43:40.200
and that limited spectrum of debate

43:41.080 --> 43:45.080
By definition is not something that exists outside of the actors

43:46.840 --> 43:51.800
So someone like me is never going to be on tucker Carlson. I'm never going to get on jimmy door

43:51.880 --> 43:54.280
I'm never going to get on Alex Jones because

43:55.560 --> 43:58.840
The people that get on those places even those fringe

43:59.400 --> 44:01.880
Places are people that are already vetted

44:03.080 --> 44:07.080
And already accepted as people that will participate in this narrative

44:08.520 --> 44:15.000
And I know that sounds really pessimistic, but I am very pessimistic because the only thing that will save us as individual

44:15.720 --> 44:17.320
Americans

44:17.320 --> 44:21.240
Rising up from their couch rising up from their their desk

44:23.720 --> 44:25.720
And and doing something about this

44:26.680 --> 44:32.040
United non-compliance when the next thing comes and it's coming. I assure you it's coming

44:33.640 --> 44:39.000
And in order for that to happen, I think over the next few weeks we need to get a few things very very

44:39.960 --> 44:41.240
Well put

44:41.240 --> 44:44.520
Like the intramuscular injection statement, but we need a few more of those

44:45.160 --> 44:50.360
We need a sheet of those things that we can use as a basis for our stance on where we are

44:51.160 --> 44:53.800
In pursuit of this restoration of the sacred

44:54.760 --> 44:57.960
But we're arguing with liars and that's not really productive

44:58.840 --> 45:04.760
And so I think rather than engaging with these people who are performing and that's what they are

45:04.760 --> 45:10.840
They're just performers and they might not know they might not want to know. Don't tell me why I'll do it

45:11.880 --> 45:15.000
But they're definitely doing it and most of them

45:15.640 --> 45:17.400
have sent me

45:17.400 --> 45:24.520
Private messages emails or phone messages or phone calls where they have lied to me repeatedly

45:25.560 --> 45:32.840
And that was the motivation for the last year the resentment that I had for a lot of these people and there is no justified resentment in the world

45:34.120 --> 45:36.120
Something I learned over this last week

45:37.960 --> 45:40.920
And that resentment has resulted in me

45:41.480 --> 45:45.400
Feeling despair and that despair being transmitted over the airwaves

45:45.480 --> 45:48.200
And that's not something that I want to do over four channels

45:49.480 --> 45:52.440
And so in preparing for this little expansion into

45:54.040 --> 45:58.680
Peertube and youtube and and rumble and and twitch

45:59.720 --> 46:03.640
I want to be in the right place and the right place is is that I'm not a liar

46:04.840 --> 46:09.480
I've been wrong and I've made mistakes. I've even got a web page called scooby

46:10.200 --> 46:12.200
The details those mistakes

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
But I'm not a liar now

46:16.200 --> 46:18.840
And I'm not interested in calling out

46:19.640 --> 46:24.200
and using my time to give attention to the evil in the world I want to

46:26.200 --> 46:30.600
Be a light somewhere where you come and you feel better after you after you visit it here

46:31.160 --> 46:36.600
Um, I I think the challenge political cut I have on the specialization is always that um

46:37.480 --> 46:42.280
That uh, if you analyze the politics of science the specializations should make you suspicious

46:42.600 --> 46:45.640
It should because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on

46:46.040 --> 46:51.560
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be you know a little bit suspicious

46:51.640 --> 46:56.920
And that's that's uh, that's sort of my starting my starting bias. So I'm suspicious of everyone

46:57.800 --> 46:59.960
I don't trust anybody

46:59.960 --> 47:02.120
And that has served me very well

47:02.520 --> 47:06.200
Um, as I was bitten the first few times in 2020

47:06.920 --> 47:10.840
Um, I started to think this way and uh, I haven't looked back

47:11.560 --> 47:13.960
And in general it has served me well

47:14.600 --> 47:18.920
One of the things that I can tell you for sure is that the people who really need to trust you

47:19.560 --> 47:27.160
Usually start with some kind of personal argument, you know, like we both got kids or how could I possibly be a bad guy?

47:27.160 --> 47:30.840
Because I also lost my job or I also have a family

47:31.160 --> 47:33.960
Who are here's the pictures of of my pets

47:36.840 --> 47:41.160
And these people end up having no skin in the game. They end up having a one

47:41.720 --> 47:45.080
Trick pony kind of story about one thing one focus

47:45.960 --> 47:48.520
And they usually ended up backstabbing me at some point

47:49.320 --> 47:51.320
and these people

47:51.560 --> 47:56.760
Fit into a general category that I like to call team worst case scenario. These people are either

47:57.400 --> 48:01.400
Um, were present very early on and had a very specific focus

48:01.400 --> 48:05.640
Which was usually the spike protein or a gain of function virus

48:06.200 --> 48:09.800
Or a laboratory leak back when nobody wanted it to be a laboratory leak

48:10.440 --> 48:17.960
And at the time one of those primary team worst case scenarios was a group of people on twitter called drastic of which I was a member

48:19.080 --> 48:25.320
And this group of and probably intelligence operatives from various countries outside of the united states

48:25.800 --> 48:29.400
Was designed to stir up this idea of worst case scenario

48:29.960 --> 48:34.440
The idea of flying aids for example originated inside of this group

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
drastic

48:37.240 --> 48:41.320
And so the idea was to see the worst case scenario so that we would get compliance

48:42.280 --> 48:45.640
And so that the coming vaccine technologies would be accepted

48:46.600 --> 48:50.520
And at the time I didn't fully understand that this shift was really to a

48:51.080 --> 48:55.160
To a genetic medicine shift to a sequencing of people's shift to a

48:56.040 --> 48:58.840
eventual personalized medicine shift. I just saw it as

48:59.400 --> 49:04.040
Making sure that people would accept the the transfection when it came out

49:05.000 --> 49:09.160
But very clearly it became much more than that because it also became this thing

49:09.720 --> 49:13.400
Where we were actually seeing people seed a narrative

49:14.200 --> 49:16.360
Of a worst case scenario that involved

49:16.360 --> 49:19.720
Symptomologies and bad outcomes that were were

49:20.600 --> 49:24.280
Later we can see we're easily to be expected from the transfection

49:25.480 --> 49:30.200
And so it's interesting that some of the people on team worst case scenario were very keen

49:30.840 --> 49:32.600
to hype up the

49:32.600 --> 49:34.440
cognitive effects of

49:34.440 --> 49:38.760
SARS-CoV-2 and hype up the myocardial effects of SARS-CoV-2

49:39.400 --> 49:43.320
Two things that we're now very worried about with regard to the transfection

49:43.800 --> 49:45.640
Because transfection is

49:46.200 --> 49:48.840
Very dangerous with regard to protein misfolding

49:48.840 --> 49:54.120
It's regard to where the transfection will occur if you inter to inject intramuscularly

49:54.520 --> 50:01.080
Where ultimately will that that transfection occur it will be in tissues related to the heart related to endothelium

50:02.040 --> 50:04.920
related to tunica media related to these these

50:06.360 --> 50:07.720
again

50:07.720 --> 50:11.960
Symptomologies and potential dangers that were first hyped

50:12.600 --> 50:15.160
by team worst case scenario way too early

50:16.440 --> 50:18.440
When there was only virus

50:18.440 --> 50:25.080
When we couldn't have known anything and when the mass casualty events that were occurring in a few places around the world were the primary

50:25.160 --> 50:27.160
mover of the narrative

50:27.800 --> 50:30.520
And so this coincidence is not a coincidence

50:31.400 --> 50:35.480
That the 24,000 people that died in five weeks in New York City

50:35.960 --> 50:42.360
Coincides with all of these people doing their first act on the internet about a billion people going to die

50:42.840 --> 50:46.040
And about amyloidosis and prion disease being likely

50:49.960 --> 50:54.680
The prion disease and and amyloidosis would have been expected from transfection

50:54.680 --> 50:58.600
We know that from the animals that we've transfected in the laboratory over the last 20 years

51:00.280 --> 51:05.240
And so instead what they got us to focus on with a theater an elaborate theater laughing

51:05.320 --> 51:11.160
at trump behind his back and rann paul arguing with tony fauci on stage in the senate

51:12.040 --> 51:19.320
We got people to think that there was a mystery to solve that we were teenagers that were solving the mystery and that if we unmasked the right guy

51:19.400 --> 51:24.440
Like peter desac or or ralph barrack that was hiding behind tony fauci

51:24.760 --> 51:28.520
We would have all the bad guys on masks and we would have this problem solved

51:30.840 --> 51:34.520
And after four and a half years of chasing this mystery around

51:35.320 --> 51:37.320
Actually none

51:37.720 --> 51:40.200
None of the people none of the people

51:41.480 --> 51:43.480
That know my name

51:43.560 --> 51:46.040
Have ever acknowledged that this screen is correct

51:48.680 --> 51:51.960
None of the no virus people have acknowledged that this screen is correct

51:54.520 --> 51:59.560
None of the people from children's health defense that speak publicly have acknowledged that this screen is correct

52:00.680 --> 52:03.400
none of the people that say that i'm uh

52:04.920 --> 52:10.440
A divider on the internet have acknowledged that well at least he gets this this one screen is definitely awesome

52:11.880 --> 52:14.760
I don't agree with him about clones, but I love this screen

52:17.400 --> 52:19.400
No one

52:22.520 --> 52:29.080
No one will say intramuscular injection of any combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

52:29.080 --> 52:30.360
Who says that?

52:30.360 --> 52:37.320
Robert Malone sasha latipova matt crawford. I mean who are we talking about here? Who says that?

52:39.000 --> 52:43.240
Peter mccullough kind of sort of he says vaccines, but he doesn't say this

52:45.880 --> 52:50.120
I'm trying to think of why it would be that my main message, which is this one

52:52.040 --> 52:56.360
The only consistent message over the last year and a half is the only one that they ignore

52:56.360 --> 53:01.640
No one will repeat it. No one will repeat that

53:01.640 --> 53:06.040
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and they won't explain why

53:07.000 --> 53:08.840
They won't say that well

53:09.320 --> 53:14.440
Who is right about that because you know a transfection is something that we've used on the bench in academia

53:15.000 --> 53:17.880
For 20 years it is something that we knew wasn't going to work

53:18.760 --> 53:21.800
Robert Malone himself said that he let his patents expire

53:21.800 --> 53:29.960
Thank you. He let those patents expire because they didn't really work

53:30.600 --> 53:33.080
That's why he went into DNA and electroporation

53:36.600 --> 53:43.080
And so then when he came out on the Brent Weinstein podcast and didn't really say that it's kind of weird

53:44.360 --> 53:47.800
Because I'm saying it. I've been saying it for three years now

53:48.760 --> 53:50.760
It's transfection

53:51.400 --> 53:54.280
That's not something that Robert Malone needed me to tell him

53:54.600 --> 53:59.720
That's not something that David Baltimore doesn't already know. That's not something that David Hone doesn't already know

53:59.720 --> 54:02.040
That's not something that Cina Bavari didn't already know

54:02.440 --> 54:09.160
That's not something that Tony Fauci or Ralph Berwick or or or probably even even

54:10.120 --> 54:12.920
Peter Dasek they all knew what transfection was

54:14.120 --> 54:19.720
And they knew that the mRNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle even if it's made by the great Peter Kullis is still

54:19.720 --> 54:21.720
transfection

54:22.280 --> 54:25.800
And yet for some reason or another none of them can still find that word

54:26.920 --> 54:32.360
And when they find that word, they're very very very want to actually use it repeatedly. They just say well, I mean

54:33.000 --> 54:35.160
Interestingly enough. I have heard this word

54:35.720 --> 54:37.720
transfection

54:38.120 --> 54:40.120
I

54:47.000 --> 54:49.720
Mean it's really it's really disturbing to me

54:51.240 --> 54:53.400
Because this is a unity message

54:54.520 --> 54:57.160
This is a message that could bring us all together from

54:58.040 --> 55:01.720
from Del to Bobby to Peter McCullough

55:02.680 --> 55:06.600
You know, I mean across the board. This is just very very simple

55:08.040 --> 55:15.960
It calls for a pause on all childhood vaccines in America. It calls for a pause on on the covid nonsense

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
And it aptly expresses this

55:20.520 --> 55:25.880
skepticism very healthy skepticism of the significance of viruses the trackability of viruses

55:26.760 --> 55:31.480
And whether or not we should allow them to diagnose us with a viral infection anymore

55:32.600 --> 55:34.440
All of which I think are

55:34.440 --> 55:40.200
Things that a vast majority of us agree on whether or not we agree on the details of viruses or not

55:40.760 --> 55:46.760
They're definitely not these highly integral, you know, high fidelity

55:48.280 --> 55:52.760
Molecular signals that exist all over in nature, but we just have a hard time growing

55:53.480 --> 55:55.480
No

55:57.720 --> 56:00.120
And so let's just be honest here

56:00.200 --> 56:08.120
I'm trying to cast the widest net possible and most if not all of the actors that social media has put in front of you

56:08.120 --> 56:10.120
Are not interested in that net

56:11.560 --> 56:19.640
And the one organization that claims to be casting the big top net of health freedom is the one organization that fired me in six months

56:20.840 --> 56:24.760
Because I was interfering with their relationships with their partners

56:25.720 --> 56:27.720
Whatever that means

56:28.680 --> 56:32.120
Keep in mind that they hired me when I was podcasting

56:32.840 --> 56:36.280
Keep in mind that bobby hired me for the book because I was podcasting

56:36.600 --> 56:41.800
So it's very strange that without explanation they would fire me basically for podcasting

56:43.560 --> 56:46.760
It doesn't matter because I am blessed to be supported by

56:47.400 --> 56:53.000
Hundreds of viewers in almost hundreds almost hundreds 100 or so viewers like you

56:53.720 --> 57:00.040
Um, and it's it's fabulous. Um because we are going to get this message out. This is the message right here this message

57:00.920 --> 57:06.120
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

57:06.600 --> 57:08.600
That's what you need to say to your

57:08.600 --> 57:12.760
Your your family physician if they don't already know it

57:13.320 --> 57:16.440
That's what you need to say to the school board if they don't already know it

57:17.240 --> 57:21.560
And it's extremely powerful language because no one can misconstrue it

57:22.360 --> 57:28.040
That's why I choose the word dumb. I don't want you to think it's it's it's up for grabs

57:28.120 --> 57:30.280
It's it's beyond the pale

57:30.920 --> 57:33.080
How dumb this assumption has been

57:33.720 --> 57:39.000
And that's why I say it that way. I was just as dumb. I couldn't I can't I still can't believe it

57:41.800 --> 57:45.480
That for the rest of my life. I'm going to wonder if I've damaged my daughter

57:46.280 --> 57:48.280
my sons

57:49.080 --> 57:50.920
And

57:50.920 --> 57:57.480
Every parent if they honestly understand this sacred biology to the extent that they should if they actually appreciate

57:58.280 --> 58:00.280
What they have been given

58:02.120 --> 58:05.080
Then they'll all feel like that and that's okay

58:06.280 --> 58:09.960
Because that humility is what we need in order to reach out to these young adults

58:11.480 --> 58:15.080
Before they instead start to ignore us

58:18.280 --> 58:22.920
And we know why they're doing this right ladies and gentlemen because yeah, they would like less people on the earth

58:22.920 --> 58:25.960
They're not just going to bulldoze everybody or put everybody in a blender

58:30.280 --> 58:36.680
There's information to be had there and as you know the analogy of AI for chess and for go

58:38.200 --> 58:40.200
Is that is that you

58:42.440 --> 58:46.360
You need many iterations of the pattern you're trying to understand

58:47.080 --> 58:52.280
If the pattern is chess if the pattern is go then you need many iterations of that game win or lose

58:53.800 --> 58:57.720
And with the human genome the way that they intend the story

58:58.760 --> 59:03.000
That they have been telling one another the story just like a religion is a story

59:03.480 --> 59:06.360
The story that they've been telling each other for decades now

59:07.640 --> 59:09.640
Is that computers?

59:10.440 --> 59:12.440
Combined with many

59:12.840 --> 59:19.960
Many examples of the human genome are how the human genome the biology of the human genome the biology of dna

59:20.440 --> 59:22.440
And genetics is going to be cracked

59:24.520 --> 59:26.520
And that's why you can find a story

59:26.920 --> 59:30.840
A video of robermalone telling a story about how when he was a grad student

59:30.840 --> 59:34.520
He thought that in 10 years there would be a geneticist at every hospital

59:35.240 --> 59:39.560
Caring childhood diseases using retroviruses because that's the story

59:40.200 --> 59:42.680
That they were telling each other in the hallways

59:43.560 --> 59:46.600
In these virology labs and these genetics labs

59:47.240 --> 59:50.920
And that's the story that they continue to tell each other today

59:56.440 --> 59:59.720
That's the bad idea that spread around the world

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.000
Into all these brains and is much more dangerous than the spread of an RNA molecule

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.680
Which we are told to tell our kids to be afraid of indefinite

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
I

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.680
Please i'm going to ask one more time if you could go sign up at broken science.org. I just want to surprise them

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:24.840
Okay, so if we got 50 people registered on one day and 50 people on the next day and 50 people on the next day

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.840
They'll see it

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.640
And then I can ping emily and say hey did you see a bump in registrations? That's from us

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.680
Because I have the idea that we can work together with broken science and that I can give them something

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.760
They can give me something that we can

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.160
We can join these these groups of people and that's what we really need grass roots

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960
Networking of different truth sources

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480
So that we get ourselves off of the

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.080
The perpetual reliance on things like twitter and facebook thinking that we can

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.720
Tweak the filters enough so that we get something out of it and maybe that was true at some time

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.560
But in the very very near future that will no longer absolutely no longer be guaranteed

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.640
And I think it may be already there

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.600
This is actually jeff glassman

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.600
That's uh

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.680
Greg glassman's dad whoops. I didn't switch that correctly. What did I want to do? Oh this one

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
And then that one

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.600
And so greg glassman calls his dad the science bear

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.800
And jeff glassman doesn't have a lot of publications about these ideas, but he did speak about them at length

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.200
Um, and there's a couple videos of greg telling stories about his dad that I think we're gonna watch in the near future

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.880
um

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.880
But the point is again

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.920
that

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.920
central to the broken science

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.040
idea of of of what science should be and what the creation of knowledge is

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.560
um

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.600
Is at the at the heart of that is a model

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:05.320
A model of your understanding of reality that encompasses all known the data all known

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.080
observations

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.280
And this model is what we should be trying to challenge

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.920
and and

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.920
If we do it earnest in earnest

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800
Attempting to falsify

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.120
That model is in principle not a bad strategy as pauper describes it

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:30.680
But it is the subtle way that that philosophy is ye is is wielded with regard to a null hypothesis and then this other thing

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.960
That we need to understand is fundamentally not model verification

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600
It's something completely different

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.440
and in fact

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.840
that bait and switch between this piperian reiterative falsification of two hypotheses

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.320
Substituted

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.880
Instead right they they put that in place of model verification

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.520
described here by jeff glassman's model rating concept table

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:06.200
Is really the fundamental problem this split is where the mythology was enabled

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.760
That's how virology exists

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.240
That's how infectious disease as we understand it exists

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:20.840
That's how a lot of these misconceptions and neuroscience have come to exist because they're not actually validating their models

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.720
They're testing a binary set of hypotheses, which don't make any further progress in knowledge

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760
but in noise

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:38.280
So i'm going to introduce some of these things slowly over time because um it is also me learning in the background now

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.320
um and trying to formulate my own

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.240
Way of saying these things and so that's why I think watching a couple of the best

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.680
Recent lectures of greg will be helpful will be helpful

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.840
um because greg is very good at speaking at that higher and more

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:01.880
Abstract philosophical level and then bringing it down to to to exact examples as well

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.240
So I i'm really looking forward to the idea of applying this to virology to show how

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.440
this reinterative piperian science

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.440
And p values and publication of peer review

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.920
Can be used to create this illusion of pandemic potential to create the illusion

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:30.760
That the worst case scenario facing us now and in the future has again a function bio weapon that is either leaked or released

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.320
They could kill billions that possibility is a mythology

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.320
That possibility is a story by which they intend to govern us

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.320
More importantly, it is a story by which they intend to invert the sovereignty of our children

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.760
So that our children don't come don't care about

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.440
America anymore because they're a bigger fish to fry

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.760
They don't care about american ideals. They think american is a corrupt system

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.400
That's what they want our children to believe so that they have no vested interest in fighting for it

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.920
We can't allow it to happen. I really like it not to happen

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.640
These bad ideas have got to be stopped if it's not going to happen

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.880
And

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:23.160
These bad ideas spread on social media i'm trying so hard to get off twitter because it's just not good

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.400
It only inevitably shows you a picture that they want you to see

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.480
You have no idea whether your message is getting out no matter what the numbers say no matter what search results you get

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:42.200
And that's by design because the whole idea is to make sure that this is never questioned

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.960
There is an illusion of consensus about this worst case scenario that's not going away

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:55.160
That everybody agrees on from alex jones all the way to the other side of the spectrum that's tony fauci they all agree

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.200
They all agree

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.880
That's because team worst case scenario was highly effective

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:12.680
And that's because most of the people that we actually hear from are not random but members of team worst case scenario recruited

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:19.880
Or encouraged wittingly or unwittingly they're all receiving comfort and fame because they are unwilling

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360
To question the novel virus

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.320
unwilling to question the role of protocols

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:31.720
So you know something about you know, I warn people when I used to work at the young turks

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.440
before they took the 20 million dollars from

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.480
uh dnc donors and became msnbc light and lied to you about

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.040
everything from russia gate

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:50.120
to ukraine war to the syrian war and I and and censorship their pro censorship at the young turks and I warned them

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.120
that uh, you know, it starts with alex jones

01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:00.120
And it's going to come for you. Well, it's not going to come for them because they're never going to go against the establishment

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:06.920
But it's going to come it came for people it went from alex jones and then it went to leading doctors and scientists like yourself

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.440
It went to leading journalists and then it went to former presidents of the united states

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:19.240
So they they can ban anybody and and take away your freedom of speech and of course I was right

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320
And so now they're doing this thing

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.160
Uh with tiktok

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.200
And of course they're doing it. Uh, they're doing it under the now you know something about being censored

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.440
So I want to get your input on this story now

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.920
They're doing this on tiktok and they're saying that they're doing this for national security reasons

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.040
Which is what every dictator always says when he censors

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.440
I'm doing this to keep you guys safe. And so I just want to tell you doc

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.840
Congressman massy is blown the lid off this. It's not what you think it is. This is bible

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.920
This isn't just about tiktok

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:58.040
So the so-called tiktok ban is a trojan horse as congressman massy. He says the president will be given the power

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:05.240
to ban websites not just apps the person breaking a new the new law is deemed to be

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:13.080
Uh the us or offshore internet hosting service or app store not the foreign adversary. So

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.000
Um

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Let me just by the way

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.080
What we're going to have is the hosting services are now going to become censors

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.560
Yes, and so you're so the hosting services now

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.880
Not just the twitter or facebook or your website

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.400
Go daddy is going to become your local neighborhood

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.080
That's right. And so and they're going to give the president of the united states

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.720
The ability to decide

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:47.160
Who is a foreign adversary and who isn't and I wouldn't give this current president the remote for an oscillating fan

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.400
Let alone the cook

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.400
I mean the guy doesn't know if he's looking at a painting or the weather outside his own window

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.520
Somehow he's going to be able to decide what what should be censored in one shouldn't so here it is

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.720
No, that's that's he is just a a paper cut out. He's just a surrogate

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.760
Right and it's iSA. That's going to be running this

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:13.320
It's and they've already showed their true colors. What they're going to do is use this to censor opposition

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.640
That's exactly what this is about and so no too many people

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:23.400
And by the way, I've met massy in person. You probably have to and I just want to give a shout out

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.360
He is a well-trained

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:35.000
Technical expert in his area. He's extremely intelligent. He's not some whack-a-doo-gle crackpot

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.080
Uh, this is this is as I recall. He's my tea train

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.040
This this is a serious

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.160
engineer

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.520
intellect

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.080
Who is looking at what's going on as a patriot in his country

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.960
And is speaking against the approved narrative and it's costing him

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.280
And he is still has the courage to continue speaking out. I think we need to

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.440
So that's why i'm doing it. I'm i'm explicitly recognizing the courage and fortitude

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.560
And intellect of mr. Massey because I respect him people. Uh, I respect him also. He's consistent

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.120
I have certain political differences with him, but I don't ever have to worry about

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.680
He is consistent and he does have integrity and especially around things like this and war which is a big

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.800
Any answers questions. He doesn't run from questions

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.040
And so here is the bill hr 75 21

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:39.240
And it says to protect the national security of the united states from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:51.160
Application such as tiktok and any successor application or service and any other application or service developed or provided by bite dance limited or any

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.000
Entity under the control of bite tent limited but listen to this

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.400
So when they say foreign uh the term foreign adversary controlled application means

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.640
a website

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.400
A desktop application a mobile application

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:17.240
Or augmented or immersive technology application that is operated directly or indirectly including through a parent company

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.640
subsidiary or

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.800
Affiliate

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:27.400
So that means any website. That's what so that means anything anywhere at any time

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.720
It's like grand theft auto with no rules. Yeah, go ahead. Wishback is going to be this is restricted narrowly

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:38.920
That's the way it's being sold is this is one of the most narrowly written bills ever

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.840
Because it's restricted to what was it bite dance the parent company

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.040
Yeah, but then it has this other language in it. This is just the same kind of nefarious stuff

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.800
They're doing with the international health regulations in the world health organization pandemic treaty right now

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.880
Is they'll have language in there that can cut two ways

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.920
And uh, they'll focus on the more benign explanation

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.440
But then you know as soon as this kind of stuff passes

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.840
They're going to flip right around and take the more extreme interpretation and implement

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.240
Of course

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.920
We can't trust them

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.320
That's the problem with the destruction of trust

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:28.040
It's happened over the last four or years and beyond is we now know that we can't give these people an inch because they'll take a mile

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.360
So there's a carve out now. Do you know about that? So let me there's more to this

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080
so

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.080
It shall be unlawful or an entity to distribute for an entity to distribute maintainer update

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.480
Or enable the distribution maintenance or updating of a foreign adversary controlled application

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.160
By carrying out within the land or maritime borders of the united states any of the following

01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:00.360
Providing services to distribute maintain or update such foreign adversary controlled application

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.360
Uh by the by means of a marketplace including an on light mobile application store

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:15.960
Through which users within the land or maritime reporters of the united states may access maintain or update such applications providing internet

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360
hosting services

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.240
To enable the distribution so anybody in anything and here's what mass he says

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:30.520
He says if you think this isn't a trojan horse and we'll apply only to tick tock and foreign adversary social media companies

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.200
Then contemplate why someone thought it was important to get a very specific

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:42.280
Exclusion for the internet based business written into the bill and here's the cutout that you're talking about who it's for

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.720
They say the term covered company does not include an entity that operates a website

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:57.320
Application mobile application or augmented immersive technology application whose primary purpose is to allow users to post product reviews

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:04.120
Business reviews or travel information and reviews. So why do they need to have that cutout?

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.800
It's not for Yelp. It's for amazon's get into that business. I know that that's right. That's for amazon

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.280
That's what that's for you're about to launch their thing where you could do all the stuff the other ones do

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.240
So this guy says so this so here Thomas Massey

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:23.800
This guy says but the bill opens with by foreign adversary controlled applications such as tick tock and any successor

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:33.640
Application or sir and it says bite dance. How is this how is this broader? This guy asked Thomas Massey Thomas Massey says that is window dressing as they say

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.160
Title description whereas clauses are not the operable portions of the bill

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.760
The operable portions of the bill begins with section two

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.080
so

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.080
That so exactly at you just as explained and described doctor

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.960
Is that that's not the point of the part of the bill?

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.800
They're going to use when they go to shut you down. They're going to use the other

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.820
The same trick with the international health regulation

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.960
Modifications and the WHO pandemic treaty the precise

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:12.440
Exact same trick is they throw the happy talk into the preamble and then they get down to business and it's not so pretty

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.440
And

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.880
They're going to get away with anything that we aren't paying attention to so the price of liberty is eternal vigilance

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.400
And a lot of people just go to sleep because they they think well

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.560
I mean the people at the new york times and cnn if there was a problem they would let me know of course not

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.320
Of course they wouldn't of course they all want by the way the new york times the washington post cnn fox

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.400
And msnbc they all want tiktok band why do they want tiktok band because it's a competitor

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:48.200
Just because they want youtube shutdown and they have suppressed independent news on youtube because we're a competitor

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.520
And that's exactly why they want one out of three people in the united states

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.280
Watches tiktok for 90 minutes a day and they're getting their news from tiktok

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.680
And so but the this is a world in which there are multiple truths

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:11.240
All at the same time. There's no question that tiktok is a china propaganda tools a ccp propaganda tool. It's incredibly powerful

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.640
And so we've got a situation of

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920
half truths and and

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.520
You know mixtures of good and bad

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.480
conflicts of interest

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480
All as a great big bra

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.640
And uh, there's no in my mind. There's no question that tiktok

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.200
is

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.480
Um a a a weapon that is

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.600
training our youth

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.920
And uh, it is extremely powerful technology

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:53.240
Is is this really what we we we need to think about how this is speaking deployed who it's having an impact on

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200
the problem is

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.560
It

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:04.760
Is serious, but as soon as as you can see as soon as anybody tries to make a good freight effort assuming this was good bait

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
To address one problem

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.560
It all gets twisted and transformed and exploited to advance

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.360
A variety of corporatist interests were right back at the same place we started

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.520
So I would push back on you about tiktok now this i've been kicked off tiktok

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:29.080
We've been completely censored as is glungly as of you. So I didn't get kicked off because I was criticizing china

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.720
I got kicked off because I was criticizing the united states

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.520
policy in ukraine

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.160
And the united states policy in israel gaza

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.680
So who who got me kicked off china doesn't give a shit

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.240
That who got me kicked off was the cia

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.520
And the intelligence community in the united states which tiktok has bent over backwards

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:57.960
To accommodate and why is that because tiktok is run by a guy from singapore who went to harvard business school

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.480
And he wants to keep his business inside the united states

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.920
So he went to the intelligence community in the united states the cia the nsa the fbi

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:13.240
And they said will censor anything they're they're the most sensitive they're worst in facebook and youtube over at tiktok

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.520
And so they're like will censor anybody at any time for you

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.200
And to say and so that's what's actually happening. So it's the cia that's running tiktok

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:28.440
I wouldn't be so worried about the chinese government because if they wanted to get information on united states citizens

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.720
They can buy it from all the other apps, which is what the government does anyways the united states government

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.120
So they they can get all that data. They could just pay for it if they wanted

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:45.640
So this idea that tiktok's getting unique data that other people don't have it's not that that's i don't i think that's propaganda

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.120
We're gonna send a balloon to my house. What are they gonna do with my data?

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.360
That's right that my government isn't doing to me

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.360
Way worse already. So that's right. So every email

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.960
air argument

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.280
So so that would be my pushback on that and so I wouldn't so

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.800
um

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.200
And I don't think I don't then ch and by the way if china is such an enemy of us

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.320
Why is it that the united states manufacturers have sent all our manufacturing to china?

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:17.480
I can't wait to see when they if they act these maniacs who trying to start a war with russia v visa v ukraine

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.240
I can't wait for these maniacs actually start a war with china

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.480
And then we can't have anything in america anymore because we don't make anything in america

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:32.600
How do you go to war with the country that makes everything that's necessary for your country to run including our viruses now including our viruses

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.800
And our real estate and our nutraceuticals

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.560
And our exactly exactly and they make our medicine right that's what nutraceuticals are

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.280
Absolutely. Yeah

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.400
And if they really were free of the chinese

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.800
Why wouldn't they ban chinese

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.760
Billionaires from buying real estate in the united states and artificially inflating the prices of our real estate here in the united states

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:04.120
So it's out of reach for most home people regular people right now to buy home millennials can't afford to buy

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:09.640
Why because the artificially inflate because they let billionaires buy all the land they want all the property

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.280
They want and those by the way those properties sit empty

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.320
Right. So if I would I would be for banning

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.000
foreign ownership of real estate in the united states of course

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.640
You're never going to get that because the real estate industry has a another corporate capture

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.200
Of our governments and they want it right because it prices everybody makes more money

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.760
So anything um, well, I really appreciate you making time for us today anything

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.240
Any last words you you'd like to say about the the censoring regime that's happening in america and how

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.120
I'm just blown away that I grew up and I thought I was a lefty democrat

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.120
And the democrats have completely flipped they've become pro war

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:56.120
They've become pro censorship anti-free speech and they're not even for bodily autonomy

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.080
They're not pro choice anymore. The democrats are

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.800
Anti-choice they're what they say is their pro abortion. First of all, nobody's pro abortion

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.000
Okay

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.080
People are for keeping the government out from in between a doctor and a patient

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:18.600
And what an abortion has to happen. It has to happen. Nobody's no. Why am I uh, what am I paying attention to here?

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.040
I think what i'm paying attention to is when does robert malone nod?

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:29.960
Sometimes he nods and sometimes he is like just kind of not like this

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.280
Face I don't I don't really know what face it is because he's hard to read but if I was to guess it's kind of like this

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.840
And that face is very contrasted by

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:51.480
And so when you watch him and you see when he's not nodding it's quite interesting actually

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.920
Pro that happening

01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:01.560
But but that's but that's how what that's what they're left with now curd because they can't say pro choice anything in america anymore

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.560
Because we don't make anything in america

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:10.680
How do you go to war with the country that makes everything that's necessary for your country to run including our viruses now including our viruses

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.800
And our real estate and our nutraceuticals

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.640
And our exactly exactly and they make our medicine right that's what nutraceuticals are

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.560
Absolutely. Yeah, so and and if they really were afraid of of the chinese

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.040
Why wouldn't they ban chinese

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:36.840
Billionaires from buying real estate in the united states and artificially inflating the prices of our real estate here in the united states

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.600
So it's out of reach for most home people regular people right now to buy home

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:47.720
Millennials can't afford to buy why because the artificially inflate because they let billionaires buy all the land they want all the property

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.360
They want and those by the way those properties sit empty

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.400
Right, so if I would I would be for banning

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.080
Foreign ownership of real estate in the united states, of course

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.720
You're never going to get that because the real estate industry has a another corporate capture

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.280
Of our governments and they want it right because it rises everybody makes more money

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.840
So anything um, well, I really appreciate you making time for us today anything

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.880
uh

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.320
Any last words you you'd like to say about the the censoring regime that's happening in america and how

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:24.200
I'm just blown away that I grew up and I thought I was a lefty democrat

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:28.200
And the democrats have completely flipped they've become pro war

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:35.640
They've become pro censorship anti-free speech and they're not even for bodily autonomy. They're not pro choice anymore

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.760
The democrats are anti-choister. What they say is they're pro-abortion

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.440
First of all, nobody's pro-abortion. Okay

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.160
People are for keeping the government out from in between a doctor and a patient

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.080
And what an abortion has to happen. It has to happen. Nobody's pro that happening

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:00.840
But but that's but that's how what that's what they're left with now Kurt because they can't say pro choice

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080
Because they all flipped on their value

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.520
When it came to covid and mandates and they took your choice away

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.560
And so now they can say oh, I'm only from pro-abortion, but I'm not pro choice because they're not pro choice

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.720
Would you agree with that doctor?

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.080
I would

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.240
and I have

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.640
Really let's say evolved in my position on abortion also

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.960
I'm convinced that abortion is morally wrong

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:30.120
I'm convinced that particularly after the second month

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.760
That this this is a practice which takes the life of a human being

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.640
but I like you

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.880
have gone on this

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.800
journey of

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.640
discovery and

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.520
and

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.400
Revealing

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.200
Things which I never suspected

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.480
And realizing that much of what I've been taught

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.360
throughout my entire life

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.080
Including one of the first things that I ever encountered as a young person when I was conscious

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560
Which is the assassination of JFK

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.760
I I have as a california native

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.320
Born in Palo Alto raised in the central coast of california

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.840
I've gone on a similar journey as you have as have many people across this country

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.600
And that's the hope of of rfk junior right now

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.720
Is that many of us that once thought of ourselves as

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.760
democrat voters

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.720
Have found ourselves betrayed at the core that the party has left us

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.960
and

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960
much of what

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960
speaking for myself

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:46.280
What I've found is that what I truly believe my core belief system

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.720
Is aligned with what many people now call constitutional conservatism

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.320
the belief that this constitutional document

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.200
Carries with it

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.840
core wisdom and belief and structures that can protect ourselves protect us

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400
from government overreach

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.240
and from all sorts of forms of authoritarianism

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:14.920
And uh, I the other day. Let me just share an anecdote. I was approached by

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.480
Cheryl gay stolbert

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.800
Uh, you know, Cheryl is uh, New York times report hardcore

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.640
Uh dead a lot of their reporting in the medicine field

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.760
And I was uh at the ron johnson testimony recently

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.400
When she approached me

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.680
She's taken a leave of absence from new york times to write a book

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.640
And frankly as soon as I I know her and soon as I saw her I my guard went up immediately

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.000
But one of the first things out of her mouth was that

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.840
Many democrats that she knows are now completely alienated from the party

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.720
And feel that the party has left them

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.920
And they're now searching for a new political home

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.920
much like what you're

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.080
Suggesting and that's when I when you first asked me to come on

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.600
That's what I was told was jimmy door

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.880
Is somebody who has always represented a sick center left position?

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360
And yet he's willing to discuss

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.480
What has gone on with the covet crisis and the jab

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:25.320
And I was really enthusiastic about coming on because you were another one of those people

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.960
who is moving through this transition

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.240
And recognizing that a lot of the stories that you've been told

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.600
Were falsehoods and now we're to this point you and I and many many other people across the country

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.040
particularly of our age group re over certain age

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.440
to of us

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.440
and uh

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.600
We've come to realize that we've been sold a pack of lives

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.280
For a lot of our life

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280
And it's being actively deployed

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.680
Through this what we now call censorship industrial complex

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.200
And it is deep and broad

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080
and what I hear from

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.880
So come special ops people

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.200
uh former

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.560
Psyops

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.000
kernels

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.760
As I toured the country and talk about cyborg is that

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Go ahead. I'm sorry their piss pop

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.000
They're pissed off because a lot of the technology that they worked on for offshore combat

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.480
Has been turned against the american public

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.960
And that's that's the thing that I think matters the most right now

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600
Is we're in the grips of a

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560
a new industry

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.080
Uh as mike bens puts it their mercenaries they will work for the highest bidder

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.520
And the technology is incredibly powerful

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.560
Particularly with the influence of the internet

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.240
They can control everything that you think feel

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.400
believe

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.200
And in that environment when the government is willing to deploy that technology on its citizens

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.880
The idea of fair and free elections

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:16.120
And all the discussion about early voting and electronic ballot machines becomes moot

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.560
So that's pretty extraordinary as a question in the chat

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:26.440
Why is melon promoted everywhere in the likes of mike eden censor to death? It's a great question

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.360
You can find people that say that they're on our side

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.440
And you can find that their paid podcasts are

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:40.040
mike eden and myself and robert melones video is free

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.640
If you don't see that pattern as being a problem

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.200
That's fine. But for me

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.280
If I see somebody

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.480
recording interviews with people and putting mike eden

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:59.080
And jonathan cooey behind a paywall, but robert melone is free

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.360
Meryl nass is free

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.080
Well to me, that's pretty obvious then isn't it

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:12.600
How much more obvious could it be if you had a podcast where robert melones interview was free

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.440
Meryl nass's interview was free, but

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.760
But

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.960
mike eden's interview was paid wall and jonathan cooey's interview was pay walled

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.760
You can see through these people if you choose to

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.360
The problem is is that when you listen to liars lie to you

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.640
It's very easy to trust them. That's their job. That's why they're there

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.440
They wouldn't be there if they weren't already very good at it

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:49.880
People are chosen for their willingness to be good at it for their willingness to lie to play a role

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.320
In the governance of the world to be on the winning team

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.000
That's what these people have been told and there's lots of people

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:03.080
Who have risen through the ranks of social media and in ridiculously high pace

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.360
Have avoided censorship in a ridiculous way or more importantly have been

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.720
promoted while being censored in a ridiculous way that a skilled

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:19.320
Media user a skilled tv watcher cannot see but somebody who's aware

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.040
Of the breadth and the depth of the lying that's going on can see it

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.040
It's not just censorship. It's also false amplification

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.120
It's also

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:38.200
You thinking you're getting your message out when really you're just yelling into a can

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.680
That's what they did to people like me. That's what they've done to people like mike eden

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:51.080
That's what they did to people like wolf gang wodock and that's exactly the opposite of what's happened to people like robert melon

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.120
Even though we are being led to believe and I think that that

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:04.040
Jimmy door is still a little bit naive to the extent to which these liars and the networks of them exist

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.040
and

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:11.560
He's still buying in to the fact that the yin and the yang is fully accessible and that he is just

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.440
You know part of that. It's not true

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:22.200
He is trapped in a limited spectrum of debate and he imagines that this limited spectrum of debate is him

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.200
Escaping the system fighting against it

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.400
When in reality that is the system

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:37.560
None of the controls in the airplane that we are in work

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:43.640
And so although robert melon is sitting in the cockpit

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:51.160
Telling jimmy door. He knows how the plane is flown and he knows what knobs need to be turned in order for us to fly the right way

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:59.480
Jimmy door doesn't know enough about the plane to even understand that there are screens over the windows and those are all leds

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:07.160
Screens that's not a real flying airplane. There are hydraulics underneath there that are making it feel like air turbulence

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:16.280
And so he's there being wowed by by robert melon inside of a simulation of an airplane

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:22.280
Complete with stewardesses and complaining people in the back that can't get the Wi-Fi to work

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.680
And a co-pilot who's in on it

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:32.360
That's the extent to which we have been fooled and so when you get invited

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:39.480
To the cockpit during flight and the airplane is not even off the ground

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.760
You're pretty vulnerable

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:52.520
And that is exactly what you see here. It is it is it is jimmy door being invited from coach

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.480
up to see the cockpit

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.560
And the airplane has not left the ground and he's not aware of it

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:07.960
The people on the plane are not really on a plane. They're just he's not aware of it. The stewardesses are in on it. He's not aware of it

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:15.720
The co-pilot the navigator and the pilot are all in on it and and the guy who's taken him up to the

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.960
To the cockpit because he's friends with the pilot is also in on it

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520
I

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to let this go

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.600
And see if I can start it again after we go to basketball today because I don't know how long

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:34.360
We can do a peer tube straight. So I'm going to stop it now

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.440
I'm going to check that out. I want you to understand that this is a start

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.040
Of an incredibly long commitment to being here every day all the time producing

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.480
Um streams on all four of these platforms to make sure that we get this message out

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:56.040
Has widely and as often as possible. I need your help sharing it if you can I need your help supporting it

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.080
You can find my support links at gigglehomebiological.com. It's very possible

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.000
That I will be on after dinner tonight if i'm not on after dinner tonight

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.520
I will most certainly be on again tomorrow at 1313 eastern standard time

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.760
That's going to be our our

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.560
weekday time that i'm going to try and hit every day and then we're going to have some weekend times

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.880
We're going to hit every day and then we're going to have some optional ones in the evening. That's where we are

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:28.120
Um, thank you very much for joining me. This has been a one hour and 33 minute test

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.800
We'll see what we got on

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.240
On uh peer tube. We'll see what we got on the other channels. I think it went well

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:39.800
Thank you very much for joining me and I will see you again later either tonight or tomorrow at 1313 eastern time

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.040
Thank you very much again

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:48.680
And this has been gigglehome biological and high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.680
It's coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.960
Um, and so it's uh very easy for me to hit stream again. I just got to have the right mindset

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.200
And uh, I want to have the right mindset going forward. We're approaching spring

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:09.480
The spring equinox and so I want to be um out of the truck running by the time the spring equinox comes

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.600
And uh, we're going to establish a new pattern of resistance here. Thank you very much for joining me

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:20.200
Please share my work and you can do home biologicals where you can find me. Um, and I will see you again

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.800
So

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.800
Oh

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.360
I'm so excited ladies and gentlemen, let's check out that peer tube

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.880
And uh, let me know how you find it and whether it works for you or not. Um, it looks like it's just

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:33.560
One oh no, it's two shows and that first one was probably garbage because it's only two minutes long and then the next one

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.640
It looks like it's still live. So uh, yeah, I think we did okay

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.840
We're gonna keep uh fixing that to make sure that we get that working correctly, but I think we're close

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.160
So I think we're very close. Thanks very much. I'll see you soon

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:55.400
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic
