WEBVTT

00:13.697 --> 00:13.777
so

00:45.077 --> 00:50.601
Today we have a very interesting guest.

00:51.821 --> 00:54.723
I'm really excited.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.486
I'm still getting everything set up in the background.

01:15.526 --> 01:16.286
I apologize.

01:16.346 --> 01:21.811
It is really 1010 is a really hard mark for me a me to hit not to be a wimp.

01:23.112 --> 01:26.255
But I need to get everything going kind of while the

01:27.267 --> 01:30.749
The whole school thing is going on in the morning.

01:31.009 --> 01:33.090
And no excuses here.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.950
Well, yes, I'm giving you an excuse.

01:35.010 --> 01:35.891
It's not a very good one.

01:36.931 --> 01:37.972
So 10-10 is tough.

01:38.512 --> 01:41.933
But I think Dan is probably already there and ready to go.

01:41.993 --> 01:43.194
So we're going to make this happen.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.815
And I think it's going to be a very sharp one.

01:51.257 --> 01:52.738
Very, very sharp one.

01:59.411 --> 01:59.475
you

02:46.318 --> 02:52.483
The directed energy weapon attack is indeed something that has risen again on the internet.

02:52.543 --> 02:56.165
Something that I followed a long time ago and then kind of just forgot about.

02:57.106 --> 02:59.327
Crazy how this stuff is all coming full circle.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.209
Yes, Judy Wood.

03:01.229 --> 03:14.058
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:16.218 --> 03:17.759
I think truth is good for kids.

03:18.199 --> 03:22.000
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.141
We want everybody to feel good.

03:24.261 --> 03:26.501
That's not, that's not the way life is.

03:29.002 --> 03:32.923
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:34.724 --> 03:35.444
And I have lied.

03:35.604 --> 03:36.484
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:36.504 --> 03:37.425
I don't want to lie.

03:37.925 --> 03:39.265
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:39.365 --> 03:40.406
I try not to be a liar.

03:40.426 --> 03:41.286
I don't want to be a liar.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.567
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:00.394 --> 04:02.275
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.755
His name is J.J.

04:03.915 --> 04:07.677
Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for C.H.D.

04:08.537 --> 04:10.678
and I believe he has a P.H.D.

04:10.698 --> 04:15.280
in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

04:18.682 --> 04:19.262
The End

04:45.162 --> 04:47.764
Please don't forget the intro may glitch a little bit.

04:50.045 --> 04:55.149
Because depending on when Dan joins the Zoom, sometimes Zoom gets a little goofy like that.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.070
But don't worry, I think the sync will be fine.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.872
I think the sync will be fine.

04:59.932 --> 05:05.335
Just a question of whether I can pull this music out of my... What in the world?

05:05.695 --> 05:06.516
I can hear you.

05:06.916 --> 05:07.657
Yep, you're good.

05:17.805 --> 05:19.366
My daughter put this song in.

05:20.767 --> 05:21.547
It's perfect.

05:23.289 --> 05:29.773
Well, I didn't mean to play this song, so we're going to get a little bit of a strike here on Twitch.

05:29.813 --> 05:31.494
They'll blank this video or this

05:32.950 --> 05:33.650
this audio.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.971
But for now, for the live people, this is great.

05:36.912 --> 05:37.732
Welcome to the show.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.173
This is GigaOM Biological.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.734
We are living through some very interesting times.

05:42.814 --> 05:49.797
And today I think I have a guest that can help us see a side of these interesting times that I myself have never dared to try and penetrate.

05:51.578 --> 05:55.580
Your consciousness is definitely the prime real estate that everybody's working to control.

05:56.613 --> 06:10.354
because it is a matter of what is perceived to be true and these people have dominated the control over that for a very long time, so much so that all of us really don't understand what's going on because we inherited these charlatans from our parents.

06:12.133 --> 06:15.476
And so we know the biology here very well right now.

06:15.516 --> 06:33.433
We know the illusions that we are trying to dispel in terms of the biology, but we don't necessarily, we've never really tried to look into the other illusions where there's a tremendous amount of arguing, being won and lost based on attributing bad motives to the wrong people.

06:33.993 --> 06:37.216
And I think this stream is really going to be important for that.

06:39.747 --> 06:50.111
It is about money and it is about the control of wealth and power and the illusions that are used to make sure that we never really see how this control is being wielded.

06:51.291 --> 06:55.053
But there are more and more people who have been able to see a side of this and also

06:56.073 --> 07:00.834
I think Dan Cohen is one of these people who can also show other people who can't see it.

07:01.574 --> 07:16.958
And these people are critically important to us moving forward together against these people who believe that AI and a bunch of data collection is all they really need to solve all the problems of the irreducible complexity that is our sacred biology.

07:16.998 --> 07:17.958
And that's ridiculous.

07:18.678 --> 07:20.679
And we can't let this history be erased.

07:21.679 --> 07:28.442
And that's what we're trying to do here, trying to take back this power from these charlatans that we've inherited from our parents.

07:29.362 --> 07:31.323
And there's no shame in admitting it.

07:32.403 --> 07:35.164
I want to make gentle the life of this world as we go forward.

07:35.184 --> 07:38.906
I don't want any more of this, what they have done to us.

07:42.150 --> 07:48.513
And so I'm trying to break this wave, this illusion, and I need a lot of help.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.134
This wave is very, very complicated.

07:51.174 --> 07:57.217
You know, at the start of the pandemic, we just thought the wave was composed of some story about a lab leak virus.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.057
It couldn't be that.

07:58.537 --> 08:03.740
And then as we peeled back the layers of the onion, we started to understand this wave was composed of a

08:04.600 --> 08:22.297
a a lollapalooza of liars and it didn't matter what stage you went to you were always going to find the same wave of of of questions that were the wrong questions and answers that were the wrong answers and arguing very very vigorously about these wrong questions and wrong answers

08:22.938 --> 08:26.402
And I think they've been playing this game with us on a number of other fronts.

08:27.623 --> 08:31.687
If you've been here for the first time, you may not be focused on the biology, but you should be.

08:31.707 --> 08:34.810
You may be taking their bait on social media, but you shouldn't be.

08:35.291 --> 08:38.013
And you might not be loving your neighbor as much as you should be.

08:38.073 --> 08:39.655
And so welcome to the show.

08:39.695 --> 08:41.137
This is Giga Home Biological.

08:41.237 --> 08:41.637
We work.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.959
It works because people share the work.

08:44.660 --> 08:49.042
So get out there and share it right now and right after as well.

08:49.843 --> 08:52.624
You can find us at stream.gigaohm.bio.

08:52.664 --> 08:59.308
You can find us on Twitch and also on a soapbox, on Rumble.

09:00.389 --> 09:05.751
The archives are building everywhere now, but I'm most proud of our peer tube, which is the stream.gigaohm.bio.

09:07.072 --> 09:09.134
That's all us.

09:09.574 --> 09:20.083
That's just my family doing that, and a friend of mine on the other side of the planet, a supporter like you, somebody who has done a lot for sharing this.

09:21.644 --> 09:27.028
The paradigm shift is happening right now, and the interesting thing is the paradigm shift is happening on a number of fronts.

09:27.969 --> 09:35.775
Another place where a paradigm shift is happening, I believe, is in this illusion of what Israel is and is not.

09:36.636 --> 09:44.983
And so I'm hoping that my guests can help us pull our hands down and start to engage in a little more informed non-compliance than we're already engaged in.

09:46.505 --> 09:51.309
And make sure you remember, ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga Home Biologically.

09:58.066 --> 09:58.266
do do

10:22.692 --> 10:25.154
Good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:25.234 --> 10:30.339
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:31.339 --> 10:38.766
I normally don't talk about politics or anything related to religion or geography or anything like that.

10:38.866 --> 10:49.415
I'm usually very focused on America and on biology and trying to pull our heads out of this illusion that there's this international war we need to fight against the who and whoever these other people are.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.140
I don't think that's the case, but that's not the subject here today.

10:54.022 --> 11:00.151
Just to remind you though, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

11:00.672 --> 11:04.638
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

11:06.080 --> 11:19.995
Our guest today will not be speaking to us about those things in general, but will instead be giving us some insight into another, what I think, and I don't want to put words in Dan's mouth,

11:21.075 --> 11:35.384
What I think Dan has come to see as another illusion of consensus where there are these two bad arguments that are being made to fight against one another and then maybe there's a third argument that's even dumber, but all of these things are are ridiculous hamster wheels.

11:36.024 --> 11:43.852
that pit people against each other and divide them on a mythology that they're never going to solve because they believe in a mythology.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.694
It's designed to trap them in it.

11:46.995 --> 11:49.898
This is a video from the Jimmy... What does Zionism actually mean?

11:50.078 --> 11:51.600
I thought Zionism meant there should

11:51.920 --> 11:52.941
I didn't do that very well.

11:52.981 --> 11:59.046
This is a video of my guest Dan Cohen on the Jimmy Dore show.

11:59.226 --> 12:03.449
And here he pretty succinctly explains what he sees Zionism as.

12:03.529 --> 12:15.498
And I wanted to start with this clip simply because I didn't necessarily want to have him reiterate everything, but maybe give him a little head start and save his energy for the stuff that we're going to talk about together.

12:16.219 --> 12:18.080
So just listen to this clip really quick.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.082
I'll put myself in the corner and then we'll bring Dan up.

12:22.478 --> 12:28.663
Like what is Zionism actually mean I thought Zionism meant there should the State of Israel exists, but what does it actually mean?

12:31.046 --> 12:43.938
Zionism is a pseudo messianic movement Of course colonial in nature, so it's a European national nationalist movement that emerged in the middle of the 19th century and

12:44.764 --> 12:46.025
mid to late 19th century.

12:46.345 --> 12:59.371
And basically, it was nationalists who thought, well, we are Jews in Europe, and we don't actually really, we don't like Orthodox Judaism, we reject all of that.

13:00.131 --> 13:03.873
We, we need to reinvent Jews as

13:04.983 --> 13:13.646
without God, without religion, all of that stuff and build a new nation, just like there's the French nation or the English nation or whatever, we're going to have the Jewish nation.

13:13.986 --> 13:17.627
So they transformed the religion into a nation.

13:18.567 --> 13:20.088
And so what did they, but they needed

13:21.008 --> 13:23.049
a national mythology.

13:23.589 --> 13:26.249
So they took the logic of Jewish messianism.

13:26.589 --> 13:32.291
Jewish messianism existed for 2,000 years since the temples were destroyed in Jerusalem.

13:32.691 --> 13:44.294
And the whole idea, the reason the temples were destroyed is because these zealots, when the temples existed, rose up against the empire, thinking they're going to have Jewish sovereignty and a kingdom and all this stuff and get rid of everything.

13:45.253 --> 13:50.215
They got smashed, and Judaism basically was largely destroyed and forever changed.

13:50.535 --> 13:52.195
No more animal sacrifice in the temple.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.936
You have rabbis now.

13:54.136 --> 13:54.996
Rabbis are teachers.

13:55.356 --> 14:00.958
Rabbis said, no more messianic activism, no more trying to have a temple.

14:01.058 --> 14:02.759
That will happen when God chooses.

14:03.159 --> 14:08.561
So for 2,000 years, Orthodox Judaism put the genie back in the bottle, more or less.

14:08.621 --> 14:11.442
There were times when it got out, but they got it back in.

14:13.314 --> 14:30.929
Zionism comes around and says, we are going to take this mythology of Jewish messianism, meaning a Jewish state, Jewish sovereignty, a Jewish army, the ingathering of the Jews, that again, should only happen, according to the rabbis, when God chooses.

14:31.009 --> 14:33.471
We can't have any hand in that.

14:34.171 --> 14:37.134
and building a temple on the Al-Aqsa compound.

14:37.574 --> 14:40.376
And the vast majority of Orthodox Jews rejected this.

14:40.436 --> 14:42.158
They said, this is false messianism.

14:42.418 --> 14:43.359
This is dangerous.

14:43.539 --> 14:50.424
And not only that, it draws from the same poisonous well that anti-Semites draw from that attack us.

14:50.845 --> 14:58.691
So they understood, most Jews correctly understood that this was colonial, racist, and it was also completely against Jewish theology.

14:59.389 --> 15:15.744
But Theodor Herzl, the early Zionists, used essentially the early form of an Israel lobby, where they went to Arthur Balfour in Britain, they went to Tsar Nicholas in Russia, both of which were hardened anti-Semites,

15:16.504 --> 15:18.145
The Tsar had committed pogroms.

15:18.185 --> 15:21.106
He had overseen pogroms against Jews in the Pale of Settlement.

15:21.447 --> 15:22.407
And then he meets with Herzl.

15:22.427 --> 15:30.551
So Herzl is basically able to use diplomacy to get support, to get rid of the Jews of Europe, to send them to Palestine.

15:32.182 --> 15:40.126
This whole logic of Jewish messianism continued through David Ben-Gurion, blah, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, all the way to the current day.

15:40.506 --> 15:47.269
Netanyahu, the other day, when he spoke for the first time about October 7, he talked about Joshua bin Nun.

15:47.873 --> 15:51.974
Joshua Ben-Nun is the biblical story of the conquest of Canaan.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.835
The Israelites came and carried out a conquest.

15:56.196 --> 15:57.816
So they believe they conquered that land.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.857
They don't actually believe they're indigenous to it.

16:00.117 --> 16:01.557
They conquered it, therefore it's theirs.

16:01.937 --> 16:06.299
So this messianic language is borrowed, is

16:07.779 --> 16:12.662
taken from Jewish theology and used for nationalist means.

16:13.002 --> 16:16.825
The thing is, it's not like, you know, you just have your Jewish and democratic state.

16:16.885 --> 16:18.906
Well, we showed up there and now we're happy.

16:19.286 --> 16:20.627
No, there's a logic to it.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.469
And it carries on to the point where

16:24.880 --> 16:27.823
Well, we can't have any minorities in Jewish theology.

16:27.864 --> 16:29.706
You have a Jewish state, a Jewish kingdom.

16:29.726 --> 16:30.507
There's no minorities.

16:30.607 --> 16:32.909
That's where Bezalel Smotrych gets this stuff.

16:33.931 --> 16:41.179
It's a dangerous ideology, but it's irrelevant as long as Orthodox Jews don't believe in it.

16:42.612 --> 16:44.133
Well, they don't believe in doing it.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.375
They just believe, well, God will do it at some point.

16:46.495 --> 16:50.919
And we're just going to sit here and twiddle our, you know, study scripture until then.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.382
So, so real quick.

16:54.422 --> 17:05.551
So then the last stage of this is basically what we're entering, where this messianic process goes to, we have to force the Messiah to come through an apocalyptic war called Gog and Magog.

17:06.107 --> 17:09.413
that's what it's known as in, you know, Jewish kind of prophecy.

17:10.355 --> 17:19.070
And that means destruction of the Al-Aqsa compound and construction of a temple so then they can properly worship

17:19.884 --> 17:28.473
God through animal sacrifice, and of course it'll be, you know, a nice way to start a regional or world war.

17:28.713 --> 17:40.786
That is purely the idea of Betsalel Smotrich, of Itamar Ben-Gavir, of all of these religious Zionists, as well as the secular Zionists who are hardcore nationalists who don't believe in any of the

17:41.466 --> 17:42.927
religious kind of gobbledygook.

17:43.487 --> 17:45.348
They just see it as like, yeah, that's our land.

17:45.428 --> 17:48.830
Let's like, you know, yeah, let's get the Palestinians.

17:48.850 --> 17:49.891
Like, let's that's our land.

17:49.911 --> 17:56.154
You said 10% now because we use that 10% pretty much estimating, you know, estimating.

17:56.494 --> 17:57.094
So, okay.

17:57.114 --> 17:58.975
I'm guesstimating that, but they're armed.

17:59.015 --> 18:01.537
But my point is that everyone is lined up behind them.

18:01.637 --> 18:03.357
They are completely running the show.

18:03.598 --> 18:06.919
Just like, you know, Ukraine as, you know, the ads all bites are running the show.

18:06.939 --> 18:07.400
Yeah.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.100
I didn't know that.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.020
OK, so that's enough, right?

18:11.060 --> 18:12.060
I mean, sorry, Dan.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.681
I didn't mean to make you wait so long.

18:15.301 --> 18:15.841
No, that's all right.

18:16.021 --> 18:20.623
I really wanted to make it so that it wasn't so much of an intro here.

18:22.824 --> 18:29.307
So I guess it's a real big picture here, but my hello and welcome.

18:29.347 --> 18:30.447
Now you're finally on the screen.

18:30.467 --> 18:31.267
Wow, nice background.

18:31.307 --> 18:34.369
It looks much better than the brighter yellow that was there before.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.421
You can hear me okay?

18:37.441 --> 18:37.801
It's all right?

18:37.941 --> 18:38.702
Oh no, not very good.

18:38.722 --> 18:39.603
That's better probably.

18:39.783 --> 18:40.784
Yeah, now I hear you better.

18:40.884 --> 18:42.625
Yeah, my face is not bright red.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.448
I got my white balance figured out too.

18:45.688 --> 18:50.812
Well, it's hard to balance a great big yellow background that's very brightly lit though too, so that's good.

18:52.429 --> 18:53.990
I'm really happy that you're here.

18:54.050 --> 19:04.816
We've been in communication on and off for a little while now, because you were also doing some journalism on some COVID related things, including death certificate fraud and this kind of thing.

19:05.756 --> 19:17.883
And so I really like kind of the momentum that brought you to again, touch base, because we've never really actually made anything happen with an article or anything like that yet.

19:18.539 --> 19:38.876
But I really feel as though the big parallels between my finally stepping back far enough from COVID and from the pandemic to see it well enough have finally started to draw parallels from your, or be helpful in understanding your perspective.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.758
I don't know if I'm saying it correctly or not, but

19:41.235 --> 19:45.377
If you have anything to correct in that Jimmy Dore video, please start with it.

19:45.437 --> 19:54.922
Otherwise, I think most of the people in my audience have engaged in some way or another, kind of disconnecting from that story.

19:54.982 --> 19:57.364
So I think an update is appropriate.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.885
I think, you know, just giving you the floor is the best thing I can do.

20:01.078 --> 20:01.298
Sure.

20:02.359 --> 20:03.760
Thanks a lot for having me, Jay.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.382
I'm tremendously honored.

20:07.442 --> 20:13.126
Your work has really opened my eyes in a big way.

20:13.867 --> 20:19.370
I've been on this kind of path, at least during the COVID operation.

20:19.390 --> 20:22.933
It took me a year to even break away from the most

20:24.315 --> 20:33.759
The, the, the most basic of lies, you know, you can go back through my Twitter and find all kinds of embarrassing tweets about we need to lock down and all kinds of things like that.

20:34.679 --> 20:38.760
And it took me about a year to to start to break away.

20:39.081 --> 20:41.822
And the 1st thing that sort of opened my eyes was.

20:43.544 --> 20:48.727
Well, first, I read a Washington Post article about they want private security.

20:48.767 --> 20:55.731
They were calling for private security to forcibly inject people on the street, anyone who wouldn't take the jab.

20:56.952 --> 20:58.333
I just thought that was shocking.

20:58.373 --> 21:07.778
And then really it was the death certificate issue, which that's actually when I first got in touch with Jessica Hockett, who I know you're in touch with.

21:09.859 --> 21:13.483
And she helped me kind of understand that to a degree.

21:14.323 --> 21:30.419
And, you know, then it just kind of snowballed to the point where I started investigating the lab leak story and seeing how that was very much not only the lab leak, but the origin story altogether.

21:32.228 --> 21:40.715
natural origin versus lab leak, false dichotomy, how that had been seeded early on in a very sophisticated way by the national security state.

21:40.895 --> 21:46.259
And myself, you know, my experience is like foreign policy, anti-imperialism.

21:46.559 --> 21:51.163
And so once I started to sort of see that propaganda model and these same old

21:51.943 --> 22:05.616
you know, the same old characters that were seeding that narrative that have been involved in so many other regime change operations and disinformation, it became very clear to me that's what was going on.

22:05.636 --> 22:12.984
I was in touch with Denis Rancourt, and I was telling him, I'm very skeptical of this lab leak narrative.

22:13.024 --> 22:15.006
It seems very science fiction to me.

22:16.727 --> 22:19.529
Do you know anyone who can really open that up?

22:19.569 --> 22:21.011
And he told me to contact you.

22:21.091 --> 22:25.454
So and so, you know, you and I, as you said, have been talking for months at the same time.

22:26.835 --> 22:37.204
One of my subjects of I don't I hate I hate the term expertise, I guess intrigue is Israel, Palestine have been that was where I started in journalism back in 2014.

22:37.504 --> 22:40.066
And it's kind of a big focus of mine.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.949
So, you know, even that Jimmy door clip, my my

22:44.930 --> 22:56.218
my analysis of what Zionism is has been, I've refined it significantly since, I mean, I guess that was about six or seven months ago that we recorded that, that I appeared on his show.

22:57.319 --> 23:03.804
And a lot of it is correct, but there's a few things that are a little bit mixed up, that are not totally clear.

23:03.824 --> 23:03.884
But

23:06.625 --> 23:19.508
Before I get into that, I think the relevance of why should we even talk about Zionism on a show where you discuss biology on a daily basis.

23:19.548 --> 23:22.229
These are the same animal.

23:22.349 --> 23:26.090
We are dealing with one big system that is

23:27.580 --> 23:28.260
inseparable.

23:28.861 --> 23:41.446
And if we stay kind of siloed in our respective subjects of intrigue, then we're not going to be able to really see the bigger picture.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.568
So all of this stuff is very closely related.

23:44.588 --> 23:47.749
You know, I'm wearing my Fives Rail shirt.

23:48.009 --> 23:48.269
Nice.

23:49.850 --> 23:51.370
You know, so that is yucky, man.

23:51.591 --> 23:52.391
It's a nice shirt.

23:52.471 --> 23:54.371
It's funny, but it's also terrifying.

23:54.431 --> 23:55.372
I mean, exactly.

23:55.452 --> 23:58.253
It's hard to laugh at it without realizing how macabre it is.

23:58.973 --> 23:59.493
Exactly.

23:59.593 --> 24:05.375
So so, you know, I mean, this this really encapsulates how how much it's really one system.

24:05.435 --> 24:11.917
So I guess, you know, I see what I learned through my investigation of the

24:12.972 --> 24:26.678
of the origins narrative and listening, you know, talking with you and examining your work, is how there is a false dichotomy, a false binary that is

24:28.439 --> 24:40.827
basically given as propaganda to the masses so we can stay inside a certain paradigm that is, you know, precisely where our elites, our ruling class want us to stay.

24:40.947 --> 24:46.091
And that's certainly the case with the COVID origins narrative.

24:46.811 --> 25:08.336
and is very much the case, I've realized, in recent months, with Zionism, to the point where, you know, I had a viral tweet on, like, October 7th or October 8th at some point, saying, I'm Jewish, I'm a Jewish guy, I had my bar mitzvah in Israel, and I 100% support Palestinian resistance.

25:08.816 --> 25:13.337
Now, obviously, it's controversial, you know, but it went massively viral.

25:14.935 --> 25:21.637
And, you know, some people may take offense to that, but I spent seven months in the Gaza Strip in 2014, 15, 16.

25:21.878 --> 25:24.318
I made a documentary called Killing Gaza.

25:24.679 --> 25:26.439
For me, it was like being in the Warsaw Ghetto.

25:27.440 --> 25:33.722
And so, you know, when I saw October 7th happen, I see it as an act of liberation.

25:34.082 --> 25:35.422
The inmates escaped.

25:37.245 --> 25:41.086
the prisoners escaped, the concentration camp inmates escaped.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.568
And, you know, it showed me that liberation is possible.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.009
And that's still how I see it to this day.

25:47.529 --> 25:50.070
And we may not like exactly how it happened.

25:50.190 --> 25:51.110
And even though there's still

25:54.229 --> 26:00.052
not enough clarity of what exactly happened in certain parts of that, which is beyond the scope of this conversation.

26:01.092 --> 26:07.615
The point of that is my tweet was about, it made this whole thing about being Jewish.

26:08.536 --> 26:14.819
And my name is Dan Cohen, obviously I'm from a Jewish background, if anyone can't figure that out.

26:16.600 --> 26:22.863
And so I grew up in a secular Jewish household in a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.

26:24.085 --> 26:38.488
and um the thing is in the same way basically the concept is in the same way that we are given this false binary of lab leak versus

26:39.577 --> 26:48.083
natural origin, we are given this idea about Israel and Zionism that it's like a Jewish debate.

26:48.803 --> 27:08.837
So, when I tweet on October 7th that I'm Jewish, and this is my position on the whole thing, or someone who is pro-Israel says, well, I'm Jewish, and here's my position on the whole thing, then it becomes just an intra-Jewish debate, when that's not fundamentally what it's about, because

27:09.677 --> 27:12.779
Zionism, for one thing, is not Judaism.

27:12.879 --> 27:15.660
I sort of explained it in that concept.

27:15.740 --> 27:18.862
Zionism is nationalism.

27:19.222 --> 27:30.328
It's a European nationalist concept that just took Judaism, emptied it of all of its meaning, anything religious, anything of the real

27:31.862 --> 27:39.446
of the actual definition of Judaism and made it into a nationality, and really a race.

27:40.466 --> 27:46.769
A lot of people will say, who are critical of Zionism, myself included, I've said this in the past, that Zionism is Jewish supremacy.

27:47.557 --> 27:59.870
Well, Zionism is only Jewish supremacy if you accept the Zionist definition of a Jew, which is not a religious person, but is a race.

28:00.470 --> 28:06.096
And so, therefore, we are accepting, by saying that, we are accepting the premise of both Zionism

28:07.277 --> 28:15.141
which sees Jews as a superior race and of anti-Semitism, of Nazism, which sees Jews as an inferior race.

28:15.582 --> 28:21.925
They have that in common where they, neither of them see it, what it actually, the real definition of a Jew, which is a religion.

28:23.365 --> 28:28.588
And, you know, if you're, if you don't believe in, you know, people say there are atheist Jews.

28:28.648 --> 28:30.129
How can you be an atheist?

28:30.369 --> 28:32.210
How can you be a Jew if you don't believe in God?

28:32.730 --> 28:34.431
It's just, it's, it's totally absurd.

28:34.551 --> 28:35.852
So, um,

28:37.672 --> 28:50.522
So basically, as long as you, as we believe in this, how many people, how many people in Israel would disagree with the idea that Judaism isn't a religion and not a race?

28:52.264 --> 28:53.425
would disagree with that?

28:53.845 --> 28:56.787
So how many people think it's really a religion and not a race?

28:56.807 --> 28:58.288
No, I'm sorry that I asked it wrong.

28:58.328 --> 29:02.751
I mean, how many people would actually argue that, no, it is a race?

29:03.992 --> 29:06.053
That's the point, or something like that.

29:06.093 --> 29:08.275
That's really a Zionist exclusive thing?

29:09.335 --> 29:15.820
Because people trace their Jewishness in America through their mom.

29:16.441 --> 29:18.823
They say, because my mom was Jewish, I'm Jewish.

29:19.503 --> 29:20.544
I mean, they all do it.

29:20.564 --> 29:22.146
But that's only a religious concept.

29:22.166 --> 29:25.808
That's only according to the Jewish religion.

29:26.429 --> 29:35.737
So if you're not a religious person, then if you don't practice the religion, if you don't believe in the religion and the theology,

29:36.437 --> 29:47.663
then why would you, you know, if you don't believe in God or you don't do any of that stuff, then you don't believe that you're, you know, that because my mother was Jewish, then I'm Jewish.

29:48.703 --> 29:53.226
So that's part of how the religious concepts have been taken and sort of and racialized.

29:53.546 --> 30:03.171
I mean, I was taught in my reform secular synagogue growing up as a teenager, like a young teenager, that Judaism is a religion and a race.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.855
which is a very dangerous concept.

30:07.015 --> 30:19.842
It's crazy to me that people think that, but I don't think there's really not another religion that people think of as a secular Jew or an atheist Jew.

30:19.882 --> 30:25.906
If you're not a practicing Catholic or a Muslim, then you're not a Muslim anymore, and that's okay.

30:26.146 --> 30:26.646
It's fine.

30:26.907 --> 30:30.829
You mean there's no such thing as an atheist Muslim?

30:32.281 --> 30:33.162
Have you ever heard that?

30:33.282 --> 30:34.323
I mean, people talk about.

30:34.703 --> 30:35.424
Yeah, exactly.

30:35.704 --> 30:40.229
It's like it's a total it just doesn't make sense at all.

30:40.329 --> 30:50.078
So but we're supposed to think that is true about Jews and that lens and that is based on a racial concept, which is, of course, phony.

30:51.560 --> 30:51.780
So.

30:53.502 --> 30:54.302
All this to say.

30:55.646 --> 31:11.355
Basically, American, because Western Jews, a lot of us are secular, myself included, who were raised with this idea that I'm Jewish, but not in a religious way.

31:11.475 --> 31:12.175
I'm secular.

31:12.576 --> 31:14.177
I live a secular lifestyle.

31:15.077 --> 31:23.681
I don't observe the Sabbath, I don't wear a kippah, any of these things, then Judaism is just an identity.

31:24.361 --> 31:34.145
And therefore, if we can debate all day about, you know, should Israel do this?

31:34.185 --> 31:35.545
Should Israel do that?

31:35.605 --> 31:41.348
But if you abandon the whole concept of Judaism as a race,

31:42.168 --> 31:49.458
or a nationality or an ethnicity or or any of the things it is not it's none of those things it is only a religion then

31:52.284 --> 32:00.708
You basically, it's almost like you're playing tug of war, and the other guy wants you.

32:01.149 --> 32:01.849
They want you.

32:01.929 --> 32:04.470
Zionists want us to play tug of war with them.

32:05.031 --> 32:09.973
But the real way to win is to just let go, and then the whole thing falls down.

32:10.554 --> 32:14.636
So you have, for example, you have pro-Israel Jews.

32:15.556 --> 32:29.684
uh... who are who say you know what israel's doing and gaza is justified because of security threats and threats to the jewish people and cetera cetera even though and their and they're accepting the false definition of jews as a nation or a race

32:32.366 --> 32:41.311
Benjamin Netanyahu is the prime minister of Israel, so by Zionist definition, he's basically the leader of the Jews, but he's not religious at all.

32:42.251 --> 32:48.615
He's one of the most Machiavellian figures in all of politics, and he cheats.

32:49.455 --> 32:50.716
He doesn't keep the Sabbath.

32:50.816 --> 32:52.957
He's a total sinner.

32:54.838 --> 32:56.219
So they accept this definition.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.363
And then on the other side, you have like what I tweeted on October 7th.

33:00.423 --> 33:12.013
Well, I'm, as a Jew, you know, basically saying, as a Jew, I reject this, but I'm playing into this idea that Israel is, and Zionism, are a Jewish question.

33:13.494 --> 33:25.841
Or, you know, the other side of another side of the debate is you have groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, which is one of the kind of prominent sort of anti-occupation groups here in Washington.

33:26.562 --> 33:35.967
And, you know, and they have, like, tons of young college-educated, you know, kind of young left-wing Jews who all say, you know, not in our name.

33:36.107 --> 33:40.409
We oppose what Israel is doing as Jews.

33:41.109 --> 33:41.610
And really,

33:42.290 --> 33:44.772
you know, Israel has nothing to do with Judaism.

33:44.872 --> 33:46.493
It's a nationalist concept.

33:46.573 --> 33:56.100
It's a nationalist ideology, Zionism is, that took Judaism and emptied it of all of its meanings and then filled it with something completely different.

33:57.541 --> 34:07.649
And so as long as, you know, we're playing into one of those three, you know, you can have any number of different opinions.

34:08.772 --> 34:37.366
as long as you believe that zionism is judaism whether you're a raging anti-semite who thinks you know look what israel's killing all these uh... poor people that's why we have to get rid of jews or you can set you know any of these opinions uh... fall within the confines of what they want us to believe about zionism and israel if you actually take a real uh... honest approach and say no this is not the religion you know you have

34:39.403 --> 34:42.646
traditional religious Jews completely reject Zionism.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.067
It is the worst sin for them.

34:45.828 --> 34:48.851
They see it as I said in the door hit false messianism.

34:48.911 --> 34:58.298
They see it as an actual impediment to the coming of the Messiah to this, you know, supernatural, you know, belief happening.

34:58.959 --> 35:01.861
So, so the parallel

35:02.856 --> 35:12.708
is again that as long as we're playing tug of war and the rope is this is a Jewish issue, we're never going to actually win.

35:13.029 --> 35:15.272
We're playing their game.

35:15.812 --> 35:17.795
The same way that as long as we're debating

35:19.585 --> 35:28.027
Did it come from a lab, or did it come from a bat in a cave in southern China, or something else?

35:28.047 --> 35:29.227
Did it accidentally slip out?

35:29.267 --> 35:34.129
Was it released by the CCP intentionally in some military?

35:34.709 --> 35:39.710
Any of that stuff, it all is within the confines of what they want us to think.

35:39.810 --> 35:43.511
So it's really just about kind of liberating ourselves from

35:44.608 --> 35:51.292
PSYOPs, and then seeing that this is the same big system.

35:51.332 --> 35:53.594
There's a reason that Israel

35:54.634 --> 36:05.459
was what a Pfizer exec called a laboratory for their products.

36:05.479 --> 36:10.501
There's a reason that Israel was selected for the Green Pass.

36:11.002 --> 36:18.845
And with that Pfizer agreement, they were given all of the private data of all these people, of all of its citizens who participated in this.

36:21.229 --> 36:23.351
I mean, I can, you know, expand on that a little bit.

36:23.371 --> 36:23.711
I don't know.

36:23.791 --> 36:27.234
But, you know, so so to me, it's all about like.

36:28.936 --> 36:41.707
Disassembling the psyops, getting it right from the it's almost like, you know, if you don't if you don't know what one plus one is, everything else, if your foundation is off, everything else in your analysis.

36:42.765 --> 36:43.445
is going to be off.

36:43.725 --> 36:51.887
If you believe that a PCR test, a positive PCR test, means you have COVID, everything else is going to be off.

36:52.267 --> 37:05.150
If you believe that Israel or Zionism is Judaism, as even myself, an anti-Zionist, expressed on October 7th, everything else in your analysis is going to be off.

37:05.230 --> 37:07.371
So that's basically the idea.

37:09.583 --> 37:17.267
It sounds a bit like you are sort of also feeling a little regret for not having seen it earlier.

37:17.347 --> 37:27.593
I mean, that's also, you know, part of the thing that I find disingenuous about a lot of the people that are on television talking about either COVID or Israel is that they know everything.

37:27.753 --> 37:29.494
They're absolutely sure they're right.

37:29.574 --> 37:33.856
They've been right from the beginning and obviously, obviously, obviously.

37:35.097 --> 37:40.644
So we can throw out the idea that October 7th was just a spontaneous security breach.

37:41.205 --> 37:50.957
You don't have to comment too much, but I think a lot of people already were like, how do you have that drone footage if, you know, like, I mean, all this stuff just seems so bizarre.

37:51.838 --> 37:53.761
You know, paragliders, this kind of thing.

37:56.108 --> 38:07.236
versus reaction because that was one of these other false kind of mini false debates like maybe early treatment was in COVID that, you know, we have to debate about how bad was October 7th.

38:07.336 --> 38:10.639
Are we really sure that this didn't happen or that didn't happen?

38:10.659 --> 38:13.060
Because if those things happen, then this is okay.

38:13.681 --> 38:18.624
And so we were running in hamster wheels there on the media as well.

38:18.764 --> 38:23.288
At what, I mean, do you see Gaza as kind of a thing where

38:26.418 --> 38:31.640
I'm trying to think about how the United States is participating or not participating in this.

38:31.740 --> 38:38.263
Are we just letting it go or are we also getting something out of this?

38:38.483 --> 38:41.484
I mean, we must be able to watch everything they're doing or not.

38:41.524 --> 38:43.045
Can we watch everything they're doing?

38:43.085 --> 38:45.166
Does the American government in your mind know

38:46.528 --> 38:50.050
everything that's going on in Gaza, even the stuff that's not being reported?

38:50.110 --> 38:51.630
Are they keeping track of everything?

38:51.690 --> 38:55.992
Or is it an impenetrable laboratory controlled by the IDF?

38:56.032 --> 38:56.733
How do you see that?

38:59.854 --> 39:08.358
I mean, I think, you know, I don't know exactly to what degree of granular detail the U.S.

39:08.938 --> 39:11.219
knows everything that's happening in Gaza.

39:11.859 --> 39:15.881
But I mean, they know what's going on overall.

39:16.483 --> 39:16.705
I mean,

39:20.592 --> 39:20.972
The U.S.

39:21.032 --> 39:23.873
is completely responsible for what's going on.

39:23.913 --> 39:27.114
I mean, without U.S.

39:27.134 --> 39:30.254
support, Israel would not be able to do what it's doing at all.

39:30.274 --> 39:37.716
I mean, the vast majority of the bombs Israel is dropping on Gaza are manufactured here in the United States.

39:38.136 --> 39:44.238
All of the political support, all the diplomatic support, all of the vetoes at the U.N.

39:44.278 --> 39:48.299
Security Council for ceasefire resolutions when, you know, the rest of the

39:50.419 --> 39:56.485
permanent members, the UN Security Council was in support of it, or at worst, abstained.

39:56.545 --> 39:59.308
The US was the only one that blocked the resolution.

39:59.808 --> 40:05.334
So if Biden today wanted to call Netanyahu and say it's done, it would be done.

40:05.354 --> 40:05.974
That would be it.

40:06.335 --> 40:07.876
So it really comes back to

40:09.257 --> 40:10.439
to the U.S.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.181
and the U.S.

40:13.662 --> 40:22.271
basically has ceded its leverage, all of its leverage to Israel for a number of reasons.

40:22.631 --> 40:23.732
I think, you know, I think that

40:25.114 --> 40:27.457
I mean, of course, there's, you know, the Israel lobby.

40:27.718 --> 40:36.631
You can read the great book by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt that talks about, that basically shows how the Israel lobby operates.

40:37.132 --> 40:38.815
There's an excellent film that was

40:40.711 --> 40:47.336
produced by Al Jazeera investigations, and then they tried to squash it.

40:47.516 --> 40:55.261
They tried to censor it and not release it, and then it made its way to daylight with an outlet called the Electronic Intifada.

40:55.301 --> 41:01.465
That shows total Israeli interference in U.S.

41:01.646 --> 41:04.387
politics from basically all levels.

41:06.022 --> 41:10.524
But I think, you know, so the Israel lobby is not a big secret.

41:10.804 --> 41:17.887
I think there's sort of an ideological aspect that hasn't really been discussed a lot, and I don't even think I've talked about.

41:19.747 --> 41:26.210
You know, Gaza, for me, I mean, you basically have two and a half million people

41:27.284 --> 41:45.310
who are not of what Zionists consider the Jewish race and so were ethnically cleansed from their villages back in 1947-1948 into this area which at the time was behind the Egyptian army lines and

41:46.810 --> 41:53.454
Once again, they've been attacked, and over the decades, they've been basically penned in.

41:55.235 --> 42:04.601
Originally, barbed wire was slated to be put up around them, and now it's turned into this total dystopian

42:07.731 --> 42:30.638
system where you have people living behind various layers of walls and security and cameras and all kinds of sensors, the most high-tech sensors, and if they try to get out, they will be shot by either a sniper on site or they will be shot by remote control machine guns manned by an all

42:31.158 --> 42:33.846
female team in an underground base miles away.

42:33.886 --> 42:35.430
And I've seen these things shoot at people.

42:35.491 --> 42:38.138
You know, I've spent a lot of time in this place, so I know it intimately.

42:41.075 --> 42:43.757
You have two to three hours of electricity per day.

42:44.537 --> 42:47.800
When you turn on your sink, you get salt water.

42:48.580 --> 42:51.062
The aquifer has been ruined.

42:52.343 --> 42:54.104
So life is atrocious there.

42:54.364 --> 42:55.705
At any point, you can just be killed.

42:55.765 --> 43:06.232
There's a constant hum, a chorus of drones over your head at any time, which are carrying warheads, and they can just kill anybody.

43:06.272 --> 43:07.733
At any point, there are F-16s.

43:07.753 --> 43:08.954
There's zero sovereignty.

43:08.994 --> 43:10.335
I mean, you are just a complete,

43:11.515 --> 43:20.820
non-person, non-human to this entity that controls every aspect of your life and can extinguish it with the flick of a button at any moment.

43:20.880 --> 43:28.704
And so I think, you know, it's not really about fundamentally, it's not just about Palestine.

43:28.804 --> 43:32.826
This is the vision that they have for all of us.

43:33.426 --> 43:39.670
So any surplus population or any unruly population can basically be ghettoized

43:40.650 --> 43:43.412
and if they resist, can be exterminated.

43:44.533 --> 43:46.655
They can use them for testing weapons.

43:47.055 --> 43:50.898
They can use them for testing pharmaceutical products.

43:51.218 --> 43:55.261
They can use them for anything they want.

43:56.582 --> 44:00.325
And so I think one of the reasons our politicians here in the U.S.

44:01.005 --> 44:09.592
are so incredibly committed to Israel and say, oh, we love Jewish people so much, is because it gives them an excuse

44:11.095 --> 44:25.177
it gives them a cover to implement this kind of system at home, where we saw lockdowns, we saw people punished in all kinds of arbitrary and crazy ways.

44:26.578 --> 44:31.919
It's like a lust for power.

44:33.119 --> 44:37.960
For example, Julian Assange, I think in the early 2000s,

44:42.394 --> 44:45.875
Hillary Clinton said about Julian Assange, can't we just kill him with a drone?

44:46.335 --> 44:47.876
Can't we just take him out with a drone strike?

44:48.336 --> 44:52.277
And this is like exactly what happens in Gaza.

44:52.317 --> 44:58.138
Joe Biden called Julian Assange a high-tech terrorist, meaning he wants to kill him.

44:58.178 --> 45:00.339
I mean, a terrorist, you know, we kill terrorists.

45:00.479 --> 45:01.499
We don't put them on trial.

45:02.839 --> 45:04.700
So this is

45:06.317 --> 45:15.714
this dystopian future you know the palestinians are kind of the canary in the coal mine and the way they are able to implement this kind of

45:17.385 --> 45:20.228
System is it's not going to look exactly the same.

45:20.268 --> 45:20.648
Of course.

45:20.748 --> 45:22.730
You know, we have we have a country of what?

45:23.211 --> 45:23.811
350 million people.

45:23.851 --> 45:34.480
We're not all going to be, um, you know, rounded up and stuffed into into, you know, one tiny little area, but they're gonna they want to Segregate and ghetto wise different populations.

45:35.141 --> 45:36.622
Um, populations that resist.

45:37.403 --> 45:38.704
Um And

45:39.725 --> 45:43.367
strip away our rights, our individual freedoms.

45:45.228 --> 45:52.531
And then, you know, the way they're able to do this is by this.

45:52.671 --> 46:03.356
I think the reason that Zionism and Israel are so perfect for this is because it gives them a moral cover.

46:03.456 --> 46:07.278
You know, they can say, well, because of the Holocaust, we have to have

46:08.257 --> 46:10.138
You know, we have to support Zionism.

46:10.738 --> 46:13.479
That's what the Germans, you know, the Germans are huge support.

46:13.519 --> 46:26.163
Germany is a huge supporter of Israel, provides it nuclear weapon armed submarines, for example, has given it all kinds of military and diplomatic support throughout this whole Gaza slaughter.

46:26.883 --> 46:35.728
So they can always say, oh, well, the Jews have been through so much, and after the Holocaust, we have to support the Jews, and all of these things.

46:35.768 --> 46:41.552
And you'll see this incredible virtue signaling.

46:41.672 --> 46:51.178
When Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, he was given the Genesis Award, which is basically a big Zionist award, and this big ceremony in Israel.

46:51.758 --> 47:06.742
They had this video of Jews in the concentration camps in Nazi Europe, and then this kind of montage of them being liberated and founding the State of Israel, which is total mythology.

47:07.543 --> 47:16.785
But this is like the ultimate sort of moral cover because of what actually did really happen to Jews.

47:21.650 --> 47:34.297
Joe Biden can say, well, I'm a Zionist, and use that moral cover, or Hillary Clinton, or whoever, when in fact, what they are doing is the opposite of anything that's good for Jews or anyone else.

47:38.319 --> 47:48.365
It gives them Zionism, how it exploits Judaism, and Jewish persecution gives this system

47:49.660 --> 47:54.682
of kind of global governance, a perfect sheen of moral authority.

47:55.942 --> 48:15.990
Can I just throw this out there because I didn't want to play the clip because I don't like to go there, but the only other person that says it this well in my estimation and said it a long time ago, I mentioned this in an email, is actually somebody that a lot of people just think is nuts, which

48:17.225 --> 48:27.836
It begs the question to me, maybe they let him say it all those many years ago to make sure that people would associate the idea of Zionism not being Judaism as nuts.

48:28.717 --> 48:29.678
And this is David Icke.

48:29.798 --> 48:34.603
David Icke has been saying basically that the victim of Zionism is

48:37.250 --> 48:46.376
the real Jewish people, and yet somehow or another, the only one who's been able to articulate it before the pandemic and many years before the pandemic is somebody like him.

48:46.916 --> 48:54.041
Do you think that they're showing us Gaza so that we are unaware of our own predicament in some ways?

48:54.161 --> 48:59.125
Is this, because they show it every night on the PBS NewsHour, and it is relentless.

49:01.671 --> 49:03.892
I find it just, it is extraordinary.

49:04.012 --> 49:09.495
For me, I thought that after October 7th, there would be some two week thing.

49:10.155 --> 49:15.198
I don't know how, it seems like we're going an awful long time after that.

49:16.118 --> 49:17.639
So clearly this is not,

49:19.239 --> 49:24.562
Somebody in my chat asked about Max Blumenthal and Aaron Mathe.

49:25.222 --> 49:26.843
Are you familiar with these two guys?

49:26.903 --> 49:28.304
I know you worked with Max before.

49:28.344 --> 49:31.065
Can you just speak to those two guys a little bit?

49:31.105 --> 49:32.006
How are they doing?

49:34.479 --> 49:38.842
Yeah, I mean, I used to be extremely close with Max.

49:38.922 --> 49:41.304
I made the documentary Killing Gaza with him.

49:43.425 --> 49:48.009
And we had a personal falling out, which I've sought to resolve.

49:49.009 --> 49:52.732
But politically, I mean, I think he's he's sharp.

49:53.213 --> 50:00.278
I, you know, since I've kind of clarified my understanding of Zionism and Judaism and an even

50:02.747 --> 50:22.324
more sort of distinct way than I did before, I do see prominent anti-Zionists like Max and others using this term Jewish supremacy, which I'm critical of because it, as I said before, accepts the Zionist and anti-Semitic definition of Judaism as a race.

50:22.685 --> 50:26.588
Because, you know, if it were Jewish supremacy, then real

50:28.215 --> 50:39.063
supremacy based on actual Judaism, then you'd be afforded privileges based on how religious you are, when in fact, it's purely for belonging to this supposed race.

50:40.204 --> 50:46.209
But nonetheless, you know, I mean, I very much respect Max and Aaron, both of their journalism.

50:46.229 --> 50:47.670
Wow, it's just never, it dawned on me.

50:47.710 --> 50:48.891
Now, thank you for that answer.

50:48.931 --> 50:51.693
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't skip that question in the chat.

50:51.713 --> 50:52.674
Sure, sure.

50:54.255 --> 51:02.641
It never dawned on me, you know, there's this book, The Bell Curve, and that book actually also, by reading it, you just assume that, okay, so I guess I've accepted it.

51:03.737 --> 51:07.859
Jew is a race, and so we can measure the intelligence of the Jewish race.

51:08.159 --> 51:14.022
I see that very clearly now, at least in your model and your paradigm.

51:14.062 --> 51:16.443
It makes sense to see it that way.

51:16.963 --> 51:22.406
That's why that book was written in the first place then, or at least one of the overarching goals of that book.

51:22.566 --> 51:24.587
Do you see that too, or no?

51:25.347 --> 51:25.928
That's cool.

51:25.948 --> 51:27.350
Yeah, I mean, I never read it.

51:27.410 --> 51:39.484
But to me, it's it's just shows how like everything even even, you know, anti Zionists like myself and I, you know, I mean, I was on the Jimmy Dore show talking about, you know, to tens of thousands of people talking about

51:40.325 --> 51:47.091
what is Zionism after several years of journalism and studying the whole concept.

51:47.712 --> 51:56.259
And even I was promoting Zionist propaganda, you know, so it just goes to show that Zionist propaganda is so incredibly pervasive.

51:56.860 --> 52:06.808
And unless we have very specific, clearly articulated definitions of what is Jew and what is Zionism, you know, just like,

52:07.569 --> 52:12.661
what is a COVID case, you know, which is an incredibly vague concept.

52:12.781 --> 52:13.302
And unless you

52:15.403 --> 52:24.407
and frankly, meaningless concept, then everything else that follows from those flawed definitions is going to be off.

52:25.707 --> 52:38.352
So yeah, I mean, it's everyone accepts, and you know, people who aren't anti-Semitic, the vast majority of people, you know, don't hate Jews, but they accept that they think of Jews as a race.

52:38.552 --> 52:40.033
And it's basically because

52:42.338 --> 53:09.042
that's how you know even jews i mean myself and everyone i grew up with all we all except the concept that yes were a religion but then there is a uh... sort of that you know there's something else to it there's a culture there is an ethnicity there is a you know it and it's really none of that stuff there's no sit there's no jewish you know matzo ball soup and uh... you know and and locks and and bagels

53:09.642 --> 53:21.050
that's maybe Ashkenazi, that's Eastern European, but there are other people that eat that, you know, or Syrian Jews eat Syrian food or Yemen, Yemen, Yemeni Jews eat, you know, the same food as other people.

53:21.090 --> 53:21.611
So there's no

53:22.668 --> 53:24.448
Oh my gosh, I'm seeing all kinds of things.

53:24.508 --> 53:29.910
If you argue about the size of somebody's nose, indicating that you're already arguing the same thing too.

53:29.990 --> 53:31.490
It's incredible actually.

53:31.590 --> 53:32.050
Wow.

53:32.550 --> 53:42.153
A lot of these tropes reinforce this tremendously without you even knowing it that, Oh, I'm ashamed that people say that, but if they say that and you accept it, then you accept it.

53:42.253 --> 53:43.213
I mean, it's incredible.

53:43.273 --> 53:43.713
Wow.

53:44.373 --> 53:44.613
Right.

53:45.873 --> 53:47.454
Um, what was I going to say?

53:47.814 --> 53:47.914
Um,

53:49.833 --> 53:51.073
I don't know, it skipped my mind.

53:51.334 --> 53:52.474
I didn't sleep enough last night.

53:52.514 --> 53:56.255
I had this much better sketched out in my head last night, and my daughter woke me up.

53:56.775 --> 53:57.656
Oh, that's all right.

53:58.656 --> 54:00.016
I definitely understand that.

54:00.517 --> 54:16.402
So I think that these big ideas that you started with, which is Zionism being a Jewish debate or not, and Zionism being nationalism, not some kind of race or any kind of descendancy, I think is really, really important.

54:17.847 --> 54:24.994
The disappointment for me was also a revelation because I was, for a brief period of time,

54:26.024 --> 54:28.485
believing that that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:28.525 --> 54:30.546
was going to be somebody that I could rally behind.

54:30.586 --> 54:33.046
And I was so excited to be helping him with his on his book.

54:33.126 --> 54:43.370
But once this came out, it's interesting because number one, there was this viral video of him at a dinner party where he talks about the ethnic targeting of COVID.

54:43.450 --> 54:53.093
And he refers to the Jewish race as being the least vulnerable, which was also feeding right into this trope of where you accept the idea that Jewish

54:53.673 --> 54:55.975
is Jewish, is both a religion and a race.

54:56.676 --> 55:00.259
And then he, of course, takes this really hardline opinion.

55:00.279 --> 55:04.723
I guess Rabbi Shmuley or some guy is some dude that he talks to all the time.

55:04.783 --> 55:10.509
So at that stage, I just had that illusion broken very, very quickly, because even if

55:11.499 --> 55:17.461
he would have taken a more nuanced position within this false dichotomy, I probably wouldn't have seen it.

55:17.601 --> 55:19.001
That's the scary part, right?

55:19.061 --> 55:26.883
He could have taken an opinion and made it so that I would have never been able to escape the paradigm that they have us trapped in.

55:26.923 --> 55:32.445
So I find it really, really insightful how you've been able to lay it out so far.

55:33.125 --> 55:37.126
How has that been hitting with you with this guy, Bobby Kennedy?

55:38.703 --> 55:42.607
Well, you know, I first saw him speak.

55:42.647 --> 55:54.879
I never really paid attention to him before until I went to the Defeat the Mandates rally here in D.C., which, you know, upon reflection, I see it as very much like a controlled opposition sort of event.

55:56.861 --> 56:14.236
But at the time, you know, I found it pretty inspiring, and particularly his speech on, you know, our ruling class, our elites now have these systems of control that were unimaginable to the greatest of tyrants in history.

56:14.256 --> 56:19.020
And he said, you know, even Anne Frank wouldn't have been able to escape, even though she didn't escape.

56:21.082 --> 56:38.233
His point was that it's true that the systems of control are much more advanced for any totalitarian system, and so he was attacked.

56:38.313 --> 56:43.837
I thought his point was great and true, and he was attacked in the media,

56:44.815 --> 56:50.297
And he ended up apologizing for it, which I publicly said he shouldn't apologize for at the time.

56:51.077 --> 56:57.279
And that showed me that he's subject, he's going to fall under political pressure.

56:57.479 --> 57:01.420
Nonetheless, I thought I was like, this guy, there's something to him.

57:03.201 --> 57:03.921
When I saw

57:05.142 --> 57:05.242
it's

57:21.505 --> 57:29.335
casino mogul who once said that he wanted to bomb Iran, drop a nuclear bomb on Iran.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.477
I mean, the guy's a total fanatic.

57:32.098 --> 57:36.223
He's the perfect example of Zionists, claims to be Jewish.

57:37.461 --> 57:42.104
does, is not religious at all, and embodies all of the worst stereotypes about Jews.

57:42.224 --> 57:43.985
That is the essence of Zionism.

57:44.445 --> 57:53.050
And so this is the guy who's funding Rabbi Shmuley, who also is, again, one of these, he's like a, he's like an anti-Semitic stereotype.

57:53.070 --> 57:54.691
That's what Zionists really are.

57:55.752 --> 58:06.820
He claims to be a rabbi, but is involved in all kinds of unholy, unpious ventures, including selling adult toys with his daughter.

58:07.281 --> 58:11.644
They have a business together, and he stands with her in these videos and promotes this stuff.

58:12.144 --> 58:15.967
So then people say, look, this is what Jews are promoting.

58:16.788 --> 58:18.269
This is what Jews are doing.

58:18.469 --> 58:23.273
Jews are selling us pornography and all these kinds of terrible influences.

58:26.507 --> 58:30.189
Rabbi Shmuley and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:30.489 --> 58:40.633
do this appearance together, and I see Kennedy basically just adopting the most fanatical talking points.

58:40.713 --> 58:45.555
As you said, if he had taken a more moderate, middle-of-the-road approach,

58:46.315 --> 58:48.916
might have gotten—it would have been less clear.

58:48.996 --> 58:59.982
But he just adopted the most extreme talking points, and he said them in a way—it was obvious he had no idea what he was talking about.

59:00.242 --> 59:02.343
So what it showed me is that he was totally dishonest.

59:02.463 --> 59:07.926
He had no actual character, and he was for sale to the highest bidder.

59:09.766 --> 59:13.847
So at that point, I mean, this was about a year ago when I first saw that.

59:13.887 --> 59:20.789
And I did a live stream on my channel, Uncaptured Media, where I just kind of like went through it and discussed it and laid all this out.

59:20.829 --> 59:32.793
And it was clear to me that, you know, I think there are people in kind of the so-called medical freedom movement who kind of wanted to, you know, overlook that or don't really care about that or, you know, that's not my issue.

59:33.473 --> 59:51.923
But to me, seeing how he embraced the most fanatical strains of Zionism, because for whatever reason, for political reasons, showed me it was like the light kind of peeking through, that this guy is not what he says he is.

59:53.404 --> 59:57.767
And for someone to talk about systems of totalitarianism,

59:58.447 --> 01:00:09.555
but support the most extreme version of that in what the state of Israel is doing to the Gaza Strip is the most hypocritical stance possible.

01:00:10.496 --> 01:00:24.006
So between that and then seeing how he promotes lab leak, it's like he is staying carefully within these false paradigms.

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:26.809
He is promoting PSYOPs to the people

01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:28.990
who are sort of dissident.

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:40.397
And that's what I, you know, about a year ago, that's what I was, and this is before I had kind of got onto the false dichotomy of lab leak and natural origin, the phony COVID origins debate.

01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:56.408
That's what I saw is that, you know, this guy is gonna be used to basically bring in dissident thinkers, whether on the left or whether on the right, and corral them back into the establishment, whether it's through Zionism or whether it's through the,

01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.129
you know, lab leak thing.

01:00:58.969 --> 01:01:13.937
Yeah, and what really depresses me about it as my brain kind of ran through the simulation to its logical conclusion, then you have to go pre-pandemic and wonder at what stage was that, what were they all playing against us?

01:01:14.557 --> 01:01:20.981
That's the part that really becomes disturbing because I've kind of come to the conclusion that a lot of what

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:29.197
I thought was happening and when I first got involved with him and CHD is not what was really happening even before the pandemic.

01:01:29.498 --> 01:01:41.730
In fact, they were kind of a group of people that was keeping a lid on a problem that all of these, you know, they needed somebody to be able to shout at and to listen to them and whatever.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:42.570
And so a lot of this

01:01:44.032 --> 01:01:50.317
the public health disaster that is the American vaccine schedule was actually covered up by some of these organizations, I'm afraid.

01:01:50.517 --> 01:01:54.541
And so again, it is going to be hard.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:02:07.452
But can you, I know you don't have too much more time, but can you briefly maybe give us a couple examples in your long experience with this where you ran up against

01:02:09.972 --> 01:02:16.336
sort of a denial of your work or a denial of your message because of whatever reason.

01:02:16.356 --> 01:02:23.199
I don't know how many good examples you have, but you must have some good examples that are completely independent of COVID.

01:02:23.299 --> 01:02:25.040
But obviously, like, wait, what?

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.101
You won't let me say that?

01:02:26.141 --> 01:02:29.263
That doesn't make sense.

01:02:29.403 --> 01:02:30.884
Can you give us any of those examples?

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:37.416
You mean in terms of like institution, like inside institutions or just with people in general?

01:02:37.436 --> 01:02:37.756
I don't know.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:48.107
I mean, at some point you must have been naive and thought you could just call the Wall Street Journal and say that you have a really good story, or you tried to make an effort in some way that revealed

01:02:49.108 --> 01:02:52.850
How long have you known that you needed to have uncaptured media, for example?

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.931
That's your thing.

01:02:55.391 --> 01:02:59.113
But how long have you realized that that was a giant problem as a journalist?

01:02:59.433 --> 01:03:00.373
Maybe that's a better question.

01:03:01.033 --> 01:03:02.834
Well, I mean, I got into journalism.

01:03:03.354 --> 01:03:06.076
I never tried to work in the mainstream media.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.997
I mean, I'm 39 now.

01:03:08.337 --> 01:03:09.337
I spent my 20s.

01:03:10.518 --> 01:03:14.780
I took a few years off college, and I finished in 2009, right when the economy crashed.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.381
So basically, everything I'd done was for nothing.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:22.146
And so I took years trying to figure out what to do professionally.

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:26.471
I couldn't be motivated to just get a job for a good salary.

01:03:26.912 --> 01:03:32.138
I was basically doing labor, and I had a trade for a while.

01:03:35.489 --> 01:03:43.594
kind of thought about journalism for a while, but didn't think I was, you know, thought you had to be some kind of incredible genius to do it.

01:03:44.095 --> 01:03:47.917
And then I just decided to go for it one day doing independent journalism.

01:03:48.638 --> 01:03:52.260
So I never tried to kind of flirt with the mainstream.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.543
And I've just always been kind of on outside of it and very critical of it.

01:03:57.784 --> 01:04:02.046
So, you know, and it's and I, I struggled for years.

01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:04.328
And now I'm, you know, in a better position.

01:04:04.848 --> 01:04:11.655
But yeah, no, I mean, I never tried with the mainstream or, you know, legacy media.

01:04:12.636 --> 01:04:26.109
I mean, where I run into walls, honestly, is more, you know, and this is why I think this conversation is very useful, is where, you know, I have people on, particularly on the left,

01:04:26.837 --> 01:04:33.440
who tend to see through, you know, who are very astute on their analysis of Zionism.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:41.743
And even though a lot of these, you know, a lot of these people still accept the Zionist definition of, you know, they believe that Zionism is Jewish supremacy.

01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:43.204
And now I'm working on that.

01:04:43.244 --> 01:04:48.986
In the last two months, I've started really trying to focus on that to sort of break that down.

01:04:50.523 --> 01:04:58.065
But nonetheless, people who see the propaganda models very clearly on the left with Zionism and Israel and how that is sold to us.

01:04:58.665 --> 01:05:06.726
And then, you know, on, I guess, more on the right, though, you know, those terms are all very amorphous.

01:05:07.127 --> 01:05:12.528
People who see through a lot of COVID propaganda and understand we were lied to,

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:21.423
for years about that, but cannot reconcile the two and don't see them as related.

01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:33.711
And what I see is not only are they the same animal, we are fed, they use the same propaganda models against us.

01:05:33.831 --> 01:05:41.036
So for example, when COVID kicked off with two weeks to slow or stop the spread,

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:52.903
And then, of course, you know, that was the, you know, that was the hook, that was the entry point for an entire paradigm shift.

01:05:53.784 --> 01:06:08.974
It's the same with, you know, when October, after October 7th, around October 13th or so, Israel said that all of northern Gaza has to evacuate the area so it could, so Israel could fight terrorists.

01:06:09.874 --> 01:06:10.755
And then now,

01:06:13.554 --> 01:06:25.719
People in northern Gaza, seven, eight months later, are living in tent camps at the very southern edge of Gaza, up against the border with Egypt, and they've just been bombed.

01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:33.322
So, you know, it was like, just go along with this little bit, and then you basically give it all up.

01:06:34.284 --> 01:06:39.112
I think that was an AI mistake though, the targeting of the AI that Palantir or whatever was running.

01:06:39.152 --> 01:06:40.394
I think that was just a mistake.

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:41.196
That's what they're saying.

01:06:41.216 --> 01:06:43.920
It was like a tragic mistake that they bombed the tents.

01:06:44.707 --> 01:06:47.169
Totally, no, no, no, totally, totally intentional.

01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:49.030
I mean, they know exactly what they're doing.

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:54.253
There's no way that's, and then, in fact, they've done it twice since the first time.

01:06:54.653 --> 01:06:57.455
Netanyahu said it was a mistake, and then he did it two more times.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:09.662
They said it was a mistake, and then they said that actually there were two Hamas militants there, and then they said that they intercepted a phone conversation.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:13.305
I mean, it's just been a series of contradictory lies, but

01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:23.405
You know, I mean, without trying to provoke any any terrible emotions, I presume over your time there, you've met people that you've lost.

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:25.726
I mean, where is their count at?

01:07:27.915 --> 01:07:38.302
You know, a lot of the people that I became close with when I was in Gaza were sort of of a, I guess a more middle middle class.

01:07:39.043 --> 01:07:45.928
And so they've managed over the years to leave Gaza, which is it's, it's extremely hard and expensive to leave Gaza.

01:07:46.908 --> 01:07:48.329
But it can be done.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:54.934
Or you can't just walk to the gate and go to Israel and pick up a flight that that's not how that works.

01:07:55.652 --> 01:07:56.473
No, can't do that.

01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:02.282
There are two crossings out of Gaza.

01:08:02.302 --> 01:08:06.087
There's one into Israel, which is extremely difficult to get.

01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:08.471
I met elderly people

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.178
who had American visas that were expired.

01:08:15.899 --> 01:08:29.612
Basically, they had to get permission from the Americans and the Israeli security services to leave Gaza, to go to the American embassy or consulate in Jerusalem, and then in order to do an interview to obtain a visa.

01:08:30.093 --> 01:08:32.735
Then, and they go back in the same day, go back to Gaza.

01:08:33.596 --> 01:08:38.362
They had purchased flights, they had American visas to come to the U.S.

01:08:38.562 --> 01:08:40.625
to be with their daughter who was living in St.

01:08:40.645 --> 01:08:40.865
Louis.

01:08:43.305 --> 01:08:44.765
were not allowed out of Gaza again.

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:46.986
They waited years, their visas expired.

01:08:47.446 --> 01:08:51.148
Then they managed to repeat that process and get new U.S.

01:08:51.188 --> 01:08:51.608
visas.

01:08:52.568 --> 01:08:55.389
And I met them and they were waiting to get those and they couldn't get out.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:09:02.431
So the whole, it's incredibly difficult to get permission to go out of the crossing with Israel.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:07.113
You're subjected to all kinds of- What if you want to go to like spring break or something though?

01:09:07.153 --> 01:09:09.974
Like if you wanted to go to Florida for a couple of weeks, you can't?

01:09:10.694 --> 01:09:11.154
Not a chance.

01:09:12.625 --> 01:09:13.085
Not a chance.

01:09:13.186 --> 01:09:15.027
I mean, you are a subhuman.

01:09:15.047 --> 01:09:15.868
You have no rights.

01:09:15.928 --> 01:09:19.912
I mean, that concept of going on a vacation just does not exist.

01:09:19.952 --> 01:09:24.376
The other way to go is to go into Egypt.

01:09:24.877 --> 01:09:27.879
Egypt collaborates very closely with Israel.

01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:32.003
You know, we give all kinds of huge amounts of money.

01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:33.184
I think the second most

01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:40.144
a huge amount of money to Egypt to basically collaborate with Israel.

01:09:40.224 --> 01:09:46.935
Is the Egyptian government under any pressure to reject that aid and go and save the Palestinians or not really?

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.358
Or we just don't see that pressure?

01:09:49.332 --> 01:10:07.741
Yeah, no, there is public pressure, but the Egyptian, it's basically like a sort of dictatorship where the president, Sisi, who is very close to the U.S., he was installed in a coup.

01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:15.025
So and when people demonstrated against it, I mean, they massacred like hundreds of them in the street.

01:10:15.105 --> 01:10:18.346
So people are very, very afraid to go out and demonstrate.

01:10:18.366 --> 01:10:21.508
So definitely there's a lot of sympathy for the Palestinians in Egypt.

01:10:21.628 --> 01:10:24.909
But, you know, they're living under this under the boot, too.

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:25.890
I see.

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:30.492
So to go out of Rafah, you know, you can like you

01:10:30.692 --> 01:10:33.434
You have to have somewhere to go.

01:10:33.894 --> 01:10:42.861
You have to basically bribe the Egyptians with several thousand dollars per person.

01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.222
It's very, very difficult.

01:10:45.863 --> 01:10:50.006
Unemployment is something like 80 percent.

01:10:50.286 --> 01:10:54.429
People in Gaza live in extreme poverty, the vast majority of the people.

01:10:55.329 --> 01:10:57.652
They don't have anywhere near that kind of money.

01:10:58.592 --> 01:11:02.776
And so if you try to take a boat out to sea, the Israeli Navy will shoot you.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.939
If you try to walk to Israel, they will shoot you.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.721
I mean, I've watched this happen.

01:11:09.243 --> 01:11:11.505
So, I mean, you're just in a big concentration camp.

01:11:11.705 --> 01:11:12.105
That's it.

01:11:12.606 --> 01:11:16.650
And if you're of a certain class, then you have a possibility of travel, but for 90,

01:11:18.952 --> 01:11:22.995
8% of the population, that's just a total impossibility.

01:11:23.296 --> 01:11:26.859
Are there really Palestinians in the Israeli parliament then or not?

01:11:27.139 --> 01:11:31.343
Or they're just pretend Palestinians or they can't do anything or what?

01:11:33.785 --> 01:11:39.750
Yes, there are a handful of Palestinians in the Israeli parliament.

01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:47.515
Basically, the vast majority of Palestinians were expelled by Zionist militias and the Israeli military in 1947 and 1948.

01:11:52.339 --> 01:12:03.690
So, in Israel proper, what Palestinians consider 1948 Palestine, the 1948 borders, there is a Palestinian minority that remained.

01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:09.215
They lived under an Israeli military dictatorship until 1967.

01:12:11.858 --> 01:12:14.100
And then they were given the right to vote.

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:22.171
So they are Israeli citizens, but they do not have national self-determination.

01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:23.492
They don't have national rights.

01:12:24.614 --> 01:12:26.216
So you have

01:12:28.398 --> 01:12:33.023
Like on Israeli IDs, according to Israel, there's no such thing as an Israeli.

01:12:33.423 --> 01:12:38.267
On your Israeli ID, it lists your religion or, you know, what they consider your race.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:43.232
It does not list, you know, say citizen of Israel, but it says you're Jewish.

01:12:43.332 --> 01:12:44.693
Oh, wow.

01:12:44.953 --> 01:12:46.475
Interesting.

01:12:46.815 --> 01:12:50.859
So it's not a country of its citizens.

01:12:51.319 --> 01:12:53.881
It's a country for one

01:12:54.702 --> 01:12:56.823
nationality at the expense of others.

01:12:56.903 --> 01:13:06.045
And so does Israel have a certain, as you said, if you're a certain class, so then are there a certain class of Palestinians that they can film crossing the border without friction?

01:13:06.065 --> 01:13:12.286
And so then they can point to those Palestinians and say, hey, we let safe Palestinians travel freely.

01:13:12.326 --> 01:13:15.727
It's just all the people we don't trust that we keep penned in this cage.

01:13:16.932 --> 01:13:17.392
Right, right.

01:13:17.552 --> 01:13:19.494
And of course, there's a collaborator class.

01:13:20.094 --> 01:13:21.655
In the West Bank, that's who rules.

01:13:22.716 --> 01:13:30.961
They have this kind of fiction that's called the Palestinian Authority, which is hardly Palestinian and has zero authority.

01:13:31.821 --> 01:13:33.182
And it's funded by the U.S.

01:13:33.262 --> 01:13:37.445
and Europe and Israel in order to crack down on Palestinian resistance.

01:13:37.465 --> 01:13:39.786
And that's who operates in the West Bank.

01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:53.053
To answer your question about Palestinian representation in Israel's parliament in the Knesset, yes, there are Palestinians in there, but they're a minority, of course.

01:13:53.093 --> 01:13:55.915
They have no significant political power.

01:13:58.636 --> 01:14:11.406
In 2017 or 2018, Israel passed what's called the Nation State Law, which explicitly defined Israel's character as a so-called Jewish state.

01:14:13.127 --> 01:14:18.731
So it cemented this concept of

01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:24.758
you know, of Zionism as the national ideology.

01:14:25.198 --> 01:14:37.125
And, you know, anyone who does not fit within that racial category as lesser, you know, they don't have national rights, even if they are a citizen.

01:14:37.946 --> 01:14:42.608
One of the things that I think I heard from you, we're going to have to stop soon if you have an interview at noon.

01:14:43.929 --> 01:14:58.602
The that I would like to bring up just to to make sure that we cover it is this idea that if there was an Israeli settlement and there were terrorists in the settlement that they might just bomb the whole settlement.

01:14:58.842 --> 01:15:05.647
And if there were some settlers there, they would just be casualties considered part of the the sort of

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:10.488
the doctrine, whatever it is that they do, which is just we wipe them all out.

01:15:10.649 --> 01:15:14.430
And if there's some people next to them or whatever, it's just the way it is.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:24.834
How does this, how can we, how can we bring Americans to understand that kind of mentality?

01:15:24.894 --> 01:15:25.354
I mean, I don't,

01:15:26.401 --> 01:15:27.823
It's hard for me to explain it.

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:34.270
In the United States military, I think there might be something called a look-away doctrine where you just don't want to know what's behind the curtain.

01:15:35.311 --> 01:15:39.955
This seems a little more overt if their military operates under this principle.

01:15:39.996 --> 01:15:42.018
That's a lot of people that know what's going on.

01:15:42.058 --> 01:15:43.039
Am I wrong about that?

01:15:44.733 --> 01:15:47.775
Yeah, it's called the Hannibal Directive, what you're referring to.

01:15:49.777 --> 01:15:58.023
And the Hannibal Directive is basically a military protocol, an Israeli military protocol,

01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:14.928
that when a, originally it was a soldier, was taken captive, then they, the military does everything possible to kill that soldier, in fact, to prevent him from being taken captive.

01:16:15.749 --> 01:16:27.258
So then the, you know, Palestinians or Lebanese or, you know, whoever the captors are, could use them to extract concessions, usually meaning release of political prisoners.

01:16:28.539 --> 01:16:38.468
So, this started in the 80s and, you know, was used, I mean, a few times, really several times.

01:16:38.868 --> 01:16:53.401
In 2000, I believe 2008, the Israeli soldier, I don't know, 2006, Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was taken captive in Gaza.

01:16:54.202 --> 01:17:02.665
And he was released for about 1,100 Palestinian prisoners in 2011.

01:17:03.105 --> 01:17:10.068
And so after that—and that was extremely politically— Costly.

01:17:11.178 --> 01:17:33.171
copy exactly costly the best way to describe it uh... there was a huge debate in israeli society eleven eleven hundred people you know that a prison for this one soldier well you know maybe we have to sacrifice that one but in fact the vast majority the overwhelming majority of those eleven hundred were uh... political prisoners who had not committed any act of violence number one let alone

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:42.660
The others are political prisoners, too, because the acts of violence they had carried out were against the occupation, were in response to the occupation.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:53.211
So, it's this Zionist refusal to examine the actual reasons for the violence that they experience at the hands of Palestinians.

01:17:54.272 --> 01:17:54.412
So,

01:17:55.493 --> 01:17:57.073
This happened in 2014.

01:17:57.734 --> 01:18:14.797
They implemented the Hannibal Directive in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, where a couple of soldiers were nabbed by some Palestinian fighters, and they bombed the whole area and killed something like 125 Palestinians and those soldiers.

01:18:16.297 --> 01:18:21.639
And I went about a week or two weeks later, I actually went to the site and saw what it looked like.

01:18:23.582 --> 01:18:24.613
And on October 7th,

01:18:26.147 --> 01:18:32.071
this Hannibal Directive was enacted on like a mass scale and since then.

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:52.767
So basically, Hamas' goal on October 7th was to wipe out the Gaza Division of the Israeli military, the Gaza Battalion, which it successfully did, and also take a bunch of captives into Gaza so then it could negotiate to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.

01:18:54.870 --> 01:19:06.220
Israel basically decided, when it understood it was happening, to implement this Hannibal Directive, and so they just basically bombed everything in sight.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:17.090
All these vehicles that were going back into Gaza, or people on bicycles or motorcycles or donkey-pulled carts, were all hit by helicopters.

01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:25.455
with rockets and missiles or massive guns, and they killed a ton of people.

01:19:25.475 --> 01:19:27.756
There are several documented proven examples of this on October 7th.

01:19:35.763 --> 01:19:53.128
But they're including, I mean, the most famous one is in what's called Kibbutz Beri, like a settlement just outside of Gaza, where about 40 Hamas fighters came, took over the kibbutz, took about 14 or 15 people into one house,

01:19:55.689 --> 01:20:03.157
and wanted to negotiate with the Israeli authorities to have safe passage to take them back into Gaza.

01:20:03.177 --> 01:20:06.800
It turned out the Israeli authorities weren't even there for several hours.

01:20:07.241 --> 01:20:16.029
So these Palestinian militants were just hiding in this house with these people, with these captives, including two children.

01:20:16.049 --> 01:20:17.091
I mean, these were not soldiers.

01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:18.031
These are civilians.

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:25.336
And they're in this house, and they could have just casually strolled across into Gaza.

01:20:25.657 --> 01:20:26.497
But they stayed there.

01:20:26.597 --> 01:20:30.360
And when the Israeli military showed up, they immediately opened fire.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:36.124
It had a long firefight with the Palestinians, who basically had these captives.

01:20:37.385 --> 01:20:47.631
And then when an Israeli tank arrived on the scene around sundown, around 7 p.m., the commander on the scene

01:20:48.972 --> 01:20:51.555
ordered the tank to open fire on the house.

01:20:52.015 --> 01:20:52.696
And so they did.

01:20:52.716 --> 01:20:58.902
And this Israeli tank killed everyone inside, except one woman who survived.

01:20:59.963 --> 01:21:02.065
And she, there were actually two survivors.

01:21:02.105 --> 01:21:10.633
There was one woman who was, she managed to convince the leader of the Hamas fighters to negotiate his release with the Israelis.

01:21:11.073 --> 01:21:11.954
So she got out.

01:21:12.394 --> 01:21:13.596
And then when the tank arrived,

01:21:14.116 --> 01:21:20.541
the tank fired on the house and everyone was killed except one woman who also gave her account of what happened.

01:21:20.601 --> 01:21:30.488
So it became a big scandal in Israel with the families and the survivors demanding an investigation, and the Israeli military just basically blew it off.

01:21:30.848 --> 01:21:34.110
And then there's, you know, there's, there's, this is just one example of it.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.572
So basically,

01:21:38.188 --> 01:21:51.638
The Hannibal Directive, this concept of killing all the captives, as many captives as possible in order to prevent their exchange, has been applied according to one Israeli official across the entire Gaza Strip.

01:21:51.679 --> 01:21:57.703
The idea is to just kill captives rather than try to secure their release.

01:21:58.984 --> 01:22:02.667
The captives who have been released, who were exchanged back in November,

01:22:05.183 --> 01:22:12.634
They all have said that the scariest part were the bombs dropping around me, these 2,000-pound bombs that take out a whole building.

01:22:13.935 --> 01:22:15.838
Some of them were in the next building over.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.023
They're in tunnels underneath the ground.

01:22:21.305 --> 01:22:26.890
50 meters underground and when one of these bombs hits, you know, the whole tunnel sways they talk about that.

01:22:27.571 --> 01:22:47.168
So The Israeli military is not interested in trying to secure inch in securing their release it's just Basically just kill as many people as possible and you know, no negotiations whatsoever Has your obviously

01:22:48.542 --> 01:22:52.185
updated with important nuance understanding of the situation.

01:22:52.225 --> 01:22:57.409
Has that influenced at all your being able to finalize your film and get it out?

01:22:57.569 --> 01:22:58.530
And how's that working?

01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:05.755
Can you kind of give us a wrap up of what you're doing and where to find you so you can, you know, take a break and get on to your next interview?

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:07.417
Yeah.

01:23:07.697 --> 01:23:18.085
You know, I'm actually, I've been working on this film about Israel's Third Temple movement for, basically I started, when I started in journalism, I just started following their activities and

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.761
Third Temple Movement?

01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:24.424
Are you talking about the Red Heifer stuff that I see?

01:23:24.464 --> 01:23:24.904
Exactly.

01:23:25.224 --> 01:23:25.965
Oh my gosh.

01:23:26.105 --> 01:23:26.385
Wow.

01:23:26.525 --> 01:23:27.766
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:27.846 --> 01:23:37.394
So I've been filming them for years and years and I've managed to raise enough money to have a professional crew to do all of this filming.

01:23:38.594 --> 01:23:40.896
We're still filming these weeks.

01:23:42.397 --> 01:23:44.879
And so that's what I'm working on full time.

01:23:48.954 --> 01:24:02.279
I, you know, I'm actually, I was planning to release the documentary a couple of years ago, and I'm very thankful I didn't because I was still using this kind of Zionist propaganda concept.

01:24:02.339 --> 01:24:13.404
I was still, you know, I hadn't broken free of that Zionist propaganda about even what I explained on Jimmy Dore when I said, you know, the genie has been lit out of the bottle because, you know, Zionism took this

01:24:14.644 --> 01:24:20.127
religious concept and then just made it real, even that's really not true.

01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:25.750
Because Zionism, you know, Orthodox Judaism, Judaism never sought political sovereignty.

01:24:26.331 --> 01:24:30.213
It was never like, oh, when God says, then we'll have political sovereignty.

01:24:31.193 --> 01:24:35.996
Jewish theology is talking about a complete, you know, it's talking about a utopia.

01:24:36.336 --> 01:24:37.277
It doesn't exist.

01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:39.939
It's talking, you know, the lion will lay down with the lamb.

01:24:39.979 --> 01:24:42.000
There will be peace between all the nations.

01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:43.561
All of these things.

01:24:43.581 --> 01:24:46.663
This is not something you can achieve by political means.

01:24:47.484 --> 01:24:53.507
This is something completely supernatural that they believe will happen when

01:24:54.608 --> 01:25:04.110
Jews are righteous enough when people like me return to Judaism and keep the Sabbath and all of these things.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:10.331
And so it's not that Zionists took that and then just said, oh, we're just going to make it happen.

01:25:10.651 --> 01:25:23.033
It's no, they took the whole concept, emptied it of all of its meaning, every bit of meaning, and then just refilled it with nationalism and used that theological supernatural concept

01:25:24.154 --> 01:25:32.788
of a temple and the ingathering of the exiles and made that into something basically profane.

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:36.835
They took something sacred and made it profane and completely changed the meaning of it.

01:25:40.028 --> 01:25:45.469
I've incorporated that into my documentary, that kind of the explanation in a much sharper way.

01:25:45.509 --> 01:25:48.350
And I'll have it with people who can explain it better than I can.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:26:00.913
In fact, the person who's really opened my mind on this, in the same way that you, Jay, have really opened my mind with a lot of understanding the COVID operation,

01:26:03.486 --> 01:26:23.296
The guy who's really clarified things for me on Zionism, his name is Rabbi Yaakov Shapiro, and he's on YouTube more and more these days, but he's an incredible guy, very approachable, makes things very easy to understand, and I'm in the middle of his book called The Empty Wagon.

01:26:25.137 --> 01:26:29.479
And so it's like a thousand page book that is really for yeshiva students.

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:39.584
So, you know, anybody could read it, but you'll probably want to, you know, have your have your phone nearby to look up like certain Hebrew concepts, which I have to.

01:26:40.184 --> 01:26:51.490
But yeah, so I'm working on this documentary, trying to get it out at some point this year and just doing, you know, haven't been doing much journalism lately.

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:53.771
And and I'm constantly being

01:26:55.017 --> 01:27:06.705
I have one third of my brain devoted to Israel-Palestine-Zionism, another third, maybe at this point 20 percent, trying to follow

01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:10.342
you know, COVID kind of propaganda.

01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:18.707
And I'm constantly being pulled to kind of finish this investigation, this big investigation that I'd contacted you about in the first place.

01:27:19.047 --> 01:27:21.109
And then the other thing I work on a lot is Haiti.

01:27:21.289 --> 01:27:23.150
I just released a documentary on Haiti.

01:27:23.170 --> 01:27:23.730
That's right.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:25.351
You were just there, actually.

01:27:25.391 --> 01:27:25.991
That's right.

01:27:26.232 --> 01:27:27.592
I was there in February.

01:27:27.792 --> 01:27:35.257
So it's been three months now, but, you know, which is undergoing a major, major, you know, what I describe as a revolutionary process.

01:27:35.337 --> 01:27:36.558
So it's,

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:41.616
It's a lot but you know it's all it's really all the same system.

01:27:41.836 --> 01:27:45.159
I mean really you know I mean what you know what is what is Haiti.

01:27:45.419 --> 01:27:51.285
I think Jessica do a piece on this or somebody did a piece about what does Haiti tell us about Covid.

01:27:53.513 --> 01:27:56.134
You know, so it's really all the same system.

01:27:56.214 --> 01:27:59.116
It's just sort of how do you compartmentalize it?

01:27:59.176 --> 01:28:03.739
How do you break it down in order to chop it up?

01:28:04.399 --> 01:28:07.401
And can they find you at uncapturedmedia.com?

01:28:07.441 --> 01:28:08.201
Is that a thing?

01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:11.603
It's uncaptured.media is my website.

01:28:11.683 --> 01:28:13.124
It's just my substack.

01:28:13.904 --> 01:28:15.325
I got a unique URL for it.

01:28:17.406 --> 01:28:20.609
YouTube and I need to be more active on alternative platforms.

01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:22.250
But yeah, uncaptured media.

01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:27.934
And I'm on I'm very, I'm more active on personally, I'm most active on x at Dan Cohen 3000.

01:28:28.975 --> 01:28:30.396
Dan Cohen 3000.

01:28:30.436 --> 01:28:33.759
Why'd you choose that you sound like a cyborg then?

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.020
Yeah, it's great.

01:28:35.141 --> 01:28:37.082
I don't even know why I picked it when I was like 18.

01:28:38.123 --> 01:28:45.469
And then I just, you know, used it when I joined Twitter before I got into journalism, because there's so many Dan Cohen's, it's like a, it's a very common, I see.

01:28:45.569 --> 01:28:46.790
Okay, you know, name.

01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:48.591
And so then I just stuck with it.

01:28:50.513 --> 01:28:52.755
Well, I'm really happy you're you came on the show.

01:28:52.975 --> 01:28:55.417
And I don't want to make promises I can't keep.

01:28:55.457 --> 01:28:59.040
But I hope at some point, we can put something out together, which would

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:01.070
draw this together as well.

01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:03.091
I wish you the best of luck getting that film out.

01:29:03.111 --> 01:29:05.292
I wish you the best of luck getting your message out.

01:29:05.652 --> 01:29:12.335
I think it's really, it helps me to have some better idea of how to think about it.

01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:20.938
I don't think I'm going to start teaching anybody this stuff or try to learn any more, except for I am going to look into Yakov, as you say with a B or a V.

01:29:22.006 --> 01:29:29.168
Shapiro, with a V, Y-A-A-K-O-V, and then Shapiro, S-H-A-P-I-R-O.

01:29:29.208 --> 01:29:32.869
Oh wow, I did not spell that correctly, that's pretty funny.

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:34.570
It's Hebrew for Jacob.

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.911
Okay, yeah, gotcha, very good.

01:29:37.871 --> 01:29:41.092
But yeah, very, very brilliant educator.

01:29:42.119 --> 01:29:42.399
Okay.

01:29:42.499 --> 01:29:43.639
Well, thank you very much, Dan.

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:46.120
It's really been a pleasure and a long time coming.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.862
And I hope, I don't know, I hope you have a great week and maybe we'll have you on again.

01:29:50.882 --> 01:29:54.623
I mean, I know everybody would, the chat was going crazy.

01:29:54.643 --> 01:29:56.243
That's sometimes why I looked over here.

01:29:57.724 --> 01:29:59.304
So you stimulated a lot of thought.

01:29:59.324 --> 01:30:01.305
I expect I'm going to get a lot of emails.

01:30:02.458 --> 01:30:03.779
Awesome.

01:30:03.959 --> 01:30:08.381
I really want to hear what people have to say.

01:30:09.562 --> 01:30:17.407
If there's anything I didn't articulate correctly, I want to bring this out as much as possible.

01:30:17.447 --> 01:30:19.948
So I really appreciate you having me on, Jay.

01:30:21.909 --> 01:30:45.367

01:30:48.095 --> 01:30:53.877
Dan Cohen, trying to illustrate another, oh, we gotta escape out of there.

01:30:53.897 --> 01:30:55.697
I don't know why that word didn't work like that.

01:30:55.797 --> 01:30:57.237
That's a little unfortunate.

01:30:59.658 --> 01:31:01.859
Trying to build an understanding of the illusion.

01:31:02.659 --> 01:31:05.399
I think Dan has some really interesting insights.

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:10.201
I think also, as you heard at the end of the interview there, he's not afraid to be challenged on his ideas.

01:31:10.241 --> 01:31:11.461
He wants to be corrected.

01:31:11.761 --> 01:31:14.602
This is a really good sign, irrespective of,

01:31:15.522 --> 01:31:20.988
of, you know, who you are, if you at least say those words and show some pattern of that behavior.

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:23.911
I'm interested in talking to you.

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:31.900
As usual, ladies and gentlemen, I want to just say that the spread of bad ideas is more dangerous than the spread of any RNA molecule.

01:31:32.441 --> 01:31:35.865
I want to be sure that everything is grinding.

01:31:39.221 --> 01:31:42.304
I guess it's because of Zoom in the background or something like that.

01:31:42.364 --> 01:31:42.784
I don't know.

01:31:43.725 --> 01:31:47.048
I'll see what I can do here to get this speeded up a little bit.

01:31:48.249 --> 01:31:49.951
My computer is just crashing, maybe.

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.212
It's getting tired.

01:31:51.592 --> 01:31:57.578
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because we are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:31:58.098 --> 01:32:00.681
Not we, but they, excuse me.

01:32:01.061 --> 01:32:03.103
And if you liked what you saw,

01:32:04.304 --> 01:32:09.829
You can find Dan Cohen again at dancohen3000 on Twitter.

01:32:58.755 --> 01:33:05.898
Maybe you'll come to Pittsburgh in November for the, why isn't it coming out of my head, the Brownstone meeting.

01:33:06.738 --> 01:33:18.123
And also, of course, there is the Red Pill Conference, which is in Rapid City, South Dakota on the 15th and 16th of the coming month, where you will see me as one of the presenters.

01:33:18.143 --> 01:33:19.704
They're giving me a whole hour.

01:33:20.604 --> 01:33:22.546
So you know what I could do with an hour.

01:33:22.606 --> 01:33:25.449
Imagine what I could do with an hour on stage.

01:33:25.529 --> 01:33:27.351
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much again.

01:33:27.411 --> 01:33:34.317
This has been Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:33:35.318 --> 01:33:41.784
I guess we'll just slide over here and say see you later.

01:33:42.084 --> 01:33:42.545
Thanks, guys.
