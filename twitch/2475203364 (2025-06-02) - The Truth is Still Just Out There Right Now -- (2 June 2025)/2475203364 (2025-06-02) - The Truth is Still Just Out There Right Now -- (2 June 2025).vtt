00:19.568 --> 00:34.780
Ladies and gentlemen, testing one two, RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injections are not a form of medicine, transfection is a crime, and the pandemic, sorry, the population pyramids are real.

00:37.267 --> 00:37.967
Hello, everybody.

00:38.007 --> 00:38.848
Welcome to the show.

00:38.928 --> 00:39.528
Good to see you.

00:39.588 --> 00:42.089
SolarFire number one in the Twitch chat.

00:43.189 --> 00:57.615
Please don't forget to go to JC in the Woods to see if you can subscribe to that channel and make sure that we're a little more resilient on that incredibly lame platform called YouTube.

00:59.060 --> 01:26.081
They have put some restrictions on the JC on a bike channel and I consider that thing almost a a national historic document that I don't really want to Further risk losing so I'm gonna start streaming on a couple other channels And of course, I'm always on stream dot giga ohm dot bio You're always welcome to watch there and definitely welcome to a download there the main memory and the main message of this stream is of course

01:27.902 --> 01:45.115
that the background signal was never differentiated from and in fact there was no requirement for anyone to demonstrate anything worked in the real world just in a lab bench just when compared to a distilled water control

01:45.795 --> 01:54.200
or maybe a rigged control that had no chance of overlapping with the primers that were supposedly specific for something else.

01:55.021 --> 02:01.365
And this illusion is now permanently sustained by the FDA not questioning it.

02:01.405 --> 02:09.530
The FDA should have regulated every one of these PCR tests individually as a new occurrence of a unique medical device.

02:10.250 --> 02:13.412
And they didn't because of the emergency of the pandemic.

02:15.231 --> 02:33.265
And one way or another, it's very difficult for me at this point not to see the primary outcome of the pandemic to be the establishment of PCR as an accepted gold standard of diagnostic for a wide variety and actually for anything.

02:34.106 --> 02:36.648
We are now using it to do measles as

02:38.419 --> 02:44.880
As ironically as it sounds, we were using PCR to do measles already back when Andrew Wakefield was doing measles.

02:46.381 --> 03:01.964
And it's only now as we pull back and start to see it from different time horizons that you can really see that this is one malevolent hamster wheel and different parts of this story have been repeatedly given to us in little bits over time.

03:02.444 --> 03:07.345
And then they come back in the form of somebody else's book or in the form of somebody else's shtick.

03:07.805 --> 03:26.209
And at the end, we are still where we were when Mary Holland went on Democracy Now in 2015 and kind of argued with Paul Offit that some portion of these multi-antigen, multi-adjuvant tests, sorry, vaccines damaged her son.

03:26.689 --> 03:30.469
And he went on to say that she was nuts for the last 15 years.

03:31.410 --> 03:32.810
This is a staged,

03:33.789 --> 03:38.893
nonsense argument that is being sustained by the same nonsense actors.

03:40.054 --> 03:46.819
And if America cannot wake up to this, our grandchildren will not have an America anymore.

03:47.800 --> 04:03.392
They are going to destroy our country from within by dividing the populace on these nonsense narratives that are based on using their tests to find their ghosts and then declaring ourselves on their social media ghostbusters.

04:05.942 --> 04:07.243
That's what's happening here.

04:07.303 --> 04:14.449
We are pretending that we are in the real world when the vast majority of whatever we're doing is on social media.

04:15.970 --> 04:31.603
And so effectively, we are not only using their tests to find their ghosts and calling ourselves a ghostbuster, making their ghosts real, but we're doing it on their stage, arguing with their words, arguing with their experts, debating their questions,

04:33.499 --> 04:36.600
And that's not happening anymore on GigaOM Biological.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.621
It's not happening anymore on Heucytonic Live.

04:39.761 --> 04:59.106
It's now clear that the entire foundational biology that this pandemic is based on is the same ridiculous biology that has been perpetuated by the Human Genomes Project's endless announcements of its extended accomplishments.

05:00.202 --> 05:03.564
that Francis Collins himself often jokes about.

05:05.085 --> 05:07.447
The truth is is that RNA can't do that.

05:08.387 --> 05:12.710
The truth is intramuscular injection is not a form of medicine.

05:14.271 --> 05:19.615
The truth is that transfecting healthy people was always a crime.

05:19.675 --> 05:28.861
They knew it wouldn't work, but they had to start somewhere because testing things on animals only finds out whether and how it works on animals.

05:30.182 --> 05:45.499
which is part of the reality of the Bad Biology 101, the assumption is that we all have this common ancestor, and so we all have this common set of molecular tools that we're all trapped by and we all use.

05:48.567 --> 05:58.432
And that allows us to argue that evolution is real and that we're all a consequence of like a bacteria that just kept dividing and kept adding complexity.

05:58.912 --> 06:08.377
And this is absolute nonsense and does not adequately describe the pattern integrity that bacteria represent, never mind the

06:11.806 --> 06:17.747
the whole of creation that they claim to understand because DNA and evolution.

06:17.927 --> 06:38.192
It's remarkable how little progress has been made actually in understanding better the irreducible complexity of life on earth, but instead, so much progress has been made in not understanding, purposefully not understanding it, and putting thousands of

06:38.892 --> 06:47.377
of smart thinking people answering questions that make no progress in understanding the irreducible complexity of life on earth.

06:49.638 --> 06:57.983
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

07:00.414 --> 07:06.615
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

07:06.975 --> 07:08.396
He was neurologically damaged.

07:09.276 --> 07:15.477
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

07:15.837 --> 07:17.258
He was neurologically damaged.

07:18.158 --> 07:28.560
In condition that we... It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

07:29.261 --> 07:35.808
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

07:35.928 --> 07:41.453
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.716
It's just a big hassle in the end.

07:45.723 --> 08:00.057
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

08:00.117 --> 08:02.639
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

08:02.659 --> 08:07.203
The company that originally produced it knows that.

08:07.243 --> 08:09.846
They've chosen a short sequence that they think is relevant.

08:10.310 --> 08:15.074
It is a short sequence that just comes from one of the open reading frame one proteins.

08:15.715 --> 08:29.927
We are being duped by a non-specific test and we would have gotten these numbers or numbers very similar to them with or without this pandemic because we've never looked for SARS viruses as they are spread through our population.

08:29.947 --> 08:30.928
We've just never looked.

08:31.789 --> 08:33.691
Nobody sampled for it until this year.

08:34.832 --> 08:36.413
That's a huge point to make.

08:37.366 --> 08:42.047
because the SARS virus originally appeared in 2003 and disappeared in 2004.

08:42.808 --> 08:45.688
But it didn't really disappear, it just became not a problem.

08:47.009 --> 08:55.331
Descendants of that virus, of various virulence and infectivity have circulated in the time since.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.491
They didn't disappear.

08:56.511 --> 09:05.694
Now keep in mind that I've made a lot of progress since July of 2020 in my understanding of what virology is and isn't.

09:06.485 --> 09:12.310
And I've come to understand virology as almost exclusively transfection experiments in cell culture.

09:13.150 --> 09:35.588
Transfection experiments that involve cloned sequences, sequences that are grown up in high pure quantity and then applied to a cell culture or applied to an animal model and said to replicate the natural infection that is blamed on these full sequences that cannot be, that repeat, cannot be found in the wild.

09:37.239 --> 09:48.490
except with metagenomic sequencing or some other, what could be best called as like a surrogate signal.

09:49.411 --> 09:53.516
If we find a football in the backyard, that means that you have an NFL team in your house.

09:54.574 --> 09:58.077
And so we're gonna go buy an NFL team and bring them over for dinner.

09:58.457 --> 10:04.041
And that is a simulation of what we think happens at dinnertime.

10:04.422 --> 10:10.626
Although it's really hard to make it happen if we just find a football in the backyard and we try to grow a football team.

10:11.187 --> 10:18.793
But when we find a football team in the backyard, we just, or sorry, a football in the backyard, we just assume that an NFL football team has been here.

10:19.895 --> 10:34.382
And so it's totally okay if you want to study how NFL football teams could wreck your house or how NFL football teams could really ruin a dinner, then the way you start is you buy yourself an NFL football team and you put it in somebody's house.

10:35.643 --> 10:40.966
Even though the only signal you have in nature is that every once in a while you find a football in somebody's backyard.

10:43.325 --> 10:48.254
And you put Peter Daszak on the 60 Minutes saying that, wow, you know, I find footballs everywhere.

10:48.734 --> 10:55.065
These football teams are just waiting to come out of any jungle or bat cave and kick your ass and ruin your family dinner.

10:58.032 --> 11:12.301
Maybe that's not a very good analogy, but it's pretty close to the kind of leaps of faith that are made with regard to the molecular biology of coronaviruses, the molecular biology of any virus in a mammal.

11:14.048 --> 11:26.278
where you just have to assume that there's no bacteria or no bacteriophage anywhere in there that might be providing the signal that you purport is this mammalian virus.

11:26.899 --> 11:34.885
And more importantly, the main signal, that genetic signal that they claim to have found is only ever a fragment.

11:35.005 --> 11:37.207
It's only ever a football in the backyard.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.029
It's never the whole football team.

11:40.845 --> 11:50.050
At best, at best, they find somebody at your barbecue that played college football, and then they say, see, there was an NFL football team here.

11:50.690 --> 11:56.193
Or at least we know for sure that there is the possibility that NFL football teams could come out of your backyard.

12:01.775 --> 12:04.577
And this test is not specific for any one of them.

12:05.416 --> 12:14.081
And no one has ever done a study about how many descendants there are, how many people are infected, how many animals have been infected by it, etc.

12:17.243 --> 12:29.871
So, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin

12:31.052 --> 12:36.435
You know, the thing is, the average football team, if it was just a high school football team, it's totally fine.

12:36.475 --> 12:42.618
If a high school football team comes over to your house and has pizza and watches a movie with your sons, it's totally okay.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.079
They'll be a mess, but they'll probably even help you clean it up.

12:45.479 --> 12:51.262
And they'll say, thanks, Mrs. Cooey, when they go off with their moms, you know, their moms come and pick them up and they drive away.

12:51.342 --> 12:53.203
But if it's an NFL football team,

12:54.042 --> 13:15.357
You know, a team that was put together carefully by a bunch of scouts that were picking the baddest of badasses for defensive ends, and almost criminally violent people in the secondary of the defense, and getting some guy who used steroids right up until his senior year of college to be the running back, then you could call that a gain-of-function football team.

13:15.377 --> 13:21.021
You wouldn't want an NFL football team in your house, because man, oh man, they are really dangerous.

13:21.122 --> 13:22.643
Man alive, holy cow.

13:23.323 --> 13:24.666
Maybe America, I don't know.

13:25.327 --> 13:26.829
Crash the dollar, I don't know.

13:27.370 --> 13:31.979
Steal the rest of our, what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.136
but I know for sure that they are combining.

13:36.356 --> 13:41.217
And the thing is, only NFL football teams have a leather football.

13:41.257 --> 13:45.258
So if you find a plastic football in your backyard, those are really common.

13:45.298 --> 13:46.098
Those are everywhere.

13:46.498 --> 13:56.641
But if you find a leather football and one that's not too weathered, you better be scared because that's a sign that there might be a zoonosis about to happen and a football team is about to hammer you.

13:58.481 --> 14:02.542
Our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of

14:03.032 --> 14:14.368
good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

14:16.670 --> 14:19.171
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited to be here.

14:19.411 --> 14:20.611
It's a good day.

14:20.871 --> 14:22.231
It's gonna be a very good day.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.772
Mark already put out a nice show.

14:24.872 --> 14:29.353
Mark's work has just, our gears are meshing right now.

14:29.813 --> 14:39.515
And, you know, just anything, anywhere you look, you're looking in the right place now because you're asking the right questions.

14:40.536 --> 14:41.236
And it feels,

14:42.608 --> 14:44.429
It feels really special to be where we are.

14:44.890 --> 14:45.870
I'm not getting choked up.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.692
I'm trying not to burp from my coffee, I apologize.

14:50.153 --> 14:52.375
It's really fantastic where we are.

14:52.395 --> 14:56.617
I wake up in the morning, I'm excited and I'm optimistic and I think it's not for nothing.

14:57.638 --> 14:58.759
And I'm very thankful.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.761
I feel very grateful to be in the place that I am.

15:02.842 --> 15:08.405
I'm really thankful for a lot of people that have made this possible.

15:09.066 --> 15:10.407
There's some really special,

15:11.147 --> 15:20.273
people that have taken a huge risk on me and believing in me, even when, yeah, I don't know, maybe I was less than optimistic.

15:21.214 --> 15:23.476
And I probably will be less than optimistic again.

15:24.476 --> 15:30.841
But it's this unwavering level of support that makes this little ship float.

15:31.021 --> 15:33.943
And I'm just really glad to be here.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.545
I'm really proud to be here after so many years.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.686
So see you in a few minutes.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.115
I don't care how you get there.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.835
I don't care what you do to get there.

16:08.736 --> 16:09.396
The goal is to win.

16:14.188 --> 16:15.094
What time is it?

16:15.175 --> 16:15.900
Game time!

16:23.880 --> 16:25.662
I guess I'm going to be here already right now.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.324
I wasn't going to disappear anywhere.

16:27.424 --> 16:32.429
But this is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.533
It is an extraordinary place that we find ourselves.

16:38.255 --> 16:46.523
I don't know what to say other than I do think it's a very, very smart strategy to stay focused on learning biology as much as you can.

16:47.924 --> 16:53.828
And stay focused on learning things, reading things.

16:54.248 --> 16:59.531
Spending your time on thoughts that you choose and don't take their bait on social media.

16:59.591 --> 17:06.794
You can waste a lot of time and develop a lot of stress just by reading fake messages on social media.

17:06.995 --> 17:09.176
And that's a big risk that you take now.

17:09.816 --> 17:16.860
and using social media and your grind requires you to have neighbors that you trust, neighbors that you love.

17:16.900 --> 17:17.640
You need friends.

17:17.680 --> 17:23.863
You need to court and cultivate real relationships.

17:25.044 --> 17:36.190
And the relationship you have with me, I guess, is kind of a real relationship, but I really mean people that you can sit down with on your back porch and hug when they come over and hug when they leave.

17:37.650 --> 17:39.370
I'm missing a lot of that myself.

17:40.911 --> 17:46.412
And I'm working very hard to find a way to get off of social media while still using it against them.

17:47.052 --> 17:50.012
But right now I don't know if I'm accomplishing that.

17:50.192 --> 17:56.133
CHD has blocked me now, finally, on X. As have a few other people that have taken a long time to do it.

17:56.653 --> 18:05.055
And so now it just kind of seems more and more like, you know, you can be in the shouting part of the audience, but it doesn't really, really matter anymore.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.196
Because it's a fake place.

18:08.316 --> 18:10.097
Social media is a fake place.

18:11.218 --> 18:24.831
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

18:25.552 --> 18:27.594
Same goes for pandemics and gain-of-function.

18:27.634 --> 18:30.796
They're just turning up the heat with regard to protecting these myths.

18:31.837 --> 18:37.699
solidifying these myths and making sure that under duress we would pass these myths on to our children.

18:38.480 --> 18:47.863
So if you don't understand the trap, and that is that you are supposed to tell your children this, and then you will not understand why the cheese yet remains free.

18:48.363 --> 18:49.624
The way out is biology.

18:49.684 --> 18:57.407
We need to teach our kids this biology so that frauds like Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn are never ever

18:58.847 --> 19:03.891
allowed to sort of pass this stuff on using social media.

19:03.911 --> 19:04.692
They're going to be there.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.133
Social media is going to have them there.

19:07.694 --> 19:09.175
And we've got to stop that.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.637
We've got to make sure to stop that.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.198
And that's what GigaOM Biological is going to try to do.

19:15.159 --> 19:17.661
I guess I got to hit this.

19:18.922 --> 19:20.583
I think that's the best way to do it.

19:22.164 --> 19:23.025
I didn't think about that.

19:24.235 --> 19:29.280
Michiel, up in heaven, probably still really happy that I'm using his mix.

19:30.241 --> 19:35.566
Michiel is a friend of mine from Amsterdam, passed away at age 38.

19:36.807 --> 19:42.353
Nothing to do with COVID, but this is his mix that I often use in his honor.

19:42.533 --> 19:43.073
Great friend.

19:44.995 --> 19:46.597
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

19:46.617 --> 19:48.760
I'm Chief Biologist at Gig Owen Biological.

19:49.901 --> 19:53.005
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

19:53.686 --> 20:01.456
You can find my ideas sometimes obfuscated and half-represented here on a substack called Woodhouse 76.

20:03.399 --> 20:18.837
Woodhouse 76 is written by a trader in Chicago by the name of Jessica Hockett who meddled with myself and my family for a few months in 2023 and 24 along with some members of Panda including Nick Hudson and

20:19.790 --> 20:31.101
and Jonathan Engler, and they use my arguments poorly to have fake arguments with Claire Craig and Pierre Corey and Mike Eden and even Jay Bhattacharya, my former barbecue buddy.

20:31.121 --> 20:36.125
Yeah, it's remarkable where we are, but it's not to be.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.587
I don't think it's a bad thing.

20:38.627 --> 20:40.888
I think it's just where we are.

20:40.928 --> 20:43.349
I used to be a staff scientist for Children's Health Defense.

20:43.389 --> 20:46.990
I got that job because I helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.331
write the Wuhan cover-up book.

20:49.271 --> 20:52.693
I taught myself a lot of virology and biology during that time.

20:53.873 --> 21:02.037
And as a result, I've come to the conclusion that virology is a hoax, but not the hoax that the no-virus people have been telling us.

21:02.097 --> 21:07.900
The no-virus people are actually on the same team as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

21:07.880 --> 21:11.922
's advisors like Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland.

21:12.462 --> 21:18.685
You don't need to separate Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman and the Baileys from

21:19.305 --> 21:22.087
CHD, you just have to see them as part of the same show.

21:22.507 --> 21:26.550
It's all one Lollapalooza of liars, they're just all on different platforms.

21:26.570 --> 21:47.385
That's the reason why YouTube says that I don't have a sufficient channel history, but Sam Bailey is welcome to put as much content on YouTube as she wants to, because she is part of this bullshit narrative that is really essentially at the heart of the controlled demolition of America.

21:49.110 --> 21:53.572
And that's why I come to you as a multiracial American.

21:53.672 --> 21:57.054
And I oftentimes remind everybody that this is an American stream.

21:57.594 --> 22:01.296
If you are here for a while, you are at the top of the wave.

22:01.336 --> 22:05.959
And if not, you might be down there at the bottom with skilled TV watchers, skilled social media users.

22:06.619 --> 22:11.323
But definitely the message of GigaOM Biological is to stay focused on the biology we can know.

22:11.843 --> 22:14.365
Not take their bait on social media because it's awful.

22:14.925 --> 22:15.906
And to love your neighbor.

22:15.926 --> 22:17.367
I mean, actually, know who they are.

22:18.368 --> 22:21.591
And talk to them, even if they don't like Trump.

22:21.651 --> 22:26.795
Because actually, you're under a spell not that dissimilar to what people who don't like Trump.

22:27.155 --> 22:30.377
That's the same kind of spell, just a different side of it.

22:30.898 --> 22:32.099
It's just that magical.

22:32.739 --> 22:35.622
because it was put on you for that long.

22:36.182 --> 22:41.167
It's been years now that this enchantment has been cast and remains sustained.

22:41.247 --> 22:49.994
It's being cast all the time, even by some of us who don't know that by reading the script of a lab leak, we were enchanting people.

22:51.015 --> 22:54.699
The way that Gigo and Biological works is that this is really fueled by about 110 people.

22:56.380 --> 23:07.930
about 105 subscribers and three or four people that not only subscribe but also give larger monthly donations that I just I don't know what to say other than thank you very much.

23:09.111 --> 23:16.237
If you want to be a part of that team go to gigahomebiological.com you can find a support Giga Home button right there in the middle.

23:16.797 --> 23:19.319
Also there's a whole row of links at the top

23:20.020 --> 23:24.429
that include a link called Stuff, where you can find a lot of the things that I talk about.

23:24.449 --> 23:27.334
They're always there just in a chronological order.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.457
There's a schedule that...

23:29.457 --> 23:30.598
Not really following yet.

23:31.018 --> 23:34.622
There's ways to find us, and then there's of course ways to support us there.

23:35.302 --> 23:39.826
And every single one of you that is helping with that, I just can't thank you enough.

23:39.886 --> 23:46.052
This is really an amazing privilege to be a part of the independent bright web that we are establishing.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.754
I guess I'm the only channel so far.

23:48.474 --> 23:55.200
Mark has not officially adopted the moniker yet, because I guess he's actually my handler, so he's never gonna do that.

23:55.260 --> 23:55.741
But anyway.

23:57.122 --> 24:01.587
All joking aside, I'm gonna fade this out, try and get myself on screen here.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.310
I guess I already have that set up, so I could just go...

24:07.085 --> 24:28.970
So I have accused over the past week or so, and over the past years, a number of people of being basically scripted bullshit and reading scripted bullshit, even if it's just a small bit, some pieces of talking points and a few third rail words that you're not supposed to use or third rail people you're not supposed to mention.

24:29.750 --> 24:36.092
Brett Weinstein is my favorite example because he exhibits a lot of this sort of,

24:36.912 --> 24:50.699
overconfidence and certainty in himself and in his conclusions that leads me to believe that he has for a while been working on a script that he believes is part of the real plan the real narrative or

24:51.960 --> 24:55.683
a national security narrative that he has been entrusted to enforce.

24:56.124 --> 25:08.234
And either way, you would exhibit this sort of confident, you know, prison guard-like mentality that I know what's best for you and I know what's going on because I have all the keys.

25:08.795 --> 25:16.802
And so, without a doubt, both of these people are, to a certain extent, read in on the idea that they're important to America.

25:17.222 --> 25:19.364
They're important to Donald Trump.

25:19.404 --> 25:20.985
They're important to Elon Musk.

25:21.045 --> 25:23.026
They're important to somebody at Rumble.

25:23.447 --> 25:27.310
They're a valued Rumble producer, a valued locals customer.

25:27.850 --> 25:29.471
Our sponsors really like us.

25:29.952 --> 25:37.157
You know, something like that, that as a whole equation just kind of adds up to them thinking that they're actually doing something good.

25:37.758 --> 25:41.440
I don't necessarily think they're entirely evil.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.081
However,

25:44.679 --> 25:55.410
I do think that Brett knows that he has gotten in the way of and stolen the ideas of many people in the course of this five years.

25:55.610 --> 26:04.358
And on purpose, sort of given that job, almost like they took him aside, you know, like Elon Musk and Joe Rogan.

26:05.359 --> 26:07.600
and Robert Malone and Peter Thiel.

26:08.041 --> 26:11.662
And they all sat him down on a boat somewhere and said, hey, you know what we need you to do?

26:12.323 --> 26:23.049
We need you to steal the ideas that we feed you to represent them as your own and keep this narrative on trail and on track because we've got a pretty big problem.

26:23.629 --> 26:29.072
And we got this anti-vax movement and we thought we had it under control with Bobby Kennedy, but actually we don't.

26:32.918 --> 26:34.360
That's that's where we were.

26:34.420 --> 26:44.890
That's the reason why Sam Harris was on Joe Rogan, you know, Joe Rogan on on Brett Weinstein's eighth podcast, eighth podcast.

26:44.910 --> 26:51.457
You see, they realized very quickly at the start of, let's say, 2019.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.860
that they were in a position not to run a pandemic.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.680
They didn't have everything ready to go yet.

26:58.860 --> 27:01.341
Everything was not going very smoothly.

27:01.401 --> 27:10.483
So they started putting a bunch of people in place in 2019 in a way that can only be seen as a military operation.

27:10.563 --> 27:22.145
The people, the way that they started podcasting, the way they knew they had to podcast, identified the podcast, the podcast, identified the podcast,

27:22.905 --> 27:31.092
as the medium by which the narrative would need to be controlled once the narrative was in need of controlling.

27:34.135 --> 27:38.038
It's not by accident, okay, that that happened.

27:38.158 --> 27:44.884
Now, on the other hand, you're going to have to believe that my track record on YouTube is by accident.

27:45.605 --> 27:47.126
And I'm asking you to believe that.

27:47.206 --> 27:48.107
That is the truth.

27:48.939 --> 28:08.006
But the difference would be that my appearance on YouTube and conversion to the LabLeak discussion and the LabLeak mystery solving exercise had a lot to do with the reaction to my speculation about it by my own university.

28:11.314 --> 28:19.461
In no way, shape or form can Brett Weinstein claim that he was doing something else on YouTube when the pandemic started.

28:20.622 --> 28:23.284
He just started, it was his eighth podcast.

28:24.425 --> 28:27.787
I already had 20 plus podcasts that all had one theme.

28:28.268 --> 28:33.512
I was riding my bike to work, doing journal club on my bike about neuroscience papers.

28:36.354 --> 28:37.795
And so I was,

28:39.065 --> 28:54.815
innocently enough trying to do something on social media that used my bike ride that I could maybe argue made my CV somewhat interesting from a tenure perspective, from a teaching perspective, from a teaching faculty perspective.

28:54.875 --> 29:03.760
I'd already given in to the idea that I wasn't gonna be some kind of R01 grant administering soon to be associate professor.

29:03.880 --> 29:08.123
I was looking for a way to transition into kind of like

29:08.743 --> 29:17.950
permanent research assistant professor where I could do, you know, microscope work and teach and supervise grad students while I taught a few courses for money.

29:18.410 --> 29:19.411
Like, extra money.

29:19.451 --> 29:25.735
That's the highest goals that I had at that point, and I thought YouTube would be a cool way to do it.

29:27.957 --> 29:29.137
Now, I enjoyed it.

29:29.558 --> 29:30.498
I liked it a lot.

29:31.039 --> 29:32.680
I edited all my own videos.

29:35.134 --> 29:38.996
What you see here and what you see on YouTube is a trap.

29:39.377 --> 29:43.419
It is no different than cable TV with 400 channels.

29:45.240 --> 29:56.667
It is an elaborate team of performers with costumes all on the same basic script, or at least a script provided by the same sources with the same underlying motivations.

29:56.807 --> 29:59.749
And it's not just a few of these guys, it's hundreds of them.

30:00.409 --> 30:02.851
They can make you believe anything.

30:03.737 --> 30:07.418
including that they need help stopping and starting the train.

30:07.518 --> 30:09.618
Please grab a pair of gloves and help us.

30:12.279 --> 30:17.620
That's the illusion that they are able to cast using social media in any context.

30:19.061 --> 30:20.561
They want you to vote Republican.

30:21.281 --> 30:24.282
They want you to oppose the World Health Organization.

30:24.702 --> 30:26.682
They want you to buy Jordan shoes.

30:28.143 --> 30:29.663
It's all the same show.

30:30.885 --> 30:40.209
And they can put YouTube channels out there that just happen to cover that shoes, those shoes, and cut them in half and say how amazing this new pair of Jordans is.

30:40.670 --> 30:47.893
And at the same time, there can be some random podcast about football that also says, hey, by the way, did you see those new Jordans?

30:47.913 --> 30:48.633
Those are crazy.

30:51.254 --> 30:56.657
And so by the time you've been on social media for a week, it seems like everybody's decided to buy the new Jordans.

30:59.963 --> 31:04.966
Or it seems like everybody is worried about the people that are falling down in China.

31:05.387 --> 31:06.827
On the sidewalk, did you see that?

31:06.988 --> 31:07.988
One was in the mall.

31:14.713 --> 31:17.254
That's how they pulled the pandemic off.

31:17.534 --> 31:24.139
And one of the reasons why they pulled this off was because the FDA needs getting rid of.

31:25.100 --> 31:44.128
And so one of the main goals of the pandemic was to fully discredit the FDA as an institution, fully discredit its mandate to provide safe and effective products that the labels are correct, and the claims that are made on the labels are correct.

31:46.604 --> 31:57.769
They need to get rid of that organization because that organization and its mandate over medical devices essentially is one of the ways that the entire pandemic narrative could be erased.

31:59.076 --> 32:26.548
If the authority of the FDA was used to reinvestigate, to open all of the files about all of the PCR tests that were used in 2020, we could dispel the mythology that there was ever anything and realize that, holy shit, we gave 220 EUAs to PCR tests, many of which were produced in China, that could have never been specific for any one

32:27.543 --> 32:41.011
like genetic signal because they only had one amplicon in them and that amplicon was only 300 amino acids long and that could be from anything because there's an irreducibly complex background of bacterial signals.

32:44.502 --> 33:01.335
that many of which could have that small segment of genetic code in them somewhere, or one close enough related to it that the primers will pull up a fluorescent signal that you'll call positive because these are all proprietary tests with no controls.

33:03.477 --> 33:08.541
And at the time during the pandemic, when these guys were doing streams together for three years, 21, 22,

33:11.479 --> 33:19.727
They never questioned the PCR once, just in the same way that Kevin McCairn and Jessica Rose never questioned the PCR once.

33:21.348 --> 33:30.817
And the only people that did question the PCR talked about overcycling over and over and over again, as if overcycling was the only way that PCR could be used nefariously.

33:34.847 --> 33:40.133
And so we are here right now where two of the three of these clowns are directly at the top of the FDA.

33:40.513 --> 33:51.746
Maybe the FDA doesn't need to be destroyed if you just put people who will do what they're told at the top of the FDA and only regulate the things that they are told to regulate at the top of the FDA.

33:54.178 --> 34:21.915
Wouldn't it be really strange if the head of the FDA hired somebody to be the head of the Biologics Evaluation and Research Group, you know, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, that guy, if he put that guy in charge of that stuff, and that guy actually thought that we would be better off without the FDA, wouldn't that be weird?

34:22.697 --> 34:23.978
I think that would be pretty weird.

34:26.799 --> 34:38.885
Look, I think there's a really good explanation for why these people are where they are, why these people were where they are in my life for the last five years, why some of them paid me, why some of them lied about me.

34:39.758 --> 34:56.845
why some of them stole my ideas, why some of them have ridiculed me even up until today on X. I don't know if it's visible to anybody else but me, but this guy in Jikki Leaks were actually making fun of me today, asking me where the canisters for the clones were sprayed are.

34:57.505 --> 34:58.305
I shit you not.

34:59.206 --> 35:07.049
And that is only because we have them dead on, balls accurate, exactly where they are.

35:08.103 --> 35:12.505
They are traders, or at least in my mind, they are traders.

35:12.545 --> 35:26.711
They are probably national security agents working for some part of the government or some part of NATO that has a international mandate to go around the world and make sure that everybody believes in viruses, gain-of-function viruses, and DNA contamination.

35:27.631 --> 35:32.533
And that nobody in the world ever uses transfection to describe what these products always were.

35:35.373 --> 35:38.914
But he's related to them makes it really weird, doesn't it?

35:39.414 --> 35:51.537
The idea that this is all one malevolent show that seems to be a really easy way to unite the extremists from all the different sides into one weird conservative movement that we could use to do it.

35:51.597 --> 35:52.757
It's like herding cats.

35:53.437 --> 35:55.798
It's just like herding cats.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.386
So most people know me as a US presidential candidate.

36:06.827 --> 36:08.990
You probably hadn't heard of me before that, most of you at least.

36:09.591 --> 36:15.359
But actually before that, my prior career, I had started an asset management firm called Strive to compete against BlackRock.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.702
But before that, I was a biotech entrepreneur.

36:18.639 --> 36:27.383
Okay, so what you're supposed to believe is that before he started a hedge fund that was supposed to compete with BlackRock, he was a biotech entrepreneur.

36:27.803 --> 36:30.225
And so basically, he just works harder than you.

36:31.065 --> 36:34.907
Money happens a lot more often and much bigger for him than for you.

36:35.507 --> 36:39.750
Despite all, you know, you just don't put the hours in that this billionaire does.

36:40.210 --> 36:40.911
That's the thing.

36:41.251 --> 36:43.212
He's just gonna say, you know, it's tough.

36:43.232 --> 36:47.034
You know, some people are just good at stuff and I'm just good at stuff.

36:47.495 --> 36:49.396
And I ran for president in America.

36:49.456 --> 36:52.678
And that, what that really is, is just making fun of you.

36:53.699 --> 37:00.143
Making fun of me, making fun of Mark, making fun of all Americans because this guy ran for president.

37:01.004 --> 37:02.244
He's much better than us.

37:02.304 --> 37:03.205
He's a billionaire.

37:03.245 --> 37:09.166
He's like 10,000 times more successful on average per day than any of us are.

37:09.246 --> 37:09.946
Think about that.

37:10.767 --> 37:15.668
On average, he's 10,000 times more successful per day than we are.

37:16.068 --> 37:22.550
And that's just because he's really smart, really hardworking, and he showed up more than you did.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.511
Kept his arms much straighter than you.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.217
Founded a biotech company called Royven.

37:28.697 --> 37:30.339
I led it as CEO for seven years.

37:30.439 --> 37:30.919
Founded it in 2014.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.281
Today, the company just had its 10 year anniversary.

37:34.341 --> 37:40.565
More recently, earlier this month, I've overseen the development of five medicines, five of which went on to become FDA approved.

37:40.986 --> 37:44.068
He's overseen the development of five medicines.

37:44.108 --> 37:55.215
You know, it's like the guy who says that I oversee the company that digs tunnels and the company that flies rockets and the company that floats satellites and the company that

37:57.036 --> 38:03.198
builds electric cars and really, really dumb stainless steel trucks.

38:03.778 --> 38:05.098
Like, come on!

38:05.238 --> 38:12.620
The only idea, I believe, is actually Elon Musk's is the electric stainless steel truck.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.861
That thing has Elon Musk written all over it.

38:16.141 --> 38:25.303
Many more which failed along the way, but I have interacted with the FDA, and I know something about the FDA, like most people in the pharmaceutical industry do, but they're not allowed to talk about it.

38:25.967 --> 38:32.813
Here's what one of the dirtiest little secrets is in the pharmaceutical industry is an old adage that goes FDA never forgets.

38:33.533 --> 38:39.218
If you criticize the FDA, you know you can expect adverse consequences in response.

38:39.519 --> 38:43.582
Does that mean they're not going to approve your drug when it comes up to the time of approval?

38:43.602 --> 38:45.484
Actually, it's far more insidious than that.

38:46.104 --> 38:47.266
Most people don't understand this.

38:47.306 --> 38:54.054
It's not like the FDA just makes a decision on the back end after you've done all of your trial work, deciding on the back end of whether or not it gets approved.

38:54.074 --> 38:57.198
Now remember, what we're saying is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

38:57.158 --> 39:00.963
's father was involved in the formation of the FDA.

39:01.684 --> 39:14.294
and that the formation of the FDA even revolved around the original thalidomide scandal in Denmark, so much so that Brett Weinstein's father actually seems to have gone to Denmark at that time as part of this whole investigation.

39:14.834 --> 39:22.780
A guy by the name of Estes Kieffhofer was a senior senator at the time, also a major driver in the formation of the FDA.

39:22.900 --> 39:29.225
One might be able to argue, depending on how you read history, that Estes Kieffhofer wanted the FDA to be a much more

39:29.885 --> 39:43.977
strict and powerful organization that it ended up being, but nevertheless, Les Weinstein, the father of Brett and Eric Weinstein, Eric Weinstein being a financial advisor to Peter Thiel, these guys

39:45.939 --> 39:55.624
are now on the dark web, on the internet, telling us what to think, arguing about what to think, leading the way, rescuing the republic from the conservative side, I guess.

39:56.344 --> 40:05.329
And at the same time being made fun of by the other side, being pointed at as obvious goofballs by the other side, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:05.349 --> 40:13.854
is being pointed at as an obvious goofball recovering addict, not to be taken seriously, is very, very well done.

40:14.674 --> 40:22.320
on the other side now maybe if you think about may 29th 2024 this guy doing a podcast why do billionaires do podcasts

40:27.426 --> 40:30.487
If I was a billionaire, I assure you, I wouldn't be doing this anymore.

40:30.967 --> 40:35.108
I would find lots of other people to do this stuff and script them and tell them what to do.

40:36.148 --> 40:55.332
I wouldn't myself be a podcaster as a billionaire, unless I was paid to do it, told to do it, a government agent doing it as part of using social media, making social media relevant enough so that it becomes the new mainstream media.

40:56.431 --> 40:57.632
That's what you see here.

40:58.052 --> 41:05.236
Somebody trying to do his best for the ruling class, the overclass that wants this power shift to occur.

41:06.016 --> 41:14.401
And he's gonna get all the benefits of the programming of these platforms that he's on, because again, as long as you're with him, then you're with him.

41:15.620 --> 41:19.922
Otherwise, you can't explain why somebody like this would do a podcast in the first place.

41:19.982 --> 41:22.363
Does he really love being on camera so much?

41:22.803 --> 41:32.828
Does he really believe he has such a message that, you know, talking about the FDA and explaining how corrupt of an organization it is is so important that he can't pay somebody else to do it?

41:32.848 --> 41:33.969
He's got to do it himself?

41:34.429 --> 41:37.510
After failing to run for president, why would he do what?

41:38.551 --> 41:39.631
He ran for president.

41:39.671 --> 41:42.773
I mean, it's, when you think about it now, when you see it,

41:43.772 --> 41:49.426
As Mark Kulak has, where, where did all these Indians come from?

41:50.708 --> 41:51.188
proved or not.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.329
It's not a binary question.

41:53.069 --> 42:09.794
Turns out the entire process, all the way from the conception of your idea in a lab, your preclinical testing, all the way to testing in animals, all the way to the early human testing in healthy volunteers, to patients, all of that, every little microstep, is actually gatekept by the FDA.

42:10.395 --> 42:16.897
So if you do something the FDA doesn't like, they will actually blackball you at every step along the way in a manner that will never be visible to the public.

42:17.277 --> 42:19.958
It's not going to be some sort of politically palpable

42:21.101 --> 42:23.662
approval decision at the end to say they rejected your drug.

42:23.682 --> 42:24.583
That's not how it works.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.885
And this is a perfect example of how the deep state works more broadly.

42:28.345 --> 42:33.828
Works not through a bang, but through a whimper, through the boring motions of the administrative process.

42:33.908 --> 42:37.770
So now he's using the term deep state to talk about what?

42:38.690 --> 42:39.831
To talk about the U.S.

42:39.911 --> 42:41.332
government?

42:41.532 --> 42:44.994
See how this imprecision actually works against us?

42:45.902 --> 43:00.796
because if you realize how many people, 700,000 subscribers on YouTube, 500,000 people seeing his videos, that's a lot of people that are allowing him to put dumb thoughts in their head for 20 minutes.

43:03.370 --> 43:08.434
through the technocracy, they bore you into actually effectuating their own agenda.

43:08.734 --> 43:10.956
Now, what could criticizing the FDA include?

43:10.996 --> 43:11.797
Here's one example.

43:12.477 --> 43:22.445
President Trump actually saw through a law and saw it through into passage that expanded the right to try, the idea that you as a patient had a right to try a therapy, even if it wasn't approved.

43:22.866 --> 43:23.426
I believe in this.

43:23.826 --> 43:25.067
This is part of medical choice.

43:25.588 --> 43:28.190
We've talked a lot about medical choice in the last several years.

43:28.510 --> 43:30.932
Medical choice is an illusion.

43:30.992 --> 43:44.961
It's a mythology used to make sure that nobody ever usefully questions the public health as a reason or an answer, that nobody ever questions virology as a science, and that nobody ever questions intramuscular injection as a methodology.

43:45.041 --> 43:48.523
It's so easy to see, it's kind of brutal.

43:50.213 --> 43:53.094
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID vaccines.

43:53.134 --> 43:58.475
And in that context, medical choice means that I shouldn't have to take something just because the FDA has approved it.

43:59.175 --> 44:19.141
But the mirror image of medical choice, which I also believe in equally, is that just because the FDA hasn't approved something doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to take it if you want to make a decision for yourself about what the health consequences are or aren't to you, especially for life-saving therapies or potentially life-saving therapies that people are otherwise desperately denied if they haven't been through the FDA process.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.482
What if I tell you this, for example?

44:23.403 --> 44:32.108
I just want to throw this out there because it's an interesting debate to have, but maybe something you can have with your friends.

44:32.789 --> 44:41.974
Sit at the fire and realize that in some states in America, it's not required to wear a motorcycle helmet.

44:42.835 --> 44:46.117
And in other states, it's required to wear a motorcycle helmet.

44:47.424 --> 44:56.471
Imagine the idea that you're allowed to make that choice or you're not allowed to make that choice and what arguments you might make about the choice or not the choice.

44:56.651 --> 45:05.418
And then later on in the program, remind me about motorcycle helmets and I'll see if I can remember these arguments that I'm thinking in my head right now because they're useful.

45:05.898 --> 45:07.600
But first, digest that problem.

45:08.308 --> 45:15.275
While we're listening to this, think about the idea of mandating motorcycle helmets and why you would do it.

45:15.576 --> 45:25.326
Because I have a good reason why you should mandate motorcycle helmets that have nothing to do with protecting the rider and the rider's head.

45:25.706 --> 45:26.287
How about that?

45:27.369 --> 45:28.550
At least not directly.

45:28.650 --> 45:38.714
That's not the reason why you protect the motorcycle rider's head is not for the motorcycle rider himself or herself.

45:38.794 --> 45:39.915
Think about that for a minute.

45:40.535 --> 45:44.857
So President Trump, I think, correctly passed and signed into law a statute that expanded the right to try.

45:45.618 --> 45:46.618
But then there's something mysterious.

45:46.818 --> 45:49.419
Is this guy running for a governor of Ohio?

45:49.519 --> 45:52.841
Holy shit, that would be terrible to happen.

45:53.823 --> 46:00.586
None of the biotech companies, none of the pharmaceutical companies were actually making their therapies available for the right to try, even for patients who wanted to try them.

46:00.987 --> 46:01.247
Why?

46:01.267 --> 46:05.429
The dirty little secret is the FDA hates this law.

46:05.909 --> 46:14.373
They hate the existence of this law because it creates an alternative road, an alternative path that allows patients and innovators to sidestep the FDA.

46:14.914 --> 46:21.237
And they hate that, so effectively what they, through the back door, transmitted subliminally and indirectly

46:21.977 --> 46:38.168
and perhaps even directly to industry, was the idea that if you use this to make your therapy available, you will face the consequences, not only when you try to get approval for that very therapy through the main process, but even for any other therapy that comes in through the IND, the Investigational New Drug Application process in the first place.

46:38.688 --> 46:41.890
That is the retribution of the administrative state, such as the FDA.

46:42.151 --> 46:44.092
You see it in three-letter agencies across the board.

46:44.633 --> 46:57.870
And so now he's got a whole list of questions that you should be asking, a whole list of potential corruption you're supposed to be considering, a whole complex web of things that include IND, the independent new drug.

46:59.955 --> 47:02.678
It's all an elaborate mythology.

47:02.738 --> 47:04.699
It's all an elaborate enchantment.

47:04.780 --> 47:15.750
In this case, this is the stupid complicated version where he's going to try and bombard you with data and with names and with acronyms to make you feel like you can't understand.

47:15.810 --> 47:18.192
This is just an ugly administrative process.

47:18.232 --> 47:22.195
The FDA's freaking mandate is very, very simple.

47:22.816 --> 47:29.121
Primarily, they're supposed to make sure that what's on the label is in the bottle and that what's claimed on the label is actually true.

47:29.902 --> 47:33.144
That's not the perfect way to say it, but that's pretty close.

47:33.625 --> 47:50.659
And so if you don't want an organization whose primary mandate is that, and instead you're arguing about all these other issues about the approval process and how long it takes and whatever, the main thing you're getting approved is what are you putting on the label?

47:50.699 --> 47:52.260
What are you claiming it can do?

47:53.240 --> 47:54.661
What are you claiming it does?

47:57.982 --> 48:00.122
That's what the approval process is about.

48:00.263 --> 48:06.465
So think about that as we move forward with regard to this video and what they say.

48:06.665 --> 48:12.607
Countless other three-letter agencies that will come after you if you dare to sue them for questioning one of their regulations.

48:12.967 --> 48:18.089
But today we're gonna actually focus on the, what I call failed drug administration, the FDA.

48:18.959 --> 48:22.320
and ask a question that I think is obvious and ought to be asked.

48:22.340 --> 48:24.081
It's at least a question that deserves to be debated.

48:24.981 --> 48:26.942
Are we or are we not better off?

48:27.342 --> 48:32.843
Are Americans actually better off today because of the existence of the FDA?

48:33.364 --> 48:34.004
They could fill in the blank.

48:34.024 --> 48:37.625
You should be able to ask the same question of the CDC, of the NIH.

48:38.005 --> 48:40.486
You could ask it of countless other administrative agencies too.

48:41.306 --> 48:47.328
But for today's topic, we're gonna focus on the health-focused agencies, particularly with a special focus on the FDA.

48:47.929 --> 48:55.212
Are American patients better off or are they worse off because of the existence and the mandate of the FDA?

48:55.272 --> 48:59.693
Are prescription drug prices higher today because of the FDA?

48:59.833 --> 49:01.334
The answer to that question is absolutely yes.

49:01.694 --> 49:03.315
I mean, there's no doubt about that fact.

49:03.735 --> 49:05.336
The FDA is a gatekeeper to competition.

49:05.856 --> 49:15.122
The fact that they're a gatekeeper to competition is used, you could say exploited, but I'll just say used by the pharmaceutical industry to be able to forestall further competition to their own drug.

49:15.262 --> 49:17.444
This does not have to be untrue.

49:17.524 --> 49:23.808
This could be true as part of his 90% true stuff that he's saying here, but in the end,

49:24.688 --> 49:49.172
remember this is a charlatan and we're going to hear a lot of bullshit that mostly will be big ideas about why the FDA he's already told you that maybe the FDA is something we don't need in the law maybe it's worse for us and in certain categories where they know the payers are going to pay for it even when there is competition then they'll use the FDA in those categories say in the category of cancer drugs to be able to shepherd drugs through because there they're going to get the minimal price it's paid for anyway

49:49.552 --> 50:04.405
But in other areas, they actually use the FDA as a gatekeeper to make sure that they're insulated from competition from drugs that can be made by compounding pharmacies or even generics providers, that the FDA is able to serve as a regulatory technocratically stamped

50:05.248 --> 50:11.854
regulatorily accepted gatekeeper to preserving the absence of competition, which actually drives up prescription drug prices.

50:12.134 --> 50:14.956
So prices are higher, but what are we getting in return?

50:15.597 --> 50:18.159
They say the thing we get is that we have the gold standard in the world.

50:18.499 --> 50:25.245
The FDA approval, that seal of approval, means that we can actually trust what's behind that medicine, and that's worth those higher prices.

50:25.545 --> 50:26.806
That's worth those delays.

50:26.846 --> 50:27.527
That's how the argument goes.

50:28.948 --> 50:47.995
But it's fascinating then that the same agency that has said for years that you cannot have a safely developed drug or vaccine, unless it has been through 10 years of testing, on average, a billion dollars or more for the development of each of those drugs or vaccines, that you cannot even have the right to try that medication or that vaccine for yourself.

50:48.315 --> 50:56.378
It would be too dangerous if it hadn't gone through that process, that that same agency is the one that shepherded right through the process of X.

50:56.818 --> 50:58.419
How does the stream look on Twitch?

50:58.499 --> 51:00.939
It looked like the chat disconnected for a second.

51:00.979 --> 51:02.800
Am I still okay on timing?

51:02.860 --> 51:04.181
I think people are messing with us.

51:04.221 --> 51:05.021
We're gonna keep going.

51:05.361 --> 51:18.585
...scene that was developed in a matter of nine months, which then the federal government not only made available and said that you have an opportunity to use, despite the fact that it only was developed in nine months, but that you have no choice but not to take after it was developed for just nine months.

51:18.605 --> 51:21.726
You can't believe... Can you believe what he's doing here?

51:21.806 --> 51:25.768
The list of dumb questions and the combination in which he's applying them?

51:26.608 --> 51:33.197
Now he's suggesting that the FDA approving the vaccines is what made them possible to be mandated.

51:33.658 --> 51:42.750
It has nothing to do with the murder in hospitals being misconstrued as an ongoing, perhaps worst case scenario that could result in a billion people dead.

51:45.317 --> 52:04.871
It is crazy to think that now, just like Kevin McKernan tried to blame the lack of PCR testing on the FDA in 2020 and made the EUA 10-page application just a lead weight on, we could have already solved this pandemic if the FDA weren't in the way.

52:04.891 --> 52:13.817
And six years later, this is five years later, I guess, you have a former candidate for president

52:14.830 --> 52:21.652
super clown, Vivek, telling you that you need to consider whether or not the FDA is even helping us anymore.

52:23.093 --> 52:29.975
How more dead on balls accurate could Mark and I be when we said that, wow, maybe this is a lot about the FDA.

52:30.035 --> 52:32.216
Maybe it has something to do with intellectual property.

52:32.636 --> 52:40.419
Maybe that explains why Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Steve Bannon and Aaron Seery are all involved in this.

52:40.639 --> 52:40.939
Hmm.

52:42.100 --> 52:45.025
and Brett Weinstein's frigging dad.

52:45.646 --> 52:46.427
Come on.

52:48.290 --> 52:49.853
Both of these things at the same time.

52:50.614 --> 52:56.324
And the reason I'm so fascinated by the FDA is not only because it's an industry that I've dealt with, it's an agency that I've dealt with firsthand.

52:57.625 --> 53:02.246
But even more deeply, it's an emblem of how the administrative state works.

53:02.706 --> 53:08.567
Wrapping around fundamentally political questions, normative questions, questions relating to values, actually.

53:08.627 --> 53:11.548
What are the trade-offs of making a therapy available or not?

53:11.648 --> 53:16.209
What is the proper role for an expert in adjudicating the way a doctor treats a patient?

53:16.809 --> 53:20.970
To wrap those fundamentally normative questions, questions of values,

53:21.826 --> 53:26.348
with a technocratic veneer to say that there is one scientific answer to that question.

53:26.988 --> 53:36.931
And there are a few things that bother me more than the bastardization of science by using it as a cloak to advance what is fundamentally a political or normative choice.

53:37.131 --> 53:43.114
Wow, I've never heard him so clearly as a massive bullshitter that I'm hearing right now.

53:44.514 --> 53:45.555
This is shocking.

53:46.876 --> 53:54.942
There are certain questions that are answered by science through the empirical process, through the scientific method, that are the kinds of questions that are answered empirically.

53:55.402 --> 54:01.987
But the question of whether or not drug prices should or should not be higher in favor of consumer choice, those are questions of trade-offs.

54:02.007 --> 54:09.093
Those are policy questions that are not answered by science, but are supposed to be in our country answered by the people.

54:09.893 --> 54:28.389
And the rise of this three-letter technocracy, the modern administrative state, including the alphabet soup from CDC to NIH to FDA, is the rise of a new class of quasi-monarch technocrats who... You see there's some subtle neuro-linguistic programming tricks and language tricks that he uses in there.

54:29.670 --> 54:33.653
Not that dissimilar to the speech pattern of somebody like Tucker Carlson.

54:35.074 --> 54:37.136
The NIH, the FDA, the CDC.

54:38.277 --> 54:56.173
it's very it's very disturbing how rehearsed this is and it's gross because now what you should see is a traitor what you should see is a purposeful fraud somebody who accepted a role a character to play with nefarious

54:57.912 --> 54:59.692
you know, traitorous goals.

54:59.712 --> 55:00.493
There's no way.

55:01.053 --> 55:04.394
There's no way to argue that this guy is a patriotic American.

55:04.414 --> 55:06.354
There's absolutely no way to argue that.

55:07.014 --> 55:09.415
This is a traitor.

55:10.335 --> 55:11.876
If he's an American, he's a traitor.

55:12.016 --> 55:19.277
And if he's a foreigner, then he is a saboteur and a conspirator and somebody who needs to be in jail.

55:19.898 --> 55:25.239
Reject the idea that we, the people, are supposed to create the policies that govern ourselves.

55:26.075 --> 55:30.059
And so for that discussion today, we're going to talk about other agencies in other episodes.

55:30.119 --> 55:37.145
But for today, with that focus on the FDA, and a little bit of the CDC, I've brought on somebody who I haven't actually met before directly.

55:37.805 --> 55:39.667
But I've been following him on social media for some time.

55:39.687 --> 55:41.749
He caught my attention during the presidential campaign.

55:42.229 --> 55:44.391
I liked a lot of what he had to say about the FDA.

55:44.431 --> 55:44.972
It was brave.

55:44.992 --> 55:45.692
He's a physician.

55:46.273 --> 55:50.957
He's a trained reader of the scientific literature and is unafraid to talk about it.

55:51.497 --> 55:52.298
Dr. Vinay Prasad.

55:55.216 --> 55:56.777
Binet, it's great to have you on the podcast.

55:57.138 --> 55:59.900
Welcome, and I'm excited to hear what you have to say today.

56:00.261 --> 56:11.691
The only thing I would say is, and I know I don't need to tell you this, but we're talking about a subject that most people are very careful to dance around, especially from the medical profession, especially from scientific backgrounds.

56:12.151 --> 56:15.194
And all I would say is, don't worry about couching what you have to say.

56:16.675 --> 56:17.836
Open up and tell us what you think.

56:17.856 --> 56:20.639
So good to have you on, and I'm excited to have this conversation.

56:21.544 --> 56:22.144
It's great to be here.

56:22.184 --> 56:22.945
Thanks for having me.

56:23.185 --> 56:27.726
And I just want to bolster one of the points you were making, which I think was a very good point about right to try.

56:28.327 --> 56:47.074
Now, one of the ways in which FDA actually, I think, prevented companies from being willing to participate in right to try was that they told companies that if you were to make your products available to people through the right to try pathway, and if something subsequently bad happened to those people, whether it was attributable to your product or not, we're going to hold those safety signals

56:47.614 --> 56:49.715
potentially against your application in the future.

56:50.195 --> 56:59.579
So they really gave them a huge disincentive to participate in Right to Try, which has effectively, as you point out, prevented the passage and the implementation of Right to Try.

56:59.959 --> 57:07.762
Now, I think people can debate whether or not you ought to have Right to Try, but as you point out, it was passed through a political process, and it's being subverted by the administrative states.

57:07.782 --> 57:08.542
I think that is accurate.

57:08.982 --> 57:11.384
I think it's worth people knowing who they're hearing from.

57:11.884 --> 57:14.265
I think that you're a trained physician.

57:14.485 --> 57:17.788
You have a detailed, I think, respectable background.

57:17.828 --> 57:20.449
But why don't you just share a bit of your background?

57:20.469 --> 57:21.550
You're not a political actor.

57:21.630 --> 57:26.053
And I think it's worth people understanding where you're coming from first before we dive into some thorny questions.

57:26.949 --> 57:31.270
Sure, so by way of background, I'm a professor here at the University of California, San Francisco.

57:31.290 --> 57:43.614
I'm actually a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and I run a research laboratory where we study drug policy, drug regulation, evidence-based medicine, clinical trials through a purely, I think, scientific lens.

57:43.914 --> 57:46.955
Okay, so he doesn't actually do science science.

57:48.356 --> 57:56.338
Maybe he practices some form of oncology, which might just mean poisoning people to see if you can make them better by killing their cancer before you kill them.

57:58.507 --> 58:06.314
But he works in a biostatistics department, which is not that dissimilar to like, you know, say Jessica Rose, who's a biostatistician.

58:07.575 --> 58:18.605
It's not that dissimilar to a lot of these people who are pretending that somehow or another, a combination of modeling and AI will get us past a lot of these problems.

58:20.146 --> 58:21.147
This is an actor.

58:23.848 --> 58:34.975
who's now at the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA.

58:35.796 --> 58:37.117
I'm also a practicing doctor.

58:37.177 --> 58:38.938
I happen to be a hematologist oncologist.

58:38.998 --> 58:46.703
I work here at the County Hospital, which is our safety net hospital where we take care of pretty much anyone who walks through the door here in San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital.

58:47.344 --> 58:51.827
And I've been in academic medicine since I finished my training about 10 years ago.

58:54.011 --> 59:02.554
Yeah, so what is it that made you as outspoken as you've been, especially in the wake of the COVID policy backlash that we saw?

59:02.614 --> 59:22.962
I'd love to understand what got a guy like you to be a much more public-facing figure that you- A public-facing figure taking no risks at all, in fact, put in place and encouraged to take those risks on YouTube with ZDogg because there was an opportunity to be placed at the FDA

59:23.662 --> 59:24.763
and help ruin it.

59:27.246 --> 59:34.432
That's what you see right here, right now, and I can tell you, you will be surprised at how right we were.

59:38.100 --> 59:45.706
Well, I mean, I think I sort of share your core philosophy that in America right now, it's important for people to just state and articulate your view.

59:45.766 --> 59:52.651
If you feel something and you believe in it and you have a point of view and you have some basis for your point of view, we don't want people to suppress those point of view.

59:52.891 --> 59:55.453
We don't want people to feel stigmatized for expressing that.

59:55.733 --> 01:00:00.037
We'll be better off if everyone just expresses their point of view and articulates it and tries to defend it.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.778
I think we'd have a more vibrant discussion.

01:00:02.118 --> 01:00:06.842
And the center point, I think, of public discourse will move from where the elites want us to be

01:00:07.182 --> 01:00:09.063
to where I think the body politic actually is.

01:00:09.103 --> 01:00:10.524
And I think that's important.

01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:12.866
Now, I just wanna tell your listeners a little bit.

01:00:12.886 --> 01:00:18.549
So the elites do exist, even in the mind of Vinay Prasad, and we are fighting them, which is really just.

01:00:18.969 --> 01:00:20.310
Stop lying.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.572
Gosh, this is just gross already, but we've gotta do it.

01:00:23.612 --> 01:00:24.953
This is work we have to do.

01:00:25.013 --> 01:00:35.160
This guy is at one of the highest posts and most important posts in the FDA with regard to the possibility of using whatever's left of the FDA and its mandate

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:42.363
to finally roll back history on the absolute fraud that occurred in 2020, 21, and 22.

01:00:42.884 --> 01:00:48.827
These guys are at the FDA right now with the intent purpose of not doing that, I assure you.

01:00:50.302 --> 01:00:50.602
little bit.

01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:59.847
Some of the issues on COVID-19 policy that I was outspoken about to me are just such basic common sense, it would be ridiculous for a doctor not to be outspoken about it.

01:01:00.487 --> 01:01:12.333
One example I think is I was extremely critical of the CDC's policy decision to make two-year-olds wear cloth masks, which was done in the United States, but not done anywhere else in the world, not done in Europe, not done in Australia.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:21.146
To me, that struck me as a extremely reckless decision that's based on poor evidence and runs counter to common sense when you see a two-year-old wearing a cloth mask.

01:01:21.347 --> 01:01:24.372
This guy has his shtick down very well.

01:01:24.452 --> 01:01:26.755
He is very confident of where he's going.

01:01:27.816 --> 01:01:45.847
And if you can see it relative to his earlier performances with ZDogg when he wasn't very sure and had to look at the producers off camera all the time for assurances that he was doing okay, this guy is now very confident and his head is bouncing up and down and he's doing the same shtick that he always does.

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:49.089
He is an absolute fraud.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:02:03.924
He is a traitor to America's children, and he's probably been a fraud for the last 10 or 15 years, actively understanding that he was being put in place for some future role in our governance.

01:02:04.985 --> 01:02:09.370
This is a monster, and he needs to be identified as such.

01:02:11.149 --> 01:02:16.556
That, to me, somehow created a lot of controversy to be opposed to something which I think is obviously silly.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:21.043
But, you know, I think you have to say it and you have to articulate the evidence.

01:02:21.123 --> 01:02:22.585
And so that's my point.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:23.386
What exactly did you say?

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.448
And what was some of the backlash?

01:02:24.628 --> 01:02:27.192
Now that we have some distance from it, we can reflect on this a little bit.

01:02:28.598 --> 01:02:38.545
I mean, in 2021, in the Atlantic Magazine, which is by no means a right-leaning magazine, if anything, it's a liberal bastion, I wrote an article called, The Case Against Masking Young Children.

01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:57.960
And it was extremely critical of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which I think has been- In 2021, after we closed schools for a whole year, after the college kids were allowed to go back to school in the fall of 2020 under full testing and mocked down mandates, masking mandates,

01:03:01.363 --> 01:03:04.684
You see, they all spoke up like a year too late.

01:03:05.644 --> 01:03:13.507
After they had already presided as a faculty member over a whole year of on-campus bullshit charade.

01:03:15.387 --> 01:03:18.548
He finally spoke up about masking two-year-olds.

01:03:22.249 --> 01:03:24.850
And now this is supposed to be somebody who took a risk.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:30.772
Somebody we should respect for his principles and outspoken amongst people that wouldn't speak out.

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.635
What a tremendous joke.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:44.718
Captured by some of this kind of groupthink and extremely critical of the policy decision to mask kids between the ages of two and five, which runs counter again to any nation globally.

01:03:45.578 --> 01:03:47.539
That article created such a backlash.

01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:54.721
I think there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of emails sent to the university that I should be fired, that I was sort of a misinformation peddler.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:04:13.950
For merely being in line with the policies of the European CDC and other nations, I think we forget how hot it was back in the COVID policy debates, how much people lost their sanity and lost their cool and made, I think, a number of bad decisions from school closure to the mandates to masking young kids, et cetera.

01:04:16.031 --> 01:04:17.212
And what do you think we should learn from that?

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:27.376
I mean, I think you're absolutely right to ask the question of whether or not these agencies deserve the powers that they have been granted.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:30.578
If there's anybody up in the control room, I need some more coffee.

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:43.729
Granted, I mean, should the CDC be a 40,000 person agency and not have a single person in the agency with the common sense to say, you know, if we tell the public that you should make a two-year-old wear a cloth mask,

01:04:44.449 --> 01:05:00.638
in daycare, except for the two hours a day when they're all napped side by side, if you tell the public that, that that's a policy that makes sense and the CDC endorses that, you might not be surprised when a few years later they don't trust any single thing you say because what you said was patently absurd, right?

01:05:00.698 --> 01:05:04.340
So to me, I think it does raise questions about these institutions,

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.425
whether or not they should be as big as they are, what kind of oversight.

01:05:07.545 --> 01:05:15.541
What he's not gonna question as a guy on the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

01:05:16.857 --> 01:05:30.207
Currently one of the heads of the FDA, he's never going to question the absurdity of using PCR with a single set of primers to find a novel virus as part of an ongoing pandemic.

01:05:30.247 --> 01:05:31.488
He's never going to question it.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:40.435
Never going to even come close to questioning the further use of PCR in any context has a diagnostic with a single set of primers and a probe.

01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:49.288
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever are they going to regulate that sector of the market again until the FDA is effectively gone.

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:54.197
I can tell you that for sure.

01:05:54.277 --> 01:05:59.099
And that's the reason why this conversation is about to go off the rails.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:00.960
They have, who do they actually work for?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.861
Do they work for the people or do they work for their own intrinsic interests?

01:06:04.201 --> 01:06:08.303
And I think the questions you're asking about FDA, I think are important and the correct questions that go beyond COVID.

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:12.165
I mean, I think they extend to, we could talk about Alzheimer's drugs and cancer drugs, which I think we will.

01:06:12.945 --> 01:06:19.628
The question of whether or not the FDA is serving the public's interest or merely a hurdle that justifies high drug prices.

01:06:20.168 --> 01:06:28.571
So I think you're absolutely spot on that the indisputable fact is that the FDA regulation is a key gatekeeper to the price of drugs in this country.

01:06:28.611 --> 01:06:30.372
It increases the administrative.

01:06:30.412 --> 01:06:34.453
So the main problem is, is that with the FDA, drugs are more expensive.

01:06:34.493 --> 01:06:39.295
So that's their main, that's the only thing that they can really articulate.

01:06:39.755 --> 01:06:43.576
They haven't really even told you what the FDA is supposed to be doing.

01:06:43.977 --> 01:06:47.658
They haven't really even told you what the FDA's mandate really is.

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:56.810
And by not doing that, they're being really, really malevolent by following the script that they've been given, most likely by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

01:06:57.659 --> 01:06:58.820
burden to bring a drug to market.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.604
The question is, as a result of that, do we get better and safer and more effective drugs?

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:06.327
And I think that's really come under question in the last few years.

01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:07.067
Wow.

01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:10.911
Yeah, but I think I want to set the question up even fairly, right?

01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:15.374
Because I think that's the way they would set it up is, do we get better, safer, more effective drugs?

01:07:16.095 --> 01:07:22.461
I mean, at the margin, certainly, if you're going to require jumping through all kinds of hurdles that would

01:07:23.447 --> 01:07:35.196
take 10 years and billions of dollars to scale, you would hope that it has some at least infinitesimal improvement in the level of certainty you have and the safety and efficacy and giving doctors the ability to weigh the trade-offs between those two things.

01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:39.960
Maybe you could even question that, but at least it would be some infinitesimal contribution to it.

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.942
The question is, is that worth the cost?

01:07:41.982 --> 01:07:49.467
Is that worth the cost not just to innovation, but even to actual prescription drug costs that are passed on to consumers?

01:07:50.308 --> 01:08:00.870
And I come from a place where I think it's far from clear that the United States of America is better off for the FDA ever having existed in the first place.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.570
It's gonna make a lot of people mad to hear that.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:05.751
People point to thalidomide, people point to a lot of other examples.

01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:11.192
First of all, those are examples that were in the face of the existence of the FDA in the first place.

01:08:11.472 --> 01:08:13.112
So let's just not forget that fact.

01:08:14.033 --> 01:08:15.373
But I think the deeper fact is,

01:08:16.536 --> 01:08:44.976
Do we have some level of, there are trade-offs to any policy choice, but do we have a level of commitment to medical choice that actually would believe that you would have private institutions that would backfill the role played by the FDA as trusted gatekeepers to consumers, but without being... He is suggesting that do we have the commitment to the free market that a private group of people would replace the FDA just because that's how the market forces work?

01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:49.489
Holy shit, it gets worse.

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:54.578
Centrally as prone to capture as the FDA actually is.

01:08:54.618 --> 01:08:55.760
And I think that's where I start.

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.802
I'd love to hear your views on that.

01:08:58.129 --> 01:09:01.211
I mean, I think it's a deep question and there's just so many places to jump off there.

01:09:01.672 --> 01:09:03.433
Maybe we could start by talking about the capture part.

01:09:03.753 --> 01:09:11.679
I mean, the capture part of the FDA is that, you know, while talking about FDA, I think are important and the correct questions that go beyond COVID.

01:09:11.699 --> 01:09:15.541
I mean, I think they extend to, you know, we could talk about Alzheimer's drugs and cancer drugs, which I think we will.

01:09:16.342 --> 01:09:23.007
The question of whether or not the FDA is serving the public's interest or merely a hurdle that justifies high drug prices.

01:09:23.547 --> 01:09:31.951
So I think you're absolutely spot on that the indisputable fact is that the FDA regulation is a key gatekeeper to the price of drugs in this country.

01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:34.932
It increases the administrative burden to bring a drug to market.

01:09:35.353 --> 01:09:39.735
The question is, as a result of that, do we get better and safer and more effective drugs?

01:09:39.755 --> 01:09:42.476
And I think that's really come under question in the last few years.

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:47.099
Yeah, I mean, I think I want to set the question up even fairly, right?

01:09:47.119 --> 01:09:51.523
Because I think that's the way they would set it up is do we get better, safer, more effective drugs?

01:09:51.543 --> 01:09:58.631
I mean, at the margin, certainly, if you're going to require jumping through all kinds of hurdles that, you know, would

01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:11.374
take 10 years and billions of dollars to scale, you would hope that it has some at least infinitesimal improvement in the level of certainty you have and the safety and efficacy and giving doctors the ability to weigh the trade-offs between those two things.

01:10:12.034 --> 01:10:16.137
Maybe you could even question that, but at least it would be some infinitesimal contribution to it.

01:10:16.358 --> 01:10:18.119
The question is, is that worth the cost?

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:25.645
Is that worth the cost not just to innovation, but even to actual prescription drug costs that are passed on to consumers?

01:10:26.485 --> 01:10:37.075
And I come from a place where I think it's far from clear that the United States of America is better off for the FDA ever having existed in the first place.

01:10:37.395 --> 01:10:38.776
It's gonna make a lot of people mad to hear that.

01:10:39.056 --> 01:10:41.939
People point to thalidomide, people point to a lot of other examples.

01:10:42.379 --> 01:10:47.384
First of all, those are examples that were in the face of the existence of the FDA in the first place.

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:49.326
So let's just not forget that fact.

01:10:50.226 --> 01:10:51.568
But I think the deeper fact is,

01:10:52.714 --> 01:11:12.986
Do we have some level of, there are trade-offs to any policy choice, but do we have a level of commitment to medical choice that actually would believe that you would have private institutions that would backfill the role played by the FDA as trusted gatekeepers to consumers, but without being centrally as prone to capture as the FDA actually is?

01:11:13.006 --> 01:11:14.146
And I think that's where I start.

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:15.207
I'd love to hear your views on that.

01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:19.586
I mean, I think it's a deep question and there's just so many places to jump off there.

01:11:20.046 --> 01:11:21.807
Maybe we could start by talking about the capture part.

01:11:22.127 --> 01:11:31.750
I mean, the capture part of the FDA is that, you know, while the FDA employees work at the FDA, they are technically prohibited from working for consulting for pharmaceutical firms.

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:37.112
But when they leave the FDA, you know, 60 or 70 percent of people end up working for consulting for the pharmaceutical firms.

01:11:37.532 --> 01:11:47.694
And I believe in the primaries, you were critical of Governor Haley for this particular thing, this kind of revolving door politics where, you know, you set out to do good, you stay to do well for yourself.

01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:55.996
And so that raises the fundamental question of whether or not the FDA employees, is there real motivation to regulate these drug products in a way that's best for the American people?

01:11:56.496 --> 01:12:02.037
Or is there real motivation in an audition, an audition to some way work across the table and take that

01:12:02.757 --> 01:12:10.620
bureaucratic technical expertise and sell it to the companies to create the hurdles that they themselves know how to jump over and sell that expertise to the companies later?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.081
I think that's an open question.

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.201
And so that's one of the ways in which they're being captured.

01:12:14.882 --> 01:12:22.645
The other way they're being captured is, I think, the extreme lobbying efforts that are being placed on politicians and the political pressure on them.

01:12:24.265 --> 01:12:29.367
The other thing that you said that I think is quite interesting is, what do we get for all their regulation?

01:12:29.967 --> 01:12:31.168
And I think we have to acknowledge that

01:12:32.529 --> 01:12:34.169
Well, actually, maybe let me talk about the choice for a second.

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:40.011
The choice to me is an interesting one, because as you point out, that there's two types of errors being made here.

01:12:40.491 --> 01:12:44.192
One, they can coerce you to get a medical product, maybe if that's not in your best interest.

01:12:44.672 --> 01:13:01.636
And the other thing is they can prevent you from getting a medical product that you might want to try, knowing fully well that we don't understand the safety signals and we don't understand the full information there, but you have a- Think about how much effort they are making to cloud your understanding of what the FDA's mandate actually is.

01:13:02.805 --> 01:13:22.916
In contrast to the overuse of the phrase safe and effective by Tony Fauci and everyone on TV for five years, starting in 2020, safe and effective, 2021, safe and effective, 2022, safe and effective, repeated over and over and over and over again.

01:13:23.537 --> 01:13:30.521
Now we're talking to somebody who is about to go and become the head of one of the most important wings of the FDA,

01:13:31.361 --> 01:13:37.444
never ever saying what the actual mandate of the FDA is.

01:13:37.864 --> 01:13:43.827
And they happen to be both, I don't know, not Russian and not Chinese and not Jewish.

01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:45.168
Terminal illness.

01:13:45.748 --> 01:13:47.970
You may feel like, what do I have to lose by trying?

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:51.031
So they're preventing both things and they've made errors on both ends.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:54.293
I mean, I think the vaccine mandates

01:13:54.713 --> 01:14:17.051
particularly around young men who are in college, which were implemented from the White House down and by many universities, clearly led to net harm because a college man who received dose two and beyond of the mRNA vaccines had greater harm from the risk of myocarditis than they could possibly have from the benefit in COVID-19 outcomes because they're young and healthy.

01:14:17.631 --> 01:14:30.680
And so that's an example of the administrative state, actually, I think, FDA plus White House, plus, you know, OSHA, plus the pressure they placed on colleges, actually causing harm to the American people by forcing them to take a product that they may not have wanted.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.723
Now, how many people didn't get access to a product that might have helped them?

01:14:34.783 --> 01:14:36.484
I think that's a tougher question to answer.

01:14:36.504 --> 01:14:39.826
And, you know, we could talk more about that.

01:14:40.787 --> 01:14:44.031
I'm not aware of any sort of really good studies that get at that, but that's sort of what you're getting at.

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:46.213
They're blocking both kinds of choice.

01:14:47.074 --> 01:14:50.699
And then the question is, are they in the sweet spot?

01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:52.901
Could they shift the dial a little bit?

01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:55.545
We don't know much about that.

01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:56.185
Yeah.

01:14:56.786 --> 01:14:58.688
I think that, I mean, the alternative question is,

01:14:59.932 --> 01:15:01.353
Are we sure?

01:15:01.373 --> 01:15:03.675
I mean, the bar's got to be high to say that they are going to be in the sweet spot.

01:15:03.695 --> 01:15:18.786
If not, the market, all else equal, would be a better arbiter of what that sweet spot actually is, including physicians, customers, patients, relying on other intermediary institutions to tell them what they can and cannot trust.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:23.549
So you'd have JD Power and Associates rating cars that people used to buy, certainly in the 1990s.

01:15:23.869 --> 01:15:25.891
You'd have equivalent institutions rating

01:15:26.491 --> 01:15:32.575
And even many of the payer organizations are beginning to have them for themselves, rating the value of different drugs and risks and benefits and trade-offs.

01:15:32.915 --> 01:15:37.058
Rating the value of different things is going to be done using what?

01:15:37.558 --> 01:15:38.478
That's right.

01:15:38.579 --> 01:15:39.399
It's going to be used.

01:15:39.419 --> 01:15:41.020
You're doing blockchain.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.061
Now you hear it.

01:15:42.841 --> 01:15:43.782
Now you hear it.

01:15:43.942 --> 01:15:51.887
Every time they say rating systems and public rating systems and public, you know, that's all blockchain.

01:15:52.827 --> 01:15:55.069
So against that backdrop, what role does the FDA play?

01:15:55.973 --> 01:16:05.858
And I think part of what's happened is that the existence of an institution like the FDA has actually crowded out the rise of those alternative intermediary institutions.

01:16:05.878 --> 01:16:21.805
So you can't just measure it against the status quo, but what the status quo... Having a public institution to enforce the safe and effective mandate that it's given has driven out the private competition to regulating safe and effective... Oh my gosh, wow, that is...

01:16:23.406 --> 01:16:25.989
so disingenuously argued it's pathetic.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.682
And I think you hit the nail on the head here.

01:16:34.722 --> 01:16:38.424
That blanket of security is indeed a false blanket of security.

01:16:39.144 --> 01:16:41.405
People talk about the effects of thalidomide many years ago.

01:16:41.585 --> 01:16:45.247
You're actually not going to hear as much in the press probably for the next 15 years.

01:16:45.808 --> 01:16:47.889
Eventually, it'll come around to it 20 years from now.

01:16:47.909 --> 01:17:01.756
But for the next 15 years, you're probably not going to hear about the adverse consequences by way of myocarditis or otherwise of an FDA-approved and government-mandated program, which is even worse than just a government-allowed program, which is what you had in the case of thalidomide and birth defects.

01:17:02.236 --> 01:17:05.957
which is the telltale example that they used to justify the existence of the FDA.

01:17:06.597 --> 01:17:30.225
And so my view, I guess my question, I share with my views, I'm curious for you is, it's hard to know, but what is your hypothesis of whether or not, on balance, the American health system and the patients who are the most important stakeholder in that system would be better, worse, or at least arguably unknown as to whether they'd be better off

01:17:31.502 --> 01:17:34.003
if there wasn't an FDA in the first place.

01:17:45.205 --> 01:17:46.886
Sorry, it's a low D, I forget.

01:17:47.406 --> 01:17:54.267
The last three keys are gunshots and then the low D is a... I mean, what in the world is going on here?

01:17:54.907 --> 01:17:56.428
This guy, his answer,

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:07.084
now should really scare you because remember, he's at the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:26.634
The very place that regulates vaccines, mRNAs, everything that we're worried about right now is under the purview of this super trader, this super fraud, who's being promoted by this super fraud.

01:18:28.612 --> 01:18:30.134
You see this problem here?

01:18:30.195 --> 01:18:35.403
This is a very, very big problem because he is in government right now.

01:18:40.253 --> 01:18:47.136
I think if you're talking about FDA 2024, I think that they'd probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA.

01:18:47.496 --> 01:18:48.676
And let's unpack that a little bit.

01:18:49.757 --> 01:18:53.058
You alluded to that the FDA is the be-all end-all.

01:18:53.578 --> 01:19:00.621
He should have to explain this on every podcast of the FDA that he does with Marty McCary, because how does he have that job then?

01:19:01.081 --> 01:19:08.465
He thinks right now in 2025 or four, as this was, that America would be better off without the FDA.

01:19:08.525 --> 01:19:09.426
He just said that.

01:19:09.906 --> 01:19:11.067
And now he works there.

01:19:11.567 --> 01:19:26.196
This is a red alert for all Americans to understand how important it is to get our streams and our news out because the rest of the shit on YouTube and on X is not real.

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:28.676
Many ways they are.

01:19:28.736 --> 01:19:33.342
So let me just talk a little bit about my field, cancer medicine, you know, through a number of different provisions.

01:19:33.662 --> 01:19:43.134
When the FDA approves a cancer drug, it is often mandated coverage by Medicare and Medicaid that we have to pay for it as well.

01:19:43.795 --> 01:19:55.779
And so what you do as you point out, you crowd out anybody's ability to say, Hey, you know, maybe we could have this available to people, but maybe there needs to be, uh, you know, some, some, uh, some serious copays for that.

01:19:55.799 --> 01:20:00.561
Maybe there needs to be, um, some restrictions on who should get access to it because there's a lot of uncertainty.

01:20:00.781 --> 01:20:04.962
Are you feeling how complicated it's going to get now and how many details they're going to talk about?

01:20:04.982 --> 01:20:06.482
Because he's a cancer researcher.

01:20:06.522 --> 01:20:07.963
He knows about all this stuff.

01:20:09.741 --> 01:20:16.965
He said we would be better off without the FDA with having never said what the FDA even does.

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:19.606
He doesn't even know what the FDA's mandate is.

01:20:21.015 --> 01:20:21.795
be a free-for-all.

01:20:22.176 --> 01:20:25.538
There'll just be tons of products coming on the market and we won't know what's better.

01:20:26.458 --> 01:20:29.260
In many ways, it might be like the way the cellular phone market is.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.701
There's still fierce competition.

01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:33.963
There's a number of websites that are rating phones all the time.

01:20:34.023 --> 01:20:38.346
When you're thinking about buying a phone, particularly an Android phone, all these sites are rating them.

01:20:38.506 --> 01:20:48.252
All these supplement producers would sure like it if the FDA went away so that they could put whatever they wanted to on the outside of their bottles without having to say that this is not an FDA-approved claim.

01:20:49.573 --> 01:20:50.654
They would all love that.

01:20:52.887 --> 01:20:55.768
There may be different groups of people who rate cancer drugs differently.

01:20:55.788 --> 01:20:58.448
I think I'm a very sort of a purist of evidence-based medicine.

01:20:58.628 --> 01:21:01.308
We would put out, you know, we could arguably put out a set of guidelines.

01:21:01.348 --> 01:21:06.309
Some insurance companies may decide to go with me because they think, you know, Prasad's guidelines are more evidence-based.

01:21:06.349 --> 01:21:08.170
They lead to more cost-effective healthcare.

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:15.211
Other insurance companies might go with different guidelines, but you would get competition in the marketplace, and then you would allow people to see who's winning.

01:21:16.231 --> 01:21:20.852
Can't you hear all the business opportunities that are gonna be available to all of these people?

01:21:20.892 --> 01:21:21.552
Can't you hear it?

01:21:23.166 --> 01:21:27.030
our new healthcare system in America is gonna be one giant cluster F.

01:21:42.085 --> 01:21:46.692
When we imagine a world without the FDA, it's easy to envision the boogeyman of just a free-for-all.

01:21:47.033 --> 01:21:47.894
That might not be what it is.

01:21:48.275 --> 01:21:55.025
And the last thing about thalidomide, I'd just say to your point, what was the story of thalidomide for the listeners in the 1950s, late 1950s?

01:21:57.629 --> 01:22:04.654
Thalidomide was approved in the United Kingdom, but notably there was one FDA reviewer who famously did not want that product available in the U.S.

01:22:04.714 --> 01:22:07.776
market, and it was approved as a morning sickness medicine for pregnant women.

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:16.082
In the U.K., unfortunately, thalidomide does cause, it's a teratogen, it causes serious birth defects like the prevention of the development of the

01:22:17.643 --> 01:22:21.686
And so you had a lot of children born without like their upper arms developed in the United Kingdom.

01:22:21.726 --> 01:22:24.769
The United States, since we didn't approve it, we didn't have that phenomenon.

01:22:25.129 --> 01:22:30.453
Now, many people in response to that felt like that was a great example of why we need to strengthen the FDA.

01:22:30.473 --> 01:22:35.917
It led to the passage of the Kiefer-Harris amendments in the early 60s, and it gave FDA more authority in regulating drug products.

01:22:36.678 --> 01:22:38.940
But strictly speaking, it wasn't an example

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:50.205
where the regulation, had it been in place prior, would have prevented thalidomide from coming on the market because it was an efficacy requirement that they added, and this was really a safety concern.

01:22:50.245 --> 01:22:51.746
So I think you're right about the story.

01:22:51.786 --> 01:22:54.427
It's not always told in the crispest way possible.

01:22:54.467 --> 01:22:56.788
I think there's more nuance to that story, as you note.

01:22:58.069 --> 01:23:01.170
More nuance to that story, as you note.

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:02.811
He got some of that OK.

01:23:02.871 --> 01:23:05.813
Some of that, he mentioned, you know, the Kefauver Amendment.

01:23:05.833 --> 01:23:06.533
That's interesting.

01:23:07.619 --> 01:23:14.042
But I don't think he understands how bad his position is.

01:23:14.062 --> 01:23:19.785
I don't think he understands how exposed he is and how easy it is to see that he is a liar and a traitor.

01:23:20.816 --> 01:23:27.522
because that story right there was also just mentioned as part of a script to make sure that it seems pretty believable.

01:23:28.202 --> 01:23:34.447
Don't mention that Estes Kefauver was killed in the Senate floor three weeks before John F. Kennedy was shot.

01:23:34.507 --> 01:23:35.288
Don't mention that.

01:23:36.049 --> 01:23:37.570
Don't mention Les Weinstein.

01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:47.098
Don't mention Robert F. Kennedy appointing Les Weinstein as the first Department of Justice intellectual property lawyer ever

01:23:49.946 --> 01:23:57.171
Don't mention that he's still the most, the highest paid arbitrator of biotech patent law in America.

01:23:57.231 --> 01:23:58.412
Don't mention any of that.

01:24:02.755 --> 01:24:05.096
Just say that we'd be better off without the FDA.

01:24:05.136 --> 01:24:10.400
And by the way, he's going to be the head of CBER in another six months.

01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:12.982
How extraordinary is this?

01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:25.041
Yeah, and I think a lot of those, you know, stories that are designed, there's only a couple of them really, but that's the one that's a classic case that any... If we take this a step farther and look for more scripted bullshit, I'm sure we're going to find it.

01:24:26.422 --> 01:24:29.725
These guys represent that kind of scripted bullshit, right?

01:24:30.586 --> 01:24:32.228
You know that that's what they did.

01:24:32.308 --> 01:24:34.130
You can see that that's what they did.

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:36.592
You can just go on YouTube and watch their videos.

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:47.483
from 2021 and 2022, and you can see that these guys are malevolent actors on a script with a lot of confidence that it's okay to laugh.

01:24:47.983 --> 01:25:00.035
A lot of confidence that it's okay to joke because they have been told what the safe subjects are, what the safe questions are to ask, and what the topics that they don't need to know, they probably don't know because they're that bad.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:03.778
that they're that dependent on the script that they're given.

01:25:04.158 --> 01:25:18.011
They're actually no different than Peter Hotez explaining that at the start of the anthrax attacks, he was just sitting at his desk with two books open to the anthrax chapter and reading to journalists.

01:25:18.091 --> 01:25:22.335
And that's how he rose to such prominence as a microbiologist.

01:25:22.415 --> 01:25:23.256
It's really a joke.

01:25:23.756 --> 01:25:24.998
This whole thing is a joke.

01:25:25.999 --> 01:25:33.109
It's a joke because there was a biological phenomenon that they have misconstrued as a spreading pathogen.

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.352
And they did it with two things.

01:25:35.433 --> 01:25:40.019
They did it first by sculpting this old population and its murder.

01:25:41.472 --> 01:25:43.973
using protocols and stuff like that.

01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:47.435
But also they sculpted the younger people's death here.

01:25:47.495 --> 01:25:58.560
They got a little bit of this out of the way using the similar techniques, including supplementary oxygen and other things that led to ARDS that could be blamed for COVID.

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:07.304
They used PCR to do that, nonspecific PCR tests, all in an effort to create the illusion

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:15.285
that the pandemic was a biological phenomenon that could be blamed exclusively on a virus instead of on murder.

01:26:16.249 --> 01:26:19.271
instead of on an expected rise in all-cause mortality.

01:26:19.351 --> 01:26:29.559
That's why the McKinsey Global Institute's population dependency and depopulation, this whole report came out in 2025 and not in 2020.

01:26:29.979 --> 01:26:39.086
Because if it came out in 2020, the population pyramids would have had this lopsided top on them that everybody would have been able to see, hey, wait a minute, where'd that go?

01:26:41.069 --> 01:26:45.030
because that's not in this one anymore because those people are all dead.

01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:52.131
The people who died in the last five years, roughly 3 million people per year in America alone, they're all off the pyramid now.

01:26:53.371 --> 01:26:57.212
It's almost like you came after the guy that trimmed the hedges came in.

01:26:57.272 --> 01:27:04.494
And so what was an overgrown jungle at the top has now become a very nice trimmed hedge at the top.

01:27:04.534 --> 01:27:06.014
Yeah, that's great because of this.

01:27:10.734 --> 01:27:12.936
And so we have a list of ways that they did it.

01:27:12.996 --> 01:27:27.366
It might be an incomplete list, but it's a hell of a lot more complete list than the people who say there are no virus or the people who say that it's a gain of function virus or the people that are complaining that there was no real rise in all cause mortality until the shots rolled out.

01:27:29.808 --> 01:27:30.849
That's just bullshit.

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:48.497
And so we do have one case that supposedly is pushing the idea that protocols were murder, but we've got to be very, very careful and vigilant to make sure that all of the aspects of Grace's protocol are put to scrutiny because

01:27:49.318 --> 01:27:56.665
It used to be that the main story was that she was put on supplementary oxygen because her pulse ox was a little low.

01:27:56.745 --> 01:28:04.411
Not that dissimilar to how FLCCC told us at the beginning of the pandemic we should go to the hospital if our pulse ox is below 96%.

01:28:07.205 --> 01:28:13.488
So now they're talking about all the other things that killed people, all the other combinations of drugs that killed people.

01:28:13.948 --> 01:28:31.716
But remember, Mark and I are the only people on the internet who are trying to point out that supplementary oxygen would be an easy and virtually foolproof way to turn a knob in every hospital to make sure that a certain percentage of people inevitably developed ARDS.

01:28:34.011 --> 01:28:39.473
I will say it more and more and more and more often, you don't need to kill particular people.

01:28:39.553 --> 01:28:46.396
You just need to encourage people to act in a way where a larger percentage of people will die of a similar cause.

01:28:46.816 --> 01:28:47.976
That's all they had to do.

01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:57.860
If they sign of willy nilly encouraged people to use supplementary oxygen, if you don't have enough ventilators, that

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:18.795
recommendation alone would be enough to significantly change the mortality in hospitals especially when people were insisting that such a thing as viral pneumonia existed and that viral pneumonia would be inappropriate to treat with antibiotics stop

01:29:20.216 --> 01:29:29.300
That is the single most important thing to see here because that's also how people often went septic and it became this multi-system inflammatory syndrome.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:36.243
Because what's happening there is that people with an infection are not being treated.

01:29:36.724 --> 01:29:43.727
Like for example, if you have a urinary tract infection and people blame it on a viral syndrome and don't treat you, you will go septic.

01:29:43.747 --> 01:29:45.648
You will die a very painful death.

01:29:48.570 --> 01:30:00.372
If they give you supplementary oxygen until you develop pneumonia, and then they don't treat it with antibiotics because, you know, antibiotics are inappropriate for pneumonia, you will have people die.

01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:03.473
And that's exactly what you see right there.

01:30:05.553 --> 01:30:11.274
Now you use the opioid deaths in all ages, but especially under 40.

01:30:11.434 --> 01:30:15.955
And now you have a reduction in life expectancy that seems to coincide with the pandemic.

01:30:17.639 --> 01:30:39.384
And as long as nobody talks about an incoming anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, and nobody talks about this huge list of ways that all-cause mortality could be mixed up with a decrease in life expectancy, and misconstrued has a total representation of a crisis about a novel virus, it's really hard.

01:30:40.319 --> 01:30:42.180
This is as good as it gets right here.

01:30:42.601 --> 01:30:44.002
This is American history.

01:30:44.462 --> 01:30:45.703
This is world history.

01:30:45.783 --> 01:30:48.425
And everything else on the internet is basically bullshit.

01:30:49.886 --> 01:30:52.628
So good luck to Grace's dad, Scott Shara.

01:30:52.728 --> 01:30:54.129
I hope the case goes well.

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:58.432
The reason why we are where we are has a lot to do with Mark Kulak.

01:30:58.472 --> 01:31:02.275
If you don't follow him, Mark is at HousatonicITS.com.

01:31:02.475 --> 01:31:04.016
Housatomic is kind of a joke.

01:31:04.577 --> 01:31:05.317
It's Housatonic.

01:31:07.907 --> 01:31:17.029
I am very, very excited to be able to be the guy at this point who feels pretty confident that this is a group of liars.

01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:20.749
This is a group of liars given a script by McKernan and by Malone.

01:31:21.729 --> 01:31:25.170
It's a group of people that work very hard on social media.

01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:29.411
They're a group of people that only has power because we use social media.

01:31:29.811 --> 01:31:34.752
And so the moment we stop using social media is the moment that all of these people become irrelevant.

01:31:34.792 --> 01:31:35.692
And so that's why I think

01:31:36.292 --> 01:31:41.415
It's more important for you to get off of social media than it is for you to be on it.

01:31:42.736 --> 01:31:51.481
I might stay on it because I'm still trying to fight them using it, but I'm definitely not trying to usefully use social media to get my message out.

01:31:51.601 --> 01:31:56.264
I'm using email for that and text messaging for that and my websites for that.

01:31:56.404 --> 01:31:58.746
So, this is all they ever had.

01:31:59.546 --> 01:32:07.276
Um, people like McCairn, um, this is all they ever had is people put in place to lie about a worst case scenario for five years.

01:32:07.756 --> 01:32:12.102
This guy was on a script provided to him by Kevin McKernan and by Robert Malone.

01:32:12.142 --> 01:32:14.905
And he might've not known all the details, but he definitely can.

01:32:15.706 --> 01:32:17.529
only be explained by that.

01:32:18.029 --> 01:32:22.795
The reason why he's not streaming right now for the past month or so is because we've made him irrelevant.

01:32:23.196 --> 01:32:30.966
Because Steve Kirsch has made him irrelevant by having him on his podcast and revealing that he's nothing but a script reading clown.

01:32:31.952 --> 01:32:34.814
Otherwise, he wouldn't find himself where he was.

01:32:34.854 --> 01:32:41.377
He wouldn't have found himself on the Vajon Health podcast about a year ago with Christine Grace and Charles Rixey.

01:32:41.718 --> 01:32:47.321
He wouldn't have found himself on streams in March of 2020 with two associates of George Webb.

01:32:47.661 --> 01:32:50.783
And he wouldn't be having to be replaced by this clown.

01:32:51.383 --> 01:33:03.513
Jordan Vaughn and a second stream at VSRF, who's now doing all the podcasts that I guess Kevin McCarron was supposed to do about prions and amyloid, but now this guy's doing it.

01:33:03.593 --> 01:33:05.574
His auditions have finally paid off.

01:33:05.995 --> 01:33:13.901
And more importantly, this guy's ties to me for five years have finally cost him his little career as a podcaster.

01:33:15.336 --> 01:33:22.318
Hopefully very soon, Brian Hooker is gonna confess that he could have said this in 2013 and stuck to it.

01:33:22.918 --> 01:33:25.479
In condition that we will not call autism.

01:33:25.619 --> 01:33:27.179
I don't like the word autism.

01:33:28.059 --> 01:33:29.120
He was vaccine damaged.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.900
He was neurologically damaged.

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.341
In condition that we will not call autism.

01:33:34.501 --> 01:33:36.041
I don't like the word autism.

01:33:36.942 --> 01:33:37.982
He was vaccine damaged.

01:33:38.382 --> 01:33:41.103
What you need to understand is that autism is a myth.

01:33:41.303 --> 01:33:59.773
Autism is a myth that encompasses as many unrelated conditions in children as possible in order to make sure a message like Brian Hooker's never actually surfaces and has any headway, that intramuscular injection can just damage kids.

01:34:01.273 --> 01:34:06.176
The same exact message that Brandy Vaughn put out until she was killed.

01:34:07.268 --> 01:34:09.830
in condition that we will not call autism.

01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:11.511
I don't like the word autism.

01:34:12.392 --> 01:34:13.312
He was vaccine damaged.

01:34:13.492 --> 01:34:16.334
Why use the word autism to describe poisoning?

01:34:17.055 --> 01:34:20.437
Why use the word autism to describe neurological damage?

01:34:25.921 --> 01:34:26.962
Because it's a myth.

01:34:28.263 --> 01:34:31.445
And that's why Brian Hooker uses that word now, but in 2013 did not.

01:34:33.888 --> 01:34:38.916
He's been co-opted by the same mythology that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:34:38.936 --> 01:34:47.931
has been co-opted by, that Mary Holland lies about, that Pauly Tommy lies about, that Andrew Wakefield lies about, that Meryl Nass lies about, that they all lie about.

01:34:49.454 --> 01:34:54.297
He was neurologically damaged, in condition that we will not call autism.

01:34:54.437 --> 01:34:55.998
I don't like the word autism.

01:34:56.898 --> 01:34:57.939
He was vaccine damaged.

01:34:58.219 --> 01:35:01.521
Why did Brian Hooker stop saying that?

01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:08.965
Everybody that follows Brian Hooker should only be asking him that question for the rest of his life.

01:35:09.605 --> 01:35:12.647
Why did you start saying autism?

01:35:15.777 --> 01:35:20.800
And the reason why is because he's a witting or unwitting traitor to our grandchildren.

01:35:23.082 --> 01:35:34.029
The same way that Suzanne Humphreys is a witting traitor to our grandchildren, because since her book in 2013, she hasn't made any intellectual progress at all.

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:40.814
Unlike Brandy Vaughn, who made all kinds of intellectual progress documented from 2015 to 2019,

01:35:44.275 --> 01:35:47.356
But none of these people have made progress, especially this one.

01:35:50.637 --> 01:35:52.037
Especially this one.

01:35:53.518 --> 01:35:55.398
This one is especially special.

01:35:56.478 --> 01:36:04.420
On over 90 billboards in her bra more than 15 years ago, ladies and gentlemen, swaying votes for prime ministers on autism.

01:36:04.881 --> 01:36:06.441
We gotta have autism awareness.

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:08.342
We need more programs in schools.

01:36:12.403 --> 01:36:13.303
That's how we got here.

01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:18.588
He might be an unwitting victim of the worst intelligence scam ever.

01:36:18.848 --> 01:36:19.249
I don't know.

01:36:19.329 --> 01:36:19.990
I don't care.

01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:21.631
He's not real.

01:36:22.412 --> 01:36:23.913
His claims were not real.

01:36:24.013 --> 01:36:25.735
His motivations were not real.

01:36:26.736 --> 01:36:28.598
His actions are not real anymore.

01:36:28.678 --> 01:36:33.422
And Jay Bhattacharya and Marty Makkari standing in front is not real.

01:36:34.043 --> 01:36:35.744
It is a purposefully designed

01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:40.558
controlled demolition of America or some parts of the American government.

01:36:41.219 --> 01:36:50.727
And the script they're following was designed by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, provided to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and provided to people like Brett Weinstein.

01:36:53.442 --> 01:37:08.287
And it's all one malevolent network that includes Piper Stover, the lady who first got me in connected with Brett Weinstein, the first person that really got me to start writing stuff down for five months before it was gonna be published in the Wall Street Journal or something.

01:37:08.547 --> 01:37:09.247
Stop lying!

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:13.096
trying to get my wife to tutor her daughter.

01:37:13.176 --> 01:37:40.955
This is a, in a very elaborate intelligence operation that unfortunately I was one of the main victims of, but I can tell you this fake anti-vax movement is really fake and they have fake actors all around like this fake and like, like Jack Cruz is a fake and they have unwitting participants who have been so surrounded by fakes on so many trips and so many conferences with these fakes that she is unaware of how she's been played.

01:37:41.015 --> 01:37:41.092
you

01:37:49.557 --> 01:37:50.798
Welcome back to Face the Nation.

01:37:50.818 --> 01:37:54.863
We're joined now by FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary.

01:37:54.923 --> 01:37:55.323
Good morning.

01:37:55.363 --> 01:37:55.784
Good morning.

01:37:55.904 --> 01:37:56.965
Good to have you here in person.

01:37:57.025 --> 01:37:57.606
Good to be here.

01:37:58.126 --> 01:38:06.155
So I want to get through a lot here, but one of the things we've noticed is this new COVID variant that seems to be circulating in Asia.

01:38:07.015 --> 01:38:09.698
I believe it's NB1.8.1.

01:38:09.838 --> 01:38:11.200
It's a variant under monitoring.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.041
What do we need to know?

01:38:12.352 --> 01:38:30.932
Yeah, so this appears to be a sub-variant of JN1, which has been the dominant strain, so it's believed that there is... So you can test for it, and you can sequence it, and then you can map it back to the other 18 million sequences that we have and judge the evolutionary position in the phylogenetic tree.

01:38:32.839 --> 01:38:43.646
How quickly did he get all of the assumptions of the novel virus that killed millions of people, that millions more were saved from, that might go endemic, that's probably gained a function, but who cares, because it's there now.

01:38:45.427 --> 01:38:50.810
Endemicity is the main illusion here with regard to virology.

01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:58.315
The idea that a virus can go from a mud puddle to be just present in the background forever.

01:38:59.497 --> 01:39:04.178
is a primary illusion of the pandemic, and this is the FDA director.

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.379
Cross-immunity protection.

01:39:06.939 --> 01:39:12.941
The COVID virus is gonna continue to mutate, and it's behaving like a common cold virus.

01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:19.103
It's now gonna become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal that causes about 25% of the cases of the common cold.

01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:35.517
Robert Malone said the worst case scenario in an event like this is that something would go endemic.

01:39:37.018 --> 01:39:40.241
That journalist Garrett said it in a CNN movie.

01:39:41.162 --> 01:39:48.207
You know, the worst case scenario is if something like this goes endemic, then it's just contributing to the all-cause mortality forever.

01:39:48.888 --> 01:39:56.033
Because RNA molecules with the right combination of bases, they can just become background signals forever.

01:40:01.693 --> 01:40:09.158
He doesn't know Jack about Diddley and could never explain that other than the script that he's been given by McKernan and Malone.

01:40:09.386 --> 01:40:13.749
or thinking of it as like a flu type variant, just a normal fluctuation.

01:40:13.809 --> 01:40:17.712
The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than COVID.

01:40:17.872 --> 01:40:24.176
So get ready, because biologically speaking, the flu is definitely better positioned for the next pandemic.

01:40:24.276 --> 01:40:25.097
Just get ready.

01:40:25.517 --> 01:40:39.126
COVID variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable, but the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target have suggested that either JN1 or any of these sub-variants would be reasonable strains to target.

01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:41.768
So you don't seem overly concerned about that.

01:40:41.848 --> 01:41:01.565
I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC and you with the HHS secretary in this video announcement on Tuesday, where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule.

01:41:01.605 --> 01:41:02.425
He then had a memo

01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:10.771
to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits.

01:41:11.571 --> 01:41:20.517
Then late Thursday, the CDC said, quote, shared clinical decision making, which I think is just talking to your doctor, should determine whether kids get vaccinated.

01:41:20.837 --> 01:41:23.398
Can you clearly state what the policy is?

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:24.519
Because this is confusing.

01:41:24.599 --> 01:41:27.600
Yeah, we believe the recommendation should be with a patient and their doctor.

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:43.828
So we're gonna get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy young Americans because we don't wanna see, we don't, well, on the COVID vaccine schedule, we don't wanna see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth COVID booster shot.

01:41:44.228 --> 01:41:51.792
We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat infinite annual COVID vaccine.

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:54.094
Who's advocating for that?

01:41:54.275 --> 01:42:05.366
That's a strange straw man to put out there because I don't think there's anybody advocating for high schoolers to get their fifth COVID shot or they can't attend school.

01:42:05.827 --> 01:42:07.288
I don't know what he's talking about there.

01:42:07.328 --> 01:42:08.630
That seems like bullshit to me.

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:20.251
There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new COVID boosters in young healthy kids every year in perpetuity, and a young girl born today should get 80 COVID mRNA.

01:42:20.912 --> 01:42:23.595
Exactly what Jeff from Earth is saying right there.

01:42:23.675 --> 01:42:24.576
Sorry, my ear itches.

01:42:25.276 --> 01:42:29.501
But it is not questioning their needing of two.

01:42:31.007 --> 01:42:35.951
And that's how you can see this is a malevolent lie and the worst kind of malevolent lie.

01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:37.031
It's gross.

01:42:37.171 --> 01:42:38.012
It's very gross.

01:42:38.072 --> 01:42:39.233
Nice spot there, Jeff.

01:42:39.293 --> 01:42:39.793
Nice spot.

01:42:39.833 --> 01:42:41.054
Good to see you.

01:42:41.094 --> 01:42:43.716
Shots or other COVID shots in her average lifespan.

01:42:44.056 --> 01:42:48.740
We're saying that's a theory and we'd like to check in and get some randomized controlled data.

01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.762
It's been about four years since the original randomized trials.

01:42:52.242 --> 01:42:54.163
So we'd like an evidence-based approach.

01:42:54.203 --> 01:42:58.624
Dr. Prasad and I published this in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.

01:42:59.024 --> 01:43:09.008
And we're basically saying we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory because... Your statement was not about repeat boosters.

01:43:09.088 --> 01:43:11.289
It says the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.

01:43:11.329 --> 01:43:13.270
The vaccine is not recommended for healthy children.

01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.610
That's different than annual boosters.

01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:18.832
Yeah, at this point, we're dealing, you know, it is a booster strategy.

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.932
People would be getting the updated shot.

01:43:20.993 --> 01:43:24.294
So, whether or not a young healthy child... Well, what about kids who haven't gotten a shot?

01:43:24.314 --> 01:43:25.294
So, we'd like to see the data.

01:43:25.394 --> 01:43:27.035
We'd love to see that data doesn't exist.

01:43:27.055 --> 01:43:33.137
No, no, no, but on a practical level, for a parent at home hearing you and trying to make sense of you... We're saying take it back to your doctor.

01:43:33.157 --> 01:43:39.600
If their child has not been vaccinated, are you recommending that their first encounter with COVID be an actual infection?

01:43:40.236 --> 01:43:46.460
We're not going to push the COVID shot in young healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it.

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.183
That is a decision between a parent and their doctor.

01:43:50.303 --> 01:43:58.609
And just so you, I don't know if you know these statistics, but 80 for 88% of American kids, their parents have said no to the COVID shot last season.

01:43:58.669 --> 01:44:03.492
So America, the vast majority of Americans are saying no, maybe they want to see some clinical data as well.

01:44:03.872 --> 01:44:05.153
Maybe they have concerns about

01:44:05.213 --> 01:44:06.894
crowdsource my health guidance.

01:44:07.014 --> 01:44:08.635
I want a clear thing, right?

01:44:08.655 --> 01:44:10.036
You don't go with popularity.

01:44:10.076 --> 01:44:11.917
You go with, as you're saying, data.

01:44:11.937 --> 01:44:13.538
And when we look at that data.

01:44:13.558 --> 01:44:15.339
Yeah, so let's see the data.

01:44:15.359 --> 01:44:15.680
Okay.

01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:24.925
So the CDC data said 41% of children aged six months to 17 years hospitalized with COVID between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition.

01:44:24.965 --> 01:44:27.147
In other words, they looked healthy.

01:44:27.407 --> 01:44:31.690
So she didn't make any argument about whether they were vaccinated or not.

01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:40.472
And remember, those numbers come from the fact that everybody that goes to a hospital is tested.

01:44:40.652 --> 01:44:42.693
Everybody that goes to a hospital is tested.

01:44:42.753 --> 01:44:44.894
So the numbers are generated by the testing.

01:44:45.314 --> 01:44:46.495
And so are the remnants.

01:44:46.855 --> 01:44:50.577
Everybody is paying money for these tests to be out there.

01:44:50.597 --> 01:44:53.318
The only question is, what pot of fake money is it coming from?

01:44:53.658 --> 01:45:03.004
We know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive COVID tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital.

01:45:03.344 --> 01:45:06.806
When I go to the ICU... Oh my gosh, they're testing everybody.

01:45:06.846 --> 01:45:09.007
And sometimes there's incidental positives.

01:45:09.047 --> 01:45:17.012
So not fake positives, not false positives, not nonspecific positives, but real positives that aren't causing any disease.

01:45:17.072 --> 01:45:21.735
Because remember, just as Brian Hooker told us in 2020, right after Brandy died,

01:45:22.395 --> 01:45:25.878
It's COVID and other things spread by asymptomatic spread.

01:45:27.299 --> 01:45:36.447
When I walk to the peak, we know that data historically under the Biden administration did not distinguish being sick from COVID or an incidental positive COVID test.

01:45:36.467 --> 01:45:42.672
When you go to an ICU in America and you ask how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with COVID,

01:45:43.452 --> 01:45:47.154
The answer I get again and again is we haven't seen that in a year or years.

01:45:47.634 --> 01:45:56.259
And so, the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young healthy kids, and the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data.

01:45:56.299 --> 01:45:58.680
And you say, forget about the data, just get it anyway.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:08.831
Okay, so on data and transparency, for decades, since 1964, it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, that went through this panel recommendation.

01:46:08.851 --> 01:46:11.674
I mean, people watched these things during COVID.

01:46:11.734 --> 01:46:13.696
The report was then handed up.

01:46:14.077 --> 01:46:17.941
It offered debate, it offered transparency, and it offered data points.

01:46:18.041 --> 01:46:24.286
One of the best public comments at the ACIP meeting that was ever done was me in 2022.

01:46:24.646 --> 01:46:27.989
In case you haven't seen it, it's in the Batcave on my channel.

01:46:28.089 --> 01:46:35.375
Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet?

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:36.416
and make that data.

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:41.922
That panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them.

01:46:42.302 --> 01:46:51.392
If you look at the minutes of the report, they even say we generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach.

01:46:51.412 --> 01:46:53.074
So why not let them do that in June?

01:46:53.334 --> 01:46:57.716
So in the meantime, we don't want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it.

01:46:57.916 --> 01:47:02.599
They can do it, and that committee will meet and make recommendations.

01:47:02.679 --> 01:47:09.562
But you look at the minutes of the last couple of years, they say, we want a simple message for everybody just so they can understand it.

01:47:09.662 --> 01:47:12.084
It was not a data-based conversation.

01:47:12.124 --> 01:47:15.065
It was a conversation based on marketing and ease.

01:47:15.565 --> 01:47:20.688
And I've written an article titled, Why the People Don't Trust the CDC, and it's in part from that

01:47:24.151 --> 01:47:30.677
We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in or we get some clinical data.

01:47:30.697 --> 01:47:33.400
If there's zero clinical data, you're all pining.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.142
I mean, you're just, it's a theory.

01:47:35.542 --> 01:47:37.384
And so we don't want to put out an abstinence.

01:47:37.404 --> 01:47:39.265
Don't forget, this is 2025.

01:47:39.326 --> 01:47:40.387
This is last Sunday.

01:47:40.447 --> 01:47:41.307
It's like yesterday.

01:47:41.407 --> 01:47:43.590
This is really, really crazy gross.

01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:47.373
recommendation for kids with no clinical data.

01:47:47.413 --> 01:47:49.815
So you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women.

01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:51.896
There is data.

01:47:53.352 --> 01:48:01.835
Researchers in the UK analyzed a series of 67 studies, which included 1.8 million women, and the journal BMJ Global Health published it.

01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:03.155
People can Google it at home.

01:48:03.576 --> 01:48:14.539
And it says the COVID vaccine in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, and improves pregnancy outcomes with no serious safety concerns.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:18.941
This is data that shows that it is recommended

01:48:19.932 --> 01:48:22.654
or could be advised for pregnant women to take this vaccine.

01:48:22.814 --> 01:48:23.935
Why do you find other?

01:48:24.176 --> 01:48:28.119
Now, so let's just make sure that you see where GigaOM Biological is on this.

01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:43.912
This is a woman who thinks that knowledge is created by scientific papers and that if you find a scientific paper with the right combination of words and it's abstract in its discussion or even in its title, then whatever it says is real.

01:48:43.972 --> 01:48:44.753
This is data.

01:48:45.473 --> 01:48:47.874
And so that is how gain-of-function was created.

01:48:47.934 --> 01:48:54.195
That's how the proofreading enzyme XON was created for coronaviruses.

01:48:54.235 --> 01:49:04.638
That's how this whole narrative of lab leaks is created, by creating scientific papers that apparently make it seem like these whole things are real and possible.

01:49:05.198 --> 01:49:06.658
We're finding viruses.

01:49:06.718 --> 01:49:07.998
We're spraying things.

01:49:08.538 --> 01:49:10.539
It's just all written on papers.

01:49:11.758 --> 01:49:21.301
and claimed in discussions, and then normies and people who are given a script are told that these are just bricks in a wall.

01:49:22.601 --> 01:49:24.281
And they're not bricks in a wall.

01:49:24.341 --> 01:49:28.843
This is not even a, it's crazy.

01:49:30.353 --> 01:49:32.014
There's no randomized control trial.

01:49:32.054 --> 01:49:32.954
That's the gold standard.

01:49:32.994 --> 01:49:34.735
Those 67 studies are mixed.

01:49:35.175 --> 01:49:40.218
The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a comorbid condition.

01:49:40.258 --> 01:49:44.900
So it's a very- And so no discussion of general biology can happen.

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.101
No discussion of common sense can happen.

01:49:47.161 --> 01:49:50.723
No discussion of big picture stuff.

01:49:50.803 --> 01:50:00.027
It's only insistence that any knowledge that we have must be based on papers, must be based on evidence-based something.

01:50:01.738 --> 01:50:04.060
There is no big truth.

01:50:04.161 --> 01:50:06.643
There is no larger understanding.

01:50:06.683 --> 01:50:11.488
There are no, you know, baseline foundational understanding of anything.

01:50:11.588 --> 01:50:14.331
Everything is just based on what paper you can cite.

01:50:14.732 --> 01:50:16.914
And they're both reinforcing this trap.

01:50:16.994 --> 01:50:18.776
And it is a very malevolent trap.

01:50:18.996 --> 01:50:19.877
very mixed bags.

01:50:19.897 --> 01:50:26.802
So we're saying your obstetrician, your primary care doctor, and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it.

01:50:26.822 --> 01:50:31.066
12% of pregnant women last year got the COVID shot.

01:50:31.366 --> 01:50:41.154
So we're not talking about any of the shots relative to birthday, or relative to developmental period or relative to, to their efficacy.

01:50:41.194 --> 01:50:43.295
We're talking only about COVID shots.

01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:46.498
So we're, we're not at all anywhere near where

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.103
supposedly once Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:50:49.143 --> 01:50:49.925
was head

01:50:51.184 --> 01:50:56.968
head of HHS, we would make progress in these arenas.

01:50:57.188 --> 01:51:00.970
And there's no progress being made, because that was never gonna happen.

01:51:01.411 --> 01:51:03.412
He was always a Truman Show puppet.

01:51:04.152 --> 01:51:09.036
People have serious concerns, and it's probably because they wanna see a randomized trial data.

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:12.518
The randomized trial- In the meantime, the world moves on.

01:51:13.018 --> 01:51:16.080
And you published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 20th,

01:51:17.441 --> 01:51:17.601
Oh, oh.

01:51:34.255 --> 01:51:40.480
In the New England Journal of Medicine, we simply list what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk.

01:51:40.841 --> 01:51:43.963
And we're just saying, decide with your doctor.

01:51:44.363 --> 01:51:45.845
We're not saying one way or the other.

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:54.492
And the randomized trial... It's almost like he would rather use AI to decide who to bomb in Gaza, because then we don't have to really worry about it anymore.

01:51:54.532 --> 01:52:00.377
It sounds like he would rather have AI decide who should get the vaccines, because then we don't have to worry about who dies anymore.

01:52:01.445 --> 01:52:03.288
Just make the decision with your doctor.

01:52:03.308 --> 01:52:04.750
That's what health freedom means.

01:52:06.233 --> 01:52:07.795
I don't have any recommendations.

01:52:07.876 --> 01:52:10.360
I don't have any opinions about how this shit works.

01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:13.460
I'm just the FDA head.

01:52:13.981 --> 01:52:14.882
I'm a surgeon.

01:52:15.182 --> 01:52:17.204
So here's the data on pregnant women.

01:52:17.404 --> 01:52:22.709
A randomized control trial was set up and it was closed without any explanation.

01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:30.757
We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows.

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:31.978
We don't have those data.

01:52:32.599 --> 01:52:32.919
All right.

01:52:34.562 --> 01:52:41.428
It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say talk to their doctor.

01:52:41.948 --> 01:52:43.850
When do they get the data you're promising?

01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:50.555
All these controlled studies in the absence of data, they should talk to their doctor and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgment.

01:52:52.417 --> 01:52:55.639
FDA Commissioner, thank you for trying to help clear this up.

01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:02.405
Up next, the potential impact of those new policies regarding foreign student visas will be right back.

01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:10.606
Now who are they going to have talk about foreign student visas and why would foreign student visas be a problem?

01:53:10.646 --> 01:53:13.848
There's a number of reasons why foreign student visas would be a problem.

01:53:14.708 --> 01:53:24.575
The first one is, is that you can start a company about bullshit and then apply for people to come to America and they could get an EB1 visa or something like that.

01:53:25.472 --> 01:53:34.997
There are a lot of people I think that are in America just because some bullshit company is made and then they are brought here under a E1B visa or whatever the visa is.

01:53:35.758 --> 01:53:44.843
There are also visas for foreign students like Chinese students that come over here and apparently do postdocs for free and then steal all our intellectual property.

01:53:48.462 --> 01:53:59.867
I just want you to realize where we're at here because remember my friend, supposedly Piper Stover, spoke in front of Congress in a session that was organized by some guy from India, from Illinois.

01:54:02.048 --> 01:54:05.569
That guy has long time connections to Barack Obama.

01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:13.653
That guy's the head of the Communist Party of China, anti something or other in the House of Representatives.

01:54:14.616 --> 01:54:19.180
He's also kind of in charge of our opinions or investigating any Russian things.

01:54:21.202 --> 01:54:34.673
And he's got a very, you know, unique position in my mind, in the sense that there's a Senate position that might open up in Illinois soon, and he would be in a unique place to take it over.

01:54:34.833 --> 01:54:42.840
Again, remember, we're supposed to be conservatives, not Democrats, yet a Democrat like Piper Stover

01:54:44.884 --> 01:54:51.288
is and a Democrat like, I don't know, like Jay Bhattacharya who worked for the Obama administration.

01:54:51.328 --> 01:55:01.854
Like, I don't know how he would get there if, and how he would get into the Trump administration unless it was kind of an orchestrated show, largely bullshit.

01:55:01.974 --> 01:55:06.717
And a lot of people are not Russian or Chinese, but they seem to be from another country.

01:55:10.225 --> 01:55:13.706
We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.

01:55:13.786 --> 01:55:15.867
That's Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi.

01:55:15.967 --> 01:55:17.327
He's in Illinois.

01:55:17.427 --> 01:55:18.407
Good morning to you.

01:55:18.427 --> 01:55:22.188
I want to get straight to it.

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:28.790
You heard from the Secretary of State this week that the State Department is going to work with Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas.

01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:34.896
for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party, or setting in critical fields.

01:55:35.376 --> 01:55:39.280
There are like 300,000 Chinese students with visas in this country.

01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:40.201
The U.S.

01:55:40.261 --> 01:55:43.003
government already has a heightened level of vetting.

01:55:43.264 --> 01:55:44.325
What's going to change?

01:55:46.758 --> 01:55:47.159
I don't know.

01:55:47.239 --> 01:55:48.280
There's not enough details.

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:59.635
But what it looks like is they're targeting all people of Chinese origin who are on international student visas, because he's not limiting it to just people who might have ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

01:55:59.675 --> 01:56:04.942
And if they do have those ties, they don't belong here, especially if they're committing nefarious acts.

01:56:05.362 --> 01:56:13.827
However, this appears to be much broader, and it's terribly misguided, and it appears prejudicial and discriminatory.

01:56:14.348 --> 01:56:29.197
My own father came here on an international student visa, and I believe that these people are vital for our economy and for entrepreneurship in this country, and I think this is going to harm America more than help.

01:56:29.804 --> 01:56:33.891
But you said if someone has ties to the Chinese Communist Party, they shouldn't be here.

01:56:33.991 --> 01:56:41.083
Does that mean all the students who are children of leaders, for example, Xi Jinping's own daughter, shouldn't have been allowed here?

01:56:43.223 --> 01:56:53.792
Well, if they were engaged in nefarious activities, and if they are somehow deeply connected to the CCP, I think that we should be very careful.

01:56:54.212 --> 01:57:06.323
But in this particular case, they're not only going after people who might fall in that category, but it's anybody who is from China, including Hong Kong, by the way, where people are actually persecuted

01:57:06.883 --> 01:57:13.745
for various freedoms they're trying to exercise and who come here seeking to exercise those freedoms.

01:57:13.785 --> 01:57:16.905
So this is a terribly misguided policy.

01:57:17.985 --> 01:57:22.606
The Biden administration did conduct heightened vetting, as you know, of Chinese students.

01:57:22.907 --> 01:57:29.308
Do you think that there is a legitimate argument for expanding this, that certain areas should just be off limits?

01:57:31.621 --> 01:57:39.709
I think that you should definitely have heightened vetting, especially in certain critical areas, because we know- Maybe we should vet all foreign students.

01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.152
What about the Indians that come over here?

01:57:43.253 --> 01:57:45.576
Why are we worried so much about the Chinese?

01:57:45.656 --> 01:57:46.296
It's strange.

01:57:47.230 --> 01:57:57.602
that the CCP tries to steal, for instance, intellectual property or worse, but... Do the Indians never steal intellectual property?

01:57:57.642 --> 01:57:58.323
They're real good.

01:57:58.423 --> 01:57:59.645
They're real honest dudes.

01:57:59.865 --> 01:58:00.886
Is that the way that is?

01:58:01.066 --> 01:58:05.512
The way that this is currently structured looks very, very suspicious.

01:58:05.992 --> 01:58:07.073
And you have to remember that

01:58:07.754 --> 01:58:14.877
The people that are cheering for this policy, what Marco Rubio had called for, is the Chinese Communist Party.

01:58:15.057 --> 01:58:15.357
Why?

01:58:15.477 --> 01:58:17.298
Because they want these people back.

01:58:17.578 --> 01:58:23.501
They want the scientists and the entrepreneurs and the engineers who can come and help their economy.

01:58:23.961 --> 01:58:30.844
And so we are probably helping them as well as other countries more than helping ourselves with this policy.

01:58:31.961 --> 01:58:42.926
The Defense Secretary is traveling in Asia right now and he said in a defense forum speech that Beijing is quote Concretely incredibly preparing to use military force.

01:58:43.426 --> 01:58:45.247
He said their military is rehearsing.

01:58:45.547 --> 01:58:56.812
Take a listen Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force Would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world

01:58:57.125 --> 01:58:58.706
There's no reason to sugarcoat it.

01:58:59.366 --> 01:59:03.029
The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent.

01:59:03.809 --> 01:59:06.431
He did not say what the consequences would be.

01:59:06.571 --> 01:59:10.974
Are you encouraged by what appears to be a statement of support for allies?

01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:13.770
I am.

01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:16.833
I think what he's saying is largely correct.

01:59:17.413 --> 01:59:30.203
But I think the problem is, at the same time he says that, either Donald Trump or even him or others say other things that push away our friends, partners and allies in the region and cause confusion.

01:59:30.703 --> 01:59:35.807
And so we need to be consistent and thoughtful with regard to our statements.

01:59:35.887 --> 01:59:41.712
And we need to be also very methodical about our actions in trying to curb

01:59:42.133 --> 01:59:47.648
military aggression by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea and with regard to Taiwan.

01:59:48.792 --> 01:59:50.833
Since you track U.S.

01:59:50.993 --> 02:00:04.957
intelligence, I wanted to ask you if you have any insight into what appears to be the swarm of Ukrainian drones that has destroyed 40 Russian military aircraft deep inside Russian territory overnight.

02:00:05.677 --> 02:00:12.139
Sources are- He's also an authority on the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the intelligence from it.

02:00:12.899 --> 02:00:34.743
which in my humble opinion makes this a setup like they're setting him up to be an elder statesman with his gray hair he's going to be a senator soon this guy could be a presidential candidate in a couple years this is frighteningly dead on balls accurate for us this is ridiculous if if piper stover spoke in his in his session

02:00:35.128 --> 02:00:39.577
telling our Jennifer Jacobs that the White House wasn't aware that this attack was planned.

02:00:40.518 --> 02:00:42.542
What can you tell us about the level of U.S.

02:00:42.603 --> 02:00:46.751
intelligence sharing with Ukraine right now and helping them with their targets?

02:00:49.646 --> 02:00:54.431
I don't want to get into classified information, but what I can say is that it's a little bit more strange.

02:00:54.471 --> 02:00:56.614
He might not know any classified information.

02:00:56.674 --> 02:01:01.660
If I say I don't want to get into any classified information, does that mean I really know it?

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.522
Same with Robert Malone.

02:01:03.582 --> 02:01:04.683
Some of that's classified.

02:01:04.743 --> 02:01:05.944
I can't really tell you.

02:01:06.966 --> 02:01:08.067
Can that also be a lie?

02:01:08.107 --> 02:01:09.268
Of course it can be a lie.

02:01:10.074 --> 02:01:12.735
in light of what Donald Trump has said recently.

02:01:13.515 --> 02:01:24.939
The one thing that I can also say is that Trump was right the other day to say that Putin is crazy in the way that he's going after civilian areas in Ukraine repeatedly.

02:01:25.759 --> 02:01:27.740
And so the Ukrainians are striking back.

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:34.822
At the end of the day, the only way that we can bring these hostilities to an end is by strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians.

02:01:35.282 --> 02:01:44.444
Trump should, at this point, realize that Putin is playing him and aid the Ukrainians in their battlefield efforts.

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:52.386
That's the best way to get to some type of armistice or truce at the negotiating table, sooner rather than later.

02:01:53.046 --> 02:01:53.406
All right.

02:01:54.067 --> 02:01:55.947
Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thank you for your time.

02:01:56.355 --> 02:01:57.836
Unbelievable stuff.

02:01:57.996 --> 02:02:02.698
Scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen, and scripted, scripted, scripted bullshit readers.

02:02:03.358 --> 02:02:06.339
That's what all these people are, just scripted bullshit readers.

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:20.805
And the script is because there are murder and lies that need to be covered up as we are coerced into teaching our children this bad biology evolution because DNA, you're one in a 10 billion population full of useless eaters.

02:02:21.545 --> 02:02:22.165
Nonsense.

02:02:23.006 --> 02:02:24.346
Nonsense, ladies and gentlemen.

02:02:26.647 --> 02:02:27.988
It's been a long, strange trip.

02:02:28.148 --> 02:02:32.072
I don't think I'm going to watch the Jay Bhattacharya video that I had queued up.

02:02:32.232 --> 02:02:35.755
I'm going to wait until tomorrow because it's a long one and it's going to take a lot out of me.

02:02:36.296 --> 02:02:38.137
This is about the bad biology though.

02:02:38.177 --> 02:02:38.778
It really is.

02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:43.302
I can't stress enough how important it is to be aware of that.

02:02:43.702 --> 02:02:48.227
I'm going to play a tune and we're going to watch the beginning of that video and then we'll save the rest of it for tomorrow.

02:02:48.667 --> 02:02:49.688
I'll see you in a few minutes.

02:02:50.388 --> 02:02:51.049
I can't remember.

02:02:51.129 --> 02:02:51.990
Oh yeah, I do remember.

02:03:06.467 --> 02:03:09.370
Many times I tried to tell you.

02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:12.712
Many times I cried alone.

02:03:13.653 --> 02:03:19.078
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone.

02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:23.501
Don't want to leave you really.

02:03:24.362 --> 02:03:26.584
I've lost too much time.

02:03:26.604 --> 02:03:30.207
To give you up that easy.

02:03:53.355 --> 02:04:20.087
We belong, we belong, we belong together Maybe it's a sign of weakness When I don't know what to say Maybe I just wouldn't know What to do with my strength anyway Have we become a habit?

02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:24.613
Do we disturb the flow?

02:04:24.633 --> 02:04:42.708
Now there's no looking forward Now there's no turning back When you say we belong to the light We belong to the thunder We belong to the sound of the words We've both fallen under

02:05:08.883 --> 02:05:10.664
Try to sleep now.

02:05:10.724 --> 02:05:13.264
Close your eyes and try to dream.

02:05:13.885 --> 02:05:20.407
Clear your mind and do your best to try and watch the ballet gleam.

02:05:21.007 --> 02:05:27.349
We can't begin to know it, how much we really care.

02:05:27.369 --> 02:05:31.370
I hear your voice inside me.

02:05:31.951 --> 02:05:32.871
I see your face.

02:05:43.161 --> 02:05:56.839
The sound of the world and people falling under Whatever we deny or embrace The world's all for better We belong

02:06:26.384 --> 02:06:28.425
Isolate, what was it?

02:06:30.245 --> 02:06:30.925
Of the virus?

02:06:32.506 --> 02:06:34.286
Well you isolate a virus by

02:06:41.084 --> 02:06:43.567
finding the virus which causes a disease.

02:06:44.207 --> 02:06:49.092
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

02:06:49.653 --> 02:06:51.254
I don't understand what the issue is.

02:06:51.274 --> 02:06:51.414
I see.

02:06:51.434 --> 02:06:52.676
No, it depends on how they use it.

02:07:06.527 --> 02:07:08.491
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:07:08.571 --> 02:07:14.602
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:07:14.682 --> 02:07:16.706
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:07:22.625 --> 02:07:23.946
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

02:07:23.986 --> 02:07:24.787
Welcome to the show.

02:07:24.827 --> 02:07:26.188
This is the second half of the show.

02:07:26.248 --> 02:07:30.351
GigaOM Biological is a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:07:30.391 --> 02:07:31.372
Good to see everybody.

02:07:32.713 --> 02:07:33.493
Welcome to it.

02:07:35.395 --> 02:07:39.378
I do want to remind you that this is funded only by viewers like you.

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:43.601
If you want to support the stream, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do so.

02:07:43.661 --> 02:07:47.284
We are going to become more productive in the coming months, but right now it's still just

02:07:48.024 --> 02:08:04.293
a holding pattern, trying to document and capture and archive the amount of treachery that's currently going on in the American government and the people that have come into contact with me over the last five years who I think are instrumental in putting those people in place to destroy the FDA, to

02:08:04.773 --> 02:08:14.738
weaponize the CDC to effectively undermine any remaining democracy of America and really invert our status to something else.

02:08:14.798 --> 02:08:22.321
It's very striking to me right now how bad it is, but this all has to do with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:23.002
being a puppet

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:27.403
and the people who are behind him, and we need to identify the people who are behind him.

02:08:27.863 --> 02:08:37.687
I think Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are good places to start, but I think there's an operator like Steve Bannon as well, who thought maybe he could even get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:37.767 --> 02:08:38.107
further

02:08:38.947 --> 02:08:48.355
But there is a malevolent group of people that is interacting with Indians and Chinese and and no Russians as far as I can tell except for maybe Yuri Dagan.

02:08:49.216 --> 02:09:03.047
It's a really weird place that we are where these people exist, where people like Kevin McCairn exist, where people like Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan and Mark and Sam Bailey exist.

02:09:03.828 --> 02:09:04.549
These are all

02:09:05.089 --> 02:09:13.177
fraudulent fake people that were put in place to curate a narrative that would make sure that we would never teach our way out.

02:09:13.217 --> 02:09:17.360
We would never teach our children the illusion of pandemics.

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.522
Literally turning into worst case scenario.

02:09:19.562 --> 02:09:27.250
That's why this guy said it was worst case scenario in 2020 with a group of people that included me and a bunch of George Webb associates.

02:09:28.117 --> 02:09:37.579
but also in 2024 when he said the same thing on a stream with Charles Rixey and with Matt Crawford, also Robert Malone associates.

02:09:37.639 --> 02:09:51.163
So you basically have one malevolent team of anti-vax skeptics that has been put in place on the internet, given books before the pandemic so that no useful resistance would ever come together

02:09:51.863 --> 02:09:57.445
to oppose the pandemic, more importantly, to oppose PCR as a diagnostic.

02:09:57.505 --> 02:10:09.549
Because essentially, these people have effectively run out the clock, apparently, on the FDA and the United States government turning back and saying, hey, wait a minute, what happened in 2020?

02:10:11.049 --> 02:10:12.070
And that's by design.

02:10:12.450 --> 02:10:14.511
That's by malevolent design.

02:10:14.571 --> 02:10:20.413
This script, in that sense, was very successful from the very beginning because they're still there now.

02:10:23.336 --> 02:10:28.620
And that's why I think that Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying are a great way to see through it.

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:39.107
I was connected with them very early by Piper Stover, and I taught them everything that I knew and more, and they went on to ignore it and absorb it and obfuscate it for five years.

02:10:39.668 --> 02:10:50.496
And they are now still grifting as thought leaders, when in reality, they are part of this malevolent governance by social media mythology and by social media performance.

02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:55.363
They deserve the worst kind of treatment if they're in public.

02:10:55.403 --> 02:10:58.585
They deserve to have rotten vegetables thrown at their car.

02:11:00.046 --> 02:11:03.709
They deserve to have rotten vegetables thrown at them when they get out of their car.

02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:09.673
They deserve to have pie, cream pies in their face, like Brett Weinstein.

02:11:09.793 --> 02:11:11.355
All of these people deserve that.

02:11:13.096 --> 02:11:18.120
I think people like Pierre Kory deserve a cream pie in his face.

02:11:19.224 --> 02:11:26.541
I think that somebody like Jessica Rose deserves a pie in her face every time she decides to go public somewhere.

02:11:27.323 --> 02:11:29.448
And I think Robert Malone deserves the same thing.

02:11:35.174 --> 02:11:39.436
So let's see what's going on with- Today, I have a special guest.

02:11:39.456 --> 02:11:43.719
Look, I moved back to the Bay Area so I could talk to smart people at places like UC.

02:11:43.779 --> 02:11:46.000
We are saying that this is scripted bullshit.

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.181
We are saying that these people are on a script.

02:11:48.241 --> 02:11:57.327
We are saying that these people were put in place in order to undermine the authority of the FDA, maybe without having to change a thing or to write a law.

02:11:57.367 --> 02:12:01.189
They would just put people in place to make sure that the FDA never looked back

02:12:01.889 --> 02:12:08.731
and exercised its authority over medical devices and specifically over PCR diagnostics and sequencing.

02:12:09.151 --> 02:12:12.072
This is the malevolent show.

02:12:12.753 --> 02:12:25.157
And if you see the kinds of things that they talk about, the kinds of things that they agree on in this podcast in 2020, you will see why this is a traitorous group of men.

02:12:26.269 --> 02:12:27.490
A traitorous group.

02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:29.552
Yes, in Stanford and in the Bay Area.

02:12:29.792 --> 02:12:31.693
And I was all excited and then COVID hit.

02:12:32.674 --> 02:12:34.215
And it was Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.

02:12:34.295 --> 02:12:35.136
And I hate Zoom.

02:12:35.516 --> 02:12:38.658
So today I have someone I've been wanting to talk to since this pandemic started.

02:12:39.399 --> 02:12:47.525
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a Stanford professor of medicine and he has training and specialty in economics.

02:12:47.565 --> 02:12:49.987
Actually tell me Jay, Jay, who are you, man?

02:12:50.496 --> 02:12:54.957
I am going to read the letter from J.E.

02:12:55.158 --> 02:13:01.880
in Connecticut, and Susan in California, and Alexia in Colorado.

02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:08.422
I won't say any more names, but those are the letters that I'm opening up now that Phila just brought back from the P.O.

02:13:08.462 --> 02:13:08.742
Box.

02:13:08.782 --> 02:13:09.262
Thanks guys.

02:13:10.397 --> 02:13:12.899
Well, okay, so... Not in a metaphysical sense.

02:13:12.939 --> 02:13:13.439
Exactly.

02:13:13.519 --> 02:13:16.622
So, I am a professor of medicine as you said at Stanford University.

02:13:16.642 --> 02:13:19.685
I've been at Stanford on the faculty for about 20 years.

02:13:19.705 --> 02:13:24.329
I have an MD and a PhD in economics and I study health policy and health economics.

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:29.973
I've been working on infectious disease economics and epidemiology for 20 some years now.

02:13:30.954 --> 02:13:34.396
So the reason I wanted to have you on the show was what you just said.

02:13:34.796 --> 02:13:46.802
You have the MD, Stanford trained, and a PhD in economics, which means you can see in a way that many frontline healthcare people, including public health people, aren't able to see the bigger picture.

02:13:46.842 --> 02:13:50.704
Now, you came to prominence during the pandemic.

02:13:51.004 --> 02:13:54.606
I'm a hippocampus expert in the brain, or at least I was.

02:13:54.646 --> 02:13:56.987
And the hippocampus is, of course, seahorse.

02:13:57.567 --> 02:13:58.808
So a lot of times people,

02:13:59.508 --> 02:14:02.958
who study the hippocampus will open their talk with a seahorse.

02:14:04.121 --> 02:14:05.907
I don't know if you knew that or not, but it's a nice card.

02:14:08.466 --> 02:14:13.908
as one of the co-authors of the Stanford seroprevalence study, which raised all kinds of interesting.

02:14:13.928 --> 02:14:19.749
I mean, tell me about that experience because I was talking about your piece early on saying, hey, this is true.

02:14:20.610 --> 02:14:27.511
The actual infection fatality rate of this disease is actually much lower than we thought.

02:14:27.571 --> 02:14:31.993
It's still higher than flu, but it's not as high as they've been saying in China.

02:14:32.013 --> 02:14:33.273
I mean, what was that experience like?

02:14:33.693 --> 02:14:34.554
I mean, that was incredible.

02:14:35.154 --> 02:14:39.137
Just an amazing, in some ways dispiriting, but also exciting experience.

02:14:39.157 --> 02:14:41.479
So, can I go back just a little bit?

02:14:41.599 --> 02:14:42.179
Absolutely.

02:14:42.219 --> 02:14:47.723
So, what got me into it was I had done some work during the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.

02:14:48.203 --> 02:14:49.484
I remember that one.

02:14:49.784 --> 02:14:51.385
I mean, it was a big deal at the time, right?

02:14:51.585 --> 02:15:02.473
But luckily it didn't turn out to be as bad as COVID, but it was, especially at the beginning, people were really, really panicked over the high fatality rates, the case fatality rates that were coming up out of all around the world.

02:15:02.933 --> 02:15:08.495
I remember, I was a practicing hospitalist at Stanford and everybody was like, we're all going to die.

02:15:08.575 --> 02:15:10.215
It was a kind of a catastrophization.

02:15:10.696 --> 02:15:14.037
Yeah, no, it's actually in the early days, there was a good reason.

02:15:14.057 --> 02:15:17.878
There were these case fatality rates that looked like, you know, Ebola.

02:15:17.938 --> 02:15:19.058
I mean, it just looked terrible.

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:30.422
In the months that followed, what happened was people did seroprevalence studies and found that there were many times more cases of infections than there had been cases.

02:15:31.764 --> 02:15:40.428
in H1N1 and the infection fatality rate, which turned out to be about a hundred times less than the initial case fatality rates in the H1N1 case.

02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:49.293
So let me- Oh, so, you know, originally we thought it was really deadly, but once we started testing the background, we found out that lots more people had it.

02:15:49.873 --> 02:15:52.455
And so then it makes the case fatality rate go down.

02:15:52.555 --> 02:15:56.477
So again, once we get the numbers, we can make proper decisions.

02:15:57.017 --> 02:15:57.777
Stop lying!

02:15:58.578 --> 02:15:58.898
Stop!

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:19.328
remember that this guy named Jay Bhattacharya was on my stream years from now and deferred to me as a biologist repeatedly because he didn't understand any of this but in this podcast with this bald jackass he's a biologist in an economy he's a polymath and he's got an answer for everything

02:16:21.263 --> 02:16:24.164
Let me reiterate that for people who don't understand some of that terminology.

02:16:24.204 --> 02:16:34.067
So case fatality rate is when someone is actually tested for a disease, presents to care, and is diagnosed with the disease, and then how many people die out of that group.

02:16:35.187 --> 02:16:44.230
Infection fatality rate is, well, of all the infections that exist, including ones that we weren't able to openly diagnose, what's the rate of fatality in that group?

02:16:44.350 --> 02:16:47.471
And it was 100X different in H1N1.

02:16:49.331 --> 02:16:53.433
And so this got you interested then when COVID came around, I imagine.

02:16:53.634 --> 02:16:55.495
It looked like a repeat to me, right?

02:16:55.555 --> 02:16:59.757
So it looked like the people were finding enormously high case fatality rates.

02:16:59.797 --> 02:17:01.618
I think like World Health Organization said 3.4%.

02:17:01.658 --> 02:17:11.363
There was a piece published in JAMA in February that said, you know, Journal of American Medical Association, we're gonna be eating sardines and it's gonna be cheap and you're gonna like it.

02:17:12.504 --> 02:17:14.045
Nice article, that's awesome.

02:17:14.105 --> 02:17:14.705
Association that said 2.2%.

02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:18.169
And these are terrible numbers.

02:17:18.189 --> 02:17:19.730
These are horrifying numbers.

02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:28.532
These are the kind of numbers that would cause you to lock down the entire planet instantly because you're gonna lose that percentage of your population if everybody gets infected.

02:17:28.592 --> 02:17:29.872
Millions and millions of people dead.

02:17:30.072 --> 02:17:34.433
Lock down the population and millions of people dead.

02:17:34.494 --> 02:17:36.314
Sounds kind of like Kevin McCarran.

02:17:36.734 --> 02:17:37.094
Cool.

02:17:37.634 --> 02:17:38.194
Right.

02:17:38.335 --> 02:17:40.115
If that number is, in the United States alone.

02:17:40.295 --> 02:17:41.135
Alone, right.

02:17:41.295 --> 02:17:42.376
If the number is right.

02:17:44.016 --> 02:17:45.297
But that was what happened at H1N1.

02:17:45.317 --> 02:17:49.039
I thought, okay, well, do we really know how many people actually have it?

02:17:49.659 --> 02:17:53.782
And at the same time, we're worried about how much testing resources we had.

02:17:54.102 --> 02:17:56.323
Remember, there was a shortage of tests.

02:17:56.363 --> 02:18:02.747
So we're holding onto the test to look at people who actually have serious disease, which is what you ought to do from a clinical perspective.

02:18:03.387 --> 02:18:10.952
But then from an epidemiological perspective, can you extrapolate that to say, okay, the population at large is going to, 3% of us are all going to die if we get it.

02:18:12.633 --> 02:18:14.114
And we don't know the answer to that.

02:18:14.775 --> 02:18:16.937
So that's what led to the Stanford seroprevalence study.

02:18:17.097 --> 02:18:17.718
Yeah, yeah.

02:18:17.918 --> 02:18:19.519
And the other seroprevalence studies I've worked on.

02:18:19.559 --> 02:18:23.183
So it was this- So he's worked on several seroprevalence studies.

02:18:23.243 --> 02:18:26.586
And the whole idea was to get the case vitality numbers right.

02:18:27.527 --> 02:18:29.008
I don't know what to say, Alexia.

02:18:29.969 --> 02:18:31.551
And I don't know what to say, Susan.

02:18:33.593 --> 02:18:35.054
Other than I'm never gonna stop.

02:18:35.575 --> 02:18:36.736
And I'm only gonna get better.

02:18:37.879 --> 02:18:40.340
And the biology that I teach is only going to get better.

02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.941
And there's only going to be less of this, not more.

02:18:43.542 --> 02:18:46.903
But right now, this is work we have to do.

02:18:47.344 --> 02:18:52.366
These are people we need to expose and histories we need to archive.

02:18:52.586 --> 02:19:00.250
But as soon as this show lets up just a little bit, as soon as I can get just a little grasp on how awful it is,

02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:07.295
I will be back to teaching biology and I can't thank you enough for this support.

02:19:08.356 --> 02:19:11.699
Three letters in the P.O.

02:19:11.739 --> 02:19:21.608
box from three Americans is already almost enough to get the wind back in my... I mean, I don't even know what to say.

02:19:23.749 --> 02:19:25.829
Thank you very much, that's all I can really say.

02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:28.570
There's this hypothesis, like how many people actually have it?

02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:29.950
How deadly actually is it?

02:19:30.310 --> 02:19:31.551
And so how did you do this study?

02:19:31.591 --> 02:19:40.152
Because there was a ton of controversy around the methods and the actual sensitivity, specificity of the assay that you use and all that.

02:19:40.212 --> 02:19:42.873
Yeah, so that was a lot of like confusion around that, right?

02:19:42.893 --> 02:19:48.894
So we wanted to do a study that could be done very, very quickly, put in the field very, very quickly.

02:19:49.694 --> 02:19:57.016
At the time of the study, the FDA had approved for use some of these, they're called lateral flow assays.

02:19:57.036 --> 02:19:59.177
They look like pregnancy tests, like little pregnancy kits.

02:19:59.217 --> 02:20:02.998
Lateral flow assays that were produced in China.

02:20:03.738 --> 02:20:07.679
Lateral flow assays are how they defined the pandemic also in the UK.

02:20:08.919 --> 02:20:14.041
Lateral flow assays are about multiple antibodies specific for something.

02:20:16.041 --> 02:20:23.327
Lateral flow assays are based on patent technology that is now considered obsolete and not biologically relevant.

02:20:24.608 --> 02:20:27.990
Lateral flow tests, he doesn't know how they work.

02:20:28.451 --> 02:20:29.752
He didn't design it.

02:20:31.673 --> 02:20:34.055
He just ordered one and used it.

02:20:37.197 --> 02:20:40.280
This is a very malevolent actor put in place

02:20:43.191 --> 02:20:51.020
You can almost see the whole pandemic as being an Indian intelligence operation in cooperation with some very traitorous Americans.

02:20:51.161 --> 02:20:52.622
And it wouldn't be that far off.

02:20:53.063 --> 02:20:56.307
It's definitely not a bunch of Chinese people or a bunch of Russians.

02:20:57.008 --> 02:21:01.453
I certainly don't see any, a bunch of Ukrainian biolab scientists all running around now.

02:21:03.124 --> 02:21:08.087
So, and the one we used had pretty good error properties.

02:21:08.187 --> 02:21:09.688
You know, every medical test has errors.

02:21:09.828 --> 02:21:12.750
I mean, there's just not a... And you can't avoid that.

02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:19.034
That's just the nature of... We don't have a tricorder that can automatically tell you exactly what's wrong with you, right?

02:21:19.054 --> 02:21:22.156
We need to look at the numbers and interpret them.

02:21:23.337 --> 02:21:34.649
At the time, the FDA had put together a, you know, had approved for use these little lateral flow assay tests, including the one we used, for sale, but they hadn't approved them for general use in the population.

02:21:35.731 --> 02:21:35.871
Right?

02:21:36.371 --> 02:21:39.473
We use them for research purposes, but not for clinical purposes.

02:21:40.653 --> 02:21:41.353
So we use one of those.

02:21:41.473 --> 02:21:42.454
The reason it was very simple.

02:21:44.134 --> 02:21:46.435
There are two kinds of tests to do antibody testing.

02:21:46.455 --> 02:21:48.576
There's these ELISA tests, which are pretty accurate.

02:21:50.037 --> 02:21:51.357
And then these lateral fluorescence.

02:21:51.377 --> 02:21:53.118
For the ELISA, you have to draw venous blood.

02:21:53.238 --> 02:21:56.259
So I just got a text message from plus 63.

02:21:56.359 --> 02:21:57.820
Where is plus 63?

02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.901
This is really remarkable.

02:22:00.021 --> 02:22:01.201
So plus 63, country code 63.

02:22:08.948 --> 02:22:09.588
Philippines.

02:22:09.648 --> 02:22:30.177
So I got a Philippine, a call from the Philippines that says that I have a outstanding traffic ticket with the Pennsylvania State and I should go to a www, no, no, it's not a www.pa.gov, it's pa.gov slash jkaw.win.

02:22:30.917 --> 02:22:31.617
Wow.

02:22:32.278 --> 02:22:33.638
That's incredible.

02:22:34.338 --> 02:22:35.179
Holy shit.

02:22:35.933 --> 02:22:36.936
That's pretty funny.

02:22:38.359 --> 02:22:39.462
Well done, dorks.

02:22:40.825 --> 02:22:41.567
Anyway, here we go.

02:22:42.249 --> 02:22:42.990
Back to the show.

02:22:44.036 --> 02:22:52.962
But it's really hard in the middle of a pandemic to go out and find, you know, can I draw venous blood from you, a big vial of it, or I can just do a little finger stick.

02:22:53.903 --> 02:22:58.286
The nice thing about epidemiologic work is you can correct for the errors, which is what we did.

02:22:59.286 --> 02:23:07.192
Now, actually, I've run three seroprevalence studies, one in Santa Clara County, one in LA County, and one with Major League Baseball.

02:23:09.273 --> 02:23:10.733
Did you get to meet a lot of baseball players?

02:23:10.754 --> 02:23:23.137
I got to meet a lot of the, no baseball players, but I met, I mean, it was sort of- They sent Jay Bhattacharya to a owner's meeting to convince people that testing was appropriate.

02:23:25.518 --> 02:23:27.098
See what's happening here.

02:23:27.158 --> 02:23:37.601
He acted as a national security agent and went and helped to bamboozle a bunch of baseball owners about things that he's not an expert in.

02:23:39.432 --> 02:23:43.598
I got to be in a meeting with all the owners, it was just fantastic.

02:23:43.838 --> 02:23:48.644
I had to contain myself when I met the Yankees owner, but that's another thing.

02:23:48.724 --> 02:23:57.815
So I ran three different studies and the interesting thing about the studies was we used very different methods to try to disseminate them.

02:23:58.436 --> 02:24:00.337
So the Santa Clara study was the first one.

02:24:01.598 --> 02:24:08.462
It was a big study, 2,000 some people in the Bay Area, actually in Santa Clara County.

02:24:09.382 --> 02:24:12.984
We wrote the study very quickly and we released it through an open science process.

02:24:13.004 --> 02:24:13.765
Like a pre-print.

02:24:13.865 --> 02:24:14.985
A pre-print, right, exactly.

02:24:15.025 --> 02:24:18.427
So now the traditional path involves sending it to a journal.

02:24:18.627 --> 02:24:22.709
The journal then sends it to three anonymous reviewers.

02:24:23.050 --> 02:24:27.132
No one will hear about it except me, and that's how I spend my life dealing with this.

02:24:27.372 --> 02:24:29.173
three anonymous reviewers, all of whom always hate me.

02:24:31.914 --> 02:24:34.075
So you're not used to the whole planet hating you at once.

02:24:34.115 --> 02:24:35.475
Yeah, no, that was interesting.

02:24:35.495 --> 02:24:38.937
So we sent it and I got 10,000 peer reviews in one day.

02:24:38.957 --> 02:24:40.137
Oh my gosh.

02:24:40.457 --> 02:24:43.178
And it was, I mean, you know what, actually it was kind of interesting, exciting.

02:24:43.198 --> 02:24:44.319
I learned a lot, right?

02:24:44.479 --> 02:24:53.102
So we'd made a, what I would characterize as a relatively minor error in standard error calculation, which we corrected within a week.

02:24:53.322 --> 02:24:53.542
Right.

02:24:54.042 --> 02:24:54.843
And you know,

02:24:55.683 --> 02:25:01.687
But making an error allowed there to be a little fuss on social media about how he doesn't know what he's talking about.

02:25:01.727 --> 02:25:04.768
And don't underestimate the orchestration of that either.

02:25:05.889 --> 02:25:08.450
He can say, oh, we made a little error and we corrected it right away.

02:25:08.511 --> 02:25:11.052
But at the time, that was part of the little fuel.

02:25:11.552 --> 02:25:19.677
The day after this was released, Charles Rixey did a post about it on Prometheus Shrugged.

02:25:20.217 --> 02:25:24.340
And Tim Poole talked about this shit on his podcast.

02:25:25.145 --> 02:25:25.287
So.

02:25:26.277 --> 02:25:28.658
Don't mess around here, this is serious.

02:25:29.218 --> 02:25:31.619
The number that we got was absolutely stunning.

02:25:31.959 --> 02:25:37.201
What we found was that the disease was 50 times more prevalent than people thought based on just the case numbers.

02:25:37.221 --> 02:25:41.363
So people thought in Santa Clara County, there were a thousand cases as of April 3rd, I think it was.

02:25:41.743 --> 02:25:47.305
Remember what he said in his introduction, maybe I missed it already because I was reading the mail.

02:25:47.786 --> 02:25:55.669
But in his introduction, if I recall correctly, he says that he worked on flu before this, he worked on Ebola, and he worked on HIV.

02:25:56.469 --> 02:26:06.452
So he's done the epidemiology of previously orchestrated mythologies before and contributed to them under the banner of Obama's administration.

02:26:06.512 --> 02:26:09.694
This is a Democratic operative.

02:26:11.314 --> 02:26:18.116
Just like Donald Trump is just a Democratic operative who's playing the same role that he's playing a role for Hillary Clinton.

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:19.957
Now Hillary Clinton doesn't have to do anything.

02:26:22.803 --> 02:26:29.587
But in fact, based on the study, you could tell 50,000 people had had some antibody evidence of it at the same time.

02:26:29.867 --> 02:26:34.929
Right, which would correspond to an infection fatality rate at that time of what?

02:26:35.009 --> 02:26:35.570
About 2 in 1,000.

02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:38.131
So that means out of 1,000 people who got the infection, 998 survived.

02:26:38.171 --> 02:26:39.912
So 0.2% fatality, so double what we think the mortality is.

02:26:46.755 --> 02:26:47.055
for flu.

02:26:47.075 --> 02:26:49.996
Yeah, although I'm not 100% sure I know what the flu, I know that.

02:26:50.016 --> 02:26:56.359
So it was still double than what flu is, but he's not sure what flu mortality is, but he worked on flu before the pandemic.

02:26:56.419 --> 02:26:59.000
So I don't really understand why he's playing dumb here.

02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:01.540
The evidence is unclear.

02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:06.362
No one's done the same kind of infection fatality rate numbers that they've done for COVID, they've done with the flu.

02:27:06.542 --> 02:27:09.243
So in many ways, we're comparing apples to oranges when we're comparing flu.

02:27:09.263 --> 02:27:12.144
Yeah, so let's come back to that flu comparison, because it is interesting and important.

02:27:12.164 --> 02:27:13.585
But I think the key thing is,

02:27:15.279 --> 02:27:17.923
How much would you change your life for a 200,000 risk?

02:27:19.905 --> 02:27:21.387
And there's a couple other things we learned.

02:27:21.667 --> 02:27:27.635
So one is that the- So the risk is real and if it was different, it would kill a lot more people.

02:27:27.735 --> 02:27:30.719
But right now we estimate that it's not gonna kill that many people.

02:27:30.779 --> 02:27:31.941
So what would you risk?

02:27:33.462 --> 02:27:35.424
And now you see the malevolence of the trap.

02:27:35.584 --> 02:27:37.487
They all accept the novel virus.

02:27:38.147 --> 02:27:40.290
If you're older, it's much higher.

02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:42.652
It's probably much worse than the flu, actually, if you're older.

02:27:42.872 --> 02:27:43.773
Order of magnitude.

02:27:43.814 --> 02:27:44.715
Yeah.

02:27:44.755 --> 02:27:54.686
So if you're over 70 versus if you're, let's say you're under 15 or under 10, it's on the order of a thousand to one difference in mortality probability.

02:27:56.579 --> 02:28:14.912
My guess is that supplementary oxygen is just as dangerous to old people relative to young people, and that old people are more likely to develop ARDS earlier, maybe even with lower concentrations or application level of supplementary oxygen.

02:28:15.432 --> 02:28:16.253
Figure that one out.

02:28:17.202 --> 02:28:21.923
Flu is much more deadly if you're older, if you're over 65, let's say 65 or 70.

02:28:23.104 --> 02:28:26.644
And if you're under- The flu or COVID you were talking about?

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:26.885
I'm sorry.

02:28:28.265 --> 02:28:32.126
Oops, that should... What happened there?

02:28:35.587 --> 02:28:36.047
What is this?

02:28:39.168 --> 02:28:39.788
That should work.

02:28:41.608 --> 02:28:42.108
Oh, there we go.

02:28:42.729 --> 02:28:43.669
But it's now crashing.

02:28:47.725 --> 02:28:49.049
I'm just going to start it over again.

02:28:49.149 --> 02:28:49.811
Sorry about that.

02:28:51.175 --> 02:28:52.176
and we'll just fast forward it.

02:28:52.196 --> 02:28:54.557
Hey everyone, Dr. Z. Welcome to the ZDoggMD show.

02:28:54.577 --> 02:28:56.318
Today I have a special guest.

02:28:56.338 --> 02:28:56.478
Look.

02:28:56.578 --> 02:28:56.998
Exactly.

02:28:57.058 --> 02:29:00.440
So now the traditional path involves sending it to a journal.

02:29:00.660 --> 02:29:06.963
The journal then sends it to three, there's just not a, but there's, and you can't avoid that.

02:29:07.023 --> 02:29:10.965
That's just the nature of, we don't have a tricorder that can automatically tell you.

02:29:11.646 --> 02:29:13.427
It's, what it is, is a few things.

02:29:13.967 --> 02:29:17.829
One is the set of people that are getting infected are less vulnerable to it.

02:29:18.129 --> 02:29:18.970
They tend to be younger.

02:29:19.930 --> 02:29:21.831
And so they just don't die at high rates from it.

02:29:22.192 --> 02:29:24.814
The second, we were better at managing, better at treating it.

02:29:25.394 --> 02:29:25.534
Right?

02:29:25.614 --> 02:29:27.215
So the- Dexamethasone.

02:29:27.515 --> 02:29:27.896
Exactly.

02:29:27.956 --> 02:29:28.936
Not intubating everyone.

02:29:29.037 --> 02:29:31.258
Not killing people with ventilators, right?

02:29:31.298 --> 02:29:33.360
I mean, that seems like a really good idea.

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:33.580
Yeah.

02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:38.563
Not killing people with ventilators, ha ha ha.

02:29:38.643 --> 02:29:55.275
Dexamethasone was described on a podcast by Robert Malone with Paul Cuttrell as a hammer for the immune system and a way for them to clear out ICUs of old people and send them back to care homes where they could die of pneumonia.

02:29:56.724 --> 02:30:14.604
So it's a weird thing for them to mention dexamethasone when about, I don't know, six months or a year later in August, Robert Malone's going to joke about dexamethasone as a hammer for the immune system in a way that they got the fatality rate to go up in old people in New York.

02:30:15.444 --> 02:30:16.205
Crazy, huh?

02:30:16.825 --> 02:30:18.106
They all know the script.

02:30:18.466 --> 02:30:20.528
It's almost like the same guy's writing it.

02:30:21.468 --> 02:30:24.931
Which by the way, wasn't clear in the beginning at all.

02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:28.293
So not to disparage people who are intubating everyone, but we just didn't know.

02:30:28.414 --> 02:30:33.377
Yeah, no, look, I have a lot of sympathy and people were really brave going in when we don't know the numbers.

02:30:33.798 --> 02:30:35.319
I honor that, absolutely.

02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:38.621
But it is absolutely the case.

02:30:38.641 --> 02:30:42.724
We've learned a lot about how to treat the disease and we're much better at managing it than once were.

02:30:44.125 --> 02:30:46.046
I think that kind of news ought to get out more.

02:30:46.086 --> 02:30:50.749
We learned to treat the disease is such a lie.

02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:59.534
And of course, it has to do with also ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and the proper pressure in the ventilators and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:30:59.974 --> 02:31:03.676
This is all a lie because it presumed that there was something to learn.

02:31:05.477 --> 02:31:09.760
It presumes that there was something to learn instead of something to unlearn.

02:31:11.639 --> 02:31:13.240
That seems like an important fact.

02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:17.401
Our understanding of the disease shouldn't be frozen in amber in March.

02:31:17.561 --> 02:31:21.063
So you're preaching to the choir because I just did a video on this on the cases up, deaths down.

02:31:21.763 --> 02:31:31.207
I actually think that there is a lot of catastrophization and misunderstanding and there's been a polarity that I've not seen in science ever.

02:31:32.087 --> 02:31:33.728
And it shouldn't be, it should be looking.

02:31:35.305 --> 02:31:38.506
I am gonna say that we have a big problem on our hands.

02:31:38.586 --> 02:31:40.867
Oh, I think I left the pause button in there.

02:31:40.947 --> 02:31:41.708
That's what this is.

02:31:41.968 --> 02:31:42.688
I see it now.

02:31:43.308 --> 02:31:46.729
I have to remove that and then this would work, right?

02:31:46.769 --> 02:31:48.150
Because then this will just play.

02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:50.111
But I'm not gonna watch this one anymore.

02:31:51.111 --> 02:32:13.303
Because I need to go to the gym and everyone dr. Z welcome to the show Hey, I have a special guest look I move back it is scripted bullshit but it's really important to see how scripted it is and what they talk about because It will reveal without us beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was scripted from the beginning and that's the reason why he bumped into me a couple times at barbecues, but

02:32:13.883 --> 02:32:21.927
did deferred to me all the time as the biologist and eventually just resorted to telling me to shut up about Robert Malone because that's who's behind him.

02:32:21.987 --> 02:32:23.548
That's who's providing the script.

02:32:24.349 --> 02:32:27.630
And these people are on a script provided by Robert Malone.

02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:32.033
I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that Marty McCary is too.

02:32:32.113 --> 02:32:33.994
It's all is that this RNA exists.

02:32:34.214 --> 02:32:35.114
You can capture it.

02:32:35.174 --> 02:32:36.035
You can sequence it.

02:32:36.095 --> 02:32:38.296
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:32:38.356 --> 02:32:39.317
It's all one script.

02:32:39.357 --> 02:32:40.838
They're all on the same script.

02:32:40.898 --> 02:32:51.105
The Human Genome Project is the script and they want you to blame the bad guys like, you know, Gavi and J&J and Pfizer when it's much bigger than that.

02:32:51.626 --> 02:32:55.008
It's so big that they had to kill somebody like Brandy Vaughn.

02:32:55.048 --> 02:32:59.452
It's so big that they had to convince Brian Hooker to use the word autism even though he didn't.

02:32:59.992 --> 02:33:07.434
It's so big that they had to have somebody like Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy come over to the United States and recycle their show.

02:33:07.854 --> 02:33:22.457
It's so big that they needed a lot of platforms to divide people on and they've rolled out even more platforms to divide people on because it's so big they need us to teach this bad biology to our children.

02:33:22.817 --> 02:33:25.037
It's so big they can't do it themselves.

02:33:25.497 --> 02:33:28.218
We have to accept endemicity.

02:33:28.278 --> 02:33:29.398
We have to accept

02:33:29.898 --> 02:33:31.123
public health as an answer.

02:33:31.163 --> 02:33:35.640
We have to accept virology as a science or this whole thing falls apart.

02:33:36.832 --> 02:33:43.756
For all the marbles, that's why there is a fake anti-vax movement that has captured America and the rest of the Western world.

02:33:44.177 --> 02:33:51.181
They've done it by turning an irreducibly complex background into something spreading with non-specific PCR tests.

02:33:51.241 --> 02:33:53.142
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot do that.

02:33:53.923 --> 02:33:58.546
If you use PCR to find their ghosts, the ghosts don't become real.

02:33:59.026 --> 02:34:00.347
You just become dumb.

02:34:01.047 --> 02:34:04.628
Ladies and gentlemen, please share this stream as far as you can.

02:34:05.008 --> 02:34:06.029
We'll be on all week.

02:34:06.569 --> 02:34:12.231
Usually I'm going to try and start at 10.10, but it's looking like 11.11 is more like it, but 10.10 is my target.

02:34:12.591 --> 02:34:15.252
Harney cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:34:15.312 --> 02:34:22.475
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime and the population pyramids are a problem that you need to understand in order to see how they did this.

02:34:23.669 --> 02:34:27.112
why it was a biological opportunity that just need to be lied about.

02:34:27.653 --> 02:34:28.874
Thanks very much for being here.

02:34:28.894 --> 02:34:30.755
I love you all very much.

02:34:30.795 --> 02:34:33.558
From everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:34:33.798 --> 02:34:34.679
You can capture it.

02:34:34.739 --> 02:34:35.600
You can sequence it.

02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:40.985
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:42.586
We will not call autism.

02:34:42.706 --> 02:34:44.227
I don't like the word autism.

02:34:44.868 --> 02:34:46.109
Um, he was actually damaged.

02:34:46.529 --> 02:34:47.050
He was neuro.

02:34:50.935 --> 02:34:51.936
1111 works for you.

02:34:51.976 --> 02:34:52.657
It works for me.

02:34:52.697 --> 02:34:57.581
I just I'm gonna pull the trigger when I'm ready to go and a lot of times I just need an extra hour.

02:34:57.661 --> 02:34:59.703
So We'll just keep it there.

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.084
Thank you very much for being here.

02:35:01.164 --> 02:35:09.551
Thank you very much to David to Susan and to Alexia an incredible amount of generosity in those three envelopes.

02:35:09.731 --> 02:35:19.319
Thank you very much I assure you my family will will use it very wisely You're putting sandwiches on the table, thank you very much.

02:35:19.339 --> 02:35:19.439
Yeah
