00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
No. It might not be the most beautiful sound, but there's no noise. There's no none of

00:13.240 --> 00:24.720
that static key stuff we used to get. So that's good. All right. Here comes J.J. Kui PhD.

00:24.720 --> 00:36.080
And this is my first time meeting him, so... Oh, I... You were on my show, you crazy man.

00:36.080 --> 00:46.280
No, not at all, just a pinger, too, on the email and the chat, that's all.

00:46.280 --> 00:53.440
What you talking about, Willis? You were on my show. Who, me? Yeah, you. Yeah. You were

00:53.440 --> 00:58.560
on his show. You were on my show. Are you serious? Yeah, you're a crazy old man, but that's

00:58.560 --> 01:05.960
all right. I like that. That's funny. Hey, I might be crazy, but I'm not old. Very good.

01:05.960 --> 01:15.440
No, no way. Well, I was on your show. Why was I on your show? I interviewed you. That's

01:15.440 --> 01:24.080
why you crazy person. That's right. It wasn't a very memorable interview, apparently, but that's

01:24.080 --> 01:29.280
okay. I don't take any insults. I'm a terrible interviewer. Oh, it's just, you know what it is.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.320
It's we doing, you know, sometimes we do two shows a day, you work in your ass off some of my,

01:34.320 --> 01:38.560
I'm sorry, I forgot about it. Do I need to turn on some more light? That doesn't look very good to me.

01:39.520 --> 01:44.160
See your something to see your face a little better would be would be nice.

01:46.080 --> 01:54.640
And that looks like the gig at home studio. Mm hmm. Yes. Now, what would you like me to call you

01:54.640 --> 01:59.280
Jay? Is it Jay? Is that what you like? Jay is fine with me. Yeah, if you want to get funny,

01:59.280 --> 02:05.200
you can say Dr. Jay, but I I prefer Jay. It's fine. Don't I don't take that seriously.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.920
What about professor? I don't guess you know, it doesn't work. I'm not a professor anymore.

02:10.560 --> 02:15.680
Well, what Dr. what Dr. bike rider? Dr. bike rider. That's good. There you go.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.200
All right. Well, gentlemen, it's your time. You ready? We are. Okay. I think.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.120
All right. Comes to the funky music.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.480
Dr.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.720
And hello, everybody.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.480
I'm John O'Loughlin. Welcome to McDuff lives and it's Wednesday night. It's a Wednesday night trio

03:10.480 --> 03:18.160
and tonight it's my great pleasure to introduce a new trio with J. J. Cooey PhD, Mark Koolack of

03:18.160 --> 03:24.320
Whosetonic Live and Myself and I'm really, really excited to get together with you guys. I've

03:24.320 --> 03:29.360
actually been looking forward to this for about four months now and I'll tell you what really got

03:29.360 --> 03:37.760
me going was the infectious clone hypothesis that J. J. Cooey publishes on his gigaome biological

03:37.760 --> 03:46.320
channel on Twitch and I think that the presentation that he's done is tremendous and helps me to

03:46.320 --> 03:51.600
understand things that I just couldn't understand before but it makes a lot of sense to me so I

03:51.600 --> 03:57.440
want to talk about that tonight. I also want to say to Mark Koolack that Mark Koolack has really

03:58.000 --> 04:04.480
been blowing my mind with all of his work for about four years now but in terms of

04:05.120 --> 04:12.640
the the current alleged pandemic or whatever you want to call it, the work that you did

04:13.680 --> 04:22.960
and others but exposing the Snohomish County man thing really is a way to open the discussion I

04:22.960 --> 04:27.680
think with people that are not familiar with how fishy this whole thing really is.

04:28.800 --> 04:35.440
So to start with the Snohomish County man and that really kind of broke down my resistance to

04:36.960 --> 04:45.600
opposing the authorities in this thing, now we have comes along J. Cooey with his infectious

04:45.600 --> 04:52.240
clones theory which I have tried to put together in a podcast of my own to try to you know tell

04:52.240 --> 04:57.920
my subscribers what it's like and I don't know how well I did but what I want to do tonight is to

04:57.920 --> 05:06.240
try to verify my work and try to push forward in in illuminating this to everybody else.

05:07.440 --> 05:15.920
So infectious clones I I googled it I don't know if either of you ever googled infectious clones

05:15.920 --> 05:25.600
but what came up was some virology studies about plants about tobacco and stuff that where they

05:25.600 --> 05:33.120
say oh yeah we we have to have infectious clones we use them to study these viruses because

05:34.000 --> 05:42.560
these viruses are ephemeral these viruses are mRNA viruses and that is JJ and Mark have been

05:42.560 --> 05:53.040
pounding in this for years now is now clearly not a perfect copy and so JJ's work in exposing

05:53.040 --> 05:59.520
that the the metaphor that he uses of a original being copied onto a CD and then the CD gets

05:59.520 --> 06:05.360
copied onto a bunch of cassette tapes and if you've ever had that experience you know that by the

06:05.360 --> 06:10.880
time it's on a cassette tape it's it's degraded great deal and that hope and that's the metaphor

06:10.880 --> 06:16.800
that I like to think of in terms of wow they can make something maybe infectious

06:17.760 --> 06:24.400
but it's not going to be infectious forever it's going to it's that lifestyle that lifetime is

06:24.400 --> 06:29.920
going to be limited by the fact that it's RNA and not DNA which DNA would last a lot longer.

06:30.800 --> 06:39.920
So this is where I am kind of jumping off from those two big illuminations for me

06:39.920 --> 06:46.160
the Snohomish County man the story and and so much flaky stuff between then and now where they

06:46.160 --> 06:51.280
you know I mean if they really wanted to to do some contract contact tracing from Snohomish

06:51.280 --> 06:57.440
County man they should have started by getting his address his phone number and his date of birth

06:57.440 --> 07:04.080
but they didn't even do that. Well guys let me turn it over to you and ask you if I've made a fair

07:04.080 --> 07:09.840
summary of what we've been what I've been talking about so far and and and maybe start with Mark

07:09.840 --> 07:18.960
since Mark you've been the Snohomish County man for me. Absolutely I think that's a it's a good start

07:19.680 --> 07:30.160
and it's a so to summarize or a one review is that you're willing to your you are in the act

07:30.240 --> 07:37.440
in the process of revisiting the the official narrative explanation of what happened

07:38.160 --> 07:46.880
and possibly even questioning some of the or the primary alternative narrative which has been

07:46.880 --> 07:54.720
packaged up for us and maybe you're considering the possibility that it could be maybe somewhere in

07:54.720 --> 08:00.640
the middle that they're trying to come up with an explanation actually satisfies all of the data

08:01.680 --> 08:09.600
that you are or the evidence that is before you and before everyone else and this is a an

08:09.600 --> 08:17.440
important time because people in your situation right now are encouraged to ask I think sometimes

08:17.440 --> 08:24.320
the wrong questions which lead people right back into it's going to be one thing or another thing

08:25.600 --> 08:33.600
I'll review Snohomish County man in a second but you know one of them for example would be

08:34.800 --> 08:43.440
I mean I'll let Jay handle the the the erroneous approach of do viruses exist but another one is

08:44.560 --> 08:53.360
was there any pandemic and that's a tricky question to answer because I think when someone says no

08:55.360 --> 09:02.240
which I agree with but you have to then say that doesn't mean if there's no pandemic that doesn't

09:02.240 --> 09:08.880
mean there was there was no excess death there's a big difference there and it can be it can very

09:08.880 --> 09:14.080
easily sound like if someone were to say well I don't think the conditions of a pandemic of

09:14.080 --> 09:18.800
iris which was spreading endlessly from person to person around the globe was really happening

09:19.760 --> 09:27.120
you immediately get put into a box of I guess you assume that no one died right and of course that's

09:27.120 --> 09:33.120
not what the person who goes there would be saying so we've been encouraged to ask I think

09:33.120 --> 09:39.120
sometimes the wrong question first and which just leads us back into camp A or camp B and

09:39.120 --> 09:46.560
avoids the the critical thinking in the middle which really help us sort things out that's exactly

09:46.560 --> 09:55.920
where I think I think that Jay's work comes in because then you have the I think his name was

09:55.920 --> 10:03.840
Giordano the kind of military Syop guy that's telling everybody well here's here's how you can

10:03.840 --> 10:09.440
freak out the entire world you know you can make them all think that there's a there's a pandemic

10:09.440 --> 10:15.120
that suddenly appeared you know that everybody's going to be sick you know and there's going to be

10:15.200 --> 10:20.960
bodies on the streets and here's how we do it and he's this guy named Giordano who Jay has

10:20.960 --> 10:27.520
reported on and so I think that is that's the way I would dispel that stuff mark would be to say

10:27.520 --> 10:34.320
well look I mean listen to what Jay has to say let's let's turn to that Jay let's go ahead

10:34.320 --> 10:41.520
and and and and kind of introduce or or tell me how did I do in trying to explain the basics of

10:41.600 --> 10:46.000
your hypothesis well I'm actually really impressed that Google was so confessional

10:46.800 --> 10:54.960
and forthright with with the truth and I find it very nice that you you use the word ephemeral

10:55.600 --> 11:02.160
because I think for the most part virology in the 70s and 80s was really the study of

11:02.160 --> 11:08.240
something very ephemeral and they all understood that and it was uh it was often a joke you know

11:08.320 --> 11:14.640
everybody uh joking about studying virology was joking about studying things that you can't study

11:14.640 --> 11:23.440
and so it's uh I think it's a very very exciting time if you if you if you want my honest opinion

11:23.440 --> 11:32.560
because it's the truth in this particular scenario is so some authors use the word acidic to describe

11:32.560 --> 11:40.320
a truth that kind of dissolves all the other stuff that's around it and this truth that RNA

11:40.320 --> 11:47.040
has a sort of limited fidelity and a limited lifespan and a sort of limited utility as for

11:47.040 --> 11:54.960
transmitting information um and these limitations and how they play into the viral dynamics of things

11:54.960 --> 12:02.080
before the pandemic versus after um we have been given this incredibly simplified cartoon

12:02.080 --> 12:08.320
of how a virus works where you know variants can sweep the planet and the planet changes color

12:08.320 --> 12:16.960
and then it changes color again as delta takes over whatever and this kind of of behavior has

12:16.960 --> 12:21.600
never been observed before this kind of fidelity has never been observed before this kind of coverage

12:21.680 --> 12:28.320
by a a single RNA molecules never been it's never been documented before and yet we're just supposed

12:28.320 --> 12:34.400
to believe this because everybody is very united in how they insist that it's true and I think

12:34.400 --> 12:40.720
that's the trick is that as long as people just hold that line there's going to be a good portion

12:40.720 --> 12:46.000
of people that aren't going to be able to penetrate that consensus um with regard to so

12:46.000 --> 12:52.560
how much county man I think mark and I story really tied so nicely together because

12:53.120 --> 12:59.040
the biology of coronavirus as you describe for tobacco mosaic viruses is very similar it's an

12:59.040 --> 13:04.720
ephemeral thing usually what they can do is they can find a sequence in the wild but beyond that

13:05.600 --> 13:09.600
maybe they can culture it for a little while enough to get enough material which permits the

13:09.600 --> 13:15.760
sequencing but at some point in time they need to go back to this DNA template generate enough

13:15.760 --> 13:21.680
of that DNA to convert to RNA and then they can repeat the experiment over and over with the same

13:22.400 --> 13:28.400
you know baseline RNA starting point but if you're starting from the wild you're always starting

13:28.400 --> 13:38.320
from something new and so that's why for example if you look at the the coronavirus literature before

13:38.320 --> 13:45.600
the pandemic you will find that the mass majority of the way the methodology that they found coronavirus

13:45.600 --> 13:52.800
was to look for a single gene the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and if they found that gene then in

13:52.800 --> 13:58.080
that same sample they would use a bunch of random primers to try and amplify everything that was

13:58.080 --> 14:04.640
in there and then try to match it up with other known coronavirus genes but it was already assumed

14:04.640 --> 14:11.120
that there was a coronavirus in there if they found this extremely conserved RNA dependent RNA

14:11.120 --> 14:18.400
polymerase and so the way that we found coronaviruses and the way that we identified them before the

14:18.400 --> 14:25.520
pandemic was so different and so less specific and so much more broad stroke meaning let's just find

14:25.520 --> 14:33.840
it never mind trying to say which one it is and this level of or sorry this lack of fidelity is

14:33.840 --> 14:39.120
just evident for all of the years before the pandemic and then suddenly there's this switch

14:39.840 --> 14:47.360
to an insistence that not only can we detect them with high fidelity but any company can put

14:47.360 --> 14:54.320
together a product which can replicate this extremely exquisite detection method which

14:55.520 --> 15:01.040
one of the frustrations I have to confess is that that's what they bold us over with right because

15:01.840 --> 15:07.680
with the Sohomish County man and I think this is where Mark and I really connected the Sohomish

15:07.680 --> 15:11.200
County man and I want Mark to come back in here in a minute because I'm going to miss a lot of

15:11.200 --> 15:22.480
these details the Sohomish County man checks every virology box he was a guy who wasn't that sick

15:23.200 --> 15:29.680
didn't really need to go to the hospital when he came to the hospital he wasn't dying they took

15:29.680 --> 15:35.920
a sample of him and lo and behold it grew in a dish which is really rare for coronavirus and

15:35.920 --> 15:43.280
especially rare if the person isn't vomiting by viral load right obviously he wasn't sick so

15:43.920 --> 15:52.800
did he have much we don't know but enough for them to grow and sequence and it happened in a place

15:52.800 --> 16:00.800
where a guy was already ready with some kind of nanoparticle and was already ready with this

16:00.800 --> 16:06.400
computer program to take the sequence that came out of this random guy that they just let

16:06.400 --> 16:14.160
leave the hospital and and this sequence was turned into a vaccine candidate in like a week

16:15.280 --> 16:22.160
and so this all occurs just kind of lucky we got a three-dimensional reconstruction of the spike

16:22.160 --> 16:28.160
protein which showed a novel fear and cleavage site and a guy who was ready to make a vaccine

16:28.160 --> 16:33.600
and a patient that just happened to have the perfectly culturable virus that matched the

16:33.600 --> 16:39.760
lulon sequence i might have missed something but i mean is that not a wonderful confluence of details

16:40.560 --> 16:46.480
well let me just let me just get one clarification and i never have understood the word primer could

16:46.480 --> 16:55.120
you tell us please what that is sure um if you uh do i have this um if you i'm going to do it really

16:55.120 --> 17:05.280
quick if you um if you sequence uh a RNA sequence think of it like a sentence um so think of the

17:05.280 --> 17:13.120
sentence like the quick brown the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog um and if you take that

17:13.120 --> 17:19.840
sentence then the primers would be the in the beginning of the thing and it would be uh g o d

17:20.400 --> 17:27.120
at the end dog and so those two primers would stick to the beginning of the sentence in the end of

17:27.120 --> 17:33.040
the sentence and allow an enzyme to copy the sentence from the end to the beginning or from the beginning

17:33.040 --> 17:40.160
to the end and so the primers are the two short RNA sequences that you're using to probe your sample

17:40.720 --> 17:46.160
and you hope that they'll bind to RNA and the sample and create a double-stranded RNA that

17:46.160 --> 17:51.120
can be copied and that's kind of a simplification actually there's going to be some molecular

17:51.120 --> 17:55.920
biologists they're going to say he doesn't know what he's talking about so let me let me back that

17:55.920 --> 18:03.440
up a minute the RNA in any sample is first converted to DNA and that conversion is done with reverse

18:03.440 --> 18:11.200
transcriptase so then you have DNA fragments which are it are complementary to the RNA that was in

18:11.200 --> 18:19.120
your original sample then you use primers to find those DNA copies of the RNA in the original sample

18:19.120 --> 18:25.680
and those DNA fragments are amplified by your primers and your primers need to be specific for

18:25.680 --> 18:32.320
that DNA but essentially what you're doing is you're designing primers which will be the beginning

18:32.320 --> 18:39.280
or end words of the coronavirus gene that you're looking to find and that's how you're you're trying

18:39.280 --> 18:45.040
to find these different molecular signals regardless of what you're using PCR to find

18:45.040 --> 18:52.160
the primers are the two the two sequences that you're using to probe all of the DNA that's in your sample

18:53.200 --> 18:58.480
while that was a long explanation that was a terrible answer i'm sorry but you know i i thought

18:58.480 --> 19:04.240
i i'd force you to do it because i've heard that word so many times and you're the man so i took

19:04.320 --> 19:10.880
advantage no no no problem all right do you want it to get back to mark yeah so the so how much

19:10.880 --> 19:19.120
county man i mean how many other things were tied up in that guy well there's never been a photo of

19:19.120 --> 19:27.040
him other than somebody in one of the the bubble cards um his name has never been released all we

19:27.040 --> 19:35.040
know he was a 35 year old male that was returning from Wuhan and he returned on i think it was

19:35.040 --> 19:45.440
that was the dates uh it was it was January 15th it was January 15th i think um and uh and

19:46.240 --> 19:50.880
yeah he returned on January the 15th the United States like just before there was some i think

19:50.880 --> 19:55.440
they started talking about some travel restrictions or something like that and

19:56.320 --> 20:03.600
uh he has no family in the United States no relatives no roommates we don't know where he

20:03.600 --> 20:12.480
works um uh he went to the hospital uh three days after he came back uh started to say he

20:12.480 --> 20:19.040
experienced symptoms uh of course there was a regional person that had some good cdc connection

20:19.040 --> 20:23.760
instead immediately identified oh no this might be related to that weird thing that's happening

20:23.840 --> 20:30.720
in china so he was checked into the hospital i think on the 18th there's a crazy story of as uh

20:30.720 --> 20:37.040
of a sample uh that was taken from him for the virus right uh which somehow wound up getting to

20:38.000 --> 20:47.520
uh either Bethesda or Atlanta for uh analysis uh by eight a.m. the following morning even though

20:47.520 --> 20:52.880
there were no direct flights um there's no way that a package could have gotten from that area to

20:52.880 --> 20:59.360
Atlanta not to mention if he had the most contagious virus that the world has ever seen

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
how did he fly from Wuhan to Seattle not get anyone sick there's no direct flights from Wuhan to

21:06.000 --> 21:10.320
Seattle which means he took at least one of the connecting flight and not one other person got

21:10.320 --> 21:16.240
sick and his whole time at the hospital no one got sick from him and then he just disappeared

21:16.240 --> 21:21.280
into the wilderness the snowmish county man i just remembered maybe it was the remdesivir they

21:21.360 --> 21:27.840
used on him well he just happened to have absolutely textbook textbook symptoms textbook description

21:27.840 --> 21:36.000
of what coronavirus was everything started to get worse exactly the perfect time uh and he was the

21:36.000 --> 21:44.160
first person that was approved to have compassionate use of uh remdesivir uh multiple names for

21:44.240 --> 21:50.080
involved in that i know cena bovari was one though and then he had an absolutely perfect 100

21:50.080 --> 21:57.520
recovery after taking remdesivir 100 perfect recovery um and that speaks a lot for the power

21:57.520 --> 22:05.200
of remdesivir yeah well uh this is this is this is serious job because i mean they should get they

22:05.200 --> 22:11.440
should get this guy and make an ad with him the serious part is the fact that they had one anecdotal

22:11.440 --> 22:19.840
data point right now one point was enough to start trials and that the trials if the trials

22:19.840 --> 22:25.840
weren't going well they would actually stop trials and say well these trials maybe this one over here

22:25.840 --> 22:31.120
isn't going so well but you know it worked with the the phantom snowmish county man

22:32.640 --> 22:38.720
and then and then just one thing led to the next uh and then a computer spat out remdesivir

22:38.720 --> 22:45.600
somehow with the defense reduction agency and lo and behold it became the only thing that had

22:45.600 --> 22:53.440
any evidence of uh of providing therapeutic value so uh i think that there is because we're in

22:53.440 --> 23:03.360
rumble we could speak a bit more freely i think it's a possibility that this guy either was a myth

23:03.440 --> 23:09.520
or and this is a far this is a far-flung conspiracy all right

23:12.080 --> 23:21.200
there was a 35 year old scientist in china doctor wane lee wane laying i i forget the fellow's name

23:21.760 --> 23:28.240
who was credited as being uh one of the greatest heroes since gondi because he blew the whistle on

23:28.560 --> 23:34.720
the risk of uh of coronavirus in china right and i guess he was arrested and imprisoned

23:35.760 --> 23:43.280
this 35 year old chinese guy that eventually died in the hospital was never seen after the time

23:43.280 --> 23:50.560
that the 35 year old snowmish county man appeared i suspect that they took this doctor who would

23:50.560 --> 23:57.600
have known how to describe a textbook case of coronavirus flew him to seattle and then he was

23:57.680 --> 24:05.280
in the bubble wrap and then when he was done alone he's off with a new identity i i i would bet

24:05.840 --> 24:08.160
i would bet a lot of money on that or he's dead

24:10.560 --> 24:16.800
and uh there was uh there was some legislators uh some congressmen or women i uh who in the

24:16.800 --> 24:22.080
united states who actually wanted to rename a street after that chinese scientist they held

24:22.080 --> 24:30.000
them in such high regard wow so so the snow homage county man's story is it is it's an exceptional

24:30.000 --> 24:38.240
story it's because it provided anecdotal evidence of medicine which wound up i think having lethal

24:38.240 --> 24:44.480
results for probably tens of thousands if not over a hundred thousand people just within the

24:44.480 --> 24:51.520
united states it sounds funny you can i i laugh when i tell it but it the consequences of this

24:51.520 --> 24:58.080
stuff has been incredibly serious not to mention if we are to believe that some of the

24:58.080 --> 25:04.800
additional therapy you know let's just say transfections or countermeasures being used

25:04.800 --> 25:11.600
are only being used because of the perceived risk of covid yeah that would also mean that

25:11.600 --> 25:17.520
all of those injuries and deaths are also ultimately the responsibility of whoever

25:17.520 --> 25:23.760
overhyped the risk of this thing so i'm always cautious about answering the question of was

25:23.760 --> 25:29.360
there a pandemic like well the best of my knowledge there really were a lot of excess deaths what was

25:29.360 --> 25:34.720
it because an RNA virus just spun around the world and then and then what add to add one thing to

25:34.720 --> 25:42.000
what jay said about this whole concept of virus mutation and i always joke about this one too

25:42.640 --> 25:49.360
you hear uh these phrases of the oh uh the on the cron now is the big thing or delta is going wild

25:49.360 --> 25:57.520
right and consider the fact that we're told that viruses always mutate they're mutating all the

25:57.520 --> 26:02.640
time every second they're mutating they're always going in different directions and they're always

26:02.640 --> 26:11.600
selecting based upon virulence and and lethality etc yet somehow at the snap of a finger

26:12.240 --> 26:18.480
all the viruses mutate to one specific thing overnight sort of like everyone waking up with red

26:18.480 --> 26:24.800
hair in the morning even though they didn't even have another generation these narratives john

26:24.800 --> 26:33.600
are so absurd and and hilarious uh it's i'm it is actually quite offensive that you don't i don't

26:33.600 --> 26:40.640
see more people even in the supposed truth community calling this stuff out but i uh i think uh i think

26:40.640 --> 26:45.280
jay should pick it up from here well that's what we're trying to do and we're trying to give some

26:45.280 --> 26:50.800
some uh you know i'm trying to do an hour show here which people can latch on to and say oh i get

26:50.800 --> 26:58.160
it now you know and so i want to get back to jay and a couple of points uh i don't want to

26:58.160 --> 27:08.000
to omit his point your point jay about the uh test i guess the pcr test is what we're talking

27:08.080 --> 27:17.280
about uh not being specific to any particular coronavirus and are you with me can you hear me

27:17.280 --> 27:22.080
i am here sorry i'm just focusing another camera because i'm anticipating you're gonna want me to

27:22.080 --> 27:28.880
draw it's okay go ahead okay well yeah maybe maybe that would help but where i'm going with this is

27:28.880 --> 27:37.440
is about the uh mark was talking about Snohomish county man on on january 16th 17th uh uh things

27:37.440 --> 27:45.200
happening then but that very weakened a doctor in germany named christian drosston

27:48.240 --> 27:57.680
announced that he had created a modification of the standard pcr test that would specifically find

27:57.680 --> 28:11.840
the uh covid 19 sars covid to coronavirus and based upon his recommendation suddenly everybody in

28:11.840 --> 28:18.640
the world was using the pcr test which is not supposed to be a test as i understand it but they

28:18.640 --> 28:25.760
were using that same um make that that way to determine whether somebody had or did not have

28:25.760 --> 28:34.080
this coronavirus that the snohomish county man had had and you know when jay first explained that

28:34.080 --> 28:42.000
no this this they couldn't tell one coronavirus from another i was like wow this is this is completely

28:42.000 --> 28:47.600
contradicting what this christian drosston said that he was able to magically come up with this

28:47.600 --> 28:54.880
modified pcr test over the weekend and it became the worldwide standard by which everybody is judged

28:54.960 --> 29:00.640
and of course from there we all if you remember and i think you guys remember a lot of people

29:00.640 --> 29:05.840
will remember that we started getting into the controversy of how many uh revolutions or how

29:05.840 --> 29:12.160
many times did they spin it through the pcr and if it's more than you know 25 or so then it's not

29:12.160 --> 29:18.480
really significant but they were spending it 35 times just to pump up the numbers and i mean

29:18.480 --> 29:24.080
that to me is also a big part of what jay can do is to is to expose that so

29:25.760 --> 29:31.120
have i got that about right jay yeah so i'm just was trying to see if i could pull something up

29:31.120 --> 29:39.680
that would help us talk about this so first of all um whoops um oh that's the wrong screen i want

29:39.760 --> 29:48.560
this one um this is the pcr test for the who um i'm not sure let me look at the bottom here if this

29:48.560 --> 29:54.240
is i think this is how they started but i'm not sure if this is where they are now where they

29:54.240 --> 30:01.840
started january 11th 20 no no this is 2020 so this is what they started with so if you take a look

30:01.840 --> 30:10.880
at this list here they are they are doing the rdrp or rdrp gene here which is the RNA dependent

30:10.880 --> 30:17.840
RNA polymerase and they have two primers here and then they have an RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene

30:17.840 --> 30:25.760
another um another pcr product of 100 base pairs with two primers and then they have the e-gene

30:26.320 --> 30:32.720
so what's interesting about this is that the e-gene of coronaviruses is shared across a lot of

30:32.720 --> 30:41.280
SARS viruses and in fact drastic um when it was still kind of an organization um covered a

30:42.560 --> 30:49.120
a blogger by the name of um and the blog is still up as far as i know it's called nerd has power

30:49.760 --> 30:55.200
and if you go to that blog you just google nerd has power you can find this blog where he describes

30:56.000 --> 31:05.840
the fact that the the RATG 13 sequence which was the closest known sequence to SARS-CoV-2 in the

31:05.840 --> 31:15.840
WIV catalog was made up and the reason why this person thought that RATG 13 was a made up virus

31:15.840 --> 31:24.080
and that therefore SARS-CoV-2 might be a made up virus was because all the viruses in a paper

31:24.080 --> 31:34.400
from 2000 I'm gonna get the year wrong but it was 2012 and RATG 13 sequence

31:36.720 --> 31:45.200
and SARS-CoV-2 all had the same roughly the same e-protein and actually the RATG 13 sequence

31:45.200 --> 31:52.240
and two other viruses published by WIV had the exact same e-protein now what they

31:53.120 --> 31:59.440
and other people that I think are reporting this incorrectly have said is that this is a sign that

31:59.440 --> 32:08.960
this is um this is a fake virus but what I think this is is more um an example of what I was talking

32:08.960 --> 32:16.480
about earlier which is when you find an ephemeral signal that has missing pieces one of the many

32:16.480 --> 32:24.000
missing pieces can be the e-protein gene and they know the coronavirus is require an e-protein for

32:24.000 --> 32:28.640
the assembly of the of the actual it's part of the kind of capsid thing it doesn't really have a

32:28.640 --> 32:36.640
capsid but it's part of the of the shell of the virus so if you imagine a scenario where in those

32:36.640 --> 32:41.520
earlier papers they found coronaviruses but they were incomplete genomes but then they said okay

32:41.520 --> 32:45.840
well we'll throw in this e-gene in both of them and then we'll grow them up as clones so we can

32:45.840 --> 32:53.120
study them and then they made up another one RATG 13 and they threw in an e-gene there

32:53.920 --> 33:01.840
and so what you're seeing evidence here of number not here directly but what you're you get the idea

33:01.840 --> 33:11.120
of what's going on here is that the e-gene is a very small protein reasonably conserved but not

33:11.200 --> 33:16.960
in a way that would be expected to be identical across coronaviruses so it's an interesting target

33:17.680 --> 33:21.600
because it shouldn't be specific and more importantly should change a little bit

33:21.600 --> 33:28.000
but the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene is a highly conserved I mean highly conserved

33:28.560 --> 33:36.320
and it's a big multi multi subunit protein and what that means is if they choose the most

33:36.320 --> 33:46.400
conserved part of that protein like for example the wheels of a car and you use the wheels of a

33:46.400 --> 33:52.640
car like steel belted radials as being the indicator of a car being present and then you said well

33:52.640 --> 34:00.000
this is a highly specific test for a Mercedes 320 convertible and what does it test for well

34:00.080 --> 34:05.520
test for steel belted tires you'd be like well that's not very specific every car has got those

34:06.160 --> 34:12.320
and with the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene it's very hard to be specific with that

34:12.960 --> 34:18.320
with that gene because that gene is present in every coronavirus and it is highly conserved

34:18.320 --> 34:25.040
because it is the gene that purports to do the copying so you can't make errors with that

34:25.040 --> 34:30.960
you can't make mistakes on that gene if you make mistakes copying that portion of the genome

34:31.520 --> 34:36.960
that copy of the genome is worthless so the idea that they're looking for this

34:38.080 --> 34:43.040
I used too much time again but the idea that they use this as the primary probe

34:43.840 --> 34:49.920
indicates that this is more like a pan coronavirus test than it is a test that would be specific

34:49.920 --> 34:58.000
for SARS-CoV-2 simply because SARS-CoV-2 is defined mostly by its structural protein

34:58.000 --> 35:02.880
and its spike protein so if you're not testing for that you would never know how you're

35:02.880 --> 35:06.880
differentiating from any of the other coronaviruses that were expected to be in the background

35:07.760 --> 35:13.200
and you weren't required to get all three you required to get two of three so there's no

35:13.200 --> 35:21.440
specificity here at all now compare that I just happen to have this here to what they did in

35:21.440 --> 35:30.800
2019 or 20 for us 23 for us now they're doing the end protein so if we move this one over here

35:32.400 --> 35:38.320
they're doing two primer sets here for the end protein and so now the specificity of

35:39.200 --> 35:44.800
tests that look for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase are very different than the specificity

35:44.800 --> 35:49.520
that looking for the end protein I don't know how they're better or worse but they have to be

35:49.520 --> 35:55.520
different because each of the proteins in the coronavirus genome is conserved to a different

35:55.520 --> 36:01.600
degree in other words if you were trying to detect the presence of a car one of the things

36:01.600 --> 36:06.400
that's highly conserved is they all have rubber tires one thing that's less highly conserved is

36:06.400 --> 36:11.760
that they all have leather seats one thing that's even less highly conserved is that they have

36:11.760 --> 36:21.440
leather dashes or or led lights or or gold gold uh plated things inside of it would be even more

36:21.440 --> 36:29.280
rare and so the question is with all of these coronaviruses tests are they really specific for

36:29.280 --> 36:35.440
a specific coronavirus and the answer before 2020 is that's impossible but the answer after

36:35.440 --> 36:42.960
2020 is of course they're extremely specific for just this one and there's no I just don't think

36:42.960 --> 36:48.800
that there's any evidence that they ever were extremely specific and maybe I'll just do this one

36:48.800 --> 36:54.800
thing mark and then I'll shut up because I know I'm taking a lot of time here but you were asking

36:54.800 --> 37:02.480
before about primers and there's something that about primers that a lot of um academic biologists

37:02.480 --> 37:08.000
assume but I want to clear up for all the academic biologists up there that this didn't happen

37:08.000 --> 37:14.640
okay so if you're looking for a sequence and that's the sequence and you design primers and those

37:14.640 --> 37:21.680
are the primers and then this would be filled in by the PCR or this would be filled in by the PCR

37:21.680 --> 37:28.720
and you would copy and amplify and you would find what you were looking for academic biologists

37:28.720 --> 37:37.840
don't do it like this if this was the sentence the quick brown I'm writing too fast

37:44.000 --> 37:49.520
there's my sentence the the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog you would use primers of the

37:50.240 --> 37:57.200
and dog to find the the sentence and that would be a reasonably reasonably

37:58.240 --> 38:05.840
specific set of primers but it would pick up every sentence in every book that started or had the

38:05.840 --> 38:12.400
somewhere in it and had dog after that and so that's a lot of sentences that aren't the quick brown

38:12.400 --> 38:18.160
fox jumps over the lazy dog and a book that you might read it might amplify more than this sentence

38:18.800 --> 38:25.840
so what is typically done in academic biology is that you do two rounds of PCR and so you have

38:25.840 --> 38:34.000
primers and then you have nested primers so nested primers in this reaction would be QUI

38:35.280 --> 38:44.320
and ONG so essentially you would run the first PCR reaction with the and dog and you would amplify

38:44.320 --> 38:50.640
all the sentences that have the and dog in it in that order some separated by more words or

38:50.640 --> 38:58.400
less words and then you would run a second PCR with the primer ONG for this part of the sentence

38:59.120 --> 39:06.800
and quick QUI for this part of the sentence and so now of the of the all of the little sentences

39:06.800 --> 39:12.160
that you amplified with the and dog you're now selecting only the sentences that have

39:12.800 --> 39:20.000
QUI at the beginning and ONG at the end in that order and now you've really made

39:20.000 --> 39:29.360
your two-step PCR test extremely specific but in Canada and in America and in most places in

39:29.360 --> 39:36.240
the world they weren't using nested primers but anytime anybody does PCR in a university

39:36.240 --> 39:40.880
because they're writing a nature paper and they're going to get tenure they're always using nested

39:40.880 --> 39:48.800
PCR so they all assume that these COVID tests must be nested they would not use nested primers

39:48.800 --> 39:54.240
and there's no specificity at all and that's exactly what they did they did not use nested

39:54.240 --> 40:01.600
primers and in Canada they didn't use that for the entire pandemic so just two primers that's it

40:01.600 --> 40:06.880
and so any sentence that has this word in the beginning or this word near the end will be amplified

40:07.360 --> 40:13.120
regardless of its length and so that's the problem I don't know if that was a very good

40:13.120 --> 40:23.600
illustration but I hope it was a good explanation am I still on talk to me goose you're in the

40:23.600 --> 40:29.200
show and I don't hear anybody else what happened well I came down so we could see a graphic okay

40:29.200 --> 40:34.000
sorry I thought you guys went away yeah we're on work still here and mark still here but just

40:34.000 --> 40:41.200
building on what Jay said is if you were to start testing for something in your environment

40:41.200 --> 40:46.960
or told to test for something in your environment that you never tested before

40:47.600 --> 40:53.680
four before and if you believed or were told to believe that you're testing for something which

40:53.680 --> 41:01.280
never existed before right even though it may have you could be led to believe that something new

41:02.080 --> 41:09.520
has just emerged and is now spreading that's the simplest way of saying it so what's important

41:09.520 --> 41:16.480
here is a whole lot of these things these detection tests were used and they really did

41:17.280 --> 41:23.760
glow all kinds of colors or not and there really was a lot of data collected and that data just

41:23.840 --> 41:31.040
can't be said that it didn't happen it did but doesn't mean what they want you and I

41:31.840 --> 41:36.880
to think it means right and if they were just taking something which would have tested positive

41:36.880 --> 41:43.200
maybe ten years ago anyways but didn't tell you but you didn't have the test till now and they said

41:43.200 --> 41:51.120
this is new it looks like something new and novel is spreading like wildfire and they took advantage

41:51.120 --> 41:57.600
of our faith that there could never have been something a trick like this pulled on us at the

41:57.600 --> 42:06.560
scale I fell for it a lot of us did and the consequences were real they were but then I just

42:06.560 --> 42:12.320
don't believe the official narrative at all of of what was spreading and hopefully that simplifies

42:12.320 --> 42:18.800
what Jay said in a more more technically elaborate and accurate way what I want to do is just

42:18.800 --> 42:26.080
summarize it and say that what what we have summarized here tonight so far is evidence of a

42:26.080 --> 42:34.640
very very clear conspiracy this this is a conspiracy there's no other way that they could have gotten

42:34.640 --> 42:40.800
those reports all around the world you know within so many hours I mean have you seen anybody

42:40.800 --> 42:47.600
seen those list of the times you know of the day when the first case was reported you know in

42:47.600 --> 42:53.200
first case in San Francisco first case in Melbourne first case in South Africa first you know and

42:53.200 --> 43:02.640
it's like they're an hour apart and and this is this is Jay Jay's theory or hypothesis is that

43:02.640 --> 43:15.360
that is evidence of a conspiracy to create a pandemic a fear of a pandemic but the fact is that they

43:15.360 --> 43:24.800
were limited by the ephemeral nature of the infectious clones they were using but they did

43:24.800 --> 43:30.640
have infectious clones and people did get sick and so that's you know we've got positive yeah

43:30.640 --> 43:41.040
people did get sick and and now we have well I guess the next step in in exposing or the

43:41.120 --> 43:47.360
exposition of what what what we're trying to do tonight would be to talk to Mark about Remdesivir

43:48.160 --> 43:57.280
because in order for us to be you know first of all they had Snohomish County man as the example

43:57.280 --> 44:07.600
of hey take Remdesivir you'll be fine in three days but then the deception that there is this

44:07.600 --> 44:16.240
pandemic everywhere coupled with oh we've got to use Remdesivir Mark why did they do that

44:19.120 --> 44:26.000
well why did they are why did did they say they did it they say they did it because there's this

44:26.560 --> 44:35.520
deadly novel virus spreading like wildfire and which because it's novel after all we've never

44:35.520 --> 44:39.280
used these tests before we're testing for something that we've never tested before

44:39.280 --> 44:48.960
tested for before it's novel so because it's so novel and unique you and I cannot possibly

44:48.960 --> 44:55.520
understand how to defend ourselves our bodies would never understand this thing because it's so

44:55.520 --> 45:03.760
unique therefore the only logical way to save lives would be to have a a powerful and new

45:04.640 --> 45:14.640
therapeutic to help people recover and that there was some evidence limited evidence

45:14.640 --> 45:23.920
that Remdesivir had some therapeutic value now the bar was set extremely low arguably to the point

45:23.920 --> 45:32.560
where it didn't have any however it the very fact that they did test it and at least it was some

45:32.560 --> 45:41.360
warp data to suggest that it had ffk just bent or benefits they were able to push it

45:44.960 --> 45:48.720
the the thing with Remdesivir I mean Remdesivir it's a very complicated compound

45:49.920 --> 45:52.400
it's been described so I think it takes a long time to manufacture

45:53.920 --> 46:01.680
there's a possibility probably a strong possibility that it does have a beneficial activity

46:02.640 --> 46:08.000
for people who have been possibly exposed at that moment to something like an infectious

46:08.000 --> 46:14.560
clone like the day of and I mean these things were developed for warfighters for people in the

46:14.560 --> 46:20.000
battlefield that are being potentially hit with synthetic biological agents so that their bodies

46:20.000 --> 46:26.080
perhaps can you know it's still bad but it's it's as opposed to having to deal with the full

46:26.080 --> 46:31.200
load of a synthetic biological agent Remdesivir might give you a chance to survive it

46:32.160 --> 46:38.800
now Remdesivir was not designed for someone who's been sick for a week and a half to get better

46:39.600 --> 46:47.680
in fact in the cases where Remdesivir was for many people prescribed and used as part of these

46:47.680 --> 46:55.760
hospital protocols it had detrimental effects and caused the body to be further straight further

46:55.840 --> 47:03.760
stressed and in many cases led to a situation where the patients felt weaker some of them

47:03.760 --> 47:10.320
allowed themselves to be intubated additional medicine was given and oftentimes the results

47:10.880 --> 47:19.600
were lethal now the question is is was the this belief that we can't look at any of these other

47:20.320 --> 47:27.440
this whole world of medicine a lot of it's not good but even you can't look at any of it

47:27.440 --> 47:33.760
aside from Remdesivir and then ivermectin and one other thing maybe you can't look at any of it

47:33.760 --> 47:38.560
just have to look at these these two or three things this is the whole toolbox right now

47:38.560 --> 47:45.360
everything else can't even consider antibiotics because this is a novel virus they said so

47:46.240 --> 47:55.840
um this means that there were potentially many people that succumbed to that lost their life

47:55.840 --> 48:03.120
because they were treated based upon a health protocol that was designed specifically for people

48:03.120 --> 48:10.960
who have tested positive for a novel virus whereas if you go to the hospital traditionally if you

48:11.040 --> 48:18.800
have a fever or if you have a broken arm or something they they treat the symptoms right um uh they

48:18.800 --> 48:25.680
don't they don't test you know to see exactly specifically how the proteins are designed on the

48:25.680 --> 48:30.400
thing that's making you sick if you got a fever you know there's certain ways to treat it you know

48:30.400 --> 48:38.720
if you have pain or whatever and it's not super super super specific to the pathogen that was

48:38.720 --> 48:43.520
people were encouraged to abandon that thinking with coronavirus and now think that

48:44.160 --> 48:50.160
based upon the very specific description of the invading pathogen you need to have a very very

48:50.160 --> 48:57.600
specific course of action taken taken to that and those are we just refer to them simply as

48:57.600 --> 49:04.640
protocols but they're really the the hospital protocol specific to people who were tested positive

49:04.640 --> 49:10.960
or who are identified symptomatically to have the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19

49:10.960 --> 49:18.800
disease associated with it so again um how many of the additional excess deaths which really did

49:18.800 --> 49:25.680
happen uh could have been avoided if we simply treated people based upon their symptoms

49:26.640 --> 49:32.480
here's another thing john look at it this way how many people have you heard of we're just walking

49:32.480 --> 49:37.680
down the street who are mowing their lawn and just suddenly croaked and died of COVID

49:40.160 --> 49:47.360
um i would say zero zero yeah you know i'm like stroke heart attack i'm not trying to be funny

49:47.360 --> 49:52.320
about it no but i'm looking for that if you want to have a pandemic i'm looking for some bodies

49:52.320 --> 49:58.240
that down out in the street yeah that to me there's there's no one who was at the cafeteria based

49:58.240 --> 50:06.720
down in the soup yeah everyone was dying in a hospital this is very different than other

50:07.520 --> 50:15.200
diseases or or sudden health you know tragedies which is a big clue if many of these excess

50:15.200 --> 50:21.920
deaths were in hospitals well and if they didn't happen outside of the hospital right i think

50:21.920 --> 50:27.040
it's legitimately it's legitimate the question just how much of this pandemic was driven by

50:27.280 --> 50:33.360
protocols by erroneous interpretation of tests by medicines which were approved that shouldn't

50:33.360 --> 50:39.840
have been based upon bad data used when they shouldn't have been taking away a doctor's ability to

50:41.360 --> 50:45.520
you know exercise their own discretion and this is all even before

50:47.840 --> 50:54.400
you know people you know suicide rates were up because of isolation um drug overdoses were up

50:55.360 --> 51:04.800
the and now you have the impacts of of the the newer generation of jabby jabs associated with this

51:05.920 --> 51:13.600
so um revisiting the past a little bit what led to the escalation of fear who participated in that

51:14.160 --> 51:18.560
and how are the tools used misrepresented misinterpreted

51:19.360 --> 51:28.560
um is is important i believe anyways uh for uh for hopefully not having this happen again

51:29.200 --> 51:37.360
um i suspect that uh there's a possibility something like what just happened could happen again i

51:37.360 --> 51:45.360
think because of the contributions of j and um you know a small army of other people i think the

51:45.360 --> 51:56.880
odds of that are going lower every day um i'm proud to say but uh it's anyways that i i yield

51:56.880 --> 52:05.040
for the moment it's important to um round that off with uh with a mention that in the uk how they

52:05.040 --> 52:10.800
did it was with medazalam um there were lots of old people in the uk that were given medazalam

52:10.800 --> 52:17.440
way over the normal dose and basically killed with it um remdesivir played that role here a

52:17.440 --> 52:24.480
lot of people have in my mind seemed to fail to draw the the parallel between azt and remdesivir

52:24.480 --> 52:31.280
but i do think that there's something there um in the sense of trying to force a chemotherapy drug

52:31.280 --> 52:35.680
onto people with AIDS and it probably made most of them much sicker than they would have been if

52:35.760 --> 52:40.960
they hadn't been put on a chemotherapy drug and all of those symptoms were blamed on AIDS

52:41.920 --> 52:45.920
and that's not any different than when they gave remdesivir to people in the hospital and they had

52:45.920 --> 52:50.160
kidney failure and liquid filling up in their lungs and they blamed that on covid when they

52:50.160 --> 52:56.080
knew that that was a side effect of being on remdesivir for longer than five days so the other

52:56.080 --> 53:02.480
thing that i'd like to mention is that we've been mark and i have been kind of playing tennis with

53:02.560 --> 53:09.040
old um videos from people that we've streamed with or listened to or think are are important

53:09.040 --> 53:14.800
we've been going back to see what they were saying as early as we can and one of the surprising

53:14.800 --> 53:20.640
things that we found Robert Malone saying in 2021 was that dexamethasone is something that

53:20.640 --> 53:26.720
you can give to covid patients and really rev it up um and so you have to kind of add that to a list

53:27.440 --> 53:34.480
of substances that was being used and so is it something that could exacerbate things and was

53:34.480 --> 53:39.520
it part of the protocol and helping to exacerbate things um all of these things need to be

53:40.720 --> 53:47.280
need to be added together in an equation much more like one would solve a crime rather than

53:47.280 --> 53:53.760
trying to you know i use this analogy the other day when you call 911 you don't have to already

53:53.840 --> 53:58.720
know what the motivation of the person who's breaking into your house is and whether or not he's

53:59.440 --> 54:03.680
he's motivated by money or whether he's a drug dealer or whatever you don't need to know all

54:03.680 --> 54:07.600
that all you need to know is somebody's breaking your house and if we're saying that a bunch of

54:07.600 --> 54:14.480
people are lying about this virus in order to usurp our rights and change the way that they

54:14.480 --> 54:19.440
they govern us forever and i don't know if we need to know all the details of how they done it and

54:19.440 --> 54:22.880
in fact they could have done it differently in different places and they would be smart to have

54:22.880 --> 54:31.840
done it that way. I think you know what i've been trying to do tonight is to give a

54:31.840 --> 54:40.800
a background for people that are fairly new to this that can see fairly easily through a lot of the

54:41.360 --> 54:48.160
BS that we've been fed and to start with Snohomish County man to to look at the infectious clones

54:48.160 --> 54:56.160
and to recognize what what Jay's been emphasizing tonight about how these RNA viruses are by nature

54:56.160 --> 55:01.680
if emerald that they they can't travel around the world in exactly the same form they can't even

55:01.680 --> 55:07.520
cross the room in exactly the same form and that's the way it is that's biology.

55:07.680 --> 55:20.560
Now we have a tremendous collateral damage from either the disease or the the jabbie jabs as Mark

55:20.560 --> 55:27.360
calls them and i think it's more has to do with the jabbie jabs and we we notice the cancer statistics

55:27.360 --> 55:34.160
are going very very bad they're looking really bad especially with young people. You guys know

55:34.160 --> 55:42.480
i have cancer and what happened to me i never took any of the jabs i never took any uh i

55:42.480 --> 55:48.640
i my wife never took any of the jabs we lived to just the two of us so neither one of us had

55:48.640 --> 55:56.960
anything like the covid that some of our neighbors had but she visited some neighbors and some

55:56.960 --> 56:04.720
relatives in california in february and came back uh and uh said oh they all had uh covid and

56:05.840 --> 56:11.760
she started feeling like she had a two and then she she did she got sick and then i got sick

56:11.760 --> 56:17.360
with the very same thing and uh it was more than a flu it was this was not you know this was not

56:17.440 --> 56:26.800
your average you know uh 20 years ago flu uh it did have that lingering time you know three

56:26.800 --> 56:32.480
four weeks where you just don't feel like you can do anything um but the other reasons that i think

56:32.480 --> 56:41.920
it really probably was generated either from the original covid or whatever variant it's at by now

56:41.920 --> 56:48.000
but i think more likely that it's somebody that that she was traveling with that had got it

56:48.000 --> 56:55.360
not not necessarily from the original uh infectious clone but and and the way that i would put it is

56:55.360 --> 57:02.480
is is it possible that in the jabs they've got stuff that gives you the same thing that snow

57:02.480 --> 57:09.600
hamish county man came down with you know back in 2019 that it that it gives you that that illness

57:09.680 --> 57:13.520
as a kind of in other words is there an infectious clone in the jab

57:15.600 --> 57:26.000
oh well i mean if you want that that's uh i mean the jab is is RNA the the jab is the RNA in the

57:26.000 --> 57:32.560
best case scenario it's supposed to code for a viral protein so it is it is one of 31 proteins

57:32.560 --> 57:38.480
it's not as bad as an infectious clone of the RNA would be in theory but on the other hand

57:38.560 --> 57:45.440
you're not injecting that infectious clone you would inhale it in theory um again i want to emphasize

57:45.440 --> 57:50.880
that the infectious clone for people who are just following mark and i for the first time and just

57:50.880 --> 57:56.800
meeting me for the first time the infectious clone is a methodology by which something which is very

57:56.800 --> 58:05.120
intractable in nature and in the laboratory can be converted to a pure and quantity that can be

58:05.200 --> 58:11.760
studied and shared with people um it's it's often the way we do it with biology in the laboratory

58:11.760 --> 58:17.280
another great example is that all of the laboratory work i keep referring like this because the

58:17.280 --> 58:23.200
University of Pittsburgh is over there um all of the laboratory work that's done in in monkeys

58:23.200 --> 58:32.080
i'm sorry mice is done in inbred mice mice that have been bred to themselves brother to sister

58:32.080 --> 58:39.040
brother to sister brother to sister until they are so genetically identical that they can be

58:39.040 --> 58:47.680
studied as one animal model because if you use outbred wild mice some of them will be smart

58:47.680 --> 58:52.880
some of them will be dumb some of them will get sick some of them won't some of them will respond

58:52.880 --> 58:57.280
well some of them won't some of them will be susceptible to your drugs some of them won't

58:57.280 --> 59:06.400
but if you have a very genetically pure inbred mouse strain all of the animals reactions to

59:06.400 --> 59:14.400
different drugs or different treatments will be much more similar and we do this in science as

59:14.400 --> 59:21.120
part of this reductionist manner of probing the universe but that reductionist manner of probing

59:21.120 --> 59:30.000
the universe has become so reduced that it no longer adequately recapitulates the complexity

59:30.000 --> 59:37.840
we're trying to understand and in this scenario um with these RNA viruses there's a tremendous

59:37.840 --> 59:44.000
complexity out there in the wild that at our best when we try to get a hold of it in the laboratory

59:44.800 --> 59:50.720
we make a DNA version of it we make it very pure and then we start with that even though

59:50.720 --> 59:57.280
we know that that does not exist out there at all and we use this to scare everybody that this is

59:57.280 --> 01:00:03.360
the pandemic potential but it really is this is how they could do it they could get this sequence

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:09.600
in every person in the world if they made enough of it and then sold the right water bottles to

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:15.440
everybody everybody drinking and everybody would be PCR positive if they just like if they wanted

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.120
to paint everybody blue all they need to do is make enough blue paint you wouldn't that's all they

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:27.840
need to do and if you say that oh wait somebody spilled blue paint out in my backyard and before

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.440
you know it all the houses in the world are going to be blue everybody be like well how the hell's

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.640
that good that's stupid that's not how paint works but that's what they're saying with RNA

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.040
they're saying that somebody spilled some RNA out there and now the whole world's going to have it

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.360
and that's just not possible

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.680
I hope I can get you guys back I want to talk more about the jabs themselves and you know again to

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.720
get back to the collateral damage that they they cause as well as Sarem Desivir and

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:06.480
Marcus has been working with victims and with the survivors and and people that have you know

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:14.240
and he himself and his family touched by this crazy so-called medical system and the disasters

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:23.520
that that have followed since 2019 they just keep compounding upon one another I guess for

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.320
tonight I'm really grateful for you both to share this time with me and to try to but I want what

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:38.480
I'm really trying to do guys is to try to get your message out better and and I want you to feel

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:46.560
successful that's great that that you guys are starting to feel like you're maybe maybe can stop

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:53.600
them from doing the next time and you know we never know the effect of what we do we send it

01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:00.160
out into the universe and maybe this show maybe another show another day will be the trick that

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:08.480
people say oh you know what this really was a a big conspiracy and now we're going to take names

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.880
and kick some butt and and get past it because we got we got to get past it got to get back to

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:22.880
being good a good good old USA you know the country that we all were taught to love as children we

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.160
should be that country and you guys are helping me and helping everybody else to get back on track

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:35.440
thank you very much for tonight thank you Jay thank you Mark thank you guys like to add

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.680
all I'll say is I think that country is still alive and well and I think that future is still

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:49.280
there it's alive in here and I wouldn't judge someone's patriotism by the size of the flag behind

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:56.880
them trust me I think I think you both of you are I consider to be look mine mine is very small and

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:03.200
understated you know it's just enough you know it doesn't need to whack you over the head and

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.800
suffocate you you know is but anyways I'm and you know what even if everything was perfect

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.920
everything was perfect we would still have to live this way in order to keep it that way so

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.640
I view it as a as art our challenge and our responsibility one way or the other and thank you

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.680
