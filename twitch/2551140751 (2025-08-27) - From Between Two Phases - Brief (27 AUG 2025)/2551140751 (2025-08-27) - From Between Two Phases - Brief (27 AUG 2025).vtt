00:42.281 --> 00:46.423
The response to the COVID crisis caused unparalleled collateral damage.

00:47.503 --> 00:48.124
Isolation.

00:48.764 --> 00:59.729
Families and whistleblowing carers have told us about residents being isolated in their rooms for days and weeks on end, with absolutely minimal contact with other humans.

01:00.595 --> 01:04.780
By isolating care home residents from family, a vital layer of care stopped.

01:05.361 --> 01:12.349
Family members would no longer be able to help with day-to-day visits and tasks, including personal care and mealtimes.

01:13.129 --> 01:17.675
Natural safeguarding checks that comes with regular family visits also ceased.

01:18.706 --> 01:19.827
No GP visits.

01:20.608 --> 01:31.859
Our families and whistleblowers evidence that the majority of care homes did not have any GP visits for extended periods of time during the pandemic, in some cases up to several years.

01:32.740 --> 01:35.782
Neglect, malnutrition and dehydration.

01:36.818 --> 01:40.579
residents denied food, water, care and basic hygiene.

01:41.460 --> 01:50.163
Untreated urinary tract infections, pressure sores and skin ulcers, all prevalent during lockdown and all a breach of the Human Rights Act.

01:51.303 --> 01:53.884
No access to medication or medical care.

01:54.704 --> 02:05.008
Access to medication and medical care was limited due to no in-person GP visits and also DNA do not admit to hospital.

02:05.919 --> 02:19.605
This very discriminatory policy encouraged that residents with dementia and other cognitive impairments be restricted access to emergency and in-hospital care, often with devastating or deadly effect.

02:20.685 --> 02:26.288
The NHS frailty score can stack the odds against you if you're older or showing signs of frailty.

02:27.102 --> 02:33.464
If implemented strictly as an assessment tool, it can mean that you are faced with a fight for simple medical treatment.

02:34.205 --> 02:47.769
People over age 70 with a comorbidity or disability would not only be denied medical care, they would often be placed on end-of-life medication if they presented with COVID symptoms.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.831
DNR and DNA CPR

02:53.356 --> 03:03.900
During the pandemic, extensive testimonies from families and whistleblowers evidenced that inappropriate and at times unlawful use of end-of-life protocols in care homes and hospitals.

03:04.740 --> 03:13.544
These accounts align with reports from other campaign groups and have been corroborated by relatives and care staff at the Scottish Covid Inquiry.

03:15.064 --> 03:15.404
NG165.

03:17.825 --> 03:21.567
Denial of antibiotics and the initiation of end-of-life pathways.

03:22.369 --> 03:32.883
This suggests that some care home residents presenting with respiratory symptoms in early 2020 should have been treated with antibiotics for their illness, as was standard practice.

03:33.783 --> 03:41.732
However, during lockdown, long-standing best practice in the treatment of respiratory illness was largely abandoned.

03:43.894 --> 03:52.503
NICE guideline NG165 advised against the use of antibiotics where COVID was suspected.

03:53.584 --> 04:04.869
However, with GPs carrying out remote diagnosis, how were they able to tell the difference between COVID and a case of bacterial pneumonia or a chest infection?

04:05.249 --> 04:06.410
They couldn't.

04:07.290 --> 04:17.354
Yet countless numbers of patients were denied basic yet life-saving treatments such as antibiotics and steroids through this practice.

04:17.394 --> 04:21.456
How many people died needlessly from untreated bacterial pneumonia?

04:22.449 --> 04:26.397
only to be recorded as another false Covid death.

04:27.499 --> 04:29.242
Another mechanism used to check this.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.389
How many people died needlessly of a chest infection?

04:34.351 --> 04:34.872
They couldn't.

04:35.796 --> 04:44.223
Yet countless numbers of patients were denied basic, yet life-saving, treatments such as antibiotics and steroids through this.

04:44.763 --> 04:52.289
How were they able to tell the difference between COVID and a case of bacterial pneumonia or a chest infection?

04:52.570 --> 05:01.257
NICE guideline NG165 advised against the use of antibiotics where COVID was suspected.

05:02.278 --> 05:02.638
However,

05:03.134 --> 05:13.579
with GPs carrying out remote diagnosis, how were they able to tell the difference between COVID and a case of bacterial pneumonia or a chest infection?

05:14.479 --> 05:15.059
They couldn't.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.062
Longstanding best practice in the treatment of respiratory illness was largely abandoned.

05:21.942 --> 05:31.827
NICE guideline NG165 advised against the use of antibiotics where COVID was suspected

05:32.912 --> 05:44.196
However, with GPs carrying out remote diagnosis, how were they able to tell the difference between COVID and a case of bacterial pneumonia or a chest infection?

05:45.156 --> 05:45.736
They couldn't.

05:46.616 --> 05:55.459
Yet countless numbers of patients were denied basic yet life-saving treatments such as antibiotics and steroids through this practice.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.781
How many people died needlessly from untreated bacterial pneumonia?

06:01.787 --> 06:05.711
only to be recorded as another false Covid death.

06:06.832 --> 06:16.140
Another mechanism used to justify sealings of care and the initiation of end-of-life pathways was the unlawful use of Do Not Attempt resuscitation orders.

06:17.101 --> 06:25.949
It is now very well known that across many, if not all, care settings, these were placed on residents' medical notes in a blanket fashion.

06:27.347 --> 06:35.153
often without discussion with families or with families put under considerable pressure to agree to the DNAR order.

06:36.534 --> 06:45.481
Those who suffered from cognitive conditions or impairment were particularly at risk, regardless of their age and wider health.

06:47.603 --> 06:54.829
A Freedom of Information request confirmed that 90% of COVID deaths had had a DNAR order in place.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.821
Did the patient consent?

06:57.381 --> 06:58.663
Were the families consulted?

07:00.064 --> 07:03.587
The DNAR order meant much more than withdrawal of resuscitation.

07:04.548 --> 07:14.036
It also triggered, along with the NHS Frailty Score Index, a high-level triage system of denied medical care for any condition.

07:14.816 --> 07:14.936
NG163.

07:17.984 --> 07:32.074
NICE guideline NG163 was issued on the 3rd of April 2020 and provided recommendations for managing symptoms including end-of-life care for COVID-19 patients.

07:33.015 --> 07:41.721
This guidance had a significant impact on the prescribing of end-of-life medications, midazolam and morphine together.

07:43.242 --> 07:47.685
One of my own graphs here even making its way into the UK COVID inquiry.

07:49.179 --> 07:58.482
NG163 advised midazolam to manage agitation or distress in patients suspected of having COVID.

07:59.382 --> 08:04.743
A dose of 2.5 to 5 milligrams every two to four hours as required.

08:05.283 --> 08:07.124
A huge volume of midazolam.

08:08.044 --> 08:13.546
Morphine was recommended for managing severe pain and breathlessness in COVID-19 patients.

08:15.462 --> 08:25.746
NG163 also emphasised that sedation and opioid use should not be withheld due to fear of causing respiratory depression.

08:27.947 --> 08:40.011
It is important to note that prior to the Covid era and breathlessness and Covid-19 5mg every 3 medications, midazolam and morphine together

08:41.573 --> 08:45.937
One of my own graphs here, even making its way into the UK COVID inquiry.

08:47.418 --> 08:56.745
NG163 advised midazolam to manage agitation or distress in patients suspected of having COVID.

08:57.626 --> 09:02.990
A dose of 2.5 to 5 milligrams every two to four hours as required.

09:03.530 --> 09:05.312
A huge volume of midazolam.

09:06.249 --> 09:12.435
Morphine was recommended for managing severe pain and breathlessness in Covid-19 patients.

09:14.096 --> 09:23.986
NG163 also emphasised that sedation and opioid use should not be withheld due to fear of causing respiratory depression.

09:24.006 --> 09:27.209
It is important to note

09:27.677 --> 09:36.165
that prior to the Covid era, the combination of midazolam and morphine was not usually authorised for use together for respiratory illnesses.

09:36.945 --> 09:43.632
Midazolam is a benzodiazepine used for sedation, while morphine is an opioid used mainly for pain relief.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.133
When used together

09:45.543 --> 09:53.006
they can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression, which can be dangerous and lead to death.

09:54.346 --> 10:07.770
Their combined use is therefore considered off-label for respiratory illness and instead used for sedation, while morphine is not usually authorised for use together for respiratory illnesses.

10:08.571 --> 10:15.173
Midazolam is a benzodiazepine used for sedation, while morphine is an opioid used mainly for pain relief.

10:15.916 --> 10:24.641
When used together, they can cause significant sedation and respiratory depression, which can be dangerous and lead to death.

10:25.941 --> 10:30.624
Their combined use is, therefore, considered off-label for respiratory illness.

10:31.264 --> 10:42.670
And instead, they are used in palliative care settings to manage symptoms at the end of life, not given as a treatment for someone who is hoped will recover from illness.

10:44.175 --> 10:56.510
The fact that NG163 recommended those drugs together for the treatment of COVID, particularly alongside the midazolam dosage used, raises very serious concerns.

10:57.791 --> 11:02.117
Medical professionals raised these concerns about the use and abuse of NG163 very early on.

11:04.540 --> 11:15.366
including a high-profile letter to the British Medical Journal in May 2020 by 11 eminent doctors including specialist palliative care consultants.

11:17.066 --> 11:26.776
NG163 introduced in April 2020 would be replaced by the much diluted NG191 in March 2021.

11:27.857 --> 11:36.066
In less than one year of NG163 being in place, UK care homes suffered 50,000 excess deaths.

11:37.867 --> 11:40.190
The majority of which during the first lockdown

11:40.896 --> 11:50.018
where excess death levels through April 2020 exceeded 100%, a literal doubling of deaths.

11:51.558 --> 12:07.682
For those that claim those deaths were caused by COVID, a question I ask is why were there no excess deaths before lockdown, where in fact care homes had negative excess deaths in January, February and early March 2020,

12:10.182 --> 12:19.525
We then had the immediate spike in excess that accompanied the lockdown and introduction of end-of-life protocol NG163.

12:20.625 --> 12:33.229
Then again, after the lockdown ended and family were allowed to visit relatives in care once again, the death levels in care homes once again went back to lower than average levels for the rest of 2020.

12:34.992 --> 12:46.156
only jumping back into excess after the Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out with care homes amongst priority 1 targets by the JCVI.

12:49.558 --> 12:54.940
NG191 removed all reference to giving midazolam and morphine together.

12:55.820 --> 12:59.842
NG163 was wiped from the NICE archives.

13:00.962 --> 13:01.222
Why?

13:02.663 --> 13:03.623
What do they have to hide?

13:05.073 --> 13:10.478
is at 50,000 avoidable deaths caused by their treatment protocols.

13:11.578 --> 13:12.699
Thanks for listening, guys.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.341
See you later.

13:14.841 --> 13:22.267
The doctor said we don't take Covid positive residents to hospital, order the end of life pack.

13:23.188 --> 13:24.669
We've picked up the antibiotics.

13:24.729 --> 13:25.730
I need the oxygen.

13:25.750 --> 13:30.693
I need it ASAP because our oxygen levels are dropping down.

13:30.713 --> 13:33.836
And she prescribed end of life drugs.

13:36.095 --> 13:38.877
And we never, ever got the oxygen, ever.

13:39.477 --> 13:41.699
We had all had DNRs in place.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.322
And was there, to your knowledge, any consultation with the patient or their families?

13:47.402 --> 13:47.583
No.

13:48.063 --> 14:00.831
We found that ambulance drivers and paramedics were not happy to transport any patients to hospital if that needs, like when that lady fell, unless there was a DNR in place.

14:00.851 --> 14:03.333
And I'd never come across that before.

14:53.194 --> 14:56.435
Good morning, good afternoon everyone.

14:56.516 --> 14:58.196
This is GigaOM Biological.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.238
Two recommended substacks there on the screen.

15:03.519 --> 15:04.979
Pretty heavy video.

15:05.440 --> 15:10.522
I hope you don't think that I was making fun or making light of it by putting in the sound effects.

15:10.562 --> 15:12.443
That's why I went back a couple times and

15:13.346 --> 15:14.386
replayed it without.

15:14.446 --> 15:22.308
It's just shocking, really, if you think about it, because we've been saying it for a long time here on this broadcast.

15:23.129 --> 15:29.490
I just like to make you aware that the 31st of August 2025 is International Overdose Awareness Day.

15:31.331 --> 15:35.732
I'm going to put in the chat a little link here where you can download some

15:36.900 --> 15:42.464
social media stuff and, you know, stuff you might want to print out or whatever.

15:43.504 --> 16:05.739
And I want you to be aware of it, because I do think that one of the sources of this murder and lies here, besides the pneumonia, besides what you heard in that testimony from Scotland, all the different ways that old people and people that were expected to contribute to an all cause mortality rise.

16:07.745 --> 16:17.470
could have been prematurely let go and roped into this narrative of COVID that in other countries was used against them.

16:17.770 --> 16:18.790
Look at America.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.832
Look at the failing numbers in America.

16:22.472 --> 16:25.714
And that's what justified the lockdown in Australia and New Zealand.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.915
That's what justified the

16:27.555 --> 16:33.078
the interpretation that they weren't experiencing the first wave that we had because they locked down.

16:33.558 --> 16:47.824
That whole narrative would have only been possible with this complicated, sophisticated murder and lies that included in America an opioid epidemic that was allowed to go out of control starting in really 2019.

16:49.705 --> 17:09.877
but also if you were listening carefully you could hear in that Scottish inquiry that there was actually a decrease in all-cause mortality right before the pandemic and I think we can see that potentially in a lot of places in America as well where you know from let's say November 2020 or sorry November 2019 until January February of 2020

17:16.401 --> 17:27.746
they were doing pretty good with all the people in old folks homes and all the people in the hospitals, making sure that there was no, you know, they did the best things they could.

17:27.786 --> 17:31.528
And then they announced the pandemic and then that treatment changed.

17:31.608 --> 17:40.712
And so suddenly we had this rise, just like in Scotland, that's not possible because an RNA has a fear and cleavage site.

17:40.752 --> 17:41.753
And then therefore,

17:42.353 --> 17:45.981
Unlike typical RNAs, this one starts to transmit at light speed.

17:46.382 --> 17:50.932
That's not an explanation that is founded in reality.

17:52.594 --> 18:04.381
An explanation that is founded in reality is that synchronously across Western nations, a protocol set, very diverse one, was released.

18:05.342 --> 18:21.872
And that protocol set, combined with the fact that all the old doctors were sent home because it's not safe for you to work here anymore, and these residents were told what to do, especially in America, by their administrators, or even by an email or on a Zoom call,

18:23.058 --> 18:40.338
And the most enticing thing in the American system was that if you classified someone as COVID in 2020, 21, maybe even into 2022, be nice if somebody else was working on this besides Mark and I, but at some point in time, there was this blanket.

18:41.189 --> 18:48.798
You know, if it's COVID, you try whatever you want, follow the protocol, but man, oh man, you have no liability at all as long as it's COVID.

18:48.818 --> 18:51.882
I mean, it's tough because it might be a bioweapon, right?

18:51.902 --> 18:53.464
That's the whispers in the background.

18:53.944 --> 18:58.990
So these doctors had financial incentives, legal incentives.

18:59.691 --> 19:16.511
authoritarian sort of hierarchical reasons to find everything COVID and then if you just realize that in Scotland they did it and in the Netherlands they did it because my father-in-law died of a urinary tract infection as if we don't know how to fix that in 2020.

19:20.876 --> 19:28.522
As if it's by accident that people would starve or die of cold or thirst while they are sedated in Scotland or anywhere else.

19:28.582 --> 19:30.104
That's not by accident.

19:31.645 --> 19:42.053
That is sophisticated murder and lie, sculpting a very inconvenient population pyramid with all sorts of different incentives and forces.

19:42.394 --> 19:46.077
And I've said it a million times, but it's not about specific

19:48.126 --> 19:53.371
It's not about specific places and times and explanations.

19:53.431 --> 20:01.559
What you need to understand is that we are living in a world where all that needed to happen was a little more than was expected.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.543
Sweep it together just a little bit so you get these spikes here.

20:07.947 --> 20:10.189
That's not millions of people.

20:10.449 --> 20:21.459
It's hundreds of thousands, which actually means in America, the hundreds of thousands of people known to have died from opioids is enough to explain those spikes.

20:22.159 --> 20:30.807
Nevermind the fact that we have numbers from the CDC that demonstrate that we lost control of pneumonia, something that we've had control of for decades.

20:33.618 --> 20:35.720
That's the problem here, ladies and gentlemen.

20:36.380 --> 20:47.149
And that's the reason why we can't look, can't stop focusing on this, because these are hundreds of thousands of Americans who have yet to have justice.

20:47.690 --> 20:52.454
Hundreds of thousands of families that have yet to understand why they're missing their father.

20:54.673 --> 21:07.139
because the same people that convinced us in chorus to believe that there might be a lab leak with a fear and cleavage site having spike protein that can cause amyloidosis.

21:07.719 --> 21:17.563
Those same people are now standing in front of us as part of a fake Trump administration to tell us that they've been fighting for us all along and that goodness sakes, it's the spike protein.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.585
We must wake up and realize we've been played.

21:23.137 --> 21:27.001
Because America is going to be destroyed by this cognitive dissidence.

21:27.061 --> 21:34.249
And right now, unfortunately, the blue team feels very much like they are right.

21:35.590 --> 21:36.772
And it's by design.

21:36.832 --> 21:40.476
It's a military seesaw that we've been on.

21:45.373 --> 21:47.395
And we've got to get our country off of it.

21:47.415 --> 21:49.056
We've got to get our world off of it.

21:49.096 --> 22:04.367
We've got to get off of social media because social media is what's sustaining this seesaw that Europe is on, that America is on where there's a conservative side and a, and a liberal or progressive side or something like that.

22:04.407 --> 22:09.231
This illusion is being cast over the entire English speaking world.

22:10.905 --> 22:13.647
And it's being done using social media.

22:13.787 --> 22:22.873
And the primary objectives that they have achieved are, number one, a managing of the acute population pyramid problem.

22:23.333 --> 22:31.379
And that is a top-heavy population pyramid, a population pyramid with lots of old people that cost lots of money and don't pay taxes.

22:32.199 --> 22:37.483
That's an inconvenient thing in America, in Japan, even in China.

22:38.143 --> 22:40.545
Everywhere in the progressed world,

22:42.486 --> 22:56.942
They have a top heavy population pyramid where a bunch of people that were very wealthy and paying taxes, stop paying taxes and start pulling money out in the form of Medicare and in the form of just living and not putting money in.

22:59.480 --> 23:19.085
And in America, given the fact that you understand that America's budget is not some kind of running a surplus Norway kind of situation, that change in financial dynamic is not small because those old people of the boomer generation are not being replaced by a high paid younger class.

23:22.806 --> 23:23.566
They're just not.

23:26.007 --> 23:30.514
And so this game is not something that no one's ever figured out.

23:30.574 --> 23:33.738
This game is not something that no one's ever seen coming.

23:33.758 --> 23:40.648
This change in fundamental dynamics of our socioeconomic system is not something that

23:41.249 --> 23:43.230
that these people haven't anticipated.

23:43.310 --> 24:04.358
Instead, just like the actual fact of the population pyramid, the fact that there's an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was managed using manslaughter and lies, it is a simple fact that these people have known that this financial change was going to occur.

24:05.441 --> 24:12.842
It's a simple fact that these people have known that we were eventually going to have $37 trillion in national debt.

24:13.242 --> 24:34.866
And so now there is a narrative momentum in biology, public health, finance, and the governance of public opinion because social media has become ever more relevant in everyone's mind as how information passes and is controlled.

24:36.857 --> 24:39.998
And so that's why the title of the show is Between Two Phases.

24:40.058 --> 24:43.880
We are between two phases right now, like it or not.

24:43.920 --> 24:52.084
I don't wanna say that, but we are because the dollar obviously is not gonna be there when my son is 60 years old.

24:53.723 --> 24:57.886
I don't know how that math works, but I don't think that's really possible.

24:58.007 --> 25:01.830
I don't know why, but I just have the feeling that's not the case.

25:01.890 --> 25:04.151
And so we are between two phases.

25:04.212 --> 25:11.057
I don't think the European Union is a stable, you know, multilateral organization that's going to be there in a hundred years.

25:11.117 --> 25:12.078
I just don't see it.

25:15.481 --> 25:19.142
I don't think China is gonna be who they are in 30 years either.

25:19.303 --> 25:20.903
I just don't see it.

25:21.003 --> 25:22.504
I don't know what it's gonna be there.

25:22.524 --> 25:32.448
I don't claim to be that guy, but I know for sure that this was all part of a plan that's on a time scale that social media does not allow you to see.

25:33.228 --> 25:35.809
And so I got a lot of work to do.

25:35.889 --> 25:37.209
We've all got a lot of work to do.

25:37.309 --> 25:38.150
Thanks for being here.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.091
I will see you again in a minute.

27:30.860 --> 27:34.582
And when John Lewis said he was not a legitimate president, I assume you're on that page.

27:34.782 --> 27:38.103
I am on that page because he's not a legitimate president.

27:39.544 --> 27:41.125
I would agree with that.

27:43.092 --> 27:44.073
But he is the president.

27:44.233 --> 27:47.054
I mean, it's one of those you have to keep two thoughts in your head at the same time.

27:47.154 --> 27:48.215
I do have a president.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.396
We are still Americans.

27:49.456 --> 27:50.717
He is the American president.

27:51.137 --> 27:51.477
I agree.

27:51.497 --> 27:53.118
He didn't get there quite legitimately.

27:54.739 --> 27:55.399
But here's the thing.

27:55.439 --> 27:59.001
I think we're underselling how the non-legitimately part of this works.

27:59.122 --> 27:59.702
Oh, not me.

27:59.942 --> 28:00.943
I agree.

28:01.463 --> 28:09.608
But I spoke to a group of Democrats and liberals last night in Florida, and half of them were, like this crowd, fired up and understanding, we were invaded.

28:10.208 --> 28:13.449
is what it boils down to, just because there was not blood on the streets.

28:13.509 --> 28:14.249
Right.

28:14.689 --> 28:19.450
If the Russians had come in with Cossacks and put him in, I think we would have had a different kind of reaction to it.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.870
That's the reaction we need now.

28:21.210 --> 28:28.152
What I saw last night was a lot of people hooting and hollering correctly and getting fired up and going, we're going to resist this in every way possible.

28:28.352 --> 28:31.112
And other people going, you really think it's that serious?

28:31.493 --> 28:33.113
Yes, I do think it's that serious.

28:33.493 --> 28:34.413
It's the same thing.

28:34.673 --> 28:35.313
It's the point.

28:36.134 --> 28:37.934
Well, but it's the point of a...

28:39.133 --> 28:45.399
The point of a war, other than to gain territory, is to put the guy you want in charge of somebody else's country.

28:45.899 --> 28:52.605
And we're now only debating at this point, after the story in the New York Times yesterday, how much the Russians decided our election.

28:54.565 --> 28:56.246
Let me cut to, then, mRNA.

28:56.446 --> 28:57.007
OK, sure.

28:57.167 --> 29:02.210
Because I was a guy who did not want the COVID vaccine, but I do want research on mRNA.

29:02.230 --> 29:02.410
Sure.

29:02.630 --> 29:04.432
I don't think that that's crazy stuff.

29:04.532 --> 29:04.692
Right.

29:04.952 --> 29:09.175
In fact, when the next one comes along, I may want to be first on line for it.

29:09.355 --> 29:09.495
Right.

29:09.775 --> 29:13.898
So I'm not down with, I like Bobby too, but I'm not down with him cutting that shit.

29:14.218 --> 29:14.418
Yeah.

29:16.039 --> 29:17.962
mRNA is in every single one of our cells.

29:18.122 --> 29:21.567
A DNA, RNA, RNA protein is kind of like the pathway.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.529
So mRNA itself is not bad.

29:23.750 --> 29:29.037
And the messaging around mRNA vaccines has led people to believe that anything that carries the letters mRNA is bad.

29:29.277 --> 29:33.062
We are all here, and we would not be here were it not for mRNA.

29:33.863 --> 29:40.645
mRNA vaccines are a relatively new technology, controversial because of their implementation during the COVID pandemic.

29:41.005 --> 29:46.446
And indeed, there are people out there who either insist on or have evidence that have vaccine injuries of some sort.

29:46.827 --> 29:51.708
And that has been the rationale for removing this $500 million of support for mRNA research.

29:52.328 --> 29:53.248
I'm going to get some hate.

29:53.628 --> 29:54.389
I might get some love.

29:54.429 --> 29:55.369
Doesn't really matter to me.

29:55.869 --> 30:12.214
What is important for me to say is that there is incredible work on non-COVID-related mRNA vaccines related to cancers and related to neurologic conditions and many genetic diseases and many, many things for which we would be absolutely foolish to ignore the technology.

30:12.234 --> 30:13.274
Who's going to hate you for that?

30:13.494 --> 30:14.474
Well, many people.

30:16.195 --> 30:17.715
But you can tell if someone's lying.

30:18.355 --> 30:20.056
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

30:21.906 --> 30:22.607
And I have lied.

30:22.627 --> 30:23.668
I'm sure I'll lie again.

30:23.688 --> 30:24.609
I don't want to lie.

30:24.629 --> 30:26.471
I don't think I'm a liar.

30:26.571 --> 30:27.612
I try not to be a liar.

30:27.632 --> 30:28.493
I don't want to be a liar.

30:29.054 --> 30:31.757
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

30:56.696 --> 31:01.299
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

31:01.319 --> 31:06.942
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

31:08.864 --> 31:12.946
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

31:14.347 --> 31:17.069
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.730
But that's what we're in right now.

31:56.254 --> 32:00.496
And you have to, for many of us, it's shocking.

32:00.516 --> 32:06.138
You cannot conceive of a world in which there are no ethical boundaries.

32:08.038 --> 32:12.180
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.261
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.882
But that's what we're in right now.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.223
There are no ethics.

32:32.303 --> 32:34.965
There are no ethical boundaries to what they will do.

32:36.306 --> 32:39.369
It is all about the utilitarian.

32:41.731 --> 32:47.716
You have to completely park any idea of justice, right and wrong.

32:48.557 --> 32:51.099
All that is obsolete in this battlefield environment.

34:34.676 --> 34:36.238
I think truth is good for kids.

34:36.698 --> 34:40.442
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

34:41.002 --> 34:42.604
We want everybody to feel good.

34:43.544 --> 34:44.986
That's not the way life is.

34:57.938 --> 34:58.919
If it takes two less,

35:00.911 --> 35:05.716
steps to get free fatty acids or ketones into the cell to the mitochondria.

35:06.396 --> 35:10.600
And it produces less byproducts and you get more energy from it.

35:11.181 --> 35:15.725
Doesn't that tell you that that's really the primary fuel, not the secondary fuel?

35:16.286 --> 35:17.467
It's not the alternate fuel.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.908
Sugar is the alternate fuel.

35:19.448 --> 35:19.589
So

35:20.697 --> 35:31.042
You know, it's complex because when you think about, you know, ethnobotany and you think about, well, you know, the sun, the energy, it's photosynthesis and it makes glucose.

35:31.522 --> 35:32.643
But fats are also...

35:35.714 --> 35:37.776
part of organic material, right?

35:37.816 --> 35:38.697
Carbon chain.

35:39.017 --> 35:42.099
And plants, yes, they create glucose and they utilize glucose.

35:42.520 --> 35:51.347
But animals, you know, all use fats and most are fat adapted all the time and should be.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.589
You know, most in the wild are fat adapted.

35:54.009 --> 35:54.950
What time is it?

35:55.010 --> 35:55.771
Game time!

35:55.851 --> 35:56.091
Woo!

35:59.234 --> 36:01.255
Whoa, hello, welcome to the show.

36:01.275 --> 36:02.677
There it is.

36:05.239 --> 36:13.504
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you might not be a parent of teen kids if you don't know the cartoon characters you just saw there.

36:14.184 --> 36:16.206
But my kids are under attack just like yours.

36:16.246 --> 36:18.407
Those are Fortnite characters dancing there.

36:19.407 --> 36:20.228
I'm sorry about that.

36:20.268 --> 36:21.309
I won't use that often.

36:21.329 --> 36:31.815
Welcome to the show where intramuscular injection is dumb, RNA cannot pandemic, transfection is a crime, and autism is a myth used to confuse you about stuff.

36:32.395 --> 36:33.996
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

36:34.036 --> 36:34.977
Biology is the Way.

36:34.997 --> 36:39.421
Giga Home Biological is part of a greater, independent bright web that's just now forming.

36:40.221 --> 36:41.643
I'm getting really excited about it.

36:41.663 --> 36:44.445
You've got to get yourself and your kids off of social media.

36:44.965 --> 36:46.687
Can you use it safely?

36:46.707 --> 36:47.948
I guess that's possible.

36:48.808 --> 36:55.534
But you're going to need to use it in a very different way, with a very different conscious level of what's being done on it.

36:55.614 --> 37:00.198
So you're going to have to screen the people that you trust in a different way.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.341
and the best way to do it is to have a good understanding of why autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

37:05.421 --> 37:08.143
What would you use such a myth to do?

37:08.563 --> 37:18.629
Well, you would use it to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, that public health is never questioned as a reason.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.031
Those are pretty deep statements to make

37:21.531 --> 37:25.974
in 2025, and we're the only people on the internet making those statements.

37:26.194 --> 37:35.500
Also, pandemics and gain of function being mythologies, if anybody's saying that, they heard it from us first, because we were the first people on the internet to figure it out.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.122
My family is the one that figured it out at the dinner table.

37:40.302 --> 37:50.489
And it's my family that's putting it all on the line to try and get our kids to realize why the cheese is free on social media.

37:51.650 --> 37:55.919
And I think the way to do it is to teach them the biology that all these other people ignore.

37:56.600 --> 38:01.911
Show them the concerted effort to ignore this biology on the internet.

38:02.975 --> 38:25.132
and let them see that as a parallel to the way that discussions about Donald Trump are orchestrated on the internet and how discussions about vitamins are orchestrated on the internet so that your kids can see that the primary danger of social media and the internet is that people can gang up on you and lie to you.

38:25.232 --> 38:27.433
People on very complicated scripts

38:28.334 --> 38:40.286
um and who would have the most complicated script who would execute the most complicated script well of course the military would if the military was gonna run some kind of i don't know pandemic exercise

38:43.297 --> 38:59.644
And if they were gonna try to make you believe that aliens were coming, and you go to the War of the Worlds analogy, the way that they would make you think that aliens were coming were put a bunch of people on social media with videos that seemed to indicate that aliens were coming.

39:00.564 --> 39:02.285
It would be almost too easy.

39:02.905 --> 39:08.328
And if you didn't stay focused, if you didn't stay focused on the biology,

39:09.563 --> 39:25.104
of the absurdities of their claims about the the aliens and what the aliens can do or what the aliens have brought or what the aliens they know about the aliens if you didn't pay close attention to the biology i mean staying razor focused on the biology

39:26.065 --> 39:45.368
You might not realize that they were telling you a bunch of hocus-pocus about the aliens, you know, and all the biology of the aliens that they know for sure is the reason why you gotta stay home, the reason why you gotta take these tests because the aliens are here, and if this test tests positive, you know, your family might be in danger.

39:46.209 --> 40:01.810
You can see how this fifth generation warfare was used against us and how just the collective agreement about the wrong questions is the way that they have bamboozled almost a planet of people.

40:02.731 --> 40:12.119
As crazy as it sounds, I think that's the reason why there's a Health Freedom Movement, because this is about bamboozling a planet with social media.

40:12.219 --> 40:20.425
And so, really, almost a decade ago, they were already preparing for this global bamboozlement.

40:22.387 --> 40:24.088
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

40:24.148 --> 40:27.951
Intramuscular injection is dumb and transfection is a crime.

40:28.011 --> 40:30.994
Population pyramids are real, that's why they don't show them to you.

40:33.154 --> 40:34.497
Population pyramids are real.

40:34.537 --> 40:45.858
That's why they don't show them to you and instead what they show you on social media is a glorified It's a glorified Star Trek episode

40:46.974 --> 40:50.956
where people like Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:51.076 --> 41:02.343
pose as science officers on the bridge, where Donald Trump poses as the captain of the Enterprise or the Admiral or whatever, deciding what to do.

41:02.383 --> 41:05.745
And when Donald Trump comes in the room, everybody agrees that he's the captain.

41:06.705 --> 41:09.247
And so, you know, this is how the show works.

41:10.330 --> 41:17.785
And if you want to see how it works behind the scenes, if you want to go to the after show party, then you got to go along with the show.

41:18.987 --> 41:22.093
You just got to go along with the show and the show includes a script.

41:22.827 --> 41:34.152
If you want to know how this cast of characters celebrates after the show, you want to be on the show, you've got to audition, you've got to be selected, you've got to be one of the lucky ones.

41:34.632 --> 41:39.054
And then when you sit in that chair, you are agreeing to recite the lines.

41:39.294 --> 41:47.137
Not only that, you're agreeing to memorize the lines and recite them in precise coordination with the other people on this set.

41:48.228 --> 42:04.736
And if you can do the thought exercise to realize how actually having a set with cameras and sounds and microphones and then post-editing and special effects is much more difficult to create an illusion.

42:05.586 --> 42:12.211
than it is to have social media and a bunch of people with some really tiny low-resolution videos to create an illusion.

42:12.712 --> 42:17.956
Especially if that illusion is about stuff that all the people in the audience already believe is real.

42:18.716 --> 42:29.285
Because they've seen decades of movies that talk about contagions and worldwide spread and a pandemic that wipes out everybody and makes apes intelligent.

42:33.348 --> 42:37.509
So that's the urgency with which we need to get off of social media.

42:37.549 --> 42:51.274
Right now, most people that are engaged in social media think that they are able to change the script of the Star Trek episode that they are watching if they tweet or post the right thing on Facebook.

42:52.874 --> 42:55.135
And our kids are growing up to think that too.

42:56.555 --> 42:58.156
And that's the trap we need to end.

42:59.423 --> 43:22.848
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to end it, one very rudimentary example of how we might end it is for our children to start their own PeerTubes, their own upload sites where they can share videos with their friends and delete videos they want to delete and link to other kids, PeerTubes or not, and just start a decentralized, federated version of the internet where

43:23.328 --> 43:42.349
people use open source platforms so that everybody is, you know, obviously not taking things from each other or profiting off of the interaction with one another, but freely sharing information with one another and promoting the people that they want to promote and building networks that really are true grassroots network.

43:43.130 --> 43:45.150
on a virtual space.

43:45.371 --> 43:49.311
That's the kind of future that's possible with code that already exists.

43:49.411 --> 43:54.532
And so thanks to a supporter and friend, that's what we're doing here.

43:54.752 --> 44:00.934
And part of the financial burden of doing this, about a third of it is taken up by Mark Kulak right now.

44:00.994 --> 44:04.314
And he has got a channel there and he's uploading his stuff there.

44:04.334 --> 44:10.896
And that means that when you download the PeerTube app and you input this URL when prompted,

44:11.976 --> 44:17.421
you will be able to see him on your phone with very low to zero lag.

44:17.822 --> 44:26.089
You can watch my live streams and soon we're going to be able to, well we can probably right now already, open up the possibility that he could also stream there live.

44:26.129 --> 44:33.096
It's just really a question of whether we're going to do that or whether we're going to just build another PeerTube instance for him.

44:33.116 --> 44:35.959
And the cool thing about PeerTube is that

44:36.619 --> 44:50.535
If his peer tube, for example, was to mirror my live stream channel, then when you go to his peer tube, one of the recommended channels that would be there would already be mine.

44:50.615 --> 44:53.999
And so even if somebody found his peer tube and not mine,

44:54.560 --> 45:05.166
he could already choose to set it up that some of my videos get mirrored and even backed up on his servers, which is a pretty magnificent feature that's already built in.

45:05.226 --> 45:12.691
It's already there for you to try and build a network where if you wanna give some resources to somebody else, you can.

45:13.131 --> 45:17.994
And this is really quite magnificent because, you know, this has been developed over many years.

45:18.034 --> 45:19.555
There's lots of people involved.

45:19.575 --> 45:20.736
The code is very open.

45:20.776 --> 45:22.697
And if we wanna do the work necessary

45:23.297 --> 45:31.483
to do this on a bigger scale to support more people, maybe like Joe or Dan Cohen, or even just starting out with our friend Mark.

45:31.543 --> 45:32.764
This is what I want to do.

45:32.884 --> 45:40.230
One of the main things I want to do besides a high school curriculum is this, build this really independent bright web.

45:40.290 --> 45:47.476
And so that's one of the reasons why I think it's really important to support my work and Mark's work by sharing it.

45:47.916 --> 45:52.500
Because I know that not everybody can support financially, and I know it's a big ask.

45:53.561 --> 46:02.978
But also think about the fact that with the app and having myself, all the work that I do available on your phone, that's as good as Netflix can do.

46:04.246 --> 46:08.388
That is as good, I don't even know, you might be able to put the PeerTube app on your smart TV.

46:08.788 --> 46:10.949
I should try that later because that's pretty badass.

46:11.769 --> 46:16.711
I bet you it would go on my Apple TV upstairs very easy because Apple TV is like the app store.

46:16.751 --> 46:17.491
So that should work.

46:18.652 --> 46:22.093
And I suspect that a lot of these other devices are just the Google Play Store.

46:22.133 --> 46:25.054
So again, you can also download directly.

46:25.094 --> 46:26.535
I think somebody has said that before.

46:27.055 --> 46:30.398
It may be the Google Play in the app store adding code to it.

46:30.458 --> 46:43.427
And so you may somehow want to verify that or just try to download the app directly from their website or the GitHub and then upload it in the way that I don't, I'm not going to put out a way to do that, but I'm just saying somebody put that concern out there.

46:43.467 --> 46:48.531
So if you have that concern, there are steps that you could take that might make that better.

46:48.551 --> 46:50.673
So we have a fake anti-vax movement in America.

46:51.213 --> 46:52.354
That much is for certain.

46:55.606 --> 46:57.527
School shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

46:57.587 --> 46:58.507
Wonderful, great.

46:59.907 --> 47:02.888
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

47:02.928 --> 47:05.189
Transfection in healthy humans was always a crime.

47:05.229 --> 47:09.710
It's not some kind of, you know, just barely tested technology.

47:09.830 --> 47:15.852
It is a technology we've been using on the academic bench for decades, at least a decade, if not two decades.

47:16.832 --> 47:19.532
RNA cannot pandemic because that's not how RNA works.

47:20.853 --> 47:24.434
And autism is a meaningless word by design because the more

47:26.115 --> 47:32.520
unrelated symptomologies they roll in under that umbrella, the more meaningless the term is.

47:33.161 --> 47:43.689
And if you're familiar with your biological history at all, you will be aware that the diagnosis of and classification of all the diseases associated with AIDS was an ever-expanding list.

47:43.749 --> 47:53.778
Essentially, any symptoms that were possessed by a group of people that was also testing positive for AIDS would essentially be added to the list, even if it was uterine cancer.

47:54.679 --> 47:59.446
And so these kinds of things are very... Oh, that's interesting.

47:59.486 --> 48:02.770
I have to set that to playback automatically loop.

48:03.071 --> 48:03.832
Why didn't that work?

48:05.314 --> 48:07.337
Maybe it's just because we're at the end of the rope there.

48:10.416 --> 48:13.839
I test my RAM a lot with my PowerPoint presentations.

48:14.340 --> 48:28.372
I'm really happy that we have such a succinct message, an irreducibly complex background that was studied even rudimentarily between the year 2002 when the first SARS epidemic was declared

48:29.052 --> 48:40.739
And 2020 would have given them about 18 years to study that background and to choose a few rather robust background signals on which to base this novel pandemic.

48:40.780 --> 48:49.145
This is just one scenario that wouldn't involve a lot of gain-of-function magic or a lot of, you know, bioweapons or anything like that.

48:49.205 --> 48:50.646
And in fact, it would be foolproof.

48:51.326 --> 49:11.006
I think one of the things that a lot of these people that claim to be experts on how this is done and can describe kill boxes and this kind of thing, they omit one problem that I think all good, long-term, effective military plans have in them, inbuilt, is that they're almost foolproof.

49:12.939 --> 49:18.801
And if there is a plan that is close to foolproof, that's the plan they're going to take.

49:19.401 --> 49:25.443
And the close to foolproof plan is not to create a novel virus and let it go.

49:25.463 --> 49:31.944
A close to foolproof plan is not to make up a story about something that isn't there.

49:32.425 --> 49:33.665
A foolproof plan

49:35.700 --> 49:49.840
would involve a background signal that they misconstrued as spread, and the misconstruing of its spread should be as precise as possible, to have the illusion of specificity and high resolution measurements,

49:50.782 --> 50:10.238
And so that was also provided in spades by all of the diagnostic software and diagnostic tools and machines that got together and all the new, you know, grant money and funding of all these pop-up testing areas and all these kits that came in the mail that were produced with

50:10.811 --> 50:17.492
all kinds of really fancy, you know, pictures and stuff on them, quick view at home, COVID-19 tests and all this other crap.

50:18.032 --> 50:27.174
That stuff created an illusion that we could take a very high fidelity measurement with a swab that you mailed into the mail.

50:27.634 --> 50:37.516
And that high fidelity measurement would tell you something about the background rather than something about the person that just put the swab in their nose.

50:40.967 --> 50:46.073
And that's the primary illusion, because that's still going on in every doctor's office.

50:46.994 --> 50:52.621
And more importantly, the doctors that are on Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

50:52.601 --> 50:55.024
's side, they're all doing it.

50:56.246 --> 50:56.907
None of them.

50:57.918 --> 51:12.602
despite their amazing insight into the fraud of COVID, have not discovered or come to understand the PCR testing for viral markers as being fraudulent.

51:14.083 --> 51:16.944
Imagine that, because that's where we are.

51:18.424 --> 51:23.726
And it is this simple illusion of consensus on all sides

51:24.497 --> 51:45.487
that the PCR testing, the lateral flow testing is not only not to be questioned, doesn't need to be regulated, but can be default accepted as a lucky happenstance that we now have a new gold standard for diagnosing the presence of and the symptomologies of viruses.

51:45.527 --> 51:46.988
And that is just absurd.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.329
We went in 2020 from not using it at all

51:54.028 --> 52:01.335
giving it no credence to now, for at least two years, basing all of our diagnosis on it.

52:01.675 --> 52:06.640
And if it failed, we would assume that it failed in a false negative way.

52:07.941 --> 52:14.567
Because if the symptoms are there, but the PCR tests positive, that just might mean because the RNA flew away too early.

52:19.369 --> 52:31.458
And so the really heartbreaking thing is, is that since I graduated from high school in 1990, it has been brutally obvious on the population pyramid that there is an expected rise in all cause mortality.

52:31.819 --> 52:45.029
And if you watch it really carefully, it's just gonna rise and make those bars at the top of the population pyramid grow in a way that will exceed the capacity of our old folks' homes and hospitals.

52:46.104 --> 52:52.548
will exceed the capacity of our socioeconomic system to absorb their unlimited care.

52:55.750 --> 53:13.841
And so with a carefully orchestrated global narrative perpetuated by, announced by, and perpetuated by all the governments that had the problem or were under the finger economically or militarily of the governments that did have the problem,

53:14.642 --> 53:15.963
and they all went along with it.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.166
That's why this line is not level.

53:21.467 --> 53:38.240
That's why nobody in the dissident movement talks about this being upcoming 31st being Overdose Awareness Day, because those hundreds of thousands of Americans that are wrapped up in this graph cannot be acknowledged or poof, there goes the novel virus.

53:38.401 --> 53:40.102
There goes the protocols even.

53:42.591 --> 53:47.395
because the protocols don't even have to have killed hundreds of thousands of people.

53:47.555 --> 54:01.607
If you acknowledge the opioid pandemic, the opioid crisis, then you only needed to kill tens of thousands of people in America in total, which is peanuts, ladies and gentlemen, because 3 million people die every year here.

54:03.989 --> 54:08.513
And so you can very quickly see how those numbers are teeny, tiny, tiny numbers.

54:09.625 --> 54:17.347
Once you subtract the malfeasance of removal of antibiotics and you subtract the opioids, there's almost nothing left.

54:17.427 --> 54:33.950
And so the illusion, the spell that people are under is magical because very few people actually know anyone that they didn't expect to die but died of COVID unless they went to the hospital and took oxygen.

54:33.970 --> 54:37.291
And those are enough, that's a small enough number of people

54:38.763 --> 54:43.845
that it's not catching fire because this was almost a foolproof plan.

54:45.466 --> 54:51.509
The other convenient thing is, is that it seems like nobody in America cares that if you die of opioids, it might not be your fault.

54:53.090 --> 55:05.536
It's heartbreaking to see that people in neuroscience who have been studying addiction for 20 years understand that a one shot of cocaine can make a rat basically kill itself.

55:07.403 --> 55:11.467
because they just can't stop behaving in that detrimental way anymore.

55:12.168 --> 55:30.105
But we don't have any, you know, there's no branch of neurobiology that's advocating for the addicts that are actually human, even though the neurobiology of addiction is well enough understood to know that anybody who's addicted to opioids is seriously...

55:32.850 --> 55:35.251
You're in big trouble.

55:35.331 --> 55:50.494
There's probably just a handful of people with the combination of biology and mentality and spiritual awareness and whatever that can maybe pull themselves out of that on their own.

55:50.894 --> 55:54.415
But if one dose is a lethal dose, ladies and gentlemen, come on.

55:56.658 --> 56:26.162
If you know the history of the CDC and what they did in 2013, 14, 15 with regard to prescribed opiates, and you understand what started to happen as I've highlighted above here in 2019, it brings me almost to tears to think about what they've done to America and how they've ripped us apart in our minds by killing us.

56:27.455 --> 56:29.857
and getting us to fight over why these people died.

56:31.278 --> 56:36.762
Because people go on the internet and are coordinatedly lying about why these people died.

56:38.383 --> 56:43.287
And they're making thousands of dollars a month on Substack, thousands of dollars a month on Locals.

56:43.327 --> 56:45.949
They have hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube.

56:45.969 --> 56:48.511
They don't get censored for real.

56:50.011 --> 56:51.632
They get to go on Tucker Carlson.

56:52.092 --> 56:58.074
Their dads worked for the John F. Kennedy administration in the FDA when Estes Kefauver was killed.

57:01.055 --> 57:03.416
They are all intellectual property experts.

57:03.956 --> 57:05.837
Some of them worked for Goldman Sachs.

57:06.017 --> 57:08.478
You know, it's like a joke to me at this point.

57:10.338 --> 57:12.479
While we have Whitney Webb talking about Epstein.

57:14.039 --> 57:20.082
But Whitney Webb doesn't know anything about Goldman Sachs and Steve Bannon and Aaron Seery.

57:21.623 --> 57:35.411
Doesn't know anything about the intellectual property expert that Steve Bannon claims to be, that Kevin McKernan definitely is because of a Nature paper in 2013, that Robert Malone is.

57:35.431 --> 57:38.993
I mean, these people are not behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:39.033 --> 57:39.553
for nothing.

57:40.876 --> 57:45.680
And to my own defense, I did not fall for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:45.720 --> 57:46.281
for nothing.

57:46.621 --> 57:50.364
And when John Lewis said he was not a legitimate president, I assume you're on that page.

57:50.564 --> 57:53.907
I am on that page because he's not a legitimate president.

57:55.368 --> 57:59.892
I would agree with that, but he is the president.

58:00.032 --> 58:02.854
I mean, it's one of those you have to keep two thoughts in your head at the same time.

58:03.095 --> 58:08.179
Now, I think what really breaks this for me and what I'm really excited to share with you is this particular insight.

58:09.457 --> 58:17.141
If you really believed that Donald Trump was an illegitimate president, had stolen the presidency, then all bets are off.

58:20.563 --> 58:24.485
And all bets should have been off even after Biden got elected.

58:26.086 --> 58:31.628
And now you should be going batshit crazy because Donald Trump is now president again.

58:31.728 --> 58:34.390
And so it's kind of eerily parallel.

58:35.799 --> 58:53.378
to the idea that some of these people have been writing books about all the kids that are being killed and all the kids that are being injured and all the eczema and all the allergies that all these kids are getting because of the vaccine schedule, but these people don't seem to make any real progress in understanding.

58:53.418 --> 58:57.923
And more importantly, it never becomes urgent enough to go all in.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.201
They still go on vacation.

59:01.241 --> 59:03.623
They still do like cannabis conferences.

59:04.043 --> 59:07.645
They're still selling, I don't know, infrared saunas.

59:09.586 --> 59:14.930
Even though they know kids are being killed apparently every day by vaccines.

59:16.771 --> 59:21.114
I guess the only thing there is to do is sell stuff and, you know, try to make ends meet.

59:22.867 --> 59:29.693
It's like you saw the aliens and they came to your house and they stole your kid and they brought him back a week later, but you know, whatever.

59:29.733 --> 59:32.076
I'm just going to go back working to the hardware store again.

59:32.116 --> 59:36.820
You know, I'm going to tell people about it, but only in between my job and stuff.

59:39.249 --> 59:44.051
And I don't like that because I'm a person who had a long career in neuroscience.

59:44.471 --> 59:59.418
I had a lot to lose in the sense of going out and saying that this is a pandemic, this is a lab leak, this is crazy, we can't be putting on masks and putting kids on iPads at home, this is ridiculous.

01:00:00.938 --> 01:00:02.439
We've all forgotten that that happened.

01:00:03.254 --> 01:00:11.177
We've all forgotten that for almost a year and a half, universities, hospitals, schools, businesses, everybody wore masks.

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:12.677
Everybody was nuts about it.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.798
And this was all part of them.

01:00:15.818 --> 01:00:25.141
These people, this guy too, and all the people that are now telling us kind of sort of skeptical of RNA, but now he says, what does he say?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.885
So listen to this carefully because this is what a national security governance by podcast looks like.

01:00:35.085 --> 01:00:47.273
They orchestrated in 2017 the Trump derangement syndrome by telling everybody that our democracy had been hijacked.

01:00:47.293 --> 01:00:49.595
That's the absolute worst case scenario.

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:52.770
No different than a lab leak.

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:57.131
This guy was installed by Russian interference.

01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:59.372
Holy crap.

01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:04.154
And so half the country thinks they won.

01:01:05.234 --> 01:01:08.875
The other half of the country thinks that it was stolen.

01:01:09.936 --> 01:01:14.057
And this is the context in which we went into the pandemic.

01:01:14.097 --> 01:01:15.758
You cannot forget this.

01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:26.441
And this is the reason why people are now so destroyed because it was a decades long and certainly a decade long theater.

01:01:27.202 --> 01:01:35.266
Because this is the same year that Brett Weinstein would have all of his problems and get to go in front of the Senate and get a half a million dollars settlement.

01:01:37.228 --> 01:01:46.433
This is the same year that Vinay Prasad gets in the newspapers about being a, you know, going against the grain kind of physician at Stanford.

01:01:49.659 --> 01:01:55.402
This is the year that a lot of the people started to do the things that they did going into the pandemic.

01:01:55.442 --> 01:01:59.364
This is the year when, you know, all of the Joe Rogan stuff really took off.

01:01:59.404 --> 01:02:00.225
This is all of it.

01:02:00.285 --> 01:02:01.245
It's all right here.

01:02:03.566 --> 01:02:07.348
And you can see how absurd it is if you just listen to this actor.

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:13.792
That's what he is, a scripted actor who's allowed to improvise within a script.

01:02:13.852 --> 01:02:17.954
That's the whole and only illusion here.

01:02:19.707 --> 01:02:24.331
And he could be an irate, unwitting participant, but it's not very likely.

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:38.102
It's more likely that he is a limited, scripted actor, a need-to-know basis scripted actor, and he's staying on script because that's what you do when you have a chair on the USS Enterprise.

01:02:38.162 --> 01:02:42.045
You don't go off script because that's not what actors get paid to do.

01:02:42.986 --> 01:02:44.407
And they certainly don't question it.

01:02:45.543 --> 01:03:07.850
do have a president we are still americans he is the american president i agree he didn't get there quite legitimately uh... but but but here's the thing i think we're still under selling how the non legitimately part of this work oh not me if what i i agree with that but i spoke to a group of of democrats and liberals last night in florida and half of the more like this crowd fired up an understanding dot we were invaded

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:12.471
is what it boils down to, just because there was not blood on the street.

01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:19.133
So we were essentially invaded by Russia and Donald Trump was elected president.

01:03:19.173 --> 01:03:20.833
Otherwise we'd have Hillary right now.

01:03:21.933 --> 01:03:27.695
And people in that audience clapped reluctantly, even though the stage manager was probably going like this.

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:34.241
And so this is 10 years ago, ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:35.842
Essentially, it's eight years ago.

01:03:36.002 --> 01:03:48.771
It's long time ago, long enough for you to see how we have been played, how your family have been played, why you need to forgive anybody that voted for Biden, anybody that voted for Harris, anybody that voted for Trump.

01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:50.312
You have to forgive them.

01:03:52.284 --> 01:03:58.447
Because we were given two ridiculous choices several years in a row, and all of us have become numb to it.

01:03:58.787 --> 01:04:03.649
Because these people that we are watching are not numb to it.

01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:10.452
Because these people who we are watching are very, very sure that our democracy has been destroyed.

01:04:10.492 --> 01:04:11.413
We've been invaded.

01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:15.578
And this guy's not arguing with him.

01:04:15.638 --> 01:04:20.662
I guess you just, I have a, I have a slightly less, you know, worst case scenario take on that.

01:04:20.702 --> 01:04:31.228
You mean like a slightly worse, less worst case scenario take on a lab leak being a engineered virus or is it just a natural virus that they found and grew in the lab and then it got out.

01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:34.911
We got, it was already, you know, dangerous and already had its own potential.

01:04:36.468 --> 01:04:43.950
It's exactly the same kind of coin with two sides and it's really just two sides of bullshit.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:51.352
And as long as these people are flipping it between each other and agreeing that those two sides are, we got to decide whether it's heads or tails.

01:04:52.353 --> 01:04:56.954
That's the whole thing because the coin will never land on its edge.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:04:59.895
And so, you know, we got, we,

01:05:01.302 --> 01:05:06.345
They agree that right now the coin to flip is is it really that bad or is?

01:05:06.926 --> 01:05:10.128
Did we get invaded by Russia and now we have a puppet president?

01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:15.491
Is it really that bad or do we have a puppet president?

01:05:16.231 --> 01:05:22.135
Is it a natural virus that they just grew in the laboratory because that's what they do in labs or is it a lab leak?

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:31.612
Are only a very few people hurt by vaccines or do vaccines cause autism and stuff?

01:05:37.818 --> 01:05:38.619
It's a trap.

01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:45.674
If the Russians had come in with Cossacks and put him in, I think we would have had a different kind of reaction to it.

01:05:45.714 --> 01:05:47.114
That's the reaction we need now.

01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:54.397
What I saw last night was a lot of people hooting and hollering correctly and getting fired up and going, we're going to resist this in every way possible.

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:57.338
And other people going, you really think it's that serious?

01:05:57.718 --> 01:05:59.338
Yes, I do think it's that serious.

01:05:59.718 --> 01:06:00.639
It's the same thing.

01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:01.539
It's the point.

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.140
Well, but it's the point of a...

01:06:05.342 --> 01:06:11.631
The point of a war, other than to gain territory, is to put the guy you want in charge of somebody else's country.

01:06:12.132 --> 01:06:18.842
And we're now only debating at this point, after the story in the New York Times yesterday, how much the Russians decided our election.

01:06:20.273 --> 01:06:22.253
And now we fast forward to now.

01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:22.994
Okay, sure.

01:06:23.134 --> 01:06:28.175
Because, like, I was a guy who did not want the COVID vaccine, but I do want research on mRNA.

01:06:28.195 --> 01:06:28.375
Sure.

01:06:28.595 --> 01:06:30.395
I don't think that that's crazy stuff.

01:06:30.495 --> 01:06:30.655
Right.

01:06:30.895 --> 01:06:35.136
In fact, when the next one comes along, I may want to be first on line for it.

01:06:35.476 --> 01:06:39.137
Now, you don't, you can't possibly see this as anything other than an actor.

01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:49.219
And once you see this guy's an actor and realize that this is the guy that fooled our family into thinking Donald Trump was okay or better than Harris,

01:06:50.936 --> 01:06:58.783
He's part of the same show that Steve Bannon is, that Joy Behar is, that all of these people are.

01:06:58.843 --> 01:07:08.933
They're all one little tiny cadre of fake conservatives that have come from the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party went too far.

01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:17.745
I think my friend Mark Hulak explained it very well, and it's probably still not exactly how it's best said, but I think it's close.

01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:22.807
There are only really two kinds of people right now that you need to concern yourself with.

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:28.889
People that want to be in power, and people that mind their own business.

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:36.131
That just, you know, try to set an example, try to do their best, take care of their garden, whatever that is.

01:07:38.393 --> 01:07:41.656
try to help those people around them, try to lift those people up around them.

01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:43.697
And then you have people who want to be in power.

01:07:44.117 --> 01:07:52.604
And once you understand that the hierarchy of power, the lower hierarchy is the public part.

01:07:54.165 --> 01:07:57.488
If you are higher in the hierarchy, you might not be so public.

01:07:58.993 --> 01:08:02.636
And of course, the highest people in the hierarchy nobody ever talks about.

01:08:02.696 --> 01:08:09.421
And that I think we all can accept on a sort of imaginary level or a thought experiment level.

01:08:09.842 --> 01:08:12.744
But what you need to accept it is on a governance level.

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:44.554
that we are in a phase transition between the governance by newspaper and TV show and radio program and magazine to governance by cable TV and the overwhelming amount of BS on cable TV, the overwhelming amount of time wasting content on cable TV to social media where people can be actively manipulated based on their choices,

01:08:45.762 --> 01:09:11.416
based on their preferences and then based on, again, coordinated acting to create the stories that people are engaged in, to create the Star Trek episodes and the expanse and the intrigue of the White House, all of which will be amplified by the media, all of which has to be amplified by the media because social media makes it that people are talking about.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:17.830
Social media creates the trends that mainstream media is kind of forced to report on.

01:09:18.251 --> 01:09:33.603
And so the power has been inverted over the course of this transition through the pandemic because people were forced to go on social media and people, and I mean people like this, were actively telling you that the truth was available on Twitter.

01:09:35.322 --> 01:09:43.215
that this person has a particularly good Twitter feed, or I find all of this information on Twitter, or I have a sub stack.

01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:46.902
That's all not by accident, that is by design.

01:09:48.137 --> 01:10:06.660
And if there is any wrestling for power that's happening, it is a wrestling for power between the people who are now kind of in control of social media and the people that were in control of what we would call legacy media and how well they were able to transition to having a presence on the internet.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.463
You know, how well did the New York times transition?

01:10:10.864 --> 01:10:16.851
How well is the New York times transitioning to pushing their content in a podcast sort of way?

01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:22.138
I showed you yesterday, the New York times has already transitioned to podcasting.

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.393
And that transition is by design.

01:10:27.433 --> 01:10:29.634
That is the phase that we are in right now.

01:10:29.694 --> 01:10:34.116
That transition is happening and people have, for a large extent, accepted it.

01:10:34.156 --> 01:10:38.598
What's terrible is that if we don't pull our heads out, our children will never see it.

01:10:40.539 --> 01:10:47.002
And governance by actors like Bill Maher can continue into the endless future.

01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:52.144
All we need are a group of elite people to agree that it's not happening.

01:10:55.723 --> 01:11:19.097
All we have to do is have an elite group of people that understands that governance is occurring via theater, that none of the things that the populace is arguing about are actually relevant to reality or to where the cruise ship is headed, which is inverting the sovereignty of our grandchildren to experimental animal status.

01:11:20.289 --> 01:11:24.412
So I'm not down with, I like Bobby too, but I'm not down with him cutting that shit.

01:11:24.752 --> 01:11:32.116
Yeah, so mRNA is in every single one of our cells, a DNA, RNA, RNA protein is kind of like the pathway.

01:11:32.156 --> 01:11:34.057
So mRNA itself is not bad.

01:11:34.277 --> 01:11:39.561
And the messaging around mRNA vaccines has led people to believe that anything that carries the letters mRNA is bad.

01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:43.583
We are all here and we would not be here were it not for mRNA.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:51.108
Okay, so that's a terribly, terribly stupid, simple, dumb, simple, I guess I say, dumb, simple explanation.

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:53.230
And I want to give you a good analogy why.

01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:59.013
No automobile that has a four-stroke engine will run without oil in it.

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:03.957
And if you run without sufficient oil, that engine will necessarily seize up.

01:12:03.997 --> 01:12:06.879
And I think that's pretty much a catastrophic condition for your car.

01:12:08.914 --> 01:12:19.599
So you could say that, you know, none of the cars on the road would be running quietly as they are, smoke-free as they are, or reliably as they are without regular maintenance that includes oil.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:25.402
In no way, shape, or form does that mean that crude oil could be used there.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:28.164
It doesn't mean that you can put other things in that hole.

01:12:29.488 --> 01:12:35.731
It means that oil should go in that hole, not anywhere, but in that hole and only at the prescribed amount.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:46.237
And so there's quite a bit of specificity to what oil does in a car and how you can safely maintain oil levels in a car and apply oil to a car.

01:12:46.357 --> 01:12:57.243
And as I said yesterday or the day before, it would be probably mechanically unsound to take a quart of oil and just kind of pour it over the top of the engine and hope that it got where it needed to be.

01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:06.768
And so for him to say that RNA, we wouldn't be here without RNA, is so dumb.

01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:16.037
And for him to say that DNA to RNA to protein is so incredibly dumb because in between RNA and protein is the most magical

01:13:17.037 --> 01:13:20.800
molecular machinery that we know of to date, the ribosome.

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.602
We know that ribosomes are tissue specific.

01:13:24.143 --> 01:13:26.925
We know that ribosomes can even be sub-tissue specific.

01:13:27.365 --> 01:13:30.808
We know that mitochondria have their own ribosomes.

01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:39.475
And so the idea that we can just put oil anywhere in the car, that we can just put mRNA anywhere in our bodies,

01:13:41.192 --> 01:13:55.516
and it doesn't matter which ribosome it goes through or where that protein ends up or what other protein fragments are produced or what other mRNA processes are interfered with, mRNAs, we wouldn't be here without it.

01:13:57.117 --> 01:14:04.939
And this is the depth of the biological explanation that Stanford University and this fraud is offering America.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:12.812
albeit on a very, you know, like who watches Bill Maher anymore?

01:14:13.252 --> 01:14:21.994
The point being though, ladies and gentlemen, is that all the people that do, all the people that potentially could see this and be like, huh, that's where America is.

01:14:22.054 --> 01:14:23.135
We weren't ready for this.

01:14:23.235 --> 01:14:31.257
This is just the beginning of the face plant that they have ready for everybody that followed Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:31.297 --> 01:14:32.137
and Marty McCary

01:14:32.978 --> 01:14:35.842
and Jayantabadacharya into this White House.

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:38.287
These people, you have been fooled by them.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:43.836
And that's why Bill Maher has been scripted to say, I don't know, I'm not down with him ending that shit.

01:14:47.199 --> 01:15:00.390
And that's why this Stanford professor is scripted to tell you in a very dumb, simple sort of way why RNA is great and why you should look forward to more RNA because for decades they've known that this is where they're going to go.

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:09.277
But how in the world could they do it before they had the ability to sequence and produce RNA in quantity without very much cost?

01:15:10.398 --> 01:15:11.278
They couldn't do that in 2000.

01:15:14.002 --> 01:15:15.283
They couldn't do that in 2005.

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:22.610
And so even if they wanted to inject an RNA in everybody in 2005, they wouldn't have been able to do it.

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:33.140
And there wouldn't have been a population pyramid signal behind which to hide it.

01:15:37.486 --> 01:15:44.251
mRNA vaccines are a relatively new technology, controversial because of their implementation during the COVID pandemic.

01:15:44.631 --> 01:15:50.055
And indeed, there are people out there who either insist on or have evidence that have vaccine injuries of some sort.

01:15:50.435 --> 01:15:55.319
And that has been the rationale for removing this $500 million of support for mRNA research.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.962
I'm going to get some hate, I might get some love, doesn't really matter to me.

01:15:59.463 --> 01:16:15.881
What is important for me to say is that there is incredible work on non-COVID-related mRNA vaccines related to cancers and related to neurologic conditions and many genetic diseases and many, many things for which we would be absolutely foolish to ignore the technology.

01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:27.485
Now, the reason why it's so creepy that he says that for anybody that's still not tuned in to the real national security theater that's going on here, behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:16:27.845 --> 01:16:45.050
and his fraudulent script is a man by the name of Robert Malone, who has more than two decades of connections to all of this public health infrastructure, going back to having the head of DITRA, David Hone, sleeping on his couch during grad school.

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:58.894
going back to Zika, and Ebola, and the anthrax vaccine, and the WHO, and Rick Bright, and Inovio, and Salve, and Gavi.

01:16:59.274 --> 01:17:11.420
So this guy, Robert Malone, behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is the dude that convinced everybody, or was convinced by social media, to be a whistleblower about the mRNA vaccine.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.162
And your family and friends may have been fooled.

01:17:15.049 --> 01:17:25.232
by Robert Malone or any of his compadres like Pierre Cory or Merrill Nass or Ryan Cole or Peter McCullough.

01:17:26.753 --> 01:17:36.536
And all of those people have been herding cats and got them to vote for Donald Trump and the promise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:41.817
All the while, the plan was to make and humiliate all of those people.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.478
And they're gonna humiliate you by what you hear here.

01:17:45.865 --> 01:17:53.288
that the next generation of mRNA is going, the next generation of RNA injections is going to go forward.

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:58.149
And it is going to be given to your children if you don't do something about it now.

01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:05.812
And they are going to do it by admitting that there is a very rare vaccine injury signal.

01:18:06.272 --> 01:18:12.754
And that vaccine injury signal was actually higher for the rollout of the COVID vaccines.

01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:15.115
And some of these people were right, but

01:18:17.352 --> 01:18:18.253
Vaccines work.

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:19.975
Vaccines don't cause autism.

01:18:20.015 --> 01:18:21.897
And these people are all frauds.

01:18:23.739 --> 01:18:25.661
The measles vaccine actually works.

01:18:26.742 --> 01:18:28.344
They might even be able to prove it to you.

01:18:28.564 --> 01:18:29.325
Imagine that.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:54.689
I'm not telling you that the measles vaccine works, but I'm telling you that the best way to object to vaccines is to not talk about them, to not use that incredibly ridiculously aspecific term, instead and just say that you think that intramuscular injection has been a dumb idea since the late 1800s when people were injecting themselves with all kinds of stuff but mostly morphine.

01:18:57.904 --> 01:19:04.387
And the only vaccines that existed at the time were subcutaneous or cutaneous vaccines that involved pain and scarring.

01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:18.210
And so we misconstrued the ability, the gift of being able to inject morphine intramuscularly as evidence that we could inject whatever we wanted to intramuscularly.

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.410
And it might actually be better than scratching it into our skin.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:27.592
And the people who thought that were biologists and doctors in the late 1800s.

01:19:29.072 --> 01:19:35.033
And because that idea was handed down, because that idea produced textbooks,

01:19:36.636 --> 01:19:51.325
Textbooks in English, like this textbook right here that is titled, Hypodermic Injections in the Treatment of Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Gout, and Other Diseases, written in 1865.

01:19:51.585 --> 01:19:58.890
It even resulted in textbooks in German, okay, in German.

01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:06.913
And this textbook is called Die Hyperdermatische Injection der Arnzimittel.

01:20:08.234 --> 01:20:09.915
And it is written in 1867.

01:20:11.675 --> 01:20:20.119
So don't you think for one second that I'm joking when I say that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the 1800s.

01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:21.219
It actually is.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.842
And so a couple generations with this bad assumption, and here we are.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:31.227
Now, how many people know it's a bad assumption?

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:31.747
I don't know.

01:20:31.807 --> 01:20:42.894
But if you think of this as lemmings, if you see how people behave in groups, then it's very easy to understand how we got here.

01:20:44.295 --> 01:20:46.416
Wouldn't take very many people to understand.

01:20:48.057 --> 01:20:57.143
One more example of how we're being played by the falseness of the Trump administration and all these fake health freedom people that can't figure it out.

01:20:58.915 --> 01:21:07.978
Right now we're talking about giving money to rural hospitals, but we're not addressing the opioid epidemic.

01:21:09.358 --> 01:21:12.559
We're not talking about what's happening, what happened with them.

01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:15.180
In fact, it's strange, but the deaths are going down.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.162
You know, kind of like how the deaths due to untreated pneumonia just kind of disappeared.

01:21:22.542 --> 01:21:24.383
It would be pretty tragic, wouldn't it?

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:36.142
If five years of record opioid deaths started to go down, maybe even went back to a baseline that people accepted, but it was still much higher than it ever should be.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:44.208
How many people in America should die of synthetically manufactured opioids on the street?

01:21:44.328 --> 01:21:45.489
How many is acceptable?

01:21:48.011 --> 01:21:50.653
Because quite frankly, for me, it's zero.

01:21:52.028 --> 01:21:58.990
I don't think anybody in our country should be dying of something that is essentially poisonous on contact.

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:01.191
That just seems insane.

01:22:01.211 --> 01:22:01.491
Nevermind 20,000.

01:22:01.571 --> 01:22:02.131
Nevermind 50,000.

01:22:03.732 --> 01:22:04.392
Nevermind 110,000.

01:22:16.812 --> 01:22:27.037
I think we're really in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen, because we have people telling us that America is under attack or something like that, but we're under attack by the Kazakhs of Russia.

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:32.419
We're under attack because they're inverting our elections.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.022
We're under attack because the administration isn't funding mRNA technology.

01:22:40.943 --> 01:22:44.205
We're under attack because we are being governed by podcasts.

01:22:45.305 --> 01:22:52.991
And nothing that anyone that's skillfully using social media, nothing that they are thinking about is relevant to their well-being or their kid's future.

01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:54.352
And I hate you for that.

01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:55.533
Well, many if you will.

01:22:58.255 --> 01:23:01.657
Yes, there is good evidence of it hurting animals as well.

01:23:03.298 --> 01:23:04.039
Yes, there is.

01:23:05.561 --> 01:23:08.003
I'm not sure if it's higher or lower evidence.

01:23:09.465 --> 01:23:13.490
Again, it's one of those things where we would need to investigate it more.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:19.877
But I do know for sure, in all of my study, I know for sure we're right about this.

01:23:20.558 --> 01:23:37.183
that just the fact of the matter is the immune system, as we best understand it, with the most open-mindedness, you still must acknowledge that the immune system is organized around a barrier and has a directionality to it.

01:23:37.863 --> 01:23:46.326
An intramuscular injection ignores that barrier and the directionality of it and attempts to augment it by bypassing it.

01:23:46.546 --> 01:23:48.987
And that's what makes it a dumb methodology.

01:23:50.768 --> 01:24:00.653
The other evidence that it's a dumb methodology is that they were lauding it as could be used for anything in 1860.

01:24:00.953 --> 01:24:03.294
These are real books.

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:04.274
They're fricking cool.

01:24:04.334 --> 01:24:09.917
And they're less than like $40 on eBay if you don't get there before me, but you didn't.

01:24:10.137 --> 01:24:10.417
I did.

01:24:12.718 --> 01:24:16.680
Virology is also never questioned as a science effectively.

01:24:17.489 --> 01:24:24.155
They put people in place in 2020 to question virology and PCR ineffectively.

01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:35.684
The most egregious examples of these people are like Alex Zeck and Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan, who actually had a book before the pandemic.

01:24:35.785 --> 01:24:42.030
Andrew Kaufman, who had a grant for biometric prison monitoring technology.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.822
These people were all scripted.

01:24:46.383 --> 01:24:51.287
And the most malevolent of that script was the one that didn't question virology in a useful way.

01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:55.652
And therefore, anybody that fell into that trap was never going to get out.

01:24:55.712 --> 01:25:00.516
Just like if you fell into Robert Malone or Peter McCully, you were never really going to get out.

01:25:02.258 --> 01:25:05.221
Because none of them are really questioning this usefully anymore.

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:09.840
And pandemics and gain of function are also a myth.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.242
You can just get that out of your head right now.

01:25:12.723 --> 01:25:13.984
You don't have to worry about it.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:19.528
And these people are fighting very, very hard to make sure that you always worry about it.

01:25:19.588 --> 01:25:22.491
And this guy was weaponized against us.

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:27.335
I think he's pretty innocent, you know, like a guy who's the victim of a Truman Show.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:34.040
Every person that has regular access to this guy is essentially probably playing him at this point.

01:25:34.381 --> 01:25:35.682
It's unfortunate, but true.

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:38.459
or they're duped as he is.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.340
But there's no way for me to see it any other way.

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:54.282
This is the interpretation of reality that I'm passing on to as many people as possible, that America has been run by this two-party national security state theater for a couple decades now.

01:25:56.043 --> 01:26:06.325
And it's not a all-powerful thing, but from the perspective of how America works, it kind of is, because America's fiat currency has enabled

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:14.056
a sort of low level financial control of things that there may be a lot of, you know, uncertainties at a higher level.

01:26:14.096 --> 01:26:26.091
There may be vying for control of different parts of the machinery at a higher level, but at the lowest level where we find ourselves trying to buy a house, there's no, we have nothing.

01:26:27.469 --> 01:26:38.443
and we have no chance of entering that ruling class where you can have multiple homes that are all your private residence or your primary residence and all that shit.

01:26:39.332 --> 01:26:52.143
And so the people that rise into clear view are rising into clear view as part of the National Security Theater, the Star Trek set that we've been tricked into watching as real on social media.

01:26:52.183 --> 01:26:58.729
For goodness sakes, during the Biden administration, they just told you that they were using a set and not actually in the White House.

01:26:58.769 --> 01:27:00.090
They made a fake set.

01:27:00.911 --> 01:27:03.312
And everybody accepted it because, well, you know, it's COVID.

01:27:03.332 --> 01:27:04.353
I mean, that's what we got to do.

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:13.157
And so each side of this national security theater has gone along with an absurdity for a long time.

01:27:13.398 --> 01:27:16.979
And each side thinks the other side has done the same thing.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.243
And so it's more than dangerous where we are now because the

01:27:24.346 --> 01:27:34.028
coordinated script that we've all participated in on social media has convinced us, incorrectly, that we are right.

01:27:34.448 --> 01:27:41.370
And when I say that, I could be talking about the blue team or the red team, and that's the trap you have to see.

01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:49.312
Even if you think your family and friends are lost on the blue team, or you think your family and friends are lost on the red team, you're wrong.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:50.872
You're all lost.

01:27:51.492 --> 01:27:53.273
We are all lost until we

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:08.864
take those hats off and start to realize that up until recently, up until, sorry, up until now, I guess I should just say it that way, up until now, we have not been in control.

01:28:10.549 --> 01:28:13.891
Up until now, we have not been fighting for the right things.

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:23.998
We have been fantasizing about a president that doesn't exist, a dichotomy between Trump is real and Trump isn't.

01:28:24.038 --> 01:28:25.659
Trump is a genius or Trump isn't.

01:28:26.059 --> 01:28:27.180
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.341
is a genius or he's not.

01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:30.883
Those dichotomies are all wrong.

01:28:31.123 --> 01:28:32.404
They're all nonsense.

01:28:33.324 --> 01:28:38.808
It's just like arguing about whether Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Spock is correct.

01:28:41.027 --> 01:28:45.950
Never mind thinking that you might never talk to your parents again because you're sure Spock is right.

01:28:48.811 --> 01:28:51.433
That's where this national security theater got us.

01:28:52.773 --> 01:28:56.035
That's how dangerous of a situation we are in.

01:29:00.818 --> 01:29:01.578
Despite COVID,

01:29:02.659 --> 01:29:05.660
which was a very unfortunate situation for the whole world.

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:06.960
We did a great job with it.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.101
Never got the credit for the job we did.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:18.843
Operation Warp Speed, people say, is one of the greatest achievements ever in politics or in the military, because it was almost a military procedure.

01:29:19.643 --> 01:29:27.525
But everybody, including Putin, said that Operation Warp Speed, what you did with that, nobody can believe it.

01:29:28.706 --> 01:29:30.406
And we did a great job.

01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:35.255
But it was still, it was a horrible, horrible poll over our country.

01:29:35.295 --> 01:29:38.678
We had a very dark cloud over the world.

01:29:38.898 --> 01:29:44.823
That was a very, very bad thing that came out of Wuhan, which I said it came out of Wuhan.

01:29:44.863 --> 01:29:45.804
That's where it came from.

01:29:46.325 --> 01:29:48.587
And China suffered greatly, but everybody did.

01:29:49.127 --> 01:29:52.670
But we, because it was almost a military procedure.

01:29:53.451 --> 01:29:56.714
But every- Can you see it's scripted?

01:29:59.878 --> 01:30:01.901
That's a scripted actor reading a script.

01:30:02.782 --> 01:30:04.564
It was almost a military procedure.

01:30:06.812 --> 01:30:16.196
The right, conservative right, populist movement assembled on social media by Steve Bannon and Steve Hatfill and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:16.236 --> 01:30:26.500
and the fake anti-vax movement of CHD and ICANN and the Brownstone Institute and all these nonsense organizations, they are all on the same script.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.301
They are behind the Donald Trump script as well.

01:30:29.361 --> 01:30:30.841
It's all coordinated script.

01:30:30.861 --> 01:30:31.982
That's why he said that.

01:30:33.615 --> 01:30:37.800
Because there are people on our side that are trying to convince us it was the DOD, remember?

01:30:39.763 --> 01:30:49.555
But remember, what actually is happening is, is that something else has been militarized, and that is the control of thought on social media.

01:30:50.836 --> 01:30:53.637
the scripting of narratives on social media.

01:30:53.697 --> 01:31:04.502
And that has been magnificently controlled by at least two people who used to work for Goldman Sachs, Aaron Siri and Steve Bannon.

01:31:08.624 --> 01:31:15.067
Everybody, including Putin, said that Operation Warp Speed, what you did with that, nobody can believe it.

01:31:16.267 --> 01:31:20.029
And we did a great job, but it was still, it was a horrible,

01:31:21.129 --> 01:31:22.810
Horrible pole over our country.

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:26.212
We had a very dark cloud over the world.

01:31:26.452 --> 01:31:32.376
That was a very, very bad thing that came out of Wuhan, which I said it came out of Wuhan.

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:33.356
That's where it came from.

01:31:33.876 --> 01:31:36.138
And China suffered greatly, but everybody did.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:41.000
But we did a good job with that, as good as you can possibly do.

01:31:41.081 --> 01:31:45.043
And we came back, and now we're stronger than ever before.

01:31:49.145 --> 01:31:50.466
That was a meeting like yesterday.

01:31:53.075 --> 01:32:05.608
And now we're supposed to also believe that we have a director of national intelligence that is saving our democracy by producing social media videos in a seatbelt.

01:32:09.212 --> 01:32:14.478
Dr. Fauci demanded that we place blind faith in him and the government.

01:32:14.938 --> 01:32:15.799
It was about control.

01:32:16.209 --> 01:32:23.852
It was about more money, huge amounts of money, our taxpayer dollars being put directly into the pockets of big pharma.

01:32:23.932 --> 01:32:26.873
You must see this woman as a fraud.

01:32:27.993 --> 01:32:30.434
You must see that you are being set up.

01:32:31.915 --> 01:32:35.156
The other side sees this as a really bad joke.

01:32:36.257 --> 01:32:46.445
The rest of America can see that this is absurd, just like you could see that masking up children was absurd, that forcing masks on people in airplanes was absurd.

01:32:46.905 --> 01:32:49.107
They can see that this is absurd.

01:32:49.527 --> 01:32:51.569
They can see that Donald Trump is absurd.

01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:54.251
They can see that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:32:54.351 --> 01:32:58.054
swinging from chains with his shirt off is absurd.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:33:03.938
They can see that a 70-year-old man who can do pull-ups and push-ups like he does is absurd.

01:33:04.018 --> 01:33:04.779
They can see it.

01:33:07.008 --> 01:33:15.992
just like you can see that the gender spectrum is absurd, just like you can see that transitioning kids at age 14 is absurd, they can see that this is absurd.

01:33:18.653 --> 01:33:35.180
And unless we snap out of it and come together as a country and realize how we've been fragmented, how magnificently visible it is right now, how we've been fragmented, and go to the local pub and have a beer together really quick, get to the bar,

01:33:36.516 --> 01:33:39.979
Take the no smoking sign down, get the cigarettes out again and hang out.

01:33:40.099 --> 01:33:44.603
I don't know, that's probably the worst recommendation I've ever given on my show, but you know what I'm trying to say?

01:33:45.444 --> 01:33:47.646
There's a Dutch word, gezelligheid.

01:33:48.726 --> 01:33:55.987
And it is the conviviality that gets created when two people that know each other really well can spend time together.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:34:06.989
And actually, the best example of what I think in my mind, in my imagination, what chizelikheid is, is when you can sit together with somebody for a long time and not say anything.

01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:12.290
Watching people walk by on the street and then come to the same conclusion of what you're watching.

01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:13.811
Hey, did you see that lady?

01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:14.891
Oh yeah, I was watching her too.

01:34:17.543 --> 01:34:29.835
and know that that person is watching with similar eyes as you, or even better, maybe just know the perspective that that person has because of the history with their mom or the way that they broke up with their last boyfriend.

01:34:31.436 --> 01:34:40.105
And with very few words, you can impart volumes of information over a quiet tea on a street side.

01:34:42.324 --> 01:34:57.967
And that kind of conviviality, that energy that gets created by people that are spending time together, that love one another unconditionally, that kind of energy is almost absent from our lives on social media as they stand right now.

01:34:59.888 --> 01:35:05.309
And it is because of our belief in people like Tulsi Gabbard that got us here.

01:35:07.813 --> 01:35:11.614
I'm not yelling at anybody but myself because I bought into this too.

01:35:11.894 --> 01:35:13.754
I thought something else was happening.

01:35:13.814 --> 01:35:15.835
I thought it had to be one or the other, right?

01:35:18.515 --> 01:35:19.135
It's all of it.

01:35:20.876 --> 01:35:22.196
It's not the Klingons.

01:35:22.396 --> 01:35:23.776
It's not the Federation.

01:35:25.117 --> 01:35:26.577
It's not the Romulans.

01:35:28.057 --> 01:35:30.198
It's not Q and it's not the Borg.

01:35:32.298 --> 01:35:32.998
It's one show.

01:35:34.659 --> 01:35:35.419
It's all one show.

01:35:36.328 --> 01:35:38.629
It doesn't matter what hat you buy or who you cheer for.

01:35:38.649 --> 01:35:41.491
And it certainly doesn't matter what you tweet.

01:35:43.032 --> 01:35:54.879
Now we know Fauci has lied to Congress numerous times, including the lie that the National Institute of Health did not and does not perform or fund gain-of-function research.

01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:02.904
This is a serious one, and it's a crime that Democrats have imprisoned Republicans for, lying under oath before Congress.

01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:17.003
We are not being saved by a Hawaiian surfer lady who's now our Director of National Intelligence and saving us by making videos that are subtitled with a seatbelt on.

01:36:17.043 --> 01:36:18.004
There's no way.

01:36:18.612 --> 01:36:20.614
There's no way, it's not possible.

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.295
There's no way this is real.

01:36:22.736 --> 01:36:24.938
You gotta come to that conclusion right now.

01:36:25.418 --> 01:36:29.402
This woman with that hairdo on Fox News is not real.

01:36:29.802 --> 01:36:32.885
And you've gotta pull yourself out of this illusion right now.

01:36:33.766 --> 01:36:35.487
Alex Jones has never been real.

01:36:35.527 --> 01:36:36.928
Laura Loomer's not real.

01:36:39.851 --> 01:36:42.874
Just like Sasha Latipova's daughter, Soph, is not real.

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:45.791
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:45.852 --> 01:36:55.195
is a victim of all the people that have surrounded him for the last 10 years because, and you can't even really call him a victim because he is an active national security scripted actor.

01:36:56.636 --> 01:36:58.036
There's no other way to explain it.

01:36:58.056 --> 01:36:58.917
He can't be that dumb.

01:36:58.977 --> 01:36:59.957
He knows what he's doing.

01:37:00.317 --> 01:37:02.038
The people around him know what they're doing.

01:37:03.498 --> 01:37:12.542
And that's why they all came around me and all tried to get me to get under that big top tent of health freedom with $105,000 a year and some, you know, passwords and stuff.

01:37:14.551 --> 01:37:23.878
That's why they put my name in that book, because they just hoped, goodness sakes, you know how much money I could be making probably if I would have just said it's a lab leak and this is the best book ever.

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.579
It's a lab leak, lab leak, lab leak.

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:26.500
I wouldn't have made any money.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:36.448
They would have just gone with the narrative, right, that Charles Rixey was the hero, that Alex Washburn figured it out, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:36.488 --> 01:37:37.248
knew it all along.

01:37:37.288 --> 01:37:43.994
And then they would be still right here where they're going to drop us on our head and tell you, oh, whoops, sorry.

01:37:45.066 --> 01:37:47.667
Vaccine injury turns out to be really, really rare.

01:37:52.468 --> 01:37:54.589
It's awful, ladies and gentlemen, where they brought us.

01:37:55.289 --> 01:37:56.069
But we can get out.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.270
I know we can get out.

01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:58.190
I know we can.

01:37:58.210 --> 01:38:04.232
I know we can get out if we just start to see that the American public is governed by national security actors.

01:38:04.272 --> 01:38:10.534
If we can just see that the citizens are being actively divided on false pretenses that don't mesh together.

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:16.609
that the pandemic was the culmination of a long con that at least can be seen to have started around 2015.

01:38:21.598 --> 01:38:28.599
When Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were starting to rise, when ICANN was being formed on paper, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:28.639 --> 01:38:47.083
was being actively recruited to convert from an environmentalist to an anti-vaxxer, when Brian Hooker was recruited in 2013 or 14 to stop saying that autism is a bullshit word and start saying it, that autism is what my son has and it's caused by vaccines.

01:38:47.203 --> 01:38:50.764
And here we are a decade later with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:50.784 --> 01:38:50.864
and

01:38:51.984 --> 01:39:19.362
and his handler, Brian Hooker, telling all the world that vaccines cause autism, without ever trying to be very specific, except for like about a month in 2025, when he said something about, well, you know, we're talking about profound autism, and then tried to describe profound autism as kids that bang their head against the wall and have projectile diarrhea.

01:39:20.879 --> 01:39:23.200
But suddenly that term disappeared again.

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:30.003
I think you can see that might be evidence of him being an improvising scripted actor.

01:39:30.063 --> 01:39:31.543
And that's why they corrected that.

01:39:33.244 --> 01:39:34.565
That went away very fast.

01:39:35.345 --> 01:39:40.727
And now we are less than two weeks from the proposed announcement of what causes autism.

01:39:41.087 --> 01:39:47.610
And they just said it in a, in a staff meeting on camera that I'm going to tell you in a couple of weeks.

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:50.297
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:50.337 --> 01:39:51.818
said they're going to tell you in a couple weeks.

01:39:51.898 --> 01:39:53.559
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a long con.

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.901
The Human Genome Project was never completed.

01:39:57.762 --> 01:40:10.411
The Human Genome Project will not be completed until as many full genomes of human beings are collected along with their entire detailed medical history as possible.

01:40:12.515 --> 01:40:20.682
Otherwise, they have no hope of feeding any useful data into a machine learning algorithm that can give them any useful information out.

01:40:21.763 --> 01:40:28.649
And they have known that since Joshua Lederberg first kind of predicted that this is how we would crack this code.

01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:33.213
We wouldn't just do it, you know, with compasses and rulers and calculators.

01:40:36.294 --> 01:40:39.096
The Human Genome Project hasn't even really started yet.

01:40:39.136 --> 01:40:58.731
They're still doing startup projects and test runs on limited data sets to see if they can, for example, take all the genetic data that they collected from college kids and use a machine learning algorithm to interface that back with the college kids' health records and see if there's some kind of pattern that shows up that allows them to get accurate with that.

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.411
Do they have that database yet?

01:41:01.471 --> 01:41:02.091
Yes, they do.

01:41:02.151 --> 01:41:03.552
Do they have that data set yet?

01:41:03.632 --> 01:41:04.232
Yes, they do.

01:41:04.292 --> 01:41:05.873
Are they running that experiment yet?

01:41:05.953 --> 01:41:06.693
I bet they are.

01:41:09.295 --> 01:41:22.841
And I bet you there were some companies that paid top dollar for those remnants that were produced at all those universities in 2020, 21, 22, and as facilitated by both sides of this ridiculous narrative.

01:41:24.451 --> 01:41:35.743
Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone, Peter McCullough on one side, and Vincent Rackin-Yellow, and Griffin, and Liana Nguyen on this side.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.294
Believed in Donald Trump, had hope.

01:41:47.354 --> 01:41:47.775
I had hope.

01:41:48.439 --> 01:41:49.900
I had hoped that Donald Trump was going to be different.

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:56.242
In fact, you know, he came in and he got rid of all the kind of the censorship of the left, but he replaced it with censorship of the right.

01:41:56.562 --> 01:41:58.922
And now he invented a new protected class.

01:41:59.543 --> 01:42:00.223
They're Zionists.

01:42:00.243 --> 01:42:03.784
He says they're Jews, but they're really just Zionists, that he's the protected class.

01:42:04.324 --> 01:42:07.345
And, you know, he's convicting people for thought crimes over here.

01:42:07.765 --> 01:42:12.287
You know, it's like, hey, hey, can you can you release the Epstein files like you said you were going to?

01:42:12.607 --> 01:42:15.508
No, but I can kick a college student out of out of the country.

01:42:15.948 --> 01:42:17.888
for criticizing Israel in an op-ed.

01:42:17.989 --> 01:42:18.529
How about that?

01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:19.469
Does that work for you?

01:42:19.789 --> 01:42:20.669
So that's where we're at.

01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:21.989
So it's a big disappointment.

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:27.471
I had I had told Chris Hedges that I had hoped that Donald Trump would be better and different and less of a warmonger.

01:42:27.931 --> 01:42:28.771
But I didn't have faith.

01:42:28.911 --> 01:42:29.411
I had hope.

01:42:29.691 --> 01:42:29.871
Right.

01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:30.712
Because I got to have hope.

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:40.894
And but can you feel the once was liberal now, I guess, is a conservative starting to turn on Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.? ?

01:42:41.687 --> 01:42:42.387
Can you feel it?

01:42:42.867 --> 01:42:54.571
Now what I want you to do is imagine if they reveal that the Donald Trump shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, an hour north of my house, supposedly done by a kid that goes to the same high school as my kid.

01:42:55.651 --> 01:42:56.431
Stop lying!

01:42:57.852 --> 01:42:58.572
That was faked.

01:42:59.232 --> 01:43:01.853
What would just hypothetically do that thought experiment?

01:43:01.873 --> 01:43:02.573
What would happen?

01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:07.175
That those hopes are all dashed and it's no matter who you vote for, you get John McCain.

01:43:08.795 --> 01:43:11.216
What do you think happened that day in Butler, Pennsylvania?

01:43:12.813 --> 01:43:14.394
What do you think?

01:43:14.614 --> 01:43:29.004
We've been told this completely unsatisfactory, incomplete verse of events that this skinny kid in a t-shirt just managed to get into a vantage point from which he could take a couple of shots.

01:43:29.144 --> 01:43:33.667
I mean, a man died, but obviously that man was not Donald Trump.

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:38.230
What do you think Donald Trump with his bloodied hand and his bloodied ear, what do you think happened?

01:43:39.634 --> 01:43:43.915
I don't know, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't dismiss anybody's theory about it.

01:43:44.255 --> 01:43:53.597
Anybody's theory, you know, that even to the point of Donald Trump being in on it, I wouldn't dismiss it.

01:43:54.077 --> 01:43:59.038
It's because Donald Trump closing down that investigation is the most suspicious thing in the world.

01:43:59.098 --> 01:44:00.059
That is a tip off.

01:44:00.739 --> 01:44:01.739
It's like it's the equipment.

01:44:01.759 --> 01:44:03.379
So can you imagine it or not?

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:05.520
I can imagine it.

01:44:06.914 --> 01:44:11.738
And it would absolutely ruin the American populace.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.120
It would ruin us.

01:44:16.202 --> 01:44:17.804
Unless we get ahead of it.

01:44:19.766 --> 01:44:21.347
Unless we get ahead of it.

01:44:21.447 --> 01:44:25.030
And the only way to get ahead of it, number one, is to get off of social media.

01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:30.095
And if you're on social media, you need to call out this theater for what it is.

01:44:31.758 --> 01:44:34.800
And you need to call out the Trump administration for what they are.

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.961
And they are not bad guys that are destroying the democracy.

01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:39.922
They are part of a contiguous show.

01:44:41.383 --> 01:44:48.606
Obama, Trump, Biden, Obama, or sorry, Biden, Trump is all one contiguous national security theater.

01:44:49.707 --> 01:44:50.687
Goes back to around 2015.

01:44:53.851 --> 01:44:55.894
and it extends all the way to right now.

01:44:56.055 --> 01:45:01.543
And that's why the Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump debates now look so ridiculous.

01:45:01.644 --> 01:45:05.089
That's why the Bill Maher show from 2017 now sounds so ridiculous.

01:45:09.164 --> 01:45:13.406
because it was an orchestrated, scripted theater.

01:45:13.526 --> 01:45:15.927
And they are still on that script now.

01:45:15.987 --> 01:45:18.348
And this guy is just reading the script.

01:45:18.788 --> 01:45:21.089
He doesn't know where the cruise ship is going.

01:45:21.469 --> 01:45:27.852
He's just agreed to sit in the chair on the USS Enterprise and say the lines in coordination with the other people.

01:45:28.773 --> 01:45:30.033
It's a little bit of improv.

01:45:30.874 --> 01:45:31.874
That's what comedians do.

01:45:33.302 --> 01:45:35.584
equivalent of you can't ask questions about COVID.

01:45:35.684 --> 01:45:36.165
It's like, what?

01:45:36.765 --> 01:45:39.848
We don't get to know the... And so, you know, there's something going on there.

01:45:40.169 --> 01:45:57.145
And... So now what I want you to think about with this next video is that we're gonna roll back time and we're gonna go back to 2020 in September, when a whole nine months of the pandemic has already transpired, where we're already pretty sure that this is a lab leak.

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:19.319
where we're already sure that there's a spike protein, and we're about to roll out the vaccine, especially the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccines, which were orchestrated, scripted to come out first, so that they, as old, obviously doesn't gonna work because Jesse Gelsinger showed us it wouldn't work.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.141
They were gonna be discarded, but they needed to be rolled out and then

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:35.554
you know, the flag raised about, oh, there seems to be some adverse events in the Johnson & Johnson or in the AstraZeneca, and so we better pull that adenovirus vaccine.

01:46:36.095 --> 01:46:38.318
Whew, everybody felt so safe.

01:46:39.719 --> 01:46:40.721
At least they're honest.

01:46:42.964 --> 01:46:44.365
And that was actually scripted.

01:46:44.425 --> 01:46:53.475
They already knew that that technology was inappropriate and old because Robert Malone was already a whistleblower about that with regard to Jesse Gelsinger a decade earlier.

01:46:53.915 --> 01:46:57.118
So that was obviously orchestrated.

01:47:02.163 --> 01:47:05.807
And so what would happen if in September of 2020,

01:47:07.847 --> 01:47:23.103
Brett Weinstein, the son of Les Weinstein, the first intellectual property lawyer ever to serve in the Department of Justice, who just happened to serve in the Department of Justice of John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy, whose son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is now head of HHS.

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:47.120
What would happen if that guy in September of 2020, after already having a member of drastic on his podcast and claiming that this was a lab leaked virus, was also trying to orchestrate a election movement in 2020, in September.

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:53.782
And what if he was promoting somebody like, I don't know, a Hawaiian surfer?

01:47:56.021 --> 01:48:03.906
who would become director of national intelligence for the Trump administration and try to save us by podcasting about Tony Fauci from a seatbelt.

01:48:07.128 --> 01:48:21.458
What if he was doing that with Matt Taibbi and Melissa Chen, the lady who works for the Spectator, who also this Andrew Ngo also works for the Spectator.

01:48:21.478 --> 01:48:24.099
You know, the guy who became famous because of Floyd 19.

01:48:27.932 --> 01:48:30.694
What if that was the people that he was podcasting with?

01:48:30.734 --> 01:48:32.376
Cause that'd be kind of weird, right?

01:48:36.639 --> 01:48:39.081
And it turns out that's who he was actually podcasting with.

01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:47.388
And so he was running this unity movement, the campfire movement, you know, campfire wiki from Matt Crawford.

01:48:47.408 --> 01:48:48.108
It's all the same.

01:48:48.468 --> 01:48:49.949
It's all the same stupid show.

01:48:52.149 --> 01:49:01.252
And it's all the same stupid network of actors who was assembled in 2020, added to through 2020, and that has stuck together, stuck to the script.

01:49:02.113 --> 01:49:04.576
that was supposed to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:04.816 --> 01:49:11.204
and Robert Malone and Jay Bhattacharya and all these people as close as they could to the chairs that they're in right now.

01:49:11.985 --> 01:49:20.335
And Melissa Chen is related to Piper Stover because they're both in some kind of organization together.

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:28.823
Piper Stover claimed to have just sent a $25 suggestion tip to Brett Weinstein.

01:49:28.883 --> 01:49:31.404
And that's what led to Bryant Weinstein calling me.

01:49:31.984 --> 01:49:35.326
And, and yet they are already associated.

01:49:35.386 --> 01:49:42.889
She's probably, Piper Stover is probably one of the people running Melissa Chen, not Melissa Chen being Piper Stover's boss.

01:49:42.929 --> 01:49:43.749
There's just no way.

01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:46.390
That doesn't make any sense at all.

01:49:47.151 --> 01:49:48.131
But that's what I was told.

01:49:49.957 --> 01:50:14.176
And so that's a pretty extraordinary thing to be told, especially if you're told that by somebody who says they have your best interest in mind, and then they never, that same person never got here, never got to the point where Mark Kulak did, where he can show that this woman's father-in-law is like the equivalent of some kind of really big conservative leader in the UK, that she has been

01:50:15.111 --> 01:50:28.935
interacting with the Weinstein brothers for years, interacting with Peterson, interacting with Lindsay and the other guy that elevated Brett Weinstein in 2017.

01:50:31.095 --> 01:50:38.517
This is all one assembly of podcast control grid, actors

01:50:40.396 --> 01:50:45.740
establishing themselves on the internet so that they could be used for this military operation.

01:50:45.801 --> 01:50:48.663
And I don't care how read in they are.

01:50:48.703 --> 01:50:55.288
It could be, for example, that Matt Taibbi is a victim of these two guys' coordinated script.

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:57.090
That would make a lot of sense here.

01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:13.435
I am very pleased to be joined by Melissa Chen, who is the New York editor for The Spectator USA, and Matt Taibbi, who is a reporter at Rolling Stone and can also be found on Substack.

01:51:13.895 --> 01:51:16.136
Melissa and I are big fans of your Substack, Matt.

01:51:16.416 --> 01:51:22.799
And so here we are plugging X or Twitter and Substack already at the be and that is scripted.

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.460
That is scripted.

01:51:26.838 --> 01:51:29.843
I hope people will join it and read and be as delighted as we are with it.

01:51:29.863 --> 01:51:30.965
Thank you.

01:51:31.166 --> 01:51:31.927
Welcome to both of you.

01:51:31.947 --> 01:51:34.532
Thank you for having us on.

01:51:35.623 --> 01:51:39.105
So there's a lot going on in the land of unity at the moment.

01:51:39.185 --> 01:51:40.105
Not all of it good.

01:51:40.405 --> 01:51:41.866
Some of it, however, is excellent.

01:51:42.526 --> 01:51:45.788
This week we held a rank choice vote.

01:51:47.088 --> 01:51:57.593
And so notice they're starting a podcast here, not acknowledging the pandemic in any way, right before the largest wave of murder in America will occur.

01:51:57.633 --> 01:52:00.495
And that's why I have it blocked here so that you can't really see it.

01:52:01.475 --> 01:52:04.679
because that's what this podcast doesn't even, it's right there.

01:52:05.159 --> 01:52:07.562
It looks like the pandemic has ended.

01:52:10.485 --> 01:52:14.129
And right before that, that's what this thing, they don't even talk about it.

01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:15.430
It's not like it's there yet.

01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:23.779
Now thousands of Americans are about to be killed in the next six months by protocols and lack of antibiotics and opioids.

01:52:25.843 --> 01:52:29.806
and we determined which ticket it is that we intend to draft.

01:52:30.046 --> 01:52:35.749
The ticket we settled on is Tulsi Gabbard and Ben Crenshaw.

01:52:41.012 --> 01:52:45.255
Tulsi Gabbard and Ben Crenshaw?

01:52:46.095 --> 01:52:48.277
Is that the guy with the eye patch?

01:52:49.377 --> 01:52:51.859
Because he's also a WEF Young Leader.

01:52:51.939 --> 01:52:53.400
That's really remarkable.

01:52:55.672 --> 01:52:57.473
Really remarkable.

01:53:00.414 --> 01:53:12.180
And we're supposed to believe that he presided over a completely honest and totally fair and objective ranked choice voting that brought those two to the top in September of 2020.

01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:21.493
What is he doing here other than splintering the vote of Donald Trump?

01:53:21.733 --> 01:53:29.436
What is he doing here other than splintering off any independent thinking centrist type people that might watch any of those people?

01:53:29.496 --> 01:53:30.817
You see what's happening here?

01:53:32.058 --> 01:53:32.318
So in

01:53:33.248 --> 01:53:51.533
In 2020, the same people who would say that it was a lab leak, the same people that would tell us that the DNA contamination in the shot is causing cancer, those same people were splitting the vote of Donald Trump in 2020 to try and elect Tulsi Gabbard.

01:53:52.954 --> 01:53:57.095
Now you can say that this guy didn't have an audience, he wasn't watching, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:53:57.555 --> 01:54:00.036
But remember how the election went in 2020.

01:54:02.372 --> 01:54:06.773
Remember how little would need to happen in order for any of those results to occur.

01:54:07.153 --> 01:54:08.674
It's just a matter of confusion.

01:54:08.714 --> 01:54:19.137
It's just a matter of setting certain knobs at certain places and realizing that those knobs were all set at the opposite setting a couple years ago, a year ago.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:26.424
where all of these people went behind Donald Trump, advocated for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:26.464 --> 01:54:37.011
to be the vice president, said that it was imperative that these people that all came together as a dissident movement voted for Donald Trump and accepted that he's playing 5-D chess.

01:54:37.491 --> 01:54:38.892
These are the same people.

01:54:41.212 --> 01:54:42.453
It can't be by accident.

01:54:42.693 --> 01:54:44.255
I'm sorry, my fellow Americans.

01:54:44.315 --> 01:54:45.756
It cannot be by accident.

01:54:45.876 --> 01:54:49.139
Our country has been under attack on social media for some time.

01:54:49.539 --> 01:54:59.467
And the main reasons why we hate our neighbors or discount our neighbors opinions is because we have been too skillfully using social media for too long.

01:55:00.148 --> 01:55:03.630
And we believe things that these actors have led us to believe.

01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:08.995
Like sooner or later, the Borg are going to come and assimilate all of us.

01:55:10.063 --> 01:55:20.068
You can't watch Star Trek with that much commitment, but we watch the social media with that much commitment, and that's why our society is fractured right now.

01:55:21.609 --> 01:55:23.410
So that's a big accomplishment.

01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:24.711
First of all, rank choice voting.

01:55:24.811 --> 01:55:28.353
I don't know if you guys have engaged in any rank choice voting.

01:55:30.427 --> 01:55:31.728
Not going to do that anymore, of course.

01:55:31.968 --> 01:55:33.129
And so I got involved.

01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:39.435
We've got to do work sort of dissonance side of things, because when I saw how they were using PCR and COVID, I realized it was a fraud.

01:55:39.615 --> 01:55:42.598
Like we run PCR on cannabis plants all day long.

01:55:42.618 --> 01:55:44.139
This is our bread and butter.

01:55:44.179 --> 01:55:46.961
We make tests that look for pathogens on cannabis like that.

01:55:47.162 --> 01:55:49.864
PCR is essentially like the no swab test that people are doing.

01:55:49.904 --> 01:55:50.044
Yeah.

01:55:50.084 --> 01:55:52.006
And PCR is actually a really good test.

01:55:52.046 --> 01:55:54.068
They destroy the reputation of PCR and COVID.

01:55:54.497 --> 01:55:56.700
You know, it's it's it was invented by Kerry Mullis.

01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:57.060
Yes.

01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:57.541
Yeah.

01:55:57.821 --> 01:55:58.181
Great book.

01:55:58.221 --> 01:55:58.822
You should read his book.

01:55:59.263 --> 01:56:00.144
I've been wanting to.

01:56:00.244 --> 01:56:01.225
I've watched some interviews with him.

01:56:01.245 --> 01:56:02.306
He seems like a really cool dude.

01:56:02.447 --> 01:56:03.087
He is a surfer.

01:56:03.468 --> 01:56:05.711
He was a surfer, sadly died right before the pandemic.

01:56:05.911 --> 01:56:07.573
But and he hated Fauci.

01:56:07.873 --> 01:56:08.133
Yes.

01:56:08.334 --> 01:56:12.479
I think anyone who's who gets their nose into the space will come to the same conclusion as him.

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.540
Okay, so we stop here for a second.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:24.423
I think the first thing to hear there is that he says PCR for COVID is a fraud, but it destroyed the reputation of PCR in COVID.

01:56:24.443 --> 01:56:25.443
But that would be a lie.

01:56:26.884 --> 01:56:39.208
Just a very simple fact, that's a lie because every hospital in America is using a bank test for up to 18 different viral signals at once.

01:56:40.447 --> 01:56:41.708
Illumina sells one.

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:44.169
There's a bunch of companies that sell these tests.

01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:45.630
They're all run on site now.

01:56:46.591 --> 01:56:54.255
It's a multi-million dollar industry that has produced a new level of DNA remnants that can be collected by whoever needs them.

01:56:54.696 --> 01:56:58.638
And they're going on ad infinitum and everybody believes that they work.

01:56:59.098 --> 01:57:05.002
So there is actually no destroyed reputation of PCR in COVID at all.

01:57:06.163 --> 01:57:07.904
And a lot of that is thanks to him.

01:57:08.769 --> 01:57:16.275
Because since the beginning in 2020, he's been writing papers about how PCR can be used to test for COVID.

01:57:20.358 --> 01:57:22.700
So you can just hear it in the first sentences.

01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.003
He's just talking out of both sides of his head.

01:57:31.271 --> 01:57:32.452
You want me to replay it again?

01:57:32.472 --> 01:57:37.536
I can play it again now that you know the first objection, but I can do it sentence by sentence.

01:57:37.616 --> 01:57:43.940
Unfortunately, if you're in the public, he's elevated us some... We make tests that look for pathogens on cannabis.

01:57:44.541 --> 01:57:47.243
PCR is essentially like the nose swab test that people are doing.

01:57:47.283 --> 01:57:49.384
Yeah, and PCR is actually a really good test.

01:57:49.424 --> 01:57:51.446
They destroy the reputation of PCR in COVID.

01:57:51.963 --> 01:57:54.084
You know, it's it was invented by Kerry Mullis.

01:57:54.204 --> 01:57:54.444
Yes.

01:57:54.724 --> 01:57:54.924
Yeah.

01:57:55.204 --> 01:57:55.584
Great book.

01:57:55.604 --> 01:57:56.225
You should read his book.

01:57:56.885 --> 01:58:00.906
If they destroyed the reputation of PCR, then we wouldn't be using it anymore.

01:58:00.966 --> 01:58:01.987
But we are using it.

01:58:03.267 --> 01:58:08.769
That's a nonsense statement, and he didn't explain anything about what's missing from it.

01:58:08.849 --> 01:58:12.491
So, for example, he didn't tell you that if you have a transcript like this,

01:58:13.522 --> 01:58:27.114
that you could make the choice of putting your primers here and there, or you could put your primers here and there, or you could use all four of these primers and test for both of these amplicons.

01:58:28.246 --> 01:58:32.570
and only call that a positive and call that a better test.

01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:40.817
Or you could take that same transcript and you could put two layers of primers inside of that with nested reactions.

01:58:40.877 --> 01:58:44.160
And that could be nested primers, which would make this even more specific.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:57.908
Or you could take that test and you could just take whatever is amplified and you could sequence it and make sure that the sequence that shows up is the sequence that the test is testing for and that the fluorescence wasn't generated by a false positive.

01:58:58.328 --> 01:59:10.755
And even this rudimentary list of only three ways to make PCR better was not expounded upon or included in any interview this guy has ever done.

01:59:14.332 --> 01:59:19.636
And so he can say all he wants about what he does and why we make tests for cannabis and stuff like that.

01:59:20.036 --> 01:59:26.501
But he's not explaining to you what they did during the pandemic and how those two statements can be true.

01:59:26.541 --> 01:59:29.583
That PCR is really great, but its reputation got ruined.

01:59:29.983 --> 01:59:30.904
Well, how would you do that?

01:59:30.964 --> 01:59:32.625
You would use it incorrectly.

01:59:34.827 --> 01:59:42.092
And you don't use it incorrectly by overcycling it because overcycling will not make primers that aren't specific work.

01:59:45.054 --> 01:59:49.838
If these primers are designed well, overcycling is not going to get you a positive.

01:59:49.898 --> 01:59:58.526
That is the reality that everyone in academia in America and around the Western world knew from the very beginning.

01:59:59.007 --> 02:00:11.378
So if they accepted the TV story, which is that the PCR worked, then their assumption was that there were positive and negative controls, just like I use in my lab.

02:00:13.208 --> 02:00:32.897
And people like Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, Tony Fauci, and Peter Daszak, and Richard E. Bright, and Rick Bright, and Peter Navarro, all these people were scripted to be sure that they would never explain this to you.

02:00:34.039 --> 02:00:38.003
How it could be a magnificent tool for making lots of DNA.

02:00:38.324 --> 02:00:48.514
It could be a magnificent tool for discovering what's in a place that we can't see, but it's a terribly inaccurate tool if it's not applied correctly.

02:00:50.136 --> 02:00:55.502
In triplicate with controls, with nested primers, with multiple amplicons.

02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.911
I've been wanting to.

02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:03.992
I've watched some interviews with him.

02:01:04.012 --> 02:01:05.093
He seems like a really cool dude.

02:01:05.213 --> 02:01:05.854
He is a surfer.

02:01:06.234 --> 02:01:06.955
He was a surfer.

02:01:07.095 --> 02:01:08.497
Sadly died right before the pandemic.

02:01:08.677 --> 02:01:10.359
But, um, and he hated Fauci.

02:01:10.639 --> 02:01:10.920
Yes.

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.264
I think anyone who's, who's, who gets their nose into the space will come to the same conclusion as him.

02:01:16.642 --> 02:01:28.031
So it's, unfortunately, if you're in the public, he's elevated as some almost Jesus level of saint, but if you see what he actually does behind the scenes, he is the exact opposite of that.

02:01:29.352 --> 02:01:45.283
So the pandemic comes along, they're abusing these PCR tools, and I make note of this, I write a paper about it, and of course it gets attacked, it gets- We will discuss that paper after this video, but that paper is the Corman-Jorston report,

02:01:46.164 --> 02:01:59.417
And it is a paper where 10 objections to the WHO PCR test were made by Kevin McKernan and a few scripted actors who are very significant to put into their place in the narrative.

02:02:00.851 --> 02:02:05.395
goes to the typical censorship and ridicule that you expect.

02:02:06.856 --> 02:02:10.939
And shortly after that, I think that caught the attention of Peter McCullough.

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:17.985
He asked me to help write him a paper about the differences between the vaccines and the virus, which I went through all the molecular biology and how those two things differ.

02:02:18.766 --> 02:02:24.371
And after that happened, people start randomly sending me vials of vaccines to our address, our company address.

02:02:24.391 --> 02:02:25.592
What prompted you to first write the paper?

02:02:26.622 --> 02:02:33.668
Um, well, I could tell that since the PCR was a fraud, that when I saw what they were going to do with the vaccine, I'm like, this is, this has not been tested.

02:02:34.168 --> 02:02:35.530
I know how that sausage vaccine.

02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:36.270
Yeah.

02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:39.253
I, the, my history of, um, building DNA.

02:02:39.493 --> 02:02:42.375
I know how that sausage is made.

02:02:43.056 --> 02:02:43.376
Okay.

02:02:43.416 --> 02:02:45.458
That's the admission that you need to hear.

02:02:46.038 --> 02:02:53.665
And he knew how that sausage was made because he dropped out of college and went to work for the human genome project.

02:02:56.093 --> 02:03:00.617
and helped to invent a lot of the technology that makes that sausage.

02:03:01.017 --> 02:03:05.862
That technology was developed by him and his teams.

02:03:06.322 --> 02:03:10.606
He's the research and development director of the Human Genome Project with no PhD.

02:03:11.487 --> 02:03:14.009
Worked under Mark Lander and Francis Collins.

02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:16.171
You know, Francis Collins.

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:23.513
It's not by accident, it's one script and one cast.

02:03:23.694 --> 02:03:29.276
This guy is a very high level clearance dude from the Department of Energy for already two decades.

02:03:30.416 --> 02:03:37.619
Now, sequencers, man, I had a deep respect for when you start changing nucleotide chemistry on RNA molecules, you have no idea what you're doing.

02:03:37.799 --> 02:03:40.220
Okay, he does sequencers.

02:03:44.682 --> 02:03:47.043
And therefore, changing

02:03:48.769 --> 02:03:53.870
methylations can mess things up.

02:03:58.231 --> 02:04:04.013
So already you can see that he's throwing you a red herring because this isn't the reason why it's bad.

02:04:05.313 --> 02:04:08.134
This isn't the reason why transfection is bad.

02:04:08.634 --> 02:04:12.015
It's not because it wasn't tested, which he just said.

02:04:12.947 --> 02:04:13.948
It's been well tested.

02:04:13.988 --> 02:04:21.458
It's been used on the academic bench for a decade or more in many different forms in cell cultures of all kinds.

02:04:22.452 --> 02:04:33.102
and in experimental animal protocols of all kinds to express proteins and knock them down and interfere with them and change the expression of or knock them out.

02:04:34.183 --> 02:04:41.569
And even the creation of knockout mice requires this kind of transfection technology to be used on zygotes.

02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:47.675
So we are talking about a technology that it's well understood, including the limitations of it.

02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:59.460
And yet he is scripted in 2024 right before the election to go on a huge podcast and tell two hours of nonsense like this.

02:05:01.101 --> 02:05:16.088
And I unfortunately am trapped as one of the few people on earth who can debunk this guy because I have personal interaction with him for five years where he tries desperately to get me to accept some of this rudimentary bullshit.

02:05:17.247 --> 02:05:21.148
that unfortunately, because of my training and persistence, I have seen through it.

02:05:23.528 --> 02:05:42.612
They have had so much of a problem with me that at one point in time, I was asked to present to Kevin McKernan, Jessica Rose, Stephanie Seneff, and John Bodewin all at the same time so that they could critique my infectious clones critique of the pandemic and RNA virology.

02:05:43.172 --> 02:05:47.053
And afterward, that guy wrote a substack to say that I'm chemtrail retarded.

02:05:47.594 --> 02:06:10.502
Now, this is a man you need to understand as being one of the planners behind this multi-decade script, this long con, where using a fake pandemic based on background signals being misconstrued as spread, using intellectual property in the form of diagnostic tests,

02:06:12.486 --> 02:06:21.751
could be used to bamboozle our kids to believe that RNA can pandemic, and therefore the next one, they might want to be first in line for a fricking shot, like Bill Maher said.

02:06:21.771 --> 02:06:29.494
And that's what they did in the vaccine, is they changed every single uracil out with pseudouridine.

02:06:29.514 --> 02:06:32.236
And that completely changes the function of that RNA.

02:06:32.576 --> 02:06:34.617
And these guys just said, oh, we're just going to change all of them.

02:06:35.077 --> 02:06:35.817
And then injected.

02:06:35.837 --> 02:06:38.979
And of course, this is a mistake because it's not pseudouridine.

02:06:39.019 --> 02:06:41.140
Pseudouridine is still technically natural.

02:06:42.754 --> 02:06:48.078
It is N1 methyl pseudouridine, which is a analog base.

02:06:48.578 --> 02:06:49.479
It's not natural.

02:06:51.421 --> 02:07:11.856
And they codon optimized it, which means they also changed the way the whatever RNA they purported to have found would be functionally expressed by ribosomes because they changed the wobbling codons to codons that were happier in humans, that are more common in humans.

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:22.589
And so there's so many things that they've done that this guy's not pointing out would lead to potentially a different.

02:07:23.547 --> 02:07:30.134
antigen being present in the body and a different antigen supposedly instructing the immune system.

02:07:30.174 --> 02:07:34.197
And none of those incongruities are being delineated here.

02:07:34.217 --> 02:07:35.799
He's not explaining any of that.

02:07:35.839 --> 02:07:47.030
He's going so short through the corner that it almost seems exactly like what Huberman said, which is, you know, there's RNA and if it wasn't for RNA, you know, we wouldn't be here right now.

02:07:48.444 --> 02:07:49.085
and see what happens.

02:07:49.185 --> 02:07:56.390
And you change that one methyl group in the course of trying to build DNA sequencers, and your whole sequencer will fall apart.

02:07:56.691 --> 02:08:02.355
I mean, the enzymes are that sensitive to a single methyl group being placed on some of these pieces of DNA.

02:08:02.776 --> 02:08:07.740
You put 800 of them on the RNA that you're doing, you are in completely unknown territory.

02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:15.225
with how that RNA is going to fold, how it's going to be processed in the cell, the RNA interference pathways it's going to kick off.

02:08:15.265 --> 02:08:19.408
So when I saw what they're doing, I'm like, this is complete reckless insanity that they're doing.

02:08:19.768 --> 02:08:21.589
And no one's raising their hand.

02:08:22.710 --> 02:08:31.896
Him saying RNA interference pathways is also pretty funny because he's still not telling you that the contamination of fragmented RNA

02:08:32.904 --> 02:08:41.677
that was an inevitable result of using recombinant DNA to manufacture the plasmid that would result in the RNA.

02:08:42.318 --> 02:08:47.045
That whole concept is being omitted here, that there's a whole tale

02:08:48.516 --> 02:09:06.552
of RNA fragments that are much more likely to interfere with random endogenous regulation of RNA and protein expression than any of the full-length RNAs are going to do because they're most likely going to get garbled up into a tertiary form that, you know, does whatever it does.

02:09:06.612 --> 02:09:15.160
But it's less likely to interfere with regulatory ways because it's not short enough and it will have a tertiary structure that won't allow it to bind to

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.382
other RNA transcripts the way that small RNAs will.

02:09:19.783 --> 02:09:33.332
In fact, there's a whole synthetic technique on the academic bench where they use small RNAs to interfere with endogenous RNA expression.

02:09:33.772 --> 02:09:38.295
And so he's also mentioned it, but hasn't mentioned why that's there.

02:09:38.615 --> 02:09:45.040
And again, that is a contamination that he knew would be there from a long, long time ago, because he knows how these

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:55.349
these methodologies work and he knows the limitations of them and why they're good for making protein biologics a lot less good for making a large batch of pure RNA.

02:09:57.811 --> 02:10:00.213
And this guy is behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:10:01.614 --> 02:10:06.819
and so he's part of this malevolent trap that this fake

02:10:08.103 --> 02:10:11.786
populist conservative right trap that we've fallen in.

02:10:11.846 --> 02:10:16.489
He's part of it, a very big part of it, like a high level Department of Energy part of it.

02:10:17.690 --> 02:10:23.414
About it, which is frustrating because you're in a field and you look around and none of your peers are talking about this.

02:10:23.614 --> 02:10:23.894
Right.

02:10:23.994 --> 02:10:25.895
And you're like, is everyone in on this?

02:10:25.935 --> 02:10:26.676
Like, what's going on?

02:10:26.976 --> 02:10:29.358
And being in Massachusetts, pretty much everyone is in on it.

02:10:29.418 --> 02:10:29.998
Pfizer's there.

02:10:30.118 --> 02:10:36.283
It is equivalent to a silent mutation and silent mutations, as you are well aware of, can make drastic changes.

02:10:37.123 --> 02:10:38.504
in the protein function.

02:10:38.544 --> 02:10:43.528
And so again, it's, he's not telling the truth here when he just glosses over that.

02:10:52.774 --> 02:11:01.023
So basically, comparing how sloppy the PCR test would be to measure this, you assumed that they were going to be way off with the vaccine.

02:11:01.303 --> 02:11:02.705
Is that a good way to sum it up?

02:11:02.725 --> 02:11:11.794
Yeah, I can see that there was a game going on here to pump up the pandemic's risk so that there would be a need, a public desire for a vaccine.

02:11:13.336 --> 02:11:21.321
If you actually paid attention to how the PCR was behaving and how they were over calling this disease, you would have barely noticed this pandemic.

02:11:22.141 --> 02:11:26.984
The COVID pandemic that came through was predominantly human induced death.

02:11:27.265 --> 02:11:29.286
It was not that people weren't dying from the virus.

02:11:29.366 --> 02:11:36.651
They're dying from what people's reaction to the virus, like they're putting them on remdesivir, putting them on ventilators, taking away antibiotics, not letting them use ivermectin.

02:11:37.711 --> 02:11:40.312
There was all types of... See, isn't that funny?

02:11:40.332 --> 02:11:42.913
You got to throw in the bullshit in there with the real stuff.

02:11:42.973 --> 02:11:46.134
Not letting him use antibiotics, not letting him use ivermectin.

02:11:46.374 --> 02:11:47.135
Stop lying!

02:11:47.275 --> 02:11:49.736
I mean, that's really awful, but it's real.

02:11:50.896 --> 02:11:51.676
That's where we are.

02:11:51.696 --> 02:11:59.119
He is a scripted theater actor for the National Security State and he fooled a lot of us, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of us.

02:11:59.979 --> 02:12:01.560
So here's what I got to offer you.

02:12:03.057 --> 02:12:28.568
In 2013, in Nature America, in the patent section of the reviews, a paper by the name of Dreaming of Patent-Free Human Genome for Clinical Sequencing was first authored by Kevin McKernan, where he's talking all about the intellectual property of patenting genes in 2013, especially with regard to diagnostics.

02:12:30.478 --> 02:12:38.435
which not just for genetic diseases, but of course also for communicable diseases in cannabis and in people.

02:12:40.512 --> 02:12:49.935
And so this guy is exactly on script in 2013, a couple of years before ICANN would be established, a couple of years before Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:12:49.995 --> 02:13:03.600
would pivot from anti-mercury and fish to anti-mercury and vaccines with the help of Brian Hooker and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland, his handlers, and Robert Malone.

02:13:04.673 --> 02:13:22.597
And at the beginning of 2020, in actually November already, when the first wave of murder was over and the second wave was starting, a curious paper for open review shows up on the internet and it is by the first five authors are all scripted weirdos.

02:13:23.077 --> 02:13:30.979
Peter Borger is a Dutch guy who has a new biology book that doesn't really question the old biology, but kind of does.

02:13:32.416 --> 02:13:35.498
And he, more importantly, has blocked me a long time ago.

02:13:35.979 --> 02:13:41.503
Bobby Rehesh Malhotra was a very weird, interesting actor.

02:13:42.064 --> 02:13:44.966
At some point in the pandemic, he was even promoting my review.

02:13:45.987 --> 02:13:52.072
But now he thinks I'm, I guess, CIA because I sell t-shirts that say New World Order or something like that.

02:13:52.612 --> 02:13:59.835
Mike Eden, of course, you know, is a longtime pharmaceutical executive who knows exactly how protein biologics are made.

02:13:59.875 --> 02:14:18.442
More importantly, he knows exactly how recombinant DNA would be used to make this RNA and how flawed that process would be from the very start, just like his co-author Kevin McKernan would have known, just like his co-author Claire Craig of the 100,000 Genomes Project and now the Heart Organization

02:14:19.022 --> 02:14:22.084
that is also linked to Panda through Jonathan Engler.

02:14:22.104 --> 02:14:29.628
All of these people have been in my direct messaging, texting my phone, some of them texting my wife.

02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:30.629
This is gross.

02:14:31.610 --> 02:14:44.037
The last author on this paper is the lady who provided the cell cultures that Kevin McKernan supposedly sequenced to show that the Pfizer SV40 vaccine, or the SV40 promoter was in the vaccines.

02:14:47.099 --> 02:14:48.640
Like this is, this is frightening.

02:14:49.943 --> 02:14:52.145
This should be so obvious to you now.

02:14:52.586 --> 02:15:07.000
And if you read this, you will see that none of the 10 fatal problems here suggest that PCR can't be used, just like none of the problems with the patenting here suggest that you can't patent a PCR test.

02:15:07.441 --> 02:15:10.824
In fact, this paper makes the argument for how exactly you can.

02:15:11.584 --> 02:15:16.967
patent a PCR test for a genetic disease or a infectious disease.

02:15:17.327 --> 02:15:37.138
And now here's the guy whose friend and family and colleagues are all right in position to do it, right in position to control the narrative, who in frickin' April of, maybe even March of 2020, was on a podcast called the Vance Crowe Podcast, a guy who used to work for the World Bank,

02:15:38.018 --> 02:15:47.146
talking about how PCR in America is being held back because the FDA is in the way and the EUAs require 10 pages of useless paperwork.

02:15:49.148 --> 02:16:03.200
It is impossible that Kevin McKernan is where he is saying what he's saying on podcasts then and now unless the entire thing was an orchestrated long con theater

02:16:04.164 --> 02:16:08.106
from Trump 1 through Biden through Trump 2.

02:16:08.846 --> 02:16:17.950
And the way we aren't seeing it is because there's still people who think that this was a flip from red to blue to red again.

02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:18.810
And it wasn't.

02:16:22.332 --> 02:16:24.893
Ladies and gentlemen, endemicity is a myth.

02:16:25.708 --> 02:16:31.050
that everybody from Ralph Baric to Kevin McKernan has been scripted for decades to make us believe.

02:16:31.570 --> 02:16:41.254
Everything from Hollywood movies to X-File episodes have been scripted to make us believe that endemicity is real, both as a process and as an endpoint, and it is not.

02:16:41.794 --> 02:16:47.996
Just like using PCR with a pair of primers on this background is not a specific test.

02:16:48.496 --> 02:16:54.659
Just like using their PCR test to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster.

02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:56.264
It makes you a fraud.

02:16:57.645 --> 02:16:59.526
It's murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

02:16:59.546 --> 02:17:00.487
That's what you gotta see.

02:17:00.547 --> 02:17:03.189
It's murder and lies because it's for grandchildren of earth.

02:17:03.269 --> 02:17:10.694
I don't know how long I'm gonna have to keep saying this because these shows are starting to become so sharp, they stand on their own.

02:17:10.734 --> 02:17:14.077
I might just be able to leave them and move on to the biology.

02:17:14.117 --> 02:17:14.857
Wouldn't that be great?

02:17:15.478 --> 02:17:19.921
Just give me a few more weeks to get the book complete and ready to go.

02:17:19.981 --> 02:17:22.643
And then the first little thing will be released.

02:17:22.703 --> 02:17:24.284
I'm really excited, ladies and gentlemen.

02:17:24.864 --> 02:17:26.986
It is a hamster wheel.

02:17:29.656 --> 02:17:30.537
I mean, you got to see it.

02:17:30.577 --> 02:17:33.600
We have people saying, thank God for Donald Trump.

02:17:33.620 --> 02:17:35.241
He's the answer to our prayers.

02:17:35.802 --> 02:17:44.470
We have people on our side who say that they've been fighting the vaccine schedule for 25 years because God told them to.

02:17:45.250 --> 02:17:55.340
We have people on our side who are lying about the creator and their ability to communicate with him or get answers from him.

02:17:57.702 --> 02:17:59.623
Alex Jones is on this side.

02:18:01.524 --> 02:18:04.485
Sasha Latupova's daughter, Soph, is on this side.

02:18:05.346 --> 02:18:07.207
There's no way this is real.

02:18:07.807 --> 02:18:10.808
And of course, the spectrum of gender is absurd.

02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:17.451
Of course, transitioning kids at 14 with puberty blockers is absurd.

02:18:17.471 --> 02:18:22.794
Of course, Donald Trump isn't a genius.

02:18:25.754 --> 02:18:27.696
I know you can see through it, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:27.916 --> 02:18:29.837
I know our children can see through it.

02:18:29.957 --> 02:18:31.939
I know we're going to get out of this.

02:18:32.099 --> 02:18:32.880
I just know it.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:33.881
I just know it.

02:18:34.121 --> 02:18:34.601
I know.

02:18:34.621 --> 02:18:36.042
I feel it.

02:18:36.162 --> 02:18:37.584
I feel there's going to be a break.

02:18:38.424 --> 02:18:41.587
I feel like this National Security Theater is about to end.

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:46.591
I feel like that our work on PeerTube is really paying off.

02:18:46.671 --> 02:18:50.114
I think everybody is finding it enjoyable, so if you haven't tried it yet,

02:18:51.044 --> 02:18:51.664
Take the leap.

02:18:51.724 --> 02:18:54.345
You can always delete the app if it doesn't work on your phone.

02:18:54.365 --> 02:18:56.486
You can always delete it if you think I'm full of bull.

02:18:56.926 --> 02:19:08.531
But try to get far enough to where you got GigaOM on your phone and played one stream or watched one so you can see how well it works and how easy it works and how free it works and how anonymously it works.

02:19:08.951 --> 02:19:10.112
Thank you very much for being here.

02:19:55.615 --> 02:19:55.755
you.
