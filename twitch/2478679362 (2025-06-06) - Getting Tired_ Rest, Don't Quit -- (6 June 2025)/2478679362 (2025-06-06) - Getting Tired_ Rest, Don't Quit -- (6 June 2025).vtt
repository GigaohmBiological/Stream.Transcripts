WEBVTT

00:15.339 --> 00:18.461
Testing one, two, gonna get these levels right here.

00:19.421 --> 00:20.942
And then we're gonna start.

00:21.002 --> 00:28.186
Make sure you realize, ladies and gentlemen, this is a message coming to you live from the United States of America out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:29.007 --> 00:30.468
The United States needs help.

00:31.188 --> 00:34.730
We are currently being undermined from within by a Trojan horse.

00:35.651 --> 00:41.634
There are a number of foreigners and also Americans who are aligned with foreign interests who have currently

00:42.466 --> 00:50.634
infiltrated the American government and are posing as a MAGA movement or a MAHA movement, but it's actually, it's much worse than that.

00:50.774 --> 01:04.667
It is a social media-based scripted bullshit takeover of American discourse by American and foreign bullshitters that are programmed to rise in prominence and

01:05.268 --> 01:27.948
And that is done by the careful orchestration of their accounts on social media, careful orchestration of very prominent censorship and demonetization, which has now resulted in an awful lot of people that needed to see Bret Weinstein or the Rubin Report or any of these other fake newscasters, podcasts on the internet,

01:29.029 --> 01:30.571
that are all scripted bullshit.

01:30.631 --> 01:37.638
They are scripted bullshitters, and they aren't much different than... They're not much different than these scripted bullshitters.

01:37.878 --> 01:40.240
It's all... Yes, that's right, Jessica.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.682
It's all the same scripted bullshit.

01:43.343 --> 01:53.472
And one of the people that I think has written this script or helped with fine-tuning it as it went off the rails is Kevin McKernan, formerly of the Human Genome Project.

01:54.654 --> 02:08.511
I think it is extremely important also to see that these guys, all three of them, are scripted bullshitters that were told that they would have a good chance of being put into a position of extraordinary power

02:09.494 --> 02:36.614
in America, and they were told that, I think, by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and a number of other people that are operating behind this health freedom movement that has taken any grassroots effort to try and oppose public health as a new form of totalitarianism and scripted it into a false conservative movement that these people laugh at because they are effectively now

02:37.334 --> 02:38.075
at the top of it.

02:38.495 --> 02:41.518
Two of the three of these guys are at the top of the FDA.

02:43.119 --> 02:48.824
The very organization that before they were there, they kind of agreed that, you know, maybe the USA would be better without.

02:51.812 --> 03:02.717
And so this guy was also pulling this same, we would be better off without the FDA with a scripted bullshitter by the name of Vinay, or sorry, Vinay and this is Vivek.

03:03.417 --> 03:12.041
And this is just one big Trojan horse that's not really, I can't quite put a finger on it, but it's not Russian and it's not Chinese.

03:13.141 --> 03:19.827
And I'm not noticing a lot of Hmong people involved in this, but there's some other pattern I just have yet to recognize.

03:21.729 --> 03:29.757
And what I know for sure, though, the pattern that I recognized a long time ago is that there is a script of bullshit about biology.

03:30.277 --> 03:38.525
And I think I've traced the authors of that script back to Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, although I'm sure there are other people behind the scenes that we haven't seen yet.

03:39.325 --> 03:48.048
Steve Bannon is one of the guys who I think is also at the head of coordinating this longtime intellectual property expert, former Goldman Sachs guy.

03:48.068 --> 03:56.651
He pretends to be pro-China, but that doesn't really make sense in light of his staunch Catholicism.

03:56.771 --> 04:06.494
But his pro-India thing makes a lot of sense because there is a small but not insignificant portion of Indians that are actually Catholic.

04:07.534 --> 04:09.615
He promoted Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

04:09.675 --> 04:23.018
as vice president for a long time, considers Tony Lyons a genius, and Tony Lyons, of course, helped Jesse Ventura put out his biography, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, in 2008, where in the epilogue, it was implied that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

04:23.078 --> 04:27.879
running as an independent could join up with somebody like Jesse Ventura and win the White House.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.920
Too bad Jesse Ventura would then get shot.

04:30.905 --> 04:35.889
What an interesting anecdotal story to have as the epilogue of a book by Tony Lyons.

04:35.909 --> 04:41.814
Yes, Sky Horse Publishing that would go on to become the publishing arm of Children's Health Defense.

04:41.894 --> 04:47.058
Two books by Andrew Wakefield, the hero slash international agent.

04:49.991 --> 05:00.054
You know, the same guy that gets promoted by all these people, including ICANN and Aaron Seary, a lawyer who supposedly is doing God's work after working for Goldman Sachs.

05:00.714 --> 05:04.615
So then we have Brett Weinstein, whose father, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

05:04.595 --> 05:11.097
's father, is intimately involved in the updating of the FDA in the 60s around the thalidomide scandal in Denmark.

05:12.793 --> 05:24.860
I have connections to Brett Weinstein, not because I was a big fan of his, not because my former member of Drastic colleague, Uri Dagan, was on his show in 2020.

05:25.201 --> 05:28.383
I wasn't even aware of that until long afterward.

05:29.178 --> 05:38.511
But actually, because I was hooked up with him by somebody by the name of Piper Stover who convinced me to write a review that was never really good enough to put out.

05:39.052 --> 05:44.720
It took us like five weeks to pass her, you know, scrutiny and get it ready to go.

05:44.820 --> 05:45.641
And that was May.

05:47.103 --> 06:01.839
2021, you know, right before Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and Bret Weinstein would do their infamous podcast that would lead to the demonetization of Bret Weinstein and his near total evolutionary collapse into poverty.

06:04.304 --> 06:17.369
So yeah, I don't know what to say other than to say that this guy is also an intellectual property expert, also was out against the FDA, also saying the FDA was in the way, also saying that these EUAs are just 10 pages of useless paperwork.

06:17.509 --> 06:30.875
Also, really, the most extraordinary thing is that he worked on the Human Genome Project as not as a slouch, but as one of the central developers of the robotics that allowed the first fake completion to be faked.

06:31.920 --> 06:37.803
It's not a fake completion, but what they call a completion is really just a series of restriction enzyme maps over a couple three genomes.

06:38.204 --> 06:41.686
And let's call it a day if half of these landmarks seem to overlap.

06:41.726 --> 06:42.186
And they did.

06:42.246 --> 06:44.948
So then they stopped there and said, hey, congratulations, we're done.

06:45.388 --> 06:46.689
And now they're still doing these.

06:47.489 --> 07:04.140
you know pejorative not pejorative perfunctory uh wow that's weird how words come uh perfunctory you know oh we did another thing we hit a leather landmark we had leather everything the only thing they've really done is created infinitely cheaper ways to perform the same trick

07:05.031 --> 07:07.132
And it's not even really that good of a trick.

07:07.753 --> 07:15.998
And the more that I've come to understand the limitations of their tricks, it's remarkable how just no one else seems to be able to figure it out.

07:16.158 --> 07:17.619
And I think that's all by design.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.623
So the first and foremost, you know, person on this list, I think really is Robert Malone.

07:22.683 --> 07:34.411
And Robert Malone ties together so many threads from, you know, Mickey Willis and Judy Mikovits and chronic fatigue syndrome.

07:36.092 --> 07:48.186
and Robert Gallo and Murray Gardner's lab, all the way to the first year or so of the development of the Lab Leak Scooby-Doo narrative with Ryan Cole and Lee Min-Yan tour in the world.

07:48.567 --> 07:52.792
And of course, if he was on stage with Lee Min-Yan in 2021 with

07:54.413 --> 08:15.494
with Ryan Cole and Li Min Yan first came out as a dissident to the Communist Party with Bannon in January of 2020, just a few days before he decided to declare it was a lab leak, then that's either a striking coincidence or just a step in a narrative, a step in a performance.

08:20.188 --> 08:21.910
I think it was just a step in a performance.

08:21.970 --> 08:36.582
And I really, I really believe that we have been tricked into a very, very malevolent position in our, in our minds, because first and foremost, the green line here, everybody in America and around the world believes that Trump's was shot except for me.

08:37.603 --> 08:43.167
And that's a very big problem because I don't think he was, I really think that's a mistake to assume that he was.

08:43.828 --> 08:48.432
And I have a lot of personal reasons to believe that that's a huge mistake.

08:51.772 --> 09:06.830
The first and foremost being that my son goes to the same high school that supposedly this Matthew Crooks went to and after 365 and many more days, we still don't know anything about this kid or who recruited him or why he was on that rooftop in the first place.

09:09.775 --> 09:13.757
We don't know anything about the surgeon who apparently fixed Donald Trump's ear.

09:13.817 --> 09:18.038
We don't know anything about how that photograph of the bullet was actually taken.

09:18.078 --> 09:27.422
We don't know anything about multiple shooters and why all these people for more than three weeks after the shooting were doing podcasts about multiple shooters.

09:27.482 --> 09:35.985
And all of those people who were doing those podcasts were the same people who were responsible for us to get us to solve this mystery lab leak.

09:37.026 --> 09:37.926
Brett Weinstein,

09:40.215 --> 09:50.619
Chris Martinson, this John Cullen character who used to work for Oracle, you know, the company that makes all the databases for all of the major, the major bureaucracies in government?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.500
The one that everybody bitches about?

09:57.542 --> 10:00.683
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:00.723 --> 10:02.283
is supposed to feel like a win.

10:02.784 --> 10:05.505
It's supposed to, you know, quell the masses.

10:05.585 --> 10:08.906
It's supposed to make us think like, now everything's gonna be okay, and it's not.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.965
Because this is exactly where they wanted us.

10:13.686 --> 10:16.129
More importantly, you need to see that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:16.189 --> 10:16.869
is powerless.

10:18.551 --> 10:25.697
The only thing he does when he goes on camera now is say thank you to Donald Trump and tell you how much he's grateful that God brought him Donald Trump.

10:28.019 --> 10:31.523
And now we have an Egyptian, UK citizen,

10:33.075 --> 10:34.916
Marty Makary at the head of the FDA.

10:34.956 --> 10:46.665
We have another Indian kid who supposedly is a medical and scientific genius at the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research pushing gene therapy.

10:47.545 --> 10:48.486
Sell it to me, baby.

10:50.421 --> 10:56.262
And of course, they can throw out all kinds of big terms in the FDA meeting because he was a cancer researcher for a long time.

10:56.302 --> 10:58.903
He knows all these T cell abbreviations.

10:58.943 --> 11:02.644
He knows all these weird chemotherapies and all these.

11:03.064 --> 11:09.025
He's got new ways to look at trial data, like the iceberg plot and stuff like that.

11:09.065 --> 11:13.126
I mean, this is some seriously high level bullshittery.

11:14.076 --> 11:31.452
being pulled off by Vinay Prasad, one of the real awful examples of what's being done to America, how positions of power are being given to people who should be obvious traitors, obvious infiltrators, obvious fakes.

11:33.001 --> 11:51.124
And instead, what's remarkable about Vinay Prasad is that America's conservative people on the internet were tricked into arguing about two white kids, you know, Casey and Callie Means, and whether they were Manchurian candidates for getting to be in the ear of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:51.144 --> 11:55.625
And now they're putting her at, you know, what is that position called again?

11:55.805 --> 11:59.706
Oh yeah, that's right, Surgeon General, all kinds of power there.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.739
Meanwhile, we have a foreigner at the head of FDA.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.240
Foreigners.

12:13.142 --> 12:21.845
I don't think you can underestimate how dire the situation is in America because the Trump administration itself was the Trojan horse.

12:22.426 --> 12:26.807
Just like the Biden administration was a Trojan horse behind Joe Biden.

12:27.248 --> 12:30.489
This is a Trojan horse behind Donald Trump.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.568
How else do you explain his chief of staff?

12:34.632 --> 12:36.619
How else do you explain his foreign policy?

12:39.073 --> 12:46.880
You gotta realize what's happening in America and you gotta come to the conclusion that your media in your country is not telling you the truth.

12:47.580 --> 12:56.488
America is being controlled, demolished from the inside, and we need help around the world for people to understand that that's what's going on.

12:56.528 --> 12:58.549
It's not just Donald Trump.

12:59.130 --> 13:06.556
It is a continual destruction of our country for the last 25 years and more, if you count the pre-planning.

13:10.083 --> 13:22.093
And in the meantime, you all around the world, including, I mean, any country that experienced COVID has accepted PCR as a standard diagnostic for not just COVID, but for anything.

13:22.933 --> 13:29.138
You've accepted sequencing as a way of high fidelity, measuring a background signal, which is really wrong.

13:30.339 --> 13:34.803
You've also accepted intramuscular injection as proven beyond question as a methodology.

13:34.843 --> 13:35.904
That's also wrong.

13:37.005 --> 13:41.409
You've also accepted that obviously RNA has huge military potential.

13:41.449 --> 13:42.409
That's also wrong.

13:48.975 --> 13:52.118
Solving health problems in America will definitely be complicated.

13:52.178 --> 13:55.881
I can kind of agree with that, but it's only complicated because they made it that way.

13:56.241 --> 13:57.842
And I don't know what to tell you.

13:59.531 --> 14:01.471
Oops, I don't like the word autism.

14:02.372 --> 14:03.412
He was vaccine damaged.

14:03.772 --> 14:08.633
He was neurologically damaged, a condition that we will not call autism.

14:08.793 --> 14:10.333
I don't like the word autism.

14:11.213 --> 14:12.273
He was vaccine damaged.

14:12.633 --> 14:17.474
He was neurologically damaged, a condition that we will not call autism.

14:17.654 --> 14:19.195
I don't like the word autism.

14:20.095 --> 14:22.835
He was vaccine damaged.

14:22.975 --> 14:27.076
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

14:27.708 --> 14:31.210
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.510
But this one is pretty cool.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.592
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

14:36.332 --> 14:39.594
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

14:40.194 --> 14:42.655
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

14:42.695 --> 14:47.678
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

14:47.978 --> 14:50.419
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

14:50.439 --> 14:52.320
A lot of impossible things are going to happen.

14:53.925 --> 14:56.748
a condition in condition that we will not call autism.

14:56.908 --> 14:58.449
I don't like the word autism.

14:59.110 --> 15:00.391
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

15:00.751 --> 15:05.636
He was neurologically damaged, but condition and condition that we will not call autism.

15:05.776 --> 15:07.318
I don't like the word autism.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.239
Um, he was vaccine damage.

15:09.259 --> 15:15.165
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

15:16.974 --> 15:17.694
And I have lied.

15:17.714 --> 15:18.754
I'm sure I'll lie again.

15:18.774 --> 15:21.535
I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar.

15:21.635 --> 15:22.675
I try not to be a liar.

15:22.695 --> 15:23.556
I don't want to be a liar.

15:24.116 --> 15:26.877
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

15:32.458 --> 15:36.319
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

15:38.149 --> 15:38.870
And I have lied.

15:38.890 --> 15:39.931
I'm sure I'll lie again.

15:39.951 --> 15:40.871
I don't want to lie.

15:40.891 --> 15:42.713
I don't think I'm a liar.

15:42.813 --> 15:43.854
I try not to be a liar.

15:43.874 --> 15:44.734
I don't want to be a liar.

15:45.295 --> 15:48.017
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.821
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

15:58.841 --> 16:00.881
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:00.901 --> 16:03.042
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.183
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:05.203 --> 16:07.243
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:07.263 --> 16:09.604
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:09.624 --> 16:11.825
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.306
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:14.326 --> 16:16.566
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:16.586 --> 16:18.707
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.028
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

16:21.048 --> 16:21.408
I'm afraid that

16:22.628 --> 16:22.968
concerned.

16:22.988 --> 16:31.515
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

16:35.378 --> 16:40.983
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

16:41.664 --> 16:53.851
you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, and okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because, you know, not that many people die from it.

16:54.151 --> 16:56.132
It's just a big hassle in the end.

16:56.753 --> 16:58.154
But no one

16:59.249 --> 17:12.457
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

17:12.497 --> 17:15.019
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.035
Thank you very much for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.

17:22.055 --> 17:27.458
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

17:27.518 --> 17:29.099
I will see you in a couple minutes.

17:29.159 --> 17:30.020
Thanks for joining me.

17:53.069 --> 17:54.270
I don't care how you get there.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.953
I don't care what you do to get there.

17:56.973 --> 17:59.616
The goal is to win.

18:11.949 --> 18:14.092
It's definitely game time, ladies and gentlemen.

18:14.112 --> 18:16.675
We're not messing around anymore at Giga Home Biological.

18:16.695 --> 18:21.962
We got more to say than we got time to say it, and so we're trying to be as efficient as possible around here.

18:23.223 --> 18:27.929
I know that you have a lot to do every day, and I know there's not enough time to do it, so I know that...

18:28.530 --> 18:36.936
Producing two hours a day five days a week is already kind of overloading a lot of people But unfortunately, I don't think there's any other way forward.

18:37.776 --> 18:58.050
I will try to Repeat a lot of the things that need repeating one of the ways that you can stay focused on the biology not take their bait on social media and Love your neighbors to get off social media because your neighbors aren't there That's the only non-compliance that really matters, especially as we set an example for our children

18:58.750 --> 19:01.332
Brian, Brian, Brian, I get it, I get it.

19:01.472 --> 19:03.033
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a myth.

19:03.054 --> 19:12.361
It's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

19:27.652 --> 19:29.133
Oh man, there he is again.

19:29.153 --> 19:35.736
Yeah, and I think that really you have to see pandemics and gain of function as those same kinds of myths.

19:36.156 --> 19:38.697
They keep things behind the curtain.

19:39.558 --> 19:44.720
And those that are aware are part of the trap and they're happy to be part of the ruling class.

19:45.400 --> 19:51.003
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, you are already enslaved.

19:51.263 --> 19:52.384
That's for darn sure.

19:52.904 --> 19:56.006
Gigaohm Biological is the biology that they ignore.

19:56.967 --> 20:00.469
If you want to send something to the house, there is an address up there.

20:01.029 --> 20:06.293
If you want to leave a voicemail that I could play online or even answer live, you could call that number.

20:07.594 --> 20:17.400
And yes, this is June 6, 2025, Gigaohm Biological coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.642
This is a message for America and the world.

20:21.363 --> 20:27.245
I consider myself an American, and more importantly, this is an American-centered stream because my kids live in America.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.627
That's the dirt that I live on.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.528
Stay focused on the biology, don't take their bait, and love your neighbor.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.069
That's the way out of the wave.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.471
And again, I said, my name is Jay Cooey.

20:38.531 --> 20:44.293
And you can find some stain of my academic career on the Library of Medicine's website, PubMed.

20:44.573 --> 20:49.454
You can also see my original YouTube channel, JC on a Bike, on YouTube.

20:49.494 --> 20:53.315
I'm trying to kind of stay away from it now because it's kind of a historical document.

20:53.935 --> 21:00.377
One of the coolest channels, I think, out there that you can't really stream to anymore because if they crash it, they crash it.

21:00.397 --> 21:05.699
You can also find some of my ideas represented in a substack called Woodhouse 76.

21:07.379 --> 21:13.167
And also, you can find some of my ideas in the Wuhan cover-up book.

21:14.372 --> 21:20.773
And yeah, I used to be BBQ Buddies with the head of NIH, so I got a lot of connections that don't do me any good, but that's alright.

21:21.713 --> 21:26.074
Because I've got also some subscribers and some supporters that keep this thing afloat.

21:26.835 --> 21:30.135
And I've got a lot of people sharing the work, and that's how new people find it.

21:30.255 --> 21:33.016
So, if you can't support, please share.

21:33.296 --> 21:38.157
And if you're not supporting but could, maybe consider it by going to GigaOMBiological.com.

21:39.637 --> 21:42.519
And at GetGoingBiological.com, there's a lot of links.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.282
One of the most important ones is there on the far right called Stuff.

21:47.023 --> 21:49.925
You can also find that link, Stuff, on the bottom of the page.

21:50.185 --> 21:56.490
As we start to upload textbook chapters and other things, they will all be there under the Stuff link.

21:56.530 --> 22:02.834
Right now, the most important link on the Stuff link is that McKinsey report on population.

22:04.396 --> 22:25.235
And if you sign up to be an Omi, you will just be adding yourself to a list that we're kind of using, but not really So don't don't think there's gonna be a lot of stuff coming in the mail or something like that if you sign up for that And then of course, there's Housatonicits.com Can't recommend his work enough and I certainly can't recommend enough that you start scrolling on his website

22:25.876 --> 22:33.436
the research tab because there you can get lost in a chain of mentors that I think is responsible for the trap we're in.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.462
And I want to advocate for more people like me and Mark.

22:37.843 --> 22:42.607
More people like Joe Marshall of the Liberty Perspective.

22:43.547 --> 22:45.869
People that are just one man or one woman shows.

22:46.870 --> 22:49.372
No editors.

22:50.113 --> 22:51.594
No social media managers.

22:52.234 --> 22:53.215
No sponsors.

22:54.076 --> 22:58.179
Just grassroots people sending in cash to a P.O.

22:58.219 --> 22:58.539
box.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.941
That's basically how this works.

23:00.521 --> 23:06.567
Whereas the internet is actually composed of a team of performers that are all on the same script.

23:06.587 --> 23:08.128
I'm going to start that over again.

23:10.250 --> 23:14.795
And that same script is a fake script, but because they work together, it's very convincing.

23:14.815 --> 23:19.699
You don't have to think of the internet and the show that they put on as just this one guy.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.926
who's chalking his hands up and pretending to stop the train.

23:24.766 --> 23:37.994
But you gotta think of it as hundreds of dudes, hundreds of girls, hundreds of boys, all kinds of performers, doing all kinds of different miming, memeing, miming, what do you call that when you pretend to do something?

23:38.034 --> 23:40.536
Miming the way that they're starting that train.

23:41.914 --> 23:45.537
And that's how they got this pandemic to happen.

23:45.597 --> 23:49.501
And a lot of the people that I have on this screen are just on this screen because I know them.

23:50.402 --> 23:51.423
I know them personally.

23:51.463 --> 23:52.363
I've shaken their hand.

23:52.423 --> 23:53.965
I've taken selfies with them.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.546
And I know them to be liars.

23:55.626 --> 23:57.788
So that's why they're on this screen.

23:57.808 --> 24:04.214
The people at the top of this are people, some of whom I think are quite good, but just completely

24:07.674 --> 24:10.296
They're completely trapped by the people underneath them.

24:10.356 --> 24:14.380
And only a fraction of these people need to be in on a portion or the whole script.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.884
The rest of them can just be naive and think and trust in the rest of them.

24:19.424 --> 24:29.854
Unfortunately, each one of these people has personally not passed the smell test in one way or another after repeated attempts to interact with them.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.996
Some of the worst people on this picture have

24:33.803 --> 24:39.444
you know, so much irrelevance to American discourse, it's actually comical.

24:39.484 --> 24:47.486
I mean, how much time I wasted with Jessica Hockett or with John Bodewin on the Steve Kirsch steering committee.

24:48.747 --> 24:51.647
This guy almost ran away from me when I tried to take a picture of him.

24:51.687 --> 24:57.149
And then when I put my arms around him, I was kind of... Anyway, these...

24:58.867 --> 25:03.751
These people are, the ones that know are monsters and the ones that don't know are idiots.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.473
And they're dangerous idiots.

25:06.553 --> 25:09.074
That's the part that's most frustrating right now.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.736
I think Thomas Binder's a good guy.

25:10.756 --> 25:18.201
I think Sukrit Bhakti has probably been put under too much pressure that he'll do whatever he's told now, including tell everybody that

25:18.741 --> 25:25.228
Now that RNA can't pandemic is a settled discussion, thanks to Jonathan Cooey, we should stop talking about it.

25:26.089 --> 25:41.624
I think Mike Eden is a problem, though, and later on in the second part of the show, I'm going to briefly open an old video of his with Paul Alexander and himself on my show and see if we see something a little differently than we did a couple years ago.

25:42.585 --> 25:46.028
I'm very excited to be here today because I think they've really screwed up.

25:46.629 --> 25:50.012
I think that they've made some serious, serious mistakes.

25:50.072 --> 25:57.598
And one of the biggest mistakes they made is scripting this clown right here, this guy named Kevin McCairn, worst case scenario.

25:58.859 --> 26:06.906
He was scripted with very specific people, which is also incredibly damning for his role in this whole charade.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.049
He's connected to George Webb and a couple of clowns like,

26:10.669 --> 26:21.898
like really serious clowns, like Paul Cattrell, who is all but criminal evidence as long as he's alive, same as this guy is basically criminal evidence as long as he's alive.

26:22.358 --> 26:27.142
These people have been paid for five years to lie about how people died.

26:29.524 --> 26:38.551
And these people have been paid for years or given book contracts to lie about how people died, especially lying about how people died in America.

26:39.568 --> 26:45.010
Because there was, by definition, less murder and more negligence in other countries.

26:45.090 --> 26:47.811
But in America, there was a lot of murder.

26:49.732 --> 26:53.933
And these people were scripted to make sure that we would never figure it out.

26:54.453 --> 26:58.275
Especially this- It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

26:58.315 --> 26:59.695
This absolute buffoon.

26:59.715 --> 27:03.677
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

27:03.837 --> 27:06.718
Who was recruited, in my humble opinion, because of me.

27:08.001 --> 27:13.486
He claimed to have some neuroscience connections that we shared.

27:14.046 --> 27:17.709
He worked with some guy that I was working with at the University of Pittsburgh.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.431
And I saw your bike rides.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.093
You should come on this stream with me and a couple other dudes.

27:22.133 --> 27:25.316
We're really leading the way of solving the puzzle here.

27:26.724 --> 27:28.646
And for five weeks in a row, I did that.

27:29.266 --> 27:43.237
Wasted hours of my time getting drawn in to this idea that there is some network of people that's bucking the system, despite the best efforts of the censorship around the world, and they're getting away with telling the truth.

27:43.898 --> 27:45.719
Some of them are in this group drastic.

27:45.779 --> 27:48.822
Some of them are online, like this guy, apparently.

27:51.312 --> 28:11.203
of course one of the the biggest giveaways of all this stunt was the idea that he was calling Mark Bailey's wife Sam Bailey a whore for more than a year and using a meme of her as a whore with hot dogs in her mouth to celebrate donations on his stream and then in 2022 this man with

28:14.125 --> 28:34.181
big big morals decided to do a live stream with Kevin McCairn and debate specifically the existence of viruses whatever those are with the lack of precision and and strict use of of language that is just absolutely gross if you can find that video and watch it it's just gross

28:35.387 --> 28:40.372
These are absolute traitors to all the children of earth.

28:40.492 --> 28:43.195
That's how bad Mark Bailey is.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.237
That's how bad Andrew Kaufman is.

28:45.298 --> 28:46.959
That's how bad Tom Cowan is.

28:47.340 --> 28:50.003
And that is certainly how bad Kevin McCarron is.

28:51.624 --> 28:55.869
They are on par with Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone.

28:57.515 --> 29:06.560
just joined later just played a dumber role a a role with more oh so what kind of kind of possibilities

29:10.874 --> 29:13.015
I mean, I am mad about it, don't get me wrong.

29:13.275 --> 29:17.616
I think anybody that experienced what I experienced with these people would be mad.

29:17.676 --> 29:29.439
Anybody that was having memes of shotguns in their mouth on the internet, suggesting that I might kill myself this year, I would guess you'd be mad too.

29:29.679 --> 29:31.740
Or maybe not, maybe you're cool with it.

29:32.810 --> 29:39.913
Maybe you're cool with Steve Kirsch offering to send you to Japan to work with that asshole, but I'm not cool with it.

29:40.573 --> 29:48.576
Maybe you're cool with this guy trying to get me to argue with Andrew Kaufman in 2024 after my red pill meeting, but I'm not cool with it.

29:49.716 --> 30:02.081
Maybe you're okay with somebody, these people coming to your house over the course of five years from Piper Stover to Charles Rixey to Alexander, Paul Alexander to Kevin McCarran, but I'm not.

30:03.971 --> 30:10.576
because the clip that you guys saw- This was a scripted team of bullshitters.

30:11.776 --> 30:21.443
Because in 2021, there is a podcast where they confront each other on consecutive podcasts of this street MD jackass.

30:22.644 --> 30:26.287
And they treat each other with a lot of respect and they walk around very carefully.

30:26.327 --> 30:32.491
It's almost as if Andy Kaufman is on a script provided by Robert Malone.

30:33.851 --> 30:39.575
probably was on rumble, I don't think you guys saw tell you clinically it's flu.

30:40.176 --> 30:48.342
People making this just misdiagnosis of i it's a very different cl X ray and C. T. Patterns

30:49.843 --> 30:56.027
The thrombotic aspect of the illness, the laboratory pattern, it's distinct from influenza.

30:56.428 --> 30:58.369
SARS-CoV-2 is a real virus.

30:58.729 --> 31:06.975
I don't know if you guys are familiar with Dr. Tom Cowan, Stefan Lanka, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, but these are three medical doctors that are talking about this kind of stuff.

31:07.335 --> 31:13.939
And they argue, why can't we isolate the virus through a density gradient centrifuge versus the way they're doing it now?

31:13.959 --> 31:16.741
Because they're putting all this other stuff in there, allowing it to decay.

31:17.222 --> 31:18.943
And I think Stefan Lanka was able to

31:19.903 --> 31:22.925
isolate something that looks like COVID with yeast.

31:23.806 --> 31:26.848
Now I'm just gonna throw something out there while we're on this little thing here.

31:26.908 --> 31:28.969
I thought this is probably a good enough place to put it in.

31:29.009 --> 31:29.790
I'll just do it here.

31:30.951 --> 31:31.771
Can I do this?

31:32.231 --> 31:35.273
Did that work?

31:36.034 --> 31:37.255
Yes, hello, hello.

31:37.275 --> 31:41.958
I want to show you something and you know what, maybe I'm just gonna

31:42.472 --> 31:46.434
I'm going to get rid of that screen inset.

31:47.735 --> 31:49.576
Okay, so I'm going to go down here on the floor.

31:49.596 --> 31:50.557
I got two books over here.

31:50.597 --> 31:51.257
Hold on one second.

31:52.959 --> 31:54.039
Got to release this wire.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.541
Otherwise, I'm going to pull these things out of my ear.

31:59.122 --> 31:59.403
Come on.

32:00.143 --> 32:00.343
What?

32:04.666 --> 32:05.947
What is going on there?

32:07.888 --> 32:08.168
Okay.

32:09.429 --> 32:12.751
So what I wanted to do is just show you a thing.

32:14.891 --> 32:27.757
This is Fields Virology, Volume 1, and down there by the basketball, trying to do my best impression of the weatherman, that's Volume 2 right there, see?

32:28.217 --> 32:37.882
And then I also have Fields Volume 4, other editions of the same thing, so I can check how things have progressed and how they've represented things.

32:38.462 --> 32:38.622
Now,

32:39.796 --> 32:46.040
You might be aware that I've been working on my understanding of bacteriophages.

32:46.100 --> 32:50.563
I got here, for example, sitting on an unopened copy of Nature.

32:52.604 --> 33:03.210
This is from 19th of May, 2016, and it is the Anatomy of the Bacteriophage T4 Genome Injecting Machine.

33:04.711 --> 33:05.912
Very exciting episode.

33:05.952 --> 33:08.674
And I, of course, have been working on a number of homework books.

33:11.735 --> 33:14.339
This one is one of my recent favorite homework books.

33:14.559 --> 33:18.346
It's called Genetic Recombination, Thinking About It in Phage and Fungi.

33:18.386 --> 33:20.429
This one's got some really interesting stuff in it.

33:21.281 --> 33:24.042
And I've also got like other books.

33:24.422 --> 33:32.364
One that just arrived recently is actually not about the T4 bacteriophage, but it's about the Lambda bacteriophage.

33:32.404 --> 33:38.146
It's so cool because it's like the bacteriophage Lambda and it's this whole thick book.

33:38.546 --> 33:39.686
And this book was written

33:41.937 --> 33:42.898
edited by A.D.

33:42.958 --> 33:50.281
Hershey, the genetics research unit at the Carnegie Institution, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in 1971, one year before I was born.

33:50.401 --> 33:51.942
So that's pretty exciting.

33:52.862 --> 33:57.605
This is a book about a single kind of bacteriophage called Lambda.

33:58.785 --> 33:59.325
You got that?

34:01.326 --> 34:02.587
Look at how big the book is.

34:03.447 --> 34:03.968
See the book?

34:04.568 --> 34:05.388
See how big it is?

34:06.169 --> 34:08.570
Big book, all about one bacteriophage.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.111
One type of bacteriophage.

34:12.916 --> 34:21.120
So, if I look at Fields Virology, Volume 1, and I look in the index for lambda phages, oh boy, let's see.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.041
What chapter is that going to be?

34:23.841 --> 34:25.662
Where would they put that chapter, I wonder?

34:25.762 --> 34:26.062
Hmm.

34:26.902 --> 34:32.385
M. Lambda is an A. Lambs.

34:32.605 --> 34:33.065
Lambs.

34:33.245 --> 34:33.785
Oh, lambs.

34:34.085 --> 34:34.666
Lambda.

34:35.446 --> 34:36.366
Lambda.

34:36.466 --> 34:36.827
Lambda.

34:36.867 --> 34:37.167
Lambda.

34:37.207 --> 34:37.507
Lambda.

34:37.547 --> 34:37.867
Lambda.

34:37.907 --> 34:38.207
Lambda.

34:38.667 --> 34:38.867
Lambda.

34:39.148 --> 34:39.468
Lambda.

34:40.328 --> 34:40.668
Lambda.

34:41.909 --> 34:42.069
What?

34:52.206 --> 34:55.269
There it is, ha almost missed it there.

34:55.329 --> 34:57.450
This is uh, let's go over here.

34:57.571 --> 34:58.051
Does that work?

34:59.692 --> 34:59.852
What?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.814
Oh, yeah over here.

35:03.315 --> 35:04.196
I See it right here.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.417
You go down Lambo aid phages 679 to 679 to 680.

35:05.457 --> 35:05.557
Okay.

35:05.577 --> 35:07.559
So just remember the point I'm trying to make here is

35:19.019 --> 35:33.849
The point I'm trying to make here is there's a book from 1971 called, it just got the lambda on the front, and it's called Bacteriophage Lambda, and the book is of significant report.

35:34.089 --> 35:40.414
It is more than 700 pages long.

35:40.574 --> 35:44.216
770 pages where the reference start there.

35:44.736 --> 35:46.117
Like, look what I'm talking about.

35:46.157 --> 35:47.218
There's a lot of stuff.

35:48.792 --> 35:58.798
A lot of research was done, and apparently all this research that's in this book can now be summarized in between 679 and 680.

35:59.498 --> 36:00.519
Oh, wow.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.081
That's interesting.

36:05.102 --> 36:07.043
679, here's natural recombination.

36:07.203 --> 36:09.344
Lamdoid phages are a good example.

36:10.164 --> 36:10.685
Here we go.

36:10.705 --> 36:15.267
Oh, there's the end of the chapter already.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.028
Holy shit, what?

36:17.335 --> 36:23.357
So it looks like, to me, it's like three columns in a textbook now.

36:23.437 --> 36:36.062
What was a 700-page book in 1971 has become a, I mean, look, right?

36:36.182 --> 36:41.924
It's less than a full page in this book, but it used to be this book, where I'm looking at the wrong camera.

36:41.944 --> 36:43.385
Can you think about that for a second?

36:44.298 --> 36:45.119
What's happening there?

36:45.499 --> 36:47.581
Because there's a whole other volume of this.

36:48.182 --> 36:49.423
It doesn't have anything on it.

36:49.884 --> 36:52.386
But in 1971, there was a book this big.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.629
And that's just one bacteriophage.

36:58.232 --> 37:06.160
Nature has the sequence of another bacteriophage, the T4 bacteriophage, on the front of cover when they finally sequenced it.

37:07.338 --> 37:08.199
Isn't that weird?

37:08.579 --> 37:11.643
How there's just so much information, but we don't need it.

37:11.683 --> 37:12.504
Who cares?

37:13.264 --> 37:18.790
All these people were interested in bacteriophages for so long and then suddenly it's like, you know what?

37:18.971 --> 37:19.391
Screw it.

37:19.431 --> 37:21.473
Let's write a great big book.

37:22.174 --> 37:24.517
There's not even a fricking chapter about them.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.322
Fields virology.

37:33.644 --> 37:43.103
Okay, so we were talking about virology ineptly with a couple people that were ineptly discussing virology.

37:44.241 --> 37:45.222
on the same script.

37:45.302 --> 37:47.824
So that's what I'm accusing these people of doing.

37:48.384 --> 38:10.280
They are on a script provided by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone, and they are ineptly arguing about the antiquated or uncontrolled or misinterpreted ways that viruses can or can't be isolated without even coming anywhere near the range of saying that RNA can't do that.

38:11.713 --> 38:17.318
Not anywhere near the range of saying, because there are no viruses, that means vaccines are murder.

38:19.380 --> 38:24.424
Not getting anywhere near saying that if there are no viruses, that means that everything in COVID is murder.

38:25.666 --> 38:32.512
But instead staying very focused on not being, you know, I respect my colleagues, but, you know, I beg to disagree.

38:32.552 --> 38:33.653
They're just not doing it.

38:35.558 --> 38:40.160
It is an absolute malevolent shitshow that you see happening here.

38:40.220 --> 38:43.761
And I can't stress enough how malevolent it is.

38:48.103 --> 38:49.023
So I'm gonna let it go now.

38:50.243 --> 38:52.844
So that's a big thing that people have been talking about.

38:53.004 --> 38:59.827
If they're producing something that has virus-like characteristics from yeast, it's likely to be a budded form or an exosome.

39:00.635 --> 39:05.917
In terms of density gradient, you need a lot of virus to pull a density gradient.

39:06.597 --> 39:10.159
And the way that's typically done is you culture.

39:10.199 --> 39:11.419
You need a lot of virus.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.461
You only need trace amounts of virus to sequence.

39:15.521 --> 39:19.422
We have nanopore sequencing now where we don't even have to amplify.

39:19.462 --> 39:21.823
We can just throw everything through the nanopore.

39:21.883 --> 39:29.646
So if you have even a fraction of a tiny bit of a signal there, you don't need to be able to see it show up.

39:30.882 --> 39:37.886
You just need to be able to separate that fraction out of the Sucrose gradient and then sequence whatever is found in there.

39:39.407 --> 39:47.172
This is complete bullshit with Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough on board with Robert Malone

39:49.093 --> 40:02.117
in the same year that they were also touring around in churches with Lee Min Yan and some Karmadoc lady in the audience asking questions about self-amplifying RNA like two and a half years early.

40:06.308 --> 40:11.494
for a long period of time, often in roller bottles, collect very small volumes of fluid.

40:12.295 --> 40:23.868
You may pass it through a filtration system to further concentrate the virus and then put it on your gradient, whether it's a step gradient or a continuous gradient, and pull the band.

40:24.449 --> 40:26.089
That requires a heck of a lot.

40:26.229 --> 40:28.010
Why is Ryan Cole nodding?

40:28.090 --> 40:30.571
He doesn't know how to isolate viruses.

40:30.611 --> 40:35.652
He doesn't have a centrifuge in his diagnostic laboratory for skin cancer.

40:35.692 --> 40:37.892
What is he nodding like that for?

40:39.873 --> 40:43.374
Maybe he's been coached to nod up and down because why?

40:43.974 --> 40:47.655
Because it's part of the neurolinguistic programming of having three on one.

40:52.222 --> 40:54.444
It creates an illusion of consensus.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.087
A lot of virus.

40:57.147 --> 41:01.952
That is absolutely not how you isolate a primary variance.

41:02.092 --> 41:09.820
You know, the blog that, uh, the sub stack that Jay Bhattacharya started with a Canadian kid called illusion of consensus.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.060
Yeah.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.962
That that's the term I'm talking about.

41:12.002 --> 41:12.263
Yes.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.504
He stole that from me.

41:14.505 --> 41:15.266
They all did.

41:17.529 --> 41:26.474
It's not that I made up the term is the one who's using it, the one who is using it the best to describe them and what they are doing, what they are engaged in.

41:26.594 --> 41:38.980
And also very, very succinctly describing that in this scenario, it wouldn't necessarily have to be that Ryan Cole is in on it if Peter and Robert are in on it.

41:39.600 --> 41:52.433
just the same way it doesn't have to be that Peter knows that maybe Ryan and Robert Malone have already been on a boat together for a week a couple times planning this all out and rehearsing it so that they can fool Peter.

41:54.715 --> 42:02.103
Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that any of these guys are good guys but I'm going to tell you that you have to assume they're all bad guys until they start waking up.

42:03.476 --> 42:20.703
just like I woke up and apologized for having failed to see that it was an op in 2021, and that I was being played by Piper Stover, that I was being played by Brett Weinstein, and therefore did not save my friends and family from this PSYOP, but actually kicked them into it.

42:23.944 --> 42:27.806
And every one of these people should have already gotten there by now, holy shit.

42:29.906 --> 42:30.347
sample.

42:30.807 --> 42:40.999
The reason why you have to do it in the presence of the drugs is because you have the problem of contamination with mycoplasma, bacteria, et cetera, from primary clinical samples.

42:41.499 --> 42:49.669
And so that is the primary reason why, of course, on top of the fact that there would be bacteriophages in any sample you took in a clinic.

42:51.092 --> 43:03.663
An irreducibly complex background of genetic signals is present in every clinical sample, and these horrible PCR tests were never designed to amplify a signal on that background.

43:04.263 --> 43:07.526
They were designed to amplify a signal present in distilled water.

43:07.606 --> 43:08.047
That's it.

43:09.244 --> 43:23.340
And they were designed to be a high fidelity instrument in the presence of distilled water controls or genetic controls that were also pure in distilled water, not clinical samples.

43:25.188 --> 43:51.390
I cannot stress enough to you how the PCR test being ignored by both Robert Malone and Peter McCullough and Ryan Cole and also Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman and Mark Bailey is part of the show because instead of demolishing the detection of the COVID, they are demolishing the isolation, purification and culturing of it.

43:53.107 --> 43:54.828
See that for what it is.

43:54.949 --> 43:56.350
That is the trap.

43:57.010 --> 43:59.492
Because it sounds like they're dunking on those guys.

43:59.572 --> 44:01.193
Wow, that's amazing.

44:01.534 --> 44:08.319
But they're all just ignoring the fact that none of that matters when they're using PCR en masse to describe it.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.265
They seem to be woefully unaware that the illusion is not being sustained by isolating the virus.

44:16.325 --> 44:18.107
The illusion is not being sustained.

44:19.471 --> 44:26.296
by sequencing a pure form of a virus from a sucrose gradient from every patient.

44:27.096 --> 44:33.121
The illusion was being sustained by PCR as a useful diagnostic, and it still is.

44:34.878 --> 44:45.008
You have to impose stringent criteria that will keep those things from overgrowing the cell layer while you're trying to grow out the virus and passage it.

44:45.548 --> 44:49.031
I don't wish to cast shade on my fellow colleagues.

44:49.652 --> 44:51.093
I don't know what their background is.

44:52.154 --> 44:57.537
But these are classic virology isolation methods and techniques.

44:57.557 --> 45:00.019
There's nothing idiosyncratic here.

45:02.180 --> 45:04.942
I don't want to cast shade on my colleagues.

45:05.122 --> 45:05.742
I don't know.

45:05.822 --> 45:08.064
Their background is a lie.

45:12.146 --> 45:13.066
He scripted them.

45:14.247 --> 45:15.428
That's why you say that.

45:17.011 --> 45:20.094
to isolate a virus by density gradient.

45:20.114 --> 45:28.361
You're basically, you would require somebody to be incredibly virulent, just shedding very, very large amounts of virus.

45:29.062 --> 45:30.944
Why does Ryan Cole think that's funny?

45:31.684 --> 45:36.549
You would have to be, have somebody who's incredibly virulent, shedding a lot of virus.

45:39.371 --> 45:39.972
Is that funny?

45:41.613 --> 45:43.355
Incredibly virulent, that's really funny.

45:45.117 --> 45:48.320
at the start of the pandemic, you know, when everybody's being murdered in hospitals.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.543
That's pretty funny when he's already done 150,000 COVID tests.

45:52.504 --> 45:54.445
How much money a test there, Ryan?

45:55.346 --> 45:55.626
Hmm.

45:56.167 --> 45:59.430
And you would have to have a body fluid that has that large amount of virus.

46:00.089 --> 46:01.871
And even then, I don't think it'd be possible.

46:22.765 --> 46:26.368
And it's a bunch of liberal women, some of whom are supported by the wellness company.

46:26.408 --> 46:27.889
Who works for the wellness company?

46:27.909 --> 46:37.976
The wellness company is very bad was something that I was told at the CHD inaugural conference by Matt Crawford and by, by, by Ryan Cole and Robert Malone.

46:42.700 --> 46:45.882
Don't underestimate how bad we got them.

46:47.003 --> 46:49.265
Don't underestimate how overextended they are.

46:50.529 --> 46:54.754
It could even be that they are woefully unaware themselves at how much we have them.

46:55.936 --> 46:57.197
How exposed they are.

46:58.038 --> 46:59.961
How pathetic they look at this point.

47:00.682 --> 47:01.823
But see it for what it is.

47:01.863 --> 47:04.246
These are all spectacular failures.

47:04.507 --> 47:05.007
It's one...

47:06.035 --> 47:07.816
failed operation that moment.

47:08.257 --> 47:12.240
Dr. Kaufman, how would you have responded to what Dr. Malone said at that point?

47:12.800 --> 47:28.313
Well, let me start off by saying that, you know, creating the appearance of a scary, deadly virus is a major tool in the toolbook of the, you know, globalist empire, like the people behind the World Economic Forum and

47:29.171 --> 47:31.392
agenda 2030 and other things like that.

47:31.833 --> 47:32.253
I see.

47:32.393 --> 47:38.156
So, so would they, would they, would they orchestrate something or would they just lie about it?

47:39.537 --> 47:54.786
You see, that's the part about this that is extraordinary because he wants you to believe that a multi-billion dollar multinational movement to try and enslave the planet is just going to make up shit.

47:56.152 --> 48:12.416
that they're not gonna kill anybody, that they wouldn't use an existing anticipated rise in all-cause mortality for something a little more useful, that they wouldn't take advantage of that and tell us a story, but it's just that these people are killing us.

48:13.404 --> 48:15.186
You see how it is?

48:15.306 --> 48:19.589
It's really the same basic narrative that Sasha Latupova would tell you.

48:19.609 --> 48:25.815
You don't stand a chance if your military and the militaries around the world are poisoning people to kill them.

48:25.855 --> 48:27.296
Then you don't stand a chance.

48:29.758 --> 48:30.739
That's what she wants.

48:30.819 --> 48:31.760
That's what they all want.

48:31.800 --> 48:39.367
They want you to think that the only thing you can do is go to Stella Emanuel's website and buy her bottle of anti-spike protein therapies.

48:40.657 --> 48:49.023
They want you to go to his website and buy his colloidal silver, or pay $1,500 for a consultation.

48:51.284 --> 49:02.612
They want there to be an alternative health network that is a free-for-all on American society, that undermines our faith in our government and our society as a whole, and distrust in our neighbor.

49:05.051 --> 49:25.243
Otherwise he would be very, very honest about what he knows about Robert Malone and how obvious it is that Robert Malone can't be a dissident and why it's a joke that the guy who is connected to Murray Gardner and thought that we should, we would probably have geneticists in a hospital, in every hospital curing childhood diseases with retroviruses in 10 years after his postdoc.

49:26.183 --> 49:32.327
But instead he's gonna treat him with respect and stick to the narrative that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan gave him.

49:33.200 --> 49:49.140
about culturing a virus or isolating a virus or controls for isolating a virus, instead of going to the literature and reading papers and finding out that virology as it stands right now is transfection and transformation in cell culture, full stop.

49:50.100 --> 49:53.081
They never do culture these viruses.

49:53.121 --> 49:59.443
So if they know that, then why don't they take the logical step of teaching people that how do they get around that problem?

49:59.483 --> 50:09.885
They get around that problem using standard manufacturing techniques for recombinant DNA and RNA, and then they transfect cell cultures in animals and call that virology.

50:10.005 --> 50:18.908
And in five years of fighting this narrative, this traitor has never made any progress from the bullshit that you are gonna hear right here.

50:19.488 --> 50:19.989
which is from 2021.

50:22.391 --> 50:35.163
So they wanna make sure that even the people who maybe think it was been exaggerated or that they're concerned with health freedom, that they never spread this truth that- Concerned with health freedom?

50:35.983 --> 50:39.547
What about concerned about the vaccine schedule being criminal?

50:41.067 --> 50:46.449
I thought there were a couple organizations before the pandemic that thought that the vaccine schedule was criminal.

50:46.909 --> 50:47.630
I guess not.

50:48.250 --> 50:51.411
I guess they're, they're interested in health freedom.

50:51.511 --> 51:04.356
According to the scripted trader, Andy Kaufman, the guy who was applying for grants to build biometric devices, to monitor prison populations in New York state before the pandemic.

51:04.676 --> 51:06.117
And I have photos to prove it.

51:07.796 --> 51:15.518
there are no disease-causing viruses, because then they won't be able to run this program again with the next scary, you know, pandemic.

51:15.578 --> 51:26.082
So he has no clue, then, that if there are no infectious viruses, then the 72 shots on the American schedule for kids is a war crime.

51:27.022 --> 51:29.523
It is a humanitarian crisis.

51:30.896 --> 51:45.372
but as a doctor and an outspoken critic of psychiatry, apparently he's not smart enough to get there because he's so fricking focused on culturing and isolation and promoting the foyers of Christine Massey.

51:47.776 --> 51:54.198
They're never going to get there to say that if there are no infectious viruses, then what the who can't pull their show anymore?

51:54.718 --> 52:04.762
No, if there are no infectious viruses, then we have been injecting children in America in a way that's not done in any other country in the world for decades.

52:05.162 --> 52:06.362
And it's all false.

52:06.502 --> 52:08.163
And this guy doesn't give a shit.

52:10.944 --> 52:11.564
Situation.

52:12.884 --> 52:27.144
But also like it's important, so none of these responses really, either they responded with something that was just simply not true, like that the virus has been purified, that Dr. Malone said, that's simply not true.

52:28.678 --> 52:51.333
Or they divert away from the actual subject and part of that is because you you didn't really ask Well a constructed question if you believed what you say you believed you would be angry upset and energized Not calm cool and retarded This man is so fake and

52:52.588 --> 52:57.350
He's like an android and the reason why is because he's reading a script.

52:58.030 --> 53:04.472
Because he is a trained psychiatrist and he thinks he's clever enough to do it in a way which will be more effective.

53:05.933 --> 53:07.433
That's how diluted he is.

53:07.493 --> 53:14.876
He is an agent on a script with coaching and he's trying to follow the coaching as you see it right now.

53:18.358 --> 53:21.740
Like you didn't really know what dr. Lanka did in his experiment.

53:21.780 --> 53:45.054
So you described something that they didn't understand correctly like what he did is he ran the virus isolation experiment without a virus and Produced cytopathic effects, which is the proof of the virus's presence in the body fluid so how can you get the same result if there's no virus if the virus is the cause of the result that the result is the proof of a virus and

53:45.314 --> 53:57.822
So the question that's obvious here then is how is it that we have a field called virology with multiple volume books about virology if there are no viruses?

53:58.903 --> 54:04.867
And the answer to that question is virology is transfection and transformation in cell culture and in animals.

54:05.347 --> 54:11.231
And this scripted liar will never tell you that because he is on the same script as Robert Malone.

54:14.451 --> 54:28.214
So, you know, the question would be, hey, by those standard isolation procedures that you described, can you- That originated in the early 1900s for the discovery of bacteriophages.

54:29.294 --> 54:30.374
I shit you not.

54:31.814 --> 54:35.055
Plaque assays are for bacteriophages, my friend.

54:36.815 --> 54:39.516
Explain how that proves there's a virus in the person.

54:40.390 --> 54:43.993
Or can you address why they don't do control experiments?

54:44.413 --> 54:48.276
Isn't a control experiment a necessary part of a scientific experiment?

54:50.030 --> 54:52.651
But then he just, the answers kind of led.

54:53.012 --> 54:55.113
So first of all, the leading answer was.

54:55.953 --> 55:08.399
Are we really to believe that he doesn't understand that they produce the synthetic DNA sequence that they call the virus in a pure form and then apply it to a cell culture and start there?

55:08.519 --> 55:14.702
Is he going to actually pretend that he's unaware that any viral sample that has been supplied by

55:15.222 --> 55:27.991
by Ralph Baric to somebody else is a pure recombinant clone of a sequence that they cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot isolate in whole in the wild to this day.

55:30.572 --> 55:39.659
Are we really gonna believe that he doesn't know that so he can't explain it, but he's stuck in this little tiny hamster wheel of limited understanding and it's just not his fault?

55:40.279 --> 55:41.640
He can't read those papers.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.761
He can't get that far.

55:42.841 --> 55:44.282
His degree doesn't cover that.

55:46.741 --> 55:48.382
Of course, it's well established.

55:48.562 --> 55:50.643
Yes, I believe there are viruses.

55:51.103 --> 55:52.564
I believe this virus is real.

55:53.145 --> 56:00.749
Now, that doesn't mean anything scientifically, right, because we can point to people who think they're real and people who don't think they're real.

56:01.349 --> 56:02.670
It's meaningless.

56:02.750 --> 56:07.433
It's giving away your opinion to someone else or just saying, this is my opinion.

56:07.473 --> 56:09.934
I just stated outright, but I have nothing to back it up.

56:10.683 --> 56:13.124
Now with Dr. McCullough, he gave clinical evidence.

56:13.784 --> 56:19.485
So he said he thinks people have a different pattern of disease with the flu this year compared to other years.

56:19.645 --> 56:35.230
So this doctor is not able to get to the point where he's like, if people thought that and they acted stupidly because the CDC said, if you can't ventilate people to stop spread, at least if their pulse ox is low, give them supplementary oxygen and that that

56:36.070 --> 56:49.917
In the literature of medicine for the last 20 years, including critical care medicine, you know, where people like Pierre Cory worked, that giving people supplementary oxygen, high flow supplementary pure oxygen leads to ARDS.

56:49.937 --> 56:51.017
There are monkey studies.

56:52.278 --> 57:04.504
Maybe this psychiatrist isn't sophisticated enough to know that murder in hospitals could be that simple because once you have the acceptance of a viral syndrome for which antibiotics would be inappropriate,

57:05.464 --> 57:24.529
and you tell everybody that what they're seeing is a viral syndrome, he couldn't figure out that that might result in a lot of murder or negligent murder or manslaughter, but instead is still very carefully, soothingly speaking this stuff about culturing and control experiments.

57:24.589 --> 57:27.509
And I really think that my colleague is just not being honest.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.470
Respiratory acute syndrome.

57:30.216 --> 57:32.577
But he didn't, that doesn't mean anything.

57:32.617 --> 57:34.238
It doesn't tell you what causing it.

57:34.318 --> 57:36.800
So let's say he did notice something different clinically.

57:37.740 --> 57:41.283
How do you know that's not a different flu virus if you believe in flu viruses?

57:41.723 --> 57:44.264
How do you know it's not a different toxin?

57:44.284 --> 57:48.267
Maybe a new food trend, maybe a new plastic used in consumer goods.

57:48.347 --> 57:52.449
There's no way to know what causes it by observing what you see clinically.

57:53.230 --> 57:57.052
So that's not an argument that you can speak to this issue.

57:58.109 --> 58:04.370
Now, what Dr. Malone said there at the end about there's not enough material.

58:05.051 --> 58:06.731
So he knows who Dr. Malone is.

58:08.871 --> 58:16.573
What Dr. Malone said, I don't know if I would remember his name if it wasn't still on the screen and I'd never seen him before.

58:18.013 --> 58:18.893
But he's got notes.

58:19.534 --> 58:20.994
What Dr. Malone said about

58:22.318 --> 58:23.239
It's a script, guys.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.262
It's a script, and we fell for it.

58:27.964 --> 58:32.409
America fell for this, and effectively this was a giant Trojan horse.

58:32.449 --> 58:39.616
We all got sucked into this argument, and only the people who had bad questions were in this argument or found these people.

58:40.157 --> 58:43.600
And then we all got behind this weird movement in America called

58:44.261 --> 59:08.604
the hell freedom movement and got convinced that it ended up part of the MAGA movement and this is all just an elaborate orchestration a herding of cats and we fell for it because social media is a military control software suite and you cannot use it skillfully and escape if you skillfully use social media you will be enslaved by it because you're allowing a

59:11.092 --> 59:13.613
an unknown source to put thoughts in your head.

59:13.713 --> 59:16.314
And I guarantee you, they're not doing it to save your kids.

59:16.354 --> 59:17.915
They're doing it to enslave your kids.

59:20.276 --> 59:21.037
Viral shedding.

59:21.757 --> 59:24.138
Well, that just kind of doesn't make sense.

59:24.178 --> 59:28.620
Well, I'm running a transparent, open

59:29.335 --> 59:29.675
honest.

59:30.196 --> 59:34.059
I want to pick up where I left off with these guys, because it's all one malevolent show.

59:34.119 --> 59:35.360
And I want to just illustrate.

59:35.420 --> 59:39.023
So what we didn't hear was the stuff right after they're all lying to me.

59:39.083 --> 59:40.824
And I kicked a Zack off the thing.

59:41.324 --> 59:44.747
Now listen to what he says right after the you know, they're all lying to me.

59:44.787 --> 59:46.388
And they all had NIH grants.

59:46.428 --> 59:50.171
And they were all lying to me about the NIH grants mission.

59:51.292 --> 59:54.575
Then, what was interesting, Bobby is that, of course, the other

59:56.153 --> 59:58.814
10 to 15 members, went after me.

59:59.575 --> 01:00:11.440
What's the matter with you, Sachs, you anti-science, reckless, buying into the right wing conspiracy theory and everything you could imagine.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:23.105
And one of them was a friend of mine for, as I said, for probably about 25 years, who ripped into me personally, like I,

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:29.338
don't usually experience but saying how he was who he was

01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:33.084
It's because of the personal thing.

01:00:33.144 --> 01:00:55.068
Let me just mention the bottom line, though, which was hilarious to me, although a little sad, which was, as he was absolutely furious with my anti-science, out comes one of the FOIA documents, which is one of Daschig's NIH grants.

01:00:55.908 --> 01:00:57.870
And who's a co-investigator?

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:05.676
This guy, which I had asked him, I asked all of them, tell me, do you have any relationship?

01:01:05.976 --> 01:01:06.937
Not a word.

01:01:07.237 --> 01:01:08.999
So the guy's co-investigator.

01:01:09.339 --> 01:01:13.582
Of course, it turned out several of them were co-investigators.

01:01:13.642 --> 01:01:16.665
That's when I said, okay, this whole task force is being

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:18.617
Closed.

01:01:18.697 --> 01:01:20.919
We're not using this task force.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.084
We're going to find other ways to get to the facts on this.

01:01:25.704 --> 01:01:36.555
Oh, well, I can tell you other scientists then said, what are you doing sacks so reckless so anti science after all of these people have lied.

01:01:37.398 --> 01:01:42.759
and had prevaricated and had disguised their conflicts of interest and so on.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.820
And then the next ones start to attack.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.041
And then it turns out, OK, they're in it too.

01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:52.102
And it's really quite a web, actually.

01:01:52.522 --> 01:01:54.402
So that's one side of it.

01:01:54.943 --> 01:02:01.564
I'd say there are three sides of this story that are absolutely fascinating.

01:02:02.705 --> 01:02:04.045
One is this kind of

01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:07.939
That's script reading right there.

01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:10.160
I turned down my volume so I could drink.

01:02:10.681 --> 01:02:11.801
That's script reading right there.

01:02:11.821 --> 01:02:13.783
He's looking down right now, but he's reading.

01:02:13.823 --> 01:02:16.704
He's trying to get himself back on his note list.

01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:32.053
Web of connection, conflict, pretty much all of them around NIH grants, around Tony Fauci and his group that he has supported.

01:02:34.497 --> 01:02:38.852
really, really unpleasant part of this.

01:02:39.313 --> 01:02:40.678
The second thing that we learn

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:51.137
is from the FOIA releases themselves that, and you know it, but it's amazing to see, actually.

01:02:51.717 --> 01:02:53.678
I find it pretty low life.

01:02:54.399 --> 01:03:04.006
I don't expect more of government in general, but when it is in the scientific side, I kind of still hoped that there was more integrity there.

01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:08.489
But from the first day that we know of NIH

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:17.583
taking its hand on the public response, which I put it February 1, 2020.

01:03:18.723 --> 01:03:28.986
It may predate that, but February 1, 2020 is a now notorious secret phone call that Francis.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:32.947
But that was already when Steve Bannon had said it was a lab leak.

01:03:32.967 --> 01:03:35.428
Steve Bannon was already on stage with Li Min Yan.

01:03:36.684 --> 01:04:02.525
That was already when Robert Malone had spun his team up and already used three weeks to scan all known pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals in the FDA catalog with the domain AI server thing and used x-ray crystallography models that he generated of the viral proteins that he was interested in to identify silicoxib and famotidine and ivermectin and remdesivir.

01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:08.900
Just put that into perspective about what this guy's claiming to be.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.382
I'm telling you though, whoa, whoa, look at these guys.

01:04:11.422 --> 01:04:12.963
They were doing emails and stuff.

01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:20.390
As Collins and Tony Fauci organized with Jeremy Farrar of Welcome Trust and a group of virologists,

01:04:21.423 --> 01:04:26.090
And the same day Francis Plummer was killed in Kenya.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:26.871
That's awesome.

01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:36.044
That is an AIDS researcher from Canada who was the supervisor of the Chinese spy who was stealing stuff from Canada and Ebola and stuff.

01:04:36.204 --> 01:04:37.005
That group.

01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:44.636
And she actually had a three antibody cocktail that was really good at something that they didn't like it to be good at.

01:04:44.836 --> 01:04:47.458
And so, and it was also being tested somewhere.

01:04:47.518 --> 01:04:49.299
I think she was on the cover of Time and stuff.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.480
You have to ask Mark about that.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.781
I can't keep these people straight.

01:04:52.362 --> 01:05:01.229
All of them said on February 1, that looks a lot like a lab creation, not just a lab release, a lab creation.

01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:06.372
And it's interesting and important for people to understand why.

01:05:07.341 --> 01:05:09.182
And so I'll digress for one moment.

01:05:09.202 --> 01:05:14.124
It's interesting for people to understand why they thought it was a lab leak.

01:05:14.164 --> 01:05:15.484
This is the Scooby-Doo.

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:21.927
This is the mystery solving exercise that we're all supposed to go along with our friend and our friend, right?

01:05:21.967 --> 01:05:23.147
That's the idea here.

01:05:24.308 --> 01:05:28.869
This is in 2022, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:28.889 --> 01:05:35.192
2022, scripted bullshit from a UN Vatican speaker, a Kennedy kid,

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:50.877
COVID-19 is like SARS-1, but it's got one little bit of its genome that makes it really infective and very dangerous.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:57.019
And that is what's called the furin cleavage site or the proteolytic cleavage site.

01:05:57.939 --> 01:06:01.300
And four amino acids in this.

01:06:03.345 --> 01:06:16.694
Four amino acids are the cliff face width between normal everyday operations on earth and a ongoing RNA pandemic.

01:06:16.734 --> 01:06:19.516
That's how narrow the cliff edge is.

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:21.937
Four bases.

01:06:25.139 --> 01:06:25.820
Stop lying!

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:28.589
My gosh, what a joke.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:37.560
It's long or 12 nucleotides in this 30,000 nucleotide virus.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.701
There you go.

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:44.708
It is four amino acids, 12 nucleotides, 20 nucleotides.

01:06:44.788 --> 01:06:45.389
Give me a break.

01:06:47.495 --> 01:06:50.317
make it far more dangerous than SARS-CoV-1.

01:06:50.457 --> 01:06:55.780
And I mean, it's three bases per nuclear or per amino acid.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.901
So do your math.

01:06:56.981 --> 01:06:59.262
If it's four amino acids, it's how many?

01:06:59.342 --> 01:07:01.824
Like, come on, this is so stupid.

01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:06.306
What happened at the beginning when this virus was sequenced.

01:07:06.367 --> 01:07:09.128
And why is it stupid from a biological perspective?

01:07:09.188 --> 01:07:11.330
Just think about it rationally for a second.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:16.853
If the cliff face that mankind is on is four amino acids wide,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:43.670
then once the humanity fell off the cliff, then why weren't all the virologists on earth and all the sequencers on earth and all of the DITRA people and everybody that's working on sequences like Kevin McKernan focused in on the four amino acids that made it the most contagious virus on earth and inspired a

01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:54.654
a would-be shoe salesman to drop everything and lose his house and make an excel sheet to try and save the world.

01:07:59.216 --> 01:08:04.338
To go on and drop everything and risk everything because of a furin cleavage site.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:10.340
And why haven't we paid attention to its evolution and potential loss?

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:22.421
Why aren't we focused exclusively on those four amino acids in every sequence we ever talk about, even when we announce that there's a new COVID variant on PBS NewsHour last week?

01:08:22.441 --> 01:08:29.104
There's no mention of these four critical amino acids that really kicked it all off and fucked us all in the ass.

01:08:31.146 --> 01:08:33.347
Do you see how awful this lie is?

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:37.990
I'm so sorry that I swore there, I really am, but this is really aggravating to me.

01:08:38.905 --> 01:08:49.130
Because this whole biological myth, in everybody's mind that's performing for us, supposedly revolves around four amino acids.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.211
And that is absurd.

01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:55.873
Sequenced, and people looked at it.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:59.895
They said, oh, this thing has a furin cleavage site.

01:09:01.016 --> 01:09:02.777
And they said, whoa.

01:09:03.629 --> 01:09:04.510
Where did that come from?

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:20.084
And one of the immediate hypotheses is, well, someone stuck it in there because the Furin-Cleavitt site is an intense object of scientific research interest because it was known.

01:09:21.187 --> 01:09:39.247
actually since SARS-1, that if you take a SARS-like virus and you stick in a furan cleavage site at what's called the S1-S2 junction, boy, you make that virus potentially a lot more lethal, a lot more pathogenic, a lot more transmissible.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:44.032
So it was an object of scientific interest that went back to SARS.

01:09:44.172 --> 01:09:52.421
The only cleavage site you need to understand is the 90 billboards that Polly Tommy was on in the early 2000s in her bra.

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:54.983
That's the only cleavage sites you need to understand.

01:09:55.924 --> 01:10:01.731
The original outbreak, and it was a real intensive object of interest of

01:10:03.885 --> 01:10:08.107
the NIH-funded group from 2015 onward.

01:10:08.367 --> 01:10:25.556
So the point is, on February 1, 2020, if you had an activist, a young American recovering addict, son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and you were trying to use him for something,

01:10:27.037 --> 01:10:28.758
And he didn't want to be used for it.

01:10:28.898 --> 01:10:35.661
Or he already had figured out that he was going to be an environmentalist and a falconer, and that was just what he was going to do as a lawyer.

01:10:36.221 --> 01:10:40.523
And you wanted to convince him, no, we need you to do something a little more for your country.

01:10:41.383 --> 01:10:44.885
We need you to help us with this anti-vax movement.

01:10:45.646 --> 01:11:08.383
the only way you'd be able to convince somebody that was kind of a real guy might be to kill his wife and bring a couple people over from the UK who had already practiced this bullshit and then bring someone from, I don't know, maybe from Columbia University and I don't know, maybe somebody from a government laboratory who claims to have an autistic kid and I don't know, maybe put them all together in a room with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:08.423 --> 01:11:09.464
and explain to him that

01:11:09.884 --> 01:11:16.987
You know, we need to build a big top tent of health freedom because it's some component or another of some of these vaccines I think are dangerous.

01:11:17.067 --> 01:11:20.789
And so it's a really hard mystery, but we need you to get on board.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:25.631
I'm not absolving him of blame.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:36.256
I'm trying to accentuate and make you think of the possibility that he's not smart enough to know he's been played because they've been playing him for years.

01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:53.286
And so when they roll Robert Malone in and Meryl Nass in and Mary Holland in and Brian Hooker in and Polly Tommy in and Andrew Wakefield in over years and years and years, and even keep him isolated so that he doesn't really know who Brandy Vaughn is, doesn't really listen to her a lot.

01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:57.048
You know, get, get James Lyons Weiler in there around him and stuff.

01:11:58.289 --> 01:11:59.330
He's been played.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:03.873
He's been used and now he will be thrown away.

01:12:05.805 --> 01:12:28.574
And people who used him are from world banks, they are from international interests, they are from weaponized piles of money, and that includes people like Roger Ailes, it includes people like Jeffrey Sachs, it includes people like, I mean, any of these people have played him and used him over many years, I am certain of it.

01:12:31.104 --> 01:12:35.887
The virologist looked at this and said, whoa, whoa, furin cleavage site.

01:12:35.907 --> 01:12:44.513
That's the only FCS, the only furin cleavage site in a sarbucovirus that is a SARS-like virus that we know of.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:49.016
And boy, that really suggests maybe someone stuck that in there.

01:12:49.977 --> 01:12:51.198
Now, as you know,

01:12:52.624 --> 01:13:00.130
Now remember, one of the most damning events to occur in the last five years was an event that occurred at the end of 2024, I believe.

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:01.772
Sorry, the end of 2023, I believe.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:03.893
No, it was the end of 2022, wasn't it?

01:13:03.953 --> 01:13:04.294
23, let's see.

01:13:12.549 --> 01:13:23.213
It is the November 2023, yes, it was November 2023, that the International COVID Summit found itself in Romania.

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:39.598
And in that group photograph of a bunch of COVID dissidents, apparently, all of whom share the idea that X is the best social media platform ever, were present on stage in Bucharest, Romania.

01:13:40.911 --> 01:13:47.135
And that included a traitor and very bad liar, Nick Hudson.

01:13:47.996 --> 01:13:53.520
It included a long time meddler and traitor, I consider very bad, Brett Weinstein.

01:13:54.761 --> 01:14:07.810
Another puppet of this NATO organized or loosely organized NATO operation, whatever it is, Jessica Rose, Meryl Nass, Ryan Cole, and Denny Rancourt.

01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:10.009
And Steven Hatfill.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:12.431
Yes, Steven Hatfill.

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:20.539
What's happening?

01:14:20.699 --> 01:14:22.341
Ah, darn it, I did that wrong again.

01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:24.222
Always the same nonsense.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:29.351
Today, I'm here with Dr. Stephen Hatfield.

01:14:29.391 --> 01:14:33.215
He is a virologist, an author, and a bioweapons expert.

01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:48.448
You probably know his name because in the early 2000s, he was wrongfully accused of the anthrax attacks and won a sizable... And the way that he was exonerated was that a former colleague of Robert Malone accused a Christian guy, and that Christian guy committed suicide.

01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:49.689
Stop lying!

01:14:52.285 --> 01:14:56.187
settlement against the government for that wrongful accusation.

01:14:56.207 --> 01:15:11.295
Now, he also was known as an early treatment proponent in the first Trump administration where he was- He was also an early proponent of wearing a rubber apron if you have to treat sick kids and making sure that sick kids had a separate shitter.

01:15:12.135 --> 01:15:14.556
And you better wear flip-flops when you go in their room.

01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:19.999
Yes, he thought Barney should wear a mask so that little kids would get used to it.

01:15:22.489 --> 01:15:26.152
This treacherous monster is now advising Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:26.172 --> 01:15:26.973
I'm sure that's fine.

01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:28.914
As a senior medical advisor.

01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:31.376
And he was a very controversial figure.

01:15:31.757 --> 01:15:36.621
And depending on what side of the early treatment fence you are on, you will think of him as a hero.

01:15:36.921 --> 01:15:40.284
You might think of him as somebody who pushed drugs that you don't think worked.

01:15:40.324 --> 01:15:43.947
So how come nobody says that Zev Zelenko pushed hydroxychloroquine?

01:15:43.987 --> 01:15:47.529
And why doesn't she say hydroxychloroquine out loud if that's what he pushed?

01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.051
Isn't that weird?

01:15:50.253 --> 01:15:52.158
It's like Zev Zelenko never existed.

01:15:53.004 --> 01:15:56.125
Even the wellness company seems to very rarely mention Zev.

01:15:56.965 --> 01:15:58.266
And he's here to clarify that.

01:15:58.306 --> 01:16:01.307
We have a long conversation about that episode today.

01:16:02.067 --> 01:16:05.728
And now he is working again in the second Trump administration.

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:11.090
He is a senior medical officer and advisor under RFK Jr.

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.530
at Health and Human Services.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:15.331
And he's focused on pandemic preparedness.

01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:16.831
And that's another topic we cover.

01:16:17.312 --> 01:16:21.213
So just when you think you know everything and all the behind the scenes,

01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:27.257
You know, you have a conversation like this and you go, oh my God, there is so much we still don't know.

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:31.360
Dr. Hatfield clarifies a lot of questions that you had.

01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:36.724
I took a lot of your questions that you sent to me on social media and I was able to ask him directly.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:43.650
And I can't tell you what a fascinating, but also shocking and upsetting conversation this was for me.

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:45.050
in many ways.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:17:05.778
I just continue to learn about the horrors of the last five years, from the virus to the pandemic preparedness plans that we completely ignored, to the early treatment debacle, to harms of the mRNA vaccines, all kinds of things that I think are really important for all of us to know now and continue to learn about.

01:17:05.858 --> 01:17:10.160
So thanks for joining us, and I think you are going to really enjoy this conversation.

01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:18.913
Okay, so I'm going to tell you a little story here before I let it play because I want you to think, hear how I'm thinking, coach you through this a little bit.

01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:21.815
And I'm just going to draw some shit here and see what comes out.

01:17:23.036 --> 01:17:30.000
I really, really need some help getting this idea out a little bit more, and so I'm just going to work on it live.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.602
Do you like my phages?

01:17:31.762 --> 01:17:32.322
They're cool, right?

01:17:33.323 --> 01:17:36.104
Those are T4 phages, so I don't know what lambda phages look like.

01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:42.848
So what I want to suggest to you is that if the Human Genome Project, because that's where we are, right?

01:17:44.488 --> 01:17:56.913
If you think of the Human Genome Project as something that is a long-term plan, it's not a, you know, it wasn't done in 2000, they just figured out what they needed to do.

01:17:57.788 --> 01:18:07.036
And so then there were a number of things, classified things that would need to be established over the coming decades in order for the Human Genome Project to actually begin in earnest.

01:18:07.997 --> 01:18:16.444
And so what the human genome really accomplished was estimating the task.

01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:20.332
They estimated the size of the genome.

01:18:20.352 --> 01:18:22.933
They estimated, you know, how many landmarks are there?

01:18:23.053 --> 01:18:27.815
How can we, how, how reproducible are the landmarks over a few genomes?

01:18:28.915 --> 01:18:35.678
And then they tried to zero in on a few things that would allow them to seem like they were making progress.

01:18:35.738 --> 01:18:41.500
And one of those things that, that Mark honed in on yesterday is rare diseases.

01:18:43.471 --> 01:18:53.024
and specifically what rare diseases are and I don't know if if I listened to Mark yesterday and I felt like there was just stuff that from a perspective of a

01:18:54.853 --> 01:18:59.519
of a academic wannabe professor, he wasn't one of those.

01:18:59.579 --> 01:19:06.126
So he's kind of unaware of how this rare disease thing fits into the model of grant writing.

01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:14.396
And I, as a neuroscientist and a former neurobiologist, really, I am keenly aware of what a rare disease is, because in neurobiology,

01:19:15.504 --> 01:19:18.386
We are very, very interested in rare diseases.

01:19:18.426 --> 01:19:19.647
And what are rare diseases?

01:19:19.727 --> 01:19:35.940
Rare diseases in this context, although they were very not good at saying this in the genetic therapy, you know, FDA session, rare diseases are single protein phenotypes.

01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:40.223
So what does that mean?

01:19:40.283 --> 01:19:49.007
It means that they are diseases that are defined by a single protein which is malfunctioning, not present, or, you know, wrong.

01:19:49.947 --> 01:20:05.713
So if you have an enzyme that doesn't work, then there's a set of things that happens to you during development, and that phenotype is, as best as we can tell, associated with a single protein and its aberrant formation, function, sequence, whatever.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:35.615
And so if you imagine the irreducible complexity of your biology as having some anecdotal examples of when the development of a child can proceed all through puberty and everything, but you'll just have some quirks, you'll have some deficits, you'll have some weaknesses, then imagine that these are, from a scientific perspective,

01:20:36.474 --> 01:20:57.101
some of the few legitimate handholds that we might have in trying to understand the role of these particular proteins or how a particular protein could lead to this bouquet of consequences as the trajectory across time unfolds for this pattern integrity.

01:20:58.908 --> 01:21:05.053
And so rare diseases are, intellectually speaking, the only place to start.

01:21:05.113 --> 01:21:08.375
They are the only fruit we can reach.

01:21:09.456 --> 01:21:28.270
And if we solve these problems by adequately correcting the misfolded protein, we will still understand very little about how that person's pattern integrity was lucky enough to have a very detrimental but non-lethal

01:21:29.099 --> 01:21:29.899
genetic error.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:41.102
And those non-lethal genetic errors are what allow them to, again, point to the wall and say, see, DNA equals evolution.

01:21:41.883 --> 01:21:44.303
Mutations equal phenotypes.

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:53.066
And so they think that rare diseases are just the starting point for eventually decoding everything, picking it all apart.

01:21:53.886 --> 01:21:57.667
But the problem is, is that when you go from single rare diseases

01:21:58.516 --> 01:22:04.306
to regular diseases or regular whatever, there's no single gene anymore.

01:22:04.326 --> 01:22:06.230
Like if we go schizophrenia.

01:22:11.604 --> 01:22:13.225
Now there's no single gene anymore.

01:22:13.285 --> 01:22:20.491
Now there's hundreds of genes that could potentially be, I guess, different in people that have schizophrenia.

01:22:20.651 --> 01:22:23.674
And there's all kinds of environmental triggers and things like that.

01:22:23.834 --> 01:22:30.480
And you can smoke cigarettes and make the symptoms of schizophrenia go down.

01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:33.122
But that's all we really know.

01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:39.585
And so these very tiny handholds, they're valid.

01:22:39.805 --> 01:22:41.387
They're nice experiments.

01:22:41.527 --> 01:22:43.189
They're interesting experiments.

01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:48.916
But what happens, and this is the key, I want you to look up something called Angelman syndrome.

01:22:56.325 --> 01:22:57.045
That's your homework.

01:22:57.185 --> 01:23:02.666
Angelman's syndrome is a single protein phenotype in children.

01:23:03.026 --> 01:23:05.407
It's a devastating condition in children.

01:23:06.847 --> 01:23:25.010
And when you write a grant about Angelman's syndrome, you will say that Angelman's has some phenotypes, or you might even use symptoms, in common with what?

01:23:26.265 --> 01:23:28.966
A-S-D.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:45.689
So any rare disease in neurobiology that has some phenotype in the brain could be disingenuously said in an introduction to a grant or an article to have phenotypes and symptoms in common with autism spectrum disorder.

01:23:46.209 --> 01:23:53.731
Therefore, my work on this knockout mouse is related to our understanding of autism spectrum disorder.

01:23:56.829 --> 01:24:14.939
And all the people that you saw in that FDA program that Mark did yesterday were people who have been raised and become successful in a career where their understanding of how to use rare disease as a first handhold into climbing into an irreducible complexity.

01:24:14.979 --> 01:24:17.120
And as long as I'm doing this, it feels good.

01:24:18.314 --> 01:24:26.788
As long as I can say that Angelman syndrome is kind of like autism, I'm really contributing to all these kids and I get to have parties about doing it for the kids.

01:24:26.848 --> 01:24:29.833
I get to work at a children's hospital because I'm doing it for the kids.

01:24:30.353 --> 01:24:32.216
It's all a disingenuous dance.

01:24:33.331 --> 01:24:47.920
And many of these academic biologists, these academy magicians are too unsophisticated in their understanding of biology to know the level of farce, a level of farce that their investigation actually is.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.081
Nevermind that it's mostly in mice, right?

01:24:50.822 --> 01:24:52.803
So this is where we are.

01:24:54.084 --> 01:24:58.967
And so what was I going to say about that?

01:24:59.007 --> 01:25:02.249
Why did I want to... Anyway.

01:25:02.881 --> 01:25:05.943
Let me go back to that picture again to see if I can remember why I did that.

01:25:05.983 --> 01:25:16.010
Oh yeah, so it's the Human Genome Project and the whole concept of the Human Genome Project and wanting to convert to transfection.

01:25:18.351 --> 01:25:18.972
Now it can be

01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:20.449
Sorry, I did that wrong.

01:25:20.809 --> 01:25:24.852
It can be transfection of RNA, as we are now, or DNA.

01:25:24.892 --> 01:25:25.953
It doesn't matter which one.

01:25:25.973 --> 01:25:28.575
I'm going to get messier and messier now for some reason.

01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:45.409
If you wanted to switch from the traditional intramuscular injection of a combination of substances nonsense to a transfection, the way that you would need to do it is to transfect people with something that worked.

01:25:48.089 --> 01:25:51.351
trick people into accepting transfection to something that worked.

01:25:52.051 --> 01:25:52.832
How would it work?

01:25:53.652 --> 01:26:02.397
In terms of the NIH and NIAID and DOD and DARPA and DITRA, it works by producing seroprevalence.

01:26:02.898 --> 01:26:04.058
And you can't get around that.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:11.803
That seroprevalence is the signal that they have to meet.

01:26:12.003 --> 01:26:13.344
It is the bar they have to meet.

01:26:13.384 --> 01:26:17.426
I apologize if that's, that's wrong.

01:26:19.535 --> 01:26:21.716
seroprevalence, the presence of antibodies.

01:26:21.856 --> 01:26:34.259
And so if you were going to make a transfection that produced antibodies, what you would need is a very reliable and universal antigen.

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:40.260
And there is a company called EpiVax.

01:26:42.734 --> 01:26:59.429
for whom Robert Malone worked and advised that was looking specifically for antigens and antigenic sequences, short antigenic sequences that could be put into vaccines and other products to provoke an immune response.

01:26:59.449 --> 01:27:03.632
So they were looking at these special sequences that are presented on

01:27:05.914 --> 01:27:16.822
on MHC molecules during presentation and in the immune response and looking for antigenic sequences that were especially good at provoking that seroprevalence.

01:27:19.004 --> 01:27:28.852
And so if you were going to fool somebody with a transfection, what you would do is you would say, hey, let's put an agent in China

01:27:29.966 --> 01:27:36.879
and let's have her find a sequence and let's have that sequence have a very reliable, highly antigenic

01:27:38.308 --> 01:27:56.802
code in it, designed by DARPA, so that when we roll out the transfection as a response to the pandemic, we will be rolling out a protein that we know, when we express it, we will get a very reliable immune response, even after several exposures to it.

01:27:57.282 --> 01:28:00.545
Therefore, we can drive the booster rollout as well.

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:15.086
It's a very, very simple combination of technologies that exist with a mythology using people and actors that were already put in place just in a way that Tucker Carlson apparently has never imagined.

01:28:16.567 --> 01:28:26.654
And so let's see if what I'm talking about here, the idea of releasing a sequence that actually had built into it a guaranteed serial prevalence generator,

01:28:29.793 --> 01:28:30.153
Hmm.

01:28:30.633 --> 01:28:32.514
Wonder if that's going to be part of this story.

01:28:32.834 --> 01:28:48.698
Dr. Hadfield, thank you so much for doing this today with me and answering all these amazing questions that I got for you from all kinds of folks around the topic of COVID and biowarfare, which you are an expert on and pandemic preparedness.

01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:50.318
Always a pleasure to talk to you.

01:28:50.338 --> 01:28:52.299
We always have fun on these.

01:28:52.799 --> 01:28:53.159
Okay.

01:28:53.179 --> 01:28:57.360
So I'm just going to fire away and I'm excited to hear your answers to these questions.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.180
Okay.

01:28:58.655 --> 01:29:03.716
What makes it clear to you as a virologist that COVID was bioengineered?

01:29:04.136 --> 01:29:11.598
There's a couple of genetic sequences in this virus that we can't establish an evolutionary line from.

01:29:12.398 --> 01:29:16.179
Seems to be a mix of a couple of different COVID viruses.

01:29:17.439 --> 01:29:18.619
It's nice editing there.

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:26.401
What finally sold me was in the Wuhan strain, the sequence that the US was given,

01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:36.008
there's a 20 amino acid stretch up near the sort of the cauliflower part of the protein.

01:29:37.528 --> 01:29:45.250
That if you three-dimensionally model it, it is a super antigen, which is a bad thing to be.

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:56.393
And it's a super antigen that's derived from a bacterium called staphylococcal enteropoxen B. And what this does is that if you get it into your bloodstream,

01:29:57.378 --> 01:30:01.001
It turns on about 30% of your lymphocytes all at once.

01:30:01.842 --> 01:30:04.003
This is what we call the cytokine storm.

01:30:04.924 --> 01:30:07.466
If you grew the Wuhan virus... Look at it.

01:30:07.506 --> 01:30:09.648
He can't even do it without reading.

01:30:09.668 --> 01:30:10.769
He's such a putz.

01:30:11.872 --> 01:30:32.522
this traitor monster fake man wow virus on human epithelial cells that segment human epithelial cells the specialty of ralph barrack you know that really bad guy who's responsible for the virus that fat dude who makes donuts stayed in there but if you grew it on alternate tissue culture methods

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:47.861
Oh my gosh, it's enrichment through frickin' cell culture, just like frickin' Andrew Huff said with Charles Rixey and Kim Dotcom on X in 2022.

01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:48.521
Do you see it?

01:30:49.522 --> 01:31:00.832
The same absolute nonsense bullshit biology narrative, just no sophistication at all, no attempt to, I mean, wow.

01:31:02.355 --> 01:31:03.456
Check that thing out.

01:31:04.677 --> 01:31:09.781
And this is always sort of an indication that's been crammed in there and it's not natural.

01:31:10.502 --> 01:31:15.026
And then there was a thing called a furin cleavage site that had been engineered in there.

01:31:15.186 --> 01:31:16.547
He's still got to look.

01:31:17.268 --> 01:31:20.951
He's still got to read Martin Malone's script.

01:31:20.991 --> 01:31:22.012
He's so dumb.

01:31:24.354 --> 01:31:27.056
So the spike protein is like a closed umbrella.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:39.939
and it's manufactured, but it's got to get through all that cytoplasm in the cell membrane and poke out through the cell membrane, and then the umbrella opens up, right?

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:45.681
And the furin cleaving side is what holds that umbrella together.

01:31:45.861 --> 01:31:52.543
And we've seen it in some other coronaviruses, but they're not a direct lineage to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

01:31:53.124 --> 01:31:56.765
When this virus came out, it was perfectly adapted to replicate in man.

01:31:57.358 --> 01:31:59.799
perfectly adapted to replicate in man.

01:31:59.839 --> 01:32:05.500
And we have data from at least one Australian scientist to confirm that, which is just a joke.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.762
Of course, it was, you know, it's hyper enriched for the ACE2 receptor.

01:32:11.042 --> 01:32:11.942
Yeah.

01:32:11.962 --> 01:32:13.422
It didn't like bats anymore.

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:15.783
It liked man.

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:26.006
And, you know, you don't see this unless it's had extensive passage in a host that is its target.

01:32:26.516 --> 01:32:47.491
Does the SEB-like motif that you just described, the super antigen, I read a paper, and I read a paper that you wrote as well, that said, the PNAS paper that I'm referring to originally, it said that that motif implies, if it's aerosolized, that it was made as a result of bioweapons research.

01:32:48.091 --> 01:32:50.173
Do you agree with that?

01:32:50.213 --> 01:32:55.536
Well, it was a bioweapons agent back in the old offensive US program.

01:32:57.541 --> 01:33:14.252
One of the things to realize is the whole concept of they aerosolized it or it can be aerosolized, that actually started with the aerosolization of the avian flu in ferrets by this guy Fauchier in Rotterdam where I used to work.

01:33:15.294 --> 01:33:19.235
And I would be willing to bet that that's probably bullshit, and I'll tell you why.

01:33:19.315 --> 01:33:28.577
Because they didn't use that experiment to sequence the virus in each ferret to see how the virus was changing.

01:33:29.417 --> 01:33:43.460
And then the whole point of it being aerosolized, of course, would be that there are chemical and physical attributes to the virus on the outside, which would cause it to be aerosolized or not.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.503
That's a well understood branch of chemistry there.

01:33:49.583 --> 01:34:03.393
The electrostatics and stuff like that, we don't need to think very hard about the idea that that has to be a physical process by which at some point something that can only be spread by droplets is now spreading aerosol.

01:34:03.834 --> 01:34:09.258
That supposedly, if we were being genuine about the way the world works, that should be a

01:34:10.579 --> 01:34:23.841
change that would have been identified as a chemical change in a sequence of a protein of the flu virus that supposedly went from being not aerosolized in the first ferret to being aerosolized in the 20th ferret.

01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:32.355
But instead they just talk about the enrichment and that the ferrets were dying more.

01:34:32.395 --> 01:34:38.120
But then what changed in the flu to cause it to fly around easier and to kill those ferrets?

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.461
But we got no answer.

01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:46.708
They gave us no answer about how the flu changed in their ferret experiment.

01:34:49.522 --> 01:34:58.524
And so this whole argument about whether it's aerosolized or not, whether or not we should use masks or not, because if it's aerosolized, we shouldn't, but if it's just droplets, we should.

01:34:59.104 --> 01:35:07.405
This is all part of the bullshit, which accepts an existence of a novel respiratory virus.

01:35:09.606 --> 01:35:10.186
SEB.

01:35:11.586 --> 01:35:14.267
And it was designed as an incapacitating agent.

01:35:14.367 --> 01:35:15.787
In other words, it would kill less than

01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:18.612
1% of the population that it was.

01:35:18.772 --> 01:35:30.764
An incapacitating agent is the exact combination of terms that our clown friend Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn were both using, but especially Kevin McCairn in March of 2020.

01:35:33.086 --> 01:35:34.888
An incapacitating agent.

01:35:36.613 --> 01:35:39.955
It's not by accident, it's because they're all on the same stupid script.

01:35:40.696 --> 01:35:47.401
And after five or six years, it's actually starting to become obvious, even to people who don't watch my stream that often.

01:35:49.322 --> 01:35:54.666
There were even plans we were going to spray it on Cuba during the Bay of Pigs.

01:35:55.433 --> 01:36:01.395
as an incapacitating agent, because if you breathe it in, it gives you a pneumonia from hell, seriously.

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:05.137
If you eat it, it gives you a terrible gastrointestinal illness.

01:36:05.417 --> 01:36:11.519
They were gonna do another agent as well, and then a third agent after that, and the island would have been sick.

01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:13.780
I think he's talking about anthrax right there.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.161
For a month.

01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:19.622
And you think it would have killed about 1% of the population there.

01:36:20.102 --> 01:36:21.543
Well, nobody did it.

01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:24.224
We don't have an all fancy program anymore.

01:36:25.812 --> 01:36:33.016
Seriously, in the continental United States, they shut everything down and they built some... No, seriously, he's telling the truth.

01:36:33.056 --> 01:36:34.657
They shut everything down in America.

01:36:35.317 --> 01:36:36.578
Seriously, he's telling the truth.

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:39.579
He's legit, just like Jessica Hockett.

01:36:39.599 --> 01:36:42.020
You know, she doesn't know about a lot of people, but she's legit.

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:47.463
Wonderful research facilities because these new diseases keep cropping up.

01:36:48.563 --> 01:36:53.506
So we have some labs now totally devoted to new pathogens that no one's ever seen before.

01:36:54.136 --> 01:36:58.403
Is the super antigen still in the COVID virus as we know it today?

01:36:59.185 --> 01:36:59.385
No.

01:37:00.387 --> 01:37:07.900
I haven't had time to look at the vaccine sequences, but I'm suspecting in the early vaccines.

01:37:09.748 --> 01:37:10.348
It was in there.

01:37:10.768 --> 01:37:12.949
What kind of bullshit is that?

01:37:13.389 --> 01:37:15.670
Please understand how malevolent this is.

01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:36.418
They are trying to make you believe that the precision of the code is so precarious that with a change of around 12 bases resulting in the change of four amino acids, we could go from everyday baseball games to frickin' shutdown for five years and all the white-tailed deer infected.

01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:47.660
Now this guy's trying to say, I haven't really had time to check if they put this Staphylococcus enterotoxin B sequence into the vaccines or not.

01:37:50.262 --> 01:37:51.844
Even though it's like a bioweapon.

01:37:52.816 --> 01:37:57.138
or something, this is just comically stupid.

01:37:57.218 --> 01:38:09.843
And what's really bad about it is this mouth breather over here, reading the script that she was obviously given by him, is so unsophisticated that she doesn't hear the bullshit that she's harmonizing with.

01:38:11.884 --> 01:38:12.264
Really?

01:38:12.964 --> 01:38:13.485
Interesting.

01:38:13.725 --> 01:38:19.087
Well, they took what the, this paper was discovered later on after, you know?

01:38:19.467 --> 01:38:19.747
Yeah.

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:21.288
Yeah.

01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:25.073
I guess I didn't realize that it was in the vaccine.

01:38:25.653 --> 01:38:29.537
What a face, what a monster, what a monster piece of shit.

01:38:32.099 --> 01:38:34.781
I think this might be one of the worst Americans alive right now.

01:38:36.302 --> 01:38:41.347
I knew it was in the virus, but I didn't realize it was also that that SEB like.

01:38:42.168 --> 01:38:49.194
So what I'm suggesting to you is if there was a national security state that was interested in just getting people to buy into transfection,

01:38:50.512 --> 01:39:11.772
and they wanted wherever they didn't roll out placebo for there to be a testable antibody that would show up and and and ring true with their lateral flow tests or whatever other bullshit they would already know what sequence to put in because some of these sequences wouldn't be antigenic at all and then doing the whole transfection would be a giant failure

01:39:12.412 --> 01:39:21.657
But it only took them 45 minutes from the time that they heard the sequence to have a working vaccine, according to the lady from Moderna, in her own TED Talk.

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:28.100
That means that something was already there that worked perfectly to create seroprevalence.

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.981
And that would be by design.

01:39:34.343 --> 01:39:36.384
A motif was in the vaccine as well.

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.121
I've not seen yay or nay.

01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:39.342
Interesting.

01:39:39.362 --> 01:39:42.944
Remember, you couldn't get any vaccine to check.

01:39:43.685 --> 01:39:44.365
What do you mean?

01:39:44.385 --> 01:39:45.486
What?

01:39:46.087 --> 01:39:48.148
This is just freaking ridiculous.

01:39:48.208 --> 01:39:51.070
It's ridiculous, ridiculous, dumb, stupid, ridiculous.

01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.911
Right.

01:39:52.551 --> 01:39:54.192
They were finding all sorts of weird thing.

01:39:54.252 --> 01:39:55.213
It was only recently.

01:39:56.049 --> 01:40:00.311
You know, the extraneous DNA fragments and all that.

01:40:00.331 --> 01:40:00.812
Oh, man.

01:40:01.132 --> 01:40:02.312
Are you kidding me?

01:40:02.993 --> 01:40:04.634
Would we need to sequence it?

01:40:04.714 --> 01:40:06.454
What is he talking about?

01:40:06.535 --> 01:40:18.641
We just went from Staphylotoxin and Teratoxin B is a signal that we find in the spike protein of this laboratory released virus, but I don't give a shit if it's any in any of the shots.

01:40:18.681 --> 01:40:19.301
I haven't bothered.

01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:20.602
I haven't had time to check.

01:40:22.921 --> 01:40:24.402
Laboratory practice.

01:40:24.502 --> 01:40:25.903
I'm concerned about that.

01:40:26.264 --> 01:40:27.405
Are you concerned about DNA?

01:40:27.465 --> 01:40:28.545
Not that concerned though.

01:40:28.565 --> 01:40:32.629
He's so not concerned that he would rather podcast with you instead of figure it out.

01:40:32.649 --> 01:40:34.930
DNA integration.

01:40:35.551 --> 01:40:35.811
Yes.

01:40:36.952 --> 01:40:49.542
We weren't, we weren't by the, by the mid of 2020, sorry, by the mid of 2021, they had modeled this and they found four prion sites that

01:40:54.361 --> 01:40:55.662
Four prion sites.

01:40:56.302 --> 01:41:13.194
Remember, Google tells us that Google Fold has figured out how proteins fold, but we haven't taken that AI and asked it to show us how prions are able to, like, one particle of prions causes all the proteins in your body to fold wrong.

01:41:16.056 --> 01:41:18.798
They found four prion sequences in there.

01:41:19.738 --> 01:41:27.314
This is just an admission that it's the same script that that jackass Kevin McCairn was on since March of 2020.

01:41:30.407 --> 01:41:34.130
that could fold abnormally into an insoluble.

01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:41.155
You know, another subject in biology that needs a gigantic book or many gigantic books are prions.

01:41:41.676 --> 01:41:49.402
When they seem to be so simple, they're just prions are just proteins that cause other proteins to fold differently and the same way as them.

01:41:49.442 --> 01:41:52.724
And it's like this cascade and it's just a disaster.

01:41:53.125 --> 01:41:55.546
And yet these books, they don't explain it at all.

01:41:55.827 --> 01:41:56.387
They don't have

01:41:57.648 --> 01:42:01.190
a summary chapter, they're just really thick books about nothing.

01:42:01.831 --> 01:42:04.773
I know because I've read them, amyloid, if you will.

01:42:06.214 --> 01:42:07.935
And it always had that potential.

01:42:08.975 --> 01:42:12.918
And again, I haven't seen if that's been engineered out of that sequence.

01:42:13.318 --> 01:42:13.819
Interesting.

01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:19.703
What is the implication of the DNA, the plasmid DNA in the vaccine?

01:42:20.303 --> 01:42:26.347
The problem is your cells have a biochemical mechanism called line one.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.880
line dash one.

01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:35.083
And when you see a lot of viral DNA floating around, this is a trigger to your immune system.

01:42:35.903 --> 01:42:38.604
It doesn't like that doesn't like the methylation on it.

01:42:38.845 --> 01:42:50.369
And what it will try to do is grab part of it, turn it into if it's RNA, turn it into DNA, and it ends up going back into the

01:42:50.967 --> 01:42:52.968
chromosome as a transposon.

01:42:53.688 --> 01:42:57.229
So did he say that the viral RNA is methylated?

01:42:57.249 --> 01:42:59.770
Because I think he just said that, and I don't know if that's true.

01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:00.951
I've never heard that before.

01:43:00.991 --> 01:43:02.011
That was really bizarre.

01:43:03.472 --> 01:43:10.834
And now he's talking about some enzyme that's going to reverse transcribe the RNA to DNA and put it into your genome.

01:43:10.894 --> 01:43:14.036
Transposons are jumping genes.

01:43:14.836 --> 01:43:19.778
You know, like maize, like real corn, and it's all different colored kernels?

01:43:20.058 --> 01:43:20.258
Sure.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.241
that's what gives the different color kernels.

01:43:23.981 --> 01:43:27.962
A lady named Barbara McKendrick got a Nobel Prize for finding that.

01:43:28.362 --> 01:43:32.103
These are segments of DNA that can jump in and be explored.

01:43:32.323 --> 01:43:36.445
Did he say someone by the name of Kendrick got a Nobel Prize for that?

01:43:36.505 --> 01:43:40.666
That's an interesting name that I know from Brian Hooker 2020 podcast.

01:43:41.266 --> 01:43:43.647
Pressed and then jump out.

01:43:43.707 --> 01:43:48.108
But sometimes when they jump in or jump out and re-jump in,

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:52.624
they end up next to an important gene involved in cancer.

01:43:53.245 --> 01:43:53.585
I see.

01:43:53.926 --> 01:44:00.992
It does seem like there's a lot of concern about the virus causing cancer and potentially the vaccines.

01:44:01.833 --> 01:44:04.095
The vaccine particularly so.

01:44:05.817 --> 01:44:12.823
One of the ends of the viral genome has something like a,

01:44:13.954 --> 01:44:15.735
SP40 enhancer on it.

01:44:16.255 --> 01:44:18.076
And this is so pathetic.

01:44:18.537 --> 01:44:23.479
I don't know if he's just tired or if he's really old, but this is really pathetic.

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.782
And it's pathetic because they never planned to be here.

01:44:28.923 --> 01:44:42.150
They never planned for him to have to go to Romania and meet Nick Hudson and Denny Rancor and Brett Weinstein and Jessica Rose and Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone and Meryl Nass all on the other side of the earth.

01:44:43.814 --> 01:44:49.045
They never planned on having Robert Malone do six consecutive international COVID summits.

01:44:49.085 --> 01:44:52.512
It was all an improv-ed addition to the plan.

01:44:54.482 --> 01:44:58.003
because this narrative is way, way out of their control now.

01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:15.546
And they are about to be exposed as traitors to America in cooperation with people from India, setting up some kind of weird Trojan horse where the FDA could either be effectively neutralized, undermined, destroyed, and HHS secretary would be occupied by a puppet.

01:45:17.886 --> 01:45:20.507
This makes certain genes express- His puppet.

01:45:21.377 --> 01:45:22.537
Can you explain what that is?

01:45:22.598 --> 01:45:35.543
His puppet, Robert Malone's puppet, Steve Bannon's puppet, Democratic Party puppets, weaponized piles of money puppets.

01:45:35.603 --> 01:45:36.683
That's all these people are.

01:45:36.703 --> 01:45:40.345
It's kind of like an afterburner for gene expression.

01:45:40.705 --> 01:45:42.446
Like an airplane, all the flames come out.

01:45:42.766 --> 01:45:46.267
The thing goes faster because you're just pumping fuel into it.

01:45:46.808 --> 01:45:47.528
Kind of like that.

01:45:48.172 --> 01:45:49.013
sort of a rocket.

01:45:49.173 --> 01:46:03.228
Wow, really random out of the end of the day that in random insertions until you disrupt something that's like a pre onco gene that's very carefully regulated like a growth chain.

01:46:03.689 --> 01:46:08.754
And suddenly you get overexpression of this, things like see Mike, this type of thing.

01:46:09.235 --> 01:46:09.996
And we find these

01:46:10.885 --> 01:46:12.746
abnormalities in a lot of tumors.

01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:18.209
We're also finding spike protein in the tumors months after vaccination.

01:46:18.529 --> 01:46:22.251
How can we know whether it's from the vaccine or from the virus?

01:46:23.311 --> 01:46:30.255
The vaccine has one of the base pairs of the genetic code is a pseudouridine.

01:46:30.315 --> 01:46:31.695
It's not really uridine.

01:46:32.276 --> 01:46:33.416
It's pseudouridine.

01:46:33.796 --> 01:46:34.156
Okay.

01:46:34.216 --> 01:46:37.358
Because RNA molecules are very, very, very fragile.

01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:41.102
and there's enough RNA enzymes on your hand.

01:46:41.903 --> 01:46:50.866
If you're just like working with no gloves and not under a laminar flow thing, you wonder why you don't have any RNA virus left.

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.761
It all got degraded like on the tinfoil that you were using.

01:46:56.301 --> 01:46:58.882
But if it's got a fear and cleavage site, then look out.

01:46:59.642 --> 01:47:01.082
See how stupid this is?

01:47:01.762 --> 01:47:04.443
It doesn't make any sense because it's a lie.

01:47:05.183 --> 01:47:07.844
Because these ideas are incongruent with one another.

01:47:07.884 --> 01:47:18.386
You're trying to tell a story that has no biological basis in reality, that RNA with the right set of bases can cause the production of proteins around the world.

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:22.260
and go endemic.

01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:41.726
This man is a monster, he's a liar, and he's working for the same deep state that Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci and Richard Ebright and Robert Malone and Merrill Nass and Mary Holland, they all work for the same national security operation in America.

01:47:44.072 --> 01:47:45.953
and it just got chewed up.

01:47:46.773 --> 01:47:52.255
So to make it resistant to these environmental RNAs, and your body has a lot of them floating around.

01:47:52.275 --> 01:48:01.078
This guy is actually an advisor to the Thorpe-led My Cycle Story website.

01:48:01.118 --> 01:48:10.242
The My Cycle Story website is put together by two probably meddler ladies, and they chose to work with

01:48:11.342 --> 01:48:16.444
Thorpe and with Hatfill on that project, which is just, of course, ridiculous.

01:48:16.604 --> 01:48:19.585
I'm just looking for stuff like that to chew up.

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:30.269
So to make that resistant and prolong its stay inside the cell, making a spike protein, they put an altered base pair in it.

01:48:30.549 --> 01:48:33.110
And now you find out you can't tear the thing apart.

01:48:33.611 --> 01:48:36.332
It lasts for at least a couple of years in some people.

01:48:36.772 --> 01:48:37.012
Wow.

01:48:37.652 --> 01:48:39.453
But why does he say base pair?

01:48:40.731 --> 01:48:45.134
There are no base pairs in a single stranded RNA molecule.

01:48:46.695 --> 01:48:49.817
Excuse my language, but what the fuck is this guy talking about?

01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:52.939
Do you see how awful this is?

01:48:53.339 --> 01:48:57.862
He is not even, he's not even keeping his shit straight.

01:48:57.902 --> 01:48:59.703
That's how bad they are right now.

01:48:59.763 --> 01:49:01.424
How bad we have pushed them.

01:49:01.985 --> 01:49:03.946
They can't even keep their shit straight.

01:49:06.748 --> 01:49:08.489
So do we know, have,

01:49:09.045 --> 01:49:15.349
These tests been done to sort out whether it's the spike from the vaccine versus the spike from the virus.

01:49:15.369 --> 01:49:19.132
My understanding it is a spike from the vaccine.

01:49:19.232 --> 01:49:25.596
How would the methylation of the mRNA have anything to do with the spike from the vaccine or the spike from the virus?

01:49:26.557 --> 01:49:27.598
That's just stupid.

01:49:27.658 --> 01:49:29.579
Why would she even ask that question?

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.080
That's just stupid.

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.083
She asked that question because she was fricking scripted to ask it.

01:49:35.363 --> 01:49:36.024
Stop lying.

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:39.225
Wow.

01:49:39.765 --> 01:49:51.887
I don't want to talk too much about pre-published material, but studies are now have definitive evidence that this is jumping in to select chromosomes.

01:49:52.727 --> 01:49:57.648
What is the propensity for the virus to do any of this, aside from the vaccines?

01:49:58.148 --> 01:50:04.010
We're not having a dramatic cancer association with just the virus.

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:06.390
That's my understanding, but we are,

01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:09.224
with the vaccinated people.

01:50:10.124 --> 01:50:17.066
And you're finding this vaccinated induced spike protein in the cancer cells.

01:50:17.686 --> 01:50:19.947
And this has already been published.

01:50:20.067 --> 01:50:22.328
We can find this information out there.

01:50:22.348 --> 01:50:25.629
Because people are going to write to me and say, where can I see this?

01:50:25.649 --> 01:50:27.010
There's a few papers out there.

01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:30.851
Some are done in tissue culture.

01:50:31.511 --> 01:50:32.411
That's an old paper.

01:50:32.451 --> 01:50:33.692
They'll be able to find that.

01:50:33.972 --> 01:50:34.252
OK.

01:50:34.952 --> 01:50:36.413
I think it was done in liver cells.

01:50:37.506 --> 01:50:43.669
Like really early on, 2021, I could probably haul up a reference, you know, if I go back and look.

01:50:44.009 --> 01:50:44.309
Okay.

01:50:44.389 --> 01:50:45.750
We can do that later.

01:50:46.170 --> 01:50:46.490
Yeah.

01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:57.555
So, and now we've got actual autopsy material that's, you know, being analyzed and stained and you can see this stuff in the tissues.

01:50:58.275 --> 01:51:05.378
If COVID is considered a bioweapon, who would possess the antidote if one exists and does one exist?

01:51:06.772 --> 01:51:07.973
There is nothing for this.

01:51:08.674 --> 01:51:08.975
Nothing.

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.098
There's nothing for this!

01:51:15.609 --> 01:51:15.949
Wow.

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:17.850
I mean, I'm not going to waste too much time on that.

01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:19.551
I still got some show to do here.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:25.615
So I just want to be sure that you understand how easily this could have been done.

01:51:26.035 --> 01:51:32.079
Just imagine a team of performers on a script with a known rise in all cause mortality on the way.

01:51:32.739 --> 01:51:41.405
And then they orchestrated all the performers necessary, all the laws and all the administrative things got ready before the pandemic.

01:51:41.445 --> 01:51:42.525
They put people in place.

01:51:42.545 --> 01:51:44.687
They even killed Brandy Vaughn just to make sure.

01:51:45.307 --> 01:51:55.296
that this would stay on the rails and that people would accept the novel virus that was killing millions of people, not the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality around the Western world.

01:51:56.144 --> 01:52:01.788
But a virus was killing all these old people in homes and in the hospital and occasionally a young person.

01:52:02.228 --> 01:52:07.571
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, they lied to us about an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:52:07.991 --> 01:52:16.477
And that's the reason why this report found in the link stuff at my website came out in 2025 and not in 2020, you know, or 2018 when this disaster could have been graphically visible.

01:52:21.809 --> 01:52:33.113
So they did it using a long list of crafty ways, but the number one way was anybody that came into a hospital could have been offered supplementary oxygen if their pulse ox was below 96.

01:52:34.273 --> 01:52:37.715
And that is precisely the protocol of the FLCCC in 2020.

01:52:39.295 --> 01:52:41.876
It's also the protocol of Richard Fleming in 2020.

01:52:42.216 --> 01:52:44.637
If you have a low pulse ox, you should go to the hospital.

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:56.903
And if you went to the hospital with a low pulse ox and they gave you pure supplementary oxygen in your nose or with a mask, a certain percentage of those people would develop ARDS, possibly pneumonia.

01:52:57.063 --> 01:53:05.007
And if it was labeled as COVID and not treated with antibiotics because it is a viral syndrome, then that's murder.

01:53:06.226 --> 01:53:07.967
That's what happened to Grace Shara.

01:53:08.007 --> 01:53:10.049
That's what happened to Leslie Batts' husband.

01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:22.377
That's what happened to a lot of people that are not being held, are not being brought to justice because of these meddlers that will not look back at 2020 and identify the obvious signal of murder that it is.

01:53:23.978 --> 01:53:24.999
And that is by design.

01:53:25.039 --> 01:53:27.681
That's why all these doctors like, like even,

01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:30.191
Andrew Kaufman can't figure it out.

01:53:30.251 --> 01:53:31.772
Tom Cowan can't figure it out.

01:53:31.812 --> 01:53:36.775
The Bailey's, they're two doctors that have kids together and they can't figure it out.

01:53:38.756 --> 01:53:41.197
And that is by design, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:41.237 --> 01:53:42.718
You gotta get off social media.

01:53:42.758 --> 01:53:46.400
That's the reason why these people have this power and why they were able to pull this off.

01:53:47.001 --> 01:53:50.062
If we weren't on social media- We will not call autism.

01:53:50.203 --> 01:53:51.743
I don't like the word autism.

01:53:52.544 --> 01:53:53.544
He was vaccine damaged.

01:53:53.805 --> 01:53:55.806
Brian Hooker would not be able to lie to us.

01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:04.208
If we were not on social media, Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass would not be able to lie to us about autism spectrum disorder.

01:54:05.509 --> 01:54:11.436
Suzanne Humphreys would not be able to lie to us about autism spectrum disorder.

01:54:12.762 --> 01:54:18.205
And not only that, but Pauly Tommy would not be able to lie to us about autism spectrum disorder.

01:54:18.645 --> 01:54:21.906
And the real fear and cleavage site would be visible.

01:54:21.926 --> 01:54:22.867
I don't want to lie.

01:54:23.347 --> 01:54:24.688
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:54:24.808 --> 01:54:25.848
I try not to be a liar.

01:54:25.868 --> 01:54:26.708
I don't want to be a liar.

01:54:27.289 --> 01:54:28.869
I think it's like really important.

01:54:32.471 --> 01:54:33.351
That's how we got here.

01:54:34.632 --> 01:54:36.173
That's why these people are involved.

01:54:37.273 --> 01:54:38.874
That's why these people are involved.

01:54:38.994 --> 01:54:40.855
That's why this clown is involved.

01:54:41.937 --> 01:54:43.258
It's all one malevolent show.

01:54:43.318 --> 01:54:44.699
It's out of their control now.

01:54:44.959 --> 01:54:45.900
It is now breaking.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.221
That's why they have to go this far.

01:54:48.962 --> 01:54:53.925
And they have gone this far to actually now try to put three people around Mary Bowden.

01:54:53.945 --> 01:55:08.495
They're putting Natalie, or sorry, Naomi Wolf, Sasha Latapova, and Shannon Joy around Mary Talley Bowden to try and make her part of their narrative against Robert Malone.

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:09.756
It's happening right now.

01:55:10.456 --> 01:55:15.401
It's actually the deepest level this bullshit has ever reached.

01:55:16.461 --> 01:55:22.547
I am shocked at this team of performers and their absolutely limitless ability to lie.

01:55:23.891 --> 01:55:30.613
It is scripted bullshit that you cannot possibly understand unless you work hard to understand the history of these people.

01:55:31.073 --> 01:55:35.014
You gotta go all the way back to 2013 to find Brian Hooker still telling the truth.

01:55:35.454 --> 01:55:42.796
You gotta go all the way back to 2015 to find when Mary Holland and Paul Offit started the show together.

01:55:42.816 --> 01:55:51.038
You gotta go all the way back to 2016 to find out when ICANN started on April Fool's Day and when the Vax movie was put out.

01:55:52.022 --> 01:56:05.276
You gotta go all the way back to 2018 if you wanna know when finally they convinced RFK to focus on vaccines by changing the World Mercury Project to the Children's Health Defense with Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker.

01:56:05.796 --> 01:56:11.902
You gotta go back to 2019 to find times when these people were all putting this narrative out.

01:56:12.623 --> 01:56:13.184
Mikovits.

01:56:14.434 --> 01:56:29.606
James Lyons-Weiler, Mary Holland, Brian Hooker, all making the big top tent of health freedom, all unable to tell you that intramuscular injection is not medicine, but instead that it's some component of the injections that's the problem.

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:37.817
You gotta go back to 2020 before you're gonna find any reference to Brandy Vaughn, and then not after her death, just before.

01:56:38.297 --> 01:56:52.670
And you're gonna have to go back to 2020 if you wanna hear a video where Brian Hooker is telling you that COVID is real, that it spreads asymptomatically, that we should wear masks, that the antibodies are a sign of immunity, and that they're not testing the vaccine enough.

01:56:56.391 --> 01:57:02.613
And of course, there's five more years of performance of all these people that will reveal them as part of this show.

01:57:03.274 --> 01:57:18.718
Reveal them as part of the elaborate military, paramilitary exercise to make sure that PCR is never questioned, that sequencing is never questioned, that endemicity is a process and an end state is never questioned, that gain of function is never questioned.

01:57:21.299 --> 01:57:24.180
This is what we've come to believe, that we're just humans.

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:33.408
that we descend from the same mud puddle, that pandemics are real and we can even make them, and that intramuscular injection is the best medicine ever.

01:57:33.728 --> 01:57:36.492
And these are all absolutely positively lies.

01:57:38.592 --> 01:57:41.493
It's been a long, strange trip learning this stuff.

01:57:41.753 --> 01:57:48.154
I've learned it the hard way, but I do know that Bad Biology 101 is what we need to dispel, what we need to work against.

01:57:48.954 --> 01:57:50.094
Thank you very much for being here.

01:57:50.114 --> 01:57:56.335
I will see you again in the second half in about, let's say, I don't know, one song.

01:57:56.555 --> 01:57:57.816
I don't even know what I'm going to play.

01:57:57.856 --> 01:57:58.756
What was I going to play?

01:57:58.996 --> 01:58:00.576
Oh my gosh, I'm under pressure now.

01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:01.076
I didn't know.

01:58:01.636 --> 01:58:03.817
I didn't have anything here selected.

01:58:05.957 --> 01:58:06.338
Darn it.

01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.982
No, I didn't have anything selected.

01:58:12.503 --> 01:58:15.206
What do I use?

01:58:15.386 --> 01:58:16.247
I don't know what to do.

01:58:17.228 --> 01:58:19.049
This is really hard when you have to do this.

01:58:19.230 --> 01:58:23.834
Oh my gosh, what do I do?

01:58:23.994 --> 01:58:24.915
I could wuss out.

01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:26.416
That's kind of wussing out.

01:58:28.678 --> 01:58:29.199
How about that?

01:58:29.319 --> 01:58:29.919
That's a good one.

01:58:29.959 --> 01:58:31.000
Maybe we'll just do this one.

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:31.481
See you in a minute.

01:59:07.065 --> 01:59:10.909
All the faces that he sees, damn, I can't hate them for me, yeah.

01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:13.591
Oh, yeah.

01:59:13.872 --> 01:59:17.976
Oh, no, my friend, he can't help when he's happy.

01:59:18.016 --> 01:59:18.816
He looks insane.

02:00:32.610 --> 02:00:35.025
Far between all illegal, all the same

02:02:32.507 --> 02:02:34.468
Oh, he don't know.

02:02:35.408 --> 02:02:38.369
So he takes his life away, yeah.

02:02:39.949 --> 02:02:48.592
Someday, yeah, he'll begin his life again.

02:02:50.352 --> 02:02:51.953
Oh, whisper in his ear.

02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:29.833
You purify a virus by, um... Um... That was the crappiest cut ever.

02:03:29.953 --> 02:03:30.834
Sorry about that.

02:03:30.914 --> 02:03:31.334
Darn it.

02:03:31.934 --> 02:03:36.816
You purify a virus by making a lot of... I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

02:03:37.616 --> 02:03:47.420
I don't understand what the issue... Well, they interchanged the two, and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

02:03:48.993 --> 02:03:51.754
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

02:03:54.295 --> 02:03:56.215
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:03:56.235 --> 02:04:02.337
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:04:02.417 --> 02:04:04.478
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:04:08.719 --> 02:04:11.400
All righty then, let me get over here.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.640
Bing-bo-bang-boom.

02:04:14.051 --> 02:04:16.634
Welcome to the second half of the show, ladies and gentlemen.

02:04:16.654 --> 02:04:24.542
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief, brought to you by a biologist and brought to you by all those people on the left side of the screen over there.

02:04:26.104 --> 02:04:30.949
And yes, if you want to share the stream, please share that stream.gigaom.bio there.

02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:32.090
And

02:04:33.123 --> 02:04:35.224
I'm drinking a lot of water, so that's why I sound like I'm burping.

02:04:35.685 --> 02:04:43.409
The gigaohmhq at proton.me is my wife's address for updates and for getting notified of the stream today.

02:04:43.449 --> 02:04:46.131
I think she sent it out about 10 minutes early, but she still sent something.

02:04:47.072 --> 02:04:48.332
So thanks very much for being here.

02:04:48.352 --> 02:04:50.114
I just want to warn you.

02:04:53.015 --> 02:04:59.659
So what we have here and what I want to demonstrate, show you here is actually just very recently, like in the last 24 hours,

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:22.136
It has orchestrated on X, of course, that Robert Malone is now having a conflict with Naomi Wolf, Mary Talley Bowden, Shannon Joy, and Sasha Latapova, who have decided to get together and write a letter to Robert Malone pleading with him to tell Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:05:22.236 --> 02:05:24.618
to ban the mRNA platform.

02:05:25.749 --> 02:05:35.216
And Robert Malone has lashed out on X to say that there is a group of liberal women who's trying to fracture the Maha movement.

02:05:35.676 --> 02:05:44.442
And now, I know that my studio audience is going to find that really funny, but actually that is how this works.

02:05:45.483 --> 02:05:50.106
Up until now, these false rivalries and fake

02:05:50.885 --> 02:05:54.366
you know, arguments have been part of a script that we were not aware of.

02:05:54.426 --> 02:06:08.709
But once you understand that Robert Malone doesn't sue anybody that he doesn't want you to watch, Robert Malone doesn't post any links that he doesn't want you to click on, then you realize that for a very long time we've been being played.

02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:20.331
And now the only question is, can you remember that Sasha Latupova was on stage in January of 2023 with Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mike Palmer and Asim Malhotra?

02:06:21.519 --> 02:06:36.048
And can you see that there is no way that that international trip to Stockholm, Sweden occurred because at one point in time, Meryl Ness and Sasha Latupova and Robert Malone were all good travel hotel buddies, and now they're not.

02:06:38.829 --> 02:06:41.971
This is absolutely the end of this show.

02:06:41.991 --> 02:06:44.013
In the Third Reich.

02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:47.450
you know, prior to the Holocaust.

02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:49.872
I mean, this is systematic killing.

02:06:50.252 --> 02:07:01.439
And these mRNA shots, Brad, not only have they approved now another mRNA COVID booster, but they have hundreds of mRNA shots in the hopper.

02:07:01.819 --> 02:07:03.580
And they had even fast tracked

02:07:04.225 --> 02:07:07.107
S-A-M-R-N-A, which is self-amplifying.

02:07:07.287 --> 02:07:08.728
Self-amplifying RNA.

02:07:08.748 --> 02:07:19.214
You know, the question that someone by the name of Karmadoc asked to Robert Malone and Lee Min Yan and Ryan Cole on stage in a church in 2021.

02:07:19.454 --> 02:07:20.494
Yeah, that stuff.

02:07:20.895 --> 02:07:21.495
mRNA.

02:07:22.035 --> 02:07:26.438
So this is why when I say to Dr. Robert Malone,

02:07:27.146 --> 02:07:38.155
He put out another tweet today, by the way, saying that there is a subversive group of liberal women who are looking to break apart and destroy Maha.

02:07:47.782 --> 02:07:49.724
But I know who he's talking about, right?

02:07:49.744 --> 02:07:55.289
And, you know, you can call me a lot of things, Dr. Malone, but you can't call me a liberal.

02:07:55.309 --> 02:07:57.311
That's one thing that I'm definitely not.

02:07:57.672 --> 02:08:00.635
And as I recall, I think Naomi Wolf is an ex-liberal.

02:08:00.655 --> 02:08:02.917
I have no idea what Mary Shelley Bowden is.

02:08:03.732 --> 02:08:06.974
And I have no idea what Sasha is either, but I mean- Ta-da!

02:08:07.374 --> 02:08:22.843
So those four people are now supposedly the opposition and the outspoken women that Robert Malone, this is a joke, but what you need to understand is that it's possible that Shannon Joy is just an idiot and just wants to be famous.

02:08:23.524 --> 02:08:30.148
It is possible that Mary Talley Bowden is fooled because she has been the focus of so many of these people's attention and work.

02:08:30.828 --> 02:08:32.289
just like I was years ago.

02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:35.112
And so I know how hard it is to see through it.

02:08:35.152 --> 02:08:40.836
If they're on signal together, if they're texting, if they're having dinners, this is a problem.

02:08:42.738 --> 02:08:43.679
And now this is fake.

02:08:44.599 --> 02:08:45.860
Stakes are too high.

02:08:45.981 --> 02:08:53.026
Grace Shara, all of these broken bodies, how many other babies and children are going to be injured and harmed?

02:08:53.106 --> 02:08:55.589
Grace Shara was harmed by the, by what?

02:08:56.601 --> 02:08:58.342
Do you see how awful this is?

02:08:58.962 --> 02:09:01.523
They were just talking about the mRNA a minute ago.

02:09:02.663 --> 02:09:11.626
How many people are going to develop turbo cancers and autoimmune disorders and neurological disorders and all of these things?

02:09:11.966 --> 02:09:18.748
It's not just that they're not achieving the goals that we sent them to Washington, D.C.

02:09:18.768 --> 02:09:19.288
to achieve.

02:09:19.688 --> 02:09:22.209
They are actually going backwards, right?

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:27.573
Because all of these other initiatives... If she's pissed, how does Brian Hooker feel?

02:09:28.734 --> 02:09:31.416
If she's pissed, then how does Polly feel?

02:09:35.318 --> 02:09:36.139
They don't care at all.

02:09:37.099 --> 02:09:38.060
And now you know it's fake.

02:09:39.621 --> 02:09:42.263
So there's an urgency, isn't there?

02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:46.133
Yeah, I mean, that's the whole thing.

02:09:46.213 --> 02:09:55.360
There is an urgency in particular for these people who are who are hanging on by a thread after four years, as I mentioned.

02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:59.523
What about all the autistic parents that have been hanging on a thread for like 20 years?

02:10:03.561 --> 02:10:09.145
What about all the people that bought into this health freedom movement that have been hanging on for years?

02:10:09.806 --> 02:10:11.867
Suffering with chronic fatigue for years.

02:10:12.088 --> 02:10:12.768
What about them?

02:10:12.788 --> 02:10:15.930
Because chronic fatigue existed before the pandemic.

02:10:18.552 --> 02:10:20.934
This is the worst kind of theater.

02:10:21.134 --> 02:10:25.258
Because I don't think this Brad Skitsmas is smart enough to know.

02:10:25.298 --> 02:10:29.701
He was part of the Rescue the Republic bullshit.

02:10:31.713 --> 02:10:36.878
I didn't want to show you this other than to show it to you so that you know that I know that it's going on.

02:10:36.938 --> 02:10:40.322
This is the joke of jokes right now.

02:10:41.062 --> 02:10:49.271
And all you need to do is get off social media and stop paying attention to these people and they will vanish because they are only shown to people who need to see them.

02:10:49.311 --> 02:10:50.412
They're only on Rumble.

02:10:52.639 --> 02:10:59.565
They're never gonna be anywhere else because it's scripted bullshit that is provided to you by social media programming.

02:10:59.585 --> 02:11:01.466
It is not provided to everyone.

02:11:02.007 --> 02:11:04.249
This truths are not getting out.

02:11:04.369 --> 02:11:07.611
They are being compartmentalized on social media.

02:11:08.152 --> 02:11:11.715
Absolutely and positively compartmentalized on social media.

02:11:12.515 --> 02:11:13.416
What did I do again?

02:11:13.436 --> 02:11:14.457
Did I screw something up?

02:11:14.537 --> 02:11:15.358
Yes, I did.

02:11:15.458 --> 02:11:16.218
What happened here?

02:11:17.119 --> 02:11:18.080
That should just play.

02:11:20.222 --> 02:11:21.583
I don't know why that didn't just play.

02:11:22.014 --> 02:11:31.278
Okay, I'm going to take a very big risk here and watch a video that I haven't even watched since I recorded it because I have faith that something is going to be revealed in it.

02:11:36.801 --> 02:11:38.282
Is it playing or what's going on here?

02:11:38.762 --> 02:11:41.323
Sorry, I thought, oh, cannot play media.

02:11:41.423 --> 02:11:42.304
Oops, that's bad.

02:11:43.464 --> 02:11:43.644
Hmm.

02:11:44.124 --> 02:11:45.145
Why is that not playing?

02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:49.440
Cannot play media.

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:54.181
Okay, well I'll have to do that outside of the thing then, because I know I can do it out here.

02:11:55.341 --> 02:11:56.282
Maybe it's just too big.

02:11:56.302 --> 02:11:58.822
Here we go.

02:12:05.183 --> 02:12:06.424
You should hear the sound soon.

02:12:06.444 --> 02:12:07.384
I'm going to fix this.

02:12:10.424 --> 02:12:11.125
Is there sound?

02:12:11.165 --> 02:12:12.685
I hope there's sound to this thing.

02:12:15.665 --> 02:12:16.966
I'm still getting it on the screen.

02:12:17.026 --> 02:12:17.646
I apologize.

02:12:18.652 --> 02:12:18.952
Right here.

02:12:20.633 --> 02:12:21.274
There we go.

02:12:23.015 --> 02:12:24.676
Rodney is not a supporter anymore.

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:26.117
Greg's not a supporter anymore.

02:12:27.618 --> 02:12:29.139
Piper is not a supporter anymore.

02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:30.820
Just so you know, this was a little while ago.

02:12:33.602 --> 02:12:36.044
I don't know if there's no sound or what's going on here.

02:12:36.664 --> 02:12:38.806
I gotta, I'm hoping there's sound.

02:12:39.046 --> 02:12:39.947
Oh yeah, of course there is.

02:12:44.659 --> 02:12:52.401
So this is a show that I did with Paul Alexander and Mike Eden, and I was really excited to get this show.

02:12:52.441 --> 02:12:57.822
But I have a feeling I'm going to see a struggling Mike Eden in this video, and it's going to be obvious that he's a liar.

02:13:01.803 --> 02:13:03.683
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

02:13:04.083 --> 02:13:07.044
Oh my gosh, the production on these shows is just...

02:13:10.831 --> 02:13:15.692
It's good reason to believe that people will start to intervene now to try and stop this information.

02:13:15.792 --> 02:13:21.994
Don't forget that I used to have this nodule on my throat that I could not sleep, and I was having a hard time breathing.

02:13:22.034 --> 02:13:30.056
I couldn't play basketball when I actually started playing them with my sons, because this nodule on my vocal cords, and I coughed it out.

02:13:30.116 --> 02:13:32.277
I still have it in a bottle up there.

02:13:33.057 --> 02:13:34.657
Oh, I hear one.

02:13:34.677 --> 02:13:36.498
I'm very excited.

02:13:41.929 --> 02:14:09.494
yeah looks like uh alexander's got his dr alexander has his i.t person with him so it's fine excellent piece of card it's a terrible thing that technology crap here we go this is pretty funny that technology crap is terrible paul don't let it frustrate you so grateful that first of all i would interview with you and that i would but capital must be out to each other's pockets

02:14:10.379 --> 02:14:15.041
And they have to come up with the most creative ways of doing that.

02:14:15.501 --> 02:14:25.005
And somewhere in there, a lot of these people, I call them today grifters, they have lost sight of what this was about.

02:14:25.626 --> 02:14:26.486
It's not about you.

02:14:27.126 --> 02:14:31.188
This is about informing people, sharing information.

02:14:31.948 --> 02:14:32.609
You know what I mean?

02:14:34.344 --> 02:14:50.261
etc so i found i found myself in in interviews where this guy was this guy was at my house interviewing me after five minutes this guy was at my house this year in february

02:14:52.113 --> 02:14:53.574
Don't think I'm screwing around here.

02:14:53.754 --> 02:15:13.892
Every one of these bastards has been to my house to try and influence me, to lie to me, to pretend that they're going to help me, including this guy who had me on his substack a lot, the worst substack on substack, associating himself with me essentially in such a ridiculous way that nobody would take me seriously.

02:15:14.632 --> 02:15:18.115
Not that dissimilar from what Kevin McCairn did for 2020, 21, and 22.

02:15:21.544 --> 02:15:24.745
It's really easy to see it once you see it now out here.

02:15:25.145 --> 02:15:27.386
I realized, but wait, this is more about them than me.

02:15:27.766 --> 02:15:28.947
I couldn't even get to speak.

02:15:30.507 --> 02:15:31.148
You know what I mean?

02:15:31.168 --> 02:15:33.829
It's like they're advertising themselves.

02:15:34.209 --> 02:15:40.671
So you two have to be very careful because as you emerge properly, and I think rightfully.

02:15:42.572 --> 02:15:43.212
Look at this ego.

02:15:43.232 --> 02:15:45.653
You're going to find out that depending on your brand.

02:15:45.953 --> 02:15:47.914
It's ego attacking, depending on your.

02:15:50.768 --> 02:15:53.130
You see how excited I am to talk to Mike Eden?

02:15:53.170 --> 02:15:54.430
I didn't think he was gonna show up.

02:15:56.812 --> 02:15:59.915
I thought that this was gonna be the time when we were gonna break it right now.

02:15:59.955 --> 02:16:04.038
If I could explain what I knew to Mike Eden, it was gonna be over.

02:16:04.098 --> 02:16:05.479
Hello, Michael.

02:16:14.297 --> 02:16:16.899
I couldn't be happier right now.

02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.862
I've been waiting for this for it seems like three years.

02:16:21.104 --> 02:16:24.327
I did not start that recording.

02:16:24.727 --> 02:16:25.668
Understand that.

02:16:25.728 --> 02:16:28.331
I didn't even notice this, but I didn't start that recording.

02:16:28.391 --> 02:16:29.111
Mike Eden did.

02:16:31.374 --> 02:16:32.134
I clicked it away.

02:16:32.515 --> 02:16:33.676
Holy shit.

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:36.902
Holy shit.

02:16:38.203 --> 02:16:40.424
I'm not the scientist you are.

02:16:40.444 --> 02:16:41.745
I mean, you read lots of papers.

02:16:41.925 --> 02:16:45.048
I'm not an academic and I'm usually miles off the pace.

02:16:45.528 --> 02:16:51.473
I'm not the scientist you are is exactly the same shit that every one of these other people has said to me.

02:16:52.794 --> 02:16:58.898
From Steve Kirsch to Robert Malone to, well, Robert Malone never said that to me.

02:16:58.958 --> 02:17:00.760
I was thinking Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:17:02.364 --> 02:17:07.045
Even Meryl Nass said that to me, that, oh, I guess not everybody's as smart as you, Jay.

02:17:10.827 --> 02:17:11.707
Holy shit.

02:17:12.967 --> 02:17:14.268
I mean, it's already a goldmine.

02:17:15.048 --> 02:17:19.909
I might come up occasionally with a gem of a deduction, but that's probably the best I can do these days.

02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:24.771
You were the one that held the lantern up and made me brave enough to read these papers, my friend.

02:17:25.191 --> 02:17:26.291
Well, there you go.

02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:26.951
Okay, yeah.

02:17:27.612 --> 02:17:28.872
I'm almost crying.

02:17:31.550 --> 02:17:40.676
These people should be so ashamed of themselves and how they misled the earth, or the people that were dumb enough to try and chase them on social media.

02:17:40.696 --> 02:17:42.117
They should be so ashamed.

02:17:42.137 --> 02:17:48.200
I always say to people, it wasn't really courage.

02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:57.326
And that's because in a heartbeat, almost, when I realized, basically when lockdown happened,

02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:00.572
I knew at that point I could outline why I knew it.

02:18:01.212 --> 02:18:05.715
I knew this meant totalitarian tyranny and depopulation.

02:18:06.375 --> 02:18:10.077
But I'm good at that, making deductions from very little data.

02:18:10.477 --> 02:18:12.679
I was certain that's what it meant.

02:18:13.199 --> 02:18:25.286
And it's because 60 countries at once did something that made no sense, that did not match their own pandemic preparedness plans, and was counter to common sense, and was destructive.

02:18:25.787 --> 02:18:26.307
And that meant

02:18:26.977 --> 02:18:29.359
since it wouldn't help anyone but would damage business.

02:18:29.759 --> 02:18:35.302
That meant the people who own money and capital must have approved the operation.

02:18:36.803 --> 02:18:44.068
And since that means they're not doing it for monetary reasons, since they sit astride the money creation process, must be another reason.

02:18:44.729 --> 02:18:51.253
And very quickly, we knew they were talking about vaccine passports with that ghastly Tony Blair and other people.

02:18:51.744 --> 02:18:58.047
And I just put it all together, digital ID, everywhere will be a restricted threshold.

02:18:59.668 --> 02:19:02.469
And I knew vaccines made no sense.

02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:08.752
You can't vaccinate against, you can't vaccinate using an injected vaccine against an inhaled pathogen.

02:19:08.772 --> 02:19:11.973
If you don't- Hey, there it is.

02:19:12.093 --> 02:19:13.994
So that's- They can't work, but you know.

02:19:14.014 --> 02:19:17.716
That's the actual narrative that we just saw.

02:19:19.036 --> 02:19:28.843
Brett Weinstein do a podcast about this week and we saw Kevin McKernan tweet out loud about how you can never make mucosal immunity with an injection.

02:19:31.625 --> 02:19:45.314
And so that is a very limited spectrum of debate about intramuscular injection that doesn't really cover transfection at all, transformation at all, or the absurdity of intramuscular injection in general, but instead,

02:19:46.638 --> 02:19:51.686
suggests that the nuances of the immune system mean that you're not making immunity in the right place.

02:19:51.746 --> 02:19:53.929
So it doesn't really not work.

02:19:53.989 --> 02:19:56.252
It just doesn't work as they say it works.

02:19:59.717 --> 02:20:08.643
And this is where the malevolence of his little narrative starts, because his whole shtick is that natural immunity should count for something.

02:20:09.023 --> 02:20:11.805
That natural immunity can also be detected and measured.

02:20:12.225 --> 02:20:15.287
And that natural immunity means there's a frickin' novel virus.

02:20:15.827 --> 02:20:18.049
You traitor, Mike Yeadon.

02:20:20.370 --> 02:20:22.772
Generates ST cell memory.

02:20:23.696 --> 02:20:26.658
and at worst, circulating antibodies that don't penetrate the airway.

02:20:27.779 --> 02:20:30.961
I also knew that the Cochrane review is a flu vaccine.

02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:35.123
Who also said that the antibodies don't penetrate the airway?

02:20:35.604 --> 02:20:38.986
Dipshit Commander Joe Lee said that as well.

02:20:39.786 --> 02:20:40.627
Can you see it yet?

02:20:40.907 --> 02:20:42.288
Seems that they actually don't work.

02:20:42.508 --> 02:20:51.294
Probably, this is a thought, speculatively, but because the older, frailer people have less responsive immune systems.

02:20:52.435 --> 02:21:00.458
We've got an overlap problem here where the people who are most likely to die are the ones who are least capable of benefiting from the vaccine.

02:21:00.938 --> 02:21:01.798
I think that's true.

02:21:02.378 --> 02:21:08.801
And the people who could respond well to a vaccine if it was properly designed don't need it because they're able to throw it off.

02:21:08.941 --> 02:21:13.282
So a properly designed vaccine wouldn't work very well in old people.

02:21:14.183 --> 02:21:16.503
Well, that's some pretty stupid questioning, isn't it?

02:21:16.563 --> 02:21:18.444
That's some pretty stupid debating, isn't it?

02:21:18.504 --> 02:21:21.025
Those are pretty irrelevant questions, aren't they?

02:21:22.438 --> 02:21:24.439
Can you see how awful it is now?

02:21:25.419 --> 02:21:26.739
No wonder he needs notes.

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:38.402
And so, you know, and then also I've worked on mRNA and siRNA technologies just on the side.

02:21:38.542 --> 02:21:40.783
I had a postdoc doing some work on the side.

02:21:41.383 --> 02:21:41.783
Wait, what?

02:21:43.523 --> 02:21:46.524
He had a postdoc working on self-amplifying RNA?

02:21:49.105 --> 02:21:50.645
Just dropping that at random here?

02:21:51.570 --> 02:22:04.335
no conflicts of interest, no, that just means that he understands even more than he's claiming to understand, including about the manufacture of RNA and the use of that in transfection and the fricking fraudulence of virology in general.

02:22:04.455 --> 02:22:06.576
He's very much sophisticated enough to know.

02:22:07.037 --> 02:22:19.822
Just like Brian Hooker with his 16 years of experience transforming and transfecting plants is sophisticated enough to know that I was right in saying that transfection in healthy people in 2021 would be a fricking crime.

02:22:20.285 --> 02:22:22.726
And that was 12 years early before I'd left Pfizer.

02:22:23.207 --> 02:22:27.950
And we agreed it was hopelessly distant from prime time.

02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:33.953
We could not get the materials to penetrate cells in vivo.

02:22:34.293 --> 02:22:42.839
And so he's just basically saying that we didn't have electroporation, that we tried everything that Robert Malone did, and it didn't really work, just like it didn't work for Robert Malone.

02:22:43.299 --> 02:22:44.199
Holy shit.

02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.301
And we injected them, and then they went to the liver.

02:22:47.408 --> 02:22:51.671
Um, and if we inhaled them, they would, if we injected them, they went to the liver.

02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:52.592
No shit.

02:22:52.652 --> 02:22:55.253
Who's been reporting that since the beginning of the pandemic?

02:22:55.293 --> 02:22:55.894
That would be me.

02:22:57.455 --> 02:23:01.017
Because of course, one of the reasons why they say that is because that's where they go.

02:23:01.477 --> 02:23:05.940
Because as Brandy Vaughn can tell you, the liver is a detoxification organ.

02:23:08.922 --> 02:23:09.562
Wow.

02:23:10.403 --> 02:23:11.003
Wow.

02:23:11.103 --> 02:23:14.346
Break down or simply not penetrate epithelial cells.

02:23:14.386 --> 02:23:14.926
We were using.

02:23:16.573 --> 02:23:19.875
just to see if we could get a marker in and we couldn't do it.

02:23:20.255 --> 02:23:31.322
So when I heard a decade later that my former employer and others were rushing a vaccine using this technology to people, I knew it couldn't have been fixed.

02:23:31.422 --> 02:23:39.727
And I did several literature searches to look for the what was the magic bullet that arrived in the 10 years that I've missed, and there wasn't one.

02:23:39.907 --> 02:23:42.468
So I thought this is going to be dangerous.

02:23:42.548 --> 02:23:42.969
So yeah,

02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:47.794
Yeah, so I came in very early, but I say I worked it out.

02:23:48.255 --> 02:23:50.456
I didn't really work it out on March 23rd.

02:23:50.817 --> 02:23:59.604
I will say when I allowed myself to put the bits together in the summer, I could then retro date it to the lockdown.

02:23:59.644 --> 02:24:11.114
I realized I didn't need any new information beyond lockdown in the context of it being unprecedented and going on in multiple countries at the same time, which

02:24:11.741 --> 02:24:18.143
As I say, you don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to say, well, that's evidence of a supranational action.

02:24:18.603 --> 02:24:20.664
It's the only way it could possibly happen.

02:24:25.425 --> 02:24:32.748
If you're not ready for this, I don't know what to tell you, but I'm going to upload this video to my website in the Batcave and you can watch it there.

02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:37.863
but I want you to imagine what I say to Mike Eden and how he reacts to it.

02:24:37.943 --> 02:24:41.685
Because remember, I'm the scientist, I'm the one who's reading papers, not him.

02:24:45.188 --> 02:24:59.177
I'm not gonna waste any more of your time this afternoon, it's been a long show, but I will upload this video and I assure you, I haven't even watched it and I know for sure that I'm gonna tell him things and he's just gonna kinda shrug his shoulders and be like, I guess it could be, I don't know.

02:25:02.017 --> 02:25:02.857
I guess it could be.

02:25:02.957 --> 02:25:03.317
I don't know.

02:25:03.377 --> 02:25:07.758
He just told you that he had a postdoc working on self-amplified RNA.

02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:21.001
This is a collaborator of Sasha Latupova who wrote a detrimental shitty substack note about me a month ago.

02:25:22.582 --> 02:25:23.502
Calling me JJ.

02:25:26.038 --> 02:25:49.853
This is a malevolent part player in the same network as Nick Hudson and Jessica Hockett and Robert Malone and Ryan Cole and Pierre Corey, Meryl Nass, Mary Holland, Shannon Joy, Sasha Latipova, Naomi Wolf, and Claire Craig, and Kevin McKernan, and Charles Rixey, and Kevin McCairn.

02:25:50.882 --> 02:25:55.984
and Stephanie Seneff, and Steve Kirsch, and John Bodwin, and all of these people.

02:25:58.165 --> 02:26:00.466
It's one malevolent show.

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:07.768
And if you don't wake up to how malevolent this show is, your children will be enslaved by it.

02:26:09.829 --> 02:26:12.450
I don't know how to say it more succinctly than that.

02:26:16.078 --> 02:26:18.359
I don't know how to say it more succinctly than that.

02:26:18.819 --> 02:26:20.320
I'm really happy that everybody's here.

02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:25.822
I'm really, really happy it's Friday because as I hinted in the title, I'm getting tired of this.

02:26:26.102 --> 02:26:27.123
I can be very honest.

02:26:27.183 --> 02:26:36.026
I'm tired of having to explain how malevolent these myths are and how none of them are making any progress in understanding the basis of this myth.

02:26:36.847 --> 02:26:40.628
And that is by design because you cannot find their ghosts using their tests.

02:26:41.008 --> 02:26:42.229
It doesn't make you a Ghostbuster.

02:26:44.377 --> 02:27:07.080
It's a background signal, an irreducibly complex background signal that they've simplified using nonspecific PCR tests and placebos to lie to you about the biological potential of RNA, to lie to you about the medicinal potential of intramuscular injections, to lie to you about the medicinal potential of transfection, and lie to you about the

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:11.863
insignificance of population pyramids as a problem needing solving.

02:27:12.403 --> 02:27:13.164
I love you very much.

02:27:13.404 --> 02:27:14.965
I will see you again on Monday.
