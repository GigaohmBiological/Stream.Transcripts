WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
I put this on sub stack.

00:02.280 --> 00:05.120
I have about 16,000 followers on sub stack,

00:05.120 --> 00:08.160
and I'm gaining a lot of traction right now

00:08.160 --> 00:10.120
on Rumble as well.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.040
So, just so you know.

00:13.040 --> 00:13.880
Fantastic.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.280
I mean, I haven't posted as much on Rumble as I should.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.320
Twitch ended up being a place to hide,

00:21.280 --> 00:23.200
but it's worked out okay.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.440
Okay, I'm ready.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.280
All right.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.640
Dr. Cooley, welcome to the Medical Truth Podcast.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.240
How are you doing today?

00:35.240 --> 00:36.360
Very fine to meet you.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.080
Thank you very much for having me.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.720
I, like I said in the beginning, I could be worse.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.040
Nice day today, so I'm happy.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.000
Good, good.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.080
So, share with the viewers and listeners

00:47.080 --> 00:49.160
of the Medical Truth Podcast

00:49.160 --> 00:51.800
as to who you are and what you do.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.560
Okay, my name is Jonathan Cooley.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.720
I've been an academic or used to be an academic biologist

00:57.760 --> 00:59.640
for about 22 years.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.680
I was a wannabe doctor for a long time

01:05.680 --> 01:08.520
when I was a teenager and a young adult.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.600
I detoured into high school teaching

01:10.600 --> 01:13.080
while I was trying to get into med school.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.920
And then I actually stumbled into research biology

01:16.920 --> 01:20.160
as a side job, thinking that eventually

01:20.160 --> 01:21.360
I was gonna go to med school,

01:21.360 --> 01:24.240
but I discovered very quickly

01:24.280 --> 01:28.320
that I really enjoyed academic biological research.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.920
And so I did it for a couple of years

01:30.920 --> 01:33.280
using a microscope and doing all kinds of things

01:33.280 --> 01:35.320
that I thought were really fun.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.200
And that led me to being invited to do my PhD

01:39.200 --> 01:40.840
in the Netherlands with somebody who I met

01:40.840 --> 01:42.080
at the University of Chicago

01:42.080 --> 01:47.080
during this little research assistant job.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.880
And so I did my PhD in the Netherlands.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.560
This was after a long time living in Chicago

01:53.560 --> 01:55.920
as an adult, not knowing what I wanted to do.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.360
So I moved to the Netherlands when I was 31 years old

02:00.360 --> 02:02.240
to do my PhD.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.600
And it was there during my PhD in neurobiology,

02:06.600 --> 02:10.320
studying mouse brains that I met my wife.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.960
We moved to Norway where I received more training

02:15.960 --> 02:19.160
in again, neurobiology and mouse brains and rat brains.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.440
And we lived in Norway for four years where we had two sons.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.040
We went back to the Netherlands to try to get tenure,

02:27.040 --> 02:28.920
again, just following my career.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.200
That didn't work out because the Netherlands

02:32.200 --> 02:34.080
is a pretty small country and I'm not Dutch

02:34.080 --> 02:37.140
and I didn't get an ERC grant, that's the way it works.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.480
And so I still had this ace in the hole

02:40.480 --> 02:41.440
where I was an American.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.680
So I brought my whole family back to Pittsburgh in 2016

02:45.680 --> 02:47.680
just in time for Trump to get elected.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.480
And we spent about three years working,

02:51.480 --> 02:54.320
I spent three years working at the University of Pittsburgh

02:54.320 --> 02:56.440
before the pandemic hit.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.320
And at that time, I was just rediscovering my love

02:59.320 --> 03:03.720
for teaching and I had sort of reinvigorated

03:03.720 --> 03:06.880
this love of teaching by starting a YouTube channel

03:06.880 --> 03:09.800
where I was doing Journal Club on my bicycle.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.120
I had about a nine mile commute to the University

03:13.120 --> 03:16.400
of Pittsburgh on an electric assisted bicycle.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.440
And so I started teaching,

03:19.080 --> 03:21.600
I started doing Journal Club on my bike.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.280
And when the pandemic started,

03:24.320 --> 03:27.520
I remembered that my postdoc in the Netherlands

03:27.520 --> 03:30.960
had been at the Erasmus University Medical Center

03:30.960 --> 03:34.160
in Rotterdam where they had enriched avian flu

03:36.520 --> 03:39.280
in 2012 while I was actually still there.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.680
And so I had heard some of these seminars

03:43.680 --> 03:45.560
and I heard people joke about what they're doing

03:45.560 --> 03:46.960
on the 17th floor.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.240
But it never really dawned on me that it didn't really matter.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.040
You know, I was a neurobiologist and I stuck to my thing

03:54.040 --> 03:57.000
and I was, you know, worried about my career.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.200
But then when this happened,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.720
it dawned on me that I'd heard this story before

04:01.720 --> 04:06.720
and I found a couple reasonably good reviews

04:07.480 --> 04:10.040
of coronavirus biology and I read them

04:10.040 --> 04:12.000
and then I read the papers that they cited

04:12.000 --> 04:13.920
and then I just decided to do a bike ride

04:13.960 --> 04:17.000
where I speculated about what might happen

04:17.000 --> 04:20.040
if a coronavirus were to get out of a laboratory

04:20.040 --> 04:24.520
and I did three bike rides on my YouTube channel

04:24.520 --> 04:27.720
where I described the history of coronavirus research,

04:27.720 --> 04:28.920
what we knew and what we didn't.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.480
I made lots of mistakes in the first couple of videos.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.120
But the third video was pretty good

04:34.120 --> 04:36.680
and that got the attention of my faculty

04:36.680 --> 04:39.760
and they actually told me that I shouldn't be speaking

04:39.760 --> 04:43.160
to any newspapers and that virology wasn't

04:43.160 --> 04:45.560
my expertise, okay?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.360
That was how they ended the email, okay?

04:47.360 --> 04:50.760
With a question mark and I don't know,

04:50.760 --> 04:55.760
I just kept questioning things and in October of 2020,

04:56.080 --> 05:00.680
I remember clearly seeing some video of Bill Gates

05:00.680 --> 05:04.280
over a lighted table explaining with little models

05:04.280 --> 05:06.720
how the newest vaccine was gonna work

05:06.720 --> 05:08.760
and I remember getting very angry and saying,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.960
that's not a vaccine, that's just transfection.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.480
That's what I do to my mice.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.160
So I think if you really put me in 2019

05:19.920 --> 05:21.560
or at the beginning of 2020,

05:21.560 --> 05:23.360
what you would find is a biologist

05:23.360 --> 05:27.720
who would give his kids all of his vaccines,

05:27.720 --> 05:30.520
you would find a biologist who respected

05:30.520 --> 05:35.120
the medical field and thought that being a doctor

05:35.120 --> 05:37.760
was the highest calling and had more respect

05:37.760 --> 05:40.440
for doctors than anybody else.

05:40.440 --> 05:45.440
I didn't have any inkling of the kind of corruption

05:45.680 --> 05:50.680
and mythology that modern medicine in America was based on.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.440
And when we moved here, I told you we had two children,

05:56.440 --> 05:58.680
we had our daughter here actually

05:58.680 --> 06:01.000
and on the day of her birth,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.880
when she got the first two shots of vitamin K

06:04.880 --> 06:09.520
and the hepatitis B shot, I was just shocked.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.280
And the only reason why I was shocked

06:11.280 --> 06:14.520
is because we had our first two kids in Norway

06:14.520 --> 06:16.800
where the childhood vaccination schedule

06:16.800 --> 06:20.840
is completely different and more importantly,

06:20.840 --> 06:24.240
they're not really interested in doing it quick.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.480
And in fact, if you give the doctors a plan

06:27.480 --> 06:31.240
of how you're gonna breastfeed your kid until X age,

06:31.240 --> 06:34.920
then any and all vaccinations can be delayed.

06:34.920 --> 06:39.920
And so the way that they went about telling you

06:39.920 --> 06:41.320
how to care for your baby,

06:41.320 --> 06:43.880
the way they went about teaching you to care for your baby

06:43.880 --> 06:48.880
was one of sacredness and of purity

06:49.560 --> 06:52.040
and your baby is already perfect.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.160
And then to have a child in America

06:56.160 --> 06:58.600
and immediately see this huge contrast

06:58.600 --> 07:03.640
where two shots as soon as they came out

07:03.640 --> 07:06.880
and no talk of whether we do it

07:06.880 --> 07:08.240
or when we do it or whatever,

07:08.240 --> 07:11.240
I was my wife and I were in tears

07:11.240 --> 07:14.440
and we still didn't fully get it.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.600
It wasn't until 2022 that I started to really understand

07:18.600 --> 07:22.880
the depth and the breadth of the deception that was going on.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.880
So I don't wanna jump too far ahead.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.720
Yeah.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.080
And I think that's all.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.080
Yeah, I wanted to back up to 2019 and 20.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.160
So we're in a place where all of us are,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.880
at that time I still had the medical practice

07:36.880 --> 07:39.920
of bricks and mortar medical practice that was.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.160
And we hear the announcement of this coronavirus

07:44.160 --> 07:49.160
and I know at that time there was a lot of jokes about it

07:51.200 --> 07:53.720
with on social media,

07:53.720 --> 07:57.800
comparing it to the corona beer and all this other stuff.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
And then the media really got a hold of it.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.360
And I heard an interview where you said,

08:03.360 --> 08:06.640
you pretty much says, you start taking out old textbooks

08:06.640 --> 08:08.720
and start reading them and started going through

08:08.720 --> 08:10.680
and saying something's wrong here.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.720
So let's start there.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.680
Sure, so I think the first thing to keep in mind

08:16.680 --> 08:21.680
is that as a research faculty at a medical school,

08:22.840 --> 08:26.920
I was not confident of anything.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.520
I didn't know or think that I knew what I was talking about

08:30.520 --> 08:32.000
at the beginning of the pandemic.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.040
I was as taken aback as everybody else,

08:35.040 --> 08:40.040
but my immediate decision was that I had

08:40.040 --> 08:41.960
an immunology course a few years ago.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.120
Why can't I get that book out and start reading?

08:44.120 --> 08:47.000
Why can't I teach myself this immunology

08:47.000 --> 08:50.320
and see if I can figure out who's lying and who's not?

08:50.320 --> 08:54.600
And that might sound at rather arrogant,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.960
but you must remember, and I'm sure you do,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.720
that at the beginning of this pandemic,

08:58.720 --> 09:03.040
we were told by everyone that it was a novel virus

09:03.040 --> 09:05.240
and so we knew nothing about it.

09:05.240 --> 09:10.240
And that key admission was what made everything incongruent

09:11.960 --> 09:14.240
because in all the previous literature

09:14.240 --> 09:16.200
with the discussion of RNA viruses,

09:16.200 --> 09:21.080
there was much more of a discussion of general mechanisms

09:21.080 --> 09:26.240
by which your immune system rejects foreign genetic material

09:26.240 --> 09:30.320
and the different subtypes of viruses and stuff

09:30.320 --> 09:34.000
didn't matter so much with regard to the general mechanisms

09:34.000 --> 09:37.040
by which your body defends itself from these signals.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.960
And so that was the first clue that my nose

09:40.960 --> 09:42.240
was pointed in the right place

09:42.240 --> 09:45.360
because all of these papers from the 90s

09:45.360 --> 09:49.280
and the early 2000s around the original SARS

09:49.280 --> 09:52.920
stated very clearly that our immune memory

09:52.920 --> 09:55.680
to coronaviruses was broad,

09:55.680 --> 09:59.480
that our immune memory to coronavirus was dampened

09:59.480 --> 10:01.720
because the body seemed to understand

10:01.720 --> 10:04.920
that responding with a strong immune response

10:04.920 --> 10:08.640
to something like a coronavirus was the wrong way to go.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.760
And this also became corroborated

10:11.760 --> 10:17.080
with reading about veterinary vaccines in particular

10:17.080 --> 10:19.880
because veterinary vaccines as you're probably aware

10:19.880 --> 10:22.760
are much easier to throw out into the market.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.880
They're much easier to get out there

10:24.880 --> 10:28.040
and therefore there's a lot more anecdotal evidence

10:28.040 --> 10:31.680
of vaccine candidates just not working out.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.040
Right.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.360
I do have a question for you.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.360
So they did announce it was a novel coronavirus, right?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.120
Because I did the same thing you did.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.480
I pulled out books.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.080
I started reading articles online

10:48.080 --> 10:50.520
that were not quite censored yet.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.840
And I started reading about a little bit of a history

10:52.840 --> 10:57.840
on the coronavirus in that it had been around since 1963.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.320
I read it out of the National Institute of Health's publication

11:03.320 --> 11:08.320
and that some of the vectors and carriers of it are animals,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.080
right?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.920
So it wasn't anything new, right?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.840
The coronavirus wasn't anything new.

11:16.120 --> 11:21.120
And then we personally experienced it in 2003 and 2004

11:21.560 --> 11:25.680
in the fall of those years because that was a flu season.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.840
It was a real bad flu season at that time.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.840
So the public obviously was kind of blindsided

11:34.240 --> 11:35.960
with this announcement by the media.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.840
And then of course, as you know, and I know and everybody,

11:38.840 --> 11:41.920
the media kind of grabbed the narrative

11:41.920 --> 11:46.920
and then you had these news reporters, these media people,

11:51.760 --> 11:54.040
who were trying to control the narrative

11:54.040 --> 11:59.040
along with these other pillars that medical, pharmaceutical

11:59.320 --> 12:00.120
and all this other stuff.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.960
So go ahead, you're back to where you were.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.960
No, so I think that's really the heart of this

12:08.040 --> 12:12.520
is to understand that in order for the entire mythology

12:12.520 --> 12:15.800
of the pandemic to take hold,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.640
the very first thing they had to establish in everybody's mind

12:18.640 --> 12:20.640
was that this was a new thing

12:20.640 --> 12:22.320
that nobody had seen it before

12:22.320 --> 12:24.920
and therefore everybody was equally vulnerable.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.680
And that of course was a terrible exaggeration,

12:30.680 --> 12:35.680
irrespective of how exactly the pathogen was present,

12:38.040 --> 12:40.240
or not present and how fast it was spreading

12:40.240 --> 12:43.320
or where it actually was, the idea,

12:43.320 --> 12:46.480
the biological concept that there is an RNA virus

12:46.480 --> 12:49.360
for which all of us are vulnerable

12:49.360 --> 12:51.640
because we've never seen it before,

12:51.640 --> 12:54.760
only applies to babies that are born right now.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.920
After that, like you're already in the world

12:57.920 --> 13:00.280
and your immune system is already interacting.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.960
And so just the concept of an RNA molecule

13:04.960 --> 13:07.360
that's so novel that our body can't deal with it

13:07.360 --> 13:09.520
is ridiculous.

13:09.520 --> 13:14.520
And that's really one side of this two-sided mythology.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.640
The other side of that mythology, of course,

13:17.640 --> 13:19.600
is the idea that an RNA molecule

13:19.600 --> 13:23.160
can successfully circle the planet all by itself.

13:23.160 --> 13:28.000
And I think that's probably where really

13:28.000 --> 13:29.440
the rubber meets the road for me

13:29.440 --> 13:31.520
because it took me two and a half years,

13:31.520 --> 13:33.480
almost three years to get to the stage

13:33.480 --> 13:36.760
where I was sophisticated enough to ask the right question.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.960
And with regard to 2019 and 2020,

13:40.960 --> 13:42.480
what they did to all of us,

13:42.480 --> 13:47.480
the smartest doctors, the most intrepid investigators,

13:47.720 --> 13:50.760
was convince us to ask the wrong question.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.240
And that wrong question is,

13:52.240 --> 13:55.520
is this a natural virus or is this a lab leak?

13:55.520 --> 14:00.520
And they made it seem like that was the heart of the matter.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.320
That's what we really had to figure out.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.800
And if we figured out that and we figured out who did it,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.280
then we would solve this mystery

14:07.280 --> 14:09.280
and we could set things straight.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.200
And that was a ruse.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.960
That was entirely a ruse.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.160
Yeah, and then if I remember correctly,

14:16.160 --> 14:19.600
it wasn't until like, I think it was March,

14:19.600 --> 14:22.440
well, actually it was April and May going into June,

14:22.440 --> 14:24.080
at least where I was located at the time

14:24.080 --> 14:26.800
I was living in Las Vegas, Nevada.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.800
And they didn't implement mask mandates

14:29.800 --> 14:33.520
until like about May, June, right?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.760
So that was kind of a weird tip off

14:35.760 --> 14:40.760
that something was not gelling correctly.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.760
The other thing too, is they always announced

14:44.760 --> 14:49.760
and parroted that if you contracted the coronavirus,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.200
you had a 98.5% chance of survival.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.920
And I've mentioned this so many times

14:54.920 --> 14:57.400
on so many different podcast episodes.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.800
But I don't want to get too far ahead

14:59.800 --> 15:02.000
because we're still at the mask mandates,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.640
we're still at the announcement of this

15:03.640 --> 15:06.640
and we're still at the narrative,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.280
the media narrative of controlling it,

15:09.280 --> 15:10.680
of controlling the narrative.

15:12.080 --> 15:16.560
And then, you know, the whole thing with the mask

15:16.560 --> 15:19.280
and I even have some video footage of some insanity

15:19.280 --> 15:21.200
where there was a lot of mixed messages.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.640
In fact, I'll just go ahead and go to one of the,

15:25.640 --> 15:29.600
this is back in, I believe 2020 or 2021.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.360
Hey, sir, I know you just exited work,

15:32.360 --> 15:34.240
but per government order,

15:34.240 --> 15:37.080
required to wear a mask when you're out in public.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.840
You got all the perfect, appreciate it.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.680
Thank you, sir.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.840
We made the decision collectively

15:43.840 --> 15:46.360
with the city council, with the city manager

15:46.360 --> 15:48.000
and the public safety director

15:48.000 --> 15:49.680
to step up the game a little bit

15:49.680 --> 15:52.480
and start to enforce the rules and regulations.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.240
And part of it with that enforcement

15:56.240 --> 15:59.400
is going out into the streets and talking to folks,

15:59.400 --> 16:02.240
but utilizing education as the key,

16:02.240 --> 16:03.760
education and persuasion.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.360
Hey, sir, just to inform you, you know,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.600
per government order, you're required

16:07.600 --> 16:10.240
to wear a face mask in the city of West Hollywood.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.080
Thank you, sir.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.040
We just came to inform you per government order.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.160
Once you are in a public setting,

16:17.160 --> 16:19.400
you are required to put on a face mask.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.120
Well, it's good thing, good thing, of course.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.840
Well, we should know that they have to wear a mask.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.840
We don't want to give out citations,

16:29.840 --> 16:33.840
but for people who absolutely refuse to wear a mask,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.840
I can guarantee you they are going to receive a citation.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
The first offense is $250,

16:38.840 --> 16:41.840
with a $50 administration administrative fee

16:41.840 --> 16:43.840
for a grand total of $300.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
Every time outside in public,

16:45.840 --> 16:47.840
we need to really have more.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.840
We're shooting citations now in West Hollywood

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
at 300 bucks a pop, so.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.840
Yeah, so that's a spectacular example

16:56.840 --> 17:00.840
of the kind of illusion of consensus

17:00.840 --> 17:02.840
that they created very early.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.840
So they forced people to choose

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
whether they wanted to conform or not.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.840
And that was very different than the biological impetus

17:11.840 --> 17:13.840
for wearing a mask has to protect yourself

17:13.840 --> 17:15.840
from droplets on other people.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.840
So I think that the thing that has become more apparent

17:20.840 --> 17:25.840
to me in retrospect is that the censorship

17:25.840 --> 17:28.840
and this kind of behavior, which you've just highlighted,

17:28.840 --> 17:31.840
which is that they didn't start with masks right away.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.840
They actually said masks don't work at first.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
Then they said they do work.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
Then they enforced it over the top.

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
Right.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.840
That, I think, is part of the ruse.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.840
If they had been prudent about it

17:43.840 --> 17:46.840
and they had been honest about it from the beginning,

17:46.840 --> 17:48.840
that wouldn't have been the pattern.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.840
That wouldn't have been honest and prudent

17:50.840 --> 17:51.840
about the censorship.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.840
The censorship wouldn't have had the pattern that it did.

17:54.840 --> 18:00.840
Well, I've got another in opposite of that of a sheriff

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
in a town in Ohio.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.840
I'll play that.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
Yeah.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
I'm here today.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.840
Our phone.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.840
We're getting calls.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.840
We're getting emails.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
We're getting texts.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.840
The governor has, I believe he's just completed

18:12.840 --> 18:16.840
the mandatory mask wearing for Butler County,

18:16.840 --> 18:18.840
several of the counties in the state of Ohio.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.840
It's going to be mandatory.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.840
The mask wearing.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.840
And I'm here to, we don't have the orders,

18:26.840 --> 18:29.840
what he's put out yet, but I can tell you this,

18:29.840 --> 18:32.840
that I want to make sure everybody understands.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.840
I am not the mask police.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.840
I am not going to enforce any mask wearing.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.840
That is not my responsibility.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.840
That is not my job.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.840
People should be able to make that choices themselves.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.840
I didn't put this order out.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.840
And it's getting to the point.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
People are scared.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
People are calling and asking.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.840
Do we have to wear the mask in our house, in our cars?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.840
It's getting kind of ridiculous.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.840
At this point, I believe, as the sheriff in Butler County,

19:04.840 --> 19:09.840
here in Ohio, the economy is starting to try to get back

19:09.840 --> 19:10.840
to where it was.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.840
You can't go to restaurants.

19:12.840 --> 19:16.840
At one time, you were looked down on if you tried to go to church

19:16.840 --> 19:21.840
and the churches were closed and it's totally out of control.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.840
It should be left up to the individual if they want to wear a mask.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
If someone's sick, I can understand the mask wearing.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.840
But for all of us to have to have your temperature taken,

19:31.840 --> 19:35.840
to have to wear a mask, where is it going to stop?

19:35.840 --> 19:38.840
I've checked with some people that I know that work in the hospitals,

19:38.840 --> 19:40.840
the hospital staffs.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.840
Most hospitals in Ohio have laid people off because of this.

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
They've laid people off.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.840
You go to the emergency room.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
You have to wait longer.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.840
There's people that are still not working because of it.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.840
And this makes it harder to wear these masks and for everyday citizens

19:56.840 --> 20:00.840
that aren't sick and have no symptoms, to have to wear a mask.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.840
I'm not a scientist, but I want you to know that the police are busy.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.840
Our budgets have been cut, the fire departments.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.840
Everybody has less just in the past few months.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.840
This does not make it better.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.840
What you have is don't call 911 because someone is not wearing a mask.

20:19.840 --> 20:24.840
If the health departments want to control and take care of who's not wearing a mask,

20:24.840 --> 20:29.840
let them put a little yellow light on their car and they can stop people and go in.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
They will not like the response.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.840
People are tired, they're wore out.

20:34.840 --> 20:39.840
I think we could have done this in a different way, but make no mistake about it.

20:39.840 --> 20:47.840
I, as the Butler County Sheriff, am not enforcing any mask wearing whatsoever to the public.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.840
And my deputies will not enforce it.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.840
We've got more important things to do.

20:51.840 --> 20:59.840
It's all we can do to keep up with fighting crime, locking people up and making sure they're safe and employees are safe.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
And there you go.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
There again, you see the same thing.

21:02.840 --> 21:07.840
The idea is to get people to argue about bad thing or bad thing.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.840
Should we put sand in sand park or escape parks?

21:11.840 --> 21:14.840
Should we close down playgrounds and basketball courts?

21:14.840 --> 21:19.840
Should we let kids play hockey on ponds in Canada?

21:19.840 --> 21:24.840
Was also a question that was enforced in a negative sense by the police.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.840
They didn't let kids play hockey on ponds in Canada.

21:28.840 --> 21:39.840
I mean, we created a scenario where we were arguing about ridiculous things so that we didn't argue about the real.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.840
And that's really what they got us to do.

21:41.840 --> 21:45.840
And the most enticing part of that was the lab leak or natural virus.

21:45.840 --> 21:57.840
But it also was lockdowns, masking kids, you know, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, all of these things are potential red herrings.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.840
Which keep us from looking at the novel virus with scrutiny.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
Right.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
Right.

22:03.840 --> 22:24.840
It created enough division that, in fact, on a massive scale to where it put people in such a quandary that they just couldn't process the relentless news reports from the so-called experts.

22:25.840 --> 22:34.840
You know, I remember listening to an episode of Tucker Carlson and he was interviewing Dr. Scott Atlas.

22:34.840 --> 22:53.840
And Dr. Scott Atlas was hired by Trump, President Trump to pretty much not so much replace Anthony Fauci, but be part of the hearings and when sitting in on the briefings I should say.

22:53.840 --> 23:05.840
And they would just totally just scoff at anything that he had to say or present to Birx and to Fauci.

23:05.840 --> 23:16.840
So there was just so many red flags that were just going up, up, up, up the whole time that I said, and I'm sure you two said something's wrong.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.840
Something's definitely wrong here.

23:19.840 --> 23:27.840
Definitely, but keep in mind, James, they played us really well because they had both sides performing.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.840
And there was one side that made sense to us a little bit.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
Right.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.840
And we were drawn to that side that made sense.

23:34.840 --> 23:39.840
And some people were drawn to the side of Tony Fauci, where it's got to be a natural virus.

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
Those people are crazy.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.840
Some people were drawn to this side.

23:42.840 --> 23:51.840
And it really depended on who you were tuning into, what your biases were, who you trusted, but there was a story for you to latch on to.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
Right.

23:52.840 --> 23:59.840
Either one that you latched on to, you were going to lose because they were being led by people who were never going to question the novelty of the virus.

23:59.840 --> 24:04.840
Never going to question the idea that we had to do something because it's an emergency.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.840
It's a national security priority.

24:07.840 --> 24:12.840
They weren't going to question the shot at the time when they could have questioned it.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.840
Right.

24:13.840 --> 24:18.840
And they were never going to question the possibility that a virus could come again because that's how they plan to do this forever.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Yeah.

24:19.840 --> 24:20.840
Yeah.

24:20.840 --> 24:26.840
So we're at 2019 and we're still trying to sort of frame where I was and where we were.

24:27.840 --> 24:39.840
And I think in 2020 in the beginning, it's important to mention that I got sucked into or invited into or participated in a group called drastic on Twitter.

24:39.840 --> 24:55.840
And this group of of Internet researchers was the group that is credited with finding the publications, including a PhD thesis and a master's thesis in Chinese that was done.

24:56.840 --> 25:12.840
On the minors that had originally died in 2012, exposed to the cave where this, the precursors of this virus were supposedly taken and certainly the cave that the WIV in China was most interested in for the most years.

25:13.840 --> 25:29.840
And so this group of people, I think still, I look very, I look very skeptically upon because the group kicked me out of the group as soon as I started to speak about the transfection as being a mistake.

25:29.840 --> 25:34.840
And they insisted that their group was really focused only on the origins of the virus.

25:35.840 --> 25:49.840
And I at that stage had already progressed far enough to say that I don't think that answering the source of the virus is going to solve this problem because I think they might have misled us about the source of the virus and they wouldn't have any of it.

25:49.840 --> 25:58.840
They didn't hear anything about transfection or vaccinations. They only wanted to talk about origins and they're actually still only working on the origins.

25:58.840 --> 25:59.840
Right.

26:00.840 --> 26:16.840
So that group got me quite distracted and kept me focused on fighting this narrative of a super bio weapon and that everybody was going to die and this was a worst case scenario because that was a strategy that was employed.

26:16.840 --> 26:27.840
And I think everybody who's listening to this podcast needs to understand that that in the darkest corners of the Internet and in the secret meetings of the government bureaucracy.

26:27.840 --> 26:43.840
And in the meetings behind the scenes at pharmaceutical companies, the assumption was that this was a leak of a virus that had potential to kill lots of people and irrespective of whether there was any data for that.

26:44.840 --> 27:03.840
Everybody needs to understand that the way this whole theater was kicked off was triggering all of the pre programmed activity actions and and and emergency action plans that have been set forth by all these exercises over the last 20 years so that that everybody's familiar with event

27:03.840 --> 27:14.840
201 but that's the last one in a series of exercises which prepared bureaucracies around the world for when this firearm gets pulled.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
Right.

27:15.840 --> 27:31.840
And this firearm got pulled and everybody did their job and I think they did their job so well that actually there was nobody that had the job of verifying whether we should continue to go on with this plan.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
Right.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.840
Once the plan was activated it was like now we change the planet forever.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.840
Right.

27:39.840 --> 27:46.840
And so that's what's become quite scary to me and I'm sure to you as well that when this first started.

27:46.840 --> 27:57.840
You would have had a hard time convincing me that we'd be here in 2023 I like no way but I actually think that the people who planned this new we would be here in 2023.

27:58.840 --> 28:11.840
Yeah well it's interesting you say that because the question was asked to me with my sister in 2020 and in February of 2020 she said to me and like I said I still was actively we're still actively seeing patients in our clinic.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.840
Before I gave it up in 2020 in December.

28:14.840 --> 28:18.840
But she said to me she says well how long do you think this is going to last.

28:18.840 --> 28:23.840
And I says well do you want me to tell you the truth or do you want me to lie to you and she says tell me the truth.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.840
I said it's going to last as long as the media wants it to last.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.840
They want it to last a year it'll last a year two years three years.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.840
It's there's not going to be an end to it.

28:32.840 --> 28:47.840
And we can see that now because they even talk about the we got into the variance and again I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because that came down the pipe was the variance and you know you're a biologist.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.840
The the the variance.

28:52.840 --> 28:57.840
Are are less lethal right.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.840
Well they appear to be I mean the question really becomes.

29:01.840 --> 29:07.840
Are the variants real and that's really where my.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.840
My journey is really.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.840
Really peaked.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.840
One of the.

29:14.840 --> 29:20.840
The sort of finishing stories there is with my history is that after doing my.

29:20.840 --> 29:31.840
YouTube and Twitch for about a year I was lucky enough to get a phone call from Bobby Kennedy asking him asking me to help him write this rule on book that's coming out in November.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.840
And honestly that that was.

29:35.840 --> 29:42.840
When I was challenged to learn the virology at a newer level at a better level than I had up until that point.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.840
Right.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
Previously I was.

29:45.840 --> 29:50.840
I was doing it for myself and I was doing it in the context of immunology but.

29:50.840 --> 30:00.840
Now Bobby really wanted me to understand for him what was done in every one of these papers and so I kind of redoubled my effort in terms of.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.840
What they're doing to scrutinize.

30:03.840 --> 30:08.840
What they know and what they don't know what they speculate and what they know.

30:08.840 --> 30:14.840
And it became very clear clear to me that coronavirus biology is.

30:14.840 --> 30:21.840
Coronaviruses are very enigmatic and very difficult for them to study and then suddenly in 2020.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.840
They have this fidelity.

30:24.840 --> 30:30.840
And and and ability to track a coronavirus in a way that they've never claimed before.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.840
Right.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.840
So that's that that to me.

30:35.840 --> 30:40.840
Was kind of when when things got really exciting because that's when my.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.840
My social media context started to act weird.

30:45.840 --> 30:52.840
And it was really when I started teaching infectious clones and how coronavirus biology is actually done in the laboratory.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.840
That people that used to be my allies started to say I was nuts.

30:56.840 --> 31:03.840
People that were saying I was nuts now really said I was nuts and people that weren't paying attention to me before started calling me crazy.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.840
So I kind of knew I was over the target at that point.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.840
Absolutely 100%.

31:08.840 --> 31:19.840
Dr David Martin brought up going back to 2019 event 201 and Mickey Willis and pandemic really laid that out really well.

31:19.840 --> 31:28.840
And what's really interesting is in 2017 when about a year into President Trump's presidency.

31:28.840 --> 31:32.840
He predicted that there was going to be an outbreak.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.840
He said there's going to be a virus.

31:36.840 --> 31:49.840
And it's like these people can predict these things. It's amazing how they can predict certain events. So, like I say, for the person, the non scientist, the person that's listening.

31:49.840 --> 31:59.840
They've got to be at this point, hopefully kind of putting the pieces together of the puzzle of this whole puzzle to see what's going on.

31:59.840 --> 32:08.840
You know, when you start talking about, you know, vaccine passports and digital passports and so on and so forth.

32:08.840 --> 32:26.840
Now you're really getting into a whole host of issues that people get to a point where they're like, you know, I don't even want to hear it anymore, you know, because I did a little research on quantum tattoos.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.840
Right.

32:28.840 --> 32:38.840
And there is a Dr. McHugh, who works out of Rice University, who had been studying and doing research on quantum tattoos and Lucifer ace die.

32:38.840 --> 32:48.840
And I know there was Dr. Carrie Mahaeus and Dr. Sherry 10penny. They, they brought this on early on. I mean, they mentioned this like right around April or May of 2020.

32:49.840 --> 33:17.840
And lo and behold, when I did my research, I'm looking and I'm citing articles that were written in 2012 and 13 and 14 and up to 2019, a year before the coronavirus outbreak that they were going to be used for vaccine passports and children and pediatric patients.

33:17.840 --> 33:25.840
So, like you said, there's this, this plan that's been going on for so long for so many years, right?

33:25.840 --> 33:46.840
I think that's the part that people, I think they did very well in the years up to the pandemic to drive people to think that, for example, agenda 2030 was a conspiracy, or that the UN doesn't really mean anything, or that the who doesn't have any binding powers.

33:46.840 --> 34:02.840
And so they already started with this dichotomy of, you know, you're, you're, you're a global conspiracy theorist, or you're, you know, you watch TV and you believe it, they already started this many, many years before that.

34:02.840 --> 34:20.840
And then for sure, the part of, of, of overplaying this, the technology of digital ID and a vaccination ID and vaccine passports, that overplaying of that was also part of the game.

34:20.840 --> 34:26.840
But to tire people out, as you said, to get them tired of listening to this stuff, oh, they're never going to do that.

34:26.840 --> 34:33.840
The idea is to tell you about it now, so that five years from now, it's kind of an old idea.

34:33.840 --> 34:34.840
Right.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.840
The idea is to not, they don't, they don't want to vaccine passport me.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.840
They want to vaccine my passport, my kids, kids.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.840
This is not a plan even to get my children, probably.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.840
It's to get my grandchildren and your grandchildren.

34:47.840 --> 35:03.840
That's how I think we, we also need to reorganize the way we interpret how we're being governed, because I think a lot of people think we're being governed, you know, on a weekly basis or a monthly basis or even a yearly election cycle basis.

35:04.840 --> 35:11.840
But these people have been governing Western civilization with a 15, 20, 30 year time horizon.

35:11.840 --> 35:19.840
They already know where they want us to go, where they want to get us, because it's moving a civilization of our size is like a cruise ship.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.840
You can't just turn on a dime.

35:21.840 --> 35:28.840
And they've had us pointed in this direction for at least 25 or 30 years, my whole lifetime almost.

35:28.840 --> 35:33.840
And this direction is a direction where they can govern the globe.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
You can't govern the globe with a common language.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.840
You can't govern the globe with a common MTV channel.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.840
You can't cover the globe with a common religion.

35:42.840 --> 35:50.840
You govern the globe with a common enemy, a common danger or a common crisis.

35:51.840 --> 36:01.840
And that's why climate change and public health are the two best ways to unite the world under a global governance structure and they've known that for a while.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
No.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.840
Yeah.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.840
Yeah.

36:04.840 --> 36:09.840
I don't think they're going to win at this game, though, because there's just too many differences.

36:09.840 --> 36:18.840
There's too much division in terms of how people believe, you know, I mean, you look on a global scale.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.840
You know, I mean, our own government can't even govern itself.

36:23.840 --> 36:33.840
So how are they going to, how are they going to organize to, to, to organize people? How are they going to do that? They can't do it.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.840
Right.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.840
I mean, maybe it's me.

36:36.840 --> 36:44.840
I don't know. I mean, honestly, I think that's, that's the, the crazy part of this is that it does really seem.

36:44.840 --> 36:49.840
That there are very few alternative interpretations of what's happening here.

36:49.840 --> 37:00.840
I mean, if you, if you find the worst recordings from these people, they say the words right out loud, but if you just try to interpret their behavior, it does seem to be.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.840
There is a movement to.

37:03.840 --> 37:09.840
To dilute national sovereignty to the point of meaninglessness.

37:09.840 --> 37:19.840
And in so doing that, what becomes the power structure, the power structure is, is, is weaponized piles of money.

37:19.840 --> 37:26.840
And so if the US government is a pile of debt, then that's not the weaponized pile of money that's governing us.

37:26.840 --> 37:33.840
And so we have to look for these weaponized piles of money, identify them and then take the power away from them.

37:33.840 --> 37:44.840
Right now, because we're chasing around the origin of a, of a, of a, probably a host of previously existing RNA signals rather than a novel virus.

37:44.840 --> 37:50.840
And we're debating about a war in a country and in mid Asia.

37:50.840 --> 37:58.840
We're not thinking about how to escape from their global governance structure. We're just chasing down their, their shiny objects.

37:58.840 --> 38:14.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's interesting is they continue the narrative with the vaccines and the, and, and getting vaccines and they backed away from the mandatory mandated the mandates.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.840
Oh, how, how.

38:16.840 --> 38:24.840
I mean, yes, they backed away from the mandates because the legal, the legal space doesn't permit it. They would, they would lose.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.840
But they haven't backed away from the coercion.

38:27.840 --> 38:33.840
And you could see awarding the Nobel Prize to these two biochemists as being coercion.

38:33.840 --> 38:45.840
You are basically for anybody that's unsophisticated enough to understand the biology and the subtle nuances of what informed consent means in the context of transfection.

38:45.840 --> 39:01.840
If they see a Nobel Prize being awarded to vaccine makers, the average person on the street is not capable of dismissing that, but instead sees a impenetrable illusion of consensus that they save the world.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
Right.

39:02.840 --> 39:08.840
And that impenetrable illusion of consensus is not easy for the average person to turn away from.

39:08.840 --> 39:19.840
When everybody on social media agrees, when everybody on TV agrees, it's really hard for average Joe or average Jane to go, well, I don't know if I agree.

39:19.840 --> 39:26.840
I mean, that's, that's like impossible. That's what the ash conformity experiment is all about. And that's only three people in a room next to you.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
Right.

39:27.840 --> 39:35.840
It's not people on TV that you respect. It's not influencers that you follow. It's not Hollywood stars you're in love with.

39:35.840 --> 39:41.840
This is just four random people in a room that all say the wrong answer and you have a hard time disagreeing with them.

39:41.840 --> 39:55.840
Yeah, don't you think too, though, that you have enough people out there by now that know, because I see a lot of comments where people say, well, I would never get that shot again. I would never never participate in that again.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.840
Right.

39:56.840 --> 40:06.840
So don't you think that there's enough people out there now that are just are just they're not they're not they're non takers anymore. They're just not going to do it anymore.

40:06.840 --> 40:11.840
I don't know. I want to believe you're right. I don't know, though.

40:11.840 --> 40:16.840
I think there are a lot of people out there that would lie about how many they took.

40:16.840 --> 40:27.840
I think there are a lot of people out there that are ashamed that they followed the order and are still so afraid and shame that if another order came about, they still wouldn't be able to say no.

40:27.840 --> 40:28.840
Yeah.

40:28.840 --> 40:34.840
I'm very pessimistic because I think people have been so confused and terrified.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.840
Right.

40:35.840 --> 40:43.840
Trusting the TV that, you know, the, the, the.

40:43.840 --> 40:53.840
It's almost like you have to be in person with everybody that you want to want to convert. And so the only way, you know, podcasts don't even work. You got to be in person podcast. If you.

40:53.840 --> 40:59.840
If you're open to these ideas, you can find your way out, but most people aren't open. They don't even know they're not open.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.840
Yeah.

41:00.840 --> 41:15.840
But you have enough people, the likes of Edward Dowd who wrote cause unknown. I've interviewed him. You have Robert F Kennedy. Yeah. I think you have enough people out there influencers out there that are getting the work because the word does spread.

41:15.840 --> 41:19.840
My parents don't talk to me because I, I'm a know it all.

41:19.840 --> 41:26.840
My own parents haven't talked to me for three years because I lost my job and they think I lied to them about why I lost my job.

41:27.840 --> 41:36.840
And it's because I'm a know it all. My brother in Texas doesn't talk to me anymore because he wanted me to wear two masks when I came to visit him and I wouldn't.

41:36.840 --> 41:37.840
Jeez.

41:37.840 --> 41:47.840
So these people are spectacularly committed to this lie because if they're not, then their whole worldview will be shaken.

41:47.840 --> 42:04.840
They will have to admit that they believed a spectacular. I mean, it's too much for them. My parents are for going seeing their grandchildren for three years under the stipulation that their son is an idiot.

42:04.840 --> 42:14.840
I mean, they know that I was, I was hired by Robert F Kennedy Jr. and I can only assume that that makes them even more certain that I'm an idiot.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.840
Jeez.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.840
I mean, what is a kind of take?

42:20.840 --> 42:24.840
That's the question I ask almost every day I wake up.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.840
But it is really this serious. And so as hopeful as I am,

42:29.840 --> 42:36.840
I think that we're in for a long ride yet because the people that are committed are still really committed.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.840
Yeah.

42:38.840 --> 42:43.840
So that takes us up to 2022.

42:43.840 --> 42:55.840
And what I want to do is I want to get into the vaccine a little bit. I want to talk to you about that and get into the technology.

42:56.840 --> 43:09.840
The where we're with the future looks like as far as this vaccine program and what's going to happen and what you think is going to happen. Sure.

43:09.840 --> 43:17.840
Maybe I can do a little explanation first of my understanding of the technology and why I think it that way.

43:17.840 --> 43:18.840
Hold your thought. Sure.

43:18.840 --> 43:35.840
I got to turn up the light.

43:35.840 --> 43:42.840
It's getting dark here in Florida. So I had to put up the lights a little bit. Was it like in the dark?

43:42.840 --> 43:47.840
So getting back to the vaccine.

43:47.840 --> 43:57.840
Yeah. So the, the basic gist that everybody should have in, in born in mind is this technology is not new.

43:57.840 --> 44:07.840
Medical science and biological science from the academic perspective. When I say academic science, I mean stuff that's done on a bench at a university under grant money.

44:07.840 --> 44:16.840
All of this research is generally done with animals. So everybody knows that we use mice, we use rats, we use monkeys, we use guinea pigs, whatever.

44:16.840 --> 44:31.840
And in all of these lower mammals, there are a wide variety of ways to genetically alter them temporarily or permanently in order to probe the way that physiological systems work.

44:31.840 --> 44:41.840
In the past 25 years, one of the most powerful techniques that has been used to probe mammalian physiology is the knockout mouse.

44:41.840 --> 44:47.840
And in the knockout mouse, what you do is you take a gene in the genome and you delete it.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.840
And then you grow mice without that gene.

44:50.840 --> 44:59.840
And although it's not a perfect physiological model, although the physiology compensates for the missing of that gene.

44:59.840 --> 45:14.840
Oftentimes, especially with genes that play crucial roles in physiological processes, you can prove their role in that physiological process by removing the gene and show that that process is disrupted.

45:14.840 --> 45:26.840
And this is occasionally useful because as you're probably aware, there are many genetic diseases which essentially are deletions or their enzymes that don't work anymore.

45:26.840 --> 45:31.840
And so that's essentially a deletion of a gene. And so then you get this disease manifesting.

45:31.840 --> 45:37.840
Now, in order to create animal models of disease, that's often what we've done.

45:37.840 --> 45:52.840
And if we associate a gene with schizophrenia, then we make a mouse model with the knockout gene and call that a schizophrenia mouse model where you've knocked out the gene that has a propensity for schizophrenia.

45:52.840 --> 46:00.840
And you look at the mouse's behavior to see if there's any differences and see if that tells you anything about how schizophrenia works.

46:00.840 --> 46:08.840
However, as my thing, well, that's a dumb experiment because if the gene causes schizophrenia and you delete it, then you haven't created anything.

46:08.840 --> 46:17.840
But it was to illustrate the sort of blunt force manipulation that genetic knockouts are.

46:17.840 --> 46:23.840
You can't learn that much because if the mouse lives, then the physiology compensates.

46:23.840 --> 46:29.840
And so the physiology of that knockout mouse is different than what it would have been if it had that gene.

46:29.840 --> 46:35.840
So here's where transfection and transformation come in.

46:35.840 --> 46:51.840
Because to make that probing experiment better, what you want to do is be able to turn the gene off or to turn it on after the animal has fully developed and is a normal mouse.

46:52.840 --> 46:59.840
And that's what transfection and transformation have allowed academic biologists to do for the last 20 years.

46:59.840 --> 47:06.840
Transfection is the use of mRNA in a tissue in an animal to express a protein.

47:06.840 --> 47:17.840
It can also be to knock down the expression of a protein if you use the right mRNA, which interferes with the native mRNA that's expressing the protein of interest.

47:17.840 --> 47:24.840
The trick of this is so cool is that wherever you inject the RNA, that's where the change occurs.

47:24.840 --> 47:32.840
So you can knock out the gene functions in certain neurons, in certain parts of the brain, in the liver, somewhere else.

47:32.840 --> 47:52.840
And so transfection, the use of mRNA to interfere with protein expression or to up regulate it or to induce novel protein expression in order to perturb a system to do an experiment to see how a mouse works has been done for about 20 years.

47:52.840 --> 48:15.840
They used gold particles, electricity, and liposomes, which are essentially lipid nanoparticles with a less complicated name, to put mRNA into small blebs and put them into places to use animals' experiments where we wanted to change the transient expression of a protein.

48:15.840 --> 48:24.840
So you can go on websites all around the world and find biotech companies that are selling transfection and transformation agents.

48:24.840 --> 48:30.840
Now, transformation is the same process, but you use DNA to do it.

48:30.840 --> 48:37.840
And very typically in bench biology, the vector for that is an adenovirus.

48:37.840 --> 48:44.840
So that should bring a bell because they used adenovirus for AstraZeneca and for Johnson & Johnson.

48:44.840 --> 49:04.840
So they used very typical transformation and very typical transfection, a known methodology in academic science for 20 years and started calling it a vaccine.

49:05.840 --> 49:14.840
And every single biologist in the world that's worth their salt should have said, whoa, we can't do that.

49:14.840 --> 49:21.840
That's not vaccination. That's transformation. That's transfection. They should have just said that.

49:22.840 --> 49:33.840
So share with the viewers and listeners the difference between the traditional vaccines that you may have gotten, you know, 30, 40 years ago, or even 15 or 20 years ago.

49:33.840 --> 49:44.840
And this, what I call, they use it, they call it emergency use authorization, I call it experimental use authorization gene bio weapon. What's the difference?

49:44.840 --> 49:59.840
It's really not. I mean, bio weapon just has this, has this, you know, military context to it, but you can also just think of it as like totalitarian governance.

49:59.840 --> 50:04.840
You have no choice. We're going to lie to you in order to achieve this goal.

50:04.840 --> 50:14.840
And we're going to be so spectacularly committed to the lie that even when it doesn't work out like we planned, we're just going to keep lying about it.

50:14.840 --> 50:36.840
The tricky thing with previous, the previous vaccine schedule is that, you know, this was a unscrutinized legal safe haven that all of the pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, the CDC was well aware of.

50:36.840 --> 50:53.840
And an entire sort of alternative legal system exists in order to shift the risk of vaccine adverse events from the manufacturers to the taxpayer.

50:53.840 --> 51:16.840
And interestingly, that system, as bad as it was for the citizenry, was still capable of preventing something like this happening. And it's actually the prep act and a declaration of emergency that allowed emergency use authorization to be granted to everything that we did.

51:16.840 --> 51:30.840
And that's something that maybe people aren't aware of. But even the PCR test is not something that was really clinically evaluated. It was, it was given an emergency use authorized blanket approval.

51:31.840 --> 51:50.840
And it's not really approval, but it's permissions. And then all of the variants of the PCR test were covered under those EU's so at some point, I think we had 220 different products that purported to be PCR based coronavirus tests in America.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.840
And none of those tests exist anymore.

51:54.840 --> 52:05.840
They're all gone. All those little companies, all those little testing, they all disappeared. All the content tracing companies, they're all gone.

52:05.840 --> 52:12.840
Even the inventor of the PCR tests mentioned that it's not full proof. It's not accurate.

52:12.840 --> 52:22.840
No, yeah, and that's really where the virology stuff comes back full circle. I mean, we can go there.

52:22.840 --> 52:33.840
If you went, if you went into the literature before 2020, what you would find is a, a consensus lamentation.

52:33.840 --> 52:40.840
So they were all consensus agreed that it's sad that we can't really find coronavirus is that easy.

52:40.840 --> 52:54.840
And in fact, we should put some money into trying to come up with a pan coronavirus test. One that can just find a coronavirus so that we can find them easier.

52:54.840 --> 53:10.840
And we're talking after SARS one, this was like a major focus. And what became clear in the literature is that the best they could do is look for signals that are shared across all coronaviruses.

53:11.840 --> 53:26.840
And so the original pan coronavirus tests aimed at the end protein and the RNA dependent polymerase. These are two genes of coronaviruses that across hundreds of coronaviruses.

53:27.840 --> 53:42.840
They're very, very little. And for non biologists out there, the way to think about this is on an automobile. Some things are very different across automobiles because they're not crucial to the way the automobile functions.

53:43.840 --> 54:03.840
Some people might be the interior. Some, some automobiles have very cheap vinyl interior and very uncomfortable seats with no headrest and a very crappy scenario. Other cars have leather interior with cedar inlay and, and, you know, whatever other amenities you can imagine.

54:04.840 --> 54:22.840
But if you were to compare the wheels of those two cars, the rubber content would be very similar. The size of the wheels would be very similar. Their durability would be very similar. Their properties, their mechanical requirements are very, very similar because they serve a vital purpose for the car.

54:23.840 --> 54:41.840
If you open the hood, you would find that they both have internal combustion engines, most likely because, again, that's a conserved aspect of automobiles. And in coronaviruses, the most conserved aspects of their genome are the genomes that are the parts of the genome that are most important to their high functioning.

54:42.840 --> 54:58.840
So the RNA, the pen and RNA polymerase is how it copies itself. So that gene is really similar across all of them. And the end protein is the protein around which the genome is wrapped, another protein that's very conserved across coronaviruses.

54:59.840 --> 55:24.840
So interestingly, most are all of the first year of coronavirus PCR tests were aimed at those two genes. And if you looked at previous coronavirus literature, the only conclusion to come to is that there's no way for those two genes to be specific enough to identify a novel coronavirus because they're the perfect genes to find all of them.

55:24.840 --> 55:53.840
Right. So they really did a bait and switch. They did. And you hear a lot of sentiment about the vaccines containing, and I interviewed Dr. Maria Mahalcha, hydrogels, because you did mention the nanoparticle, lit liposome, but also hydrogels, and there's supposedly electromagnetic metals that are in there, and it's supposed to be tied to 5G.

55:54.840 --> 56:11.840
How true is that? I got to be honest with you, James, I think it was also part of the scam. There was too much for knowledge of the potential for these kinds of contaminants from the very beginning.

56:11.840 --> 56:22.840
I would go so far as to say that the first time I heard someone say that coronavirus was going to be activated by 5G was in February of 2020.

56:22.840 --> 56:34.840
And that's just absurd. There's no way that kind of narrative would already be out there, and people would be angry about fighting the 5G conspiracy theory.

56:34.840 --> 56:46.840
The only way that's out there is if that was for real. And there are patents. There are technologies that use graphene as a 5G antenna.

56:46.840 --> 56:58.840
There are people who aren't lying about having magnetic spots on their body. I have no idea what these people are on or what they've done, but they can't all be liars.

56:59.840 --> 57:20.840
And my best guess is, my friend, that they knew that the more of these appearing to be anecdotal stories that seemed crazy that were out there, the more likely the real stories of misery caused by the vaccine could be dismissed.

57:21.840 --> 57:39.840
And so if you're also hearing stories about 5G and graphene oxide and hydras and whatever else being in the shot, then when somebody says, well, you know, people are having clotting reactions to the second shot, it's like, yeah, it's the same.

57:39.840 --> 57:46.840
It's all the same, you know, they took J&J off the market because that one was having problems. They were honest.

57:47.840 --> 57:58.840
And so the whole, I really feel very convinced that the entire script, even the parts that seemed like we're off script were actually on script.

57:58.840 --> 58:05.840
Every leak is on script, every argument about things in front of the Senate on camera was on script.

58:06.840 --> 58:15.840
Every whistleblower basically is on script except for the people who are willing to question the virus and there aren't very many of them.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.840
Yeah.

58:16.840 --> 58:17.840
Yeah.

58:17.840 --> 58:27.840
It's really, it's really a problem because I think there are lots of really good people that were co-opted at the beginning because this was such a.

58:27.840 --> 58:33.840
It was such a clandestine operation. I mean, I don't know if you're aware of this, for example, I have a.

58:34.840 --> 58:39.840
I have a couple really close friends that I've made through the pandemic.

58:39.840 --> 58:44.840
And I also had, you would never know this.

58:44.840 --> 58:50.840
I also had an ex girlfriend who worked in Hollywood and she's dead now.

58:50.840 --> 58:57.840
I believe the reason why she's dead is because she was forced to take the vaccine to get on set.

58:58.840 --> 58:59.840
For her work.

58:59.840 --> 59:02.840
And then she got advanced brain cancer and died within a year.

59:02.840 --> 59:10.840
I know this might be true because another friend of mine who also is circulating in Hollywood.

59:11.840 --> 59:25.840
Told me stories in 2021 that Christmas parties in 2020 were visited by private doctors claiming to have the vaccine.

59:25.840 --> 59:38.840
And they vaccinated people at Hollywood parties and on sets of movies during December of 2020 and January of 21 before they were even given it to old people.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.840
And they also did this on TV sets.

59:42.840 --> 59:49.840
So there are probably newscasters that got the first dose of the vaccine before it was even released.

59:49.840 --> 59:57.840
And so those people are in a really interesting position because there would have to admit that they.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:07.840
Sort of circumvented the system and cut in line because they were considered national priority people that couldn't get sick because they were on the news or they were on.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.840
They were in Hollywood so we didn't want them to speak out.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840
Right.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840
So we got them first.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840
Dr. Cooley.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.840
I lost eight personally know eight people that died from the vaccination.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840
Right.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840
Eight.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.840
Thirty years old.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840
Eight.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
Eight.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840
My wife's.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840
Yeah.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.840
My wife's when she was an exchange student her.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Her.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.840
Guardian parents at the time when she was going to school in the United States.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Their grandson died.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Dropped dead.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
I have a friend she died of.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840
She had gotten turbo cancer.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.840
She had gotten liver cancer within a couple months.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840
She was healthy.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840
All these people were healthy.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.840
A couple other friends died suddenly from cardiac arrest.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.840
Well, most of them died from cardiac arrest.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.840
So, I mean, if you ask me how many people do I know died from.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.840
COVID, not zero, none.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
Right.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:14.840
They didn't let people in the hospitals to see relatives because they saw that hospitals are, you know, it's off limits for anybody to visit a hospital.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
Does it occur to you?

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
I'm not a doctor James, but you are.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.840
I'm actually I was the practice manager and owner.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:34.840
Does it occur to you though that I want to talk to more doctors about this because I really have the feeling that when I was a kid that I knew men who had multiple heart attacks.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840
Right.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.840
And now I'm hearing stories about people that have heart attacks that can't be revived.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
And I didn't know that that happened very often.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:50.840
I understand that might happen when you're 90, but I knew lots of people growing up men that had heart attacks when they were 50 and they didn't die from it.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.840
Why are our heart attacks becoming more deadly and that would be a signal you would think.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:10.840
Yeah, that I have a friend. He's a pediatric cardiologist. I interviewed him about three weeks ago. We were talking about the auto immune response with the vaccination amongst pediatric patients.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:21.840
And we talked, we discussed Kawasaki disease versus multiple systemic inflammatory disease and pediatric patients.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.840
And we're going to actually do a follow up interview as well.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.840
I was under the assumption that those were the same.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.840
But my myocarditis.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.840
No, I thought you said Kawasaki syndrome and then MSC.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Yeah, MSC right.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.840
Oh, they're the same thing though, right? Okay. Yeah.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.840
They're relatively the same. They're a little bit different. They present differently.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:52.840
But my question to you is with this mRNA technology, because it produces the protein, it mimics the protein.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840
And it is it.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840
And this is a question to you.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:05.840
Is it does it mimic the spike protein? Does it produce this actual spikes, the messenger RNA because it goes from what translation of transcription to produce these proteins, right?

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.840
Does it produce the spike protein? Is that my that's my question to you?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.840
Yeah, so I think it's it's transcription and then translation, but it doesn't matter.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.840
But I say transcription to translation.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.840
Yeah, I get them mixed up all the time too. I'm not trying to correct you. That was just me trying to get into the groove. It's.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.840
So there's a couple of things to keep in mind.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:40.840
First and foremost is the cartoon version of the injection and the cartoon version is what they talk about on TV. The cartoon version is what they sold you.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:50.840
The cartoon version is the stupid simple version, which is that the lipid nanoparticle is completely inert because you have lipids in your body.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840
Right.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.840
The mRNA is completely inert because you have mRNA in your body.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:03.840
And the mRNA doesn't last very long because mRNA doesn't last very long. So it just makes some protein in your body clears the protein and it's fine.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:20.840
Now there's infinitely many things wrong with that. The first is that when they release the data about the mRNA product and they ran a gel to look at the RNA, they didn't get a single band, but they got a smear.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:31.840
And to explain that to your listeners, a gel is a kind of gradient of thickness or density.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:46.840
And if you put proteins in the top of it and then you use electricity to draw the proteins down through the gel, the lighter, smaller proteins will move faster and the heavier proteins will move slower.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:59.840
And so after about an hour, very heavy proteins will have moved a little bit and the lighter proteins will move farther and you will have separated all of the proteins in your sample by weight.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:14.840
So the more pure that your RNA would be, the more crystal clear the bands would be. So for example, if you had a heavy RNA and a light RNA and they were both pure and equal quantities,

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:36.840
then after running the gel you would see one line right here and one line right here corresponding to a light and a heavy chain of RNA and they would be at predictable heights based on how long you ran them on the gel because the gel will tell you then how heavy the RNA is based on the distance between.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:54.840
Now in the mRNA for this shot, what they should have seen is a band at 1,400 bases of weight because the molecular weight would be about 1,400 bases of RNA, a rough number.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:19.840
But instead they saw a continuous smear meaning that there were protein fragments of all weights and sizes from the size of the spike protein down to very tiny, which means that if they injected that RNA into you only a small portion of it would code for the whole spike and the rest of this smear would code for a wide variety of partial

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:29.840
viral proteins, which in no way shape or form would guarantee a robust immune response meaningful to the pathogen from which that originated.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:58.840
But my other question too is it seems like, okay, and this is again a question to you, in case the messenger RNA, correct me if I'm wrong, but they encased the messenger RNA inside of a nano lipid particle correct because the messenger RNA would denature and I remember they got rid of a big batch of product that was not under their correct temperature in transport.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:18.840
So is that because it denatured the messenger RNA that was encapsulated in part? I actually have learned more recently that this might have been more to do with the fact that the way that they get the lipid nanoparticle down to size is actually a proprietary methodology.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:31.840
And as you can imagine with any fat or oil on top of water, the default is not millions of tiny little droplets, but the default is to form one big droplet.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:41.840
And in fact, I think the majority of the reason why they needed to keep it cool originally was the mRNA needs to be cold.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:50.840
But I actually think the secret was that the lipids, the lipid nanoparticles won't be nanoparticles anymore if they're not cold because they'll start to fuse.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.840
And the toxicity of the lipid nanoparticle itself goes up exponentially as they become bigger.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.840
Right. And then it would expose the messenger RNA that's protected by the nanoparticle, correct?

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:11.840
I think so. I mean, but I don't know if it's so much to do with the degradation of the RNA because that's, from my perspective as a biologist, that's been grossly exaggerated.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.840
Yes.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:21.840
We have RNA, RNAces are everywhere that we have RNAces in our skin oil, all that stuff, and we have to use gloves when we use RNA in a laboratory.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:39.840
But I think that that aspect of RNA has been exaggerated for the purpose of rolling out this shot because I've done lots of experiments with PCR and use lots of shortcuts and whatever.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:50.840
And it still works. If your signal is robust, it's fine. It's really when you're when you're trying to do science as best as possible because you're trying to make a new discovery.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Then, of course, you're going to wear gloves and you're going to make sure that no foreign RNA gets into your sample because you don't know what you're doing and you're doing science.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:17.840
But with regard to this injection, I think that what has been revealed by the scaling up of the manufacturing by the just gross negligence with regard to quality control has been revealed is that actually the RNA is not that unstable.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:25.840
It's probably not. It's much more likely that they just can't make it. It's much more likely that they just can't purify it.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:35.840
It's much more likely that the lipid nanoparticle by by congeolating causes more toxicity than the RNA ever could.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:46.840
It's not to say that I'm not discounting transfection as being bad. I'm still firmly convinced that transfection cannot be used to augment your immune system.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:10:00.840
But I'm trying to suggest that like a lot of these other narratives at the beginning of the pandemic, the narrative of keeping it cool or we need to have minus 80 freezers in every pharmacy.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:15.840
This was all designed to distract and get people to debate about things that really weren't in play because if you're debating about the storage of the vaccine, then you're not debating about whether you should even take it.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:25.840
I really think we've just been so often shown a shiny object and shown people arguing about it and that's definitely one of them because now they don't care.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.840
Now you can store vaccine in a regular refrigerator and nothing's changed about the formulation.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.840
Right. So that's clearly wasn't bullshit. Excuse my language.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:46.840
Yeah, that's okay. That's good. But so what you're saying though, it's still encapsulated in a nanoparticle, the messenger RNA, correct?

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.840
It is as far as we can tell. Yeah, that's what 10.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:57.840
So it's more like a time release capsule is what it, what it sounds like. And then because they're saying that.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.840
And I interviewed Dr. William Macus and several other physicians that had mentioned that.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.840
You know, and a lot of people will say professionals will say, well, you know,

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:17.840
just because you didn't get an acute reaction from it, like some people did.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:22.840
Over time, it's going to affect people and they're saying, well, you know,

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:32.840
according to a timeline, it could be a year, year and a half, two years and even three years after the shot that this can affect you.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.840
Is that true?

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.840
It has to be.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:47.840
I don't think that there's any other way to characterize it simply because unlike all previous vaccines that are basically combinations of inert substances.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.840
They might have put an irritating chemical in combination with a, with a recombinant protein.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:02.840
They might have put a couple of chemicals in with a couple of recombinant proteins, but those substances were all inert.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:08.840
And so the challenge was your body to clear those substances without making any mistakes.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:17.840
And so you can imagine many scenarios where that toxic adjuvant can cause bad reactions.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:26.840
The toxic adjuvant can activate your immune system and then a secondary exposure to something else like Tylenol could cause damage to your body.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:35.840
But with transfection, you're actually creating a whole nother scenario because again, let me repeat that.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:46.840
Old vaccines as, as, as sort of blunt as they are because they are very blunt if you describe them.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.840
You are, you are bypassing the immune system in order to augment it.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.840
They have all inert substances in them.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:06.840
Now with the transfection, what you are doing is expressing a foreign protein in tissues throughout your body.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.840
Now we were told that it stays in the muscle.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.840
It'll go away in a few days, but we now know that that's not the case.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.840
It definitely doesn't stay in the muscle and it can go anywhere.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
And wherever it goes, this RNA will cause the expression of a foreign protein.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:33.840
That is not, that is not an immune problem that your immune system is organized and has evolved to deal with.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:43.840
There is no scenario in mother nature where your cells will express a foreign protein inside of your body.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840
You can't name one.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:58.840
And even in a viral infection, the cells are being made to manufacture proteins when there is a barrier or at a barrier.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:05.840
So when you are infected with a virus, there are a very specific set of cells which is infected by a virus.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:12.840
And it is not your muscle, it's not your ovary, it's not your endothelial cells, it's not your liver.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:22.840
It's none of these. It is first and foremost a barrier of your gut, your skin, your lungs, your nasal and mucosal.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:30.840
So the whole idea of injection into the muscle is already from my humble opinion, quite sketchy,

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:40.840
and we're probably going to come to the realization in the next four or five years that that was a ridiculous assumption that we could augment the immune system with a simple injection into the muscle.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:47.840
But transfection creates a scenario not like that because again, let me say it one more time.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:55.840
A combination of inert substances put into your muscle is a challenge for your immune system to clear.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:09.840
A transfection challenges your immune system to clear your own cells without making autoimmunity to them.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:21.840
So when you get injected with a regular vaccine, your body is being challenged to clear the aluminum, to clear the adjuvant and to clear the recombinant protein.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:34.840
In a transfection, the foreign proteins are expressed on cells internally, and the only alternative for your immune system is to reject those cells as foreign.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.840
And in so doing, the immune system destroys them and cleans them up.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:56.840
And in cleaning them up, there is always a chance that it will present a self antigen and create self-recognizing immunity, which is autoimmunity, and that happens every time you force your body to clear a transfection.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:07.840
Now, let me just catch my breath and say that one of the things that I learned as an academic biologist is that transfection is indeed transient.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:25.840
So when we use it in mice, one of the things that we like to do that makes the mice experiment so valuable is to sacrifice the mouse afterward and go back into the brain and anatomically chart what neurons we had altered,

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:35.840
what neurons we expressed protein in, what neurons we decreased protein expression in, so that we can evaluate the results of our experiment.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:47.840
One of the limitations of transfection in this use is that you can't make a mouse permanently change with transfection because the immune system comes in.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:17:06.840
So in other words, if we were to, if this, my head is the mouse and we're going to transfect the mouse in the frontal cortex, if we cut the mouse up after six weeks and we make slices of the brain and we stain for the protein that we transfected, we will find it.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:15.840
And we can identify how much and what neurons were there and make some story about how we changed the brain function and how that was reflected in the behavior.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:25.840
However, if we were to wait about 12 weeks and cut the same slices, we would find those neurons gone.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.840
The immune system would have destroyed them and they would have died from the overexpression of a foreign protein.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:39.840
So those two combine to create an intolerable situation that the immune system gets rid of.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.840
And so we're not worried about that because we just breed more mice.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.840
We're not worried about that because that was part of the experimental plan.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:18:07.840
But for the four-year-old child with a lifelong lifetime to live, you can't dare the immune system to clear a few of these cells and don't make a mistake or you'll be a handicapped immune system for the rest of your life.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:18.840
You can't roll those dice with a child. In fact, you can't roll those dice with any healthy mammal that you want to live a long healthy life afterward, not even an elderly person.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Right. So what you're saying too is that this vaccine or whatever you want to call it at this point, it penetrates the blood-brain barrier pretty easy.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:37.840
I don't think there's anything stopping it. I mean, the only thing that's stopping it is that there are cells in between.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:47.840
So it is likely that the lipid nanoparticle will deposit in an endothelial cell as it's crossing the blood-brain barrier.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.840
But if it makes it across, then it's all game on.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.840
I mean, as far as we can tell, these lipid nanoparticles can go in and out of cells.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.840
They don't have to go in and then disappear.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.840
They're very, very difficult to understand and where they show up is everywhere.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.840
So that's the tricky part.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:19.840
And everywhere that they show up, the immune system is going to be challenged in a way that it's never been challenged before, not to make a mistake and accidentally trigger auto-immunity.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.840
Every time you take a shot, you're triggering this.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:33.840
And then the worst part is that any immune response made to the protein will become more robust.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.840
So let's just think of the best case scenario.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:45.840
You get transfected in your muscle and all of your muscle gets transfected and your immune system destroys a lot of your deltoid.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.840
It's painful. It takes weeks to heal.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.840
And this would be the best case scenario if it all stayed there.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:58.840
You'd get a lesion in your deltoid created by the immune system destroying parts of your muscle.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:09.840
So now you take your second injection and the antibodies that are circulating in your body land on the spike protein where it is transfected.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:19.840
So now the spike protein goes into your coronary artery and it transfects some of the cells into endothelium.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:27.840
So now the antibodies that were produced by the injection that only affected your muscle in the fantasy scenario.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:37.840
Now those antibodies are all in your body circulating around and when the spike protein gets expressed in your heart, now the antibodies deposit there

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.840
and your immune system can show up 15 times faster than it did the first time.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:49.840
And the next time you get a shot, the immune system will show up even quicker.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:59.840
And this is the problem because if you are transfecting your endothelial cells, you are necessarily interacting with the clotting system.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:13.840
And at this stage, you know, that all bets are off because once you've activated the seroprevalence in your blood, then at any point in time, those antibodies can trigger inflammation.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:22.840
They can trigger neutrophil attack. They can trigger cytotoxic T cell responses and they can trigger the complement system.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:31.840
And all of those things are potentially avalanche type disasters where once the biology starts, you can't stop it anymore.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:41.840
So what you're saying too, it's over working the immune system, it's a pretty much an autoimmune response.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:48.840
Does that explain also why oncogenes get triggered for turbo cancers? Is that?

01:21:48.840 --> 01:22:01.840
You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of speculation about that because the spike protein itself supposedly has some molecular components that might interact with some of these tumor suppressor genes.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:12.840
But I'm not sophisticated enough of biologists to know what fidelity the spike protein would need to be expressed in in order for that effect to occur.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:23.840
Most of the experiments that have covered this have been very in vitro limited experiments, but they show the interaction between the spike protein and some of these tumor suppressors.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:34.840
My guess is that it's a little less fantastic than them having some specific inserts in the spike protein.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:40.840
It's probably a more general reason why the immune system becomes dysregulated.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.840
One of those reasons might be something to do with the spike protein though.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:23:11.840
If the spike protein, for example, some of the more terrible rumors include that the spike protein has a short MHC2, which is the major histocompatibility complex, is the protein that every cell in your body uses as an ID.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.840
This is just another brief piece of biology for everybody to understand how the immune system works.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:28.840
There are cells of the immune system patrolling your body all the time for cancerous cells and for foreign material and foreign things.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:44.840
The way that they do it is they roll along, they're called natural killer cells, they roll along, and they look at what the cells are doing by looking at what protein fragments they're displaying on MHC.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:50.840
MHC being major histocompatibility complex, and there are two different ones.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:56.840
The one MHC1 is used by all the cells in your body to use as an ID.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:14.840
If the immune system approaches your ovaries and your ovaries are busy with homeostasis, on the outside they'll have a few MHC molecules that are displaying self-proteins that are specific for ovary cells.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:27.840
And if they're cancerous, they will end up displaying fragments of proteins that are not generally displayed by ovary cells, and therefore the immune system can come in and say,

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:35.840
Hey, why are you showing me this protein? You should be showing me an ovary protein, and we can get rid of that cell.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:51.840
And that's basically how cancer is patrolled in the body, is that normal tissues display the correct proteins and cancerous, invasive, or infected tissues display incorrect proteins.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:25:09.840
So this trick is especially well known by people who design vaccines because it is what is displayed on MHC2 in the immune system that is called the epitope that is identified in the virus.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:21.840
So whatever the immune system chooses to display on MHC2 to teach T cells is the epitope that the immune system is chosen to make memory to.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:29.840
Now there's a rumor that the spike protein has a MHC, or in humans, it's called HAI.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.840
I'm probably going to confuse everybody now.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:55.840
It seems to have a small sequence that could be a sort of general match for MHC2, and the implication of that is that a protein that had that sequence on it might be able to more easily activate the immune system because of that sequence.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:18.840
So in my worst case scenario imagination, I can see a scenario where if they wanted to make a successful mRNA vaccine, they would tell you that this protein that they found on this virus is this protein that has this extra little thing on it that acts as a natural adjuvant.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:31.840
And so we got lucky. Look, we put this protein in 45 minutes later, we made the RNA, we injected it in the people, and they made a robust immune response.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.840
That doesn't always happen.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:49.840
And so it becomes more and more sort of difficult to divorce the long history of work that has been done on trying to activate the immune system with small proteins.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:27:04.840
And the idea that they would put one of these activating small protein sequences into a coronavirus spike and then say that, look, we found a novel coronavirus and here's the spike and we're going to use the spike for a vaccine.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:25.840
And lo and behold, we get a robust immune response. It works like a charm. That would have been one of the very easy and quite frankly well known ways that they could have created an immunogenic protein that would work really well as the flagship demonstration that that

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:37.840
transaction is great for immunization because see we produce antibodies. Right. I don't have enough evidence to make that claim as as being true.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:49.840
But I do have enough evidence to make the claim. I think that that RNA viruses cannot pandemic but they can make enough RNA virus to cause a pandemic.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:28:02.840
And that's really the difference. I have a good idea how just have your natural immune system take care of all this. Exactly. It's what I've been saying from the very beginning.

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:12.840
Right. We don't have to worry about that. And when you get a guy like Bill Gates saying, well, we want to depopulate the world and everybody's got to be vaccinated. Well, we'll start with you, Bill.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:27.840
You go first. You be the first taker on all this, you know, because I think eating properly, you know, rolling the dice with eating properly exercising and laying off processed food is a good start, I think.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:44.840
I agree. I think that's part of the, again, you know, it's across all aspects of our culture at this stage, but we have, we have, we don't take responsibility for, for understanding anymore as adults.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.840
We all kind of have checked out and said that the experts know better than us.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:59.840
More than anything in the United States, the way that we eat, the way that we think about our health is just so inverted.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:10.840
And we all want to pill to fix what ails us when in reality, we just need to put better food in and we'll get better results out. We need to exercise more. I mean, some people.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:21.840
And you might be one of these people. And I'm not an ex, I'm not a master of this. I'm just not, I'm not as bad as other people.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:35.840
There are people who have not exercised since high school. They have not even walked a long ways since high school. And then when they can't breathe very well, or they have stomach problems.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:51.840
The first thing they want is a medicine or a simple solution when in reality, if you don't move regularly, you will be unhealthy. If you don't eat and drink good things, you are going to be unhealthy.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:30:07.840
If you inhale auto fumes all day, you're going to be unhealthy. If you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, that is going to contribute to a whole host of ways that you are not optimal.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:24.840
And there's no juice or supplement or magic, you know, powder packet that you can mix in your water bottle. And that's going to compensate for the 40 years of lack of exercise and nutrients.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:30.840
Yeah, listen, I go to the gym five days a week consistently for the last 40 years.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:46.840
Yeah, I don't, I don't want to say I'm a vegetarian, but I'm close to not so much vegetarian. I'm a pescatarian, but I stick primarily to fresh, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, soups, things like that.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.840
And then twice from Italy, we were just having the conversation. She just moved here four years ago.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:31:05.840
And we're, you probably are familiar with this, what I'm about to tell you, but we're discussing the, we were talking about the potato chip aisle and the grocery stores and, and some of the shopping carts that we see, especially during COVID.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:15.840
You know, the potato chip aisle is like this long aisle that's like, you just goes on forever. And she was telling me in Italy, it's probably like maybe the size of my desk.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:29.840
And there's just a little section where they sell potato chips in Italy and all the grocery stores. So that just tells you where we're at here in the United States, right? Absolutely, it does. I mean, it's.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:38.840
A good friend of mine, Greg Glassman once said that if you have to, if you have to open a box or a bag to eat, then you're probably not really eating.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:44.840
That's right. And that's really where we are in America. Most people are eating out of a box in a bag every day.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.840
Yeah. Yeah. I'm 60 years old, by the way.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.840
Are you really? Yeah. Wow.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.840
Okay. So you and I both have some secret going on because everybody's always surprised. I'm 51.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.840
Yeah, you look great. I thought you were in your 40s, early 40s.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:15.840
But it's been amazing to have you on the medical truth podcast. I'd like to continue to have you update and come on periodically as well with the release of the book with Robert F Kennedy.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.840
Oh, I would love it. That would be great. I would love it. That would be really fun.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:29.840
Yeah. Yeah. And I'll see you get, get you a get you on sub stack too as well. I, you know, I know Paul.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.840
Dr. Paul Alexander. In fact, I actually pulled up this particular article.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.840
You gave me a couple of plugs this week. It was.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.840
Yeah, this is what got my little embarrassed actually.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.840
This has got my attention right here.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.840
JJ Kui lives inside Robert Malone's head.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.840
I love it. Kui owns Malone and Malone is not ever will never debate him on a talk or talk with him.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:02.840
This is a reason for that. I openly challenge him alone here. Put your testicles on the table.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:12.840
Yeah, it's it's it's he goes over the top a lot, but actually the article is really good and it covers my work and the work of my friend.

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:17.840
Mark Hughes, a tonic Mark Gulak in in Boston, Massachusetts.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:27.840
And he's been a great friend and he's a really skilled historian who started earlier than I did with regard to to really keeping track of this.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:40.840
And he's got a really good archive and together him and I have been just trying to run down the stories of these these new heroes and try to figure out which one of them is, you know, really a good guy and which one might not be.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:53.840
As as open minded as I am, I have to say that I've had so many incongruent interactions with Robert Malone that I have to assume that his he's got ulterior motives.

01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:07.840
I have to agree with you on that. You know, and I the first time I saw him was on Tucker Carlson and this was like maybe back in what 21 21 22 early 22.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:17.840
I think 21 was probably when he was first on Tucker. But yeah, yeah, but you know, my theory on that too is that there's a lot of people that are on the hook.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.840
And I even include President Trump on this as well. He was at fault as well.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:35.840
The only person, the true person that really stood up to a lot of this was Robert F Kennedy is President Trump kept pushing the vaccine kept pushing the vaccine and to this day still does it.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:47.840
In fact, I just posted something on sub stack as to why my question was in the article that I wrote was why this Donald President Trump still pushed the vaccine. Right.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:56.840
You know, and I just don't think any one particular politician or anybody is going to save us in this situation. And I say it.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.840
Time and time again.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:06.840
That's really the most important thing to say. No one will no one politician is going to save us. And we don't want to live in a country where we need a politician like that to save us.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.840
No, no, and I keep saying this to people.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:18.840
Listen, we have the God given right not to take this vaccine into do it. It's our decision. It's our body. It's our choice.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:27.840
And we have to stand up to that. We have to stand up to that. We're the ones where the power is in the people. There's more of us than there are them.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.840
Okay, whoever them are and we all know are starting to know who them are.

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:44.840
And, you know, as time goes on, the dark is going to be overshadowed by the light for sure. It's just a matter of time and it's happening. And there's people like you that are very courageous that are coming forward.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:53.840
And I really appreciate your work and I'm going to continue to put your work out there for sure. You got a fan now. Thanks very much, James. I'm really happy.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:06.840
You know, it's been a long lonely place. I'm sure you felt alone too. I mean, it really, even when you have these podcasts, it feels like you're in a wilderness all by yourself. So, yeah, I'm really happy to make another connection like this.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:16.840
Absolutely. You got you have definitely. So, like I said, I'll have you come on again. Your website is go ahead. You want to share that with you.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:33.840
It's Giga on biological.com. It's kind of hard to spell, but you'll learn it. And I'm also Giga on biological on Twitch, which is a it's a weird streaming platform for gamers and for weirdos, but it also keeps me nicely hidden.

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:40.840
I also try to post. I'm trying to get into the habit of reposting on rumble, but that hasn't really started yet.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:53.840
And I actually, in addition to being on your podcast was just recently on a podcast with Ahmed Malik. I think you might also have been aware of him. He's very much like you.

01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:07.840
And so, maybe my message is finally catching on. I'm going to be around in more places, but right now, Giga on biological is where I stream on Twitch and I'm doing it every night for about, I don't know, for 35 nights in a row.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:21.840
So far, I'm going to try and keep it up for a few hundred. So, it's worth checking because I'll be there almost every day. And this includes today. So, yeah, I think it's just steady pressure. So people like you have to keep going.

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:29.840
You have to keep sharing each other's work. And as we keep pushing with steady pressure, I think this thing will keep cracking.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:36.840
Well, definitely, definitely, definitely. Thank you so much for coming on to the podcast. I really appreciate Dr. Cooey.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.840
You're very welcome. It was nice meeting you, sir.

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.840
You too, sir. Thanks.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:54.840
So, what I like to do, because you're on the right track, and you got to get on sub stack, get yourself set up with sub stack, get yourself an account on sub stack as well.

01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:00.840
Because you'll start getting a lot of traction on there. I'm getting people that are signing on every day.

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.840
Yeah, it's a great. That's what you're doing. You just post your video there or what?

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:25.840
I post the videos. I started to post memes. I started to post articles. So, I'm becoming very involved with that. And then, you know, because what happens is as you start cross promoting people through sub stack, it's a great, great platform because it's almost like a place where

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:34.840
it's free and it's like where you could post a podcast. I guess the reason why I haven't started with sub stack is because I'm a terribly slow writer.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.840
And so, maybe if I did just post the video with a little caption, that might work already, maybe.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:51.840
Yeah, you know, Dr. Alexander, I'm not sure how or why he does it, but he really, I don't know if he's, I'm not sure, I probably shouldn't say.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:39:05.840
Oh, who or how he's writing, but he writes short memes, but he puts out a lot too almost too much. It's like too too much. It's like he just riddles you with a lot of stuff, you know, and it's all over the place.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:19.840
It's a politics. It's this. It's that I stick to primarily medical, you know, mostly. I've talked a lot with Paul Alexander. If you want my honest opinion.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:31.840
I think Paul Alexander, because of the role that he had in the Trump administration has seen the absolute inside of the beast. Right. So, he needs to.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:47.840
In a way that is so visible that no one can touch him. And I do think he's scared. I do think that he is respectful of the monster in a way that few people are because the few people have seen it like him.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:40:05.840
We've talked a number of times where I've had the sense that that he experiences real trepidation as to what to do next. And he is very like you and I very concerned about the future of our countries and our kids future because these people are playing for all the marbles.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:16.840
And he knows that. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that's what sometimes why he makes these over the top posts because, you know, once he got to lose at this stage, this is for all the marbles.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:29.840
If we get somebody's attention, that's what we need. We need to convert every single person we can convert. Right. And I gotta honestly tell you, I think both the Democrats and the Republicans are in on this together.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.840
Absolutely. They are. Are you kidding me? Yeah. I tell people, take the politics out of this. Absolutely.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:47.840
Take all the politics out of it because both the Democrats and Republicans are in. There's only maybe I could probably count on half of a hand. How many people are really truly legitimate in politics.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:41:03.840
I don't know. We lost somebody from Utah today in a plane crash that was just converted to our team. Who's that Utah Senator or representative that was fully on board with mandating the vaccine.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.840
And now had just come out and decided it was ridiculous. And then they, his plane crashed.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:18.840
I'm telling you, you're coming out at the right time with your message. I've been doing this. It'll be a year in January.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:32.840
I interviewed Dr. Peter Bragan. I'm sure you're familiar with him. He's a very good man. What I will do is I will try to get you involved with more podcasting. If you don't mind.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:45.840
I don't mind at all. Please spread the word. Help me. Yeah, I'm going to because there's some really good people out there. The dragons are really good people. They were actually being sued by Malone.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:56.840
So I think that particular lawsuit's going to be pretty much thrown out of court because the last lawsuit that he had against.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:08.840
Oh gosh, I can't remember who he had a lawsuit against, but it was very similar to what he was suing the dragons for. He was suing the dragons over this thing with this mask formation psychosis.

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:22.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think they're going to throw that out. But you don't go suing an 85 year old man who's a pioneer in psychiatry who pretty much I mean he is telling the truth.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:29.840
You know, yeah, I mean to be to be devil's advocate, though, just to be a creep.

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:36.840
Just to be a creep. And I'm not saying the dragons are bad, but this book doesn't challenge the narrative at all.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:45.840
It doesn't does it? No. Tell me about that. And so they think that there was a virus released and that it went around the world and it was a bio weapon and they lied about it.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:43:04.840
And so by Robert Malone suing them, he's actually selling this book, which doesn't really work against the narrative. Now, if the Breggans were to progress in their understanding of the pandemic and realize that the protocols were used to create this narrative

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:31.840
and corrected it, I would be, I would be overjoyed. But I'm afraid right now, Malone seeing our Malone's runners, let's say, or controllers or handlers seeing this book as being non threatening realize that a great way to create a controlled opposition would be to sue this, this, these authors right here.

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.840
What book is that? This is the Breggans book. We are the prey. Oh, okay, that is the we are the prey. Okay. I just didn't recognize it.

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.840
I'm not saying the Breggans did anything wrong by writing that book because when that book came out, that's what I thought too.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:56.840
But I'm saying that Robert Malone suing them is not promoting anything that he's afraid of promoting. And in fact, it's promoting exactly what he wants promoted, which is the narrative of a bio weapon.

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:07.840
Yeah. Yeah. And so you believe that there was no virus then? No, I don't, I don't say that at all. What I think is, is that there is a conflation of the background signal.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:22.840
And so it would be like telling everybody that that I've tried to come up with the right, the right analogy here. And the best one I always have is something to do with automobiles.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:37.840
First, you have to convince everybody that before 2020, there were no cars on the planet. And then once you convince them of that, you can say that a new thing called automobiles is spreading around the world.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:46.840
And the way, the way that you test for it is you go in your garage, you look for gasoline and you look for round rubber things.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:57.840
And so everybody went down to their garage that lined up and they said, wow, I've got one too. But I didn't know I had one. Oh yeah, but they're asymptomatic. It doesn't mean that you know you had it.

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:10.840
And as we tested, it turns out that there were automobiles all around the world. Right. And when people came to the hospital, a lot of people came to the hospital in automobiles.

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:21.840
Oh my gosh, everybody that comes to the hospital in an automobile should not be given antibiotics, but instead should be put on a ventilator and given remdesivir.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:30.840
Now you have a pandemic and it has nothing to do with a virus. It had to do with automobiles. And they did the same thing, but they did it with a PCR test.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:41.840
And if they had used that PCR test in 2019 and had 25,000 people drive up in their cars to take the test, they would have got the exact same numbers.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:56.840
And that's your answer. Because they would have used a generic pan coronavirus primer set to look for RNA signals that are everywhere and claimed that was a very specific signal for a new thing.

01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:09.840
Yeah, that's how that's the school of thought that Dr. Rastnik is from from as well. He doesn't believe that this was truly circulating because he did a lot of the work back in the 80s.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:21.840
Exactly. It's the same exact thing. They can put this sequence wherever they want because they can make lots of it. But wherever they put it, it doesn't start flying around the world.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:33.840
The better example might be, oh, I spilled blue paint on my sidewalk outside. And that's the reason why all the houses in Pittsburgh are turning blue.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:45.840
Like, no, that's not how paint works. But if I got enough paint and I went around Pittsburgh with a paint sprayer, I could make all the houses in Pittsburgh start to turn blue.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:54.840
Right. And that's exactly how they could get a coronavirus sequence to show up in New York and Wuhan and Iran and Italy is they just put it there.

01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:06.840
Right. Right. Well, I mean, like I said, in 2003, when I had the medical house call practice, we encountered the COVID with SARS sudden acute respiratory syndrome.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:14.840
And it happened to be the strain that particular flu season. In fact, it ran into three and four, those two years, the falls of those years.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:21.840
And it was pretty severe. I mean, it was severe, but it wasn't severe where they had it shut down businesses and quarantine people.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:32.840
But it was a bad flu season because, like I said, I can remember getting that flu and I don't get the flu very often very, very rarely. And if I do, I shake it within a day.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:46.840
But, you know, again, like you said, they built this narrative around this, this virus and this vaccine for the vaccine. I think they created the narrative for the vaccine. Absolutely.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:48:05.840
Instead of the vaccine for the narrative. And that's why I speculate that it could be so bad is that the virus sequence was known in advance to be appropriate to use as a transfection agent to cause antibodies to show up.

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:06.840
Yeah.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:14.840
I don't have any evidence for it, but it makes a lot of sense. If this was a plan, then they would have definitely made sure that that aspect of the plan was foolproof.

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:26.840
I mean, I don't think it's a bad thing if you got COVID. I said it from the very beginning to family. I said, we're all going to get it at some point. We're all going to contract it and our body's going to fight it off in different ways.

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:39.840
I mean, we've been we've been led to believe, James, as you well know, that that measles is something that we just could never tolerate. And therefore we have to have a vaccine. But in reality, I remembered.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:49.840
And I found the clip. They had a Brady Bunch episode where they had a had a had a had a chalkboard with all the kids on it and what they'd had.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:58.840
And the measles was going through the house. And nobody was panicking. They were even joking about the fact that one of them might be faking it.

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:15.840
And and and the thing about that that bothers me the most is that when measles was deadly, we weren't exactly as sophisticated as we are now with our public health and our medicine. I mean, we were significantly less sophisticated.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:26.840
And so when kids used to go deaf from measles in extreme situations, my guess is is that if we treated it appropriately now that wouldn't happen nearly as often.

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:33.840
And the same goes with deaths. I just don't think that those numbers are realistic.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.840
And their only motivation for selling those numbers is to sell the effectiveness of the vaccine.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:55.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some advice to you. Stay on point with your content because you got phenomenal content. You're coming from a great place with a phenomenal background to be a very impactful influencer.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:00.840
So just keep yourself kind of, you know, tight.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:12.840
I love that you say that because we got a little off topic today and I don't like to speculate too much about politics and stuff. I'm really a biologist. That's where my wheel. Well, that's, yeah, we never really mentioned politics at all hardly in our conversation.

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:26.840
It was mostly biology and the virus. And that's what I wanted to do is I was looking for, that's why I was telling you to be wonderful to have you on and Dr. Judy Mike of it's in Dr. Rassnik on it.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.840
I would love them. I would probably mostly be quiet, but I would love that.

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:42.840
No, you could, you could give some good input. I think Judy Judy's kind of, she lost her husband about a year and a half ago, two years ago. So she's kind of pulled the reins back.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:49.840
She takes more of a faith based approach to her, her semblance of peace with this whole thing, I think.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:51:02.840
And I think that's where you got to get to at a point with all this to at some point is, again, it's like, I mixed it up a little I interviewed a physician today a plastic surgeon who believes in ex plants instead of implants.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:10.840
And we talked about the illnesses that are created by and caused by implants. So he does ex plants. That's his specialty.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.840
So I kind of break it up a little bit.

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:23.840
Yeah, I'm at your service. I just want to get this biology out and continue to teach when I can. So every opportunity, I'll be there.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:40.840
Get yourself on sub stack. If you can't join tonight and get yourself going and load up, maybe load up some videos, but really stay on point with that because it's a phenomenal, phenomenal platform for you to get a lot of followers and I can see you getting a lot of followers.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:50.840
Okay, I appreciate the advice. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. You have an awesome evening. Okay, see you. Thanks. All right. Bye.

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:59.840
All right, I don't know if I was supposed to keep that streaming or not, but I did. Thank you very much for listening. I'm sorry I couldn't show you James's video, but that's the way Google works.

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:07.840
If I show it there, then it'll infinitely display it on his stream. So I didn't want to do that.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:16.840
I feel the same way as you do in the chat. I'm not really down with Judy Mickovitz because I feel like a lot of what she talks about is kind of snake oil.

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:19.840
I'm not sure what really happened with her history.

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:25.840
I'm not sure if she's lying or her boss is lying or they're both lying.

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:33.840
So it would be an interesting conversation that again I would probably be quiet and humble in, but I might be able to get a couple questions in.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:46.840
And I do think that David Raznik is a much more straight up player in the sense that he's less certain about things and just certain that things are not what they seem, whereas Judy seems to be a little more certain about the truth.

01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:58.840
And that makes me a little more skeptical of her. But again, at this stage, I just want to get out there as much as I can and exercise my lungs. And so I'm going to accept every invitation that I get up into a point.

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:06.840
So anyway, thanks for joining me. I hope you didn't feel like it was a complete waste of your time with only me on the screen.

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:19.840
I will not do another stream tonight because it is 801 and I'm tired and I did a couple interviews today and so it's a little unplanned short stream tonight but that's the way it is.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:27.840
I hope you're not disappointed. I will be on, of course, tomorrow because that's what I do a stream every day. So thanks for joining me.

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.840
I won't do anything fancy out here.

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.840
Thank you very much guys. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:56.840
See you next time.
