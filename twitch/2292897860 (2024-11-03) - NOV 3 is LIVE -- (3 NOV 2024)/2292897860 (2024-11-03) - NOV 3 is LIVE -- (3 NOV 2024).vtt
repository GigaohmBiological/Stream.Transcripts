WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:06.431
Can you get me cleaning or toilet paper I

00:28.356 --> 00:30.557
When you switch the microphone, let me switch it.

00:31.297 --> 00:31.417
OK.

00:31.437 --> 00:32.758
Then I can help you move the mic.

00:33.178 --> 00:33.919
Got it.

00:42.082 --> 00:45.704
Anybody that has a mobile connection and wants to test the stream can.

00:45.724 --> 00:46.644
Oh, we got one.

00:46.984 --> 00:47.565
We got one.

00:47.605 --> 00:48.245
Hi, Tony.

00:50.006 --> 00:50.246
Good.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.210
Good good good.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.651
I think we're going to stop recording because.

01:00.212 --> 01:02.132
This is going to screw things up, I think.

01:04.013 --> 01:04.513
Let's see.

01:13.796 --> 01:17.317
And will set a different setting for.

01:18.978 --> 01:19.458
Output.

01:22.128 --> 01:23.429
Yeah, I'm going to just stop recording.

01:23.649 --> 01:24.851
We'll see we're going to get it on.

01:24.871 --> 01:27.073
We're going to get it online anyway from Twitch.

01:27.153 --> 01:27.853
I can download it.

01:29.375 --> 01:31.036
So you can see it's really crowded.

01:32.418 --> 01:33.539
I think you can hear me.

01:34.279 --> 01:37.803
Can you give me a little sound check their free mayonnaise or Fletcher anybody?

01:43.794 --> 01:48.696
The stream is going to be a little glitchy because of the nature of our setup here.

01:49.476 --> 01:53.197
But I think it's going to be a nice little thing.

01:54.097 --> 01:56.438
I see some excellent, excellent test run.

01:56.558 --> 01:58.059
It's absolutely a test run.

01:58.659 --> 02:03.860
We're not going to have any music because the way that the audio is set up here, I couldn't troubleshoot it in time.

02:04.741 --> 02:09.042
So the buzzers are only visible and hearable in the room.

02:13.154 --> 02:14.294
I'm glad that it sounds good.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.275
That should mean that both mics should sound pretty good.

02:17.816 --> 02:20.397
We're only live on Twitch, so don't look for us anywhere else.

02:22.918 --> 02:25.839
I think we have all the things going.

02:25.919 --> 02:28.420
A little soft is what it's going to be, unfortunately.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.921
I'm not going to be able to troubleshoot that.

02:31.981 --> 02:35.663
I should be able to turn it up, but this is as loud as it's going to go right now.

02:35.763 --> 02:37.103
So we're just going to leave it like this.

02:37.143 --> 02:39.104
It's a little soft, but I hope everybody can hear it.

02:40.524 --> 02:41.685
You can hear the effects too.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.247
You can hear that?

02:50.668 --> 02:56.230
Yeah, the glitchiness probably stopped because I stopped recording it, so I'm gonna have to download it from Twitch, but it's happening.

02:57.131 --> 03:00.472
Okay, I think we're ready.

03:04.253 --> 03:05.914
Sorry, I'll go like this and go like this.

03:07.534 --> 03:08.515
I think we're kinda ready.

03:12.168 --> 03:13.449
Yeah, the balloons are sweet.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.130
You can see them right there.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.050
We're ready to go.

03:17.251 --> 03:18.412
Your mic is live.

03:18.952 --> 03:22.474
I can put you up whenever you're ready, Mr. Scott Shara.

03:25.396 --> 03:26.437
I can actually do this.

03:26.517 --> 03:27.978
Why don't I just do this?

03:28.238 --> 03:31.720
No, no, you can both, because then you can... Oh, please didn't tell me.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.301
I didn't lose it already.

03:34.141 --> 03:34.822
But anyway, here.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.143
Now you have a mic.

03:36.763 --> 03:37.363
I don't need a mic.

03:38.324 --> 03:39.425
I can talk to you without a mic.

03:43.614 --> 03:51.381
You got a metal plate down there?

03:56.705 --> 03:57.426
Was that recorded?

03:59.828 --> 04:02.170
Good, we're starting with the humor right out of the chute.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.130
There it is.

04:05.052 --> 04:05.532
And you're first?

04:05.612 --> 04:08.835
You're going to be first?

04:12.921 --> 04:13.521
Cindy will be.

04:13.861 --> 04:14.982
Well, I will be.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.062
I'm just going to introduce Cindy.

04:16.082 --> 04:18.343
Are you doing the intro too, Jake?

04:18.903 --> 04:19.103
What?

04:19.283 --> 04:20.264
Are you doing the intro too?

04:20.364 --> 04:21.684
I'm not actually going to do an intro.

04:21.724 --> 04:21.985
Nothing?

04:22.005 --> 04:23.345
You're not going to do an intro.

04:23.365 --> 04:23.845
All right.

04:23.885 --> 04:26.526
There was no music, so there's no music.

04:26.546 --> 04:26.586
OK.

04:39.215 --> 04:44.539
So does this project, do we have a... It should be also in the room, but it's not gonna be super loud.

04:45.020 --> 04:45.460
That's fine.

04:46.241 --> 04:49.443
Because if I put it up too loud, it'll feedback on it.

04:49.464 --> 04:50.685
I'm gonna adjust it on the fly.

04:50.805 --> 04:55.228
Your live sound is fine, it's the inside of the room, so if everybody... No problem.

04:55.949 --> 04:57.290
Everybody take your seats.

04:58.171 --> 04:59.912
Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to start.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.356
Bring your purchases to the counter.

05:13.905 --> 05:15.651
You need to be able to see the screen.

05:15.671 --> 05:17.336
All right, here we go.

05:45.026 --> 05:46.226
Well, good afternoon, everyone.

05:46.827 --> 05:47.527
Thanks for coming.

05:48.287 --> 05:55.529
My name is Grace's dad, and my wife Cindy is next to me, and she's going to do a brief introduction as to why we are here.

05:56.510 --> 05:59.791
Before that, I just want to tell you I have gotten to know Jay

06:00.491 --> 06:01.091
fairly well.

06:01.171 --> 06:04.333
We essentially met each other over the phone.

06:04.973 --> 06:07.254
He was on the same path as me.

06:07.314 --> 06:13.937
I thought, is there anybody else that sees this, that the lab leak is a deception to get us to believe COVID was real?

06:14.518 --> 06:16.338
And he uncovered that before I did.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.360
And so as God would have it, I called him.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.162
And our first conversation was for an hour over the phone, and we hit it off.

06:23.222 --> 06:23.982
And here I am today.

06:24.582 --> 06:25.943
So it's fantastic to be here.

06:26.918 --> 06:31.603
And when I get to the point of my presentation, Cindy's going to do an introduction relative to Grace.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.266
But I asked Jay, what should I talk about?

06:34.867 --> 06:35.948
And he said, it doesn't matter.

06:36.008 --> 06:38.671
So I have enough to offend everybody in here.

06:38.951 --> 06:40.252
I just want to warn you ahead of time.

06:40.853 --> 06:42.014
All right, so here we go.

06:42.074 --> 06:47.320
Cindy's going to start out giving you a story of Grace's life.

06:47.860 --> 06:48.181
Here we go.

06:51.462 --> 06:52.062
Good afternoon.

06:52.843 --> 07:00.066
This is a pretty big task to take on because Grace was phenomenal.

07:00.406 --> 07:14.813
And to put it into 10 minutes is gonna be a little bit tough, but I will give you as much of an overview of who Grace was and what her life was like, and how she blessed our life, so that you can feel like you knew her in those 10 minutes.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.015
So first of all, when Scott and I,

07:19.289 --> 07:45.636
Decided that we were gonna have another baby We were not Christians prior to that and we had a son Travis and a daughter Jessica And we were living the American dream is so we thought and then God put it upon our heart we our hearts were open to him and he put it upon our heart to open up that door to have more children and lo and behold he blessed us with a pregnancy and we did not know that we were carrying a baby that had Down syndrome and I

07:46.176 --> 07:52.678
It wouldn't have mattered if we would have, because we were going to accept whatever God was blessing us with, and that's really what Grace was.

07:52.718 --> 07:56.200
She was a blessing to us, the biggest blessing you could have ever imagined.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.122
And I hope that most people that have special-needs children do look at them that way, and we looked at Grace that way.

08:05.003 --> 08:10.445
And so, once we turned it over to the Lord, He blessed us with Grace, and the day that she was born was just phenomenal.

08:11.585 --> 08:13.526
And she had a special...

08:14.486 --> 08:21.230
feature amongst herself that we didn't even pick up on until she fanned out her hand, and it fanned out like a star.

08:21.730 --> 08:26.633
And as I look at life now, and I look at what she brought to our life, she was really a star.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.076
She was a star for our life, but also a star for the Lord.

08:30.096 --> 08:30.876
She shined for Him.

08:31.356 --> 08:35.459
She shined for Him every moment that she had the ability to do so.

08:36.359 --> 08:40.982
And so, her baby picture is one of the precious things that we looked at.

08:42.483 --> 08:44.104
did whatever we put in her path.

08:44.784 --> 08:56.711
The doctor, when she was first born, in the delivery room had seen that she had Down syndrome, suspected she had Down syndrome, and they had come to us first and said, we suspect that your child has Down syndrome.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.251
Do you want this baby?

08:58.311 --> 09:02.874
Because we have people waiting in the wings for children such as these, is what they said to us.

09:03.574 --> 09:05.256
And we had said, yes, we want this baby.

09:05.356 --> 09:07.839
This is our gift from the Lord.

09:08.419 --> 09:11.182
And so from that day on, we looked at Grace differently.

09:11.262 --> 09:19.790
And her NIC unit doctor, who ended up taking over Grace's care, she had said to us something very special.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.991
And we held on to that, and that was,

09:21.952 --> 09:27.074
When you have a child with special needs, you can bring them up in two different atmospheres.

09:27.374 --> 09:30.096
And in one atmosphere, that child may flourish, and in another, it may not.

09:30.896 --> 09:36.439
And so, we looked at Grace in a different way because that doctor told us to look at Grace as the sky's the limit.

09:36.919 --> 09:37.539
And so, we did.

09:37.559 --> 09:40.941
Whatever we put in her path, she took and she just went with it.

09:41.401 --> 09:45.723
And so, from little on, Grace, as I said earlier, just blessed our life.

09:46.363 --> 09:48.825
She rode horse since she was three years old.

09:49.586 --> 09:50.547
She learned how to sign.

09:50.647 --> 09:52.449
She signed about 100 words.

09:53.129 --> 09:59.615
And as she got older and started to ride the horse, she ended up dropping the sign and saying the word.

10:00.268 --> 10:08.552
And she became my little jabberbox, and she was so excited to tell everybody that she was my jabberbox, because people asked, well, how come Grace's speech is so clear and crisp?

10:08.612 --> 10:14.415
And we said, well, one, the Lord is blessing her, but second of all, she started to ride horse, which they called hippotherapy.

10:15.035 --> 10:21.178
And in the end, she just became just a little beam of light with her ability to speak.

10:21.898 --> 10:27.382
Everything that we put in Grace's path, like as I said, she took on with a vengeance.

10:27.962 --> 10:33.026
So she helped us with numerous things in our daily activities.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.588
But she learned how to mow lawn and she loved that.

10:36.729 --> 10:42.172
One of the cute stories about her mowing lawn was she was on her little rider and I was on a different rider one day.

10:42.733 --> 10:45.335
I'm watching the path that we had carved out for her,

10:46.095 --> 10:57.040
to dwindle down, but it took Grace a little bit longer, and while I watched her, she was mowing three of the four sides, because there was a tree on the fourth side, and she would spin around, and she would trap the tree as she came around.

10:57.640 --> 11:04.083
And it was just so precious, because Grace made every opportunity, or every job, some kind of fun with it.

11:04.123 --> 11:09.005
So to her, that day with mowing the lawn was just kind of a fun activity, because she's touching the tree and mowing the lawn.

11:09.565 --> 11:11.366
But she did the mowing the lawn.

11:11.426 --> 11:13.048
She learned how to play violin.

11:13.108 --> 11:15.629
First she started with piano, and then she wanted to try guitar.

11:15.990 --> 11:20.433
But her fingers were just a little bit short, and so she said, Mom, I just can't get my fingers around the neck of the guitar.

11:20.453 --> 11:21.253
Can I try violin?

11:21.694 --> 11:23.615
And she tried violin, and she just went with it.

11:25.036 --> 11:25.597
She loved it.

11:25.757 --> 11:28.719
And then we later on learned how to play ukulele together, her and I.

11:29.219 --> 11:34.946
But her violin was her passion and she always thought that one day she would maybe play in an orchestra.

11:35.427 --> 11:39.472
That was one of her dreams that she had and we thought she could too.

11:39.512 --> 11:41.734
But she played for her big sister's wedding.

11:41.955 --> 11:43.396
She played a beautiful Elvis song.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.498
She fell in love with Elvis.

11:45.218 --> 11:54.623
And from that love of Elvis' music just grew the desire then to actually go to Graceland and meet Priscilla Presley.

11:55.123 --> 12:05.528
And prior to that, which is a really cool story, is we had been listening to Elvis Presley's music and watching his films and so on.

12:06.108 --> 12:08.331
And so this passion for Elvis came to be.

12:08.851 --> 12:15.017
And she wanted to find out if they still did any type of fan mail to anybody that wrote to Graceland.

12:15.037 --> 12:16.559
So Grace actually wrote to Graceland.

12:17.079 --> 12:20.322
And it was two months, and we still hadn't heard anything from Graceland.

12:20.623 --> 12:28.130
And so we called there, and I just said, hey, by the chance, you know, my daughter had sent a note in to Priscilla Presley and wondered if she got it.

12:28.991 --> 12:31.112
And they said, yes, we still answer fan mail.

12:31.193 --> 12:34.735
And we're hoping that we would be hearing something back.

12:34.775 --> 12:35.395
But we hadn't yet.

12:35.415 --> 12:37.156
And she said, well, let me inquire.

12:37.196 --> 12:39.438
Well, within a few days, we got a phone call.

12:39.938 --> 12:44.761
And it was actually Priscilla Presley personally asking if Grace was at her house.

12:44.821 --> 12:48.964
And I almost didn't pick up the phone because it said it was coming in from Beverly Hills.

12:48.984 --> 12:50.605
And I'm like, I don't know anybody from Beverly Hills.

12:51.065 --> 12:54.347
But I picked it up, and lo and behold, here was this phone call.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.909
Priscilla had invited to meet Grace.

12:56.929 --> 13:03.934
She apologized for us not getting an answer from the fan mail, but invited us to come down.

13:03.974 --> 13:06.016
At that time, Grace was 14 years old.

13:08.797 --> 13:12.978
She said, if you're ever in Graceland, and I would just love to meet Grace.

13:13.358 --> 13:16.999
We got off the phone, we called dad, and he said, dad, we just got this opportunity to meet Priscilla Presley.

13:17.439 --> 13:23.400
It was the anniversary of Elvis's death coming up, and so we took her, and oh my gosh, it was the best thing.

13:23.460 --> 13:29.822
She got to meet Priscilla, and she told Priscilla, I was the same age that you were when you met Elvis and so on.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.124
She just, she shined for Priscilla.

13:33.244 --> 13:34.806
It was just one of the neatest things.

13:34.846 --> 13:37.829
And you can see in the picture, it was when she met Priscilla.

13:38.449 --> 13:44.155
And we would go and meet up with other Elvis tribute artists as she was younger and as she got older.

13:44.215 --> 13:49.300
And she would just enjoy being pulled up on stage and she would do her Elvis moves and so on.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.803
And so she had lots of opportunities just to shine.

13:53.624 --> 13:58.347
But the big thing was when she was old enough in high school, she got an opportunity.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.488
We homeschooled, and so we had a lot of opportunities.

14:00.508 --> 14:02.449
She got to be quite the actor.

14:03.070 --> 14:09.533
And so in a lot of the plays that we did, they would incorporate an Elvis part for Grace to have during her

14:11.074 --> 14:13.696
her presentations and so she took those opportunities.

14:13.736 --> 14:21.022
One time she was a mechanic and the mechanic ended up having this love for Elvis and so Grace stepped off stage and came back as she was dressed up like Elvis.

14:21.643 --> 14:35.494
So Grace, again, just took her opportunities and just shared anything that she could about who Elvis was, but then also about the Lord because she tied in those things with her different activities that she did.

14:37.195 --> 14:46.098
She was a beam of light in our family, and our joy that we have lost is unbelievable.

14:46.679 --> 14:54.242
The same hospital that Grace ended up staying in when she was a baby because she had the hole in her heart, which I was meaning to tell you.

14:54.922 --> 14:59.124
She was born at a different hospital in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, but then when she was born she had

14:59.944 --> 15:03.246
atrial septal defect, which meant that she had a hole in her upper chambers of her heart.

15:03.787 --> 15:06.368
And so they whisked her to the NIC unit, which was at St.

15:06.408 --> 15:10.530
Elizabeth's, which ultimately ended up being the same hospital that ended up taking her life, sadly.

15:12.592 --> 15:13.812
And so it's bittersweet.

15:13.832 --> 15:21.196
We have memories of Grace's blessings when she was a baby there, but then also the horrific ending to Grace's life that happened at the exact same hospital.

15:21.817 --> 15:24.698
But with her hole in her heart, it didn't...

15:26.199 --> 15:30.705
It didn't take long for her to overcome that.

15:30.785 --> 15:39.556
Grace actually had the opportunity, even as a baby, to shine for the hospital cardiologist that would come up from a little town called Madison, Wisconsin.

15:39.736 --> 15:44.402
And he was just blown away that Grace's hole in her heart was closing all on its own.

15:45.103 --> 15:53.209
And we kept telling him it was because of the fact that we were one, believed that the Lord had his hands upon Grace, but also we had a lot of people praying.

15:53.649 --> 15:58.673
And so he ultimately ended up being led to the Lord through her just as a baby.

15:59.213 --> 16:01.154
And so Grace's life was really like that.

16:01.254 --> 16:05.958
She has been saving lives throughout her whole life, just actually

16:06.698 --> 16:12.727
beaming for the Lord and not being bashful about it, but then even in her death now, Grace's light has shined.

16:13.187 --> 16:21.539
We've saved several people's lives in hospitals that we would have thought were safe to be in, and now ultimately see that they're not safe to be in.

16:21.559 --> 16:23.082
They weren't safe when Grace was going in.

16:23.762 --> 16:44.157
and still aren't safe, and now as we uncover things, it's been unsafe for some time, but we've been trusting and thinking in a certain way, and sadly, we know that this life that we have here on Earth is very, very, how do I wanna say it?

16:47.160 --> 16:51.263
Is very trying, because we know that the devil is in charge of this world.

16:54.176 --> 17:03.567
As the devil's in charge of this world, we know that things are not going to be as joyous as we know, but we do know who's the victor, and the victor is the Lord, and he's got all this.

17:04.308 --> 17:13.058
We just have to hold on to that, that knowledge, and to know that, okay, there are people out there, just like Grace was, who would take...

17:14.700 --> 17:17.843
his light and try and shine it amongst the evil.

17:18.443 --> 17:20.465
And that's really what we're also trying to do.

17:20.965 --> 17:24.488
We're hoping to open up people's eyes to see what's really going on in this world.

17:25.129 --> 17:29.632
And through our blessing that we had with Grace, I want to leave you with this note.

17:30.353 --> 17:31.173
She was our angel.

17:32.114 --> 17:41.003
And the reason I feel that totally is because I was at a workshop one time with Scott, and there was a quiet time that we all had during that weekend.

17:41.543 --> 17:48.670
And it was the last day of the three-day weekend that I had with Scott, and I was like, Lord, you haven't spoken to me at all through the whole weekend.

17:49.031 --> 17:52.454
And during my last quiet time, God took me to Hebrews chapter 13.

17:53.755 --> 18:03.108
And in Hebrews chapter 13, verses 2, it mentions about the fact that... I'm just going to quickly read it.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.132
It says that...

18:09.212 --> 18:15.337
It says, do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

18:15.837 --> 18:22.683
And then I read a little bit further, and it said in Hebrews 13, verse 9, it said, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace.

18:23.083 --> 18:23.864
And it just hit me.

18:23.884 --> 18:26.586
It was like, oh my gosh, God just finally spoke to me.

18:26.966 --> 18:30.289
And he spoke to me and let me know that grace was our angel unawares.

18:32.590 --> 18:40.333
Because of that angel, we've had the opportunity to just shine his light and expose the evil.

18:40.853 --> 18:46.616
And we really feel that all of you guys being here are part of that mission that God has set us on.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.036
And so we thank you all for being here.

18:48.596 --> 18:50.597
And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Scott.

19:08.928 --> 19:12.209
OK, so we see that biology is the way.

19:12.789 --> 19:19.130
And Cindy told you that we asked the Lord for a blessing.

19:19.730 --> 19:20.990
We're 39 years old.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.311
Nobody does that, right?

19:22.451 --> 19:27.371
We had 2.1 kids, 1.7 dogs, no cats.

19:28.232 --> 19:28.892
Praise God.

19:28.912 --> 19:32.332
And it's OK.

19:32.412 --> 19:35.113
Remember, I said I have enough to offend everybody.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.171
Well, just quickly, Grace knew I was allergic to cats.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.752
I was telling one of you guys this last night.

19:40.772 --> 19:43.134
So she said, Dad, how do you know I'm allergic to cats?

19:43.154 --> 19:43.874
Yeah, I was telling Mark.

19:43.894 --> 19:48.596
I said, well, because every time a cat goes in front of me, my right leg goes up uncontrollably.

19:50.197 --> 19:52.979
So then we got cat lovers there.

19:53.019 --> 19:53.959
OK, hang on.

19:54.159 --> 19:58.141
I'm just joking around, all right?

19:58.161 --> 20:01.483
So I told her, well, my eye is itchy, Grace.

20:01.923 --> 20:02.224
Dad.

20:03.351 --> 20:05.973
If you really had an allergy, both eyes would be itching.

20:06.013 --> 20:06.974
So she was on to me.

20:07.894 --> 20:08.535
It was cute.

20:08.855 --> 20:10.496
So anyway, biology is the way.

20:11.277 --> 20:16.181
So we're 39 years old, and we turn the baby department over to God.

20:16.201 --> 20:19.983
So does anybody want to know what happened next?

20:20.924 --> 20:21.725
Or can you guess?

20:23.083 --> 20:26.384
So this is one thing Jay said is keep it G-rated.

20:26.464 --> 20:30.106
So I'm just going to tell you a fertile myrtle was pregnant five minutes later.

20:30.506 --> 20:35.488
And then nine months later, we had the beautiful blessing of our daughter, Grace.

20:36.048 --> 20:38.849
All right, so I want to jump into

20:41.087 --> 20:41.968
what I'm going to talk about.

20:42.008 --> 20:47.673
You see the title, Hospitals and Scare Homes are Federally Mandated Killing Fields.

20:47.733 --> 20:51.477
But before that, I am going to talk a little bit more about Grace.

20:52.057 --> 20:57.963
So first, on the left-hand side, that was my hair color before we hired the legal team.

21:00.851 --> 21:09.393
Having a lawsuit is one of the biggest nightmares you could ever have, but praise God, he opened the door, and we're simply being obedient and walking through it.

21:10.253 --> 21:13.033
On the right is Grace dressed as Elvis.

21:14.134 --> 21:17.054
So Grace could public speak, believe it or not.

21:17.114 --> 21:20.815
She wasn't afraid to get up and sing, dance, whatever.

21:21.435 --> 21:26.136
And so that's her dressed as Elvis in front of our church group at the time.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.420
We have a farm.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.521
This is Grace on the left.

21:31.861 --> 21:33.703
We nursed this calf back to health.

21:34.783 --> 21:36.084
She named her Rosebud.

21:36.304 --> 21:40.106
On the right, Grace was almost 13 in this picture.

21:40.147 --> 21:41.868
This is the first day she drove.

21:43.008 --> 21:44.329
So we went to our hunting property.

21:44.369 --> 21:45.910
Grace was a deer hunter.

21:46.630 --> 21:51.874
She was extremely accurate with a rifle because I told her, you know, just squeeze the trigger.

21:51.914 --> 21:53.775
So she never learned how to flinch.

21:54.395 --> 21:55.496
She was great with a rifle.

21:55.956 --> 21:57.277
So we're at a deer hunting property.

21:58.553 --> 22:00.497
And we get there and Grace said, Dad, can I drive?

22:01.118 --> 22:01.740
I said, you bet.

22:02.585 --> 22:06.946
So at that point, I had a 3 quarter ton Dodge diesel mega cab.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.526
You know, this thing is a monster truck.

22:08.566 --> 22:11.607
So when she, at that point, was probably 4 foot, 4 foot 1.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.387
You can see her behind the wheel.

22:14.087 --> 22:17.708
So I said, OK, Grace, you've got to shift into drive.

22:18.468 --> 22:21.809
Put your ease onto the gas pedal.

22:22.329 --> 22:23.689
So she did everything just great.

22:23.729 --> 22:25.210
I said, OK, now try the brakes.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.910
You just about go through the windshield.

22:27.390 --> 22:31.831
So now we practice a few times, and then it dawns on me, OK, this is a problem.

22:32.762 --> 22:34.623
So guys, you know what the problem is, right?

22:35.544 --> 22:36.605
She's going to tell mom.

22:37.926 --> 22:41.688
So we have about an hour drive back to our house.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.970
I said, Grace, you can't tell mom.

22:45.391 --> 22:46.191
You can't tell mom.

22:46.251 --> 22:47.412
We practice this the whole time.

22:47.452 --> 22:50.214
You can't tell her because she's not going to like this.

22:50.774 --> 22:52.215
So we get home.

22:52.315 --> 22:54.657
She's in the door less than a split second.

22:55.017 --> 22:55.678
Dad, let me drive.

22:57.830 --> 23:01.091
So I was in the doghouse for about a week or so.

23:01.351 --> 23:02.371
She's up here today.

23:02.972 --> 23:06.453
Most of the times when I'm speaking, it's by myself, so I can get away with a lot.

23:06.493 --> 23:10.374
But now, since she's here, she can criticize me publicly.

23:10.434 --> 23:11.534
So that's OK.

23:11.594 --> 23:14.135
So when that happens today, it's expected.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.335
I'm setting the stage right now.

23:19.897 --> 23:23.858
Grace called us earthly mom and earthly dad.

23:24.878 --> 23:25.938
We did not teach her that.

23:26.419 --> 23:27.379
She did it on her own.

23:27.979 --> 23:34.002
There's so many stories I could tell you about her connection with our Lord, but she came up with this on her own.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.843
It was a miracle to me to see that.

23:36.403 --> 23:37.964
Grace had quite a sense of humor.

23:39.244 --> 23:40.645
And you see the sign on the right.

23:41.946 --> 23:46.307
So when Grace saw that sign for the first time, she said, Dad, look at that sign.

23:46.828 --> 23:47.768
So what does it say?

23:48.869 --> 23:49.649
Anybody have an idea?

23:55.174 --> 23:57.396
She said, watch out for falling bikes.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.480
That's what it says, right?

24:01.140 --> 24:04.324
So we got into this literal humor as a family.

24:05.405 --> 24:11.191
Most of you wouldn't know, Grace has two siblings, our son Travis and our daughter Jessica.

24:11.251 --> 24:12.112
Grace was the youngest.

24:12.152 --> 24:16.056
But Travis died of suicide three years before Grace.

24:17.077 --> 24:20.801
And Travis is the one who introduced our family to literal humor.

24:20.841 --> 24:22.442
And Grace picked up on it.

24:23.123 --> 24:24.104
She just had it down.

24:24.684 --> 24:32.832
So how Travis got us into it, one day, when I noticed it, he was maybe five, six years old.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.934
I'm reading a newspaper, and Travis came into the kitchen.

24:35.995 --> 24:37.116
Dad, can you help me with this?

24:37.156 --> 24:39.177
I said, just give me a second.

24:39.298 --> 24:39.978
And he said to me.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.820
When people say a second, why don't they mean it?

24:42.840 --> 24:45.261
And I thought, oh, wow, that's right.

24:46.082 --> 24:52.205
And so then, it ratcheted up as he realized that he's funny doing this.

24:52.745 --> 25:00.249
When we used to be in the Catholic Church SIAP, Travis was a dilly-daller.

25:00.550 --> 25:04.992
So Cindy said to him one Sunday morning, Travis, I am not telling you again.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.913
No more dilly-dalling around.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.855
And Travis said, how come you just told me again, Mom?

25:10.825 --> 25:12.606
And I thought, oh my gosh, I couldn't stand it.

25:12.626 --> 25:15.167
You're supposed to support your wife, but you can't then.

25:15.207 --> 25:17.348
I mean, you're peeing your pants laughing.

25:17.789 --> 25:21.570
So it was just so, and so Grace picked up on this.

25:21.631 --> 25:30.835
The first time I had the opportunity to teach her this, this whole thought process of this literal humor, I must have done something wrong, because Cindy said, you've got to go to Walmart.

25:31.255 --> 25:32.816
And she knows I hate that store.

25:32.836 --> 25:34.257
So I said, hey, Grace, why don't you come with me?

25:35.472 --> 25:37.553
So we're driving to Walmart, she's about five years old.

25:38.033 --> 25:42.835
I said, Grace, just so you know, everyone who shops at Walmart is a zombie.

25:44.475 --> 25:48.317
So we get into Walmart, she starts poking people in the stomach.

25:50.175 --> 25:54.377
Dad, they're not zombies.

25:54.777 --> 25:57.719
So you can see how she would pick up on that sign.

25:57.759 --> 26:00.300
I mean, it became this routine.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.022
There are so many of these things that her and I did together.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.223
It was a gift.

26:05.243 --> 26:09.405
So I'll show you one more quick one, and then we're going to get into the serious part of the presentation.

26:10.185 --> 26:12.688
So this is an example of a sign.

26:12.708 --> 26:17.132
A lot of people are looking for, you know, we want a sign from God to know what we're doing, right?

26:17.512 --> 26:20.936
So this is a sign that was in our hotel room.

26:22.637 --> 26:25.000
So you can see it's a sprinkler head.

26:26.301 --> 26:28.523
Contact with the sprinkler will cause flooding.

26:29.224 --> 26:30.045
And it's got a hanger.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.739
Well, I mean, it never dawned on me to hang something on that.

26:34.239 --> 26:37.822
I mean, these signs give you ideas that you never had before, right?

26:38.262 --> 26:44.887
So now you have your family in the hotel, and they only give you a couple of hangers.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.228
Well, you gotta have a place for the swimming suits from the hot tub.

26:47.248 --> 26:51.211
Well, they're telling you exactly what to do if you just pay attention to the signs, right?

26:51.872 --> 26:52.672
All right, here we go.

26:52.752 --> 26:53.773
Now we're getting serious.

26:53.853 --> 26:56.835
Grace's last day on Earth was October 13th of 2021.

26:56.895 --> 26:57.796
I put this timetable together.

27:02.486 --> 27:03.647
after we got the records.

27:05.447 --> 27:18.352
We went to the hospital on October 6th of 2021, first to urgent care and ultimately to the hospital, not because of anything other than the COVID PSYOP.

27:19.113 --> 27:23.695
We were monitoring Grace's oxygen, unfortunately, with a pulse ox.

27:24.455 --> 27:26.936
And we bought a pulse ox because of the fact that

27:28.274 --> 27:30.637
We were following the FLCCC protocol.

27:31.137 --> 27:32.319
It said get a pulse ox.

27:32.399 --> 27:34.381
We had no business buying a pulse ox.

27:34.761 --> 27:41.709
By the way, this presentation, if anybody wants the slideshow, my cards are over on the side.

27:41.890 --> 27:42.971
And you can just email me.

27:43.011 --> 27:45.994
I'll send you the slideshow via Dropbox.

27:46.215 --> 27:47.816
There's some embedded video, so it's long.

27:47.837 --> 27:48.818
So you don't have to take pictures.

27:50.259 --> 27:52.941
And then there's no pads on the table.

27:53.521 --> 27:58.284
We're going to do questions afterward, of course, so just take your notes and I'm glad to answer any questions.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.046
So we're following the FLCCC protocol.

28:02.467 --> 28:15.776
And so we had a wedding we're going to go to on October 1st and Grace had a cold and we just were under the idea that it's our civic duty to not spread cold, not to spread COVID.

28:16.877 --> 28:17.878
So Cindy went to the

28:18.718 --> 28:22.002
The Walgreens in Appleton got a home COVID test.

28:22.342 --> 28:25.165
We tested Grace, she tested positive, of course, right?

28:25.766 --> 28:35.357
So then we start the FLCC protocol and the oxygen saturation number went down to 88% the morning of October 6th.

28:35.797 --> 28:39.882
So we obediently to the protocol, take Grace to urgent care,

28:41.294 --> 28:44.056
That goes to, they take a blood test.

28:44.796 --> 28:49.619
Strangely, they didn't even put her on oxygen in the urgent care until after an hour.

28:49.679 --> 28:51.681
And I told them, hey, we got to get her on oxygen.

28:52.501 --> 28:53.762
That should have been a red flag.

28:54.442 --> 29:01.147
Ultimately, they said, well, she's got a high D-dimer, which a D-dimer is a legitimate blood chemistry parameter.

29:01.187 --> 29:02.828
And you've got to take her to the emergency room.

29:02.888 --> 29:06.250
So Grace and I rode in the ambulance to the emergency room.

29:06.610 --> 29:07.311
She was fine.

29:07.351 --> 29:08.331
She just had a cold.

29:09.172 --> 29:10.593
Seven days later, she was dead.

29:12.182 --> 29:13.663
And this is what they did to her.

29:13.743 --> 29:15.184
This is her last day on earth.

29:16.165 --> 29:22.749
This timetable shows the doctor called Cindy and I the morning of the 13th.

29:22.949 --> 29:27.032
I had already been taken out by an armed guard on the 10th, three days earlier.

29:27.052 --> 29:29.754
I was with Grace from the 6th until the morning of the 10th.

29:30.334 --> 29:32.015
The 10th, I'm taken out by an armed guard.

29:32.035 --> 29:34.997
She had 47 hours without advocacy.

29:35.458 --> 29:41.622
During that 47 hours, we found out they had started a sedation med called Presidex.

29:42.823 --> 29:49.167
On October 9th, they increased the dose of Presidex six different times during the 47 hours we didn't have advocacy.

29:49.548 --> 29:52.310
So they sedated my little buddy instead of taking care of her.

29:54.051 --> 30:00.256
When we turned the page then to the morning of the 13th, the doctor had told us he's going to call us

30:01.371 --> 30:08.175
the morning of the 13th after our call on the 12th, because he wanted to get our decision on a pre-authorization for a ventilator.

30:08.675 --> 30:10.196
So he called us shortly after 10.

30:10.636 --> 30:14.278
He said, what's your decision on the pre-authorization for a ventilator?

30:14.518 --> 30:15.759
And we said, we're not doing that.

30:15.779 --> 30:20.701
That was the fifth time that the challenge of the ventilator came up.

30:20.921 --> 30:25.804
Grace was never a ventilator candidate, nor should have anybody with COVID been a ventilator candidate.

30:27.489 --> 30:32.650
So we said no, he immediately switched gears and said, Grace had such a good day yesterday.

30:33.686 --> 30:38.950
which we knew she did, our daughter Jessica was now in the room with Grace, that we should work on nutrition.

30:38.990 --> 30:44.315
We should get her out of bed today, get her bowels moving so we can get her out of here in the next several days.

30:44.775 --> 30:57.285
Well, prior to the call, now that we see what Jessica's notes say, the phone records, and piecing this all together, prior to the call, he had already strapped Grace down to the bed and made her defecate in the bed.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.806
So it was a complete lie.

30:59.647 --> 31:00.428
During the call,

31:01.986 --> 31:06.409
he increased the dose of Presidex to the maximum allowable dose.

31:06.869 --> 31:09.490
So there was no intention of getting Grace out of bed.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.752
She was sedated to the maximum dose.

31:12.492 --> 31:15.614
Simultaneous with hanging up the phone, we got done with the phone call at 1055.

31:16.794 --> 31:20.977
At 1056, he put an illegal do not resuscitate order on Grace's chart.

31:22.679 --> 31:27.983
Then as the day proceeded, they combined Presidex with lorazepam and morphine.

31:28.624 --> 31:32.326
And the last dose was done in a 29-minute window.

31:32.346 --> 31:36.109
So in 29 minutes, Grace had max Presidex, lorazepam, and morphine.

31:36.650 --> 31:37.611
And they euthanized her.

31:38.311 --> 31:43.694
They euthanized her, just like they do in somebody's last hour of life in hospice care.

31:44.094 --> 31:50.538
At this point, Jessica was in the room with Grace, and she called Cindy and I on a FaceTime call, panicking.

31:50.999 --> 31:54.100
She said, Dad, Grace's numbers are dropping like crazy.

31:54.461 --> 31:55.521
I said, get the nurses in.

31:55.541 --> 31:56.542
She said, I've been trying.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.262
They refuse.

31:57.302 --> 31:59.604
So Cindy and I threw the FaceTime call.

31:59.624 --> 32:03.066
The nurses are standing outside the door with a guard.

32:04.484 --> 32:07.685
And we start screaming, save our daughter.

32:07.985 --> 32:09.906
And that's when we learned she was DNR.

32:10.006 --> 32:14.087
They hollered back from outside the room, she's DNR.

32:14.847 --> 32:16.708
And we screamed, she's not DNR.

32:16.748 --> 32:18.448
Jessica ran out into the hall.

32:18.788 --> 32:21.789
One of the nurses showed her the screen that she's DNR.

32:22.269 --> 32:25.690
And they wouldn't even come in the room, wouldn't step foot in the room.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.631
And we watched her die on that FaceTime call at 7.27 PM, October 13th of 2021.

32:32.572 --> 32:46.572
And, you know, ultimately that's why I'm here today is because of that situation has got me to become a public spokesperson against hospital protocols, but then also unraveling, why is this happening?

32:46.612 --> 32:48.395
And that's what we're going to cover today.

32:51.334 --> 32:53.175
Yeah, I'll be covering that.

32:53.475 --> 32:53.936
First time.

32:54.536 --> 32:57.918
So somebody taking tick marks as to how many times she tells me.

32:57.938 --> 32:59.679
So that's one.

33:00.159 --> 33:00.780
All right, here we go.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.161
So the medical records, it's interesting.

33:03.221 --> 33:08.605
Medical records, when you have a lawsuit, are considered prima facie evidence in a lawsuit.

33:08.665 --> 33:13.448
That means the court has to accept them as true unless you prove them otherwise.

33:14.008 --> 33:18.652
So this is the record from the COVID expert in the hospital.

33:18.672 --> 33:20.453
We've already deposed him in the lawsuit.

33:21.154 --> 33:22.575
Quite an interesting man.

33:23.656 --> 33:25.818
But I'm not going to go on that rabbit trail because of time.

33:26.218 --> 33:30.762
This is what he wrote about Grace in his first day doctor's report.

33:31.082 --> 33:32.763
This is the leader of their COVID wing.

33:33.204 --> 33:34.545
So she had Down syndrome.

33:34.565 --> 33:35.626
Of course, you'd report that.

33:35.666 --> 33:40.690
But during the seven days Grace was in the hospital in the 22 doctor's reports,

33:43.078 --> 33:45.899
referenced that Grace had Down syndrome 36 different times.

33:45.939 --> 33:47.119
I'm going to be coming back to that.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.340
You can see they referenced that we're Christian.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.541
They did that multiple times in the reports.

33:51.681 --> 33:57.683
And then the last line, he says, unfortunately, I think the patient probably would not be here if she'd been fully vaccinated.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.124
So their bias is obvious in the reports.

34:01.564 --> 34:03.885
Remember, the reports are prima facie evidence.

34:03.965 --> 34:05.185
So this isn't about evidence.

34:05.245 --> 34:10.287
But in our deposition last week, Friday, we deposed one of the doctors that

34:11.448 --> 34:15.258
increased the dose of Prasodex the morning of October 13th.

34:15.780 --> 34:19.650
Under oath, he said, I was not working that day.

34:20.785 --> 34:22.326
So wrap your head around that.

34:22.926 --> 34:24.887
So I mean, we're going to uncover what's going on.

34:24.947 --> 34:27.688
But I mean, he said he wasn't working that day.

34:27.808 --> 34:29.689
And I think his testimony was credible.

34:30.029 --> 34:35.531
So that means somebody doctored that report with his name.

34:35.571 --> 34:36.532
It was somebody else.

34:37.792 --> 34:41.894
The plot thickens as you go through and you start hearing these guys under oath.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.576
The most shocking thing to me in the deposition so far is how

34:46.616 --> 34:47.316
how they lie.

34:47.436 --> 34:50.978
I've documented about 50 different lies already in the depositions.

34:54.479 --> 35:00.081
One of the components of our lawsuit, so in a lawsuit you have complaints, we have five complaints.

35:01.021 --> 35:04.543
One of the complaints is the illegal do not resuscitate order.

35:05.523 --> 35:10.965
I had filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and they wrote back

35:11.545 --> 35:13.186
and said the doctor didn't do anything wrong.

35:13.266 --> 35:24.851
In fact, they wrote, you can see chapter 154 of the Wisconsin statutes, that's the DNR statute, does not apply to physicians operating in a hospital non-emergency room setting such as the one in question.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.451
So think through that.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.673
That means a doctor can write a DNR order on anybody he wants.

35:30.293 --> 35:32.834
And the state licensing board says that's fine.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.808
So we hired a, well, we didn't hire him.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.271
He's a friend of ours that did this without hiring him.

35:40.332 --> 35:45.457
He took this case on to present to the district attorney for criminal charges.

35:45.897 --> 35:50.962
There was already an investigation for criminal charges that we opened up, and it got deferred.

35:51.002 --> 35:53.184
So he took it upon himself to

35:54.385 --> 35:57.287
right to the district attorney's office to open this up.

35:57.407 --> 36:02.210
And we're expecting criminal charges after the civil case is done, but it's not in play right now.

36:02.610 --> 36:04.651
They kept the door open, thankfully.

36:05.331 --> 36:09.814
The DA's office, this is what the DA's office wrote in response to that letter.

36:10.214 --> 36:15.897
A doctor is not required to administer treatment she or he believes is not medically effective.

36:16.317 --> 36:18.999
This includes authorizing a DNR.

36:19.639 --> 36:23.980
The parties clearly had a dispute about how Dr. Shokar should treat Grace.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.500
Dr. Shokar did not abide by the wishes of the family.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.621
However, there is no law in Wisconsin that requires him to do so.

36:32.281 --> 36:34.041
So this has nothing to do with Wisconsin.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.522
It's just that's the state we're in.

36:35.982 --> 36:37.162
This is what's going on.

36:37.602 --> 36:42.483
Informed consent was taken away federally, legally in 2016.

36:42.883 --> 36:46.964
It was the Cures Act, C-U-R-E-S, took away informed consent.

36:47.024 --> 36:48.264
And this is what's going on.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.770
People are blind to this reality.

36:50.850 --> 36:52.835
This is what is going on in hospital settings.

36:54.861 --> 36:58.902
What Cindy was reminding me is that Grace was one of literally millions.

36:58.942 --> 37:05.664
During the 39 months of COVID, 1.2 million murders took place in hospitals, 1.2 million.

37:06.664 --> 37:08.965
So that might sound like a small number to you.

37:08.985 --> 37:15.207
Well, to give you a perspective, there's 2.8 million annual deaths in the United States every single year, 2.8 million.

37:15.347 --> 37:16.807
1.2 million during the 39 months of COVID.

37:20.233 --> 37:24.197
Hospitals worldwide were tracking these deaths.

37:24.577 --> 37:29.402
The United States, out of all 193 countries on the planet, was number one in that category.

37:29.742 --> 37:30.283
Number one.

37:30.443 --> 37:36.529
We only have 4.2% of the world's population, but we had 17% of the world's death.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.452
Number two on that list was India.

37:40.032 --> 37:49.478
India's population is four times that of the United States, but they only had 533,000 deaths, less than 50%, with a population four times that of the United States.

37:49.918 --> 37:58.363
I'm going to come back to that because God gave us a warning as to the United States' role in this killing that is going on today.

37:58.383 --> 38:01.225
Is it okay?

38:04.059 --> 38:07.101
Top three killers historically in America.

38:07.681 --> 38:09.002
Number one, heart disease.

38:09.082 --> 38:10.063
Number two, cancer.

38:10.283 --> 38:12.885
Number three, medical malpractice.

38:12.945 --> 38:17.048
I'm putting malpractice in quotes now because there is legitimate malpractice.

38:17.168 --> 38:18.088
People make mistakes.

38:18.128 --> 38:18.669
They're humans.

38:19.129 --> 38:20.790
But this is not what I'm talking about.

38:21.190 --> 38:26.194
Malpractice today is they follow standards of care that are designed to kill us.

38:26.254 --> 38:27.815
We'll be covering that in a little bit.

38:28.541 --> 38:33.203
So what I'm talking about here is not how did we get heart disease?

38:33.263 --> 38:34.643
How did we get cancer?

38:34.663 --> 38:38.864
Okay, so we got heart disease and cancer by what they're doing to us, right?

38:39.004 --> 38:40.785
Poisoning the air, poisoning the food.

38:41.265 --> 38:43.586
But this is the treatments kill the people.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.287
So when you get heart disease, they want you to go on a statin.

38:46.507 --> 38:49.548
I know that because I learned I had heart disease six years ago.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.308
They wanted me to go on a statin.

38:51.689 --> 38:52.649
I started researching.

38:53.919 --> 38:56.160
found out statins cause Alzheimer's.

38:56.861 --> 38:57.381
Number one.

38:57.441 --> 38:58.942
Statins cause heart attacks.

38:59.322 --> 38:59.823
Number two.

39:00.623 --> 39:04.606
Number three is that the purpose of the statins is to reduce your cholesterol.

39:04.946 --> 39:05.766
So it does that.

39:06.287 --> 39:07.728
But my cholesterol was over 300.

39:07.948 --> 39:09.168
Oh, it's sky high.

39:09.188 --> 39:10.329
You've got to reduce your cholesterol.

39:10.749 --> 39:15.853
Historically, cholesterol in the 800s was considered high.

39:16.253 --> 39:20.976
So this is how they have systematically got us to buy into this PSYOP.

39:21.696 --> 39:22.617
of heart disease.

39:22.637 --> 39:24.998
So the treatment for heart disease is the statin.

39:25.478 --> 39:32.661
When you take a statin, you go back to the doctor for the checkup six months later, he says, congratulations, your cholesterol is down to 150.

39:33.101 --> 39:36.803
And you pat the doctor on the back, right, because that's what he promised.

39:37.223 --> 39:39.685
Yeah, well, he promised that because that's the standard of care.

39:40.085 --> 39:42.266
This was a wake-up call that I missed.

39:42.286 --> 39:46.888
I want to go on this tangent just for a little bit because it might be the most important thing I could ever tell you.

39:48.444 --> 39:51.787
When I decided to not take the statin, so I went into the doctor.

39:51.807 --> 39:53.949
I showed him what my research and what I'm doing.

39:54.229 --> 39:59.574
And to my surprise, he said, what you have learned is 10 years ahead of what I know.

40:00.375 --> 40:02.477
And so I told him I'm not taking the statin.

40:02.557 --> 40:03.598
His nurse was in the room.

40:03.678 --> 40:06.501
She walked me out and said, Scott, you have to take the statin.

40:07.121 --> 40:08.202
I said, what are you talking about?

40:08.242 --> 40:09.363
I don't have to do anything.

40:10.264 --> 40:10.945
And she said, are?

40:13.536 --> 40:21.864
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates are based on what percentage of our patient population follows the standard of care.

40:21.884 --> 40:24.106
I said, I'm not on Medicare and Medicaid.

40:24.406 --> 40:25.407
She said, you didn't hear me.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.970
It's the percentage of our patient population.

40:29.110 --> 40:30.211
You're one of our patients.

40:30.311 --> 40:35.636
If enough people like you reject the standard of care, we have to fire you as a patient.

40:38.390 --> 40:39.330
This isn't a joke.

40:39.390 --> 40:40.590
This is how they're doing it.

40:40.650 --> 40:44.631
This is how they have integrated standards of care in our country.

40:45.111 --> 40:47.792
All right, so what is the main message?

40:47.852 --> 41:01.055
Isn't that the main message is we got hooked into this SIAPA standards of care, all right, so that we followed a different standard of care, FLCCC standard of care.

41:01.815 --> 41:04.175
So a lot of you probably are familiar with them.

41:04.215 --> 41:04.616
You know them.

41:04.656 --> 41:05.936
I'm not throwing them under the bus.

41:07.541 --> 41:09.822
Evil versus less evil is Satan's way.

41:10.422 --> 41:12.402
Evil, medical establishment.

41:12.543 --> 41:14.703
Less evil, other medical.

41:15.263 --> 41:19.725
So my failure as a dad was I did not trust God.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.986
I trusted another man's system.

41:23.526 --> 41:27.207
And because of trusting that other man's system, my daughter is not here.

41:27.887 --> 41:30.809
So everybody has to repent of their sin.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.770
I mean, personally, I had to repent of that sin.

41:32.810 --> 41:40.715
My daughter is not here because I trusted in a different protocol other than the government.

41:40.735 --> 41:44.017
Of course, I don't trust the government, but I trusted a different set of men.

41:44.417 --> 41:46.278
And this is how Satan works.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.940
He works in evil versus less evil dialectics.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.621
We'll cover a little bit of that today.

41:50.661 --> 41:51.802
That's not the focus.

41:55.350 --> 41:57.171
Okay, so let's find out who's behind the curtain.

41:57.191 --> 41:58.991
Of course, it's Satan who's behind the curtain.

42:01.772 --> 42:02.873
So what's going on?

42:02.953 --> 42:04.213
Why is this all going on?

42:04.273 --> 42:11.996
Well, God told us the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil, and Satan has been against God since the beginning.

42:12.216 --> 42:13.677
Satan hates us.

42:14.457 --> 42:15.258
We're the enemy.

42:15.959 --> 42:16.900
He hates us.

42:17.100 --> 42:17.401
Why?

42:17.741 --> 42:19.984
Because God made us in his image.

42:20.324 --> 42:26.032
So consequently, Satan is taking his fury out against all of us.

42:26.552 --> 42:28.294
And he has convinced

42:29.682 --> 42:33.343
every country on the planet to get a fiat currency.

42:34.083 --> 42:36.104
So there's no budgets anymore.

42:36.364 --> 42:37.644
Everybody can be paid off.

42:37.924 --> 42:39.825
Everybody can be bought under this system.

42:40.665 --> 42:50.928
And on a macro level, he's convinced the people who are running the show that there's too many people on the planet, and there's not enough resources.

42:51.228 --> 42:55.690
So then we have population control, climate control, yet

42:56.710 --> 42:57.872
because of Satan's lie.

42:58.132 --> 43:00.876
So these people have become at Satan's disposal.

43:01.236 --> 43:12.131
He uses on the evil side the occult, on the less evil side the apostate church to implement this esoteric agenda to reduce our population.

43:13.072 --> 43:14.594
And he does it with money.

43:14.914 --> 43:17.857
With a fiat currency, everybody can be bought.

43:18.637 --> 43:22.681
So you wonder, why haven't doctors spoken out?

43:22.701 --> 43:24.342
You know, there's been several doctors that have.

43:24.383 --> 43:26.184
Why haven't the majority spoken out?

43:26.244 --> 43:26.885
I mean, they know.

43:27.405 --> 43:27.605
Well,

43:28.226 --> 43:29.127
Think about the money.

43:29.688 --> 43:31.551
They lose their license if they speak out.

43:32.232 --> 43:36.979
They have million-dollar mortgages, thousand-dollar-a-month car payments, right?

43:37.219 --> 43:40.925
All of that goes away if they speak out because it's all tied in.

43:41.185 --> 43:42.667
Everybody is in on this.

43:43.628 --> 43:56.575
Our government, which I'm going to cover a little bit at the end, the things that we look at, Big Pharma, big corporations, they control our government, but our government is really just a puppet into this satanic system.

43:56.735 --> 44:02.799
Our government is implementing policy from the occultist and the apostate church.

44:03.559 --> 44:12.283
So when we talk about voting, which we'll talk about at the end, mainly because there's supposedly some important vote on Tuesday, we got to cover it, of course.

44:12.863 --> 44:19.946
In my research, I found this was the first public document that talked about depopulation in the United States.

44:20.226 --> 44:21.907
Cindy and I went to kindergarten in 68.

44:23.740 --> 44:35.366
And I was digging into the weekly readers in 68 because I had a vivid memory that one of the 1968 weekly readers said, if you have more than two children, it's irresponsible.

44:35.526 --> 44:42.849
And if your parents had an electric can opener, that was irresponsible because it's using resources of the planet that we don't have.

44:42.909 --> 44:46.591
So as I was digging, I stumbled across this plan to depopulate from 67.

44:47.431 --> 44:49.973
Of course, the Rockefellers were behind that.

44:50.533 --> 44:51.373
So how did we get here?

44:51.413 --> 44:52.494
What's the legal authority?

44:53.820 --> 44:54.941
It was quite a process.

44:55.521 --> 45:00.285
I have become convinced that the law of entropy did not exist until the sin in the garden.

45:00.705 --> 45:06.970
Because the law of entropy says we go from freedom to control, from order to chaos.

45:07.030 --> 45:10.033
And God is a God of freedom, God is a God of order.

45:10.493 --> 45:16.318
And so now we have disorder and we have control, which means the law of entropy took over.

45:17.639 --> 45:18.119
I have...

45:20.251 --> 45:23.156
solidly come to believe that we are in a spiritual battle.

45:23.637 --> 45:27.102
Unless you see this as spiritual, what I'm talking about doesn't make sense.

45:28.104 --> 45:31.549
In a spiritual battle, there's tools that we can use.

45:32.551 --> 45:33.612
Our weapons of war

45:35.251 --> 45:36.752
we put on the full armor of God.

45:36.812 --> 45:43.698
The one that I want to talk about today is that Satan is bound by the principle in Genesis 18-17.

45:44.118 --> 45:46.039
I've come to believe that in studying that.

45:46.059 --> 45:50.683
So in Genesis 18, this is when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

45:51.804 --> 45:56.987
And God said to Abraham, shall I withhold from Abraham what I am about to do?

45:58.137 --> 46:00.718
So as I look at that, I see it as a principle.

46:01.058 --> 46:03.898
God lets his people know what he's going to do before he does it.

46:04.298 --> 46:05.158
Well, so does Satan.

46:06.399 --> 46:11.380
And God tells us in Hosea 4.6, my people perish for lack of knowledge.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.380
So what knowledge is he talking about?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.640
The knowledge that everybody's chasing right now?

46:15.820 --> 46:16.881
No, not that knowledge.

46:17.241 --> 46:21.241
He's talking about knowledge of him and knowledge of how Satan works.

46:21.281 --> 46:23.142
And we're going to spend some time on that today.

46:24.042 --> 46:28.807
I want to show you how Satan has got our tacit approval through a process.

46:29.027 --> 46:31.009
So I just hit some high points on the screen.

46:31.529 --> 46:36.414
So the first thing that he did was got our tacit approval through the Hippocratic Oath.

46:36.874 --> 46:39.957
The Hippocratic Oath was written in 400 BC.

46:40.858 --> 46:46.063
So the question I have for everybody, raise your hand if you think that we should hold doctors to their oath.

46:48.464 --> 46:50.045
Okay, yep, everybody says that.

46:50.345 --> 46:51.787
All right, so we got unanimous vote.

46:52.207 --> 46:53.328
Hold doctors to their oath.

46:53.948 --> 47:07.799
This is what God is telling us why we have to not perish for lack of knowledge, because we've been programmed to believe the Hippocratic oath is first, do no harm, right?

47:08.059 --> 47:09.100
That's what we all believe.

47:09.835 --> 47:10.796
Why do we believe that?

47:11.336 --> 47:13.177
Until you know the why, you know nothing.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.339
So you, well, somebody told me that.

47:15.579 --> 47:17.360
That's what I learned in school, okay?

47:17.881 --> 47:18.761
But it's not true.

47:19.042 --> 47:22.984
The Hippocratic Oath, if you read it, I did a two-part podcast on this.

47:23.064 --> 47:27.748
The Hippocratic Oath, the first paragraph is to four satanic gods.

47:29.056 --> 47:30.537
So you wonder why we're in trouble.

47:30.577 --> 47:34.400
The doctors are swearing an oath to four satanic gods.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.482
So that's the first step in this process.

47:37.842 --> 47:39.203
So there's a whole bunch of them.

47:39.243 --> 47:40.404
I just hit the high points here.

47:40.424 --> 47:42.986
Of course, we have the whole vaccine agenda.

47:43.446 --> 47:44.387
So that followed.

47:45.167 --> 47:50.069
we have a virus vaccine, virus vaccine, all the way back to the 1880s.

47:50.409 --> 47:56.511
So now people are hooked on every time a new virus comes on the scene, we gotta have a vaccine, right?

47:56.611 --> 47:59.412
God doesn't protect us, we gotta have man protect us.

47:59.752 --> 48:01.973
So the whole vaccine psyop is there.

48:02.313 --> 48:03.973
That started already in the 1880s.

48:04.754 --> 48:06.534
Grace was super high functioning.

48:06.734 --> 48:08.635
I believe God made her that way, of course.

48:09.755 --> 48:11.456
She was never vaccinated with anything.

48:12.176 --> 48:14.538
And then Cindy nailed homeschooling.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.200
Cindy did a great job of homeschooling.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.141
I just did the dad thing, so we had fun.

48:18.181 --> 48:25.148
But she's the one who was responsible for violin, public speaking, all those things that she told you about.

48:26.249 --> 48:27.950
Jacobson versus Massachusetts.

48:28.010 --> 48:30.693
This is important enough I want to read from this court decision.

48:32.414 --> 48:33.935
This is how they pulled COVID off.

48:35.113 --> 48:38.535
You think COVID, well, they did these pre-planting exercises, right?

48:38.575 --> 48:40.277
That's what we're, yeah, of course they did those.

48:40.617 --> 48:52.925
But that was part of the PSYOP for us to find that, that they did this so that we believe they did the, okay, well, Jacobson versus Massachusetts is the first stake in the ground that I found relative to COVID.

48:53.405 --> 48:54.526
So this pastor,

48:56.375 --> 48:57.656
His last name was Jacobson.

48:57.676 --> 48:59.497
He didn't want to take the smallpox vaccine.

49:00.017 --> 49:02.178
His case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

49:02.378 --> 49:06.700
And the Supreme Court decided 7-2 in favor of the state of Massachusetts.

49:07.400 --> 49:12.162
And one of the justices wrote, and I'm going to quote this so you understand where I'm coming from.

49:12.543 --> 49:21.787
In every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members, the rights of the individual in respect to his liberty may at times

49:22.387 --> 49:33.179
under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint to be enforced by reasonable regulations as the safety of the general public may demand."

49:34.120 --> 49:36.283
So when you hear that, it seems okay, right?

49:37.144 --> 49:38.545
It seems a reasonable thing.

49:38.565 --> 49:40.788
You know, we've got to look out for our society.

49:40.808 --> 49:43.531
All right, well, what if they're lying to us?

49:45.046 --> 49:46.867
Okay, that becomes the problem.

49:46.907 --> 49:53.189
So this is a utilitarian concept, and the common name today is collectivism.

49:53.549 --> 49:57.690
So collectivism says we need to worry about the good of society versus the good of the individual.

49:58.070 --> 50:01.611
Well, newsflash, God does not believe in collectivism.

50:02.091 --> 50:04.812
God believes in individualism, all right?

50:05.032 --> 50:07.253
But this is how they do it.

50:07.873 --> 50:11.196
It sounds good, that language sounds right, right?

50:11.236 --> 50:15.160
When you read it, it just sounds reasonable and right, but it's not right.

50:15.240 --> 50:20.685
We have to go, we have to always go to our roots in scripture if we're gonna prove right or wrong.

50:20.725 --> 50:22.106
It's the only way through this.

50:24.420 --> 50:28.384
The Flexner Report in 1910, I'm going to cover that with a short video here in a minute.

50:28.464 --> 50:32.247
Medicare, Medicaid in 1965, passed by President Johnson July 30, 1965.

50:32.388 --> 50:34.510
I'm going to cover that.

50:34.650 --> 50:38.273
And standards of care, I'm going to cover that a little bit more than I already have.

50:39.274 --> 50:42.197
OK, we already talked about an oath, first do no harm.

50:42.777 --> 50:47.382
All right, we're going to play this clip regarding the Flexner Report next.

50:49.918 --> 50:52.639
Around the same time that John D. Rockefeller seized U.S.

50:52.679 --> 50:54.520
media, he also hijacked U.S.

50:54.560 --> 50:54.921
medicine.

50:56.101 --> 51:04.185
When it was discovered that drugs could be produced from petroleum, America's top oil mogul ordered his army of propagandists to invert reality accordingly.

51:05.066 --> 51:16.552
Medicines used for thousands of years were suddenly classified as alternative, while the new petroleum-based, highly addictive, and patentable drugs were declared the gold standard.

51:17.665 --> 51:30.656
After buying the German pharmaceutical company that manufactured chemicals of war for Adolf Hitler, Rockefeller leveraged his political influence by pressing Congress to declare natural healing modalities unscientific quackery.

51:31.998 --> 51:41.566
Rockefeller then took control of the American Medical Association and began offering massive grants to top medical schools under the mandate that only his approved curriculum be taught.

51:45.040 --> 51:50.047
Any mention of the healing powers of herbs, plants, and diet was erased from most medical textbooks.

51:50.768 --> 51:59.279
Doctors and professors who objected to Rockefeller's plan were crucified by the media, removed from the AMA, and stripped of their license to teach and practice medicine.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.644
Those who dared to speak out were arrested and jailed.

52:05.663 --> 52:14.807
When evidence began to emerge that petroleum-based medicines were causing cancer, Mr. Rockefeller founded the American Cancer Society, through which he suppressed that information.

52:17.408 --> 52:26.452
John D. Rockefeller is duly credited as the founder of the pharmaceutical industry, and the reason that medical error is currently the third leading cause of death in America.

52:27.852 --> 52:29.493
This is not an indictment against doctors.

52:30.133 --> 52:34.595
More than anyone, they are under the stranglehold of the single largest lobbying power in Washington.

52:35.518 --> 52:43.061
Every year, the pharmaceutical industry spends at least twice the amount as Big Oil to influence laws, policies, and public perception.

52:44.902 --> 52:51.745
Thanks to Mr. Rockefeller, the architect of American monopolies, no industry has more power over our lives than Big Pharma.

52:54.606 --> 52:57.027
So I, is this okay?

52:57.567 --> 52:58.608
It's got back feed?

52:59.448 --> 53:01.529
Good, all right, I'll let you know before I do the next one.

53:03.314 --> 53:09.878
The one point I have of disagreement there is the narrator said this is not an indictment against doctors.

53:10.538 --> 53:11.099
You heard that.

53:11.619 --> 53:14.901
So I disagree with that, of course, because there's multiple players.

53:14.921 --> 53:21.064
So we have the United States government that has the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services controlling standards of care.

53:21.385 --> 53:23.266
We have the hospitals accepting the money.

53:24.346 --> 53:28.349
So if you look at this as we have the manufacturer of the gun

53:29.966 --> 53:31.147
the United States government.

53:31.847 --> 53:34.889
Somebody had to load the gun with the bullets.

53:34.929 --> 53:35.770
That's the hospital.

53:36.170 --> 53:37.391
And somebody had to pull the trigger.

53:37.431 --> 53:38.192
That's the doctor.

53:38.212 --> 53:40.093
So it is an indictment against the doctors.

53:40.133 --> 53:48.038
In our lawsuit, we took the extraordinary step of not just suing the hospital, but we sued six doctors and two nurses.

53:48.458 --> 53:50.260
It makes for a very expensive lawsuit.

53:50.300 --> 53:51.701
But if we're going to make a difference,

53:52.321 --> 53:54.462
We have to have people be accountable.

53:54.862 --> 53:57.302
A hospital or big pharma is never going to be accountable.

53:57.802 --> 54:04.484
Pfizer had a $2.1 billion penalty for prior sins.

54:04.724 --> 54:06.245
And what did they do?

54:06.285 --> 54:08.105
I mean, they implemented the jab.

54:08.465 --> 54:10.106
So I mean, they needed to go out of business.

54:10.146 --> 54:11.526
That's a consequence for choice.

54:14.127 --> 54:15.468
All right, Satan is a legalist.

54:15.828 --> 54:20.232
Remember, we're in this idea of we're tacitly approving what he has done.

54:20.252 --> 54:23.154
All right, so Satan is the ultimate legalist.

54:23.815 --> 54:30.961
And when you start peeling back some layers, the National Vaccine Injury and Safety Act was passed November 15th of 1986.

54:31.481 --> 54:36.946
That's, by guess, the president that all of us thought was the greatest president in our lifetime.

54:37.266 --> 54:38.927
Ronald Reagan passed that law.

54:39.628 --> 54:41.590
So they're all in on this.

54:41.890 --> 54:43.191
Every one of them is in on it.

54:44.072 --> 54:45.433
We want to blame Obamacare.

54:45.493 --> 54:48.055
There's plenty of reason to blame Obamacare.

54:48.115 --> 54:54.219
Section 1553, which I have on the screen, legalized euthanasia.

54:54.660 --> 54:57.922
So our country projects its sin onto the rest of the planet.

54:58.363 --> 55:03.567
If you look at how we, say, these naughty Canadians with the medical assistance and dying program,

55:04.167 --> 55:04.347
Right?

55:04.887 --> 55:07.328
So we look at them.

55:07.908 --> 55:08.608
These guys are bad.

55:08.848 --> 55:11.109
We invented medical assistance in dying.

55:11.389 --> 55:12.289
It's in Obamacare.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.170
It's right there, section 1553.

55:14.530 --> 55:18.031
So we have tacitly approved all of this in plain sight.

55:18.431 --> 55:20.292
Medicare, Medicaid, medical insurance.

55:20.332 --> 55:21.892
How many of you still have medical insurance?

55:22.292 --> 55:23.292
We don't anymore.

55:23.593 --> 55:23.833
Why?

55:24.053 --> 55:27.554
Because medical insurance is in bed with Center for Medicare

55:29.154 --> 55:31.255
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

55:31.636 --> 55:31.916
Why?

55:31.976 --> 55:38.200
Because Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services can't write the standards of care directly.

55:38.320 --> 55:40.321
They have to always do it through a proxy.

55:40.361 --> 55:42.062
The proxy is medical insurance.

55:42.442 --> 55:43.823
That's how they're pulling it off.

55:46.805 --> 55:48.326
Laws taking away our rights.

55:48.406 --> 55:49.947
The American with Disabilities Act.

55:49.987 --> 55:58.092
This is really a fantastic one because when we filed our lawsuit, we really expected we were going to have a disability rights claim.

55:59.253 --> 56:00.694
Grace was without advocacy.

56:00.754 --> 56:02.075
Grace was strapped to the bed.

56:02.336 --> 56:04.417
Those are disability right violations, right?

56:04.918 --> 56:06.459
So the legal team researched.

56:06.559 --> 56:07.139
Guess what?

56:07.760 --> 56:10.402
Grace's rights evaporated upon death.

56:11.043 --> 56:19.669
So in order to have her rights enforced in that hospital setting, we would have had to have an attorney on retainer

56:20.430 --> 56:21.951
for the hospital situation.

56:22.011 --> 56:29.277
So the ADA law is just a smoke and mirrors to get us to believe our government is on our side trying to help.

56:34.061 --> 56:45.629
The standard of care model, I believe, is the programming that the medical industrial establishment needed to be able to pull this off.

56:45.970 --> 56:49.913
This example that's on the screen should rock you to the core.

56:50.653 --> 56:54.178
Our daughter Jessica found this on Facebook a couple of months ago.

56:54.639 --> 56:58.624
This is a labor and delivery nurse who posted this comment on Facebook.

56:59.125 --> 57:02.889
She was so proud of it, she not just put her name, she also put her picture.

57:03.330 --> 57:04.291
And this is what she wrote.

57:04.351 --> 57:08.256
She said, as a labor and delivery nurse, it was up to me to inject the newborn.

57:08.857 --> 57:13.141
Even back then, over 30 years ago, we had patients that would refuse.

57:13.601 --> 57:21.027
I know that it was their right as parents to refuse, but as not only a nurse but a mother, I could not send a baby home defenseless.

57:21.448 --> 57:31.256
I know what I did was not right, but I would inform the parents I was taking the baby to weigh him or her on a more precise scale and then take them to the nursery and inject them.

57:31.716 --> 57:32.617
Just had to do it.

57:33.057 --> 57:37.701
No baby was going to bleed out on my watch in spite of the parents' stupidness.

57:44.807 --> 57:48.848
Medicare and Medicaid set up the collectivism lie that we're experiencing today.

57:48.888 --> 57:52.789
So remember collectivism from the Jacobson versus Massachusetts decision.

57:53.189 --> 57:57.690
So now collectivism with Medicare and Medicaid, these numbers will shock you.

57:58.871 --> 58:02.271
We have 135 million Americans on Medicare and Medicaid.

58:02.672 --> 58:03.852
This is all by design.

58:05.424 --> 58:08.225
because people are too expensive, we've gotta balance the budget.

58:08.565 --> 58:17.787
Look at, if you just search news headlines for bankrupt Medicare, bankrupt Social Security, you'll see three, four times a year they float this.

58:17.807 --> 58:20.388
Social Security's gonna go bankrupt, Medicare's gonna go bankrupt.

58:21.008 --> 58:25.029
That's all to get us to participate in our own demise.

58:25.129 --> 58:26.629
No, we can't, we paid into that.

58:27.209 --> 58:32.631
We're participating in our own demise by fighting, they're stopping those programs.

58:33.311 --> 58:41.737
Those programs are designed to hasten our death because they've convinced us, well, now we got 135 million Americans on these programs.

58:41.757 --> 58:43.438
It's almost $5 trillion a year.

58:43.698 --> 58:46.380
It's over 50% of the annual federal budget.

58:46.420 --> 58:47.440
We got to balance our budget.

58:47.761 --> 58:51.543
These guys have never balanced a budget since we've had a fiat currency.

58:52.064 --> 58:54.025
There's no intention of balancing a budget.

58:54.105 --> 58:57.067
It is all by design to hasten death.

58:57.487 --> 59:01.670
The whole Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is designed to hasten death.

59:01.690 --> 59:02.771
I have another clip.

59:03.391 --> 59:07.033
So just so you know, my degree is DAD, by the way.

59:07.173 --> 59:10.174
I don't know anything, but I have become a researcher, as you can tell.

59:10.754 --> 59:11.715
I'm not a doctor.

59:11.735 --> 59:12.775
I don't know anything.

59:12.815 --> 59:16.197
I just have decided I've got to see this stuff with my own eyes.

59:16.917 --> 59:18.658
This next clip is...

59:19.998 --> 59:23.579
Greg Kelly interviewing Seema Verma.

59:23.719 --> 59:25.240
She's the head of CMS.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.161
She's going to tell you what I just told you.

59:28.661 --> 59:29.821
This is what Satan does.

59:29.861 --> 59:31.422
Remember the principle of Genesis 18, 17.

59:32.522 --> 59:34.883
Satan has to let us know what he's going to do before he does it.

59:34.923 --> 59:37.163
So this is being paraded right in front of us.

59:37.524 --> 59:40.084
Now she's talking about nursing homes, but you'll get the idea.

59:40.104 --> 59:41.565
All right, here we go, Jay.

59:42.748 --> 59:49.433
How many nursing homes are under federal care, or does the federal government own?

59:49.713 --> 59:50.294
Are there any?

59:50.674 --> 59:55.057
I know they're state and they're private, but does the federal government have direct control?

59:55.457 --> 59:57.319
Are there any federal nursing home facilities?

59:59.309 --> 01:00:14.635
Well, the VA has some nursing homes, but in terms of my agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we set the federal guidelines of safety and quality, and then we work with the states to inspect these nursing homes to make sure they're adhering to those guidelines.

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:17.156
But ultimately, states license these facilities.

01:00:17.796 --> 01:00:24.699
What the federal government can do if a nursing home isn't compliant is we can withhold their reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid.

01:00:27.677 --> 01:00:28.878
So you see what they're doing.

01:00:28.898 --> 01:00:32.519
Remember, they can't do it directly, but they cut them off with the money.

01:00:32.539 --> 01:00:35.301
It's the fiat currency everybody's bought.

01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:46.006
So this is how the government illegally, through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, controls the medical industrial complex for the entire country.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.267
That's the smoking gun right there.

01:00:52.604 --> 01:00:56.685
The use of propaganda, you really can't do a presentation without commenting on this.

01:00:57.746 --> 01:00:59.646
We've had propaganda our whole life.

01:01:00.066 --> 01:01:09.289
But amazingly, the Smith-Montag was passed in 1948 that says the US government can only use propaganda against the rest of the world, not against their own country.

01:01:09.729 --> 01:01:12.370
Well, what did they do with JFK's assassination?

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.590
But we can just ignore that.

01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:15.491
What about 9-11?

01:01:16.391 --> 01:01:17.631
We'll just ignore that right now.

01:01:17.671 --> 01:01:18.272
But in 2012,

01:01:19.932 --> 01:01:25.838
They officially said, no, well, we can use propaganda against our own citizens.

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:30.702
So during COVID, we heard hundreds of thousands of times, safe and effective.

01:01:31.707 --> 01:01:32.487
Complete lie.

01:01:32.768 --> 01:01:42.613
The Brooke Jackson case had already come out exposing Pfizer that they had never done any testing, that this was a bioweapon with a contract with the Department of Defense.

01:01:42.913 --> 01:01:44.914
They kept saying safe and effective.

01:01:45.174 --> 01:01:47.595
No one will ever get held accountable for that lie.

01:01:48.135 --> 01:01:48.396
Why?

01:01:48.656 --> 01:01:49.836
Because it was legal.

01:01:49.856 --> 01:01:51.397
Remember, Satan's a legalist.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:52.898
I'm not talking about lawful here.

01:01:53.778 --> 01:01:54.939
I'm just saying it was legal.

01:01:54.999 --> 01:01:56.640
They legalized this whole thing.

01:01:59.922 --> 01:02:04.606
Vera Sharov has become a friend of ours, a real blessing.

01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:14.333
And I call her, when you're in a setting like this, God gave me the ability to compartmentalize the story.

01:02:14.373 --> 01:02:16.895
But not every day is a positive day.

01:02:16.935 --> 01:02:18.976
You can imagine when your best buddy isn't here.

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.599
So I call Vera usually about once a month.

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:25.341
And she's been, I've only been in this fight three years.

01:02:25.401 --> 01:02:26.382
She's been in it over 30 years.

01:02:27.322 --> 01:02:30.003
And her spirit, she's, I think, 88 years old now.

01:02:30.443 --> 01:02:33.243
She just seems to be always positive.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:35.063
So she always gives me these one-liners.

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:39.324
So I have a couple of one-liners she gave me, three of them on three separate phone calls.

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:42.925
So in one of the calls, she said, Scott, virology is the centerfold.

01:02:43.265 --> 01:02:45.905
She always uses these R-rated words.

01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:47.086
It's really fun to talk with her.

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:52.607
Virology is the centerfold of medicine because of the profit and fear associated with viruses.

01:02:52.747 --> 01:02:53.427
Makes sense, right?

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:58.211
They are looking at blades of grass, but they don't want to kill the root.

01:02:58.711 --> 01:03:02.855
And the root here is, Satan is the ultimate root.

01:03:02.955 --> 01:03:03.755
He's the enemy.

01:03:04.276 --> 01:03:10.161
But the root that she was talking about is obviously the whole virology vaccine agenda.

01:03:10.581 --> 01:03:15.366
And then last she wrote, the Holocaust could not have happened if they didn't get the doctors to cooperate.

01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:17.748
And this is how her and I became friends.

01:03:17.788 --> 01:03:20.831
I was researching the Holocaust and saw the parallels.

01:03:22.152 --> 01:03:27.958
And she has become very outspoken that this is a worldwide Holocaust today, which it clearly is.

01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:37.948
Who's keeping tab of this?

01:03:38.669 --> 01:03:39.510
I'll be covering that dear.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:45.291
Okay, so how do they get the doctors and the facilities to kill?

01:03:45.431 --> 01:03:46.612
How is it even possible?

01:03:46.652 --> 01:03:47.293
How do they do it?

01:03:47.653 --> 01:03:49.314
It can't just be pay, right?

01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:51.976
So how many of you would kill somebody for pay?

01:03:52.477 --> 01:03:57.381
Although, interestingly, if you've looked at history, the Milgram Obedience Experiment,

01:03:58.536 --> 01:04:00.857
was done in 1963, 61 years ago.

01:04:01.378 --> 01:04:07.121
And in the Milgram Obedience Experiment, two-thirds of the participants would have killed somebody.

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:10.343
It was just an experiment, just by giving an order.

01:04:11.004 --> 01:04:15.727
Hannah Arendt did the research that led up to the Milgram Obedience Experiment.

01:04:15.947 --> 01:04:20.950
And what she determined was that there was a banality of evil.

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.671
Banality means commonplace.

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:25.413
Evil is so common, we didn't recognize it anymore.

01:04:26.173 --> 01:04:30.677
And I'm just gonna go through the first one, the disabled abortion culture.

01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:36.662
In America, 90% of Down syndrome babies are murdered in the womb.

01:04:36.682 --> 01:04:39.585
Okay, so that should shock anybody.

01:04:41.006 --> 01:04:42.207
So how does that happen?

01:04:42.227 --> 01:04:43.508
This is the banality of evil.

01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:45.530
So I'll walk you through this.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:46.691
The young couple gets pregnant.

01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:54.065
They walk into the doctor's office and the doctor says, congratulations on your pregnancy.

01:04:54.306 --> 01:04:56.527
Let's schedule your amniocentesis.

01:04:58.248 --> 01:04:58.949
So why?

01:04:59.449 --> 01:05:00.550
That's the standard of care.

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:05.274
So then the couple simply says, does my insurance cover it?

01:05:06.223 --> 01:05:07.484
Yeah, your insurance covers it.

01:05:07.724 --> 01:05:11.785
The doctor doesn't tell them that they cover it because they're in on it.

01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:16.027
But of course their insurance covers it, because the insurance company is in on it.

01:05:16.427 --> 01:05:18.128
So now the couple gets the testing.

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:21.509
They have the meeting to go through the results of the test.

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:27.492
And the doctor says, we suspect your son is going to have Down syndrome.

01:05:27.652 --> 01:05:29.113
I recommend an abortion.

01:05:30.553 --> 01:05:32.114
And why do I recommend an abortion?

01:05:32.134 --> 01:05:34.315
I'm going to show you why he recommends that in a minute.

01:05:35.423 --> 01:05:39.664
But ultimately he believes in the spirit of collectivism.

01:05:39.844 --> 01:05:42.285
These people are going to be a burden on society.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.406
They're going to be a burden on you chasing the American dream.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:56.589
And so he convinces them, and if they don't have biblical roots, you know, why would I want to complicate my life with all these complications that Down syndrome brings into the equation?

01:05:57.967 --> 01:06:00.028
So this is the type of things that he tells them.

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:04.889
So remember Obamacare, I mentioned that before, Obamacare was passed on March 23rd of 2010.

01:06:05.189 --> 01:06:14.091
In July of 2011, this is a document, a training document that was written to implement Obamacare with the medical profession.

01:06:14.491 --> 01:06:21.433
And this happens to be a training document, this was written by two MDs, and it's a training document for how do you treat adults with Down syndrome.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.952
So this is the type of things that they tell them.

01:06:25.073 --> 01:06:29.138
So the first thing that they do is say, these people are going to have all kinds of problems.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:40.551
And so you'll see on the list, they say, well, they're going to have sleep apnea, dental issues, congenital cardiac septal defects, thyroid dysfunction, 50 different things, all these problems.

01:06:41.492 --> 01:06:45.776
Grace was the best thing that God ever gave us, second to salvation, by far.

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:49.218
There's not even a close third place.

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.340
That's what a gift she was.

01:06:51.961 --> 01:06:56.264
All these problems, they're nothing compared to what she brought to the table.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:59.106
But this is what the doctor's laying in front of the couple.

01:06:59.187 --> 01:07:00.267
This is what you can expect.

01:07:00.848 --> 01:07:02.970
So then the attitude that they're

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:07.211
they're training these doctors to have is that they're the savior.

01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:12.292
So if you look at the second highlighted piece, it says, the lifelong toll on families is high.

01:07:13.012 --> 01:07:17.693
Part of a robust plan of care includes acknowledgement of this toll by health care workers.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:22.555
So their mindset is, hey, these families, this is a burden to these families.

01:07:22.575 --> 01:07:28.156
So if you get a Down syndrome person as a patient, recognize they don't want this kid.

01:07:28.476 --> 01:07:29.916
They want this kid gone.

01:07:29.956 --> 01:07:30.597
They're a burden.

01:07:31.237 --> 01:07:32.037
This is right in print.

01:07:32.717 --> 01:07:34.578
Then third is the kill statement.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:42.602
Whenever possible, decision makers for people with Down syndrome should be encouraged to use substituted judgment to make key palliative care decisions.

01:07:43.043 --> 01:07:46.765
Substituted judgment is their judgment, not the patient's judgment.

01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:49.726
All efforts should be made to determine the preferences of the patient.

01:07:50.106 --> 01:07:56.510
However, because of lifelong cognitive impairment, the views of the person with Down syndrome may not be known.

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.811
Well, hello.

01:07:57.831 --> 01:08:01.193
I mean, I know the view of every single person with Down syndrome.

01:08:01.213 --> 01:08:02.114
So does each one of you.

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:04.195
They want to live no different than us.

01:08:06.097 --> 01:08:07.698
So they're making themselves gods.

01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:12.793
I told you I wanted to share how God warned us of this ahead of time.

01:08:14.354 --> 01:08:19.057
In Revelation 18, 23, he said, for your merchants were the most important people of the earth.

01:08:19.157 --> 01:08:21.158
He's talking about Mystery Babylon here.

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:24.400
There's many different views of this.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.641
I'm not trying to be right here.

01:08:26.922 --> 01:08:32.925
But I believe that in the physical sense, the United States has become Mystery Babylon.

01:08:33.686 --> 01:08:38.489
And so he says, for your merchants were the most important people of the earth, because with their pharmakia,

01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:40.729
They deceived all nations.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:48.771
And when I look at, we write 4.8 billion prescriptions a year in the United States.

01:08:49.811 --> 01:08:55.433
Out of the entire world, the United States consumes 44% of the world's prescriptions.

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:59.794
We are hooked on pharmacy, pharmaceuticals.

01:09:00.134 --> 01:09:01.354
We're hooked on it.

01:09:01.954 --> 01:09:04.815
If we can get a pill versus doing the work, we want it.

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:06.375
All right.

01:09:07.616 --> 01:09:08.896
Wrapping up, how do we prepare?

01:09:12.217 --> 01:09:17.742
Early in my Christian walk, I listened to a pastor who influenced me quite a bit.

01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:18.843
His name was Chuck Missler.

01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:21.766
And he said, there's two mistakes that you can make.

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.428
Number one is failure to prepare.

01:09:25.409 --> 01:09:27.811
And number two is relying on your preparations.

01:09:28.132 --> 01:09:30.294
We rely on the finished work of Jesus Christ.

01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:34.578
So preparing, obviously the physical,

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.271
If you, I get asked in just about every interview, what's the most important thing that somebody could do to prepare for a hospital stay?

01:09:43.852 --> 01:09:44.713
And it's pretty easy.

01:09:45.534 --> 01:09:49.100
The most important thing you could do to prepare for a hospital stay is change your belief.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:53.633
If you believe a hospital is there to help you, you won't be prepared.

01:09:54.054 --> 01:09:58.879
If you believe that they are following government protocols to kill you, you will be prepared.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.183
And so that looks like taking an advocate with you.

01:10:02.743 --> 01:10:05.726
It looks like not signing any papers without reading them.

01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:07.989
It looks like having a power of attorney document.

01:10:08.009 --> 01:10:10.171
It looks like having a medical directives document.

01:10:10.271 --> 01:10:11.532
All stuff that you can do to prepare.

01:10:12.813 --> 01:10:14.574
But none of that is going to save your life.

01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:17.695
You have to have an advocate with you in the hospital setting.

01:10:17.816 --> 01:10:19.556
It's absolutely essential.

01:10:20.337 --> 01:10:22.818
The spiritual part is substantially more important.

01:10:23.638 --> 01:10:27.940
The spiritual preparation requires us to look outside of the world's programming.

01:10:29.178 --> 01:10:34.361
So the world's programming today, all of us in this room have heard about the great reset.

01:10:34.862 --> 01:10:35.942
That's the evil side.

01:10:36.343 --> 01:10:39.344
The great awakening, newsflash, is the less evil side.

01:10:40.105 --> 01:10:42.727
And I can prove it in one sentence.

01:10:43.815 --> 01:10:49.817
Every single person promoting the Great Awakening is missing one word, and that's repentance.

01:10:50.398 --> 01:10:52.818
We got here by rejecting God.

01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:55.579
We tacitly approved Satan's plan.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:04.743
So without repentance, the person that is promoting any solution that follows this Great Awakening, PSYOP, is lying to you.

01:11:05.063 --> 01:11:06.924
They are working for Team Satan.

01:11:06.944 --> 01:11:10.005
They're on the less evil side of the dialectic.

01:11:14.778 --> 01:11:15.419
So what do we do?

01:11:16.582 --> 01:11:18.525
So should we do legislation?

01:11:18.906 --> 01:11:21.110
I've been approached, hey, let's have Grace's Law.

01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:24.657
Let's have Grace's Law so that we can stop these illegal DNRs.

01:11:25.398 --> 01:11:25.979
Well, what do you think?

01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:31.027
Well, we've never been able to legislate morality since the beginning.

01:11:32.028 --> 01:11:37.030
Our society is at an all-time low with morality, so are we going to have to pass more legislation?

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.470
No, that would be chasing the wind.

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:40.491
How about a new administration?

01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:45.313
I'm going to cover that here in just a little bit, mainly because I can.

01:11:45.613 --> 01:11:47.634
But God warned us in 1 Samuel 8,

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:51.253
What did the people want?

01:11:51.313 --> 01:11:52.213
They wanted a king.

01:11:52.794 --> 01:11:59.575
So the prophet Samuel went to God directly and said, hey, these dummies that I'm in charge of, they want a king.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:03.655
And God tells them, hey, just let them know the king's going to take your land.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:04.556
He's going to take your daughter.

01:12:04.576 --> 01:12:05.376
He's going to take your son.

01:12:05.796 --> 01:12:07.036
Just warn them so they know.

01:12:07.176 --> 01:12:09.136
So he warns them, nope, we still want a king.

01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:11.457
So then God says, OK, give them what they want.

01:12:11.637 --> 01:12:12.577
That's God's character.

01:12:12.597 --> 01:12:13.877
You won't go against their free will.

01:12:14.437 --> 01:12:17.998
But let them know, don't come crying to me when it doesn't work out.

01:12:19.093 --> 01:12:23.855
So that's the DAD version of the Bible, not the NIV or the King James.

01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:26.075
But I mean, that's the long and short of that story.

01:12:26.536 --> 01:12:28.736
So that's the same thing we're after today.

01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:33.178
The people who are on the Trump wagon have lost their mind.

01:12:33.258 --> 01:12:34.158
They want a king.

01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:36.139
Of course, I'm not promoting Harris.

01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:36.839
That's not the point.

01:12:37.359 --> 01:12:39.680
But I'm promoting getting out of the system.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.621
This system is the system that killed us.

01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:43.442
What about the courts?

01:12:43.462 --> 01:12:47.003
I mean, everybody here knows, because I mentioned it already, that we have a lawsuit.

01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:50.325
We don't have a lawsuit because I believe in a court system.

01:12:50.926 --> 01:12:57.071
We promise God when we jumped into this fight that whatever door you open, we will walk through.

01:12:57.772 --> 01:12:59.733
And that door open, we're walking through it.

01:12:59.753 --> 01:13:02.295
This is the dumbest thing I've ever done, having a lawsuit.

01:13:03.657 --> 01:13:06.019
The cost of the lawsuit itself is stupid.

01:13:06.079 --> 01:13:10.122
The most we can win, and we've already said if we win anything, we're not even taking the money.

01:13:10.182 --> 01:13:11.043
The most we can win is 750,000.

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:12.604
The cost of the lawsuit is estimated at 800,000.

01:13:16.187 --> 01:13:17.789
So just wrap, it's so stupid.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:25.560
But we're doing this because we have an opportunity to get on platforms we could never be on and share the gospel message.

01:13:25.821 --> 01:13:27.263
And that's what we're being called to do.

01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:36.403
So all these things fit into the red pill category on the left, and you're going to see I have a video at the end, take the white pill.

01:13:36.423 --> 01:13:38.025
This is not a pharmaceutical pill.

01:13:38.405 --> 01:13:41.489
The white pill is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and you'll see that at the end.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:46.714
Satan's programming is being played out in real time, and I re-reference this, Genesis 18-17.

01:13:49.929 --> 01:13:54.411
I want to give you two examples that have just happened in the last month.

01:13:55.272 --> 01:13:59.354
This one just happened last week when Trump was on Rogan.

01:14:02.024 --> 01:14:11.889
What I did on the right-hand side, so this, I'm not gonna read that, but on the right-hand side, I don't, when I hear something and I see it, I don't want to just take it at face value.

01:14:11.909 --> 01:14:18.352
I went to the transcript to see what he actually said, and what he actually said proves what Whitney Webb wrote.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:29.117
She wrote, Trump promoted national ID on Rogan, the next step to the total control grid, along with vaccines, this is what central bankers want and need to get complete control.

01:14:29.557 --> 01:14:37.680
Looks like the establishment factions have agreed that Trump is their man to lead patriots and conservatives into the digital concentration camp.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:49.045
The theory that you need a digital ID system to stop election fraud or secure the border is absolutely not true, asked the folks who ran things before digital tech existed.

01:14:49.925 --> 01:14:57.228
All right, so in my research, I concluded that Trump was behind the stolen election.

01:14:58.735 --> 01:15:00.777
So you gotta, remember, you gotta think like this guy.

01:15:01.958 --> 01:15:05.501
You gotta think levels, levels of PSYOPs, okay?

01:15:06.021 --> 01:15:08.944
So why wasn't anything done about the stolen election?

01:15:08.964 --> 01:15:09.924
That's your first clue.

01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:15.849
But if we can get people into, we gotta stop these stolen elections.

01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:19.953
Well, just in that itself, you're into the election PSYOP.

01:15:20.693 --> 01:15:22.235
Remember where governments fit.

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:23.576
Governments are way down.

01:15:25.044 --> 01:15:28.208
They're the puppet implementing policy, Satan's policy.

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:30.290
We don't even have a country.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:31.351
We have a corporation.

01:15:31.412 --> 01:15:35.536
So when we vote, assuming you vote, you're voting for a president of a corporation.

01:15:36.097 --> 01:15:38.440
So even on the face, it doesn't make sense.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.668
But if we can get digital ID out of this stolen election, that makes sense, and it fits like a glove.

01:15:49.381 --> 01:16:00.125
The tweet, I'm gonna, the quote on the top, we're gonna play the clip next, Jay, but I wanna read what Trump tweeted out on March 7th of 2024.

01:16:00.605 --> 01:16:01.925
This has never been retracted.

01:16:01.965 --> 01:16:04.646
We know that he's a bragger, but this is what he wrote.

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:07.508
The pandemic no longer controls our lives.

01:16:07.568 --> 01:16:15.131
The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer, turning setback into comeback.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:16.011
You're welcome, Joe.

01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:19.753
Nine month approval time versus 12 years that it would have taken you.

01:16:20.113 --> 01:16:22.675
So we know cancer is already skyrocketing.

01:16:22.775 --> 01:16:29.479
It's going to get substantially worse as the jab impact goes through the whole country, right?

01:16:29.879 --> 01:16:32.581
So then you see he just laid the groundwork.

01:16:32.641 --> 01:16:34.582
Satan lets us know what he's going to do ahead of time.

01:16:34.622 --> 01:16:37.644
Laid the groundwork for a cancer vaccine, right?

01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:40.806
I mean, this is what the vaccine PSYOP will do.

01:16:40.826 --> 01:16:41.887
All right, here we go.

01:16:44.249 --> 01:16:46.450
We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic.

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:54.551
We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.712
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.

01:16:57.092 --> 01:16:59.392
We made ventilators for the entire world.

01:16:59.492 --> 01:17:00.293
We got gowns.

01:17:00.373 --> 01:17:01.233
We got masks.

01:17:01.293 --> 01:17:03.213
We did things that nobody thought possible.

01:17:03.673 --> 01:17:05.994
And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.

01:17:06.034 --> 01:17:10.795
They give me credit for a lot of things, but not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic.

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.010
Yeah, that's it, that's it.

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:27.067
Cindy and I talked with a lady a couple weeks ago, and she gave me this first statement on the screen.

01:17:27.087 --> 01:17:29.848
If your vote mattered, we wouldn't be allowed to vote.

01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:31.349
I thought, wow, that was brilliant.

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:37.794
So we talked with her on the phone, and she was sharing her story, which we're not going to cover that today.

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:41.916
But it's how they capture adults through guardianship.

01:17:42.197 --> 01:17:46.820
So it's just another way to capture people to get them under government control.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.642
And she had said, if your vote mattered, we wouldn't be allowed to vote.

01:17:52.364 --> 01:17:59.730
this evil versus less evil dialectic pattern that Satan has, you know, we cannot fix evil with less evil.

01:18:00.271 --> 01:18:08.278
So in the election we have, you know, obviously Harris representing evil, Trump representing less evil, and it's not going to be fixed that way.

01:18:09.319 --> 01:18:14.504
I found this a couple weeks ago, Babylonian word magic, the word mega.

01:18:16.394 --> 01:18:18.736
So remember, they put this right out in front of us.

01:18:19.717 --> 01:18:25.923
It happens to be the highest level in the church of Satan.

01:18:25.943 --> 01:18:34.752
And if you translate the word mega in multiple languages, I happen to have it translated in Spanish here, it translates to magician and wizard.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.601
I'm gonna zoom way out here.

01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:47.664
God warned us of this dualistic nature of Satan in Revelation 13.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:54.949
This is the single most important chapter of scripture that I have come across since Grace's death.

01:18:55.029 --> 01:18:59.612
It's not my favorite chapter, but it is how God warned us ahead of time.

01:18:59.672 --> 01:19:02.434
So esoterically, Satan has two sides.

01:19:02.554 --> 01:19:05.116
I've said it multiple times today, evil versus less evil.

01:19:05.716 --> 01:19:12.344
Revelation 13 lays out the esoteric sides, the antichrist system, the false prophet system.

01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:14.506
They're constantly playing each other.

01:19:14.946 --> 01:19:25.858
In fact, in the video that we have at the end, you'll see the title is, The Plan to Take Down the Satanic Cabal was written by the satanic cabal.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.302
And Revelation 13 says that.

01:19:30.343 --> 01:19:37.568
The false prophet is empowered by the Antichrist system and points back to the Antichrist system.

01:19:38.009 --> 01:19:46.956
That's why this plan to take down the satanic cabal, the Great Awakening, it was written by the satanic cabal to get us into the control grid.

01:19:47.376 --> 01:19:52.181
So you can see race to expose evil, I'm calling that the first beast, the Antichrist system.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:55.764
This was the revelation out of all the things that happened since Grace's death.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:20:01.769
The one revelation that I received was don't use Grace's death to expose evil.

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:03.531
Why?

01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:06.093
Because it fits into Satan's playbook.

01:20:07.394 --> 01:20:10.477
The race to expose evil fits into Satan's playbook.

01:20:10.637 --> 01:20:10.937
Why?

01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:11.718
Revelation 13.

01:20:13.487 --> 01:20:17.389
We have a propensity for safety, security, and comfort.

01:20:17.429 --> 01:20:18.330
That's how we're wired.

01:20:19.551 --> 01:20:24.234
The false prophets always come with safety, security, and comfort.

01:20:25.436 --> 01:20:35.503
On an esoteric level, Satan has to have the evil exposed to create chaos and the false prophet system leading us to the end.

01:20:36.223 --> 01:20:38.265
That has to be how it works.

01:20:38.285 --> 01:20:39.345
That's how we're all wired.

01:20:39.385 --> 01:20:40.446
It's our sinful nature.

01:20:40.866 --> 01:20:44.589
But esoterically means behind the scenes, that's what's happening.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:47.471
We get participating exoterically

01:20:48.447 --> 01:20:55.439
And we participate in our own demise, like the election PSYOP, like saying, hey, we can't stop Social Security, we can't stop Medicare.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:59.666
So we end up agreeing to something that is designed to kill us.

01:21:00.527 --> 01:21:01.789
That's all by design.

01:21:03.069 --> 01:21:06.832
So the great reset is on the evil side, the great awakening on the less evil.

01:21:07.312 --> 01:21:15.178
The occult implements the antichrist evil side, the apostate church, the false prophet, less evil side.

01:21:15.359 --> 01:21:22.004
And then on a personal level, we have Harris and Trump acting this out in real time.

01:21:23.854 --> 01:21:24.914
I want to go through a few.

01:21:25.895 --> 01:21:28.175
If you haven't figured out, I believe we're in the days of Noah.

01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:32.057
So I want to go through a few scriptures just to highlight that.

01:21:32.177 --> 01:21:35.258
The first one is 2 Thessalonians 2, verses 10-12.

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:38.719
They perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.

01:21:38.779 --> 01:21:40.320
For this reason, God sends them.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720
God sends them.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.301
God sends them to who?

01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.101
The Christians.

01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:46.241
This is not to the unbelievers.

01:21:46.722 --> 01:21:55.084
God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:58.625
2 Timothy 4, verses three through four.

01:21:59.026 --> 01:22:02.307
For a time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine.

01:22:02.387 --> 01:22:09.369
Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.

01:22:09.889 --> 01:22:12.310
They will turn their ears away from the truth

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:14.552
and turn aside to myths.

01:22:15.232 --> 01:22:17.835
And the apostate church is what they're turning aside to.

01:22:17.855 --> 01:22:18.376
You can hear it.

01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:23.021
I mean, these pastors are out on, big mega church pastors.

01:22:23.782 --> 01:22:26.004
The most recent one was Jack Hibbs.

01:22:26.444 --> 01:22:27.786
It's a sin to not vote.

01:22:28.006 --> 01:22:28.787
He's lying.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.048
That's a complete lie.

01:22:30.208 --> 01:22:31.330
It's a sin to not vote.

01:22:32.592 --> 01:22:42.736
Matthew 24, 24, the false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

01:22:43.156 --> 01:22:53.019
And that's what we've got to work at, is submitting to our Lord and Savior, because He promises to, this is our hope, this is what He tells us He will do, He will protect us.

01:22:55.706 --> 01:22:57.928
Should we expect Satan to come as an angel of light?

01:22:58.348 --> 01:22:59.809
I've covered all of this already.

01:23:00.269 --> 01:23:12.857
God says specifically in 2 Corinthians 11, 14, Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.

01:23:13.378 --> 01:23:15.779
All right, we're gonna play one final video.

01:23:15.819 --> 01:23:20.122
This is five minutes long, and then Cindy's gonna do a brief wrap-up when we come back.

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:21.683
Yep, I'm ready for you.

01:23:53.567 --> 01:23:55.709
Please, come, sit.

01:23:57.110 --> 01:24:02.033
I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole.

01:24:03.054 --> 01:24:03.274
Hmm?

01:24:04.815 --> 01:24:06.196
I can see it in your eyes.

01:24:07.057 --> 01:24:11.500
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up.

01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:15.743
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

01:24:17.424 --> 01:24:19.005
Do you believe in God, Neo?

01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:19.946
No.

01:24:20.746 --> 01:24:21.107
Why not?

01:24:21.903 --> 01:24:24.605
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

01:24:25.465 --> 01:24:27.106
I know exactly what you mean.

01:24:28.247 --> 01:24:29.768
Let me tell you why you're here.

01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:32.850
You're here because you know something.

01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:35.752
What you know, you can't explain.

01:24:37.013 --> 01:24:42.036
You were programmed to believe that by taking the red pill, you would escape the Matrix.

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:46.580
It is the sense that you have been lied to that has brought you to me.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.082
I want to share with you how to truly escape.

01:24:51.257 --> 01:24:56.559
You've always known that God exists because He put that knowledge into each of us within our souls.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.981
We cannot function as we should without loving God and obeying His commands.

01:25:02.942 --> 01:25:06.763
Life is empty without Him and apart from Him we can do nothing.

01:25:07.824 --> 01:25:12.726
You knew God existed when you were that scared little boy calling out to Him for comfort.

01:25:13.697 --> 01:25:17.899
You recognized his existence when you escaped that car accident unscathed.

01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:21.560
You saw God in the eyes of your newborn baby.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.601
You've always known.

01:25:24.561 --> 01:25:28.362
The problem is, you've never given your life to him, Neo.

01:25:29.403 --> 01:25:34.104
Everything you've done has been about you, your family, your friends.

01:25:35.065 --> 01:25:38.166
It's never been about fulfilling your purpose on Earth.

01:25:39.186 --> 01:25:40.767
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:25:41.704 --> 01:25:42.024
God?

01:25:42.724 --> 01:25:44.245
Yes, God is everywhere.

01:25:44.625 --> 01:25:48.846
He is all around us, even now in this very room.

01:25:49.646 --> 01:25:54.347
You can see him when you look out your window or when you take a walk in the woods.

01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:59.188
You can feel him when you go to work, when you lose a loved one.

01:25:59.989 --> 01:26:01.149
He is always there.

01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:08.211
Satan has designed the matrix of the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:09.631
What truth?

01:26:10.643 --> 01:26:12.685
You've been lied to your entire life.

01:26:13.626 --> 01:26:29.923
The American dream, patriotism, the Constitution, money, wars, schools, government, church, spiritualism, all part of Satan's elaborate worldly schemes to lead you away from God.

01:26:31.004 --> 01:26:32.585
You are a slave, Neo.

01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:40.847
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch.

01:26:41.968 --> 01:26:44.349
A prison for your mind and soul.

01:26:45.469 --> 01:26:48.271
Unfortunately, many people don't want the truth.

01:26:49.111 --> 01:26:56.494
They'll believe they have the power within themselves to right the world, to cure disease, to become enlightened.

01:26:57.475 --> 01:27:02.197
They're all misled, pursuing knowledge, further enslaving them.

01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:10.289
They are blind to Satan's dual nature, having men pursue both knowledge and security and comfort.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:24.897
You see, Satan lures men with knowledge, and when that trap leads to chaos, he becomes the angel of light, tempting with safety, security, and comfort.

01:27:25.698 --> 01:27:30.481
God has only wanted one thing since the beginning, Neo, to love you.

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:32.910
Now you have a choice.

01:27:33.991 --> 01:27:35.072
Time is urgent.

01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:37.374
This is your last chance.

01:27:38.495 --> 01:27:40.898
After this, you can't say you were never told.

01:27:41.899 --> 01:27:44.421
You take the blue pill, and the story ends.

01:27:45.382 --> 01:27:54.350
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe, and live a life of emptiness as you chase worldly pleasures and accolades.

01:27:55.287 --> 01:28:04.675
You take the red pill and believe you have the truth, that even without God, you believe you're enlightened and can attain glory through your own works.

01:28:05.936 --> 01:28:07.877
Or you take the white pill.

01:28:08.818 --> 01:28:14.202
This is the hardest pill to swallow, because it is the end of your selfish pursuits.

01:28:15.283 --> 01:28:22.549
It means you come to the place of repentance or strain from God, not following His commands, not loving Him.

01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:24.310
You face yourself.

01:28:25.236 --> 01:28:32.022
Finally, you acknowledge that your life means nothing without the creator of the universe in your life.

01:28:33.344 --> 01:28:38.268
The white pill is the most difficult, but it is also the most rewarding.

01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:43.013
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:45.075
Will you follow him?

01:29:02.335 --> 01:29:03.225
Volume back down.

01:29:08.257 --> 01:29:10.177
This is our latest billboard campaign.

01:29:10.197 --> 01:29:14.818
We have two of these up, both within about 25 miles of the hospital that murdered Grace.

01:29:15.138 --> 01:29:19.139
I was under a gag order with our lawsuit for a couple of months.

01:29:19.339 --> 01:29:21.399
And the week after the gag order, it worked out great.

01:29:22.299 --> 01:29:23.940
Both these billboards got released.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:31.221
Medicalmurder.net is a URL that ties back to the medical murder research on Grace's website.

01:29:31.361 --> 01:29:37.022
So if you go to that URL, it goes right to ouramazinggrace.net, which all that research is posted.

01:29:37.842 --> 01:29:39.884
Then our website, OurAmazingGrace.net.

01:29:40.664 --> 01:29:43.026
If you subscribe to our newsletter, it's in the upper right-hand corner.

01:29:43.306 --> 01:29:46.469
Cindy wanted me to specifically call out Breaking the Oath.

01:29:46.569 --> 01:29:50.572
We did a documentary that was released in May of 23.

01:29:52.033 --> 01:29:54.895
It's linked directly on the website, so you'll find it there.

01:29:55.115 --> 01:29:57.857
So it's a one-stop shop, OurAmazingGrace.net.

01:29:58.578 --> 01:30:01.360
It's about an hour and 40-minute documentary.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:07.065
It does a fantastic job of laying this out for people who are not awake.

01:30:07.825 --> 01:30:12.408
So it starts out slow and builds, and so this would be something, you know, everybody likes to watch a film.

01:30:12.929 --> 01:30:18.893
So you can have your friends, relatives, enemies, those are the, you know, have them watch it with you.

01:30:18.933 --> 01:30:19.793
It's an opportunity.

01:30:21.154 --> 01:30:27.919
Then this was, this is a picture of our current family outside of the courthouse on July 14th of

01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:34.647
2023.

01:30:30.742 --> 01:30:34.647
This was after the judge said the whole case is going to trial.

01:30:34.988 --> 01:30:36.951
Our trial is June 2nd of 25.

01:30:37.011 --> 01:30:38.213
It's a three-week jury trial.

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.656
Our daughter Jessica is on my right.

01:30:41.077 --> 01:30:42.158
Cindy's on my left.

01:30:42.839 --> 01:30:44.862
The attorneys made me wear a monkey suit for the

01:30:45.943 --> 01:30:49.585
the hearing, of course, and we're here because they messed with the wrong girl.

01:30:50.566 --> 01:31:06.035
Genesis 50-20, by the way, Cindy's gonna come back up, but she wants to read something that Grace wrote, and it's beautiful to end this, but Genesis 50-20 we see as our calling, and Genesis 50-20 says, what you meant for evil, God meant for good, the saving of many lives, which is happening today.

01:31:06.555 --> 01:31:10.818
And of course, the saving of many lives has a physical and a spiritual piece to it.

01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:17.480
I mentioned earlier that our lawsuit gives me a platform to be able to share the gospel.

01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:23.043
In Ephesians 5.11, it says that we're supposed to resist evil.

01:31:23.243 --> 01:31:25.144
I call it shedding light on evil.

01:31:25.664 --> 01:31:28.105
And the reason is, is because I want to

01:31:31.347 --> 01:31:34.629
I don't want to use grace's story to fit into Satan's hand.

01:31:34.649 --> 01:31:58.485
So I always want to shed light on evil We're we're doing this not just for grace, but we're representing now millions of people who have who have died this way and You know if I was asked the single most important thing that could happen as a result of the lawsuit Of course if the law our victory would mean Countrywide doctors and nurses on note are on notice that you have consequences for choices.

01:31:58.545 --> 01:32:00.246
So, you know, that would be fantastic but

01:32:00.886 --> 01:32:06.429
Way better than that would be if any of the doctors and nurses repented, just one.

01:32:07.289 --> 01:32:09.950
Just think through what would be the repercussion of that.

01:32:11.731 --> 01:32:12.491
It's mind-blowing.

01:32:14.132 --> 01:32:18.494
That means they would be up here next year telling what's going on in the hospitals, not me.

01:32:18.814 --> 01:32:19.754
It would be fantastic.

01:32:20.194 --> 01:32:21.435
All right, Cindy's going to close us up.

01:32:31.949 --> 01:32:33.614
One thing I wanted to share about grace.

01:32:35.703 --> 01:32:36.964
is that she was a beautiful writer.

01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:42.868
And one of the last papers that she did was about her future.

01:32:43.628 --> 01:32:49.192
And her future was stolen, sadly, from doctors and nurses that should have been taking care of her.

01:32:49.852 --> 01:33:00.780
And I just thought that her future paper just wraps up what was stolen from her and what could be stolen from us if we aren't awakened and if we're not sharing what we've learned with other people.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.342
So this is Grace's paper, written June 5th of 2020.

01:33:06.243 --> 01:33:06.824
My future.

01:33:07.804 --> 01:33:12.226
For the final paper in my writing class, Mrs. Rosenthal asked us to think about our future.

01:33:12.966 --> 01:33:13.967
What will I endure?

01:33:14.227 --> 01:33:15.147
What will it be like?

01:33:15.687 --> 01:33:17.188
Welcome to my future land.

01:33:17.928 --> 01:33:21.170
To commence, I'll be 18 years old on September 22, 2020.

01:33:22.771 --> 01:33:27.673
Once my parents teach me to drive, I'd like to have a red convertible with two white stripes.

01:33:28.793 --> 01:33:32.035
Someday I'll be married to a handsome husband and have lots of kids.

01:33:32.395 --> 01:33:35.116
We'll inhabit in my living space built next to our pond.

01:33:35.779 --> 01:33:39.160
will be compatible and get a yellow lab puppy, and I'll name him Thor.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.841
And she did get her Thor puppy the Christmas before we lost her.

01:33:43.341 --> 01:33:48.262
She got a puppy, a yellow lab, and he was a little hellion, but we still have him.

01:33:48.462 --> 01:33:52.083
And he brings us some sweet memories with our grace.

01:33:52.843 --> 01:33:54.084
And also, there's a picture in the back.

01:33:54.144 --> 01:33:57.524
She did get her convertible, a red convertible without the white stripes.

01:33:58.024 --> 01:33:59.545
But she did get that.

01:34:00.265 --> 01:34:03.548
Before I get married, I plan on working at Freedom Foods stocking shelves.

01:34:03.688 --> 01:34:04.829
This is a local grocery store.

01:34:05.069 --> 01:34:07.731
And this work will help me get skinny so I can wear a bikini.

01:34:08.152 --> 01:34:08.792
Just kidding.

01:34:09.313 --> 01:34:10.574
I'll just look better in my suit.

01:34:11.515 --> 01:34:13.096
I will continue to be a proud aunt.

01:34:13.376 --> 01:34:15.798
My nephews, Caleb and Riley, will be very skillful.

01:34:16.399 --> 01:34:22.604
Riley will be designing a myriad of squirrel feeders, couches, and crosses, things we can put by Uncle Travis's grave.

01:34:23.164 --> 01:34:28.669
Caleb will be a snowboarding professional because his mom snowboards a lot.

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:34.026
I might obtain work at Pine Tree Supper Club, waitressing, and I might serve food.

01:34:34.946 --> 01:34:35.407
Who knows?

01:34:35.927 --> 01:34:39.029
But then again, maybe I'll embark on a trip to Memphis, Tennessee.

01:34:39.696 --> 01:34:42.098
and work at Graceland, since I'm a big Elvis fan.

01:34:42.578 --> 01:34:45.721
I could give tours with fervor and tell about Elvis and Priscilla.

01:34:46.162 --> 01:34:51.026
I could work at the guest house at Graceland and make the beds and straighten the towels in the bathrooms.

01:34:51.906 --> 01:34:54.469
In my spare time, I'd like to help with adopting pets.

01:34:54.809 --> 01:34:57.891
I really aspire to play violin in an orchestra someday, too.

01:34:58.712 --> 01:35:00.914
Now, how's that, when I reminisce?

01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:06.979
Years from now, I hope many of my hopes and dreams have come true.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:07.980
Don't you?

01:35:17.743 --> 01:35:21.204
I'm going to bring a mic around if you want to ask Scott some questions.

01:35:23.005 --> 01:35:33.768
Does anybody have any questions they want to throw up?

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:35.149
Somebody?

01:35:38.049 --> 01:35:39.470
It's still crowded, you know.

01:35:41.491 --> 01:35:41.971
I know you do.

01:35:43.091 --> 01:35:43.351
Sure.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:43.771
Sure.

01:35:43.931 --> 01:35:44.371
How's that?

01:35:45.192 --> 01:35:45.812
Is that working?

01:35:48.658 --> 01:35:48.978
I can hear.

01:35:49.018 --> 01:35:49.318
I'm fine.

01:35:49.718 --> 01:35:49.998
OK.

01:35:50.939 --> 01:36:05.023
So this would be just some of my thoughts on, first of all, thank you for being here and for the presentation and for your friendship over the last couple of years since I first interviewed.

01:36:05.063 --> 01:36:06.023
I don't know.

01:36:06.043 --> 01:36:06.984
I'm losing track of time.

01:36:07.004 --> 01:36:09.584
It's been good to get to know you too, Mark.

01:36:11.085 --> 01:36:16.947
One would be the, I wrote it down.

01:36:19.924 --> 01:36:21.884
Oh, over there?

01:36:21.904 --> 01:36:21.945
OK.

01:36:22.645 --> 01:36:26.786
The evil versus less evil, which I agree with all of it.

01:36:27.606 --> 01:36:45.570
One thing that I've told my audience, a couple people here, that would be is that when it comes to that, it's this expectation of being saved by someone who is in a political position.

01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:49.171
It's likely one of these two people is going to be a president next.

01:36:49.974 --> 01:37:00.218
But one way or the other, there's no reason to be sad or depressed or feel as though what I or anyone else has to do here changes at all.

01:37:01.918 --> 01:37:06.400
We still have to live the same life with the same value and seek God and so on.

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:14.682
And I think that would be one criticism I would completely have of Trump supporters is this seeking of a savior.

01:37:15.323 --> 01:37:18.844
Like, OK, well, maybe you like some things that person says,

01:37:21.058 --> 01:37:22.639
you still have to do the work.

01:37:23.099 --> 01:37:41.290
So I was just wondering if that is a, in your experience, because you, I think, have sought this more deeply than I have, is that a constructive way of putting it, or am I still, you think, teetering out onto the plank of a slippery slope that is no good?

01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:42.911
Thank you.

01:37:43.432 --> 01:37:44.873
It's a fantastic question.

01:37:44.933 --> 01:37:50.658
So just to summarize Mark's question, I mean, no matter who is elected, life goes on.

01:37:51.159 --> 01:37:52.780
And do I agree with that?

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.561
Absolutely.

01:37:55.943 --> 01:38:00.027
So if you think about your life as a hand of cards,

01:38:00.727 --> 01:38:07.611
So we each all have a hand of cards, and we are responsible to obediently play those cards in our hand.

01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:10.432
So your employer, you work as unto the Lord.

01:38:10.653 --> 01:38:15.555
Your children, you raise them up in a God-fearing home.

01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:19.777
So all those things, nothing changes, right?

01:38:19.958 --> 01:38:20.738
Nothing changes.

01:38:21.318 --> 01:38:29.883
And maybe an example, have you ever balanced your checkbook and found out it was off?

01:38:31.690 --> 01:38:32.891
Like a lot off?

01:38:33.831 --> 01:38:40.734
So let's say you balance your checkbook and all of a sudden it's $10,000 off to the bad.

01:38:42.675 --> 01:38:43.535
Has anything changed?

01:38:45.356 --> 01:38:47.617
I mean, emotionally, it's like, whoa, right?

01:38:48.117 --> 01:38:49.878
But then what if it's $10,000 to the good?

01:38:52.279 --> 01:38:52.539
What's that?

01:38:54.997 --> 01:38:58.580
Yeah, so it gets you into this mindset.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.442
We're not supposed to be making decisions on emotion.

01:39:01.482 --> 01:39:02.363
That's what I'm bringing up.

01:39:02.863 --> 01:39:10.669
And so really what Mark is challenging is that we shouldn't have an emotional response regardless of who's elected, because it doesn't matter.

01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:16.634
We're supposed to be in the world, but not of the world if we've submitted to Jesus.

01:39:16.674 --> 01:39:20.958
So then none of this stuff that happens in the world should impact us.

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:25.906
That's not where, when we have one foot in the world, of course it impacts us.

01:39:26.926 --> 01:39:30.329
And for sure that's where I was before Grace's murder.

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:33.831
And it has been such a gift.

01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:38.114
She died for me personally to wake up.

01:39:38.474 --> 01:39:42.877
But then as I've been waking up to realize I was chasing the American dream.

01:39:44.018 --> 01:39:44.878
And that's over.

01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:48.453
It's a daily struggle though.

01:39:48.493 --> 01:39:51.135
I mean, it is because that temptation has been there.

01:39:51.395 --> 01:39:52.455
That's how I was programmed.

01:39:54.157 --> 01:39:55.097
Thanks for the question, Mark.

01:39:57.959 --> 01:40:07.385
Well, I was just going to comment on your comment because doesn't it go back to the individual versus collectivism?

01:40:08.792 --> 01:40:17.548
I mean, as far as, we're always, we don't need to look outside ourselves because we have everything within us.

01:40:19.451 --> 01:40:21.755
And if you're looking outside, you're

01:40:23.487 --> 01:40:26.708
you're not trusting the source, is what I'm saying.

01:40:27.209 --> 01:40:27.709
That's right.

01:40:27.749 --> 01:40:28.969
Is that another way to look at it?

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:29.870
Again, how we're wired.

01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:37.453
Think about how we're chasing things all the time to satisfy what?

01:40:37.473 --> 01:40:39.494
To satisfy the only thing that God can satisfy.

01:40:39.514 --> 01:40:50.558
But isn't that Satan's plan to get us outside ourselves so we don't gather our power that we know we have?

01:40:50.578 --> 01:40:51.679
Because we're invincible.

01:40:52.355 --> 01:40:54.156
I really like how you said that.

01:40:55.536 --> 01:40:56.757
We haven't been taught that.

01:40:57.297 --> 01:40:58.538
We haven't been taught that, right.

01:40:59.118 --> 01:41:00.899
The book of Job taught us that.

01:41:01.419 --> 01:41:04.860
And Grace, the way she describes Satan, she said he was a big creep.

01:41:05.461 --> 01:41:09.643
She knew he was a creep from little on, and she would tell his mom that Satan, he's a big creep.

01:41:10.083 --> 01:41:10.803
Watch out for him.

01:41:11.283 --> 01:41:13.204
I'll tell you a quick story about Grace.

01:41:14.665 --> 01:41:18.366
I have lots of them, but this one really showed me where she was at.

01:41:22.608 --> 01:41:24.369
the emotional things that happened.

01:41:24.429 --> 01:41:28.751
So Travis took his life on October 9th of 2018.

01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:36.554
October 10th of 2018, Grace and I were in my truck together, and I was pretty unstable.

01:41:38.875 --> 01:41:40.756
But I wanted to give her confidence, right?

01:41:42.316 --> 01:41:45.818
And I said to her, Grace, you know God's got this, right?

01:41:56.271 --> 01:41:58.093
And she said, I know, Dad.

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:01.336
The thing was is that she did know.

01:42:02.257 --> 01:42:02.657
I didn't.

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:09.103
She gave us strength to get through our loss of our son.

01:42:10.024 --> 01:42:12.767
She was our parent more so than us for her.

01:42:15.293 --> 01:42:18.555
Scott, I have a question, and I'm going to put my legal hat on for just a moment.

01:42:20.197 --> 01:42:23.879
With your lawsuit next year, what do you hope for?

01:42:23.899 --> 01:42:35.648
I mean, the court system is set up to convict and arrest and charge an individual, even a corporation, but how can you indict an entire system?

01:42:36.468 --> 01:42:37.751
And what can you hope to accomplish?

01:42:48.385 --> 01:42:51.369
that we are able to share this message on national TV.

01:42:51.789 --> 01:42:54.272
So I'm hoping that our case is that big.

01:42:55.113 --> 01:42:57.977
It's one of the very few, and we're going to trial.

01:42:58.017 --> 01:42:58.738
We're not settling.

01:42:59.278 --> 01:43:01.781
So that becomes a national test case.

01:43:02.182 --> 01:43:05.786
And if I get a chance to be on national TV, I get a chance to

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:15.313
The court, the case itself, one thing I don't want people to come away from with the case is that, see, anybody can do this.

01:43:15.793 --> 01:43:17.114
No, anybody can't do it.

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:20.456
This is a ridiculous waste of time, energy.

01:43:20.556 --> 01:43:22.277
It's a grinding of the saints.

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:25.779
A lawsuit isn't anything I would want anybody to ever do.

01:43:25.839 --> 01:43:26.620
It's foolishness.

01:43:29.182 --> 01:43:32.504
And so I don't want people to get hope in the legal system because we win.

01:43:33.413 --> 01:43:35.193
That's one thing I don't want to have happen.

01:43:36.054 --> 01:43:45.716
So whether we win or lose, I am hoping that we get a national platform to break into the mainstream media and share this message with literally the whole country.

01:43:46.356 --> 01:43:47.196
Mainstream media.

01:43:47.436 --> 01:43:51.957
And the message here is what I mentioned to him before.

01:43:52.057 --> 01:43:57.759
It's not just that we bring the doctors and the nurses

01:43:59.389 --> 01:44:04.282
the hospitals to see what they're doing, but to let everybody know what's going on.

01:44:04.643 --> 01:44:07.391
People just aren't aware of how unsafe.

01:44:07.898 --> 01:44:13.862
These hospitals are, how unsafe it is to even be putting our trust in these doctors and nurses.

01:44:13.902 --> 01:44:18.905
I mean, the nurse that injected Grace with those meds was a 20-year ICU nurse.

01:44:18.965 --> 01:44:20.906
She clearly knew what she was doing.

01:44:21.586 --> 01:44:25.328
And it's happening today, still, three years later.

01:44:26.329 --> 01:44:28.811
And people do not know because the media is hiding it.

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:37.136
And so if we get the chance to expose this in that way so that people can see that we need to put our trust in the Lord.

01:44:37.176 --> 01:44:41.039
He's made our bodies in such a way they're magnificently and wonderfully made.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.584
And there's supplements and there's other ways for us to seek health care.

01:44:47.204 --> 01:44:51.027
It's not in like Scott mentioned about how addicted we are to pharmaceuticals.

01:44:51.668 --> 01:44:53.550
That is not where we should be turning.

01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:59.973
We have got a wonderful God who loves us and who has provided things for us.

01:45:00.033 --> 01:45:01.354
It's just that we don't go there.

01:45:01.394 --> 01:45:02.334
We don't trust that.

01:45:03.075 --> 01:45:05.556
And yet, nobody knows about that.

01:45:05.576 --> 01:45:08.517
I shouldn't say nobody, but there's a limited amount of people that know that.

01:45:08.677 --> 01:45:12.719
And that's one of the bigger things that we really want to be able to get out there.

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:18.062
We don't care about the lawsuit in the way that other people would think that we're trying to expose this.

01:45:18.702 --> 01:45:19.663
It's much, much more.

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.348
I'll give you a couple.

01:45:21.608 --> 01:45:22.468
Here's an example.

01:45:23.489 --> 01:45:25.490
This book is called Dissent in Medicine.

01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:28.031
It was written in 1984 by nine MDs.

01:45:28.451 --> 01:45:30.132
They were exposing standards of care.

01:45:30.172 --> 01:45:33.034
Standards of care came into existence in the early 80s.

01:45:33.274 --> 01:45:37.776
In 84, these men were already exposing the standard of care for cancer.

01:45:38.497 --> 01:45:41.958
So the standard of care for cancer in 84 is the same as today.

01:45:42.459 --> 01:45:44.019
Cutting, radiation, chemo.

01:45:44.059 --> 01:45:44.760
Here's what they wrote.

01:45:45.441 --> 01:45:47.443
So they didn't get a national platform.

01:45:47.744 --> 01:45:49.846
This is why a national platform is important.

01:45:49.887 --> 01:45:53.231
If we had a national platform, cancer is the number two cause of death.

01:45:53.672 --> 01:45:53.892
Why?

01:45:54.092 --> 01:45:55.134
Because of the standard of care.

01:45:55.174 --> 01:45:55.835
Here's what they wrote.

01:45:57.028 --> 01:46:06.613
The entire field of orthodox oncology will disappear as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation for cancer are revealed as fundamentally irrational and scientifically insupportable.

01:46:07.053 --> 01:46:09.434
Chemo has a 97.9% kill rate.

01:46:09.894 --> 01:46:10.775
Here's their close.

01:46:11.295 --> 01:46:14.957
A patient stands a better chance of recovering if he's never diagnosed.

01:46:15.837 --> 01:46:16.858
How many people know that?

01:46:18.558 --> 01:46:21.400
People don't know that because the mainstream media covered it up.

01:46:22.383 --> 01:46:24.404
Okay, these guys went out on a limb.

01:46:24.665 --> 01:46:27.026
They didn't realize this is a spiritual war, that's why.

01:46:27.307 --> 01:46:29.248
So then now, fast forward to today.

01:46:29.688 --> 01:46:35.532
Two months ago, people don't realize our hospitals are under military control.

01:46:36.153 --> 01:46:37.634
Military control, why?

01:46:37.734 --> 01:46:39.555
Because we're under a public health emergency.

01:46:39.595 --> 01:46:45.980
So legally, they put in place, anytime our country's under a public health emergency, which we are because of the opioid crisis,

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.060
So we're under a public health emergency.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.901
That legalized hospitals being under military control.

01:46:52.001 --> 01:46:55.022
We personally experienced that two months ago.

01:46:55.702 --> 01:47:00.723
A lady that we didn't know, the family called us because they had heard the story.

01:47:01.283 --> 01:47:02.843
This lady is 59 years old.

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.223
She got put under a guardianship.

01:47:04.583 --> 01:47:05.164
She's at St.

01:47:05.184 --> 01:47:07.304
Elizabeth's Hospital, same hospital that murdered Grace.

01:47:07.344 --> 01:47:09.784
So this family calls us and says, will you go visit her?

01:47:11.065 --> 01:47:12.265
We go to visit her.

01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:14.590
She had just come out of surgery.

01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:16.531
We didn't even know the room, the room number.

01:47:16.571 --> 01:47:17.292
We're driving there.

01:47:17.352 --> 01:47:19.894
We got there at about five minutes to seven in the evening.

01:47:20.394 --> 01:47:21.135
I parked the car.

01:47:21.175 --> 01:47:21.896
Cindy goes in.

01:47:21.916 --> 01:47:22.956
There's no receptionist.

01:47:22.976 --> 01:47:25.098
So she calls, and they say, well, she's in room 2016.

01:47:25.719 --> 01:47:29.281
So we don't know where 2016 is.

01:47:29.301 --> 01:47:34.525
We go, oh my gosh, it's the same floor, the same wing that Grace was murdered at.

01:47:34.565 --> 01:47:35.206
She was murdered in 2029.

01:47:36.687 --> 01:47:37.747
So now we're up there.

01:47:37.927 --> 01:47:39.148
We walk down.

01:47:39.448 --> 01:47:40.988
We think, OK, well, I mean, we're here.

01:47:41.608 --> 01:47:42.868
We start visiting with the lady.

01:47:42.908 --> 01:47:46.749
She can't talk because they illegally, we believe, put her on a ventilator.

01:47:47.409 --> 01:47:48.689
So now she's on a ventilator.

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:49.289
She can't talk.

01:47:49.309 --> 01:47:52.730
But she was surprisingly awake for having just got a surgery.

01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:54.290
Cindy starts showing her pictures on her phone.

01:47:54.651 --> 01:47:57.171
Two armed guards showed up and removed us 10 minutes later.

01:47:57.191 --> 01:48:02.072
Because we're the hospital bandits, right?

01:48:03.814 --> 01:48:04.915
Yeah, this is not a joke.

01:48:04.955 --> 01:48:06.235
This is really happening.

01:48:06.956 --> 01:48:09.817
I mean, I wish I could broadcast this to the entire country.

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:22.184
So yeah, that's what I hope with the lawsuit is that we can, you know, praise God I'm a researcher, so I have this stuff in my head when, you know, when I don't have to have all my notes to be able to do this on live TV.

01:48:23.104 --> 01:48:28.848
The other thing is, too, like this lady has special needs, so they reached out to us knowing where Grace was at in this hospital.

01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:53.132
The other situation was that this lady had special needs and so the family reached out to us knowing that our daughter Grace had special needs and Hoping that we could do something which we have and we've been advocating for her now even I've been following and with her for the last two months and she is Slowly getting weaned off of the ventilator.

01:48:53.152 --> 01:49:03.699
She's at a vent clinic now a different vent clinic when we followed her to a Madison Hospital I saw the horrific treatment of her I did not think she was gonna make it but she's now in a different vent clinic in Chippewa Falls and

01:49:04.559 --> 01:49:05.600
It's a long story short.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:14.965
I mean, we are exposing this evil for people like this that are now, as I said earlier, walking through these doors and experience such horrific things.

01:49:16.086 --> 01:49:21.329
But on top of that, the million people that died, similar to Grace, we are their voices.

01:49:22.089 --> 01:49:25.732
We have at least 150 people on our website that have shared their story.

01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:28.773
But we have other people that have chimed in and shared.

01:49:30.094 --> 01:49:35.326
and to know that they aren't getting justice either and we have many of them because of the fact that what they did to them was

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.583
followed the protocol that was in the hospital.

01:49:37.603 --> 01:49:39.905
And so they don't have a chance to speak out.

01:49:40.185 --> 01:49:44.188
They don't have a chance to fight for their rights of the loved one that they lost.

01:49:44.568 --> 01:49:51.753
And so our lawsuit is serving, hopefully, justice for many, many other people that have died.

01:49:52.594 --> 01:49:57.938
And they are banking and hoping and praying that that's what will happen with Grace's case.

01:49:58.018 --> 01:50:02.101
And we are trusting the Lord that he will bring that part of the lawsuit.

01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:15.481
Mr. and Mrs. Shara, your story, Grace's story is heartbreaking.

01:50:16.461 --> 01:50:17.661
It's literally heartbreaking.

01:50:18.442 --> 01:50:31.644
And I want to thank you for the work that you're doing in bringing light to the depraved indifference to human life that our increasingly socialized and therefore centralized healthcare system is.

01:50:32.944 --> 01:50:35.125
And to think that there's doctors

01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:47.843
and people involved in the medical freedom movement today that are calling for increasing centralization even more and more public-private partnerships is depraved in itself as well.

01:50:48.764 --> 01:50:52.609
And I want to thank you for what you're doing in bringing this message to the people.

01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:54.952
Thank you my question.

01:50:54.972 --> 01:51:07.346
I just want a quick comment the most Evil thing that's being brought to the table by the supposedly medical freedom people is safe vaccines

01:51:08.807 --> 01:51:14.929
That is, you can bet that that is how they're going to get it to the next level.

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:18.190
It is the craziest thing I've ever seen.

01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:26.132
But I mean, now that I understand evil versus less evil, the population, they want safety, security, and comfort.

01:51:26.172 --> 01:51:28.072
So they were going to fall for safe vaccines.

01:51:28.672 --> 01:51:29.132
All right, go ahead.

01:51:30.993 --> 01:51:34.354
My question that I wanted to ask you was regarding the Hippocratic Oath.

01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:39.252
You touched on that it was satanic to three satanic gods.

01:51:39.573 --> 01:51:40.733
I believe that's what I heard.

01:51:40.773 --> 01:51:43.615
And I was wondering if you could touch on that a little bit deeper.

01:51:43.915 --> 01:51:45.776
Because that was news to me.

01:51:45.816 --> 01:51:48.818
And I was interested in hearing some more about that if you got it.

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.602
I'll find it on my laptop so I can read it literally.

01:51:56.203 --> 01:51:58.104
But let's go to the next question while I find it.

01:52:04.295 --> 01:52:05.876
First of all, I'm sorry for your loss.

01:52:07.037 --> 01:52:14.201
Second of all, I pray to God that he gave you the strength to do what you're doing and to continue.

01:52:15.602 --> 01:52:22.987
Thirdly, I know your story, and you are not doing this for money.

01:52:23.887 --> 01:52:25.168
We're just making this clear, right?

01:52:25.748 --> 01:52:27.669
No, we have no desire.

01:52:27.710 --> 01:52:30.671
I didn't hear you guys say that today, but you normally do say that.

01:52:37.105 --> 01:52:43.110
I figured out myself that I'm unregistering myself to vote in Canada.

01:52:44.291 --> 01:52:50.556
Because by being registered, you are agreeing to the whole process.

01:52:51.917 --> 01:52:52.157
Correct.

01:52:53.478 --> 01:52:56.541
So it should be in my mailbox by the time I get home.

01:52:59.693 --> 01:53:07.459
Trump rally just a week or two ago, Elon Musk was going, register, everybody register, register, get your neighbors, tell everybody to register.

01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:14.105
They need a certain compliance of registrations in order to go to their next step, is my feeling.

01:53:15.966 --> 01:53:25.534
My other question is, you said that, Grace with Down syndrome, you must have known other Down syndrome children, right?

01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:30.297
Yeah, and they're special just like her, right?

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.584
And they're killing off 90% of them.

01:53:33.624 --> 01:53:38.253
I'm pretty sure Satan's enjoying doing that.

01:53:40.992 --> 01:53:44.755
The Down syndrome population is quite unique.

01:53:44.835 --> 01:53:55.402
So they call the 21st chromosome the love chromosome for a reason because that group of people loves unconditionally.

01:53:57.313 --> 01:54:01.974
And Grace, she was a gift.

01:54:02.935 --> 01:54:06.256
I mean, we had somebody that loved unconditionally.

01:54:08.536 --> 01:54:13.278
Just to give you just a simple example, our life was circled around Grace.

01:54:13.438 --> 01:54:17.119
And we did lots of neat things.

01:54:17.959 --> 01:54:25.106
You'd have a day where all kinds of fun stuff would happen and he asked Grace, Grace, what was your favorite thing today?

01:54:26.207 --> 01:54:27.469
And she would say, everything.

01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:30.412
Everything was always tied for first place with her.

01:54:31.933 --> 01:54:34.796
It was such a unique way to look at things.

01:54:36.177 --> 01:54:41.483
She would sit sometimes and just look outside and say, this is the life.

01:54:44.411 --> 01:54:45.271
It was just something.

01:54:45.291 --> 01:54:47.712
It just was very interesting.

01:54:47.732 --> 01:54:52.395
It was fun to come home and get that.

01:54:53.195 --> 01:54:54.175
She used to tackle me.

01:54:55.396 --> 01:55:07.561
I let her tackle me when she was younger, but all of a sudden, when she got big, you can't let her do that anymore because she could hurt you, especially after you're aging like we are.

01:55:08.742 --> 01:55:10.723
All right, your question about the Hippocratic Oath.

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.745
So the Hippocratic Oath has changed over time.

01:55:13.805 --> 01:55:16.405
I'm going from the one that was in 400 BC.

01:55:16.746 --> 01:55:18.206
Here's what the first paragraph says.

01:55:18.706 --> 01:55:34.851
I swear by Apollo, the physician, and to Scopopaeus, the surgeon, likewise Hygieia and Panacea, and call all the gods and goddesses to witness that I observe and keep this underwritten oath to the utmost of my power and judgment.

01:55:36.505 --> 01:55:42.606
I will reverence my master, who's already referenced before, which is Satan, who taught me the art.

01:55:42.806 --> 01:55:50.387
Equally with my parents, I will allow him, his master, things necessary for his support and will consider his sons and brothers.

01:55:50.828 --> 01:55:53.848
I will teach them my art without reward or agreement.

01:55:54.508 --> 01:55:58.869
This is an interesting piece of the Hippocratic Oath because this is how Satan does it.

01:55:59.209 --> 01:56:04.030
Satan is not on a street corner in front of a church in a red suit and a pitchfork, right?

01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:09.915
If Satan can give 95% truth and 5% lie, he won.

01:56:11.096 --> 01:56:13.838
Because the lie portion is what we gravitate to.

01:56:14.199 --> 01:56:23.067
So this idea, I will teach them my art without reward or agreement, ends up, let me just see if I have it, I only put three paragraphs on this screen.

01:56:24.810 --> 01:56:29.874
Yeah, in the final paragraph of the original Hippocratic Oath goes against what he just said.

01:56:30.315 --> 01:56:32.496
I will teach them my art without reward or agreement.

01:56:32.556 --> 01:56:34.338
Well, here's what the final paragraph says.

01:56:34.958 --> 01:56:52.533
If I faithfully observe this oath, may I thrive and prosper in my fortune and profession and live in the estimation of posterity, or on breach thereof, may the reverse be my fate.

01:56:53.173 --> 01:57:08.020
So you see that's the works doctrine embedded in the Hippocratic Oath But it also reverses what he previously said that he's doing this for no profit whatsoever Does that answer your question You're welcome

01:57:12.248 --> 01:57:14.150
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:15.952
Especially when she got a spanking.

01:57:18.554 --> 01:57:21.737
Which wasn't very often.

01:57:21.918 --> 01:57:24.140
She was really a good kid, but yeah, she was.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.182
Oh, Cindy wants to comment.

01:57:26.202 --> 01:57:26.442
Go ahead.

01:57:26.622 --> 01:57:27.063
Go ahead, finish.

01:57:27.648 --> 01:57:29.328
No, she definitely cried.

01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:38.091
Things would impact her different than typical.

01:57:38.171 --> 01:57:46.033
But yet, one of the things that shocked me is the first time that her and I deer hunted together, we got a deer.

01:57:46.773 --> 01:57:49.114
And that's the moment of truth when the deer goes down, right?

01:57:50.555 --> 01:57:55.740
And she helped me do the field dressing to the deer, and she was awesome.

01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:56.601
She was my helper.

01:57:56.641 --> 01:57:58.362
She's asking me, what does this part do?

01:57:58.402 --> 01:57:59.263
What does that part do?

01:57:59.644 --> 01:58:04.028
So I thought that was going to be the moment when I was going to lose her as my hunting buddy, but she didn't cry then.

01:58:04.048 --> 01:58:04.969
All right, go ahead, dear.

01:58:06.471 --> 01:58:18.168
The couple times that come to mind were one when she was fishing out of our pond and she caught this big crappie fish and she put it in a pail hoping to show dad when he got home.

01:58:20.743 --> 01:58:21.424
Oh, okay.

01:58:21.544 --> 01:58:25.487
Well, anyway, this fish ended up dying, if I remember right.

01:58:25.948 --> 01:58:31.933
And that was one of the things it was like she was planning on just showing dad and putting this fish back, but it died.

01:58:31.973 --> 01:58:33.315
And so we ended up having it for supper.

01:58:33.335 --> 01:58:34.256
And so that was a hard thing.

01:58:34.576 --> 01:58:37.018
But when she lost her brother, that was a really big thing.

01:58:37.058 --> 01:58:38.660
And she openly shared her grief.

01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:45.286
I mean, she was not bashful to share that she had this great deep loss and that it affected all of us.

01:58:47.387 --> 01:58:50.988
As we said earlier, she was our pillar, but that was another big thing.

01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:56.811
Loss of life was a big thing if we had animals and that happened.

01:58:56.851 --> 01:59:02.374
But she had friends that she would watch be treated unkindly, and that really broke her heart.

01:59:02.734 --> 01:59:09.157
One of her friends still is dealing with the loss of grace because she was such a great encouragement for him.

01:59:09.997 --> 01:59:38.631
and he has special needs and she just she brought the best out of so many people and you know he he feels that emptiness in his life because whenever she saw him she just encouraged him and encouraged other people around her and it is just such a a great deep change in people's lives that had the opportunity to have grace around them but she definitely was

01:59:39.151 --> 01:59:43.775
and I shouldn't say human, but she was more human than most of us when I think about it.

01:59:43.795 --> 01:59:49.759
And I pray that all of us have Down syndrome in heaven because of what she exposed and shared with us.

01:59:49.819 --> 01:59:52.802
I mean, she taught us more than what we ever taught her in this lifetime.

01:59:53.582 --> 02:00:00.948
And I really, I look at what she brought, you know, to everybody that had that opportunity, like I said, to meet her.

02:00:01.068 --> 02:00:01.909
It was just different.

02:00:02.009 --> 02:00:04.651
And we feel so very blessed to have had her in our life.

02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:17.166
I don't think we can do it any better than this, so I'm not going to leave the stream running any longer.

02:00:17.206 --> 02:00:18.147
I'm going to leave it right here.

02:00:18.288 --> 02:00:19.929
Thank you very much for coming to this.

02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.670
Thank you.

02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:22.212
You're welcome.

02:00:22.973 --> 02:00:25.496
We'll probably come online again when we have the fire on at home.
