00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
I wonder if I can do this in an hour, I don't know if I can do it in an hour or not, but

00:07.880 --> 00:10.240
I would sure like to be done by 10.30.

00:10.240 --> 00:15.200
Let's see if I can pull Liz off.

00:15.200 --> 00:22.200
Let's see if I can do it in an hour or not, but let's see if I can do it in an hour.

00:45.200 --> 00:52.200
Let's see if I can do it in an hour or not, but let's see if I can do it in an hour.

01:15.200 --> 01:27.440
Every once in a while I'm going to need a break.

01:27.440 --> 01:35.120
I'm going to try and pull off something real strong in December, and real strong in January,

01:35.120 --> 01:41.800
and so since the book comes out next week, I'm going to try and take it real, real easy

01:41.800 --> 01:47.920
this week and get ready for a huge push all through the holidays.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.480
We're going to hit it like we haven't in a very long time.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.560
You scheduled for 60 minutes next.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.640
Thanks for being here everybody, good to see you guys.

01:55.640 --> 02:00.800
Oh, French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.680
People everywhere are starting to listen to him, it's embarrassing.

02:11.800 --> 02:23.840
It is kind of ready to start.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.360
I think starting next week we're going to be having a PDF, and it's probably going to

02:29.360 --> 02:35.160
be every Thursday is the day that we'll do the show with the PDF, a full introduction,

02:35.160 --> 02:42.400
a full coverage of what we did the week before, and then the PDF to download.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.680
You'll be able to see the update in the broadcast schedule as we move forward on the website,

02:47.680 --> 02:55.040
and I am going to start to kind of gently ask people that can and don't mind to support

02:55.040 --> 02:58.240
by either subscribing, becoming a producer or a collaborator.

02:58.240 --> 03:05.120
Those are just higher commitments, and it would be really appreciated because I think

03:05.120 --> 03:09.200
actually this next year is going to be really important because it's a make or break time

03:09.200 --> 03:16.240
for a lot of things, and I want to be prepared to pretty much go out on my own, so we'll see.

04:05.120 --> 04:21.480
I don't know why that was so loud, sorry about that, I got to reset that slide or something,

04:21.480 --> 04:25.680
I don't know what I did with that, that was really loud, I didn't notice it though, but

04:25.680 --> 04:31.040
I could see it on the meter.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.240
So I don't know if this is really going to catch on, it doesn't matter if it does, it's

04:34.240 --> 04:35.640
just a concept, right?

04:35.640 --> 04:39.240
I'm not attached to anything or anybody.

04:39.240 --> 04:44.640
I do work a day job, but that day job is completely independent of what I'm doing here, so welcome

04:44.640 --> 05:04.120
to the show, this is Kego on Biological.

05:04.120 --> 05:09.080
We are trying to break this faith in a novel virus because the faith is a lie, I don't

05:09.080 --> 05:13.480
know exactly the details, but I do know for sure that intramuscular ejection in any combination

05:13.480 --> 05:17.920
of substance to the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, I do know that

05:17.920 --> 05:22.440
transfection, healthy humans is criminally negligent, I do know that bangs are not

05:22.440 --> 05:33.240
attached to the integrity's, that's what I know for sure, it's still getting loud

05:33.240 --> 05:36.840
in here, sorry about that, I don't know what I'm doing, I got my headphones in so it's

05:36.840 --> 05:44.480
not that, but we seem to have lost some viewers because I can't control my sound, sorry,

05:44.480 --> 05:48.040
anyway they'll be back if they know it's good for them.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.800
We are trying to defend ourselves against this faith in a novel virus that killed millions

05:51.800 --> 05:57.080
of people and millions more were saved from, this is Kego on Biological.

05:57.080 --> 06:04.160
Hey Vilma's in the house, Vilma in the house, wow that's kind of cool, hey that was supposed

06:04.160 --> 06:12.720
to go already, and then here we are here, and then I push, I think this button and then

06:12.720 --> 06:17.720
this button and then good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show, this is Kego

06:17.720 --> 06:24.800
on Biological, a high resistance low noise information brief, brought to you by a biologist,

06:24.800 --> 06:30.720
it is the 27th of November, 2023, I missed my show yesterday for reasons being family

06:30.720 --> 06:36.880
and basketball and such, I don't tend to miss very many and I won't, I don't intend on

06:36.880 --> 06:42.480
missing very many, however if I do miss one, I will apologize afterward and not before

06:42.480 --> 06:46.360
because I'm usually trying to figure out if I can squeeze it in right up until the last

06:46.400 --> 06:52.760
minute, which is probably not the best way to do it, but it's the kind of the way that

06:52.760 --> 07:00.080
I feel with this thing either I got it ready and I pull the pin and throw the grenade or

07:00.080 --> 07:04.120
I put it back on the desk and wait until tomorrow and I'm trying really hard to have

07:04.120 --> 07:07.040
a grenade ready every night.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.880
I am a former patch clamp physiologist, neurobiologist, I used to be an academic biologist, I'm a

07:12.920 --> 07:17.000
recovering academicician if you will.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.960
You can find my record of that work on PubMed, you can look COU, EY, dash, J, J will bring

07:24.960 --> 07:28.840
up all the articles in which I have participated.

07:28.840 --> 07:33.720
The basic gist of what I did was work with mice and rats, it's very seldom but sometimes

07:33.720 --> 07:40.880
monkeys and even sometimes tissue taken from humans with glioma surgery that extra tissue

07:40.880 --> 07:46.680
comes out, I've even recorded from human neurons, so not to say that that's any big

07:46.680 --> 07:52.920
deal, lots of people have done it, but it does put me in a position to at least say that

07:52.920 --> 07:58.560
I was a professional academic biologist for long enough to struggle on the tenure track

07:58.560 --> 08:03.480
to try and get grants, the whole thing, I know how that hierarchy works and doesn't

08:03.480 --> 08:08.080
work, I know the kinds of people that rise up within it and I've struggled to rise up

08:08.080 --> 08:15.520
within it myself, mostly from the perspective of not being able to fit in with the reductionist

08:15.520 --> 08:19.920
biological aspect of it, the reductionist science of it.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.000
The reason why I chose Gigaome biological is because Gigaome is the resistance of the

08:25.000 --> 08:30.320
electrical seal that you make with borosilicate pipettes onto the neurons when you record

08:30.320 --> 08:35.100
from them and so it just made sense to call this Gigaome biological a high resistance

08:35.100 --> 08:39.060
that's low noise information brief, it's just geeky.

08:39.060 --> 08:43.180
So we've been trying to figure out this Scooby-Doo for the last three years, we were fooled

08:43.180 --> 08:49.060
into believing that there was a mystery to solve, we were fooled by an illusion of consensus

08:49.060 --> 08:57.060
on both sides, on Fox News and on MSNBC and although those channels might have seemed

08:57.060 --> 09:03.020
to take very different positions, they were different positions within a very limited

09:03.100 --> 09:09.140
spectrum of debate and a very vigorous debate within it and so that debate was actually

09:09.140 --> 09:14.340
a controlled one and within that controlled debate we were fooled into believing that

09:14.340 --> 09:22.340
we were real time solving this mystery of who let the virus out and in solving this

09:22.340 --> 09:27.940
mystery what you do is you accept the monsters in the story and in this case the monsters

09:27.940 --> 09:32.420
in the story are pandemic potential viruses that can either be in bad caves or be accessed

09:32.420 --> 09:38.820
with cell culture, animal passage or genetic stitching and it is with this mythology that

09:38.820 --> 09:44.340
we have accepted because we accepted the challenge of the Scooby-Doo and we watched in real time

09:44.340 --> 09:48.740
as these people's masks were removed and we realized that it was just eco-health alliance

09:48.740 --> 09:56.780
in Tony Fauci in cooperation with the Wuhan lab USAID and Ralph Barrick and thank goodness

09:56.780 --> 10:01.660
for people like Robert Malone and Andrew Huff and the other people who've really blown

10:01.700 --> 10:08.620
the whistle on this and saved us from catastrophe but because gain of function is real and it

10:08.620 --> 10:12.940
could definitely come again it's going to inevitably result in us surrendering our sovereignty

10:12.940 --> 10:19.860
to the who and so we better make some underground networks and let it all fall down and we'll

10:19.860 --> 10:26.580
reorganize after it collapses that's really the state of things right now and I want to

10:26.580 --> 10:33.140
really try to avoid that and the way that I think we avoid that is to identify this illusion

10:33.140 --> 10:38.140
of consensus for what it is a faith in a novel virus that killed millions of people from which

10:38.140 --> 10:44.660
millions of more were saved the likely source of which is gain of function research and even if

10:44.660 --> 10:48.980
it wasn't if we're lucky enough that this was a natural one and that means even things are even

10:48.980 --> 10:56.540
worse when the inevitable gain of function lab leak actually does occur and again if you saw

10:56.540 --> 11:03.900
the mystery then you also accepted the monsters and these monsters are the mythology that the

11:03.900 --> 11:09.820
new world order wants to put on you that's the new world order they want to put on our kids that

11:09.820 --> 11:18.140
in reality they've been constructing around us for decades starting with our academic our

11:18.140 --> 11:29.420
catamagicians the people that work in universities and in laboratories it is a mythology that has

11:29.420 --> 11:37.140
been extended to everyone and everyone's understanding has been brought up to speed and the way that

11:37.140 --> 11:43.260
we have been changed they've changed the way that we think about very big ideas including our place

11:43.340 --> 11:51.420
in our own ecosystem including our relationship with the sacred even the existence of the sacred

11:53.180 --> 11:55.820
that's the spectacular nature of this

12:01.900 --> 12:06.220
and so I am trying to break it I'm trying to nobody likes to hear about right foreign

12:06.780 --> 12:12.780
I'm trying to break it as a card game and so I want you to think of it as

12:13.500 --> 12:18.860
the way that they have you're playing in a card game but all of the hands are all the decks are

12:18.860 --> 12:24.540
rigged and so we were dealt a hand and we thought wow okay we're gonna play some cards here right

12:24.540 --> 12:31.260
we're gonna we're gonna fool some people but everybody at the tables in on it and even though

12:31.260 --> 12:35.980
you think the new guy that came in the room has got to be trustworthy because he came in and he's

12:35.980 --> 12:41.420
soaking wet in the rain he didn't have a fancy car he must be trustworthy he's also in on it

12:43.820 --> 12:48.060
and the lady who's taking the drinks at the table who's winking at you and stuff and you think oh

12:48.060 --> 12:52.380
well she can't be in on it these guys are bad guys but she's not in a she's in on it too

12:55.500 --> 13:00.300
and that's what's happened here every time we think somebody's coming out and actually putting

13:01.100 --> 13:06.700
you know some real skin in the game you know like you think of when a person has an autistic child

13:07.740 --> 13:14.300
or when you think of a person who's lost somebody to cancer they've got real skin in the game they

13:14.300 --> 13:21.500
lost something for real you think that people have sacrificed their careers for this you think

13:21.500 --> 13:25.900
that people have put their lives on the line for it but they got a book deal at least good for them

13:26.460 --> 13:29.900
they got a super successful stub stack for like three years good for them

13:30.460 --> 13:35.580
they've been traveling the world all at all the time all expenses paid treated like a rock star

13:35.580 --> 13:42.060
but that's cool it's okay they law they they sacrificed a lot they sacrificed a lot and they

13:42.060 --> 13:52.460
were censored this information was available before the pandemic this lady's dead now but she was she

13:52.460 --> 13:57.180
was doing tours in the united states before the pandemic the last one nobody likes to hear about

13:57.180 --> 14:04.780
right foreign human and animal DNA but i'm going to go there because i'm taking on pharma so why

14:04.780 --> 14:09.980
would i not go there why would i sugarcoat it where do you think plant parenthood selling all those

14:09.980 --> 14:20.140
babies yeah and where are the churches aluminum the top one on here and no neurotoxin it's linked

14:20.140 --> 14:24.620
to breast cancer through traditional deodorant right farm is laughing at us because they have a

14:24.620 --> 14:31.740
vaccine for breast cancer that they're developing guess what the adjuvant is aluminum they're

14:31.740 --> 14:37.420
blatantly laughing at us holy smokes we need to be out there screaming this from the rooftop

14:38.540 --> 14:45.900
oh but everyone says but immunity brandy vaccine saved us immunity does not occur from the arm you

14:45.980 --> 14:49.020
cannot bypass the natural immune system

14:51.020 --> 14:56.140
and injected in inject things into the arm and have immunity it does not create real immunity

14:56.140 --> 15:03.740
temporary rise in antibodies which can last you know months to years and antibodies not real

15:03.740 --> 15:11.580
immunity you cannot bypass the immune system and expect real immunity years before the pandemic

15:11.580 --> 15:21.180
ladies and gentlemen it's not my idea it's not even close to my idea there's been lots of smart

15:21.180 --> 15:30.540
immunologists there's been lots of them lots of smart doctors you just didn't see them because the

15:30.540 --> 15:37.340
system already worked very well you just had never heard of them because the system already

15:37.820 --> 15:42.540
worked very well it actually got a little bit out of control as the internet became bigger as

15:42.540 --> 15:51.020
social media became bigger it got a little bit out of control i assure you used to be a lot

15:51.020 --> 16:00.220
better for them back in the day in some ways in the sense that bad unfriendly

16:00.940 --> 16:08.700
unhandy information could not run free as easily as it can in theory could have run

16:08.700 --> 16:15.580
free a few years ago i'm not so sure it can run very free now but you know via email it could

16:17.820 --> 16:22.140
email chains used to be the dangerous thing maybe we need to start those again

16:23.020 --> 16:29.420
let's let her finish sorry about that it also bypasses the detox system and that's why we're

16:29.500 --> 16:36.060
seeing so much damage so much sickness but you know don't believe a lot that the cdc says

16:36.060 --> 16:39.660
but this is a really great report that's probably going to be pulled off the website tomorrow

16:40.860 --> 16:45.740
the cdc credits chlorinated water for the reduction in infectious disease

16:46.700 --> 16:52.300
chlorinated water not vaccines that's pharma that's pharma spinning it

16:52.940 --> 17:01.660
number two killer in the u.s in 1900 the year 1900 tuberculosis cholera was in there too pneumonia

17:01.660 --> 17:11.020
no vaccine programs so if vaccines were really saving us we'd all be dead the best defense

17:11.020 --> 17:18.300
against disease a healthy strong immune system not overloaded with toxins from food from water

17:18.300 --> 17:24.380
from air and this is what everyone in here needs to get everyone they know to understand

17:26.300 --> 17:33.900
so it's really not test check this out it's really not new information i have i have it set

17:33.900 --> 17:41.100
up now where i can zoom up if i want to get really mad um to me it's uh

17:41.180 --> 17:48.380
uh it's just extraordinary that it took me this long to find it i'm still very ashamed

17:48.380 --> 17:54.300
of myself i have to very be very honest i've been i i have to be very ashamed that i didn't see

17:55.020 --> 18:03.740
how much exaggeration and dumb simple and stupid complicated were being used to really distort

18:04.380 --> 18:12.140
where the edge of our understanding was and where the edge of our potential technological limits are

18:13.500 --> 18:19.420
just a little hand waving and now suddenly we can do things that you know when i was a kid nobody

18:19.420 --> 18:24.700
would have ever waxed intellectual about when we can do what i mean

18:25.020 --> 18:31.580
I mean it's it is very shocking so then let's go forward

18:31.580 --> 18:37.820
extension health one year we're gonna go one year after the start of the pandemic

18:38.540 --> 18:45.180
and i want you to think back to what you were thinking in 2021 in december when they were rolling

18:45.180 --> 18:50.700
out the first shots in hospitals what were you thinking about in 2020 were you angry already

18:51.500 --> 18:58.300
were you already saying i can't believe they're starting by transfecting the doctors and nurses

18:58.300 --> 19:05.100
and old people like it is the most ridiculous thing they have even if there wasn't i mean at

19:05.100 --> 19:11.740
that time i had no idea that there might not be evidence of spread but i did know that by this

19:11.740 --> 19:18.140
time all of those people who had been on the front lines for six apparently six months had had more

19:18.220 --> 19:23.660
than enough exposure to any antigens that would be necessary to protect them from extreme serious

19:23.660 --> 19:32.940
disease if all of their basic biological cartoons were true and so when this started out i was losing

19:32.940 --> 19:39.740
my mind their first shots victor yes that's right it was a very long time coming but the higher

19:39.740 --> 19:45.100
ups here at the hospital they're saying that the vaccines that yes it was a very long time coming

19:45.100 --> 19:49.980
so long in fact that it's unlikely that any of these doctors would need the shot

19:49.980 --> 19:54.940
natural immunity typically develops after even a mild infection with a normal virus

19:54.940 --> 20:00.140
so i don't understand what kind of RNA virus this is but i can't imagine all these people need a

20:00.140 --> 20:07.020
shot oh my gosh i can't believe it arrived earlier today our real shot of hope

20:15.580 --> 20:20.940
a total of 10 people received the covid vaccination Wednesday at Ascension Providence Hospital

20:20.940 --> 20:25.180
leaving many to ask the question could this finally be the end of the pandemic that's

20:25.180 --> 20:31.580
plagued the globe for so long the devastation that's been caused by covid is is a once-in-a-lifetime

20:31.580 --> 20:35.660
thing now there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel to finally get us through the dark

20:35.660 --> 20:41.260
ages of covid-19 and of course it's the hospital workers on the front lines getting the injection

20:41.260 --> 20:48.860
first of those 10 was nurse Russell Patel it just feels like we are on the road what a strange

20:48.860 --> 20:57.660
symbol that is if you don't see a pyramid floating over like the top of another pyramid in the white

20:57.660 --> 21:03.100
part there it's just a little weird i don't know what this is going i don't know what to say anymore

21:03.100 --> 21:07.980
this is just so ridiculous how could you have seen all this back then you know i mean but

21:08.860 --> 21:12.940
now i just see it i see it all the time you're getting everything back to what we like to call

21:12.940 --> 21:18.620
normal and uh just really thrilled and excited about it and family medicine physician jamila

21:18.620 --> 21:25.740
taylor you don't know what to expect this is all very new to all of us but you know you take on

21:25.740 --> 21:30.460
the responsibility to care for individuals but why is the number wow did you hear that

21:31.500 --> 21:37.020
they cut her off because she was bullied listen to how she says you take on the responsibility

21:37.020 --> 21:44.380
to care for individuals so this is what they told her you can be an example you can you can

21:44.380 --> 21:49.660
set an example i mean you take responsibility you should show them by example that she's trying

21:49.660 --> 21:54.220
to rationalize in her head but she just got through saying that it's all brand new you don't know

21:54.220 --> 22:00.540
what to expect she was terrified and she was completely coerced into being on tv and being

22:00.540 --> 22:05.340
a leader listen to this this is horrible this is really bad wait throw them excited about it

22:05.340 --> 22:10.380
and family medicine physician jamila taylor you don't know what to expect this is all very

22:10.380 --> 22:17.580
new to all of us uh but you know you take on the responsibility to care for individuals but why

22:17.580 --> 22:22.460
is the number stopping at 10 and they didn't even let her spend finish like she was out of breath

22:22.460 --> 22:25.980
she was nervous she was giving them a statement and then they cut her off short

22:27.340 --> 22:33.340
after they coerced her into doing it no doubt why are these needles so freaking big holy cow what

22:33.420 --> 22:38.380
is that like an eight gauge and what is this blue thing this extra protector here

22:39.820 --> 22:44.380
super weird i guess so they can load it up and then they can close it over the top of it or

22:44.380 --> 22:50.700
something like that like looks like it's already loaded though i don't know that's weird it's

22:50.700 --> 22:55.420
you know new products though get new products if you needed to make new new stuff for the new

22:55.420 --> 23:00.620
countermeasure that's just more money spending even though the hospital was sitting nearly 2 000 doses

23:00.620 --> 23:05.180
this morning that's because the health officials at the hospital want to make sure everything goes

23:05.180 --> 23:11.420
smoothly with the vaccine unlike anything they've seen before and so they're taken out they took out

23:11.420 --> 23:16.380
10 people gave 10 people the shot the first day and then the next day they're going to do several

23:16.380 --> 23:21.020
hundred and that's their way of showing that we're being careful we're trying to make sure we're

23:21.020 --> 23:26.940
filling out all the forms and doing it all right um because it's no it's a new thing and so we're

23:26.940 --> 23:30.220
not going to teach everybody what what's happening or what we expect to happen

23:30.780 --> 23:34.940
we're just telling them it's a vaccine and it's new and they're taking it that's all they're doing

23:34.940 --> 23:39.660
it's there's no for informed consent here at all anything they've seen before there's just enough

23:39.660 --> 23:45.180
nuances to this that we want to ensure that we're being very thoughtful going through all of our

23:45.180 --> 23:50.940
processes tomorrow that number will jump up between three and four hundred our goal is to vaccinate

23:50.940 --> 23:57.660
all of our health care our physicians our nurses our associates our partners and even though the

23:57.660 --> 24:03.580
future seems bright that doesn't mean we need to let our guard down until we all get it we still

24:03.580 --> 24:10.860
need to do the things that work to slow the spread of coronavirus and while that number is expected

24:10.860 --> 24:16.700
to rise to three or four hundred starting tomorrow i'm told that in the days coming that number is

24:16.700 --> 24:21.980
going to increase day by day until it's available to the general public for now we are reporting

24:21.980 --> 24:25.820
alive in front of the hospital victor Williams hopeful all right victor

24:27.980 --> 24:34.460
victor Williams is uh yeah he's uh he's a he's a nice funny guy that that's that's um like it's

24:34.460 --> 24:41.260
almost like a saturday night live reporter wow i but good for him i hope he's having a great career

24:41.420 --> 24:48.300
um but that that was funny uh anyway i'm just going to keep moving on a year later

24:49.660 --> 24:55.020
when they went down the teens ambassadors are a group of diverse students from all over

24:55.020 --> 25:00.460
philadelphia and beyond who have come together to provide facts about the covid vaccine

25:01.020 --> 25:07.420
teen-to-teen conversations have a different impact than teen adult conversations just because

25:07.500 --> 25:12.540
we know how to communicate with with other teens because we're teens ourselves so we

25:12.540 --> 25:17.100
understand the communication for kids they're kind of afraid and nervous about the vaccination

25:17.100 --> 25:22.380
so what philateen vax is in to do is to kind of change that perspective it's more of a oh it's a

25:22.380 --> 25:28.460
fun thing to help protect our community and so by bringing in the vaccine we also bring the

25:28.460 --> 25:35.260
information and the party-like atmosphere to the communities reconnecting them it kind of shows

25:35.260 --> 25:40.780
that in our community there are teenagers who do care about the vaccination and we do care that

25:41.340 --> 25:46.700
this influences our health and our families and our community philateen vax definitely has made

25:46.700 --> 25:53.740
a positive impact within philadelphia because we're getting teenagers our age vaccinated spreading

25:53.740 --> 26:00.700
information and just providing a community that has a bigger uptake in vaccine i often ponder and

26:00.780 --> 26:06.940
think about the way that this has really helped the philateen vax ambassadors themselves i've grown

26:06.940 --> 26:14.460
in my knowledge of vaccines and the medical system and how it works personally i learned that like

26:14.460 --> 26:20.700
i really want to get more into public health and see that as a career in the future especially

26:20.700 --> 26:25.980
with helping my community i'll keep my mind open to new things now and actually approach

26:25.980 --> 26:31.340
people confidence because i know that we will walk relate to something they've been provided

26:31.340 --> 26:37.180
with so many opportunities to speak out and know what that feels like and to have a voice and to

26:37.180 --> 26:44.700
have a voice as a teen is really important so what's so frightening about this is the the idea that

26:44.700 --> 26:50.700
that they kind of soft land on a number of issues that in theory sound really good you know it's

26:50.700 --> 26:57.260
important for teens to have a voice of course it is you know the idea that they've

26:59.820 --> 27:04.780
they've taught these kids they've misled these children to believe that this is the kind of

27:04.780 --> 27:09.100
activism that they should be doing there there's no informed consent here are they

27:09.900 --> 27:13.500
are they going around teaching the immunology of transfection

27:15.100 --> 27:20.140
are they going around you know with a little clips of of peter coles saying that it does we

27:20.140 --> 27:27.420
can't make it stay anywhere in the body are they going around with with with videos of

27:27.420 --> 27:37.420
you know it's just brutal to me right now where we are and how lost my fellow adults are our fellow

27:37.420 --> 27:43.260
adults are it's hard for me really hard for me to have the parents pick up the boys after

27:44.620 --> 27:49.180
after basketball practice it's really hard for me to go to those games and see all those

27:49.180 --> 27:55.420
parents there and know that some portion of them is completely on board with this idea

27:56.300 --> 28:01.340
and the rest of them while they might not be on board with the covid things are still not aware

28:02.620 --> 28:08.540
of the dangers that HPV vaccine poses to their daughters and sons for example and many of them

28:08.540 --> 28:13.340
are probably going to give it to their children very soon in my schools because of the age of my kids

28:19.980 --> 28:23.820
i'm not really sure how we move forward ladies and gentlemen but i am in a very privileged

28:23.820 --> 28:31.580
position to be be able to give some part of my daily time to an organization like children's

28:31.580 --> 28:38.300
health defense and so it is with very trepidatious words that i say i would also like to

28:38.380 --> 28:50.540
to request support for my own work but i do feel like we're at a stage now where

28:51.500 --> 28:57.420
it may be that after helping children's health defense for a year that it will be better and

28:57.420 --> 29:05.100
stronger for everybody if i'm independent and of course i will still be plugging broken science

29:05.180 --> 29:10.540
initiative i will still be plugging CHD if i'm not working for them anymore because they're an

29:10.540 --> 29:15.900
organization of people with skin in the game you're not going to find that anywhere else

29:17.260 --> 29:24.540
not like it's CHD and that's why i believe no matter what else occurs no matter what people say

29:24.540 --> 29:30.460
about CHD doing this or doing that or speculating about what's wrong with them they are a group

29:30.460 --> 29:36.220
of beautiful people trying their best to push this message forward and also at the same time

29:36.220 --> 29:44.140
trying to assemble a tent which has room and capacity for all these other misfits that

29:45.900 --> 29:51.660
this this new system of governance just doesn't have room for because it's not about freedom

29:51.820 --> 30:01.580
and so i just as we move forward although i think it is important for us to keep doing the work

30:01.580 --> 30:07.020
that i'm we're doing with study halls and talking about the illusion of consensus and what people

30:07.020 --> 30:19.980
are doing we need to inspire more people to take more concrete action than this if this is what i'm

30:19.980 --> 30:26.300
supposed to do which is which is rant and teach then that's okay that i'm going to rant and teach

30:26.300 --> 30:35.020
but if if the next step is is i don't know who's got who's going to run for office if we don't run

30:35.020 --> 30:41.740
for office we need to get candidates in every state that are running for office on the basis

30:41.740 --> 30:47.580
on the basis of health freedom on the basis of preserving the doctor-patient relationship on the

30:47.580 --> 30:55.340
basis of reinstating or establishing for the first time strict liability for all pharmaceutical

30:55.340 --> 31:04.620
products including vaccines and so if you think about ways to get out of this ways to get out of

31:04.620 --> 31:10.460
this aren't making an underground network of doctors that can function in the background

31:10.700 --> 31:18.620
ways to get out of this are not to buy a bug-out cabin and stock up with food even though that may

31:18.620 --> 31:27.900
be a good plan it might be just as good a plan to organize your small town organize your small

31:27.900 --> 31:35.420
county with a group of like-minded people who understand the quandary that we're in and understand

31:35.500 --> 31:42.460
that burning down the house may not be the best plan when the roof is leaking even if the roof

31:42.460 --> 31:47.820
has been leaking for years even if they've been telling us that the roof isn't leaking and it is

31:47.820 --> 31:56.300
leaking and there's mold and everything if it's an old stone house like ours is it's not worth

31:56.300 --> 31:59.820
burning down it's not worth wrecking it's not worth throwing out the foundation

32:00.540 --> 32:04.940
it's worth repairing the masonry of this chimney

32:08.940 --> 32:11.260
it's worth putting a metal roof on the house

32:14.380 --> 32:18.780
and in this case it's definitely not worth taking america down to the studs

32:19.500 --> 32:25.100
and reinventing what our republic is it is taking it back ladies and gentlemen it is putting people

32:25.100 --> 32:30.700
in office that believe in the principles that we believe in and can clean up this mess

32:31.580 --> 32:36.300
will it be easy no is it a nearly impossible yes

32:39.260 --> 32:44.780
but if we don't try america will be controlled demolished from the outside and in

32:45.660 --> 32:48.060
the culture will be continued to be debased

32:48.220 --> 32:58.460
stars on the red carpet will continue to not dress up not look classy the media will continue

32:58.460 --> 33:02.780
to promote people who aren't classy who aren't a good example for your kids

33:07.420 --> 33:12.780
and continue to promote examples not of hard work but luck circumstance

33:13.100 --> 33:17.980
that's what we are facing here

33:20.940 --> 33:26.380
and that's why you see things like this where teenagers are empowered to brainwash other

33:26.380 --> 33:32.940
teenagers teenagers are empowered to coerce other teenagers into accepting things that they

33:32.940 --> 33:40.220
don't understand you like that is that good should i use that every once in a while or just keep myself

33:40.220 --> 33:43.660
tiny all the time if you like the tiny head i totally understand

33:46.700 --> 33:51.580
theater for more than 10 years and along the way earned three i wasn't sure whether to put this

33:51.580 --> 33:58.220
oh i wasn't sure whether to put this video in but i put it in because i wanted just for the

33:58.220 --> 34:03.340
people that are here watching and have been here all week do you remember the video of

34:03.340 --> 34:09.260
my fellow longhair uh the literature teacher who was talking about ovid ovid excuse me

34:09.260 --> 34:16.700
and ovid being this greek uh greek story or series of stories rather about metamorphosis

34:16.700 --> 34:21.180
and the the main theme that he was trying to get around or get off to his students

34:21.820 --> 34:29.820
was the idea that um order is imposed in its temporary according to ovid and in fact chaos

34:30.540 --> 34:37.980
is from which all things are are emerging and so from chaos order is imposed and

34:38.940 --> 34:45.820
i was just kind of thinking talking about how um this theme of metamorphosis is around all the time

34:45.820 --> 34:52.620
and in fact my friend matt crawford was one of the people was the person who cued me into the idea

34:52.700 --> 35:00.380
that ovid and covid um and covid might be a thing but i don't think that when matt and i were

35:00.380 --> 35:06.620
talking about this or when matt was explaining it to me that we were aware that when robert

35:06.620 --> 35:11.900
melon first came out that he was calling it covid and not covid and i only made that connection

35:11.900 --> 35:16.780
later on um so anyway i played you a video last week where the guy was explaining this and how

35:17.740 --> 35:24.620
uh then it might be that as the roman empire collapsed and created this chaos then new order

35:24.620 --> 35:32.940
emerges from it it might be kind of the theme of covid covid the idea that they needed to create

35:32.940 --> 35:39.340
chaos before they could change from this system based on nation states and sovereign currencies

35:39.340 --> 35:46.620
to changing to this global system where the nation state is subordinate or even non non

35:46.620 --> 35:53.660
meaningful and local currencies are also non meaningful because of the digital currencies that

35:53.660 --> 36:00.620
will come out and so in order to change this order what i made the argument was is a lot of

36:00.620 --> 36:06.780
philosophers will say that it will be better to create chaos and then a new order will be imposed

36:06.860 --> 36:13.180
on that chaos as opposed to starting with an old order and trying to rearrange it or modify it into

36:13.180 --> 36:20.860
a new one and so we're not really interested in having this new one so it's okay for us to think

36:20.860 --> 36:27.660
about the old one as a starting point before moving forward especially since the old one still

36:27.660 --> 36:34.460
basically exists right in front of our face they just don't want us to think it's useful anymore

36:35.340 --> 36:39.180
they don't want us to think it's salvageable anymore they want us to think that all of our

36:39.180 --> 36:43.660
kids have been raised with the bad morals and so it's fine if it all falls apart we'll be fine

36:44.460 --> 36:50.220
we'll pick up the pieces afterward that feels like the narrative they're selling to us now and

36:50.220 --> 36:55.580
it's starting to frighten me that a lot of americans on both sides the aisle are buying it and in fact

36:55.580 --> 37:01.260
what really frightens me is if trump gets elected a lot of americans would love to buy it like let's

37:01.260 --> 37:11.500
burn it all down for sure and so it really feels like a bonfire is being built stacked up

37:11.500 --> 37:17.580
getting ready to go and we have to make sure that it is a dam of information a dam of biology a

37:17.580 --> 37:24.380
dam of truth that gets that floods that bonfire before it ever gets lit theater for more than 10

37:24.380 --> 37:29.740
years and along the way so this free obi awards that's the highest honor this is uh

37:30.300 --> 37:35.660
tonight he shares his brief but spectacular take on love joy and the first this is what they do on

37:35.660 --> 37:41.420
pbs news hour they feature cultural icons and and influential humans and they give them a

37:42.540 --> 37:48.620
a brief but the spectacular moment when they can express themselves about their art and many times

37:48.620 --> 37:58.780
of course it's it's one of these hyper politically correct people who in this case

37:59.180 --> 38:08.460
um who's sexual orientation gender whatever jewelry nail polish

38:14.540 --> 38:19.180
and then what he says and i just i think it's just so i just strikes me i don't know

38:20.380 --> 38:24.940
you know it's hard for you hard to broach this subject without immediately being so easily

38:24.940 --> 38:33.420
classified as a bigot or whatever but i just want you to notice for what it is because this is

38:33.420 --> 38:40.140
never just random because they're sending this out to millions of people this is the

38:41.340 --> 38:47.260
the whitest bread news there is and i mean that from the from the generic kitchen perspective not

38:47.260 --> 38:54.860
from the race perspective but like you know it's the generic sugar the generic bread the

38:54.860 --> 39:02.940
generic cheese and and black and white dishes and a black and white floor it's it's exactly what

39:05.820 --> 39:14.140
it's the cartoon narrative of america and so if you see this what you're basically seeing is what the

39:14.140 --> 39:21.020
ideal perspective from the ruling class perspective would be for us to have let me say that again

39:22.460 --> 39:30.220
in the ideal for the ruling class we would buy every single thing that pbs has got selling now i

39:30.220 --> 39:37.100
understand that we don't buy it right but we don't buy it because the limited spectrum of debate is

39:37.100 --> 39:43.500
actually just to the left and just to the right of it and there are very loud voices on the left

39:43.500 --> 39:48.940
and on the right that yell about it and then this is the one in the middle that is pretending to be

39:48.940 --> 39:58.060
calm cool and collected and listen to both of those signs and so the presuppositions of the state

39:58.060 --> 40:03.420
and the narrative that the state wants to preserve are perfectly represented on the pbs news hour

40:04.860 --> 40:11.660
so as nauseating as it is to watch for me and i i take this one for us for the team and so if

40:11.660 --> 40:17.340
there's any reason to donate to my work donate because i put hours into watching the pbs news

40:17.340 --> 40:25.820
hour so that i can get this this information out to this idea of what they're trying to send to

40:25.820 --> 40:31.420
you so that the scooby-doo can be brought into sharp focus and i'm totally being sarcastic here

40:31.420 --> 40:39.500
so don't take me serious when i say this stuff listen to this suit of happiness i am a creative

40:40.220 --> 40:45.340
a doula is a person who actually helps to birth the ideas the child the playwright or the director

40:45.340 --> 40:50.060
or the mother and the father and i'm helping them to birth that thing so the world can see it and the

40:50.060 --> 40:58.540
world can be changed by it my work at the national black theater is a 50-year-old organization i've

40:58.540 --> 41:04.540
been there for about 11 years we have been able to dream up and to believe into 50-year-old organizations

41:04.540 --> 41:20.140
my work at the national black theater is a 50-year-old organization i've been there for about 11 years

41:20.140 --> 41:25.980
we have been able to dream up and to believe into dr barber and tears original vision which was

41:25.980 --> 41:30.540
the creative space where people can live serve and work and we use our theory of change as a way

41:30.540 --> 41:35.420
in which to make that happen which is black liberation plus art plus placemaking equals the

41:35.420 --> 41:40.220
conditions for humans to be transformed if we imagine ourselves as butterflies what is possible

41:40.220 --> 41:45.260
if we imagine ourselves to be butterflies what is possible who are we then if we imagine ourselves

41:45.260 --> 41:52.620
to be unfettered and unreleased from that husk imagining that maybe three years was a cocoon for

41:52.620 --> 41:58.300
us three years was an imagination for us to be able to see witness and become something new

41:58.380 --> 42:04.140
who did you become when i think about what it means to be full body three years was a

42:04.140 --> 42:12.540
metamorphosis for us three years has changed us three years who did you become in these three

42:12.540 --> 42:21.580
years you became a slave a mental slave is what you became a coward a weakling without a voice a

42:21.580 --> 42:26.780
person without principles is what a lot of people became that's what i think now see i could have

42:26.780 --> 42:30.460
used this but i was afraid if i had said those words with my big head then it would have been

42:30.460 --> 42:37.900
very scary so i just kept myself little okay here we go i didn't fully present i really have a

42:37.900 --> 42:43.500
conversation with how are we um reckoning with some of the western traditions that have actually

42:43.500 --> 42:49.420
allowed us to commodify ourselves instead of seeing ourselves as really powerful beings everything

42:49.420 --> 42:55.100
around us everything that we're able to cultivate is of our own doing and is our own becoming you

42:55.100 --> 43:01.420
are the cultivation of wisdom wrapped in flesh you are the cultivation of possibility made real

43:02.140 --> 43:07.500
in every breath that you get to take something is shifting inside this planet futures are being

43:07.500 --> 43:11.980
written that we have never even known and those futures that are being written is what i need

43:11.980 --> 43:17.340
is what our future need is what our children need i was crafted from that kind of technology

43:17.340 --> 43:23.660
that my ancestors ancestors of slaves ancestors of people who are born into fortitude also ancestors

43:23.660 --> 43:29.500
who are kings and queens but those ancestors actually said one day there would be a jonathan and i'm

43:29.500 --> 43:35.660
going to show up for him in this moment i'm going to wrap my words with joy and from that joy i

43:35.660 --> 43:41.820
love for something magical to show up that is what i'm asking for you to understand that your presence

43:41.820 --> 43:48.140
right here is a gift that's really what i mean about the power of presence the ability to share

43:48.140 --> 43:53.500
love and to show love to any and everything that you understand that there is only good in the

43:53.500 --> 43:58.460
world and that through that good you're radically transformed and transformation doesn't mean that

43:58.460 --> 44:04.620
it's always comfortable it means you live in the discomfort of your growth remember that breath

44:04.620 --> 44:12.860
was a gift the next one is a gift energy turned into manifesting something real what

44:12.860 --> 44:18.140
realness will you do with the time you have with the seconds that you're given

44:21.500 --> 44:28.140
my name is jonathan mccory and this is my brief but spectacular take on love joy and the pursuit

44:28.140 --> 44:34.700
of happiness now you can have a very negative idea of this and think that you know he's he's

44:34.700 --> 44:42.620
doing a performance for them he works for them um you can also just think of it as a guy who is just

44:42.620 --> 44:49.740
trying to be himself and is a very enthusiastic creator of theater and was asked to do a brief

44:49.740 --> 44:56.620
spectacular moment on pbs news hour and this is what come out of it but i just have a hard time

44:56.620 --> 45:03.260
with that at this stage and you heard it as well as i did i saw somebody mentioned in the chat in

45:03.260 --> 45:10.700
the chat uh um hitari mama mentioned it in the chat that he said technology i'm not i'm made

45:10.700 --> 45:17.180
of the same technology these are not mistakes these are not subtle choices of words these are

45:17.180 --> 45:26.140
real choices of words the inversion of the humbleness to the universe as opposed to i am i am i am i

45:26.140 --> 45:35.020
am um is is really antithetical to everything that i grew up with antithetical to all the humility

45:35.020 --> 45:41.180
that i have for my very limited time and and what i can possibly do with it

45:43.660 --> 45:50.380
and in a way you know we've gone from imagining ourselves to be to being

45:51.500 --> 45:58.060
having a career and being a good parent to every single one of us having to imagine we could change

45:58.060 --> 46:03.740
the world that every breath we take the universe is breathing with us

46:05.500 --> 46:11.340
not that we are part of this larger piece but this piece is a larger part of us that we are we are

46:11.340 --> 46:18.220
all it matters even if that's not really what he means that's definitely what he said

46:20.540 --> 46:22.380
and there was no god ever mentioned

46:23.260 --> 46:27.660
that's what i hear

46:31.020 --> 46:36.940
and a lot of what i don't hear and that's what pbs news hour is doing for us right now that's

46:36.940 --> 46:42.060
what they're doing that's the message that they're sending out at the middle so at the extreme

46:43.100 --> 46:47.340
there might be something okay and at the extreme there might feel like there's something okay for

46:47.340 --> 46:53.580
both people both sides both opinions but even those extremes are still safe

46:55.820 --> 47:03.420
those extremes are still safe and i think you will find that the extremes of christianity in

47:03.420 --> 47:09.900
america that are actually promoted that are actually numerically successful

47:10.620 --> 47:18.780
that's probably something very wrong with them

47:21.740 --> 47:29.900
and i've had a lifetime of exploring that possibility and i know that even extremely large

47:30.460 --> 47:37.340
extremely successful on the outside churches like like willow creek in chicago

47:38.140 --> 47:41.500
can have at the heart of them people who are liars

47:43.900 --> 47:50.780
and it's unfortunate but that's how this debate has been controlled for the last

47:51.820 --> 47:58.620
20 or 30 years it's not just the scientists it's not just the army and the navy the air force

47:58.620 --> 48:05.020
and marines it's not just the politicians it's also the very successful pastors

48:05.820 --> 48:11.660
the tv evangelists these are all people that have been contacted

48:14.380 --> 48:18.300
i assure you we are under attack ladies and gentlemen

48:19.260 --> 48:26.140
and a long standing organized attack to debase america to control the militia

48:28.860 --> 48:33.900
and the easy out is to allow it to happen the easy out is to take the excuse that this can't

48:33.980 --> 48:37.740
be fixed that this is beyond repair that my neighbors are idiots

48:38.700 --> 48:43.420
that's exactly what these people want us to think because that's exactly how america falls apart

48:46.860 --> 48:48.460
so let's watch some twib for fun

48:50.060 --> 48:55.180
and then uh oh my gosh i have 10 minutes and this is so long this is so long um

48:56.860 --> 48:59.420
i don't know what to do other than to go forward here we go

48:59.500 --> 49:04.780
first is an article in science by joselyn kizer they're going to do three articles

49:04.780 --> 49:10.380
approves ban on gain of fun the first article is about the ban of function of gain of

49:10.380 --> 49:17.420
the ban of gain of function research representatives now they banned research federal funding for

49:17.980 --> 49:22.700
gain of function research that modifies risky pathogens in ways that can make them more harmful

49:22.700 --> 49:28.860
to people and this may not become law because the senate has to vote on it

49:29.660 --> 49:35.820
as you know the senate is mildly democratic so i don't know why this should be a politicized

49:35.820 --> 49:39.340
issue at all it should be a scientific issue because because why not because everything's a

49:39.340 --> 49:44.860
politicized issue now that's exactly what people are up in a rage about everything the best world

49:44.860 --> 49:50.300
yeah allen do you remember as silomar when the scientists decided to i don't remember it but i

49:50.300 --> 49:54.860
certainly have read about it yeah they decided hey you know this recombinant dna stuff it could

49:55.020 --> 50:01.580
be dangerous let's take a pause and talk about it so they did and that's what should be done here

50:01.580 --> 50:07.340
so what is it notably it notably it turned out to be not dangerous yeah turn out not to be dangerous

50:08.060 --> 50:15.020
and one of the experiments they cite here is the influenza h5n1 work of fushein kauoka of the

50:15.020 --> 50:21.500
2015ish i think where they passage the virus so it became transmissible in the air among ferrets

50:22.220 --> 50:24.940
which they cite is horribly dangerous and

50:26.780 --> 50:32.060
neglect the fact that it's we learned a lot from it it was done safely under bsl-3 conditions

50:33.020 --> 50:38.620
i'd like to make a proposal that we changed the name of that a branch of government to the house

50:38.620 --> 50:44.380
of misrepresentation i don't know why they're getting involved i bet most of them don't even

50:44.380 --> 50:48.620
understand what gain of function that's the point that is but gain of function is giving a new

50:48.620 --> 50:54.300
property to any kind of organism any kind not just viruses it doesn't have to be something that

50:54.300 --> 51:00.140
you think might be nasty it could be putting a new enzyme into a yeast so it makes flavorful

51:00.140 --> 51:05.580
beer or something like that it just a new function maybe with enough education they can have gain

51:05.580 --> 51:13.900
of function for themselves the thing that's um particularly um unfortunate about this

51:14.540 --> 51:22.460
is that it this bill also contains other it has amendments one would ban gain of function studies

51:22.460 --> 51:28.620
at the the hamlet the laboratory in hamilton montana the nich lab all right and the third

51:28.620 --> 51:33.340
amendment would cut three point seven million from the nich director's office budget because it gave

51:33.340 --> 51:39.660
a grant for that amount to eco health alliance so you may remember trump cut eco health alliance

51:39.660 --> 51:45.260
grant and so recently the director of nih restored it so now they're going to cut that money away

51:45.260 --> 51:51.020
from them because they said you shouldn't have done that it's all punitive yes and and the other

51:51.020 --> 51:57.980
thing to note is that this amendment is different than some other um bills on this because it's a

51:57.980 --> 52:04.140
total ban instead of allowing for review um if somebody wants to you know propose something and

52:04.140 --> 52:08.380
get it reviewed and say why it could be useful this is just nope not allowed in any way and this

52:08.380 --> 52:16.460
whole thing is just obviously a rush job political patch uh they don't define potential pandemic

52:16.460 --> 52:25.100
pathogen mm-hmm which could be anything right you're working with e coli could that be a pandemic

52:25.100 --> 52:33.900
pathogen again here what we're dealing with is a controlled spectrum of debate a a limited spectrum

52:34.060 --> 52:40.460
debate and a very lively discussion within it's not very lively i thought i recorded it at 1.5

52:40.460 --> 52:49.180
speed it's possible that this is 1.5 speed but anyway the idea is here that these people are one half

52:49.180 --> 52:54.620
of the debate the other half of the debate are people saying that this is definitely a lab leak

52:54.620 --> 53:00.140
maybe even it's a bio weapon maybe it's a combination of bio weapons

53:03.740 --> 53:11.420
and that is the scooby-doo because if you accept that as a mystery that you have to solve a debate

53:11.420 --> 53:16.620
that you have to listen to and understand and on take a side on then you've accepted their

53:16.620 --> 53:23.260
monsters that's it the monsters are real and you've decided to decide which and who's responsible

53:23.260 --> 53:28.620
for the monster that's it that's the whole trick it's not even that complicated

53:29.740 --> 53:36.700
that's the beauty of it and they gained this thing out over several different exercises that

53:36.700 --> 53:44.140
ended and culminated in event 201 that our own director of intelligence sat at

53:45.020 --> 53:52.060
that the oh they're a director of the cdc of china sat at

53:54.300 --> 54:00.540
i mean it's all right there in front of you now he can't say that you weren't warned

54:02.620 --> 54:04.380
you can't say that you haven't been told

54:06.780 --> 54:11.580
and over the next month or so you're we're going to be able to tell people that there

54:11.660 --> 54:15.500
there you can't say that there weren't videos that could have helped you understand it

54:18.860 --> 54:21.340
we're not going to be doing twitter spaces so we can

54:21.980 --> 54:27.340
teach people this stuff we're going to be making slide decks and then we're going to be talking

54:27.340 --> 54:31.660
about the slide decks so that people understand them they're going to be annotated well enough

54:31.660 --> 54:34.860
they're going to be citing papers that we've talked about for three years

54:37.020 --> 54:40.860
and we're going to start to circulate this stuff via email to all of our friends and

54:40.860 --> 54:45.260
they're going to send it to their friends and eventually everybody on earth is going to have a

54:45.260 --> 54:59.100
copy of basic immunology 101 and a basic infectious clones hypothesis it's not going to be that

54:59.100 --> 55:06.620
hard i'm just surprised somebody else didn't write it up by now again because people like

55:06.700 --> 55:10.780
brandy vaughn have been out there for decades some of them have been killed like her

55:12.700 --> 55:18.220
but the information has been out there the illusion of consensus has been

55:18.220 --> 55:21.260
congeiliating over our eyes for decades

55:25.500 --> 55:29.260
oh allen allen allen allen allen

55:30.140 --> 55:32.540
well maybe you know

55:33.580 --> 55:35.740
influencer just say making an influencer

55:35.740 --> 55:42.300
influencer gosh yeah we've got historic pandemics of that but any any virus um any

55:42.860 --> 55:47.580
transmissible pathogen of any kind could be potential pandemic

55:49.900 --> 55:54.060
they also have an amendment that would curb diversity so now

55:54.700 --> 55:58.700
please tell me you understood what he just said

55:58.700 --> 56:05.580
we've gone from it being required for the last three years to have a fear and cleavage site

56:06.300 --> 56:11.500
in order to make it super hyper transmissible like no virus we've ever seen in the history of

56:11.500 --> 56:21.420
of mankind to allen here saying that any transmissible pathogen is a potential pandemic

56:21.420 --> 56:30.300
any any transmissible pathogen is a potential pandemic well that's impressive

56:33.180 --> 56:40.300
that's impressive i mean man oh man first yes and NIH funded research on topics like gender

56:40.300 --> 56:45.900
affirming care i mean this is just this is part of this whole idiotic culture wars

56:46.540 --> 56:50.700
campaign talking point that's been just yeah

56:53.020 --> 57:00.780
anyway this is highly um ill advised because uh as i said i i think it's partially in in

57:00.780 --> 57:05.180
retribution for tony fauci telling rann paul he didn't know what he was talking about which is true

57:05.180 --> 57:09.180
i would say when it comes to gain a function every member of the house probably doesn't know

57:09.180 --> 57:15.820
anything about it someone told them they should vote against this and uh they did but i suppose

57:15.820 --> 57:22.220
the senate will not vote for it so i'm not sure the scientific community even has a good grip

57:22.220 --> 57:29.420
on a definition for a good question or for uh potentially potential pandemic pathogen yeah right

57:29.420 --> 57:34.380
i mean that that's that's one of the one of the problems here is that all those concepts are

57:34.380 --> 57:40.940
pretty slippery and it's not because one of the problems is is that the idea of a pandemic where

57:41.020 --> 57:45.500
something can go around the globe because it's it can it can it can replicate

57:46.460 --> 57:52.540
is something that even the best insect can't do very fast the best insect can't do it without a

57:52.540 --> 58:01.660
lot of help from boats and stuff and yet somehow or another viruses boy oh boy they can this one

58:01.660 --> 58:09.020
this one this one virus could go from a point release in a market in luhan and coat the globe

58:09.020 --> 58:16.540
with itself i mean it's in every every other house on my street right every other house on

58:16.540 --> 58:24.940
your street and in 2019 it was in none of those houses do you understand that that that's the

58:24.940 --> 58:32.060
concept here that these guys seem to think is just a natural yeah that's sure that works

58:32.940 --> 58:38.460
they are attributing superpowers to something that's not even a pattern integrity

58:41.100 --> 58:50.700
and and insects can move fast breed fast they're very adaptable they eat lots of stuff and yet

58:50.700 --> 59:00.700
insects can't cover the globe in themselves in oh but that's because they don't have a niche

59:00.780 --> 59:07.660
the niches are all taken up and we were talking about niches for viruses the other week and these

59:07.660 --> 59:12.620
guys were arguing about the fact that you really can't call them niches because they're not species

59:12.620 --> 59:18.060
but they still haven't understood that the whole concept of a virus and the way that we

59:18.060 --> 59:24.940
talk about them is essentially treating them as pattern integrates treating them as living things

59:24.940 --> 59:35.740
with the capacity to engage in behavior and have emergent properties that we have here

59:35.740 --> 59:42.380
to for only ascribe to pattern integrates pattern integrity is being things that use energy

59:42.380 --> 59:48.780
and material to maintain a form they have homeostatic homeostatic mechanisms

59:49.020 --> 59:56.460
they can be said to engage in homeostasis there's no homeostasis in an RNA wrapped in

59:56.460 --> 01:00:04.300
lipoproteins and there's no pandemic potential in them

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:16.620
we have to wake people up to this absolute illusion and these people may never wake up

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.100
they may never understand it even if I had them each on my show and we talked about it

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.540
they may not quite get it but some of them might that girl in the corner might get it this lady

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:34.380
right here might get it she just did her postdoc in in Vincent's lab she's just bamboozled by her

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:40.220
by her PhD supervisor this guy might get it this is the guy who didn't and didn't agree with the niches

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:50.300
maybe I need to be at about 80 instead of 90 or 100 like that it's a really big hand and if I

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.380
was a little bit smaller I could point a little better at all of them anyway I'm going to let them

01:00:54.380 --> 01:01:00.300
go they have more to say there's more to say I mean it's just because of the limits of the science

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:06.140
really because you can't you can't predict what's going on here and that's that's one of the reasons

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:14.220
that it in my mind at least makes most sense to have some process by which from the ground up

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.540
and this is one of the things that's suggested in some of these things from the ground up these

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.300
things can be considered on a case-by-case basis by people who know what's going on

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:31.980
I'm glad to see some information from ASM against this year I mean this is clearly clearly a job

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:38.220
for the National Academy of Sciences they should be advising Congress on these issues and

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.340
they're not even seeking their advice and that's that's wrong also because they're

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.300
they're not turning over every stone before they make decisions they're not seeking their advice

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.980
because they don't want data right they don't want us yes that's right this is not about facts

01:01:53.980 --> 01:02:02.700
there would be nice to have a meeting and of scientists and talk about this exactly and maybe

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:08.780
even some people who do risk assessment right you throw them in there and they could talk about

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:15.820
it would be very useful instead of having politicians make these edicts I've probably said this before

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:23.900
but this when I consider this it reminds me of when I actually it wasn't when I first joined

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:30.860
now it was when I renewed my certification that's the National Association of Underwater

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:38.060
Instructors I think yeah yeah that's a scuba diving organization and like the first thing

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:43.740
out of the instructors it's not instructors who are behind on their mortgage the first thing

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:51.420
out of the instructors mouth was listen we have a number of safety protocols and sort of

01:02:52.620 --> 01:03:00.460
we have our own self-regulatory process he said it's everybody's obligation to pay close

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:06.220
attention to this stuff because if we don't regulate ourselves the government will and that

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:13.820
will be addressed there's no pun intended in regularly I hope yeah good fix it it might be

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:19.900
good here if you were able to put in that paper that was in the three journals at the same time

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:26.620
the ASM journals yeah that talked about that gain of function research and had that really

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:35.100
important table that yes listed examples of the kinds of benefits to human kind and

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:42.700
agricultural good idea animals and plants from we'll put that in so-called gain of function research

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.780
okay all right next thing is a chronic wasting disease here we go

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:59.100
which is a disease is a prion disease of what is servants servants deer elk in a moose right

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:07.180
yes and a prion disease is a neurological disease where a protein that you have in you

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:12.540
and this goes for deer as well start to the misfold and you get a neurological generation

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:17.500
which is ultimately fatal and a number of years ago it started to be picked up in deer a number

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:27.020
of animals have it humans do and others mink and many other sheep now deer and this one is in

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:33.900
Tennessee and they have a lot of cases they they basically take deer that have been harvested

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:44.540
for hunting and they look for a presence of the prion and last year they tested 20,762 samples

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:52.860
and 813 were positive so the concern hearing yes go ahead go ahead

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.460
no right so no we're getting we're getting to this year now you know the concern is that it

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.780
would spread from deer so the first question that comes to mind is what's the test

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:09.500
what does the test do they use do they sequence for it are they have a lysotest for it is it

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.100
you know antibodies what are they looking for because supposedly one particle

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:22.540
just one particles enough supposedly that's how prions work i heard it from an expert the other

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:29.180
night actually two experts the other night said that it's just one particle one particle is enough

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:35.980
and it's over game over dominoes falling so i really wonder what the test is and how

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:41.500
how certain they can really be that they found it given the test 800 were positive

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:46.700
interesting interesting interesting stuff here interesting stuff

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:54.380
the other animals right humans like to eat deer i understand they hunt them and the dressing

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:59.020
in the field how do the deer catch it the people who hunt deer and dress them in the field

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:04.300
if they don't know that the deer so the deer the deer appear to catch it from each other each

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.420
other yes but where they got it to start with is another question that's another question and this

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:15.420
is an this is an issue with prion diseases in general because these are they're not viruses

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:20.700
just to be clear but virologists have ended up kind of with prions in our field because nobody

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:28.700
else wanted them and so they're they're proteins and they are naturally occurring proteins of course

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:35.340
that are often doing essential functions but under certain circumstances one of them can

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:41.660
misfold and if you you know studied virology or listened any infants and selectures you you know

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:46.700
that the folded shape of a protein is very important but what's different about prion proteins is that

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:53.820
they have a misfolded configuration that can happen that then allows that misfolded protein

01:06:53.820 --> 01:07:02.780
to catalyze a transition in other proteins one thing that just came to mind

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.620
yeah you got to just be a little smaller i think but one thing that just came to mind which i

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:13.340
find very interesting is that it supposedly google has figured out how all the proteins fold

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:19.180
they have this program you know that had that three-dimensional thing flying over my head with

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:23.020
all those proteins that was actually from some google fold program where they were

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.620
announced earlier this year that they had actually figured out how all proteins fold they have this

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:34.780
new ai that can do it so then my assumption would be that that ai can easily explain

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:42.220
how prions work and exactly what structures in proteins can result in the catalytic misfolding

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:48.380
of other proteins around them it should be very obvious i mean if they have an ai that's capable

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:54.700
of folding any and telling you what any tertiary sequence of a of a protein is given its amino

01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:01.500
acid list then i can't imagine that with this kind of computing power this kind of a breakthrough

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:07.020
that they can't figure out how given that they have the sequence of these things

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:12.140
that they can't put that sequence in this folding program and find out how they fold together folding

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:17.660
folders and make those folding folders fold the wrong way so that instead of folding and folding

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:22.460
and working they fold and then they fold up other things that get f'd up

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:32.940
so these are real real biologists they're all academic biologists but none of them seem to be

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:38.700
able to really take this problem and work it to its final end to where you can get some useful

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:45.820
thinking done i don't really get it how can you be a biologist and not have this gigantic

01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.140
battleship size question in your head about weight how does this work

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:56.220
and since we know all this stuff about how proteins fold why can't you explain it to me

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:05.020
why does it stop with little photos or little cartoons of alpha helix and beta pleated sheets

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:10.460
and then some hand waving about how yeah these sequences boy they can go they can go bananas you

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:14.780
know like when you put three rubic cubes together and then they all solve themselves

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.980
well if you put them on the right colors that's what happens

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.500
you know some of the rubic cubes are magnetic so that can work or you know the rubic snake

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:28.220
those things those rubic snakes boy if you put them in the box the right way you would get them

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.460
out and they would all be folded the same sitting right next to each other it was pretty cool

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:41.660
they have no mechanism they have no explanation despite all of our structural protein knowledge

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:49.740
they have no data to explain to you a mechanism by which this occurs other than your intuition

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:55.660
that this makes sense that sometimes proteins fold incorrectly and sometimes they fold incorrectly

01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:01.420
and it causes other proteins to fold incorrectly you know like when one folding chair causes another

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:12.860
folding chair to break and they all break it doesn't really really make sense yet but i'm sure

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:19.260
someday they'll they'll use google fold to figure out how beta pleated sheets and alpha helices can

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:25.660
result in some kind of pseudo three-dimensional domino effect where one misfolded protein can

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.300
cause a regularly folded protein to go bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla now everybody's

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:36.380
misfolded darn it that's too bad that happened 20 amino acids and we're all screwed darn it

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:50.060
to misfold them like a 3d chain reaction of misfoldings yeah yeah yeah um and these will

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:57.100
often they'll they'll polymerize into tendrils like in the nervous tissue uh which is characteristic

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:02.140
of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's but in this case it's a pathogenic protein that's

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.620
making these polymers of something that should be going about its normal function but now it's

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.900
making these threads that are damaging the neurons and you get all these various sequelae

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:20.300
med cal disease bse scrapian sheet what is the core core in trisalt yachos kuru

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.340
so all these different diseases have all different variations of the same protein

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:33.740
misfolding but they still can't tell us how it works they're not showing us no papers out there

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.860
show us a picture of the different proteins and what's parallel with them what's what's in common

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.460
with all these these proteins that are causing all these troubles

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:49.740
can we see a crystallization of these proteins or maybe we can use a computer model of x-ray

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:56.940
crystallography because roberm loans got one of those and he modeled the entire pharmaceutical

01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:04.220
library of the fda of all approved products with that computer model of x-ray crystallography so

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:11.420
i'm sure he could model a few hundred a few what 20 amino acids and show you how that 20 amino

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:21.420
acids can magically make another 20 amino acids misfold the proposition

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:29.500
is a cartoon their understanding is a cartoon their explanation is a cartoon so how can we be

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:39.260
led to believe this cartoon is real are there sick deer yes there are has any human ever caught

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:51.900
this disease from a deer no they haven't hmm interesting it's interesting interesting days

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:57.260
here ladies and gentlemen because there's a lot of interesting parallel double downs that

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:03.580
shouldn't be parallel that was some eating brain yeah yeah yeah brain so that's why i'm asking

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:09.100
about deer they're not they're not meeting they're not eating brains but the the prions are in

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:15.980
other parts of the body including apparently they can be detected in the deer urine yep

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.700
probably and that's a major scent cue for deer so they're marking their territory they're sniffing

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:28.300
their territory they're getting and the prions are very these um cw prions are very durable in the

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:32.860
environment sure they're very durable in the environment and they're peeing all over your

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:38.540
backyard so if your kids go out in the yard they could get these prions all over them and they're

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:45.100
very durable in the environment i mean not like RNA that just did just you know gets degraded by

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:52.380
RNases and and UV light these proteins are durable in the environment and they're in deer urine

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.500
something about this cartoon seems to be incongruent with our reality

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.820
but they're going to tell the story of the cartoon anyway

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.460
and they're going to mislead our children with the cartoon anyway

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.860
because that's the way they govern us with cartoons

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:25.820
so one of the control measures that they implement in places with seed actually i think this is

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:32.700
probably most places now um is uh traditionally deer hunters have used deer urine as a lure

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.100
so they'll buy bottles of deer urine and and dribble it on some trees and then you know deer

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:45.660
will come and check it out um but uh many states now regulate this and tennessee is among them

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:53.900
um so that you can you can only use synthetic lures or deer urine that's been produced i think

01:14:53.900 --> 01:15:00.060
it has to be produced in the state from a certified facility that does all sorts of tests to make

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:06.300
sure that they don't have the cwd prion in it they also don't want you to put out food and salt licks

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:13.020
which is i presume to interrupt transmission they don't want you to put out food and salt licks

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:20.780
because that's cheating that's like being shitty to the deer that's why i mean come on this is just

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:27.500
crazy we're talking about oh my goodness this is so funny coming from Wisconsin it's just really

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.340
hard to hear people talk about deer hunting when they don't know what they're talking about i mean

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:37.900
it's just sad oh yeah it could have started in deer as a spontaneous misfolding many years ago

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:44.860
in one deer and then it spread from deer to deer ha from deer to deer from one deer over many years

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:54.140
that's how it happened i'm sure yes just you know that darn joker card got in my deck and then

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:59.740
more joker cards got out of my deck and got in your deck and then those joker cards multiplied

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:04.940
and got into other people's deck and before you knew it there was joker cards in every deer urine

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:16.220
it's just such a ridiculous story that attributes a pattern integrity's attributes to a protein

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.380
try

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:30.940
it's just very very frustrating i think we're finally here though so you have to see it as a

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:38.700
happy day has a happy time because we've made progress with being able to explain what's wrong

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:45.900
with this mythology and what's wrong with it is that we continually are being baited into applying

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:51.420
biological principles that heretofore have only been applied to patterned

01:16:51.420 --> 01:17:00.460
integrity's that can be described as species that actually evolve through selective pressure

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:07.500
and selection at least that's what we think and so we've come up with all these

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:18.780
descriptive terms which identify phenomenon that seem to be emergent in these pattern

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:25.020
integrity's we've learned a lot from birds we've learned a lot from monkeys we've learned a lot

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:30.140
from the phylogenies of animals that we've tried to assemble based on their genetic relations

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.220
to one another

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:44.300
and those principles of evolution and phylogeny have been applied to viruses without necessarily

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:52.380
establishing that they are patterned integrity's worthy of that description even the very thought

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:59.100
that these are phylogenetically descended from one ancestor in Wuhan is an imposed mythology

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:07.580
it is an imposed mythology that this illusion of consensus from the craziest people on the internet

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:16.060
in March 2020 to the most mainstream people on the internet in 2020 has been preserved for four years

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:25.340
this idea that we can think of viruses mostly as alive mostly as evolving mostly as pathogens

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.820
mostly as pathogens even though all of those attributes are reserved for patterned

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:35.580
integrity's all of those concepts have been heretofore only applied to patterned integrity's

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.820
and these virologists these molecular biologists have inverted our thinking

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:46.140
to thinking that something that is a molecule wrapped in other molecules is a patterned integrity

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:53.340
endowed with something sacred and it's not whereas a mouse

01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:02.540
or let's use a rat in your backyard as nasty a vermin it is it's a patterned integrity

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:09.420
that's why putting the trays of poison out in the backyard don't quite get rid of all of them

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:18.140
because they're patterned integrity's it's not paint you can't just clean it up you can't just

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:25.260
use alcohol and wipe the bench and now it's clean but you can do that with viruses yep you can

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:37.980
because it might be that viruses are not patterned integrity's and i think that's where we are

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:46.140
and prions are not patterned integrity's so it is impossible to explain their spread

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:52.140
as starting from a single animal where it just was an event where some protein folded badly

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:59.340
if that was the case then one protein folding badly 50,000 years ago would have wiped out

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:08.220
in the entire the entire branch that we call mammals are you kidding me let's just rewind

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:15.740
time a little bit and think about this as a possibility apparently all that has always existed because

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:21.820
we didn't find the prion protein for the first time in humans or in deer or in this contemporary

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:31.020
time these guys all must believe in the dogma of biology that we've been using dna and rna and

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:37.420
proteins for millions of years so then that means prions have been around for millions of years

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:43.340
which means that at any point in time previous to this one the misfolding of a protein could

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:51.020
have led to a domino effect which wiped out the whole freaking mammalian branch of life

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.100
but it didn't

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.100
these people just are claiming that they understand phenomenon that they can barely even describe

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:07.980
succinctly they they're claiming that they understand biological phenomenon and all the

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.940
implications of them and all the various ways of controlling them when they can't even describe

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:20.220
the mechanism by which that phenomenon works a plausible one even just a bunch of hand waving

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:27.260
about how a protein can misfold and cause other proteins to misfold like you know sometimes when

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:33.420
that occasionally that one sock folds itself in the laundry and then all the laundry comes out

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:39.180
folded you know sometimes that happens it's just not very often but sometimes a shirt will fold

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:45.660
itself and because it folded itself all the other laundry will fold itself you know how entropy

01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:46.940
works

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:55.820
unbelievable and the concern is spreading to other animals including humans there haven't been any

01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:02.780
human cases yet oh you know you have to be careful and also to cows who would graze in a pasture

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:09.260
where deer go in they've shown that prions in the soil can be taken up with the plant roots and

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:15.820
go up to the leaves and they're infectious there so theoretically a cow could lick it and acquire

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:22.540
them so a lot of and they're infectious there but what does that mean infectious there when nobody's

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:29.660
had one no animal no human has gotten it from the deer so how is it infectious there if prions

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.540
from the soil can go up into plants and get into the cows what is he talking about

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:46.060
all our children would be dead if this was true our children wouldn't even exist right now if

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:54.540
this was true or we're going on a slow roll and we're in the midst of the extinction of the mammals

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:58.780
I guess it's just a matter of time it just takes one

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:08.140
concerns here and then isn't some of that related to how scrappy happens in a lot of sheep

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:18.700
yeah sheep maybe sheep gets scrappy and I thought it could be due to sort of some of the contamination

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:26.140
in the pasture that would make sense because they also are you know herbivores and of course

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:35.100
since we're talking about sheep cows in the UK were fed ground up sheep and they got prions

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:40.700
from the sheep and that started the mad cow disease outbreak which spilled over into people

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:48.620
wait burgers because you can't inactivate these by cooking or anything very difficult to inactivate

01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:55.900
so the the the so why can't you inactivate them why why do they have a protein

01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:03.900
why do they have a attribute of a protein that no other protein has there is a term called denaturing

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:11.260
where when you heat a protein beyond a certain temperature it can no longer sustain its

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:17.900
tertiary folding structure that was it gained as a result of its manufactured by ribosomes

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:25.420
so i'm curious as to how it is that a protein can lock itself into a position which renders it

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:31.260
temperature impervious it doesn't really jive with the chemical nature of the proteins that

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:37.420
we've understood up until this stage and in fact it suggests that prions are not prions

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:41.020
that they're not proteins that there's something else or whatever they're looking at is not what

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:43.500
they think they're looking at if they're looking at anything at all

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:55.500
i think it's it's getting scary in a way because we're being forced to really question the basic

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:59.580
tenets of biology the basic tenets of of these

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:10.860
these claims and it's very very strange to me that some of these more outlandish

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:19.020
and and lack of lacking foundation theories in biology are now being pursued and pushed to the

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:26.300
four prion disease is not something that we study a lot because there aren't very good examples

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:31.500
of it there it also supposedly is so dangerous that when people study it they die

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.740
but they have no mechanism for how it works they can't explain how it works

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:42.300
and they can't show you any diagrams of how it works even though it can be as little as 20 amino

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:51.580
acids according to some experts even though it only takes one one particle one single molecule

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:57.660
according to some experts they still can't explain to you how those 20 amino acids result in other

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:03.420
proteins and a cascade of misfolding they just they don't have an explanation

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:14.220
and they don't seem to be interested in one and this sounds a lot like the rest of virology

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:22.860
where the cartoon is sufficient where the hand waving is sufficient the assumptions are okay

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.140
it doesn't matter it's a good ballpark

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:37.980
we've got to be very careful ladies and gentlemen because the train is still moving at full speed

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:45.420
and nobody cares we're the only ones who are paying attention right now and a lot of other

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:50.540
people are still being bamboozled by those on our side who are pushing the worst case scenario

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:57.100
the worst case scenario of bioweapons the worst case scenario of prion disease the worst case scenario

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.220
of nothing to do with protocols

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:10.140
they talk for hours about prions they talk for hours about bioweapons they talk for hours about

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:17.260
anthrax they never talk about the protocols and how protocols and opioid deaths were used to

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:22.940
create excess deaths that were then blamed on covid that were used to tell the narrative

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:28.460
because you had to have excess deaths to point to and there were only a few ways for them to

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:35.180
create them and not all of them were as reliable or as as useful as others once the narrative

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:40.300
started to break down you couldn't use ventilators forever you weren't going to get away with using

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:47.180
remdesivir forever you weren't going to get away with not using antibiotics forever but they got

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:52.940
away with it long enough to create the event and then they were on top of this worst case

01:27:52.940 --> 01:28:01.020
scenario narrative that had been laid by everyone from Rand Paul to Tony Fauci to Paul Catrell to

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:02.380
George Webb

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:11.580
they all were laying a worst case scenario narrative about a gain of function virus and we know nothing

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:24.300
and we're still being misled right now as we speak today of the same things by the same people

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:30.940
worst case scenario is still on the table worst case scenario is still being prepared

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:36.940
worst case scenario still coming in the future worst case scenario still has many facets that you

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:46.060
don't understand and while they're talking about worst case scenario for hours and hours and hours

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.900
they never reflect on the PCR fraud or on the death certificate fraud or the do not resuscitate

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:58.620
orders in New York or all the other fraud that led to the excess deaths that they called COVID

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:05.580
that these people called the bio weapon that these people said we're giving this is the the crux of it

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:15.740
the people who repeated over and over in 2021 that a million people have been killed those people

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:21.500
while they knew that protocols would did the majority of it while they knew that the majority

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.900
of it was based on lies they said that a million people were killed by COVID

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.700
these are liars ladies and gentlemen these are liars and we need to sort out the liars

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:42.220
from those that have misled the others because the others are just following their lead

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:49.100
the others are our trusting people they shouldn't trust and you can't always fault people for that

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:58.060
you can't not in this stressful time not in this this evil malevolent time

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:06.220
people were desperate to find people to trust and people were very good trained liars highly skilled

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:13.340
and the illusion of consensus about a dangerous novel virus that killed millions of people the

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:18.220
millions of more were saved from and is likely from a gain of function lab was a consensus that

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.660
was almost impossible to break because almost all of these people were involved in sustaining

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:34.940
part of it by not questioning it if all you ever did was fight for one thing if all you ever did was

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:41.020
become known for one thing during the pandemic chances are you were not fighting for us

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:51.180
that's the bottom line if you weren't an integrator at some point and adding up all of the things

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:55.740
that you knew were wrong with this adding up all of the things that were incongruent and telling

01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:01.420
people man i can't believe how much of this stuff people didn't get then you were you are

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:08.060
probably not fighting for us like if you had one message you know one thing that you always

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:14.060
get invited to talk about one thing that you go all around the world complaining about one thing

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.980
and you probably weren't fighting for us because there were lots of things to talk about and

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:25.500
everybody should have been talking about them it should have been okay for any one of these people

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:31.740
to go and talk about it you wouldn't need all the people to go unless all the people had to go

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:38.860
in order to perform a theater where this was never questioned this faith was never questioned

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:43.420
and that's what i think's going on here that's why i'm building this map that's why i want to

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:49.340
meet all these people talk to them and DM them tweet with them because i want to figure out why

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:56.780
they can't see the obvious that this is not a mystery virus until you do the math excess deaths

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:03.820
is not the mystery virus because there are lots of known sources of this excess deaths that people

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:09.580
should be talking about and there's no evidence of spread

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.140
and so all of these people are engaged in a train pulling and pushing exercise where they're

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:23.100
faking the stopping and starting the train they are participating in it together the reason why

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:29.180
it's important to understand the participation part is because if this guy does it by himself

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:35.100
he doesn't need to coordinate with anyone he doesn't need to stay out of anyone's way

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:41.500
he can just pretend that he's doing it all by himself but by himself he would never be able

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.740
to convince a group of children that he was really having any meaningful effect on this trade

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:54.620
however with a bunch of his friends dressed big and strong with lights and with little machines

01:32:54.620 --> 01:33:04.060
that made sparks and 40 of them lined up equally spaced along that train making noises and not

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:11.340
getting in each other's way by carefully coordinating their movements and timing those 40 guys with

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:17.820
lighted suits and sparks could make those children think that they were actually stopping and starting

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:24.460
the train themselves and that's what needed to be done with this pandemic by giving everybody a

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:33.340
separate job and making sure that no one was allowed to always be on top of everything but

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:42.140
everyone had a single part of the train to push and fake that they were pulling and pushing on

01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:50.300
so you fake and push and pull on the last car i'll fake and push and pull on the third car

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.740
you fake and push and pull on the fifth car and other five of us will fake and push and pull on the

01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:01.660
last car and collectively we will fool all of these children into believing we're stopping the car

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:07.660
stopping the train and starting it again and that's what all of these things were that's what the

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:17.420
arguments about individual early treatments that's what the argument of of protocols was about

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:24.540
Richard Fleming had a protocol with Remdesivir on it for the first nine months of the of the pandemic

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:36.620
go figure right that's what arguing about the the misuse of steroids is that's what the

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:44.220
argument of the the use of antibiotics was all of these things separately were fought for by

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:50.380
different people and discussed or represented by different people heart officially or synthetically

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:57.100
or or by just the grassroots randomness of it and then once all those things were sorted they

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:02.620
were promoted that way and if somebody like Byron Bridal came out early with something they didn't

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:09.580
expect and they threw someone else in front of him so the Byron would never really be able to have

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.180
the impact that he wanted to have and they could ruin his career and bog him down with legal

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:20.940
challenges and then put someone else on Brett Weinstein's podcast who would speak out in a more

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:27.020
nuanced way about the transfections while never actually calling them transfections

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.540
and slow roll the realization that maybe this wasn't going to work as planned

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:40.940
and slow roll it in a way so that the vast majority of people in America would still believe that this

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:48.700
whole thing was that was happening and that's what this slow roll was they have convinced us

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:55.740
that the earth was clean before 2019 and then something got out and it covered the earth in itself

01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:00.620
that is not possible but somehow there's an illusion of consensus that it's obviously happened

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:08.300
and despite the fact that the EUAs and the lockdowns were kind of bad for some people millions were

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:17.740
killed by a virus and millions more were saved by less than perfect lockdown measures but it was

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:26.060
again a function virus what else could we have done that's what this faith is and the faith is

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:34.140
definitely a lie and that's what they're doing to us they're just lying to us right through their

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.420
teeth and so we've got to show those lies to our children we've got to teach them that they've

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:46.140
been lied to teach them in the right way though you've got to teach them compassion to understand

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:52.220
that their teachers were frightened into believing this stuff that the TV has bullied them into

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.140
believing this stuff just like we believed it a few years ago ladies and gentlemen

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:04.300
just like i believed it a few years ago and gave kind of kids all their shots

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.860
ladies and gentlemen stop transfection and help the humans quite frankly get off the vaccines

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:20.620
schedule quite frankly just stop it all if you're a new parent don't give them anything

01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:28.140
if you're thinking about having kids understand that children are so resilient and beautiful

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.660
that if you don't give them any vaccines you might actually have a kid that sleeps through the night

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:38.300
you might have a kid that doesn't have earache or sore throat or anything you might have a kid

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:44.700
that grows up to be a super genius oh ladies and gentlemen they are trying to eliminate the

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:49.180
control group by any means necessary and they really already have right i'm not in the control

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.860
group if you talk about all vaccines but i am compared to my children

01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:00.540
i had a few they've had many but none of them have been transfected and you shouldn't

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:05.020
transfect anybody you love either ladies and gentlemen thanks for joining me it was definitely

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:09.020
not an hour it was an hour and 36 minutes but you know that's how it goes

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.260
intra muscular injection many combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:18.700
system is dumb transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not pattern

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:27.100
integrities i don't know if this is the intellectual bright web the interdependent

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:33.020
bright web the interdisciplinary bright web the invisible bright web but it is definitely

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:48.940
giga ohm biological thanks for joining me i'll see you again tomorrow

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:05.020
i

01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:27.420
hundred and four people here thank you very much for joining me guys i really appreciate it please
