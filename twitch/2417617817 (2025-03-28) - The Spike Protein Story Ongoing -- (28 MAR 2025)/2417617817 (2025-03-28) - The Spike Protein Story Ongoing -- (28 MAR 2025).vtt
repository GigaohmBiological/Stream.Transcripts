WEBVTT

00:31.264 --> 00:34.905
Oh, there was no doubt we were living through a revolution.

00:36.206 --> 00:41.047
I certainly experienced it as such, internalized it in that way.

00:42.067 --> 00:54.251
When the paper by Avery, McLeod, and McCarty came along, I didn't use the phraseology, but my exclamations were equivalent, saying, this is the dawn of molecular genetics.

00:54.971 --> 01:02.057
because for the first time we could have a biological assay for the genetic activity of an external molecule.

01:03.338 --> 01:17.750
So that publication, next to Francis Ryan with the molding effects on my career, was talked about quite extensively around the department at Columbia.

01:18.391 --> 01:21.654
It turns out we had a couple of people who were important leaders on

01:22.935 --> 01:50.717
Alfred Murski, who has been remarked on as having been an inappropriate critic of Avery McLeod and McCarty, I don't think it was inappropriate, but it was certainly a severe critic, was also the greatest herald of the story, so we would hear about what was going on at the Rockefeller Institute on the other side of town as if we had been at the same institution.

01:52.259 --> 01:56.424
But also Harriet Taylor was a graduate student working with L.C.

01:56.484 --> 01:56.765
Dunn.

01:56.785 --> 01:59.288
I had become interested in it as well.

02:00.069 --> 02:08.760
And she, in fact, went to do postdoctoral work in Avery's Laboratory shortly after that time.

02:09.381 --> 02:14.742
So, we had very close information linkages to the research that was going on there.

02:15.182 --> 02:16.863
We were very well informed about it.

02:16.923 --> 02:17.963
We reacted to it.

02:18.023 --> 02:23.805
There was a lot of critical dialectic, but it was not something that could be ignored.

02:23.845 --> 02:33.947
It was the most exciting thing that had happened in many, many decades and was precisely because it was so important, that is, the identification of DNA as

02:34.127 --> 02:39.969
genetic material that I empathize with the view that it should be subjected to the most critical examination.

02:40.009 --> 02:43.270
It was too important an issue to just accept casually.

02:43.290 --> 02:47.891
So as long as the debate was alive, that was the way the scientific method operates.

03:07.815 --> 03:11.404
It's real.

03:11.565 --> 03:13.911
It's real.

03:14.051 --> 03:15.816
Full speed Kevin.

03:18.268 --> 03:19.429
Just, it's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.670
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.732
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:23.752 --> 03:25.753
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.934
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:27.954 --> 03:29.936
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:29.956 --> 03:32.077
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:32.097 --> 03:34.419
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:34.439 --> 03:36.780
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.042
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:39.062 --> 03:44.285
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:44.305 --> 03:45.346
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're

04:01.312 --> 04:04.056
Yes it do.

04:04.236 --> 04:04.817
I know that.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.001
Oh yeah.

05:14.322 --> 05:19.168
Don't trouble the water.

05:19.888 --> 05:27.577
Why don't you, why don't you let it be?

05:28.418 --> 05:31.441
Still water run deep.

05:31.701 --> 05:32.362
Yes, it do.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.824
Yes, it do.

06:05.238 --> 06:22.595
♪ I'll take you far ♪ ♪ Oh, when darkness comes ♪ ♪ Get along, get on around ♪

08:47.571 --> 08:50.579
I'm gonna be your friend

09:10.774 --> 09:12.957
I am really happy to be here this morning.

09:13.017 --> 09:16.521
Thank you very much for tolerating my less than optimal production here.

09:17.622 --> 09:26.813
Don't forget that one of the spectacular commitments that is required of all these actors is that they not question the fundamental principles of the pandemic that include

09:27.714 --> 09:32.817
the molecular tests, the various molecular tests that correlated with people that got sick.

09:33.657 --> 09:44.603
And that includes people like Ryan Cole, who have recently declared on Kim Iverson's podcast that indeed he's going to consider running for governor of Idaho.

09:46.156 --> 09:49.522
It's really very spectacular where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

09:49.542 --> 09:50.944
I'm so happy to have you here.

09:50.964 --> 09:57.756
I am going to complete this introduction with a little babble and then we'll get started with the study hall.

10:02.136 --> 10:19.114
So yeah, it's a once in a lifetime that we're going to get a chance to take the power back from these charlatans, not just these guys, but also these guys that have been standing in front of them essentially on the Internet to try and bamboozle us about a mystery that we needed to solve.

10:19.634 --> 10:39.739
and about what we should blame on the spike protein and what the spike protein of the virus or the spike protein has a bad choice for transfection may be doing to our population and this time it could be different if you just allow me to help you see through these charlatans and their acolytes on social media

10:40.359 --> 10:42.060
I've got a lot of hope, ladies and gentlemen.

10:42.100 --> 10:46.161
Just like Brandy Vaughn, I've got a lot of hope that doctors can learn.

10:46.561 --> 10:49.102
I've got a lot of hope that biologists can learn.

10:49.562 --> 11:01.567
Quite frankly, I don't think there's any hope of them not running across GigaOM Biological and being faced with the important questions, the really important questions.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.088
Like, who are we really up against right now?

11:05.649 --> 11:07.451
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooley.

11:07.511 --> 11:13.296
I am the chief biologist at GigaOM Biological, coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

11:13.736 --> 11:22.364
You can find my academic work on PubMed, and you can find lots of evidence of my continued learning through the pandemic.

11:22.844 --> 11:26.267
If Panda hadn't lost my three presentations, that would be great.

11:27.628 --> 11:34.913
If you didn't have to sort through hundreds and hundreds of hours of nonsense, the NCI might be a useful thing.

11:35.314 --> 11:40.177
The wellness company's got lots of things to sell you that even come in fancy little zipper bags.

11:41.138 --> 11:51.284
Children's Health Defense, they'll take all your money, and they'll make really nice banners with it, and they'll sponsor really impressive

11:54.086 --> 12:01.072
seminars and weekend events where everybody comes and spends lots of money and nothing ever gets solved.

12:01.472 --> 12:04.694
They'll even publish lots of books, make lots of money on books.

12:04.735 --> 12:09.678
They publish all kinds of books because that's what they do.

12:10.159 --> 12:13.001
They actually, I guess, let me go because I don't sell books.

12:14.062 --> 12:19.105
I've given a really great presentation about this at the Red Pill Expo in 2024.

12:21.467 --> 12:32.131
And I'm working on some stuff with basketball and biology and a high school curriculum, a freshman biology curriculum that is going to help dispel this mythology.

12:32.171 --> 12:33.031
I'm really excited.

12:33.892 --> 12:37.013
If you want to support this work, please go to giggleandbiological.com.

12:37.053 --> 12:42.335
Just went back from the tax office yesterday afternoon.

12:42.355 --> 12:48.097
And I'm not ashamed to report back.

12:49.681 --> 12:56.546
The taxes are submitted, they are paid, whatever you want to call it.

12:59.830 --> 13:08.537
The reality is, ladies and gentlemen, is that some people are making a great deal of money doing this and some people are not.

13:09.178 --> 13:18.906
I'm one of those people that is surprisingly, maybe not surprisingly, but unsuccessful at turning an internet streaming into a successful career.

13:20.247 --> 13:23.408
Upon which I can build, you know multi-generational wealth.

13:24.008 --> 13:30.650
It's it's not it's not working out that way for me Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is Jonathan Cooey.

13:30.790 --> 13:40.452
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania this this I'm just gonna say it this haze looks a little suspicious, but I had lit a

13:41.641 --> 13:45.924
I had lit some, it's funny, I lit some incense and I let it go a little long.

13:46.384 --> 13:57.070
I probably should actually open the door because I think it's still actually settling and so it might get smokier before it, before it gets less than smoky.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.051
Oh, there we go.

13:58.131 --> 13:59.431
It's probably better.

14:00.252 --> 14:07.276
I noticed it was still going when I was running the intro and I couldn't reach back there while I was advancing the slide.

14:07.296 --> 14:08.997
So anyway, it'll clear out in a minute.

14:10.799 --> 14:13.901
Yeah, so it is the 28th of March, 2025.

14:15.181 --> 14:18.843
I'm trying to keep a little more daily presence on the internet.

14:18.863 --> 14:27.688
I think it's really important right now to keep the pressure on these so-called truth tellers and these people who are coming to our rescue on white horses with white beards.

14:28.509 --> 14:34.452
We need to stay very, very, very focused on the biology and that's what we're gonna start with next week.

14:34.952 --> 14:38.594
I'm looking very forward to coaching you through the

14:39.975 --> 14:48.524
the reorientation of your thinking about about human biology and about, you know, all the biology around you, the biology of Earth, so to speak.

14:49.245 --> 14:55.131
And maybe that's part of the reason why I think Marvin the Martian is so funny, because, you know, he thinks of himself as an alien.

14:55.271 --> 14:57.974
He is an alien and Earth is somewhere else.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.036
And so we can talk about Earth's biology.

15:01.678 --> 15:02.678
in that respect.

15:02.718 --> 15:11.924
And I think, you know, somebody like Joshua Lederberg used to think about Earth's biology and a possibility of there being biology outside of Earth, exobiology.

15:13.265 --> 15:16.887
It is remarkable where we are in 2025.

15:17.327 --> 15:20.509
I feel really blessed to be here.

15:20.970 --> 15:28.394
I just mentioned that we just recently got back from, whoops, oh, look at those nice things, they're all working again.

15:30.976 --> 15:32.157
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.539
I have not been invited to the Red Pill in July.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.280
It doesn't mean that I won't be.

15:36.380 --> 15:42.425
I did present again at the Red Pill virtually whenever it was the last time.

15:43.426 --> 15:49.851
I'm just, I'm kind of pushing the first one because the first one is also very much, feels very fresh.

15:50.851 --> 15:53.253
I said a lot of things that I was afraid to say at the time.

15:53.293 --> 15:54.534
I'm not afraid to say anymore.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.517
And it felt very much like I was,

15:59.398 --> 16:00.999
I was daring to cross a line.

16:01.039 --> 16:06.882
Apparently it didn't matter, but that's why I pushed that red pill episode, or red pill in particular.

16:06.902 --> 16:09.224
I'm going to move these chats off of the screen for now.

16:10.244 --> 16:13.826
It is, again, gigaohm biological.

16:13.946 --> 16:18.889
The message that I'm bringing you is not a message for everyone, but it is a message for anyone.

16:18.949 --> 16:20.250
Anyone can understand this.

16:21.210 --> 16:26.914
Anyone can try to reorient the way that they think about social media, the way they think about their government, and the

16:29.383 --> 16:30.784
their perception of reality.

16:31.584 --> 16:48.711
And I think it's really, you know, one of my main messages is that we, we must reorient our understanding of reality relative to social media and relative to how our government uses social media, and how weaponized piles of money in the private sector would use social media to manipulate us.

16:49.324 --> 17:05.496
If we don't reorient and come to a much better understanding of that and how it works and how it can be used malevolently against us to make us believe almost anything, then the next generation, our children, will be enslaved by that.

17:06.677 --> 17:11.681
That illusion on social media that is created by our participation, our belief

17:12.461 --> 17:34.879
that you know a few minutes on on x or a few minutes on telegram or just checking a few you know facebook posts is enough to stay up to date and that there's nothing uh manipulation happening there on a nationwide or even a global scale it is not to be underestimated how the power of propaganda has

17:35.954 --> 17:54.021
gain of function in the sense of how it has expanded to a global reach and therefore politics and political shows and mythological performances on American social media can have global implications and vice versa.

17:55.376 --> 18:12.441
Mythological performances in Germany can have political implications and societal implications in America simply because of the hyper-connectivity of these people and the thoughts that are allowed to percolate through this hyper-connectivity.

18:13.681 --> 18:19.463
If the thing that percolates through the hyper-connectivity is a fear of the loss of airline travel,

18:20.598 --> 18:28.143
then the consciousness on earth that is actively engaged in using social media will be thinking that collectively.

18:29.343 --> 18:33.066
And I don't think that there's any way to underestimate the power of that.

18:36.828 --> 18:41.030
So it's a tough one to swallow because this is for all the marbles.

18:41.090 --> 18:48.495
The idea is that our grandchildren end up being grandfathered into that system where they just accept it.

18:49.758 --> 18:52.920
because their parents accepted it, their parents being our kids.

18:55.222 --> 18:56.683
And we cannot allow this.

18:58.164 --> 19:07.291
One of the keys is getting off of the militarized social media control programs that are just called social media.

19:08.332 --> 19:11.354
That's the first and one of the first and foremost things to do.

19:12.195 --> 19:15.998
One of the other first and foremost things to do is to understand that the

19:17.270 --> 19:23.355
The all-cause mortality in the United States is a complex but well understood phenomenon.

19:23.956 --> 19:27.318
There are no surprises in this because there's too much at stake.

19:28.099 --> 19:37.427
Too many trillions of dollars were at stake for them not to have known that there was an all-cause mortality rise expected to appear.

19:38.327 --> 19:40.930
And so we were going to have a preponderance of old people.

19:41.010 --> 19:46.094
And that problem economically, socioeconomically was serious.

19:47.389 --> 19:57.513
And in some countries, maybe even more serious than it is in the United States, maybe in China, for example, or in Scotland or in Germany, it might be even more serious than it is in America.

20:00.054 --> 20:00.914
Understand that.

20:02.065 --> 20:26.228
And that simple anticipated rise in all-cause mortality seen coming for decades was sculpted using a little bit of murder and lies to create the illusion of a pandemic that can now be easily seen in retrospect as an anomaly that can't be explained by either a lab leak or a natural virus with some special HIV inserts or something like that, a fear and cleavage site.

20:26.248 --> 20:27.069
This is absurd.

20:29.713 --> 20:30.793
It's murder and lies.

20:31.034 --> 20:38.537
And that's why we find ourselves here trapped behind the Trump administration with this absurd performance going on.

20:41.778 --> 20:56.184
Where these absurd characters are now in positions of power that they could lose at any moment depending on whether they figure out who they follow on Twitter or whether they're not at their alcoholics or whether they know how to keep classified information classified.

20:57.184 --> 20:59.265
It's absurd right now what we're dealing with.

21:00.202 --> 21:05.046
And yet that's all gonna be blamed on this Trump, Trump and Trump.

21:05.086 --> 21:08.128
Nobody's talking about the white haired lady sitting next to Trump.

21:12.772 --> 21:28.605
And so while the murder and lies that were committed using pure oxygen in hospitals, committed under the guise of PCR tests being a useful diagnostic tool, and under the guise of antibiotics not being appropriate for a viral syndrome,

21:30.302 --> 21:33.923
Here's the message of hope that this is the end.

21:33.983 --> 21:35.004
This is all they got.

21:36.084 --> 21:38.005
There are no gain of function viruses.

21:38.045 --> 21:50.750
There's nothing that they can dump in a mud puddle somewhere in China and it can leak all over the world and they can make a spectacular mistake or there's nothing they can spray in a bat cave under a DARPA grant that's gonna result in this.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.971
It's just not possible.

21:55.387 --> 21:59.890
That's why a clown like Nathan Wolf has been busy so long as a virologist.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.070
I mean, it's absurd.

22:03.232 --> 22:09.115
And so here's the truth as fast as I can say it, ladies and gentlemen, this illusion requires your participation to sustain.

22:09.675 --> 22:15.439
Transfection was a known methodology before the pandemic and using it on healthy people would have been a crime before 2020.

22:16.600 --> 22:21.803
Declaring an emergency really didn't change that except for in the legislative structure of America.

22:22.623 --> 22:39.751
RNA cannot pandemic and there's lots and lots of biologists that could learn this on their own, could challenge themselves to prove and try to understand how it is that RNA could pandemic even though DNA is supposed to have a lot of special properties that RNA does not have.

22:41.058 --> 22:43.260
And finally, intramuscular injection is dumb.

22:43.320 --> 22:49.366
I think it's a phrase that every doctor should sit down by themselves and think about deeply if they dare.

22:50.026 --> 22:54.851
And if they dare, I think they will find something very weird staring back at them in the mirror.

22:55.632 --> 22:58.755
Something like a, holy cow, I never thought about that before.

22:59.295 --> 23:02.896
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been saying it succinctly for more than two years.

23:03.356 --> 23:05.557
The best way to say it is that the U.S.

23:05.597 --> 23:07.738
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

23:07.758 --> 23:10.098
You can figure it out by comparing the U.S.

23:10.118 --> 23:14.440
vaccine schedule to any other vaccine schedule in the Western world.

23:15.362 --> 23:21.624
Ladies and gentlemen, people using and learning biology are starting to know better, starting to figure it out.

23:21.784 --> 23:28.646
And these people who did know better are starting to look like criminals, complicit in things.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.766
And I don't think that's a very good look.

23:31.507 --> 23:37.308
I'm going to bounce out of here for just a second and see if I can fix that little goof there.

23:38.549 --> 23:39.489
There we go.

23:39.869 --> 23:41.389
And slideshow here.

23:41.890 --> 23:42.530
Yesterday,

23:45.795 --> 24:03.938
Yesterday, I showed a video of one Brandi Vaughn interviewing one Suzanne Humphreys, MD, recently, who has been on Joe Rogan and The High Wire in the past few days, where she was interviewed at Cal Jam.

24:04.719 --> 24:10.020
And to summarize her statements, Suzanne Humphreys in 2018, who I will remind you,

24:13.569 --> 24:27.042
had a book about polio, measles, and smallpox and the history of the disappearance of those in relation to pesticides and clean water and sanitation.

24:27.162 --> 24:28.343
In 2013, this book came out.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.724
So five years later,

24:30.345 --> 24:42.196
She's talking to Brandy Vaughn, the Merck whistleblower, the person who says ingestion versus injection and tries to teach people the biology of how dumb an intramuscular injection is.

24:42.616 --> 24:43.437
This doctor

24:44.741 --> 24:47.282
doesn't think there's any hope for other doctors.

24:47.882 --> 24:57.243
She aims her messages at parents, but in the same little conversation, she has advice for parents is to ask other parents.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.644
So she doesn't really want to help anybody.

24:59.964 --> 25:03.805
Her main message is parents should ask other parents.

25:04.225 --> 25:05.865
Then I guess they won't need doctors.

25:06.045 --> 25:06.405
I don't know.

25:06.865 --> 25:10.146
She advises parents to research both sides.

25:12.310 --> 25:16.813
And she gives very specific advice that you shouldn't give a needle to a sick kid.

25:17.914 --> 25:27.359
That's about as precise as Suzanne Humphreys is in 2018, five years after writing a book, releasing her second book in this video.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.821
And we are now, how many years?

25:31.302 --> 25:31.402
One.

25:35.860 --> 26:03.623
Seven years after this video and she is on Joe Rogan for two and a half hours And she even says that specifically that Paul Offit Claims that some mercury is better than other mercury It's almost like we we haven't moved at all in the whole time that Suzanne Humphreys has had a stage

26:04.537 --> 26:18.162
has had a website, has had a book, has had two books, has been on stage with and in a movie, two movies, and also been on stage with CHD at every conference they've ever done.

26:19.302 --> 26:20.923
I've shaken this person's hand.

26:24.644 --> 26:31.867
I honestly never dreamed that she was part of it, but I cannot come to any other conclusion given her lack of progress.

26:34.972 --> 26:36.338
It's an important thing.

26:36.419 --> 26:38.447
She says, well, it's more than just vaccines.

26:38.487 --> 26:39.853
It's also antibiotics.

26:42.731 --> 26:49.636
I need you to understand, ladies and gentlemen, there's a reason why I'm not gonna stop with Brandy, because Brandy said it right when no one else would.

26:49.716 --> 26:52.698
When Suzanne Humphries wouldn't say it, Brandy said it right.

26:53.118 --> 26:55.380
When Polly wouldn't say it, Brandy said it right.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.921
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:56.981 --> 27:00.163
and Judy Mikovits wouldn't say it right, Brandy said it right.

27:00.864 --> 27:10.471
The only person that's ever said it right consistently that I've ever found that makes it about the methodology, the injection versus ingestion,

27:12.168 --> 27:12.949
is Brandy Vaughn.

27:13.769 --> 27:20.953
And she made this argument for years in the presence of, as colleagues of, these other anti-vaxxers.

27:21.454 --> 27:29.959
And this is a gigantic red flag, bigger than any Denny's or truck stop American flag you've ever seen in your life.

27:31.420 --> 27:38.284
And she died in December of 2020, at the start of the pandemic when the murder was just starting.

27:39.261 --> 27:43.363
This is about something much bigger than profit.

27:43.483 --> 27:49.065
Brandy thought that it was all about profits and it was the pharmaceutical companies and that is incorrect.

27:49.925 --> 27:53.467
The pharmaceutical companies are pawns in this just like the governments are.

27:53.927 --> 27:56.028
This is a gigantic operation.

27:58.649 --> 28:01.290
It is a multinational operation.

28:02.363 --> 28:27.411
that understands all the variables at play, including that there are homogeneous populations, like the Indian population, or subpopulations of India, like the subpopulations of China, that have very usefully segregated themselves for a long time, essentially representing a kind of inbred mouse strain in humans.

28:28.752 --> 28:34.037
to be distinguished from other inbred mouse strains, like those really nice ones in Finland.

28:34.818 --> 28:37.721
There's some good ones in Norway, although they're getting mixed up quick.

28:38.101 --> 28:38.882
Same with Sweden.

28:40.584 --> 28:47.370
And so you see, there is an imperative to collect the data as it stands, as it exists, before it never exists that way again.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.694
The only things disappearing from the world are not languages.

28:52.475 --> 29:07.239
They are also genealogies, whole data sets that could provide insight that would otherwise not be available were these variations in the genome expression paradigm pattern integrity not available for collection.

29:09.039 --> 29:16.201
Now, not in any way, shape, or form do I believe that they are prepared to collect the data that would be hypothetically necessary.

29:16.807 --> 29:37.877
do I think that they are capable of building the computer network that would hypothetically be necessary, nor do I think they are capable of interpreting the results, but nevertheless, in a comic book, in a cartoon, in a one-page proposal, in a national security brief, this shit all sounds really good.

29:40.322 --> 29:59.728
And that's how the Human Genome Project has perpetuated itself for so many years under the guidance of people like Mark Lander, and Francis Collins, and these kinds of people who have understood the reality that when they declared that the Human Genome Project had been completed, that is nothing.

29:59.808 --> 30:00.048
What?

30:00.528 --> 30:00.688
No.

30:01.648 --> 30:04.109
That meant that they played one game of Go to the end.

30:06.553 --> 30:09.596
Now they needed to play billions of more games of Go.

30:10.176 --> 30:20.526
And yes, it's become cheaper and cheaper to sequence, but it still doesn't mean that they can produce a high-fidelity, reliable catalog of your genes.

30:22.227 --> 30:24.769
It just means that they can do something that they can lie about.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.791
And it might have a lot of details.

30:26.811 --> 30:29.233
It might have a lot of details about proteins.

30:29.293 --> 30:32.957
It might have a lot of details about protein variants.

30:34.625 --> 30:39.209
or enhancers, or RNA regulation, or any other details they claim to find.

30:39.769 --> 30:51.498
They will never find any details about the trajectory through time, the development of the adult animal, the adult human.

30:51.539 --> 30:52.980
They're never going to find that data.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.681
They're not even looking for it right now.

30:54.721 --> 30:58.204
They can't even conceive of the possibility of where this might be hidden.

31:01.451 --> 31:11.304
And so all they are really doing is perpetuating this idea that this is done, even though they still don't know what all the data is.

31:12.708 --> 31:16.973
They can talk smack about it in TED Talks, but they don't know what all the data is.

31:17.393 --> 31:20.336
They don't know if they have enough space to store it.

31:20.937 --> 31:24.261
They can't even conceive of the amount of storage space necessary.

31:24.281 --> 31:31.128
And then they got to connect all those hard drives to each other so that the machine learning algorithm can access all that data.

31:31.997 --> 31:49.383
Just try to imagine the server array that needs to hold all of the Chinese genomes combined with all of the Chinese medical data, and then how you design a machine learning program in a computer that can... What are we talking about here?

31:49.403 --> 31:53.145
I'm not saying that these are inconceivable,

31:54.065 --> 32:09.696
solutions that people couldn't solve these problems, I'm suggesting to you that none of these problems are capable of being solved with the existing hardware, with the existing data arrays, with the existing internet.

32:09.756 --> 32:10.777
It's not like that.

32:12.078 --> 32:14.920
They don't even know what all the data is.

32:17.862 --> 32:18.503
And finally,

32:19.150 --> 32:21.591
They need to validate the predictions that are made.

32:21.631 --> 32:28.732
See, they tried to do that a long time ago when they were going to cure genetic diseases by transfecting people with the protein they were missing.

32:28.792 --> 32:29.472
And what happened?

32:32.873 --> 32:33.113
Right?

32:33.153 --> 32:36.534
That just ended in the early 2000s.

32:36.574 --> 32:38.954
It was just over because it's a failure.

32:38.974 --> 32:39.794
It doesn't work.

32:41.935 --> 32:48.096
And so part of their assumptions of the Human Genome Project was that it would work.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.599
Do you see, that's not a small failure.

32:52.659 --> 32:54.620
That's a gigantic failure.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.701
It's not a small setback.

32:57.061 --> 32:59.102
That's a gigantic setback.

33:00.382 --> 33:04.044
But they're just going on like they already know what all the data is.

33:04.084 --> 33:05.504
They're already storing it.

33:05.564 --> 33:09.306
See, they have it at 23andMe.

33:09.326 --> 33:12.847
We've got to worry about like 18 million genomes being lost.

33:13.447 --> 33:14.728
That data is useless.

33:15.697 --> 33:20.181
I mean, is it useless for mapping and making landmark studies of the human genome?

33:20.201 --> 33:20.862
Probably not.

33:22.843 --> 33:32.152
But it's useless for this imaginary thing where they're going to crack the building code and we're going to start pre-programming our kids to be smart and fast and beautiful.

33:32.232 --> 33:33.133
That's ridiculous.

33:37.335 --> 33:39.236
And that's why these people were put in place.

33:39.296 --> 33:49.742
That's why they all have connections to the Human Genome Project, to this genome screening, to clinical diagnostics, to using genes to diagnose diseases.

33:50.123 --> 33:52.184
They all have that in their background.

33:52.384 --> 34:03.290
All of them have that, or they have this interesting anti-vax position that never has evolved to understanding intramuscular injection.

34:03.350 --> 34:05.432
The methodology itself is being flawed.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.355
That's the two kinds of people you find on this picture.

34:09.395 --> 34:09.815
That's it.

34:09.935 --> 34:25.128
Either they were associated with big pharma, they were associated with big genome, or they were associated with big diagnostic, or they were associated with virology and public health.

34:25.168 --> 34:25.569
That's it.

34:25.889 --> 34:26.950
They were all there.

34:27.944 --> 34:35.268
None of these people were minding their own business at the beginning of the pandemic and then just threw everything to the wind to try and get the word out.

34:35.328 --> 34:38.230
And even after they learned the truth, they never did that.

34:39.738 --> 34:41.139
That's what you need to see.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.639
That's how dark this is.

34:42.739 --> 34:52.464
It is not pretty, and it's not a fun message, but it's real because transfection needed to be absolved of any of this, and that's why it's still ongoing.

34:52.904 --> 35:01.008
That's why the Scooby-Doo and the acceptance of the gain-of-function virus, which may be more dangerous than we thought, is so important because then

35:02.794 --> 35:21.373
spike protein so this is real the trump administration just nominated dr susan first i want to point out a couple things what i said back here i'm going to go back sorry let me just go back nor so it's all about the human genome project and what i'm making the argument is is they don't even know

35:22.219 --> 35:23.179
what all the data is.

35:23.600 --> 35:28.581
They don't even know how much storage space they need, but they know they need a shit ton, excuse my language.

35:29.142 --> 35:30.542
It all needs to be accessible.

35:30.582 --> 35:34.023
That means they need a lot better networks than they have right now.

35:34.444 --> 35:38.625
And they ain't building better networks because they want you to have good phone service.

35:41.266 --> 35:48.649
They're not building more places to store data because they want you to have higher definition YouTube access.

35:49.009 --> 35:50.750
They want your Netflix to come in at 4K.

35:54.315 --> 36:04.484
And so if it's about the Human Genome Project, like I said, then there should be some evidence of the fact that they're just going to go forward with this, even though we now have a maha in the White House.

36:04.504 --> 36:04.824
So this is real.

36:04.864 --> 36:10.950
The Trump administration just nominated Dr. Susan Menorrez to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.252
Here's the announcement from Donald Trump.

36:14.272 --> 36:23.438
He says, I'm proud to announce that Dr. Susan Menorrez is my nominee to serve as the next director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC.

36:23.518 --> 36:28.862
Dr. Menorrez brings decades of experience championing innovation, transparency, and strong public health systems.

36:29.322 --> 36:37.027
She has a PhD from the University of Wisconsin and postdoctoral training in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine.

36:37.567 --> 36:45.351
As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Menorrez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.

36:45.812 --> 36:50.374
Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.

36:50.755 --> 36:53.236
Dr. Menorrez will work closely with our great

36:53.416 --> 36:55.917
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr.

36:56.337 --> 37:03.800
Together, they will prioritize accountability, high standards and disease prevention to finally address the chronic disease epidemic.

37:03.880 --> 37:12.523
No, I'm not going to tell you that I think Kim Iverson is necessarily wittingly participating, but I want to point out a couple of things in case they're not obvious.

37:13.283 --> 37:15.444
But number one, she's sponsored by Rumble.

37:15.504 --> 37:21.146
Number two, she has all kinds of other sponsors that are supplements that she reads on every show.

37:21.786 --> 37:28.069
Number three, she is now, remember Rumble is an alternative website to YouTube.

37:28.469 --> 37:35.732
It's an alternative social media that has potential global reach, has an app on your phone,

37:37.165 --> 37:38.506
And she's sponsored by them.

37:38.526 --> 37:41.628
Number two, she has supplement ads.

37:41.668 --> 37:58.379
And number three, she's reading a tweet from beginning to end, which kind of suggests that, you know, in case you're not aware, there's a lot of truth available on X. And I think that this is part of a big problem that no one seems to see.

37:58.439 --> 38:00.501
I don't use people's tweets.

38:01.434 --> 38:03.515
I'm not telling people to go to Twitter.

38:03.935 --> 38:14.341
In fact, if you follow me on X, you'll probably hate it because I only go there to annoy and only go there to make sure people realize that this whole place is a shit show.

38:14.761 --> 38:16.142
There's nothing useful here.

38:16.202 --> 38:22.025
If you start scrolling on that, that, that thing, it's just awful for you.

38:22.987 --> 38:25.048
And these people are allowed to lie to you.

38:25.508 --> 38:31.890
So even if she doesn't really understand how she is participating, she's participating.

38:31.930 --> 38:35.891
Now, is it wrong if she's a journalist to read X?

38:36.071 --> 38:36.711
I guess not.

38:36.831 --> 38:39.832
Is it wrong if she's a journalist to report with these people?

38:39.912 --> 38:40.872
No, I don't think so.

38:41.332 --> 38:43.793
But we've got to require these people to learn.

38:45.976 --> 38:57.322
So if she had me on a few days before she had Ryan Cole on, why was Ryan Cole allowed to just say he's running for governor and wasn't just asked, okay, so you're a diagnostic guy.

38:57.662 --> 39:00.764
You've done 100, by 2022, you've done 250,000 COVID tests in your laboratory.

39:00.784 --> 39:02.205
I just had this guy on who,

39:08.504 --> 39:14.708
worked for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and he says that all those tests were confounding a background.

39:14.748 --> 39:15.809
What do you think about that?

39:17.096 --> 39:35.275
And so somewhere in between here, there is a fire hose of information and incoming things to do and stuff to keep straight that she's not really able to be the journalist that she probably is capable of being, simply because they keep enough balls in her hands.

39:35.755 --> 39:40.160
She's got to juggle enough things so that she's not really computing.

39:41.095 --> 39:43.556
I think that's what a lot of other people do wittingly.

39:43.956 --> 39:46.176
She's not doing it wittingly, I don't think.

39:46.236 --> 39:49.077
Because when I talked to her, she was asking.

39:49.157 --> 39:49.997
She was listening.

39:50.077 --> 39:51.217
She was asking questions.

39:51.277 --> 39:52.378
I can't recommend enough.

39:52.818 --> 39:54.138
That video was great.

39:54.218 --> 39:55.338
That interview was great.

39:55.418 --> 39:57.199
It's got 160,000 views.

39:57.639 --> 40:00.340
It's not that many, but it's way more than I've ever gotten before.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.360
And we got a lot of things right on that show.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.381
So I think there's still hope.

40:04.421 --> 40:06.121
We can still stay in touch with her.

40:06.541 --> 40:10.342
I still have her contact information, but I'm trying to be careful about how I use it.

40:10.782 --> 40:13.543
But this, this is what I'm talking about.

40:14.184 --> 40:17.345
Because she knows, she can see this coming.

40:17.485 --> 40:19.586
She's gonna say it out loud.

40:20.087 --> 40:21.307
Everybody else should hear it.

40:21.727 --> 40:29.551
Why in the world are we choosing this lady to be the head of the CDC instead of dismantling the CDC?

40:30.992 --> 40:32.633
Before Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:32.673 --> 40:36.415
got into HHS, he was talking about taking it down to the studs.

40:40.143 --> 40:41.924
Now he's appointing, whoops.

40:42.344 --> 40:43.604
Now he's, what?

40:43.684 --> 40:45.185
That was weird.

40:46.405 --> 40:46.905
Glitch!

40:49.146 --> 40:50.486
Let's see if I can fix that quick.

40:51.087 --> 40:52.167
Anyway, let's run this.

40:53.087 --> 40:56.568
And make America healthy again.

40:56.828 --> 41:07.232
Okay, so most Americans have no idea who Susan Menorahs is, but they should because her resume reads like a script from a dystopian sci-fi thriller.

41:07.892 --> 41:10.594
Menorahs isn't some friendly public health bureaucrat.

41:10.614 --> 41:12.855
She's not a doctor you'd see treating patients.

41:13.335 --> 41:18.098
She's a biosecurity architect, forged in the heart of the national security state.

41:18.539 --> 41:20.080
Her background isn't public health.

41:20.280 --> 41:24.222
It's biodefense, DARPA, and surveillance-era innovation.

41:24.622 --> 41:31.687
She cut her teeth in the Pentagon's inner circles, from the Department of Homeland Security to the National Nuclear Security Administration, and now

41:32.307 --> 41:40.172
She's the deputy director of ARPA-H, the newest alphabet agency you've probably never heard of, but absolutely should have.

41:40.652 --> 41:47.016
ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, was sold to the public as a cancer-fighting moonshot.

41:47.476 --> 41:59.544
Modeled after DARPA, the military's bleeding edge innovation lab, ARPA-H- It's funny, when he announced this, it was one of these cancer moonshots where Joe Biden actually whispered into the microphone,

42:00.789 --> 42:01.910
want your data.

42:02.991 --> 42:04.513
I know what you guys want.

42:04.593 --> 42:05.754
You want their data.

42:06.415 --> 42:07.175
That's how he said it.

42:07.255 --> 42:08.076
It was really creepy.

42:08.777 --> 42:13.461
H was billed as the place where bold, high-risk, disruptive health tech would be born.

42:13.942 --> 42:24.412
What they didn't tell you is that it would also be where tools of surveillance, behavior manipulation, and biometric control would quietly be developed, all in the name of health

42:25.211 --> 42:47.431
now health what health innovation right because mary holland is also the head of c of children's health defense also argues regularly for health innovation that includes ai i'm not making that up that's real she argues for human rights on a global scale she argues about whether or not the who should have more power

42:48.553 --> 42:58.679
These people are all enacting the same script where they have these parts to play and they stick to that part.

42:59.580 --> 43:04.583
And if you're not aware of it, it really just seems like they're focused, but it's not focus.

43:05.652 --> 43:08.334
It is obfuscation of the truth.

43:08.755 --> 43:31.435
And even for someone like Kim Iverson, it's very hard to put it all together because she, unlike me, has never been employed by them, worked with them, tried to convince them to understand something, never asked, never had them ask them to write her a letter or write on their behalf like I have.

43:32.756 --> 43:45.567
And so I think I have a kind of unique insight into the trap we've fallen into, especially those of us on this conservative populist right that imagined that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:45.627 --> 43:53.253
and ICANN and CHD were doing the best that they could to get this out without getting murdered.

43:53.694 --> 43:56.896
And that's just, it's just not true at all.

43:57.577 --> 44:00.998
You know, Andrew Wakefield risked nothing.

44:01.458 --> 44:06.460
Polly Tommy has basically risked nothing to save any child at this point.

44:06.821 --> 44:19.365
You can't have been on 90 billboards in the UK in the early 2000s or late 90s about this issue and still be calling it health freedom or health choice.

44:19.505 --> 44:20.846
Like, it's not right.

44:22.884 --> 44:28.169
I think we can get someone like Kim Iverson to understand that fundamental problem.

44:28.630 --> 44:29.571
You didn't vote for it.

44:29.811 --> 44:30.892
Congress didn't debate it.

44:31.173 --> 44:43.946
It was slipped into existence in 2022 with billions of taxpayer dollars and given sweeping power to partner with private industry, big tech, and the intelligence community, all while operating with minimal oversight.

44:44.466 --> 44:50.970
One of ARPA-H's flagship programs is something called DG Heals, short for Digital Health Security.

44:51.311 --> 44:52.251
And it's not about healing.

44:52.611 --> 44:54.693
It's about securing the digital health domain.

44:54.973 --> 45:07.121
That means biometric authentication, real-time health monitoring, and integrating wearables and implants to track your vitals, your mood, and your movements constantly for your safety, of course.

45:07.681 --> 45:23.894
Another program, NITRO, which stands for Novel Innovations for Tissue Regeneration in Osteoarthritis, might sound benign, but like many ARPA-H projects, it's less about medicine and more about transforming the human body into a data-producing platform.

45:23.994 --> 45:24.174
Think

45:24.734 --> 45:32.855
neural interfaces, smart tissues, and remote regenerative tech, all managed by platforms that feed back into a centralized data system.

45:33.456 --> 45:41.017
And then there's RADxRAD, a so-called radical diagnostics program developed during COVID and absorbed into the ARPA-H ecosystem.

45:41.477 --> 45:41.877
Its goal?

45:42.397 --> 45:49.338
To detect diseases before symptoms even appear using AI, wastewater monitoring, and passive biosurveillance.

45:49.878 --> 45:53.059
You could be flagged as a health risk before you even know you're sick.

45:53.619 --> 45:54.881
no consent required.

45:55.542 --> 46:01.893
So here's Susan Menorah speaking on DARPA TV about the use of AI and how it can accelerate health outcomes.

46:02.386 --> 46:06.849
We think about advancing AI for healthcare in a number of different facets.

46:07.269 --> 46:09.370
So some are direct to the patients.

46:09.530 --> 46:17.675
What tools and what capabilities can we develop to help them really understand where- So from my perspective, I had to send a message to my son.

46:18.536 --> 46:27.321
From my perspective, I feel as though it's hard to see this as just not being an announcer.

46:27.441 --> 46:30.904
If you're given a script, if someone is helping her create the script,

46:32.205 --> 46:41.598
It feels, you know, like if you just read what you're given or, or you have people, you know, giving you producing your show.

46:41.618 --> 46:45.263
I don't know if she writes that script I'm impressed.

46:46.264 --> 46:48.387
If she researched that script, I'm impressed.

46:49.648 --> 46:51.749
But it feels very much like an announcement.

46:51.769 --> 46:59.072
Of course, that program's been around for years already, so it's kind of late to warn us about ARPA-H.

46:59.592 --> 47:05.654
But this lady is new, and this appointment is new, and it should reveal to everybody exactly what's going on here.

47:06.534 --> 47:08.415
I mean, how could I have known?

47:10.663 --> 47:12.243
I mean, I won't even say it.

47:12.323 --> 47:13.684
I'm not even going to say it out loud.

47:13.704 --> 47:17.805
They are in their health care journey and empower them to make great decisions.

47:18.365 --> 47:21.005
We also think about AI from the provider side.

47:21.305 --> 47:24.306
So how can we help providers better understand their patients?

47:24.346 --> 47:36.269
How can we help providers optimize their time within the health system as they're seeing patients, as they're trying to make complex decisions to create the conditions for improved patient health outcomes?

47:37.009 --> 47:39.631
We also think about AI from the defensive side.

47:39.731 --> 47:44.213
So we understand that there is a great vulnerability within the health ecosystem.

47:44.554 --> 47:52.959
More and more is coming online in the Internet of Things that are going to have an incredibly positive effect, but we also know it creates vulnerabilities.

47:53.259 --> 48:05.186
And so we're using that same AI technology to help defend against those vulnerabilities, to anticipate the negative implications that are happening within the health systems, and to try to stay ahead of it.

48:05.700 --> 48:12.864
That's so weird, because I don't really understand how they can talk with such general terms and think it means anything.

48:12.984 --> 48:21.510
So in a system of wearables that doesn't really exist yet, they're worried about the security implications of those wearables.

48:22.750 --> 48:27.914
So creating the data and collecting it and storing it creates the danger.

48:29.074 --> 48:33.117
Collecting and keeping the data

48:34.113 --> 48:35.294
creates the danger.

48:35.615 --> 48:39.839
I don't understand how they are so wonderful.

48:40.160 --> 48:40.861
I understand.

48:40.941 --> 48:47.428
I'm just marveling at how wonderful they are at skipping this really primary idea.

48:50.872 --> 48:51.492
It's crazy.

48:51.952 --> 48:54.013
Of course we have to collect the data.

48:54.153 --> 48:57.215
Of course people should have wearables and implantables.

48:57.875 --> 48:59.036
Of course they should.

48:59.636 --> 49:03.138
Of course we should build the infrastructure necessary to do it.

49:03.198 --> 49:07.920
Of course we should set up 5G towers that can transmit that much information.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.180
Of course we should.

49:10.121 --> 49:16.224
The only question is, what do we do about the security implications that are created by that system that we're going to set up?

49:21.368 --> 49:25.371
Okay, so I'm not gonna leave this on for, this doesn't need to go on much longer.

49:25.871 --> 49:27.092
Shout out to Kim Iverson.

49:27.112 --> 49:28.793
Thank you again for that interview.

49:28.813 --> 49:34.416
I'd love to come and talk to you about Jay Bhattacharya and about what's going on, you know, give you some insight onto this.

49:34.497 --> 49:38.799
If you see this video again, just thank you very much for having me on your show.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.121
Let's go on to the next dilly dolly.

49:42.262 --> 49:43.222
What would this be?

49:43.242 --> 49:47.265
This is cold water pressure in the kitchen.

49:48.948 --> 49:50.990
Again, this is about the Human Genome Project.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.732
This is where I fill up water for storage.

49:52.772 --> 49:55.274
We should see all kinds of evidence of that, right?

49:55.575 --> 49:56.616
Flush the toilets.

49:57.016 --> 49:58.557
So you can see the sediment.

49:58.818 --> 50:01.801
So she barely has any water pressure.

50:01.921 --> 50:02.321
Why?

50:02.421 --> 50:06.205
Because there's a big data center in her town now and they take all the water.

50:06.245 --> 50:07.306
And that's not a joke.

50:07.406 --> 50:08.047
That's real.

50:09.238 --> 50:11.759
Why would, is it because of YouTube videos?

50:11.979 --> 50:14.721
Is it to make sure that your Netflix stream is in 4K?

50:15.141 --> 50:17.202
Why are they building so many data centers?

50:17.262 --> 50:20.364
Is there that many more people watching videos than ever before?

50:20.824 --> 50:25.446
Is it because we brought the internet to Africa and now those people need their YouTube videos too?

50:26.047 --> 50:34.831
Why are they building all these data centers to the expense and the detriment of communities all over America?

50:34.871 --> 50:36.352
Why would they do that unless

50:38.206 --> 50:40.047
unless it wasn't about YouTube videos.

50:41.227 --> 50:42.548
From the data center.

50:43.708 --> 50:46.309
Wow, and that's just from the water coming out of your faucet?

50:46.409 --> 50:46.629
Yeah.

50:47.209 --> 50:49.270
And this is what's in all the pipes.

50:50.050 --> 50:55.472
Just the well itself is probably 20,000, and that's not counting any of the faucets.

50:55.512 --> 51:01.154
All the replacement of the fixtures and faucets and toilets and the lines that come underneath the house.

51:01.635 --> 51:07.737
It's overwhelming because you really feel like you are up against

51:08.837 --> 51:13.121
this huge wall that you can't penetrate.

51:13.201 --> 51:16.884
There's nothing that you can do, and they don't care.

51:19.086 --> 51:24.771
I'm here in Mansfield, Georgia, driving by Meta's new two million square foot data center facility.

51:25.512 --> 51:33.739
Facilities like this are being used to power things like ChatGBT and other AI tools that are becoming integrated into our daily life.

51:34.244 --> 51:36.405
Data centers, gonna be a very hot item.

51:36.886 --> 51:38.147
It ain't AI.

51:38.547 --> 51:40.608
It's not to give you chatbots.

51:41.048 --> 51:42.129
Holy shit.

51:42.329 --> 51:43.050
Stop lying!

51:44.591 --> 51:52.035
There is no way in hell it's about AI for you and chatbots for you that we're building these giant data centers.

51:52.596 --> 51:54.257
Please understand that.

51:54.337 --> 51:57.299
That is absolutely preposterous.

51:59.420 --> 52:00.441
It's preposterous.

52:00.761 --> 52:04.144
Entire supercomputer is built to power Grok.

52:04.364 --> 52:07.826
We see data centers as the most exciting asset class.

52:07.906 --> 52:14.912
Meta is building a two gigawatt plus data center that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.

52:16.953 --> 52:23.578
It ain't for videos, it ain't for AI, unless you're talking about AI for medical and genetic data.

52:23.979 --> 52:24.299
That's it.

52:27.935 --> 52:32.978
The behavioral stuff, the clicking, it's all of smoke and mirrors.

52:33.778 --> 52:39.101
They are building the network that I've described earlier that they do not have yet.

52:39.161 --> 52:45.204
They are building the storage that they do not have yet for a data set that they do not know how big it is yet.

52:50.558 --> 52:59.066
But data centers come with big costs, from light and noise pollution, to the environmental impacts, to the potential rising costs of energy bills.

52:59.506 --> 53:05.452
These facilities put extraordinary demand on the power grid and require entirely new infrastructure.

53:11.923 --> 53:14.305
They should be responsible for that, not us.

53:14.765 --> 53:19.368
Search the internet for profits that Meta has made, Amazon, Microsoft.

53:19.528 --> 53:22.030
They can afford to pay for their own generation.

53:22.370 --> 53:24.471
We came to Georgia to ask two questions.

53:24.791 --> 53:27.273
What's the true cost of the AI revolution?

53:27.833 --> 53:29.314
And who should be paying for it?

53:29.414 --> 53:31.956
It is not the AI revolution.

53:32.136 --> 53:36.159
It is application of machine learning to giant data sets.

53:37.765 --> 53:39.626
It is not the AI revolution.

53:39.907 --> 53:41.107
It is not chat bot.

53:41.207 --> 53:42.188
It is not grok.

53:42.408 --> 53:53.596
It is the building of the necessary infrastructure to collect the genetic and medical data of humankind and to apply a machine learning algorithm to it.

53:53.756 --> 53:59.981
And they don't have anything remotely big enough and fast enough and connected enough to do that yet.

54:00.201 --> 54:04.364
That's gonna take years and they need you to believe it's about other shit.

54:04.384 --> 54:04.784
Trust me.

54:06.678 --> 54:08.319
It's amazing right now.

54:12.522 --> 54:15.924
Your house is here, and the data center is right there.

54:16.044 --> 54:17.665
It's less than 400 yards.

54:19.446 --> 54:27.291
Beverly and Jeff Morris bought their home an hour's drive from downtown Atlanta in 2016, but their roots in the community run much deeper.

54:28.146 --> 54:32.388
Being in the country has always just been my peace and my therapy.

54:33.009 --> 54:36.410
When we found this place, we decided that this was it.

54:36.530 --> 54:37.291
It was perfect.

54:37.411 --> 54:39.872
I was actually raised probably five miles from here.

54:39.892 --> 54:41.453
It felt like coming home.

54:41.473 --> 54:43.634
OK, so I don't need to play this very much longer.

54:43.654 --> 54:44.454
You know what's going to happen.

54:44.474 --> 54:51.438
Their groundwater is wrecked and all stolen by the guys that are running the data center that they needed for cooling.

55:02.293 --> 55:03.174
Oh, is that that one?

55:03.215 --> 55:04.937
Sorry, I gotta go out of here for a second.

55:04.957 --> 55:06.119
I guess I made that wrong.

55:08.523 --> 55:08.683
Yep.

55:12.693 --> 55:13.633
It's interesting, right?

55:13.693 --> 55:15.074
These people were put in place.

55:15.734 --> 55:21.435
Please remember that I'm making the argument, whoops, that, why isn't that already running?

55:22.056 --> 55:30.418
I'm making the argument that these actors were put in place to curate the narrative to make sure that any damage from transfection would be blamed effectively on a novel virus.

55:31.018 --> 55:38.140
And so here we have now, what we have is this guy, I'm gonna get rid of this.

55:38.880 --> 55:56.168
We have this guy on Tucker Carlson who is going to tell us all about the spike protein as if it's 2020 and he's debating with Walter Chestnut and Jessica Rose and Kevin McCairn on a Vajon Health stream.

55:58.029 --> 56:03.011
I mean, really, it's remarkable that a guy can go on Tucker Carlson,

56:04.468 --> 56:17.818
to educate the T-cells to recognize and get down our organization, the BARDA, the DOD, the NIH, the NIAID, all into that room, and it was just me.

56:19.736 --> 56:21.238
And I said, it is time.

56:21.778 --> 56:28.004
It is time for me to reveal to this learned group of leaders about what I'm scared about.

56:29.286 --> 56:36.233
And I spent, I think it was three hours, no slides, just me speaking alone on the stage and all of them in the audience.

56:37.819 --> 56:43.105
When I first started the conversation, the first sentence was, I think COVID is oncogenic.

56:44.586 --> 56:46.889
One of the members of the audience said, that's nonsense.

56:47.489 --> 56:50.032
I think COVID is oncogenic.

56:51.173 --> 56:59.042
And so understand my contention is that this narrative that these people were put in place

57:00.290 --> 57:15.657
to curate a narrative about a gain-of-function virus with lots of special properties that could be like cardiac problems and any other, you know, all these stories were going around, amyloidosis, prion disease, and cancer.

57:16.757 --> 57:21.460
And they had super clowns all over the internet that were pushing these ideas.

57:21.520 --> 57:24.441
And some of those super clowns are still working hard today.

57:26.482 --> 57:30.666
This guy is mentioned in Judy Mikovits book.

57:31.127 --> 57:36.492
This guy took over the Wimber Cancer Center that Robert Malone helped set up.

57:37.593 --> 57:41.837
This guy is a billionaire that owns the LA Times.

57:42.317 --> 57:44.680
This is not random shit.

57:46.417 --> 57:59.885
This is your unique ability because of the biology that you've learned and the mentor change that you've been exposed to, thanks to Mark Kulak and myself, that this is now ridiculously obvious.

58:00.505 --> 58:01.386
We always knew.

58:01.886 --> 58:04.669
We've listened to Tucker Carlson say it over and over again.

58:04.749 --> 58:05.329
He's lied.

58:05.349 --> 58:06.390
He'll probably lie again.

58:06.430 --> 58:07.551
He doesn't want to be a liar.

58:07.591 --> 58:09.413
He thinks it's important not to be a liar.

58:09.834 --> 58:12.156
And he has lots of these people on his show.

58:12.196 --> 58:16.520
Bret Weinstein, Robert Malone, Pierre Kory.

58:16.920 --> 58:23.947
All these people have been interviewed and stuck to the narrative of a novel virus that killed a lot of people, but we've flubbed it up.

58:25.071 --> 58:35.344
And now we've come all the way around on the hamster wheel and we've got this guy with a very warm Captain Sulu-esque voice telling us that he always knew.

58:35.424 --> 58:38.989
He told all these guys a long time ago that it was a oncogenic virus.

58:41.246 --> 58:46.269
and so now the spike protein is gonna, oh my goodness, you know who I heard this from?

58:46.609 --> 58:54.773
Walter Chestnut told me all about p53 a few years ago and now this guy's saying p53, so it must be true.

58:56.634 --> 58:57.375
Stop lying.

58:59.096 --> 59:02.698
Oh man, it's remarkable where we are.

59:03.878 --> 59:05.099
Sorry, I gotta find that button.

59:07.415 --> 59:07.995
Did that not work?

59:08.516 --> 59:09.236
See how that works?

59:09.276 --> 59:10.998
This thing crashes every once in a while.

59:11.718 --> 59:13.439
I gotta see if I can get that going again.

59:14.860 --> 59:15.641
Current slide.

59:17.011 --> 59:19.552
That'll come in and then maybe I can move it forward.

59:19.572 --> 59:20.532
I got to find the spike protein part.

59:20.552 --> 59:21.552
I think everyone can understand.

59:21.632 --> 59:23.853
So, I think I'm in good health.

59:23.873 --> 59:25.533
I am in very robust health.

59:25.553 --> 59:26.094
Did you have COVID?

59:26.154 --> 59:26.394
I did.

59:26.754 --> 59:27.034
Here we go.

59:27.054 --> 59:27.534
How many times?

59:27.874 --> 59:27.994
One.

59:28.694 --> 59:30.495
I never took the virus, I never took the vaccine.

59:30.515 --> 59:31.095
Okay.

59:31.775 --> 59:34.756
Um, but I got COVID.

59:35.436 --> 59:36.736
Knocked me right on my butt.

59:36.997 --> 59:38.657
It was a bad three days.

59:39.097 --> 59:39.337
Fine.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.278
But I don't understand.

59:42.518 --> 59:43.338
You're older than I am.

59:43.898 --> 59:45.539
How did you never get, let's just, I just want to,

59:45.939 --> 59:50.744
Get very specific, like, how did... I mean, everyone on the planet got COVID.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.127
Okay, so let me give you some idea, okay?

59:56.991 --> 59:59.974
One, because we understand the implications.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.098
My wife, Dutchwood, also never got COVID because of both of us.

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:05.639
So this is the story.

01:00:08.362 --> 01:00:16.452
And before he starts, I just want to make sure that you understand that there were a few people in 2020 that were put in place to talk about natural immunity.

01:00:16.973 --> 01:00:23.341
And the few people that were put in place to talk about natural immunity talked about one thing in particular, and that was T cell memory.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:31.063
And it was T-cell memory to other proteins in the virus that overlap with this one.

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.424
For example, the N-protein.

01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:36.286
And lots of people were arguing about that.

01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:42.209
There was even a leaked slide from one of these CDC presentations that talked about N-protein antibodies.

01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:46.311
And so the argument was, is that natural immunity was a thing.

01:00:47.131 --> 01:00:52.574
And by arguing about natural immunity, what unfortunately happens is that you accept that there is a novel thing

01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:56.618
for which previous immunity could be relevant for you.

01:00:58.339 --> 01:01:04.002
And so that story is a lot more complex than they're using a background signal and misconstruing it as novel spread.

01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:07.885
But it's enticing because it kind of makes sense.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:09.526
And oh, now I get it.

01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:19.960
And the really malevolent part is, ladies and gentlemen, is that I was juggling this ball in 2020 when I was still working for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:28.245
And I was trying to explain to some people on staff and on faculty about the spike protein and its unique characteristics.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:34.208
The same bullshit that this guy's pushing on Tucker now, five years later.

01:01:35.848 --> 01:01:55.301
the same guy that is cited in Judy Mikovits' book, the same guy that took over the cancer institute that Robert Malone started, the same guy is connected to all of these actors and is now on the stage, the best stage of this Lollapalooza of actors, this Lollapalooza of liars, Tucker Carlson's show.

01:01:55.701 --> 01:02:01.805
It gets right to the heart of the Steve Bannon populist movement, right-wing bullshit in America.

01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:04.223
It's herding cats.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.708
And this guy is helping these people to herd cats.

01:02:07.748 --> 01:02:13.778
That's why he says in this interview, the God particle a few times, as if that has anything to do with biology at all.

01:02:14.679 --> 01:02:15.801
This guy is remarkable.

01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:24.275
We, by, unfortunately, I relate this, it's a painful thing to me, because I relate it to Kobe's death.

01:02:24.355 --> 01:02:25.696
It was during Kobe's time.

01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:28.198
Kobe, come on!

01:02:28.218 --> 01:02:32.021
At the funeral, Kobe Bryant, who you were close to, correct, very close to.

01:02:32.061 --> 01:02:33.623
Oh my gosh, here we go.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:40.688
At the funeral, at his funeral, all the people in the room, and it was, I think, November.

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:43.791
And I turned to Gavin Newsom and I said, listen,

01:02:45.032 --> 01:02:48.515
This is one virus I'm worried about, because I was studying this virus.

01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:59.684
He turned to Gavin Newsom at Kobe Bryant's funeral and said, this is one virus that I'm especially worried about that I've studied for a long time.

01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:01.806
Stop lying!

01:03:03.027 --> 01:03:04.388
Stop lying!

01:03:05.028 --> 01:03:05.909
I am shocked.

01:03:06.389 --> 01:03:09.052
It is just, I don't know why this thing is goofing.

01:03:09.872 --> 01:03:11.774
I'm getting a lot of goofy shit happening here.

01:03:11.894 --> 01:03:14.496
It won't cue up like I want it to cue up, dang it.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.334
I might have to re-drop that in.

01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:20.815
I just can't believe it.

01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:22.356
I can't believe it.

01:03:24.438 --> 01:03:30.443
I mean, think about that statement, how many names he drops there, and also how many concepts he drops.

01:03:30.483 --> 01:03:35.807
He's trying to say that he knew that this virus was dangerous, that it was oncogenic long before.

01:03:36.728 --> 01:03:39.850
He was the billionaire speaking out at Kobe Bryant's funeral.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.572
Wow.

01:03:46.812 --> 01:03:49.953
You know, I understand HPV very well, and I understand hepatitis.

01:03:50.774 --> 01:03:52.514
I said, this is not a respiratory virus.

01:03:52.534 --> 01:03:54.015
This is a dangerous virus.

01:03:55.636 --> 01:03:57.936
It's not even a respiratory virus, he says.

01:03:58.036 --> 01:03:58.917
Holy shit.

01:03:59.793 --> 01:04:07.078
So I went back and I shut down our organization so that we could actually do nothing else but COVID.

01:04:07.759 --> 01:04:18.287
My entire team of hundreds of scientists on Zoom and everything else around the world, I said, we must go after this virus with a vaccine that clears.

01:04:18.467 --> 01:04:18.847
Nice.

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:20.188
So it's February 2020.

01:04:20.368 --> 01:04:23.230
He says, I'm really afraid of this virus.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.071
I've been studying it.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:24.611
There you go.

01:04:24.711 --> 01:04:25.092
Busted.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.629
Busted, busted, busted.

01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:28.610
Nice work, Jason.

01:04:29.231 --> 01:04:29.791
There you go.

01:04:30.112 --> 01:04:31.493
That's all you need to see.

01:04:31.713 --> 01:04:38.501
Anybody that in February of 2020 was saying this virus, and they understand it, was put in place.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.563
That's exactly the same timing

01:04:41.224 --> 01:04:49.571
the exactly the same timing as a guy like James Lyon Weiner was on podcast telling everybody that he knew all about this virus.

01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:53.855
He's been studying it, you know, he knows all about, what does he call it?

01:04:54.395 --> 01:04:56.817
Antigen enhanced something, something.

01:04:57.338 --> 01:05:00.581
Holy man, can you see it?

01:05:01.181 --> 01:05:04.504
I sure hope you can, because it's not gonna be this visible forever.

01:05:04.704 --> 01:05:05.585
I know that for sure.

01:05:08.456 --> 01:05:15.143
And the only way to clear the virus is to have what we call a T cell, an NK cell, the cells that kill T cells.

01:05:15.384 --> 01:05:17.226
And you must clear the virus already.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:20.249
It's like a multi-layered enchantment of bullshit.

01:05:21.564 --> 01:05:32.153
You accept the virus, you accept it's novel, you accept the mechanism of previous immunity might apply to you, it might not, and so that's a question you have to ask.

01:05:32.573 --> 01:05:42.501
It's just layer after layer of gain-of-function virus bullshit that relies on you accepting all of those premises that are all, all

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:55.370
Presuppose that an RNA molecule, if it has the right combination of bases, could go from a mud puddle to all the white-tailed deer in North America, kill billions and billions of people over the next 10 years.

01:05:57.216 --> 01:05:59.157
This guy is such a puppet, it's a joke.

01:06:16.068 --> 01:06:18.549
So the only vaccine that's important.

01:06:18.629 --> 01:06:22.451
So persistent COVID means that again, we have a novel phenomenon.

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:27.093
It's not chronic fatigue syndrome from having been put on a hospital ventilator.

01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:32.456
It's not chronic fatigue syndrome from having been given supplementary oxygen when it wasn't necessary.

01:06:32.496 --> 01:06:36.698
It's not chronic fatigue syndrome from being in a hospital where that's

01:06:37.677 --> 01:06:40.840
Before the pandemic, that's basically where chronic fatigue came from.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.682
Don't get hospitalized and you don't get it.

01:06:43.422 --> 01:06:45.244
Don't get vaccinated and you don't get it.

01:06:45.324 --> 01:07:03.301
Like chronic fatigue syndrome is a strange phenomenon that before the pandemic, none other than Judy Mikovits had several reiterations of a cure for, at one point in time included being vaccinated to a mouse virus, XMRV, and that that would completely make the vaccine schedule safe.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.821
That lady cites this guy in her book.

01:07:07.881 --> 01:07:08.781
Come on now!

01:07:10.022 --> 01:07:17.264
It's a T-cell vaccine, but that's what I'm telling you, virologists... They had me arguing about a T-cell vaccine in 2020.

01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:23.066
They had Gerd von den Bosch out there saying there is no T-cell immunity to this virus in 2020.

01:07:23.847 --> 01:07:33.030
How is it possible that all these little rungs of the hamster wheel are coming up right in order again, other than if it is a hamster wheel?

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:40.678
And every time the wheel turns, you think you're becoming more familiar with reality, when in reality, you're becoming more familiar with the wheel.

01:07:45.202 --> 01:07:48.604
Think about antibodies versus cellular therapy.

01:07:49.045 --> 01:07:53.088
It's foreign to them to have a vaccine that stimulates T cells.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.804
So I understand that internally.

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:10.223
It's so weird since in 20 minutes you... It's just so dumb because you can't get antibodies without stimulating T-cells unless the basic map of the immune system is completely bunk, which I'm open to.

01:08:11.374 --> 01:08:23.619
But if you accept what most textbooks, what most summaries of the immune system say, you can't get to antibodies as a model of immunity without activating the T-cells that are upstream from the B-cells.

01:08:24.139 --> 01:08:28.101
So this whole concept of a T-cell vaccine is, stop lying.

01:08:31.782 --> 01:08:33.323
It's just nonsense.

01:08:36.351 --> 01:08:40.415
And it's bullshittery because they were talking about this shit in 2020.

01:08:41.556 --> 01:08:45.539
Somebody even asked me if we should start a company that makes T cell vaccines.

01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:46.520
I shit you not.

01:08:50.764 --> 01:08:54.007
You explained it to me, not particularly high IQ, not a scientist.

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:55.428
I understand exactly what you're saying.

01:08:56.169 --> 01:08:59.392
Why don't, why isn't it obvious to virologists

01:09:00.575 --> 01:09:12.123
Why isn't that like day one lesson in virology school that the T cells, the cells that protect you against all potential internal harm, they're the key?

01:09:12.603 --> 01:09:14.944
Because every vaccine so far is antibody-based.

01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:17.206
Dogma.

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:21.794
And he smiles and now Fauci bad.

01:09:21.854 --> 01:09:31.841
And here we go with now a dumb, simple and stupid, complicated explanation for his magic that uses the word bio shield and all this other crap.

01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:38.645
And they're going to talk about how the spike protein is oncogenic and hits the P53 gene and yada, yada, yada.

01:09:38.665 --> 01:09:39.546
It's all nonsense.

01:09:40.393 --> 01:10:05.644
It's all a pre-written script that people like Jessica Rose, people like Walter Chestnut, people like Kevin McCairn, people, all these people, Richard Fleming, the list is almost endless of people that were seeded this narrative, wittingly or unwittingly, they did podcasts about it, they thought they had added to their knowledge and they went and argued about it.

01:10:06.104 --> 01:10:09.626
And most of them should know by now that this is just ridiculous.

01:10:10.762 --> 01:10:25.614
I mean, even if you go on Twitter right now, you can find someone named Walter Chestnut who posted today his whole series of tweets about how the spike protein is a unique agonist for nicotinic receptors.

01:10:26.915 --> 01:10:28.276
What I did my PhD on.

01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:34.327
The whole problem with that is, is that where is this high-fidelity spike protein coming from?

01:10:34.387 --> 01:10:35.508
What is producing it?

01:10:35.568 --> 01:10:36.829
Why is it still here?

01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:54.644
Even if the original spike protein found in Wuhan reported by Shengxi Li was a spectacular stimulator of the nicotinic receptors in our lungs, it is impossible that that same spike protein would be here now if its transmission mechanism is RNA.

01:10:56.105 --> 01:10:57.146
It's impossible!

01:10:59.062 --> 01:11:00.203
And yet we're to believe that.

01:11:01.444 --> 01:11:02.544
These people all believe it.

01:11:02.645 --> 01:11:03.405
He believes it.

01:11:04.286 --> 01:11:26.982
The other thing that he is transforming us into believing, infecting us into believing, bamboozling us into believing, with slave speak, is that the mRNA vaccines, the mRNA transfections that were put in us, reliably produce a high-fidelity protein that has all these beautiful

01:11:28.064 --> 01:11:44.487
know attributes it's folded correctly oh my gosh it works great it's like perfect so the the the idea that transfection works is accepted the idea that it's a gain-of-function virus that can cause cancer accepted

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:47.289
The idea that PCR tests for this virus?

01:11:47.449 --> 01:11:47.969
Accepted.

01:11:48.329 --> 01:11:51.211
The idea that they have millions of sequences of this virus?

01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:52.132
Accepted.

01:11:52.552 --> 01:11:57.395
That's the whole effect of such a bullshit show that was just put on last week.

01:11:57.455 --> 01:11:59.076
How is it possible that we are here?

01:11:59.756 --> 01:12:05.320
Other than by malevolent design, we are being slow rolled into this trap.

01:12:07.722 --> 01:12:09.743
Because it's about the Human Genome Project.

01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:14.607
It's for all the marbles.

01:12:14.927 --> 01:12:16.288
It's for our grandchildren.

01:12:17.568 --> 01:12:37.254
They need them to accept this narrative, this biology, this bullshit, this cocked up response to a pandemic, this screwed up administration, this revaluing gold, or canceling the national debt, or some other thing that will crash the dollar.

01:12:38.295 --> 01:12:39.255
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:46.498
Your grandchildren are about to be enslaved and if you don't wake up to it right now, it's not, it's going to happen.

01:12:46.938 --> 01:13:00.645
You've got to understand that there is such a difference between injection and ingestion that it's almost absurd that we have ever thought, ever been able to be led to believe that intramuscular injection is medicine in some cases.

01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:06.948
I cannot find, no one has presented me with evidence that there is an example of that.

01:13:07.927 --> 01:13:10.450
after almost a year and a half of saying it.

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:24.866
The only thing they have at every pharmaceutical company that's ever made a protein biologic that for everyone from Jonathan Engler to Mike Eden could have explained to you in 2020 because they worked for pharmaceutical companies, his recombinant

01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:26.007
Genetics.

01:13:26.548 --> 01:13:28.809
Synthetic recombinant genetics.

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:31.070
What does this mean in layman terms?

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:34.772
It means that they can make a lot of quantities of pure DNA.

01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:36.553
And they can use it for things.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:38.193
They can transform stuff.

01:13:38.574 --> 01:13:39.834
They can transfect things.

01:13:40.214 --> 01:13:45.237
And in theory, using a simple enzymatic reaction, they could make a lot of pure RNA.

01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:46.778
Or almost pure RNA.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.041
That's it.

01:13:48.402 --> 01:13:50.006
And it's not a new technology.

01:13:50.066 --> 01:13:51.730
It's not something they had to figure out.

01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:57.343
They have been trying and trying and trying to make it cheaper and better for 20 years.

01:14:00.026 --> 01:14:02.548
It is the heart of the sequencing reaction.

01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:07.752
PCR is the heart of all of this stuff, including the diagnostics that are fraud.

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:24.464
And even if there are applications where PCR works as a diagnostic, the rigorous requirements for that to happen were not met by any of the EUA products that define this pandemic and hid the murder behind fraud.

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:38.834
And so a synthetic recombinant peer signal in quantity, meaning a lot of it, you don't even need this much, could have been seeded in Wuhan and anywhere else they wanted to find it as evidence of a spread.

01:14:39.394 --> 01:14:51.078
If that synthetic recombinant peer signal overlapped in any way with an existing background, then that means that it would have been so simple for them to misconstrue spread.

01:14:51.818 --> 01:14:54.179
Now, why would they seed such a crazy narrative?

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:57.840
Well, because transfection was never going to make it through the FDA.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:04.482
Transfection and a personalized application of it to you was never going to make it through the FDA.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:12.204
So they needed to get transfection past the FDA, kind of like grandfathered in because we used it and it seems to have worked.

01:15:12.524 --> 01:15:14.384
So why reevaluate it anymore?

01:15:14.424 --> 01:15:15.465
And that's where we are.

01:15:15.525 --> 01:15:17.785
They got there with a very simple trick.

01:15:17.825 --> 01:15:19.486
They just put out a lot of placebos.

01:15:20.146 --> 01:15:37.997
In fact, the more I think and read and reevaluate, it seems very likely that the criminal vaccine schedule in America where you have like 70 doses before you're 18, if you follow the recommendations, cannot be all live doses or we wouldn't have any kids anymore.

01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:43.526
Ladies and gentlemen, I really think they're lying to us about so much.

01:15:44.107 --> 01:15:54.300
If you want to start somewhere neutral, start with the word endemic and understand that an RNA molecule cannot go from a single good copy with some magic parts

01:15:54.901 --> 01:15:55.922
to endemic.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.343
It's not possible.

01:15:58.104 --> 01:16:00.887
Endemicity of a molecule is just not possible.

01:16:00.927 --> 01:16:04.370
Ladies and gentlemen, they misconstrued a background by using nonspecific tests.

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.031
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:06.932
You want to know the truth?

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:08.974
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:16:09.374 --> 01:16:10.936
Transfection was always a crime.

01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:14.399
And the population pyramid problem needed managing and they did it.

01:16:14.479 --> 01:16:15.240
That's what they did it.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.181
They're still doing it.

01:16:20.606 --> 01:16:21.826
Thank you very much for being here.

01:16:23.266 --> 01:16:26.747
Like I said, Monday, we're going to bring a new level to this.

01:16:27.287 --> 01:16:28.647
We're starting Biology 101.

01:16:28.788 --> 01:16:29.708
I'm really excited.

01:16:31.568 --> 01:16:35.809
Yeah, I'm really, really happy about this plan to move forward.

01:16:36.329 --> 01:16:37.609
It's going to be a lot of development.

01:16:38.249 --> 01:16:40.050
It's going to be some study halls to start.

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:43.990
I want to bring everybody up to speed in a good way.

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.271
I don't want to just start, here it is, here it is.

01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:53.694
I think it's good for us to all, you know, come down out of this mist together.

01:16:54.455 --> 01:16:58.597
And so I don't want anybody to feel like you're being yanked out of a moving truck.

01:16:59.778 --> 01:17:04.481
I want you to feel like, you know, you're being welcomed into somebody's home.

01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:06.642
I think that's the way we should do it.

01:17:07.642 --> 01:17:08.743
Thank you very much for being here.

01:17:08.803 --> 01:17:10.604
Thank you very much for all of your support.

01:17:10.645 --> 01:17:15.208
The people that subscribe, the people that give one time, the people that send brisket.

01:17:16.328 --> 01:17:19.010
I'm actually about to go up and eat some of that right now, I think.

01:17:19.671 --> 01:17:25.375
And, I don't know, the books, the $10 bills.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:27.296
Thank you very much for all of this.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.838
And we're not making a killing here.

01:17:30.858 --> 01:17:40.120
I don't want you to feel bad for us, but my accountant felt bad for us because this is our worst year during the pandemic.

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.861
And technically speaking, he said, we now are living below the poverty line.

01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:49.122
So hey, putting it all on the line for the truth of biology.

01:17:49.182 --> 01:17:54.404
I hope that Monday, the start of biology 101 will change some people's mind about support.

01:17:55.344 --> 01:18:02.630
and maybe soon we can organize something where a non-profit can start to produce a textbook or produce a curriculum and a textbook.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.812
Again, thank you very much for being here.

01:18:05.132 --> 01:18:06.153
I'm trying my best.

01:18:06.853 --> 01:18:07.234
See you soon.
