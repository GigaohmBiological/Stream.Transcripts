02:17.458 --> 02:20.983
Little ditty about Jack and Diane.

02:21.003 --> 02:25.069
Two American kids growing up in the heartland.

02:26.410 --> 02:30.176
Jackie gonna be a football star.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.101
Diane's debutante backseat of Jackie's car.

02:44.892 --> 03:09.034
Suckin' on a chili dog, outside the taste freeze Diane sittin' on Jackie's lap, got his hands between her knees Jackie say, hey Diane, they're tryin' all behind the shade of trees Dribble off those Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please, say Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill

03:14.343 --> 03:20.462
Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone.

03:20.502 --> 03:21.244
They walk on.

03:40.285 --> 03:43.706
Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment.

03:44.826 --> 03:48.047
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean.

03:49.467 --> 03:53.228
Well, then there, Diane, you ought to run off to city.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.908
Diane says, baby, you ain't missing a thing.

03:57.008 --> 04:05.830
But Jackie say, oh, yeah, life goes on long after the thrill of living

04:08.356 --> 04:36.170
Oh yeah, let's see life goes on Long after the thrill of living is gone So let it rock, let it roll Let the Bible bell come and save my soul Hold on to 16 as long as you can

04:37.995 --> 04:52.621
Changes come around real soon, make us women and men Oh yeah, life goes on

05:05.680 --> 05:27.472
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone Oh yeah, they say life goes on Long after the thrill of livin' is gone A little ditty about Jack and Diane Two American kids doin' the best that they can

05:58.319 --> 06:05.364
a test that could detect a virus when the virus wasn't present.

06:05.984 --> 06:13.389
And in addition to that, he didn't have virus, coronavirus, COVID-19 to work with, right?

06:13.709 --> 06:18.192
He was drawing the sequencing from a computer database.

06:18.572 --> 06:19.453
Is all of that correct?

06:20.749 --> 06:31.317
Yes, I would say he had an intention to pick up the virus when it was present, but in his design, he admitted that he couldn't do a very good job with it.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.177
Stop lying!

06:32.197 --> 06:34.059
And that it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

06:34.319 --> 06:37.241
And that it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

06:37.541 --> 06:44.746
And when you say pick up, you mean that it would indicate, return a positive, if there were other coronaviruses.

06:44.826 --> 06:46.848
And for the layperson, I didn't know this either,

06:47.344 --> 06:48.545
Everything is a coronavirus.

06:48.625 --> 06:54.007
I mean, things, I don't mean that, but many cold viruses are also called coronavirus.

06:54.047 --> 07:04.672
In fact, COVID-19, it sounded so exotic and scary when we first learned about it, coronavirus, but many, many ordinary cold viruses are coronaviruses.

07:05.012 --> 07:05.773
Is that correct?

07:05.893 --> 07:06.253
It's correct.

07:16.923 --> 07:19.324
Yes, it's an anti-vax channel.

07:19.364 --> 07:20.444
Welcome to the show.

07:20.564 --> 07:21.924
It's an anti-vax channel for sure.

07:21.944 --> 07:23.024
I think truth is good for kids.

07:23.465 --> 07:27.305
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

07:27.766 --> 07:29.406
We want everybody to feel good.

07:30.326 --> 07:31.766
That's not the way life is.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.767
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:36.408 --> 07:38.128
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:39.978 --> 07:40.679
And I have lied.

07:40.699 --> 07:41.759
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:41.779 --> 07:42.680
I don't want to lie.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.541
I don't think I'm a liar.

07:44.642 --> 07:45.662
I try not to be a liar.

07:45.702 --> 07:46.563
I don't want to be a liar.

07:47.123 --> 07:49.885
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

07:52.067 --> 08:02.795
Introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic

08:11.027 --> 08:20.253
means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:20.273 --> 08:29.919
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

08:33.601 --> 08:39.225
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

08:39.932 --> 08:52.140
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus, and okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.382
It's just a big hassle in the end.

08:56.423 --> 09:10.760
No, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75% mortality, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

09:10.820 --> 09:13.323
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

09:15.700 --> 09:19.843
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

09:20.183 --> 09:24.546
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

09:24.766 --> 09:31.031
I'm afraid that the latest data... Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

09:31.511 --> 09:33.172
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

09:33.192 --> 09:38.236
Isolation, what was it?

09:38.276 --> 09:39.797
Isolation and purification.

09:41.638 --> 09:42.299
Of the virus?

09:43.902 --> 09:54.950
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

09:55.611 --> 10:00.474
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

10:01.275 --> 10:02.756
I don't understand what the issue.

10:02.796 --> 10:02.916
I see.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.077
No, it depends on how they use it.

10:12.628 --> 10:15.411
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

10:17.954 --> 10:19.896
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

10:19.957 --> 10:25.983
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

10:26.064 --> 10:28.086
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

10:33.888 --> 10:34.308
so so

11:31.147 --> 11:32.148
I think I screwed that up.

11:32.268 --> 11:38.254
I advanced that slide just a bit too early and then it fell over on the front line instead of the last frame.

11:38.854 --> 11:40.275
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

11:40.295 --> 11:44.239
We're here again to try and dispel a little bit more of this enchantment.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.943
I really appreciate everybody in the chat coming to bat for me.

11:49.764 --> 11:51.025
It's not really necessary.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.427
These people come and go.

11:53.627 --> 12:03.229
The people that are really here to find out what's going on and find out what we're trying to do will have the patience to get through the intro because they will have checked on another channel.

12:03.289 --> 12:13.252
It's not like we haven't been putting out videos for four years and you can't just look along that unblemished record of integrity and find a video and figure out what we're doing here.

12:14.252 --> 12:20.855
Any obfuscation or silliness in the chat is just either naivety or messing with us.

12:20.875 --> 12:21.695
So don't worry about it.

12:21.735 --> 12:26.197
I mean, just enjoy the fact that we've met each other again here this morning.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.258
It's almost not morning anymore here in Pittsburgh.

12:29.298 --> 12:29.798
It's 1135.

12:30.398 --> 12:31.259
I'm a little late.

12:31.999 --> 12:35.880
Your consciousness remains the prime real estate that everybody's competing for.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.602
The main messages of this channel are really hard to find.

12:40.582 --> 12:42.803
Some of them are on this screen here.

12:42.843 --> 12:45.785
There was no evidence of spread in New York City.

12:46.545 --> 12:52.227
Infectious clones is the only real concept you need to understand in order to understand the illusion of virology.

12:52.808 --> 12:57.230
Placebo batches were likely distributed and that's why they got us focused on bad batches.

12:58.391 --> 13:02.394
And transfection in healthy mammals has always been dumb.

13:02.474 --> 13:12.703
The idea that someone would come into the chat and kind of make light of the idea that we're calling these transfections will be brought into sharp focus today.

13:13.784 --> 13:15.305
with a little journal club we're gonna do.

13:15.765 --> 13:21.007
The protocols were definitely murder, just nobody wants to talk about supplemental oxygen as being the on-ramp.

13:21.867 --> 13:25.548
Gain of Function is a mythology that they want us to teach our children.

13:26.048 --> 13:32.850
The Scooby-Doo mystery is real, we were fooled into solving it, and the spectacular commitment to lies is what got us to fall for it.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.316
There are other ways to say this.

13:37.557 --> 13:46.965
Weaponized piles of money convinced us to argue about the origins of the virus, and participating in that argument accepted the premise of the novel virus, and we're still being governed by this theater today.

13:47.646 --> 13:48.626
It's another way to say it.

13:51.249 --> 13:59.836
And because it's so easy to say now, the only thing left is to attribute bad motives to the people who disagree with it, like me.

14:01.141 --> 14:07.323
And that's what you see happening on Twitter and everywhere and anywhere anybody engages with some idea of mine.

14:07.443 --> 14:09.704
It's not about the idea, it becomes about me.

14:10.405 --> 14:18.288
And so I challenge these people to take a screenshot of the words on the screen and then respond to the words.

14:19.088 --> 14:20.168
And they just don't do it.

14:20.449 --> 14:26.651
They just don't do it because there is no response to the biological truth other than the affirmative.

14:26.991 --> 14:31.433
They don't want to talk about this elephant in the room, if you will.

14:33.113 --> 14:41.877
This idea that they want to use AI to solve the genome and all of humanity's problems is something that goes back to Lederberg.

14:41.897 --> 14:44.398
It goes back to the Department of Energy.

14:47.085 --> 14:51.947
And that's what Mark Kulak has brought to my attention over a couple years of work.

14:53.127 --> 14:59.269
One of the first videos I ever caught of him was about Bob Barr or William Barr or whatever the hell his name is.

14:59.489 --> 15:00.870
I think it's William Barr, Bill Barr.

15:01.912 --> 15:09.754
And we've lost sight of how long we have had charlatans have power over us.

15:10.194 --> 15:11.855
It's been more than a generation.

15:11.915 --> 15:19.397
Our parents were also lost in their narrative, a narrative that was largely governed by top secret.

15:20.305 --> 15:26.390
programs, the special virus cancer program, nuclear weapons, this kind of thing.

15:26.951 --> 15:30.254
And this is all one big national security show.

15:30.674 --> 15:34.958
If these people aren't active participants, they are unwitting participants.

15:34.998 --> 15:38.261
They are look-the-other-way participants.

15:38.321 --> 15:41.904
They are, you know, the look-away doctrine type.

15:41.964 --> 15:42.845
Well, don't tell me.

15:42.905 --> 15:43.625
I don't need to know.

15:43.746 --> 15:44.186
I'll do it.

15:44.466 --> 15:45.067
No problem.

15:46.144 --> 15:47.786
And they are traitors to our children.

15:47.826 --> 15:56.634
And if we're going to make gentle the life of this world for our kids, as we transition out of their mythology, we're going to have to see them for what they are.

15:57.074 --> 16:00.277
And we're going to have to teach our children how this illusion is created.

16:00.757 --> 16:08.545
This illusion of consensus on social media that probably exists on Facebook, but I wouldn't know, but also exists on Telegram and on Twitter.

16:09.205 --> 16:25.535
and on Gab and on Discord and all of these places where groups of people think they're getting together and having a spontaneous conversation when in reality, unless you see it for what it is, a coordinated group of liars, you won't be able to successfully navigate the wave.

16:26.616 --> 16:33.022
But it's an artificial wave of consensus, just like that wave was artificially generated moving away from the deep water.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.763
It's a wave of consensus.

16:35.304 --> 16:36.965
Not everybody's going to be able to surf it.

16:37.025 --> 16:39.727
Not all kids are going to be able to see it for what it is.

16:39.807 --> 16:43.291
Not all university students are saveable.

16:43.891 --> 17:05.172
But the ones that are savable, I do believe one of the most reliable lifelines is staying focused on the biology and teaching people not to take that multi-liar, multi-performer bait on social media and to start loving their real live neighbors, the ones they can talk to, the ones they can email, the ones they can call.

17:06.681 --> 17:13.628
It's especially a message to Western world and the United States in particular because that's where my roots are.

17:14.849 --> 17:19.895
My father served in the Navy and married a Filipino girl, brought her back to the United States.

17:19.975 --> 17:23.358
And the joke is that I was made in the Philippines and born in the United States.

17:24.199 --> 17:27.120
And so I am an American kid, and that's all I got.

17:27.801 --> 17:32.323
I'm one of these multiracial Americans that I think a lot of these elites think are garbage.

17:32.783 --> 17:34.704
And that's why I will never be elevated.

17:35.244 --> 17:38.445
No one's ever going to pay attention to me spontaneously.

17:38.926 --> 17:44.468
And Peter Thiel and his minions are never going to put me in the face of your family and friends spontaneously.

17:44.548 --> 17:46.509
So I need your help.

17:47.049 --> 17:48.090
You've got to spread the word.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.571
If you don't spread the word, no one else is going to find this stuff.

17:50.631 --> 17:52.172
And I'm going to be a secret that you keep.

17:53.413 --> 18:05.044
If you want to support me, one of the best ways to do it would be to share this work because every once in a while somebody finds this stream and is inspired to financially support and we don't need a lot of that.

18:06.549 --> 18:11.192
I'm not trying to become the next American Idol or the next Joe Rogan.

18:11.212 --> 18:14.734
I'm not trying to get 100 million followers on Spotify.

18:14.954 --> 18:16.294
I just want to be a teacher.

18:16.715 --> 18:24.919
And I want to be able to put my whole heart and soul into this without having to worry about how my kids are going to eat or how we're going to pay rent.

18:25.519 --> 18:26.300
That's all I want.

18:26.380 --> 18:33.784
And I don't think that's very much to ask when we are in a world of multi-billionaires and many of them who were created during this pandemic.

18:35.347 --> 18:41.529
and a dissident operation that's made from people that haven't suffered.

18:41.549 --> 18:48.551
If you just drop your eyes, drop your hand from your face, drop your phone and look up these people, none of them have suffered.

18:49.212 --> 18:59.455
If they lost their job, they started as an entrepreneur and now they're super successful with the support of a supplement company or three sponsors.

19:01.411 --> 19:06.534
The only way to see through this is to engage in united non-compliance, and it's gotta be informed.

19:06.574 --> 19:11.318
You gotta be able to out-reason these people, and that way you need to learn the biology.

19:11.378 --> 19:13.439
So, I think we gotta do some homework today.

19:13.879 --> 19:14.580
Welcome to the show.

19:21.617 --> 19:21.857
So

19:43.863 --> 19:50.088
It is the 9th of January, July.

19:50.108 --> 19:51.209
What am I talking about?

19:51.249 --> 19:52.110
The 9th of July, 2024.

19:52.150 --> 19:56.333
I was actually caught up in the comment from Endless Current.

19:57.814 --> 20:02.198
Me being a Native American has been a problem since way before I had long hair.

20:02.718 --> 20:09.784
When I was a teenager, I had a crew cut all through high school and was very serious about basketball, but I was also a lifeguard.

20:10.244 --> 20:12.006
And so I would sit out on the,

20:12.546 --> 20:19.590
the shore of a lake in Wisconsin or on the shore of a river in my hometown and lifeguard for like three kids.

20:20.390 --> 20:23.131
And in the sun all day, I turned very dark.

20:23.732 --> 20:28.294
And so there were lots of speculation about where I came from as a kid.

20:28.334 --> 20:32.997
And one of the main speculations because of my height was that I was Native American.

20:33.337 --> 20:35.578
And that is definitely not true.

20:36.358 --> 20:41.561
My mom is Filipino and Indian, and my dad is a tall white man from Wisconsin who served in the Navy.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.024
And I'm the result of that partnership.

20:47.325 --> 20:48.746
I am a human just like you.

20:48.806 --> 20:52.248
I went to high school in a very small town in Northern Wisconsin.

20:52.728 --> 20:53.609
I went to prom.

20:53.709 --> 20:56.311
I went to a dance called Snowball every year.

20:57.692 --> 21:04.316
We had a very small conference of schools that we had to ride around in a bus to go play.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.537
Sometimes the bus ride could be as long as 45 minutes.

21:09.159 --> 21:16.084
It was a little bit like the movie Hoosiers with regard to basketball because everybody went to these away games and they were packed.

21:16.544 --> 21:20.927
And it was the thing that was happening that week on a Friday and where were we playing.

21:20.987 --> 21:29.994
And when I was a junior in high school, we were actually ranked second in the state in class C high school, right up until the playoffs.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.295
And then in our first playoff game, we lost.

21:33.456 --> 21:36.438
So it was a extremely humbling moment.

21:37.059 --> 21:40.561
I was playing with a group of seniors that were just killer.

21:41.122 --> 21:46.305
And then there were about five of us juniors, two of which had been already playing varsity.

21:46.325 --> 21:51.889
And then me and a couple other friends of mine all grew to be about six foot five in the same year.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.492
And so we had this incredible team that like was 6'4", 6'5", 6'5", 6'5", 6'6", 6'6", 6'5", 6'6".

21:55.512 --> 21:57.053
And it was all juniors and seniors.

22:02.657 --> 22:03.738
we won a lot of games.

22:03.798 --> 22:06.940
I think we won 11 in a row at one point or more.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.721
It was a really fun year.

22:10.782 --> 22:16.946
And so I lived the ideal American teenage years.

22:17.006 --> 22:21.448
I mean, you know, there is no crime in Kadat, Wisconsin when I was growing up.

22:21.488 --> 22:27.272
And I grew up in the same hometown that my dad grew up in, and everybody knew my dad from when he was a child.

22:27.432 --> 22:30.874
And so I had a lot of his high school teachers, like I am

22:32.028 --> 22:33.892
without wanting to sound too hardcore.

22:33.972 --> 22:35.335
I'm American as they come.

22:35.696 --> 22:36.859
That's all I've got.

22:37.871 --> 22:39.732
is me being an American.

22:39.752 --> 22:41.433
I don't have any other identity.

22:42.274 --> 22:48.817
And so when I say that I'm fighting for America and I'm fighting for my kid's future, that's exactly what I mean.

22:48.897 --> 22:53.500
I'm fighting for the America of the old school NPR.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.022
You remember when the rest of the story was on the radio?

22:58.122 --> 22:59.803
I don't even mean national public radio.

22:59.843 --> 23:05.887
I just mean the public radio of America, the radio of America, where there would be syndicated programs that we all heard.

23:06.656 --> 23:09.879
That's what I grew up in the America that I grew up.

23:10.159 --> 23:23.130
And so I know we can't go back to it, but we can definitely remember it as a time when we weren't so worked up about these ideas that mean nothing like racism, et cetera.

23:23.190 --> 23:26.353
When I was growing up, racism was basically over.

23:26.934 --> 23:28.495
And the idea of racism,

23:29.776 --> 23:38.559
did not have the connotations that it has now where it implies this systemic flaw and this generational debt that people have to other people.

23:39.460 --> 23:45.902
And this extraordinary place that we are in in our cultural history can be brought to a screeching halt

23:46.642 --> 23:48.343
if we just teach people the truth.

23:48.783 --> 23:50.264
And so I'm a human just like you.

23:50.324 --> 23:58.249
I got sucked into a lot of these liars' performances over the last four years and got sucked into believing that there was a mystery to solve.

23:58.269 --> 24:04.353
If we can teach our family and friends how this happened to us, then they also might be able to see how it happened to them.

24:06.138 --> 24:29.645
There are some truths that none of these people will discuss, and if I'm being blocked by doctors, it's because they don't want to have to pay attention to the absolute bedrock message of this stream, which I will continue to repeat every day, probably until I retire, which is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

24:30.545 --> 24:33.286
A sort of caveat or a, what did they call that?

24:35.111 --> 24:41.954
A corollary of that is the statement, transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent.

24:41.994 --> 24:42.835
And it always was.

24:42.895 --> 24:55.901
And there's actually thousands of professional biologists in America and professional healthcare people that should have done known better because the word transfection has been around for a few years.

24:56.881 --> 24:58.142
RNA cannot pandemic.

24:59.183 --> 24:59.803
And we know that.

25:01.986 --> 25:15.917
I really think we know that from all the molecular biology that we've done on the bench, we know that RNA is not capable of doing that any more than if you have a notebook of carbon paper, that that could result in the distribution of a newspaper.

25:16.017 --> 25:18.179
I understand that when you write on that,

25:18.679 --> 25:28.308
that paper, it makes another copy on the next page, but that sort of limited ability to make an instant copy of your writing is not going to translate too well.

25:28.769 --> 25:38.298
If you make that carbon the right way, and you use the right combination of paper, it could be enough to distribute your work everywhere on earth.

25:40.353 --> 25:53.319
And that's the level of exaggeration that I think is equivalent to saying that an RNA, if it has the right combination of HIV inserts or furin cleavage sites, that it could go around the earth with high fidelity for five years.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.280
It's absolutely ridiculous.

25:57.389 --> 26:04.952
And so I've been trying to spend the last couple years now trying to teach everyone or convince everyone that the alien that I've seen is real.

26:05.032 --> 26:15.977
And one of the aspects of the alien that I think is most apt in terms of trying to get a handle on things is the idea that I was hired by Bobby Kennedy, by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:16.037 --> 26:17.818
to help him write his Wuhan cover-up book.

26:18.318 --> 26:27.148
And during the course of that year and one month of working for him, I came to realize that weaponized piles of money had convinced us to argue about the origins of the novel virus.

26:27.188 --> 26:30.592
And that argument alone made us accept the existence of it.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.995
And there actually wasn't very much evidence for the existence of it.

26:34.396 --> 26:38.540
And in fact, a lot of the arguments that the no-virus people were making were very strong.

26:39.321 --> 26:45.524
And as I started to pivot through this cognitive space of, wait a minute, if there was no virus, then what are they doing?

26:45.564 --> 26:47.425
Did they murder people and just lie about it?

26:47.885 --> 26:50.866
Once we got there, I was person non grata.

26:51.026 --> 27:04.592
And instead of being treated as what I physically am, which is the first listed expert in the acknowledgements of that book, I'm treated as if I don't exist by all of these people.

27:05.768 --> 27:18.911
And the reason why is because all of these people are part of this theater that spans from mainstream media all the way to social media where they create this illusion of consensus with podcasts and they're harmonizing on it.

27:21.052 --> 27:22.732
Harmonizing on the mythology.

27:26.393 --> 27:33.995
And so that's why I always show this slide multiple times a day because Noam Chomsky told us how they do it.

27:35.117 --> 27:46.815
And before Noam Chomsky, there was a guy by the name of Edward Bernays in the 1920s that told us how they do it, back when they didn't have the social media access to our brains that they have now.

27:48.017 --> 27:50.600
And so without a doubt, this guy is right.

27:52.079 --> 27:54.281
Without a doubt, this guy was telling us the truth.

27:54.321 --> 27:56.862
He just didn't tell you the truth that this is everywhere.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.984
This is how they control congressmen.

27:59.024 --> 28:07.490
This is how they control people on the internet that don't know they're part of the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

28:07.550 --> 28:10.052
They just think I got lucky and got a sponsor.

28:10.652 --> 28:16.895
They just think that I got lucky and people are sticking up for me, that I get to get interviewed in places.

28:16.935 --> 28:23.458
And so I better keep saying what I'm saying because it feels like this is the right thing to say because everybody's telling me it's the right thing to say.

28:23.838 --> 28:32.502
And so whether you're wittingly participating in the conscious and intelligent manipulation of our thoughts, or whether you're unwittingly participating, you are participating.

28:33.649 --> 28:38.991
And that's what we need to teach our children so that they themselves do not participate.

28:39.051 --> 28:44.653
They themselves are not bamboozled even by people who don't know they're participating.

28:45.234 --> 28:58.639
Like all the people that think that their Twitch stream on Twitch that talks about video games or that because they dress up and groom horses on camera live are actually stars and influencers.

28:59.929 --> 29:06.697
when really what they are are unwitting participants in the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions.

29:07.238 --> 29:15.588
Particularly, a lot of these people are manipulating the intelligent attention of these people so that their opinions are useless.

29:17.022 --> 29:39.080
If you spend all your day following Twitch channels that argue about different games or are really pretty or whatever, then you're wasting hours of your day where you could be learning, where you could be teaching your kid, where you could be making useful connections with the people around you, or where you could, I don't know, be doing something useful for your community or for yourself.

29:41.308 --> 29:47.931
That's why there's a international gathering called TwitchCon or something like that, where everybody goes and talks to other streamers.

29:50.272 --> 29:59.716
There aren't very many streamers on Twitch that actually have a message or would like to be a biology teacher, but can't because the internet is full of frauds.

30:03.858 --> 30:04.959
That's the reality of it.

30:06.308 --> 30:18.102
And that's why once you start to see it and then you go back to look at 2020 and you realize that someone like a college dropout, Kevin McKernan, multi-millionaire,

30:19.025 --> 30:29.612
who took IP from the Human Genome Project and created multi-generational wealth for his family, whose father was involved in microarray technology before he got into biotech.

30:30.292 --> 30:36.196
He claims he lifted himself up by his bootstraps to become the Pot Genome King, but that's not true.

30:36.236 --> 30:37.077
His father was in

30:37.757 --> 30:39.058
in with this group of people.

30:39.218 --> 30:51.085
And in particular, because it's microarrays and sequencing stuff, he was in with the DOD crowd or the DOE crowd that Mark Usatonic has been telling us about, bringing to our attention.

30:54.107 --> 31:03.731
And the fact of the matter is, is that he was present in April, he was present in May, he was present in December, and he never usefully questioned the narrative.

31:03.771 --> 31:08.473
He never usefully questioned the possibility that maybe they're just murdering people in hospitals and lying about it.

31:08.533 --> 31:12.475
No, no, there's definitely a novel virus, but novels shouldn't be capitalized.

31:12.515 --> 31:14.356
That was his main objective.

31:14.396 --> 31:15.696
That was his main statement.

31:15.997 --> 31:19.038
We shouldn't capitalize novel because it's not as novel as they say it is.

31:22.168 --> 31:24.510
And they are misleading our young adults.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.791
They are misleading our young parents.

31:26.831 --> 31:32.676
They are misleading our college kids over the last five years, almost completely successfully now.

31:33.676 --> 31:36.779
We have very little time left to wake these people up.

31:38.060 --> 31:46.926
I'm thinking less than a year before a series of events will happen that will make 2020 too far away to get anybody to want to look at it anymore.

31:47.687 --> 31:49.448
It only is going to take one big tragedy.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.680
These people are really traitors to our children.

31:54.760 --> 32:02.085
Brett Weinstein could have called this transfection anytime he wanted to in 2021 because I was insisting that he do it.

32:03.506 --> 32:16.716
Evidence is present in his podcast record because at least once, Heather Haying, his wife, said on screen that I'm the one who told them, insisted that they should call it transfection, and she agreed.

32:16.836 --> 32:19.318
But then they never changed their lingo at all.

32:20.225 --> 32:24.588
And here he is two days ago saying it's the right word, but it's not widely understood.

32:26.910 --> 32:28.711
That's really, that's really lame.

32:33.775 --> 32:42.101
It can't be underestimated how important it is to see this as the malevolence that it was at the time and is and remains now.

32:43.513 --> 32:48.634
He's not just being a little obtuse when he says that it's the right word, but not very many people understand it.

32:48.674 --> 32:53.655
He purposefully didn't teach it when I told him in 2021, it was the most important thing to do.

32:54.436 --> 32:58.597
When I had just gotten kicked out of drastic, because I said it was the most important thing to do.

32:59.017 --> 33:08.819
When I had just lost my job at a university of Pittsburgh school of medicine as a research assistant professor, because I insisted that transfection was the most important thing to teach.

33:13.652 --> 33:18.773
And quite frankly, quite frankly, CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:18.853 --> 33:22.274
and the whole staff of that book writing crew, they all know this too.

33:22.334 --> 33:31.376
They all know that my stance is, is that gain of function is something that the national security state wants us to teach our children so they don't have to.

33:33.116 --> 33:40.858
So that for generations, our kids will pass this mythology along about what happened in 2020 and how bad the adults screwed it up.

33:43.564 --> 33:49.067
This is the precipice that we are at where real history is being created as we speak.

33:49.468 --> 33:59.314
And that history is going to blot out the biological truth that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system has always been dumb.

34:01.795 --> 34:06.398
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and that RNA cannot pandemic.

34:06.438 --> 34:07.639
They're just not going to talk about it.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.647
because they're running out the clock on this narrative.

34:11.687 --> 34:12.428
That's what they're doing.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.528
It's running out the clock.

34:13.548 --> 34:14.709
That's how you should see this.

34:14.769 --> 34:22.593
Because they started the clock in 2019 after Kevin McKernan said that, well, it's not novel as in 2020.

34:23.013 --> 34:24.594
It was probably here before that.

34:24.734 --> 34:28.155
They weren't sequencing people in the rural parts of China.

34:28.516 --> 34:31.097
So that's why I started sequencing the weed.

34:32.810 --> 34:35.432
And of course, they told us that this was trackable.

34:35.472 --> 34:37.433
They told us it was evidence of evolution.

34:37.833 --> 34:47.959
And when they had data that showed no evolution, like Alina Chan's data, they just made her a researcher at the Broad Institute and buried the paper.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.001
Lockdowns were done correctly.

34:51.041 --> 34:56.645
They prevent spread because, of course, Australia and New Zealand are shining examples of what happens when you really lock down.

34:57.705 --> 35:01.808
And without strict regulation, gain-of-function pandemics will only be worse in the future.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.972
And they created this illusion of consensus.

35:08.032 --> 35:09.132
Bret Weinstein did it.

35:09.312 --> 35:10.792
Alexandros Marinos did it.

35:10.852 --> 35:11.953
Chris Martinson did it.

35:12.793 --> 35:14.733
I did it in 2020.

35:16.874 --> 35:17.214
You see?

35:18.274 --> 35:25.156
And until I figured out what I was doing and how dangerous it was and how much it served the needs of these people,

35:26.277 --> 35:33.759
these transhumanists, these futurists, these globalists, these servants of the weaponized piles of money that would enslave our children.

35:34.199 --> 35:45.583
Once I realized that I was participating in creating that illusion and that the people that I thought were helping me were egging me on and keeping me away from transfection, I got angry.

35:45.803 --> 35:48.964
I got mad and I still didn't figure it out.

35:50.700 --> 35:54.763
It took me almost nine months of working for Bobby before I really figured it out.

35:55.423 --> 36:02.187
And then still at that point, I couldn't consider the possibility that I had been hired to work on that book so that I wouldn't figure it out.

36:02.588 --> 36:05.129
To encourage me not to figure it out, I still didn't see it.

36:06.310 --> 36:07.871
I still thought Bobby had to be a good guy.

36:07.891 --> 36:09.032
He's just trying to do the right thing.

36:09.072 --> 36:10.693
He's just not sophisticated enough to get it.

36:10.713 --> 36:12.294
I made every excuse in the book.

36:15.290 --> 36:18.472
And the worst case scenario is still going through social media right now.

36:18.572 --> 36:19.732
Are they doing this to us?

36:20.152 --> 36:21.013
Are they killing us?

36:21.773 --> 36:22.954
Who's gonna come to our rescue?

36:22.994 --> 36:23.754
Will it be Bobby?

36:25.015 --> 36:30.237
And the way they are pulling this off is by not talking about 2020 and 2021, not talking about it at all.

36:30.658 --> 36:38.321
If you just do the research on your heroes and go to 2020 and 2021, you're gonna find people that were saying, wow, the TV's right.

36:38.762 --> 36:40.242
Wow, the New York Times is right.

36:40.602 --> 36:41.443
Wow, it's crazy.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.763
Fauci, Dasek, Fauci, Dasek, whoa!

36:46.783 --> 36:51.704
And you don't need to do that.

36:51.824 --> 36:52.844
That's all a lie.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.104
That whole faith is a lie.

36:54.144 --> 36:56.625
The only thing real is transfection and transformation.

37:01.886 --> 37:06.487
And so we're running out of mesmery there, and this will come a little hard, so hang on.

37:15.475 --> 37:17.477
So I got a couple surprises for you today.

37:17.697 --> 37:19.319
I got up early this morning.

37:19.359 --> 37:20.400
I took care of the chickens.

37:21.201 --> 37:26.386
Ruby didn't want to walk, so we're going to go for a walk after this presentation.

37:27.227 --> 37:28.128
And I did some reading.

37:28.168 --> 37:29.690
I did some reading for my friend Mark.

37:30.891 --> 37:45.322
I've been pointing out that very few people will talk about the names that I have come to understand through Mark Kulak and Housatonic Live, the presentations that he does there and the content that he makes.

37:45.743 --> 37:48.545
I've come to understand Sina Bavari is a pretty interesting dude.

37:49.065 --> 37:52.446
I've come to understand is David Hone as somebody who's a pretty interesting dude.

37:52.486 --> 37:54.427
Stanley Plotkin, exceptionally interesting.

37:54.467 --> 37:58.088
Hilary Koprowski is like somebody out of a comic book.

37:58.368 --> 38:06.890
And the Barr family has so many interesting nuggets in history, like these guys and their papas have been around for a while.

38:08.331 --> 38:14.314
It's really cool that you can trace this family all the way back to the Manhattan Project.

38:14.354 --> 38:14.914
It's really cool.

38:15.254 --> 38:21.317
And then Joshua Lederberg, of course, has an intimate role to play in these stories.

38:21.878 --> 38:32.563
And so the first thing that I want to remind you of, yesterday, of course, there is a video about the disturbing discovery of new abnormal clots that Vajon Health

38:33.223 --> 38:39.429
actually had the audacity to promote as the string theory that Jonathan Cooey or J.J.

38:39.489 --> 38:45.235
Cooey and Lasky Eye Center, that's Joe Lee, talked about on my stream.

38:45.315 --> 38:46.977
This is extraordinary.

38:46.997 --> 38:49.600
I think the string theory is silly.

38:51.196 --> 39:06.573
Even if it is a molecular component of what might happen in certain cases during vaccination gone wrong, or immune augmentation gone wrong, it is not an be-all, end-all description of what's going on.

39:06.773 --> 39:10.517
And the worst part about it is, is that it relies on the idea that

39:12.011 --> 39:21.734
that after transfection your body is making useful high affinity antibodies to the spike protein that can cause the string theory to occur.

39:22.314 --> 39:31.117
And so that's already a large assumption that makes you accept an extraordinary amount of their technologies as being sound.

39:33.578 --> 39:38.220
And so I'm pretty sure that Jolie and his string theory are a silly trap.

39:39.229 --> 39:43.250
And that's why he suddenly appeared out of nowhere when he did, when he came on my stream.

39:43.670 --> 39:46.471
And the first time that he was on my stream, he was pretty good.

39:46.511 --> 39:50.652
The second time he was on my stream, he had props ready to go.

39:51.232 --> 39:54.413
And then as soon as that stream happened, we got a clip of it.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.894
And the clip was just forced to go wild.

39:57.954 --> 40:01.895
I've never had any other clip of me ever, ever, ever.

40:02.515 --> 40:17.938
get shared as much as that clip and it is still being shared now and it's still being promoted by this guy now never there is not there's not one clip of me not one that that jeff from earth has made that has ever received the kind of attention that this clip

40:18.359 --> 40:22.841
that was made about Jolie and myself and the string theory.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.883
It has been shared over and over and repeatedly and repeatedly.

40:27.244 --> 40:32.126
And somehow people can't forget about it and new anonymous accounts find it and new anonymous accounts.

40:32.486 --> 40:39.410
And now four and a half years into the pandemic, Vae John Philip McMillan actually finds it and promotes it.

40:41.191 --> 40:42.992
It is spectacular.

40:44.022 --> 40:49.946
how hard they are fighting at this point to try and get me somehow to play along.

40:52.847 --> 41:02.213
And so one of the things that I mentioned the other day was Whitney Webb had mentioned William Barr or whether he mentioned, she mentioned William Barr in her book.

41:03.134 --> 41:04.715
And I think it's really interesting.

41:04.775 --> 41:05.535
I have her books.

41:05.675 --> 41:07.756
I actually have her books and they're signed by her.

41:08.857 --> 41:12.980
And so this morning I decided to skim the book and

41:14.696 --> 41:20.698
The... But I would say that that clip is random.

41:20.778 --> 41:21.458
Just chance?

41:21.758 --> 41:22.279
I don't know.

41:22.899 --> 41:29.661
Because there's been lots of clips from this community, from Jeff from Earth, that have never gone anywhere after his tweet or her tweet.

41:30.521 --> 41:31.462
It doesn't go anywhere.

41:32.062 --> 41:37.344
But this single video keeps coming back so often, it's very extraordinary.

41:37.744 --> 41:40.645
And it's not really a video about me, it's a video about Joe Lee.

41:41.545 --> 41:43.327
So that's the other thing you need to see here.

41:43.367 --> 41:50.173
That video is pushed as watch Jonathan Cui suddenly be taught the truth by by Jolie.

41:50.274 --> 41:51.975
It's it's a deceptively

41:54.970 --> 42:01.437
I feel like it was made specifically maybe to bait me into sharing it but then promoting Joe Lee by sharing it.

42:01.497 --> 42:02.278
So I never shared it.

42:02.898 --> 42:13.068
And watching it go and go and go and people try to force it to go and nobody ever makes that effort with any of the other videos that Jeff ever cuts.

42:14.129 --> 42:16.990
was pretty extraordinary to me, and it's still going on right now.

42:17.390 --> 42:20.551
So anyway, here we are, Whitney Webb on William Barr.

42:20.631 --> 42:23.672
I've got her two books right here, and so I thought I'd go through them.

42:23.832 --> 42:36.676
Interestingly, in looking for a picture of these books, Mark, you'll be interested to note this if Mark's listening, lo and behold, the audio books of Whitney Webb's books right now are free!

42:38.069 --> 42:41.671
Like you can just get them on Amazon.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.252
It's a free trial with Audible.

42:44.633 --> 42:45.893
You get her books for free.

42:47.294 --> 42:48.675
That's pretty awesome, isn't it?

42:48.715 --> 42:59.161
I mean, there must be a lot of really scary, inconvenient truths for the state in these books if they're giving them away for free on Amazon, right?

42:59.221 --> 43:02.803
Must be very, very salacious.

43:04.744 --> 43:06.825
So let me see what happens if I do that.

43:08.868 --> 43:12.471
Hey, to Jonathan, it was great to meet you at the CHD conference.

43:12.511 --> 43:13.512
Thanks for your support.

43:13.592 --> 43:14.813
Best, Whitney Webb.

43:16.154 --> 43:17.455
Not bullshitting around here, man.

43:17.916 --> 43:29.265
I met this girl at the CHD conference, and after her talk, the first person that came out of the conference room was none other than Robert Malone, and he said, wow, what a firecracker.

43:29.325 --> 43:30.306
I didn't expect that.

43:30.706 --> 43:31.447
That was great.

43:38.632 --> 43:57.112
Remember, this is the same CHD conference that Matt Crawford wasn't registered for, but once he found out I was going, he decided to go from Texas to Knoxville and count on the fact that Merrill Nass would get him a registration, even though the registration was all closed.

43:58.769 --> 44:06.271
Just a little tidbit of information, Matt Crawford also had lunch with Robert Malone and his wife while he was at the CHD conference in Knoxville.

44:06.671 --> 44:10.032
And this was also the first time actually where, is it?

44:10.952 --> 44:11.872
Or was it the second time?

44:12.252 --> 44:17.513
I think it was the second time that, oh gosh, now I'm really lost.

44:20.574 --> 44:27.836
I think it was the second time that I met Mark Kulak in person, but it might've been the first time and then the second time was at my house, I can't remember.

44:28.941 --> 44:29.742
And so let's go.

44:30.222 --> 44:43.893
What we're going to do here is we're going to go to what I've done already, previous to getting on air of course, is I've taken a look at the index here and I've looked for bar.

44:45.137 --> 44:47.637
And you can see that I'm not very good with alphabetizing things.

44:47.677 --> 44:48.978
So I turned to the wrong page already.

44:49.038 --> 44:51.378
Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar.

44:51.958 --> 44:53.019
William Barr's right there.

44:53.139 --> 44:57.879
And you see there's lots of, in volume one, there's lots of citations.

44:57.899 --> 45:00.760
So we're just going to go read these citations out loud and see what we get.

45:04.321 --> 45:04.921
Let's see.

45:09.322 --> 45:10.242
So the first one is on 207.

45:13.148 --> 45:16.130
Let's look and see if I can find the Barr name before you find it.

45:16.430 --> 45:17.531
Ah, here we go, here's Barr.

45:18.231 --> 45:29.978
Barr, one former CIA officer on Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trobert's pre-roll at this time was William Barr, the future Attorney General for Presidents George Bush and years later, Donald Trump.

45:30.518 --> 45:32.399
Barr worked for the CIA from 73 to 77.

45:32.779 --> 45:40.284
He joined that law firm in 78, but it is unknown if he worked for any of the accounts linked to this private CIA

45:41.755 --> 45:43.115
during his time there.

45:43.816 --> 45:45.496
One lawyer who confirmed, and then it goes on.

45:45.636 --> 45:54.978
So, Bill Barr is a CIA agent, has worked for Attorney General for a couple presidents, and he worked for Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge.

45:55.178 --> 45:56.419
Okay, cool.

45:57.239 --> 46:01.680
Let's see, next reference is on page...

46:07.378 --> 46:10.459
Rick's reference is on page 349, and it goes over to 350.

46:12.379 --> 46:15.080
So it's actually two references, but it's not really two references.

46:15.100 --> 46:15.720
It's just one.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.660
It's here at the bottom of the page.

46:18.840 --> 46:23.801
Um, the attorney general serving under George W. Bush at that time was William Barr.

46:24.281 --> 46:35.164
As mentioned before, Barr had been a CIA officer before joining the agency-linked law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge.

46:36.404 --> 46:36.604
Huh.

46:38.564 --> 46:39.064
And then what?

46:40.205 --> 46:40.586
That's it?

46:41.246 --> 46:45.550
You just said that like 200 pages earlier and nothing more.

46:46.190 --> 46:48.892
So this mention here is not attributed.

46:50.533 --> 46:50.814
Okay.

46:51.514 --> 46:54.377
So, um, and that's two more mentions.

46:54.397 --> 46:55.077
So that's three.

46:55.898 --> 46:57.459
Then here we go to page 406.

47:00.847 --> 47:06.810
And that appointment was made by none other than Attorney General under George Bush William Barr.

47:06.870 --> 47:15.556
As previously mentioned in Chapter 8, Barr had not only alleged role in major aspects of Iran-Contra under Robert Johnson, but had begun his career at the CIA.

47:15.636 --> 47:22.220
As will be discussed in Chapter 11, Barr's employment with the CIA overlapped with his father's decision to hire Jeffrey Epstein at the Dalton School

47:22.740 --> 47:26.182
which would prove essential in Epstein's rise to prominence in these networks.

47:26.282 --> 47:38.349
Early on, Barr essentially stonewalled Congress by denying congressmen access to privileged documents related to Promise and Inslaw Incorporated, much like he had done years earlier when he stonewalled the Church Committee on behalf of the CIA.

47:39.289 --> 47:46.715
As a result, a congressional hearing was held in December 1990 on Barr's continued refusal to make the documents available.

47:47.175 --> 48:00.126
After considerable political pressure, Barr moved to appoint the special counsel to investigate the Inslaw Affair, appointed retired judge from Chicago, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

48:00.146 --> 48:02.507
Yes and yes and yes, and that's it.

48:03.568 --> 48:04.229
No more Barr.

48:06.771 --> 48:06.911
Hmm.

48:08.066 --> 48:14.730
Okay, I'm still not really paying much attention to Barr, apparently, even though he's been Attorney General for two Presidents.

48:14.770 --> 48:16.091
He's not really that important.

48:16.111 --> 48:18.412
He worked for the CIA, but that, you know, that's it.

48:18.713 --> 48:19.033
Okay.

48:20.094 --> 48:22.055
Here we go, we're going to page 433, same book.

48:25.766 --> 48:34.491
Much of the dirty laundry of these different criminal enterprises would be mopped up in the early 90s by none other than William Barr, who started his career at the CIA and served as George W. Bush's Attorney General.

48:34.991 --> 48:47.358
Barr would play a major role in covering up Iran-Contra promise in BCCI and is seen in his pardoning of the Iran-Contra criminals and his patronage of the Bua report and his thwarting of indictments related to BCCI's 91 collapse.

48:47.818 --> 48:53.461
Some have explained specific scandals away, painting them as blights of the Reagan-Bush administrations and treating them with

48:54.898 --> 48:58.501
treating these intelligence organized criminal rackets as isolated instances.

48:58.561 --> 49:03.005
However, that's it.

49:03.325 --> 49:04.906
There's no more Bill Barr.

49:06.608 --> 49:06.988
Okay.

49:07.008 --> 49:09.750
So CIA again and attorney general again.

49:09.770 --> 49:11.091
Okay.

49:11.131 --> 49:12.392
I'm going to the next one for 51.

49:12.432 --> 49:12.472
Um,

49:18.476 --> 49:27.540
Here it is again, William Casey and in the late seventies had worked alongside young William Barr in stonewalling the Pike Committee and the Church Committee and investigated the CIA beginning in 1975.

49:29.081 --> 49:30.702
And that's it for Bill Barr again.

49:30.722 --> 49:33.303
Hmm.

49:34.884 --> 49:37.525
Not a whole lot on Bill Barr.

49:37.585 --> 49:42.068
It's like, okay, then I go all the way to the back and that's the end.

49:42.188 --> 49:44.129
So, um, that's the first book.

49:45.569 --> 49:46.910
Um, let's go to the second book.

49:48.510 --> 49:50.171
Maybe she has more on the second book.

49:52.652 --> 49:55.513
I'll go to the index here and we got Barr.

49:55.573 --> 49:57.993
Donald Barr's got page 2 and 3.

50:00.034 --> 50:01.815
And William Barr has 2, 3, and 31.

50:02.275 --> 50:02.915
Okay, good.

50:02.955 --> 50:04.716
Let's go right to the beginning of the book.

50:04.776 --> 50:06.116
Man, that's promising.

50:06.136 --> 50:10.218
Okay, so 2 and 3.

50:10.918 --> 50:13.199
Donald Barr was the son of a communist and

50:14.898 --> 50:19.843
son of an economist and psychologist who had joined the OSS during World War II.

50:21.004 --> 50:26.910
He is alleged to have been a member of an OSS target team in Germany and have worked for a prisoner of war camp.

50:27.785 --> 50:45.180
His son, William Barr, would subsequently follow his father into the world of intelligence services and served from the CIA from 1971 to 77, which overlaps with the last few years his father was headmaster at the Dalton School, including the year Donald Barr is alleged to have hired Jeffrey Epstein.

50:45.601 --> 50:53.247
William Barr, who allegedly had a role in the Iran Contra mentioned in chapter eight, would go on to serve as attorney general for George,

50:54.198 --> 50:57.740
in a capacity, was arrested and found dead in New York prison.

50:59.401 --> 51:03.784
After exiting intelligence, he briefly worked as a literary editor and then went into academia.

51:03.824 --> 51:05.165
He taught English at Columbia.

51:05.185 --> 51:05.965
Oh boy.

51:06.525 --> 51:14.690
And for 10 years while pursuing graduate studies, he started a series of conferences in 1955 focused on identification guidance and instructed of the gifted.

51:15.911 --> 51:22.934
and joined the School of Engineering following year, and these conferences then grew into Science Honors Program, which offered Saturday classes to gifted high schoolers.

51:22.954 --> 51:23.594
Nice idea.

51:24.175 --> 51:33.499
At the same time he was running his high school-focused program, Barr was also directing the Talent Preservation Project, a massive research therapy program for high school underachievers.

51:33.979 --> 51:43.323
It is possible that there may have been an early Epstein-Barr connection if Epstein had attended one of these programs for gifted high school students.

51:45.233 --> 51:46.534
Donald Barr would become the head.

51:46.574 --> 51:56.297
So it's all about tying them to promoting him as the school headmaster, and the headmaster, and the headmaster, and the headmaster Dalton, and the headmaster.

51:56.357 --> 52:08.882
So despite the fact that he was somebody in World War II, an OSS target team, that's all she's got to say.

52:08.942 --> 52:12.804
And then she repeats the stuff that she said 13 other times in the first book.

52:14.269 --> 52:16.032
And then adds a little bit about the dad again.

52:16.172 --> 52:16.593
I don't know.

52:16.973 --> 52:17.374
I'm not.

52:19.554 --> 52:20.834
I'm not terribly impressed.

52:20.894 --> 52:30.698
If you look at Mark's catalog of research into the Barr family, every time he opens the book on them, something interesting falls out.

52:30.878 --> 52:38.360
And I find it incredible, absolutely incredible to see that this book is free, has an audio book on Amazon.

52:38.401 --> 52:39.861
That cannot be good.

52:40.261 --> 52:47.284
That cannot mean that this is the most controversial, most dangerous books for the state that have ever been produced.

52:47.324 --> 52:48.344
It's just not possible.

52:50.703 --> 52:53.444
This is the opposite of that label.

52:54.144 --> 52:56.405
They are encouraging people to read this.

52:57.786 --> 53:07.750
As many people as will download a three-month trial of Audible and will willingly put themselves on the list.

53:09.790 --> 53:10.631
Amazeballs.

53:11.508 --> 53:12.389
amazeballs.

53:13.069 --> 53:17.892
So he worked for the CIA and he was a district attorney was a attorney general twice.

53:18.012 --> 53:20.353
That's about what she knows about William Barr.

53:21.194 --> 53:26.597
And her dad, his dad was the headmaster at at the Dalton school.

53:26.617 --> 53:31.660
And that's all you really need to know from Whitney Webb as far as William Barr and his dad are concerned.

53:32.281 --> 53:33.942
And unfortunately, because of

53:34.602 --> 53:41.269
Robert Malone's incredibly ridiculous endorsement in Knoxville at the CHD inaugural conference.

53:41.990 --> 53:46.715
I can't help but think that Whitney Webb is probably part of this ridiculous little thing.

53:48.632 --> 53:58.280
Curious note, Whitney Webb actually mentions Joshua Lederberg in an article that she published in 2020 about Michael Callahan.

54:00.842 --> 54:11.070
It's a really interesting hat tip to Joshua Lederberg and is actually what has led me to think that we should be looking into Lederberg like Mark Kulak is as well.

54:11.890 --> 54:13.791
Remember, I think these people have misled us.

54:14.192 --> 54:21.436
I think in particular, Robert Malone is intimate in terms of, really important in terms of understanding what's going on here.

54:21.916 --> 54:23.577
I want to just cover these points really quick.

54:24.718 --> 54:32.783
In the Vajon Health video that I covered in two videos in the previous shows, it became clear that Robert Malone has worked particularly on retroviruses.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.664
This will become important in the Journal Club today.

54:35.624 --> 54:39.507
Investigated packaging sequences will also become important in the Journal Club today.

54:40.387 --> 54:45.950
suffered PTSD because those labs were so cutthroat, and he actually got a diagnosis of that.

54:46.370 --> 54:59.237
But since then, he's able to work for DITRA, DOD, speak at the WHO, and sit on multiple NIH study sections where he's overseen and helped people award more than $50 billion worth of American funds.

54:59.637 --> 55:04.679
He won't touch Mickiewicz because she comes from the same retro viral mentor chain that he does.

55:05.680 --> 55:15.384
And he has actually done a movie with Gerrit van den Bosch where he has a little black taxi cab driver hat on and there's drone footage from him in the mountains of Spain in 2021.

55:15.884 --> 55:19.646
And so I assure you that Gerrit is also intimately involved in this theater.

55:20.426 --> 55:35.757
Finally, I can't encourage you enough, please use the website housatonicits.com and peruse the news articles and things that have been so generously correlated together, collated together, archived together for our use.

55:36.298 --> 55:38.840
Please go there and find things that I haven't found yet.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.423
So we did this already.

55:41.463 --> 55:55.043
Vajon Health is a really interesting window into this that spans from Geert van den Bosch all the way through Christine Grace and Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn all the way through to Robert Malone and

55:56.304 --> 56:02.446
and right now up to citing Joe Lee and his string theory in a video.

56:02.546 --> 56:23.212
It's absolutely shocking how much can be learned if you just look at that guy's catalog and see how he was set up to be present for the spike, be present for autoimmunity, and try to misconstrue it as both the spike protein in transfection and the spike protein from the gain-of-function virus are causing the same calamity in

56:23.792 --> 56:24.213
humans.

56:24.554 --> 56:28.947
And that is a disturbingly malevolent mythology.

56:31.317 --> 56:34.439
And I think it's really available right now to see what's happening.

56:34.499 --> 56:49.710
The limited spectrum of debate is currently being buttressed on one side by CHD and Brownstone, and on the other side by a much more reasonable and nuanced take by Robert Malone's Substack.

56:49.831 --> 56:58.357
And so here we are in avian flu, and the mythology is being actively curated by the exact people that won't talk about me, and actually some of them even let me go.

56:58.957 --> 57:24.143
After hiring me as a hero The way that they do it is they don't talk about 2020 and what they were doing then and what what they were talking about The first interview with Jolie is a pretty good interview the second one with Jolie is a

57:25.188 --> 57:26.369
is less entertaining.

57:26.409 --> 57:26.949
It's okay.

57:27.629 --> 57:30.030
Um, there's no question that Jolie is not on our team.

57:30.130 --> 57:32.291
I don't know whose team he's on, but he ain't on my team.

57:32.371 --> 57:37.994
Otherwise he wouldn't be, um, taking the stance that he does and pretending that I'm ignoring him or something like that.

57:38.034 --> 57:41.155
He knows exactly the truth of the matter.

57:41.615 --> 57:42.456
Uh, and that's fine.

57:42.856 --> 57:49.359
That's why I have him prominently featured on my meddlers, uh, diagram because that's for sure where he belongs.

57:49.779 --> 57:52.940
Um, let's take a look at this and work together on it.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.601
Let's just, um,

57:56.018 --> 58:00.561
Let's just turn the highlighter on and see where this gets us.

58:00.661 --> 58:02.662
So, let me see if I can see the highlighter here.

58:02.702 --> 58:03.662
Which one is the highlighter?

58:04.403 --> 58:04.983
That one, I think.

58:05.584 --> 58:05.784
Yes.

58:06.684 --> 58:13.068
So, this is a paper from 1994.

58:13.108 --> 58:14.149
Excuse me, I was going to say 2094.

58:18.328 --> 58:31.720
1994, that was the year that I graduated from university in Chicago and started my rude awakening into adult life and how it wasn't going to go as planned.

58:33.442 --> 58:35.984
And at that time, a guy by the name of John A. Wolfe

58:37.155 --> 58:46.924
wrote a review, a kind of special feature review with Joshua Lederberg about the early history of gene transfer and therapy.

58:48.205 --> 58:57.934
Now, the reason why this is so interesting is because this John A. Wolfe is someone on a paper called Direct Gene Transfer into Mouse

58:59.187 --> 59:00.428
muscle in vivo.

59:00.808 --> 59:06.611
And this is, of course, the paper that also has Robert Malone as an author.

59:06.691 --> 59:23.840
Now, interestingly enough, while Robert Malone is claiming to be the kind of intellectual dude that's behind direct gene transfer in muscle, you know, to do that kind of thing, transfection transformation, he doesn't really mention this guy very much.

59:24.775 --> 59:30.997
I've heard him mention this dude, I think I mentioned, it's weird because this guy died in April of 2020.

59:34.259 --> 59:46.063
At some point you think there would be a, yeah, you know, one of the guys that unfortunately isn't here that could probably give us a lot of insight into what's going on and would back up everything I'm saying is a guy by the name of John Wolf, God rest his soul.

59:47.624 --> 59:47.784
Nah.

59:48.595 --> 59:49.735
We're not gonna mention him at all.

59:49.795 --> 59:54.977
So keeping in mind who is John A. Wolfe is the question that I'm trying to ask with this stream.

59:55.377 --> 01:00:03.378
And so I thought it's actually very appropriate to go back and read a paper that he wrote in 1994 with none other than Joshua Lederberg.

01:00:03.418 --> 01:00:04.399
Like he is the man.

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:10.620
Joshua Lederberg is the guy that brought us Carey Mullis and the PCR.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:18.202
And you're gonna find out in this article and other ways that Joshua Lederberg is the guy that brought us, found us bacteriophages.

01:00:19.724 --> 01:00:21.705
And so I don't know if we can read this whole article.

01:00:21.745 --> 01:00:22.886
I think we probably can.

01:00:23.627 --> 01:00:42.279
And as we read it, I want you to understand that this is a snapshot in the history of how these ideas have evolved and how the expression of these ideas has evolved to either avoid or minimize the ethical questions that are involved in these issues.

01:00:43.413 --> 01:00:48.995
And Joshua Lederberg seems to almost be handing off the torch to John A. Wolfe here.

01:00:49.015 --> 01:00:53.877
If you go on PubMed and look for this article, it's not gonna be that easy to find.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:01:00.239
You might actually be very surprised if you search for John A. Wolfe and just get the articles that pull up.

01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:05.761
There are a lot of interesting articles that will show up, but none of them are this one.

01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:08.161
Let's see if I can, do I have that up here?

01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:09.602
Yes, I do.

01:01:10.302 --> 01:01:13.423
So let me just take this over here quick and show you this.

01:01:14.143 --> 01:01:34.588
So here is the PubMed search that I did and you see direct gene transfer here, direct gene transfer into muscles, another paper in 94, gene therapy of primer in 1993, small interfering RNA delivery vehicles, naked DNA transport and expression in Memento 97,

01:01:36.768 --> 01:01:45.914
So if you think then that that this guy's got a lot of stuff under his belt And that he has one paper with Robert Malone from when?

01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:57.562
1990 It's curious that Robert Malone in that stream We watched with with vage on health over the last two days in the beginning So you have to go to the first program we did on it in the beginning of that podcast.

01:01:57.602 --> 01:02:00.844
He's very insistent I don't know if anybody else came up with these ideas.

01:02:01.304 --> 01:02:01.965
I'm just one

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:11.712
you know, we stand on the shoulders of giants, was kind of a very faux humble way of saying that there's lots of people that this idea is from and I wasn't even the first author on the paper.

01:02:16.855 --> 01:02:20.438
And so let's read this paper to find out who the hell John Wolf is.

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:31.846
The term gene therapy was coined to distinguish it from Orwellian connotations of human genetic engineering, which in turn was derived from the term genetic engineering.

01:02:34.841 --> 01:02:42.227
Human genetic engineering is derived from the term genetic engineering, and we don't want it to be Orwellian, so they called it gene therapy.

01:02:42.688 --> 01:02:46.051
Well, that's already a creepy admission, isn't it?

01:02:47.772 --> 01:02:50.314
That's already an incredibly creepy admission.

01:02:50.474 --> 01:03:01.544
Genetic engineering was first used at the 6th International Congress of Genetics, held in 1931, and was taken to mean the amplification of genetic principles to animal and plant breeding.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:22.148
Once the basics of molecular genetics and gene transfer in bacteria were established in the 1960s by Joshua Lederberg, gene transfer into animals and humans using either viral vectors and or genetically modified cultured cells, which became inevitable.

01:03:22.408 --> 01:03:25.389
Using cultured cells is a lot of what they do now.

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:35.081
in order to fix the immune system, they'll ablate the immune system, get rid of all the cells in your bone marrow, and then put some genetically engineered bone marrow stem cells back in.

01:03:37.303 --> 01:03:47.612
And when he described the application or when Robert Malone described the experiment that inspired him,

01:03:52.443 --> 01:03:53.709
I can switch over to this.

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:57.404
He described transformation of cells.

01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:06.046
they used retroviruses to transform the cells and then they put those cells back into the mouse and those cells express the protein.

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:26.541
And so what we're talking about here in this paper, and what he's saying here with the idea that either using human viral vectors or genetically modified cultured cells became inevitable, he's speaking exactly of the kind of experiment that Robert Malone described to us in that early Vajon Health June 2021 video.

01:04:29.721 --> 01:04:37.693
Despite the early exposition of the concept of gene therapy, progress awaited the advent of recombinant DNA technology.

01:04:37.733 --> 01:04:39.576
What is recombinant DNA technology?

01:04:40.036 --> 01:04:43.822
Well, that's synthetic RNA and DNA made by bacterial cloning.

01:04:46.525 --> 01:04:57.190
what virology will often refer to as infectious clones, but what pharmaceutical companies will refer to as basic molecular biology.

01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:02.113
It is recombinant DNA technology where they grow it up in bacterial culture.

01:05:02.533 --> 01:05:04.714
That's what that phrase means.

01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:14.640
The lack of trustworthy techniques did not stop many researchers from attempting to transfer genes into cells in culture animals and humans.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:22.725
Viral genomes were used for the development of the first relatively efficient methods for gene transfer into mammalian cells and culture.

01:05:23.305 --> 01:05:31.851
In the late 1970s, early transfection techniques were combined with the selection systems for cultured cells and recombinant DNA technology.

01:05:33.365 --> 01:05:41.988
Early transfection techniques were combined with selection systems for cultured cells and recombinant DNA technology.

01:05:43.868 --> 01:05:46.409
Do you see why virology is a lie?

01:05:46.749 --> 01:05:47.430
It's an illusion.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:55.132
They're lying to you about the biological correlate of bacteriophages.

01:05:56.012 --> 01:06:01.214
They're lying to you about what bacteriophages are and what their correlate would be in our own biology.

01:06:03.868 --> 01:06:20.237
With the development of retroviral vectors in the early 1980s by people like Robert Malone and Robert Gallo and David Baltimore and their students, the possibility of efficient gene transfer into mammalian cells for purpose of gene therapy became widely accepted.

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:30.182
Gene therapy, of course, being a term that was coined to distinguish it, the idea, from the Orwellian connotations of genetic engineering.

01:06:34.912 --> 01:06:39.960
This article outlines the conceptual and experimental beginnings of gene therapy.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.446
The idea, how do we understand, how do we know something?

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.741
That's what Alex Karp would ask.

01:06:45.781 --> 01:06:46.802
How do we know something?

01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:48.104
How do we understand something?

01:06:48.144 --> 01:06:54.971
Well, the concept can be consciously and intelligently manipulated so that it means what they want it to mean.

01:06:55.711 --> 01:07:07.243
And he just introduced it in the abstract that to try to divorce the Orwellian connotations of human genetic engineering from that term, they started calling it gene therapy.

01:07:10.663 --> 01:07:12.664
Not getting very far in this article very quickly.

01:07:12.744 --> 01:07:21.508
Concurrently, experimentalists attempted gene transfer into mammalian cells, culture, and animals in anticipation of recombinant DNA technology.

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:28.651
So they attempted gene transfer, knowing eventually they would be able to make nucleic acids very cheaply.

01:07:29.994 --> 01:07:30.955
What a weird statement.

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:41.641
Unreliable practices in early studies open the experimental results in the entire approach of gene therapy to question, even though many basic methods and theories would eventually be proven correct.

01:07:45.184 --> 01:07:50.647
I'm sorry, but this right here sounds exactly like what I have been saying they want to do with transfection.

01:07:51.608 --> 01:07:57.812
They want the unreliable practices of the pandemic emergency

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:16.669
to be discredited, be discarded because they're just, you can't put the entire methodology of transfection into question because we rushed it, because we cut corners, because Donald Trump made us cut corners.

01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:29.220
And so just like Joshua Lederberg and John Wolf are making the argument that unreliable application of gene therapy

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:41.491
is making it dangerous that people might throw the whole idea out even though the basic methods and theories would be proven correct.

01:08:43.012 --> 01:08:44.314
It's the same grift.

01:08:45.335 --> 01:08:49.018
It's exactly the same grift and it's still ongoing.

01:08:49.078 --> 01:08:50.820
It's taking them years to do it.

01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:52.562
Almost 30 years to do it.

01:08:54.622 --> 01:09:02.229
to invert our understanding of ourselves so that something like this could be read and not make any sense to us other than, okay.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:15.222
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and they want you to believe that the unreliable practices of early application during a pandemic crisis

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:28.417
should not be reason to throw the whole methodology out when the whole methodology will be proven to be correct in the end in the next generation of vaccines that we give to our old people and young alike.

01:09:33.722 --> 01:09:47.670
It was not until transfection techniques and selection systems for cultured cells were coupled with the ability to manipulate recombinant DNA that substantive progress was made in gene transfer.

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:49.251
Holy shit.

01:09:50.351 --> 01:09:51.552
They say it all out loud.

01:10:02.099 --> 01:10:04.801
Transfection is gene transfer technology, you see.

01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:24.976
As the enterprise of gene therapy enters an accelerating period of growth, it is timely to examine and it's, it's, it is timely to, sorry, I was trying to find out how many people are watching, but I can't see it.

01:10:25.016 --> 01:10:26.697
I guess I don't have that window open anymore.

01:10:27.217 --> 01:10:30.360
I had to redo my OBS and so everything's fresh.

01:10:30.997 --> 01:10:36.857
As the enterprise of gene therapy enters an accelerating period of growth, it is timely to examine its earlier, more tentative phase of development.

01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:41.642
The rise of gene therapy has been compared to the growth of aeronautics.

01:10:42.262 --> 01:11:02.168
Just as the ancient Greeks fantasized about Acheros' disastrous flight, gave away to da Vinci's fanciful, if unflightworthy, drawings of flying machines, and later to the design of many strange and awkward contraptions, so too has the early history of gene therapy been marked by numerous dreamers, prophets of doom, naysayers, missteps, and fiascos.

01:11:03.004 --> 01:11:07.986
In both cases, many experiments were attempted too early before the necessary tools were available.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:19.231
The John Wolf guy works at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and of course, Lederberg is at Rockefeller University in New York.

01:11:21.252 --> 01:11:29.336
But just as the invention of the Wright brothers' crude but successful early flying machines rapidly led to the development of supersonic jets and space travel,

01:11:30.757 --> 01:11:37.962
So too has the development of recombinant DNA technology brought us, in an astonishingly brief span of time, to the brink of curing.

01:11:38.463 --> 01:11:42.366
Hereto though, here the two, here there too?

01:11:43.964 --> 01:11:45.004
Sorry, I said that wrong.

01:11:45.024 --> 01:11:45.445
That's funny.

01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:46.025
It's a funny word.

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:47.925
Untreatable diseases.

01:11:48.506 --> 01:11:51.366
Gene therapy is not as generally thought a new concept.

01:11:51.827 --> 01:11:55.948
The notion that genes can be used to treat human disease actually goes back several decades.

01:11:56.568 --> 01:12:03.370
Many of the pioneers of modern genetics were aware that their discoveries eventually would lead to medical applications.

01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:08.212
Perhaps this history is obscure because halting process

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:17.714
Perhaps this history is obscure because halting progress in the science of gene therapy and transfer was slow in coming.

01:12:18.394 --> 01:12:33.020
Now that researchers and their patients have embarked on promising gene therapy trials, it may be useful to review the evolution of gene therapy's theoretical foundations and thereby gain insights into its medical, scientific, social, ethical, and economic milieus.

01:12:35.662 --> 01:12:48.012
Reviews covering later advances in gene therapy and in non-viral gene transfer methods have appeared, and one of the more prominent early proponents for gene therapy has recently explored its history.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:56.179
This contribution, while stressing early attempts at gene transfer in cell cultures in animals, seeks to place these studies in a wider historical context.

01:12:56.759 --> 01:13:01.082
Moreover, a historical perspective may be useful for evaluating the prior art.

01:13:02.263 --> 01:13:03.624
in patent applications.

01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:06.244
What an interesting thing to say.

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:08.325
They mention IP.

01:13:11.266 --> 01:13:22.689
Of course, there's this little anecdotal story about Brett and Eric Weinstein's dad, who happens to be an IP, intellectual property lawyer, who was appointed to the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:22.869 --> 01:13:24.590
and John F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:26.019 --> 01:13:28.362
And so worked with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:30.345
's dad.

01:13:31.647 --> 01:13:32.628
Their dads worked together.

01:13:32.988 --> 01:13:33.409
Interesting.

01:13:33.489 --> 01:13:35.292
And they mentioned patent applications in this.

01:13:36.434 --> 01:13:44.603
So the beginning of genetics, long before the discovery of the gene, our species participated in genetic manipulation.

01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:52.511
The first Council of International Genetics was held in 1899 in London.

01:13:53.112 --> 01:13:57.536
It was actually called the International Congress of Hybridization on the Crossbreeding of Varieties.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:04.695
William Bateson used the use of the term genetics at the Third Congress of Genetics in 1906.

01:14:05.056 --> 01:14:13.102
In the interim, Hugo de Vries and others had rediscovered Mendel's work, which originated the concept of the gene as a unit of heredity.

01:14:15.224 --> 01:14:25.673
One of the first uses of the term genetic engineering was in a paper of the title presented at the Sixth International Congress of Genetics held in 1932 in Ithaca, New York.

01:14:25.733 --> 01:14:26.614
So again,

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:39.527
The term pandemic potential probably made its debut in a publication and used it in the title or in the abstract and has nothing to do with the results of the paper or any of the papers that followed it.

01:14:40.908 --> 01:14:49.116
To Marxist commentators, the term genetic engineering was synonymous with eugenics in contrast to social engineering of the USSR public policy.

01:14:49.456 --> 01:14:53.060
This is also something that Lederberg talked about, wrote a paper about, which is interesting.

01:14:53.888 --> 01:15:00.873
The term gene therapy was adopted to distinguish itself from ominous gene line perceptions of the term human genetic engineering.

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:09.978
While the human genome has previously been modified indirectly by human activity, more direct manipulations could usher in a new epoch.

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:14.081
So here we are again talking about the future of genetics.

01:15:14.781 --> 01:15:20.005
The concept of gene therapy is set in the context of pharmacological and surgical traditions.

01:15:20.065 --> 01:15:21.626
Gene therapy can be defined

01:15:23.877 --> 01:15:27.159
as the application of genetic principles to the treatment of human disease.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:47.891
Screening programs for phytoketoneuria and Tay-Sachs disease and many conventional medical and surgical therapeutic approaches such as liver transplantation could fall under this definition because they were founded under the understanding of their genetics and biochemistry.

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:48.692
That's a little weak.

01:15:49.732 --> 01:16:01.022
More specifically, the term gene therapy unites pharmacotherapeutic with genetic principles, implicating the use of a polyonucleotide to treat the disease state.

01:16:01.463 --> 01:16:03.465
And so this is very good.

01:16:04.346 --> 01:16:15.073
This is very good because what this is, it's telling you how these ideas have been contorted from the irreducible complexity idea, from the sacred biology idea.

01:16:15.493 --> 01:16:33.745
Because rather than saying that our understanding of genetics is immorally impotent, in the sense of it would be immoral to go forward with so little understanding, as actually Craig Venter said on video.

01:16:35.609 --> 01:16:42.595
but instead trying to talk about genetic therapy as equivalent to pharmacokinetics.

01:16:43.596 --> 01:16:57.849
When we understand that chemicals and the way that they augment our homeostasis and our physiology, chemicals are very different than genetic signals.

01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.631
And

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:09.247
the potential downsides of administering genetic signals and treating them as just pharmacotherapeutics, you know, like an opioid.

01:17:11.369 --> 01:17:26.321
You are actually hearing and listening to the semantic warfare that is being here misconstrued as some scientific discussion that will add nuance and understanding to our list of terms in the toolbox.

01:17:27.293 --> 01:17:27.993
Stop lying.

01:17:28.533 --> 01:17:29.894
And that's not what's happening here.

01:17:29.914 --> 01:17:32.594
What you're hearing is exactly what they said at the top.

01:17:33.155 --> 01:17:50.719
It is a, they are, they are trying to describe the term gene therapy accurately enough in their own language to distinguish it from the Orwellian connotations that are almost impossible to divorce from the phrase human genetic engineering.

01:17:52.728 --> 01:18:01.957
This whole article is about trying to convince you that if you think about genetic engineering in the right way, it's actually not as morally confounding as you think.

01:18:02.417 --> 01:18:08.563
It's not as actually insulting to the irreducible complexity of God's creation than you think.

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:12.547
If you call it gene therapy, it's not nearly as problematic.

01:18:13.609 --> 01:18:20.832
this whole damn article's about, and trying to put this argument into a historical context so it feels more like, well, it's an illusion.

01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:24.093
It's a consensus that all these old smart people came up with.

01:18:27.254 --> 01:18:38.799
More specifically, the term gene therapy unites pharmacotherapeutic with genetic principles implicating the use of a polynucleotide to treat a disease state.

01:18:39.419 --> 01:18:39.559
Ugh.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.180
Stop lying!

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.215
It's so gross.

01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:52.556
And so in 1878, Langley proposed the concept of the receptor substance known simply as the receptor.

01:18:52.596 --> 01:18:58.500
The hypothesis that interactions between a drug and the receptor are governed by the law of mass action was first developed.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.843
And so here he goes on again, talking about what should be termed biophysics.

01:19:02.903 --> 01:19:08.587
And he should be talking about ion channels and receptors and G-protein coupled receptors and all this stuff.

01:19:09.047 --> 01:19:15.072
But instead, he's going to try and twist it around very, very succinctly so that he can only use this stuff

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:17.673
for the expression of genes.

01:19:17.793 --> 01:19:22.374
And that's the only thing that really matters is that we we can express these things in different places.

01:19:22.434 --> 01:19:32.778
The molecular understanding of protein function and enzyme action led to the development or rational drug design based on targeting the receptor or active site you see.

01:19:33.238 --> 01:19:35.399
So he's just trying to take

01:19:35.919 --> 01:19:45.332
our limited understanding of this irreducible complexity and pinch it all the time off and put it on the shelf of, see, but this is another argument for genetic therapy.

01:19:45.352 --> 01:19:47.094
It's another argument for genetic therapy.

01:19:47.154 --> 01:19:51.580
Another reason why you should think genetic therapy is no different than pharmacokinetics.

01:19:55.026 --> 01:20:01.451
Antisense and ribozyme gene therapies represent an extension of this concept and they have not come to market.

01:20:01.951 --> 01:20:14.861
Approaches that involve the addition or modification of genes that are conceptually similar to protein replacement therapies, such as those for diabetes and hemophilias in the naturally occurring macromolecules are administered as remedies.

01:20:14.921 --> 01:20:23.568
Here again, not a very good sentence, but he's trying to suggest to you that we're just a matter of time before what we do now with a very ham-fisted ways of doing it,

01:20:23.928 --> 01:20:26.231
we can do very elegantly with gene therapy.

01:20:27.193 --> 01:20:31.659
Transient expression of exogenous genes, the use of artificial RNA.

01:20:31.679 --> 01:20:34.263
Oh, citing Wolf et al.

01:20:35.124 --> 01:20:37.888
1990, which is of course that wonderful paper that

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:44.043
that Robert Malone often cites but doesn't point out that the first author isn't even him.

01:20:44.563 --> 01:20:53.709
Gene therapy with the incorporation of a therapeutic gene into the cell's chromosome more closely resembles surgery in which tissue, oh that is just gross.

01:20:54.789 --> 01:21:02.434
Gene therapy with permanent incorporation of the therapeutic gene into the cell's chromosomes more closely resembles surgery.

01:21:04.215 --> 01:21:07.859
in which a tissue or organ is modified for the lifespan of the recipient.

01:21:08.679 --> 01:21:10.101
Stop lying!

01:21:10.461 --> 01:21:12.083
This is a really extraordinary article.

01:21:12.123 --> 01:21:13.244
Thanks, Mark, for the heads up.

01:21:15.743 --> 01:21:22.266
The discovery by Avery McLeod and McCarthy that a gene could be transferred within nucleic acids is a critical point of reference.

01:21:22.286 --> 01:21:25.148
I didn't look at that article, so I'll just go on and assume.

01:21:25.668 --> 01:21:36.993
Biologists have long attempted by chemical means to introduce in higher organisms predictable and specific changes which thereafter could be transmitted in series has hereditary characteristics.

01:21:37.073 --> 01:21:37.353
Okay.

01:21:38.014 --> 01:21:41.395
Trying to understand how evolution might occur or heredity might occur.

01:21:41.895 --> 01:21:42.756
Sure, that's fine.

01:21:43.692 --> 01:21:48.677
The capacity for viruses to transmit disease was first demonstrated in Salmonella.

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:54.282
Well, that's not what you demonstrated in Salmonella.

01:21:54.322 --> 01:21:56.284
You demonstrated bacteriophages.

01:21:58.191 --> 01:22:01.853
So there's a semantic shot over your bowel right there.

01:22:01.913 --> 01:22:16.520
If you're not biologically sophisticated enough to know that bacteriophages have a lot more proof of existence than RNA viruses do, then when he says viruses were first discovered in Salmonella, you won't even realize that he's already pulled the hat trick on you.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.201
The little, you know, cups with the ball inside of it.

01:22:19.221 --> 01:22:20.542
It's just moving all around now.

01:22:23.137 --> 01:22:31.341
The idea that viral genomes could become a biting part of the cell genomes was discovered with bacteriophages.

01:22:31.361 --> 01:22:34.103
Oh, he says it in the second sentence, not the first one.

01:22:34.503 --> 01:22:40.967
In the first opening sentence, he puts viruses as equivalent to bacteriophages, which they are not.

01:22:41.507 --> 01:22:42.227
Stop lying!

01:22:43.048 --> 01:22:45.809
And then extended to animal viruses.

01:22:47.610 --> 01:22:48.331
And so if

01:22:49.418 --> 01:23:17.769
If bacteria and bacteriophages are part of the same cycle of pattern integrity, and exosomes and higher mammals are part of the same pattern integrity, then the story of animal viruses being separate from and not a part of us, it falls right in place.

01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:24.534
It doesn't make sense, but it falls right in place for what bait-and-switch they're trying to do here.

01:23:25.355 --> 01:23:30.098
The ability of Roos Sarcoma virus transformed in cell culture to produce new virus.

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:33.701
So this is actually, that is actually Gallo.

01:23:35.282 --> 01:23:42.026
Roos Sarcoma virus is what he was mixing and matching in cell cultures all the time and producing more

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.801
is something that Gallo apparently proved here.

01:23:46.201 --> 01:23:48.802
So further studies of RSV infections.

01:23:48.902 --> 01:23:50.583
Oh, this is also Temin's work.

01:23:51.103 --> 01:23:57.786
Temin, of course, was one of these guys that was a contemporary of these guys that, of course, Mark Kulak has also covered.

01:23:57.846 --> 01:23:59.587
Nobody else, but Mark Kulak has.

01:24:00.287 --> 01:24:06.950
And others demonstrate the integration of SV40 DNA in transformed cells.

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.851
So again, we know that SV40 isn't a virus.

01:24:09.891 --> 01:24:11.512
We know it was just the name on a tube.

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:20.173
And we know that transforming cells just has to do with reverse transcriptase, which is an enzyme, not a virus, and it was found by David Baltimore.

01:24:21.274 --> 01:24:29.098
So here you can kind of see how all these ideas are mixed up shitty and regurgitated by their mentor-chained students.

01:24:33.519 --> 01:24:48.649
And here you have Joshua Lederberg writing a very conspicuous article with none other than the first author of the paper that Robert Malone touts as his primary lanyard to all the VIP rooms.

01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:55.674
The elucidation of the structure of DNA and its parsimony with DNA's surmised function

01:24:56.573 --> 01:24:58.915
brought forth an upheaval of biology.

01:24:58.975 --> 01:25:04.479
So we imagined that there should be something that was easy to copy and very high fidelity.

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:07.461
And then we found something like DNA and we said, well, we found it.

01:25:09.143 --> 01:25:10.884
Not saying that it's not it.

01:25:11.024 --> 01:25:13.746
I'm just saying that that's what he's saying here, right?

01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:18.870
That one of the reasons why we assume the DNA must be it is because its structure was so cool.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:35.761
The history of the subsequent discoveries of mRNA and the formulation of the central dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein, is chronicled in the Horace Judson seminal book, The Eighth Day of Creation.

01:25:37.267 --> 01:25:43.629
And of course this genetic information flowing from DNA to RNA to protein is what we are supposedly trapped in.

01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:55.314
That's the simple biology that makes a human being and everything outside of that where they copy DNA or they rewrite RNA or they use retro or use RNA, sorry,

01:25:55.874 --> 01:25:59.035
reverse transcriptase to write DNA backwards or whatever.

01:25:59.075 --> 01:26:00.475
That's all virus stuff.

01:26:01.975 --> 01:26:08.057
We live despite those things rather than in concert with them, never mind using them as part of our pattern integrity.

01:26:09.817 --> 01:26:16.039
So, speculations on gene therapy in the interval intermediately preceding the recombinant DNA era.

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:21.753
Key aspects of gene therapy were elaborated by forward-thinking investigators of the day.

01:26:22.454 --> 01:26:29.179
Edward Tatum predicted that viruses could be used to induce, to transduce, transduce genes.

01:26:29.219 --> 01:26:35.244
So transduction is a word that was often used and then replaced by transformation at some point.

01:26:35.284 --> 01:26:41.769
But transduction is a more specific term that at this time referred to using viruses to change the genome of a cell.

01:26:42.469 --> 01:26:49.395
So transduction is another term that you can put in your toolbox that these people have all known for decades.

01:26:50.216 --> 01:26:56.421
Transduction, transformation, transfection are all interchangeable terms depending on how you use it.

01:26:56.441 --> 01:26:58.502
You know, like isolation and purification.

01:26:59.063 --> 01:26:59.723
Stop lying!

01:27:01.707 --> 01:27:02.227
So here we go.

01:27:02.287 --> 01:27:10.609
Finally, it can be anticipated that viruses will be effectively used for man's benefit in theoretical studies in somatic cell genetics and possibly in gene therapy.

01:27:11.029 --> 01:27:26.072
We can even be somewhat optimistic on the long range possibility of therapy by the isolation or design of new genes into defective cells of particular organs.

01:27:26.133 --> 01:27:28.173
Sorry, I'm going to pause here and I'm going to get the

01:27:29.437 --> 01:27:31.997
the doc out that shows me how many people are here.

01:27:32.598 --> 01:27:33.258
Where is that?

01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:40.039
I still don't see it.

01:27:40.099 --> 01:27:40.939
Why don't I see it?

01:27:41.139 --> 01:27:43.179
It's not coming into my purview here.

01:27:43.339 --> 01:27:43.859
Get in.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.720
You should be here.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:49.360
I want you right there.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.841
Why won't you go in now?

01:27:51.061 --> 01:27:51.621
Come on.

01:27:54.901 --> 01:27:56.342
So where is the other doc?

01:27:56.502 --> 01:27:57.022
Stats.

01:27:57.102 --> 01:27:58.422
Twitstats is what I want.

01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:00.324
Ah, 89 people.

01:28:00.424 --> 01:28:00.964
All right.

01:28:01.004 --> 01:28:02.365
An hour and 27 minutes.

01:28:02.405 --> 01:28:03.045
That's perfect.

01:28:03.065 --> 01:28:04.526
That's exactly what I wanted to know.

01:28:05.326 --> 01:28:06.106
Um, okay.

01:28:06.146 --> 01:28:20.873
So Tatum speculated that because the basis of cancer is altered genes, treatment could be achieved by modification and regulation of gene activities or by means of gene repair or replacement indirect or ex vivo approaches toward gene therapy were also envisioned.

01:28:21.574 --> 01:28:26.356
Hence, it can be suggested that the first successful genetic engineering will be done with the patient's own cells.

01:28:27.756 --> 01:28:36.840
For example, liver cells grown in culture, the desired new genes will be introduced by direct mutation from normal cells of another donor by transfection or direct DNA transfer.

01:28:37.241 --> 01:28:49.427
But of course we already knew that because Robert Malone said he described that exact experiment and that experiment is what inspired him to just put the DNA or the RNA directly into the frog embryos or the chick embryos.

01:28:50.427 --> 01:28:56.170
And then he did that while he was teaching an embryology course and then that's what led to the idea of direct gene transfer.

01:28:57.008 --> 01:29:05.314
But they were first thinking, as Lederberg describes it right here, as the way they would do it is they would transfer a patient's own cells back in.

01:29:08.216 --> 01:29:21.405
Which is how I think they cured or claimed to have cured sickle cell anemia or something like that recently by ablating someone's bone marrow and replacing it with their own cells that were cultured beforehand and genetically altered.

01:29:24.417 --> 01:29:45.225
So the efficiency of this process and its potentialities may be considered improved by the synthesis of the desired gene according to the specifications of the genetic code and the enzyme of discernment, and in vitro enzymatic replication of this DNA, and by increasing the effectiveness of the DNA uptake and integration by the recipient cells as we learn more about the factors and conditions affecting these processes.

01:29:45.745 --> 01:29:48.186
So the more DNA we can make, the more likely it'll work.

01:29:48.686 --> 01:29:52.187
The cheaper and more accurately we can make that DNA, the more likely it will work.

01:29:52.627 --> 01:30:14.515
And so, when Kevin McKernan tells you so excitedly that the cost of making DNA has gone down to peanuts, when Ray Kurzweiler tells you that the making of DNA and the sequencing of it has gone down to cost peanuts, this is exactly what the same narrative that frickin' they were laying down in the 90s with this article with Joshua Lederberg!

01:30:16.257 --> 01:30:20.688
You know, the one that's in a photograph with the Sacklers and went to their funeral and stuff.

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:28.107
Tatum was extremely confident that gene therapy would be feasible with the knowledge of the structure and function of genes at hand.

01:30:28.347 --> 01:30:36.992
One of us speculated about the possibility of gene therapy in an October 24th, 1962 letter to Stanfield Rogers in Lederberg, personal communication.

01:30:37.613 --> 01:30:46.057
It will only be a matter of time, perhaps not long, before polynucleotide sequences can be grafted by chemical procedures onto a virus DNA.

01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:50.120
And of course, if you can put it onto the virus, then the virus can carry it in.

01:30:51.343 --> 01:30:57.809
which is exactly what Robert Malone was working on when he was working on RNA and viral assembly and packaging sequences.

01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:03.054
And you can look again at our notes and you can look again at that stream from two days ago.

01:31:05.171 --> 01:31:11.434
And so you can also look on Mark's website to find more about Robert Malone and Lederberg and all of them.

01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:27.662
In an attempt to be made to transform limber cells of a male offspring of a hemophiliac ancestry by introduction of carefully fractionated DNA carrying normal alleles of the mutant hemophilia gene, this experiment would appear to be entirely analogous to the typical attempts to transform

01:31:28.562 --> 01:31:30.324
transforming bacterial forms.

01:31:30.364 --> 01:31:35.410
So they're trying to do the molecular biology they think they can do in bacteria in people.

01:31:36.312 --> 01:31:41.478
And they're doing it by trying to transform the cells of people in culture and then put them back.

01:31:43.911 --> 01:31:55.519
Robert Malone is one generation ahead of this because he, again, described this interesting experiment in using retroviruses to transform mouse cells and then put those mouse cells back in the mouse.

01:31:56.199 --> 01:32:03.224
And that inspired him to think about direct transfection and transformation, which he is credited for, credits himself for having invented.

01:32:03.664 --> 01:32:07.848
This experiment would appear to be entirely analogous to transforming bacterial forms.

01:32:07.888 --> 01:32:20.639
However, it is not clear whether one should regard this as a pure example of genetic engineering, since the practical outcome would probably be best achieved by influencing the nuclear constitution of somatic tissues rather than directly tackling of the germline.

01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:27.745
So instead of changing the germline, what we should try to do is change the tissue in people.

01:32:29.566 --> 01:32:30.447
interesting argument.

01:32:30.467 --> 01:32:41.631
The precedence for this type of intervention would be that the virus mediated transduction, there it is again, of the genetic characteristics that was also demonstrated in bacteria almost 20 years ago.

01:32:41.671 --> 01:32:50.795
So transduction in this case seems to refer to the use of retroviruses to rewrite or add to the genetic complement of a cell.

01:32:51.235 --> 01:33:00.045
So that might be transduction, whereas transformation would be using just raw DNA to do that, and transfection would be to use RNA to do that.

01:33:00.926 --> 01:33:07.033
The proposal recently revived by Dr. S. Rogers would require the discovery or artificial formation of cryptic viruses

01:33:07.634 --> 01:33:12.035
to which specific genetic information relevant to the cure of disease has been grafted.

01:33:12.115 --> 01:33:22.659
So here again, Robert Malone was looking for packaging sequences that you could graft sequences to, and then that would trigger the packaging of those sequences, i.e.

01:33:22.699 --> 01:33:27.040
the manufacture of viruses with your gene of interest incorporated.

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:32.242
So again, we're describing all the ideas that Robert Malone was brought on the scene to claim authorship of,

01:33:32.682 --> 01:33:39.293
But actually it sounds like, and it looks like from the PubMed list of John A. Wolfe, that actually it's John A. Wolfe's idea.

01:33:39.834 --> 01:33:46.124
And Lederberg seems to give John A. Wolfe credit by deciding to write him, with him, a review.

01:33:47.915 --> 01:34:03.307
1994 right this is a review in 1994 if Robert Malone was the was the Was the intellectual juggernaut behind those papers then maybe Joshua Lederberg would have written this review with him But instead he wrote it with John a wolf who?

01:34:03.728 --> 01:34:10.653
Robert Malone seems to really have a hard time mentioning if you know of a video where he mentions him I really be great and to know where that video is I

01:34:13.126 --> 01:34:27.736
Rogers would require the artificial genome, once the essential techniques for grafting segments of DNA from different sources of that microbe have been perfected, experiments along these lines provide the most favorable opportunity to select these segments of DNA information which are needed.

01:34:27.776 --> 01:34:30.578
This describes the assembly of

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:47.214
of clones that Ralph Baric is blamed for, but of course you can see from this article, and you could know if Kevin McKernan was being honest, that the no-see-um technique that Ralph Baric is credited with is just simple ligation.

01:34:48.277 --> 01:34:49.177
It's so stupid.

01:34:49.738 --> 01:34:58.901
It's so stupid that they call it no-see-um when it's just using restriction enzymes to ligate DNA just like they do and we're already talking about for decades.

01:34:58.981 --> 01:35:15.388
It is a joke and it is so much a part of the Scooby-Doo that Ralph Baric was elevated as a molecular biology genius when in reality they've been talking about grafting DNA from different sources together and they've known how to do it with restriction enzymes for decades.

01:35:16.289 --> 01:35:16.889
Stop lying!

01:35:18.055 --> 01:35:26.697
In this way, it should not be extraordinarily difficult to obtain micro-DNA packets which are enriched with a gene, for example, for the synthesis of phenylalanine hydroxylase.

01:35:27.278 --> 01:35:34.720
One may, of course, argue that similar results could be achieved by the manipulation of tissue cells and culture as if they themselves were microorganisms.

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:47.183
Arthur Kohnberg's successful replication of DNA in a test tube was widely reported in the popular press as the creation of life in a tube and was viewed as an important milestone on the road to gene therapy.

01:35:48.906 --> 01:35:54.091
performed one of the earliest mammalian gene transfer experiments stated at a poultry breeders roundtable.

01:35:54.532 --> 01:36:09.246
When presenting our data at seminars and symposium in 62 to 64, we coined the terms gene surgery and gene therapy to stress the clinical potential of our work, but there was little interest in our results, probably because at the time prokaryotes, DNA synthesis,

01:36:10.307 --> 01:36:12.749
and the genetic code was at the center of the attention.

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:17.713
By the late 60s and 70s, gene therapy had become the subject of increasing number of articles and meetings.

01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:24.558
Shin Shimer ruminated on the prospect for designed genetic changes of mankind.

01:36:25.219 --> 01:36:33.706
And at Autumn 1969 meeting, Afosian advocated for the use of pseudoviruses derived from mouse pyelomavirus and placed in gene therapy.

01:36:35.046 --> 01:36:37.828
and place gene therapy in the pharmaceutical tradition.

01:36:38.389 --> 01:36:46.634
If considered the purpose of a drug to be restored the normal function of the body in some particular process of the body, then DNA would be considered the ultimate drug.

01:36:47.475 --> 01:36:58.642
But if you consider DNA a tiny sliver of the irreducible complexity of our biology that we should consider sacred, then it's not the ultimate drug at all.

01:37:01.604 --> 01:37:08.856
This entire article is trying to invert our understanding and appreciation and reverence for the sacred.

01:37:09.918 --> 01:37:15.608
And it is trying to twist it around into something that's just the same as pharmacokinetics, just putting drugs in.

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:32.596
In a 1970 article, B. Davis discussed the human genetic engineering and explored the feasibility of ethics of somatic and germ cell alteration, cloning of humans, genetic modification of behavior, determination of sex, and sexual reproduction.

01:37:34.577 --> 01:37:40.902
One of his major points was that control of polygenetic behavioral traits is much less likely than cure of monogenetic diseases.

01:37:41.442 --> 01:37:43.604
And of course, this is the fuel

01:37:44.602 --> 01:37:56.830
for the 20 or 15 years of gene knockout studies in mice to try and understand what single genes do by knocking them out and then culturing the cells or growing the mice if they do live.

01:38:00.132 --> 01:38:07.577
And this is the reason why neuroscience was so focused on single gene knockout models of autism for so long.

01:38:07.657 --> 01:38:14.102
Because again, one of the major overarching ideas pushed by people like Joshua Lederberg

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:28.136
is that monogenetic trait diseases are the low-hanging fruit of the eventual goal, which is being able to tackle polygenetic behavioral traits.

01:38:30.856 --> 01:38:44.405
And so you can see aspects of these ideas and aspects of Lederberg's kind of influence and thought leadership potential already in these papers and before, because of course, Mark has been documenting this.

01:38:44.445 --> 01:38:57.253
This paper is just extraordinary in how succinctly it tells you that gene therapy was a word combination chosen because of the Orwellian connotations of genetic engineering.

01:38:58.054 --> 01:38:58.714
Stop lying!

01:39:00.664 --> 01:39:01.188
LION!

01:39:03.482 --> 01:39:11.028
A symposium on gene therapy was sponsored by the National Institutes of Neurologic Disease and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health and the Fogarty International Center.

01:39:11.048 --> 01:39:21.516
The first session entitled Information Transfer by Mammalian Viruses included talks on recombinant SV40 viruses by David Jackson and Paul Berg and on RNA tumor viruses by Howard Temin.

01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:32.744
Other sessions were entitled Isolation of Altered Viruses with Specific Genes, Information Transfer by DNA, Mammalian Cellular Systems, and Immunologic and Medical Aspects.

01:39:32.924 --> 01:39:36.910
Several other articles and meetings brought gene therapy into more mainstream as well.

01:39:37.791 --> 01:39:46.784
So publishing papers with the titles, with the words that they want to develop, are the way that you get pandemic potential in bat caves and in laboratories.

01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:52.176
Surely there were other visionaries that an accounting of this early period would eventually reference.

01:39:52.316 --> 01:39:59.322
It is apparent that schemes for gene therapy occurred to many researchers once the basic of molecular genetics were established.

01:39:59.863 --> 01:40:12.114
Despite these premonitions, Friedman observed that it is not always quite so obvious as it is now that gene therapy is a rational and logical consistent approach to the treatment of some forms of human disease.

01:40:12.714 --> 01:40:15.276
from both the medical and scientific perspectives.

01:40:15.396 --> 01:40:25.843
Until fairly recently, the concept of gene therapy had been criticized by a sizable portion of the molecular biologic community as being remote and even improbable, possibly even unnecessary.

01:40:26.323 --> 01:40:34.169
In addition, several prominent scientists rejected the reductive view of DNA's role in biology and therefore implications for gene therapy.

01:40:34.209 --> 01:40:41.614
So that's a very shitty, tiny reference with shitty words to the fact that lots of people

01:40:43.579 --> 01:40:54.789
said that the model of how we're trying to claim that DNA results in RNA results in protein results in us as a pattern integrity was way too reductive.

01:40:56.110 --> 01:41:03.856
And therefore moving forward under the pretense that DNA and we understand it so we can squirt it in places was ridiculous.

01:41:06.118 --> 01:41:06.959
That's the addition.

01:41:07.279 --> 01:41:09.281
That's the admission that you're gonna get here.

01:41:09.321 --> 01:41:10.502
That's it, nothing more.

01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:20.392
Several studies in the late 1950s and early 60s revealed that cell cultures could take up radioactive DNA.

01:41:23.174 --> 01:41:25.256
The nuclear part.

01:41:26.198 --> 01:41:28.600
the radiation part, the mutation part.

01:41:29.061 --> 01:41:29.661
Interesting, huh?

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:31.202
Oh, they're just using it for tracing.

01:41:31.743 --> 01:41:34.966
The entry of radioactive DNA into the nucleus of cells was also reported.

01:41:34.986 --> 01:41:41.652
The ability for polynucleotide transfer to induce the N effect was provided by viral studies.

01:41:41.752 --> 01:41:48.197
In the late 1950s and early 60s, it was demonstrated that naked viral DNA or RNA is ineffective when applied to cells.

01:41:48.237 --> 01:41:52.841
This was first disclosed with plant and tobacco mosaic viruses and then reproduced with polio

01:41:53.502 --> 01:42:00.924
myelitis, semi-leaky forest encephalitis, influenza, and several other viruses in malignant cells.

01:42:01.604 --> 01:42:02.164
Interesting.

01:42:03.764 --> 01:42:21.068
This prompted a science review article that discussed the infectious disease implications of these studies, i.e., their release from infected tissues and resistance to antibodies may explain some anomaly.

01:42:22.841 --> 01:42:30.904
The infectious entity presumed to be polynucleotides was obtained by phenol extraction of the virus, was labile to nucleases, and not neutralized by antibodies.

01:42:43.936 --> 01:42:45.837
Doesn't sound like direct evidence of anything.

01:42:46.258 --> 01:42:57.505
For example, phenol extract of poliovirus yields RNA that produces plaque forming poliovirus when injected into embryonic eggs or when applied to monkey kidney tissue culture.

01:42:57.545 --> 01:42:58.706
I guess we got work to do here.

01:42:59.246 --> 01:43:01.668
I don't think these are good papers probably.

01:43:03.269 --> 01:43:08.393
Maybe these are some papers that were covered in the virology is a lie document.

01:43:08.793 --> 01:43:08.853
Um,

01:43:10.998 --> 01:43:25.280
In the studies of the effect of viral RNA concentration, solution composition, and temperature on infections of mango virus encephalitis in mouse fibroblasts, hypertonic saline and sucrose solutions were found to increase infectivity of RNA.

01:43:26.829 --> 01:43:32.833
infectivity of RNA rather than transfectivity or transformativity or activity.

01:43:33.293 --> 01:43:42.680
They call it infectivity because they are already building the synonymous with the, the synthetic RNAs are synonymous with the virus.

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.682
So they can use synthetic RNA and then call it infection.

01:43:45.702 --> 01:43:48.904
You see, see, you see what they're doing here.

01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:53.211
Exposure to hypertonic solutions, yes.

01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:58.135
Polio viral RNA uptake was also enhanced by high concentration of magnesium sulfate.

01:43:58.175 --> 01:44:05.260
Dubbs and Klinger reported higher efficiency of polio RNA plaque formation with the use of calcium depleted cells, blah, blah, blah.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:18.310
Infection is also facilitated by the fine cloudy precipitate, very probably a calcium phosphate formed when phosphate buffered saline is made by mixing its ingredients before sufficient dilution in water.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:24.941
It's just recipes and bacon cakes and whatever works to get more crap to get packaged.

01:44:26.842 --> 01:44:28.042
Whatever gets more plaques.

01:44:29.043 --> 01:44:36.585
The uptake of cellular or viral polynucleotides could also be improved by complexing with various proteins.

01:44:38.185 --> 01:44:44.987
Amos found that uptake of radiolabeled Escher E. coli RNA by cultured chick cells was enhanced by protamine.

01:44:46.289 --> 01:44:56.634
Other polycations such as streptomycin, spermine, and spermidine did not increase uptake but were observed to protect the RNA from RNAs causing precipitates to form.

01:44:57.254 --> 01:44:59.395
Causing precipitates to form!

01:45:01.206 --> 01:45:18.449
But ladies and gentlemen, one of the main objections of the no virus group is that when you apply streptomycin to these cell cultures, they form, that's what causes the cytotoxic effect, which you could describe as precipitates forming.

01:45:18.529 --> 01:45:20.970
And the RNA is forming the precipitate.

01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:23.990
You're gonna, number one, you're gonna see particles.

01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.891
Number two, you're gonna test positive for the RNA.

01:45:27.851 --> 01:45:29.674
And it's caused by streptomycin?

01:45:30.435 --> 01:45:31.256
Holy shit!

01:45:35.423 --> 01:45:39.208
The no-virus people are right, and Lederberg knew it, back in 94.

01:45:39.248 --> 01:45:39.549
They knew it in 1961!

01:45:51.755 --> 01:45:53.676
So this is all about DNA incorporation.

01:45:53.716 --> 01:45:59.040
I'm not going to read it all because it's a lot of terms that are just there's coxsackie cells and helo cells and whatever.

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:06.906
A potpourri of studies in the 1960s asserted changes in cellular phenotype by the transfer of non-viral genes.

01:46:07.466 --> 01:46:08.046
So here we are.

01:46:08.127 --> 01:46:10.568
Now we're not talking about viral genes anymore.

01:46:10.628 --> 01:46:16.112
Now we're talking about transferring endogenous genes or known genes to change things.

01:46:16.152 --> 01:46:18.253
So this is really transfection and transformation.

01:46:18.794 --> 01:46:27.860
Bone marrow cells and culture from patient homozygous for sickle cell disease express normal beta globulin peptide when the cells were exposed to DNA from normal bone marrow cells.

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:40.546
So again, this transformation experiment initiated in 1961 is still basically the basis for the sickle cell anemia cure that was recently published in the news.

01:46:41.286 --> 01:46:42.547
They're doing the same damn thing.

01:46:43.584 --> 01:47:02.536
and it's only become cheaper to do it and it's only become easier to do it and only had the excuse to do it because they have these lipid nanoparticles and they have this new technology that they rolled out during the pandemic that they're now claiming is brand new and improved and used to cure sickle cell anemia in the exact same shitty way that they were proposing to do it already in the 60s.

01:47:05.058 --> 01:47:11.282
Completely ignoring the irreducible complexity of our physiology and just saying that they already understand it.

01:47:23.894 --> 01:47:26.195
Okay, I'm going to do direct gene transfer into animals.

01:47:26.235 --> 01:47:33.257
I'm sure there's good stuff in all of this stuff, but a lot of this here in my scan here looks very, very technical.

01:47:34.378 --> 01:47:42.961
And so they're just talking about all the different ways that people got higher expression of the gene when exposing the gene in RNA or DNA form.

01:47:43.001 --> 01:47:46.702
So trying to bypass the need for what they call a virus.

01:47:47.952 --> 01:47:50.615
in order to get transfection or transformation to work.

01:47:51.336 --> 01:47:55.180
So then we go down here to gene transfer in animals.

01:47:55.861 --> 01:48:04.131
Perhaps the earliest predecessor of a direct in vivo approach was the use of vaccines, which permanently modified the body's response to infection.

01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:06.711
Interesting declaration.

01:48:07.291 --> 01:48:15.074
Vaccination with attenuated viruses may be viewed as a form of gene therapy, especially since the viral genomes may persist long-term.

01:48:15.114 --> 01:48:27.139
So again, here you have a very interesting attempt to equate gene therapy now, not with pharmacokinetics and drugs, but now they're trying to equate it with vaccination.

01:48:28.039 --> 01:48:31.680
And of course, we know that this is being done now, right now, today.

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:32.781
This is 30 years ago.

01:48:35.393 --> 01:49:01.577
And so you can see very easy how this evolution of these ideas, more importantly the evolution of these concepts, to try to steal from them the irreducible complexity, the sacredness, the reverence for what we don't understand, and steal from them all of the morality associated with those things, and equate them to the best drug on earth.

01:49:03.157 --> 01:49:14.905
equate them to a therapy rather than a ham-fisted meddling with an irreducible complexity that we should just respect and consider sacred.

01:49:17.287 --> 01:49:26.973
So another notion, so the ease of administration, relative cheapness, and long-lasting effects of vaccine are ideal qualities to which the proponents of gene therapy aspire.

01:49:27.013 --> 01:49:29.395
That's also a really gross statement, yuck.

01:49:31.069 --> 01:49:36.312
That sounds like something that Bret Weinstein would say in his best English using day.

01:49:37.333 --> 01:49:43.657
Another notion for direct in vivo therapy was treating bacterial infections by injection of bacterial phages.

01:49:45.558 --> 01:49:49.220
Although this therapeutic approach was discussed in Sinclair Lewis's novel Aerosmith,

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:53.433
There were several actual reports of successful use in animals and humans.

01:49:53.973 --> 01:50:01.159
The negative results of well-controlled studies and assent of antibiotics stopped further investigation.

01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:10.527
I want you to think about something very interesting that someone sent me in, wow, I got a lot of email here.

01:50:12.148 --> 01:50:17.433
Somebody sent me a really cool idea this morning, and I want to,

01:50:20.737 --> 01:50:21.557
Just a thought.

01:50:22.178 --> 01:50:28.380
This is coming from a guy by the name of, I don't even know his name because it's not in this chat.

01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:34.942
I am a robot says, I am a robot says.

01:50:35.782 --> 01:50:36.642
A message for JJ.

01:50:36.662 --> 01:50:38.143
You know, I just had a thought.

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:44.205
Why ivermectin might be recommended for COVID and why antibiotics were not allowed.

01:50:45.464 --> 01:50:53.108
maybe because bacteriophage transporters would be killed by the antibiotics, but not by ivermectin.

01:50:53.168 --> 01:51:13.339
Now, there was speculation a long time ago, actually, that what they did was they produced a bacteriophage and they released that bacteriophage so that people's own microbiota would express the spike protein, maybe cause people to get sick, but more importantly, would be detectable as a PCR signal.

01:51:15.174 --> 01:51:19.576
And so a bacteriophage containing the spike protein would be very, very interesting.

01:51:20.056 --> 01:51:26.199
And I know of at least one PCR test that uses a bacteriophage as its control.

01:51:27.559 --> 01:51:34.922
And so there's no doubt that there are bacteriophages that have been manufactured to contain the entire spike gene sequence.

01:51:36.323 --> 01:51:38.264
They were used as PCR controls.

01:51:40.612 --> 01:51:54.284
And so the idea that the PCR signal that we are finding was not present in us, but present in the bacteria in our noses, in our saliva, and in our microbiome, and therefore present in high quantities in the sewer,

01:51:55.293 --> 01:52:02.318
would be easily accomplished by manufacturing a bacteriophage with the spike protein in it.

01:52:03.098 --> 01:52:15.246
And then transforming or transfecting or whatever you want to call it, all of us or any of us in New York and elsewhere, where we intended to find it and we wanted to blame it on that, that toxin.

01:52:16.547 --> 01:52:19.548
we wanted to find that exact sequence, we would plant it there.

01:52:19.568 --> 01:52:24.949
And one of the ways to plant it there would be to plant it in a bacteriophage because then it might replicate.

01:52:25.929 --> 01:52:26.869
You might find more of it.

01:52:26.889 --> 01:52:30.070
It might spread around a little bit in the bacteria that it's replicating in.

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:30.610
Do you see?

01:52:30.630 --> 01:52:34.691
Do you see why this biology is so important to understand?

01:52:35.091 --> 01:52:45.613
Because the scenario that we are being offered on the television and on social media is inevitably a very simple scenario that doesn't acknowledge almost any of this complexity at all.

01:52:53.915 --> 01:53:04.447
Another notion for direct in vivo therapy, bacteriophages, the direct transfer of polynucleotides into tissues in vivo and in situ was attempted in 1960s as well.

01:53:07.210 --> 01:53:15.099
Peritoneal malignant and normal cells in the peritoneum and tours in situ took up radioactive DNA, but the foreign DNA demonstrated no functional activity.

01:53:15.911 --> 01:53:25.818
radioactive DNA injected intravenously or intraperitoneally in rodents were taken up by the spleen and bone marrow cells, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they were active.

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:30.864
So again, we're looking at this stuff.

01:53:31.064 --> 01:53:37.912
Early exploits of the human gene therapy in the Bayloid studies prompted many attempts to research DNA uptake by vertebrate cells.

01:53:37.932 --> 01:53:43.358
However, the study made the entire field of gene transfer into cells of higher organisms somewhat suspect.

01:53:43.378 --> 01:53:47.022
So apparently there's a thing here where they tried to do it, but it didn't work.

01:53:47.082 --> 01:53:48.043
We could probably read that.

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:57.243
The belated studies in ducks attracted enough attention to prompt several others and investigators to attempt phenotypic modification of DNA transfer.

01:53:57.263 --> 01:53:59.624
So Garrett, they must've done something in ducks.

01:53:59.864 --> 01:54:04.786
A Peking duck injected intrapreneurially, oh my gosh.

01:54:06.533 --> 01:54:23.564
So this paper in 1956 takes ducklings injected intraperitoneally with DNA extract from khaki Campbell ducks and says that they exhibited characteristics of khaki Campbell ducks in terms of body size and head size and that these effects were passed on to their progeny.

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:26.766
Ooh, that's an interesting paper.

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:37.760
to the dismay of pate manufacturers and Chinese chefs who were expecting a culinary breakthrough, these results in the ducks have never been reproduced."

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:38.740
Oh.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:49.526
And so that inability to reproduce that result led to the discrediting, or quote unquote, of the gene transfer studies in higher cells.

01:54:49.566 --> 01:54:52.948
And he's kind of saying, but that's throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

01:54:52.968 --> 01:54:53.708
We know it works.

01:54:53.748 --> 01:54:54.729
This just didn't work.

01:54:59.215 --> 01:55:00.275
So that's really cool.

01:55:00.915 --> 01:55:02.035
I'm going to keep reading this.

01:55:02.736 --> 01:55:07.856
I'm just tired, so I want to... Recombinants and blah, blah, blah.

01:55:11.637 --> 01:55:12.377
Here, we'll go right here.

01:55:12.417 --> 01:55:15.098
The advent of recombinant technology, because this is where we are now.

01:55:15.558 --> 01:55:17.458
This is where the Human Genome Project comes in.

01:55:17.498 --> 01:55:26.920
This is where production of DNA in quantity and production of DNA using a recombinant bacterial culture is now in its heyday.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.740
So let's read this part.

01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:40.927
It was not until early transfection techniques and selection systems for cultured cells were combined with recombinant DNA technology that major progress was made in gene transfer.

01:55:41.047 --> 01:55:52.554
Please see that that sentence is complete and total vindication of my four years of work to try and get someone like Brett Weinstein to teach people that transfection is what they're doing.

01:55:55.541 --> 01:55:56.562
See it for what it is.

01:55:56.862 --> 01:55:59.083
These people are traitors to our children.

01:56:00.784 --> 01:56:06.966
The isolation of a single gene enabled both greater efficiency and better documentation of its transfer.

01:56:07.487 --> 01:56:14.470
Greater efficiency would be produced by more production of that DNA, and better documentation of its transfer would make it easier to detect.

01:56:16.251 --> 01:56:18.672
Ah, using irradiated herpes simplex virus.

01:56:18.732 --> 01:56:20.712
I mean, it's so crazy, this.

01:56:22.273 --> 01:56:25.334
Fragments of herpes simplex DNA generated by shearing.

01:56:27.094 --> 01:56:27.574
I don't know.

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:29.655
Subsequently, other DNA.

01:56:29.795 --> 01:56:31.135
I'm not going to read any of this anymore.

01:56:31.175 --> 01:56:32.115
This is just crazy.

01:56:32.676 --> 01:56:34.996
Here's some more recombinant SV40 factors.

01:56:35.056 --> 01:56:36.517
We're using a bacteriophage.

01:56:41.518 --> 01:56:44.919
Retroviral vectors were developed by three different groups.

01:56:47.556 --> 01:56:48.617
which include Temin.

01:56:51.618 --> 01:56:57.242
So it's interesting, for example, that Robert Malone's never mentioned Temin, even though he's another mentor he probably descended from.

01:56:58.442 --> 01:57:06.767
So the conclusion, although the discovery of the central dogma of molecular genetics quickly led to the idea for gene therapy advancements,

01:57:07.839 --> 01:57:13.722
was hindered, advancement was hindered initially by several poorly designed studies.

01:57:14.382 --> 01:57:18.424
As the field has gained credibility in recent years, however, progress has accelerated.

01:57:19.104 --> 01:57:37.192
Central to this progress have been the discovery of basic genetic concepts in bacteria and bacteriophages and the elaboration of these concepts to mammalian cells, recombinant DNA technology, and mammalian gene transfer techniques, including viral vectors and physical chemical methods.

01:57:38.669 --> 01:57:45.218
So what I'm suggesting to you is that the equivalent of bacteriophage is not viruses.

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:49.964
Bacteriophages are part of the bacteria.

01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:57.622
pattern integrity, just like exosomes are part of the eukaryotic pattern integrity.

01:57:57.783 --> 01:58:12.766
And so to call them viruses and study them as things that are separate pathogens from us is being completely disingenuous to the discovery that is outlined and described in this article, which is that these exosomes are part of our pattern integrity.

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:27.492
And these geneticists have been trying to tell us that they are outside of our pattern integrity so that they can use them as tools without the moral and scrupulous consequences of those lies.

01:58:27.672 --> 01:58:37.937
They have convinced us that gene therapy is closer to pharmacotherapy than it is to disrespecting the irreducible complexity that is our sacred biology.

01:58:40.199 --> 01:58:57.662
The new field of gene therapy combines the advantages of pharmacology, namely the ability to treat human diseases with externally administered substances that have specific actions, and surgery, namely the ability to alter tissue or organ permanently.

01:58:58.403 --> 01:59:10.152
As such, dean therapy represents a more extensive, a more extension, more of an extension of established medical practice rather than an entirely new branch of medicine, one that could potentially

01:59:11.221 --> 01:59:13.504
Rather, sorry, I'm reading it wrong, it's so awful.

01:59:14.124 --> 01:59:19.090
As such, gene therapy represents more than an extension of established medical practice.

01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:27.178
Rather, it is an entirely new branch of medicine, one that could potentially revolutionize the way we treat human disease.

01:59:28.099 --> 01:59:28.400
Stop!

01:59:29.749 --> 01:59:33.072
That is spectacular, ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:33.512 --> 01:59:37.396
What a great recommendation for a reading by Mark Kulak.

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:38.537
Thank you very much for that.

01:59:38.597 --> 01:59:43.822
This show has been, you know, who the hell is John A. Wolfe?

01:59:43.882 --> 01:59:50.649
And I think we found out that he's somebody pretty important because Joshua Lederberg decided to write a pretty

01:59:51.309 --> 02:00:06.907
seminal review about these ideas with him in 1994, four years after John A. Wolfe was the first author on the naked DNA paper that Robert Malone carries around as his lanyard and access to all of the

02:00:07.768 --> 02:00:11.289
VIP rooms that he is regularly circulating through.

02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:20.891
The way that they pulled this off, ladies and gentlemen, is they're lying about 2020 and the murders that were committed, the fraud that was committed, and the mythology and the stories that were told.

02:00:21.372 --> 02:00:23.772
And those stories are continuing to this day.

02:00:23.832 --> 02:00:28.553
That's the reason why you have to call the faith a lie, because it's part of that mythology.

02:00:28.573 --> 02:00:30.334
It's part of those stories that involve

02:00:30.894 --> 02:00:36.239
gain-of-function research and the potential for the worst-case scenario being a gain-of-function bioweapon.

02:00:36.279 --> 02:00:46.289
This is all elaborate lies about transfection and transformation and transduction in cell culture and they are willing to murder people to keep this lie

02:00:47.249 --> 02:00:51.571
intact because it is how they plan to govern our kids for generations to come.

02:00:52.051 --> 02:00:56.173
If you want to understand this, you got to understand it from the perspective of lack of fidelity.

02:00:56.694 --> 02:01:03.777
RNA cannot copy itself very well and therefore if they want to study what RNA does, they need to make a DNA copy of it.

02:01:03.877 --> 02:01:14.802
Once they make a DNA copy of it, they can use the techniques described in this 30-year-old paper and described by Brian Artis on stage at the Red Pill Expo, although not very well,

02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:20.345
And they can use those techniques to make a lot of that DNA in bacterial culture.

02:01:20.365 --> 02:01:26.512
And then they can take that DNA and convert it to RNA using any number of techniques described in that paper and developed since.

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:31.058
And if they apply this RNA to DNA to cell culture, it's called virology.

02:01:31.098 --> 02:01:32.539
If they apply this RNA to DNA,

02:01:34.701 --> 02:01:36.182
to animals, it's called virology.

02:01:36.202 --> 02:01:38.783
And if they send it to their friends and they do it, it's called virology.

02:01:39.143 --> 02:01:42.725
The crazy part is that these techniques can be used to make large quantities of it.

02:01:42.745 --> 02:01:51.349
So it doesn't have to be like the virologists say, and they're just making infectious DNA clones in small quantities for my lab to work on.

02:01:51.389 --> 02:01:58.673
It could be made using the exact same equipment that has existed for 10 years already in these pharmaceutical companies to make a giant portion of it.

02:01:59.093 --> 02:02:01.034
and then you wouldn't have to call it infectious clones.

02:02:01.354 --> 02:02:15.420
You can be more specific and just say, you know, it's synthetic DNA and RNA made in quantity, which we've been able to do for a very long time and been trying to do for a very long time as so succinctly described by Wolf and Lederberg in the paper we read today.

02:02:17.475 --> 02:02:27.351
These people, especially Robert Malone, know very well they are descended from these same mentors, they are descended from these same idea chains, and that's why they are made to protect them, because they are part of it.

02:02:27.811 --> 02:02:32.198
It is a national security operation that didn't start in 2020, although it became public then.

02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:37.841
Ladies and gentlemen, they are hiding Pierre Kory and he's one of the greatest ways to red pill your friends.

02:02:38.782 --> 02:02:44.024
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:02:44.444 --> 02:02:48.386
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:02:49.827 --> 02:02:55.369
This has been Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information stream brought to you by a biologist.

02:02:55.810 --> 02:02:57.010
This is our main message.

02:02:57.450 --> 02:03:05.475
If you want to argue with us, argue with this main message, that the argument about the novel virus accepted the novel virus.

02:03:05.995 --> 02:03:11.758
And all of these people, Fauci and Malone and everybody in between, was responsible for us

02:03:12.618 --> 02:03:18.862
vigorously arguing about it, and vigorously engaging in the Scooby-Doo until we accepted the existence of the virus.

02:03:19.342 --> 02:03:21.924
And these people need to stop lying!

02:03:29.898 --> 02:03:34.942
Stop all transfections in humans, ladies and gentlemen, because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:03:34.962 --> 02:03:47.351
GigaOM Biological does need your support, and that means I need you to share the videos at stream.gigaom.bio, and anybody who can, I need you to go to gigaombiological.com and find a way to support.

02:03:48.071 --> 02:04:06.835
The work that I do with a large amount if you want to And you have it or a very tiny amount if that's all you've got and worst case scenario Please just work to share and make a habit of sharing the stream every day Because the stream is gonna be here every day at least once if not twice I'm gonna get some lunch head to the gym, and maybe I'll see you afterward.

02:04:06.895 --> 02:04:08.696
Thank you very much for joining me I'll see you again soon

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:47.707
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:50.512
Stop lying!

02:04:52.897 --> 02:04:54.320
Stop lying!
