WEBVTT

00:06.615 --> 00:06.735
you

01:13.630 --> 01:21.112
a test that could detect a virus when the virus wasn't present.

01:21.732 --> 01:29.154
And in addition to that, he didn't have virus, coronavirus, COVID-19 to work with, right?

01:29.454 --> 01:33.935
He was drawing the sequencing from a computer database.

01:34.315 --> 01:35.195
Is all of that correct?

01:36.503 --> 01:49.791
Yes, I would say he had an intention to pick up the virus when it was present, but in his design, he admitted that he couldn't do a very good job with imperfect information and it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

01:50.071 --> 01:52.973
And that it would pick up other Asian coronaviruses.

01:53.293 --> 02:00.498
And when you say pick up, meaning the test would indicate returning positive if there were other coronaviruses.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.579
And for the layperson, I didn't know this either,

02:03.095 --> 02:04.296
Everything is a coronavirus.

02:04.376 --> 02:09.760
I mean, things, I don't mean, many cold viruses are also called coronavirus.

02:09.800 --> 02:20.429
In fact, COVID-19, it sounded so exotic and scary when we first learned about it, coronavirus, but many, many ordinary cold viruses are coronaviruses.

02:20.769 --> 02:21.529
Is that correct?

02:21.630 --> 02:21.990
It's correct.

03:46.665 --> 03:46.886
you

06:57.990 --> 06:59.551
I think truth is good for kids.

06:59.971 --> 07:03.753
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

07:04.273 --> 07:05.914
We want everybody to feel good.

07:06.054 --> 07:08.295
That's not, that's not the way life is.

07:10.777 --> 07:14.699
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.200
And I have lied.

07:17.380 --> 07:18.261
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:18.281 --> 07:19.221
I don't want to lie.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.042
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:21.162 --> 07:22.203
I try not to be a liar.

07:22.223 --> 07:23.063
I don't want to be a liar.

07:23.624 --> 07:26.345
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:28.562 --> 07:48.749
introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

07:49.850 --> 07:53.191
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

07:53.967 --> 07:58.354
panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

08:02.100 --> 08:07.730
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

08:08.727 --> 08:14.973
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

08:15.254 --> 08:20.619
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

08:20.919 --> 08:22.861
It's just a big hassle in the end.

08:24.870 --> 08:50.965
know when when we have this new pandemic that is you know got 75 mortality and uh it it's not it's there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be i'm afraid that the latest data literally turning into a worst case scenario

08:53.305 --> 08:56.467
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

08:56.947 --> 08:58.788
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

09:00.749 --> 09:01.530
Isolation, what was it?

09:01.670 --> 09:02.930
Isolation and purification.

09:04.611 --> 09:05.352
Of the virus?

09:05.432 --> 09:05.652
Yes.

09:06.893 --> 09:08.654
Well, you isolate a virus by

09:15.453 --> 09:17.935
finding the virus which causes a disease.

09:18.575 --> 09:23.458
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

09:24.238 --> 09:26.100
I don't understand what the issue is.

09:26.120 --> 09:34.084
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

09:34.525 --> 09:35.805
Okay.

09:35.945 --> 09:37.767
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

09:40.896 --> 09:42.857
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

09:42.917 --> 09:45.219
I mean, he actually isolated it, so.

09:45.239 --> 09:48.961
I mean, why should I do all of this?

09:49.041 --> 09:51.062
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

10:26.488 --> 10:26.568
So,

10:56.800 --> 10:57.780
Good afternoon, everybody.

10:58.801 --> 10:59.441
7th of July.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.302
Happy birthday, Audrey.

11:03.543 --> 11:06.824
We are here again to try and dispel just a little bit of the enchantment.

11:07.464 --> 11:09.245
Help another person onto the boat.

11:10.605 --> 11:13.306
Help another person onto the ladder out of the cave.

11:15.687 --> 11:17.968
Even this cartoon is part of the cave.

11:19.128 --> 11:22.850
And if we're gonna do this right, we're gonna have to call it like we see it.

11:24.543 --> 11:30.869
And we are definitely in the interesting times that everybody hoped for when we were kids.

11:30.889 --> 11:35.713
And our consciousness is now the prime real estate that all of these people are competing to occupy.

11:35.733 --> 11:42.278
And it is not a matter of what's true that counts, but it is a matter of what is perceived to be true.

11:42.999 --> 11:48.303
And so you cannot underestimate how this race to occupy your mind is on.

11:51.069 --> 11:56.054
because they don't want you to be able to look back to 2020 and see that there was no spread in New York City.

11:56.615 --> 12:07.566
They don't want you to look back to pre-2020 virology and realize that virology was defined by transfection and transformation that they called infectious clones.

12:08.410 --> 12:29.504
They don't want you to be able to look back and see that placebo batches would have been the obvious way to do this, and they don't want you to see that hundreds of thousands of academic biologists and doctors should have done known better, that transfection in healthy mammals was dumb, and Brett Weinstein and other people could have brought us to that finish line earlier, and in fact they still haven't done it.

12:30.705 --> 12:40.935
The protocols were definitely murder, but nobody will talk about how supplementary oxygen, as high flow as necessary, was really crucial to the narrative in 2020.

12:41.735 --> 12:44.198
And gain-of-function remains a mythology.

12:44.218 --> 12:46.199
Anybody using that phrase stole it from me.

12:47.200 --> 13:01.125
Scooby-Doo is definitely a real mystery that they got us to solve with Rand Paul and Tony Fauci performing for us just like Peter Daszak performed for us and George Webb performed for us on 60 Minutes.

13:02.205 --> 13:07.767
These are all part of this ongoing national security operation to get you to believe

13:08.527 --> 13:13.371
that gain of function is not a mythology, but it's real and that the protocols were just the best that we could do.

13:13.971 --> 13:21.077
And it's a spectacular commitment to these lies that these people are engaged in and work together to cover up.

13:24.754 --> 13:28.935
So if you want to understand what's happened, it's pretty much these three things.

13:29.015 --> 13:33.577
Weaponized piles of money convinced us to argue about the origins of the virus.

13:34.217 --> 13:38.618
By participating in that argument, we accepted the premise of the novel virus by default.

13:39.499 --> 13:47.501
And we are still governed by this theater that spans from mainstream media all the way to social media platforms and includes all sides of this mythology.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.602
Not just Joe Rogan, but all the people below him.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.109
most of them were put there.

13:52.669 --> 14:01.494
And the way that you can see them is that they argue with each other and then they attribute bad motives to people like me, people like Mark.

14:02.055 --> 14:03.335
They don't even really talk about him.

14:05.156 --> 14:11.440
And that's really all they've got left because these weaponized piles of money need you to pay attention to the clown show that they've put together.

14:13.041 --> 14:19.865
The coordinated Lollapalooza of liars that they would love it if you'd just focus on the one that this guy created.

14:22.042 --> 14:23.143
But it's not that simple.

14:23.183 --> 14:25.306
It's not just the one that this guy created.

14:26.687 --> 14:37.860
It's not just the one that the WEF and these transhumanists have created with their nonsense about how AI and data collection is going to solve all of our problems in the near future.

14:39.526 --> 15:03.070
It is really about the history and I think Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS is really one of the finest examples of an American trying to characterize and archive the relevant American history and the connections between these people because it is ultimately how these ideas were generated and then passed on from teacher to mentor to student.

15:04.704 --> 15:17.190
And that's why we have Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits, and a lot of these people who have been involved with Tony Fauci for a long time, been involved with retroviruses and latent viruses and HIV for a long time.

15:17.570 --> 15:22.873
The same charlatans still have power over us, and if it's not the same charlatans, it's their students.

15:24.614 --> 15:28.196
And once you see that this all goes back to a few creeps,

15:29.503 --> 15:36.870
and that they've all descended from these few creeps, including some of these people, we might have a chance of taking the power back from these charlatans.

15:36.910 --> 15:45.479
I think it's actually possible to make gentle the life of this world as we pull our kids out of their mythology, but it's not going to be easy.

15:47.096 --> 16:00.206
to pull them out of the mythology that Fauci and his colleagues have created, that Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits have participated in creating, and Jessica Rose played her role in protecting.

16:00.927 --> 16:07.612
We've got to show them the fake wave of consensus and teach them to surf it, maybe even use it against them.

16:08.173 --> 16:10.474
But they've got to see that what they're doing is not real.

16:11.391 --> 16:17.796
It's going away from the deep water and it's too pure and it's too perfect and they ignore you just fine.

16:17.816 --> 16:23.640
It's a wave of consensus that you do not want to try and surf in the end.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.042
You really just want to get off of it.

16:25.702 --> 16:26.563
Get back to the beach.

16:28.686 --> 16:34.130
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you've definitely learned to stay focused on the biology and not take their bait.

16:35.131 --> 16:39.334
And probably also engaged in a little loving of your neighbor, which is really wonderful.

16:39.354 --> 16:43.477
We need to do this in America and around the world if we're gonna take our universe back.

16:45.854 --> 16:56.700
If we're going to bring back some semblance of freedom and sovereignty, I think it might be helpful if you could spread the word of this biology so that new people can find it.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.523
60 people at 14 minutes into the stream is absolutely fantastic.

17:01.543 --> 17:05.585
Thank you very much if you've already tweeted it out or posted a link.

17:06.765 --> 17:07.466
Thank you so much.

17:07.506 --> 17:09.106
I'm really excited to be here today.

17:09.146 --> 17:22.472
I think I've got a good set of short videos to share with you that will, if presented correctly, I think can really give you an insight into a time slice of what they're doing to us right now.

17:22.512 --> 17:30.355
It's really extraordinary how far we've come in four and a half years to accept a new world order based on Batcave viruses.

17:31.715 --> 17:36.217
But we can still, I think, cause a very big paradigm shift.

17:36.257 --> 17:45.060
I think it's possible that if we draw attention to the right things and ask the right questions that people can really be woken up in a way that none of these people thought possible.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.861
But it essentially requires that we stop participating.

17:48.301 --> 17:56.984
That's going to mean united non-compliance and engaging in it by getting off of social media or using social media that is free and federated.

17:57.764 --> 17:59.725
And free and federated.

18:02.506 --> 18:02.706
Oh!

18:26.832 --> 18:27.973
Good afternoon, everybody.

18:28.053 --> 18:30.294
It's 3.37 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

18:30.314 --> 18:31.694
This is GigaOM Biological.

18:31.734 --> 18:34.776
My name is Jonathan Couey, and I'm the biologist that brings you this show.

18:34.796 --> 18:37.157
It is 7th of July, 2024.

18:37.197 --> 18:39.318
I am a human just like you.

18:39.498 --> 18:41.439
I'm on Team Human just like you.

18:44.860 --> 18:46.661
And I think biology is the way out.

18:46.701 --> 18:50.902
At least it's what unites us all and unites us across ideologies.

18:51.422 --> 18:58.484
And that's why I think these three statements about the biology are a good way to start, especially with people who think they know a little bit.

18:59.285 --> 19:04.506
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

19:05.027 --> 19:09.148
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

19:09.688 --> 19:10.809
Let's debate those things.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.109
Let's talk about those things.

19:13.390 --> 19:17.072
Let's continue to move the ball forward about these ideas.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.472
This is basically what happened.

19:18.953 --> 19:27.637
Weaponized piles of money convinced us to argue about the origins of the virus, and by participating in the argument, we accepted the premise of the novel virus by default.

19:28.297 --> 19:33.360
And we are still governed by this theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms.

19:33.420 --> 19:36.381
It includes all sides of the mythology.

19:36.502 --> 19:41.204
And so that means that Tony Fauci and Robert Malone are on the same team.

19:41.264 --> 19:45.306
That means Rick Bright and Robert Malone are on the same team.

19:45.366 --> 19:51.930
That means probably Cadillac and Sina Bavari and David Hone and

19:52.610 --> 20:07.564
and Robert Malone are all on the same team, which means that because he doesn't mention Judy Mikovits ever, except for when he appears in music videos with her, it's also very likely that they are part of the same mythology that we're supposed to believe they are campaigning against.

20:15.663 --> 20:17.064
And so this is where we are.

20:17.104 --> 20:21.107
We've been in the car with these people for about four and a half years now.

20:21.608 --> 20:26.972
And being in the car with them isn't comfortable because there are multiple people in the car with you and they're all lying to you.

20:27.652 --> 20:32.936
Maybe some of them whisper into your ear about what the people in the front seat are doing, but they're all lies.

20:33.697 --> 20:39.942
They're to get you to choose a side or trust the driver versus the passenger or trust the person sitting next to you in the back seat.

20:41.038 --> 20:50.944
and as they undermine each other's narratives in front of you, it feels like you're figuring out something, and then you start trusting one of them, and that person is lying alongside of them.

20:51.184 --> 20:57.468
When they get out of the car and go into the fast food restaurant, they're gonna talk about what they're gonna talk about with you when they get back with the food.

20:58.789 --> 21:10.076
And that's what's been happening on Twitter, that's what's been happening on Facebook, that's what happens everywhere in Telegram, in Gab, in all these places, on Discord, it's all the same joke.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.784
that they give you a hamster wheel to run in.

21:13.824 --> 21:15.545
They make you feel like you're being heard.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.287
We're gonna get your message out.

21:18.068 --> 21:28.777
And then on Twitter, these people that pretend to be opponents do a very concerted, almost like a barbershop quartet from a malevolent dumpster fire.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.724
And so here you have Sasha Latupova harmonizing with Kevin McKernan.

21:38.246 --> 21:52.092
even though Sasha Latupova is supposed to be the arch enemy of Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone were on the same Senate hearing committee something something where Robert Malone basically populated the room.

21:53.732 --> 22:07.778
And so you can see it plain as day that somebody who's got me blocked, arguing with somebody who has tried to absorb anything useful she could from me without endangering the fundamental mythology,

22:09.221 --> 22:10.742
and been very nasty about it.

22:12.483 --> 22:26.253
And the elephant in the room, of course, is her very minor daughter before the pandemic and the absolutely hours and hours of disgusting videos that are available of her when she's clearly like 12 years old.

22:28.154 --> 22:30.616
And I don't know what kind of parent allows that to happen.

22:31.377 --> 22:35.820
I don't know what kind of parent allows their minor daughter to be used by Alex Jones

22:36.852 --> 22:44.337
But that same person is now harmonizing on Twitter with Kevin McKernan and has been for some time.

22:44.958 --> 22:52.583
She's had two full appearances on the Defender podcast because she's got so much intelligence to say, intelligent to say.

22:53.523 --> 22:55.605
And because she's such a skilled painter, I think.

22:59.113 --> 23:04.495
And so these people are all part of the national security operation that they purport to be blowing the whistle on.

23:04.535 --> 23:14.379
That's why it's really funny when Sasha Latupova says it's the DOD, because for her, it would be absolutely not ironic at all if she was actually part of the DOD.

23:14.799 --> 23:17.540
But it's not really the DOD that's doing it, of course.

23:17.600 --> 23:28.585
It's HHS, and it's the executive branch, and it's a lot of other intelligence agencies, all of whom are probably infiltrated by traitors who are working in concert to make this appear like it's something that's out of control.

23:31.104 --> 23:53.073
What you have to realize is that this little limited spectrum of debate gag that they've been pulling on social media lately, that we've become aware of on Twitter lately, they've been doing that behind the scenes at the government for years with lobbyists and dinner meetings and lobbyist meetings and lanyard meetings and top secret meetings.

23:54.363 --> 24:00.975
These are all places where a lot of times the illusion of consensus can be much more enticing, much more enchanting.

24:02.638 --> 24:06.906
And so while Noam Chomsky points out that they do that with the newspaper to you guys,

24:08.439 --> 24:13.521
That's still a limited hangout because he's not telling you that that's how lobbyists do it in the government.

24:13.941 --> 24:26.466
That's how the defense department or DITRA or somebody working for an intelligence agency would control a news outlet or would even control the office of some senator.

24:27.967 --> 24:32.529
By having multiple people lying in concert, but you don't realize that they're working together.

24:33.490 --> 24:38.272
They could all be Americans and still be doing that, and that's indeed what I imagine is done.

24:40.373 --> 24:46.135
That people conspire behind the backs of people that work in Congress and lie to them in concert.

24:47.436 --> 24:55.219
Of course, Noam Chomsky tells you that only happens on TV, but the worst, most malevolent examples of it are when people do it to you face to face.

24:55.659 --> 25:00.741
You know, like a meeting of four people on the internet, and three of them are definitely traitors.

25:04.352 --> 25:06.093
It's like sabotaging a tug of war.

25:06.153 --> 25:09.715
It's not very hard and nobody can really figure it out if they're actually trying.

25:11.876 --> 25:13.477
And it's been going on for decades.

25:13.517 --> 25:16.898
That's why Edward Bernays told us this in writing in 1924.

25:19.660 --> 25:28.224
And once you realize that Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and probably Pierre Cory and probably Peter McCullough and probably all of these people

25:29.377 --> 25:34.299
who rose early had to be co-opted or you would have never seen them.

25:35.299 --> 25:36.180
Some of them are dead.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.221
Some of them had their whole towns burned down.

25:40.801 --> 25:43.782
Some of them got to write books about ivermectin.

25:49.725 --> 25:57.988
And that's why you see me hammering on a Human Genome Project employee and serial entrepreneur for real

26:00.063 --> 26:14.753
Kevin McKernan, because he was put in place very early to control one side of the narrative, one part of the narrative, one angle on the narrative and put in place as a PCR guy, because he decided that he had to check the weed for coronavirus.

26:16.414 --> 26:20.856
And that's why I play him every day like this and say it, because that's what's happening.

26:24.259 --> 26:29.202
These people have misled us and they've misled us by lying to us in concert.

26:31.050 --> 26:57.471
Agreeing not to go to certain places with certain things like Brett Weinstein agreed not to say transfection often enough for it to matter to anyone even though he knew He knew I was yelling about it in 2021 because I was yelling at him Begging him for a zoom meeting so that I could explain to him why it was imperative that we taught everyone and why I wrote that review Why we had to pause this transfection shit

26:58.993 --> 27:00.534
And this is just two days ago.

27:01.335 --> 27:04.637
Him saying that it's not a widely understood term.

27:04.677 --> 27:06.198
Well, no shit, Sherlock.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.862
Says the guy with a million followers.

27:10.902 --> 27:14.405
Says the guy who gets like 50,000 new followers every three days.

27:16.987 --> 27:18.147
This is not by chance.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.210
It's a carefully orchestrated script.

27:22.825 --> 27:34.113
using a carefully orchestrated programming in social media to cause these people to rise because they still want us to teach our children that gain of function is real.

27:35.194 --> 27:36.615
They still need us to do that.

27:37.315 --> 27:39.137
That's still the primary objective.

27:40.080 --> 27:45.302
That's why none of these people will ever talk about what Jonathan Cooey says on these slides.

27:45.382 --> 27:50.524
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

27:51.144 --> 28:06.410
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent because all of the people at any university in America that are in the biology department or in the medical sciences, whatever, whatever's, all these departments are using basic molecular biology, which is transfection,

28:07.406 --> 28:12.369
and therefore they should have done known better and therefore it becomes criminally negligent that these people didn't speak up.

28:12.949 --> 28:32.621
RNA cannot pandemic and anybody that knows anything about the fidelity of copying RNA or has ever listened to a lecture by Mark Dennison or Ralph Baric knows that RNA cannot pandemic in the way that has been described by Kevin McKernan with the 16 or 17 million sequences that he believes in because the Arctic primers are great.

28:36.843 --> 28:57.681
in mind now all three scenarios all three lab leak natural gain of function applied start with a clean earth and that sometime in 2019 it's not clean anymore and it starts to spread and it goes around the world and it evolves in a very predictable way

29:01.021 --> 29:12.744
And now we've come to the conclusion that it's likely from gain of function, that the variants are culturable and evidence of evolution and lockdowns, if would have been done correctly, would have worked great because we see that from Australia and New Zealand.

29:12.764 --> 29:14.264
It's America that didn't lock down.

29:14.624 --> 29:17.005
And that's why we had such a disaster in New York City.

29:22.706 --> 29:25.767
And the variants continue Omicron, blah, blah, blah.

29:25.827 --> 29:29.308
Now we're looking for a high infectious variant Omicron, a Hivocron.

29:33.223 --> 29:36.505
And they are the ones who created this illusion of consensus.

29:36.605 --> 29:37.205
They did it.

29:37.886 --> 29:48.052
Geert van den Bosch, Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, Pierre Kory, hot tub circuiting it around the EU and America.

29:49.213 --> 29:59.299
They're the ones who created the consensus of a novel virus spreading that needed novel treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine or high flow nasal oxygen as high as it could go.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.021
Don't put them on a ventilator until you really have to kind of shit.

30:04.272 --> 30:04.873
They did it.

30:07.375 --> 30:16.442
And we were led to believe that they were speaking out because it was different than what was on TV and because they said Fauci bad, Dezak bad, Fauci bad, Dezak bad.

30:18.423 --> 30:23.868
And we were led to believe them because of an illusion of consensus on social media.

30:24.228 --> 30:28.651
And the way they are getting away with it now is because they ask dumb questions.

30:29.636 --> 30:30.877
Who's gonna come to our rescue?

30:30.917 --> 30:32.077
Is it gonna be Bobby Kennedy?

30:32.698 --> 30:34.659
Is everything under their control?

30:37.440 --> 30:43.244
Do they all have resorts outside of the ring of ice on the flat earth?

30:45.585 --> 30:48.186
Is that where they all go on vacation in their private jets?

30:53.409 --> 30:58.312
And the way they're getting away with it is not talking about 2020, talking about the COVID shot.

30:59.795 --> 31:04.297
I noticed that they've stopped talking about the contamination, and I think because we've blown it already.

31:04.797 --> 31:13.522
The contamination doesn't mean shit, because the lipid nanoparticles are nasty, and because transfection in healthy humans is nasty.

31:13.682 --> 31:14.682
It's a dumb idea.

31:18.364 --> 31:29.009
Even in a fantasy world where vaccination with a combination of substances injected intramuscularly works occasionally, transfection is so not that, and it's so much dumber.

31:34.150 --> 31:34.590
More dumb?

31:34.851 --> 31:35.371
I think dumber.

31:36.432 --> 31:37.093
Dumb and dumber.

31:37.113 --> 31:37.693
Yeah, that's right.

31:37.973 --> 31:38.974
The faith is a lie.

31:39.695 --> 31:40.896
It's a background signal.

31:41.176 --> 31:43.038
Many, many, many background signals.

31:43.158 --> 31:45.040
Many, many, many background signals.

31:45.580 --> 31:57.871
Untold numbers of background signals that allowed someone like Nathan Wolf to tour the world for four or five years with metabiotic claiming that this huge background signal was going to be the source of new life.

32:01.874 --> 32:04.755
I get so tired of it when people say that I don't mention metabiota.

32:04.775 --> 32:08.577
I've been saying metabiota for four years now because they are part of this illusion.

32:09.577 --> 32:30.687
And more importantly, they were evidence of this incredibly hot background that even before I realized the extent to which they've exaggerated the fidelity of their understanding, I at least understood that metabiota was a crazy example of how there's this background signal that they apparently think won't ever interfere with a PCR test.

32:32.734 --> 32:50.988
even though all the PCR tests that were ever granted in EUA in the United States only had to go against water controls and pure controls, not environmental controls, where there could be potentially unlimited sources of noise in the RNA and DNA range, which is just absurd.

32:53.456 --> 32:57.957
that none of these people talk about the potential for a background signal being misconstrued.

32:57.997 --> 33:10.820
A background signal from us, a background signal from out there, a background signal from our microbiome or from the many bacteriophages that are released and work with our microbiome.

33:10.860 --> 33:11.820
Like this is absurd.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.441
Transfection is the only thing that's for real.

33:17.682 --> 33:18.743
Sina Bavari knows it.

33:18.983 --> 33:19.884
David Hone knows it.

33:19.904 --> 33:24.567
They've got a patent on virus-like particles that can do all kinds of transfection fancy stuff.

33:25.147 --> 33:27.869
Great big long rod shaped ones.

33:28.630 --> 33:29.791
Look a lot like Ebola.

33:31.152 --> 33:36.095
Stanley Plotkin, interesting guy that nobody ever mentions, but Paul Offit wrote a book with him.

33:39.093 --> 33:42.996
Paul Offit wrote a big-ass book with Stanley Plotkin called Vaccines.

33:43.036 --> 33:50.802
It's about this big, you know, just in case it's, you know, you can't, can't be very understand, understand very much if the book is so thick.

33:51.343 --> 33:57.147
Holy sh... Who's gonna talk about Hilary Koprowski after Mark and me?

33:57.568 --> 33:57.888
Anyone?

33:58.629 --> 33:58.969
Anyone?

34:01.223 --> 34:02.664
What about the Barr family?

34:02.725 --> 34:09.431
Is anyone else gonna, anyone interested in the Barr family and the many interesting things that Mark has found?

34:10.272 --> 34:14.737
Not just with the latest guy that was working for Donald Trump, but his brothers, his father.

34:16.752 --> 34:18.033
What about Joshua Lederberg?

34:18.053 --> 34:31.499
How many times has Robert Malone, what was he like, you know, a fly on the wall when Joshua Lederberg was sitting at the table with a couple of his mentors talking shit or had a poster or at a conference over coffee or maybe even at drinks?

34:36.062 --> 34:38.383
How come he never talks about Joshua Lederberg?

34:39.491 --> 34:52.399
even though he was contemporaries in the retrovirus age with people like Gallo and Gardner and Baltimore that all probably sat down at the same table at one time or another and all probably had their postdocs around.

34:56.642 --> 34:59.944
Nobody talks about like important people.

35:00.604 --> 35:03.866
Fauci, DESAC, EcoHealth.

35:04.407 --> 35:06.088
Fauci, DESAC, EcoHealth.

35:07.810 --> 35:11.513
I mean, Jinky Leaks won't even say that Malone is obviously a crook.

35:13.114 --> 35:29.946
Because DITRA and 10 or 20 years of vaccine methodology peddling and private consulting and sitting in on study sections and whatever else he claims to do, bioethics expert, this kind of thing, that's not enough for Jinky Leaks.

35:30.607 --> 35:33.309
Robert Malone is still a pretty good guy relative to me.

35:34.639 --> 35:38.741
He focuses on Nick Hudson and, uh, you know, these really bad guys.

35:42.683 --> 35:45.704
So I've been focused on Robert Malone for quite some time.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.766
And yesterday I did a pretty good stream about Robert Malone.

35:49.786 --> 35:50.406
Was it yesterday?

35:50.466 --> 35:51.407
I think it was yesterday.

35:52.727 --> 35:57.750
Um, an old video of him on the Vajon health, um, from,

35:58.826 --> 36:05.413
June of 2021, where he basically gave away way, way, way, way, way, way, way too much.

36:06.634 --> 36:08.295
And so I want to go over what he gave away.

36:08.315 --> 36:11.979
Make sure that you go back and see that video if you need to see it.

36:11.999 --> 36:15.422
The first thing he gave away was that he worked on retroviruses.

36:15.462 --> 36:22.089
And that's really interesting because a retrovirus is only a retrovirus if it has reverse transcriptase in it.

36:23.211 --> 36:27.192
If there's no reverse transcriptase in a retrovirus, it's just an RNA virus.

36:27.232 --> 36:29.953
Now, I hope everybody can understand that.

36:32.173 --> 36:39.415
Because the next thing that'll come up on the screen kind of intellectually collaborates with that or harmonizes with that.

36:39.475 --> 36:51.398
Because if you worked on retroviruses, and by definition, retroviruses are just RNA viruses that have a reverse transcriptase enzyme in them, which is what

36:53.075 --> 37:00.281
Robert, I mean, David Baltimore got the Nobel Prize for, not for finding retroviruses, but for finding reverse transcriptase.

37:01.522 --> 37:06.486
So he worked on retroviruses, and more importantly, he was investigating packaging sequences.

37:06.546 --> 37:20.397
So he was looking at these small RNA sequences associated with, I guess, retroviral infection, and looking to see which one of these sequences would be sufficient to cause packaging

37:21.258 --> 37:23.699
and then what point mutations would do.

37:23.759 --> 37:40.168
So he said in that interview that he was already working with synthetic RNA and mutating it to see how it would change packaging, trying to understand the infectious cycle, but in particular what genes and proteins are triggering the packaging mechanism.

37:40.828 --> 37:43.390
which I would argue already exists in every cell.

37:43.870 --> 37:48.873
It's not that you're hijacking the cell and making it do something that it doesn't already do.

37:49.313 --> 37:55.277
You're hijacking known and existing machinery which signals with RNA and DNA by little exosomes.

37:56.918 --> 38:06.324
And in so doing, he was looking for the sequences that cause that, that can cause that, that could be associated with other genes that would cause those genes to be packaged.

38:06.364 --> 38:07.185
See, that's the trick.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.121
He was working on that.

38:09.201 --> 38:20.908
And more importantly, he told the story that he was working on that in parallel with other postdocs because it was such a cutthroat lab that they put multiple postdocs on the same thing.

38:21.368 --> 38:29.373
And it was so damaging to him that he got a doctor certified diagnosis of PTSD because it was just so cutthroat.

38:29.393 --> 38:34.377
He was told not to go there, but he did it anyway because of his passion for this molecular biology.

38:35.276 --> 38:48.351
And since then, he's worked with DITRA, DOD, The Who, many times presenting, even handing the mic off to Rick Bright in one video that we've watched, and NIH study sections to the tune of $50 billion, I believe.

38:48.371 --> 38:49.692
You can check that if you want.

38:50.813 --> 38:54.875
So he won't touch Judy Mikovits, mostly because they like to make music videos together.

38:55.555 --> 39:00.157
And he has worked at Solvay with Geert van den Bosch.

39:00.597 --> 39:08.180
And they actually did a COVID movie in 2021, where Robert Malone is wearing this like black taxi cab driver hat.

39:08.580 --> 39:12.242
And they're walking around in the mountains of Spain.

39:13.502 --> 39:14.843
And there's drone footage and shit.

39:16.175 --> 39:19.516
So this is a long-standing theater.

39:19.996 --> 39:29.000
And if you want to see more about it, I would again suggest that you go to housatonicits.com and look at Robert Malone's tab and then follow some of the links.

39:29.780 --> 39:35.923
Watch some of the videos and see, especially his latest, his last one about Robert Malone and this whole thing.

39:36.783 --> 39:40.324
There's just too many connections to write this guy off as anything other.

39:40.344 --> 39:44.766
I mean, he's really intimately involved in this.

39:46.087 --> 40:01.551
And that's why when he came on the Brett Weinstein podcast, he was kind of awkward because I think he was coordinating behind the scenes before they decided to put him in front of camera because, I guess because they were, the train was out of control.

40:03.972 --> 40:10.954
And so yesterday we watched the limited spectrum of Vajon, I believe, which was actually the limited spectrum of Malone, of course.

40:11.454 --> 40:14.775
And now Vajon has become the limited spectrum of Geert.

40:15.768 --> 40:17.849
And he was always the limited spectrum of Hert.

40:17.909 --> 40:22.290
Hert has been on his show, Vajon's show, like more than 20 times.

40:23.151 --> 40:31.594
And one of the earliest places that he came out was on this UK podcast hosted by Dr. Philip McMillan.

40:33.471 --> 40:46.864
And so that limited spectrum of Malone that we went back to in 2021 is very extraordinary in light of the fact that Geert van den Bosch has worked with that guy intensely and that that guy even plugs him when he's not on the show.

40:46.904 --> 40:48.546
He'll do a whole show about Geert.

40:49.046 --> 40:55.272
So over there, you have a group of people and other places like Hart.

40:58.027 --> 41:01.008
and all these different little groups on like drastic.

41:01.048 --> 41:09.111
They're all these little places where these people can infiltrate and steer and curate the narrative with some local infiltrators.

41:10.511 --> 41:25.036
Robert Malone can appear in CHD and as long as Mary Holland and Meryl Nass are in on the gig, then whenever anybody objects to it, they can pivot, make it okay and defend Malone when nobody's on the Zoom and everything is fine.

41:26.567 --> 41:30.729
Then they report back to Malone and say, yeah, they didn't really like that thing that you said before.

41:31.089 --> 41:35.972
And then the next time he shows up in the Zoom meeting, he can make sure that he says something that makes that doubt go away.

41:38.313 --> 41:43.936
And that's why Robert Malone is on so many podcasts so often, like Tommy and Shannon Joy.

41:43.976 --> 41:54.601
This is a circuit because it is a continuing titration of partial truths being curated by people that work for the state.

41:56.701 --> 42:05.944
That's why Robert Malone is now on the rational side of the flu debate, not talking about crazy stuff like gain of function, but just talking about matter of fact, there is flu.

42:06.404 --> 42:07.764
Matter of fact, it does jump.

42:08.044 --> 42:09.145
We've seen it jump before.

42:09.445 --> 42:11.565
There aren't very many infections, so don't be worried.

42:11.946 --> 42:23.509
And then the counterpoint of that, of course, is Brownstone and the Children's Health Defender that starts off with a story about firemen that are developing all different ways to make terrible fires, and then one gets out.

42:30.863 --> 42:43.020
And so today, I think it's really important that we focus on trying to see how malevolent it is that they won't talk about what they were doing in 2020, that they won't really talk about what they were saying in 2021.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.636
And they won't admit that they're still not saying transfection.

42:47.656 --> 43:00.398
They're still not teaching people anything about how transfection works.

43:02.259 --> 43:02.759
Uh, sorry.

43:07.100 --> 43:08.440
Now we should have a slide.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.801
And it's limited spectrum of off it.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.077
And I'm going to bring up a separate video here.

43:14.117 --> 43:16.418
I'm not going to use that to go in there.

43:16.458 --> 43:19.180
So first of all, I wanted to show you this, right?

43:19.220 --> 43:22.323
Because yesterday we watched a video.

43:22.623 --> 43:24.704
I'll remind you.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.026
We watched this one.

43:27.927 --> 43:29.228
This one was from June 21.

43:29.268 --> 43:29.588
What was it?

43:32.281 --> 43:34.342
June 21, Saturday the 5th.

43:34.422 --> 43:38.983
See, so this is like two weeks before he was on the Bret Weinstein podcast.

43:39.003 --> 43:41.124
So that's the reason why it's so raw.

43:41.784 --> 43:49.846
That's the reason why you need to download it and archive it because it's probably one of the earliest examples of the full pitch and how bad it is.

43:50.326 --> 43:55.108
How many details he has edited out as it evolved and as they reviewed it.

43:55.968 --> 44:04.665
Um, and, and so the whole start of that thing was he was super smiley and we were asking yesterday when we were watching the movie, is there a clear warning?

44:05.286 --> 44:06.047
And there never was.

44:07.372 --> 44:14.198
So then I want you to see this, that just today he has done another video here.

44:14.218 --> 44:15.139
Hi, good evening.

44:15.299 --> 44:16.460
I'm Dr. Philip McMillan.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.761
Thank you for joining me.

44:18.421 --> 44:23.826
And I'm keeping you updated with relevant news because GERT is stepping back.

44:23.926 --> 44:27.049
He's making a significant shift.

44:27.069 --> 44:29.911
And whenever GERT does anything, I take note.

44:30.729 --> 44:34.392
And I'm going to be going through his latest PDF here.

44:34.692 --> 44:36.434
I've highlighted a few points.

44:36.534 --> 44:37.515
It's like SARS-CoV-2.

44:38.455 --> 44:40.337
I am ready for a major change.

44:40.377 --> 44:41.678
So he's stepping back.

44:42.639 --> 44:48.503
And that usually indicates to me that he realizes that where we are,

44:49.406 --> 44:51.067
can't be fixed.

44:51.847 --> 45:12.295
Now keep in mind that Herit has said this several times that there would be a virulent variant because of some, I don't know, he called it infectious pressure or some shit and the point is is that he has been reiterating this every season since 2021 and one of the reasons why I wrote the review that I wrote in 2021 was because in December of 2020 and January of 2021

45:17.077 --> 45:25.284
I heard the theory of Herod von den Bosch, and I read some papers about Marek's disease, and it seemed like, wow, that's an interesting thread.

45:26.085 --> 45:43.019
Now, the one curious little detail here for me is that a guy by the name of Luigi Warren, a member of Drastic, and one of the people that was involved in Moderna and did a postdoc with RNA stuff,

45:45.453 --> 46:02.363
and was in a fold out in the USA Today in 2020, is the guy that sent me the Marek's Disease paper and kind of set me up to get excited about the same thing that Gerrit van den Bosch was excited about.

46:03.023 --> 46:10.167
And then I got contacted and encouraged to write that review, and I did write it and title it, Pause All Transfections.

46:11.832 --> 46:31.600
And while I made a lot of cogent arguments that weren't related to the virus, I also made the argument that Haaretz has been making and continues to make to this day, that the highly effective transfections to the spike protein are causing the immune systems of people that are infected to enrich the virus for highly infectious variants.

46:31.640 --> 46:36.822
And it's only a matter of time before these, before these transfected people are overwhelmed.

46:39.790 --> 46:41.973
And it will be a pandemic of the vaccinated.

46:42.854 --> 46:46.959
And so this is where they are now, which is kind of bizarre.

46:46.979 --> 46:50.443
There's almost no point to saying anything more.

46:50.463 --> 46:52.986
And this is what I think is coming across.

46:53.046 --> 46:57.812
Now, a lot of people still don't understand what Gert had said initially.

46:57.872 --> 46:58.713
And I had the

46:59.173 --> 47:22.036
privilege of speaking with Gert in 2021 when he made that first statement about... So he was one of the first guys to talk to Gert when Gert made his big predictions in 2021 and he was one of the first guys to talk to Robert Malone when they couldn't keep the script on the rails because people like me were saying stop all transfections in humans way too early.

47:27.839 --> 47:34.404
Now, what I want to watch, of course, is Beyond the Noise here with Offutt.

47:34.985 --> 47:42.431
From Microbe TV, this is Beyond the Noise, episode number 40, recorded on June 29th, 2024.

47:48.527 --> 48:05.483
One thing I would like to point out is that I did two bike rides on YouTube in 2020 about Helena Chan's paper that still hasn't been published, where she shows a very stable genome in all the sequences that were reported, whereas in the sequences that were

48:06.224 --> 48:23.016
were derived from the 2002 epidemic of SARS-1, there's quite a big change from sequence to sequence and seems to suggest that the SARS-1 signal, whatever that sequence was, was changing much more rapidly than the one that was

48:23.576 --> 48:36.201
found in Wuhan and also characterized in America and Italy and elsewhere, all of these sequences were highly homologous, which was quite an anomaly when compared to the data that we had derived from the original SARS outbreak in 2002.

48:36.401 --> 48:38.462
That paper is not there.

48:38.842 --> 48:51.488
Instead, she wrote a book with Matt Ridley and has been one of the leading experts on Twitter about the lab leak and is really skilled with GIFs and with long Twitter threads.

48:52.188 --> 48:55.931
and has been going really, really strong since May 2020.

48:56.692 --> 49:12.745
And now she's got a permanent position with the Broad Institute, which is connected to Whitehead, of course, the two places being Salk and Whitehead, where, of course, Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan both cut their teeth at these respective institutes.

49:12.765 --> 49:14.527
So here we go, Paul Offit.

49:16.642 --> 49:26.109
one of the high priests of vaccines, so much so that he is on a book with only three authors that include Stanley Plotkin, Walter Ornstein, and Paul Offit.

49:26.129 --> 49:29.892
It's a giant book of malevolent lying.

49:30.973 --> 49:31.353
Let's go.

49:35.516 --> 49:39.299
I'm Vincent Racaniello, and joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

49:39.459 --> 49:40.020
Hi, Vincent.

49:41.158 --> 49:48.926
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack called Beyond the Noise, cutting to the chase on important health topics.

49:49.426 --> 49:54.551
Today, we're going to take a closer look at Paul's column, Lab Leak Mania.

49:54.851 --> 50:00.056
Why did the New York Times publish an op-ed supporting the lab leak theory?

50:00.637 --> 50:04.941
So I want to ask you, Paul, what was your reaction when you saw this column in the New York Times?

50:05.341 --> 50:05.562
Anger.

50:06.767 --> 50:07.047
Anger.

50:07.328 --> 50:07.528
Yeah.

50:07.988 --> 50:15.195
Just the same reaction I had when I watched Dr. Fauci testify in front of a congressional subcommittee on June the 3rd.

50:15.215 --> 50:18.599
Oh, so he's talking about the Scooby-Doo performances, right?

50:18.719 --> 50:20.120
All these were performances.

50:20.160 --> 50:27.587
They were performances that were designed to provoke some kind of visceral reaction and then a bunch of people insisting on the truth.

50:28.468 --> 50:30.590
Of course, it's crazy to say it's a lab leak.

50:31.611 --> 51:00.718
and so he's on that ridiculous side but it's it's only feels like a ridiculous side and and it needs to feel like a ridiculous side so that robert malone really feels like he's a rational character so that that robert f kennedy jr feels as rational as possible i'm not really sure where this where this cruise ship is going to crash but i can guarantee you that they are not in control the way they wanted to be at this point and that's why everybody is freaking out the way they're freaking out

51:02.019 --> 51:04.941
This is an important issue, a very important issue.

51:04.961 --> 51:11.126
I mean, you have a, this is the third pandemic coronavirus in the last 20 years.

51:11.347 --> 51:13.689
I think it's safe to assume there'll be another one.

51:14.189 --> 51:17.292
And so it's very important to understand the origin of this virus.

51:17.432 --> 51:26.619
And I think we- It's weird because he says it's the third pandemic virus, but the first two that he claims were real infected less than 10,000 people.

51:28.999 --> 51:36.364
And now they're claiming that this one is still infecting people and that they were able to derive more than 16 million sequences.

51:38.925 --> 51:44.589
From the first SARS, we were able to get about 50 or 60 sequences or a couple hundred.

51:46.345 --> 51:53.791
And then we lost track of it, or we stopped tracking it, or I'm not really sure, but Mr. Jorstin was involved in that PCR test too.

51:54.651 --> 52:00.956
Michael Pottinger was involved in seeding that narrative too, who was involved in 2020 at the start.

52:01.997 --> 52:04.919
All these people that very few people seem to mention ever.

52:08.595 --> 52:18.623
You know, people like Jiki Leakes and Jonathan Engler and all these other people who just pretend to be heroes, but I don't think they're really doing anything.

52:18.663 --> 52:25.488
They're just creating chaos rather than bringing focus on the biological truths that we can all agree on.

52:27.210 --> 52:33.435
That Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits and Paul Offit and Vincent Racaniello are all liars.

52:34.704 --> 52:35.584
we do understand it.

52:36.264 --> 52:42.446
And so I think with that understanding, we have to be able to try and prevent or at least much more quickly respond to the next one.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.807
The lab leak theory is just nonsense.

52:45.827 --> 52:54.689
It's a complete waste of time and money, time that should be spent really trying to figure out how to prevent the next animal to human spillover event.

52:55.851 --> 53:02.575
And the farther away he is from being rational here, the more enticing it is for people that are still caught in the Scooby-Doo.

53:03.116 --> 53:05.597
Still, they're gonna throw things at their screen.

53:05.637 --> 53:07.318
Oh my gosh, he's such a liar.

53:08.539 --> 53:11.141
And that's exactly what this performance is meant to do.

53:11.181 --> 53:14.083
That's exactly what a lot of the performances are meant to do.

53:16.584 --> 53:20.687
And once you see it, once you realize that they're doing it in concert,

53:23.267 --> 53:25.529
It almost completely loses all of its power.

53:26.709 --> 53:43.901
Once you realize that Sasha, and Kevin, and Kevin, and Robert, and Robert, and Pierre, and Peter are all working together, it just doesn't matter anymore.

53:45.285 --> 53:46.286
We just got to get rid of them.

53:46.326 --> 53:46.907
That's the thing.

53:46.927 --> 53:47.327
It makes sense.

53:47.367 --> 53:56.235
It's a complete waste of time and money, time that should be spent really trying to figure out how to prevent the next animal to human spillover event.

53:57.497 --> 54:00.700
You make the statement in the article that two-thirds of the U.S.

54:00.760 --> 54:04.023
believe that the pandemic began in a lab.

54:04.523 --> 54:06.045
That's amazing, isn't it?

54:06.914 --> 54:08.835
That's the effect of the mystery.

54:08.955 --> 54:20.099
So the way that they got us to argue about it and the way that they got us to fight about it on social media, the way that Kevin McKernan said in 2020, that we have to go on Twitter because that's where the argument is happening.

54:20.139 --> 54:21.700
That's where the discussion is occurring.

54:23.641 --> 54:25.722
And that people got censored, but not censored.

54:25.762 --> 54:31.564
And then they rose up Elon Musk because he was for free speech, but all along they've been playing a game.

54:32.990 --> 54:39.132
All along we've been putting ourselves on lists, depending on whether we respond to their latest operation or not.

54:39.892 --> 54:43.253
Did we respond to the call to move to Gab or not?

54:43.273 --> 54:46.574
Did we respond to the call to go to Telegram or not?

54:46.614 --> 54:48.474
Are we subscribed to Locals yet or not?

54:48.514 --> 54:50.175
Did you join his Discord or not?

54:51.288 --> 54:59.655
These are all data points that are being used against us in coordination with these liars so they know where you are and what you're thinking and how they can play with you.

55:00.155 --> 55:17.268
So if they know that you spend time on Mike Eden's, or maybe not Mike Eden's, but if they know that you spend time on Robert Malone's telegram and they know that you have skepticism about somebody, they might put some thing on Robert Malone's telegram that will lead you to another place where that skepticism will be relieved.

55:18.789 --> 55:20.591
I guess Robert Malone's a good guy after all.

55:21.923 --> 55:24.726
These games are very deep.

55:27.028 --> 55:32.673
And yes, these people that are curating this side of the narrative are very segregated from people like Robert Malone.

55:34.254 --> 55:38.098
But they are, without a doubt, part of the exact same operation.

55:38.398 --> 55:44.343
They are definitely part of the exact same operation, even if these people are unaware of the other half of it.

55:45.945 --> 55:47.186
Robert Malone knows for sure.

55:47.861 --> 55:48.742
Although understandable.

55:48.942 --> 56:00.972
I mean, it's much easier to understand that there is an evil force working behind the scenes, some evil scientist who is working to create this virus and to then leak it out to the world to do all this harm.

56:01.272 --> 56:04.415
It's much easier to understand that than the sort of the mechanics behind

56:04.955 --> 56:12.340
going from bat to an intermediate host to a human and how that would occur, even though that's how it occurs.

56:12.420 --> 56:19.704
That's how pretty much 70% of the pathogens that infect humans occur or invariably have their source in animals.

56:20.785 --> 56:25.408
Personally, I think it's an indictment of science education in the US.

56:25.948 --> 56:28.249
I think people just don't understand it.

56:28.390 --> 56:33.733
And as you say, they look for the simple explanations that they get from movies, for example.

56:34.113 --> 56:37.977
By the end of the summer, there's going to be a lot more people that understand this, I can guarantee it.

56:38.657 --> 56:55.474
Because the mini-courses that I'm going to put out for the people that study and for the people that try, the mini-courses are going to... the mini-courses are going to really... they're really going to make something happen here, I guarantee it.

56:56.747 --> 56:57.128
Exactly.

56:57.148 --> 56:57.568
I agree.

56:57.769 --> 57:06.320
I think the people who have done all the work showing that this clearly was an animal to human spillover event should be out there more, although I think they try.

57:06.340 --> 57:11.928
I think it's much easier to be in the misinformation business than the information business.

57:13.584 --> 57:14.244
So Chan writes.

57:14.384 --> 57:16.706
So left-handed monkey wrench asks a good question.

57:16.746 --> 57:18.627
Why are we listening to this guy?

57:18.687 --> 57:19.628
Why would we listen to them?

57:19.708 --> 57:24.070
I want to show that that ongoing, that debate is still ongoing.

57:24.150 --> 57:27.572
This discussion of, of lab leak or natural virus.

57:27.612 --> 57:32.035
There's still people that are insisting on that because they need this limited spectrum of debate.

57:32.735 --> 57:36.957
Where if you go down a rabbit hole, you might meet, might meet Robert Malone.

57:37.778 --> 57:39.439
Who's pretty rational, remember?

57:40.039 --> 57:41.020
He's pretty rational.

57:47.708 --> 57:52.530
He's pretty rational, you know, avian flu is there and it can travel in cows and stuff.

57:52.550 --> 57:53.410
He's pretty rational.

57:53.430 --> 57:59.812
He's not like the defender or, or Brownstone that talks about gain of function being the source of this avian flu.

58:03.213 --> 58:09.655
And so he looks especially rational in between these guys and Paul Offit.

58:13.171 --> 58:17.514
And a lot of them look pretty rational in between Paul Offit and these guys.

58:19.135 --> 58:19.795
By design.

58:22.597 --> 58:37.687
Now the limited spectrum of debate that I've been trying to show you that includes this guy, Paul Offit, also includes... Door.

58:39.471 --> 58:41.095
And you might think, well, what in the world?

58:41.335 --> 58:44.241
How could he contribute to the limited spectrum of debate?

58:44.923 --> 58:48.971
Ooh, you're going to be shocked, because it's actually really gross.

58:50.734 --> 58:51.975
It's actually really gross.

58:52.235 --> 58:56.379
Now, I'm not taking a side about this particular issue, okay?

58:56.419 --> 58:58.941
I'm not taking a side about this particular issue.

58:59.421 --> 59:13.732
I just want you to see how a Five Eyes news network from Australia and Jimmy Dore are being used, wittingly or unwittingly, to create an argument about America.

59:16.174 --> 59:17.135
You're not gonna believe it.

59:17.675 --> 59:18.216
You're really not.

59:19.439 --> 59:23.401
Now, we're gonna talk to a gentleman from America, apparently very popular.

59:24.102 --> 59:24.342
Yeah.

59:24.362 --> 59:32.046
But he's actually been spreading malicious rumors about you and I. And calling us names like you, the tortoise, and me, the hare.

59:32.486 --> 59:33.766
I like the hare.

59:33.947 --> 59:34.687
Let's have a look at it.

59:34.707 --> 59:36.108
Yeah, that's a very good idea.

59:36.128 --> 59:38.029
Will you shut up for a bit?

59:38.189 --> 59:39.149
Look at this.

59:39.730 --> 59:41.190
So, Jackson, you went on this show.

59:41.230 --> 59:42.211
What's this show called?

59:43.772 --> 59:46.293
Uh, James Whale Unleashed.

59:46.937 --> 59:47.698
That's what it's called?

59:47.718 --> 59:49.160
I thought it was called the tortoise and the hare.

59:49.861 --> 59:50.602
spelled h-a-i-r.

59:53.652 --> 59:56.072
Show it, show the tortoise in there.

59:56.212 --> 01:00:06.374
Now keep in mind, they've already used Jimmy Dore to give Pierre Kory a platform, to give Jay Bhattacharya a platform, to give Robert Malone a platform several times.

01:00:07.435 --> 01:00:09.935
So Jimmy Dore is in the network.

01:00:09.995 --> 01:00:19.797
It's just a question of to what extent does he understand he's being played versus just, you know, I'm trying to get the truth out and I don't have a sophisticated understanding of what these people could be lying about.

01:00:20.277 --> 01:00:26.959
and I'm not going to ask what's behind the curtain anyway even if somebody shows up at my show and gives me an autographed book with their name in it.

01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:37.883
And so here's Jimmy Dore being used by again somebody outside of the United States to create an argument

01:00:39.192 --> 01:00:42.593
with two bad ideas and argue about it.

01:00:51.936 --> 01:00:54.697
Well, that's one of the biggest talk shows, apparently, in America.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.118
You can see why.

01:00:56.138 --> 01:01:01.440
So we thought we'd invite Jimmy Dore, who's got a very strange laugh, onto the program.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.360
See if we can make friends with him.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.901
I think he quite fancies you, to be honest.

01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:06.761
I like him.

01:01:06.821 --> 01:01:07.842
Very good evening, Jimmy.

01:01:11.716 --> 01:01:14.899
So well, he scrubbed up to come on the program.

01:01:15.319 --> 01:01:16.521
Very nice to see you.

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:21.726
It must be very difficult living in a country like yours.

01:01:23.227 --> 01:01:26.090
It must be difficult living in a country like yours.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.472
Do you see what we're doing here?

01:01:28.092 --> 01:01:35.435
They can be laughing and they can be ironic and they can be funny and tongue-in-cheek, but the message is really simple.

01:01:35.535 --> 01:01:36.415
America sucks.

01:01:36.955 --> 01:01:38.136
Americans are shitheads.

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:39.697
Americans don't understand.

01:01:40.157 --> 01:01:41.597
Americans made this happen.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.418
Americans sleep at the wheel, etc, etc.

01:01:44.518 --> 01:01:47.940
I have no romantic leanings to my friend here at all.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.981
When he says that, it's not really romantic.

01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:52.581
So if you're interested, let me know.

01:01:52.682 --> 01:01:53.742
It's raw energy.

01:01:54.525 --> 01:01:59.048
What about, what about, what about Jackson Hinkle?

01:01:59.088 --> 01:01:59.968
I don't know if you've seen it.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:00.548
He's gorgeous.

01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.889
He's got.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.090
Will you stop?

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:03.930
And he knows it.

01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:05.291
Ignore that.

01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:06.992
I mean, it's honestly, it really is.

01:02:07.552 --> 01:02:10.154
What sexuality we are is our own business.

01:02:10.174 --> 01:02:13.535
Got nothing to be going to appreciate a good looking man.

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:17.978
And the fact you're wearing a skirt under the desk, really, that goes a bit too far.

01:02:18.478 --> 01:02:19.419
Yeah.

01:02:19.859 --> 01:02:21.520
But yeah, well, he's quite

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.681
Quite entertaining, but we did have a go at him afterwards.

01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:26.042
I think he got a bit annoyed with us.

01:02:26.582 --> 01:02:28.283
But is he a friend of yours?

01:02:29.303 --> 01:02:30.584
Oh, yes, he's a friend of mine.

01:02:30.684 --> 01:02:35.526
You're telling me that you don't get stirrings in your loins when you're talking to Jackson Hinkle.

01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:36.286
Is that what you're saying?

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.087
18 years ago.

01:02:41.669 --> 01:02:42.989
How old are you?

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.630
You're the one talking about it.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.250
How old are you?

01:02:45.271 --> 01:02:46.711
I turned 40 18 years ago.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.269
I can beat you 74 next birthday 74

01:02:58.268 --> 01:03:04.832
Well, the only reason why somebody should be on the internet at 74 is because they're playing for the wrong team.

01:03:05.112 --> 01:03:06.553
Otherwise, you'd be retired by now.

01:03:06.613 --> 01:03:07.354
This is crazy.

01:03:07.434 --> 01:03:07.974
Oh, really?

01:03:08.074 --> 01:03:12.117
And if you're still on the air at 74, you should be, you know, doing well.

01:03:12.157 --> 01:03:12.958
Congratulations.

01:03:12.978 --> 01:03:13.198
Sure.

01:03:13.678 --> 01:03:14.779
You look fantastic for 74.

01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:16.620
Thank you very much indeed.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:22.464
You've got really good makeup downstairs, exceptionally good makeup, as I can see you have.

01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:29.506
My favorite thing when I watch your show is when you tell Ash you're going to sack him if he doesn't shut up.

01:03:29.746 --> 01:03:31.926
You promised to do that at some point in this interview.

01:03:31.946 --> 01:03:33.487
Oh, we've got a bit of use to talking about that.

01:03:33.807 --> 01:03:34.607
Oh, let's have a look.

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:38.468
This British couple should think about getting a divorce.

01:03:40.828 --> 01:03:42.609
So what I think is happening is that

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.972
He's intrigued with Jackson's hair, because he's obviously into hair.

01:03:47.092 --> 01:03:48.813
I'm going to fast forward.

01:03:48.913 --> 01:03:50.574
All of America and the rest of the world.

01:03:50.634 --> 01:03:51.494
I can't believe it.

01:03:51.514 --> 01:03:52.835
It's slightly embarrassing.

01:03:52.915 --> 01:03:53.575
I don't know what to do.

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:55.136
So they're still just joking around.

01:03:55.156 --> 01:04:00.299
And I'm wearing a sort of flowery shirt tonight, which is even more worrying, isn't it?

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:01.299
It is.

01:04:01.439 --> 01:04:05.942
I mean, obviously, I mean, that guy, Ash, has an amazing head of hair.

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:06.522
Thanks, man.

01:04:06.702 --> 01:04:07.703
It used to be better than this.

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:08.363
We got it cut.

01:04:08.523 --> 01:04:09.444
Yeah, this has been clipped.

01:04:10.322 --> 01:04:10.743
Oh, really?

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:16.369
I mean, if James Whale has been meddling in the UK since you were a kid, then you understand exactly what's going on here.

01:04:16.449 --> 01:04:26.161
It's collaboration between an American and a foreigner to bash and control, demolish the American culture and civilization and system.

01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:29.044
And then Jackson has his own, you know, amazing.

01:04:29.585 --> 01:04:32.008
They need to convince us to do it ourselves, right?

01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:36.334
We're not going to give up our guns.

01:04:36.575 --> 01:04:37.856
That's the problem here.

01:04:37.977 --> 01:04:40.119
You say I'm like the mother from Psycho.

01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:41.652
A little bit.

01:04:43.593 --> 01:04:45.274
When did you start doing this job?

01:04:45.394 --> 01:04:52.237
I have to confess I started doing it nearly 50 years ago after I'd been on the air as a DJ for a while and got bored.

01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:57.820
And talk is quite, it's not like it is in America.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.821
We have certain rules and regulations.

01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:04.963
that we have to abide by, which is really I've escaped them a few times.

01:05:05.043 --> 01:05:06.523
But yeah, you have to be very careful.

01:05:06.884 --> 01:05:10.085
But in America, most big cities would have their own talk stations.

01:05:10.705 --> 01:05:12.926
They'd have two or three national stations, wouldn't they?

01:05:14.907 --> 01:05:22.270
Yeah, yeah, there's lots of I have a radio show that was on in Los Angeles and New York, and now it's just out of New York at WBA.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:23.910
It's public radio.

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:24.911
It's not commercial.

01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:25.251
So

01:05:26.511 --> 01:05:28.412
It's you know, we don't have that kind of influence.

01:05:28.472 --> 01:05:30.673
I get to I get to be more free with what I say.

01:05:31.113 --> 01:05:32.393
Oh, that would be like the BBC.

01:05:32.413 --> 01:05:33.194
You wouldn't be safe.

01:05:33.694 --> 01:05:36.255
So that's how you bet on a referee.

01:05:36.435 --> 01:05:38.236
Let's let's get serious stuff now.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:47.259
When if anybody wants to set up a nonprofit where we would put together an AM radio station with national or worldwide coverage, just let me know.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:48.199
I would love to do it.

01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:52.021
I think I think I might have a voice which would be OK for the radio.

01:05:52.734 --> 01:06:14.334
going to sort the problems of the middle east out because it doesn't seem to be getting anywhere and this story about them so these two guys these two groups jimmy door show and and the whale unleashed are going to sort out the middle east and they're going to get into a very limited spectrum of debate and they're going to argue very vigorously within it

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.338
You see how it's done?

01:06:20.638 --> 01:06:26.543
Part of payments where apparently Hamas have been offering... No, this isn't Hamas, this is Jafarta do it.

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:28.044
All right, well... They all do it.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:28.584
Same to me.

01:06:29.725 --> 01:06:32.467
They're offering payments to go out and kill Jews.

01:06:33.148 --> 01:06:37.451
Well, if your son blows himself up or kills someone, you get a salary for the rest of your life.

01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:40.894
You get payments, thousands of dollars every, you know, a year they'll get.

01:06:41.494 --> 01:06:42.335
That's always been there.

01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:48.799
You know what I was thinking, because I know you're very pro-Israel in this conflict.

01:06:48.819 --> 01:06:50.020
Not anti-Hamas, anti-Hamas.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.301
I'm pro-common sense.

01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:53.443
I'm not anti the Palestinian people at all.

01:06:53.923 --> 01:07:02.589
I'm anti the people who want to go on and promote, like the marches we get, they've phased out a bit now, saying kill the Jews.

01:07:02.609 --> 01:07:07.733
I mean, if you're for the Palestinians, you should get rid of an authoritarian government that's running them under an iron boot.

01:07:09.298 --> 01:07:09.959
Yeah.

01:07:10.139 --> 01:07:16.447
Well, you know, the weird thing is, is that people always say, well, do you support Hamas?

01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:17.768
I'm like, I don't support Hamas.

01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:18.469
You know who does?

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:25.277
The Israeli government, the Likud party, Benjamin Netanyahu, suitcases and suitcases full of cash that they gave.

01:07:25.718 --> 01:07:27.420
And we all know why that happened now.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:37.909
because they always want to prop up a terrorist organization inside Palestine so they can say, look, we can't deal with these people, so we have to go in and wipe them out and take their land.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:42.113
That's a total conspiracy theory and you know it's not true.

01:07:42.153 --> 01:07:49.000
What worries me is here we are, we have a country with more explosives in it to blow up the entire planet.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:08:01.364
run at the moment by a geriatric who can hardly see or walk, and it's got his finger on the button, and loads of people in the media, like you, I'm afraid, Jimmy, who support terrorists.

01:08:01.805 --> 01:08:04.786
I mean, I'm quite worried about the future, to be honest with you.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.467
Okay, so that's enough.

01:08:07.507 --> 01:08:08.627
I don't know if it's a joke.

01:08:08.687 --> 01:08:09.928
Are they laughing?

01:08:10.848 --> 01:08:11.748
Is he laughing?

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:13.929
You see what this could be?

01:08:13.949 --> 01:08:16.150
Do you see how twisted and evil it could be?

01:08:17.515 --> 01:08:20.558
It's awful what's happening in our world right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:21.899
It's absolutely awful.

01:08:22.179 --> 01:08:25.322
And I don't want to dwell in it.

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:26.483
I just want you to see it.

01:08:26.543 --> 01:08:28.525
I want you to be able to see what they're doing.

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:30.327
It is lying in concert.

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:36.332
And the eventual pivot will be, I think, to some kind of thing where

01:08:38.806 --> 01:08:50.691
where the use of the internet and the use of censorship and maybe even the use of coordinated liars will be blamed for the pandemic.

01:08:50.811 --> 01:09:04.896
And so you can imagine a scenario where they could twist this around and say, you know, because there were all these anonymous accounts that were used against us to convince us of a lab leak, that maybe we have to have digital ID on the internet now.

01:09:06.152 --> 01:09:08.553
I mean, it's a weird scenario, but it's not impossible.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:12.736
And that's because these people are still playing the same damn game.

01:09:12.776 --> 01:09:16.798
They're playing this game where they don't talk about 2020 and 2021.

01:09:16.838 --> 01:09:18.019
They keep quiet about it.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:31.907
And they do that because they know that if you start to just talk about transfection as being virology, if you talk about the faith being a lie, then their whole story is bunk.

01:09:32.827 --> 01:09:33.628
It's all a joke.

01:09:35.094 --> 01:09:42.357
They've gotten us to argue about lab leaks and laboratory viruses and laboratory enrichment and passage.

01:09:42.797 --> 01:09:49.580
And it's all nonsense because this illusion of consensus about the worst case scenario was created by them.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.621
The illusion of worst case scenario was created by them.

01:09:53.681 --> 01:09:58.483
And they all know that it's just transfection in cell culture, transfection in animals.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.582
or infectious clone manufacturing because that's what they do.

01:10:03.642 --> 01:10:07.543
The RNA cannot be collected in the wild and grown in culture.

01:10:07.563 --> 01:10:16.247
It has to be sequenced and then it must be made in DNA form so that they can use bacteria or other means to create a lot of it.

01:10:17.452 --> 01:10:19.252
then they might have enough to work with.

01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:23.713
And so that's what they do often for coronaviruses because they have such a big genome.

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:38.576
They have to use several plasmids, which are just small circular DNAs of a particular length, and then stitch them together, which they give great credit to the wizard Ralph Baric for having invented, but it's actually just normal molecular biology.

01:10:38.976 --> 01:10:46.358
And then they mix it with an RNA polymerase or put it directly on cell culture or use electroporation like the electroporation company Inovio uses.

01:10:46.918 --> 01:10:49.559
And whatever they do, then they get virology.

01:10:49.619 --> 01:10:51.540
They put it on a cell culture, that's virology.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.920
They put it on an animal, that's virology.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.362
But it's transfection of these viral sequences.

01:11:00.143 --> 01:11:03.984
It's transfection of the animal or cell culture with viral sequences.

01:11:04.044 --> 01:11:12.767
Sequences they claim are viruses that they found in the wild, but in reality could be endogenous signals, or they're equivalent in the wild.

01:11:14.113 --> 01:11:24.975
And yes, these same methodologies that are used to make antibodies and venom, according to Brian Artis, are made in this exact way.

01:11:25.095 --> 01:11:28.395
They make the DNA, then they make the RNA, and then they make the protein.

01:11:29.636 --> 01:11:37.977
The trouble is, is that nobody seems to want to talk about the fact that infectious clones in the virology literature is just transfection.

01:11:40.358 --> 01:11:42.678
It's just synthetic DNA and RNA.

01:11:44.025 --> 01:11:47.326
And if you made it in quantity, you could put it anywhere you wanted to.

01:11:48.246 --> 01:11:50.146
Share it with any number of labs you wanted to.

01:11:50.266 --> 01:11:52.027
Always start at the right starting point.

01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:55.387
That's why there's something named SARS Urbani.

01:11:56.428 --> 01:12:04.529
It's an infectious clone, a synthetic DNA copy of some sequence found in a patient called Urbani in 2002.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:09.730
We should have a Sohomish County, SARS Sohomish County man.

01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:13.651
And we do, in fact, and they distribute it.

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:20.377
Ladies and gentlemen, these people have been lying to us in concert since the beginning.

01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:22.240
They are the other side of the equation.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.303
And this is one of the craziest ones right here.

01:12:24.364 --> 01:12:29.112
One of the ones that deserves the most scrutiny.

01:12:30.407 --> 01:12:35.952
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:12:36.413 --> 01:12:41.017
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:50.846
If you want to understand what has happened to us, understand that weaponized piles of money have convinced us over the last four years to argue about the origins of the novel virus and how to treat it.

01:12:51.426 --> 01:12:54.487
And that participating in that argument has actually accepted.

01:12:54.527 --> 01:13:00.828
We've all accepted and our kids will soon accept the premise that there was a novel virus and it was probably gain of function.

01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:08.029
And this theater does not just include the TV news and the newspapers and magazines.

01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:19.191
It also includes social media and Twitter groups and Discord groups and Telegram groups and DM Twitter groups on, I mean, it's everywhere.

01:13:20.765 --> 01:13:32.617
And it is a spectacular commitment to lies and the coordinated spectacular commitment to them that has allowed us to get to the point where millions, if not billions of people were at least transfected once.

01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:39.764
And so please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:13:42.699 --> 01:13:47.943
If you liked what you saw, please go to gigahomebiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

01:13:48.444 --> 01:14:01.975
If you liked what you saw and you want to share it, please share it at stream.gigahome.bio because that's the one that I pay for and it has no algorithms and it's not asking you to sign up.

01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:05.417
And there won't be any advertisements or anything like that.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:12.522
And you can embed it and you can download everything there if you want to make clips or you want to save them and share with your friends directly.

01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:13.863
That's also a great idea.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:17.045
We do have some conversations at GigaOM.bio.

01:14:17.365 --> 01:14:21.368
