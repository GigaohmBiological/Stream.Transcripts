00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:27.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, are you

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.080
This is whiskey three

01:00.640 --> 01:07.220
Julia Juliet whiskey whiskey three Julia Juliet whiskey CQ CQ CQ is anybody out there?

01:08.180 --> 01:10.520
I don't see anybody out there. What's going on?

01:11.760 --> 01:13.760
super strange

01:14.760 --> 01:22.160
I'm gonna wait to see if I get any indication of life. We may have a problem here

01:24.320 --> 01:27.120
Although I was getting yeah, I got internet there

01:28.920 --> 01:32.300
Testing one two there's Pamela. Okay, I guess we're all right

01:33.080 --> 01:39.220
All is well in the universe is if Pamela is in the chat. I guess I'll just hit it

01:43.760 --> 01:45.760
I

02:14.760 --> 02:18.400
Hello everyone, good to see you Jeff. Good to see you Jeff

02:20.120 --> 02:22.120
Good to see you Jeff

02:22.120 --> 02:27.560
Good to see you brother spoons small embers. I am Katniss always always Fletch

02:28.600 --> 02:31.660
their garden variety human, of course, they

02:33.200 --> 02:35.200
Janet Reno

02:35.320 --> 02:37.320
sexiest woman and

02:37.960 --> 02:39.960
In US legal history

02:40.320 --> 02:42.320
Good to see her in the chat

02:43.200 --> 02:49.340
Essentially a worst case scenario. I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case

03:09.960 --> 03:11.960
I

03:24.000 --> 03:29.600
Think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society

03:30.120 --> 03:34.380
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is

03:39.960 --> 03:48.680
How are we okay over here? I think we are just thought I would test to make sure

03:55.600 --> 03:59.880
This episode is sponsored by mink. That's moo plus link

03:59.880 --> 04:01.880
Mm-hmm

04:03.960 --> 04:11.520
This my point is that if if we were able to just like we're trying to get everybody to take the vaccine if we had

04:11.600 --> 04:16.920
Put that into getting everybody to take I've imagined in fluvoxamine for for a month

04:17.240 --> 04:21.160
If we and if we could accomplish that then COVID would be wiped out

04:21.160 --> 04:27.800
We could do it and actually any municipality that could regulate its borders could clear the disease if you could accomplish that go

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
I believe

04:29.880 --> 04:34.080
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

04:35.400 --> 04:38.520
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

04:38.680 --> 04:42.360
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

04:42.360 --> 04:45.720
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

04:49.920 --> 04:53.960
There's no way that what I just read in the chat is correct. I

04:54.680 --> 04:58.360
Am flat and not anime no way

04:58.360 --> 05:00.360
No way

05:00.360 --> 05:02.360
oh

05:02.360 --> 05:05.240
My oh my oh my

05:05.240 --> 05:07.240
I

05:25.720 --> 05:27.880
Well, at least you didn't say it was an AI

05:35.240 --> 05:37.240
I

06:05.240 --> 06:07.240
Oh

06:22.520 --> 06:28.080
Mark sure has been crushing it. This is so crazy. He sure has Jeff. You're right

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
Nervous

06:32.240 --> 06:34.240
You are very right

06:34.520 --> 06:38.200
We are putting pressure in the paint. We got the full court press on and

06:39.720 --> 06:42.120
Defense wins ball games ladies and gentlemen

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Yes, this is the full court press we aren't stopping

06:51.840 --> 06:53.840
We aren't gonna stop

06:54.720 --> 07:01.000
We are gonna maintain this pressure so that the knowledge can spread and the enchantment can be broken

07:01.200 --> 07:03.200
There is a critical point. I

07:03.680 --> 07:06.280
Don't know where that critical point is exactly

07:06.280 --> 07:10.160
But I know that there is a critical point if we stay focused on the biology

07:10.600 --> 07:15.040
If we don't take the bait that they are putting in front of our eyes and we love our neighbors

07:15.040 --> 07:18.280
We will get through this, but there are a lot of people who are still swamped

07:19.280 --> 07:26.000
And the way this is gonna work is that you need to help spread the word of this work every time you think it's worth spreading

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And you need to spread it

07:28.000 --> 07:34.600
Because that's the only way this works. I've got people supporting me. I've got a website where people can support me

07:34.600 --> 07:36.600
So that's gonna take care of itself

07:37.600 --> 07:43.000
People can find me a gig ome biological.com gig ome.bio and screen.gig ome.bio

07:43.920 --> 07:45.280
but

07:45.320 --> 07:51.600
The more important thing is to realize that the independent bright webs a very small group of people

07:51.960 --> 07:59.360
It's not that many we keep trying to think that there's there's other people, but it is really kind of just like, you know, maybe

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
Just a handful of people

08:03.920 --> 08:05.920
And everything else is an illusion

08:06.720 --> 08:11.600
people that have agreed to not talk about certain things and to focus on other things and

08:12.440 --> 08:16.640
Definitely not mention other things and so we need

08:17.360 --> 08:25.120
To pull our eyes down to pull our hands from our faces actually what we need to do is take our phones out of our face

08:25.240 --> 08:28.280
Take social media out of our faces

08:28.840 --> 08:33.800
Because that's what will free our minds from this. That's what will will emancipate our thoughts

08:34.400 --> 08:37.920
We've only got about 30,000 thoughts to take care of every day

08:37.920 --> 08:43.440
And if we give 10,000 of those thoughts over to these algorithms, which are really just programs

08:45.760 --> 08:47.280
They're not

08:47.280 --> 08:51.120
Sentient beings that that take all the onus off of their owners

08:51.600 --> 08:54.640
For all the damage that they do far from it in fact

08:55.040 --> 09:00.280
These are just simply programs which are designed to maximize your mental

09:01.320 --> 09:03.320
Enslavement and induce

09:03.560 --> 09:05.560
compliance

09:06.280 --> 09:10.440
And the illusion therefore is sustained through your active participation if you use

09:10.840 --> 09:14.360
Twitter and Facebook and all of these things without knowing what they are

09:15.480 --> 09:17.480
It is really

09:18.360 --> 09:20.680
It's really not going to work out for you in the end

09:23.960 --> 09:29.720
So this is gig ombiologic on the safest way to get biology in your head if you're looking at the chat and you see

09:30.360 --> 09:33.560
The word jeff from earth all smeared together

09:34.280 --> 09:40.040
That is a fella that has really taken getting this biology into his head very seriously

09:41.160 --> 09:44.760
And also a good supporter of the stream hello jeff

09:45.880 --> 09:47.880
It is the 19th of April

09:47.880 --> 09:54.680
2024. This is gig ombiological. It is a high resistance low noise information brief not just a jinger a jingle

09:54.680 --> 09:57.160
But a real thing and we are here

09:57.960 --> 10:06.040
Trying to form an organized resistance to the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of us the masses

10:07.000 --> 10:12.200
And this important element of democratic society has been weaponized against us and a lot of people

10:12.680 --> 10:15.640
That are purporting to save it save us from it's call it

10:16.200 --> 10:21.480
They call it fifth generation warfare and they say we're never going to be able to figure it out and that's really

10:22.040 --> 10:26.280
um one of the biggest lies of all and so that's one of the things that we're trying to

10:27.240 --> 10:29.240
tackle here on

10:30.360 --> 10:37.640
On gig ombiological. Let me just check this ding here to make sure i'm not getting dinged by somebody super duper important

10:40.280 --> 10:45.960
Anyway, the the principle of informed consent has been ignored for the duration of the pandemic of that

10:46.520 --> 10:54.040
I am quite certain. I think i'm going to put myself first here at the desk if you don't mind. I think this should work

10:55.000 --> 11:00.440
Uh, good afternoon. Um, this is gig ombiological. My name is jonathan cooey

11:01.240 --> 11:03.080
um, and uh

11:03.080 --> 11:07.960
I'm coming to you live from pittsburgh pennsylvania. I'm a little distracted right now by the dinging of the phone and stuff

11:07.960 --> 11:09.800
I'm going to turn that off

11:09.800 --> 11:15.240
Um, but some very interesting things happening in the background. Um, number one somebody on twitter

11:16.200 --> 11:20.200
sent me a link to a tweet about a case

11:20.680 --> 11:28.600
Which seemed to fit very nicely into this idea of a vaccine injured person in some way or another

11:29.160 --> 11:33.240
Needs to challenge and um and sue for damages

11:33.720 --> 11:36.520
And then some court needs to reject that

11:37.080 --> 11:41.800
Based on the prep act and then you have to appeal that and it has to get to a federal court

11:41.800 --> 11:46.520
And then the federal court has to strike it has being a seventh amendment violation

11:46.840 --> 11:50.680
And wouldn't you know it the case that was sent to me and got appealed to the

11:51.560 --> 11:56.840
The north carolina state supreme court or some nonsense like that in a little tiny footnote

11:57.160 --> 12:04.520
A little tiny footnote on page three of the appellate filing that was appealing this case

12:05.880 --> 12:07.880
with a little star

12:08.360 --> 12:11.560
Says that the federal claims were dropped in the appeal

12:11.880 --> 12:13.880
So

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
You can't win a seventh amendment

12:17.960 --> 12:22.760
Claim without appealing a federal claim against the you know a constitutional claim

12:23.400 --> 12:25.640
If you drop those claims, then what happens?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.760
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a very interesting case

12:32.840 --> 12:38.200
Please take a look at that. I'm gonna I'm trying to get all of the background paperwork together

12:38.840 --> 12:43.320
With regard to that case because I think it's really important to understand it as it stands

12:43.880 --> 12:45.320
Understand what was done?

12:45.320 --> 12:50.440
What wasn't done? What was said and wasn't what wasn't said because somewhere they got a footnote

12:51.160 --> 12:55.880
The constitutional claims got a freaking footnote in the appeal

12:56.520 --> 13:00.200
Which is extraordinary ladies and gentlemen an extraordinary

13:00.840 --> 13:02.840
Near miss bullseye

13:02.840 --> 13:06.440
For what we've been saying on this this stream for quite some time

13:06.440 --> 13:12.520
Thanks to some of the people that support and help and advise and communicate with us behind the scenes. This is not just me

13:14.120 --> 13:18.520
Switching from the back table to the front table and the back table the front table all day

13:18.920 --> 13:23.400
Figuring it out all on my own. I have friends and advisors and people that I listen to

13:23.880 --> 13:25.960
And and ask questions too

13:25.960 --> 13:33.400
And some people are trustworthy and other people aren't and it's taken me a long time to build up this network of people that I sort of kind of trust

13:34.120 --> 13:40.360
And uh, it is from this network that the identification of some of these, you know

13:41.240 --> 13:48.200
Seemingly glaring omissions in the general legal tact of most of the people that purport to save us from this system

13:48.680 --> 13:52.920
They don't seem to realize that strict liability could be a nice thing to say every once in a while

13:52.920 --> 14:00.280
They don't seem to realize that the seventh amendment is the way out if you want to give one judge the opportunity to strike the prep act

14:00.760 --> 14:06.360
That's the opportunity and yet here we have a perfect case where they actually dropped it

14:07.240 --> 14:09.240
They dropped it

14:10.360 --> 14:15.240
And I hope you can see how amazing it is that in all the discussion about that case

14:15.320 --> 14:17.720
That's not really the point that anybody makes

14:18.280 --> 14:23.240
There should be somebody from chd's own legal team swooping in right now

14:23.880 --> 14:30.440
In north carolina to say holy shit who convinced you to drop the seventh amendment portion of your claims

14:31.960 --> 14:33.480
But nobody will

14:33.480 --> 14:35.480
Maybe somebody from I can

14:35.800 --> 14:45.000
Maybe maybe erin siri will will drop in by by a helicopter or parachute and say why did you drop your seventh amendment claims? What are you nuts?

14:46.840 --> 14:50.600
But of course that's not going to happen and that's the that's the issue here

14:51.000 --> 14:54.520
You think that you're engaged in a in a in a

14:55.640 --> 15:01.960
Truthful and forthright debate with the people that run our country the people that sit on weaponized piles of money

15:02.280 --> 15:04.920
The people that control social media when in reality

15:05.480 --> 15:08.760
None of this none of this has been an honest discussion

15:08.840 --> 15:13.800
None of the information that's freely available is really useful in getting you out of this system

15:14.120 --> 15:18.360
And therefore you have no informed consent. You don't know you can't exercise it

15:21.560 --> 15:23.560
And

15:23.560 --> 15:25.880
So our hypothesis remains the same

15:27.480 --> 15:30.360
I don't know why that didn't advance. Maybe that keystroke didn't hit

15:30.920 --> 15:37.080
But our hypothesis remains the same and that is that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus

15:37.160 --> 15:43.000
Which was detectable by a nonspecific PCR test something for a background, which was most certainly hot

15:44.120 --> 15:46.120
And whether or not there was molecular

15:46.520 --> 15:51.400
Specificity for that background or non specificity for that background is irrelevant

15:51.400 --> 15:58.840
It could have been both because there were over 250 such diagnostic tests that were given EUA permissions to be rolled out at price

15:59.720 --> 16:02.200
In america nevermind the rest of the western world

16:02.680 --> 16:05.080
many of these devices and and and

16:05.720 --> 16:10.440
Medical devices is what they're called by the FDA as you heard the other day in that discussion

16:10.840 --> 16:15.400
Many of these medical devices were actually produced in china

16:17.000 --> 16:20.520
And what this essentially enabled is a theater to be created

16:20.520 --> 16:25.560
That was likely a theater specifically oriented around a couple things a couple stories

16:26.040 --> 16:28.040
Maybe one for example

16:28.440 --> 16:34.920
If jessica hockett is out there listen to this that just dawned on me after after coffee this morning

16:36.280 --> 16:39.160
Why in the hell is there no virus?

16:39.720 --> 16:44.200
Samples that are isolated from the outbreak in in new york city

16:44.200 --> 16:51.880
Why is it that the isolates that that the united states cdc decided to use as the standard for the entire

16:52.920 --> 16:55.320
Diagnostic standard set

16:56.200 --> 17:02.600
Is derived from a virus which was cultured in somebody in seattle where there were almost no cases at all

17:03.080 --> 17:09.000
Why weren't we culturing virus in every hospital in new york city trying to get a good sample of what was

17:09.160 --> 17:16.120
Happening there because obviously that one was pretty dangerous hit killed 20 000 people in four weeks

17:23.160 --> 17:26.920
Now the important thing to understand about the second paragraph there is that the

17:27.480 --> 17:33.480
The technology or the methodology of an infectious clone is actually how RNA viruses are generally done

17:33.800 --> 17:38.840
He identified an RNA sequence in the wild that may or may not be quote unquote complete

17:39.160 --> 17:41.720
If it's not complete you complete it with other genes

17:42.040 --> 17:47.640
Which are in the literature already published as minimally required for a coronavirus genome to work

17:47.960 --> 17:53.240
You assemble that in a dna construct you make lots of copies of that you and you you

17:54.600 --> 17:56.920
Convert that to rna using an rna

17:57.720 --> 18:03.240
polymerase usually a commercially available one and then you take that rna and apply it to your animal model

18:03.480 --> 18:09.320
Apply it to your cell culture and then thereby starting at the same starting point as everybody else would

18:09.640 --> 18:15.560
And although this seems innocuous it actually allows the creation of a purity

18:16.040 --> 18:21.000
And a quantity of rna in this format that that otherwise would not be

18:21.320 --> 18:26.840
Creatible with the samples taken from the wild or the cell cultures that are grown in labs

18:27.160 --> 18:33.160
Even when they take this infectious clone and apply it apply it to an animal or apply it to a cell

18:33.960 --> 18:39.080
You do not get replication competent virus in large quantities as a result

18:39.480 --> 18:44.920
You get a lot more rna you get a signal of rna you get a lot of subgenomic rna's

18:44.920 --> 18:48.200
And you get a lot of exosomes that contain some of those things

18:49.240 --> 18:51.160
But you don't get

18:51.160 --> 18:57.240
high fidelity reproduction of the original genome that you used from that you created from the clone

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
But because virology

19:00.680 --> 19:07.720
Has been very want to investigate further to apply the state of the art technologies of sequencing or or

19:08.360 --> 19:11.160
Or dna rna protein isolation

19:11.720 --> 19:15.720
To studying what happens in these clones when they're in cell culture

19:15.720 --> 19:21.480
But we just assume that that the psychopathic effects are indicative of virus and that the presence of the

19:21.960 --> 19:24.360
the sequences is indicative of replication

19:25.320 --> 19:27.800
the immune reaction and and

19:28.360 --> 19:29.800
and

19:29.800 --> 19:36.040
Whatever symptomology that's present in the animals is indicative of a viral replication, but they can't

19:37.000 --> 19:41.080
Actually show us that the infections cycle as they say it happens

19:41.560 --> 19:45.400
Happens without starting with the dna clone converted to an rna

19:45.800 --> 19:50.280
That's then applied and purported to be the equivalent of this

19:51.160 --> 19:54.200
What they say is a natural phenomenon that occurs all the time

19:57.000 --> 20:02.200
And so using this mythology which is almost exclusively exaggeration

20:04.760 --> 20:06.040
And using

20:06.040 --> 20:11.320
If needed a methodology of placing a sequence anywhere they wanted to using dna or rna

20:11.320 --> 20:18.760
Which either one would produce the kind of hot pcr positives that that they purport to find in sewers

20:19.480 --> 20:21.480
and also on

20:22.040 --> 20:25.000
counters on screwships and all this kind of thing

20:26.200 --> 20:32.360
And so in producing a clone you actually get two quantities a quantity of dna and a quantity of rna

20:33.880 --> 20:37.880
And i'm not even sure if it's not possible to you know

20:38.600 --> 20:45.480
react to the dna an awful lot with that enzyme you don't run out of dna and so it may be very possible to make many more

20:46.440 --> 20:52.440
you know orders of of quantity more than than of rna than the dna once you have the dna

20:53.800 --> 20:54.280
um

20:54.280 --> 20:59.160
But keep in mind that the dna is chemically much more stable and so if you wanted to seed

20:59.880 --> 21:05.960
pcr positivity or even sequence full genome positivity somewhere the dna would make it much easier

21:06.600 --> 21:11.800
Although the whole construct would be a little bit more tedious to make a spike protein dna

21:12.280 --> 21:17.800
Or a spike protein rna would be much much more trivial to make certainly a single plasmid

21:18.120 --> 21:23.000
And that was already present it was present in an oveos preparations. It was present in no

21:23.720 --> 21:28.200
Novavax preparation all of these different companies that were making a spike protein variant

21:28.520 --> 21:32.520
Either had to make a dna clone of the spike protein that they made into m rna

21:32.760 --> 21:37.160
Or they had to make a dna clone that they made into m rna that was made then into a protein

21:37.480 --> 21:43.480
So all of these different players were playing with a construct that if taken out of the laboratory and put in a sewer

21:43.880 --> 21:49.080
Or put on a countertop or or sprayed in a laboratory or in a in a hospital

21:49.160 --> 21:55.080
All the people that were exposed to it in some way or another might very easily test positive for that spike protein

21:55.400 --> 21:58.920
Irrespective of whether it was actually disease causing agent

21:58.920 --> 22:00.920
And

22:02.040 --> 22:09.800
So a total surrender of individual sovereignty and enforcement of a global inversion of basic human rights to basic granted permissions is the plant

22:10.120 --> 22:14.040
They want to get rid of nation states and make the most powerful

22:15.240 --> 22:18.520
Entities being supernatural and super national

22:19.720 --> 22:23.720
And this is basically the argument that peter bregan has been making for a long time

22:23.720 --> 22:25.400
It's a globalist

22:25.400 --> 22:30.760
Movement and so the people that are playing against us often say that the west is in danger

22:31.240 --> 22:35.000
Like brett weinstein often refers to the west as being in danger. No

22:35.640 --> 22:41.800
Each individual country is in danger and they are each individually infiltrated

22:42.120 --> 22:47.240
And the only way we are going to get out of this relatively intact is for us to kind of

22:47.960 --> 22:52.040
Decentralize and kind of focus on ourselves and kind of get

22:52.600 --> 22:57.080
United States back in order and the Dutch people need to pull their head out and do the same thing

22:57.560 --> 23:00.680
So do the people in ireland so do the people you know

23:02.280 --> 23:08.200
We are not ready to rescue canada when we we are not yet changing the prep act when there's there's a

23:08.600 --> 23:14.120
There's a case that was almost there and then they actually dropped their federal claims

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
And

23:19.080 --> 23:23.240
That's why you see such an agreement across these supposedly disparate

23:24.040 --> 23:27.480
Sources of information because they all agree on the basic premise

23:27.480 --> 23:30.760
Which is that vaccines are great and diseases are

23:31.320 --> 23:36.200
Definitely real on a pandemic sense and certainly gain a function viruses are as well

23:37.480 --> 23:41.240
And all of these people have agreed not to talk about any of this stuff

23:41.720 --> 23:43.400
Not going to talk about

23:43.400 --> 23:47.800
Any of the oxygen that was used which is really striking to me

23:47.880 --> 23:49.960
There should be and i'm going to say it every night

23:50.040 --> 23:55.080
I think until we're done with this this the covid shows when i'm not doing a covid show

23:55.160 --> 23:57.160
Maybe I won't do it, but holy man

23:58.040 --> 24:01.880
until someone else besides me or mark or

24:03.000 --> 24:06.600
Somebody's got to do it an MD has got to come out and say wow

24:07.160 --> 24:11.000
If we can confirm that they were giving pure oxygen

24:12.040 --> 24:14.760
At anything above 10 liters a minute

24:15.960 --> 24:19.400
I mean 10 liters a minute is already probably close to double

24:20.200 --> 24:23.480
What should be given what is normally given?

24:24.200 --> 24:28.760
And even that if it's pure oxygen shouldn't be given for many many hours

24:29.160 --> 24:32.840
But now if we turn it up in a mask form this kind of thing

24:33.160 --> 24:39.160
We are talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of people being mistreated injured

24:39.880 --> 24:44.600
Permanent long injury can occur from that and people could think that's long covid. Do you understand?

24:45.080 --> 24:50.040
Permanent long injury could have happened from that and people think it's long covid covid damage

24:53.240 --> 24:59.480
And so we need every doctor that worked into a hospital to reflect on this and question themselves

24:59.560 --> 25:05.640
Did anybody tell me to put people on high flow nasal oxygen for hours and hours? Did I do that?

25:06.520 --> 25:11.800
And if you are not willing to ask yourself this question you are a chicken shit

25:14.600 --> 25:20.920
Because this is the way we break them these are all this story should already have flown

25:21.640 --> 25:23.640
But it's not flying at all

25:24.600 --> 25:31.080
It should be just another thing that they add to this long list of stuff that we've already identified right

25:31.480 --> 25:34.920
This stuff we already identified we're allowed to talk about all this

25:35.640 --> 25:37.640
And

25:38.760 --> 25:42.680
And so I suspect that that that this is something very very serious

25:42.920 --> 25:49.640
It's something very serious because it means that thousands and thousands of people can be can be instantly

25:51.080 --> 25:52.680
culpable

25:52.680 --> 25:57.000
And so it's going to be a very hard thing for people to come to the realization of that

25:57.480 --> 26:01.320
Holy shit, there's a paper from in 1989 that shows

26:01.960 --> 26:08.760
Based on intuition and ICU like let's make sure that these patients that we can't talk to because they're in the ICU

26:09.160 --> 26:13.800
Let's make sure that giving them too much oxygen isn't causing some of the shit that we see in the ICU

26:14.200 --> 26:16.200
That was 1989

26:21.800 --> 26:26.520
Well done mark for having found that paper well done for having worked that down

26:26.920 --> 26:30.760
unfortunately that video I think has like 200 views on youtube because

26:31.320 --> 26:32.520
You know

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
Where are we?

26:37.560 --> 26:44.040
And so I think one of the most important points to make is they're a little tiny right there is that medicare and medicaid costs were avoided

26:44.040 --> 26:50.120
And not only that but medicare and medicaid costs are a gigantic portion of the federal budget and have major

26:50.440 --> 26:55.400
Gigantic portion of state budgets and this is something that is simply not talked about

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
I

26:57.400 --> 27:02.840
Might even feel a little better if they got somebody like that Kramer guy on an economic network to say wow

27:02.920 --> 27:10.120
We sure dodged a bullet with this with this covid because man oh man medicare was about to about to bankrupt us

27:11.080 --> 27:13.480
At least then they would be telling all the truth, right? I mean

27:15.400 --> 27:20.200
I think it's extraordinary that nobody mentioned strict liability of the seventh amendment violation

27:20.200 --> 27:23.960
I think it's extraordinary that that case in north carolina from just recently

27:24.440 --> 27:28.600
Decided to drop their federal claims when they appealed like holy

27:31.480 --> 27:37.960
And of course nobody is talking about zero epidemiological evidence of spread the stuff that daddy ran course showing since may

27:38.200 --> 27:44.520
2020 or june 2020 or I don't know august 2020 whatever it was a long time ago

27:44.840 --> 27:46.840
So

27:48.360 --> 27:52.840
This is that video that I showed last night from the pbs news hour just to remind you that

27:53.560 --> 27:55.800
back 11 or 12 years ago

27:56.600 --> 28:01.160
medicare cost was between 10 and 15 percent of the federal budget and

28:01.640 --> 28:05.240
Up to 40 percent of some state budgets and so it's very extraordinary

28:05.880 --> 28:06.840
um

28:06.840 --> 28:08.840
Look i'm a human just like you

28:09.240 --> 28:15.880
And I have made many mistakes in this pandemic one of the links on my website is titled scooby

28:16.360 --> 28:19.080
And if you go there, you will find a review that I wrote in

28:20.120 --> 28:27.640
Really started writing it in december of 2020 or november of 2020. I didn't really publish it until may of 2021

28:30.360 --> 28:32.360
Maybe partly because I was being meddled with

28:33.160 --> 28:35.160
uh, but this this review

28:36.200 --> 28:37.560
basically

28:37.640 --> 28:43.560
Says everything that potentially that here at bondon bosh was saying at that time and still says now

28:44.280 --> 28:46.920
Um, I was pretty convinced that there was a lab leak virus

28:46.920 --> 28:53.160
Although I was also convinced that we didn't need to worry about it because t cell was par t cell memory was paramount

28:53.160 --> 28:56.840
But I was arguing basically the immunomythology of

28:57.480 --> 29:04.920
Of viruses and the ability for an RNA molecule to go around the earth and in being there in 2021

29:05.720 --> 29:09.400
Um, and all the way until 2022 really

29:11.240 --> 29:11.800
20

29:11.800 --> 29:15.880
Yeah, I mean being there until 2022 or 2023

29:16.440 --> 29:18.920
Even the beginning maybe I don't know how long I was stuck

29:19.880 --> 29:21.880
in the lab leak narrative

29:21.960 --> 29:23.320
and and

29:23.320 --> 29:29.320
And stuck in the idea that an RNA molecule if it had the right attributes could go around the world

29:29.960 --> 29:31.960
indefinitely

29:32.440 --> 29:39.400
Um, it took me a very long time to get out from the spell of all the people that had enchanted me and you

29:40.680 --> 29:42.680
And so it is with very

29:43.640 --> 29:47.560
Great humility that I that I make these presentations great humility

29:48.120 --> 29:51.960
That I claim to now be on the right track and and worth

29:52.680 --> 29:54.680
um listening to

29:55.480 --> 29:56.680
And so

29:56.680 --> 30:01.240
Uh, the claim that I'm making right now is that there is a faith in a novel virus

30:01.240 --> 30:04.840
Which has kind of morphed into a faith in a novel biology. It's about

30:05.560 --> 30:10.200
A faith in a trackable gain of function RNA that went endemic and so

30:10.840 --> 30:14.680
We've seen a movie from 2019 produced by cnn films where

30:15.320 --> 30:16.200
um

30:16.200 --> 30:24.040
A journalist by the last name of garret is very succinct in saying that the worst case scenario and one of these lab leak things

30:24.120 --> 30:26.280
Would be for a virus like this to go endemic

30:27.880 --> 30:34.200
And of course the big debate for 2020 and 2021 that Brett Weinstein was still firmly in the belief

30:34.680 --> 30:36.840
That we could achieve is zero covid

30:37.720 --> 30:40.680
Which is of course the opposite of endemicity

30:41.560 --> 30:46.360
And so the debate of whether or not this gain of function virus or this lab leak or this

30:46.920 --> 30:50.040
Badcave virus would go endemic or not

30:51.000 --> 30:56.360
Is one of the debates that we were set up to have for almost two years by people like Brett Weinstein

30:59.160 --> 31:04.760
And that debate is very crucial if you understand that debate well then if you believe zero covid is possible

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
You're going to do every little thing that you can

31:07.400 --> 31:11.160
Including where safety glasses and and a bandana

31:14.040 --> 31:19.480
And so this ruse goes very deep because they also within this wove

31:20.520 --> 31:25.000
What they expected to be the biology of the transfection they wove it in

31:25.800 --> 31:29.160
to the the worst case scenario of the virus

31:30.920 --> 31:39.720
And so I do think that it is very likely and certainly we have all the methodologies and and and technologies necessary to pull this off

31:40.280 --> 31:43.160
Without a hitch that they likely

31:44.040 --> 31:46.040
Uh

31:46.760 --> 31:55.800
They likely designed the spike protein to be an immunogenic protein which was capable of activating the immune system more than a few times

31:56.680 --> 32:00.600
one of the problems with typical antigens chosen from

32:01.480 --> 32:02.760
from

32:02.760 --> 32:08.840
Wherever they choose antigens from is that your body if it's exposed to this antigen four or five times

32:09.560 --> 32:15.160
Will inevitably build up a tolerance to it or a severe reaction to it in either way

32:15.640 --> 32:21.880
it's probably not very good and so this is um generally speaking one of the reasons why

32:23.640 --> 32:30.200
Historically vaccinologists would usually claim that two exposures to a vaccine would be more than enough

32:30.920 --> 32:32.920
um and this this

32:33.640 --> 32:35.240
sort of

32:35.240 --> 32:37.640
Hold the bait space has been kind of closed

32:38.200 --> 32:40.840
um, but it is important to realize that

32:41.640 --> 32:45.160
Irrespective of whether that debate space is open or closed

32:45.880 --> 32:52.360
the the whole background system that has to do with immunology and vaccinology and

32:52.920 --> 32:54.920
public health and disease

32:55.160 --> 32:57.160
Has maintained

32:57.160 --> 33:00.680
From very early on you saw in marks program a couple days ago

33:00.680 --> 33:08.040
He showed a an article about a jona sulk having met with alice e more and how they were talking about how

33:08.740 --> 33:15.480
Antibody explaining how vaccines work and that vaccines make antibodies these little soldiers that protect us from disease

33:15.560 --> 33:17.560
so antibodies and this

33:17.560 --> 33:22.600
full-on commitment to antibodies as being central to the immune response

33:23.160 --> 33:27.480
um of a mammal is one of these lies that they are spectacularly committed to

33:27.640 --> 33:29.640
and

33:29.640 --> 33:30.760
And

33:30.760 --> 33:35.160
And I think that it is very likely that they designed a protein

33:36.200 --> 33:42.680
And then seeded this sequence using infectious clones in places where they knew it would get reported including

33:43.160 --> 33:49.720
In Wuhan including in iran, maybe including in italyan and including in seattle, washington in this homeish county man

33:51.240 --> 33:53.960
And that's why there are no cdc

33:54.760 --> 33:56.040
you know

33:56.120 --> 34:03.000
standard samples from new york city that the standard sample from the cdc is from the sahomish county man in washington

34:04.680 --> 34:11.080
Even though supposedly there was enough coronavirus in in in new york city to kill 20 000 people in four weeks

34:13.800 --> 34:17.560
And again, i'm thinking that's what this fear and cleavage site that's with this

34:18.200 --> 34:23.080
You know the fear and cleavage site is really interesting because what that second fear and cleavage site does

34:23.160 --> 34:27.000
That's the important thing to realize. It's a second fear and cleavage site not a first

34:27.800 --> 34:31.240
the second fear and cleavage site allows a small fragment of

34:31.880 --> 34:33.720
S-1 to go floating free

34:34.200 --> 34:39.720
Which of course is one of the requirements for any kind of linked recognition and b-cell activation to occur

34:40.280 --> 34:44.440
You need to have antigen floating around in the system that can pass through the lymph nodes

34:44.840 --> 34:49.000
And activate activate otherwise dormant or or naive b-cells

34:49.880 --> 34:55.640
And so this floating fragment that we're supposed to believe is going to interact with ace two and all this other crazy shit

34:56.040 --> 34:58.280
Is actually probably just a piece

34:58.840 --> 35:04.840
Have antigenic protein that they knew had to be free in order to get a repeated antigenic response

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
Again, he need to add little

35:07.960 --> 35:12.600
Little annoying proteins to the blood if you want seroprevalence to go up every time

35:13.000 --> 35:17.800
And it would be interesting to think about that from the perspective of what they might have wanted to do

35:18.280 --> 35:20.280
If they wanted to get people to accept

35:20.440 --> 35:24.360
Transfection one of the ways to get it to accept is to show how effective it is

35:24.360 --> 35:27.560
I mean even four doses you still get a boost in antibodies

35:28.120 --> 35:31.560
And there is no doubt you can confirm it with hundreds of videos

35:32.040 --> 35:37.000
That on all sides of the aisle there are people that will confirm to you that antibodies are really important

35:37.080 --> 35:40.120
And it's interesting to note that every time you get exposed to the virus

35:40.520 --> 35:47.400
Or every time that you get you get injected you have an antibody boost an antibody boost looks like the boosters also give

35:47.800 --> 35:49.800
a nice antibody boost

35:50.840 --> 35:53.880
And my guess is this would not be the case with all proteins

35:54.360 --> 35:57.320
My guess is this protein is engineered to be that effective

35:57.640 --> 36:01.400
And in so doing that theater would require the planting of a sequence

36:02.360 --> 36:04.680
And the way they would plant that sequence is using an

36:05.240 --> 36:11.480
Infectious clone or using a transfection or using an RNA or a DNA that they could produce using standard methods

36:11.880 --> 36:13.880
That have already been around for 10 years

36:14.120 --> 36:16.920
You choose how they did it for your own particular

36:17.320 --> 36:20.040
Explanation in your head, but as far as I'm concerned

36:20.040 --> 36:24.360
It's a crime scene and any of those possibilities remain wide open and to be yet determined

36:25.720 --> 36:30.360
And at the same time if you remember they are laying down this narrative because they want

36:30.840 --> 36:35.080
The biology the mythology covers an expected range of damage

36:35.800 --> 36:40.680
As we transition a population into wide spread testing of the transfection technology

36:40.760 --> 36:45.640
That's what the spike being a weaponized prion was now you might think wait

36:46.040 --> 36:48.920
Who's talking about the spike being a weaponized prion? Well

36:49.480 --> 36:53.160
One of the most conspicuous ones is somebody who works at MIT

36:54.280 --> 36:59.800
And she has been saying for a long time that the spike protein itself is something to be focused on

37:00.280 --> 37:05.400
And from the perspective of what I just rambled on for a little bit there of I don't think that's crazy

37:05.800 --> 37:08.760
If you think of the spike protein as a designer protein

37:09.160 --> 37:11.640
That was designed to make sure that

37:12.200 --> 37:17.880
Transfection in many forms was going to be successful in terms of meeting the minimum bar

37:18.760 --> 37:22.040
Of getting people to produce antibodies at every exposure

37:22.520 --> 37:25.640
Then that would be the protein you would choose to use

37:26.360 --> 37:30.600
For the first rollout of transfection in mass

37:30.920 --> 37:32.920
I

37:34.360 --> 37:41.960
Think it's a very interesting hypothesis that certainly is not real certain but it's an interesting hypothesis to consider

37:42.680 --> 37:45.400
It's one to toss around because I do I am

37:45.880 --> 37:52.360
Generally speaking quite sure that all of the mythology of the of the worst case scenario was thrown around

37:52.520 --> 37:56.680
Very vigorously in 2020 to make sure that we would accept it as a possibility

37:57.160 --> 37:59.160
So that we would also accept

37:59.480 --> 38:01.320
Maybe

38:01.320 --> 38:07.080
Maybe with a little regret the the the rollout of a transfection to respond to it

38:07.640 --> 38:12.840
And fortunately many people in the united states and around the world said no so there still is a control group

38:12.840 --> 38:14.280
There's still people

38:14.280 --> 38:16.680
Holding the line and that means that there is a chance

38:17.080 --> 38:22.440
There is a chance that the truth will come out that they will be exposed by the very methods that they thought they would enslave us

38:23.080 --> 38:27.720
The phone the internet and a control group that they thought that they could eliminate

38:30.120 --> 38:33.320
So again, one of the things that I said we were going to cover was prion disease

38:33.320 --> 38:37.640
This is a image taken from i'm going to switch over here image taken from a a

38:39.000 --> 38:43.800
Nature review article which basically in cartoon form shows what happens

38:44.200 --> 38:50.360
According to the prion a protein only hypothesis and its refinements in the base state prions comprise

38:50.920 --> 38:55.400
solely or predominantly a misfolded form of a cellular protein prion

38:55.960 --> 39:01.080
So this is a cellular protein whoops, sorry my arrows here now my cellular protein

39:01.880 --> 39:03.880
Which is present in all cells

39:04.600 --> 39:06.600
in

39:06.600 --> 39:10.040
In normal circumstances the prion with a little

39:11.000 --> 39:16.840
See above it or a little sc above it depending on what paper you're reading and whether it's you know

39:17.000 --> 39:23.160
This that or the other thing is the cellular prion protein now in its base state

39:23.800 --> 39:26.520
Um, these prions are all in their little

39:27.080 --> 39:30.440
They're all in a little fibrel and so they're stuck together

39:30.920 --> 39:39.320
And the idea is is that if they touch that or bind to a protein the pre-ion protein in its native form

39:39.800 --> 39:42.680
They can cause that native protein to adopt

39:43.400 --> 39:44.360
their

39:44.360 --> 39:46.040
prion shape

39:46.040 --> 39:47.720
And then those

39:47.720 --> 39:51.800
Fibrels grow until they fragment and then when they fragment they spread around

39:52.200 --> 39:57.080
And so it's this sort of cascade of starting at one and getting to many

39:57.560 --> 39:59.560
um, that is supposedly the

40:00.680 --> 40:03.800
The way that this works and there is a degradation pathway

40:04.360 --> 40:10.040
And essentially maybe in normal function the degradation pathway is sufficient to keep this from

40:11.000 --> 40:15.960
Cascading out of control and then in in in dysfunction. It's not

40:16.520 --> 40:18.520
There are also strains

40:18.680 --> 40:23.480
Of prions and I don't really understand all of that and strain evolution because of course

40:23.880 --> 40:25.880
There's supposed to be some relationship

40:26.520 --> 40:30.520
Between the sequence of a protein and its three-dimensional structure

40:30.920 --> 40:36.440
And so if a prion protein is something that can have a very special three-dimensional structure

40:36.920 --> 40:44.280
Which is highly resistant to enzymatic degradation highly resistant to UV light highly resistant to heat and denaturization

40:44.680 --> 40:47.720
Then it should be pretty closely related to the amino acid

40:48.520 --> 40:50.520
That are in that sequence and so

40:51.160 --> 41:00.120
I don't understand how strains have evolved that much if there's a very special combination of amino acids that can result in a protein with all kinds of

41:00.600 --> 41:03.960
Of attributes that aren't typical for biological proteins

41:04.520 --> 41:09.960
That include the ability to induce other proteins with a similar apparently or even

41:10.600 --> 41:12.840
dissimilar sequence to fold like them

41:13.320 --> 41:16.120
So there are a lot of things about this methodology

41:16.600 --> 41:23.800
That are at least on the surface quite difficult for me to reconcile with what I thought I understood about general biology a kind of

41:24.440 --> 41:30.040
Sort of a little bit parallel to how digging into RNA viruses really threw me for a loop

41:32.760 --> 41:37.160
Of course, no doubt just like the the award for

41:38.120 --> 41:39.640
the

41:39.640 --> 41:47.400
Reverse transcriptase Nobel Prize the Nobel Prize in 1997 was given to Stanley Prusner for his discovery of prions

41:47.400 --> 41:49.880
A new biological principle of infection

41:50.360 --> 41:56.200
A lot of people at the time actually questioned whether it was given a little bit early before we actually understood what was going on

41:56.520 --> 41:58.520
And I think that was probably right

41:59.800 --> 42:03.560
I did promise that we were going to review some reviews and we will

42:03.880 --> 42:09.560
And I did say that we were going to review this particular paper today in particular, but what I found

42:10.680 --> 42:13.640
Was that I have a number of papers, which I simply can't get a hold of

42:14.120 --> 42:17.880
Now I know I can get a hold of them with a little bit more work and a few emails

42:18.360 --> 42:21.080
but in the meantime I did post them on

42:22.840 --> 42:27.080
GigaOM.Bio our soapbox and if you have access to these papers

42:27.640 --> 42:31.400
Through some kind of you know better connection than I do through the university of Pittsburgh

42:31.480 --> 42:35.400
Which is probably not going to last for much longer. I still have kind of this

42:36.680 --> 42:38.280
Sneaky background

42:38.280 --> 42:41.160
Sneaky thing that that that was uh, yeah, anyway

42:41.640 --> 42:44.360
I don't know how long that'll last but it doesn't work for these anyway

42:44.360 --> 42:46.600
So if you could help with those links, that would be really great

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
And in the meantime, we are going to watch this video with uh, Stephanie Sineff, which was recorded on march 17th

42:54.040 --> 42:56.040
2023 as part of a

42:56.440 --> 42:57.400
um

42:57.400 --> 43:04.680
Has part of a st. Patrick's day data presentation and roundtable that was organized by none other than john bodewin

43:05.160 --> 43:07.160
Who now has a cdc

43:07.160 --> 43:12.600
Um, a book titled something like cdc. You should look up john bodewin. You've know that you know who he is

43:13.240 --> 43:19.400
Um, he's been promoted by steve curse a lot his book documents the massachusetts murders that were created

43:19.880 --> 43:23.960
Um murders that were committed in order to create the illusion of a pandemic

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
Um, and I think john's a really good guy

43:27.240 --> 43:30.200
And so I I do think that we should support his work and his book

43:30.680 --> 43:37.240
And spread the word that the the truth that john's telling which is that there is no evidence of a spreading dangerous pathogen

43:37.800 --> 43:38.760
Um

43:38.760 --> 43:45.080
Anyway at this science and data roundtable. Um, Stephanie sineff presented a title talk titled

43:45.720 --> 43:52.040
um, something to do with exosomes and uh, neurogenetic generative diseases

43:52.840 --> 43:56.680
And something you're going to see it in a minute. Um, and so hopefully

43:57.000 --> 44:02.360
Um, this will fit right in remember that we just had a couple lectures from that mit lady

44:02.520 --> 44:05.880
Um, and so we got a couple different angles

44:06.760 --> 44:08.760
from a couple different people

44:08.760 --> 44:13.400
On how protein misfolding works and how we work to try and characterize it

44:13.800 --> 44:19.080
And as far as we understand it, it's kind of started out with heat shock proteins and this response to

44:19.640 --> 44:20.840
stress

44:20.840 --> 44:22.680
and the the

44:22.680 --> 44:29.240
Production of proteins which are tied to these heat shock genes which are according to the mit lady not just

44:30.040 --> 44:33.240
Responses to heat shock but responses to almost any stress

44:34.120 --> 44:37.400
Cellular stress. So here we go. I will make this

44:38.040 --> 44:40.440
Live I'm gonna get my head all the way for a minute

44:42.040 --> 44:44.040
You want me to go on to somebody else?

44:44.040 --> 44:48.040
I can do it. I can do it now if you like. I'll start my video and say hi

44:49.880 --> 44:52.760
All right, so I just go ahead with my my presentation

44:53.160 --> 44:56.920
Yeah, let me um, I think I have to figure out how to let you screen share multiple

44:57.720 --> 44:59.720
Yeah, host disabled

45:00.520 --> 45:03.480
That should work now. Um, yes, it does. Thanks

45:06.280 --> 45:08.280
Big fan of Stephanie sineff. Oh boy

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
You might want to turn off now

45:13.400 --> 45:15.400
You might want to turn off now

45:15.400 --> 45:17.400
No

45:17.400 --> 45:23.880
Okay, there we go. All right. Here's the title of the messenger RNA vaccines exosomes protein misfolding and no degenerative disease

45:23.880 --> 45:27.400
So I've been studying this this mRNA technology ever since it's

45:28.360 --> 45:32.520
Warp speed came up. I started studying it. It is fascinating warp speed

45:32.600 --> 45:39.160
Don't forget warp speed might have the reason why this train went off the rails to begin with they might according to

45:39.960 --> 45:45.960
Um, the gut feeling of my friend marqulak. They may have wanted to stretch out the bridge

45:46.840 --> 45:50.200
Has was described by debra burks on march 3rd 2020

45:50.200 --> 45:53.640
They might have wanted to stretch that bridge out a year or two longer

45:54.200 --> 46:00.760
And trud the trump administration may have thrown a wrench in that plan vice trying to get the vaccine to come out before the election

46:01.320 --> 46:04.200
um, and that could have caused all kinds of problems or

46:05.160 --> 46:10.120
Changes in the narrative that resulted in in where we are today

46:10.120 --> 46:17.080
And I I do think that it is very likely that we've been off script for much longer than they would like us to believe

46:18.040 --> 46:22.040
Anyway getting into this terrifying and i'm just going to focus on this one topic

46:22.040 --> 46:27.320
Although I have many other topics that i'm interested in within this space. I just want to kind of paint the picture of what I see

46:28.360 --> 46:33.960
That scares me the most and and I so I want to start with sort of arguing why the message RNA vaccines are more likely

46:34.440 --> 46:36.840
To cause damage to the organs than an infection

46:37.400 --> 46:42.040
And the way I see it is that when you uh when you catch the virus it goes into the nose goes into the lungs

46:42.600 --> 46:48.360
It's behind the mucosal barrier. So if you've got a strong immune system that stays there never gets past the mucosal barriers

46:48.920 --> 46:53.480
If it does get past mucosal barriers it still has to get past the vascular barrier as well in order to actually

46:53.960 --> 47:00.920
Get into the organs where it can do damage. So there's a couple barriers between the virus and uh severe disease

47:01.480 --> 47:07.000
Whereas the vaccine is injected into the deltoid muscle in the arm past both mucosal and the vascular barriers

47:07.640 --> 47:12.280
Um, and of course the RNA is constructed very specially designed. So she said that very nice, huh?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.320
It's got those cationic lipids that you're really toxic

47:15.960 --> 47:18.360
She said that very nice. I'm going to go back a little bit

47:18.360 --> 47:23.640
So she said that they that that they are injected past the vascular barrier past the

47:24.360 --> 47:26.360
the um

47:26.360 --> 47:28.360
mucosal barrier so she is already

47:28.920 --> 47:30.440
in a way

47:30.440 --> 47:33.720
Stating that the immune system has an orientation

47:34.840 --> 47:37.560
It has a it has an orientation bias

47:37.640 --> 47:41.880
Which should be addressed when trying to address interacting with it and yet

47:42.440 --> 47:49.080
Hintramuscular injection of an RNA is like wrong on several levels. I like that. That's great. Um, that was really nice

47:49.400 --> 47:51.400
Composal and the vascular barriers

47:51.560 --> 47:56.200
Um, and of course the RNA is constructed very specially designed with the mouthful scuba uradines

47:56.760 --> 47:59.240
It's got those cationic lipids that you're really toxic

48:00.120 --> 48:02.280
the the arm RNA resists breakdown

48:03.160 --> 48:07.560
And it produces spike protein for a long time and we're seeing that experimentally for months

48:07.880 --> 48:12.440
It's still producing spike protein. So RNA usually is recycled within a few hours

48:12.440 --> 48:15.320
So that's very very different from the little RNA and of course

48:15.320 --> 48:18.040
It's also been humanized which which makes itself

48:18.520 --> 48:23.640
That the the cell doesn't realize it's being infected with a something that can produce a viral

48:24.440 --> 48:26.440
See so that's technically wrong

48:27.080 --> 48:32.920
the the humanized part of it is the codon optimization and if you listen to

48:33.640 --> 48:35.160
Kevin mccernan

48:35.160 --> 48:42.680
Um, he would explain as far as I understand that the codon optimization is largely to get more protein to come out

48:43.320 --> 48:44.680
um

48:44.680 --> 48:48.120
It may disguise it a little more as a human RNA

48:48.920 --> 48:53.560
But um, what it basically does is optimize protein production. She could be right

48:53.560 --> 48:58.520
I shouldn't jump too hard on that, but one of the reasons why um

48:59.640 --> 49:06.600
The codon optimization was done was because it produced more protein. I don't think it the codon optimization actually reduced

49:07.240 --> 49:10.200
the immunogenicity that much

49:13.640 --> 49:17.480
But I guess that's kind of nitpicking her I shouldn't have jumped in quite so hard like that

49:17.560 --> 49:18.760
Protein

49:18.760 --> 49:25.320
And so they've also been humanized which which makes it stealth that the the cell doesn't realize it's being infected with a

49:25.720 --> 49:30.520
Something that can produce a viral, uh, protein. Yeah, so that's I guess what I have a problem with it

49:30.520 --> 49:34.600
It doesn't realize the cell doesn't realize it's too much anthropomorphism for me

49:35.000 --> 49:39.960
We shouldn't be talking about the cells as having intelligence or thinking for themselves or anything like that

49:40.520 --> 49:42.040
the cells are

49:42.040 --> 49:43.080
sort of

49:43.080 --> 49:45.400
hard to understand as machines, but

49:46.040 --> 49:54.520
It may be better to understand a lot of what happens at the molecular level has closer to something like machinery something like

49:57.480 --> 49:59.480
Something like clockwork

49:59.560 --> 50:01.560
um

50:01.880 --> 50:07.960
So I find I just it's an opportunity to say hey they change the amino acid sequence to make it

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah, I don't know. It's okay

50:13.000 --> 50:18.280
And so the muscle cells take up the nanoparticles and then they I think what happens is they synthesize large amounts of spikes

50:18.280 --> 50:19.480
They have to get rid of it

50:19.480 --> 50:23.400
They ship it ship it out in the form of exosomes and those exosomes can carry

50:24.040 --> 50:27.640
Lots of other stuff besides the spike they're going to display the spike protein on their surface

50:28.200 --> 50:32.760
And they're going to have uh even potentially have the entire messenger RNA molecule in there as well

50:33.400 --> 50:36.760
And um as well as micro RNAs and other proteins all kinds of

50:37.240 --> 50:38.520
synthetic

50:38.520 --> 50:44.680
All kinds of activities can be conveyed through those exosomes exosomes are communication network for all the cells in the body

50:45.160 --> 50:49.960
And they will communicate the danger that they see and deliver the danger to recipient cells

50:50.360 --> 50:52.360
Where it will then cause a lot of trouble

50:52.520 --> 50:57.560
So it causes information wherever it goes you can have a spike protein displayed on the surface of an exosome

50:57.560 --> 51:00.200
You can have the fear and cleaver side snip off s1

51:00.200 --> 51:05.160
S1 can wander through the blood and bind to ace two receptors and a big mess that happens following all of that

51:05.720 --> 51:10.760
So I think um and then of course the other issue is the protein itself is um is a

51:11.480 --> 51:13.960
Neurotoxin that's been shown experimentally as well

51:14.600 --> 51:19.800
And it um it is amyloidogenic and i'll get into that in a moment. So it's a neurotoxin

51:22.680 --> 51:26.200
I guess that just means it kills neurons and it's amyloidogenic

51:26.200 --> 51:40.520
Now amyloidogenic is not a it's not that uh straightforward of a term

51:41.480 --> 51:43.560
um

51:43.560 --> 51:45.560
Because amyloid

51:48.200 --> 51:53.800
The way that amyloid works in the way that that prions work is not necessarily the same thing

51:53.800 --> 51:57.480
I don't think there's anybody in the amyloid field that's claiming that

51:58.280 --> 52:02.040
Amyloid can cause other amyloid to fold like amyloid

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
um

52:05.000 --> 52:10.600
And i'm happy to be corrected about that, but i've been trying to follow up on it. It's one of the reasons why i'm not

52:11.400 --> 52:15.480
Barreling into this right now because I think it's important for me first to characterize

52:16.120 --> 52:20.280
What other people have said about it the people that I think a lot of people are looking up to for

52:20.920 --> 52:27.480
Opinions about these things before I look into this biology and then present what I found because so far what I find

52:28.040 --> 52:30.440
A lot of the more straight up prion people

52:31.160 --> 52:36.200
The way that that the prion biology is explained for example in that nature

52:37.000 --> 52:43.160
Article is very different than the prion biology that these people that are talking about the spike protein and try to

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
bridge that

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
idea to

52:48.040 --> 52:51.560
The current situation tend not to refer to

52:52.360 --> 52:56.520
the kinds of processes or the kinds of mechanisms or the kinds of pre

52:59.960 --> 53:01.960
Predescribed

53:01.960 --> 53:07.080
Instances where we kind of understand one aspect or another aspect of it for example

53:07.560 --> 53:12.680
Remember that the lady from mit what total of three lectures that we've watched so far

53:13.320 --> 53:20.280
Always working in the context of understanding these as chaperone proteins that have their their

53:21.800 --> 53:24.760
Equivalence in in yeast that you can study

53:27.640 --> 53:32.200
And that is very foundational work that's also referenced at some point

53:32.680 --> 53:39.000
So so we're gonna see we're gonna see but again now it's not clear what we're talking about here with exosomes and the fact

53:39.400 --> 53:45.160
That she says that exosomes can have other stuff in them and I don't agree or disagree with that. Of course, that's true

53:46.440 --> 53:52.040
But it feels like a lot of hand waving here when she says that there's a big communication system here

53:52.040 --> 53:54.040
But then she describes it as pretty

53:56.600 --> 53:59.400
Pretty a specific and pretty non non

54:00.440 --> 54:01.800
Precise

54:01.800 --> 54:07.320
Because and that could be the case right but then I think she should be more clear in saying that the reason why

54:07.800 --> 54:10.600
It's not so precise in this instance is because

54:11.160 --> 54:12.120
When

54:12.120 --> 54:17.000
Transfection and she hasn't used that word yet even though she works at mit and she definitely knows the word

54:17.480 --> 54:21.240
Because i've talked to her in steve kush's steering committee before this

54:22.440 --> 54:27.160
She's seen my presentations before this, but she doesn't use the word transfection

54:28.680 --> 54:31.240
And I think that's a mistake, but it's not

54:31.640 --> 54:37.720
It's one of these things where you if you toe the line on this aspect of

54:38.280 --> 54:41.480
The narrative you'll be fine in this case. Maybe it's just mr.

54:41.480 --> 54:46.920
And a vaccines it's one of the only lines that the wine steams keep tolerating that keep towing

54:48.120 --> 54:51.960
That a lot of these people keep towing is that one keep calling them vaccines

54:52.520 --> 54:59.400
Don't question the existence of the virus and get everybody focused on the double-stranded DNA and we won't we won't

54:59.960 --> 55:01.960
Interrupt your sub stack

55:03.640 --> 55:07.960
And so molecular mimicry in the spike was first first put forward by

55:09.160 --> 55:17.480
A woman by the name of delores k-hill whose for all practical purposes been canceled like 50 times and no one ever listens to her and calls her a kook

55:18.520 --> 55:20.520
So it's funny

55:21.480 --> 55:27.960
Yeah, anyway, this is spike protein stuff here, right? This is spike protein and it does say the muscle cells are taking this stuff up

55:28.040 --> 55:29.400
It doesn't say

55:29.400 --> 55:30.760
Anything about

55:30.760 --> 55:33.480
Transfecting other cells in the body here

55:33.480 --> 55:39.000
I hope she would say something like that because of course and biorim bridal didn't burn his whole career for nothing

55:39.400 --> 55:43.720
We know these go all over the place. So it's a weird thing to start out with that

55:53.720 --> 55:55.720
Come on now

55:56.200 --> 55:59.320
Computer and so I think much of the pathology is related to

55:59.960 --> 56:04.040
Antibodies to the spike associated with molecular mimicry and i'm going to get into that in a moment

56:04.520 --> 56:09.960
So here's a paper about exosomes as mediators of chemical induced toxicity and just showing this has nothing to do with spike

56:10.440 --> 56:13.320
But just showing all these different, you know toxic exposures

56:13.880 --> 56:19.800
It has nothing to do with spikes showing all these toxic exposures. So in this case exosomes are

56:22.040 --> 56:23.560
Mediators of

56:23.880 --> 56:26.520
They're just like a waste material, right? This is not

56:27.320 --> 56:33.160
Quite the same thing as a communication network where healthy tissue is communicating with healthy tissue

56:33.880 --> 56:37.720
So I I I still don't think that I know of all the places to choose

56:38.200 --> 56:43.000
a a paper from why why current environmental health reports, I mean

56:43.800 --> 56:50.120
There's not something better. I mean, I don't know. I'm maybe that's where exosome stuff goes. That's also possible

56:50.200 --> 56:53.400
I'm not I should not try to be I should try to be more positive

56:54.360 --> 56:56.040
Heavy metals pesticides

56:56.040 --> 56:59.720
Talk to chemicals of course toxic chemicals as I guess what you would call the vaccine

57:00.280 --> 57:07.960
It gets taken up by the cell and released in the form of the thing the thing the solar fire is asking in the in the chat is what what really gets me

57:08.760 --> 57:13.960
Could the spike protein act as a catalyst in the misfolding cascade? Here's the problem. Okay

57:14.840 --> 57:19.800
If there is a misfolding cascade there still has to be a certain requisite

57:20.520 --> 57:22.520
It

57:22.520 --> 57:29.400
Pattern or a certain requisite composition of said protein that is going to be induced to misfold

57:30.520 --> 57:31.880
You cannot

57:31.880 --> 57:34.920
If you can't take one of these rubic scuba snake

57:35.480 --> 57:40.200
Toys and make it into a sphere that's perfectly round because

57:40.920 --> 57:44.120
That's not in the nature of the object. You can't take

57:44.920 --> 57:51.000
This rubic scuba here and make it into a ball because that's not the nature of the object

57:51.000 --> 57:54.040
You can change the colors and do whatever and so

57:57.480 --> 57:59.720
I don't I don't know I I just don't

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't think that if

58:04.200 --> 58:11.240
One of these is misfolded and one of them isn't and then you if it doesn't have the propensity see look

58:14.840 --> 58:16.840
I

58:16.840 --> 58:23.000
This cube has the probe you can make it into this cube. Okay, this cube can become this cube

58:24.680 --> 58:31.640
It contains that cube you could manipulate it into that cube. That's totally fine, but if I said for example

58:34.920 --> 58:36.920
Change the rubic's cube into this

58:38.600 --> 58:41.960
Well, you can't do that because the parts of this cube are missing

58:42.840 --> 58:49.640
And now I know this is a very extreme example, but you can't even make that cube into this cube

58:50.280 --> 58:52.280
Because the parts are different and bigger

58:52.920 --> 58:54.600
right

58:54.600 --> 59:03.560
So how would a protein that is 27 kilodaltons long and composed of let's say glycine proline repeats

59:05.080 --> 59:11.800
Going to be able to make a protein that doesn't contain any glycine proline repeats fold in the same way that

59:11.800 --> 59:13.800
it folds

59:16.440 --> 59:18.440
How are you going to make a

59:20.920 --> 59:26.360
A semi tractor trailer fold into a camping tent

59:27.880 --> 59:35.160
Um, you just can't do it right, but you could imagine that happening with a canvas camper

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
I

59:37.720 --> 59:39.720
I know these aren't very good

59:40.040 --> 59:42.600
analogies and I know I'm just pulling them out of the air here

59:42.600 --> 59:44.600
But but the question that solar fire

59:45.400 --> 59:52.760
Asks in the chat at 232 his could approach spike protein act as a catalyst for a misfolding cascade

59:53.080 --> 59:58.520
And a catalyst even already implies some kind of interaction where you lower

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.880
The energy required

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.000
To reach in a certain tractor state or reach a certain energy state or to reach a certain configuration

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.360
And by definition

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.880
A protein that can cause other proteins to fold the way it's folded is a catalyst

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:27.240
It is catalyzing that change and and so by definition, this is a very well understood before the pandemic and before prions

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.320
a very well understood thing that that that proteins do

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.680
And I imagine there are examples from molecular biology and biochemistry that I'm not aware of where

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:44.200
You know, you could rattle them right off that this protein catalyzes this protein to become that protein

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.240
probably many many many steps in

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.640
in the

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.440
The construction of proteins involves things like that that we're maybe even unaware of

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120
Maybe some of these

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:06.040
proteins that are called prion proteins are involved in catalyzing the

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160
proper folding of proteins

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.560
And so if they're done wrong then they catalyze the improper folding of proteins

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.200
But then listen to what that means that means that there won't be a buildup of these things

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.960
There would be a buildup of misfolded proteins

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:30.200
But then what happens is that we get more of these proteins so it's not quite the right model yet

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.960
And again, I'm not trying to suggest that I understand it

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.120
I'm trying to show you where I am with wrestling with this so that we can try to understand

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.880
What hypothesis these people are putting forward right now

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.200
The hypothesis that stephanies and f is putting forward again. This is in march of

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.360
2023 we're going back in time a little bit with a flashback friday

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:57.160
Is that when somebody is transfected or given an mRNA vaccine as she calls them

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.640
That the spike protein is produced by the muscles the muscles get rid of it using exosomes

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:10.440
Maybe the s1 protein is cleaved and goes off by itself to interact with ace 2 and cause all kinds of havoc on that line

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.760
And these exosomes containing all kinds of other stuff. I guess including toxins and other crap

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.640
Maybe even the cationic lipids that are used to deliver the mRNA

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.120
Are then sent around as exosomes with the spike proteins on the outside

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.640
Whoops

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.640
Exosomes and they have other stuff in their bioactive count compounds message RNA that could be the message already for the spike protein

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.360
Other proteins are mi RNA. This is mi RNA micro RNA, which are signaling

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.640
My very powerful short RNA sequences that have

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.560
Policy changes in the cell that receives them. Absolutely correct

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.720
That's absolutely correct. These small RNAs are very important for the regulation of all kinds of things in the brain

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.440
In between and into your inside of neurons and in between neurons

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:09.240
And so she's very very right about that but to describe it as kind of she still seems to be describing it as kind of a random thing

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.640
instead of what I

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.720
Tend to believe is a pretty highly precise

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.840
Mechanism of communication and if there's anything to do with the disposal of things

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.320
Then they would only resemble one another in the sense that they may use similar vesicles

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.600
And then they have these things in them in the membrane that can also hook up to receptors and things like that

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:38.120
So they're designed for communication and they're going to communicate this danger signal to the rest of the body in interesting ways to cause

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.600
Damage wherever they go

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.440
And this is a remarkable paper that I found from 2019 before covid

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.520
This was about messenger RNA technology

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.600
And it was a retroproachin that they had coded up in this messenger RNA

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080
And they demonstrated experimentally

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.480
That the lipid nanoparticles were taken up by the cells at the injection site

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.080
Repackaged into endosomal vesicles released into exosomes

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.560
And the cationic lipid was included actually one for one with each of the um

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.480
of the

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.600
Nucleotides in the RNA there was a cationic lipid bound to each one

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.520
So you've got the cationic lipid in there too, which is going to make this exosome positively charged

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.080
That's not good for the blood in terms of the veseta potential the whole other story there

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.320
Okay, so let's just call that zeta potential what it is right now

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600
um

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.440
Let's uh

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440
Say it like this

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:36.440
Um, the blood is a colloidal solution the mRNA injections are a colloidal solution

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.720
basically

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.520
The mRNA our mRNA injections are supposed to be a lipid

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.240
With mRNA inside at a certain size that certain size created by proprietary

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.720
Technology that is most certainly patented many of those patences are held by

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.240
Peter colas up in canada and probably

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:04.120
Owned in a company or two that is partially owned by palantir. Anyway, the point being

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.680
you

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:16.040
What was the point here endosomes exosomes the oh, yeah, sorry zeta potential the

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.000
um

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.600
The colloidal solution that is composed of the aqueous layer though the water part the the aqueous

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.600
proportion of the solution and then these lipids which are in very small droplets

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:36.280
And because they're in very small droplets and they're hydrophobic on the outside and they have these pegs and whatever

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.520
the molecules of water interact with them in a particular way

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.080
and

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:50.200
The description of the pH of that solution and the tendency for the water molecules

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.640
to

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.640
maintain

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.080
The colloidal solution in its current state is called zeta potential

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:04.360
How's that for some some off the cuff explanatory shit? So basically speaking the

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.960
the mRNA in its best form with the lipid will be a certain

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.240
state where the

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.240
peg that's around the

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:23.400
The cationic lipids will sort of stabilize them at a certain in a certain state at a certain concentration at a certain size

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.000
and zeta potential we relatively stable, but if the pH of that solution changes

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.520
is

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.640
Then the zeta potential changes and the potential for those

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.880
Lipid nanoparticles to stay as they are as opposed to change

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.960
and and

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.520
Interact and differently with the water

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.240
Remember water is a highly polar solvent and these lipids are also highly polar

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.280
And so if they're organized in the right way, then these kind of forces are balanced

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.800
And if they interact with them in the wrong way, then you will get a

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:02.520
agglomeration as the Italian guy explained to us you get these larger much more toxic

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.760
Aggregations of the cationic lipid

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.600
Hmm very interesting stuff here very interesting stuff

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.800
They can be taken up by the cells and then those cells can translate they are an anti-protein

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.920
So that's really really dangerous in the picture here of the administrator

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.080
That's absolutely true melon said it a lot of people said it even peter colosus said

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:33.480
And one of the things is to keep these lipid nanoparticles the actual particles that are in the colloidal solution as tiny as possible

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.680
Because this makes them less toxic and

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.040
Less toxic in the sense of acute toxicity if you don't do that

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:48.520
Then you will be it will be much more toxic because of the nature of these things. It's it's there

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.320
the

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:57.000
The toxicity comes from their incredible cationic nature their incredible polarity

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:01.000
And what they can potentially do to bioactive molecules and create

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.560
Reactive oxygen species locally and even damage mitochondria

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.040
Oops, I didn't mean to fast forward her is a to potential the whole other story there

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.920
They can be taken up by the cells and then those cells can translate they are an anti-protein

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.320
So that's really really dangerous in the picture picture here of the administration the source cell

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.520
The extracellular vesicles taking up making making the protein all of it's there

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.520
And then here's another paper exosomes an extracellular RNA in muscle and bone aging and crosstalk

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.600
And this is again talking about the muscle cells when they're exposed to some kind of stressors

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.920
They release exosomes they package up things inside the exosomes that are communication

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.400
information to the to the cells that receive them and

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:50.040
Evidence is accumulating that the cargo of muscle-derived exosomes can be changed under pathological conditions

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.040
So that you could have different microRNAs and that's been shown actually experimentally with the

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.200
With the with the spike protein with the mRNA for the vaccine

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.400
That microRNAs are packaged up inside exosomes that induce inflammation in the brain

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.920
And so they contribute to the propagation of pathogenic responses to distant cells

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.800
And that's where I think it's going from the muscle to the brain

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.400
And I actually think it could be that the exosomes are traveling along axons

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.800
Of nerves that have their soma in the in the spinal cord

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:26.840
The nerves that are the motor neurons that control muscle movement and also the sensory neurons that are picking up the muscle pain

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.040
They both have axons that extend to the muscle and the exosomes travel along their fibers

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.760
So they can go to the brain stem. They can go from there up to the brain

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.400
the the core

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.520
nuclei

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.600
And so what I and then they can cause a big mess

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.080
So what I have a problem. So this is a paper amyloid or genesis genesis of the reason why I have a problem with this

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.680
What she's saying here is that this seems to absolve

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.560
the lipid nanoparticle from

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.040
Transfecting any place in the body

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.200
It seems to suggest that it essentially works

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080
And that the cells release these

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:11.240
extracellular vesicles or these exosomes and that's what causes the damage it causes the blood brain barrier and it's the spike protein that does it

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.200
That's that's exactly what she's saying here. She's not saying the

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.000
Transfection of whole variant tissue will cause other things to happen

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.680
She's not saying the transfection of bone marrow could be could be particularly interesting

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.520
She's not saying that the transfection agent itself the lipid nanoparticle could end up in the brain

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.400
right

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.840
Right she you hear that right

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.720
She's saying that it'll end up in the brain. Why? Because the exosomes that are given off by muscle cells will take it there

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320
That's a very different way

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.160
For the lipid nanoparticle to get into your brain than direct

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.920
movement

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.520
after injection

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.920
And any of it that got to the blood could move by direct movement to the brain

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:09.480
In a lipid nanoparticle by all we understand right now. So it's very very dubious to me that this is a pretty certain

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.560
description

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.360
That again includes apoptotic bodies and it looks like getting rid of trash

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.720
And we're not using the word transfection

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.760
We're not saying that we already know the transfection does this because we've been transfecting mice for years

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160
We're not saying it at all

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120
Okay, the the core

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.200
Nuclei in the brainstem and then they can cause a big mess

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.560
So this is a paper amyloidogenesis of genesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein many papers have talked about the potential

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.640
For the protein to cause other proteins to misfold like the pre-on protein does it has pre-unlike

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.740
Behaviors and it has pre-unlike sequences in this in the protein

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.580
Theoretically that's been shown they have you know statistical models

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.820
And then experimentally as well that it causes protein misfolding

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.540
And then the perspective of S protein amyloidogenesis in COVID-19 disease

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:16.140
Associated pathogenesis can be important in understanding disease and long COVID and long COVID of course is many ways resembles vaccine injury

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.140
I think they're kind of the same thing

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:25.260
Um, so this is I was really excited that Luke Montaget's paper finally did get officially published peer reviewed

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:29.180
It was a pre-print for a long time. Uh, he unfortunately passed away

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:33.420
So, but his co-authors managed to usher the paper through a review process

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.180
and um

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.140
And this was a article by marina john in the um

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:45.020
In the epic news epic times. Sorry studies link in terrible pre-on disease with COVID-19 vaccine

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.300
So I think it's much more than pre-on disease. I think ALS like syndromes

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:53.820
Of course the the heart damage I think is connected as well to this issue with the pre-on protein

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.220
I suspect and also neuropathy poly neuropathy and even alopecia

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:03.420
So I've been finding all these papers that show a very interesting thing that I will get into in a moment

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.300
But first I want to talk about luke montaget in this paper

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:12.060
There were 26 people all together 23 of them were the messenger a the other three had the j&j vaccine

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:18.060
And all the messenger a people had had actually since within two weeks of their second m rna vaccine

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:21.660
And this is a month, but these these took a little longer the jng's

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.380
Many of them were dead within three months a very aggressive form of chrystal jocka disease

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.580
Which is the human mag equivalent of mag cow disease caused by misfolding of the pre-on protein

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:38.940
And um, so it's a very aggressive form of cjd that these people suffer from normally it would take longer like maybe five years

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.420
But this was very fast at the moment at last I heard only one of them was still alive

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:49.580
Uh, so this is where it gets really interesting in my opinion. I picked up. I happened to notice this sequence

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.260
YQ AGS

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:55.180
Which is in the um, the receptor binding domain. This is the receptor binding domain

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.500
Of these spike protein this sequence and there are these antibodies

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:04.220
This paper is studying the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.620
um

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:11.820
Associated with the right receptor binding domain. So they found these uh, you know, there's this one this one this one

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.380
This one this four antibodies here two of them

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:19.100
Uh, this one goes from four five four seven eight this one goes from four three nine four seven eight

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.540
This they're both going to pick up this piece at the end YQ AGS

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:30.220
And then in this study they showed that uh, so there's the YQ AGS these two as well as I think this one

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.700
All had a very good antibody response to the vaccine

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.500
Uh, so the people who got the vaccine had a much stronger expression of these antibodies

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:46.300
Than people who didn't very significant and also that they worked well to protect you from uh, the disease

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.180
So

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:55.740
There's no doubt that there's a virus. There's no doubt that antibodies protect these antibodies in particular protect really well

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.300
That's what she says

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.620
You just got to hear it. You just got to accept it

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
And there's no

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:15.820
Sequence homology necessary of the what? I mean, what are we talking about here?

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:21.980
This is amino acids if they're using all these letters. So it's one two three four five amino acids

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.220
And then she's going to say down here at the bottom that actually one of them isn't the same

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.980
And so

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.020
If it was the same she's going to make the argument in a second

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:41.900
Then it would have been recognized as self, but since it's not the same

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:45.260
We made antibodies to it in this antibody

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.980
I don't have to talk to joe lee about this. This antibody is going to start

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:58.060
I don't know. I guess reducing the amount of prion protein that's available in the normal state because that's what antibodies do they bind to stuff

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:06.220
I don't know how the antibodies is going to get into the nucleus and bind prion protein or get into the setoplasm and bind

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.300
Prion protein from b cells like what?

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:15.500
B cells are going to shoot antibodies out into the blood knows antibodies are going to bind prion protein in the side of our own cells

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:22.300
And cause a down regulation of prion protein. How the hell is that going to work? You don't think that sounds plausible

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.460
Let's listen to her explain it. Now

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.100
This is very important because I think these antibodies are trouble

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:33.820
And the problem is that there's a sequence yq rg as that's found in the c-terminal domain of the human prion protein

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:39.660
And I think what's happening is that antibodies are binding to the c-terminal domain of the human prion protein

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.620
And what that causes is for the protein to disappear

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:49.900
It gets broken up and removed by the digestive system of the cell it disappears and the cell becomes prion protein deficient

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.460
Not the same thing as misfolding very very interesting and it turns out to be several papers

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.420
About this c-terminal domain and the roles that it plays it plays an important role in muscles in the heart

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.500
Of course in the brain. It's a protein mark and they don't know what it does

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.780
And it's called the prion protein and the reason why it's the prion protein is because they did some kind of

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.700
RNA

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.460
Screen back in the 80s and I posted these papers on

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.820
On my soapbox because I can't get them off of pud med or any of these other databases

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:22.300
And I need them if i'm going to understand what the hell they did

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.540
But they say they were able to identify a protein that they purified from screpy

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:34.700
And then they were somehow able to sequence the protein which is already a pretty trick pretty neat trick

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.860
Sequence that protein and then using dna clones

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.620
That's true dna clones. They used them dna clones

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.300
Of that protein they were able to screen

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:53.100
The golden hamster and i'm not shitting you they screened the golden hamster in the mouse and they found

01:17:53.740 --> 01:18:00.780
A chromosomal sequence that was equivalent to it and they called that the native prion protein

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.020
And they said that the native prion protein folds differently

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:10.940
And then that native protein folded differently is prion with the c

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.700
Raised up, but they don't know what that protein does

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:21.740
Only the lady from mit knows what that protein does and she says that that protein is probably some kind of

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:23.500
Uh

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:29.260
Chaperone protein, but it's it's they're not the same because the heat shock proteins are not the prion protein

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.260
So that's important to understand

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:37.420
Um, you're good to ask the question. I'm still learning it. So I can't give you the best answer yet, but here we go

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.100
Okay, the neurons and in the um in the uh

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.220
neuron neural fibers the um

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:50.300
Uh the uh axons and the dendrites and all of that it plays a role in the uh nerve fibers as well

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.420
So here's a paper and there are others as well, but antibodies to c-terminal domain are neurotoxic

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.100
That's what this paper showed

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:01.580
This was in 2015 so long before covid and they they've been playing around with it

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.820
And they found that if they uh treated the cerebellar spices

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:08.620
with antibodies to this um

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:10.620
to this uh

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:15.100
Global globular domain is the globular domain is the same is the c-terminal domain

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:20.140
Um and the antibodies exposing that two antibodies was neurotoxic

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.980
And in juiced toxicity within days rather than months, which was more typical for things that caused the protein this folding

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:33.420
And they said uh it says global domain ligands. Okay, so what is the globular domain of the

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:42.060
So it could be that the globular domain of a spike of a protein is very similar across many proteins

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.820
And biochemistry globular proteins or sphero proteins are spherical

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:52.300
Proteins and are one of the common protein types be others being fibrous disordered and membrane proteins

01:19:52.940 --> 01:20:00.380
Globular proteins are somewhat water soluble unlike fibrous or membrane proteins. So a globular domain

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:08.620
Of the prion protein is very likely very likely homologous with a lot of other globular domains

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:14.140
And so if you make antibodies to the globular domain of they what they call the prion protein

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.060
It's very likely

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:21.340
that it is uh shares homology and specificity with other globular domains

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:26.460
And so it's probably interfering with more than just the prion protein in those neurons

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.740
That's my first interpretation without having looked at that paper

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:33.100
um the most glaringly the kinetics of

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:39.180
globular domain ligand induced so globular domain ligands implies

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.700
That that they're making antibodies which bind

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:48.780
Usefully to the globular domain if these globular domains are semi water soluble

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:54.540
They may be functional domains where other things bind like a receptor or an agonist

01:20:54.620 --> 01:21:01.020
And so in a lot of ways what they're describing is using an antibody to activate something which is very very different

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.500
um

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.940
Oh, it's it's very disturbing how this stuff has been has been

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.660
Wow, it's it's super annoying

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.140
much faster than experimental prion infections see

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.020
um

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:24.300
They're using antibodies to do something that they say prions can also do it sounds like a very terrible paper

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.380
I'm going to have to investigate that

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:35.740
Both glaringly the kinetics of gdl induced neurodegeneration is much faster than that of experimental prion infections

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.500
And the condition resembles cjd but with much faster progression

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:44.780
And that's exactly what I feel these people have so i'm suspecting this maybe the next reason by which they're being

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.340
uh harmed by the vaccine

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:50.540
So it is again listen, she's going to summarize it here

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.740
But it sounds like to me that she's saying that the vaccine

01:21:54.300 --> 01:22:02.380
Unfortunately induces antibodies to the the natural prion protein and in worst case scenario can cause

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:09.100
uh a super fast crowdspelled yacob like variant of the disease because of this

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.900
I don't really get it yet, but let's listen to her. This is the summary. It's going to be really nice

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:19.580
And so in summary, um the messenger RNA vaccines are a bioweapon for distributing spike proteins throughout the body

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.620
Much like likely much of it packaged up within exosomes

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.380
And so the exosomes are also have the messenger RNA. They're actually about the same size

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.860
As the nanoparticles in the vaccine

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:33.500
But they are but they're going to have all kinds of other stuff in there the micro-ardinase that are going to influence policy

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.380
And of course the spike protein itself displayed on the surface

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:42.540
It's going to uh be a much more efficient mechanism for distributing and as they travel very efficiently along the nerve fibers

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:48.220
I think all of that is very very dangerous traveling efficiently along nerve fibers. I don't know why she keeps saying that

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.860
I don't know how what evidence she has of of

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.260
If they put it on culture and it goes into the nerves that that's not evidence

01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.620
I think that's an interesting statement to make. Maybe she's citing something in the old factory literature or something. Here we go

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.140
Cells exposed to this

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.140
Transfection released the exosomes

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:08.860
She said transfection good for you step containing the messenger RNA along with the cationic libid

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.940
That's another issue because that's going to be in there

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.860
And the recipient cells can produce protein from the messenger RNA in the exosomes

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:21.100
So she's not explicitly saying that this can go anywhere including crossing the blood brain barrier. I think that's a huge mistake

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100
It's an omission. It's annoying

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.220
Spag proteins amyloid orgenic and neurotoxic

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:33.180
And that's also a statement that she just simply cannot make because of one paper from sweden where they did something in a dish

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.780
That is really really irresponsible and um, I don't like it at all

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.780
The receptor binding binder domain contains this sequence yqh

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:47.660
Yes, which is similar to but not identical and that's actually important too because if it were identical it wouldn't work

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.020
It has to be different in order for there to be an antibody response

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.740
Otherwise, it'll be appear to be a human sequence

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:59.020
So similar but not identical to the c-terminal which is going to cause this toxic effect

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:05.100
So an aggressive form of cjd found in association with the vaccines may be due to molecular memory between

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:08.700
Despite protein and the prion protein and that's the end of life presentation

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.580
Stephanie, I feel bad like you had a timeline you had to meet you were going so fast

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.820
I

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:25.500
Yeah, I just want to be casual but Jonathan has his hand up, you know, oh do hands. It's up to you guys

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:31.900
Oh, I don't like doing hands. I'm so used to it now. Hey, could you I'm just going to give you a few more minutes by just saying

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:36.220
Um, could you clear it up for the viewers? What is the prion protein doing?

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.340
Um in normal conditions and why would

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.780
Creating a deficiency of it caused problems. Who's this guy?

01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:48.300
Good point and I shouldn't probably said that because it I've read a lot about prion disease and I sort of assume people know this

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.540
But the prion protein is actually very very important protein in its natural function

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:57.020
And it's important in muscles for allowing them to hook up to their extra cellular matrix

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:00.940
It's it can cause deficiency can cause polyneuropathy

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.540
A deficiency can also cause alopecia, which is hair loss

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.260
And of course it can cause cjd an aggressive form of cjd all of this has been seen

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.340
in um in the and of course the the binding of those

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.940
Antibodies any antibody said bind to that c-terminal domain

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:22.140
The experimentally they've shown that that causes it to be removed not to be misfolded, but to be cleared

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.180
So you get a deficiency what they have these mice that are

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.500
And so that's pretty impressive, right?

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:34.140
There was hardly any explanation of the endogenous function of that protein other than to say it helps muscles connect to something

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.140
It helps this connect to something

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:43.900
And yet it can lead to this cascade of events. What does it do in the brain? I mean, I

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:52.860
I have the feeling that we're about to find a very big disconnect between the traditional prion literature and the prion

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:59.500
Story that's told about the spike protein. I have a feeling that that's the case. I know that's where this is going

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
That's why I showed this video

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:05.420
Um, let me see if there's any more to this explanation before we split

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:10.060
Do a lot of engineering of mice and they can knock out their prion protein

01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:12.380
And then they can show that when they do that

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:19.020
These mice suffer from all of these conditions that it turns out are also showing up as a side effects of the vaccine

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.220
So wait mice live

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.620
If you knock out the prion protein, they don't just die of misfolded proteins

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.100
They die of what muscles not working right connecting to connective tissue or

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.100
What did she say? So that's going to be very interesting. I think we have to

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.820
Write that down. We're going to look at the mouse

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.900
prion protein knockouts

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:46.300
Our other papers we're going to have to put on our list of things to discuss

01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:49.180
I mean, you know, this is going to be a lot of work ladies and gentlemen

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:55.660
I've already put a lot of hours into it and haven't shown you anything for it because I do think that it's something that if we're going to become

01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:02.540
Um useful experts on it's something that we're going to have to be well read and and maybe even better read than they are

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.900
Um, and so we're we're we're treading lightly

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.540
Um, but I think it's worthwhile to tread

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:14.700
Lightly and I I do think that in the end you're going to respect me for treading lightly in this case

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:20.700
Um, because it would be very easy to step out of line and then have myself discredited as

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:28.300
As nich Hudson said a couple months ago already on a podcast called

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:31.900
Uh coffee and a mic

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.740
um

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:39.580
At about 58 minutes in he gave a really nice shout out to my work and I really appreciate that nich

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140
um

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:49.180
Maybe maybe i'll just find it here and play it for those of you who are here and still here and have been here for a while

01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:51.420
um

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:55.580
Just so you can hear it because it is actually a very flattering

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300
Shout-out that he gave to us

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.940
Oops, I do not do that correct

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.820
There it is

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.820
No, okay, then we're going to escape out of there and then maybe this will work

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.100
Why is that not working?

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.500
Almost there guys here it comes

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.700
uh a really interesting thinker um there's a

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.220
um

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.220
there's a

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:33.980
you know

01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:41.500
A benefit to staying in contact with people who are who are just they come from a different discipline and a different sort of thinking

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:46.460
So I question motives. Um, I question conflicts of interest

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:53.020
um, but there are people who I I listen to I I've uh, I

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.580
In my organization my organization and our organization pandata

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.380
Dot org the panda as it's affectionately known. Um, there are

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.380
This is a significant number of people who I who's

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.540
I can't even begin to describe how much I've benefited from

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:15.820
Their insights and perspectives so much. I've enjoyed their time and discussion with them

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.780
um, you know, I

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.740
I can list the publicly facing names unfortunately

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:26.380
There's not a lot of people in the organization who are unable to to have a public face

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:33.100
But I speak of people like dr. Jonathan engler in the united kingdom. Uh, dr. pierce robinson in germany

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.020
um

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:38.860
Dr. Dr. Todd kenyan in in the united states in red island

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:44.380
on who are fellow members of of exco and

01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:46.220
who's

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.100
who's

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:51.020
intellectual company i've really enjoyed and from you know just

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.940
very revealing and of of the nature of reality

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.580
um, and then they are people who have inspired a lot of uh, uh,

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:03.180
thought for me people like, um, jj

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.740
You know who's regarded by a few people as by some people as sort of

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.540
this kind of

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.780
Savant or idiot or something that

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:18.460
That is ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learned and in many ways

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.140
You know, they are

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.100
But uh, that's throwing baby out of bath water

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:29.660
I mean the best the best best thinkers in the world all tools tools through and suffer through the consequences of

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:33.900
10 bad ideas for every good one, you know, the best creative thinkers

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.860
Um, and so if you if you're going to jump on every

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:43.820
One of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with that you don't agree with and use that as uh, uh,

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.260
are to

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.860
Smear the person that I think that's just you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.700
You won't you won't find the the muses the the creative inspiration

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.180
So I've certainly think that jj kuby's overall take is very good

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:03.340
Um over the course of a couple of years i've come around to a lot of the thinking of mike eden who are initially

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:04.940
um

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:07.580
regarded as being several shades too dark

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.460
in terms of his his worldview

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.380
um, but i've

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.900
I've uh realized the error of my ways and and where

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.620
Or just the error of some of my

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.380
The error of my thinking when it it came to points of disagreement

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:28.700
Do you understand that nick hudson mentioned me almost in the same sentence and thought

01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:31.660
has mike eden

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:37.340
The only reason why that happens is because of the people that share my work

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:41.660
And because of the people that share this stream and because of the people that subscribe to it

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:45.900
I can't thank greg james and steffin cohen and rodney maulin

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:52.060
And all these people that have given way more money than they ever should have given to somebody on the internet

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.700
For saving my family from what would have been homelessness or worse

01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:02.620
Um, we are struggling, but we are making it and it's because of each and every one of you that cares enough

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:07.740
To take one of these links and share it to take one of these links and email it to somebody

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:12.860
There's people that email for me all the time not because I asked them to but because they do

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.220
Because it's the one thing that they can do. So if you can

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:24.700
Please share this work give a shout out to nick thank him for um for giving a shout out to us

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.460
um

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:33.260
Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you that uh if we turn over our thinking to these machines to our phones

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.660
Um, we will be controlled by the men that control those machines. It's not a trick

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:40.380
AI is not a

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:44.620
An independent thinking thing that we can't control it is simply programming

01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:48.620
And they have they have tricked us into believing that it's more

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:52.700
Complicated than that. They are just lying to us. They are putting in front of us

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.820
What they want us to think and making us think the thoughts that are useless to us

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:02.300
um, ladies and gentlemen, please all stop all transfections and humans because they

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:06.620
Are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:14.620
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:19.580
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:28.620
Um, this has been an independent bright web presentation. You will also know the uh broken science initiative as being a

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:32.620

As people that are members of a new independent bright web

01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.700
