WEBVTT

00:43.331 --> 00:46.153
I soon know where I've been.

00:47.894 --> 00:52.537
Hanging on the promises and the songs of yesterday.

00:53.678 --> 00:57.561
And I've made up my mind.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.263
I ain't wasting no more time.

01:01.343 --> 01:11.350
Though I keep searching for an answer, I never seem to find what I'm looking for.

01:13.772 --> 01:42.470
Good Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on Cos I know what it means To walk along a lonely street of grief And here I go again on my own Going down the only road I'll ever know Like a drifter I was born to walk alone

01:50.276 --> 02:03.060
I ain't wasting no more time Just another heart in need of rescues Waiting on love's sweet charity I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days Cause I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams

02:30.887 --> 02:33.931
Like a sister I was born to walk alone

03:40.265 --> 04:01.315
♪ Like a drifter I was born to walk alone ♪ ♪ Cause I know what it means ♪ ♪ To walk alone and honestly to dream ♪ ♪ And here I go again on my own ♪

04:08.405 --> 04:19.598
We understand less than 1% of the human genome, so trying to be manipulating that and creating a variance of that I think is

04:22.386 --> 04:26.990
To me, it's unethical to do because we're doing it without knowledge.

04:29.792 --> 04:38.980
At some point, it would be really good to get rid of diseases like Tay-Sachs and other horrible debilitating diseases for young children.

04:40.762 --> 04:48.488
But we don't know enough about the human genome that knocking out genes, we don't know what other functions they have.

04:49.269 --> 04:56.472
Things like CRISPR are not the precise tool that they're made out in the press to be.

04:56.492 --> 04:59.313
They have what's called off-target effects.

04:59.553 --> 05:01.554
They make changes in other genes.

05:02.614 --> 05:04.595
We're just so not ready for doing this.

05:07.952 --> 05:10.154
Be very careful there, Daniel.

05:10.194 --> 05:26.026
That was actually Craig Venter, one of the godfathers of the Human Genome Project and of just genetic exploration in general, in a rare moment of high morality and respect for the sacred.

05:26.046 --> 05:29.969
You don't get him to say that very often, but that is a wonderful example of it.

05:30.690 --> 05:36.935
It looks vaguely like G. Edward Griffin, but it wasn't him at all, just to make sure you realize that was Craig Venter.

05:40.726 --> 05:42.367
Sorry, I keep saying that wrong.

05:50.009 --> 05:51.189
I would need to go look it up.

05:52.449 --> 05:53.710
I don't know when he said that.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.890
I would need to go look back to the original file.

05:55.930 --> 05:57.891
But I can do that at some point if that's really important.

05:57.911 --> 05:58.931
It was on YouTube though.

05:59.591 --> 06:02.052
I just pulled that screen capture from YouTube.

06:28.516 --> 06:31.339
I gotta tell you, G. Edward Griffin is sharp as a knife, man.

06:31.379 --> 06:36.424
That guy was funny and witty and sharp.

06:36.644 --> 06:40.027
And I felt very privileged to have met him.

06:40.648 --> 06:47.514
So thanks for that reminder to shout out again to the old school OG, G. Edward Griffin.

07:05.888 --> 07:10.072
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:10.572 --> 07:14.756
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:16.757 --> 07:18.339
I think truth is good for kids.

07:18.779 --> 07:22.623
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.684
We want everybody to feel good.

07:24.704 --> 07:27.066
That's not the way life is.

07:29.609 --> 07:31.130
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.472
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:35.282 --> 07:36.023
And I have lied.

07:36.043 --> 07:37.064
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:37.084 --> 07:38.025
I don't want to lie.

07:38.506 --> 07:39.867
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:39.968 --> 07:40.989
I try not to be a liar.

07:41.029 --> 07:41.870
I don't want to be a liar.

07:42.430 --> 07:45.154
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:48.988 --> 08:07.524
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:07.544 --> 08:17.112
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

08:20.930 --> 08:39.458
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

08:39.758 --> 08:43.860
It's just a big hassle in the end, but no one,

08:44.861 --> 08:58.276
When we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these three.

08:58.376 --> 09:00.638
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

09:35.904 --> 09:36.608
you

10:01.997 --> 10:07.420
Every time I think I have that music ready to go, I've got that stupid slider on my left too low.

10:08.261 --> 10:18.547
Here we are again, trying another day of enchantment, dispelling, disambiguation, a little bit of something and a little bit of something.

10:18.707 --> 10:21.568
Good to see you, everybody in the chat.

10:22.669 --> 10:25.370
Get our telescopes out and enjoy the view.

10:26.496 --> 10:29.179
Got some really goopy stuff going down lately.

10:30.061 --> 10:38.411
And today we have sort of the Fonz on the Fonzarelli is gonna jump a shark today.

10:39.401 --> 10:53.636
And the narrative about the COVID pandemic, two very unlikely characters came into contact in real life, which I wouldn't have predicted was going to happen so early.

10:53.656 --> 11:01.724
And I think that's actually because these guys are so off script that they don't even know what to do anymore.

11:03.595 --> 11:04.376
That's how it feels.

11:05.256 --> 11:11.181
Because they are doing everything they can to swim away from talking about New York City anymore.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.645
The only person that was talking about New York City seems to have vanished from the internet.

11:19.575 --> 11:20.696
Infectious clones?

11:20.756 --> 11:35.121
I mean nobody's talking about that anymore except for some guy named Quay who I guess said the words or said synthetic clone but didn't say infectious clone because of course infectious clone is the term that you need to search

11:35.741 --> 11:38.103
in the virology literature in order to see it.

11:38.123 --> 11:42.145
Because otherwise, if you just search clones, that's not going to get you to the goal.

11:43.446 --> 11:45.628
Placebo batches, still just crickets.

11:46.568 --> 11:54.674
And the word transfection and the word transformation, still just something that nobody seems to realize was on their own resume.

11:55.334 --> 12:05.021
If you're an academic biologist or an academic doctor who has a lab at a university somewhere, you've used this technology before.

12:06.062 --> 12:12.713
And it was just kind of, I don't know, negligent for you not to see that they weren't investigational vaccines.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.960
They just renamed something that you already understood very well.

12:24.369 --> 12:29.251
And so the protocols were murder, it's just a question of how many different ways and how did they get it all started.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.352
Kyle Seidel might be able to tell us something.

12:31.452 --> 12:33.353
Cameron Kyle Seidel.

12:33.993 --> 12:38.295
One of the guys that Kevin McCarron thought was most important in April of 2020.

12:38.835 --> 12:39.856
Is that a coincidence?

12:41.256 --> 12:42.097
I don't think it is.

12:42.117 --> 12:44.098
I don't think it's a coincidence at all.

12:47.682 --> 12:48.843
Scooby-Doo is real.

12:49.363 --> 12:53.165
And there's a spectacular commitment to lies going on, ladies and gentlemen.

12:53.185 --> 13:11.117
That's why people's behavior starts to behave, their behavior starts to not add up, you know, because people that are really, you know, operating from a standpoint of integrity and aren't cooperating with other people to bamboozle us and our children,

13:12.518 --> 13:21.628
They display a pretty normal kind of behavior pattern, you know, where they have other stuff to do and they have other time for other things.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.113
And Substack is a pretty huge commitment.

13:25.693 --> 13:25.913
I mean,

13:29.741 --> 13:41.969
Getting on Substack and writing articles and then checking your grammar and formatting them and putting in little clips and all this other shit that people do seemingly in their sleep is not easy.

13:43.350 --> 13:49.174
Adjusting yesterday's slide deck for today's show takes me 25 minutes to a half an hour.

13:51.221 --> 13:57.167
And deciding what I want to do and taking notes on it for a little while first takes a little time too.

13:57.207 --> 14:06.615
And then I got, you know, three kids and a wife and there are meals and there's a lawn and you got to get stuff from outside of the house every once in a while.

14:06.735 --> 14:15.363
And then there's the, you know, like, it's just so weird how some people can put out 17 pages of Substack every day.

14:16.693 --> 14:28.534
And also, I guess, maintain all kinds of other things in their personal life besides hundreds of tweets a day that are all snarky with the right, just the right this or the just the right that.

14:30.199 --> 14:32.682
What you see on Twitter from me is two cups of coffee.

14:33.082 --> 14:37.367
I just go as quick as I can trying to, you can see there's lots of typos.

14:37.407 --> 14:48.300
I don't use much time there and whatever I find there, I tend to make note of and that's about it because I've come to understand it as kind of an application like Slack.

14:49.728 --> 14:51.329
And I'm not a super user.

14:51.389 --> 14:53.870
I'm not an administrator of my Slack group.

14:53.910 --> 14:54.810
I'm just a user.

14:55.431 --> 15:00.813
And so if nobody invites me into that chat group over there or that channel over there, then I'm not allowed to see it.

15:01.573 --> 15:14.419
But there are administrators of Slack groups that can see all the chats and can see all the messages and know who's watching who and where they're spending their time on the app.

15:15.711 --> 15:18.273
That's how it works if you're an administrator on Slack.

15:18.353 --> 15:20.815
Nevermind, I guess, if you're a super user of it.

15:22.015 --> 15:32.863
And so make no mistake about it, Twitter may have been one of the primary ways that this pandemic and the narrative of it was so efficiently disseminated.

15:33.664 --> 15:40.709
And I've noticed an eerie, eerie, very remarkable pattern in the

15:41.801 --> 15:59.965
early videos that we've been watching of Kevin McKernan, and also now Kevin McCairn, where two different videos, two days apart, preceding that video that we watched of Kevin McKernan on the Vance Crowe podcast on the 24th of April, 2020, that remains on YouTube.

16:01.026 --> 16:09.868
These two videos were both started with a George Webb associate named Addy Adds, Atikin Skywalker, YouTube's chosen one.

16:11.897 --> 16:15.399
enunciating that it seems like this debate's really happening on Twitter, huh?

16:15.479 --> 16:21.042
And then showing each other's Twitter page and what they're doing on Twitter.

16:24.544 --> 16:29.406
And so I think we need to come to the conclusion that that's why Drastic was a group on Twitter.

16:30.246 --> 16:37.010
And that's why all of these people that are in this dissident movement have a very active Twitter account.

16:40.103 --> 16:45.909
And most or all of them are very pro Elon because it's all part of the show.

16:46.049 --> 17:02.226
And I know that, you know, it's easy to say that it was always part of the show, but how it was being used and thinking about it as an app, like a Slack with super users and administrators and also us little, you know, employees down here that only see it as Twitter.

17:05.014 --> 17:15.559
And now imagine if those people are multiple accounts and that some of them have access to the same anonymous accounts so that whenever they get a good idea for one of those accounts, they can just do it.

17:16.479 --> 17:22.622
Maybe there's a whole table of people that's gaming this out so that none of these people waste any time on Twitter.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.523
It just looks like they do because every once in a while they contribute.

17:25.543 --> 17:32.887
And of course it's on their phone so they can keep track of what the table is putting on their account and how they're being used.

17:33.587 --> 17:37.391
to meddle with these real people that we're trying to get us out of this maze.

17:39.513 --> 17:41.695
That's why these subjects are still not touched.

17:42.295 --> 17:55.848
That's why the only thing they can do is attribute bad motives to me and why the latest and greatest out of the clown that I guess, according to LifeSite News, is based in the UK, but I thought he was based in Japan, Kevin McCairn.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.570
The latest from that clown show is just...

18:01.516 --> 18:26.211
elevation of the same meme against me that that Brian Dan Wilson debunked the funk also recently promoted against me that also the cancelled mouse actually initially promoted against me so think about how well we just are all united in the fact that Jay's kind of a whatever they call me

18:29.430 --> 18:31.412
That's the stage we're at right now.

18:31.452 --> 18:37.077
There's no other, I don't know how else to interpret it because they long ago gave up talking about biology.

18:43.422 --> 18:50.889
And so, yeah, I don't know what to say other than we have to be winning like crazy, otherwise you can't explain their ridiculous behavior.

19:08.137 --> 19:09.937
Yeah, you can forget about the bird flu.

19:09.997 --> 19:33.624
Whatever they tell you, of course it's gonna be nonsense, so you gotta try and, uh... We're gonna make gentle the life of this world, ladies and gentlemen.

19:35.765 --> 19:41.251
And we're going to do it by pointing out how these people are an artificial wave of lies.

19:41.331 --> 19:41.992
That's what it is.

19:42.052 --> 19:57.988
It's a perfect artificial wave of lies where inevitably people are drawn to the controlled opposition of Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass and Pierre Cory and Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.730
and these people that are actually just playing against us.

20:02.030 --> 20:21.839
For whatever reason, coerced or not coerced, willing or unwilling, witting or unwitting, they are definitely part of this wave of consensus that is an agreement on a faith, on a lie, and skilled social media users are very, very vulnerable to this illusion of consensus.

20:23.470 --> 20:30.091
If you stay focused on the biology, you don't take the bait on social media and you love your neighbor, you can generally escape from this.

20:32.192 --> 20:39.793
And so first and foremost, please, we need this to share and share quick because I don't know how long we're going to be able to sustain it, right?

20:39.853 --> 20:44.594
I just got to have faith that tomorrow I can do it again and tomorrow I can do it again.

20:44.914 --> 20:48.335
And at some point, I think we'll get there.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.939
But it's not like the momentum is building very fast.

20:54.039 --> 20:58.820
So more than anything, I need people, if you're not sharing it, find a new way to share it.

20:58.840 --> 21:11.044
If you are not emailing people yet with the direct links to Stream.GigaHome.Bio, please do include that in your link list.

21:12.557 --> 21:14.921
because that is the place where they can't get lost.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.926
They won't get ads thrown in their face.

21:19.269 --> 21:23.135
You see, if you send them to stream.gigahome.bio, they don't get any of that.

21:25.835 --> 21:28.417
Um, and that's the whole point of paying for that.

21:28.477 --> 21:31.679
Otherwise, I don't know what I'm paying for it for if no one's gonna watch it.

21:31.739 --> 21:34.901
Although the views are going up, so I'm not, I'm not complaining.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.142
Don't let me sound get angry.

21:36.342 --> 21:39.244
Okay, so anyway, this is GigaOM Biological.

21:39.284 --> 21:40.604
Thank you very much for joining me.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.365
Uh, thank you very much for joining me.

21:48.591 --> 21:48.892
Okay.

22:14.547 --> 22:15.727
Good afternoon.

22:16.427 --> 22:19.688
It is 445 here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

22:19.708 --> 22:24.950
It's the 21st of June and I'm coming to you live from my garage as usual.

22:25.010 --> 22:33.754
My name is Jonathan Cui and this is Giga Ohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist and basketball enthusiast

22:34.814 --> 22:43.256
Um, I saw something in the chat about, uh, an RNA being able to spread for a short time by Ian to the fray.

22:44.336 --> 22:48.497
Um, I'll try to do two minutes.

22:49.117 --> 22:56.299
Um, but I, it really, that's the frustrating thing about any invitation at this stage.

22:56.819 --> 23:01.020
Um, it's very hard to, uh,

23:07.557 --> 23:27.836
Quite a lot of work needs to be done to try and kind of spontaneously respond to a few people in a room because the level of knowledge in that room alone could be so varied that, you know, if I have to keep backing up, keep backing up, keep backing up, then where I am now can be very burdensome.

23:29.011 --> 23:44.696
With regard to the RNA can spread for a short time but can't pandemic question, I want you to think very carefully about the analogy that I use a lot and that I used in the Red Pill Conference, where I said that you cannot make your cells do something that they don't already do.

23:45.816 --> 23:55.999
So if they can't do something that they don't already do, that means that they already do package RNA and DNA and send it around.

23:57.060 --> 23:57.460
And so

23:58.567 --> 24:21.649
What that means is, is that if you transfect or transform the cells of your body, it is possible, and it's not crazy to imagine because they do it already, that they might take some of that RNA and DNA and in the process of doing whatever they would normally do with it, which might be translated into protein, but it also might be copy it, they might also package it up.

24:22.560 --> 24:36.191
And so if they do, then for a short period of time, it's possible to imagine that someone who is transfected by an RNA or a DNA could transmit that to the next person.

24:36.251 --> 24:41.855
But it's very difficult to differentiate between a DNA

24:43.436 --> 24:53.223
like pollen that you inhale and then exhale again and someone else inhales it as transmission or exposure or proximity.

24:54.123 --> 25:07.633
And so, one of the arguments that I think is very valid that attacks at the heart of what virology is or isn't is the differentiation between proximity.

25:07.853 --> 25:09.074
In other words, if you put

25:10.840 --> 25:29.854
million molecules into the first dish of a of a cell culture and you grow it for a little while and some of the cells get mad and then you take the supernatant off and you put it in the next cell culture and then you do that again and you do that again and you call that three passages and

25:30.871 --> 25:40.619
If you're not doing really hardcore controls, how would you differentiate between you just taking some of that DNA each time from this to this and it's just a dilution?

25:41.219 --> 25:43.921
But in the end, there's still detectable amounts of DNA.

25:44.202 --> 25:46.904
So when you PCR, you find it.

25:47.484 --> 25:49.326
And when you sequence, you find it.

25:49.986 --> 25:55.050
And it might be slightly different, but that's because the thing that you put in the first dish, it wasn't

25:55.939 --> 26:13.599
Completely homogenous to begin with because even the DNA or RNA clone cannot be homogenous to begin with it's a 80 90 maybe even 99 percent pure but there's gonna be errors and there's gonna be some variation and so that in and of itself could lead to sufficient let's say

26:15.446 --> 26:34.877
Unknown that you could, by the time you diluted it three times across the cell culture, depending on how you did it, you might take anywhere from 50 or 60% of the original amount of DNA with you, depending on what's actually happening in that, in that experiment versus what you assume is happening in that experiment.

26:36.087 --> 26:52.119
And so I suspect that's one of the things that if we find out that some of the control, quote unquote, experiments that these no virus people are doing, they may invalidate, and be very careful when I, listen to me when I say this so you understand what I mean.

26:52.759 --> 27:02.827
They may invalidate the methodologies that they purport to invalidate, but that might not necessarily invalidate another way of observing

27:03.772 --> 27:06.594
these self-replicating RNAs in the wild.

27:07.715 --> 27:17.723
It is possible that there are RNAs that can be found in the wild that have an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene attached to some other genes.

27:17.783 --> 27:18.443
It's possible.

27:19.684 --> 27:20.805
I'm not a virologist.

27:20.845 --> 27:22.186
I haven't done this bench work.

27:22.206 --> 27:30.433
So I don't know to what extent that much knowledge is known or not known.

27:31.328 --> 27:39.775
But I do know a lot of this is based on the presence of the sequence and not the confirmation that the sequence itself is able to perpetuate itself.

27:40.276 --> 27:53.227
And they use these cell culture techniques that aren't as foolproof and aren't as, let's say, rock solid as they were thought to be in earlier days when we

27:53.988 --> 27:55.929
you know, understood these things a lot best.

27:56.009 --> 28:08.358
Maybe one great example of this progression of knowledge is, in case you didn't listen to Mark Kulak's show, It's Up Now, where he listens to this audio recording of Liederberg.

28:08.438 --> 28:14.663
And Liederberg, it's talking about fertilizing the egg of a gorilla with the sperm of a human.

28:15.283 --> 28:15.844
And it's

28:21.869 --> 28:27.174
There's so many things there that don't work that we don't even understand why they don't work.

28:27.254 --> 28:33.980
But at that time when Lederberg was speaking, it was just a question of, well, of course we'll figure out how to make that work.

28:34.441 --> 28:37.523
It doesn't work now, but we could easily figure out how it works.

28:37.603 --> 28:45.210
It's just, you know, and that assumption is kind of opposed by, you know, what,

28:46.418 --> 28:53.701
Craig Venter said in the beginning of this, over the credits, where he says, you know, we understand less than 1% of the genome.

28:53.721 --> 28:58.243
That's less than 1% is a lot less than 1% of the genome.

28:58.323 --> 29:05.367
And so to be doing what we're doing with the genome we are now, it's kind of unethical because we're doing it without knowledge.

29:05.407 --> 29:08.828
He said almost those exact words, which is pretty extraordinary.

29:08.888 --> 29:09.108
So, um,

29:11.240 --> 29:33.721
The reason why I answered that is because I want you to see that if cells do occasionally replicate RNA and package it, then if you put a self-replicating RNA in your cells or you're exposed to one, then it's possible that that self-replicating RNA could find it to another person, but pandemicking

29:34.758 --> 29:39.962
The verb, pandemicking, would mean being able to do that millions and millions of times.

29:40.022 --> 30:01.680
And because RNA is so low fidelity in its copying, and because the transfection of the next host is so low probability, given our immune system, then the idea of even a significant quantity of some kind of self-replicating RNA getting to 1,000

30:03.098 --> 30:08.180
or 10,000 people is almost solely dependent on the initial quantity that's created.

30:08.881 --> 30:16.704
And so my guess, for example, would be that the original SARS virus was a known quantity released in a known way in a known place.

30:16.764 --> 30:20.986
And then they just watched and see to what extent they could detect it.

30:22.591 --> 30:23.632
And it was an experiment.

30:23.912 --> 30:26.554
And so they could do a very similar thing.

30:26.634 --> 30:36.401
And if they, you know, got another, whatever many people now just imagine if they released a signal that they didn't want to be able to very easily differentiate it from the background.

30:38.743 --> 30:47.109
Then then it would be a joke for them to create the illusion of a pandemic with any number of molecular diagnostics that they have the sole proprietary control over.

30:48.154 --> 30:49.456
That's the scary part, right?

30:49.496 --> 30:58.589
Because none of these tests were ever verified to be real, except for by the very people that we know have executed this national security exercise on us.

30:59.371 --> 31:00.352
I'm a human just like you.

31:00.412 --> 31:01.293
I don't have any answers.

31:01.334 --> 31:02.255
I just know they're lying.

31:02.395 --> 31:03.116
And that's the point.

31:04.338 --> 31:08.983
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

31:09.624 --> 31:13.829
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

31:13.989 --> 31:17.994
And these things can be said in other ways, but they always mean the same thing.

31:18.034 --> 31:20.777
The vaccine schedule in America was always criminally negligent.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.118
And so I don't really know why.

31:22.859 --> 31:26.481
these people are still beating around the bush about this particular thing.

31:26.601 --> 31:32.323
I think that this is all a very nasty way of trying to mislead the young.

31:33.164 --> 31:40.487
And it's a long game because this is a multi-generational war that, a war of creating an illusion.

31:40.667 --> 31:47.190
And that started with people like Gallo and Kaprowski and Plotkin and Baltimore and

31:48.356 --> 31:57.707
you know, Murray Gardner and lots of others that I can't name, but I think Mark Hulak would be a great person to give us a top 20 list of the baddies.

31:57.787 --> 32:04.896
But it's all a collection of people that are willing to stick with an unwavering commitment to the lie.

32:06.147 --> 32:11.631
And that lie is that faith that I show all the time about a novel virus that killed millions and millions more were saved from.

32:12.151 --> 32:18.436
And the way that they stick to that lie is not talk about what they were doing in 2020, what they said in 2020 or where they were in 2020.

32:20.277 --> 32:34.127
Because if you do look at what they were doing, then you will see an inevitable evolution of understanding in the wrong direction that will usually start with a hyper acceptance of what the TV narrative was.

32:35.091 --> 32:44.815
a hyper-acceptance of what the TV spokespeople like Fauci said we should do, and a complete lack of mistrust of government.

32:46.976 --> 32:54.899
That's Jordan Peterson, that's Brett Weinstein, that's Sam Harris, that's Eric Weinstein, that's all of these people.

32:57.940 --> 33:04.683
And if they opposed anything, what they opposed was the lockdowns, and what they opposed was the mandates.

33:06.317 --> 33:12.460
Instead of saying hey, you know before the pandemic we already knew that the vaccine schedule is criminal So there's no way in hell.

33:12.941 --> 33:30.290
We're gonna trust this public health apparatus to save us from a pandemic But nobody said that They just said it's a power grab Not that they would lie about something for a power grab

33:31.104 --> 33:32.164
but just a power grab.

33:32.204 --> 33:37.085
Not that they would murder people for a power grab, but just it's a power grab.

33:37.385 --> 33:40.506
They're taking advantage of the crisis, but they wouldn't have created it.

33:41.406 --> 33:43.166
And this is what they all agree on.

33:44.007 --> 33:50.248
And that's why the illusion is so strong because it goes across to the TV people that are on the far right there.

33:51.948 --> 33:57.709
And so a lot of people seem to be broken free of this, but it ain't very many.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.990
And I still don't trust them all.

34:02.093 --> 34:10.100
Because lots of these people still say we need to fear free-range RNA molecules and I'm arguing that there is no biological basis for this fear.

34:15.806 --> 34:25.715
Yesterday I showed you that this little sitcom jumped the shark already once because two meddlers that have been meddling with me for four years going now

34:27.549 --> 34:55.835
One of the stars of the show, Kevin McKernan, and one of the, I don't know what you would call this guy, I guess, scrubs, that is over in Japan or over in the UK, according to this Life Science site news article that they both share reference in and a video link to, and then they both agree that the mRNAs are causing frame shifts that can lead to prions, whatever the hell they are,

34:58.516 --> 34:59.476
It's just absurd.

35:00.017 --> 35:09.600
It's absolutely absurd that this guy, Kevin McCarran, would be speaking in front of some Australian group about what's going on.

35:09.640 --> 35:24.565
It's absolutely absurd that this guy who dropped out of college to work for the Human Genome Project and then got to take intellectual property away from the Human Genome Project and make a multi-generational pile of wealth is somehow coming to save us.

35:25.478 --> 35:35.592
when he was on a podcast 24th of April, kind of saying that it was a novel virus, but not really because it probably just came from the backwoods of China where nobody was sequencing for the last 40 years.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.277
And so I started to sequence because I'm afraid they might say it's in the pot.

35:42.182 --> 35:47.886
And this clown is up here saying that it's gonna be a billion people dead so my wife's staying home and making masks and you should too.

35:47.906 --> 35:50.507
It's too bad we can't lock everyone down for 60 days.

35:50.987 --> 35:56.691
But you know the United States is really all about free and stuff like that so you never, I guess it's never gonna work over there.

35:57.151 --> 36:02.775
You guys really aren't locked down at all so don't be surprised if it goes absolutely bananas there.

36:04.136 --> 36:05.977
That's his basic job from Japan.

36:06.817 --> 36:11.040
As I guess a retired by injury neuroscientist.

36:13.749 --> 36:35.681
And so they got featured in a LifeSite news article on March 4th, 2024, where they plugged a video of this meddler who actually came to Pittsburgh and this meddler who went from being twice on my stream to tortious interference with my employer.

36:36.914 --> 36:37.875
or my employment.

36:38.755 --> 36:48.202
So interfering with my ability to make a living from his semi-retired state on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean with his $10,000 cats.

36:50.583 --> 36:55.066
I'm fighting for my kids and he's fighting for his cats.

36:57.368 --> 36:59.790
And now it's these two characters.

37:00.748 --> 37:06.855
who Kevin McCairn said this guy was the number one no virus guy that everybody had to pay attention to.

37:07.476 --> 37:18.910
And for six or eight weeks in a row, streaming with close friend and associate of George Webb, Addy Adds, and Paul Cottrell, hero of George Webb,

37:21.761 --> 37:30.711
says week after week after week that I gotta work on these no virus people headed by Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan and I gotta work on these 5G people.

37:35.256 --> 37:42.485
Steve Kirsch actually offered to fly me to Japan and work with Kevin McCarran on some mouse experiments a couple years ago.

37:43.902 --> 37:52.891
He actually asked me if I wanted to read Kevin McCarren's proposal for mouse experiments to see if Steve should fund it or not.

37:55.774 --> 38:00.739
They tried to pretend like, you know, I'm considering funding this guy, Kevin McCarren.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.762
Do you think I should consider him or not?

38:03.802 --> 38:04.783
Do you know who he is?

38:08.166 --> 38:13.951
And it's all just one big show because it's all one big group of liars all working for the same weaponized piles of money.

38:13.992 --> 38:27.384
That's the best I can tell you because that's why after four and a half years, after I was sitting on his steering committee for a year or a half a year, he decided to send me a message that I didn't email to myself.

38:27.424 --> 38:29.226
So I'm just gonna have to play it into the microphone.

38:33.507 --> 38:39.648
How many times in the last month or two have I called Steve Kirsch one of the worst liars and traitors in America?

38:40.928 --> 38:44.889
And yet somehow or another, this guy actually sent me a message.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.110
How am I gonna get where?

38:50.010 --> 38:51.550
Oh yeah, sorry, it's in my voicemail.

38:54.431 --> 39:00.032
Sent me a message, called me while I was at the Red Pill Conference after I had presented

39:01.089 --> 39:05.511
the day before I was going to see Andy Kaufman because he was going to present.

39:06.452 --> 39:10.694
And he sends me this message, which is just absolutely hilarious.

39:18.738 --> 39:18.838
Oh.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.042
Talk to you.

39:30.489 --> 39:31.810
Hey, this is Steve Kirsch.

39:32.210 --> 39:40.416
I've been engaging in the no virus debate and somebody said I should talk to you.

39:42.397 --> 39:46.140
And I'm assuming they think that's because you think that viruses don't exist.

39:47.200 --> 39:51.944
But if you don't believe they exist, I definitely want to talk to you.

39:51.964 --> 39:55.306
So give me a call, thanks.

39:58.004 --> 40:20.339
Now, I guess what I'm supposed to believe from that is that despite our relationship already going back two years and me more or less being able to explain this for the last year and a half, he's not aware of my understanding of how virology may or may not be real and how the illusion of virology is created by transfection and transformation in cell culture in animals.

40:20.979 --> 40:29.043
and how actually the production of that synthetic DNA and RNA for transfection or transformation is the only thing you really need to understand.

40:31.604 --> 40:33.885
He wants to hear my side of it now.

40:37.106 --> 40:39.467
That's the desperation that they have.

40:39.547 --> 40:43.429
Not only have they brought these two people that probably should have never come together.

40:43.469 --> 40:50.352
Remember, I've got a photo of this guy with Andrew Cuomo in 2019, shaking hands in front of a grant award

40:51.664 --> 40:58.908
because he was gonna start a little company that was gonna make electronic monitors for prisoners to make sure that they don't commit suicide.

40:59.388 --> 41:01.249
And the state of New York gave him a grant.

41:03.830 --> 41:12.114
And at the poster presentation for that grant reward, there they are taking a picture together, Andy Kaufman and Andrew Cuomo.

41:13.755 --> 41:15.136
And then the pandemic started.

41:15.276 --> 41:17.097
Isn't that just peachy?

41:18.516 --> 41:22.686
And then some guy in Japan knew right away that these no virus people are nuts.

41:23.168 --> 41:24.491
And it's Andy Kaufman in America.

41:24.511 --> 41:25.473
I didn't know who, what?

41:25.614 --> 41:26.195
No virus?

41:26.235 --> 41:26.897
Who said that?

41:26.957 --> 41:27.939
I'm reading what?

41:35.751 --> 41:49.121
And now suddenly Steve Kirsch and Andy Kaufman make a video together with a nice pretty thumbnail and they're going to spend hours legitimizing each other as authority figures on one side or the other of a debate.

41:49.601 --> 41:57.587
And if Andy Kaufman seems to wipe the floor with Steve Kirsch, then it's going to be the rise of this absolutely fake traitor

41:59.022 --> 42:02.343
who could have saved us if he was real, but he wasn't.

42:02.403 --> 42:11.147
Because at one point in the beginning of the pandemic, he was using the words exosomes and he wasn't just calling them cell trash.

42:12.687 --> 42:14.428
But that lasted for about a month.

42:15.808 --> 42:17.089
I've got all the recordings.

42:19.290 --> 42:25.372
And at some point exosomes disappeared from his lectures and it became this pleomorphic cycle.

42:27.443 --> 42:40.358
And he started to say more and more of the more weird stuff like, you know, bacteria also are generated by some kind of cycle with cells rather than being, you know, separate things like we understand them.

42:41.840 --> 42:45.525
And so it's very, very extraordinary because that's the trick of the no virus people.

42:45.585 --> 42:48.289
Sometimes they are dead on balls accurate.

42:48.309 --> 42:52.916
And then they also think that if you freeze water while you're thinking of your wedding, then it might make a ring.

42:53.637 --> 42:57.362
And if you're thinking of, of, of your dead dog, then it might make a bone.

43:04.588 --> 43:11.193
And so this crossover is really, really interesting because it's a false narrative of asking the wrong questions.

43:11.253 --> 43:30.667
And I bet you anything, it's going to be the worst display of this kind of pseudo arguing, this pseudo discussion where they're just going to come to an impasse because they can't seem to agree on the meaning of words or something stupid like that, which of course is the worst kind of disingenuous debate.

43:32.486 --> 43:33.367
But that's how they do it.

43:33.407 --> 43:41.913
That's what the Scooby-Doo is, is a disingenuous debate where people are forced to accept that antibodies are a correlate of immunity worth arguing about.

43:42.533 --> 43:53.641
It's forced, you're forced to accept that the genetic diversity of the 6 million sequences that Kevin McKernan can vouch for being real are worth debating about and have to be answered.

43:54.061 --> 43:57.143
That the unusual fear and cleavage site is like really like a,

43:57.964 --> 44:03.626
you know, a Twinkie in the washing machine, and the DARPA diffuse proposal is a slam dunk.

44:07.227 --> 44:12.529
And so it's impossible to get out from under the weight of the illusion of consensus around these things.

44:12.589 --> 44:24.454
And that illusion of consensus around these things is built by these liars, either not asking questions or actively promoting these ideas from the beginning.

44:25.234 --> 44:53.616
And that includes amyloidosis and prion disease, which I would argue these guys, not McCairn, but McKernan and anybody that uses transfection and transformation in higher animals knows that that dysregulation of protein folding and maybe catastrophic autoimmune disease that could be characterized as amyloidosis or characterized as prion disease most certainly is probably an expected outcome of transfection in healthy humans.

44:54.639 --> 45:08.269
So they had to seed it in the viral narrative of gain of function to make sure that when it started to happen a few years after the transfection was rolled out, that people wouldn't freak out and that they would have an out that was the spike protein that did it.

45:09.890 --> 45:11.451
And that's what these people are up to.

45:11.491 --> 45:13.112
They are controlling the narrative.

45:13.152 --> 45:21.218
That's why in, for the love of goodness, on the summer solstice of 2024, we are still trapped in a Scooby-Doo.

45:32.216 --> 45:42.062
And so, it didn't matter who you got in the car with, if you followed around Rose for a while, or Panda for a while, or Heart.

45:42.642 --> 45:43.343
Oh my gosh.

45:47.028 --> 45:50.170
Just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

45:51.091 --> 45:54.233
Just, it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

45:54.473 --> 46:05.941
If you followed Kevin McCairn or George Webb or Paul Cottrell or Mark Kulak at Housatonic Live, you were gonna be talking about a lab leak that might've been leaked at the Wuhan games.

46:06.081 --> 46:08.362
They might be trying to cover up, maybe it was an attack.

46:08.923 --> 46:14.106
Maybe the China doesn't even care and they attacked their own people knowing it would bounce across the pond on planes.

46:17.528 --> 46:26.856
all these crazy speculative stories about who attacked who and what those videos on the street mean and why would they ever build such a hospital if it wasn't real?

46:29.599 --> 46:52.638
And all of these worst case scenarios wove together and reinforced the narrative that the national security state needed our kids to believe in, which is that vaccination works and is worth doing, and we understand enough about the immune system to do it, that novel coronaviruses can jump species, and that's what happened here, that PCR false positives are rare and asymptomatic spread is very real.

46:55.455 --> 47:07.945
Variants are evidence of both spread and continuing evolution of a single SARS virus, as opposed to a background signal that's being distorted as spread, that they might not even be detecting what they say they're detecting.

47:08.025 --> 47:10.406
How would we know?

47:11.707 --> 47:16.071
The EUs were approved based on paperwork.

47:17.213 --> 47:31.699
Kevin McKernan on April 24, 2020 on the Vance Crowe podcast was complaining that the FDA was in the way, and the regulation was in the way, and that it was going to cause millions of people to die because we aren't allowed to just do it.

47:31.759 --> 47:32.840
They need to get out of the way.

47:33.300 --> 47:39.503
An EUA requires 10 pages of paperwork, but it doesn't require firsthand data.

47:40.669 --> 47:59.616
It requires summaries, which means that you could just write a summary about the experiments you did, and the controls you did, and the primers you used, and the results, and have to show no gels, have to show no raw sequencing data, to show no raw data of any kind.

47:59.836 --> 48:01.057
I know because I've looked at them.

48:02.503 --> 48:07.065
These EUAs are granted because these people say, well, here's the things we used.

48:07.486 --> 48:08.686
Here's the things we bought.

48:09.006 --> 48:09.867
We mixed together.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.708
We did the controls and we got 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

48:14.249 --> 48:19.072
And we did the other ones and we got 37, 36, 35, 37, 36, 35 done.

48:20.712 --> 48:21.973
I don't see any curves.

48:22.113 --> 48:23.174
I don't see any data.

48:23.274 --> 48:24.014
I don't see anything.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.335
They just had to say they did it.

48:27.628 --> 48:38.758
And since we already know there's a spectacular commitment to lies going on here, we already know that pandemic potential is created by putting pandemic potential into the title and abstract of papers, and that's it.

48:41.500 --> 48:50.087
And yet we are on the precipice of having our children grow up in a world where they really think a pandemic happened, and we can't let that happen.

48:50.899 --> 48:54.086
Gain-of-function research is a mythology even if he says...

49:04.062 --> 49:18.892
So we've been in the car with these people for a really long time, and sometimes they pull over and somebody like, you know, let's say Matt Crawford might say, ah, you guys aren't listening to me, man, because I think the DMED is the most important story, and nobody will listen to me.

49:19.493 --> 49:20.554
And he'll get out of the car.

49:21.334 --> 49:25.297
But then somebody like Steve Kirsch gets in the car and says, wow, what was up with that guy?

49:25.898 --> 49:27.679
He was kind of all upset about something.

49:27.699 --> 49:28.540
What do you guys know?

49:28.960 --> 49:34.645
Oh, I'm really intense because, you know, my housekeeper and like her husband and one other person.

49:35.065 --> 49:38.608
And that's like totally crazy, you know, because that's statistically impossible.

49:39.784 --> 49:45.627
N equals three in a country of 340 million, but you know, he's convinced he's got data.

49:46.368 --> 49:48.869
He decided, wow, I finally got to speak out.

49:48.949 --> 50:00.116
I was chasing an EUA and funding early treatment with Robert Malone for a year, but then I turned my ship around once I realized that my housekeeper and her husband and her friend were all hurt by the shot.

50:06.721 --> 50:10.805
And so I don't want to get in the car with these people, but I've been in the car for a really long time.

50:10.865 --> 50:12.066
I'm still in the car with them.

50:12.106 --> 50:18.933
I got 17 hours of Kevin McCarren spitting on his camera about me.

50:20.435 --> 50:24.839
Making, you know, cheap jabs, calling me Judas.

50:26.981 --> 50:27.101
So,

50:28.362 --> 50:30.123
This is far from over.

50:30.163 --> 50:34.447
They have nothing left because we can finally see that they're all the same people.

50:34.987 --> 50:53.102
LifeSiteNews published an article in March of this year which featured this clown and the previous one as experts in describing how the transfections, but they call it mRNA shots, are leading to prion disease.

50:57.355 --> 51:11.122
the expert in this guy's friend, who's an expert in the PCR space that he's so happy to know, this guy who used to work for Monsanto and the World Bank, who decided to go into podcasting in the beginning of the pandemic, because you know what the hell, I got money.

51:13.643 --> 51:25.930
And he just has this random dude from Boston on with from the Human Genome Project who works for dope, likes to sequence the dope, all into the dope genes.

51:27.133 --> 51:36.359
But since, you know, he was afraid that the CDC might say that the dope is carrying the COVID, he decided to sequence his dope for the COVID.

51:36.939 --> 51:40.041
And that's what got him into, you know, the whole testing space, you know.

51:41.342 --> 51:46.185
Just, you know, the same lucky way that he just dropped out of college and decided to go into the Human Genome Project.

51:46.205 --> 51:49.747
It had nothing to do with his dad or anything else, his brothers, just him.

51:50.947 --> 51:53.149
Pulling himself up from his brute straps.

51:55.851 --> 52:03.557
Just, you know, fighting for our kids, podcasting away in 2020, just because he wants to save his cats.

52:06.159 --> 52:19.649
So much so that CHD decided to drop me as a biology teacher and drop me as a guy who they could have used to spread any message they want to, and instead fired me and, you know, promote him on several podcasts.

52:20.630 --> 52:24.953
They even gave him Mary and Brian at the same time once.

52:27.113 --> 52:32.276
And because I did a show about it, everybody got their sand in their folds.

52:34.757 --> 52:37.099
Ladies and gentlemen, these are just coordinated liars.

52:37.639 --> 52:43.122
The ones that aren't Americans are foreign meddlers, and the ones that are Americans are just downright traitors.

52:45.190 --> 52:49.272
They put a bunch of people together and create this illusion of consensus.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.594
The consensus is that you're being listened to.

52:51.674 --> 52:58.978
The consensus is you're being heard when in reality you are being diluted to irrelevance and these people are going to go on and ignore you.

52:59.419 --> 53:05.843
That's the same thing that they did here to Byron Bridle and the same thing they've been doing.

53:05.883 --> 53:09.345
That's why Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein and

53:10.846 --> 53:29.625
and Robert Malone's original podcast on June 21st, 2021 was probably because Byron Bridle came out with the data that he came out with, with the pedigree and the background to say what he said, and they needed to steal that limelight while they shut him up in Canada.

53:31.247 --> 53:31.848
And so they did.

53:33.763 --> 53:42.509
It might not have even been a plan for Robert Malone to be so early, but they're no different than these people, except these people may be unwittingly participating.

53:42.549 --> 53:44.770
And the only one that might know is that clown up there.

53:45.711 --> 53:46.231
But he knows.

53:47.592 --> 53:53.316
Because he is one of the first people ever to create what is called an infectious clone.

53:54.437 --> 53:55.777
And he did it with David Baltimore.

53:55.838 --> 53:58.579
And since then, he's been kind of the guy.

53:58.599 --> 54:01.001
Is that Columbia?

54:04.097 --> 54:05.479
What I want is high morbidity.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.042
I want people to complain.

54:07.803 --> 54:08.244
So what do I do?

54:09.019 --> 54:09.699
I go to Des Moines.

54:10.300 --> 54:12.661
Ladies and gentlemen, the people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines.

54:12.681 --> 54:13.381
I lived there for four years.

54:13.761 --> 54:14.541
I go to Des Moines.

54:15.002 --> 54:17.303
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

54:18.083 --> 54:18.903
I go to Seattle.

54:19.444 --> 54:21.044
I infect a couple of cases there.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.465
I go to North Carolina.

54:23.645 --> 54:25.106
I go to Wisconsin.

54:25.486 --> 54:32.229
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

54:32.689 --> 54:33.910
These individuals complain.

54:33.970 --> 54:35.811
Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

54:36.051 --> 54:37.892
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

54:38.732 --> 54:43.378
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

54:44.099 --> 54:47.923
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

54:48.755 --> 54:49.896
I take attribution for that.

54:49.956 --> 54:51.197
Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

54:51.957 --> 54:54.659
And I have done this by infecting with a highly lethal agent.

54:54.759 --> 54:59.923
And the first signs and symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z. These people are really sick with this.

55:00.724 --> 55:07.308
But then I say, others who are also infected will show subdromal, predromal signs of lethality.

55:07.549 --> 55:11.912
And what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

55:12.964 --> 55:22.112
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal, and I've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system, banging on the door.

55:22.752 --> 55:26.135
The CDC comes back and says, nonsense, that's not real.

55:26.656 --> 55:37.425
Banging on the door, and those that we can, we put on supplementary oxygen, maybe 60 liters a minute, like Cameron Kyle Seidel explained in his video.

55:39.363 --> 55:44.946
The thing that's interesting here is the use of the internet and a terrorist group claiming, yes, we did it.

55:45.446 --> 55:50.829
What if instead we had a group of people like this that just decided to agree that it must be a lab leak?

55:52.990 --> 55:55.451
Now we don't need to have a terrorist group anymore.

55:56.212 --> 55:58.153
Now there's no real blame to spread around.

56:05.404 --> 56:08.725
These people are all working together as one coordinated group.

56:08.785 --> 56:22.348
I don't know why, I don't know for who, but I have a feeling it's more politically oriented than it is biologically oriented, even though it does seem to be related to the pandemic and the pandemic narrative.

56:22.388 --> 56:30.690
They really didn't do anything but keep us from realizing the truth that inevitably we're gonna get to and try to make sure that we don't get there before the clock runs out.

56:30.791 --> 56:32.151
And I think now they're desperate.

56:33.007 --> 56:40.874
I think we're very close to a threshold where people are starting to realize that we didn't ever need to really fear free-range RNA molecules.

56:41.435 --> 56:53.205
What we probably need to fear is transformation and transfection without our knowledge, however they would do it, wherever they would put it, because they can make the DNA and RNA and cheaper than ever.

56:58.450 --> 57:02.434
So it's these guys and this behavior, this nonsense.

57:03.715 --> 57:14.606
We really got to know their names and we got to say them out loud because just like Edward Bernays said in 1924, the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions is how

57:15.327 --> 57:16.327
we are governed.

57:16.367 --> 57:18.468
It's the true ruling power of our country.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.329
So make no mistake about it.

57:20.589 --> 57:21.790
Noam Chomsky was right.

57:21.870 --> 57:29.433
These people are strictly limiting our spectrum of debate and pretending to have a very lively discussion within it.

57:29.493 --> 57:31.914
And that's why it has to be these people.

57:32.354 --> 57:33.675
That's why it can't be me.

57:34.155 --> 57:37.756
That's why it can't really be Brian Hooker or that lady from the NVIC.

57:38.136 --> 57:39.057
It's got to be them.

57:40.489 --> 57:45.131
Because if they go off narrative and tell people the truth, it will spread too quickly and we will be free.

57:45.191 --> 57:53.034
That's why it's gotta be these two guys that get to be on YouTube and have a cordial debate about nothing to do with murder.

57:54.670 --> 58:13.606
They agreed to argue about it being a lab leak and agreed to argue about the effectiveness of the shot or the morality of the trials or the exact numbers of some paper or that paper, instead of talking about the fact that they murdered people and lied about it and called it a pandemic and they want us to teach our kids that.

58:14.346 --> 58:16.949
And so Zuby and Dan Wilson,

58:18.496 --> 58:27.605
and the canceled mouse and Jonathan Engler, all of whom essentially work together to make me think that I should stop the train with them.

58:28.646 --> 58:34.652
And that if I work together with them, it will be effective when it has nothing to do with that.

58:37.568 --> 58:41.590
that they have no intention of actually getting involved in breaking the spell.

58:41.630 --> 58:45.472
They want me to be a part of the spell, a part of the spell casting.

58:45.512 --> 58:49.214
That's why that whole thing with the review happened.

58:49.254 --> 58:54.757
That's why the exposure of heart is actually really painful for them right now.

58:54.817 --> 59:06.703
Because when this tweet appeared and I attacked it, every one of these exact people came to a rescue, not in public, but in DMs on Twitter.

59:07.856 --> 59:11.939
Immediately people defending that she can have alternative views.

59:11.959 --> 59:13.720
There's lots of views in heart.

59:15.301 --> 59:23.306
Lots of views in heart while Jonathan is going around the around the internet crapping on random people because they don't say things just right.

59:25.428 --> 59:34.414
Acting all high and mighty because he knows there was no pandemic but it wasn't because of any biology he learned by his own gumption or by his own scholarly work.

59:35.376 --> 59:47.664
It's because he heard me speak three times in front of Panda over the last three years and didn't do anything but try to incorporate those data and those ideas into Hart's own fricking non-dangerous message.

59:50.246 --> 01:00:02.454
These are the meddlers of the highest order because they're not only meddling in America, but they're also ineffective or making the ability for their own countries to respond very, very ineffective.

01:00:03.993 --> 01:00:14.204
It's very disheartening for me to see this video of this woman where she's talking about testing and saying all kinds of nonsense.

01:00:16.867 --> 01:00:20.511
This person involved in the 100,000 Genomes Project in the UK.

01:00:22.426 --> 01:00:23.767
She's a tester.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:25.807
She does tests.

01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:27.088
She's a pathologist.

01:00:27.168 --> 01:00:28.108
She likes tests.

01:00:28.748 --> 01:00:34.270
She believes in testing and in sequencing, and she works in AI diagnostics in cancer.

01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:36.311
Listen to this video.

01:00:38.312 --> 01:00:38.972
It's crazy.

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:53.021
Now, testing itself can fail.

01:00:53.681 --> 01:00:54.982
Every test involves a compromise.

01:00:55.023 --> 01:01:00.747
You have to choose, do I want to find every possible case, or do I only want to find the definite cases?

01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:07.173
And at the beginning of an epidemic, when cases are growing, over-diagnosing a few people is acceptable.

01:01:07.993 --> 01:01:10.274
But at peak dust, you have to change strategy.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:11.774
You change strategy.

01:01:11.814 --> 01:01:15.395
Instead of focusing on the individual, you look at the population.

01:01:15.615 --> 01:01:19.916
Instead of trying to diagnose every possible case, you want to find the definite cases.

01:01:19.936 --> 01:01:22.417
And you have to change your laboratory strategy.

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:30.119
So you may have heard people talk about restaurants and say that there are three things restaurants can do, but they can only do two of them well.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:33.880
You can have fast food, cheap food, or high-quality food.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.721
Well, it's the same with laboratories.

01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:41.587
are high volume of tests, high speed of tests, or quality test results.

01:01:41.887 --> 01:01:42.648
And you choose two.

01:01:43.068 --> 01:01:44.370
We chose volume and speed.

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:47.393
And actually, those are good ones to choose at the beginning of an epidemic.

01:01:47.854 --> 01:01:53.881
But we haven't changed our strategy, and we have compromised throughout on quality, which has resulted in unreliable test results.

01:01:54.781 --> 01:02:22.623
somebody who's infected will release up to a hundred thousand virus particles into the air every minute about the size of every minute and waving a test swab through that air they're about the size hundred thousand virus particles every minute into the air they're about the size the aerosols every minute particles and waving a test swab through that air could be enough to have a positive test result

01:02:23.423 --> 01:02:33.270
In fact, in a five microliter sample that gets tested from a patient, you need 5,000 particles of virus to represent a patient.

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:50.561
Think about the fact that behind the scenes, that guy who wanted me to write a critical review about virology and claims that he wrote a critical review about virology with this Martin Neal fella and included me in it somewhere.

01:02:51.857 --> 01:03:03.047
tried to honestly represent the ideas that they've learned from me, and you think that they're not liars, then you shouldn't be watching this show anymore, because these are the liars.

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:04.048
These are the ones.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:08.852
When we shed these people, there's probably nothing behind them but truth tellers.

01:03:10.009 --> 01:03:11.830
There's probably lots of good people in Hart.

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:13.952
It just isn't Jonathan and Claire.

01:03:14.452 --> 01:03:15.753
That's why they're co-chairs.

01:03:16.434 --> 01:03:18.816
That's why they've never talked to me.

01:03:18.936 --> 01:03:22.438
And when they do talk to me, they meddle with me and they lie to me.

01:03:22.839 --> 01:03:25.261
And they say, well, there's lots of points of view in Hart.

01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:31.445
This is a liar and a meddler and somebody who's been on the wrong team since the beginning.

01:03:31.465 --> 01:03:33.087
All you gotta do is watch that video.

01:03:33.927 --> 01:03:38.631
And the idea that Jonathan Engler is defending her is laughable to me.

01:03:43.427 --> 01:03:47.454
And what these two guys pretended to try and do with me is also laughable.

01:03:47.534 --> 01:03:54.426
This article, which you can read for yourself, is laughable.

01:03:55.488 --> 01:03:55.949
And I was...

01:03:57.153 --> 01:03:59.935
I didn't make them happy because I wouldn't edit it.

01:04:00.035 --> 01:04:04.158
And in fact, I shared in my stream the messages that I sent to them.

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:06.500
I didn't get a chance to do anything, but I'll skim it.

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:08.242
But skim it, I'm sorry.

01:04:08.622 --> 01:04:11.284
I'll be honest, this is the review that everyone wanted me to do.

01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:14.867
Go to their books and their papers and tell everyone what's there.

01:04:14.927 --> 01:04:16.388
No thanks, that's not the answer.

01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:18.089
That's the trap we're currently in.

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:20.751
The no virus crew can jump on this and they will.

01:04:21.172 --> 01:04:24.975
I'm sorry I didn't help you, but this isn't the review that the world needs, yada, yada, yada.

01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:37.248
a week later, then Jonathan Engler pretends that I didn't say that and again asks me in kind of a snotty way, how come you're not cross-promoting our little review?

01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:41.973
Stop causing trouble in public and cross-promote our review.

01:04:43.032 --> 01:04:46.437
And so I had to write again why, you know, I asked you for help.

01:04:46.477 --> 01:04:50.843
We were going to work and rebut Kevin McKernan and you guys didn't do squat.

01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:55.609
And then you bring me this garbage review where you don't even represent my ideas very well.

01:04:55.649 --> 01:04:56.270
Get out of here.

01:04:57.692 --> 01:05:00.516
Our kids need more humility and honesty than they are getting.

01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:11.986
And I ask at the end, if you say almost no one says it right, why not promote the one guy you know has been saying it consistently and might have the biological chops to argue it?

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:15.209
He's seen me present three times at Panda.

01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:23.437
And every time I presented at Panda, I was given an overwhelming positive review of like, wow, that was the best talk we've ever heard at Panda.

01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:26.160
Wow, that's the best immunology lecture I've ever heard.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.103
You should give that at every medical school in the world.

01:05:28.564 --> 01:05:29.385
Wow, thanks a lot.

01:05:29.445 --> 01:05:30.266
That's really crazy.

01:05:30.286 --> 01:05:31.147
That cleared up a lot.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.008
That's great.

01:05:32.048 --> 01:05:33.831
That's the best presentation you've ever given.

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:36.354
And then crickets.

01:05:38.413 --> 01:05:41.035
like a year and a half or two years of crickets.

01:05:41.975 --> 01:06:01.048
And then when it suddenly came around, there was one American and some panda people, all of whom were actually panda people, that wanted me to write this virology review for the last six months, off and on, something, something, you have to write something, we'll help you write something, we'll promote what you write something.

01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:04.491
Liars, meddlers,

01:06:05.455 --> 01:06:10.256
that didn't have anything on the line, didn't lose a job, didn't lose a way of living.

01:06:10.337 --> 01:06:11.517
No one's ever attacked them.

01:06:11.577 --> 01:06:15.578
No one's ever asked them to help them write a book and then disown them.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:23.461
No one's ever hired them at an anti-vax charity and then fired them because you were too anti-vax.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:26.261
None of these people have the kind of pandemic

01:06:28.641 --> 01:06:51.922
resume that i have all of these people are semi-retired uh i was independently wealthy oh i was already hurt and retired and living in japan i guess oh i was a trader and then like a day trader for a catholic charity and now i'm taking a course at harvard so i'm dr paul cutrell oh i'm a gumshoe kind of guy all these fake people

01:06:54.434 --> 01:07:02.157
And the only guy that you know that's lost a job from a university of the United States, nobody talks to.

01:07:03.897 --> 01:07:04.917
Nobody wants to hear.

01:07:06.698 --> 01:07:08.919
Nobody, everybody just wants you to ignore.

01:07:08.979 --> 01:07:09.259
Why?

01:07:09.319 --> 01:07:13.880
Because we're telling the truth and we're the last, this is the last line of defense.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:18.682
That's why all these people, all of them, all of them, and now those two guys too are included.

01:07:21.018 --> 01:07:24.460
And they probably have all sat at a table together at one time or another.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500
They've all had steak.

01:07:27.861 --> 01:07:29.662
And if they haven't, they've all shared a Zoom.

01:07:31.383 --> 01:07:36.225
The amount of times that these people have crossed paths is probably vomitous.

01:07:39.106 --> 01:07:45.609
Even if it's just by email, or signal chat, or Discord group, or Telegram group.

01:07:46.536 --> 01:07:54.902
And so Neil and Engler, after all this time and all this work and all this reading, didn't make it any farther than Virology 101 and poorly at that.

01:07:55.842 --> 01:08:01.907
And they didn't manage to understand what infectious clones were despite all of my efforts of explaining it.

01:08:04.368 --> 01:08:13.935
And I think the way you need to see it is that when these people say, we want you to go on a prerecorded podcast and we're gonna release it in four weeks, what they're doing is just trying to come up with arguments.

01:08:15.236 --> 01:08:19.679
and they are getting you to respond to particular questions so that they can come up with arguments and absorb them.

01:08:20.299 --> 01:08:25.843
Make it seem like somebody in New Zealand came up with that phrase, or somebody in America came up with that phrase.

01:08:27.884 --> 01:08:35.870
You know what Andy Kaufman is listed as in the Red Pill Conference bios?

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.092
He says he's a recovering physician, quote unquote.

01:08:42.034 --> 01:08:43.675
In case you're not aware, I'm a recovering

01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:49.731
academic, a recovering, a catamagician is what I wrote.

01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:53.213
These people are just cheap liars.

01:08:55.014 --> 01:08:59.857
And they have no real shtick of their own because they're playing a role.

01:09:02.332 --> 01:09:04.733
they're puppets at best.

01:09:05.394 --> 01:09:10.636
And when they go off script, they usually make mistakes because again, when you're a liar, it's hard to keep everything straight.

01:09:10.676 --> 01:09:12.998
So that's what's happening with some of these people.

01:09:13.018 --> 01:09:26.645
And so they just have to keep a smile on their face or pretend that I haven't already told you, leave me alone and leave a message like, oh, I heard maybe you don't think about, you don't think viruses are real, really?

01:09:29.281 --> 01:09:34.285
First, Andy Kaufman pretended not to know me at the airport after I shook his hand on the plane.

01:09:37.247 --> 01:09:39.509
And then when he remembered me, he called me JJ.

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:44.813
And about half of me wanted to facepalm him, but I just walked away.

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:47.876
They're cowards.

01:09:49.057 --> 01:09:51.859
And they're traitors to their country, if they're Americans.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.149
Oops, sorry.

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:03.210
Shoot, that was not my intention.

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:14.853
I do have to stop the show, though, because I didn't have it queued up, which I normally do.

01:10:14.893 --> 01:10:17.054
But I did have it downloaded, so do not worry.

01:10:22.195 --> 01:10:23.516
Let's see, where do I got to go?

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:23.776
Here?

01:10:24.496 --> 01:10:24.916
Then here?

01:10:31.196 --> 01:10:33.077
And there, excellent.

01:10:37.559 --> 01:10:38.219
Let's do this.

01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:43.862
I'm just gonna go a little bit slower.

01:10:43.882 --> 01:10:49.484
But I did see a picture of him today, and even with, you know, under the circumstances, he just.

01:10:49.764 --> 01:10:50.845
So did you see the start?

01:10:51.883 --> 01:10:53.644
So this is the rumble.

01:10:54.845 --> 01:11:18.743
They did it live on X. And so after four and a half years, announced on the scene to me and a lot of people as the no virus king, Andy Kaufman finally met Steve Kirsch on the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation live show and had a debate, the great virus debate.

01:11:23.444 --> 01:11:25.585
I'm sure it's called liars, cheats, and crooks.

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:37.552
You want me scared.

01:11:37.592 --> 01:11:38.553
You want me weak.

01:11:38.873 --> 01:11:40.114
You want me brain dead.

01:11:40.314 --> 01:11:42.315
No, I'm not saying that this guy's good or bad.

01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:44.096
I just don't want you don't need to listen to it.

01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:47.858
We'll see what we see here.

01:11:50.099 --> 01:11:50.860
I'll just fast forward.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.960
I'll see you a little later.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:52.601
Thank you all.

01:11:54.761 --> 01:11:55.622
You're beautiful people.

01:11:55.642 --> 01:11:56.422
Thank you so much.

01:11:57.883 --> 01:12:08.831
Tonight on BSRF Live, Steve Kirsch welcomes psychiatrist and molecular biologist, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, who has risen to fame during the pandemic for his unorthodox views on the existence of viruses.

01:12:09.452 --> 01:12:19.299
There was just the appearance of devastation, like changing the numbers of flu deaths to COVID deaths or

01:12:20.658 --> 01:12:25.701
recategorizing heart attacks to COVID, or dementia to COVID, or car accidents to COVID.

01:12:26.481 --> 01:12:27.322
That's what we saw.

01:12:27.942 --> 01:12:35.406
We did see also hospital and nursing home protocols in various discrete locations killing people.

01:12:36.346 --> 01:12:37.727
We saw people dying of that.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.409
But nowhere was there evidence

01:12:41.454 --> 01:12:43.936
of any kind of biological weapon of any kind.

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:52.444
And so this is a very dangerous narrative because it perpetuates the idea that viruses are real and dangerous.

01:12:59.148 --> 01:13:18.966
I think one of the things you need to be prepared for is what I warned you earlier, that it is very possible that part of the narrative, that the narrative curation that was happening was that those people in this corner up here were always going, were always in place from the very beginning.

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:20.988
Sorry, I'm going to end the slideshow.

01:13:24.591 --> 01:13:27.674
And then that these people were put in place very early.

01:13:27.714 --> 01:13:45.889
And that's, I'm not even kidding when I say that I've said this for years already, that it's very possible that some of those people up there were curating the narrative of no virus specifically to make sure that it didn't make any useful progress until the time was right.

01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:47.090
And then these people,

01:13:47.731 --> 01:14:09.040
Perhaps Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman, the two guys that Kevin McCairn already had on his list, were on his list because they are part of the eventual rollout of these ideas where, you know, they lied to us about coronaviruses and they lied to us about RNA pandemics.

01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:15.203
But the thing is, is that our language and our understanding and our explanation

01:14:16.198 --> 01:14:17.119
is more acidic.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.101
It's easier to understand.

01:14:19.161 --> 01:14:20.102
It makes more sense.

01:14:20.262 --> 01:14:21.804
It appeals to a lot more people.

01:14:21.864 --> 01:14:24.507
It doesn't require you to know a bunch of words.

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.991
It just requires you to have common sense.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:33.556
And they were never able to get there in the last four and a half years.

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:37.481
And now they play a clip where it sounds like they've always been there.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.862
but I assure you they haven't.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.644
And he didn't really say that they murdered people and lie about it.

01:14:42.684 --> 01:14:46.186
He did say that some people were killed in certain places by protocols.

01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:53.131
He did say that they attributed heart attacks to COVID, but he didn't say anything about do not resuscitate orders.

01:14:54.552 --> 01:15:05.399
He didn't say anything about what those protocols were, because again, the controlled narrative was gonna be remdesivir, was gonna be midazolam, it was gonna be ventilators.

01:15:07.762 --> 01:15:10.883
because the disease progression wasn't caused by any of those things.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:35.593
The disease progression in hospitals and the deterioration of these patients was always going to be caused by the supplementary oxygen that Cameron Kyle Seidel was the primary lead PSYOP for, who conveniently was being promoted back when Kevin McCarron had just entered the fray and just signed up for Twitter and had less than 200 followers.

01:15:39.264 --> 01:15:41.846
He had Cameron, Kyle Seidel, M.D.

01:15:42.707 --> 01:15:50.193
tweet, pinned, talking about how we need and other hospitals could run out of oxygen.

01:15:53.396 --> 01:16:02.744
Talking about thousands of liters of oxygen every day being used in his hospital alone because people are on 60 liters a minute and he showed the machine.

01:16:06.383 --> 01:16:17.588
And so after four and a half years, and four and a half years of wandering around in this cave, suddenly I got a huge breath of fresh air and could see a light brighter than I haven't seen in years.

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:19.909
Because it all came together.

01:16:20.549 --> 01:16:21.890
George Webb was a follower.

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:24.030
Addie Adds was his host.

01:16:25.111 --> 01:16:32.294
The hero and fake doctor, bus rider MD, Paul Cottrell, was a co-host and a co-debater.

01:16:35.327 --> 01:16:54.936
And Robert Malone says that George Webb is one of his arch nemeses and shared the 60 Minutes video of him that got him and Mark Kulak tied together already very early in the pandemic and probably kept Mark very locked into George for a long time because it seemed legitimate if he got on 60 Minutes.

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:09.939
We don't need to fear the free-range RNA molecule, no matter what unusual fear and cleavage site it has, no matter what unusual lies these people tell.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.421
Oh yeah, I don't need that anymore.

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:12.302
Sorry, we were back here.

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:12.743
My bad.

01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:15.646
I almost went right back into the presentation.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:16.587
Here we go.

01:17:17.892 --> 01:17:21.715
Good evening and welcome to another special episode of VSRF Live.

01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:23.496
I'm your host, Livio Sanchez.

01:17:23.816 --> 01:17:26.538
And as always, I'm thrilled to be here with all of you tonight.

01:17:27.178 --> 01:17:29.880
Joining us this evening is Dr. Andrew Kaufman.

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.282
Dr. Kaufman is a self-proclaimed recovering physician.

01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:39.987
He has transitioned from a career in mainstream medicine to becoming a prominent critic of the allopathic medicine paradigm.

01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:47.772
Tonight, we will have a colorful discussion on germ versus terrain theory and whether or not viruses exist and are the cause of illness.

01:17:49.553 --> 01:17:51.253
I want to bring on our very own nurse.

01:17:52.474 --> 01:17:53.134
Welcome, Nurse Angela.

01:17:53.154 --> 01:17:53.894
How are you this evening?

01:17:54.194 --> 01:17:54.815
I'm great, Livio.

01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:55.355
How are you doing?

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:56.335
I'm doing well.

01:17:56.575 --> 01:18:02.377
We talked earlier, and you're here because you have an update on a very special person that you've been really instrumental in helping get care for.

01:18:02.397 --> 01:18:03.858
Can you give us an update on Cody?

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:09.133
Yeah, so unfortunately, I got a phone call last night from Cody's mom, Heather, that Cody was not doing well.

01:18:09.774 --> 01:18:14.555
And for those of you out there who don't know who Cody is, he was 21 years old when he got vaccinated.

01:18:14.635 --> 01:18:15.815
He suffered an immediate reaction.

01:18:16.376 --> 01:18:16.976
He had blood clots.

01:18:17.016 --> 01:18:17.936
He was coughing up blood.

01:18:17.976 --> 01:18:19.176
He had cardiac damage.

01:18:19.196 --> 01:18:21.157
He's been really fighting for his life ever since.

01:18:21.177 --> 01:18:23.758
And it's been a miracle that we still have him here with us.

01:18:23.818 --> 01:18:27.019
He's a really, really tough kid and just super, super sweet.

01:18:27.459 --> 01:18:30.800
And this morning, I got the message that he was admitted to the hospital.

01:18:31.513 --> 01:18:35.435
They are really concerned with a spinal stroke and blood clots on his spine.

01:18:35.495 --> 01:18:38.037
He's really, really in hard shape.

01:18:38.237 --> 01:18:45.101
And so we would like to donate any of the proceeds that we raised tonight for Cody to help out this special family.

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:47.082
We're going to put the link in the chat for his gifts and go.

01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:49.003
It's just really tragic.

01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:53.164
I remember being at Steve's house late fall of last year, and I was with Bobby Kennedy.

01:18:53.184 --> 01:18:55.105
And Bobby Kennedy and I FaceTimed Cody.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:55.745
He was in the hospital.

01:18:56.045 --> 01:18:58.586
He had blood clots in his groin and in his arms, his legs.

01:18:59.047 --> 01:19:01.608
And Bobby Kennedy said to Cody, you know, don't give up.

01:19:01.808 --> 01:19:02.248
Hang in there.

01:19:02.288 --> 01:19:04.509
Just keep on keep on going and we're rooting for you.

01:19:04.989 --> 01:19:05.929
And we'll always fight for you.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:07.470
And Cody is doing just that.

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:08.650
I mean, he is the toughest kid I know.

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.230
He's just fighting and fighting.

01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:21.494
And one of his goals is to recover and get better, even though he has a fatal condition now called antiphospholipid syndrome, which actually my mom developed that as well after her booster that caused blood clots in my mom's eyes.

01:19:21.794 --> 01:19:23.194
But he has been doing exactly that.

01:19:23.234 --> 01:19:25.495
He just wants to get better so that he can be an advocate.

01:19:25.535 --> 01:19:26.835
And he's really, really dear and special.

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:30.256
So if any of you are able to donate, we're going to put the link in the chat.

01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:33.637
And if you donate to our organization, we would prefer it to go directly to the GiveSendGo.

01:19:33.977 --> 01:19:41.443
But if we get any donations in tonight, we are going to donate 100% of that directly to Cody and the family because they're taking care of him 24-7.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.786
He's not able to walk unassisted, and he's in excruciating pain.

01:19:44.806 --> 01:19:50.690
But I did see a picture of him today, and even under the circumstances, the warmth in his heart is overwhelming to me.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:51.931
So help out if you can.

01:19:51.971 --> 01:19:54.794
If you can't, please pray for him, spread the word, share his gifts, and go.

01:19:54.974 --> 01:19:57.516
And we will continue to help take care of these people.

01:19:57.856 --> 01:19:59.517
He's such an incredibly resilient young man.

01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:03.060
His will to live, I've never seen anything like that before.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.681
I don't know if I could do it personally with what he's been through.

01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:13.527
I mean, his mom has actually literally driven him in the back of pickup trucks because they couldn't get him into the car while he's coughing up blood and unable to breathe and white as a ghost.

01:20:13.547 --> 01:20:17.289
And we've almost lost this kid so many times and he's fighting right now as we speak.

01:20:17.349 --> 01:20:21.052
So just lots of love to you, Cody, lots of love to your family and we will help you the best that we can.

01:20:21.508 --> 01:20:23.769
Thank you for all of our viewers out there who, you know, any little bit helps.

01:20:23.809 --> 01:20:25.869
We have, we'll probably have thousands of people watching.

01:20:25.889 --> 01:20:27.769
So even, even just a small little amount goes a long way.

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:27.869
Yeah.

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:34.411
And remember everything for tonight's show, we'll be going to help Cody and his family with their, their medical situation, their medical debt.

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:35.031
Yes.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:35.411
Yes.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:36.031
Well, thank you.

01:20:36.071 --> 01:20:43.073
And at the end of the show, I want to remind everyone, we're going to, you were at, uh, we were together at reawaken America in Detroit last weekend, and I'm going to share a snippet of your speech at the very end of the show tonight.

01:20:43.133 --> 01:20:45.994
So we'll see you again and maybe we'll see you during Q and a. Thank you.

01:20:46.014 --> 01:20:46.214
Thank you.

01:20:46.234 --> 01:20:46.654
Have a great show.

01:20:48.462 --> 01:20:50.403
And now I'm going to just race into Steve Kirsch.

01:20:50.423 --> 01:20:51.985
Let me bring on the founder of VSRF.

01:20:52.185 --> 01:20:53.025
Welcome to VSRF Live.

01:20:53.045 --> 01:20:53.886
Steve, how are you this evening?

01:20:54.466 --> 01:20:55.047
I'm good, Livio.

01:20:55.787 --> 01:20:57.969
I am looking forward to this conversation.

01:20:58.389 --> 01:21:05.454
I was talking to Dr. Kaufman backstage before you came on, and I already learned quite a bit about my own history, so I'm really looking forward to this.

01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:10.438
As am I. Well, let me just bring him on right now without too much jabber.

01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:11.779
Hello, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.

01:21:11.799 --> 01:21:12.860
Welcome to VSRF Live.

01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:15.463
Hello again, Livio, and nice to meet you, Steve.

01:21:15.483 --> 01:21:16.464
Thanks for having me on.

01:21:17.064 --> 01:21:17.824
Thanks for being on.

01:21:18.485 --> 01:21:23.107
I'm going to quickly read your bio so that people that don't know about you get a great understanding, and then I'll leave you and Steve at it.

01:21:23.127 --> 01:21:23.648
So here we go.

01:21:23.988 --> 01:21:27.170
Dr. Andrew Kaufman is a forensic psychiatrist and molecular biologist.

01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:33.113
He became more and more skeptical of the allopathic paradigm until he finally blew germ theory wide open and became a COVID whistleblower.

01:21:33.593 --> 01:21:40.736
Since then, he has been speaking and teaching the truth about medicine, viruses, natural healing, and other important subjects, such as economics, law, education, and science.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:48.940
Dr. Kauffman received his bachelor's of science in biology at Steve's alma mater, MIT, his MD from the University of South Carolina, and did a psychiatric residency at Duke University.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:55.203
Dr. Kauffman has served on medical school faculty, has been a leader in academics and professional organizations, and has conducted and published original research.

01:21:55.403 --> 01:21:58.064
He patented a medical device and ran a startup company.

01:21:58.344 --> 01:22:01.266
He has also testified as an expert witness in local, state, and federal court.

01:22:01.846 --> 01:22:04.169
quite an impressive resume, Dr. Kaufman, thank you for being here.

01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:09.416
And I want to remind our audience, put your questions, all capped questions in the chat, and we will have a Q&A later.

01:22:09.636 --> 01:22:17.346
I can almost guarantee you that the reason why he talked about a startup and technology is because we found that story about him and that

01:22:18.027 --> 01:22:19.267
grant he got in New York.

01:22:19.307 --> 01:22:23.749
So he's got to say something about that picture where he's shaking Andrew Cuomo's hand.

01:22:23.809 --> 01:22:25.269
And so he said it just like that.

01:22:25.309 --> 01:22:26.950
He's never hidden that from anybody.

01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:32.952
I'm very forthcoming in the fourth and a half year in.

01:22:33.012 --> 01:22:34.372
Don't forget, it's 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and we're in 2024.

01:22:34.452 --> 01:22:36.753
These people have been lying to us for almost five years.

01:22:36.793 --> 01:22:37.833
They don't deserve any quarter here.

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.171
They don't get to finally say it right now.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:49.792
Questions for Dr. Kaufman and for Steve.

01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:50.953
Take it away, gentlemen.

01:22:51.513 --> 01:22:51.753
All right.

01:22:51.813 --> 01:22:54.955
Well, first of all, just for time's sake, what's the Dr. Kaufman?

01:22:55.035 --> 01:22:57.016
I think you need to leave in about an hour and a half from now.

01:22:57.056 --> 01:22:57.396
Is that right?

01:22:57.436 --> 01:23:00.098
So we should make sure that we have plenty of room for questions from the audience.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:01.058
Yeah, absolutely.

01:23:01.078 --> 01:23:02.039
That's a good time frame.

01:23:02.079 --> 01:23:03.500
I'm on the East Coast, so it's a little bit later.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.601
OK, so I'm going to try to target.

01:23:09.403 --> 01:23:09.763
Sounds good.

01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:30.656
us believe that there shouldn't be any kind of mask regulations, that masks don't work, that lockdowns weren't effective, that we shouldn't have vaccine mandates, that science was not being done properly, and that there was a lack of autopsies that should have been done when people died from what they claimed is the virus or the vaccine.

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:32.256
Is that fair?

01:23:32.296 --> 01:23:33.177
Yeah, all good points.

01:23:33.597 --> 01:23:34.338
All good points, Steve.

01:23:34.798 --> 01:23:34.938
Good.

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:40.441
And I think we also agree on how science works, that the hypotheticals don't work.

01:23:40.761 --> 01:23:41.922
So I'm going to try to target

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:46.151
Sounds good.

01:23:50.155 --> 01:24:06.948
Us believe that there shouldn't be a mask, any kind of mask regulations that masks don't work, that lockdowns were ineffective, that we shouldn't have vaccine mandates, that science was not being done properly, and that there was a lack of autopsies that should have been done when people died from what they claimed is the virus or the vaccine.

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:26.556
that the virus died from mandates, that science was not being done properly, and that there was a lack of autopsies that should have been done when people died from, science was not being done properly, and that there was a lack of autopsies that should have been done when people died from what they claimed is the virus or the vaccine.

01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:28.410
Is that fair?

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.071
Yeah, all good points.

01:24:29.491 --> 01:24:30.232
All good points, Steve.

01:24:30.252 --> 01:24:30.832
Good.

01:24:31.172 --> 01:24:37.237
And I think we also agree on how science works, that the hypothesis that better explains the data should win at the end of the day.

01:24:38.338 --> 01:24:56.031
Well, it depends on how the data is acquired, Steve, because science, we have to stick to the scientific method and its attributes and what it can be applied towards and separate that from other things purporting to be science, which are really observation or simulation, things like epidemiology, like computer modeling, in vitro studies, things like that.

01:24:56.499 --> 01:25:07.784
Okay, but hard data, it can be collected in a variety of different ways that if you have the proper hypothesis, that you should be able to explain the hard data versus the model data or the artificially created data, right?

01:25:07.824 --> 01:25:14.747
Well, like I'm saying, again, Steve, data has to be generated through a scientific experiment in order to generate a cause and effect relationship.

01:25:15.382 --> 01:25:16.844
You can have data that is worthless.

01:25:16.864 --> 01:25:26.052
Like, for example, when I was at Duke, they made a big announcement while I was in my training that they had found definitive evidence that serotonin receptors are involved in depression.

01:25:26.332 --> 01:25:36.602
And what happened is they had a large data set that was from nursing homes across the country, and they found an anomaly that suggested to them that there was a genetic finding like of a gene for depression.

01:25:37.222 --> 01:25:38.524
And they were really excited.

01:25:38.544 --> 01:25:41.607
There was like a cocktail party, like impromptu in the department.

01:25:41.647 --> 01:25:43.529
It was like people were celebrating like mad.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:46.852
And then two weeks later, I noticed that there was no further talk about it.

01:25:46.872 --> 01:25:52.939
And what had happened is several other groups with similar data sets found out it was just a statistical anomaly because they were data mining.

01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:59.001
and they essentially encountered an anomaly and then misinterpreted it as an actual finding.

01:25:59.862 --> 01:26:16.088
And so here we are in a succinct place where he could say that looking for genes in a population being altered and then calling that a correlation and explanatory for the disease that you're associating it with is ridiculous.

01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:19.910
He used an inordinate amount of words to tell you nothing.

01:26:20.998 --> 01:26:23.299
It's exactly what he did at the Red Pill Conference.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:33.325
He showed slide after slide of the top half of different scientific articles with a sentence or two that was highlighted in the abstract.

01:26:33.385 --> 01:26:42.270
And that's the talk he gave about all these different chemicals that they're putting in our stuff and are making our kids less men and less women or something like that.

01:26:43.911 --> 01:26:45.992
It was the worst talk I've ever seen.

01:26:46.072 --> 01:26:50.315
The idea that they supported or paid for him to do that would be absurd.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:27:06.479
And now here he is, instead of succinctly explaining how science has gone wrong, like somebody like Greg Glassman or Emily Kaplan might do from Broken Science Initiative, or how Gert Gigerenzer did it on the show that we watched together,

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:18.476
the lecture where he explains how probability, if applied the way it's applied, isn't even a testing a model anyway, because they're testing a null hypothesis, which doesn't even test their model of reality.

01:27:19.177 --> 01:27:26.006
And so rather than talking about producing good models of reality, which is what they should be doing with the no virus group,

01:27:27.574 --> 01:27:37.025
He's talking nonsense and saying nothing that will illustrate that he gets the big picture of how science has been corrupted and how it could be used against us.

01:27:37.766 --> 01:27:39.848
And certainly Steve doesn't understand.

01:27:39.868 --> 01:27:41.170
Look how bored he is already.

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:44.393
Boy, he's really excited about the great no virus debate.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.560
Come on, it's already over.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.221
Like this is just a joke to me.

01:27:52.781 --> 01:28:00.983
And then don't forget after this conversation, we're going to have something like this happen where Steve says, Hey Jay.

01:28:01.323 --> 01:28:01.803
Hey Jay.

01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:05.564
Hey, this is Steve Kirsch.

01:28:05.964 --> 01:28:14.126
I've been, uh, engaging in the no virus debates and somebody said, I should talk to you.

01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:14.186
Um,

01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:19.893
And I'm assuming they think that's because you think that viruses don't exist.

01:28:20.934 --> 01:28:25.699
But if you don't believe they exist, I definitely want to talk to you.

01:28:28.181 --> 01:28:28.782
So give me a call.

01:28:28.822 --> 01:28:29.002
Thanks.

01:28:29.608 --> 01:28:33.752
So he has no idea what I think, even though I was on his steering committee for almost half a year.

01:28:33.772 --> 01:28:38.216
He has no idea what I think, even though he's heard me argue with Mark Giordano in his steering committee.

01:28:38.536 --> 01:28:42.080
He has no idea what I think, even though he's heard me present in his steering committee.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.085
He has no idea what I think, even though he showed up at a broken science meeting and was like, what are you doing here?

01:28:48.526 --> 01:28:51.969
Instead of, wow, I get a chance to meet someone from my steering committee in person.

01:28:52.009 --> 01:28:53.350
Let's sit over here and have a drink.

01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:58.735
He walked away from me because Steve Kirsch is a liar and a traitor to America.

01:28:59.096 --> 01:29:03.219
And it's very likely that this guy is too, because who did he talk to?

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:15.110
Steve Kirsch talked to Andy Kaufman, but Andy Kaufman pretended that he didn't know who I was in the O'Hare airport when I was standing right next to him and shook his hand on the plane an hour earlier.

01:29:17.572 --> 01:29:20.615
And then when I finally kind of stared him down, he said, oh, are you JJ?

01:29:22.418 --> 01:29:27.301
And once you hear the name JJ, you know that they've all been at the same table.

01:29:27.741 --> 01:29:31.043
They're all playing the same limited hand of cards.

01:29:32.964 --> 01:29:34.364
It's they don't have anything else.

01:29:41.588 --> 01:29:45.070
I wish I could tell you that I pushed through him or that I bumped him out of the way.

01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:46.971
That's what I imagined I did.

01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:51.834
But I think in retrospect, I just walked extremely close to him and uh,

01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:07.640
The funny thing is, is he sat down on the plane in front of me, one row in front of me next to a friend that I had just made over the course of that weekend.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.901
And I was able to text that friend about Andy while he was talking to him.

01:30:11.921 --> 01:30:16.963
And I was able to hear before we took off that Andy opened with, yeah, have you ever heard of Mark Bailey?

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:27.906
And so my suspicion is, is that Mark Bailey's Farewell to Birology is a legitimate scholarly work.

01:30:30.273 --> 01:30:53.181
And that in order to make sure that that legitimate scholarly work never really had the effect that it should, until the time was right, and it only rewarded the people that it should, when the time was right, these people have cooperated in keeping Mark Bailey behind the scenes, keeping people focused on his, on Bimbo Bailey as, as Mr. Kevin McCarran so, so eloquently,

01:30:54.762 --> 01:31:04.846
named her in 2020, complete with hot dogs in her mouth and the old man and the raccoons video.

01:31:07.166 --> 01:31:18.190
And so they've been steering this attention and the only person that Mark Bailey ever debated on air was when he debated somebody on Tim Truth's podcast.

01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.990
Who did he debate?

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:20.651
Oh yeah, that's right, Kevin McCarron.

01:31:28.131 --> 01:31:29.973
It's all one network of liars.

01:31:30.874 --> 01:31:32.215
The Americans are traitors.

01:31:32.295 --> 01:31:33.796
The foreigners are meddlers.

01:31:34.037 --> 01:31:39.222
It's probably the global network for Palantir and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.

01:31:39.262 --> 01:31:41.104
And that's why they all want to use Twitter.

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:47.930
That's why his VSRF is now live on Twitter, just like CHD is live on Twitter all the time.

01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:51.594
Because Elon Musk is really giving us free speech.

01:31:57.634 --> 01:31:58.074
Liars.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:01.016
Liars.

01:32:01.356 --> 01:32:02.797
All they had was a big set of data.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:06.939
It wasn't data that was from an experiment designed to test a hypothesis of cause and effect.

01:32:06.979 --> 01:32:16.023
It was just kind of data that was for another purpose, for another experiment that they were just put into a big number crunching, you know, software and essentially ran simulations and then came up with false conclusions.

01:32:16.621 --> 01:32:19.182
Okay, so I'm sure we could spend another hour on that topic.

01:32:19.202 --> 01:32:22.883
But just in the interest of moving on, let's just say I don't completely agree with what you're saying.

01:32:23.463 --> 01:32:32.746
I think that data is data and you can, what science should do is interpret that data and assess whether or not that data is going to be reliable or not.

01:32:33.166 --> 01:32:35.066
And that's part of science.

01:32:35.406 --> 01:32:37.147
If we can't stick to the scientific method,

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:40.986
where there's an independent variable, there's a control, there's a dependent variable.

01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:46.749
That's the only way you can essentially ascertain scientifically any cause and effect relationship.

01:32:46.949 --> 01:32:51.571
Okay, so there's where the Broken Science Initiative, I think, can be used to correct the scientific method.

01:32:51.591 --> 01:33:01.415
Yes, the scientific method is hypotheses, and yes, the scientific method has experiments, but what the scientific method is supposed to do is to validate a model of reality.

01:33:02.557 --> 01:33:08.859
your experiment should be to test the model of reality that you are currently operating under.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:14.342
The hypothesis should have some relationship to your model of reality.

01:33:14.382 --> 01:33:27.527
Now, if the hypothesis is really just a straw man called the null hypothesis and your experiment is designed to disprove the null hypothesis, then you're not doing real exploration into new knowledge.

01:33:28.905 --> 01:33:32.487
And these guys are not gonna bring anybody to understand that subtlety.

01:33:32.527 --> 01:33:40.391
They're going to talk and talk and talk about the usual things, the independent variable, the control and whatever.

01:33:40.931 --> 01:33:55.678
If the experiment is designed stupidly, that the control and the independent variable and the experimental variable or whatever terms you wanna use for these things are irrelevant to testing your model of reality, then you're not doing science.

01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:10.243
And so if looking for seroprevalence doesn't test the reality of whether or not the virus is causing disease, then goodness sakes, don't forget everybody, sign up for the Brownstone event.

01:34:10.463 --> 01:34:11.785
It's at the beginning of November.

01:34:11.825 --> 01:34:13.226
I think it's the first and the second.

01:34:13.606 --> 01:34:15.207
It might be a Friday and a Saturday.

01:34:16.168 --> 01:34:17.449
I'm definitely gonna be there.

01:34:17.749 --> 01:34:21.172
I think Jessica Hockett's gonna go and Nick Hudson's gonna come.

01:34:21.212 --> 01:34:24.755
And so it could be a really, really cool showing for the good people.

01:34:26.176 --> 01:34:29.961
And I hope I can convince some other people to show up, but I don't know yet.

01:34:31.202 --> 01:34:40.253
And worst case scenario, I'll be across the street with a small card table that says the Clownstone is a controlled op, prove me wrong.

01:34:40.293 --> 01:34:42.596
And so in that case, it might be even better to come

01:34:43.123 --> 01:34:47.166
to Pittsburgh for the brownstone than if the brownstone just lets me show up.

01:34:47.286 --> 01:34:48.527
So let's get going with this.

01:34:49.148 --> 01:34:51.970
OK, well, like I said, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on that.

01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:56.694
But I mean, this is the scientific method is well published and agreed upon throughout the world of science.

01:34:56.734 --> 01:34:58.576
So if you disagree with that, I don't know what we could talk about.

01:34:59.697 --> 01:35:01.478
Oh, OK, so let me give you an example.

01:35:02.279 --> 01:35:07.282
I claim that if you take a golf club and you hit a golf ball, that the club is actually causing the golf ball to move.

01:35:07.322 --> 01:35:10.204
And it's the contact with the club that causes the golf ball to move.

01:35:10.425 --> 01:35:16.609
And it's not the air of the golf club that causes the ball to move ahead of the club hitting the ball.

01:35:19.985 --> 01:35:26.767
I don't believe that I need to do a randomized control trial in order to figure stuff like that out.

01:35:26.867 --> 01:35:30.908
Or if I jump out of a plane with a parachute and the parachute doesn't work, will I die or not?

01:35:32.688 --> 01:35:37.370
We don't need to do a randomized double-blind trial on jumping out with or without a parachute.

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:39.350
Well, two things.

01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:44.752
One, a randomized double-blind trial is not necessarily a scientific experiment because it's not designed to

01:35:46.092 --> 01:35:48.795
to highlight or prove a cause and effect relationship in nature.

01:35:48.835 --> 01:35:50.837
It's done for pharmaceuticals, which are man-made.

01:35:51.317 --> 01:36:05.472
But the other thing is there, you could actually, I mean, of course, I agree, you don't need to necessarily do an experiment to see if the club is moving the ball, but you could do an experiment, right, where you could swing just air, and you could swing the club, and the club would be the independent variable.

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:07.853
and the dependent variable would be the motion of the ball.

01:36:08.533 --> 01:36:10.973
And the control would be swinging air instead of swinging the club.

01:36:11.013 --> 01:36:19.635
So when you're talking about invisible things, you do need to very carefully design and perform these experiments, because it's not so obvious as observing someone swinging a golf club.

01:36:19.835 --> 01:36:22.676
Okay, so you're saying that all... Make it stop!

01:36:22.856 --> 01:36:26.697
...completely useless because you couldn't control anything in the environment that you're observing.

01:36:26.877 --> 01:36:27.397
You had to take the

01:36:27.717 --> 01:36:31.318
the data that you were given, and you didn't control for that.

01:36:32.338 --> 01:36:38.480
You control for it after the fact, or you try to control for it after the fact, but you're saying that observational studies are junk.

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:38.820
Is that?

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.440
No, I'm not saying they're junk.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.142
I'm just saying they're not science, because you can't make any cause and effect conclusion.

01:36:46.182 --> 01:36:47.102
Let me just finish.

01:36:47.442 --> 01:36:51.744
Observational data, like epidemiology, is only useful to generate hypotheses.

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:52.684
You can't conclude anything.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:56.885
If you can conclude things from that, then you're basically saying that causation equals association.

01:36:58.371 --> 01:37:04.594
OK, well, like I said, so this is the paparian view of science, that the only way you learn things is you can't really learn things.

01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:06.315
So you just have to falsify things.

01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:13.719
And that that sort of thing where, OK, you have lots of observations, but you still haven't learned anything.

01:37:14.983 --> 01:37:22.025
It presupposes a whole level of understanding that, again, is how science has crippled us.

01:37:22.745 --> 01:37:37.089
Because scientists first have to discard and admit that they don't know anything, and then they're allowed to specialize in knowing something very, very, so very thin, and then have to regularly submit to the admission that they don't know anything else.

01:37:39.557 --> 01:37:44.466
And in a very similar way, he's kind of reinforcing that idea by saying that, what did he say?

01:37:44.506 --> 01:37:48.994
We can't, we can't really know anything just because we have a bunch of observations.

01:37:50.675 --> 01:37:57.559
You control for it after the fact, or you try to control for it after the fact, but you're saying that observational studies are junk.

01:37:57.679 --> 01:37:57.899
Is that?

01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.520
No, I'm not saying they're junk.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.203
I'm just saying they're not science because you can't make any cause and effect conclusion.

01:38:05.523 --> 01:38:06.164
Let me just finish.

01:38:06.504 --> 01:38:10.826
Observational data like epidemiology is only useful to generate hypotheses.

01:38:10.846 --> 01:38:11.747
You can't conclude anything.

01:38:11.807 --> 01:38:15.949
If you can conclude things from that, then you're basically saying that causation equals association.

01:38:17.352 --> 01:38:26.296
OK, well, like I said, we could spend a lot of time going down this particular topic, but I really want to focus on what you're about here with whether viruses exist or not.

01:38:26.336 --> 01:38:30.017
So I think we just need to table this, because otherwise we're just not going to get anywhere in this call.

01:38:30.457 --> 01:38:37.580
Well, this is the framework for this discussion, Steve, because we're going to talk about a scientific claim of cause and effect of a natural phenomenon.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.582
And so you can only get to the answer of that using the scientific method.

01:38:41.602 --> 01:38:43.883
You can't get to that answer with epidemiological data.

01:38:44.163 --> 01:38:46.424
And any epidemiologist will also admit that.

01:38:46.897 --> 01:38:50.699
OK, well, let's just move on, and maybe we can go back to this point if we need to.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.983
But would you agree with me that science, if you should have repeatable results, they should be explainable by your theory?

01:38:57.003 --> 01:39:00.866
For example, gravity has been replicated in a number of different locations all over the world.

01:39:01.426 --> 01:39:05.508
Things don't fall to Earth and accelerate any faster than gravity or any less fast than gravity at all.

01:39:05.528 --> 01:39:13.053
It accelerates at the rate of gravity, and people have observed that all over the world with mostly millions of observations.

01:39:13.633 --> 01:39:15.895
Would you accept that gravity is a scientific fact?

01:39:16.724 --> 01:39:19.867
Well, you can observe gravity, it's a fact of nature, but nobody knows what causes it.

01:39:21.089 --> 01:39:21.789
I didn't, I didn't ask that.

01:39:21.809 --> 01:39:29.057
I'm just saying that, that the, that if I release an object, it's going to go and fall and to accelerate, uh, at the, the, the gravitational force is going to accelerate that object.

01:39:29.257 --> 01:39:31.659
Uh, when I draw, you know, I mean, of course it has predictable behavior.

01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:35.083
There are equations you can apply and predict it, you know, with some degree of error, but fairly accurately.

01:39:35.103 --> 01:39:39.087
Uh, no, I don't, I don't debate that, but you know, once again, that's not a cause and effect relationship.

01:39:40.989 --> 01:39:46.711
Okay, well, I'm going to move on to the next point, which is that we would agree that all scientists should be open to public challenge, right?

01:39:47.531 --> 01:39:52.632
If you say something that you should be open to being challenged by your peers on what you say, would you agree with that?

01:39:53.193 --> 01:39:55.653
The main principle of science is falsifiability.

01:39:56.013 --> 01:39:58.054
So it's necessary for science, not just permissible.

01:39:59.212 --> 01:40:06.257
So you agree with me that people should be open, whether people agree with you or disagree with you, that you should be able to challenge them publicly and they should be able to challenge you publicly.

01:40:06.477 --> 01:40:11.902
Well, I mean, if you participate in a public discourse, you're always open to challenge, but I'm not going to say what people should and shouldn't do.

01:40:12.262 --> 01:40:16.805
But I will say that if you're serious about science, then a scientific hypothesis or theory has to be falsifiable.

01:40:16.845 --> 01:40:19.267
That's one of the standard principles that defines it as scientific.

01:40:19.687 --> 01:40:19.827
Right.

01:40:20.388 --> 01:40:21.589
And the goal is to seek truth, right?

01:40:22.551 --> 01:40:23.191
Well, that's my goal.

01:40:24.212 --> 01:40:26.473
I mean, I would hope a lot of people that do sign.

01:40:27.034 --> 01:40:30.896
So the theory has to be falsifiable, right?

01:40:32.317 --> 01:40:35.319
So the theory has to be falsifiable.

01:40:35.359 --> 01:40:37.741
So what we're talking about is the null hypothesis.

01:40:40.362 --> 01:40:44.385
And so their null hypothesis is that viruses don't exist.

01:40:45.866 --> 01:40:45.986
And

01:40:47.952 --> 01:40:52.756
Now, I'm not gonna say this correctly, probably, because it is actually such a contorted argument.

01:40:53.496 --> 01:41:08.989
Because remember, they're gonna play semantic games, and viruses are defined by virology, and they have not sufficiently justified their description based on experimental data.

01:41:09.009 --> 01:41:13.972
They've got a lot of inferences, they've got a lot of hand-waving, and a lot of assumptions, and I totally agree.

01:41:14.973 --> 01:41:17.015
The question is, what are the assumptions?

01:41:18.206 --> 01:41:20.107
And what is your model of the real world?

01:41:21.188 --> 01:41:39.202
Because if your model of the real world is that there is no signal at this size scale, that there's no RNA and DNA that could be misconstrued as being something other than it is, like a virus versus something else, but they're saying there's nothing there, then it's an argument that can never win.

01:41:40.122 --> 01:41:42.024
Because molecular biology is real.

01:41:42.104 --> 01:41:43.525
It might be flawed, but it's real.

01:41:44.994 --> 01:41:57.198
and the ways that we know how to apply it, the way that we know how to use it for synthetic sequencing, synthetic DNA, synthetic sequences being produced in large quantities by vats of bacteria.

01:41:57.238 --> 01:42:06.361
These things work and we understand to what extent they work and how high fidelity they are because we make proteins using these processes all the time.

01:42:09.485 --> 01:42:24.826
And so there's a very high fidelity understanding of certain aspects of molecular biology, which means that we're going to have to have a pretty nuanced understanding of how virology could be a hoax, while in the context of molecular biology appear to be real.

01:42:27.389 --> 01:42:55.571
And that is the goal of GigaOM Biological, and anybody that would really be wanting to save our children, is that you've got to explain how it is that we can have such a high-fidelity understanding that someone like Kevin McKernan and his brothers and his dad could have built multi-generational wealth based on real science, but also been a part of an operation to mislead us about the fidelity of that science and its implications for our understanding ourselves.

01:42:57.813 --> 01:43:05.184
versus being able to just make stuff happen in certain contexts, in certain controlled conditions with some level of predictability.

01:43:07.307 --> 01:43:13.236
And that virology is probably one aspect of that, where with transfection and transformation in certain conditions,

01:43:14.249 --> 01:43:29.413
in certain methodologies results in what appears to be kind of some kind of virology where things are packaged and you can move it around and they don't really understand it, but they would like us to believe that this is evidence of pathogenic RNA and DNA molecules.

01:43:31.973 --> 01:43:42.696
And so it's gonna be extraordinary that they've had four and a half years to hone their message and get the elevator pitch down to two minutes where, you know, even a gas station attendant can understand it.

01:43:43.096 --> 01:43:43.796
And where are they?

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:49.226
Take it away, Andy.

01:43:49.446 --> 01:43:53.569
Their goal is to be rich and famous, maybe, or some other purpose than, you know, finding the truth.

01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:54.310
Right.

01:43:55.211 --> 01:44:08.802
Okay, so, and we also agree that there are scientific procedures, such as the PCR test, that have design centers for the tests, and they're designed to be used in a certain way on a certain thing, so if you use them improperly, you can get results that are nonsensical.

01:44:09.342 --> 01:44:10.463
So, let me give you an example.

01:44:11.604 --> 01:44:13.486
But the test could never be fraudulent.

01:44:14.775 --> 01:44:20.019
The test could never be fraudulent in terms of their fidelity or representing a background to spread.

01:44:20.899 --> 01:44:24.182
These are not even, excuse me, I'm eating M&Ms.

01:44:25.082 --> 01:44:39.092
These are not even on his radar, even though I was in his steering committee and explained to him how a background signal misconstrued as spread by a bunch of people who just made bullshit tests could be enough to create a pandemic.

01:44:39.132 --> 01:44:41.634
And they don't even seem to acknowledge that it's not

01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:45.491
The misuse of testing, it's just lying.

01:44:46.532 --> 01:44:50.974
It's just making a false test and claiming that it works because the FDA didn't look at data.

01:44:52.114 --> 01:44:59.238
The FDA didn't look at data for not one single EUA, not one gel, not one PCR curve, nothing.

01:44:59.258 --> 01:45:06.421
They weren't required for the EUA that Kevin McKernan on the 24th of April, 2020 was on the Vance Crowe podcast to bitch about.

01:45:07.602 --> 01:45:12.985
that the FDA needed to get out of its way with its 10 pages of paperwork for an EUA.

01:45:13.045 --> 01:45:15.426
Holy shit, it's holding us back and killing people.

01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:31.856
So they can't see, these guys can't see that the virology narrative was propped up by people that just needed to do fake tests or understand the background and then fake pretend that they were just finding it.

01:45:34.178 --> 01:45:45.815
And I tried to give them these arguments for three years and they won't listen, not the no virus people and not the gain of function virus people because that's not where we're supposed to be yet in the slave narrative.

01:45:46.616 --> 01:45:48.517
for the slavers who they work for.

01:45:48.897 --> 01:46:04.982
We would agree that a PCR, that's a lateral flow assay test that is designed to detect whether a human being is infected with SARS-CoV-2 may in fact have a false positive if it was given a papaya or something else, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the test is invalid.

01:46:05.002 --> 01:46:13.005
It's just, it means that you did not use the test in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations because the test was designed with certain limitations in terms of how it should be used.

01:46:14.036 --> 01:46:19.159
Well, I don't think really we should be discussing tests because tests apply, you know, to something that's already established.

01:46:19.179 --> 01:46:23.882
But what I would say is that a test... Tests apply to something that's already established?

01:46:25.143 --> 01:46:25.363
What?

01:46:26.384 --> 01:46:28.285
I'm sorry, Claire Craig, what did you say?

01:46:30.987 --> 01:46:32.848
Is he seriously gonna drop this ball?

01:46:34.689 --> 01:46:40.073
Steve Kersh just put a tee, a ball on the tee, and then he's put his face right in front of it and says, swing.

01:46:40.513 --> 01:46:41.534
And now he's gonna miss?

01:46:43.502 --> 01:46:43.962
Whoa.

01:46:44.443 --> 01:46:45.743
You can't presume a test is valid.

01:46:45.803 --> 01:46:47.804
You have to actually validate the test first.

01:46:48.325 --> 01:47:03.353
So if you were to validate a test, for example, that was going to diagnose someone with an illness caused by a virus per se, well, then you'd have to do a validation study where you have a population of people with that viral illness and other people that either have an illness that's not.

01:47:04.174 --> 01:47:08.076
So are you telling me that his argument is that the PCR tests were not validated?

01:47:11.454 --> 01:47:15.556
Is that a complicated way of saying they're lying or a complicated way?

01:47:15.876 --> 01:47:16.957
What is he doing here?

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:19.098
Viral and people who are healthy probably as well.

01:47:19.578 --> 01:47:29.163
And then you have to be able to find the virus directly in the people who are sick and look for it and all the other people to make sure you don't find it and then do the test that you're proposing in all those people.

01:47:29.203 --> 01:47:33.245
And then that's how you actually calculate those error rates, which, you know, like false positive, false negative.

01:47:33.789 --> 01:47:37.491
and any other types of errors from that.

01:47:37.511 --> 01:47:41.934
But for all the COVID tests, they didn't have to be validated because of emergency use authorizations.

01:47:42.514 --> 01:47:44.695
So those things were never done, those studies.

01:47:44.735 --> 01:47:46.036
Right, but that wasn't my question.

01:47:46.256 --> 01:47:47.077
You didn't answer my question.

01:47:47.297 --> 01:47:48.858
Okay, so maybe he got that right.

01:47:48.878 --> 01:47:51.699
He said that they weren't validated because the EUAs didn't require it.

01:47:51.739 --> 01:47:53.500
And as he's right, they could just lie about it.

01:47:54.261 --> 01:47:55.801
But the EUAs did require it.

01:47:56.702 --> 01:48:01.925
So somebody at the FDA could say very easily, no, no, we required it, we asked for the summary.

01:48:03.413 --> 01:48:09.836
And all of these people provided a summary of the controls that they did and the control reagents that they used.

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:12.097
And they provided a summary of the results.

01:48:12.878 --> 01:48:15.999
Negative, negative, negative, negative, negative, positive, positive, positive.

01:48:16.059 --> 01:48:16.660
See, it works.

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:24.804
And so the FDA has plausible deniability because they required people to fill out 10 pages of paperwork Kevin McKernan told us in April.

01:48:26.925 --> 01:48:30.847
And so already it seems to me that the reader on the left side

01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:40.343
is actually putting out a narrative that can be easily debunked by anybody on the far end of the TV narrative spectrum by just saying, what are you talking about?

01:48:40.823 --> 01:48:48.268
You can look at any FDA EUA document and see that they were required to do positive and negative controls and report the results.

01:48:49.268 --> 01:48:51.429
They weren't required to show the results.

01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:53.831
They were required to report the results.

01:48:53.871 --> 01:49:00.895
So what he said there was technically wrong, which is extraordinary if you think about it after four and a half years, he still doesn't have it right.

01:49:02.947 --> 01:49:04.114
Unless you think he's a meddler.

01:49:09.239 --> 01:49:15.102
I thought you were saying we agree on that that test could be misleading if the procedure is not followed.

01:49:15.762 --> 01:49:16.103
Correct.

01:49:16.543 --> 01:49:28.529
So if you go and you use a PCR or a lateral flow assay test to assess a human being that if it's used to that if you take a lemon and squeeze it on the lateral flow assay test and you get a bar on it that that's meaningless because the test was not designed to be used.

01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:33.912
How is it possible that we're still talking about this bullshit when this was supposed to be the great no virus debate?

01:49:34.904 --> 01:49:35.345
in that way.

01:49:35.765 --> 01:49:41.670
I'm not asking you whether the lateral flow assay test works.

01:49:41.991 --> 01:49:44.953
I'm not asking you whether it's valid or anything else.

01:49:45.013 --> 01:49:59.987
I'm just saying that, would you agree with me that if a test is used in a way that it was not designed to be used, such as trying to use a PCR test or a lateral flow assay test on squeezing a lemon, that it's perfectly reasonable that you could get nonsensical results.

01:50:00.007 --> 01:50:00.548
Would you agree with that?

01:50:01.257 --> 01:50:06.560
Well, Steve, I'm not really sure why you're asking this kind of a strange question, but let's say you had a pregnancy test and instead of peeing on it, you licked it.

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:10.002
I wouldn't expect you to get an accurate result if you did that.

01:50:10.042 --> 01:50:10.482
That's correct.

01:50:10.522 --> 01:50:13.744
But a pregnancy test has already been validated in a sample.

01:50:14.004 --> 01:50:22.969
So what's happening here, in my humble opinion, is that a few people are going to leave Steve Kirsch's clown show and turn to the no virus guy here.

01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:26.071
And they risk nothing by doing that.

01:50:27.062 --> 01:50:31.445
by making Steve look a little dumb and making Andy Kaufman look a little smart.

01:50:33.967 --> 01:50:36.508
But this is laughable to me.

01:50:36.628 --> 01:50:37.089
Population.

01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:41.712
No, I'm just saying that if you looked on a pregnancy test, you should not pay attention to the results.

01:50:42.452 --> 01:50:43.233
I think we agree on that, right?

01:50:44.414 --> 01:50:44.594
Yeah.

01:50:44.694 --> 01:50:48.937
I mean, you know, I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to, I wouldn't advise it.

01:50:48.957 --> 01:50:49.137
Yeah.

01:50:49.457 --> 01:50:49.677
Okay.

01:50:49.797 --> 01:50:49.997
All right.

01:50:50.017 --> 01:50:50.157
Great.

01:50:50.818 --> 01:51:03.845
And then I want to mention before we get started here into the specific questions, if this is not my area of expertise, genomic sequencing, I admit it front that I could probably ask questions that may be nonsensical or make mistakes just because I do not claim to be an expert in gene sequencing and you know that.

01:51:04.925 --> 01:51:06.586
Well, I'm not an expert in gene sequencing either.

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:07.307
Okay.

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:07.427
Great.

01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:09.800
Great.

01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:13.642
So let's start off with just real simple softball questions just to get this going here.

01:51:13.842 --> 01:51:16.123
So your name is Andrew Russell Kaufman, M.D.

01:51:16.163 --> 01:51:16.643
Is that correct?

01:51:17.244 --> 01:51:17.744
Is it yes or no?

01:51:17.764 --> 01:51:18.504
Well, I wouldn't say M.D.

01:51:18.544 --> 01:51:19.165
is part of my name.

01:51:19.485 --> 01:51:28.649
Okay, but your middle name is Russell, just to make sure that we have the... I can tell you for sure that Andrew Russell is my name, but it would only be hearsay that Kaufman is my last name.

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:31.411
I have no direct first-hand knowledge, but I go by it.

01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:32.111
Okay.

01:51:32.311 --> 01:51:34.132
And have you published papers in genomics?

01:51:34.172 --> 01:51:37.154
Have you published any papers about your theories about... What does that mean?

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:39.171
What does that mean?

01:51:39.211 --> 01:51:39.751
What is that?

01:51:40.491 --> 01:51:43.413
He has no firsthand knowledge that his name is Kaufman.

01:51:43.494 --> 01:51:45.455
Are we playing games here?

01:51:45.515 --> 01:51:46.235
What is going on?

01:51:47.997 --> 01:51:48.137
Great.

01:51:48.177 --> 01:51:51.959
So let's start off with just real simple softball questions just to get this going here.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.281
So your name is Andrew Russell Kaufman, MD.

01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:54.941
Is that correct?

01:51:55.522 --> 01:51:56.042
Is it yes or no?

01:51:56.062 --> 01:51:57.463
Well, I wouldn't say MD is part of my name.

01:51:57.743 --> 01:52:06.910
OK, but your middle name is Russell, just to make sure that we have the- I can tell you for sure that Andrew Russell or my name, but it would only be hearsay that Kaufman is my last name.

01:52:07.526 --> 01:52:09.647
I have no direct first-hand knowledge, but I go by it.

01:52:10.207 --> 01:52:10.387
Okay.

01:52:10.587 --> 01:52:12.407
And have you published papers in genomics?

01:52:12.427 --> 01:52:18.369
Have you published any papers about your theories about whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus exists?

01:52:18.489 --> 01:52:20.150
Are there any papers either on a preprint server?

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:25.131
Are there any published papers or even unpublished papers that people would want to take a look at?

01:52:26.312 --> 01:52:35.134
Well, there's a paper I wrote with Tom Cowan on my website, but there's a very, very low likelihood that any journal would publish any paper that I would write on this topic.

01:52:35.174 --> 01:52:37.195
Because if you look at some of the other attempts at publication,

01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:45.199
even in much, much less controversial areas, like the Dutch group who actually did a randomized control trial of masks during COVID.

01:52:45.639 --> 01:52:50.485
They had to basically violate statistics 101 to get their paper published after three rejections.

01:52:50.525 --> 01:52:54.390
So that would be kind of a fool's errand in my opinion, so I never pursued that.

01:52:54.898 --> 01:52:55.018
Right.

01:52:55.359 --> 01:52:56.159
No, I get that.

01:52:56.199 --> 01:53:01.966
But you have a paper that's available on your site that people can read that explains how all this works and what your theories are.

01:53:02.466 --> 01:53:06.911
Well, it only specifically talks about isolation experiments and electron microscopy.

01:53:06.951 --> 01:53:08.292
But yes, it gives the basic ideas.

01:53:08.312 --> 01:53:15.380
But I have lots of published lectures like slideshow type lectures that explain all the arguments and even a documentary film.

01:53:15.816 --> 01:53:18.259
Okay, so people can go to your website and you want to give us the URL for that?

01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.862
Yeah, it's just AndrewKaufmanMD.com.

01:53:21.303 --> 01:53:21.463
Great.

01:53:21.623 --> 01:53:21.903
Awesome.

01:53:22.003 --> 01:53:22.604
Easy to remember.

01:53:22.945 --> 01:53:29.993
Okay, so let's get into the key question here, which is, I believe that I've seen the Dell BigTree interview.

01:53:30.013 --> 01:53:32.136
I saw the excerpt that

01:53:33.357 --> 01:53:38.060
I debunked the funk posted to the web, where you're answering some questions.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:44.584
So I'm, I tried to do my homework, and it appears that you claim that and so you can correct me if I'm wrong but my.

01:53:45.184 --> 01:53:49.847
I'm trying to summarize that it appears that your opinion is that coven.

01:53:50.487 --> 01:53:59.109
sorry, that SARS-CoV-2, the virus, isn't in fact a virus, that it's an exosome causing this, that SARS-CoV-2 doesn't exist.

01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:08.052
And so I believe I got that part right, but I wanted to make sure that we're crystal clear on the second question, which is, do you believe that any viruses exist?

01:54:08.652 --> 01:54:10.494
Do you believe that the measles virus exists?

01:54:10.534 --> 01:54:12.055
Do you believe that smallpox virus exists?

01:54:12.075 --> 01:54:16.799
Do you believe the polio virus or polio myelitis virus exists?

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.902
Or do you think that there is no such thing as a virus?

01:54:20.042 --> 01:54:22.425
So let's just start with SARS-CoV-2 just to make sure that I got that right.

01:54:22.645 --> 01:54:28.190
And then if you can answer clearly the second question as to whether you think any virus exists, and if so, then which ones?

01:54:29.025 --> 01:54:29.365
Yeah, sure.

01:54:29.945 --> 01:54:32.006
So you're partially correct.

01:54:32.026 --> 01:54:33.707
You're in the ballpark on about SARS-CoV-2.

01:54:33.747 --> 01:54:35.167
I tried.

01:54:35.227 --> 01:54:42.210
Basically, what I've said is that the claims put forth that this virus exists and is causing disease are baseless.

01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:50.272
If you actually look at the published studies which assert those alleged facts, they did not meet the bar for proving anything or demonstrating everything.

01:54:50.292 --> 01:54:51.953
And we can, of course, talk about that in detail.

01:54:52.653 --> 01:54:58.018
And, you know, in my journey of discovering this, of course, I looked at many other alleged pathological viruses, right?

01:54:58.039 --> 01:55:01.582
Those are alleged viruses that are said to cause disease, like you mentioned a number of them.

01:55:02.122 --> 01:55:06.226
And I haven't personally looked into every single virus that's in, you know, a microbiology textbook.

01:55:06.887 --> 01:55:09.589
But I've looked into all the ones you mentioned and several more.

01:55:09.609 --> 01:55:14.434
And then some of my colleagues who also have examined the same material and have similar conclusions, they've looked at the rest.

01:55:14.914 --> 01:55:17.557
So there's a large body of work out there.

01:55:18.178 --> 01:55:23.902
some of it in written form in papers and blogs, and a lot of it in video form about all of those different viruses.

01:55:24.322 --> 01:55:32.088
So in terms of viruses that are alleged to cause disease in humans, I haven't found any prima facie evidence that any of them actually exist in the real world.

01:55:32.468 --> 01:55:47.039
There are other nanoscale particles that are real, that live within microorganisms, like for example, bacteriophages, which are often compared to viruses, but those, they're able to actually demonstrate their existence in reality.

01:55:47.879 --> 01:55:51.486
Okay, so you agree that bacteriophages do exist.

01:55:56.001 --> 01:55:57.502
We have bacteria all over us.

01:55:57.662 --> 01:55:59.403
We have bacteria all around us.

01:56:00.143 --> 01:56:01.584
And bacteriophages exist.

01:56:01.624 --> 01:56:09.768
So if you accept all of those things, then you already accept that there is an infinite background of RNA and DNA potentially out there and surrounding us.

01:56:09.888 --> 01:56:17.612
And that's why when you put a collector of these signals on the top of a mountain in Spain, you collect millions of viruses every month.

01:56:20.339 --> 01:56:26.583
A lot of them are bacteriophages, but they all have DNA or RNA in them, and RNA and DNA is what you test for in PCR.

01:56:27.964 --> 01:56:44.455
A replicating DNA or RNA that was replicating in the microbiome of your lungs, or the microbiome of your mucosal, in your lungs and throat, or in your saliva, in your mouth, or in the microbiome of your gut, would be a replicating DNA or RNA, would it not?

01:56:47.731 --> 01:57:02.163
And so very, very quickly, the nuanced level of discussion necessary to explain how a background signal of genetics from all over the living world could be misconstrued as a signal with almost nothing there.

01:57:02.223 --> 01:57:03.264
It's just all signal.

01:57:03.284 --> 01:57:04.525
There's no noise at all.

01:57:05.306 --> 01:57:11.171
We can just pull this one RNA right off the background because it's such a clean chalkboard.

01:57:14.178 --> 01:57:21.587
And so again, are they gonna manage to explain the conundrum succinctly enough so that anyone can understand it?

01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:24.551
Of course they're not.

01:57:24.571 --> 01:57:30.458
They do infect bacteria.

01:57:30.882 --> 01:57:39.225
Well, their actual role in the bacterial culture is not nearly as clear cut, but they definitely exist because you can find lots of studies where they're purified.

01:57:39.265 --> 01:57:47.128
And the only thing you see on a microscope image is identical, very uniquely shaped particles that, you know, it's obvious that it's one thing you're looking at.

01:57:47.368 --> 01:57:52.550
And so then they can also purify things that look like what people have called viruses, but they're really not.

01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:58.452
They're just lipid bound particles that often have genetic signals inside of them.

01:58:00.054 --> 01:58:08.700
We don't even know if these particles that they call retroviruses and these other viruses like flu viruses that are supposed to have an enzyme in every particle.

01:58:10.282 --> 01:58:12.784
And they certainly haven't demonstrated that.

01:58:13.663 --> 01:58:29.613
You can demonstrate the presence of an enzyme in a dish, but you can't demonstrate that an enzyme is actually inside of a lipid particle next to an RNA or a DNA molecule and show that it's all one thing with a combination of labels and microscopy.

01:58:29.653 --> 01:58:30.534
You can't do that.

01:58:33.752 --> 01:58:44.175
And so is he going to explain that it's at the limit of our ability to detect and the limit of our ability to label for them to claim that they understand it with the fidelity that they claim?

01:58:44.535 --> 01:58:45.316
It's impossible.

01:58:45.356 --> 01:58:49.117
We can't visualize things that small and in that close of proximity.

01:58:51.397 --> 01:58:52.558
Well, he's not a virologist.

01:58:52.598 --> 01:58:54.038
He's not an expert on sequencing.

01:58:54.078 --> 01:58:59.360
He's never probably used a high powered microscope before, but he's got a paper about electron microscopy.

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:26.697
Posers ladies and gentlemen posing from the very very beginning Promoting each other as rivals from the very very beginning That's why Kevin McCarran knew his name and that's why Andy Kaufman is now on Steve Kirsch's podcast because it's all one big traitorous show

01:59:27.219 --> 01:59:27.419
Okay.

01:59:27.439 --> 01:59:36.928
But, but, but as far as you're concerned, you do not believe that, that viruses exist, or you have not seen any conclusive proof that, uh, that viruses exist, even though bacteriophages exist.

01:59:37.328 --> 01:59:37.649
Correct.

01:59:38.549 --> 01:59:39.851
The ones that are alleged to cause disease.

01:59:40.211 --> 01:59:40.391
Okay.

01:59:40.411 --> 01:59:46.237
So, so that's interesting because if you were to, uh, look up bacteriophages, uh, you would find that they're considered to be viruses.

01:59:47.518 --> 01:59:47.718
Yes.

01:59:47.738 --> 01:59:51.982
Well, that's why I'm, that's why I'm kind of specifying what I've looked at because

01:59:52.389 --> 01:59:59.012
You could call them that, but the functional definition of virus hasn't been fully established for bacteriophages either.

01:59:59.613 --> 02:00:01.554
But they definitely can demonstrate that they're real.

02:00:02.254 --> 02:00:08.297
Okay, so we're talking about nomenclature that in, bacteriophages exist, they do infect bacteria.

02:00:08.317 --> 02:00:11.799
No, no, no, I'm saying that there's no evidence that they infect bacteria.

02:00:11.819 --> 02:00:17.642
They're present in bacterial cultures under very stressful conditions in a pure bacterial culture, which is not a natural setting.

02:00:17.942 --> 02:00:20.824
But there's no experiments that show that they cause an infection

02:00:21.224 --> 02:00:21.824
two bacteria.

02:00:21.884 --> 02:00:26.926
Okay, then we'll get into to this more later, but I just want to kind of establish your position.

02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:44.313
So essentially, you're saying that, from your point of view, you're not convinced that any virus exists, that they may, you could, you would probably say that it's possible that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could exist, it's possible that the measles virus could exist, but from your perspective, you haven't been scientifically convinced that these viruses do exist.

02:00:44.373 --> 02:00:45.994
Is that, would that be fair characterization?

02:00:46.014 --> 02:00:48.375
Yeah, there's just not sufficient evidence to demonstrate their existence.

02:00:48.755 --> 02:00:49.715
Great, okay.

02:00:50.095 --> 02:00:53.157
I'm gonna start off with a bunch of short questions, softball questions.

02:00:53.217 --> 02:00:56.698
Hopefully I can get a quick answer on these, because they should be yes or no questions.

02:00:57.438 --> 02:01:03.600
I saw this video that was posted by Debunk the Funk three years ago on YouTube, where Tom asked you a question.

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:14.464
Why in the world would this guy waste any time saying the second time in a row now, debunk the funk, unless it was all the same network of people?

02:01:18.015 --> 02:01:34.768
Why in the world would they waste their time saying his name out loud, knowing that he just did a stream with Zuby, who's been on Rogan, who's been on Weinstein, who's been promoted by this guy on VRSF.

02:01:35.929 --> 02:01:39.632
It's all one cozy little anti-American group.

02:01:41.232 --> 02:01:44.053
Traitors and foreign meddlers all working together.

02:01:44.073 --> 02:02:02.498
And that's why Jay Bhattacharya is doing a podcast and a sub stack with a Canadian that Brett Weinstein promoted instead of somebody like me, that he's met four times in person at the Broken Science Initiative meetings and always told me that you're the greatest, but I can't evaluate your biology because I'm an economist.

02:02:03.858 --> 02:02:06.099
Traitors and liars.

02:02:09.497 --> 02:02:11.017
Here I go again on my own.

02:02:11.037 --> 02:02:13.698
It's the only road I've ever known.

02:02:13.718 --> 02:02:18.900
You know, one of your seminars, and you said that you would follow up and you would examine the paper and get back to him.

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:30.483
And, um, and you're also talking about when someone sabotaged one of my webinars and got access to their camera and stuff and put, and then made a video trying to make me look bad and call me names and said, and go to medical school you're talking about.

02:02:31.013 --> 02:02:56.596
I'm talking, I think we're talking about the same person, and I'm not sure that I can reveal his last name, but he was referred to by Debunk the Funk as Tom, and he basically said, here's the paper, and you said on video that you would review that paper and that you would discuss it with him, and I'm just inquiring as to whether that discussion took place, and if not, why not, and also that he suggested that you take a course in, I think, genomic sequencing, and I was wondering

02:02:56.596 --> 02:03:07.421
So I heard on another stage of this Lollapalooza of liars that you were lying in coordination with somebody else when another one of these liars from the other stage snuck up on your stage.

02:03:07.921 --> 02:03:14.344
And I was over there on Brett Weinstein's stage lying with Robert Malone, so I didn't see what you guys were lying about on your stage.

02:03:14.384 --> 02:03:15.244
But how did that go?

02:03:15.604 --> 02:03:18.726
Did you guys end up lying together or you guys lied apart?

02:03:19.466 --> 02:03:22.328
And if you took him up on that offer as well, you know, simple yes or no question.

02:03:22.348 --> 02:03:25.071
Now, Steve, this is what you call a logic fallacy here.

02:03:25.091 --> 02:03:30.235
You're trying to defame my character by saying I didn't, you know, have a discussion with a guy that I said I would.

02:03:30.255 --> 02:03:35.439
That sounds a lot like what Zeck and all these other people are doing with me now.

02:03:38.066 --> 02:03:45.008
pretending that I didn't respond, pretending that I didn't write any emails, pretending that, well, we asked you to send papers and you didn't send papers.

02:03:45.429 --> 02:03:56.232
You know how bullshit it is to say send papers when somebody says that they're lying about viruses, it's all just infectious clones, and they actually tell you to send papers to prove that clones exist?

02:03:56.612 --> 02:03:57.733
These people aren't real.

02:03:58.817 --> 02:04:01.979
These people aren't genuinely trying to solve any problems.

02:04:01.999 --> 02:04:03.100
They are playing a role.

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.821
They're doing what they're told.

02:04:04.981 --> 02:04:13.666
Christine Massey was probably one of the people that was absolutely played by these people, because she was doing something useful before the pandemic, like fighting fluoride in the water.

02:04:14.887 --> 02:04:16.668
So they gave her a really important job.

02:04:17.128 --> 02:04:20.350
You write all these FOIAs, and then we'll promote your work.

02:04:24.153 --> 02:04:27.275
And in the meantime, they'll keep everybody else running in a hamster wheel.

02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:36.014
to never usefully make any progress into understanding that they're willing to murder people and lie about it in order to make sure that we teach our kids that viruses are real.

02:04:38.555 --> 02:04:46.898
Think about how easy it would be for Tom and Andy to have won if they could have come to that very simple combination of words about three years ago.

02:04:47.338 --> 02:04:53.400
You know, they're willing to murder people and lie about it in order to make sure that we teach our kids that gain-of-function viruses are real.

02:04:57.239 --> 02:05:05.623
I just summarized the whole pandemic in one sentence that none of these clowns will ever be able to get to because they've never been trying to get there.

02:05:06.543 --> 02:05:09.024
You see the difference between me and CHD?

02:05:09.444 --> 02:05:11.925
Do you see the difference between me and Mary Holland?

02:05:12.346 --> 02:05:26.412
Between me and Meryl Nass who've had years and years to come to that succinct language that they're willing to lie and murder people in order to make the biosecurity state narrative hold?

02:05:29.019 --> 02:05:38.151
that they're willing to make fake videos about airplanes and blow up buildings in order to make the mythology hold.

02:05:39.232 --> 02:05:42.777
They're willing to kill presidents to make the mythology hold.

02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:47.853
and they will use weaponized piles of money to make the mythology hold.

02:05:48.654 --> 02:05:52.337
They will make us fight about student loans to make the mythology hold.

02:05:52.838 --> 02:05:58.703
They will lie about how a person was killed or not killed by the police to make the mythology hold.

02:05:59.143 --> 02:06:07.411
And they will have coordinated groups of liars in place for five years come together to have an argument in order to make the mythology hold.

02:06:10.442 --> 02:06:12.024
No, I'm just trying to ascertain whether you did.

02:06:12.204 --> 02:06:14.847
I can't be defaming you because I'm not accusing you of not having the discussion.

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:20.674
I want to only talk about the scientific issues, not about some random guy who tries to insult people on camera.

02:06:21.039 --> 02:06:27.661
Okay, well, this is not a random guy and he presented scientific evidence to you, which you said that you would have to look further into the details of the methodology.

02:06:27.921 --> 02:06:32.062
I made a video interpreting the paper that he gave, so you can find that on my platform.

02:06:32.302 --> 02:06:33.623
Yes, I'm aware of that.

02:06:33.783 --> 02:06:39.284
Okay, but you never engaged with him on... I'm not going to engage with people who insult me on camera.

02:06:39.564 --> 02:06:40.604
I mean, why would I do that?

02:06:40.885 --> 02:06:42.125
I didn't think that he was insulting you.

02:06:42.665 --> 02:06:50.910
Yeah, he called me names and said that I didn't graduate medical school or something and put up freeze frames of my face in an awkward position.

02:06:51.351 --> 02:07:06.180
So rather than talking to the Breggans, maybe they could talk to this couple that has been fighting the illusion of psychiatry and psychiatric medicines for 20 years before the pandemic instead of this fake person.

02:07:07.435 --> 02:07:11.987
But we wouldn't do that because this fake person was put in place at the beginning.

02:07:12.509 --> 02:07:15.035
That's why Kevin McCarron in Japan knew his name.

02:07:20.816 --> 02:07:37.991
The same Kevin McCarron that was followed by George Webb at the beginning of the pandemic, that streamed with Paul Cuttrell and Addy Ads at the beginning of the pandemic, and that also had Cameron Kyle Seidel, MD, as a pinned tweet when he just joined Twitter in March of 2020.

02:07:38.171 --> 02:07:39.992
It's all one big lie.

02:07:40.032 --> 02:07:41.073
These are all the liars.

02:07:41.454 --> 02:07:46.178
They told us lies so that we wouldn't figure out they murdered people in order to make this pandemic happen.

02:07:46.198 --> 02:07:46.538
That's it.

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:54.721
Kind of teenage stuff like that.

02:07:54.821 --> 02:07:56.462
Okay, so let's move on to the second question.

02:07:56.742 --> 02:08:00.265
Is it possible to get to passage 4 stock if there's no replication?

02:08:01.245 --> 02:08:01.846
Wait, say that again?

02:08:02.426 --> 02:08:06.149
Is it possible to get to passage 4 stock if there's no replication?

02:08:07.409 --> 02:08:12.453
Is it possible to get to passage 4 stock if there's no replication?

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:15.833
That's the test, that's the question that he asks.

02:08:16.334 --> 02:08:26.120
So passage four is when you have a cell culture and then you dissociate the cells and you put it into a new one.

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.862
You dissociate the cells and you put it in a new one.

02:08:29.402 --> 02:08:32.124
And so you're either taking the supernatant off or you're moving.

02:08:32.164 --> 02:08:34.866
So passaging cells is splitting them.

02:08:37.748 --> 02:08:41.229
And I think that a lot of times, this is very disingenuously said.

02:08:41.289 --> 02:08:45.710
So let me make sure that you understand this, because this is something that a lot of people don't get.

02:08:46.511 --> 02:08:51.992
So if you are passaging cells and you draw it like this, you're not really drawing the cartoon correctly.

02:08:53.233 --> 02:08:57.494
Because what really is happening, of course, is that you start with this plate of cells.

02:08:57.894 --> 02:09:00.114
And at some point, the cells are dividing.

02:09:01.515 --> 02:09:02.875
And so they fill up the plate.

02:09:02.995 --> 02:09:04.696
And if you don't passage them,

02:09:05.458 --> 02:09:16.504
which means you don't take and split them into two plates or split them into a double volume and throw half the volume away, then they'll get too crowded on this plate and they'll die.

02:09:18.065 --> 02:09:23.829
And so passage is a natural consequence of culturing cells because they're always growing.

02:09:25.269 --> 02:09:27.591
Human embryonic kidney cells are always growing.

02:09:27.631 --> 02:09:28.791
So you have to passage them.

02:09:28.811 --> 02:09:33.114
You have to put them in new plates and replate them so that they're not overcrowded.

02:09:36.553 --> 02:09:51.824
And so if they're passaging cells like they do in traditional cell culture, and they transfected this one, then when they passage two plates in the A, and the A, and this is the number one prime one, right?

02:09:54.966 --> 02:09:55.947
Oh, sorry, you can't see that.

02:09:57.148 --> 02:09:57.608
Get out of the way.

02:09:58.484 --> 02:10:05.626
So if they're splitting this, then if they transfected the first dish, then both of these dishes are gonna be transfected.

02:10:06.066 --> 02:10:11.388
And then if the cells keep growing and you split them again, then these guys are all gonna be transfected.

02:10:12.448 --> 02:10:18.050
But that's not replication of a virus, that's replication of the shit that you put in those cells.

02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:26.472
And as those cells divide, they might be copying it or they might be splitting it among their mitotic sister cells.

02:10:27.637 --> 02:10:29.638
But that's not the same as replication.

02:10:29.698 --> 02:10:38.704
And in fact, most, if not all of the time in virology, the rate of replication or quantifying replication is never done.

02:10:42.246 --> 02:10:44.187
Because a plaque assay is not counting that.

02:10:44.827 --> 02:10:47.569
And that's the only assay they have for counting viruses.

02:10:48.850 --> 02:10:57.055
And so you might think that when they say passage, what they mean is they're taking the supernatant, they're taking the juice off the top and putting it into a clean culture.

02:10:58.510 --> 02:11:03.955
and then taking the juice off the top again and putting it into a clean culture, and then over here they say they have viruses.

02:11:04.675 --> 02:11:11.821
But if they're actually passaging, which is how they describe it in many of their methodologies, then they're doing it this way.

02:11:12.382 --> 02:11:22.470
The cells are growing, and so if you put shit in the original cells, and then those cells divide, chances are the shit's gonna be in their sister cells after mitosis.

02:11:23.271 --> 02:11:23.832
And then again,

02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:34.308
And so as long as you don't go too many passages away from the original transfection, you don't need any replication for it to show up in all of these passages.

02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:45.516
Because you put a highly pure concentration of one single molecule into this original dish and called it infectious clones.

02:11:50.342 --> 02:11:58.044
And so it's almost like Steve is asking a question that should be kind of a instant, oh my gosh, this is a teachable moment.

02:11:58.444 --> 02:12:00.544
I'm gonna teach you what these people are lying about.

02:12:00.604 --> 02:12:01.144
Here we go.

02:12:01.724 --> 02:12:02.445
Is he gonna do it?

02:12:03.125 --> 02:12:04.645
I'm afraid not, ladies and gentlemen.

02:12:04.665 --> 02:12:11.287
I'm afraid he's gonna fail miserably to tell you what passaging means and doesn't mean and what supernatant is and not.

02:12:11.747 --> 02:12:17.648
And he's just not gonna get there because that's not the goal of this charade.

02:12:18.368 --> 02:12:19.668
this fake discussion.

02:12:19.948 --> 02:12:24.770
Well, what do you, I mean, passage is just taking some fluid from one cell culture and adding it to another cell culture.

02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:26.010
So what do you like?

02:12:26.590 --> 02:12:28.291
All you need is a pipette and cell cultures to do that.

02:12:28.871 --> 02:12:35.873
You also have to dissociate the cells because again, as I said, passage means that the cells are growing and you need to give them more room.

02:12:37.313 --> 02:12:39.373
It's not just sucking the juice off the top.

02:12:39.413 --> 02:12:41.174
That's removing the supernatant.

02:12:45.322 --> 02:12:49.303
But I forgive him because he's probably never done cell culture before like I have.

02:12:50.024 --> 02:12:54.565
You know, I have publications where I used HEK cells for a few years at the University of Chicago.

02:12:55.105 --> 02:13:00.167
Another unfortunate expertise in my background there, guys.

02:13:01.508 --> 02:13:02.228
Unfortunately.

02:13:02.248 --> 02:13:08.170
Is that what you're asking?

02:13:08.190 --> 02:13:10.531
You understand what I mean by passage for stock, right?

02:13:11.803 --> 02:13:18.204
Are you talking about... Okay, there was an original sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

02:13:18.585 --> 02:13:19.425
It's in that paper.

02:13:19.705 --> 02:13:24.106
This is a direct quote from the paper, which I'm sure you're familiar with because that's basic.

02:13:24.146 --> 02:13:34.168
And so now he's pretending to dunk on Andy because he's pulling a quote from a paper that Andy discussed before, and now Andy's gonna fight back and say, well, that's not really fair and blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:13:34.608 --> 02:13:42.233
and they're gonna get nowhere and argue about nothing meaningful, and the people that like Andy are gonna say, wow, you really kicked his ass, didn't you, Steve?

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:47.257
And the people who like Steve are gonna be like, well, that guy's not very nice anyway, and he's kind of an Android.

02:13:48.718 --> 02:13:56.924
And so in the end, nothing will happen, nothing will be learned, nothing will be gained, no progress will be made, and the same division will exist.

02:13:58.561 --> 02:14:13.071
And that's the reason why they never wanted me to have a discussion with them on the CHD platform, or we would have been able to figure this out, and these people would have been exposed for the liars that they are, that have never been coming to our rescue on white horses.

02:14:13.611 --> 02:14:15.653
We're always working with the slavers.

02:14:16.273 --> 02:14:19.115
Literature that everybody would be familiar with who looks at SARS-CoV-2.

02:14:19.135 --> 02:14:22.778
Are you talking about the paper I sent to your staff, the fanwood paper?

02:14:23.308 --> 02:14:28.913
Um, I, uh, I don't think it was, um, the first published, uh, genome of SARS-CoV-2.

02:14:28.933 --> 02:14:30.174
No, no, no, no, no.

02:14:30.194 --> 02:14:31.295
The first one in the United States.

02:14:32.756 --> 02:14:34.258
The Sohomish County man.

02:14:34.278 --> 02:14:37.200
The Sohomish County man.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:41.944
Only the first genome matters because they used templates for all subsequent, uh, genome sequencing.

02:14:42.345 --> 02:14:43.105
So, okay.

02:14:43.125 --> 02:14:46.268
So let me, uh, that's why I submitted the fan Wu paper to your staff.

02:14:46.568 --> 02:14:48.270
Did you have a chance to read the papers I submitted?

02:14:48.761 --> 02:14:50.042
No, because they didn't provide it to me.

02:14:50.402 --> 02:14:51.723
Oh, I gave it several days ago, Steve.

02:14:52.203 --> 02:14:56.306
Oh, so now we're going to have some fake debate about whether he sends papers.

02:14:56.366 --> 02:14:59.348
So when he sends papers, then that means you got to send papers.

02:14:59.808 --> 02:15:01.089
You didn't read the papers.

02:15:01.530 --> 02:15:04.972
Then what in the world are we doing 39 minutes into the discussion?

02:15:08.894 --> 02:15:12.036
They should just have the Benny Hill theme in the background on repeat.

02:15:12.096 --> 02:15:12.937
It's so stupid.

02:15:13.197 --> 02:15:14.278
Steve, why didn't you have a chance to read it?

02:15:14.898 --> 02:15:16.980
Because they never, I'm telling you, they didn't provide it to me.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:17.360
I see.

02:15:18.581 --> 02:15:19.662
Well, why?

02:15:19.702 --> 02:15:20.322
Okay.

02:15:20.503 --> 02:15:28.309
So the paper that I'm talking about is titled isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from the first US COVID-19 patient.

02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:29.730
Okay.

02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:32.532
I mean, I read that paper, but I read it, you know, a couple of years ago.

02:15:33.032 --> 02:15:33.313
Okay.

02:15:34.113 --> 02:15:36.935
But, um, let me, let me read the, uh, let's see.

02:15:37.016 --> 02:15:40.098
So, uh, pass, um, I'm looking at the paper right now.

02:15:41.139 --> 02:15:41.239
Um,

02:15:42.847 --> 02:15:51.074
We subsequently generated a fourth passage stock of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells, another fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line.

02:15:52.175 --> 02:15:59.962
Viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 passage four stock was sequenced and confirmed to have no nucleotide mutations compared to the original reference.

02:16:01.123 --> 02:16:06.828
So imagine if they're passaging, not by taking supernatant, by just splitting the cells.

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:17.162
transfect the first, let him divide and fill up the cell dish, dissociate him, split him in half, plate him again, which is exactly what passage is.

02:16:18.641 --> 02:16:27.587
And I'm quite, frankly, I'm getting very frustrated because I have a feeling that that's one of the lies that they are telling in this thing that I never thought, I just thought it would be bullshit.

02:16:27.627 --> 02:16:40.555
But actually they are putting down this lie or this misconception that passage is the use of the taking of supernatant off the top of one cell culture and putting it on another cell culture.

02:16:40.615 --> 02:16:41.876
That is not passage.

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.905
Passage is when you actually dissociate the cells and make room for more by putting them on two plates instead of one.

02:16:53.988 --> 02:16:57.611
And what passage you're on is how many times have you replated them.

02:16:58.372 --> 02:17:03.176
And if you get to a certain passage, you can expect the cells to misbehave.

02:17:03.616 --> 02:17:09.521
If you transfected the first cells with an SK channel like I did,

02:17:11.112 --> 02:17:19.279
and then you want to grow a dish of those, you wait until the eighth passage when the expression is pretty uniform, and then you work on those cells.

02:17:25.745 --> 02:17:31.610
It's very, very, very interesting that they talk about transfection and transformation of cell culture.

02:17:32.391 --> 02:17:32.831
And in 2024,

02:17:36.004 --> 02:17:47.930
Dr. Andy Kaufman is still not sophisticated enough to just tell Steve that what you're describing there is actually just transformation and transfection of cell cultures that they then subsequently split by passage.

02:17:48.710 --> 02:17:50.291
And so they've just put it in the cells.

02:17:50.351 --> 02:17:54.633
And now you shouldn't be surprised that it's there after the fourth passage, Steve.

02:17:54.993 --> 02:18:02.177
They put a highly concentrated, almost pure version of the RNA signal called SARS-CoV-2 on the original dish.

02:18:02.717 --> 02:18:12.259
So to go four dishes into the future and find out that that signal's still pretty high fidelity is not really surprising because it started out pure!

02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:30.343
And that's why this guy didn't talk to me in the airport and pretended to didn't know me and then figured out that my name was JJ and has been avoiding talking to me or anyone related to me since the beginning of the pandemic just like the rest of them have.

02:18:31.854 --> 02:18:35.117
because they don't want to admit they could have gotten here in 2020.

02:18:36.918 --> 02:18:43.144
They don't want to admit that they could have just said, well, you can't make yourselves do something that they don't already do because the cuckoo clock can't make toast.

02:18:43.584 --> 02:18:48.028
And so, you know, when they did this stuff, they're just transfecting cells and calling it virology.

02:18:49.909 --> 02:18:52.991
And just because they find a sequence doesn't mean it's replicating in you.

02:18:53.011 --> 02:18:54.912
It could just be proximity or exposure.

02:18:54.932 --> 02:18:56.453
It could even be a background signal.

02:18:56.854 --> 02:19:03.558
You can talk about all of this stuff and summarize it in like 10 minutes, especially if you've been trying to do it for four years.

02:19:04.719 --> 02:19:05.279
You'd think.

02:19:07.521 --> 02:19:07.881
Sequence.

02:19:08.541 --> 02:19:11.363
And then they give the GenBank accession number in that paper.

02:19:11.744 --> 02:19:18.108
So how is it possible, Dr. Kaufman, to have a fourth passage if there's no replication?

02:19:19.653 --> 02:19:22.894
Well, what is the starting materials of that experiment, Steve?

02:19:23.114 --> 02:19:24.795
Did they have a virus and put it in there?

02:19:25.475 --> 02:19:26.835
Is there a virus in that experiment?

02:19:26.855 --> 02:19:27.716
You said you read the paper.

02:19:28.316 --> 02:19:30.076
No, I said I read that paper two years ago.

02:19:30.116 --> 02:19:31.337
You think I remember the details?

02:19:31.377 --> 02:19:32.957
But I know how all these papers are done similarly.

02:19:32.977 --> 02:19:33.878
What was the starting material?

02:19:34.158 --> 02:19:34.738
It doesn't matter.

02:19:34.778 --> 02:19:35.738
This is a generic question.

02:19:35.778 --> 02:19:36.299
It doesn't matter.

02:19:38.345 --> 02:19:39.927
So is Andy about to explain?

02:19:39.967 --> 02:19:49.639
No, a lot of these papers start out with just a synthetic molecule, a very pure synthetic molecule, and then they transfect or transform the cell culture and claim they're doing virology.

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:54.104
I'm simply asking, hang on, you're interrupting.

02:19:54.405 --> 02:19:55.106
Is it possible

02:19:55.506 --> 02:19:58.768
to get to passage for stock if there is no replication.

02:19:58.788 --> 02:20:06.212
This is an easy question that when I ask any of my experts who do this stuff for a living, there is no question as to what the answer to that question is.

02:20:06.232 --> 02:20:09.934
And so it troubles me that you're asking questions like, how is this prepared?

02:20:10.194 --> 02:20:11.755
This is a simple cut and dry object.

02:20:11.855 --> 02:20:15.076
When I ask my experts that do this stuff for a living.

02:20:15.617 --> 02:20:16.957
Stop lying.

02:20:17.398 --> 02:20:18.998
Wow, that was gross, Steve.

02:20:19.058 --> 02:20:19.719
That was gross.

02:20:19.779 --> 02:20:21.380
It's so gross, I'm going to play it again.

02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:30.265
Is it possible to get to passage for stock if there is no replication?

02:20:30.285 --> 02:20:36.253
This is an easy question that when I ask any of my experts who do this stuff for a living, there is no question.

02:20:36.333 --> 02:20:37.775
I wonder what experts he means.

02:20:37.815 --> 02:20:38.596
Does he mean like,

02:20:39.657 --> 02:20:56.589
John Bodwin or does he mean Stephanie Seneff or does he mean Jessica Rose or Matt Crawford or Mark Giordano or who else in his steering committee is he talking about as experts because I didn't know anybody in his steering committee that did anything for a living besides Substack except for me.

02:21:00.954 --> 02:21:02.734
Wow, this is a joke.

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:07.856
As to what the answer to that question is, and so it troubles me that you're asking questions like, how is this prepared?

02:21:08.116 --> 02:21:10.076
This is a simple, cut and dry, objective question.

02:21:10.316 --> 02:21:12.377
Is it possible to get the passage forced on if there's no replication?

02:21:12.397 --> 02:21:12.737
Yes or no?

02:21:13.737 --> 02:21:16.598
Steve, I can't answer that question because I don't know what you mean, is it possible?

02:21:16.638 --> 02:21:22.099
Like I said, passage just means you pipette some fluid from one culture and put it in a subsequent culture.

02:21:22.519 --> 02:21:25.019
So you can do that a million times, right?

02:21:25.059 --> 02:21:26.940
As long as you have enough pipettes and enough cell cultures.

02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:43.880
So if they put pure DNA on one cell culture, or pure RNA on one cell culture, and then they use the exact technique that this guy said, which is pipette some juice into the next culture,

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:52.587
Do you need to have RNA or DNA replication to find the RNA in the fourth time you do that?

02:21:52.647 --> 02:21:53.948
The answer is very simple.

02:21:54.088 --> 02:21:59.453
No, because they put a large quantity of pure RNA into the first passage.

02:22:00.073 --> 02:22:03.156
And so to find it in the fourth one is not very surprising, Steve.

02:22:03.536 --> 02:22:05.718
It's a very small molecule and it was very pure.

02:22:08.442 --> 02:22:16.188
Can anyone see how easy it would be for Andy Kaufman to dunk on him if he would have taken the time to maybe listen to my talk at the Red Pill Conference?

02:22:18.250 --> 02:22:21.712
Instead, he was not at the Red Pill Conference, he was doing this appearance.

02:22:23.754 --> 02:22:31.660
And then afterward, told Steve Kirsch to call me because, listen, that's what he says, call me.

02:22:34.781 --> 02:22:36.002
Hey, this is Steve Kirsch.

02:22:36.403 --> 02:22:41.888
I've been engaging in the no virus debate.

02:22:42.388 --> 02:22:43.469
Engaging, yeah, right.

02:22:43.489 --> 02:22:45.712
And somebody said I should talk to you.

02:22:46.613 --> 02:22:50.356
And I'm assuming they think that's because you think that viruses don't exist.

02:22:50.957 --> 02:22:56.122
I presume that he's using the word they because his pronouns are they.

02:22:58.348 --> 02:23:04.431
Otherwise, why wouldn't you just say, I spoke to Andy Kaufman about the no virus thing, but he said they, because I guess that's his pronoun.

02:23:04.491 --> 02:23:06.693
So we learned something about Andy, at least that.

02:23:07.233 --> 02:23:08.974
In order to, you're interrupting me now.

02:23:09.254 --> 02:23:10.635
Okay, I was gonna try to answer your question.

02:23:10.675 --> 02:23:14.537
In order to understand what this experiment, because you made that question completely out of context.

02:23:15.057 --> 02:23:16.438
What is the experiment?

02:23:16.478 --> 02:23:17.379
Like what are the procedures?

02:23:17.439 --> 02:23:19.740
What, how many samples do they have?

02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:22.101
Jason, that message was from this weekend.

02:23:22.161 --> 02:23:26.924
I got that message while I was at dinner with people that I met at the Red Pill Conference.

02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.340
Like that's real.

02:23:32.021 --> 02:23:44.643
That guy called me out of nowhere right after he made this recording to tell me that they, I guess he's referring to the pronouns for Andy, that they said that he should talk to me.

02:23:44.663 --> 02:23:55.406
I guess he forgot I was on his steering committee and I've already publicly declared him one of the worst liars and one of the worst traitors in America right now.

02:23:56.963 --> 02:24:00.346
one of the largest single donors to the DNC before the pandemic.

02:24:00.386 --> 02:24:05.151
This guy has probably done cocaine with Hillary Clinton before.

02:24:05.171 --> 02:24:10.636
I mean, this is just gross.

02:24:10.816 --> 02:24:11.337
Who are they from?

02:24:11.677 --> 02:24:13.238
Is it one sample from one patient?

02:24:13.419 --> 02:24:14.660
Did they purify a virus out of it?

02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:17.943
Did they prove a virus is in it first before they started the experiment?

02:24:19.504 --> 02:24:21.006
How do you know there's a virus in the experiment?

02:24:22.252 --> 02:24:37.798
So what they did is they a patient with so this is I'm reading directly from the paper a patient was identified with confirmed cold with confirmed kovat 19, Sohomish County man in Washington State on January 22nd 22nd paper that proves that kovat exists.

02:24:37.858 --> 02:24:40.419
How can you start with already knowing that they have kovat?

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:48.062
Because we're talking about kovat kovat 19 which we're talking about somebody that they put a clone in

02:24:48.919 --> 02:24:54.061
They put a highly concentrated DNA or RNA representing the sequence that they wanted to find.

02:24:54.542 --> 02:24:58.283
They brought the guy into the hospital, they swabbed him, and lo and behold, they found it.

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:03.506
Lo and behold, they found so much of it that they could put it on a cell culture and passage it once or twice.

02:25:04.726 --> 02:25:07.087
Do you know that this would cost like 50 bucks?

02:25:09.628 --> 02:25:13.550
Because making a DNA sequence and then putting it somewhere is cheap as shit.

02:25:14.390 --> 02:25:15.451
Ask Kevin McKernan.

02:25:19.184 --> 02:25:21.785
is the disease, not SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus.

02:25:21.985 --> 02:25:22.205
Gotcha.

02:25:22.245 --> 02:25:24.985
How do you diagnose COVID, though?

02:25:25.045 --> 02:25:25.526
Well, let's see.

02:25:34.608 --> 02:25:39.009
The sound of dental drills and I don't know what else belongs here.

02:25:39.029 --> 02:25:46.751
Okay, so what they did is they used a cycle threshold of 18 to 20, both in the throat swabs and nasal swabs.

02:25:47.202 --> 02:25:49.203
Okay, so they did a PCR test, right?

02:25:49.223 --> 02:25:50.423
They did a PCR test, correct.

02:25:50.503 --> 02:25:54.184
Okay, so how do you know that the PCR test... So for what amplicon?

02:25:55.244 --> 02:25:56.945
And did they use nested primers?

02:25:57.005 --> 02:26:02.506
Is he gonna ask that question, which would be the right question to ask because nested primers makes PCR foolproof.

02:26:03.046 --> 02:26:05.147
And without nested primers, it's stupid.

02:26:06.229 --> 02:26:23.571
And anybody at an academic biological bench that uses PCR in their laboratory knows damn well that in addition to nested PCR primers, you're also going to have several negative and positive controls so that you have a gauge as to whether or not you're comparative to signals you understand.

02:26:26.730 --> 02:26:32.574
And yet all of these PCR tests that I've ever looked at never had a positive and negative control.

02:26:33.174 --> 02:26:38.999
And the negative control and the positive controls were never run alongside the experimental control Amplicon.

02:26:44.722 --> 02:26:49.606
I mean there's real easy ways to explain how the PCR test could be accurate and not accurate.

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:57.402
be high fidelity and not high fidelity and have nothing to do with the disease that they say is going around.

02:26:57.442 --> 02:27:11.085
But Andy Kaufman, just for whatever reason, after five years, can't even get close to coming to a reasonable approach of possibly ever mustering a reasonable explanation for how that could be.

02:27:13.285 --> 02:27:15.126
Because he's a traitor and a liar.

02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:18.181
They didn't say that.

02:27:18.201 --> 02:27:26.868
They just said that it was confirmed that the PCR test said it was COVID, and that they did... The whole thing is based on that that patient has COVID, right?

02:27:26.968 --> 02:27:29.930
And they're saying they have COVID because they have a genetic test, right?

02:27:30.451 --> 02:27:34.154
That the genetic test is supposedly testing genetic sequences from a virus.

02:27:35.322 --> 02:27:37.584
But this experiment is to prove that there's a virus.

02:27:37.624 --> 02:27:44.771
So they assume there's a virus, they have a test for it, that without ever finding it, and then they use the test results to prove that it exists.

02:27:44.811 --> 02:27:46.172
This is circular reasoning.

02:27:46.733 --> 02:27:49.656
Where's the prima facie evidence that there's a virus in the first place?

02:27:50.356 --> 02:27:54.600
You can't have a PCR test without that because the genetic sequences allegedly belong to that virus.

02:27:54.901 --> 02:27:57.203
How do you know they belong to it if you haven't discovered the virus first?

02:27:57.742 --> 02:28:01.283
Well, but they did discover the virus first in an earlier paper out of China.

02:28:01.643 --> 02:28:04.263
And so these PCR tests were- You know about the one I submitted to your staff, the Fan Wu paper?

02:28:05.883 --> 02:28:12.025
It probably was, but I don't know what the origin of the PCR test was in this paper, and maybe if I had time to read it more carefully.

02:28:12.225 --> 02:28:18.566
But my point is this, that everybody I've talked to says it's not possible to get to passage four stock if there's no replication.

02:28:19.426 --> 02:28:24.827
So you're claiming- Everybody that he's talked to claims it's impossible to get to

02:28:26.442 --> 02:28:31.326
Passage 4 stock, unless there's replication, but I just explained it to you right here.

02:28:33.588 --> 02:28:45.278
That if you put a pure quantity of DNA or RNA onto your original passage 0, and then you do standard cell culture passage, you're splitting that cell culture up.

02:28:45.878 --> 02:28:50.923
And so it doesn't even matter if there's replication because those cells are dividing and they're splitting up whatever's in them.

02:28:52.273 --> 02:29:03.360
Alternatively, not all the DNA stays in those cells, and some of it is shed into the supernatant, and when you split, then it's still there, and then you split, and it's still there, and then you split, and it's still there.

02:29:04.261 --> 02:29:14.608
So if you put a high enough quantity in the original dish, and it makes it to cell passage four, it doesn't mean it's being copied, it just means that the PCR positivity didn't go to zero.

02:29:16.890 --> 02:29:19.992
Because Andy's not gonna point out that, well, you don't quantify it.

02:29:20.888 --> 02:29:23.310
in the first one, you don't quantify it in the last one.

02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:32.135
And if you don't quantify it, then how do you differentiate between replication and just it following your pipette?

02:29:35.057 --> 02:29:36.778
That's the argument to make, Andy.

02:29:37.498 --> 02:29:38.939
Like that's how you dunk on him.

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:42.862
You explain that they started with a pure RNA.

02:29:42.902 --> 02:29:44.202
How could it be possible?

02:29:44.883 --> 02:29:48.065
How do you differentiate unless you're quantifying it at each passage?

02:29:50.294 --> 02:29:52.355
How can they possibly make that argument?

02:29:52.395 --> 02:29:54.556
That would be the easiest argument to rebut.

02:29:54.616 --> 02:29:57.257
What does that mean?

02:29:57.517 --> 02:29:58.498
What's not possible about it?

02:29:58.518 --> 02:30:01.479
You mean that you won't have a positive PCR test in the first place?

02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:03.620
No, no, that you can't get to the next stage.

02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:10.943
In order to get to passage four, it means that there are basically four replications where you measured that the thing that you're looking at has replicated.

02:30:11.523 --> 02:30:13.224
When you say replication, what do you mean?

02:30:13.854 --> 02:30:19.218
Well, in order to go and do genomic sequencing, you usually start off by taking a sample.

02:30:19.458 --> 02:30:20.479
You're talking about cultures, aren't you?

02:30:20.519 --> 02:30:21.319
Yes, cell cultures.

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:23.841
Yeah, cell cultures before the sequence.

02:30:24.742 --> 02:30:27.964
You don't just take the- So what's the positive control, Steve?

02:30:28.004 --> 02:30:39.512
Like, what's the positive control RNA target in Vero6 cells so that we can have a relative idea, okay, in this cell culture, the level of RNA of this

02:30:40.353 --> 02:30:42.234
this expected signal is here.

02:30:42.795 --> 02:30:46.917
And then the signal of our RNA of the virus is over here, over there.

02:30:46.937 --> 02:31:09.853
And we can see it relative to a constant signal that we kind of understand for our cell culture, which is how anybody would do an academic application of PCR, not nevermind the nested primers and all this stuff, but just the idea of having a proper control, a positive control that you know is there, something that the Vero6 cells produce at a known level all the time.

02:31:10.393 --> 02:31:22.883
that could kind of give you an idea of how crowded the cell culture is and how active the cell culture is in normal homeostasis and then compare that to your experimental measurement of the viral RNA.

02:31:23.284 --> 02:31:34.373
That's how you explain this Andy and you've had like four and a half almost five years to be able to nail these people down and it's kind of striking that you can't nail someone down as retarded as Steve.

02:31:35.712 --> 02:31:39.234
the swab, and then try to genetic sequence that, you would go and try to... No, you're right.

02:31:39.434 --> 02:31:43.695
You got to take genetic material from an actual organism to sequence it, so you know what you're sequencing.

02:31:43.996 --> 02:31:49.898
Right, but then you go and you put it in these Vero cells in order to replicate it, so that you have lots of copies of it, and then you go and run the sequence on it.

02:31:49.918 --> 02:31:50.518
Why would you do that?

02:31:50.558 --> 02:31:54.820
You can amplify it with PCR, you only need one copy, and you can make infinite amount with PCR.

02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:55.400
You could.

02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:56.580
No, that's not true.

02:31:58.181 --> 02:31:59.642
You can make infinite amount.

02:31:59.702 --> 02:32:02.923
PCR doesn't make an infinite amount of any size molecule.

02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:07.822
PCR has its limitations as to what it can amplify.

02:32:08.562 --> 02:32:10.683
It can only look for a certain size amplicon.

02:32:10.723 --> 02:32:12.785
Is he really that mal-informed?

02:32:14.146 --> 02:32:16.447
Are we really gonna be this bad right now?

02:32:19.689 --> 02:32:20.810
This is terrible.

02:32:23.031 --> 02:32:24.672
I'm terrified where this is going.

02:32:24.832 --> 02:32:28.494
Just take the swab and then try to genetic sequence that.

02:32:28.574 --> 02:32:30.195
You would go and try to- No, you're right.

02:32:30.375 --> 02:32:34.618
You gotta take genetic material from an actual organism to sequence it so you know what you're sequencing.

02:32:34.895 --> 02:32:40.819
Right, but then you go and you put it in these varro cells in order to replicate it so that you have lots of copies of it, and then you go and run the sequence on it.

02:32:40.839 --> 02:32:41.420
Why would you do that?

02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:45.703
You can amplify it with PCR, you only need one copy, and you can make an infinite amount with PCR.

02:32:45.723 --> 02:32:45.903
You could.

02:32:45.923 --> 02:32:47.124
Why would you need to culture it?

02:32:47.144 --> 02:32:48.845
Because you want to culture the entire genome.

02:32:50.686 --> 02:32:51.327
Does that make sense?

02:32:51.647 --> 02:32:52.828
You can't culture a genome, Steve.

02:32:52.848 --> 02:32:53.848
You can only culture organisms.

02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:55.790
Yes, but your culture... There you go.

02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:56.630
Ooh, I like that.

02:32:56.650 --> 02:32:57.831
You can't culture a genome.

02:32:57.851 --> 02:32:59.392
You can only culture organisms.

02:32:59.452 --> 02:33:04.256
Of course, that was my message about pattern integrities for the last two years.

02:33:06.516 --> 02:33:08.698
And that viruses are not pattern integrities.

02:33:08.878 --> 02:33:10.139
They can't pandemic.

02:33:10.679 --> 02:33:12.861
During the virus that you believe exists.

02:33:13.282 --> 02:33:16.825
And what happens is that they do this and they find that virus replicates.

02:33:17.085 --> 02:33:21.388
That you prove that you're culturing the virus by detecting these sequences that you can't prove came from the virus?

02:33:23.890 --> 02:33:25.352
What you can do.

02:33:25.472 --> 02:33:26.953
How do you know the virus is in that experiment?

02:33:29.057 --> 02:33:31.438
You don't necessarily know that, but you're replicating something.

02:33:32.118 --> 02:33:32.958
Something's replicating.

02:33:34.378 --> 02:33:37.439
Do you think you can get to passage if nothing is replicating?

02:33:38.279 --> 02:33:39.879
What do you mean by replicating?

02:33:39.919 --> 02:33:41.180
How do you tell if something's replicating?

02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:54.822
Because if you have twice as much as something, and you then go through another process of replication, then it's clear that something is replicating.

02:33:55.182 --> 02:33:56.923
You have twice as many viral particles?

02:33:56.983 --> 02:33:57.983
You have twice as many particles.

02:33:58.314 --> 02:34:02.897
Okay, where are the pictures of the particles going from half as many to- Oh, so he's kind of got him here.

02:34:02.917 --> 02:34:04.958
You have twice as many particles.

02:34:05.018 --> 02:34:06.959
So that's probably why it's passage.

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:08.841
It's passage.

02:34:08.881 --> 02:34:11.582
They're just dissociating the cells and putting them in new dishes.

02:34:11.622 --> 02:34:16.565
And then after fourth passage, look, we're still doing virology because it's still there.

02:34:17.966 --> 02:34:20.708
They transfected a cell culture and did passage on it.

02:34:20.748 --> 02:34:26.932
And then they found what they transfected in the passage four cells and said, look, it's replicating dad.

02:34:27.972 --> 02:34:28.472
Impressive.

02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:28.972
Twice as many.

02:34:29.393 --> 02:34:33.874
I'm just asking you, the point is that when you go, I mean, these are pretty, I didn't expect to be stuck here.

02:34:33.894 --> 02:34:44.959
I'm telling you that all of your results that you're talking about are- He didn't expect to be stuck here, but they were stuck somewhere else like for a half an hour first about something to do with scientific method and then something else.

02:34:45.079 --> 02:34:46.239
Oh my gosh, it's hilarious.

02:34:46.279 --> 02:34:57.284
Based on PCR testing with looking at, well, then what are- Passage 4 is not about a PCR testing, it's putting these samples into viral cells and having them replicate.

02:34:57.964 --> 02:34:58.705
in the viral cells.

02:34:58.945 --> 02:35:01.346
How do you detect their replication?

02:35:02.427 --> 02:35:03.868
Like I said, I'm not an expert on this.

02:35:03.908 --> 02:35:09.671
Well, Kevin McKernan can tell you all about how the RNA dependent RNA polymerase makes perfect copies of the genome.

02:35:10.251 --> 02:35:17.416
And that those perfect copies of the genome are just really hard to detect with nanopore sequencing, because nanopore sequencing isn't perfect.

02:35:17.976 --> 02:35:22.519
And it likes small, little DNA and RNA a lot better than big RNA.

02:35:24.838 --> 02:35:25.618
It's all liars.

02:35:25.678 --> 02:35:32.302
It's all just the same group of liars lying about different aspects of the lie in order to make sure that the lie never becomes visible.

02:35:33.082 --> 02:35:35.964
But it's totally visible now because these monkeys are visible.

02:35:38.925 --> 02:35:42.287
Talk to people and people think this is a problem.

02:35:42.427 --> 02:35:45.128
Have you ever done this stuff before, Dr. Kaufman, yourself?

02:35:45.809 --> 02:35:46.629
Done which stuff?

02:35:47.455 --> 02:35:50.559
Have I worked in a laboratory with culture, cell cultures?

02:35:50.619 --> 02:35:57.607
Have you ever taken a swab of somebody who has supposedly, hypothetically, a virus?

02:35:57.947 --> 02:36:07.178
Have you ever taken a nasal swab and have you ever placed that into a varro cell and then replicated that and done a whole genome sequence on it?

02:36:07.785 --> 02:36:08.766
Do you know what a Vero cell is?

02:36:09.306 --> 02:36:10.707
Yes, it's a monkey kidney cell.

02:36:10.907 --> 02:36:16.791
So let me ask you, if this virus grows in the lungs, why do they need to use monkey kidney cells that are genetically modified, by the way?

02:36:17.572 --> 02:36:21.435
Surely, Dr. Kaufman, I can't believe you're asking me that question.

02:36:21.455 --> 02:36:22.716
You're telling me that you don't know the answer to it?

02:36:22.736 --> 02:36:23.676
I'll tell you the answer to it.

02:36:24.057 --> 02:36:25.918
I know the answer to it, but I think we have different answers.

02:36:26.625 --> 02:36:29.286
Okay, well, I can tell you the answer to it as far as I know.

02:36:29.367 --> 02:36:34.249
This is the fake kind of crescendo into, oh my gosh, I'm going to dunk on you.

02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:36.790
I don't think I'm going to make it much longer because it's so fake.

02:36:37.371 --> 02:36:42.833
But I assure you, I assure you that these two people are the highest level of traitor right now.

02:36:43.914 --> 02:36:48.676
There's no possible way that these two guys haven't been working against Americans since the very beginning.

02:36:48.716 --> 02:36:55.240
And that's why Kevin McCarran enunciated this name before any other American's name.

02:36:56.311 --> 02:37:01.134
He said his name more often than my name in a stream when we were streaming together.

02:37:03.976 --> 02:37:15.605
And AddyAds and him, both very close associates with George Webb, agreed that this battle should be fought on Twitter, just like Kevin McKernan agreed and just like all these people have agreed ever since.

02:37:17.326 --> 02:37:21.589
Even CHD and Bobby Kennedy are assured that at least I don't get censored on Twitter.

02:37:24.602 --> 02:37:34.417
These people are all working for probably Peter Thiel and Palantir and Elon Musk, and they are working to be part of the new way that Americans are governed.

02:37:36.059 --> 02:37:40.326
I think we're going to have to make a very hard decision to absolutely positively leave Twitter.

02:37:42.039 --> 02:37:46.843
We're just gonna have to turn it off because these people are super users of Twitter.

02:37:47.344 --> 02:37:48.825
They might not even use Twitter.

02:37:49.506 --> 02:37:54.670
They might have, the military might have people at Twitter headquarters that tweet for these assholes.

02:37:55.531 --> 02:38:08.122
So that while we waste a few minutes every day trying to combat the nonsense that they say or respond to their DMs on Twitter, they're doing other things, you know, like tour in the world and making hot tub photos.

02:38:09.266 --> 02:38:17.706
raising money for their vaccine safety research council and it's broadcast that deserves nothing but ire and disgust.

02:38:21.954 --> 02:38:23.034
Again, I'm not an expert on this.

02:38:23.194 --> 02:38:29.296
But the reason they use these cells is because these cells are basically, they're these immortal cells that are easy to grow stuff in.

02:38:29.676 --> 02:38:38.138
And so it's simply a scientific container to allow a replication of a virus that comes from a human or some other places.

02:38:38.518 --> 02:38:41.999
And it happens to be a nice medium for growing things.

02:38:42.219 --> 02:38:43.639
It's like dirt, effectively.

02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:47.903
You know, with dirt for plants, you take a plant, you put it into dirt, the plant grows.

02:38:48.223 --> 02:38:55.970
The same thing can be true for putting these foreign cells, this virus, into varro cells so that you can go and replicate the virus.

02:38:56.351 --> 02:39:01.896
So, Steve, this is a good point because the paper number two, if Livia wants to pop it on screen at some point,

02:39:02.556 --> 02:39:08.380
talks about this, that SARS-CoV-2, even if you think it's real, even mainstream people say it doesn't affect the kidneys.

02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:09.800
So how could you culture it in kidney cells?

02:39:10.281 --> 02:39:18.605
But this article shows how they have kidney biopsies from pre-COVID and during COVID, but with all negative, unvalidated COVID tests.

02:39:19.166 --> 02:39:19.826
And they found

02:39:20.526 --> 02:39:27.367
particles on electron microscopy that look identical to what they say coronaviruses look like, the same size with the spikes.

02:39:28.348 --> 02:39:35.029
And they basically say that you can't identify it from these images, and that this problem has been known about since the 70s.

02:39:35.049 --> 02:39:35.949
This is what it says in the paper.

02:39:35.969 --> 02:39:43.651
And even there's another paper that the CDC published about this issue, that by looking at these microscopic images, it doesn't tell you what you're looking at.

02:39:44.071 --> 02:39:48.239
that these things could be confused for all types of subcellular particles.

02:39:48.259 --> 02:39:56.794
And that's what the exosome discussion came from, because exosomes are just one type of many subcellular particles that are found in the body, and they're much more common.

02:39:57.259 --> 02:40:06.521
in pathological conditions like disease and injuries, that they can't be distinguished morphologically by sight, by shape, by appearance on microscopy from each other.

02:40:07.461 --> 02:40:09.422
There needs to be some other way of identification.

02:40:09.922 --> 02:40:14.943
Just like in the experiment you were talking about, there was no direct visualization of viral particles that are being replicated.

02:40:15.163 --> 02:40:15.823
There doesn't need to be.

02:40:15.863 --> 02:40:16.824
We have whole genome sequencing.

02:40:16.964 --> 02:40:22.485
Well, if you don't detect the actual thing you're looking at and use a proxy variable or a covariate, it needs to be validated.

02:40:23.466 --> 02:40:24.186
It is validated.

02:40:24.707 --> 02:40:29.952
The whole genome sequence, Dr. Coffman, do you know how many countries have validated the whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?

02:40:30.993 --> 02:40:32.054
They haven't validated it.

02:40:32.074 --> 02:40:36.838
What they've done is they've run a template and not gotten the same results, which is why there are millions and millions of variants.

02:40:37.158 --> 02:40:39.801
Yes, but they're very similar, aren't they?

02:40:41.042 --> 02:40:41.302
I don't know.

02:40:41.322 --> 02:40:43.264
We're very similar to chimpanzees, but we're not the same.

02:40:44.967 --> 02:40:50.169
But, you know, the size of the genome for a chimpanzee is quite a bit different than the size of the genome for SARS-CoV-2.

02:40:50.189 --> 02:40:53.430
Do you know what the size of the genome for SARS-CoV-2 is?

02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:57.652
There is no genome for CoV-2 because SARS-CoV-2 hasn't actually been shown to exist.

02:40:59.792 --> 02:41:07.255
Let me call it the gene sequence, or sorry, the sequence of nucleotides for SARS-CoV-2.

02:41:07.295 --> 02:41:08.636
Do you know how long the sequence is?

02:41:09.441 --> 02:41:13.945
Steve, let's look at the FANWU paper because... It's a simple question, Dr. Kauffman.

02:41:14.005 --> 02:41:14.826
You don't know how long it is?

02:41:15.026 --> 02:41:16.348
There is no valid genome.

02:41:17.188 --> 02:41:20.852
I know how long they say it is, but... How long do they say it is?

02:41:21.272 --> 02:41:22.753
It's roughly 30,000 base pairs.

02:41:23.074 --> 02:41:24.475
Is it more than 30,000 or less than 30,000?

02:41:25.176 --> 02:41:26.377
Well, we can look at this paper.

02:41:26.397 --> 02:41:31.301
It has the exact number because this is the paper that... No, no, no, but their sequence... It's not that one, Livio.

02:41:31.341 --> 02:41:32.883
It's the fourth one, number four.

02:41:33.424 --> 02:41:38.949
There are sequences, Dr. Kaufman, from over 100 countries in the world.

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:52.502
And it's amazing, it's amazing that 100 countries all detect sequences of virtually the same length, with virtually the same structure, with minor differences here and there in the sequence.

02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:58.244
So it's a logic fallacy to say that just because something has been done by a lot of people that it means something.

02:41:58.844 --> 02:41:59.225
Really?

02:41:59.705 --> 02:42:01.206
Okay.

02:42:01.366 --> 02:42:02.928
So how do you know he had a virus?

02:42:03.648 --> 02:42:04.469
In what study?

02:42:04.529 --> 02:42:07.271
Fan Wu original genome paper that we discussed.

02:42:07.631 --> 02:42:09.553
Oh, I'll tell you why we know that.

02:42:09.613 --> 02:42:10.153
One patient.

02:42:10.453 --> 02:42:11.674
Yeah, I'll tell you why we know that.

02:42:12.615 --> 02:42:28.621
because because we've been able to replicate the genetic sequence it's a novel genetic sequence and we've been able to to find that genetic sequence in people in millions of people throughout the world never find the identical sequence twice okay but 12 million variants because every sequence is different

02:42:30.862 --> 02:42:38.348
No, no, no, because there are only about 30, in any given point in time, Dr. Kaufman, there are only about 30 or so variants that circulate.

02:42:38.388 --> 02:42:39.469
And that's amazing.

02:42:39.509 --> 02:42:45.934
So that's him defending to the teeth the theories that he learned from Kevin McKernan.

02:42:45.974 --> 02:42:48.716
And he's very confident because he believes Kevin McKernan.

02:42:49.356 --> 02:42:51.938
I think it's possible that Steve Kirsch is a bit of a dope.

02:42:52.799 --> 02:42:55.741
He probably doesn't know to the extent to which he's being used.

02:42:57.762 --> 02:43:03.083
He's never come off to me as somebody as a serial entrepreneur with good ideas all the time.

02:43:03.703 --> 02:43:09.425
Whenever he's been in this Steve Kerr steering committee, he's not the smartest guy in the discussion.

02:43:10.045 --> 02:43:14.586
The kinds of things he says do not suggest that he's an impressive, bright guy.

02:43:14.606 --> 02:43:21.188
I don't know, I just, I'm confused what's going on now.

02:43:25.626 --> 02:43:35.463
think I'm gonna have to put my thinking cap on because I don't I don't really get it anymore I'm starting to I'm starting to need a little help here I'm gonna put my thinking cap on and see where we go with

02:43:36.638 --> 02:43:38.839
I'm afraid this question is going to make me sad.

02:43:38.879 --> 02:43:40.479
That exist at any given point in time.

02:43:40.619 --> 02:43:43.100
This is not millions of variants.

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:49.402
There are right now at this moment, there are probably 30 different variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are prevalent in the United States.

02:43:49.422 --> 02:44:00.106
I mean, listen to the certainty that he knows how many variants are in circulation after five years of a release of an RNA molecule in a mud puddle or from a laboratory leak.

02:44:00.166 --> 02:44:01.386
It's just absurd.

02:44:01.987 --> 02:44:02.627
Come on.

02:44:06.559 --> 02:44:29.233
the states of america as an example it's not three hundred million thirty that's a scary very small number and i'm gonna ask a different question if that's okay uh... go for another boyson page the promo bit for this debate showed doctor kaufman talking about mislabeling deaths and hospital and nursing home protocols killing people early in the pandemic could doctor kaufman please expand on those get some

02:44:30.179 --> 02:44:34.861
And I'm not sure what they mean, because obviously those patients were sick, but I think I'm insinuating the protocols.

02:44:34.901 --> 02:44:37.403
How do you expand on all these deaths?

02:44:37.423 --> 02:44:41.505
This has been covered extensively, but it varied from place to place.

02:44:41.525 --> 02:44:44.006
New York was the place where they went crazy for ventilators.

02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:50.674
You know, put people on ventilators that were breathing on their own perfectly fine in various places in Europe.

02:44:51.175 --> 02:44:56.819
You had a lot of euthanasia type drugs like hospice treatments for people with an acute illness that were used.

02:44:56.859 --> 02:44:58.620
You know, it's been extensively reported on.

02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:05.325
There's also a lot of acutely ill hospital patients were sent to nursing homes where they couldn't receive any treatment because nursing homes are not equipped.

02:45:05.825 --> 02:45:06.225
to deal with.

02:45:06.285 --> 02:45:07.526
I wonder how they did that.

02:45:07.566 --> 02:45:09.406
Did they do that with dexamethasone?

02:45:09.446 --> 02:45:14.508
Because I think that's what Robert Malone said to Paul Cutrell in August of 21.

02:45:15.048 --> 02:45:22.471
Maybe, maybe Kaufman could point out that Robert Malone said they were murdering people with the hammer called dexamethasone.

02:45:23.331 --> 02:45:28.375
sending them back to care homes with limited symptoms and then letting them die of secondary ammonia.

02:45:28.395 --> 02:45:31.958
He's not really saying that they murdered people and lied about it though, is he?

02:45:32.498 --> 02:45:39.003
Certainly not saying that they gave him supplementary oxygen as a way to get them to an on-ramp where they would beg for a ventilator.

02:45:39.023 --> 02:45:49.291
He's certainly not saying that, yeah, you know, somebody like Kyle Seidel was pretty much set dead on about 60 liters a minute and thousands of liters of oxygen being used in every room.

02:45:52.319 --> 02:45:53.880
So, you know, there were a lot of different things.

02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:59.945
And then, of course, we had, you know, some of the toxic pharmaceuticals that were put into the, you know, COVID protocols that were reimbursed very well.

02:45:59.985 --> 02:46:02.486
And then, of course, ultimately, the poison injection.

02:46:02.547 --> 02:46:08.331
So, you know, this iatrogenic problem was, you know, explained quite a bit of the

02:46:08.951 --> 02:46:10.332
So the word is murder.

02:46:10.392 --> 02:46:11.693
The crime is murder.

02:46:11.713 --> 02:46:14.534
And at worst, it's manslaughter, but they're not saying that.

02:46:14.655 --> 02:46:16.215
Iatrogenic doesn't say it.

02:46:16.316 --> 02:46:17.756
Euthanasia doesn't say it.

02:46:17.856 --> 02:46:24.180
Murder and manslaughter, those are the words that are defined in all 50 states as crimes.

02:46:24.801 --> 02:46:25.741
You monkeys.

02:46:26.842 --> 02:46:32.525
Illness and the brief, you know, especially it was probably the major cause of that brief, short-lived mortality spike in the spring of 2020.

02:46:32.585 --> 02:46:35.127
The protocols in the hospitals, basically.

02:46:36.215 --> 02:46:38.917
Yeah, combined with the nocebo effect to a degree as well.

02:46:40.739 --> 02:46:43.421
Another question here from one concerned world citizen.

02:46:43.821 --> 02:46:47.664
When a family all gets a cold around at the same time, what do you think caused it?

02:46:48.825 --> 02:46:52.829
Well, this is, you know, once again, an example of a straw man, right?

02:46:52.849 --> 02:46:55.591
Because I'm saying there's no evidence that there's a virus causing it.

02:46:56.011 --> 02:46:58.193
So I don't know definitively what causes it.

02:46:58.213 --> 02:47:01.736
I, of course, have my own hypotheses, but they're not tested scientifically.

02:47:02.190 --> 02:47:03.811
I think it was a pretty good question.

02:47:03.831 --> 02:47:05.412
I think it was well phrased.

02:47:06.913 --> 02:47:08.975
I think they whiffed on it on purpose.

02:47:09.615 --> 02:47:12.397
He's gonna say that, right?

02:47:12.437 --> 02:47:19.322
But he's not gonna say that they lied about murdering people so that they could create the illusion of a virus.

02:47:19.342 --> 02:47:20.362
He's not saying that.

02:47:20.402 --> 02:47:22.003
I don't know why they're not saying that.

02:47:22.824 --> 02:47:29.869
I don't know why they're not connecting the criminal vaccine schedule in America to the same impetus that they have to cover this all up.

02:47:29.909 --> 02:47:31.390
It's gotta be all one play.

02:47:32.998 --> 02:47:40.044
The old vaccine schedule wasn't as good as the new ones because the new ones saved us from a pandemic that was probably a gain-of-function virus.

02:47:40.104 --> 02:47:45.950
Explain it to them that we were fooled into solving a mystery.

02:47:46.852 --> 02:47:51.693
that covered up the murder instead of, yeah, yeah, there were some people killed and that's true.

02:47:51.733 --> 02:47:56.235
There were some people killed in the hospital and some people were killed in nursing homes.

02:47:56.775 --> 02:48:06.738
No, those were the only deaths that they had to point to besides of course, the opioid deaths and the do not resuscitate orders that caused the heart attacks to go up.

02:48:08.819 --> 02:48:12.460
It's just such an imprecise, impotent explanation.

02:48:13.542 --> 02:48:27.187
of what actually happened, which they tried as many creative ways as possible to be able to murder people and lie about it in order to create the illusion of a gain-of-function pandemic and trick us into teaching our children this mythology.

02:48:29.628 --> 02:48:32.589
Instead, they've talked for an hour and a half and gotten nowhere.

02:48:32.629 --> 02:48:38.912
And even when someone from GigaOM Biological puts the ball on the tee and gives him a one-wood

02:48:45.137 --> 02:48:45.698
Just weak.

02:48:46.138 --> 02:48:47.119
It's just really weak.

02:48:47.199 --> 02:48:49.161
That's because they're traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

02:48:49.181 --> 02:48:50.883
They're all traitors.

02:48:51.143 --> 02:48:52.505
That's what you should see.

02:48:52.585 --> 02:48:54.427
They are all traitors.

02:48:54.867 --> 02:48:58.631
These people right here are all traitors.

02:48:58.771 --> 02:48:59.452
That's the deal.

02:48:59.632 --> 02:49:00.413
They're all traitors.

02:49:01.354 --> 02:49:04.777
Every single one of them is covering up the idea that

02:49:07.042 --> 02:49:10.644
that it's something more complicated than a conflated background signal.

02:49:10.664 --> 02:49:18.488
They're all covering up the idea that it's nothing more than a conflated background signal by debating the nuances of the Scooby-Doo.

02:49:18.948 --> 02:49:21.970
And that's how they're gonna get us to teach this shit to our children.

02:49:22.390 --> 02:49:24.891
If we don't wake up, they're gonna teach it to our children.

02:49:24.951 --> 02:49:31.635
I swear to you, they're gonna lie to us about laboratory viruses when the only thing they've ever done is transfect stuff.

02:49:32.515 --> 02:49:38.220
or stitch stuff together and then transfect that stitch stuff into a cell culture or an animal.

02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:39.741
Yes, they can make DNA.

02:49:39.761 --> 02:49:40.942
Yes, they can make RNA.

02:49:41.383 --> 02:49:42.904
Yes, they can make it in quantity.

02:49:42.924 --> 02:49:43.905
And that's about it.

02:49:44.005 --> 02:49:50.631
And a lot of these people have a resume with pharmaceutical companies to know damn well that that's true.

02:49:51.607 --> 02:50:07.262
Robert Malone knew damn well that you can't use anion exchange chromatography to purify RNA because you can't separate nucleic acids from each other using that standard technique for cleaning up any other biologic like a monoclonal antibody.

02:50:08.541 --> 02:50:13.466
There's no good reason why this guy was a court witness for the Floyd case.

02:50:13.506 --> 02:50:17.791
There's no good reason why he spoke in front of the Senate about what happened in New York City.

02:50:18.211 --> 02:50:26.240
And there's no good reason why those two facts weren't combined by the only person who was ever an expert on Pierre Kory and New York City.

02:50:29.683 --> 02:50:30.144
But you know,

02:50:31.291 --> 02:50:40.236
They're not biologists, so they can't evaluate the stuff that I teach, like intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:50:40.777 --> 02:50:44.599
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:48.361
So yeah, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

02:50:48.401 --> 02:50:53.504
We are kicking so much ass that they can't even respond to us anymore.

02:50:54.585 --> 02:50:55.886
And so we're gonna keep pushing.

02:50:57.836 --> 02:51:24.222
think of me as like somewhere between the Mike Ditka of biology like a linebacker and the Michael Jordan of biology like somebody is gonna dunk on him and they're gonna learn what's printed on the bottom of my shoes by the end of the frickin summer I can guarantee it ladies and gentlemen they're gonna be reading the print on the bottom of my shoes while I hang on the rim above them

02:51:26.305 --> 02:51:28.747
Because that's what we do at GigaOM Biological.

02:51:28.788 --> 02:51:33.913
Please stop all transfections in humans because they're trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:51:35.074 --> 02:51:38.738
And if you liked what you saw, this is GigaOM Biological.

02:51:38.778 --> 02:51:42.181
You can share it down there with stream.gigaom.bio.

02:51:42.782 --> 02:51:49.068
You can talk to me here at gigaom.bio and you can find ways to support me at the main website, gigaombiological.com.

02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:57.135
We do need support because this is a family of five and this is what we do This is what I do and this summer.

02:51:57.175 --> 02:52:06.523
I'm gonna be putting together some mini courses that they're already trying to respond to before they're out And I'm gonna use their silly responses and pre

02:52:08.224 --> 02:52:18.490
preceded courses like the one that Herdband and Bollschutz put out and we're going to use those courses as evidence as to how very little they want to do to help us.

02:52:20.171 --> 02:52:23.413
This is the summer of the wind.

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:30.918
This is going to be some serious stuff, ladies and gentlemen, and you're witnessing it in real life, real time, real time.

02:52:47.786 --> 02:52:49.347
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

02:52:49.868 --> 02:52:54.932
We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.

02:52:55.432 --> 02:52:55.672
Hit it.
