01:17.870 --> 01:27.977
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the, of America, of the American people is being used to create the crisis.

01:28.037 --> 01:31.940
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin maybe America.

01:32.080 --> 01:32.521
I don't know.

01:33.181 --> 01:34.042
Crash the dollar.

01:34.242 --> 01:34.662
I don't know.

01:35.203 --> 01:39.146
Steal the rest of our, our, what limited treasury value we have left.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.408
I don't know, but I know for sure.

01:42.793 --> 02:00.255
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

02:02.359 --> 02:09.105
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:09.525 --> 02:12.568
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:12.648 --> 02:22.096
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:22.116 --> 02:28.722
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:55.256 --> 02:55.357
Bye.

03:27.591 --> 03:33.773
Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man are going into this mic written by this hand, are coming out of this mouth made by this tongue.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.273
I tell you now, my man, my name is Young.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.354
But so you think that it's your destiny to get the best of me.

03:37.374 --> 03:38.674
But I suggest to be quiet, bro.

03:38.694 --> 03:39.274
Don't even try.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.475
From the east and west of me, taking it and never breaking it.

03:41.495 --> 03:43.475
So even shaking it, grooving it, and always moving it.

03:43.495 --> 03:44.315
Because I'm not faking it.

03:44.395 --> 03:46.156
Pulling out rhymes like books off the shelf.

03:46.676 --> 03:48.418
I'm going off, baby, there's no turning back.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.962
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette, and A-track.

03:51.042 --> 03:53.565
And when the show is finally finished, I'll be taking my bath.

03:53.605 --> 03:54.887
My name is Junga, yo, I got know-how.

03:54.927 --> 03:55.888
You know what I'm saying?

04:15.542 --> 04:18.224
Just like this, I got juice like the president.

04:18.284 --> 04:19.225
I'm making rappers hesitant.

04:19.285 --> 04:21.347
Invite me to your house, and I'll be chilling like a resident.

04:21.407 --> 04:25.070
Yes, because I'm that type of man, because I make myself at home no matter where I am.

04:25.210 --> 04:29.454
I got it rolling like thunder, making y'all wonder why I'm on top with all the other rappers under.

04:29.474 --> 04:31.696
I make no errors, mistakes, or blunders.

04:31.856 --> 04:32.576
It's like a wedding.

04:32.616 --> 04:33.577
Let no man put us under.

04:33.657 --> 04:34.418
My name is Young MC.

04:34.438 --> 04:37.480
I like to rhyme rhyme well, because when I get up on the mic, I just release my spell.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.661
It's no hocus pocus.

04:38.701 --> 04:39.502
I just get you into focus.

04:39.642 --> 04:39.942
Buss it.

05:50.822 --> 06:12.801
Moving all around above and under the ground You see my face and then you hear my sound Coming at you with the mic in hand I'm gonna take command just the way I planned Cause I'm a one man band and you are my fan Don't you understand I'm like Superman You're the man of steel don't you know the deal You better be for real I got sex appeal This is what I feel and this here's my vow And now you know the brother with know-how You know what I'm saying?

06:15.683 --> 06:18.366
I got know-how And I'm chillin'

06:19.898 --> 06:28.548
never healing in my mouth I got two feelings whatever I'm on a Mike Colston getting over my name as young as he known as the fly-catching over

07:16.665 --> 07:18.647
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

07:19.727 --> 07:24.411
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:25.951 --> 07:27.613
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.995
It's embarrassing.

07:40.026 --> 07:40.907
Good morning, everybody.

07:40.947 --> 07:46.673
Welcome to GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:49.482 --> 07:58.107
Your consciousness is indeed prime real estate, and it has been filled to the brim with misinformation and immunomythology.

07:59.168 --> 08:12.756
And GigaOM Biological is slowly evolving to try and replace that immunomythology with some real biology, and at the same time, trying to pivot our work into something that can stand the test of time.

08:14.008 --> 08:24.352
And that means that we're going to have to become a little more sophisticated than reminding you of liars every day, even though these charlatans are indeed the focus of our ultimate goals.

08:25.812 --> 08:34.075
Our day-to-day goals really need to be getting as much of this kind of information out as far and wide as possible.

08:34.095 --> 08:42.198
These are the main arguments of GigaOM Biological, and any discussion about them

08:43.598 --> 08:47.160
will bring us closer to the goal, closer to freedom.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.741
It doesn't matter if I'm not quite right about number one.

08:50.361 --> 08:55.644
It doesn't matter if 25 years from now, number two isn't totally true anymore.

08:55.704 --> 08:57.164
It doesn't matter if... if...

08:59.285 --> 09:03.627
Some viruses can be considered real.

09:04.307 --> 09:06.888
They're never going to be considered pattern integrities.

09:07.008 --> 09:13.091
And so this stream is brought to you by a guy who used to be an academician, an academic biologist.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.172
I hope my music wasn't too loud there.

09:18.053 --> 09:31.783
And gigaohm biological is actually derived from the word gigaohm to describe the high resistance seal that I used to use in order to make high resistance low noise recordings of individual neuronal activity and connections.

09:32.663 --> 09:37.805
And you can find a long history of my work on the internet at the National Library of Medicine.

09:37.845 --> 09:50.990
If you just look for my last name, a hyphen, and two Js, you will find all of those papers, including a last one in 2024 in Cell Reports, thanks to a good friend, Catherine Ruff.

09:54.229 --> 10:05.074
This mystery virus is definitely not responsible for excess deaths and there were lots of people that were hanging around at the beginning of the pandemic very, very early.

10:06.775 --> 10:11.177
Put in place to make sure that we couldn't figure out what this graph should really look like.

10:12.145 --> 10:29.393
put in place to make sure that we would never really figure out that the mystery virus isn't responsible for excess deaths, but a long list of bad ideas that were spread very vigorously as limited spectrums of debate by people that we were led to believe were heroes that were speaking out.

10:30.598 --> 10:39.990
And in the end, all of these people, including Tony Fauci's team, have agreed to ignore the possibility that there's maybe there's no evidence at all for the spread of something.

10:40.611 --> 10:42.553
And instead, all of them have accepted that.

10:43.134 --> 10:49.001
And instead, all of them have agreed not to talk about strict liability as an American legal idea.

10:49.662 --> 10:57.750
They've agreed not to talk about the Seventh Amendment or jurisdiction stripping as being legal ideas that are relevant to any of this stuff in America.

10:57.770 --> 11:04.736
Instead, we talk about free speech and censorship, and we need a new consensus about what transfection was before the pandemic.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.338
It was always criminally negligent.

11:06.798 --> 11:15.524
We need a new consensus about what RNA couldn't do before the pandemic, and it can't do what they have ascribed it to having done.

11:16.105 --> 11:23.190
And finally, we need to come to a new consensus that the vaccine schedule in the USA was already a criminal enterprise before the pandemic.

11:23.770 --> 11:31.656
And they would murder Americans and lie about it in order to cover that huge crime up.

11:32.648 --> 11:36.149
That's really the argument that GigaOM Biological is making.

11:37.170 --> 11:42.892
And so let me pull myself into the front here with a little less music.

11:45.352 --> 11:46.813
Thank you very much for joining me.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.273
I'm really glad you're here.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.455
It's a very nice morning here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

11:51.475 --> 11:51.575
It's 1119.

11:53.435 --> 12:16.731
on the 8th of August, and we are still dealing with this illusion of consensus that was created not just by Tony Fauci and Rand Paul on national television, not just created by the elaborate illusion theater of Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci and Ralph Baric and Shengli Shi and RATG 13 and Li Min Yan.

12:21.769 --> 12:35.141
but also by all the people that are on the screen right here that were involved in writing books and going on hundreds, not a few, but hundreds of podcasts to discuss the implications of a lab leak coverup.

12:35.902 --> 12:46.151
And this illusion of consensus was edified by there being a separate trap where you could just deny the existence of all viruses and all pathogenic

12:46.718 --> 12:51.846
you know, diseases and whatever, and then be completely out of the discussion entirely.

12:53.007 --> 13:00.158
And those were all ended up to be what I would consider traps that we were led into.

13:00.178 --> 13:02.241
And as a result, we have

13:03.396 --> 13:18.760
by no fault of our own, taught our children an immunomythology version of reality that includes ideas like, you know, we need to fear free-range RNA molecules, which is this little statement right here.

13:18.780 --> 13:21.761
I'm not very good at the weatherman thing with this particular

13:22.441 --> 13:22.881
screen.

13:24.082 --> 13:39.134
You know, I've been pointing out the fact and Mark Kulak has done an excellent job pointing out the fact that although it seems like we're hard on Robert Malone, Robert Malone seems to be a very big kink in their armor in terms of the story of understanding how the pandemic was set up before

13:40.695 --> 13:56.682
2020 by experts and by people behind the scenes who have been outbreak specialists for decades that also agreed that we needed to fear free-range RNA molecules, especially those with special attributes that could only be inserted by a person on a keyboard.

13:58.061 --> 14:13.299
And these, again, were reinforced years later by somebody who, in retrospect, was part of the ramp up of the behind the scenes acceptance of the idea that RNA molecules are dangerous in certain contexts.

14:13.799 --> 14:17.283
And in fact, she presented at the real event 201 in 2018, where

14:19.165 --> 14:28.056
where they discuss spike protein vaccines with none other than Kizmekia from Time Magazine cover.

14:28.677 --> 14:36.347
And it's just she's an NIAID grant recipient from Hong Kong.

14:39.221 --> 14:44.124
So, you know, years later, she's talking to Steve Kirsch and asking the questions, do viruses exist?

14:44.185 --> 14:45.686
Does SARS-CoV-2 exist?

14:45.786 --> 14:47.087
Is it a laboratory virus?

14:47.127 --> 14:48.528
What countries are responsible?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.229
And they walk right through the Scooby-Doo.

14:50.929 --> 14:52.851
You know, it's just terrible.

14:53.331 --> 14:59.195
It is a, it is a, what is it spelled?

14:59.215 --> 15:00.276
I think it's a, it's a,

15:01.471 --> 15:22.587
It's a crucial time right now for us to figure out how we can succinctly show this to college kids, that they can try to understand that this military industrial complex, this biosecurity state, would never have left the interpretation and sort of pursuit of truth to chance.

15:22.907 --> 15:24.908
But instead, they would have, of course,

15:25.762 --> 15:34.530
put agents everywhere that would be, you know, could catch the attention and seem to rise spontaneously through social media.

15:34.570 --> 15:38.153
People like Jessica Rose, who didn't rise spontaneously.

15:38.193 --> 15:39.794
She was carefully elevated.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.196
They're all ops.

15:42.600 --> 15:48.968
All of those people are probably ops or related to people, assisting people that are ops.

15:49.628 --> 15:50.610
And that's how they work.

15:50.670 --> 15:54.875
That's why they only promote each other on any of these social media platforms.

15:54.915 --> 15:59.961
They never promote the people that they think are, you think are also fighting with them.

16:00.381 --> 16:01.402
And that's why I use this.

16:02.323 --> 16:24.159
illustration to teach it is that you know I thought I was on Twitter and that I was gonna send the tweet that would save the world and I was gonna write the thread that would save the world and I was hoping and just praying that some of these people would eventually share my work and then that would finally get it to the stage where I could finally get my message out that you know synthetic DNA and synthetic RNA is

16:24.819 --> 16:27.920
is what RNA virology is based upon.

16:28.500 --> 16:34.101
And synthetic DNA and RNA is what all pharmaceutical biologics are based on.

16:34.522 --> 16:40.383
And synthetic DNA and RNA is what all transformation and transfection is based on.

16:40.963 --> 16:51.666
And synthetic and DNA and RNA are only things that you would need in order for all of the sequencing data and all of the PCR data to either be faked, manufactured, or buttressed.

16:53.107 --> 17:03.955
by signals that could be produced by a biosecurity state whose whole goal was to make sure that the populace in general would never come to these conclusions.

17:04.536 --> 17:14.264
The real biology, which is there are very few excuses for intramuscular injection being used to augment your immune system.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.885
And in fact, I can't think of any.

17:16.706 --> 17:20.609
There might be reasons to intramuscularly inject something that would

17:24.192 --> 17:30.137
that would modify your immune system, like an antibody, maybe you want to inject that intramuscularly.

17:31.078 --> 17:42.307
But there's no reason to state that injecting an antibody intramuscularly is better than a careful IV application of the same antibody.

17:42.367 --> 17:45.749
So again, here, I chose that language very,

17:47.438 --> 18:04.448
very carefully for a reason, because what they purport to have done with the childhood vaccine schedule before the pandemic is augment the immune system that is instructed to permanently change it, to alter it in a way that is beneficial to its owner.

18:04.909 --> 18:08.951
And these promises are ridiculous from a biological perspective.

18:10.052 --> 18:15.195
And so as we move forward, trying to help our young people understand why that's ridiculous,

18:16.280 --> 18:20.924
We need to be sure that we are already testing this language on people.

18:21.205 --> 18:29.613
Try to get them to give you an example of when intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system isn't done.

18:30.513 --> 18:33.616
When wouldn't it have been better to put that in

18:34.733 --> 18:35.213
the skin?

18:35.313 --> 18:39.756
When wouldn't it have been better for you not to have used some of those ingredients?

18:39.816 --> 18:44.438
When would it have been better for you to have tried to find a way to apply it orally?

18:44.498 --> 18:47.420
When would it have been better for you not to have done it at all?

18:48.180 --> 18:56.665
All of those questions are not asked just in the same way that we just kind of work on the idea that we don't have to worry about what breastfeeding does or doesn't do.

18:57.796 --> 18:59.237
We don't even want to worry about that.

18:59.297 --> 19:12.682
We wouldn't want to, for example, find out if children are twice as smart from breastfeeding moms than non-breastfeeding moms, because that would be really, really terrible for the people who can't breastfeed.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.683
That's how public health works right now.

19:16.064 --> 19:21.446
We are not trying to optimize the children that we produce in our society at all.

19:22.622 --> 19:27.966
We're not trying to think of optimizing the health of parents to optimize the health of children.

19:28.347 --> 19:31.009
We're not thinking of ourselves as pattern integrities.

19:31.029 --> 19:33.531
We're not thinking of ourselves as optimizable.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.713
We're not thinking of ourselves as having any responsibilities.

19:37.094 --> 19:41.958
You looked at that video we saw yesterday and a lot of those people were simply unhealthy.

19:43.442 --> 19:55.505
A lot of people in America are simply unhealthy and it just accepted as the way life is that none of their, they have no responsibility for where they are 25 years after they were 18 and not like they are now.

19:57.826 --> 20:02.507
And this is really all part of what social media has done to us.

20:05.563 --> 20:07.645
And it's done it over many, many years.

20:07.705 --> 20:29.327
And if we do not pull our heads out, our children will be the first generation of experimental humans that have always had their conceptions of reality shaped not by their experiences on bikes, or crashes on the street, or fights in the woods, or keg parties in machine sheds on the back of somebody's farm.

20:29.787 --> 20:41.192
their experiences will be and their idea of social reality will be wholly determined by the bullshit that they have seen on YouTube and TikTok and and Snapchat and this

20:44.349 --> 20:45.790
cannot be allowed to happen.

20:45.850 --> 20:50.934
And I don't think that we can move forward until all of us are on the same page about this.

20:51.414 --> 20:54.296
We cannot save the world using social media.

20:54.357 --> 20:57.559
We cannot learn about the world using social media.

20:57.599 --> 21:02.983
We learn about the world by following real people, communicating with real people.

21:06.707 --> 21:24.948
I hope I didn't waste too much time there by saying that, but I'm really feeling very strongly my kids are coming back tomorrow and one of the things that is going to change in terms of their habits as they come home is that we are going to be very aware of this in a way that we were aware of before, but

21:26.744 --> 21:32.368
I mean, my son is starting high school and there's a campaign to be had here.

21:32.929 --> 21:43.617
There is a real argument to be made that these weaponized piles of money using military technology on our kids' phones is immoral.

21:50.154 --> 21:54.356
And this illusion of consensus created by these people is ongoing.

21:54.476 --> 21:55.457
It's still going.

21:55.677 --> 22:05.102
And if we don't do something actively to reject it and to stop engaging in it, then it will continue to go on and rule our lives and the lives of those around us.

22:05.142 --> 22:10.865
We've got to be more vocal about the fact that there's no way to use social media healthily.

22:11.365 --> 22:15.687
We got to we got to get out there and say that there's, you know, you got to get off that stuff.

22:15.827 --> 22:21.410
Stop even engaging with people and what they saw on social media.

22:21.450 --> 22:25.271
The moment they say they saw something on social media, you got to say you got to get off of that.

22:26.332 --> 22:27.613
Even if it sounds interesting.

22:27.693 --> 22:29.794
First, you have to say you got to get off social media.

22:29.834 --> 22:30.574
What did you see again?

22:32.318 --> 22:38.043
Because by going on social media, you agree to get in the chair, you grab the joystick, and you're going to play Star Wars.

22:38.323 --> 22:41.526
And whether you like it or not, you can't win that game.

22:41.586 --> 22:51.714
You can't win that game because people like Jessica Hockett are willing to lie to you with people like Jonathan Engler, with people like Nick Hudson, with people like

22:52.214 --> 23:14.142
like Robert Malone, with people like Jessica Rose, with people like Kevin McCairn, with people like Kevin McKernan, with people like Sasha Latupova, with people like all of those people on the screen, including Tony Fauci, Peter Daszak, Ralph Baric, they're all willing to lie together on stage about things in order to participate in the governance of us.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.204
And they have been doing it for years.

23:22.952 --> 23:38.967
And the latest iteration of it on social media over the last four years is being ruled by, governed by, paid for by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, and that's what X and Rumble and Locals and

23:39.648 --> 23:54.419
Telegram and Gab and all of these new social media that have popped up that Jimmy Dore says Rumble is the free speech place and Russell Brand says the Rumble is the free speech place.

23:54.459 --> 24:04.246
This is just a place for us to do segregating on our own and give our personal data to certain other people so that they can use it for their own benefit.

24:05.168 --> 24:07.770
That's the only reason why Elon Musk bought Twitter.

24:08.170 --> 24:17.278
That's the only reason why anybody starts a social media platform, is to get information and profiles on people that are interesting.

24:19.099 --> 24:30.088
And all the better if we could be run around and rushed around, you know, oh, Robert Malone got censored on LinkedIn, so we're gonna have to follow him to Gab.

24:30.628 --> 24:32.770
Oh no, we'll have to follow him to Substack.

24:33.070 --> 24:33.531
Oh no.

24:35.299 --> 24:38.961
Bret Weinstein lost his monetization on YouTube.

24:39.081 --> 24:41.823
I'm gonna put my foot down and watch him on Rumble instead.

24:42.203 --> 24:46.345
And then I'm gonna go to the Q and A and locals, and I'm gonna show those bad guys.

24:49.082 --> 24:51.023
And that's all just part of this theater.

24:51.063 --> 24:54.405
You're just playing the game that they want you to play.

24:54.425 --> 24:56.586
You're running in the directions they want you to run.

24:57.087 --> 24:59.048
You got to start your own social media.

24:59.068 --> 25:03.930
You got to start your own, we've got to decentralize.

25:03.950 --> 25:06.812
We've got to get out of this trap that they have us in right now.

25:08.253 --> 25:12.075
And so that's kind of where I feel like I am right now.

25:12.135 --> 25:16.738
I feel like I'm on a spaceship trapped all by myself, losing my mind very slowly, but that's all right.

25:17.478 --> 25:27.282
Because I do think that we have a lot of happy things to look forward to, because we've got ourselves where we are now.

25:28.442 --> 25:29.403
We know where we are.

25:29.483 --> 25:31.003
We know how we feel about things.

25:31.064 --> 25:36.106
And now it's time to broaden our sort of scope of understanding.

25:36.146 --> 25:45.449
Because of course, what we've got to remind ourselves of is that, well, I have to remind myself of, is that I was completely asleep before the pandemic.

25:45.629 --> 25:46.610
Completely asleep.

25:47.418 --> 25:48.539
What does that really mean?

25:49.300 --> 25:54.546
It means that I was completely on the childhood schedule.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.288
I was completely okay with it.

25:56.568 --> 26:00.672
And I didn't really even wake up when they gave two shots to my newborn daughter in 2000.

26:01.293 --> 26:01.934
You see, this is,

26:05.051 --> 26:10.376
And so it's worth going back to see who was saying something beforehand.

26:10.556 --> 26:14.640
It's worth going back to see what people were saying beforehand.

26:14.700 --> 26:22.807
So I thought to go back to 2017 today and give Frontline a chance, PBS News a chance to

26:26.753 --> 26:36.941
to see what the discussion was in 2017 about vaccines and about public health in general, because I think you might be surprised.

26:37.441 --> 26:45.708
Most of us weren't paying attention to this, so most of us would have never watched a show on Frontline called Vaccines Calling the Shots.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.294
And in fact, remember what 2017 is.

26:50.435 --> 26:53.997
2017, I think, is a time when Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2 are going around.

26:54.537 --> 26:59.860
And there's a little bit of kerfuffle about the anti-vaxx movement.

26:59.900 --> 27:03.742
And so, of course, who comes to the rescue but PBS NewsHour?

27:04.843 --> 27:07.344
And so that's why I think it's going to be fun.

27:07.885 --> 27:09.385
Vaxxed was 2014, see?

27:09.646 --> 27:11.086
So we're in Vaxxed 2.

27:12.792 --> 27:23.560
And we're really at this crucial moment where I think there was a measles case that was going through courts that was still going through at the beginning of the pandemic.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.421
It just stopped.

27:24.661 --> 27:26.162
Those are things that I know less about.

27:26.702 --> 27:31.926
So it'll be interesting to see what was going on here.

27:31.986 --> 27:32.587
So here we go.

27:32.907 --> 27:35.389
Let's just try and get this going right away.

27:35.469 --> 27:39.472
I think it should just work because it should just work.

27:42.549 --> 27:42.849
Here I go!

27:42.889 --> 27:43.510
Invisible threat!

27:43.530 --> 27:46.231
You don't have to cough, you just have to breathe.

27:46.251 --> 27:47.952
It's the worst kind of contagion.

27:48.172 --> 27:49.993
It's airborne.

28:08.072 --> 28:12.096
Diseases largely unseen for a generation are returning.

28:12.856 --> 28:13.497
This can't be.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.158
This cow looks like she has measles.

28:15.739 --> 28:16.419
This is New York.

28:16.439 --> 28:18.601
We don't see measles in New York.

28:19.162 --> 28:24.506
It's astounding to me that you can have people dying of measles in the developed world.

28:25.627 --> 28:32.974
Today, children are getting sick and dying from preventable diseases as nervous parents skip their children's shots.

28:33.632 --> 28:42.358
You are injecting a substance into your child, so I think it's very natural to wonder whether that substance might actually be doing harm.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.299
There's just so much information.

28:44.319 --> 28:45.640
I don't know who to ask.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.961
Who am I supposed to trust?

28:49.962 --> 28:58.428
In a world of often conflicting information, parents are seeking what's best for their families, while doctors worry about losing lives.

28:58.988 --> 29:05.182
Your job is to try and save children's lives, and when you stand helplessly by and watch them die, it gets to you.

29:06.311 --> 29:11.775
We ask a lot of parents, we ask them to trust that we are recommending the best thing for their children.

29:12.816 --> 29:13.736
That's a big deal.

29:14.637 --> 29:22.302
The science behind vaccines, why they work, how they work, and how we decide to vaccinate or not.

29:22.823 --> 29:27.646
It's not about saying, oh my gosh, I'm afraid, and now that's the end of the conversation.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.547
No, that's just the start of the conversation.

29:30.548 --> 29:34.771
Vaccines, calling the shots, right now on Nova.

29:40.089 --> 29:42.489
Happy, healthy children.

29:42.689 --> 29:45.670
It's what every parent wants.

29:46.290 --> 29:52.131
And in this era of modern medicine, it's what most parents expect.

30:10.965 --> 30:16.287
Many dangerous diseases have all but disappeared, thanks in good part to vaccination.

30:17.768 --> 30:24.170
In the U.S., more than 90% of parents vaccinate their children, and most follow the recommended schedule.

30:27.331 --> 30:34.074
That's up to 28 immunizations in the first two years of life to protect against 14 different diseases.

30:37.568 --> 30:44.374
That's up to 28 immunizations in the first two years of life to protect against 14 different diseases.

30:48.417 --> 30:52.240
But today, powerful concerns are in circulation.

30:53.541 --> 31:00.286
I'm concerned about how many vaccines we have to give our children at once.

31:03.641 --> 31:08.543
So I'm kind of debating whether I will do them, but I'm debating the age.

31:08.883 --> 31:12.765
When should I have them done?

31:12.785 --> 31:15.867
There's just so much information there and I don't know who to ask.

31:16.147 --> 31:18.748
There's no such thing as an unbiased source.

31:19.748 --> 31:23.610
At least 10% of parents delay or skip some shots.

31:24.431 --> 31:26.892
Around 1% don't vaccinate at all.

31:27.772 --> 31:29.453
And in some places it's far higher.

31:31.127 --> 31:41.214
What's driving some people away from vaccines and what are the consequences for those who vaccinate and those who don't.

31:52.122 --> 31:52.382
Okay.

31:52.402 --> 31:54.003
So I'm already going to have a problem with this.

31:54.043 --> 31:56.745
Number one, because it's in Melbourne, Australia,

31:58.285 --> 32:01.447
Gotta go work with those crown royals.

32:04.069 --> 32:16.797
The other thing I'm gonna have a problem with is because they said people who vaccinate and people who don't, but now they're gonna tell you a story about whooping cough that I think you can't really vaccinate before they're like a few months old.

32:16.857 --> 32:22.981
And so if they're just gonna show us a premature baby that has what they call whooping cough, that's kind of like lame.

32:23.621 --> 32:32.132
What are you going to then make the argument that we should give babies the moment they come out of the hole a whooping cough vaccine too, but we don't because we're careful?

32:32.933 --> 32:33.994
Oh, it's going to be gross.

32:34.054 --> 32:35.016
I can feel it already.

32:43.612 --> 32:44.473
That sounds awesome.

32:44.933 --> 32:47.175
Osman Chandab is seven weeks old.

32:48.295 --> 32:54.240
He was due to be vaccinated against whooping cough in the next week, but the germ has gotten to him first.

32:56.882 --> 32:57.822
The germ.

32:58.383 --> 33:00.965
His mother brought him into the hospital two days ago.

33:02.045 --> 33:08.270
What started as a runny nose and slight cough has become frightening episodes where he's struggling to breathe.

33:12.145 --> 33:17.707
Whooping cough, or pertussis as it's formally known, can be life-threatening for babies.

33:18.447 --> 33:26.150
Whooping cough is caused by a really nasty bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, and it produces a toxin and it attacks the airways.

33:27.231 --> 33:34.494
I'm not a pediatrician, but I find myself thinking that I would have put the kid on my shoulder

33:35.314 --> 33:42.538
and lifted his butt up and pushed him over my shoulder so that he was kind of coughing over my shoulder and with less verticality.

33:42.578 --> 33:51.043
And instead they sat the kid up in a bed who's not strong enough in his spine to hold his body up yet.

33:51.123 --> 33:59.168
And then tried to make him cough like that instead of letting him lay on his chest on my shoulder like you would burp a baby after.

33:59.188 --> 34:02.610
I mean, it's so bizarre to watch people

34:03.547 --> 34:26.829
Handle babies that don't handle them the way that we were taught to handle them in Norway Like we had three days in a hospital where we had infinite access via a string pull To people that would come in and ask any dog answer any dumb question that we had Help me change the diaper or you know, am I being too rough or how hard can I wipe the little babies?

34:26.949 --> 34:28.591
you know all this stuff like

34:29.311 --> 34:42.802
It's so crazy to me, in retrospect, how little effort we put into educating people about parenthood, about children, and about development.

34:43.963 --> 34:56.693
Because, of course, there used to be a time when we would just tell pregnant women that you can't really wear your makeup anymore, you shouldn't use any more of your cosmetics, you can't eat any of this non-pasteurized cheese or sushi.

34:56.733 --> 34:57.934
I mean, you're pretty much done.

35:00.783 --> 35:01.323
And why?

35:01.403 --> 35:07.925
Because the baby is most vulnerable during development, which isn't over after the babies come out of the womb.

35:08.025 --> 35:15.608
Otherwise, of course, they would come out of the womb and then run around in the backyard a couple hours later, like a fawn.

35:16.488 --> 35:19.449
But they come out of the womb, but they're still developing.

35:19.549 --> 35:29.872
So the idea that just because they came out, we can give them intramuscular injections and augment their immune system because we know how development works.

35:30.925 --> 35:33.907
This is the biggest lie of all.

35:34.888 --> 35:57.183
And so what you're hearing here in this video, which I find extraordinary, is the subtle discussion of the idea that delaying vaccines might have a biological basis in reality, but they're never actually gonna say what that biological basis would be, even though they're gonna show you a lot of moms who are gonna say, well, I'm not sure whether I'm gonna do it, I'm just gonna delay it.

35:59.480 --> 36:10.209
don't talk about how you would delay it or what biological mechanisms and biological basis for which you might say that even if they were necessary, why would you delay it?

36:10.249 --> 36:26.403
Well, again, because they don't wanna talk about the fundamental biology of humans, which is that, you know, when a baby comes out, you're a mammal and the definition of a mammal is mammals, mammillary glands, it's breastfeeding.

36:27.389 --> 36:42.940
And so one of the most important things that is emphasized in Norway when you have their first baby is that it doesn't matter whether you have big boobs or little boobs or flat this or round this or long ones or short ones.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.522
Every mom can breastfeed.

36:48.439 --> 36:57.181
And only in extreme cases will these people allow you to get into the mindset of you're not gonna breastfeed your baby for the first couple months.

36:57.221 --> 36:59.442
Like that's like ridiculous.

36:59.582 --> 37:06.744
That would be like saying, yeah, I'm just gonna put a dog dish out in their room with baby food and hope they find it.

37:07.624 --> 37:14.686
Like, no, this is a fundamental part of who we are as sovereign,

37:17.199 --> 37:19.581
God created beings.

37:20.461 --> 37:27.987
It's a fundamental aspect of our identity and it is a fundamental aspect of what it means to be a woman and a mom.

37:28.467 --> 37:31.450
And yes, there are times when it doesn't work.

37:31.490 --> 37:38.295
There are times when it can't go for four years, it goes for four months or whatever, but the idea

37:39.989 --> 37:49.917
that in America, we have basically given up on that as being a central aspect of what is coming in the next nine months.

37:50.158 --> 37:53.080
We need to start talking about what you're about to do.

37:54.601 --> 37:59.546
And in Norway, they started talking about what you're about to do months before the baby came.

38:00.066 --> 38:08.153
These people are only concerned about whether or not these women are going to take their recommendation about vaccines.

38:10.270 --> 38:25.497
They don't probably have any formulated opinion about the necessity, the beauty, the absolutely impossible to underestimate the potential benefits of breastfeeding.

38:27.762 --> 38:32.004
And now I'm not trying to say this to take a stand and make some people feel bad or whatever.

38:32.384 --> 38:43.670
What I want you to see is the direction that big picture biology in America should be going as we go forward trying to teach our children what's real about them.

38:45.752 --> 38:52.195
What's real about being a man, what's real about being a woman, and what's real about being a father, and what's real about being a mother.

38:57.828 --> 39:17.598
And with regard to boiling down parenting to decisions about injections is exactly the goal of this apparatus that one of the most amazing and malevolent parts of is Frontline and PBS and all the shit that they make.

39:20.703 --> 39:24.388
And see it for what it is, because this is really what it is.

39:24.708 --> 39:29.294
They have been busy with this back before we were paying attention.

39:30.916 --> 39:34.060
Because we didn't have kids, because we were the kids.

39:35.945 --> 39:41.029
And compared to when we were kids, this is not the same.

39:41.610 --> 39:49.336
You did not get 28 shots in two years for 14 diseases.

39:49.516 --> 39:57.442
I know for sure I have not gotten 28 shots in the first two years of my life for the total of 14 diseases.

39:58.928 --> 40:05.111
And so this has been a very slow progression and a very slow development.

40:05.271 --> 40:10.213
And it doesn't matter where you draw the line, it is a criminal enterprise at present.

40:11.294 --> 40:24.520
And it was a criminal enterprise before the pandemic, as is evidenced by this PBS NewsHour bullshit, 28 shots in two years is the recommended schedule in 2017.

40:27.046 --> 40:29.969
Imagine including COVID in there.

40:32.212 --> 40:35.235
Imagine an mRNA for RSV in there.

40:39.560 --> 40:46.929
We are at a crucial moment, ladies and gentlemen, where everyone can wake up and realize that something is very, very wrong here.

40:47.932 --> 40:52.217
And it isn't the people that are following Robert Malone that we need to wake up.

40:52.257 --> 40:55.121
It isn't the people that are following Jessica Rose that we need to wake up.

40:55.161 --> 40:59.166
We need to wake up the other 70% or 90% or 99% of the world who doesn't know who these performers are even.

41:08.066 --> 41:16.131
Those performers were used against us because we were awake early on social media, trying to use social media to wake up our friends.

41:16.771 --> 41:22.734
And so we were the ones that the Lollapalooza of liars engaged with.

41:22.815 --> 41:25.976
We were the ones that they DM'd on Twitter.

41:26.297 --> 41:29.158
We were the ones that, don't you see?

41:31.680 --> 41:36.062
The rest of these people are still here because they were there in 2017.

41:38.737 --> 41:58.709
trying to use mainstream media and PBS NewsHour to understand what anti-vaxxers are and why there was measles in New York and why everybody's getting into a hoopla about what people said on the Today Show or what Jim Carrey and his wife at the time said on Oprah or whatever.

42:00.925 --> 42:16.683
This is the response to that, the update to it, the, you know, obviously those people are crazy version from PBS News, from Frontline, and you see right now that it is all about taking our children, and it always has been.

42:18.184 --> 42:21.728
It has just crescendoed to an absurd level now.

42:22.645 --> 42:39.538
in the pandemic and we need to be aware that we're still at that absurd level because in 2017, it was 28 shots in the first two years and now you have to add COVID and RSV at minimum to that list of recommendations that a lot of pediatricians are gonna be giving.

42:40.659 --> 42:50.206
Some of those pediatricians are gonna be recommending that these women are taking a COVID shot in pregnancy, a flu shot in pregnancy.

42:52.168 --> 42:56.072
So we are far past the point of no return for these people.

42:56.132 --> 43:07.405
They need to be re-educated in terms of what biology they are violating, what fidelity has been exaggerated, and how they're not the experts they think they are.

43:12.270 --> 43:16.191
And we need to have some of those people on the show at some point.

43:16.211 --> 43:17.411
We need to challenge them to join us.

43:17.431 --> 43:20.691
It causes a really nasty bronchitis, and they get really sticky.

43:20.731 --> 43:23.532
There's a lot of ways to get really nasty bronchitis.

43:23.552 --> 43:28.293
There's a lot of ways to get really sticky phlegm that's hard to cough out.

43:30.173 --> 43:35.874
You can get really sticky phlegm that's hard to cough out if you take anybody with bronchitis and then dehydrate them, for example.

43:35.894 --> 43:37.834
Sticky, thick phlegm that they can't shift.

43:38.475 --> 43:40.715
And they try to, and that causes them to cough.

43:41.840 --> 43:46.301
And why do we need to be in an Australian hospital seat of shit?

43:48.061 --> 43:49.522
Wow, that was a terrible accent.

43:49.542 --> 43:51.882
Like you're putting him in the worst position possible.

43:51.942 --> 43:53.302
Like it's straight up.

43:53.322 --> 43:54.463
What are you doing to that baby?

44:07.870 --> 44:10.112
What is that, a 16-year-old nurse here?

44:10.152 --> 44:14.975
Holy shit!

44:14.995 --> 44:19.098
Yeah, just like that, that's perfect Why don't you just let him drown in it?

44:19.118 --> 44:22.861
Oh, man, play the sad music His body's gotta fight it Boy, oh boy

44:38.863 --> 44:43.448
A generation ago, whooping cough was rarely seen in developed countries.

44:44.029 --> 44:45.271
Now, it's back.

44:47.133 --> 44:49.876
A generation ago, we didn't have whooping cough.

44:51.138 --> 44:56.424
Because everybody followed the vaccine schedule that wasn't 28 shots in two years, of course.

44:59.252 --> 45:24.740
Imagine the possibility that the hep B shot or the vitamin K shot that that kid got a couple three four days before is what caused him to have a respiratory bronchitis To be susceptible in the first place But already we don't know did that kid get a hep B shot You know when it just came out of the womb like my daughter did Did she get a bite?

45:24.780 --> 45:26.501
Did he get a vitamin K shot, you know?

45:28.663 --> 45:30.904
Because that is a puncture, okay?

45:31.344 --> 45:33.245
Whether you like it or not, it's a puncture.

45:33.705 --> 45:35.206
It's a puncture that occurs, what?

45:35.826 --> 45:40.949
Seconds after a relatively, let's say, liquid birth?

45:42.530 --> 45:43.450
It's a puncture.

45:43.830 --> 45:53.355
You know, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing that's on my leg right here.

45:55.407 --> 45:58.210
That huge, that was all red yesterday.

45:58.850 --> 46:01.753
All the way around to the back and it was all the way red down here.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.915
You saw it, it's still swollen up, but the red's gone.

46:04.375 --> 46:12.102
And it all came through this, this piece of, of eczema here on my leg, which is actually oftentimes not that bad.

46:13.743 --> 46:19.629
But it's, that's a puncture in my skin that allows bacteria to get in and me to almost lose a leg.

46:22.622 --> 46:39.876
And the same thing can happen in your lungs where a bacteria or bacteria, multiple kinds of bacteria, breach the barrier of your lungs and cause a systemic infection that will have all the same symptoms as what I had last weekend when I had this infection that started through a hole in my leg.

46:41.917 --> 46:46.361
I had fever and chills, cold sweats, muscle aches.

46:48.049 --> 46:53.156
The only reason why I didn't call it the flu was because I had nothing in my stomach and nothing in my lungs.

46:53.216 --> 46:58.444
But understand that the only other barriers besides your skin are your gut and your lungs.

46:58.504 --> 47:03.811
And so if those barriers are broken, just in the same way that my leg was broken,

47:05.148 --> 47:13.438
then you're gonna have a bacterial infection that exposes you to endotoxins from the bacteria that is a general signal for inflammation.

47:13.818 --> 47:20.346
And that if that gets out of control, you can have muscle aches and you can have fevers and you can have all of the things.

47:21.187 --> 47:25.192
And if it was a breach in your lungs, then you're gonna have lung.

47:26.909 --> 47:29.991
You're going to have symptoms and pain and inflammation in your lungs.

47:30.071 --> 47:35.354
If it was a break in your gut, you're going to have pain and inflammation in your gut.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.514
You might have diarrhea.

47:38.115 --> 47:38.875
Don't you see?

47:41.797 --> 47:46.840
There's a really good understanding for how sickness evolves in humans.

47:46.880 --> 47:52.843
There's a real good reason for almost all of it, especially that which involves

47:54.386 --> 47:56.647
generalized symptoms at a barrier.

47:57.407 --> 48:05.690
Bronchitis, upset stomach and nausea, swelling and inflammation in the skin.

48:07.491 --> 48:15.054
The difference is, is that puncturing the skin gets you to a place that is less likely to cause you trouble.

48:16.695 --> 48:19.856
I didn't notice that it was my, where the barrier was broken.

48:20.697 --> 48:31.904
I knew that I was having muscle aches and I knew I was having fever, but because my lungs weren't upset, because my stomach wasn't upset, I didn't understand what was going on because I didn't know what barrier was broken.

48:32.345 --> 48:36.948
And it's very easy to understand when you have a respiratory disease that that barrier may be broken.

48:37.508 --> 48:43.993
And if that barrier gets broken at the lungs, your body needs to panic very quickly because the lungs, of course, has access.

48:44.513 --> 48:48.716
The lungs is a very thin barrier, so your immune system is very well represented there.

48:48.756 --> 48:50.577
The inflammation can kick off immediately.

48:51.737 --> 49:05.220
Whereas a breach in the skin, yes, you have immune system there, but the immune system in the skin is a lot slower and it's a lot more diffuse because the skin is a lot more impenetrable, at least when it's healthy.

49:08.661 --> 49:20.143
And so as we move forward, understand that this, our basic understanding and model of how our immune system protects us and how a breach of the immune system manifests

49:21.789 --> 49:26.050
doesn't require the existence of pathogenic viruses, it doesn't require it.

49:26.090 --> 49:40.974
And in fact, it, it almost everything that we can sense kind of suggests that that that's definitely not what we need to worry about that any breach of the barrier that allows bacteria in his in the end, the one that will kill us.

49:44.127 --> 50:10.154
And so if you start to think about these signals, again, as a background noise, if you start to think of these signals, at least in terms of how they are understood, produced, and studied in the laboratory, and how they are akin to the manufacture of biologics in the pharmaceutical industry, you will see that there are giant mountains of explanations for the pandemic that don't involve

50:10.934 --> 50:26.435
a sickness spreading around the world, but involve a coordinated group of liars and a bunch of unwitting accomplices that aren't sophisticated enough in their understanding of the irreducible complexity of biology to understand that it is trivial.

50:27.509 --> 50:29.730
to explain that RNA can't pandemic.

50:29.790 --> 50:36.392
It's trivial to explain why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

50:36.872 --> 50:43.014
And it is trivial to explain why transfection and transformation were always criminally negligent before the pandemic.

50:43.074 --> 50:49.376
And therefore, because RNA can't pandemic, they were criminally negligent at the start of 2021.

50:52.742 --> 50:56.363
Got off track a little bit, sorry about that.

50:56.443 --> 51:01.384
In 2012, there were nearly 50,000 cases in the US and 20 deaths.

51:04.664 --> 51:08.645
Babies too young to get the Pertussis shot may have no protection.

51:09.525 --> 51:10.046
Pertussis.

51:10.066 --> 51:18.947
And because the vaccine's effectiveness can wear off after a few years, older children and adults without boosters are also vulnerable.

51:20.848 --> 51:21.728
Older adults?

51:23.883 --> 51:31.849
Since the beginning of our young century, there have been outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases flaring up like so many wildfires.

51:32.169 --> 51:34.611
I mean, what is the goal with vaccination then?

51:34.671 --> 51:40.335
Does that mean that everybody dies of old age where they are just like, dude, I'm done.

51:40.696 --> 51:42.157
Like, I don't want to be here anymore.

51:42.177 --> 51:43.117
I don't have any friends.

51:43.197 --> 51:43.778
I'm out of here.

51:43.798 --> 51:47.361
And since I can't die of a disease anymore because they keep vaccinating me,

51:48.486 --> 51:51.128
Um, I'm going to need some euthanasia or something like that.

51:51.188 --> 51:52.609
Like what is the goal here?

51:52.629 --> 51:53.930
I don't even understand it.

51:54.171 --> 52:12.785
If, uh, if, if you try to imagine that it's just, it's about something more than turning us into pin cushions, animals, experimental animals, and you, you need shots when you're old is what made me lose two friends so far, at least two very recently.

52:12.865 --> 52:16.248
I mean, like old people that should never be taking a transfection.

52:17.719 --> 52:26.262
are allowing themselves to be transfected and to be immunized against all kinds of things that 10 years ago we had no immunizations for.

52:26.882 --> 52:35.624
Whose grandmother, like mine who's gone already, God rest her soul, whose grandmother was vaccinated when she was 70 plus years?

52:35.644 --> 52:38.805
Nope, they never tried to vaccinate my grandmother for anything.

52:42.086 --> 52:44.447
So this is just opening a business opportunity.

52:47.011 --> 52:48.932
And that's a very, how do I say it?

52:48.972 --> 52:51.893
That's a very generous way to look at it.

52:54.254 --> 53:06.019
Trying to avoid the cost of people living longer and longer and unhealthily living longer and longer because our Western medical system is capable of keeping them alive.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.820
That sounds a lot more like what this is.

53:11.661 --> 53:13.542
In 2011, there were over 30,000 measles cases across Europe.

53:17.423 --> 53:21.927
Although the disease is often mild, thousands had serious complications.

53:22.568 --> 53:23.308
Eight died.

53:23.989 --> 53:24.229
Eight?

53:24.469 --> 53:27.952
In 2012, the outbreak continued in the United Kingdom.

53:28.713 --> 53:32.116
In 2013, it made the leap to the United States.

53:32.736 --> 53:35.639
Wow, so this is all one continuous outbreak over three years.

53:35.679 --> 53:36.740
You see how they sold that?

53:36.800 --> 53:37.881
The outbreak continued.

53:39.362 --> 53:43.306
A young American traveled from London to Brooklyn, infected with the virus.

53:46.414 --> 53:51.136
He returned home to his tight-knit, orthodox community, where most people vaccinate.

53:51.976 --> 53:55.798
But he came from a group of families strongly opposed to vaccines.

53:59.399 --> 54:03.641
Measles quickly spread through unvaccinated families living in the same building.

54:06.983 --> 54:09.124
And then, out into the community.

54:10.624 --> 54:14.846
Children were hardest hit, especially those too young to be vaccinated.

54:21.753 --> 54:28.215
First case that I saw was a 12-month-old girl that came into the office with mom because of a rash.

54:29.075 --> 54:33.116
And I'm looking at this child, examining this child, and I'm like, this can't be.

54:33.456 --> 54:34.857
This child looks like she has measles.

54:34.877 --> 54:39.398
I've never actually seen measles, but I've seen them in textbooks, never in real life.

54:40.078 --> 54:42.499
So I was a little taken aback.

54:43.799 --> 54:45.660
Three or four days later, perhaps, we had another case.

54:46.505 --> 54:47.666
And then the next day, another case.

54:48.006 --> 54:48.707
And then another one.

54:48.727 --> 54:51.449
And it just started getting overwhelming.

54:51.469 --> 54:52.189
Like, wait a second.

54:54.711 --> 54:57.373
The Department of Health tried to stop the spread.

54:58.554 --> 55:02.517
The thing about measles is it's droplet spread.

55:02.617 --> 55:07.040
So, for example, you know, your respiratory secretions if someone coughs.

55:07.580 --> 55:08.941
But it's also airborne.

55:09.382 --> 55:15.106
So the virus can sort of hang out in the air for up to two hours.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.144
Virus hangs around in the air for two hours.

55:20.205 --> 55:20.686
Here we go.

55:20.826 --> 55:22.430
Graphic representation.

55:22.450 --> 55:26.860
Infected man with the white flag on his back.

55:29.006 --> 55:36.513
Already watching, already using security cameras to give you the idea that, wow, maybe we should be monitoring people like this.

55:36.533 --> 55:36.633
Oh my.

55:36.653 --> 55:37.934
The worst kind of contagion is airborne.

55:37.954 --> 55:38.995
That's a nice one.

55:55.881 --> 56:00.883
90% of people who are exposed to the virus and don't have immunity get the disease.

56:05.105 --> 56:10.807
In this instance, two hours later, another unvaccinated person entered the same elevator.

56:11.868 --> 56:15.189
A week or so later, he too became... Nah, you're not gonna eat that all up.

56:17.021 --> 56:21.304
It was a very brief encounter, you know, seconds in an elevator.

56:21.324 --> 56:25.828
It just speaks to how infectious measles is.

56:26.148 --> 56:30.491
It will find those people who are unprotected in a community.

56:32.737 --> 56:38.901
In three months, more than 3,500 people were exposed to the measles virus in the Brooklyn area.

56:40.082 --> 56:44.824
58 were infected, including two pregnant women, one miscarried.

56:44.844 --> 56:45.925
Uh-oh, there it is.

56:45.945 --> 56:49.007
All were confirmed as unvaccinated at the time of infection.

56:49.067 --> 56:49.427
Wow.

56:49.867 --> 56:56.171
Measles was declared eliminated back in 2000, and so this was the largest outbreak since elimination.

56:58.273 --> 57:00.114
It's like telling me, look, we found smallpox.

57:01.437 --> 57:02.498
Smallpox was eradicated.

57:02.518 --> 57:04.159
No one sees measles.

57:04.279 --> 57:05.000
Who sees measles?

57:05.340 --> 57:08.242
Yeah, you'll see measles in third world countries and other countries.

57:08.283 --> 57:09.704
This is New York.

57:10.304 --> 57:11.885
We don't see measles in New York.

57:18.110 --> 57:24.936
Around the world, pockets of low vaccination are appearing, often in affluent, mainstream communities.

57:26.798 --> 57:32.968
Anthropologist Heidi Larson studies why people do or don't place trust in vaccines.

57:34.295 --> 57:41.161
There isn't just a world polarized between pro and anti-vaccine populations.

57:42.102 --> 57:50.389
There's 80 plus percent in the middle who it's either just a social norm, it's good for our children and for our public health.

57:51.170 --> 57:55.013
Others that are starting to question and a certain amount of questioning is healthy.

57:55.534 --> 58:00.158
And then there's some that are starting to get more anxious and are vulnerable to

58:00.658 --> 58:07.555
tipping into becoming against vaccines if they don't feel like they're getting the right information or they're not being heard.

58:11.676 --> 58:18.560
Gabriella Motsman wants to vaccinate her two children, but she's chosen not to follow the recommended vaccine schedule.

58:18.580 --> 58:19.681
Here we go.

58:19.701 --> 58:25.185
So the plan is to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible, but we're doing one vaccine at a time.

58:25.665 --> 58:27.886
I don't know if that's the right way.

58:27.906 --> 58:29.287
I don't even know where I came up with that.

58:29.327 --> 58:29.908
Yeah, I don't know.

58:30.548 --> 58:34.951
Julia Pace has a four-year-old and is expecting another child soon.

58:35.551 --> 58:38.113
She delayed vaccinating her oldest till she was three.

58:39.241 --> 58:42.582
I was concerned that her immune system couldn't handle it, and we just waited.

58:43.302 --> 58:48.043
My son and her, they're not vaccinated yet, and my older ones don't have boosters.

58:49.024 --> 58:51.144
Where are those people from?

58:51.684 --> 58:55.205
She vaccinated at first, but then one child had a seizure.

58:55.225 --> 58:58.266
I mean, they're not Americans.

58:58.966 --> 59:01.107
And I am worried about the diseases.

59:01.687 --> 59:04.168
Isn't that strange how they're not talking to Americans?

59:04.528 --> 59:05.408
That, I mean,

59:06.752 --> 59:13.214
They could be Americans, like, you know, they live here and stuff, but I mean, they're not, it's not third generation Americans here.

59:13.254 --> 59:16.855
These are relatively new immigrant women moms.

59:16.895 --> 59:17.996
That's strange to me.

59:18.116 --> 59:19.036
I find it strange.

59:19.136 --> 59:20.217
Confused, really.

59:21.637 --> 59:33.181
In America, children must be vaccinated before they start kindergarten, but the required shots vary from state to state, and most allow for exemptions based on personal or religious beliefs.

59:34.042 --> 59:37.565
Here in California, almost 3% of children are exempt.

59:38.126 --> 59:39.907
And in some schools, it's more than 30%.

59:41.337 --> 59:43.778
I have a lot of friends who don't vaccinate at all.

59:43.838 --> 59:50.259
And if you say vaccine around them, they look at you like you are literally, well, you know, like you are poisoning your child.

59:51.059 --> 59:58.161
On the other hand, you have parents that can't even understand why this is even a question.

59:58.741 --> 01:00:04.143
Nobody is willing to really have a conversation with you and discuss what's the severe reaction.

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:06.423
Is it OK to have a seizure?

01:00:06.443 --> 01:00:09.984
I would really like to know what the real risks are.

01:00:13.206 --> 01:00:14.910
Is it okay to question vaccines?

01:00:15.372 --> 01:00:15.953
Of course it is.

01:00:16.815 --> 01:00:18.038
It's a start of a conversation.

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:18.880
Look at this guy.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.986
This is something worthy of being concerned about.

01:00:22.045 --> 01:00:26.926
He's never spoken to a single person who thinks that their kid was injured by a vaccine.

01:00:26.946 --> 01:00:33.588
He's never spoken to a single doctor who would say that they've treated kids that were definitely injured by vaccines.

01:00:33.628 --> 01:00:34.548
And this is the trick.

01:00:35.388 --> 01:00:48.471
Just like you can go on stage like Robert Malone and say that I had long COVID and so I know what long COVID is, but Robert Malone's never gonna talk to any of those people that we watched in the movie yesterday to listen to them.

01:00:49.707 --> 01:00:56.069
to listen to that girl that was sitting in front of the keyboard and the two speakers about how her condition existed before COVID.

01:00:57.677 --> 01:01:09.183
Robert Malone's never going to go and try and find people whose immune system was dysregulated before the pandemic in a lot of the same ways that long COVID dysregulates people, because that's not his role.

01:01:09.223 --> 01:01:19.508
His role is to make sure that you believe in the novel virus, that millions of people were infected, that thousands got so long COVID and that many more were saved by the shot.

01:01:20.949 --> 01:01:22.750
And that's always been his role.

01:01:24.537 --> 01:01:30.839
And so this guy is going to try and tell us that he knows something about something that he's never talked to anyone about.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:40.363
He's just read things and he's talked to people who have talked to people, I guess, just like these, this narrative was controlled.

01:01:40.443 --> 01:01:46.125
Now it was already being controlled back then by people who would play along this.

01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:51.227
Scientists, Brian Zickman, Fisher studies, how we think about risk.

01:01:53.615 --> 01:02:00.638
He's based at the University of Michigan where, in this hall in 1955, the first polio vaccine was announced.

01:02:01.519 --> 01:02:09.683
Fifty years ago, you asked any parent, any grandparent, about polio, about measles, about pertussis.

01:02:10.598 --> 01:02:12.260
and they knew cases.

01:02:13.181 --> 01:02:15.624
It was part of their daily existence.

01:02:16.545 --> 01:02:27.356
What's changed now is that we've done such a good job of vaccinating most, not all, most people in our communities, that they are rare.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:29.138
I have never seen it.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.680
Why should I be concerned about this?

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.546
The history of vaccines is clear.

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:42.109
If you start to decrease vaccine immunization rates, you start to see the diseases reemerge.

01:02:42.129 --> 01:02:43.210
Gosh, he's awful.

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.231
It's a history that we don't seem to learn from.

01:02:46.192 --> 01:02:46.792
Look at him.

01:02:46.812 --> 01:02:49.073
Will Offit is an infectious disease expert.

01:02:49.634 --> 01:02:56.438
He helped invent a vaccine to protect against rotavirus disease, which kills hundreds of thousands of children worldwide.

01:02:57.418 --> 01:03:02.862
As a pediatrician, he's witnessed firsthand children dying from preventable diseases.

01:03:03.815 --> 01:03:04.855
Skulls, why not?

01:03:05.735 --> 01:03:07.956
What a great choice for a background.

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:12.417
For example, in 1991, in the city of Philadelphia, there was a massive measles epidemic.

01:03:13.077 --> 01:03:17.778
Of the nine children who died during that 1991 epidemic, seven of them died in our hospital.

01:03:17.838 --> 01:03:21.079
So we had to stand by and watch while we tried to support them.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:25.280
And you know, as doctors, your job is to try and save children's lives.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.701
And when you stand helplessly by and watch them die, it's...

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:31.790
It just it gets to you.

01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:34.011
Oh my gosh, what a liar.

01:03:35.773 --> 01:03:42.337
Human history is scarred with stories of deadly germs destroying lives.

01:03:42.357 --> 01:03:46.559
500 years ago, about one in three children died before the age of five.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.242
But then we began to fight back.

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:53.884
What are we gonna say?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:04:00.414
Surprisingly, vaccination evolved from a type of traditional medicine at least 1,000 years ago.

01:04:01.695 --> 01:04:08.481
In India, when a wave of smallpox approached a town, there are tales of people doing something extraordinary.

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:12.044
They lined up to actually buy the disease.

01:04:15.106 --> 01:04:18.669
Brahmin healers would take a cloth and rub the person's upper arms.

01:04:21.934 --> 01:04:25.535
Then they would scratch the skin, just enough to draw blood.

01:04:26.856 --> 01:04:32.438
Finally, they would apply dried smallpox scabs taken from patients who had survived the disease.

01:04:33.638 --> 01:04:36.199
Most people would get sick, but recover.

01:04:37.019 --> 01:04:39.120
From that point on, they were protected.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.461
That's inoculation in the skin.

01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:44.622
So that's inoculation at a barrier.

01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:51.954
which is the only possible way that you could interact with your immune system in a useful way.

01:04:52.014 --> 01:05:00.496
It's the only way, and that's why I make the statement that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent to augment the immune system is dumb.

01:05:02.276 --> 01:05:09.438
And so I hope I'm being very, very clear about that, and I'm waiting for some immunologist to come and explain to me how it is not dumb.

01:05:11.161 --> 01:05:33.543
when we have the skin and the epithelium of the gut, and in theory, even the epithelium of the upper airways, that could be a good place to interact with the immune system without throwing it for a loop by putting something behind the barriers, or even worse, by transfecting or transforming our cells with a protein, which is just stupid.

01:05:35.467 --> 01:05:44.109
Over 1,000 years ago, these Brahmins had observed one of the basic principles of immunization, that you rarely get infected twice.

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:46.589
You had to give people credit.

01:05:46.649 --> 01:05:48.110
I mean, they got it right.

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:51.090
They knew that there was something going on that protected you.

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:53.071
They just had no idea what it was or why.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:06:03.733
Fast forward around 700 years to Europe, where over 400,000 people were dying from smallpox every year.

01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:16.877
An English mother, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, wrote of seeing Turkish women deliberately inoculating their children with smallpox, using a method similar to the Brahmin's.

01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.619
The children play together all the rest of the day.

01:06:22.501 --> 01:06:27.844
Then the fever begins to seize them, and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.948
And in eight days' time, they are as well as before their illness.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:42.325
Lady Mary successfully inoculated her own son and introduced the technique to England.

01:06:43.346 --> 01:06:47.087
People didn't understand why it worked and it was never risk-free.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:53.009
But the smallpox death rate dropped from around 30% to 2%.

01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:56.470
And so it had to be for that reason, right?

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.390
It had to be for that.

01:06:57.591 --> 01:07:01.572
An English doctor named Edward Jenner took the next vital step.

01:07:02.813 --> 01:07:10.795
He demonstrated that deliberate infection with a mild, non-fatal disease called cowpox would protect against smallpox.

01:07:12.136 --> 01:07:16.677
He called his technique vaccination, from vacca, Latin for cow.

01:07:18.418 --> 01:07:25.059
Edward Jenner's observation caused us to eliminate a disease from the face of the earth, a disease that killed as many as 500 million people.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.320
Amazing, right?

01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:32.693
But as vaccination made smallpox disappear, a curious thing happened.

01:07:33.294 --> 01:07:37.321
Stories began to circulate of the dangers of the vaccination itself.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:51.553
Once Jenner's vaccine was used widely, not surprisingly, people became concerned for the same reason that people are concerned today, which is that adults or children were being inoculated with a biological fluid they didn't understand.

01:07:51.713 --> 01:07:54.473
They knew that it came from a cow, and that concerned them.

01:07:55.073 --> 01:08:03.235
And people, I think, were not sophisticated enough to know that a cowpox virus wouldn't make you become a cow, but that was their fear.

01:08:03.475 --> 01:08:06.556
You could argue that the same fears are alive today.

01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:13.050
Our understanding of vaccines is something that would naturally evoke fear in us.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:24.498
Once we acknowledge that a vaccine, by its very nature, is going to make us afraid, then we have to ask the next question, which is, well, why should I be doing it?

01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:31.322
To understand how vaccines work, we first need to understand immunity.

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:36.626
Sir Gustav Nassl is a world-renowned immunologist.

01:08:37.558 --> 01:09:03.771
Australia is a wonderful natural defense system of the human body It depends on the white cells of the blood to rapidly rapidly rapidly get you protected against the disease Imagine millions of immune cells such as white blood cells all on the lookout for specific germs If they spot something foreign like flu

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:05.250
they prepare to fight.

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:13.280
When that flu bug enters your body, the white cells like to move in on it and they get a bit angry.

01:09:14.882 --> 01:09:20.689
The immune cells arm themselves and then replicate, creating an army of clones.

01:09:24.605 --> 01:09:28.608
Then, launching powerful germ-seeking agents called antibodies.

01:09:28.648 --> 01:09:29.309
There you go.

01:09:29.369 --> 01:09:31.190
Tag the germs for disposal.

01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:32.371
So that's all they do.

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:36.255
T-cells, they turn into robots, and then they shoot antibodies.

01:09:36.295 --> 01:09:37.716
You see how awful it is?

01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:39.998
It's absolutely awful.

01:09:40.078 --> 01:09:43.521
And they started with this way, way, way, way, way back when.

01:09:43.621 --> 01:09:52.228
And remember, this isn't them trying to teach our children an immunology that will help them appreciate the irreducible complexity that is their own biology.

01:09:53.973 --> 01:10:09.304
This is the PBS NewsHour teaching you what the military-industrial complex, the biosecurity state, needs you to understand is immunity so that they can justify the use of transfection and transformation to produce that immunity, those antibodies.

01:10:09.744 --> 01:10:18.471
They were already seeding this narrative so that you would understand that immunity, I-M-M-U-N-I-T-Y, is antibodies.

01:10:20.455 --> 01:10:25.359
just like Saturday Night Live wrapped about a year after the pandemic started.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:44.194
And remember, this is a national security, biosecurity, military correlate of immunity that the DOD and DARPA and BARTA and DITRA have all agreed is a good correlate of immunity.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.481
And so if you produce antibodies, that's a positive result.

01:10:49.922 --> 01:11:01.546
And they need you to understand that in order for them to be able to invert a vaccine schedule that's not really working into something that is wholly testing transformation and transfection on you.

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:10.569
Sampling our data and eventually making the move to say, you know what, your immune system is so complicated, we're just gonna need to sample it.

01:11:11.664 --> 01:11:15.585
and then orient our therapy for you.

01:11:15.665 --> 01:11:17.365
And so that's personalized medicine.

01:11:17.425 --> 01:11:22.107
That's this stuff that that Belgian guy was talking about.

01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:29.428
And in fact, all of the same people that are interested in you not understanding what the Human Genome Project accomplished and didn't accomplish.

01:11:29.468 --> 01:11:39.751
Those same people that want you to believe that they have the fidelity of gods when it comes to understanding how a genome works and how it results in the pattern integrity that it encodes for.

01:11:40.311 --> 01:11:41.832
and this is all part of it.

01:11:41.872 --> 01:11:45.454
They want you to think it's so trivial they can make a cartoon about it.

01:11:45.815 --> 01:11:49.737
And if the cartoon makes sense to you, then you understand the immune system.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.402
Once the germ is removed, the immune army disbands.

01:11:58.763 --> 01:12:01.525
But they leave behind memory cells.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:07.909
Their job is to remember the invader and to sound the alarm if it ever appears again.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:17.164
When we're born, we're not yet very much Australian in terms of our immune system.

01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:22.888
So if an infection strikes a little infant, then there's a great vulnerability.

01:12:23.428 --> 01:12:26.670
It's the tiniest ones that need the most protection.

01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:32.314
The recommended vaccine schedule is designed to close this window of vulnerability.

01:12:33.194 --> 01:12:40.179
Some people believe that you don't need to vaccinate your child because you've got such a beautiful and good immune system.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:49.866
They forget that these bugs that surround us have been co-evolving with us, sometimes for millions of years.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.528
And in some respects, they're cleverer than us.

01:12:53.108 --> 01:12:58.492
They have worked out ways of evading the immune system unless you pre-arm it.

01:12:58.976 --> 01:12:59.296
Wow.

01:12:59.356 --> 01:13:03.221
The Australian says that some of these things have been evolving for so long.

01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:04.342
They're smarter than us.

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:07.866
And without pre-instruction, you're screwed.

01:13:08.206 --> 01:13:08.807
You see it.

01:13:08.887 --> 01:13:09.368
You hear it.

01:13:12.091 --> 01:13:16.796
You come out of your mom already broken and vulnerable to the mother nature.

01:13:18.104 --> 01:13:19.465
and her bitchy ways.

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:20.605
Like, that's what this is.

01:13:20.825 --> 01:13:29.349
So, putting it bluntly, the white cells mightn't be fast enough or smart enough if we hadn't whipped them along by a prior immunization.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:39.773
A vaccine, in effect, sends in an imposter, a weakened or dead part of the germ, just enough to be recognized.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.775
The immune cells mount the defense.

01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:53.555
Because the threat is low, they quickly disband.

01:13:54.215 --> 01:13:57.576
But the all-important memory cells have been created.

01:13:58.436 --> 01:14:01.717
The immune system is now prepared for the real germ.

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:11.439
To arm our immune system against multiple germs, different vaccines can be combined.

01:14:12.439 --> 01:14:14.720
This reduces the number of shots we need.

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:24.927
Because the shots, it's the number of shots we can, we could, you know, I mean, if we got measles and mumps and rubella all at the same time, it would be terrible, of course.

01:14:25.007 --> 01:14:35.553
But our immune system is totally capable of mounting a normal and good, robust memory response to all of those things if we immunize them together.

01:14:36.053 --> 01:14:41.997
It's now in danger of overacting, activating the immune system, no danger of getting those things confused.

01:14:42.677 --> 01:14:48.620
It's all just about, you know, it reduces the number of times that we have to stick a needle into your kid.

01:14:49.541 --> 01:15:03.728
It reduces the number of times we have to go stab your child and inject a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system, which is always dumb, but maybe the less times we do it, it'll feel better.

01:15:04.869 --> 01:15:06.210
And studies show it to be safe.

01:15:06.932 --> 01:15:15.174
What we have seen in the industrialised world is essentially all of the major epidemics, they've vanished.

01:15:15.994 --> 01:15:28.236
Mums today have every expectation that their beautiful little baby will live and not be polished off by diphtheria, by tetanus, even occasionally by measles.

01:15:29.256 --> 01:15:33.917
Now that is the transformation in young lives that vaccines have wrought.

01:15:34.946 --> 01:15:37.547
Vaccines do more than protect individuals.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:40.509
They can protect entire communities.

01:15:44.991 --> 01:15:52.874
My kids have never worn sunscreen because they have jeans to protect them and because they wear a sun shirt if they need to wear a shirt.

01:15:54.115 --> 01:15:55.195
Sunscreen is lame.

01:15:55.575 --> 01:16:01.398
Team measles outbreak in New York hit hard and fast but remained within the Brooklyn area.

01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:06.982
Why didn't it spread to the other 8 million people in the city?

01:16:07.722 --> 01:16:08.322
Weird, right?

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:09.363
Why didn't it spread?

01:16:12.184 --> 01:16:13.204
Here we go with herd immunity.

01:16:13.224 --> 01:16:17.245
The virus was in circulation, even though it often wasn't obvious.

01:16:18.726 --> 01:16:22.667
And it was being carried by people who often had no idea they were infected.

01:16:30.618 --> 01:16:35.562
But the vast majority of people who came into contact with the virus had protection.

01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:37.463
They were vaccinated.

01:16:38.924 --> 01:16:40.345
You see how it got in her hair there?

01:16:40.365 --> 01:16:47.070
There's two things that matter for whether or not I'm going to get sick.

01:16:47.731 --> 01:16:54.336
One is, if I bump into somebody who has the disease, am I protected against it or not?

01:16:55.356 --> 01:16:58.679
But the other piece, and the more important piece,

01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:04.234
is the chance I will bump into somebody in the first place who has this disease.

01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:08.938
And you can think of this as these sort of concentric circles of people.

01:17:09.879 --> 01:17:17.705
And the less the disease exists in my circle or the next circle or the next circle, the safer I am.

01:17:19.746 --> 01:17:20.387
Safety.

01:17:20.447 --> 01:17:21.708
It's all about safety.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.222
Hope you feel safe.

01:17:24.802 --> 01:17:28.143
Notice that those people that we listened to yesterday do not feel safe.

01:17:28.823 --> 01:17:29.983
And that's part of this.

01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.644
That started already back then.

01:17:31.684 --> 01:17:35.204
They're creating this possibility that you might not be safe.

01:17:36.845 --> 01:17:38.185
That mother nature's a bitch.

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:41.726
That she provides, she stands as a threat.

01:17:42.426 --> 01:17:47.567
And the outside world is full of threats that float around and hang around in elevators for hours.

01:17:49.761 --> 01:18:03.526
And so if you're not keenly aware that a lot of this is exaggeration to get 100% compliance in a national security exercise that's three years away, you could really be in trouble.

01:18:05.067 --> 01:18:08.668
Young babies and people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.

01:18:10.874 --> 01:18:13.136
And in New York, it worked.

01:18:13.476 --> 01:18:24.586
If we didn't have the high vaccination levels that we do, you know, in New York City and even in this community, I can promise you we would have had hundreds if not thousands of cases.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:25.426
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:26.087 --> 01:18:28.109
But this protection is fragile.

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:36.376
For highly infectious diseases like measles, we need 95% of the community vaccinated for herd immunity to hold.

01:18:37.901 --> 01:18:42.225
If the rate drops, even just a few percent, herd immunity can collapse.

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:46.288
And then the people that aren't protected will get sick, right?

01:18:46.308 --> 01:18:47.970
I mean, what are we saying?

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.332
89% the impact was dramatic.

01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:52.073
Oh, in France.

01:18:52.534 --> 01:18:53.234
Oh my goodness.

01:18:58.399 --> 01:18:59.960
They jump rope in France.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.403
There were around 40 cases of measles across France.

01:19:04.324 --> 01:19:04.484
Then,

01:19:05.037 --> 01:19:09.359
In 2008, a 10-year-old girl returned from holiday in Austria.

01:19:09.419 --> 01:19:10.020
It wasn't her.

01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:13.822
She went back to school and played with some friends.

01:19:15.683 --> 01:19:18.164
Several days later, the girls became ill.

01:19:19.845 --> 01:19:25.188
The measles infection spread from district to district, infecting the susceptible population.

01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:28.970
In 2011, there were almost 15,000 cases.

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:29.370
Wow.

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:32.372
At least six people died.

01:19:32.452 --> 01:19:33.673
Did they cover the whole country?

01:19:35.154 --> 01:19:42.736
It's astounding to me that in this day and age that you can have people dying of measles in the developed world.

01:19:44.036 --> 01:19:48.798
So for people who say this doesn't happen anymore, we have the proof.

01:19:49.798 --> 01:19:53.539
It's a combination of people's risk tolerances low

01:19:54.073 --> 01:19:59.735
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I believe, is the school that did a lot of, oh my gosh.

01:19:59.755 --> 01:20:08.298
And yet a distorted notion of how invulnerable they are, that they would never get certain diseases.

01:20:08.478 --> 01:20:10.379
And if they did, they'd be fine.

01:20:14.621 --> 01:20:18.102
Low vaccination rates can also be fueled by mistrust.

01:20:19.617 --> 01:20:22.638
and amplified by frightening stories.

01:20:22.658 --> 01:20:29.040
The stories that circulate, go viral, are the stories that have that emotional power.

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.641
And what's the most emotional story?

01:20:32.241 --> 01:20:34.781
The story of some child being hurt.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.945
Luke Philbin was born a healthy, normal baby.

01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:55.556
When he was six months old, his mother took him for his scheduled vaccinations.

01:20:55.576 --> 01:20:57.657
17 hours later, Luke had a seizure.

01:20:58.898 --> 01:21:02.161
He went into this full, violent convulsion.

01:21:02.181 --> 01:21:03.862
He was frothing at the mouth.

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:05.924
He was just completely...

01:21:07.142 --> 01:21:29.942
shaking and don't you find it strange that frontline based in america with 325 million people in 2017 had to go to freaking australia to find a kid with whooping cough had to go to freaking australia to find a doctor that would sit in a park and talk about vaccines had to go to australia to talk to these people what in the hell is going on here

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:41.886
Especially when you look at how they executed the pandemic and what they used New Zealand and Australia and Canada and the UK for.

01:21:41.946 --> 01:21:44.848
Can you not see that it is one continuous operation?

01:21:45.849 --> 01:21:47.790
It is one continuous setup.

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:53.054
It's like we were in a giant sting and we were the victims of it.

01:21:56.474 --> 01:22:08.298
Beside myself, I did not turn, I rang the ambulance and just as they entered the house, he just stopped and went completely lifeless and turned blue.

01:22:12.699 --> 01:22:16.040
They gave him some oxygen and they said we need to take him to hospital right now.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:22.242
The doctors explained the vaccine had caused a fever which had triggered Luke's seizure.

01:22:22.945 --> 01:22:27.549
10 days later, and I got another call at work from Sam, and he'd had another seizure.

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:32.993
That was when it really sort of dawned on us, I think, that something really serious was going on.

01:22:35.455 --> 01:22:38.118
Luke's seizures continued, constantly.

01:22:38.138 --> 01:22:38.998
You okay, mate?

01:22:40.399 --> 01:22:40.800
You okay?

01:22:43.962 --> 01:22:46.304
I had a friend whose daughter had seizures till she was about 12.

01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:58.532
I went to the internet and I was searching everywhere just to find similar stories.

01:22:59.173 --> 01:23:02.395
For that six-month period, as far as we were concerned, it was vaccine-related.

01:23:02.855 --> 01:23:04.916
And blaming ourselves up to that point, really.

01:23:05.157 --> 01:23:05.777
Why did we do this?

01:23:05.957 --> 01:23:07.698
If Stuart hadn't done this, he'd be fine.

01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:16.544
After many months of searching the world for answers, they discovered the clues to Luke's illness lay on the other side of Melbourne.

01:23:19.025 --> 01:23:21.087
Here it comes, on the other side of Melbourne.

01:23:21.908 --> 01:23:23.410
Turns out he had a gene.

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:24.371
See?

01:23:24.391 --> 01:23:25.212
This is why I feel like...

01:23:33.544 --> 01:23:53.065
My position in this is so vital because I can tell you from a first-hand experience how they've motivated an entire field called neuroscience to focus on genetic causes of behavior, genetic causes of disease, and genetic causes of changes in the brain that can explain this bullshit

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:57.910
And it's extraordinary how people have gone all in.

01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:12.483
Because if you put billions of dollars of grant money behind these things and tell people, if you write a grant application and do experiments to collect data that try to answer these kinds of questions, there is a mountain of money available to you.

01:24:15.306 --> 01:24:19.450
And it's all a perverted incentive to cover up.

01:24:20.646 --> 01:24:26.649
what public health and the vaccine schedule in particular in America has done to our children this last generation.

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:31.292
Cases where prolonged seizures happen soon after vaccination.

01:24:31.792 --> 01:24:44.560
It's really important that it occurred so close to his vaccination and this is really what led to the thinking that there was a vaccine encephalopathy.

01:24:45.402 --> 01:24:47.583
So, and she's all still quoting it.

01:24:47.643 --> 01:24:49.844
It's all because of the temporal coincidence.

01:24:49.884 --> 01:25:03.409
If the temporal coincidence isn't there, then the vaccine or any prior prior exposure to an intramuscular toxin injection is just completely absolved of any possible relation to the cause.

01:25:04.793 --> 01:25:21.647
And it is this fundamental magic trick that an intramuscular injection has to lead to symptoms in a few hours or a day, or otherwise whatever you injected intramuscularly is now absolved of any further role in your health.

01:25:23.348 --> 01:25:24.549
This is absurd.

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:32.836
You have to understand how absurd that is, that they would inject something into your body via a needle

01:25:33.908 --> 01:25:41.273
and then tell you if you don't have any adverse effects from it after about eight hours, well then obviously anything that happens to you after that is from something else.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:46.656
Maybe you're aided or maybe it's a gene that you were always carrying around.

01:25:47.397 --> 01:25:56.863
And I say so-called because everyone associated that the timing of the vaccination and the timing of the first seizure meant that the vaccine was causative.

01:25:57.784 --> 01:25:58.244
Yeah, perfect.

01:25:59.485 --> 01:26:06.015
For six years, the team... As if he is an anecdotal case that cannot be verified anywhere else on earth.

01:26:06.476 --> 01:26:08.118
We are still in Australia!

01:26:08.138 --> 01:26:10.702
...studied the patients carefully.

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:21.065
they discovered that the histories and symptoms matched those of a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome.

01:26:21.645 --> 01:26:32.877
Dravet syndrome is a very severe epilepsy beginning in infancy and it occurs in a previously normal and well baby and their development slows down so they have normal development

01:26:33.317 --> 01:26:34.537
And then between one to two years.

01:26:34.617 --> 01:26:52.123
And so the wonderful thing about these kinds of stories, they have so many parallels to the other kinds of experimental models that I've seen in neurobiology and more broadly neuroscience used to equate an animal model with a model of autism.

01:26:52.323 --> 01:26:55.304
You can look for things like Angelman's disease.

01:26:55.364 --> 01:26:56.005
You can look for

01:26:57.325 --> 01:27:03.907
rare genetic disorders in childhood that result in very predictable symptomologies in childhood.

01:27:04.467 --> 01:27:24.314
And these are very interesting because from the perspective of a group of people that's trying to understand the human genome and how it works, especially in development, these are some of the low-hanging fruit in terms of, well, if we can understand anything, maybe we can understand how these kids end up to be bald by the time they're six years old and develop mentally retarded.

01:27:24.794 --> 01:27:27.615
if we understand what this gene does in development.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:42.441
And so they've given billions of dollars to neuroscientists, and that could be a broad term that anybody that studies the brain or development, giving money to neuroscientists to study these rare genetically

01:27:43.530 --> 01:28:05.687
correlative or even genetically caused, let's say, childhood diseases with the idea that these genetic anomalies that result in a predictable symptomology that can be vaguely considered to be related to autism because it's in development, that this becomes this huge umbrella under which anything can fall into that rubric.

01:28:07.475 --> 01:28:24.410
And so now you can have thousands of scientists that study this little niche thing or another little niche thing under the rubric that they're studying case examples of autism that are more predictable because they have a very known genetic component.

01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:26.131
And where do we get here?

01:28:26.572 --> 01:28:34.699
And I hope you've been following me until this point, but when we get here, then we also have the unknown components.

01:28:35.802 --> 01:29:00.542
And so just because this particular example seems to have a genetic explanation, then the huge leap and assumption that this person makes because there are billions of dollars of grant money available to people who make this leap, then that means that all autism is caused by genetic vulnerabilities that we just haven't identified yet.

01:29:02.765 --> 01:29:04.208
Some of them are worse than others.

01:29:04.268 --> 01:29:06.351
Some of them manifest in different ways.

01:29:07.112 --> 01:29:15.906
But in the end, it is a very tempting and very futurist, a very transhuman assumption to make.

01:29:17.025 --> 01:29:43.935
that if we have a few examples of autism-like childhood diseases that can be traced back to particular genes or particular mutations, then it is a very transhuman assumption to say that, well, then that must mean that all of these manifestations have genetic explanations and we just need to dig deeper and collect more data and invert the sovereignty of every human being on the planet in order to solve these problems.

01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:47.371
That's where we are right now.

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.091
Sort of plateaus.

01:29:49.632 --> 01:29:53.453
And by far the majority of children with Dravet syndrome have intellectual disability.

01:29:55.054 --> 01:30:03.397
Dravet syndrome is caused by mutations in a particular gene called SCN1A, which impact key pathways in the brain.

01:30:03.897 --> 01:30:13.901
I can't emphasize how important it is for you to start to understand that and what, that will be one of the red threads that runs through all of the mini courses, any mini course that I ever teach.

01:30:15.686 --> 01:30:40.685
is that if you put billions of dollars of grant money available to anybody that tries to develop a model of autism that is tied to a gene, then you're going to have thousands of neuroscientists working on animal models that tie autism to a gene, and indeed giving seminars and writing very smart prose about rationalizing this interpretation of the world, this model of the world.

01:30:41.471 --> 01:30:44.833
And if it fails, it will only fail in certain cases.

01:30:44.913 --> 01:30:46.774
That's their whole idea.

01:30:46.794 --> 01:30:50.636
You almost have to prove it wrong in order for them to stop doing it.

01:30:50.676 --> 01:31:07.985
And since you can't prove anything wrong in science, as long as people like Robert Malone are sitting on study sections, as long as people like Tony Fauci are sitting on study sections, as long as people like Peter Daszak are sitting on study sections, then you're never going to see this reverse.

01:31:12.062 --> 01:31:16.705
These are usually new mutations, not something passed on from the child's parents.

01:31:17.885 --> 01:31:21.187
In 2006, the team made a key discovery.

01:31:21.507 --> 01:31:28.772
The majority of the children who had prolonged seizures after vaccination also had a mutation for Dravet syndrome.

01:31:29.392 --> 01:31:33.514
The gene, the SCM1A mutation, is the cause of the Dravet syndrome.

01:31:34.695 --> 01:31:36.356
It's really extraordinary, right?

01:31:38.151 --> 01:31:46.559
Think about this, that mutation is found in Australian kids because the Australian population breeds with the Australian population.

01:31:47.019 --> 01:31:59.551
They found a gene in the Australian population that's probably in other populations as well and causes a certain set of symptoms that can be exacerbated or even caused to go over threshold.

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:05.247
by the acute activation of the immune system, maybe by a particular injection or not.

01:32:05.667 --> 01:32:08.450
Did she say which vaccine is causing it in this case?

01:32:09.831 --> 01:32:12.674
So are they really trying to explain to you what they found?

01:32:13.855 --> 01:32:14.536
Or are they just...

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:20.741
and the vaccine is at most a trigger for a seizure.

01:32:21.362 --> 01:32:24.084
And anybody with epilepsy has triggers for their seizures.

01:32:24.124 --> 01:32:25.665
They're not causative, they're triggers.

01:32:26.205 --> 01:32:35.471
So you can have genes causing your epilepsy, but triggers are commonly sleep deprivation, stress, and in this situation, vaccination is a trigger.

01:32:35.991 --> 01:32:53.134
See, they are using Australian scientists and Australian people and Australian narratives and Australian hospitals to tell people in America that the American vaccine schedule with 28 shots in two years for 14 diseases is totally okay.

01:32:56.675 --> 01:33:01.296
Did they talk to us at all about what the vaccine schedule is in Australia?

01:33:04.991 --> 01:33:11.313
Did they talk to us about who's producing the vaccines in Australia versus who's producing the vaccines in America?

01:33:11.693 --> 01:33:15.534
Did they talk about which, how the legal status is different anywhere?

01:33:15.554 --> 01:33:20.595
Or are they just telling us a biological narrative that suits the biosecurity state?

01:33:20.735 --> 01:33:22.236
Ask yourself those questions.

01:33:23.396 --> 01:33:27.357
When Luke was tested, they discovered he too had Dravet syndrome.

01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:37.235
Today, Luke's parents know that any fever can trigger his seizures, whether from a toothache or from a vaccine.

01:33:39.276 --> 01:33:55.248
I mean, I'm not saying this happened, but worst case scenario, the national security state in control of all the technologies surrounding the Human Genome Project could have easily done an operation where there was this kid that was injured.

01:33:55.288 --> 01:33:57.930
And so we had to come up with a story of how it is.

01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:59.171
And so this is the story.

01:34:00.489 --> 01:34:01.089
And here it is.

01:34:01.169 --> 01:34:02.890
That's the lady who's going to tell the story.

01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:03.831
And then they covered it up.

01:34:05.712 --> 01:34:06.952
Is it a real story or not?

01:34:07.012 --> 01:34:07.853
I don't know anymore.

01:34:07.893 --> 01:34:10.914
I don't care because I know that they are lying.

01:34:11.394 --> 01:34:14.336
They have been lying to us about it long before the pandemic.

01:34:14.376 --> 01:34:26.882
And that's the part that really bothers me because if you're not on the front line as a parent, making these choices, and you've never had anyone like I did in Norway, tell me their thoughts on it.

01:34:28.356 --> 01:34:43.580
but instead start out with the PBS NewsHour, start out with a doctor that watches the PBS NewsHour, an American doctor that just thinks that they are an expert in something that they know nothing about, you're in big trouble.

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:54.623
And that's why I think it's really important to fight for this in America, because in America is where the worst malevolence of this kind is being executed on a daily basis.

01:34:59.081 --> 01:35:02.764
They also understand that Luke was going to get this condition anyway.

01:35:03.224 --> 01:35:09.409
We've chosen not to vaccinate him further because we know it was a trigger.

01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:15.494
We rely on other people having their kids vaccinated to protect Luke.

01:35:19.181 --> 01:35:25.125
And they don't feel bad about it because they think that the vaccination only hurt their son because he had a genetic vulnerability.

01:35:25.165 --> 01:35:30.288
So anybody that won't take the vaccine for their own healthy kid is just being selfish.

01:35:30.328 --> 01:35:34.631
You see, they're separating us with this mythology.

01:35:36.038 --> 01:35:50.953
creating two sides that think that they are both justified for their position, no different than what we saw yesterday with those people thinking that, you know, if I ask you to wear a mask for a week before you come and visit me and you won't do it, then you're not being very nice.

01:35:51.934 --> 01:35:53.956
You don't have my best interests in mind.

01:35:56.318 --> 01:35:59.301
They are fracturing us like so many schizophrenic idiots.

01:35:59.341 --> 01:36:00.042
That's what they're doing.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.235
Luke's type of epilepsy is rare.

01:36:07.336 --> 01:36:09.357
You're more likely to be struck by lightning.

01:36:10.198 --> 01:36:13.801
Yet his story is an example of how a vaccine can appear to cause.

01:36:13.861 --> 01:36:21.407
You're more likely to be struck by lightning, but they said that when they did the research, they found out that lots of vaccine injured kids had this condition.

01:36:22.127 --> 01:36:24.269
You see how stupid that is, right?

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:31.475
We should go back really and listen to that part because they did say that they did research and they found that all those kids

01:36:34.053 --> 01:36:42.060
All those kids with that disease had it triggered by a vaccine and therefore they looked for it in this kid and then they found that he had it.

01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:48.926
But it's very, very rare disease that gets provoked by vaccines, but it's a rare disease.

01:36:51.048 --> 01:36:58.794
And so then it doesn't explain all the children that are injured by vaccines, but they seem to be implying that here, which is so malevolent.

01:37:00.055 --> 01:37:01.437
Stop lying.

01:37:04.332 --> 01:37:07.521
The majority of children have no side effects from a vaccine.

01:37:08.584 --> 01:37:11.513
Some may experience slight swelling at the injection site.

01:37:13.112 --> 01:37:16.115
And a vaccine is all the same already in this thing.

01:37:16.155 --> 01:37:16.956
It's all the same.

01:37:17.016 --> 01:37:24.524
It couldn't be, for example, that diphtheria toxin is a more dangerous immunogen than the measles proteins that they put in you.

01:37:24.564 --> 01:37:30.270
It couldn't be that your body has the potential to react very badly to one and not very bad.

01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:32.312
You know, there's no nuance here.

01:37:32.773 --> 01:37:34.054
Vaccines are

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:37.217
For the most part, for most people, safe.

01:37:37.277 --> 01:37:40.881
There are some people who have genetic vulnerabilities to them.

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:43.323
And now you understand all the biology you need to know.

01:37:43.363 --> 01:37:44.484
Now shut up and have kids.

01:37:44.844 --> 01:37:45.305
A fever.

01:37:45.745 --> 01:37:47.247
A normal immune response.

01:37:48.148 --> 01:37:55.054
Occasionally, children can have a seizure after a vaccine, but this is usually a brief, one-time event with no damage.

01:37:55.635 --> 01:37:56.736
With no damage!

01:37:56.876 --> 01:37:57.236
Ha ha ha!

01:38:00.796 --> 01:38:04.778
But there are extremely rare cases where a vaccine has done harm.

01:38:07.159 --> 01:38:08.879
Cases like David Salomon.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.201
I contracted polio from the vaccination.

01:38:12.221 --> 01:38:14.242
It affected my right leg.

01:38:14.502 --> 01:38:15.822
My muscles atrophied.

01:38:16.163 --> 01:38:23.806
I wear a leg brace.

01:38:23.966 --> 01:38:28.668
In 1990, when David was six months old, his parents took him for his oral polio vaccine.

01:38:30.121 --> 01:38:33.084
Oral polio vaccine.

01:38:33.944 --> 01:38:38.208
We took him to the pediatrician, and he basically said, oh, it's nothing.

01:38:38.388 --> 01:38:39.369
You know what I mean?

01:38:39.389 --> 01:38:42.451
Just probably a little reaction, but don't worry about it.

01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:43.452
High fever.

01:38:44.052 --> 01:38:45.473
It just seemed to get worse.

01:38:46.034 --> 01:38:49.817
And suddenly, we noticed that he wasn't even able to move his lower extremities.

01:38:51.167 --> 01:38:54.890
David's paralysis was eventually tracked back to the vaccine.

01:38:56.051 --> 01:38:59.713
And to a series of events that occurred over 50 years ago.

01:39:00.214 --> 01:39:00.574
Oh, what?

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:08.540
In the all-out fight against polio, led by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, there were many years of struggle and heartbreak.

01:39:09.201 --> 01:39:16.146
In the 1950s, tens of thousands of American children were paralyzed by polio and thousands of them died.

01:39:17.367 --> 01:39:19.728
It was one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century.

01:39:21.613 --> 01:39:22.553
Where did it come from?

01:39:22.573 --> 01:39:26.435
Like it just developed?

01:39:26.535 --> 01:39:28.096
Like polio just showed up?

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:31.397
Or, you know, like, I'm curious about that.

01:39:31.797 --> 01:39:38.020
Thanks to the injectable Salk vaccine, and later the oral Sabin vaccine, polio rates plummeted by 99%.

01:39:49.676 --> 01:39:52.065
The disease largely vanished from the U.S.

01:39:53.345 --> 01:39:56.126
But the oral polio vaccine carried a risk.

01:39:56.606 --> 01:40:02.367
There was a small chance that the weakened virus within it could mutate and actually cause polio.

01:40:02.467 --> 01:40:04.628
Because it's just an enterovirus.

01:40:04.988 --> 01:40:07.389
It's just a gut virus.

01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:14.371
And we don't, I don't know enough about it to say what exactly it is, but it's a signal that was always there.

01:40:15.071 --> 01:40:19.492
And they tried to augment your immune system in a way that, that,

01:40:22.361 --> 01:40:23.182
It's just awful.

01:40:24.664 --> 01:40:30.630
When in reality, what probably was happening, DDT was breaking the barrier of the gut.

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:41.843
And DDT breaking the barrier of the gut caused the bacteria to get in, the enterovirus to get in, whatever, and paralyzed people.

01:40:44.099 --> 01:40:56.368
Otherwise, the barrier would not have been broken, and then this would just be an enterovirus, probably that was actually shared between bacteria in your gut rather than, you know, infecting your cells like they say it is.

01:40:56.388 --> 01:40:57.909
Okay, David, come on down.

01:40:57.929 --> 01:40:59.530
I want to show you something.

01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:12.890
We failed to ask the question.

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:15.371
You mean endogenous virus, right?

01:41:15.411 --> 01:41:17.031
And a virus that's always in you, yeah.

01:41:17.091 --> 01:41:20.472
Does it pass the risk-benefit ratio test?

01:41:22.993 --> 01:41:33.577
And obviously, if the only cases of polio you have in a country come from the very vaccine designed to prevent it, it doesn't pass, and it shouldn't be given.

01:41:36.297 --> 01:41:37.518
The Congress has oversight.

01:41:38.095 --> 01:41:48.322
Understand that if DDT was the real cause of polio, then it is a very, very simple PSYOP that they pulled on these people.

01:41:48.342 --> 01:41:51.684
And they pulled DDT around the same time that they rolled out this shot.

01:41:51.724 --> 01:41:54.346
They got the shot ready to go and holy cow, here we go, people.

01:41:56.267 --> 01:41:57.628
It's like a shell game.

01:41:57.968 --> 01:42:02.391
Over CDC, over- David's father lobbied to have the vaccine changed.

01:42:03.703 --> 01:42:11.067
And in the year 2000, across the U.S., the oral vaccine was replaced by a safer, injectable version.

01:42:12.568 --> 01:42:16.991
This vaccine had a problem, and there was a better one, and we fixed it.

01:42:17.691 --> 01:42:18.452
The system worked.

01:42:19.192 --> 01:42:22.034
Too many had to suffer, but the system worked.

01:42:25.076 --> 01:42:26.597
I'm not against vaccinations.

01:42:26.617 --> 01:42:27.938
I'm pro-vaccinations.

01:42:28.857 --> 01:42:33.338
We had thousands of people contracting polio prior to the vaccination.

01:42:33.519 --> 01:42:37.580
We came out with the vaccination and that number decreased significantly.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:43.062
So less people are getting sick, less people are getting affected, and that's a good thing.

01:42:43.902 --> 01:42:49.624
Changing and adapting vaccines as new evidence emerges is a vital and ongoing process.

01:42:50.324 --> 01:42:56.006
But sometimes vaccines are blamed for causing harm when there's no scientific proof.

01:42:58.015 --> 01:43:02.198
When there's no scientific proof, oh my goodness, would people do that?

01:43:02.218 --> 01:43:03.419
No way!

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:08.843
Autism is one of the most baffling health issues of our generation.

01:43:10.805 --> 01:43:11.465
Here it is.

01:43:12.926 --> 01:43:18.410
Around 1 in 70 children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in the US today.

01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:19.211
1 in 70!

01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:27.457
It's not a single disease, but rather a complex web of disorders marked by communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors.

01:43:29.124 --> 01:43:31.385
The question is, what causes it?

01:43:32.145 --> 01:43:32.925
Brown bear, brown bear.

01:43:33.465 --> 01:43:34.725
That's a teddy bear.

01:43:35.165 --> 01:43:38.106
This beautiful girl is my daughter, Jodi.

01:43:38.186 --> 01:43:38.726
She's six.

01:43:38.826 --> 01:43:48.108
I think one of the things that we should be reminded of is that back in the time when I was a child, my dad was a special ed teacher before he retired.

01:43:49.108 --> 01:43:55.670
And he used to work with severely handicapped people when I was young.

01:43:57.054 --> 01:44:00.356
And back then, those people were called, a lot of them were called retarded.

01:44:02.718 --> 01:44:05.079
And of course, that's a terrible word nowadays.

01:44:06.781 --> 01:44:20.149
But it strikes me as interesting to think about the idea that a lot of the argument that is made is that we become better at diagnosing autism or this kind of thing.

01:44:22.314 --> 01:44:33.186
And it strikes me as interesting to note that at that time, my understanding was that all those kids that my dad worked with were kids that were that way from birth.

01:44:35.449 --> 01:44:40.554
And now in retrospect, I wonder, thinking back, I wonder how many of those kids

01:44:41.621 --> 01:44:43.381
became retarded, you know what I mean?

01:44:43.681 --> 01:44:51.223
And whether or not autistic kids at that time may have been just called and treated as this rubric.

01:44:51.503 --> 01:44:56.444
Now she says that autism is a wide ranging term that describes a lot of things.

01:44:56.504 --> 01:45:01.565
Well, back in the early seventies, retarded was that, that term, as far as I know.

01:45:01.685 --> 01:45:03.865
I mean, you know, again, I'm not a child psychologist.

01:45:03.945 --> 01:45:06.466
I was a kid in, in the seventies.

01:45:06.946 --> 01:45:07.026
Um,

01:45:08.499 --> 01:45:27.552
I just am more trying to make the point that the number of children that are being identified as this versus the confusion, that's where I was going, I almost lost it, the confusion that's being created by these people who say they're autistic.

01:45:27.592 --> 01:45:29.093
For example, John Cullen.

01:45:30.223 --> 01:45:44.354
The guy that works with John Goodman on YouTube and had sunglasses and now looks like kind of a low-rent Higgins from Magnum PI, that guy claims to have Asperger's.

01:45:44.975 --> 01:45:57.705
Now, from my perspective, that's a terrible thing to claim to have when you know that there are people that do have a disease called Asperger's that is actually socially debilitating for them.

01:45:59.625 --> 01:46:10.168
And so we have this, also this new wave of like, you know, any neuroticism that you have as an adult could be called autism and you just weren't diagnosed.

01:46:11.569 --> 01:46:14.630
You know, any OCD that you have might be your autism.

01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:26.954
And all of this is part of a collective move to try and trivialize the injury that occurs in this, you know, 28 shot over two years schedule.

01:46:27.774 --> 01:46:33.158
that lots and lots of parents are very aware damage their child.

01:46:34.258 --> 01:46:38.361
And the foremost one that comes to mind for me is Brian Hooker.

01:46:39.161 --> 01:46:44.044
Teen, and she has autism, and now she's in residential placement.

01:46:44.585 --> 01:46:48.167
And I'm here today, as I am every weekend, visiting her.

01:46:48.187 --> 01:46:49.268
It's the highlight of my week.

01:46:51.658 --> 01:47:00.984
As a parent, I would love to have a better understanding of why she behaves the way she behaves or why we have to go through the same rituals and routines every single time.

01:47:01.945 --> 01:47:04.126
We need to understand so that we can help her.

01:47:06.268 --> 01:47:13.693
Allison Singer channeled her need for answers, becoming an autism advocate, raising funds for research.

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:20.364
Allison noticed Jodi's symptoms around the same time as her daughter had her vaccinations.

01:47:21.105 --> 01:47:24.406
So she, like many parents, suspected there could be a link.

01:47:25.107 --> 01:47:29.309
Clearly, children were getting more vaccines than we had gotten when we were born.

01:47:29.329 --> 01:47:29.969
Uh-oh.

01:47:30.049 --> 01:47:32.651
And more and more children were being diagnosed with autism.

01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:33.331
Uh-oh.

01:47:33.551 --> 01:47:36.133
Oh, she's saying some pretty risky stuff there.

01:47:36.233 --> 01:47:36.693
Look out.

01:47:37.748 --> 01:47:45.655
So I felt that, yes, this was an area that we needed to look at and see if there was a relationship between vaccines and autism.

01:47:47.456 --> 01:47:51.640
In 1998, an English doctor, Andrew... Do you hear the whispering?

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:54.362
I'm going to go back one click.

01:47:54.403 --> 01:47:55.363
Listen to the whispering.

01:47:55.403 --> 01:48:00.508
We needed to look at and see if there was a relationship between vaccines and autism.

01:48:02.581 --> 01:48:12.167
In 1998, an English doctor, Andrew Wakefield, argued there was a link between autism and MMR, the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.

01:48:12.607 --> 01:48:17.269
His study of 12 children was published in a major medical journal, The Lancet.

01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:20.471
When I read that, I was taken aback.

01:48:21.051 --> 01:48:22.212
We have to look at this.

01:48:23.273 --> 01:48:25.574
Fortunately, those are studies that can be done.

01:48:27.972 --> 01:48:34.076
A search began to see if a link between autism and the MMR vaccine could be confirmed.

01:48:36.697 --> 01:48:40.360
Scientists examined the medical records of hundreds of thousands of children.

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.481
They were all injected with different products.

01:48:44.482 --> 01:48:49.605
They were all injected with different products manufactured at different facilities.

01:48:51.226 --> 01:48:54.088
Injected at different times by different doctors.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:07.087
And so the idea, for example, that a particular lot or dose could have been especially inflammatory or especially dangerous has ruled out here.

01:49:08.568 --> 01:49:16.614
The idea that any kind of combination vaccine might be dangerous, depending on how it was, this is all ruled out here.

01:49:17.434 --> 01:49:25.440
And instead they use numbers that are not related as if, well, we don't find any measles in the cardinal population of America, so I guess there's no epidemic.

01:49:26.738 --> 01:49:31.681
We don't find any injuries in 10,000 children in America and millions in Finland.

01:49:31.781 --> 01:49:34.403
And so therefore these kids aren't injured.

01:49:36.324 --> 01:49:39.547
And so you should submit to vaccination.

01:49:40.847 --> 01:49:45.811
And so it's all the same sort of full court press.

01:49:47.375 --> 01:49:54.178
And again, we're using data from numbers and places and times and products are all ignored.

01:49:54.598 --> 01:50:03.042
And we generalize across either vaccines with a small v, or now in this case, we were generalizing across the MMR vaccine.

01:50:06.587 --> 01:50:21.639
One of the most anecdotally scary stories about this is when this all finally came down and Andrew Wakefield was just saying, all I would really like to try is to advocate for single target vaccines.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:29.806
And then the only single target measles vaccine that was being produced was permanently taken off the market.

01:50:31.141 --> 01:50:38.046
But study after study revealed that whether the children were vaccinated or not, the rates of autism were the same.

01:50:38.867 --> 01:50:41.269
No one could replicate Andrew Wakefield's findings.

01:50:41.829 --> 01:50:46.233
Eventually that study was shown to be fraudulent and it was withdrawn.

01:50:47.353 --> 01:50:48.835
Fraudulent and withdrawn.

01:50:48.855 --> 01:50:50.376
So those kids weren't injured?

01:50:51.400 --> 01:51:04.524
Temporal correlation between their developing of this terrible immune reaction in their bowel and behavioral change has nothing that that temporal correlation is not real because it wasn't able to be replicated.

01:51:05.184 --> 01:51:07.085
Meaning they couldn't find it anywhere else.

01:51:12.667 --> 01:51:13.507
It's really gross.

01:51:13.687 --> 01:51:17.688
The one thing that I do find a little bit alarming and it's occurred to me a while ago.

01:51:17.708 --> 01:51:19.489
I saw it in the chat.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:43.487
is that he also is unable as a doctor to just articulate the general concern, which is the unwarranted or poorly understood attempt to augment the immune system intramuscularly has a incredible potential for downside.

01:51:45.328 --> 01:51:47.789
And instead of trying to explain this,

01:51:51.701 --> 01:51:55.405
You know, with his long, he's got a long time to tell people this kind of stuff.

01:51:56.045 --> 01:52:15.305
He seems to have been focused purely on certain messaging, not the general messaging, which I'm trying to put forward, which is, which what he could have done is to say, well, I mean, let's say that there's some risk with vaccines and that these kids are injured, but it's not all kids because of some explainable thing.

01:52:17.044 --> 01:52:18.605
There's a lot more shots in America.

01:52:18.625 --> 01:52:19.725
Maybe we should look over there.

01:52:19.785 --> 01:52:21.645
I mean, just something intelligent.

01:52:23.026 --> 01:52:29.408
Similar studies failed to find any link between autism and a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal.

01:52:29.488 --> 01:52:31.448
Here we go, chasing things around again.

01:52:31.468 --> 01:52:36.790
Still other studies failed to find any link between autism and the number or timing of vaccines.

01:52:41.448 --> 01:52:43.630
But again, those are statistical relationships.

01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:47.354
And if they can't find the statistical relationship, then it doesn't work.

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:54.160
And so if the timeframe of onset is too wide and too varied, it doesn't work.

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:54.981
There's no signal.

01:52:55.121 --> 01:52:55.541
Sorry.

01:52:55.561 --> 01:53:02.128
We would expect the signal to show up in some bump, you know, like seven days later or eight days later.

01:53:02.168 --> 01:53:04.390
And since we don't see that, I guess, no, there's nothing.

01:53:06.129 --> 01:53:11.294
So at this point, it's not like we have one study or two studies or five studies.

01:53:11.715 --> 01:53:13.637
We have dozens of studies.

01:53:15.479 --> 01:53:23.087
I think we were right to look at whether vaccines might be a cause of autism, but there comes a point where there's so much evidence.

01:53:24.665 --> 01:53:27.548
None of which shows any link between vaccines and autism.

01:53:27.568 --> 01:53:29.009
I'm afraid that she's been used.

01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:40.160
I'm afraid that she's been used and convinced that these p-values mean something and doesn't even understand how the p-values are measured or what the what possibility there is in in the power of those studies.

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.442
Maybe all of them are woefully underpowered.

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:44.985
You have to say enough.

01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:58.826
And you have to say enough and then give all the producers of these vaccines complete immunity so that they're not liable even if they make a mistake in manufacturing or they're negligent in it.

01:54:03.429 --> 01:54:09.633
Today, scientists like Daniel Geschwind are making dramatic progress in finding the real causes of autism.

01:54:11.431 --> 01:54:12.971
Here we go again with the genetics.

01:54:14.632 --> 01:54:15.212
There it is.

01:54:15.232 --> 01:54:16.492
It's really extraordinary.

01:54:17.092 --> 01:54:23.333
Identifying the genetic causes is really important because it gives us a place to start.

01:54:23.833 --> 01:54:32.815
He works under the assumption that there are genetic causes and then he gets grant money to investigate those genetic causes and report his, his data back.

01:54:33.195 --> 01:54:33.615
That's it.

01:54:33.675 --> 01:54:34.455
It's that simple.

01:54:34.995 --> 01:54:38.216
And the more money they invest in it, the more people will become convinced.

01:54:38.596 --> 01:54:50.748
and the more people will get really good at sitting in front of a camera or sitting in front of a lecture or sitting in front of a classroom and saying that finding the genetic causes of autism is a very important reason why I exist.

01:54:53.831 --> 01:54:58.136
And I'm doing really important work because there are genetic causes to autism.

01:55:03.035 --> 01:55:09.959
And so those genetic causes must be getting more prevalent in our children over time, right?

01:55:14.601 --> 01:55:18.704
Or we're getting better at diagnosing autism, and that's why we're finding more of it.

01:55:18.744 --> 01:55:20.425
But the genes are always there.

01:55:22.226 --> 01:55:24.447
Or are the genes becoming more activated?

01:55:24.527 --> 01:55:30.070
Or, you know, see, it's even incongruent at the surface if you just start to poke a little bit.

01:55:31.127 --> 01:55:35.049
We know autism can run in families, but it took a revolution.

01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:38.771
We know autism can run in families.

01:55:40.152 --> 01:55:40.812
Wow.

01:55:40.912 --> 01:55:42.794
That is, that's fricking awesome.

01:55:43.314 --> 01:55:47.236
We know that genetic anomalies can run in families.

01:55:47.296 --> 01:55:51.919
We know that mental retardation that's genetically connected can run in families.

01:55:52.479 --> 01:55:53.980
We know that's true.

01:55:55.202 --> 01:56:01.630
holy shit oh wait there we go an anchor a place to start

01:56:03.075 --> 01:56:05.375
We know autism can run in families.

01:56:05.836 --> 01:56:06.676
Microarrays.

01:56:06.696 --> 01:56:11.056
Revolution in DNA sequencing technology to allow scientists.

01:56:11.136 --> 01:56:14.437
A revolution in DNA sequencing technology.

01:56:14.477 --> 01:56:22.098
Wow, I don't know if we know anybody involved in COVID that's been interested in the revolution between our of gene sequencing technologies.

01:56:22.178 --> 01:56:30.740
Maybe just Claire Craig at heart, who was interested in gene sequencing technologies and using AI to crack the code before the pandemic.

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.561
as a clinical pathologist.

01:56:32.601 --> 01:56:54.734
Maybe Kevin McKernan, who was interested in gene technology since he cut his teeth at the Human Genome Project and then later led a fake paper about the objection to the Cormann-Jorston protocol that was promoted by the WHO and put Claire Craig and Mike Eden and Thomas Binder and all these other people on the same paper with him.

01:56:57.128 --> 01:57:11.152
you know, that trained with Mike Lander at the Broad Institute that then later gave a position to the Canadian Alina Chan, who came out and said that maybe it's a lab leak and wrote a book with Matt Ridley from the UK that maybe it's a lab leak.

01:57:11.212 --> 01:57:18.694
And so these foreigners, they get appointed at the head of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory and the head of DITRA and the head of U.S.

01:57:18.814 --> 01:57:19.194
Emirate.

01:57:19.734 --> 01:57:39.185
and they get appointed everywhere and then Robert Malone goes and coordinates with all these people in Australia and testifies in front of Australian government and Romanian government and the EU government and takes all these people around and we're supposed to believe that all of these people are just doing it because they want to save the world for our grandkids to keep them free!

01:57:39.945 --> 01:57:40.686
Stop lying!

01:57:44.028 --> 01:57:48.130
To compare thousands of genes in people with and without autism

01:57:48.717 --> 01:58:02.301
Comparing thousands of genes across people was really easy to do when they started being able to swab everybody at the beginning of the pandemic and swab all these kids that went back to college and had to take tests on a weekly basis.

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:08.263
Then they sold their remnants away to the highest bidder in order to do the exact shit they're describing here.

01:58:08.283 --> 01:58:10.144
Pinpoint specific mutations.

01:58:11.224 --> 01:58:16.726
Some of these gene mutations are inherited, but many are new, as in Dravet syndrome.

01:58:18.795 --> 01:58:24.178
Many of these genes play a role in brain development and in the way brain cells communicate.

01:58:24.739 --> 01:58:32.563
That can give us enormous clues about the onset of autism, where it begins, how it begins, and hopefully how to treat it.

01:58:32.583 --> 01:58:35.505
That's exactly how you have to talk if you want to get the money.

01:58:37.247 --> 01:58:47.491
You have to talk very confidently about it, and then you have to come up with really good formulations of how you're going to solve that problem, and really good formulations of where you're going to derive the p-values from.

01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:51.873
That's how academic biology, that's how academicians work.

01:58:52.617 --> 01:58:58.141
Scientists are also investigating environmental factors, but genes are a major part of it.

01:58:58.201 --> 01:59:03.866
He's looking around the room as if he always envisions these networks of genes like this.

01:59:03.946 --> 01:59:05.987
This is how I, this is how I think.

01:59:06.448 --> 01:59:07.288
I'm so smart.

01:59:07.328 --> 01:59:10.531
I've got, I've got shit spinning around in my head all the time.

01:59:11.818 --> 01:59:17.784
And they've led scientists to an extraordinary new insight that autism begins in the womb.

01:59:18.465 --> 01:59:19.626
Oh!

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:21.368
It begins in the womb.

01:59:21.428 --> 01:59:28.395
That's why all these beautiful children at around age one and a half start to beat their head against the wall and scream and shit their pants.

01:59:29.596 --> 01:59:33.020
Stop looking at their parents in the eye because it starts in the womb.

01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:37.852
Well, then I guess we're gonna have to vaccinate kids in the womb, huh?

01:59:37.952 --> 01:59:42.195
I mean, the only way to fix this would be to genetically modify children when we find the gene.

01:59:42.295 --> 01:59:47.559
Early developmental processes, so somewhere between 10 and 24 weeks or so of gestation.

01:59:49.201 --> 01:59:52.383
We don't know everything that causes autism at this point.

01:59:52.803 --> 01:59:54.905
But they are sure that it happens in the womb.

01:59:56.454 --> 02:00:01.161
So, you know, a COVID vaccine or a flu vaccine before your baby's born, that's no problem.

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:03.624
Cause this happens in the womb and it's genes.

02:00:04.225 --> 02:00:07.009
Once we find all the genes, we'll be able to solve this problem.

02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:12.937
You know, we used to think about nine, 10 years before this video, we used to think,

02:00:13.537 --> 02:00:16.500
that chronic fatigue syndrome was caused by a virus.

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:24.467
And we used to think that autism was caused by a virus that was just latent in your body and then activated by vaccines.

02:00:24.527 --> 02:00:30.713
And one of the foremost proponents of that idea descended from the same mentor chain that Robert Malone did.

02:00:30.753 --> 02:00:32.114
Her name is Judy Mikovits.

02:00:32.635 --> 02:00:35.858
But all of the genetics is pointing to fetal origin.

02:00:38.385 --> 02:00:45.449
So as autism reveals its secrets, it's increasingly clear that childhood vaccines cannot be the cause.

02:00:45.729 --> 02:00:46.829
Cannot no way.

02:00:46.889 --> 02:00:48.610
It's increasingly clear.

02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:50.131
It cannot be the cause.

02:00:50.511 --> 02:00:52.372
Who's a pretty girl.

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.113
It wasn't my fault.

02:00:54.873 --> 02:01:02.479
for not knowing the irreducible complexity of my own kid and trusting the irreducible complexity of my kid.

02:01:02.499 --> 02:01:03.961
And it's not my fault.

02:01:09.946 --> 02:01:11.106
Make no mistake about it.

02:01:11.147 --> 02:01:14.569
I think it's my fault that my daughter got the vaccines that she did.

02:01:14.609 --> 02:01:18.753
And if there's anything wrong with her as a result of it, it's my fault.

02:01:20.117 --> 02:01:23.919
Because as an academic biologist, I should have known.

02:01:24.179 --> 02:01:32.643
I already knew that they were going all in on these genetic things, even though that's not possible to explain it.

02:01:33.523 --> 02:01:39.146
I already knew that they were going all in on this genetic thing with cancer, and there's no way that that could explain it.

02:01:39.706 --> 02:01:42.307
But still, I was trying to play the game.

02:01:42.707 --> 02:01:45.188
I was trying to become an Akata magician myself.

02:01:45.588 --> 02:01:48.550
And so I just couldn't get past the,

02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:50.651
I just couldn't get past it.

02:01:50.711 --> 02:02:00.094
I couldn't reconcile the incongruencies that I was seeing and start to understand the system as a whole being broken until COVID showed it to me.

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:10.397
And the system itself threw me out against my own wishes and only kicking and screaming did I come to this realization, of course.

02:02:16.061 --> 02:02:25.507
Just as the underlying causes of autism are being illuminated, there's another controversy brewing, this time around a vaccine that prevents cancer.

02:02:27.188 --> 02:02:27.868
Cervical cancer.

02:02:28.028 --> 02:02:39.315
Exactly on time with Vaxxed 2, which is of course about preventing cervical cancer, HPV vaccine, here it comes.

02:02:40.356 --> 02:02:44.579
the most awful, awful product on the market today.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.141
Sure is a horrible way to die.

02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:49.403
There have been severe reactions up to and including death as a result.

02:02:49.483 --> 02:02:51.585
And she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.

02:02:51.625 --> 02:02:53.586
Do I want to take my chances of dying with cancer?

02:02:53.606 --> 02:02:56.288
The vaccine protects against a sexually transmitted disease.

02:02:56.349 --> 02:02:57.950
Humor mongering, ignorance.

02:02:58.230 --> 02:03:05.476
The vaccine to protect against HPV, human papillomavirus, has generated an unusual amount of publicity.

02:03:06.497 --> 02:03:11.661
Those are all cells dividing, so I don't know why they keep showing cells dividing while they're talking about a virus.

02:03:12.562 --> 02:03:16.465
HPV is the most common cancer-causing virus on Earth.

02:03:17.186 --> 02:03:21.290
THE MOST COMMON CANCER-CAUSING VIRUS ON EARTH.

02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:25.273
That is a pretty definitive statement that is probably incorrect.

02:03:25.814 --> 02:03:29.577
Around 80% of Americans will catch it at some stage in their life.

02:03:29.597 --> 02:03:30.178
Holy shit.

02:03:31.274 --> 02:03:35.218
For most, it's harmless, but for some, it causes cancer.

02:03:35.238 --> 02:03:43.565
So something that is found in 80% of people, they think they're gonna eliminate by giving kids a shot when they're teenagers before they have sex.

02:03:43.625 --> 02:03:44.286
That's amazing.

02:03:44.406 --> 02:03:44.766
Cancer.

02:03:46.408 --> 02:03:51.492
Every year, over 25,000 HPV-related cancers occur in the U.S.

02:03:52.233 --> 02:03:56.537
Many are cervical cancers in females or throat cancers in males.

02:03:57.079 --> 02:03:59.780
So people often say they wish they could prevent cancer.

02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.141
This vaccine prevents cancer.

02:04:02.381 --> 02:04:03.541
Imagine saying that.

02:04:03.761 --> 02:04:11.464
Imagine how stupid you need to be, how naive you need to be to say that into a camera in 2017.

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:13.885
That's how bamboozled these people are.

02:04:13.925 --> 02:04:15.085
It's not her expertise.

02:04:15.605 --> 02:04:17.386
She didn't make HPV vaccine.

02:04:17.446 --> 02:04:19.527
She didn't formulate Gardasil.

02:04:19.547 --> 02:04:25.489
She's got no, she's just got a broken circuit in her head

02:04:26.129 --> 02:04:34.156
that thinks that vaccines with a small V are all proven to be fine, and that the immune system is just that easy to augment.

02:04:35.457 --> 02:04:38.239
And that's how poor her biological training is.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.161
Who doesn't want that for their child?

02:04:44.804 --> 02:04:46.866
Amy Middleman is a mother of three.

02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:55.153
She's also an adolescent pediatrician involved in assessing the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.

02:05:00.296 --> 02:05:03.821
She vaccinated her children as soon as it became available.

02:05:04.863 --> 02:05:09.430
I am a little confused by the drama around this vaccine.

02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:11.393
To me, this is a life-saving vaccine.

02:05:11.453 --> 02:05:13.296
I can't imagine not giving it to my children.

02:05:13.530 --> 02:05:14.851
That is just incredible.

02:05:15.291 --> 02:05:16.432
That is just fricking incredible.

02:05:16.452 --> 02:05:24.737
On the other hand, I think sometimes we expect parents to have all of the data that we have as physicians.

02:05:24.817 --> 02:05:26.098
You don't have any data.

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:27.059
You liar.

02:05:27.559 --> 02:05:28.940
That is so terrible.

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:34.564
Providers is to make sure we separate the issues and bring forth the important ones that should be.

02:05:34.664 --> 02:05:36.245
She works with Paul Offit by the way.

02:05:36.445 --> 02:05:38.946
Okay, and then just one is needed for the patient.

02:05:38.986 --> 02:05:40.226
I think it's the same hospital.

02:05:40.246 --> 02:05:44.948
The key is to vaccinate boys and girls before they're ever exposed to the virus.

02:05:45.888 --> 02:05:48.449
That is, before they become sexually active.

02:05:48.469 --> 02:05:49.210
I know, isn't it?

02:05:49.770 --> 02:05:53.011
It's recommended for every boy and girl at age 11 and 12.

02:05:53.771 --> 02:05:55.232
This is just like everything else.

02:05:55.272 --> 02:05:59.473
You want to get the vaccine before you have a risk of getting the disease so that it protects you.

02:05:59.533 --> 02:06:00.033
Look at her.

02:06:00.073 --> 02:06:01.074
Oh my gosh, it's gross.

02:06:01.114 --> 02:06:04.075
Around 60 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been given in the U.S.

02:06:06.539 --> 02:06:10.182
Like all vaccines, it's carefully monitored for safety.

02:06:10.442 --> 02:06:11.162
Carefully monitored?

02:06:11.182 --> 02:06:14.905
There have been claims of rare, serious reactions, even deaths.

02:06:16.146 --> 02:06:18.287
These have been carefully investigated.

02:06:18.928 --> 02:06:23.771
There are no serious adverse events associated with this vaccine in a causal way.

02:06:25.232 --> 02:06:28.474
This is one of the safest vaccines that we have to offer.

02:06:28.974 --> 02:06:29.155
Wow.

02:06:29.175 --> 02:06:30.135
And it prevents cancer.

02:06:30.796 --> 02:06:32.617
I mean, that's spectacular commitment.

02:06:32.717 --> 02:06:33.878
And it prevents cancer.

02:06:35.575 --> 02:06:36.716
And it prevents cancer.

02:06:40.219 --> 02:06:42.982
This is the extent of the expertise of these people.

02:06:43.022 --> 02:06:44.904
You don't need to trust your doctor anymore.

02:06:44.944 --> 02:06:49.488
They have been overwhelmed, overworked, and overregulated.

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.082
and they don't have a real role in our health anymore.

02:06:53.122 --> 02:06:57.545
Otherwise they would have counseled you about breastfeeding your kid.

02:06:57.585 --> 02:07:04.110
They would have counseled you in a way that you knew what your sacred biology was before you ever had a child.

02:07:04.150 --> 02:07:05.491
But that's not what this is about.

02:07:05.531 --> 02:07:06.732
They work for the state.

02:07:07.193 --> 02:07:11.356
They work for the public health department that gives them money for this shit.

02:07:12.697 --> 02:07:17.438
For some, the link between the HPV vaccine and sex is a concern.

02:07:17.718 --> 02:07:20.258
I have reservations about the HPV vaccine.

02:07:20.838 --> 02:07:22.959
It's for a sexually transmitted disease.

02:07:23.159 --> 02:07:30.960
Understand that in 2022, when I was still a dumbass with my head in the ground, they tried to give my kids the HPV vaccine.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.201
And I said, is it okay if we skip that one?

02:07:35.701 --> 02:07:42.382
And I made my boys take their shots to go to the new school, which was, I think, a MMR or some shit.

02:07:51.656 --> 02:07:54.439
And I was made to feel bad that I didn't want to do that one.

02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:56.762
No, you can do that later.

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:57.683
That can be done later.

02:08:02.248 --> 02:08:11.879
I don't think my kids will ever go to another doctor again until we meet one that understands us and thinks about our biology the way we think about it.

02:08:13.601 --> 02:08:28.484
and not the way the CDC and the Human Genome Project, Kevin McCairn, and Kevin McKernan, and Jessica Rose, and Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Bobby Kennedy, and Mary Holland, and

02:08:29.225 --> 02:08:43.662
I can and all these other people would like you to think about it, which is about human rights, not about individual rights, but human rights and the need to weigh the needs of the few with the needs of the many or some bullshit.

02:08:47.915 --> 02:08:53.079
We need to take back that real estate that is our consciousness and take it back quick.

02:08:53.179 --> 02:08:58.003
Studies show that any intimate contact, perhaps even deep kissing, can spread the virus.

02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:12.635
Deep kissing, so if you want your kid to be able to make out even, it doesn't have to be that your kid's promiscuous.

02:09:13.055 --> 02:09:16.859
You don't have to have a promiscuous teenager in order to need this vaccine.

02:09:17.299 --> 02:09:23.765
They are finding every screw to turn and turning those screws, and they've been doing it since before the pandemic.

02:09:23.785 --> 02:09:24.906
We just weren't paying attention.

02:09:27.769 --> 02:09:31.933
And getting the vaccine does not mean people start having sex earlier.

02:09:33.325 --> 02:09:44.814
That is a wonderful example of how they start making you ask questions that are not even relevant questions.

02:09:45.715 --> 02:09:52.020
None of these parents are worried that taking the HPV vaccine is going to encourage their kid to start having sex.

02:09:53.406 --> 02:09:59.049
Oh man, mom, thank goodness you're on that side where you give me the HPV vaccine.

02:09:59.109 --> 02:10:04.252
Now I feel much safer sleeping with my boyfriend than I did before you took me to the doctor.

02:10:06.173 --> 02:10:10.115
But PBS News reassuring parents that don't worry.

02:10:10.595 --> 02:10:15.178
If you give your kids this vaccine, that's not going to make them suddenly start having sex.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.521
They are actually showing you how it's done.

02:10:22.561 --> 02:10:26.182
They're having a whole conversation about a stupid question with stupid answers.

02:10:27.042 --> 02:10:30.103
If I give my kid this vaccine, will they start having sex?

02:10:30.543 --> 02:10:31.464
I don't want that.

02:10:31.884 --> 02:10:33.104
I believe in chastity.

02:10:35.685 --> 02:10:40.026
And then the PBS NewsHour works it out with their very warm voice in the background.

02:10:40.446 --> 02:10:42.567
And it really feels like, oh, I get it.

02:10:43.663 --> 02:10:51.025
But what you did by watching this bullshit with me is that you were briefly tricked into asking if that's even a relevant question.

02:10:51.105 --> 02:10:53.006
What are the possible answers to it?

02:10:53.906 --> 02:11:03.549
And that's no different than how this exact same national security, biosecurity state tricked us into asking a question about, wow, I wonder where this virus came from.

02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:06.710
Do they really know how prevalent it is in the background?

02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:11.472
Can they know how many false positive PCR tests are occurring?

02:11:14.887 --> 02:11:23.571
And as long as you run around in their own made hamster wheels, you're asking questions that accept the presupposition of the narrative, which is that vaccines are fine.

02:11:23.991 --> 02:11:28.053
There is no causal relation between any of these things.

02:11:28.574 --> 02:11:31.235
And so let's just move on and stop being so nuts.

02:11:33.316 --> 02:11:39.899
The sex part, the way in which you get the target disease is irrelevant.

02:11:41.584 --> 02:11:46.787
We don't talk about diphtheria and how you get diphtheria before we give the Tdap vaccine.

02:11:48.048 --> 02:11:51.990
How they're getting exposed is irrelevant to the ability to prevent the disease.

02:11:53.711 --> 02:11:55.432
I want her to make the decision.

02:11:55.512 --> 02:11:56.853
I mean, it's very magical, right?

02:11:56.913 --> 02:12:04.137
It's very, very magical how they made it about sex and teen sex, which we know that all parents of teens are worried about at least a little bit.

02:12:07.409 --> 02:12:08.351
But think about this.

02:12:08.431 --> 02:12:10.434
This is exactly how this is done.

02:12:10.494 --> 02:12:21.052
It's a limited spectrum of debate that is constructed out of whole cloth and then waved around like a flag that's worth waving that has two sides to argue about.

02:12:21.812 --> 02:12:22.633
or more sites.

02:12:23.113 --> 02:12:24.695
When she gets of age.

02:12:25.056 --> 02:12:26.437
Again, you know how I feel about it.

02:12:26.477 --> 02:12:27.438
I strongly recommend it.

02:12:27.498 --> 02:12:29.300
I try to prevent disease whenever I can.

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:35.106
So, but we can definitely get you the flu vaccine today and we'll keep talking about the HPV vaccine if that's okay with you.

02:12:35.527 --> 02:12:36.127
Patients come.

02:12:36.147 --> 02:12:42.114
And so as long as you take one intramuscular injection or another, you're accepting their shit anyway.

02:12:43.848 --> 02:12:51.993
Do you honestly think that it's possible that the HPV vaccine might be a dangerous intramuscular injection, but the flu vaccine's fine?

02:12:53.995 --> 02:12:56.857
Made by the same people with the same indemnity.

02:12:56.877 --> 02:12:57.817
Like, wow.

02:12:57.857 --> 02:13:00.839
Just asking for reassurance about these decisions.

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:10.386
And if they don't get strong reassurance, it's pretty easy to put it off until the next visit or the next visit, or I'll think about it maybe the next time.

02:13:11.673 --> 02:13:14.174
We're not talking about a cold that's going to go away.

02:13:14.255 --> 02:13:15.055
This is cancer.

02:13:15.515 --> 02:13:19.337
And this is what we've been working for for years, are ways to prevent cancer.

02:13:20.898 --> 02:13:24.080
We have been looking for ways to prevent cancer.

02:13:24.821 --> 02:13:27.462
And so is this the most abundant kind of cancer?

02:13:28.643 --> 02:13:32.545
Is this the most prevalent kind of cancer?

02:13:32.565 --> 02:13:35.807
I don't understand why they chose this one to be the one.

02:13:37.039 --> 02:13:43.201
For me, personally, I believe that they chose this one to be a new one because they could make this argument.

02:13:43.881 --> 02:13:50.502
They were able to successfully get over this threshold of, how are we gonna sell this to people?

02:13:50.682 --> 02:13:52.843
Oh, let's make it about teen sex.

02:13:53.423 --> 02:13:54.963
Let's make it about teen sex.

02:13:55.444 --> 02:14:03.185
And if it's about teen sex, then teens, and we can give it to teens, and it'll prevent something, and it'll be cancer, and it's perfect.

02:14:03.445 --> 02:14:04.546
Oh, wow, that sounds great.

02:14:04.626 --> 02:14:05.446
Okay, let's try it.

02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:13.683
On the other side of Oklahoma City, one woman knows only too well the cost of not being able to prevent her daughter's cancer.

02:14:16.055 --> 02:14:19.617
Jennifer was 37 years old and she died.

02:14:19.737 --> 02:14:33.206
And so now they use an example of somebody who dies of cancer as a reason for the vaccine without ever suggesting that there's real data that shows that people who are vaccinated are fine, they don't get cancer or they don't get whatever.

02:14:33.686 --> 02:14:38.569
And there's no indication, there's no investigation into what they might else get, you know, like,

02:14:40.765 --> 02:14:42.646
from cervical cancer.

02:14:42.986 --> 02:14:43.566
It's gross.

02:14:43.746 --> 02:14:46.128
It's really gross cancer in her liver.

02:14:47.048 --> 02:14:51.150
She looks super healthy in her right hip.

02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:55.772
And so she had cancer all over her body, but it must've been because she skipped a vaccine.

02:14:55.852 --> 02:14:57.693
How malevolent can it get?

02:14:57.813 --> 02:14:58.194
I don't know.

02:14:59.774 --> 02:15:04.877
And so she died of the effects of the cancer, which was spreading through her body.

02:15:08.798 --> 02:15:11.765
If there was something I could have done to protect her, of course I would have.

02:15:15.558 --> 02:15:26.121
The idea now that parents can vaccinate their children to prevent most cervical cancers, you know, I just wish that that had been available to us.

02:15:26.961 --> 02:15:27.741
The idea.

02:15:27.821 --> 02:15:28.942
She said the idea.

02:15:29.782 --> 02:15:30.842
It's not a reality.

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.663
The idea is available.

02:15:33.303 --> 02:15:34.763
The idea is out there.

02:15:35.063 --> 02:15:36.884
And she wishes it would have been available.

02:15:36.924 --> 02:15:39.744
That's all she's saying because there is nothing else.

02:15:41.305 --> 02:15:44.786
And the movie Vaxxed 2 came out in this same year

02:15:45.836 --> 02:15:48.617
And so you can see why Frontline had to put this show up.

02:15:49.077 --> 02:15:51.958
To have changed the course of Jennifer's life.

02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:58.560
It just makes me very, very sad.

02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:03.882
I'm sorry.

02:16:08.112 --> 02:16:21.957
As a mother and as a pediatrician, I think one of the biggest fears that I have, and have always had, is that one of my children will get sick and I can't do anything about it.

02:16:22.757 --> 02:16:26.659
Or one of my patients will get sick and I can't do anything about it.

02:16:27.239 --> 02:16:30.400
And to be able to prevent that is such a gift.

02:16:36.232 --> 02:16:43.434
Vaccines deliver a remarkable but often invisible gift, protecting against diseases we may never see around us.

02:16:45.355 --> 02:16:49.336
Yet for parents, it can be hard not to worry about potential risks.

02:16:54.258 --> 02:16:57.399
All of our lives is surrounded by the risks of everyday.

02:16:58.279 --> 02:17:00.840
I walk across the street, I could be hit by a car.

02:17:06.052 --> 02:17:10.835
We live with risk because it's part of what we all face in terms of getting what we want.

02:17:11.455 --> 02:17:12.556
I want to come to the football game.

02:17:12.616 --> 02:17:14.737
I want to have a fun day with my family.

02:17:15.318 --> 02:17:20.321
And those benefits are worth putting myself at risk.

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:32.048
Many people worry about the risks of serious adverse events or side effects.

02:17:32.128 --> 02:17:33.329
Still this guy again.

02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:35.050
How risky is that really?

02:17:36.627 --> 02:17:39.949
Like any medication, vaccines are not risk-free.

02:17:39.969 --> 02:17:40.750
I know what they're going to do.

02:17:40.770 --> 02:17:44.452
They're going to use the number of people at this game to show you how risky it is.

02:17:44.812 --> 02:17:46.073
Oh, my shit.

02:17:46.113 --> 02:17:46.953
Here it comes.

02:17:47.734 --> 02:17:50.936
But the risk of a severe side effect is extremely small.

02:17:52.437 --> 02:18:01.062
For a life-threatening event like a severe allergic reaction, it's around one in one million, ten times the number of people in this stadium.

02:18:02.043 --> 02:18:05.605
These kinds of serious reactions are really that rare.

02:18:06.835 --> 02:18:20.820
Yet parents may worry about side effects, even when they... That means that there should only be about 300 people in a country of 350 million that are injured in some way by vaccines.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:21.980
Only 350 people.

02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.281
One in a million, 350 million people, let's say 400.

02:18:24.321 --> 02:18:27.502
400 autistic people, 400 vaccine injured people in America, that's it.

02:18:37.278 --> 02:18:39.880
What we think about is, what's gonna happen to my kid?

02:18:41.502 --> 02:18:45.966
What if my kid is the one kid who happens to have this happen to them?

02:18:48.628 --> 02:18:52.892
One of the things we have to remember in medicine is that it's a balancing act.

02:18:52.952 --> 02:18:55.995
Here we are with an Australian again, loyal crown people.

02:18:56.916 --> 02:18:59.739
Really, everything is measuring risk versus benefits.

02:19:00.199 --> 02:19:02.061
This is a truth of vaccines as well.

02:19:03.442 --> 02:19:05.022
There are risks, there are benefits.

02:19:05.082 --> 02:19:09.543
The risks happen to be minuscule of serious side reactions.

02:19:10.084 --> 02:19:11.344
The benefits are enormous.

02:19:11.944 --> 02:19:14.725
Why should I take health advice from somebody that looks like that?

02:19:15.945 --> 02:19:22.167
Vaccines protect us individually, in case the person next to us is carrying a dangerous germ.

02:19:23.067 --> 02:19:27.948
And the higher the overall vaccination rate, the more protection for everyone.

02:19:30.461 --> 02:19:32.347
because it's only the vaccination rate.

02:19:32.367 --> 02:19:34.253
It isn't the health of the population.

02:19:35.447 --> 02:19:41.111
It isn't the exposure to things like glyphosate and processed foods and chemicals.

02:19:41.571 --> 02:19:44.573
It isn't the exposure to pesticides.

02:19:44.633 --> 02:19:46.715
It isn't the exposure to bad water.

02:19:47.155 --> 02:19:50.297
It isn't the anything else that these people might be exposed to.

02:19:50.337 --> 02:19:55.941
It is just whether or not a certain percentage of them has taken the recommended CDC dose or not.

02:19:56.381 --> 02:20:03.086
And that's how you can see how much bullshit is really being pushed on us and was being pushed very hard.

02:20:03.959 --> 02:20:04.981
before the pandemic.

02:20:05.722 --> 02:20:16.237
In 2017, right when, you know, Bret Weinstein is again getting all excited and getting half a million dollars for getting yelled at by some students.

02:20:29.222 --> 02:20:36.787
In 1955, this is where Dr. Thomas Francis announced to the world the outcome of the polio vaccine trials.

02:20:37.047 --> 02:20:41.791
And he told the world that the vaccine was safe, effective, and potent.

02:20:42.631 --> 02:20:51.597
I love having this conversation here in this room because what we really need to do is to get back into the mindset of the people who were sitting here in 1955.

02:20:52.137 --> 02:20:58.302
They looked at the vaccine trials and said, is this a better choice?

02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:08.444
not a perfect choice, a better choice than what we face if we do not vaccinate.

02:21:09.505 --> 02:21:21.370
Because the less often we vaccinate, the more our lives will be touched, perhaps slowly at first, but eventually more and more by diseases that we once thought were gone.

02:21:24.616 --> 02:21:25.316
It's amazing.

02:21:26.017 --> 02:21:27.897
It's absolutely amazing.

02:21:27.957 --> 02:21:31.679
Baby Osman spent 17 days in the hospital with whooping cough.

02:21:33.499 --> 02:21:35.680
No one knows who spread the deadly germ to him.

02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:36.180
Ha!

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.041
Only that he was one of the lucky ones.

02:21:38.281 --> 02:21:39.501
Who spread the germ!

02:21:39.521 --> 02:21:42.042
Now six months old, he's recovering well.

02:21:45.644 --> 02:21:51.866
Across America and the world, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases continue to be reported.

02:21:53.095 --> 02:21:57.741
In Michigan and several other states, personal exemption rates have risen above 5%.

02:21:59.624 --> 02:22:04.891
Some states, like California, have passed laws making it more difficult for parents to opt out.

02:22:07.136 --> 02:22:11.578
Wherever they live, parents continue to weigh what's best for their children.

02:22:12.519 --> 02:22:16.080
And health officials continue to worry about saving lives.

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:17.081
Oh, yeah, they do.

02:22:17.341 --> 02:22:18.241
Oh, yeah, they do.

02:22:18.421 --> 02:22:19.922
We all inhabit this planet together.

02:22:20.462 --> 02:22:23.143
We all make decisions that affect not only us, but others.

02:22:24.404 --> 02:22:29.887
And I would like to believe that there is something in us that allows us to see it that way.

02:22:31.747 --> 02:22:32.488
Communist.

02:22:33.888 --> 02:22:34.609
Collectivist.

02:22:36.857 --> 02:22:37.758
Collectivist!

02:22:49.597 --> 02:22:51.199
I don't know what to say other than, um...

02:22:56.101 --> 02:22:56.981
It was a bad show.

02:22:57.001 --> 02:22:59.743
I don't like it any more than you do.

02:23:02.504 --> 02:23:03.544
This is the way it is.

02:23:04.385 --> 02:23:14.289
We have a lot of work to do because we definitely need to establish a new consensus about what transfection was before the pandemic.

02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:19.372
We need to establish a new consensus about what the vaccine schedule was before the pandemic.

02:23:19.992 --> 02:23:26.677
and we need to establish a new consensus about what their motivations were and their immunomythology was.

02:23:26.777 --> 02:23:42.428
What myths and legends were they telling us before the pandemic that have dovetailed seamlessly with the start of and the execution of the national security exercise that was the pandemic, where they murdered Americans and lied around the world

02:23:43.168 --> 02:23:46.891
about what that meant about the existence of a pandemic.

02:23:46.991 --> 02:23:50.614
Lock down the world based on the murder and lies in America.

02:23:51.114 --> 02:23:54.917
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in the humans that you love.

02:23:55.498 --> 02:23:57.880
And hopefully we will see each other again tomorrow.

02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:59.321
Thank you very much for being here.

02:23:59.741 --> 02:24:04.885
If you'd like to support the stream, you can go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support.

02:24:04.945 --> 02:24:09.228
And if you want to share the stream after broadcast, please share stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:24:10.049 --> 02:24:31.655
because we're actually spending our money on that one, and there are no algorithms, no sign-up, no ads, and more importantly, YouTube or Twitch or something else can't serve up a bullshit ad or a bullshit video after one of ours, but instead, more likely after watching one of mine, maybe you'll watch one of Mark's or maybe just share a clip, that kind of thing.

02:24:31.695 --> 02:24:32.956
Thanks very much for joining me.

02:24:33.376 --> 02:24:36.457
Remember that Mark lost his third channel, so he has

02:24:37.277 --> 02:24:38.237
Number one is gone.

02:24:38.257 --> 02:24:40.658
Number three is gone and number two has two strikes.

02:24:40.678 --> 02:24:57.522
So he really can't stream that often I'm gonna try and see if I can get him on my program in the next couple days and in the meantime make sure you reach out to him in any way that you can and share his archive on Bitchute and on rumble and share his frickin website for goodness sakes That's the thing that gets ignored the most.

02:24:57.562 --> 02:24:58.203
Thank you very much.

02:24:58.743 --> 02:24:59.543
I'll see you again tomorrow

02:26:45.356 --> 02:26:48.443
Yeah, let's try to start following each other on the soapbox.

02:26:48.483 --> 02:26:49.485
Let's make it a network.

02:26:49.926 --> 02:26:50.928
Let's make it happen.

02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:52.631
See you guys tomorrow.
