01:38.740 --> 01:40.922
Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

01:41.462 --> 01:43.264
This guy's been talked about for years.

01:43.864 --> 01:47.828
You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things.

01:49.169 --> 01:51.811
And are people still talking about this guy, this creep?

01:53.032 --> 01:55.234
Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?

01:55.754 --> 01:57.576
This guy's been talked about for years.

01:58.176 --> 01:58.717
You're asking.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.252
I think truth is good for kids.

02:08.693 --> 02:12.538
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

02:12.998 --> 02:14.621
We want everybody to feel good.

02:14.641 --> 02:16.964
That's not the way life is.

02:53.376 --> 02:54.577
I don't care how you get there.

02:54.597 --> 02:57.261
I don't care what you do to get there.

02:57.281 --> 02:59.904
The goal is to win.

03:13.237 --> 03:16.340
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.901
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

03:18.101 --> 03:19.002
Welcome to the show.

03:19.062 --> 03:25.267
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

03:26.548 --> 03:28.050
We stay focused on the biology.

03:28.090 --> 03:32.393
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors here.

03:34.625 --> 03:41.808
It is really important to understand that one of our main messages is to try your best to get yourself off of social media.

03:42.648 --> 03:48.871
Much more importantly, start to educate your kids about how social media can be used.

03:50.091 --> 04:01.917
Liars can use social media in concert to market products, but also to really to market different political ideas and even different societal changes.

04:02.937 --> 04:07.461
And so we've got to get off of social media and start using it more efficiently.

04:08.481 --> 04:27.816
If you want to drop a bomb at the next barbecue you're at, drop the bomb that autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

04:28.937 --> 04:32.280
Same thing can be said for pandemics and gain-of-functions.

04:32.340 --> 04:37.724
They are also mythologies used to make sure that these things are never questioned.

04:38.925 --> 04:40.906
And they use it very effectively.

04:41.627 --> 04:55.417
It's because it's a long con, and most importantly, it's because we have acquiesced to the use of social media as some kind of substitute for a normal social network, a normal printed medium.

04:57.847 --> 05:13.445
It's really become obvious to me that if you are not required to put out a solid print magazine or even a PDF with a date on it, you are essentially allowed to change history.

05:14.046 --> 05:17.129
And those people that hold the keys to those archives

05:18.230 --> 05:19.250
can change history.

05:19.370 --> 05:35.054
Even the Wayback Machine could in theory be seeded with a whole bunch of snapshots of a website that never existed to make people believe that something was leaked a long time ago or that somebody was ahead of things when in fact they were not.

05:36.035 --> 05:41.296
I don't think you can underestimate how bad things have gotten with regard to the falseness on the internet.

05:43.193 --> 05:47.237
And so I'm starting to really default to everything being false.

05:47.257 --> 05:54.725
You can see here, this is in July 19th, 2020 on a Sunday.

05:54.825 --> 06:02.152
I'm explaining how I think we have a lot of background noise and they are using a non-specific PCR test.

06:02.993 --> 06:03.694
to dupe us.

06:04.314 --> 06:08.257
I got better at explaining this, but this is pretty remarkable if you think about it.

06:09.457 --> 06:11.799
This is six years ago now, essentially.

06:12.379 --> 06:14.881
JC in the Woods, Coffee and Birdsong.

06:15.962 --> 06:24.467
And nobody's really approached questioning this idea, not even the great Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project.

06:24.988 --> 06:28.490
Don't forget to follow this substack and share this one with your family and friends.

06:29.211 --> 06:32.473
The reason why you want to share this substack with your family and friends

06:33.533 --> 06:42.917
is because, I'm sorry, I got that wrong, because the videos and the stories are so tragic and so obvious.

06:44.138 --> 06:53.842
And I think it will bring into focus the idea that people are not aware of what happened to their own loved ones and they may want to look into the

06:54.802 --> 07:02.929
the hospital records of how their loved ones were treated in the hospital in America to see if anything untoward actually occurred.

07:02.989 --> 07:09.194
Now that you understand that this was largely a protocol disaster and that certain protocols are a problem,

07:09.955 --> 07:21.683
You can just casually look up and see if Aunt Jo got some supplementary oxygen when she was taken to the hospital and then that somehow led to a viral pneumonia.

07:21.723 --> 07:33.170
And if anybody in your doctor's office believes in a viral pneumonia, then you basically have a puppet there, a clown, a bamboozled person.

07:34.335 --> 07:37.578
This is a message from an American to Americans.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.681
I'm broadcasting to the world, CQCQDX.

07:43.042 --> 07:51.389
But a lot of what I'm saying is particularly relevant to Americans where I live, where my kids live, where my kids play basketball.

07:52.443 --> 08:12.353
And so I'm very keen to wake Americans up, just because I think even if America were to wake up and throw off the shackles of social media, you know, this is a graphic depiction of how social media was used to overwhelm people with the illusion of the pandemic.

08:13.053 --> 08:19.937
And if you didn't see the pandemic as a wave that you had to avoid with masks and lockdowns and vaccines,

08:21.378 --> 08:23.340
then you are probably a lot better off.

08:23.380 --> 08:24.901
So you might be at the top of the wave now.

08:25.842 --> 08:34.610
But Bret Weinstein would not have put you at the top of the wave by staying focused on the biology because he still isn't focused on the biology.

08:35.611 --> 08:43.939
Somebody like, I don't know, Ryan Cole would not have got you to the top of the wave because he's taking a lot of the bait on social media.

08:45.101 --> 08:55.149
And I don't think that Robert Malone would get you anywhere near loving your neighbor seeing as he's like a homesteader who shoots at his neighbors.

08:55.990 --> 08:59.854
Anyway, the same could be said for Andrew Huff.

08:59.994 --> 09:01.675
Andrew Huff has fired over 150 rounds in one day.

09:04.037 --> 09:15.366
directed at what he thought were the Michigan State Police, according to testimony on the High Wire, one of America's leading news sources on the conservative side of the movement.

09:15.446 --> 09:21.490
So, if you want to wake your family and friends up, one of the ways to do it might be to send them to this stream.

09:21.530 --> 09:22.591
That's really how this works.

09:22.651 --> 09:26.834
People spread the word, and then kapow!

09:26.874 --> 09:28.996
People learn the biology and it suddenly makes sense.

09:29.676 --> 09:35.644
It's kind of headquartered at GigaHomeBiological.com where you can find links to all the places where the stream can be found.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.409
Rumble is my least favorite place, but it is there as well.

09:40.670 --> 09:47.499
And then there's a link called Stuff there that you can find all of the important things that I think you should download and read, especially the book.

09:49.060 --> 09:53.142
What is Life slash Mind and Matter by Mr. Schrodinger.

09:53.742 --> 10:04.707
I'm going to find a copy of this book that I've started reading by Niels Bohr called Atomic Energy and Human Knowledge.

10:05.267 --> 10:06.328
It's an interesting book.

10:06.528 --> 10:11.070
It kind of, I think, is partly the inspiration for that Schrodinger book.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.611
And so I'm excited about tearing into it.

10:13.732 --> 10:16.374
It's a little less biology than I imagined.

10:16.554 --> 10:22.118
It's actually really revealing in terms of what it tells us about how these physicists were thinking.

10:24.359 --> 10:35.027
And if you're interested in following SolarFire9's advice in the chat, buying old physical books I think is an actually really, really good idea.

10:35.988 --> 10:37.349
Hold on one second here.

10:40.126 --> 10:42.487
And I do, you know, I can give away my secret.

10:43.548 --> 10:45.469
eBay is a great place to do it.

10:45.950 --> 10:48.831
The real trick with eBay is to browse.

10:48.931 --> 10:57.577
The real trick with eBay is to not buy the first iteration of something that you see just because the description is really good, the pictures are nice.

10:58.277 --> 11:14.926
and it seems to fit your imaginary price point of what you would pay for that book because you might be surprised that if now that you know the title of a book that you didn't know before by searching for for example I don't know books and phages you might look for bacteriophages books like that

11:15.726 --> 11:28.993
You might see that the book that you want is named this and then search for that title and then find it You know public, you know, it could be anywhere from $45 with free shipping to $5 For free shipping.

11:29.093 --> 11:35.096
I the other day I got you know, my wife laughs at me a lot about this, but the other day I

11:36.874 --> 11:39.236
You know who really doesn't laugh about it is my mailman.

11:40.357 --> 11:47.042
The other day I got a box that I bought on eBay for $35, which sounds like it's a lot.

11:48.243 --> 11:51.145
But it had nine bird books in it.

11:51.445 --> 11:54.688
And they were very, they're very, very, very nice bird books.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.009
A couple of them old, the yada, yada, yada.

11:58.370 --> 12:00.132
eBay is a really, really nice place.

12:01.553 --> 12:05.316
And again, it's, if you're going to waste your time somewhere,

12:06.232 --> 12:06.452
Right?

12:06.652 --> 12:07.273
On the internet.

12:07.433 --> 12:32.307
You're gonna scroll through YouTube, then you better know who you're looking for and you better go to somebody like, I don't know, maybe Lewis Rossman, although Joe Marshall has me thinking about Lewis Rossman and whether or not that fighting for this right to repair is kind of fighting at the wrong, sort of, uh, defending the wrong door maybe is the right way to describe it.

12:32.387 --> 12:32.687
I don't know.

12:33.779 --> 12:44.065
I've been trying to come up with an apt analogy for trying to describe some of the many ways that I think that social media can be used against us.

12:44.105 --> 12:58.333
And I think one of the ways you might think about how social media can be used against us in the context of a Lollapalooza of liars, people going on social media and scripted wittingly or unwittingly kind of coordinating this

12:59.173 --> 13:14.839
agreement across platforms and agreement across podcasts and even agreement across mainstream media that certain questions are the most important questions and if you think about it from the perspective of house defense and

13:18.860 --> 13:31.845
And you think about the idea of advocating for your family to start defending the house by locking everybody into an interior bathroom and bringing all the guns into that room and then defending the door of the bathroom.

13:32.665 --> 13:38.888
So, in other words, giving the thieves free run of your whole house, maybe even open up the garage door, I don't know.

13:39.368 --> 13:42.129
So, social media can be used

13:43.171 --> 13:53.000
very effectively if they put a, you know, a couple really well-spoken experts on guns to say that, you know, if you're going to be shooting a gun in your house, you want to know where your family is.

13:53.080 --> 14:01.929
And so the only way I would ever shoot a gun in my house is make sure that I'm shooting a gun from a room where I know all my family members are, and then I can shoot through the wall.

14:02.029 --> 14:03.230
I can do whatever I want to.

14:04.485 --> 14:10.789
And then another guy might get on and say that, you know, he's been to Iraq and for him, you know, this is the way it works in special forces.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.150
You can put the kids in the bathtub, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:13.671 --> 14:24.817
And so you have a whole series of people going talk shit on a podcast about how it's best to lock yourself in the bathroom and defend the bathroom door and give the thieves free run of the house.

14:25.378 --> 14:25.538
Now,

14:27.114 --> 14:28.856
I'm not an expert in these kinds of things.

14:28.896 --> 14:30.977
That may very well be the smartest thing to do.

14:31.017 --> 14:47.671
That may very well be what... But imagine that, on the other hand, they put videos up and say you should have security cameras, and you should get a dog, and you should teach your kids how to use a gun, and you should have good locks on your doors, and, you know, the windows should be X, Y, and Z, and whatever, and you can do this and that and the other.

14:48.351 --> 14:53.213
and you shouldn't let anybody even on your property, that's a different, completely different thing.

14:53.253 --> 15:03.496
And what I'm suggesting to you is, is that depending on what they wanted people to believe en masse, social media is capable of making people consider

15:04.997 --> 15:17.205
the idea that that is a debate worth having and that a reasonable person thinks that it would be okay to bring their whole family into the interior, you know, whatever, and you see what I mean?

15:17.925 --> 15:21.207
And so that analogy applies to anything.

15:21.247 --> 15:31.714
That analogy could apply to how people are currently thinking while they skillfully use social media, how they are currently thinking about immigration.

15:33.152 --> 15:36.600
Is the right answer that we're not stopping people at the borders?

15:36.780 --> 15:37.822
Is that the right answer?

15:37.943 --> 15:38.424
I don't know.

15:39.346 --> 15:42.152
But they certainly want us to believe that that's the right answer.

15:43.027 --> 15:55.415
Is the right answer that politicians are controlled by Jeffrey Epstein and so in order for this blackmail ring of control to go on, we can't reveal who's being blackmailed by Jeffrey Epstein?

15:55.475 --> 16:03.540
Is that real or is that just an agreement that they've created by putting a bunch of people on podcasts and agreeing that that's really the thing?

16:05.390 --> 16:13.876
Just like, are you sure the right idea is to put everybody in the bathroom and bring all the guns in the bathroom and defend the bathroom door?

16:14.056 --> 16:20.260
Or is it just because a SEAL went on a podcast and told a story about Iraq and now you believe him?

16:21.627 --> 16:29.094
And just because you saw another guy talking about it on a cooking show, and he also said the same thing, that at the restaurant, they're gonna do it like that.

16:29.714 --> 16:40.624
And so then, you know, three weeks later, there's some, the same guy you saw before is now on Joe Rogan telling the detailed story about what he did in Iraq and why it was so important to go to an interior bathroom and defend the house.

16:41.184 --> 16:42.726
And so, this is it.

16:44.547 --> 16:48.631
Social media is the trap, and you are on their spaceship.

16:50.270 --> 16:54.614
And they're in control of all the meters and all the screens you read.

16:54.674 --> 17:03.021
And so you think you're running from comms over here to the science station and to the radar and the phasers and all the buttons work.

17:03.461 --> 17:06.503
And it feels really good, but the whole thing is a set.

17:08.205 --> 17:14.510
And even the people that come through the doors and interact with you on this set are mostly fake.

17:14.630 --> 17:19.214
If you understand that, then you'll use social media in a very different way.

17:20.902 --> 17:28.664
and you'll see the noise for what it is, and you'll start to become... Becoming Amish is the only solution is not far off.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.085
It's not far off.

17:33.246 --> 17:34.266
It's not far off.

17:35.246 --> 17:38.587
I think we can turn this to our advantage a little bit though.

17:39.088 --> 17:49.891
If we start to manage our communities that we now have in that kind of independent way, and we start to think about our communities as needing to be managed in that kind of way cooperatively,

17:50.411 --> 17:52.433
It might actually be okay, it's true.

17:53.093 --> 17:54.675
But I'm not going to get into that right now.

17:55.696 --> 17:57.357
I want to switch over here.

17:58.858 --> 18:00.860
So this is for all the marbles.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.222
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

18:03.522 --> 18:11.969
And I think this message has been, you know, I think it's pretty good that there is a fake anti-vaccine movement in America.

18:12.029 --> 18:13.130
It's been there for a while.

18:14.520 --> 18:32.375
And it's not the kind of anti-vax movement that is characterized by the description that is often recited by somebody like Paul Offit, where these people are grifters, they're just trying to make money, they're just trying to sell their nutraceuticals.

18:33.223 --> 18:46.654
No, they are part of the same national security show that brought you this narrative about a laboratory leak that has gone endemic on Earth, that we have been shut down for six years, count them.

18:50.757 --> 18:58.403
This narrative is only possible because we believe, as a society, a bunch of biological myths.

19:01.266 --> 19:06.850
And if we pass these myths onto our children, they will be enslaved by those myths.

19:07.271 --> 19:26.626
And part of the slavers, that's what I like to call them, part of the slavers intention of the COVID-19 narrative is to get us, to coerce us into teaching our grandchildren this nonsense so that they believe this is what happened, they believe it can happen again.

19:29.096 --> 19:34.418
And if you hear what I'm saying to you, if you hear how I'm saying it, you can hear that it's a spell.

19:34.498 --> 19:37.859
It's a magic spell that they've cast on us with coronavirus.

19:39.840 --> 19:47.643
And so this is also best and most aptly characterized by being a future iteration of the Human Genome Project.

19:47.763 --> 19:51.404
A future iteration of the Human Genome Project.

19:52.544 --> 19:56.566
And so this whole, how can I say it?

19:59.036 --> 20:11.405
charade about a pandemic is behind it are motivations which are driven by imperatives of the next iteration of the Human Genome Project.

20:11.445 --> 20:14.788
The declaration of the Human Genome Project having been completed

20:15.831 --> 20:27.397
and hitting milestone after milestone after milestone over the last, I don't know, how many, like two decades now, they've been basically having new ribbon cutting ceremonies all the time.

20:27.497 --> 20:32.519
But essentially what we're talking about is this technology becoming better and better.

20:33.399 --> 20:40.503
And the technology becoming cheaper and cheaper, but it's still the same technology.

20:40.563 --> 20:42.484
We're still claiming to

20:44.810 --> 20:55.214
be able to read a single molecule by making many, many, many, many, many copies of it so that then we can see it.

20:56.294 --> 20:58.195
And that's the best way to think about it, right?

20:58.275 --> 21:05.058
The single DNA molecule that gets sequenced by these technologies that occasionally get very,

21:07.571 --> 21:09.914
They get offered to you very ham-fistedly.

21:09.954 --> 21:22.591
There's a number of people in this show that will tell you that there are very high... There are these sequencing things that we can do now, you know, like... It's called Millipore.

21:23.292 --> 21:26.457
And it's called, you know, nanopore sequencing.

21:26.938 --> 21:31.044
And we can just put RNA and DNA right through the little hole and then we get a reading.

21:31.104 --> 21:34.709
But what they don't tell you is, is that those readings are all probabilistic.

21:34.729 --> 21:35.931
They only get one read.

21:36.431 --> 21:37.533
And they're never certain.

21:37.593 --> 21:39.376
The certainty is actually very low.

21:42.185 --> 22:02.940
And so you can get a rough idea of what's there and what's not there based on gross homologies of sequences that you might expect related to bacteria because those background signals are plentiful and have many have been previously characterized especially with regard to humans and their microflora or microbiome.

22:05.117 --> 22:15.065
And so what we're talking about here is getting at the heart of what we are as a pattern integrity without anybody knowing it, including a lot of the people who are participating in the illusion.

22:15.105 --> 22:26.934
Because so many of these people, like for example, Brett Weinstein, or Alexandros Marinos, or even Chris Martinson, are not sophisticated enough to see through this biological mythology.

22:27.775 --> 22:33.940
The illusion of viruses, the illusion of vaccines is too strong for these people.

22:35.029 --> 22:44.778
And if you give them a semantic ladder out, like telling them, no, just think it's the intramuscular injection part, dude.

22:45.179 --> 22:51.785
And then to think that all these pseudo-intellectuals on the internet were unable to get where Mark Kulak got in about a week.

22:54.415 --> 23:11.906
after looking for, you know, to see if he could find some history of where this transition from scraping people's arms up with little metal forks and to inoculate people for smallpox to just, you know, using a needle.

23:14.007 --> 23:18.830
And the literature that he's found so far is very, very striking.

23:19.901 --> 23:31.574
Some of the latest stuff he found even suggests directly that you shouldn't put the needle into the muscle of the chicken, but insert it more shallow than that.

23:33.857 --> 23:34.518
It's striking.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.440
And so that's why this is also about ending the FDA.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.823
That's why and what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:42.883 --> 23:44.565
is ultimately doing in this picture.

23:44.605 --> 23:58.199
I think that's the reason why the Weinstein brothers are intimately involved with it, while Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and all these nutraceutical people and all these people who want to sell things that the FDA is in the way of selling.

23:59.212 --> 24:01.234
you know, fitness stuff, this kind of thing.

24:02.235 --> 24:07.379
They're all in on this, we gotta get rid of the FDA because the FDA is in the way.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.903
Because you've gotta, they regulate what's on the label.

24:11.563 --> 24:16.007
You can't say something on the label if the FDA doesn't say you can't say it.

24:16.327 --> 24:18.689
Otherwise you gotta say the FDA didn't say we could say it.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.251
That's annoying.

24:22.713 --> 24:24.475
So, let's be honest here.

24:25.387 --> 24:29.688
There is a very easy sort of frame to put this in.

24:30.728 --> 24:39.370
That in the context of sort of three or four large motivating factors, we have been bamboozled about a number of things.

24:41.151 --> 24:46.992
Because this is about our freaking grandchildren and they need to grow up believing all of these myths.

24:47.292 --> 24:51.913
And so it's full court press all the time and social media is the hardwood.

24:52.773 --> 24:58.194
The price of synthesizing virus genomes get down to about five cents a base.

24:58.274 --> 25:04.955
It's going to cost $1,500 to synthesize a coronavirus genome, which may scare the hell out of some of us.

25:05.736 --> 25:09.096
But it does allow us to ask those questions in an affordable manner.

25:09.656 --> 25:22.639
The other way to do it, even more cheaply, is to actually clone out the spike genes and make, in essence, recombinants, where you drop the spike gene of different bat coronaviruses that you think may have appropriate properties that could be emergent

25:23.035 --> 25:29.880
pre-emergent strains and characterize their ability to replicate in human cells, both primary cells and other cells in culture.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.502
So those types of questions are doable.

25:33.223 --> 25:39.568
The spike, even the spike genome, for example, is only about 4 kb, so at 10 cents a base, it's a $400 experiment.

25:43.314 --> 25:46.176
Now, maybe dual use experiments are a concern.

25:46.356 --> 25:47.177
That's another issue.

25:47.597 --> 25:52.080
Now, it's hard for me to take that and break it apart into the many pieces that it is.

25:52.220 --> 25:58.264
But suffice it to say, the gigaohm biological is asserting that even this is a charade.

25:58.444 --> 26:00.706
Even this is scripted bullshit.

26:02.106 --> 26:09.231
I really think that what you have to see here is that the primary goal is to convince you that

26:11.400 --> 26:18.583
Combinations of the wrong proteins can become very, very dangerous from a dual use perspective.

26:18.623 --> 26:20.843
You know, it could be a dual use thing, but that's another.

26:21.344 --> 26:34.729
He's even scripted to giggle and lie about that, to say that, because remember, it's about getting these ideas out there and creating an illusion of consensus that this is just what happens if you put the right things together.

26:35.949 --> 26:40.891
It's not by accident that he says specifically the spike protein and that this is so long ago.

26:41.946 --> 26:42.807
It's really not.

26:44.028 --> 26:45.730
It's all part of the scam.

26:45.790 --> 26:48.333
Just like the diffuse proposal is not leaked.

26:48.453 --> 26:50.155
It's part of the same scam.

26:50.295 --> 26:52.778
It may even be an adjusted part of the scam.

26:53.419 --> 26:57.383
An added portion of the script when things started to go out of control at the end of 2021.

27:00.441 --> 27:00.901
Who knows?

27:01.002 --> 27:13.613
Maybe the diffuse proposal was released specifically because I was saying in 2021, the drastic was full of shit that they're focused on the, the, the origins of the virus and not stopping transfection.

27:13.653 --> 27:14.994
Then that makes them a fraud.

27:15.014 --> 27:16.956
And they didn't like that.

27:17.016 --> 27:26.384
So they sent Charles Rixey to my house for goodness sakes, to convince me that the diffuse proposal was real and that me and him were the core of the American part of drastic.

27:29.898 --> 27:35.662
And I'm free to admit that I was played because there were an enormous amount of human resources spent on me.

27:36.242 --> 27:38.724
So it was very difficult for me to see through the lies.

27:39.044 --> 27:41.245
There was a lot of coordinated lying around me.

27:42.206 --> 27:46.549
Even coordinated, you know, rivalry and coordinated skepticism.

27:51.488 --> 28:07.585
And so Ralph Baric's work stands as a basis for the idea that endemicity is real and that it can be a process by which a gain-of-function virus could spread and become everlasting.

28:08.486 --> 28:14.112
And it is also the end point where the gain-of-function virus has become everlasting.

28:15.219 --> 28:24.566
And so a lot of our family and friends might not say that they believe that happened, but they certainly understand that it's a possibility now, even in the most remote sense.

28:25.727 --> 28:26.707
It's not absurd.

28:27.808 --> 28:36.835
After six years of hearing people talk about it, and it go from a absurd idea to considered my most be well, yeah, I'll be even Fauci admitted it.

28:37.435 --> 28:40.798
This is a pretty well ingrained idea.

28:42.310 --> 28:45.753
I would be even willing to bet that my son in high school could explain this.

28:46.754 --> 28:53.921
And so this is one of the things that we really need to target from the perspective of talking to people and thinking about

28:54.813 --> 28:57.394
about trying to break people free.

28:58.074 --> 29:00.194
This is one of the overarching myths.

29:00.294 --> 29:15.377
Just like autism spectrum disorder is, endemicity as a process and an endpoint is also one of these overarching myths that allows us to PCR test for 16 viruses with one PCR test and think that that makes any sense.

29:16.517 --> 29:19.298
Like Mary Talley Bowden explained on my podcast in 2022.

29:21.075 --> 29:22.637
And so I want you to stay focused.

29:23.078 --> 29:29.247
I want you to not take their bait, but if you're using social media, that focus, it's very hard to keep it.

29:30.489 --> 29:32.432
And that's why this message is serious.

29:32.492 --> 29:34.074
Like these people are not serious.

29:34.114 --> 29:35.016
They are performers.

29:37.279 --> 29:43.802
and they have performed in order to usurp or essentially take all the teeth out of the FDA.

29:44.202 --> 29:45.802
That's what you see here right now.

29:45.942 --> 30:01.168
Five years these guys were performing on YouTube together with the express purpose of being legitimized as people promoted to where they are now, taking over the one part of HHS.

30:02.970 --> 30:18.250
which would have any authority to look back on the PCR testing during COVID to re-evaluate or publish all of the tests that were used and who used them and where they were sourced and let people sort it out.

30:19.144 --> 30:24.687
and try to figure out who was killed and who wasn't and what did we count, nothing will ever be done.

30:25.267 --> 30:33.812
And instead that whole methodology has basically passed right past FDA and they're not regulating at all as far as I can tell.

30:34.977 --> 30:35.997
That's remarkable.

30:36.638 --> 31:00.545
That is remarkable because these people are talking about all kinds of other things at the FDA that have nothing to do with PCR testing being regulated, sequencing being regulated, or the remnants of these tests being regulated as potential DNA samples that should be protected as part of your privacy rights.

31:01.212 --> 31:07.456
That's definitely not gonna be something that the FDA worries about with these guys at the head.

31:11.738 --> 31:14.019
Number of spots filled up within hours.

31:14.660 --> 31:16.381
It was like a Taylor Swift concert.

31:18.024 --> 31:24.507
And I think it speaks to just how important this topic is and how... This was two days ago, I believe.

31:25.207 --> 31:32.690
And this is just the introductory little remarks from this foreigner and, I believe, scripted trader.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.711
It resonates with everybody.

31:36.391 --> 31:41.493
An effort that's meaningful with a clear roadmap to reduce animal testing.

31:41.794 --> 31:44.835
And that has a lot of implications, as we're going to hear about this morning.

31:46.616 --> 31:51.800
For one, it can help deliver cures and meaningful treatments faster to the public.

31:52.861 --> 32:03.509
Number two, it can reduce R&D costs and potentially even translate into lower drug prices, which is an important agenda item for this administration.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.032
It can also encourage more innovation.

32:07.312 --> 32:11.255
It reduces the capital requirements for new drug development.

32:12.176 --> 32:16.079
And finally, it's more humane and more ethical for animals.

32:17.011 --> 32:21.818
God did not make animals on planet Earth for us to abuse and torture.

32:22.779 --> 32:25.103
And so we have to respect animals.

32:25.323 --> 32:30.430
And this workshop is aimed at reducing animal testing in every way we can.

32:31.701 --> 32:58.532
That's a pretty remarkable statement because it seems to purport to indict, in a way, the abuse of animals throughout the system, as if everything that's done in the FDA in terms of toxicity and whatever is abuse of animals, that we might as well just do it in people, or we might as well just use AI to do it and then post-market monitor this stuff.

33:00.563 --> 33:07.712
which is the meeting that they're having today with some kind of pediatric group with a bunch of other people that are paid too much to read things.

33:09.673 --> 33:17.698
They are approving a bunch of pediatric medical devices and pediatric radiology, chemotherapy devices.

33:17.918 --> 33:31.147
It's remarkable because essentially, you know, if you think about it, they're finding all kinds of excuses to try all kinds of drugs on humans directly because there's cancer.

33:32.587 --> 33:35.589
And because they have these new things that they want to, it's,

33:37.185 --> 33:43.428
It's all been flipped around now and the FDA does nothing that it used to do 10 years ago, nothing at all.

33:44.828 --> 33:46.309
And I think that's all by design.

33:47.870 --> 34:05.338
I think it's always been the plan from the perspective of their story, you know, to say that they didn't mean to hurt anybody is that, you know, some people are way more vulnerable to vaccine damage than others, you know, because that thimerosal aluminum,

34:06.420 --> 34:08.261
you know, whatever it is that hurts people.

34:09.021 --> 34:14.303
It really only hurts the people with the MTFR gene or without the FTMR gene or something like that.

34:14.403 --> 34:18.904
It's just, there are so many myths that have been interwoven here.

34:19.584 --> 34:22.625
And the only way to get rid of it is to throw the whole blanket out.

34:22.705 --> 34:26.927
And the blanket is autism spectrum disorder is something real.

34:29.622 --> 34:34.104
Because that's not what CHD and ICANN were supposed to be fighting about.

34:34.144 --> 34:40.807
What they were supposed to be fighting about was that acute injury and death from intramuscular injection is real.

34:41.988 --> 34:50.154
But think about how remarkable it is that these people, in more than 15 years of fighting, people like Suzanne Humphreys, have never been able to say that.

34:50.214 --> 34:53.817
Even they got on Joe Rogan this year, and they couldn't just say that.

34:53.937 --> 34:57.079
That what we're fighting for is the truth to get out.

34:57.159 --> 35:03.424
That every year, thousands of kids are probably lifelong

35:04.244 --> 35:14.808
damaged as a result of intramuscular injection, and even a smaller percentage, although very significant, is killed by intramuscular injection, and we've often called it SIDS.

35:15.328 --> 35:31.014
It's just remarkable to me that these people have only gotten that far about the SIDS thing in 2025, that Pierre Kory went on Steve Kirsch's podcast about a month ago and claimed that he was blowing the lid off of this.

35:32.574 --> 35:43.122
Are you telling me that somebody like Suzanne Humphries in 2018 who said that she didn't think there was a safe vaccine because it wasn't possible, because it was antithetical to our biology.

35:43.602 --> 35:50.107
Are you saying that 2018 Suzanne Humphries would not have said that SIDS is vaccines?

35:50.508 --> 35:54.391
Are you trying to tell me that Tony Bark wouldn't say that SIDS is vaccines?

35:54.451 --> 35:55.772
I have at least one video.

35:56.943 --> 36:09.970
where she's on stage with Brian Hooker, and with Del Bigtree, and with Judy Mikovits, and they all talk before her, and when she comes up, she says that this is true.

36:12.472 --> 36:16.174
And then she died, and all these people got in front of her and never said it again.

36:16.354 --> 36:19.956
Even when Suzanne Humphries got on Joe Rogan, she didn't say it again.

36:20.953 --> 36:22.534
Because they are scripted traitors.

36:23.475 --> 36:25.015
Some of them have guns to their heads.

36:25.055 --> 36:27.017
Some of them have had their families threatened.

36:27.057 --> 36:28.557
Some of them have been bought off.

36:28.618 --> 36:31.079
And I don't care what the answer is.

36:31.159 --> 36:36.662
At some point in time, we have to have the principles to stand up for this.

36:37.843 --> 36:41.465
I don't think very many people have been coerced with a gun.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.206
I'm going to be very honest with you.

36:44.127 --> 36:46.268
Because coercion with a gun doesn't really work.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.496
It makes people extremely desperate.

36:51.596 --> 36:53.877
Once you leave their house, then what are they going to do?

36:53.937 --> 36:55.498
They're processing this whole thing.

36:56.098 --> 37:02.861
And they realize that, you know, that, that, that guy could come visit anytime he wants to, then that's no way to live.

37:03.001 --> 37:05.302
And you're going to create like a badger in a corner.

37:08.584 --> 37:13.926
And so I don't think very many of these people that are now in this show are actually, um,

37:16.013 --> 37:18.875
I do want to hear that, so I'm going to let this play.

37:18.895 --> 37:23.097
I don't think a lot of these people that are in the show have been coerced with violence.

37:23.297 --> 37:32.842
I think a lot of them have been coerced with promises of books, promises of comfort, promises of travel, extra money, and that gives freedom.

37:33.578 --> 37:50.042
You know, if you're a Brownstone fellow getting $4,000 a month, plus you get like, you know, $15,000 a month from your sub-stack, plus, I don't know, all travel expenses covered by the IMA because you're a fellow there too, and besides travel, they also give you $4,000.

37:50.463 --> 38:02.866
That seems to add up to about $25,000 a month that a lot of these people could easily be pulling down just for writing a sub-stack, or even worse, using a chatbot to write sub-stacks because that's what everybody told me I should do

38:03.366 --> 38:06.109
The last time I did a substack, they said, wow, this is shit.

38:06.129 --> 38:08.632
You could at least use a chatbot to clean it up a little bit.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.816
So I just assume that all these people are doing that all the time.

38:12.856 --> 38:19.002
It's one of the reasons why somebody like Jessica Hockett can just put out, you know, a substack a week or five.

38:19.683 --> 38:22.586
And Robert Malone can put out a substack a week or 12.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.497
These are all frauds, ladies and gentlemen.

38:27.517 --> 38:29.178
They're augmented frauds.

38:29.218 --> 38:32.340
They are social media phenomenon being used against us.

38:33.141 --> 38:43.489
And you're never going to figure it out if you keep using social media as if it's a level playing field where the programming is all randomly driven by some algorithm that nobody really knows how it works.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.391
Then you're never going to get free.

38:46.451 --> 38:48.213
More importantly, you're going to, you're going to,

38:48.933 --> 39:02.881
You're gonna hand over your children to that same manipulation and they're gonna grow up knowing nothing, caring about nothing, wanting to pursue nothing, and worst, they're not gonna wanna create anything.

39:12.787 --> 39:13.687
That's the reality.

39:16.969 --> 39:18.090
We gotta get our kids out.

39:19.881 --> 39:23.142
So I want to just say thank you to a lot of individuals.

39:23.222 --> 39:28.084
I want to thank Tracy Beth Hogue, who has done an amazing job.

39:28.684 --> 39:32.285
Tracy Beth Hogue was interacting with me in 2020 and then blocked me.

39:32.305 --> 39:36.446
Nicole Kleinstrue, where are both of you?

39:36.486 --> 39:36.946
Nicole.

39:37.206 --> 39:37.907
That's impressive.

39:38.027 --> 39:38.907
And Tracy Beth.

39:41.925 --> 39:43.186
She's on her way.

39:43.866 --> 40:00.993
Okay so Nicole has done an amazing job and even shuttling back and forth to the NIH and FDA and this she has been really a massive champion 15 years of work or so would you say Tracy that she has spent on this topic she's has an incredible career

40:02.492 --> 40:06.736
And many of her goals are transpiring now with our new roadmap.

40:06.816 --> 40:08.317
Now this is not going to happen overnight.

40:09.698 --> 40:10.759
There are many steps.

40:10.779 --> 40:11.400
What goals?

40:12.681 --> 40:14.863
Goals of getting the FDA out of the way.

40:16.764 --> 40:22.729
Goals of not having to do all kinds of expensive animal testing on nutraceuticals that we just want to sell.

40:25.892 --> 40:28.754
To people that we don't care and can go to hell.

40:28.834 --> 40:29.615
That's what they think.

40:29.675 --> 40:30.536
I didn't mean that to rhyme.

40:31.543 --> 40:38.228
to getting towards the ultimate goal, better computational modeling to predict toxicity of molecules.

40:39.649 --> 40:50.437
But we already have a computational modeling system produced by DITRA called DOMAIN, which Robert Malone spun a team up to use to identify a lot of these heroic

40:51.679 --> 41:02.915
repurposed drugs like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, silicoxib, and famotidine, which saved millions of lives despite the best efforts of the FDA and people like Janet Woodcock in 2020.

41:03.776 --> 41:05.519
Or at least that's the story I'm told.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.891
We're in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

41:11.951 --> 41:15.134
We have been led to the slaughter by these people.

41:15.835 --> 41:21.079
And we are being made to look like fools on the other side of the political equation.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.602
And you don't see it because your social media doesn't show it to you.

41:24.662 --> 41:29.687
Because it is carefully crafted to make sure you don't understand how bad we look.

41:30.307 --> 41:47.091
how far it is gone, how far it has gone with regard to Bobby Kennedy and Donald Trump burning all of our reputations as free-thinking individuals and really labeled us as people that can be manipulated and lied to and we don't understand or care.

41:47.651 --> 41:55.073
That's how the progressive left in America thinks about the conservative right in America.

41:55.213 --> 41:59.174
And we need to redefine what the conservative

42:00.825 --> 42:02.506
movement is in America.

42:02.527 --> 42:22.964
It needs to be a citizen-oriented grassroots for real, not this freaking AstroTurf shit where we go billboard to billboard, you know, county by county, and let people know that America is in trouble.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.201
America has been undermined and sold out.

42:26.782 --> 42:28.083
And it was a long time ago.

42:28.163 --> 42:32.605
That's the reason why all these old people will not retire and get off the screens.

42:33.026 --> 42:36.888
That's why all these old people will not retire and are now starting podcasts.

42:36.908 --> 42:44.953
That's why all these billionaires or rich people are also starting podcasts because the narrative is falling apart.

42:47.645 --> 42:49.807
And there are people that are looking for answers.

42:49.867 --> 42:52.450
And so there have to be a lot of bad answers out there.

42:52.550 --> 42:53.551
This is never going to work.

42:53.591 --> 43:03.360
A lot of attractive, bad answers, a lot of funny, bad answers, a lot of, of, you know, interesting, bad answers have to be out there in order to prevent the truth from getting out.

43:04.554 --> 43:11.198
which is that our sovereignty is being inverted to experimental animal status because that's the next iteration of the human genome project.

43:11.238 --> 43:20.204
Like it or not, this is a once in a multi-generational opportunity to collect this much genetic and medical data on the population of billions of people on earth.

43:21.718 --> 43:38.185
The population is about to collapse and over the next generation and a half, the dynamics of the world are going to change and healthy population pyramids are going to remain and unhealthy population pyramids are going to go through a lot of struggle economically and societally.

43:39.646 --> 43:42.887
And we can probably watch Japan to see what's happening.

43:42.927 --> 43:46.409
We can probably watch China to get an idea of what's happening.

43:46.449 --> 43:48.850
The unfortunate thing is I do think people are right.

43:49.530 --> 43:50.951
The people that are trying to

43:52.455 --> 44:02.242
take advantage of this known rise in all-cause mortality to change the way we think and to pass this mythology on to our children.

44:02.282 --> 44:16.191
They are also very happy to accelerate it for us and to exacerbate it for us so that the suffering comes earlier but spread over a longer time so that maybe it's kind of, you know, in a similar way boiling the frog.

44:20.353 --> 44:23.818
Organ-on-a-chip technology and organoid testing.

44:24.479 --> 44:34.051
Organ-on-a-chip technology, organoid testing, this is all essentially development-oriented genetics in disguise.

44:35.533 --> 44:45.576
inevitably in order to create an organoid on a dish or to, you know, grow a extracted organ that you get out of an animal in a dish.

44:46.416 --> 44:50.637
They're talking about doing things that still require animals a lot of times.

44:50.677 --> 44:56.039
So it's a little strange to me that all you're really talking about is not using live

44:56.619 --> 44:58.160
whole animals anymore.

44:58.561 --> 45:03.765
You know, like they make a big deal about this sewing skin on the back of a mouse or something like that.

45:04.186 --> 45:14.175
But then all they would do is say, well, we'll take that fetal skin and we'll grow it on mouse skin that we're culturing using Ralph Baric's epithelial culture methods.

45:15.015 --> 45:23.984
And so they say that they're not going to use animals, but what they're going to do is just, they're going to take the live animal out of the experiment, but they're still going to use animal material.

45:24.024 --> 45:30.290
They're still going to clone and culture things that will require the butchering of animals in order to culture them.

45:31.107 --> 45:45.583
And so it's still a very disingenuous representation of what's going on, except in the sense of they are admitting that the pivot is going to be to this machine learning algorithm, artificial life,

45:47.004 --> 46:06.831
development oriented investigations to optimize these, you know, you're going to put in billions of dollars to optimize these experimental models of things that preserve animals, but really, you're just optimizing how we can do life in a dish to investigate smaller systems and, and make that ethically acceptable.

46:08.413 --> 46:14.757
make it okay to genetically modify those things and to fool around in that dish because, you know, it's just genes in there and stuff.

46:15.198 --> 46:20.181
And so that's all, it's part of the slippery slope and you can hear it happening right now.

46:21.382 --> 46:23.824
All of these are important topics that'll be discussed today.

46:25.800 --> 46:30.003
I want to thank Jacqueline Corrigan-Curry, who's right here in the front row, and you'll be hearing from her.

46:30.964 --> 46:35.227
Hala Saber, who's with our oncology section.

46:35.307 --> 46:36.108
Good to see you, Hala.

46:36.468 --> 46:39.731
And so I'll just let this play, and then I'll turn the volume down.

46:39.791 --> 46:43.033
So I'm going to show you another video that this was from earlier today.

46:43.213 --> 46:47.977
And I want you to just hear, in their language, I want you to listen for a couple of things.

46:48.237 --> 46:49.118
One, they're reading.

46:50.719 --> 46:54.421
Two, the lady who reads the most stuff about

46:55.660 --> 47:01.023
legality is about the conflicts of interest and how they are covered and what laws they are covered under.

47:01.063 --> 47:13.649
So understand, like the ACIP, a lot of these meetings, these committees are actually part of the legislation and the outcome of these committees is essentially law in living law making.

47:13.729 --> 47:19.972
It's like, you know, the committee decides this, but because the committee is part of the law, it essentially makes the committee's decision part

47:20.752 --> 47:22.033
of the law now.

47:22.674 --> 47:29.920
And so what you're listening to here is the FDA explaining that in a lot of terms read by an Indian lady.

47:31.901 --> 47:34.183
And sharing your expertise with the PAC committee.

47:34.483 --> 47:41.149
I'm now going to pass the meeting on to Shivana Srivastava to announce the FDA representatives who are joining us for today's meeting.

47:41.929 --> 47:42.650
Next slide, please.

47:48.507 --> 47:53.751
Hello, my name is Shabana Shabastava and I'm the designated federal officer for today's meeting.

47:54.292 --> 47:56.073
In today's meeting, FDA speaks.

47:56.133 --> 48:06.782
She's the designated federal officer for today's meeting and her job is to read this script, but I bet even dollars to donuts she had no role in processing it.

48:08.319 --> 48:18.886
speakers will be Dr. Deanna Green from the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics, Mr. Scott Colburn from CDRH, Dr. Craig Zinderman from CBER, and Dr. Yvonne Kim from CDER.

48:19.566 --> 48:22.608
They will briefly introduce themselves when they address the committee.

48:23.289 --> 48:28.673
Additional FDA participants and representatives will introduce themselves when speaking throughout the meeting.

48:29.473 --> 48:31.454
I will now read the conflict of interest statement.

48:31.715 --> 48:32.155
Next slide.

48:34.608 --> 48:40.633
I mean, imagine that we are in 2025 and we still have shitheads on Zoom saying, next slide.

48:41.613 --> 48:42.334
Think about that.

48:45.643 --> 49:04.419
The Food and Drug Administration is convening today, July 9, 2025, for a meeting of the Pediatric Advisory Committee under the authority of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2002, the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007,

49:07.318 --> 49:13.683
the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 and Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972.

49:14.564 --> 49:16.206
That's a lot of laws.

49:17.987 --> 49:24.353
That's a lot of laws she's citing that we don't have any idea what they do or what they allow or what they mean or what changes they made.

49:24.393 --> 49:29.517
You see why it's so important we have a lawyer or two or three that care about anything?

49:29.977 --> 49:34.301
Barry Holland doesn't know what those things do, what they, what they're contained within.

49:34.401 --> 49:35.182
Think about that.

49:36.263 --> 49:38.604
And think about her reading this shit.

49:40.465 --> 49:52.971
This meeting is a particular matter involving specific parties, products, devices, and biologics for which the community can, for which the committee will discuss post-marketing safety events reported for these products.

49:54.753 --> 50:05.999
With the exception of the industry representative, all standing members of the committee are special government employees from other agencies and are subject to federal conflict of interest laws and regulations.

50:07.180 --> 50:17.905
The following information on the status of this committee's compliance with federal ethics and conflict of interest laws covered by, but not limited to, those found at 18 U.S.C.

50:18.325 --> 50:22.848
Section 208 is being provided to participants at this meeting and to the public.

50:24.201 --> 50:42.742
Related to the discussions of today's meeting, standing members and temporary voting members of the committee have been screened for potential financial conflicts of interest of their own, as well as those imputed to them, including those of their spouses or minor children and for the purposes of 18 U.S.C.

50:42.842 --> 50:44.484
Section 208, their employers.

50:45.405 --> 50:51.831
These interests may include investments, consulting, expert witness testimony, contracts, grants.

50:52.012 --> 50:56.776
Is this reading something that's supposed to make all the conflicts of interest okay?

50:56.836 --> 50:59.359
Is it supposed to be the radical transparency?

50:59.419 --> 50:59.619
I mean...

51:03.084 --> 51:05.285
I'll let our Indian friend continue.

51:05.625 --> 51:11.126
Kratos, teaching, speaking, writing, patents, and royalties, and primary employment.

51:11.766 --> 51:14.847
This may include interests that are current or under negotiation.

51:15.547 --> 51:18.808
No regular government employees were added to the committee for this meeting.

51:19.328 --> 51:24.669
Therefore, the conflicts of interest screening was limited to standing members and temporary voting members of the PAC.

51:25.870 --> 51:30.651
FDA has determined that the members of this committee are in compliance with federal ethics and conflict of interest laws.

51:31.761 --> 51:33.002
Under 18 U.S.C.

51:33.082 --> 51:51.098
Section 208, Congress has authorized FDA to grant waivers to special government employees and regular government employees who have potential financial conflicts when it is determined that the agency's need for a particular individual's services outweighs his or her potential financial conflict of interest.

51:52.066 --> 52:01.551
or when the interest of a regular government employee is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the government may expect from the employee.

52:02.631 --> 52:10.696
Based on the agenda for today's session and all financial interests reported by the committee members, no conflict of interest waivers have been issued for this meeting.

52:11.653 --> 52:15.918
With respect to the meeting's consumer representative, we would like to disclose that Ms.

52:15.958 --> 52:24.609
Randy Oster is participating as a voting representative, acting on behalf of consumers, not on behalf of any organization, company, or product.

52:25.714 --> 52:31.539
With respect to the meeting's patient representative, we would like to disclose that Dr. Gianna McMillan is participating.

52:31.679 --> 52:35.101
I can guarantee you she's getting a six-figure salary for this job.

52:35.702 --> 52:42.347
You know, what are they paying Vinay Prasad to read his scripts and talk about all the cancer stuff that he knows with?

52:42.367 --> 52:47.331
I mean, what are they paying these people to run our FDA into the ground?

52:48.112 --> 52:49.453
Very well is what they're doing.

52:50.046 --> 52:57.249
participating as a voting representative, acting on behalf of patients, not on behalf of any organization, company, or product.

52:58.110 --> 53:04.253
The consumer and patient representatives are special government employees and as such have been screened for conflicts of interest.

53:05.313 --> 53:15.038
With respect to the meeting, Dr. Jennifer Goldman is participating in this meeting as the Pediatric Health Organization representative, and that is a non-voting position.

53:16.912 --> 53:28.759
With respect to FDA's invited industry representative, we would like to disclose that Dr. Robert Nelson is participating in this meeting as a non-voting representative acting on behalf of regulated industry.

53:29.540 --> 53:35.344
This representative is not a regular or special government employee and has not been screened for conflicts of interest.

53:36.044 --> 53:40.527
Dr. Nelson's role at this meeting is to represent industry in general and not any company.

53:41.247 --> 53:45.089
Dr. Nelson is employed by a firm that has a product that is coming before the committee.

53:45.729 --> 54:00.478
In accordance with our regulations at 21 CFR 14.86C4, Dr. Nelson has been reminded that an industry representative may be present at a meeting even if a product sponsored by his employer or its subsidiary is coming before the committee.

54:01.198 --> 54:08.384
However, his role as an industry representative is to represent all of industry and not... I hope my point is landing here, right?

54:08.444 --> 54:20.214
There is no explanation for this long conflict of interest statement about each of these people and in general, except for this is their illusion of radical transparency.

54:20.274 --> 54:25.779
This is the same stupid shit, different day, same channel.

54:25.879 --> 54:26.760
You know, this is awful.

54:29.602 --> 54:37.546
And it should not be dismissed that this is yet another foreign person with a particular ethnic bent.

54:39.547 --> 54:40.807
And also at the FDA.

54:42.328 --> 54:48.791
I mean, I'm very bewildered by this right now.

54:49.291 --> 54:54.374
This pattern is bothering me a lot as an American who has been trying to

54:55.723 --> 55:09.195
do what I think is my patriotic duty for six years now, to see this just Trojan horse style undermining of HHS from the top to the bottom.

55:09.668 --> 55:15.772
any specific firm or product consistent with Kish commissioner McCary's April 17th, 2025 statement.

55:16.372 --> 55:25.257
FDA is only including industry representatives in advisory committee meetings where required by statue FDA is required to include, include an industry.

55:25.277 --> 55:26.718
Required by statue.

55:26.738 --> 55:30.660
Do you see she is reading stuff?

55:30.680 --> 55:34.643
She did not even write, does not understand.

55:36.061 --> 55:41.723
And this is not the way our government should be running after 249 years of existence.

55:41.783 --> 55:49.065
This is not the way the FDA should be running after, you know, 40 years since Estes Kefauver.

55:50.225 --> 55:50.446
Wait.

55:51.286 --> 55:52.106
Oh, sorry.

55:52.126 --> 55:54.727
60 years after Estes Kefauver.

55:54.947 --> 55:55.327
Come on.

55:56.167 --> 55:56.527
Come on.

55:56.587 --> 55:57.348
This is a show.

55:57.408 --> 55:58.348
This is ridiculous.

55:58.528 --> 56:01.069
True representative in today's meeting under 21 USC, 355 and 3C.

56:05.245 --> 56:25.233
Under FDA regulations, although a non-voting member serves in a representative capacity, the non-voting member shall exercise restraint in performing such functions and may not engage in unseemly advocacy or attempt to exert undue influence over the other members of the committee.

56:26.343 --> 56:42.074
FDA encourages all meeting participants, including the industry representative and open public hearing speakers, to advise the committee of any financial relationships that they have with any affected firms, its products, and if known, its direct competitors.

56:42.474 --> 56:53.362
I mean, have we heard any figures about how many members of the FDA took the early retirement, for example, that the super clown Elon Musk, absolute super fraud, offered everybody?

56:54.264 --> 57:07.827
Because I think that's one of the things that on our side of the show, where everybody's cheering for Donald Trump and hoping that Peter McCullough gets an appointment eventually, these people are all bamboozled to the point where they can't see this.

57:10.885 --> 57:31.138
They can't see this abject failure that the Donald Trump administration is with regard to Gaza, and Israel, and Iran, and tariffs, and insider trading on the tariffs, and the rumors of tariffs, and the negotiation of tariffs, and this whole, you know, Epstein has a file, doesn't have a file.

57:31.178 --> 57:33.860
This is all scripted bullshit.

57:36.982 --> 57:38.443
While the FDA is destroyed.

57:39.215 --> 57:42.797
While the CDC moves forward under an ARPA-H director.

57:44.278 --> 57:48.500
While the FDA shifts to AI for all of it.

57:49.220 --> 57:51.061
You know, to replace the people that are gone.

57:51.121 --> 57:53.102
To make the people that are left more efficient.

57:57.525 --> 58:04.949
So that forms can be filled out and blanks can be filled out without a lot of research and scrutiny, but just let an AI put in the right references.

58:05.189 --> 58:07.050
That's what they are actually doing.

58:10.779 --> 58:27.789
We would like to remind the members that if the discussions involve any products or firm not already on the agenda for which an FDA participant has a personal or imputed financial interest, the participant needs to inform the DFO and exclude themselves from the discussion, and their exclusion will be noted for the record.

58:28.769 --> 58:37.816
To ensure transparency, we encourage all standing committee members and temporary voting members to disclose any public statements that they have made concerning the product at issue.

58:38.617 --> 58:55.050
We would like to remind members that if the discussions involve any other firms or products not already on the agenda for which a PAC member has a personal or imputed financial interest, the participant will need to exclude themselves from such discussion and their exclusion will be noted for the record.

58:56.781 --> 59:06.149
FDA encourages all other participants to advise the committee of any financial relationships that they may have regarding the topics that could be affected by the committee's discussions.

59:06.730 --> 59:07.170
Thank you.

59:07.390 --> 59:09.492
I will now turn the meeting back to our chair.

59:09.913 --> 59:10.393
Next slide.

59:10.953 --> 59:20.462
Did you have any concept of what she told you and why she had to tell you all that other than CYA covering their ass?

59:25.615 --> 59:32.136
All right, we will now proceed with opening remarks from Dr. Deanna Green, Director of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics.

59:34.677 --> 59:35.657
Thank you, Dr. Fisher.

59:36.277 --> 59:37.237
Good morning, everyone.

59:37.958 --> 59:42.158
I would like to welcome our committee members and guests who are joining us for today.

59:42.178 --> 59:47.680
OK, so this is the director, an MD, and I don't know, FCP is.

59:47.700 --> 59:52.721
Is that like a pharmacist or something maybe?

59:56.557 --> 01:00:00.824
opening remarks from our Director of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics.

01:00:00.985 --> 01:00:01.325
Wow.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:03.729
Okay, so let's decide.

01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:04.510
Is she reading?

01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:06.013
Is she an expert?

01:00:06.213 --> 01:00:07.155
What is this person?

01:00:07.554 --> 01:00:09.836
today's Pediatric Advisory Committee meeting.

01:00:10.637 --> 01:00:19.826
I want to start by first thanking our committee members for their service and for the time you have taken to review the advanced materials and to prepare for today's meeting.

01:00:20.627 --> 01:00:22.509
I would also like to thank the following groups.

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:31.318
The FDA staff who performed or contributed to the pediatric-focused post-market safety reviews that are the subject of today's meeting.

01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:39.391
I would also like to thank the FDA staff members who are participating today and all who have contributed to the logistics and planning for the meeting.

01:00:40.352 --> 01:00:43.936
We also want to thank the AV staff for all of their technical support today.

01:00:43.956 --> 01:00:49.240
And last but not least, we want to thank the public for joining us today for our meeting.

01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:50.622
Next slide, please.

01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:59.920
many members for their service and for the time you have taken to review the advanced materials and to prepare for today's meeting.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:10.107
I would also like to thank the following groups, the FDA staff who performed or contributed to the pediatric focused post-market safety reviews that are.

01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:15.311
Pediatric post-market safety reviews.

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:21.276
They are talking about pediatric products which have been accelerated to market.

01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:25.216
and monitored after they have been sent out.

01:01:25.356 --> 01:01:36.499
Essentially, they're talking about what Vinay and Marty talked about a few weeks ago with regard to, you know, these kids are an opportunity to test things.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:44.242
And at the same time, they're making the ethical argument that that's okay to test them on these kids because, you know, they're in the shit anyway.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.562
And so this meeting is about an incredible thing.

01:01:51.162 --> 01:01:54.443
And she's about to explain to you exactly what the meeting is about.

01:01:55.143 --> 01:02:06.888
And if you are in a unstable chair or driving your car, please make sure that you maintain some attention to what you're doing so that you don't crash or fall out of your chair.

01:02:07.608 --> 01:02:11.449
It might take a few, but I assure you this is worth it.

01:02:11.709 --> 01:02:13.090
They're the subject of today's meeting.

01:02:14.434 --> 01:02:21.203
I would also like to thank the FDA staff members who are participating today and all who have contributed to the logistics and planning for the meeting.

01:02:22.164 --> 01:02:25.748
We also want to thank the AV staff for all of their technical support today.

01:02:25.768 --> 01:02:31.055
And last but not least, we want to thank the public for joining us today for our meeting.

01:02:31.696 --> 01:02:32.457
Next slide, please.

01:02:35.225 --> 01:02:53.035
At today's meeting, the Pediatric Advisory Committee is convened to discuss pediatric focused post-market safety reviews as mandated by the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, and the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act.

01:02:53.515 --> 01:03:04.301
So what we're doing here, you know, they can call it discuss, but what we're doing here is a legislated process, which will have effect on the

01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:10.788
Enforcement and sort of expression of the legislation going forward.

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:17.934
I don't know if those are right terms or not because I'm not a lawyer but But what they're what you know, these recommendations are not nothing.

01:03:18.014 --> 01:03:20.636
They are something that's the same thing with the ACIP.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:25.200
That's the reason why They had to use parliamentary procedure all the time.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.402
I second the motion all in favor yada yada.

01:03:27.422 --> 01:03:27.442
I

01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:36.601
And so we're still listening to where all these, you know, what about, what are the lawyers at CHD know about these acts?

01:03:40.707 --> 01:03:43.911
We are just not, we have been led to the slaughter, my friends.

01:03:44.572 --> 01:03:45.113
Next slide.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:58.707
Before we proceed with the focus of today's meeting, I will first provide an update on the Pediatric Research Equity Act noncompliance letters as required by legislation.

01:03:59.087 --> 01:04:04.033
Pediatric Research Equity Act noncompliance letters.

01:04:04.113 --> 01:04:05.955
So these are people

01:04:06.696 --> 01:04:18.226
who have tried to take advantage of a law that allows them to rush things to market, but then have not been in compliance with reporting the post-marketing frickin' results.

01:04:19.187 --> 01:04:20.408
How many of them are there?

01:04:20.828 --> 01:04:25.132
And how complicated can you say that you've not really effectively regulated anything?

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:27.073
We gotta send a letter to scold these people.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.875
Hey, you're supposed to send in some shit.

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:30.917
Can you imagine this?

01:04:32.705 --> 01:04:46.862
FDA issues PREA noncompliance letters to sponsors if they have failed to submit, within the time frame, a required pediatric assessment or report of a molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation as appropriate.

01:04:48.081 --> 01:04:54.443
FDA has also issued- I think it's important for us to know what molecularly targeted is, but I don't know it right now.

01:04:54.523 --> 01:05:06.147
But I think you can assure yourself that that is some kind of loaded term that has legal implications for what fits into this legislative structure.

01:05:06.587 --> 01:05:17.351
Such a letter, if a sponsor failed to request approval for a pediatric formulation as described in section 505B of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:29.582
Consistent with the Act, FDA has also made publicly available on the FDA website the PREA noncompliance letter and sponsors' response with certain redactions.

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:51.644
If a sponsor has requested a deferral extension or submitted a waiver request by the due date of the pediatric assessment or the report of the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, FDA has not issued a PREA noncompliance letter unless FDA subsequently denied the deferral extension or waiver request.

01:05:52.725 --> 01:05:53.205
Next slide.

01:05:56.132 --> 01:06:09.703
So since the last reporting on the noncompliance letters at the September 2024 Pediatric Advisory Committee meeting, there has been one new letter issued by CBER, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

01:06:11.144 --> 01:06:11.625
Next slide.

01:06:11.925 --> 01:06:14.547
They didn't read which, which thing.

01:06:15.088 --> 01:06:17.410
So this is fricking unbelievable.

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:19.873
I'm telling you this happened this morning and I didn't watch it.

01:06:19.913 --> 01:06:22.075
I just recorded it and came back after coffee.

01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:25.898
Look, respiratory syncytial virus vaccine.

01:06:26.994 --> 01:06:29.876
has not reported its post-marketing results.

01:06:30.497 --> 01:06:43.787
And yet that vaccine was part of the recommendation of ACIP when they said that if a mom doesn't get this, then we should probably give the kid monoclonal antibodies afterward and one of these three should be recommended.

01:06:44.207 --> 01:06:45.448
And they approved that too.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:51.133
Retsit Levy said some kind of, you know, he has some skepticism as a papa.

01:06:52.096 --> 01:06:53.777
but then in the end they approved it anyway.

01:06:53.857 --> 01:07:08.341
This is absolutely freaking extraordinary if you see that her script actually does not contain her saying what pediatric product is currently out of compliance.

01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:09.681
Stop lying!

01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.243
I have no responsibility.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:25.791
And there have been 15 new letters issued by Cedar, the center for drug evaluation and research.

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:30.912
The information related to these letters are listed on the previous slide.

01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:46.176
Look at they have implants, implants, and injection emulsion.

01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:49.452
I mean, come on, guys.

01:07:49.952 --> 01:07:50.772
Come on, guys.

01:07:51.332 --> 01:07:56.855
This slide and the following slide and can also be found on FDA's website.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:07:58.635
Next slide.

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:02.357
Next slide.

01:08:06.007 --> 01:08:10.551
So now in terms of the agenda for today's meeting, the meeting will proceed as follows.

01:08:11.252 --> 01:08:13.393
We will first have an open public hearing.

01:08:13.414 --> 01:08:14.514
Here it comes, here it comes.

01:08:14.555 --> 01:08:15.756
Beginning at 10.30 a.m.

01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:16.316
Eastern.

01:08:16.376 --> 01:08:18.378
You're not going to believe it.

01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:18.698
At 11.30 a.m.

01:08:18.738 --> 01:08:30.368
there will be a listing and discussion of the products evaluated in the pediatric-focused post-market safety reviews completed by CDRH, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

01:08:31.289 --> 01:08:36.212
This will be followed by a listing and discussion of the products evaluated by CBER.

01:08:37.172 --> 01:08:43.656
There will be a lunch break that is scheduled for approximately 1 p.m., and the meeting will resume at 1.30 p.m.

01:08:43.936 --> 01:08:51.840
for a listing and discussion of the products evaluated and the pediatric-focused postmarket safety reviews completed by CDER.

01:08:52.801 --> 01:08:58.924
There is time allotted for clarifying questions and voting at specified times during the meeting.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:03.699
We are scheduled to adjourn the meeting at approximately 3.30 PM.

01:09:04.419 --> 01:09:13.486
However, please note that depending on the pace of the meeting and how it proceeds, it is possible that all of these times may shift next slide.

01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:24.289
During today's meeting, there will be three separate voting sessions, one each for CDRH, CBER, and CDER.

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:32.277
The voting question and response choices will be the same for all centers and all products that are discussed today.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:37.872
Voting by the Pediatric Advisory Committee will occur via the Zoom platform.

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:47.896
A separate ballot will be launched for each center's vote and will contain a series of the same voting question, one for each of the products listed on the ballots.

01:09:49.056 --> 01:10:01.221
Please note that for certain CEDAW products, they were grouped into the same pediatric-focused post-market safety review, and therefore, those products will be grouped for voting purposes as well.

01:10:02.022 --> 01:10:02.482
Next slide.

01:10:05.842 --> 01:10:16.853
As was previously mentioned, FDA's review of adverse event reports for the products under discussion today did not identify any new pediatric safety concerns.

01:10:17.573 --> 01:10:21.918
Therefore, the voting question for each product is as follows.

01:10:23.103 --> 01:10:33.150
The FDA recommends continuing routine ongoing post-market safety monitoring of each of the CDER, CDRH, or CBER products under discussion.

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:36.452
Does the Pediatric Advisory Committee concur?

01:10:37.712 --> 01:10:50.701
Voting members of the Pediatric Advisory Committee can vote yes, routine ongoing post-market monitoring should continue, or vote no, additional evaluation or surveillance should be considered,

01:10:51.837 --> 01:11:00.640
Voting members can also choose to abstain from voting and some voting members will be recused from voting on certain products due to conflicts of interest.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.941
So understand what she just said.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:18.167
The vote is going to be whether they should continue to post safety monitor stuff or whether maybe we should consider adding a little more surveillance while we're still post marketing safety monitoring it.

01:11:20.638 --> 01:11:24.360
Not pull it from the market, not, you know, think it over.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.781
These are already out.

01:11:26.121 --> 01:11:28.202
It's just a question of, you know, is it awesome?

01:11:29.323 --> 01:11:32.045
Or, or, you know, should we, should we think?

01:11:34.266 --> 01:11:35.266
It's all pro forma.

01:11:36.227 --> 01:11:37.368
It's all pro forma.

01:11:37.488 --> 01:11:39.409
And, and this lady is pro forma.

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:46.485
She has no real role in the FDA, just like the last lady who was reading doesn't have any role in the FDA.

01:11:46.965 --> 01:11:50.608
They're all scripted traders, witting and unwitting.

01:11:50.768 --> 01:11:52.870
And I think she's an unwitting participant.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.292
I think the last lady was an unwitting participant.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:12:02.519
They are just barely smart enough to read what they're told and to show up looking professional on time.

01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:07.243
Next slide.

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:18.032
Meeting attendees trying to join the meeting during the time of voting or vote tabulation will be placed in a waiting room until the meeting resumes.

01:12:18.832 --> 01:12:33.165
Once the meeting resumes, the voting results will be displayed and read into the record by the designated federal officer, following which each voting member of the Pediatric Advisory Committee will be called upon to state their individual vote for the record.

01:12:34.285 --> 01:12:34.766
Next slide.

01:12:37.247 --> 01:12:41.732
Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn the meeting back to our chairperson, Dr. Fisher.

01:12:44.836 --> 01:12:47.139
Thank you, Dr. Green, for your presentation.

01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:49.262
We can go to the next slide.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:55.612
Okay, we are going to open the public hearing session now.

01:12:55.892 --> 01:12:57.693
Welcome to the open public hearing.

01:12:58.653 --> 01:13:03.155
If you wish to speak, please state your name and your affiliation if it's relevant to this meeting.

01:13:04.116 --> 01:13:15.961
The Food and Drug Administration believes that the agency and the public benefit from a transparent process that helps ensure the FDA decisions are well informed by the advice and information FDA receives from its advisory

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:16.942
I'm sorry, you missed it.

01:13:16.962 --> 01:13:21.449
There were two presentations, one from an Indian lady and one from an African American lady.

01:13:21.509 --> 01:13:22.851
You missed those presentations.

01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:23.492
They were great.

01:13:23.652 --> 01:13:24.253
They were awesome.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:25.434
Next slide.

01:13:25.795 --> 01:13:32.004
Committees to ensure such transparency at the open public hearing session of the advisory committee meeting.

01:13:32.384 --> 01:13:37.167
FDA believes that it is important to understand the context of an individual's presentation.

01:13:38.087 --> 01:13:53.597
For this reason, the FDA encourages you, the open public hearing speaker, at the beginning of your written or oral statement to advise the committee of any financial relationship that you may have with the sponsor, with its product, or, if known, any of its direct competitors.

01:13:54.477 --> 01:14:07.783
For example, this financial information may include a company's or group's payment for your travel, lodging, or other expenses in connection with your attendance at this meeting, or grant money that your organization receives from the sponsor or competitor.

01:14:08.863 --> 01:14:17.867
Likewise, the FDA encourages you at the beginning of your statement to advise the committee if you do not have any such financial relationships to which you may state for the record.

01:14:19.045 --> 01:14:25.726
If you choose not to address this issue of financial relationships at the beginning of your statement, it will not preclude you from speaking.

01:14:27.447 --> 01:14:31.828
The FDA and this committee place great importance in the open public hearing process.

01:14:32.688 --> 01:14:38.529
The insights and comments provided can help the agency and this committee in their consideration of the issues before them.

01:14:39.549 --> 01:14:44.250
That said, in many instances and for many topics, there will be a variety of opinions.

01:14:44.986 --> 01:14:55.373
One of our goals for today is for this open public hearing to be conducted in a fair and open way where every participant is listened to carefully and treated with dignity, courtesy, and respect.

01:14:56.254 --> 01:14:59.636
Therefore, please speak only when recognized by the chairperson.

01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:01.898
Thank you for your cooperation.

01:15:05.353 --> 01:15:09.355
We do not have any pre-registered speakers, I believe.

01:15:09.616 --> 01:15:17.360
So if at this time, any member of the public wishes to speak, please raise your hand.

01:15:30.788 --> 01:15:32.129
Pro forma, my friends.

01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:33.250
Pro forma.

01:15:34.699 --> 01:15:56.237
So please keep in mind that no one on our side is ever going to explain to you that this was just an irreducibly complex background that was made to seem like spread using non-specific PCR tests that the FDA did not regulate, still doesn't regulate, and now we've come to accept as gold standard in diagnostics.

01:15:56.357 --> 01:16:01.000
You know, you heard Mary Talley Bowden say it in my stream.

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:07.406
in 2022 that she was testing for 17 different viruses with one test in her office.

01:16:09.067 --> 01:16:10.809
That's why she's on Joe Rogan.

01:16:10.849 --> 01:16:20.959
That's why she's on the podcast with Nicole Shanahan, because she's never going to question the specificity of these PCR tests or the fidelity of virology.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.800
She accepts it.

01:16:22.381 --> 01:16:23.122
Something strange.

01:16:25.313 --> 01:16:29.575
None of these people are ever going to question the PCR test.

01:16:29.595 --> 01:16:33.978
A lot of them were put in place specifically to make sure that people would ask any other question.

01:16:36.209 --> 01:16:43.233
And they're also not going to tell you that they didn't risk transfecting everyone and that placebo made it safe.

01:16:43.293 --> 01:16:48.835
Instead, they're going to tell you stories about batches and freezers and, you know, whatever.

01:16:49.556 --> 01:16:50.656
And this is all bullshit.

01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:54.778
And now we've gotten to the stage where there's contamination and that explains everything.

01:16:54.979 --> 01:16:58.440
Or it's the overexpression of the spike that explains everything.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.221
In reality,

01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:01.482
All of these risks were known.

01:17:01.682 --> 01:17:03.864
All of these potential downsides were known.

01:17:04.324 --> 01:17:09.647
And probably a list of many others that hasn't widely circulated is probably already known.

01:17:11.609 --> 01:17:13.930
They didn't risk transfecting everyone.

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:15.511
Placebo made it safe.

01:17:15.571 --> 01:17:19.234
And that's why none of these people will tell you that and explain it to you.

01:17:19.754 --> 01:17:25.338
They will only try to make you believe that everybody had good intentions but they screwed up or something like that.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:40.269
The other thing that these people won't tell you is that there was a known anticipated rise in all-cause mortality to which this theater was timed.

01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:47.352
In other words, they had an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that they saw coming since I graduated from high school.

01:17:48.191 --> 01:18:10.222
And they have been putting this narrative about coronavirus and endemicity as a process and an endpoint into place using people like Ralph Baric and others, even people like Peter Daszak and 60 Minutes and EcoHealth Alliance, so that perfectly timed with this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, they would have an excuse for manslaughter.

01:18:11.058 --> 01:18:17.843
And so an anticipated rise in all cause mortality was sculpted using manslaughter and lies on social media.

01:18:18.523 --> 01:18:24.127
And it is specifically the orchestration on social media of this narrative that allowed it to happen.

01:18:24.188 --> 01:18:29.672
And all of these people are present on and making their living on that social media today.

01:18:29.752 --> 01:18:30.932
That's how you can see them.

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.914
They all won't tell you about this signal.

01:18:34.963 --> 01:18:41.085
And they all won't ever build a list to explain what the virus did and what the murder did.

01:18:41.145 --> 01:18:52.670
You know, they can say things like there was a lot of iatrogenic, you know, whatever, but that doesn't really get at the fact that they murdered people under the pretense that viral pneumonia was real.

01:18:52.730 --> 01:19:00.713
Viral pneumonia that didn't exist until 2020 and then stopped existing in 2022, according to what I can see here in this figure.

01:19:02.475 --> 01:19:05.338
And these numbers suggest that there was no viral pneumonia.

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:19.174
These numbers suggest that everybody that believes in viral pneumonia is an idiot and has been bamboozled by people like Daniel Griffin and Vincent Racaniello and Paul Offit and Tony Fauci and Ralph Baric.

01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:30.659
and Peter Daszak and 60 Minutes because they all agree that these things exist and that these biological phenomenon are very easily measurable.

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:41.105
And that's why none of these people will ever tell you that supplementary oxygen is toxic or that not using antibiotics to treat something that is based in bacteria would be disastrous.

01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:45.548
And none of those people will tell you that the opioid deaths took a few people out.

01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:50.820
because then the math doesn't work anymore because all the white things are true too.

01:19:54.853 --> 01:19:58.795
Sophisticated liars is what we have on the internet.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:09.781
And these sophisticated liars were put in place to make sure that any and all damage from transfection could be effectively blamed on the process or the assumption or the virus.

01:20:10.362 --> 01:20:19.947
The toxic spike protein with the fear and cleavage sites and the staphylococcal enterotoxin B homologies and the HIV inserts.

01:20:22.961 --> 01:20:25.703
many of those things we learned through Indian people.

01:20:27.685 --> 01:20:35.170
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like J.J.

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:50.402
Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people as sort of this kind of savant or idiot or something that his ideas are just... He's one of the worst people on the internet because he's a total fraud.

01:20:51.437 --> 01:21:09.405
And the reason all you can know he's a total fraud is because he's cooperated with Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal and the rest of Panda to obscure the fact that I gave three presentations to Panda in 2022, the same year that he went on a cruise off the coast of Turkey with Robert Malone and his wife for a week.

01:21:10.802 --> 01:21:24.196
And all of those presentations have been lost and instead scoured through and sifted through for any little piecemeal ideas that they can use and represent as their own foresight or insight into the pandemic.

01:21:24.216 --> 01:21:29.382
When in reality, these people are on the exact same script that all of them are on.

01:21:29.422 --> 01:21:30.764
It's Robert Malone's script.

01:21:31.504 --> 01:21:32.926
It's Kevin McKernan's script.

01:21:36.826 --> 01:21:40.967
So that's why this- 2.5 years after mRNA vaccination.

01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:43.028
So we have some of these coming out.

01:21:43.048 --> 01:21:46.169
We have some excess mortality papers coming out.

01:21:46.209 --> 01:21:51.231
We identified large increases in deaths after vaccination.

01:21:51.271 --> 01:22:03.515
So a lot of the pipeline at the McCullough Foundation here- There's no way to describe how awful it is that the McCullough Foundation has Kermit the Frog working this spike protein story after six years.

01:22:04.455 --> 01:22:20.540
After I have been fighting this spike protein story since I decided that Kevin McCairn and Jessica Rose and this guy Walter Chestnut and all these other people that were focused on the spike protein, even people like Richard Fleming,

01:22:21.618 --> 01:22:24.820
These are all clowns, all on the same shitty script.

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:36.388
And it's like a hamster wheel because every couple years they introduce a new person and an old person together with the same story about a spike protein and cancer and cardiac problems, etc, etc, etc.

01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:45.526
This is so malevolent and it's so gross and the only reason why it's effective for anybody is because we use social media.

01:22:46.007 --> 01:22:54.936
Like Rumble, like X, like Locals, like Telegram, like Signal, like all this shit that they used against us.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:04.244
We're now over our 20th study looking at the harms of these shots and we will continue to do so.

01:23:04.584 --> 01:23:25.380
Now remember what this does is it ties together all kinds of things because remember, first of all, Pierre Corey, Robert Malone, Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough have basically been busy since the middle of 2020 and certainly the beginning of 2021 all around the United States.

01:23:25.996 --> 01:23:40.125
And often at that time, they were present at different things, you know, like America's Frontline Doctors, they were there for a while, then they got out of that and made the FLCCC, and that's where Corey stayed.

01:23:40.605 --> 01:23:44.007
But then Robert Malone was doing this International COVID Summit thing.

01:23:44.427 --> 01:23:48.590
And Ryan Cole has been, you know, working kind of with CHD and with these other things.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.451
But he toured the world with these,

01:23:52.012 --> 01:24:01.004
these international COVID summits as well and Ryan Cole was actually on stage with all of them at the worst one in Romania in November of 2023.

01:24:02.426 --> 01:24:10.076
So these guys are all one group and this with Dr. Drew is part of that same scripted bullshit on social media.

01:24:11.666 --> 01:24:14.608
until the government finally does something about it.

01:24:14.628 --> 01:24:20.411
Because unfortunately, our government did not look for any treatments for the vaccine injured.

01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:21.391
They have been ignored.

01:24:21.812 --> 01:24:26.054
There are millions of them, millions of vaccine injured Americans.

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.975
And so we have to start helping these people out.

01:24:29.195 --> 01:24:39.381
So think about what I said earlier about the placebo and how this would sound to a family who had no symptoms because they got a placebo or a town

01:24:42.555 --> 01:24:43.816
or a whole doctor's office.

01:24:45.396 --> 01:24:46.937
Because that's what this sounds like.

01:24:46.977 --> 01:24:53.780
If there are millions of people who are vaccine injured, then it shouldn't be very hard for this to go viral or for this to get out.

01:24:55.281 --> 01:25:06.306
I think part of the illusion is, and this is again going back to my assertion that the vast majority were placebo, there aren't millions of vaccine injured people.

01:25:08.007 --> 01:25:09.308
What do you think about them apples?

01:25:11.275 --> 01:25:19.463
I don't know how many people, if you go ask any of your friends or family, usually somebody knows somebody that has either died or been terminally disabled.

01:25:19.483 --> 01:25:20.323
I've got patients.

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:21.565
I've got patients.

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:23.586
And it's really very striking when you see it.

01:25:23.847 --> 01:25:25.128
It's not a rare thing.

01:25:25.188 --> 01:25:28.251
He's got patients, it's very striking when you see it.

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:32.555
And then they list no symptoms, they say nothing about it because it's an illusion.

01:25:33.456 --> 01:25:34.316
It's an illusion.

01:25:35.267 --> 01:25:42.767
The McCullough Foundation is an illusion and yet they're taking donations and they're paying people and they're part of this.

01:25:44.636 --> 01:25:46.698
He's also with the Wellness Company, right?

01:25:46.738 --> 01:25:55.946
This is all a scripted malevolent show with players that acted out on a Lollapalooza stage, and that's all it is.

01:25:56.126 --> 01:26:03.493
And they sucked us in, and we are being made fools of by everybody else in the world and in America.

01:26:04.113 --> 01:26:11.460
You gotta wake up and realize that if you're using social media like they want you to, you are completely unaware of how bad it is.

01:26:20.919 --> 01:26:40.240
Every cell in our body contains a molecule called DNA and that contains four much smaller blocks of molecules called A, C, T and G. These are repeated over and over again in various combinations to create a genetic code that amazingly makes us, us.

01:26:41.295 --> 01:27:02.730
the human genome project enables scientists to read it just like a barcode but the new synthetic genome project will take this a giant leap further not only will they be able to read the dna you can know many vaccine injured but that's still not millions because they could only be in your little geographic region they could be in only your group

01:27:04.432 --> 01:27:06.013
Millions is a lot of people.

01:27:06.093 --> 01:27:10.697
Remember, remember, America has about 350 million people in it.

01:27:10.757 --> 01:27:15.040
So if it's millions, then it's one or two or three out of every 300.

01:27:17.862 --> 01:27:20.043
I mean, we've got to see it for what it is, right?

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:24.827
They transfected a lot of old people because none of those people were going to be seen through.

01:27:24.887 --> 01:27:28.289
They, you know, whatever symptoms they had stroked out great.

01:27:30.471 --> 01:27:31.952
Old people didn't get placebos.

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:33.233
Kids got placebos.

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.977
You know, young people got placebos.

01:27:37.077 --> 01:27:41.220
Everybody that we could not have get an injury got placebos.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.483
And the ones that did get injured, those are pretty rare.

01:27:44.623 --> 01:27:49.206
And the ones that aren't rare, well, they were probably at university when they got their shot.

01:27:49.266 --> 01:27:50.547
What do you think about them apples?

01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:59.653
Because again, the hot shots would have been rolled out in places where the coercion was maximum and the questioning was made to be minimum.

01:28:00.354 --> 01:28:03.096
So not at your doctor's office, but at a university.

01:28:04.025 --> 01:28:10.931
And so I'm not saying that there aren't a lot of injured people, but the way that he says it is very dismissible.

01:28:11.031 --> 01:28:13.213
And I think we have to be very accurate about it.

01:28:13.253 --> 01:28:15.715
And so I'm not doubting that you know people who are injured.

01:28:15.755 --> 01:28:19.078
I'm doubting his narrative there, his use of this.

01:28:19.098 --> 01:28:20.740
So this is a BBC video.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:40.131
talking about the human genome project and sequencing and what's possible and you know now they're gonna make a synthetic human genome but it sounds weird right because 25 years ago they already sequenced and it was already announced and so now it's become cheaper and cheaper to make viral genomes it's already told us that 15 years ago

01:28:41.112 --> 01:28:49.627
with Ralph Baric, so why can't we just make it even longer and longer and longer and use the no-see-um technology to stitch together a whole human genome?

01:28:49.647 --> 01:28:51.731
You mean they're just getting around to do that right now?

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:59.582
They hope to be able to write parts of it, maybe one day all of it, from scratch, molecule by molecule.

01:28:59.662 --> 01:29:03.103
Oh, parts of it from scratch, not all of it from scratch.

01:29:03.123 --> 01:29:10.305
You see, now they're slowly rolling out the idea that we need to start editing people, and the only way to do it is to edit people.

01:29:10.725 --> 01:29:22.248
Now, keep in mind, one of the things that you may not be aware of if you're not a academic scientist and biologist, knockout rats.

01:29:24.288 --> 01:29:29.334
Rare and they are very difficult to make knockout monkeys.

01:29:29.354 --> 01:29:33.519
I don't even know if they exist Genetically altered monkeys.

01:29:33.599 --> 01:29:34.840
I don't even know if they exist.

01:29:34.981 --> 01:29:37.363
So something happens

01:29:38.502 --> 01:29:44.223
in this hierarchy of pattern integrities between the rat and the mouse.

01:29:45.204 --> 01:29:52.165
And at the inbred mouse level, it could also be that wild type mice are very difficult to genetically modify.

01:29:52.705 --> 01:30:03.368
But inbred mice in laboratories, because they are so homogenous, have also opened up the opportunity to modify genes and then have

01:30:04.048 --> 01:30:05.388
The animals survive.

01:30:05.408 --> 01:30:09.229
And so we've done that in a lot of genetic models of mice.

01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:14.611
And so that's given us this idea that we understand how genetics work.

01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:27.375
But what is important to realize is that those same tricks that can be done now pretty reliably in mice and have been used for decades in mice don't work in higher animals.

01:30:27.715 --> 01:30:28.415
They just don't work.

01:30:31.494 --> 01:30:38.481
And there is no good, simple explanation, you know, like they have an enzyme that we don't, or we have an enzyme that they don't, or, you know.

01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:52.394
They don't have an answer for that question, other than to say that there is a genetic simplicity at the level of a mouse, especially an inbred mouse strain, that isn't present in most other higher mammals.

01:30:54.150 --> 01:31:01.495
It's just they're too genetically complex to just take a gene and knock it out and then put it back in and at zygote and have the zygote grow.

01:31:01.535 --> 01:31:02.255
That doesn't work.

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:06.238
And that's very significant.

01:31:07.899 --> 01:31:16.384
It's a very significant gap in our understanding and yet you know as we move through organoids is one of those things that will get us around that problem.

01:31:17.498 --> 01:31:22.079
start for us to stop imagining that that problem and roadblock is even there.

01:31:22.579 --> 01:31:38.423
If we were to progress on the current logical sort of, you know, progression of what we're doing here, we've already optimized over the last 20 years across a whole swath of biological sciences how to use and minimize the ethical use of animals.

01:31:39.841 --> 01:31:47.249
We're not torturing animals anymore in most scenarios, even in neurobiology laboratories with monkeys.

01:31:47.349 --> 01:31:56.118
Generally speaking, the people that work on those monkeys care an awful lot about them and try as best they can to minimize the pain and torture and whatever of it.

01:31:56.838 --> 01:31:57.379
Is it good?

01:31:57.579 --> 01:31:58.580
Is it right?

01:31:59.441 --> 01:32:09.731
You can have that debate, but this idea that we're just butchering beagles to get products on the market is just absurd.

01:32:10.814 --> 01:32:13.656
Now, are we using beagles to make weapons and stuff like that?

01:32:13.696 --> 01:32:17.720
That could be, I don't know about that, but the FDA is not using beagles like that.

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:38.836
And so they're confusing everybody about the ethics of science, the ethic of investigation, but they're also confusing people about this barrier that we've come up against with regard to what we genetically understand in a dish with bacteria, what we genetically understand in a dish with a cell culture, and what we genetically understand in a mouse.

01:32:39.775 --> 01:32:45.129
Because although many of those rules are fairly well understood, they don't apply to anything above.

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:56.876
All of these techniques, all of these shortcuts, all of these methodologies, they just fall short of being able to replicate in higher animals that same kind of technique or we would have already done it.

01:32:56.976 --> 01:33:11.659
And so the bottom line is, is that there's no reason, they see no reason to climb that ladder if we spend another 40 years trying to develop genetically modified rats

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:28.762
only to find out that what we learned about a rat is specific to rats and mice only, and it didn't help us with primates, then in the end, we're going to be working up a ladder that doesn't reach to where we want to go.

01:33:28.842 --> 01:33:34.365
And as Robert Malone said, and many other people have said, mice don't give you the truth.

01:33:35.966 --> 01:33:37.067
Monkeys don't either.

01:33:37.127 --> 01:33:40.809
The only truth you can really get about human genetics is using humans.

01:33:43.348 --> 01:34:00.656
And so they needed a 20-year-long con to get our kids to accept using humans as the standard normal thing that modern medicine has to do because we've reached the end of the usefulness of the biology that we can discover about ourselves using animal models.

01:34:00.736 --> 01:34:05.319
And the argument isn't completely hollow, and that's why it rings true to so many people.

01:34:06.319 --> 01:34:07.840
I hope I'm not wasting my time here.

01:34:11.152 --> 01:34:12.473
Sorry, next slide.

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:14.595
Isn't it?

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:17.618
I think so.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:19.459
Yeah.

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:27.166
And so I'm going to play some music here, and then we'll get back to the show.

01:34:46.795 --> 01:34:49.576
Oh wait, sorry, I completely blew that.

01:34:51.176 --> 01:34:57.838
So what I wanted to show here is that this scripted bullshit can be seen through, okay?

01:34:57.878 --> 01:35:00.519
I don't have, this next slide doesn't fly in, but it doesn't matter.

01:35:00.539 --> 01:35:08.782
I've shown you this slide for a long time, and I just want to point out that all these people are now connected because of the fact that

01:35:10.442 --> 01:35:30.138
Kevin McCairn has been on Steve Kirsch's podcast twice once with Kevin McKernan and Kevin McKernan was on a huge podcast Not too long ago I'm just gonna get out of this for a second not too long ago where he said that this guy was the guy who helped Robert F Kennedy jr.

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:32.399
With his book when in fact this guy was fired

01:35:33.314 --> 01:35:35.455
while he was helping Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:35.495 --> 01:35:50.825
write this book, because he streamed the discussion, which was behind an NDA, with this guy in the hotel room, and then didn't bother to call and explain it, and so CHD fired him.

01:35:52.066 --> 01:36:00.331
And so I think at that time, the people that were in CHD and working for CHD didn't all know that CHD was fake.

01:36:01.209 --> 01:36:05.170
And it may be that some of those people are still there, not really understanding that it's fake.

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:16.832
But at that time, they had very little thing they could do, because if they didn't fire him for streaming with this guy, they would be essentially admitting that they already knew who he was.

01:36:16.912 --> 01:36:24.394
And of course, at that time, I was insisting, and I still do, that the only reason why this guy exists on Team Robert Malone is because of me.

01:36:25.434 --> 01:36:29.475
They brought him in because he did some post-doc with some guy that I was working with,

01:36:30.265 --> 01:36:31.526
at the University of Pittsburgh.

01:36:31.566 --> 01:36:37.149
And so he could call me up in March of 2020 and say, hey dude, I used to work with this guy that you're working with now.

01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:39.811
We should do a stream about coronavirus.

01:36:39.851 --> 01:36:42.212
I saw your, your YouTube channel.

01:36:42.252 --> 01:36:42.672
Oh really?

01:36:42.712 --> 01:36:42.973
Wow.

01:36:43.033 --> 01:36:43.233
Cool.

01:36:43.273 --> 01:36:44.373
You're a neuroscientist too.

01:36:44.393 --> 01:36:44.994
That's awesome.

01:36:45.014 --> 01:36:48.096
And then, and then he brought me in with Paul Cottrell.

01:36:48.156 --> 01:36:55.640
These two guys are all associated with George Webb, who of course is in some kind of lawsuit with Robert Malone, or used to be just like the Breggans.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.682
It's one malevolent show.

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:11.035
And so if we move to the next slide, you can see, um, this, it's just crazy.

01:37:11.095 --> 01:37:13.956
He has streamed with Andrew Kaufman.

01:37:14.396 --> 01:37:23.280
He has streamed with this, this, this guy who Dr. Philip McMillan, he is one of the most amazing frauds from the UK.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:31.424
Um, he has streamed with this Angus de Glesch, who's like a immunologist that streamed with, uh, with, um,

01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:37.332
with John Campbell so often.

01:37:37.452 --> 01:37:50.242
And then this guy who was on my stream very early with a bunch of skulls behind him and has now become this, you know, hurt guy because his Give Send Go has a quarter million dollars in it, but the Canadian government's taking it away.

01:37:50.643 --> 01:37:52.344
And so he's really on stage.

01:37:52.384 --> 01:38:01.692
He's getting to do all the Substack stuff and getting all the subscribers from Substack and also from Give Send Go, but has to whine about the fact that they're taking his PayPal money.

01:38:02.112 --> 01:38:03.253
It's really remarkable.

01:38:05.919 --> 01:38:14.601
And so remember he streamed with these two, this is just the most damning evidence there is besides the fact that he was also on with this Jordan Vaughn guy.

01:38:14.681 --> 01:38:18.862
And Jordan Vaughn, the videos of him of 2021 are just extraordinary.

01:38:18.882 --> 01:38:21.903
He's literally auditioning for the show.

01:38:23.444 --> 01:38:30.285
I mean, up here in the corner, I don't know if you can see this, this Bruce Patterson is a guy who published with Robert Malone at the beginning of the pandemic.

01:38:30.325 --> 01:38:32.726
Bruce Patterson on there is just ridiculous.

01:38:34.045 --> 01:38:36.406
And I think Mark Kulak could tell you more about that guy.

01:38:36.426 --> 01:38:38.527
And then Pierre Cory blowing the lid off SIDS.

01:38:39.007 --> 01:38:40.648
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

01:38:40.688 --> 01:38:41.588
This is bullshit.

01:38:43.769 --> 01:38:53.353
If these people were real, like Tony Bark was, if they were real, like Brandy Vaughn was, they would have blown the lid off of SIDS in the Vaxxed movie.

01:38:54.568 --> 01:38:57.750
They would have blown the lid off of SIDS in the Vaxxed movie.

01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:02.294
They would have blown the lid off of SIDS in the Vaxxed movie.

01:39:02.414 --> 01:39:04.635
Or maybe in the Vaxxed 2 movie.

01:39:05.156 --> 01:39:10.319
But, you know, they didn't even blow the lid off of SIDS in the Vaxxed 3 movie!

01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:18.699
And so they're telling you the truth.

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:20.100
It's right out there.

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:29.323
They're collecting the DNA from the babies in these more already communal health services.

01:39:29.603 --> 01:39:31.023
And they're telling you they're doing it.

01:39:31.444 --> 01:39:32.704
In America, they're going to do it.

01:39:32.744 --> 01:39:37.265
They're just going to de-identify the data first and use the algorithm to bring it in.

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.046
And they'll use any data that they need to.

01:39:39.895 --> 01:39:44.301
where you attended school, where the tests were done, yada, yada, yada, and there it is.

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:46.243
Remember, they don't need to...

01:39:48.067 --> 01:39:55.092
they don't need my data, they don't need your data, they need college age kids data, the ones that haven't had kids yet that are going to have kids.

01:39:55.573 --> 01:40:12.145
That's the generation they're collecting now as best they can as kind of a practice exercise to see how much data there is and what kind of infrastructure is necessary to process it and how much storage they need and how many wires they need to connect to that computer or the other computer.

01:40:12.745 --> 01:40:16.088
All of these things are being tested and reiterated and

01:40:16.568 --> 01:40:28.432
and designed because they don't have a firm plan on how they're going to take billions of genomes and billions of medical records and feed them into a machine learning algorithm, what would you start with?

01:40:31.153 --> 01:40:41.396
So there's a lot of optimizing and new takes that have to happen, but they got to start first and with a willing population that's already participating in anything they're told to do.

01:40:46.964 --> 01:40:52.127
And so I was going to play this, but now I'm thinking, wow, I've really gone over.

01:40:52.167 --> 01:40:53.108
It's 140.

01:40:54.048 --> 01:41:00.612
And I want to do a musical break.

01:41:00.652 --> 01:41:03.093
And then maybe I guess I'm going to go back to that.

01:41:05.054 --> 01:41:06.975
So maybe I'm going to escape out of here.

01:41:08.116 --> 01:41:12.018
And then I'm going to cut this and put it down here.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:18.002
And then I'm going to tease you with what we're going to do tomorrow, because I guess I've got to move this forward then.

01:41:19.863 --> 01:41:24.145
Okay, so now's the time if you want to, sorry, take a little break.

01:41:24.525 --> 01:41:28.908
And I'll be back in about, let's see, when will I be back?

01:41:28.968 --> 01:41:30.788
In five minutes and ten seconds.

01:41:31.809 --> 01:41:33.030
Thanks very much for being here.

01:41:34.971 --> 01:41:36.671
Thanks, thanks, thanks for being here, really.

01:41:36.992 --> 01:41:37.552
It means a lot.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.224
Yeah.

01:43:00.339 --> 01:43:26.510
And then you sense a change Nothing feels the same All your dreams are strange Love comes walking in Some kind of alien Waits for the opening Simply pulls the string Another world Some other time

01:43:33.942 --> 01:43:38.866
Familiar faces, familiar sights.

01:43:39.006 --> 01:43:43.729
Reach back, remember with all your might.

01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:49.734
Ooh, and there she stands in a silken gown.

01:43:49.814 --> 01:43:53.717
Silver lights shining down.

01:43:55.572 --> 01:43:58.133
A brand new sense of change.

01:43:58.713 --> 01:44:00.953
Nothing feels the same.

01:44:01.714 --> 01:44:03.834
All your dreams are strange.

01:44:04.194 --> 01:44:09.856
Love, I'm walking in some kind of alien.

01:44:09.916 --> 01:44:12.576
It's for the opening.

01:44:13.056 --> 01:44:15.177
It's simply for the street.

01:45:10.406 --> 01:45:12.040
Across a milky way

01:45:36.002 --> 01:45:38.484
And can you sense a change?

01:45:39.104 --> 01:45:41.926
Nothing feels the same.

01:45:42.167 --> 01:45:44.228
All your dreams are strange.

01:45:44.488 --> 01:45:46.870
Love comes walking in.

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:49.532
Some kind of alien.

01:45:49.652 --> 01:45:52.134
It's for the old family.

01:45:52.154 --> 01:45:55.396
It simply pulls the string.

01:45:55.476 --> 01:45:56.157
Love comes walking in.

01:46:47.552 --> 01:46:53.334
They are all scripted bullshitters on Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's bullshit script.

01:46:53.394 --> 01:46:56.395
What a long strange trip it has been ladies and gentlemen.

01:46:56.415 --> 01:46:59.316
Welcome to the show's second half.

01:46:59.536 --> 01:47:02.597
I do think that Suzanne Humphreys is a scripted liar.

01:47:03.657 --> 01:47:10.980
There's no way to explain how when Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn were alive she was able to so succinctly say

01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:26.927
uh that there are no safe vaccines that she doesn't think it's possible because it's antithetical to our biology um and uh quite frankly i wish um i would have had that video and been where i was when i was working for chd at the

01:47:27.787 --> 01:47:37.713
second CHD conference in Savannah, Georgia, because there I could have confronted her in person about why she just doesn't say that on stage anymore.

01:47:38.993 --> 01:47:44.677
And I didn't because I wasn't aware of it and I was kept away from her by the rest of the organization.

01:47:44.797 --> 01:47:48.779
Really remarkable, really remarkable place that we are in.

01:47:49.299 --> 01:47:53.161
And I do feel a little bit like one of the few people who has seen the alien.

01:47:53.622 --> 01:47:55.322
This is what it looks like from the other side.

01:47:56.483 --> 01:48:04.065
a professor Debbie Switter who is a chair of global health at University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

01:48:05.065 --> 01:48:07.026
I've had the chance to interview her.

01:48:07.266 --> 01:48:14.907
She is a a person who is a head of something public health I believe in Scotland where the murder happened.

01:48:15.287 --> 01:48:22.489
The real big murder that that that wonderful sub stack that I plug at the beginning here documents so well.

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:25.170
This guy's at Scripps

01:48:26.129 --> 01:48:32.678
where I believe Christian Anderson now works, and he's the head of that place, and he's been on PBS NewsHour.

01:48:33.158 --> 01:48:38.025
She was on social media like a demon, and on X like a demon in 2020 and 2021.

01:48:40.543 --> 01:48:47.588
Every year once before, years back when she had her book Preventable, she has a new book out, which is just getting in the U.S.

01:48:47.708 --> 01:48:48.789
A second book!

01:48:48.969 --> 01:48:58.176
You know, they all are getting lucky with multi-generational wealth just by having a book and being able to plug it on these artificial platforms.

01:48:59.795 --> 01:49:05.678
How Not to Die Too Soon, The Lies We've Been Told and the Policies That Can Save Us.

01:49:06.699 --> 01:49:12.863
It's an extraordinary book, and the convergence with the book I recently had published, Super Ages, is also notable.

01:49:13.303 --> 01:49:14.584
We look at it very differently.

01:49:14.704 --> 01:49:19.526
I'm looking at it more from an individual level, and Debbie from the world level.

01:49:19.546 --> 01:49:23.709
I mean, she has a planetary perspective, which we'll get into, which is quite remarkable.

01:49:24.029 --> 01:49:24.909
So welcome, Debbie.

01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:27.471
Yeah, thanks for having me.

01:49:28.533 --> 01:49:43.723
Yeah, well it's such a treat to be able to talk to you about the insights you have because you really are the wizard for me in global health and one of the... A wizard in global health, holy shit!

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:46.285
...leading public health.

01:49:47.886 --> 01:49:51.449
Her name is Devi and the last name is Sridhar.

01:49:51.509 --> 01:49:53.150
I don't know if that makes her Indian.

01:49:55.791 --> 01:49:58.894
faculty, professors, resources in the world.

01:49:58.954 --> 01:50:17.208
So, first thing I wanted to get to is when you were putting DEVI, D-E-V-I, though, it's DEVI, together, what was the main premise about, you know, it wasn't, I don't think, longevity per se, but maybe you could get us straight now.

01:50:17.348 --> 01:50:18.489
I guess I got to do it, right?

01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:19.690
I'm going to do the Wikipedia.

01:50:28.786 --> 01:50:30.187
A wiki, she's got a wiki.

01:50:31.467 --> 01:50:35.629
Is an American born health researcher who now works in Scotland.

01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:38.030
She's written several books.

01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:44.973
She was a member of the SAGE committee at the university and the UK.

01:50:45.033 --> 01:50:45.694
That's awesome.

01:50:48.075 --> 01:50:50.376
Her father was Kazi Sridhar.

01:50:51.416 --> 01:50:53.857
She was in Miami for an Indian family.

01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:54.458
There you go.

01:50:54.558 --> 01:50:57.359
I mean, I don't want to be a shit head, but this is another Indian.

01:50:58.868 --> 01:51:00.393
This is another Indian family.

01:51:00.674 --> 01:51:02.760
It's another Indian that went to Oxford.

01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.649
I mean, come on, come on.

01:51:07.045 --> 01:51:08.186
This is absurd.

01:51:08.306 --> 01:51:10.488
This is freaking absurd.

01:51:10.568 --> 01:51:11.629
Look at this person.

01:51:11.929 --> 01:51:12.329
Come on.

01:51:12.690 --> 01:51:13.090
Come on.

01:51:13.611 --> 01:51:21.197
I don't know if you noticed, but they had this new Star Trek that came out last year, the year before, the year before that.

01:51:21.237 --> 01:51:22.598
I don't remember what it's called anymore.

01:51:22.658 --> 01:51:23.259
New Worlds.

01:51:23.799 --> 01:51:26.301
A lot of genetic modification.

01:51:26.341 --> 01:51:30.285
And also, the really pretty Vulcan happens to be Indian.

01:51:33.439 --> 01:51:34.359
It's fantastic.

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.180
I'm just nuts though.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.521
You know, this is crazy talk.

01:51:38.861 --> 01:51:40.301
Anyway, here we go.

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:42.622
Here we go.

01:51:43.942 --> 01:51:52.605
Yeah, I guess it was looking at the gap between our knowledge of health and how to live longer and the amazing scientific research that's happened.

01:51:52.885 --> 01:51:55.165
They research, but it's Americans.

01:51:55.986 --> 01:51:58.847
Um, and yeah, Star Trek strange new worlds.

01:51:58.927 --> 01:51:59.847
It's like they had,

01:52:00.467 --> 01:52:16.032
They had like three or four episodes in a row where the main theme was something to do with genetic modification and whether, you know, talking about the ethics of it and whether we should change the environment to suit us or whether we should change us to suit the environment.

01:52:17.292 --> 01:52:18.072
It's pretty awesome.

01:52:19.633 --> 01:52:20.033
Anyway.

01:52:21.471 --> 01:52:24.013
My son is giving me shit because I haven't fed the fish.

01:52:24.073 --> 01:52:26.175
I mean, seriously, come on now.

01:52:26.255 --> 01:52:27.196
Oh, they did get bikes.

01:52:27.396 --> 01:52:27.976
That's nice.

01:52:28.096 --> 01:52:28.296
Good.

01:52:28.797 --> 01:52:30.318
They were out getting, trying to get bikes.

01:52:31.018 --> 01:52:31.419
That's funny.

01:52:31.499 --> 01:52:38.965
And life expectancy going backwards, especially since the pandemic and also seeing the rise of chronic disease in younger people like diabetes and cancers.

01:52:39.025 --> 01:52:41.246
I'm trying to think why is there this gap?

01:52:41.807 --> 01:52:42.107
Wow.

01:52:42.127 --> 01:52:49.473
So she just is a wizard and she's going to solve the American health crisis just like Bobby Kennedy, but you know, from Scotland, I guess.

01:52:50.728 --> 01:52:53.729
between our knowledge and actually what's happening.

01:52:55.210 --> 01:53:02.913
And then in the course of it, I started looking at people like Brian Johnson, who I know you look at in your book, thinking, oh, wow, there are a lot of people thinking about this issue.

01:53:03.434 --> 01:53:07.075
But the way I'm thinking about it was much more, I think, global.

01:53:07.095 --> 01:53:09.056
I'm American, but I've lived in Britain.

01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:10.717
I've lived in a bunch of different countries.

01:53:11.617 --> 01:53:13.218
My team does research across the world.

01:53:13.278 --> 01:53:17.540
And so trying to bring a global perspective to this, but also one where

01:53:18.652 --> 01:53:21.635
We as individuals are much like social beings.

01:53:21.816 --> 01:53:34.570
So actually, where you live, especially since the pandemic, and also seeing the rise of chronic disease in younger people, like diabetes and cancers, and trying to think, why is there this gap between our knowledge and actually what's happening?

01:53:34.590 --> 01:53:38.014
I don't think longevity per se, but maybe you could get a straighten out on that.

01:53:39.369 --> 01:53:47.996
Yeah, I guess it was looking at the gap between our knowledge of health and how to live longer and the amazing scientific research that's happened.

01:53:48.016 --> 01:53:50.578
I should say research, but it's Americans.

01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:58.904
And life expectancy going backwards, especially since the pandemic and also seeing the rise of chronic disease in younger people.

01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:08.132
She has no idea why the life expectancy might've gone backwards since the pandemic, other than maybe murdering people?

01:54:09.125 --> 01:54:19.084
other than maybe allowing manslaughter, encouraging it, scripting it, and then making sure it got covered up on social media by useful idiots like her?

01:54:19.104 --> 01:54:20.867
Holy shit!

01:54:21.567 --> 01:54:28.113
And of course, this is an American who can't be bothered to know what's happening in America because she's a faculty member in Scotland.

01:54:28.153 --> 01:54:32.277
She used to live in the UK, you know, so I got a lot of global connections.

01:54:32.357 --> 01:54:37.762
I see it from a global perspective, you know, because I'm always on a plane, like I'm not normal.

01:54:37.842 --> 01:54:39.263
I'm kind of cool like that.

01:54:39.283 --> 01:54:46.850
Well, like diabetes and cancers, I'm trying to think, why is there this gap between our knowledge and actually what's happening?

01:54:48.672 --> 01:54:55.220
There is no gap in our knowledge except the gaps that are created by the idiots on social media because we understand.

01:54:57.602 --> 01:55:00.606
Mark Housatonic, Mark Kulak in Boston understands.

01:55:00.686 --> 01:55:02.048
Joe Marshall understands.

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:06.032
I thought at one point in time Scott Shara understood.

01:55:06.072 --> 01:55:07.374
I'm not sure he does anymore.

01:55:09.545 --> 01:55:12.026
Dang it, it's desperate, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:12.046 --> 01:55:18.228
I started looking at people like Brian Johnson, who I know you look at, and you're thinking, oh wow, there are a lot of people thinking about this issue.

01:55:18.348 --> 01:55:23.150
Okay, so I'm gonna move on to the next slide, which has the video that I wanna watch with you tomorrow.

01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:26.592
I thought I was gonna watch that video as the second part today, but we have no time.

01:55:26.812 --> 01:55:28.632
I'm talking way too much.

01:55:28.853 --> 01:55:35.155
I have too much to say, too much going on, and too much built up material that we have to cover.

01:55:35.175 --> 01:55:36.235
So there's a lot of work to do.

01:55:36.295 --> 01:55:37.236
I will be on tomorrow.

01:55:38.236 --> 01:55:42.697
I don't know for sure if no days off really means no days off, but I'm thinking it does.

01:55:43.657 --> 01:55:46.058
For a little while, I'm feeling the wind in my sails.

01:55:47.238 --> 01:55:52.920
So tomorrow we're gonna do this video, but I'm gonna let this video start so that you can get an idea of where it will be.

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:59.061
It's much closer to what I would envision as a potential kind of study hall for Biology 101.

01:55:59.381 --> 01:56:06.263
Not about the meddling, not about the pandemic, but about biology and life and talking about a new model

01:56:07.023 --> 01:56:09.685
And I don't know if I'm going to agree with this lady or not.

01:56:09.845 --> 01:56:17.889
I do know that it's going to be an interesting conversation, I think, that maybe I'm not completely qualified to even critique.

01:56:17.989 --> 01:56:22.552
But I'm looking forward to it because I think it's better homework than this.

01:56:38.666 --> 01:56:39.448
Good evening.

01:56:39.708 --> 01:56:42.554
Welcome to our Long Nail Talk with Sarah Omari Walker.

01:56:47.617 --> 01:56:51.280
I'm Rebecca Lendl, Executive Director here at the Long Now Foundation.

01:56:51.300 --> 01:57:02.147
I'm excited to now introduce to you our guest host for the evening, Benjamin Bratton, Director of the Antikythera Program at the Berggruen Institute.

01:57:02.487 --> 01:57:08.131
Benjamin and Sarah are longtime collaborators and they're working at the very edges of their respective disciplines.

01:57:08.251 --> 01:57:11.053
What a great recommendation in the chat.

01:57:11.173 --> 01:57:15.456
If you haven't seen it, Time Bandits is indeed a fabulous movie.

01:57:16.116 --> 01:57:18.658
And yes, I feel kind of the same as Entropy Rider.

01:57:19.159 --> 01:57:23.382
I probably should re-watch that because it is really a classic.

01:57:23.482 --> 01:57:23.823
Wow.

01:57:24.783 --> 01:57:27.025
I can still kind of remember the first time I saw it.

01:57:27.045 --> 01:57:28.306
It was with Kevin and Billy.

01:57:28.426 --> 01:57:29.207
I can remember that.

01:57:29.728 --> 01:57:35.132
And we're fortunate to have them here with us tonight as kind of voyagers at these new frontiers of thought.

01:57:35.672 --> 01:57:37.834
Yes, you see it correctly, Fletch.

01:57:37.994 --> 01:57:40.136
It is the long now foundation.

01:57:40.216 --> 01:57:41.898
It is the long perspective.

01:57:42.608 --> 01:57:45.234
And that's why I was so curious about what this would be about.

01:57:45.414 --> 01:57:46.677
Excellent, excellent catch.

01:57:46.697 --> 01:57:49.082
Thank you for being with us and enjoy.

01:57:49.382 --> 01:57:51.066
And over to you, Benjamin Bratton.

01:57:54.695 --> 01:57:55.656
Thanks, Rebecca.

01:57:55.936 --> 01:57:58.257
As you'll see, Sarah's talk is going to be quite a wild ride.

01:57:59.157 --> 01:58:12.004
So what I have come up with is sort of like, let's say, some key concepts of Walkerism that if you can kind of hold on to, this may help give you a little bit of a menu of what you're in store for.

01:58:12.624 --> 01:58:14.985
First, astrobiology.

01:58:15.186 --> 01:58:18.907
We generally think of astrobiology as like the Martians have suffered from outer space.

01:58:19.348 --> 01:58:22.509
No, it's also a way in which we think about us right here.

01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:24.010
We are the astrobiology.

01:58:24.250 --> 01:58:35.744
Astrobiology is how Joshua Lederberg thought about the possibility that a comet passing by the Earth would have the requisite water content to maybe seed an ocean.

01:58:37.282 --> 01:58:46.331
or the requisite, you know, it could carry things from other places like viruses and bacteria to seed life on earth.

01:58:46.591 --> 01:58:56.000
And so Joshua Lederberg was one of the first people to really think about that and to really codify it as an idea and came up with the word exobiology.

01:58:56.801 --> 01:59:13.311
And incidentally, what we just mentioned a little while ago, Star Trek New Worlds, there's an episode where there's this comet that goes past a planet and sheds a little bit of its water and then, you know, takes a desert planet and turns it into a green one or something like that.

01:59:13.371 --> 01:59:15.012
So it's all there.

01:59:15.232 --> 01:59:16.373
It's all there.

01:59:17.213 --> 01:59:21.516
And this narrative that we need to start thinking on longer timescales and

01:59:22.196 --> 01:59:31.382
and give up our sovereignty to the benefit of the species or to the imperative of the species is all blended in here, I suspect.

01:59:31.462 --> 01:59:35.144
But again, we're only gonna watch a few minutes and then I'm gonna retire for the day.

01:59:35.564 --> 01:59:39.107
I've got a lot of things to do in the backyard that need to be done.

01:59:39.847 --> 01:59:42.148
And then I'll be preparing for tomorrow morning again.

01:59:42.349 --> 01:59:43.850
It's life in relationship to this.

01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:50.071
Second, selection, what we think of as natural selection, begins before biology.

01:59:50.372 --> 01:59:58.374
It's actually much deeper in time and deeper in process, which if you think about it actually sort of changes everything.

01:59:59.554 --> 02:00:05.836
Life, which is the main sort of the topic of Sarah's work, is something that is different from being alive.

02:00:06.796 --> 02:00:20.874
Alive and life are actually different things which she will explain in some detail that light as life Evolves and accrues it builds upon itself It's all about scaffolds and scaffolds building on scaffolds.

02:00:21.114 --> 02:00:23.978
And so again, what he's enforcing is this idea that

02:00:24.358 --> 02:00:30.543
From nothing came us, and it's a random process that we just need to understand.

02:00:31.163 --> 02:00:33.345
The complexity comes from nowhere.

02:00:33.825 --> 02:00:43.993
And that would be a very similar argument to saying that I found this watch on the ground, and the complexity that's found in the watch is generated from nature.

02:00:44.013 --> 02:00:44.213
Right?

02:00:50.216 --> 02:00:51.457
That's what we're talking about here.

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:51.757
It is.

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:52.358
It is.

02:00:52.378 --> 02:00:54.019
It's made by men and women.

02:00:54.639 --> 02:00:55.760
It's a man-made thing.

02:00:56.761 --> 02:01:05.848
But what we find in a cell, we're supposed to believe, and these people believe, actually the right word should be assume.

02:01:06.108 --> 02:01:09.531
These people assume that we are at the end of

02:01:11.512 --> 02:01:32.567
infinitesimally long process of the accumulation of complexity just like this watch is the accumulation of complexity you know this is better than the other watches that were made before and they got better and better and the same thing happened spontaneously that resulted in us

02:01:34.767 --> 02:01:36.789
And that's the thing.

02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:42.073
They want you to believe that this has an intelligence behind it, but you do not.

02:01:43.094 --> 02:01:44.255
There's no design.

02:01:44.876 --> 02:01:52.462
It's just a natural process for whom the rules are for what the rules we still don't know, for which the rules are still unknown.

02:01:53.302 --> 02:01:56.165
scaffolds building on scaffolds that becomes increasingly complex.

02:01:56.986 --> 02:02:00.509
The newest thing is actually the oldest thing, as Sarah will explain.

02:02:00.549 --> 02:02:06.736
So the amount of complexity in something also speaks to the amount of time it took for this to evolve.

02:02:07.236 --> 02:02:09.939
The amount of time in something is the amount of complexity in it.

02:02:09.999 --> 02:02:13.523
And so the most complex things in our universe, like our technosphere,

02:02:13.703 --> 02:02:20.588
So you can hear already one of the problems is going to be where they define things, what they define as things and living things.

02:02:20.708 --> 02:02:31.376
And so as Joshua Lederberg pointed out, it could be, and I've tried to hone this language and I think it will eventually be stolen by these people if I don't write the book about it.

02:02:32.437 --> 02:02:35.419
But it's a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

02:02:35.479 --> 02:02:39.002
And so this encapsulates both the ideas of

02:02:39.782 --> 02:02:52.647
of Buckminster Fuller and the ideas of Joshua Lederberg with regard to euphenics and eugenics and also this idea of a pattern integrity and what it means and thinking about it in four-dimensional space.

02:02:53.107 --> 02:03:00.650
So I'm very excited because I think that this is just going to be an absolute win, win, win.

02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:07.573
It's going to be the world series of wins this whole year because they can't follow us where we're going.

02:03:08.632 --> 02:03:15.732
They can't climb to the heights that we are going to climb and they can't really expound on the ideas that we are going to give to our kids.

02:03:16.479 --> 02:03:21.883
They're gonna have to ignore us more aggressively than they've ever ignored us before.

02:03:21.903 --> 02:03:25.826
And I know I'm making big statements here, but I'm very, very confident at this point.

02:03:26.606 --> 02:03:34.372
I'm really excited because I need to devote time this afternoon to getting to the gym as part of this ongoing development month.

02:03:34.432 --> 02:03:40.136
I intend to put quite a few extra hours in this month that I haven't been doing previously.

02:03:40.656 --> 02:03:43.118
And so that involves a little bit of prioritizing.

02:03:43.158 --> 02:03:44.319
So that's what I'm gonna do now.

02:03:45.179 --> 02:03:57.242
And tomorrow morning I will be on, I hope at 1010, and I will start quickly with this woman's presentation, which is over an hour, but we'll watch it outside of PowerPoint so I can speed it up a little bit and pause and take notes.

02:03:57.562 --> 02:04:06.744
And so if you want to find it, it's the Long Day Foundation, and I think her name was Sarah Amari something or other, you could find it and watch it ahead of time, maybe do some homework.

02:04:08.789 --> 02:04:14.717
Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget that there was a background with an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and lies.

02:04:15.218 --> 02:04:18.682
None of these people will ever tell you that because this is part of the illusion.

02:04:18.743 --> 02:04:23.169
They also won't try to assemble a list to help you understand what actually happened.

02:04:23.809 --> 02:04:26.213
They're just going to talk about it in amorphous terms.

02:04:26.633 --> 02:04:30.555
And definitely not going to use any slides or any, you know, published lists like this.

02:04:31.336 --> 02:04:36.199
Because endemicity is a myth that they need you to accept and they cannot challenge.

02:04:36.639 --> 02:04:42.022
And that's why the PCR test will never be challenged and why the idea of placebo will never get out there.

02:04:42.462 --> 02:04:44.564
Because they need their ghosts to remain real.

02:04:46.185 --> 02:04:48.846
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

02:04:48.886 --> 02:04:49.927
It's for the children of Earth.

02:04:50.903 --> 02:04:51.703
I love you very much.

02:04:51.943 --> 02:04:53.224
Sorry I missed you yesterday.

02:04:53.664 --> 02:04:56.565
Don't forget that these people are just posers.

02:04:56.665 --> 02:04:57.285
They are not real.

02:04:57.305 --> 02:05:00.946
In the past months, I've had a lot of... They're not real.

02:05:01.486 --> 02:05:03.266
And don't take their bait.

02:05:04.267 --> 02:05:08.588
AI is probably just a bunch of Indian guys in a room with Photoshop and...

02:05:10.227 --> 02:05:15.472
and Adobe Premiere, teaching the AI algorithm how to make these dumb pictures.

02:05:16.012 --> 02:05:21.637
The endemicity is a myth, but collecting your genome and trying to use AI to decipher it is definitely not.

02:05:21.697 --> 02:05:23.218
They have all their eggs in that basket.

02:05:24.199 --> 02:05:30.285
And you can see these coordinated liars because they even put papers out together with Steve Hatfill and friends.

02:05:31.385 --> 02:05:38.732
I can't tell you enough how important it is to understand that this picture is his criminal evidence.

02:05:39.232 --> 02:05:40.153
This is the picture.

02:05:40.614 --> 02:05:41.674
I love you guys very much.

02:05:42.255 --> 02:05:43.036
See you again tomorrow.
