00:30.000 --> 00:50.840
Good evening everybody, hi Jill, hi Pamela, hi Jason, solar fire and Artemis, welcome

00:50.840 --> 00:57.640
to the show. Can you give me a sound check please? And then we'll be on our way.

01:04.600 --> 01:09.640
Early, what I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain. So what do I

01:09.640 --> 01:13.160
do? I go to Des Moines. Ladies and gentlemen, the people on the screen, I

01:13.160 --> 01:16.160
have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years. I go to Des Moines. I

01:16.480 --> 01:21.360
infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines. I go to Seattle. I infect a

01:21.360 --> 01:27.440
couple of cases there. I go to North Carolina. I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing

01:27.440 --> 01:31.760
is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a

01:31.760 --> 01:36.560
highly morbid condition. These individuals complain. Again, this is a central nervous

01:36.560 --> 01:40.640
system condition. So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do. It'll produce

01:40.720 --> 01:45.680
some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. And

01:45.680 --> 01:51.440
then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet. I take attribution for that.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.600
Yes, I'm a terrorist group. And I have done this by infecting with a highly

01:55.600 --> 02:00.160
little agent. And the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x, y and z.

02:00.160 --> 02:04.720
These people are really sick with this. But then I say others who are also infected

02:05.280 --> 02:10.640
will show subdramal, pre-dramal signs of lethality. And what that will be is anxiety,

02:11.360 --> 02:16.800
sleeplessness, agitation. What I've now done is I've got every individual who is

02:16.800 --> 02:20.240
diagonistically hypochondriacal. And I've got every individual who's

02:20.240 --> 02:25.760
worried well, flooding the public health system, banging on the door. The CDC comes back and says

02:25.760 --> 02:32.880
nonsense. That's not real. I come back and say, that's fake news. And as a consequence of doing

02:32.880 --> 02:37.360
that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.680
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.440
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent

02:51.440 --> 02:55.680
really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone,

02:56.400 --> 03:01.760
you know, and, you know, it's not, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what

03:01.760 --> 03:06.960
you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it. It's just a big

03:06.960 --> 03:16.240
hassle in the end. But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and

03:18.560 --> 03:25.040
it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs. It'll be a

03:25.040 --> 03:31.520
moral emergency because it has to be. And this is just sheer contingency as to whether in one

03:31.520 --> 03:32.880
condition or another. I mean, so.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.920
And I also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooey, who some of you will know from his

03:42.960 --> 03:48.160
lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a bike journal club on a bike,

03:49.200 --> 03:53.360
that he also has advanced a version of this hypothesis. So I don't claim it to be unique.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.360
I do think I arrived at it independently.

03:55.360 --> 04:03.520
So that he said lab leak series. I never noticed that before.

04:04.800 --> 04:11.040
It wasn't the lab leak series. It was a coronavirus series. I never once called it a lab leak series.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.680
That's so interesting. Infectious disease to the degree that we could. If we made that public

04:15.680 --> 04:21.760
enemy number one, we might simultaneously do be doing the best possible thing to limit the

04:21.760 --> 04:24.400
attractiveness of totalitarian ideology.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.280
That gets dumber and dumber every time I hear it.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.760
I'm working on getting some subtitles and a transcript from the interview with Wolfgang.

04:45.760 --> 04:53.280
I appreciate the, uh, appreciate the compliments. Um, I really looked forward to that interview.

04:53.280 --> 05:00.400
I was an hour behind schedule life and it just went, it went better almost because I got taken

05:00.400 --> 05:07.920
off guard. I think it tells us that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially

05:07.920 --> 05:12.160
a worst case scenario. I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with

05:12.160 --> 05:18.320
essentially a worst case scenario. I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed

05:18.320 --> 05:23.600
that we are sitting here unmasked and I should point out that actually we are in an interesting

05:23.600 --> 05:30.160
sense, a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar. So if I'm correct,

05:30.160 --> 05:35.600
you Robert have had COVID. I've had COVID and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna. All right.

05:36.320 --> 05:43.040
Steve, you have been vaccinated fully vaccinated with Moderna. All right. I am unvaccinated, but I

05:43.040 --> 05:48.640
am on prophylactic ivermectin and the data actually shocking as this will be to some people. The data

05:48.640 --> 05:55.120
suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from

05:55.120 --> 06:01.680
contracting COVID when taken properly. Aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got

06:01.680 --> 06:07.280
wasn't real and I have every reason to think it was. It certainly appears to be the genuine

06:07.280 --> 06:13.120
article. I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity

06:13.120 --> 06:19.840
where through three different routes, COVID vaccine and ivermectin, we are protected and you

06:19.840 --> 06:25.120
are doubly protected. So I would just say that for anybody who's enthusiastic about the vaccines,

06:25.120 --> 06:29.520
if you're unconvinced by what we have to say about the hazard of them, one thing to consider

06:29.520 --> 06:34.880
is that the way to get society to herd immunity and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction which

06:34.880 --> 06:39.920
ought to be our goal, the way to do it is to get people into this category one way or the other,

06:39.920 --> 06:44.320
whether that's through prophylaxis, whether it's through a vaccine or whether it's because

06:44.320 --> 06:50.880
they've had COVID already. One could argue that if everybody just took ivermectin for a month

06:52.320 --> 06:58.560
worldwide, really independent. Some will find the title that I have given this episode

06:58.560 --> 07:05.040
perplexing. I would ask them to stick with the episode through the end and I will explain why

07:05.040 --> 07:12.000
I titled it as I did. I will save the world in three easy steps. At any moment we decide to utilize

07:12.000 --> 07:18.400
it to end the pandemic and that it is it is well within reach should we choose to see what is in front

07:18.400 --> 07:33.120
of us.

07:33.120 --> 07:46.320
If you think about it, if we're defining vaccine really liberally and these COVID vaccines are

07:46.320 --> 07:50.720
vaccines, the flu vaccine is okay, but actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these

07:50.720 --> 07:57.120
things vaccines and anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within

07:57.120 --> 08:03.760
a year, you know, Canada saying nine months is as actually JJ Cooley's insistence and I think

08:03.760 --> 08:09.760
he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.840
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

08:20.720 --> 08:27.520
People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing. Yeah, I got a nod from Paul

08:27.520 --> 08:38.400
Exander the last couple weeks now and Sage Hana has also been giving me a half tip quite often

08:38.400 --> 08:48.720
which is appreciated. I don't know who Sage Hana is but she hasn't been like he has not been negative.

08:50.800 --> 08:57.680
And has been very helpful and critical when necessary. I don't know what to say other than

08:57.680 --> 09:03.920
I'm happy that there's some sign that we're gaining some momentum. We need momentum. That's for sure.

09:03.920 --> 09:10.640
We definitely need momentum. We're going to get this stuff out there. We're going to need some

09:10.640 --> 09:17.200
momentum because there's no question that the algorithms can give them momentum. There's no

09:17.200 --> 09:23.200
question that that fake censorship can give them momentum. There's no question that these

09:23.920 --> 09:29.440
these algorithms can give them momentum. So what do we do about it? How do we get through this?

09:33.680 --> 09:36.640
I don't know. I think we're doing okay.

09:47.200 --> 10:02.480
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses

10:02.480 --> 10:10.320
is an important element in democratic society. And those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of

10:10.320 --> 10:18.000
society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our countries.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.840
Talking about America there. Ladies and gentlemen, talking about America there.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.680
There are people who won't see this ladies and gentlemen. We're going to have to come to the

10:35.680 --> 10:40.080
terms with that idea. There are people who are not going to see it until we've already won.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.880
That's not going to be possible for everybody to see it.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.040
But there is a critical mass that we can reach into the understanding of the AI

10:51.600 --> 10:58.720
fraud. There is a critical mass understanding that we can reach with regard to how badly we've

10:58.720 --> 11:06.000
been lied to. And I think a lot of these people the video evidence is still available on the

11:06.000 --> 11:13.680
internet. I just got to get people to see it. We just have to get people to be able to see it.

11:16.960 --> 11:23.520
That's tricky because some of them still can't even see the bricks. Some of them see the bricks

11:23.520 --> 11:27.920
and are ignoring them are playing along so that the audience doesn't figure it out.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.760
You know, like when the scenery tips over but then a couple people pretend like they don't

11:33.760 --> 11:37.760
notice it. That's where we're at right now ladies and gentlemen. That's where we're at.

11:39.440 --> 11:44.960
And so some of the people that we're watching and paying attention to are actively pretending

11:44.960 --> 11:51.600
that nothing's going wrong. They're still totally on script. Everything is going as planned.

11:52.640 --> 11:58.480
And in reality that's not the case at all. Ladies and gentlemen, this stream is brought to you by

11:58.640 --> 12:07.280
a patch clamp. Physiologist GigaOM is a resistance rating and applied to the patch clamp recordings

12:07.280 --> 12:13.680
that I used to make as an academy edition. It's GigaOM biological therefore high resistance low noise

12:13.680 --> 12:22.560
information. You can find me at GigaOMbiological.com. I've got to say that we've had really great

12:22.560 --> 12:30.720
outpouring of support. I mean we're getting a few subscribers a day which is really

12:31.600 --> 12:38.080
you know more than I could ever hope for. And he's scrolled down to the bottom of that first page

12:38.080 --> 12:45.920
of GigaOMbiological.com. You can find phone number to leave voicemail and different ways to

12:45.920 --> 12:55.040
subscribe monthly every three months or annually. And this list is a combination of people who've

12:55.040 --> 13:00.560
decided to do one of those things. And if you see names on here more than once then they've decided

13:00.560 --> 13:05.600
to do two of those things or something like that. So there are some people who are pretty extra

13:05.600 --> 13:13.440
committed to this. And me and my family thank them very much. But I got to tell you that if

13:13.440 --> 13:18.320
I'm going to be honest I think we need a lot more because the idea would be to be here forever

13:18.320 --> 13:27.600
or for a long time to keep this going. Because if we're going to win we need to keep this going.

13:27.600 --> 13:33.840
But this information and information related to it needs to be available for the foreseeable future.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.600
You need to support people like me. You need to support people like Mark Housatonic, Mark Coolack

13:40.480 --> 13:48.080
and Housatonic ITS because he's also doing work that I think is indispensable. The archive that

13:48.080 --> 13:55.520
he's built is an archive of information that can speak to how this faith in a novel virus was

13:55.520 --> 14:00.480
constructed over the last 20 or 40 years. The main people that are involved and the people that

14:00.480 --> 14:05.120
you're not hearing about in the news. The people that we're not arguing about. You can hear about

14:05.200 --> 14:10.240
the people who should have done known. Probably already did know that it was a conflated background

14:10.240 --> 14:14.960
single all along. We're going to you can see the history of the people that definitely know that

14:14.960 --> 14:19.120
intramuscular injection made a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune

14:19.120 --> 14:27.120
system is dumb. So you know it's me it's Mark Coolack. It's really only a few people that are trying to

14:27.120 --> 14:34.160
make well trying to make a difference by putting it all on the line. And I will tell you right now

14:34.160 --> 14:40.480
my family has it all on the line. And so all of those people that you saw scroll there a minute

14:40.480 --> 14:47.280
ago are people that are helping fight this mythology by directly supporting give a home biological

14:48.000 --> 14:51.680
so that we can get this kind of information out the kind of information that Jessica

14:51.680 --> 14:57.520
Hockett is trying to get out that Mark Coolack's trying to get out that these people that we've

14:57.520 --> 15:02.960
come to trust because they understand that it's a spectacular commitment to lies that we're up against

15:03.680 --> 15:08.640
and these people that we've come to trust because they understand that the protocols are basically

15:08.640 --> 15:12.640
murdered.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.080
Well that's the wrong number. Yeah wrong knowledge.

15:26.800 --> 15:34.080
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the show. This is Giga Home Biological High

15:34.080 --> 15:38.640
Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist. This is 21st of January

15:38.640 --> 15:46.560
2024. And I'm just going to pause this music over here. We're not going to get too fancy tonight.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.480
I don't know how well that scroll shows up over there. It hasn't been updated in the last couple

15:54.480 --> 16:00.000
days. So those of you that just subscribed I apologize for that. I've had well if you count

16:00.640 --> 16:06.880
my eighth grade sons teams game today then we've had five basketball games this weekend. It's been

16:06.880 --> 16:14.560
pretty tiring and my voice is a little shot but I'm really excited. The boys played really well.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.120
We did lose but they played really well. They played their best basketball. They got their

16:20.000 --> 16:26.240
more shots up, more rebounding, more boxing out. Some of the fundamentals are finally coming.

16:26.240 --> 16:32.000
You know it's strange. It's a sixth grade team but over half of my squad is just basically

16:32.000 --> 16:37.440
brand new basketball players that have had best who run some other sport like football or soccer.

16:37.440 --> 16:43.360
And so it's it's an interesting group of kids that we got and my son's actually playing organized

16:43.360 --> 16:47.280
basketball for the first time and he's he's learning every game and so it's a lot of fun.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.760
That's right. Sorry. I have to switch slide decks here.

16:54.400 --> 17:01.680
So tonight I've got an interesting discussion. I'm I'm I'm curious as to what people are going

17:01.680 --> 17:07.520
to think and how easily people are going to be able to follow along. I do believe at this stage

17:08.160 --> 17:13.120
that the main thing we're up against is the misleading of the young. The young being these

17:13.120 --> 17:19.360
college age kids and maybe even people under 30 that are genuinely trying to use social media

17:19.360 --> 17:27.600
to figure it out. And so even if they stumble their way into a place like Children's Health Defense

17:28.320 --> 17:36.080
or the ICANN network or maybe some of these other things like the FLCCC. Very quickly these people

17:36.080 --> 17:44.000
are going to find themselves coming face to face with Steve Kirsch and Kevin McCurnan or face to face

17:44.000 --> 17:53.360
with some of these other people like Robert Malone or or even someone like Peter McCullough who

17:54.080 --> 17:59.440
although they will talk very candidly about the dangers of transfection and the number of people

17:59.440 --> 18:06.560
that have been hurt they they are very wanted to talk candidly about the evidence of spread

18:06.560 --> 18:13.520
and the potential for this to have been largely a an operation as opposed to a real bona fide

18:13.520 --> 18:20.400
spread of a novel pathogen over the last five years and they're definitely very afraid to talk about

18:20.400 --> 18:28.560
the real biology that underpins it and so over the last few days maybe a week some rather big moves

18:28.640 --> 18:32.960
on the chessboard have been made and I've been kind of just kind of sitting back and and and

18:32.960 --> 18:38.240
trying to figure out what exactly the next move is to be and I think at this stage the best move

18:38.240 --> 18:46.160
is to just let you know what's happening just to try and let you see that we are being manipulated

18:46.160 --> 18:52.560
by something behind the scenes and the manipulation is pretty it's it's pretty obvious if you can pull

18:52.560 --> 18:57.840
back far enough and really take it in I apologize for the heater in the background

18:59.520 --> 19:04.640
and so just for anybody joining us for the first time I know it's possible out of these 66 viewers

19:04.640 --> 19:10.240
it is possible that some of you are joining for the first time the Scooby-Doo analogy basically

19:10.240 --> 19:17.760
suggests that most of the TV watching population of the globe in all languages has been led to

19:17.760 --> 19:23.280
believe that there is a mystery to solve a mystery that involves a spreading RNA pathogen

19:23.280 --> 19:34.880
that may or may not have been leaked or purposefully leaked or come from a badcave and so the mystery

19:34.880 --> 19:42.160
solving has resulted in all of the people who are fooled into solving the mystery they have all

19:42.160 --> 19:48.720
accepted the existence of a novel spreading RNA pathogen and that is actually the magical

19:48.720 --> 19:54.560
enchantment that they would like us to impart on our children they would like us to raise our

19:54.560 --> 20:04.880
children with the history that in 2020 a pandemic occurred and we need as urgently as possible to

20:04.960 --> 20:11.840
try and understand the real biology so that we understand why this is indeed a mythology that

20:11.840 --> 20:17.920
we have been misled and that we need to re-instruct our children about what happened over the last

20:17.920 --> 20:28.800
four years and so the pandemic was created very very concisely and it was created with a lot of

20:28.800 --> 20:37.920
foresight so there were funded scientific programs over the last 20 years which have produced

20:38.800 --> 20:46.000
a primary literature foundation upon which the claim of pandemic potential is based

20:46.720 --> 20:52.080
in other words like I explained in the interview with Wolfgang Wodach if you say to scientists

20:52.080 --> 20:56.880
in academia that there's a billion dollars available for people who look for

20:57.600 --> 21:03.280
self-replicating RNA pathogens you're going to find a lot of people that have a lot of different

21:03.280 --> 21:09.760
ideas about how to show them how to investigate them how to test for them how to measure them how

21:09.760 --> 21:16.560
to quantify them and if you keep funding that research over a period of years you will produce

21:16.640 --> 21:24.960
a primary literature foundation in other words many many papers which have tested a hypothesis

21:24.960 --> 21:34.080
related to a self-replicating RNA pathogen which can then be referenced by any new and ongoing

21:34.080 --> 21:40.240
research that happens in the present and so the longer you fund this research the more

21:40.880 --> 21:47.760
evidence you have in the background that this is a relevant idea and once there's 10 or 15 years

21:47.760 --> 21:56.480
of people finding or measuring or trying to quantify the pandemic potential in mother nature you have

21:56.480 --> 22:03.760
enough literature to claim that there is pandemic potential in mother nature if you combine that

22:03.760 --> 22:10.880
with very clever tabletop exercises over 20 years in all of the major bureaucracies of America and

22:11.440 --> 22:20.560
foreign countries then you have an academia and you have an academia and you have a

22:21.360 --> 22:28.480
a let's say biosecurity state that believes that this is a possibility and then when you finally

22:28.480 --> 22:38.640
decide that you want to do the swine flu pandemic you have an extra dimension that you add because

22:38.640 --> 22:47.680
in the swine flu pandemic there was this problem that when the the shots came out there were 1200

22:47.680 --> 22:54.480
people who got Guillain Barre or got paralyzed in Germany and so the signal was very hot and it

22:54.480 --> 23:00.480
was very unexpected but if you told people that one of the things that might happen very rarely

23:00.480 --> 23:06.240
was Guillain Barre and then you spun it as though a lot of this was rare you might have gotten away

23:06.240 --> 23:12.960
with it and so one of the things that they probably did was change the script and they have been

23:12.960 --> 23:21.120
rehearsing and altering and tabletop working out the script and so this script seemed to involve

23:21.120 --> 23:26.720
seeding mass casualty events at the beginning of the pandemic, misconstruing them as spread

23:26.720 --> 23:35.920
and even more clever they seem to do some things to confound the effects of the novel

23:35.920 --> 23:43.120
spreading pathogen like what Dr. Giordano explained if you confuse them using the internet saying

23:43.120 --> 23:47.840
that wow heart attacks are up people are dying from heart attacks and don't tell them that

23:47.920 --> 23:50.240
EMTs have been told not to resuscitate

23:54.240 --> 24:01.600
and so if you did that in combination with having a bunch of actors that could go on television that

24:01.600 --> 24:08.240
could be available for social media that could go on to obscure podcasts like the Shannon Joy podcast

24:08.960 --> 24:17.760
the giga ohm biological podcast or the Tommy podcast and talk about the worst case scenario

24:17.760 --> 24:25.520
talk about military gain-of-function experiments talk about the worst case scenario as a distinct

24:25.520 --> 24:32.480
possibility then you can really confuse people and get people to buy into this scooby-doo

24:32.480 --> 24:40.000
mystery solving exercise and once they engage in the solving of the mystery they accept the

24:40.000 --> 24:44.400
monster that is the gain-of-function virus that got leaked from Wuhan and spreading around the

24:44.400 --> 24:51.600
world for five years and now if you make some of these people aware that it's a national security

24:51.600 --> 24:59.520
operation that you are helping with the American or the five eyes or or all of the the globe security

24:59.680 --> 25:05.520
you're working for the who you're working for I don't know whatever it doesn't matter what the

25:05.520 --> 25:12.480
guys in the suit say as long as they make you feel important and they tell you that you can't

25:12.480 --> 25:17.680
really reveal that we talk to you you can't really question even if you know that there's really no

25:17.680 --> 25:24.560
virus right now and everything's fine we need to keep this going because of whatever x y z

25:25.360 --> 25:30.880
you'll sell a book and you'll get on tv and everything's going to be fine we just need your help

25:31.760 --> 25:37.760
and there are a lot of people there are a lot of people who are selling a book

25:39.120 --> 25:44.560
who are selling a book and selling that book only they're not summarizing across the whole

25:44.560 --> 25:48.960
narrative and none of them none of them none of them have ever even come close to touching

25:49.680 --> 25:56.240
the possibility that by design the toxicity of the spike that was purported to be founded

25:56.240 --> 26:01.440
Wuhan was confounded with the toxicity of the spike that was put in the transfection

26:03.120 --> 26:07.520
so that they could say that anything that was done wrong anything that went wrong with the

26:07.520 --> 26:12.640
transfection was because we chose the wrong nasty protein which turns out in hindsight

26:12.640 --> 26:17.360
wow surprise hits again a function protein if we had known that we would have never

26:17.360 --> 26:23.040
transfected anybody with it never mind that there was dna in there because we rushed it i mean

26:23.040 --> 26:28.240
oh my gosh so many mistakes but at least in the end millions were saved

26:32.080 --> 26:36.640
early but i want his high morbidity and so i won't play that now but i will read this list

26:36.640 --> 26:41.920
a military response with the ability to drive local mass casualty events so was the military

26:41.920 --> 26:48.480
in new york city making sure that those numbers weren't questioned making sure that anybody that

26:48.480 --> 26:55.120
ran into the fire would be intercepted and co-opted and make sure that they put forth the right narrative

26:57.520 --> 27:03.440
that if if Pierre Corrie left that hospital and went out and told anybody that he would say the

27:03.440 --> 27:09.520
right things that if that doctor that they had on fox news and other places saying it's like hell

27:10.400 --> 27:19.680
it's like hell that he would say the right things this is exactly what dr girdano would

27:19.680 --> 27:26.560
describe as necessary in fact would make it possible to use very small numbers of infections or

27:26.560 --> 27:32.720
transfections to get people to complain and then the rest of it could just be testing on a background

27:32.720 --> 27:38.240
that's already positive co-opt a pre-select group of narrative controllers a combination

27:38.320 --> 27:44.480
of background signals sorry i'll go over here um and oops that's how you do this way you do it

27:44.480 --> 27:50.480
like this first and then that one and then that one and then you're here see um uh financial and

27:50.480 --> 27:56.240
legal incentive to call covet a combination of background signal and non-specific tests as spread

27:56.240 --> 28:02.320
of course coordinated propaganda campaign to drill and confuse drill confusing worst case scenario

28:02.320 --> 28:09.120
that's what we talked about earlier and then an emerging emergency social policies capable

28:09.120 --> 28:14.000
of increasing all-cause mortality so you're going to ignore these two things you're gonna

28:14.000 --> 28:20.320
you're going to tweak knobs in hospitals you're going to institute protocols in hospitals it will

28:20.320 --> 28:27.040
increase all-cause mortality in those hospitals by 15 20 percent everybody that goes on a ventilator

28:27.040 --> 28:33.760
dies that also works and then you're going to convince the public that a lably cover-up is

28:33.760 --> 28:39.120
happening before their eyes what does that do well of course that that that that throws off all the

28:39.120 --> 28:45.840
limits of you know all this stuff that we were talking about at the beginning about i don't even

28:45.840 --> 28:52.560
know if we can make natural immunity to this well that whole potential was based on the idea the hint

28:53.520 --> 28:58.000
that it was a gain of function virus that's the only reason why you would ever assume that oh wow

28:58.000 --> 29:03.840
i don't even know if our bodies can make immunity to this thing isn't that crazy isn't that a crazy

29:03.840 --> 29:13.840
isn't that a crazy thing to say but they said it from the beginning and in october of 2020 they

29:13.920 --> 29:18.640
made up they did a publication with a bunch of names on it that included woolensky

29:22.240 --> 29:24.640
where they said they didn't know if we could make immunity

29:29.840 --> 29:34.960
and now you use these these nations down under one of the things that i didn't realize until a

29:34.960 --> 29:39.760
couple days ago use the allied nations down under the demonstrate lockdowns can work

29:39.840 --> 29:44.320
not only that but make sure that you use them to demonstrate what lockdowns can be

29:46.720 --> 29:51.120
not only use it to show that lockdowns can work because we're on an island

29:51.120 --> 29:57.840
but make sure you show them what lockdowns can be like how nasty politicians can get

29:57.840 --> 30:04.640
how unbelievable lockdowns or or or force quarantine can be what it looks like when

30:04.720 --> 30:08.000
police officers tackle somebody and make them wear a mask

30:10.560 --> 30:12.400
because you couldn't have got away with that in america

30:15.200 --> 30:20.640
but they needed to show us that they needed to show us our intended future

30:21.600 --> 30:27.760
so they use them to do it and at the same time they got this bonus narrative of being able to

30:27.760 --> 30:34.080
say there wasn't a there wasn't a 2020 wave in in australia or New Zealand because we locked out

30:35.600 --> 30:39.600
and you'll find people still saying that Brett Weinstein would probably still say that

30:41.360 --> 30:48.000
and this is all by design you see this was all table topped it was it was gamed out

30:48.560 --> 30:57.680
and altered and gamed out again and that's why we are in our fifth year of this this enchantment

30:58.480 --> 31:05.360
we're in our fifth year of there being a novel virus that killed millions the number is currently

31:05.360 --> 31:11.680
seven around the world seven million people were killed but many more were saved by the billions of

31:11.680 --> 31:18.240
transfections that occurred this virus likely came from gain of function we've put there's no

31:18.240 --> 31:22.240
debating that anymore i mean there's no even not even an art why even argue about it i've got

31:22.240 --> 31:26.080
video after video saying why even argue about it i don't have time to show

31:26.080 --> 31:31.440
why even argue i don't have time to show them all this this is a very special stream

31:36.080 --> 31:41.360
and so they've bamboozled us they've bamboozled us into believing this this gain of function is

31:41.360 --> 31:47.280
possible that this pandemic potential is accessible and that it represents a worst-case scenario that

31:47.280 --> 31:54.800
could do out billions of people on the planet and therefore they're justifying taking away

31:54.800 --> 31:59.360
everything that we consider who we are

32:03.840 --> 32:08.480
and i would argue that these people are involved they are involved even if they got

32:08.480 --> 32:14.560
co-opted before the pandemic and had no idea this was coming and are absolutely appalled at how far

32:14.560 --> 32:20.320
it's gone and holy man i can't say anything because they had me already before the pandemic was even

32:20.320 --> 32:28.640
sprung on me i don't care then they're lying cowards but it's much more likely that they're

32:28.640 --> 32:35.280
just dunces that they just aren't clever enough to know that their ego is right in front of their

32:35.280 --> 32:42.160
nose and so they can't see anything for what it is i don't know maybe they're all liars and they

32:42.240 --> 32:49.120
know it maybe it's actually as dark as it could be maybe they're all like this guy

32:54.240 --> 32:57.200
biblico i kid you not

33:00.000 --> 33:04.640
hell biblico i kid you not

33:05.040 --> 33:11.840
people come in i get intubated they die the cycle repeats

33:13.280 --> 33:19.680
you overwhelmed yeah the the systems overwhelmed all over the place my daughters and intern in

33:19.680 --> 33:29.120
brooklyn first year resident she starts the icn today i couldn't sleep last night it's scary

33:29.200 --> 33:34.960
nine eleven was nothing compared to this we were open waiting for patients to come who never came

33:36.080 --> 33:43.600
okay now they just keep coming and they're all ages don't delude yourself into thinking only

33:43.600 --> 33:52.080
the old will die or we'll get it they're all ages it's incredible hell it's incredible

33:53.440 --> 33:58.640
and they did it on the news with all the people all the virologists all the academics they even

33:58.640 --> 34:03.520
had me on my bike riding around saying it had to be a lab leak and they're covering it up

34:05.040 --> 34:10.160
and because of this wonderful control of the debate and because of the wonderful control of

34:10.160 --> 34:15.360
the local news this fear uncertainty and doubt went on for a very long because of the control

34:15.360 --> 34:23.840
the numbers we didn't have these numbers in 2020 we had projected numbers we didn't have any

34:23.920 --> 34:29.040
information that they weren't resuscitating people in in new york we didn't have any idea

34:29.040 --> 34:33.760
that they were putting people on ventilators and killing them until somebody said it on youtube

34:33.760 --> 34:42.160
but didn't really say it we had nobody absolutely nobody kyle sidel was not saying anything about

34:42.160 --> 34:47.360
the lack of antibiotic use kyle sidel was not talking about the lack of use of any of steroids

34:48.080 --> 34:52.160
he wasn't we weren't even there yet with medazalam and rimdesivir probably

34:52.960 --> 34:57.360
the opioid deaths have gone up every single year of the pandemic nobody cares

35:01.280 --> 35:05.680
the death certificate fraud that went on from california to new york nobody cares

35:05.680 --> 35:11.760
financial incentives that led to it nobody cares the hundreds of companies that went into business

35:12.480 --> 35:17.920
took millions of dollars from the us government to do tracking trace fold calls and shit sorry

35:17.920 --> 35:26.080
excuse me and crap the masks the closures the mandates all the ipads and stuff that they bought

35:26.080 --> 35:34.240
for for schools the pcr fraud the ladder of flow testing fraud i mean come on

35:36.480 --> 35:41.440
you ordered coronavirus tests from china and shipped them to the uk and then delta showed up

35:41.920 --> 35:47.920
really we didn't even have tests in the united states we just had swabs that we had to send to

35:47.920 --> 35:55.280
the cdc i mean are you kidding me they want us to forget about 2020 and 2021 because that was

35:55.280 --> 36:06.400
just two years of bald face lying obfuscation exaggeration and predation on our system draining

36:06.400 --> 36:12.480
the last little bit of value out of our our economy out of our budget out of our government

36:12.480 --> 36:20.960
out of a dollar because that's what this is all about that's why this guy who doesn't talk about

36:20.960 --> 36:27.440
his dad whose brother works for peter teal who's at the head of one of the biggest

36:28.720 --> 36:30.560
weaponized piles of money on earth

36:31.120 --> 36:36.240
and his good friends with some guy he started paint pal with

36:38.560 --> 36:43.600
are involved in manipulating us they are involved in enslaving us

36:45.440 --> 36:49.520
while they pretend that they are fighting for our freedom they don't care about our kids

36:50.560 --> 36:51.760
they don't care about us at all

36:51.840 --> 36:53.840
so

36:54.800 --> 37:00.720
brett weinstein has done nothing to help me in all the years that i helped him and all of the

37:01.520 --> 37:07.360
the tips i gave him all the biology that i taught him he had yuri dagan on his his stream

37:09.120 --> 37:16.160
in 2020 to see the scooby-doo yuri dagan is some foreign medler who is also in the drastic group

37:16.160 --> 37:24.720
on twitter that i was being manipulated by and that's all part of the same charade to make sure

37:24.720 --> 37:30.000
that we all bought in to the solving of the mystery we all got excited about busting them

37:31.120 --> 37:38.160
catching them in their game catching them in the biological clues of the furin cleavage site

37:38.160 --> 37:48.960
and these bad ideas are what trapped us these bad ideas and more importantly these bad questions

37:48.960 --> 37:54.160
that they made us ask we weren't asking the right questions because these people no matter who you

37:54.160 --> 38:00.880
drew out of the deck didn't matter what random five people you chose from here they were not

38:00.880 --> 38:06.880
going to help you escape something about them was going to be so contradictory and something

38:06.880 --> 38:14.560
about them would ignore and you would have this limited spectrum of debate and a very lively

38:14.560 --> 38:19.040
discussion within it that would help you nothing would help your family not at all

38:20.960 --> 38:22.160
i'm sure it's a lab leak

38:25.200 --> 38:32.240
and so they made us confused they made us afraid they put doctors on the tv to say it's hell it's

38:32.320 --> 38:39.600
biblical and then they sent you home and you got on to social media which is basically like being

38:39.600 --> 38:45.040
on this road here and getting picked up by the cars that drive by and no matter what car you got

38:45.040 --> 38:49.440
into they were going to change the way you think and they were going to make sure that you believed

38:49.440 --> 38:56.560
in a novel virus with the potential to kill millions and if these people would just get their act together

38:56.560 --> 39:02.480
and let me use this or that or the other novel treatment we could save millions

39:04.320 --> 39:08.080
i mean it's likely from gain of function the spike protein looks really manipulated

39:09.520 --> 39:14.320
and therefore i mean you know it's getting easier and easier for a biological you know master

39:14.320 --> 39:19.680
student to make a a gain of function virus in their garage according to Robert Malone

39:20.160 --> 39:28.160
and so it doesn't matter this is how it was done they had meetings around the world where they went

39:28.160 --> 39:32.560
to different countries and they met with those people that were dissidents in that country and said

39:32.560 --> 39:39.760
hey we got you thanks for joining us on the stage man your insight into this pandemic has been so

39:39.760 --> 39:44.880
helpful i'm going to take it back to the united states i'm going to put it to good work they've

39:44.880 --> 39:55.200
been doing that for four years these same people these same people have been doing it for like four years how many times have we seen

39:55.200 --> 40:00.560
Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and and and one or more of these other people on stage at the same time

40:01.920 --> 40:07.440
in the last four years all around the world and what have they done they keep spreading the same

40:07.440 --> 40:12.880
news there is a novel virus and millions of people died it's probably from gain of function maybe even

40:12.880 --> 40:26.240
the us funded it and the who is a bad guy not that i like the who but this would be ended in no time

40:26.240 --> 40:33.600
if we just told everybody to close their cdc's and we specifically in america stepped out of the

40:33.600 --> 40:40.320
who because we are a pretty big funder and we closed our own cdc and we stopped our own vaccine

40:40.400 --> 40:44.400
schedule we could just do it we could just end the prep act we could elect a bunch of people that

40:44.400 --> 40:50.560
would strike the get rid of the prep act we could we could fund a bunch of lawyers and and have those

40:50.560 --> 40:58.720
lawyers bring suits for individuals that were injured by the vaccine and bring suit to federal court

40:58.720 --> 41:04.880
have the federal court have to say that no we can't see your case because you have to take it through

41:04.880 --> 41:11.680
the cicp or the vicp and then you as an attorney have to say no that's a violation of my seventh

41:11.680 --> 41:17.360
amendment and then it goes to assert a federal circuit court and gets struck as an unconstitutional

41:17.360 --> 41:24.800
law it could be over in six months the prep act the entire legislative foundation of pandemics

41:24.800 --> 41:32.720
in america could be struck as unconstitutional if we just had an organization or a group of people

41:32.720 --> 41:39.760
that was willing to do it but we don't maybe giggle and biological should do it none of these

41:39.760 --> 41:42.800
people are going to do it they don't even know the words strict liability

41:46.160 --> 41:50.080
they know gain a function really well though and they can tell you all about endonuclease sites and

41:50.080 --> 42:00.480
that kind of thing and so this is how we got here that we were on that road and it doesn't matter

42:00.480 --> 42:06.320
whose car you got into at the beginning of this very lucky if you got into the car with Nick Hudson

42:08.960 --> 42:14.720
very lucky if you got into the car with thomas binder i happened to get into the car with thomas

42:14.720 --> 42:18.640
binder i happened to get into the car with mike eden i happened to get into the car with wolf

42:18.640 --> 42:25.760
gang wodock so i was pretty convinced that this was baloney from the beginning and then i got out

42:25.760 --> 42:32.160
of their car and ended up in the car of kevin mccaren and paul katrel and a but and charles rixie

42:32.160 --> 42:39.120
and a bunch of other people and oh my gosh and drastic now those were some crazy carfuls of clowns

42:40.400 --> 42:46.480
with lots of big ideas about how bad this was going to be how many billions were going to die

42:48.080 --> 42:53.760
and so i doubled i i checked myself i didn't know if i was right or not i noticed that on twitter

42:53.840 --> 43:00.320
sasha latipova changed her uh her little her little uh picture from this very

43:01.360 --> 43:08.080
gentle and sweet uh profile picture here to this one which has a gold jacket on and says work hard

43:08.080 --> 43:15.520
and die rich um that makes me kind of pessimistic about the whole place at this moment but you know

43:15.520 --> 43:20.560
i'm just pointing things out tonight actually i would like to talk about the great kevin mccernan

43:21.040 --> 43:28.240
um he's neither a doctor nor a phd but he is a guy who worked um for the human genome project

43:28.240 --> 43:34.480
which means that he crossed paths with a lot of creepy people um a lot of creepy people without

43:34.480 --> 43:39.440
a creepy ideas back in the day when those creepy ideas were taken a lot more seriously they can't

43:39.440 --> 43:44.560
than they can be in more recent times when we realized that we are kind of approaching that

43:45.280 --> 43:52.720
that that border where the irreducible complexity of understanding how genes work you know and

43:52.720 --> 43:57.440
that kind of thing we're starting to run into that wall again and they've been talking a lot

43:57.440 --> 44:03.200
of smack for a long time about how once we had the human genome sequenced well i mean the world's

44:03.200 --> 44:09.840
your oyster right and of course that's turned out to be nonsense and uh the only thing that they

44:09.840 --> 44:14.560
really have to sell is the idea that it's you can make dna cheaper and you can sequence it cheaper

44:14.560 --> 44:19.760
but you know that doesn't mean that you understand it at all so anyway the reason why i thought it

44:19.760 --> 44:24.720
was interesting to talk about is because every once in a while Robert Malone with his four trillion

44:24.720 --> 44:35.360
subscribers will bless or or um anoint another sub stack with the pleasure and honor of being

44:35.360 --> 44:43.680
restacked and in this case the smoking gun uh the title of uh a kevin mccurnan

44:44.560 --> 44:53.440
sub stack was uh restacked or or promoted by robert melon so big boost um and this smoking

44:53.440 --> 45:01.760
gun is actually about the alex washburn paper with the restriction enzyme sites um and it's

45:01.760 --> 45:11.440
curious because also ark medic wrote a blog about it as well and it's all about emily cops um uh

45:12.640 --> 45:16.800
foyer request for more information about the diffuse proposal and then they got some more

45:16.800 --> 45:24.080
information about communication between the grantee and the grantor or whatever and uh some of those

45:24.800 --> 45:31.760
details are purported to corroborate the existence of and the authenticity of

45:31.760 --> 45:37.920
the diffuse proposal now keep in mind i just want to state first and foremost i'm not necessarily

45:37.920 --> 45:44.880
saying that the diffuse proposal is fake what is a fake proposal if you write a proposal it's a

45:44.880 --> 45:52.800
real proposal if you submit a proposal it's a real proposal but if it was a proposal that was

45:52.800 --> 45:58.880
written specifically to put the methodologies that that the scooby-doo mystery required

46:00.080 --> 46:07.360
to fall into the hands of the dissidents then it could be a real grant proposal about real

46:07.360 --> 46:11.520
experiments that nobody would ever fund nobody would ever do and if you did them it wouldn't matter

46:12.640 --> 46:18.080
which is what i would argue i don't think they're really ready for me to argue that but i don't

46:18.080 --> 46:22.800
think making clones and spraying them into bat caves is going to be a real easy way to start

46:22.800 --> 46:29.040
a pandemic but what they want you to see is that they were thinking about putting fear and cleavage

46:29.040 --> 46:35.440
sites into bat cave viruses and that pewding fear and cleavage sites into them is what makes them

46:35.440 --> 46:43.520
these highly transmissible viruses so just by adding a few amino acids to a protein that isn't

46:44.160 --> 46:46.560
with very high fidelity made in the first place

46:48.560 --> 46:56.880
into a genetic swarm that is the exact opposite of homogenous it doesn't really have the biological

46:56.880 --> 47:02.960
you know the whole biological machinery and and and stuff there to to really make sense so it's a

47:02.960 --> 47:09.440
lot of hand waving but it's exciting because again all the little pieces of the scooby-doo

47:09.440 --> 47:15.680
puzzle are present the fear and cleavage site is it or is it not a laboratory made oh my gosh

47:15.680 --> 47:23.920
look they ordered the same enzymes that Alex Washburn identified as enzymes that could cut

47:24.720 --> 47:32.240
the SARS-CoV-2 virus in certain little segments well isn't that cool i mean that's like saying

47:32.240 --> 47:37.200
that you know these people were making cakes and look we found out that they they ordered flour

47:38.080 --> 47:45.200
and baking soda i mean if you're doing molecular biology and you order a relatively common or

47:45.200 --> 47:53.200
relatively rare restriction enzyme it doesn't mean much especially again it wouldn't be very hard

47:53.760 --> 48:02.480
for them to have for for this to be a thing if they wanted us to really feel like wow this scooby-doo

48:02.480 --> 48:08.080
is really getting solved these are mystery solvers look at these guys go what are they really

48:08.080 --> 48:18.560
doing they're making diffuse real again because when it first came out it was already not real

48:20.000 --> 48:28.400
when it first came out i already said that it wasn't real it was too perfect it was too

48:28.480 --> 48:32.400
perfect and it came out exactly when everybody wasn't buying it anymore

48:34.800 --> 48:39.680
i'm not even really sure it was in the original script i think the original script really needed

48:39.680 --> 48:45.600
just lab leak and a lot of a lot of going along and a lot of people didn't go along

48:48.880 --> 48:52.800
and so i see a very coordinated effort between Robert Malone

48:53.600 --> 49:03.200
Kevin McCurnan a guy by name of Archmetic and Jessica Rose to re-elevate the discussion about the

49:03.200 --> 49:08.240
endo nuclei sites and the diffuse proposal because we got more data now it looks like they actually

49:08.240 --> 49:12.240
ordered the enzymes it looks like they were in having email conversations

49:15.680 --> 49:20.240
and this doesn't convince me at all that any of these experiments were done but even more

49:20.320 --> 49:25.120
importantly it doesn't convince me at all but even if they were done that it would it would

49:25.120 --> 49:30.560
generate any kind of pandemic potential that's the whole point they want you to think

49:31.200 --> 49:38.400
that the debate should be is diffuse real or not did they do the experiments or not

49:40.320 --> 49:44.880
the real debate is is if they made clones and spread them into bad caves what would happen i

49:44.960 --> 49:47.200
would tell you absolutely nothing

49:51.040 --> 49:54.800
and i'm going to tell you i think i've got a really good reason to be confident about this

49:54.800 --> 50:02.400
number one please recall that i wrote my only article for the defender my only article for the

50:02.400 --> 50:12.640
defender on october 29th 2022 with three authors charles rixie myself and robert f Kennedy jr robert

50:12.640 --> 50:19.440
f Kennedy jr was on the phone call until one 30 in the morning charles rixie apparently fell

50:19.440 --> 50:24.320
asleep so he actually didn't write any of this article at all we left him on it i'm not really

50:24.320 --> 50:33.920
sure why and other people were involved the editing team was involved and so i there are

50:33.920 --> 50:38.480
other people who could corroborate this story that charles rixie was on the original start of the

50:38.560 --> 50:43.520
call or he was notified that we wanted to write this article and then he fell asleep

50:44.720 --> 50:48.960
and so when we were calling back and forth about the writing of the article eventually we couldn't

50:48.960 --> 50:53.040
get a hold of him anymore but bobby was on the phone with us until one 30 in the morning

50:55.920 --> 50:57.280
and we talked about clones

50:59.360 --> 51:03.680
and they didn't get into this article but in this article we talk about

51:04.160 --> 51:10.480
endonuclease sites and about the idea that they had their indication that they were making clones

51:10.480 --> 51:14.560
that they intended that it came from a clone and i totally agree with that

51:15.520 --> 51:21.280
of course that's what i've said the only way to work on a coronavirus is to find the sequence

51:21.280 --> 51:28.480
using any number of computational and sequential methods where you have these short sequences and

51:28.560 --> 51:33.920
use an algorithm to assemble them into a consensus coronavirus and then you make a DNA

51:33.920 --> 51:40.640
construct of that using the kinds of technology that kevin mccurnan has probably very lucrative

51:40.640 --> 51:51.760
patinson seeing he's he's had like a couple companies that he's sold for sequencing methodologies and

51:51.760 --> 51:56.640
technologies and so he knows what he's doing and he knows that that coming down in cost is one of

51:56.720 --> 52:02.000
these big sales pitches as to why it is that we're eventually going to crack the human genome because

52:02.000 --> 52:07.920
we can we can read it ever cheaper but that's that's not that's not that's not fixing any problems

52:07.920 --> 52:16.160
about understanding so if you read this one you can see um uh this little analogy here is actually

52:16.160 --> 52:20.880
from me consider how a brit would spell color maneuver a pediatric the choice of how to spell

52:20.880 --> 52:26.880
a word can reveal your native origin similarly these nearly implecable imperceptible changes

52:26.880 --> 52:32.640
in the viral sequence give away the laboratory origins of this virus so this is really like a

52:33.600 --> 52:41.600
a small smidgen of of what ends up in the red book um the wuhan cover up and in this we could

52:41.600 --> 52:46.320
have easily put the clones in this article but it needed to be a shorter article bobby didn't

52:46.320 --> 52:53.600
want to split it in two um and then uh by the time i got hired by i would have gotten hired by

52:53.600 --> 53:01.520
chd only in july of 23 so at this time i was still just a consultant for bobby and just a consultant

53:01.520 --> 53:07.840
for the book so when i wrote for the defender here i was actually not being paid by by the defender

53:07.840 --> 53:13.120
but but as a consultant so hard not by the defender but not by chd but as a consultant i wasn't i

53:13.120 --> 53:21.280
wasn't a scientist then um and then i got hired by chd as a staff scientist in july of 23 and then

53:21.280 --> 53:31.600
i was laid off in january fourth of this year um so anyway the point is is that i also am aware

53:31.600 --> 53:37.200
of this paper i was i was on it the same day it was out and uh i've been paying attention to the

53:37.200 --> 53:43.040
diffuse proposal the diffuse proposal is actually here in this um thing you can see it right there

53:45.440 --> 53:50.720
and so if we go back to this and uh try to kind of discuss what's going on here

53:51.280 --> 53:55.040
one of the interesting things that i was made aware of is that in the

53:59.200 --> 54:04.160
the in the comments um somebody had referenced me or clones

54:05.120 --> 54:14.880
and uh mr kevin mccernan um kind of went off so i'm going to first read his his uh paragraph here

54:14.880 --> 54:21.440
and then i'll try to break it down a little bit um but i'm kind of feeling like hold on just let me

54:21.440 --> 54:31.600
think about this for a second i think i'm going to move this one up here and then i'm going to

54:31.600 --> 54:35.440
keep this going so this will work but then i just moved up a video that i want to watch

54:35.440 --> 54:41.200
after this so i'm going to read this and then i'm going to show you a video that comes from uh

54:41.200 --> 54:49.440
st patrix day i believe a year and a half ago where i explain the clone hypothesis as best i can

54:49.440 --> 54:53.840
to an audience of kevin mccernan jessica rose

54:54.480 --> 55:04.320
stephanie sineff and john bodeman and in that explanation of the clone hypothesis kevin mccernan

55:04.320 --> 55:11.040
and i have a back and forth about the biology and it's very insightful to compare that back

55:11.040 --> 55:16.720
and forth which is really the last time that i would have interacted with him before he eventually

55:16.800 --> 55:19.600
blocked me on twitter for something which i don't really know

55:24.000 --> 55:32.240
so let's read this this is common jj kui bio babble folklore coronaviruses circle the globe

55:32.240 --> 55:40.240
every year there is no reason why an engineered version could not do the same given it was derived

55:40.240 --> 55:43.920
from parts of viruses that have been doing this for millions of years

55:44.560 --> 55:51.600
so so far he's the dinging refers to the fact that he's right on the principles of

55:51.600 --> 55:57.760
virology as written by vince at rancid yellow and others this one right here this two part volume

55:59.120 --> 56:06.560
um in this case someone spent the effort to hyper optimize the covid 19 ace two binding affinity

56:07.120 --> 56:13.680
such that it would spread far and wide that's another very interestingly early on seated narrative

56:14.720 --> 56:21.280
we had this guy patrovsky from australia who published this very detailed analysis from

56:21.280 --> 56:26.800
all different ace two receptors across the animal kingdom and it was like 16 times more

56:26.800 --> 56:29.920
affinity than the next closest one whoa was that nuts

56:33.200 --> 56:42.080
his next squid ink is to claim it could not spread as fast as it did and thus needs to be

56:42.080 --> 56:47.760
seated from clones well that's just that's just completely misrepresenting what i've said

56:47.760 --> 56:53.200
of course i've never said that it couldn't spread as fast i've said that it couldn't spread with

56:53.200 --> 56:54.720
as high fidelity

56:57.680 --> 57:03.360
maybe spreading fast as part of that but it's the high fidelity that i have a problem with

57:03.360 --> 57:09.920
and i'm sure i'm absolutely sure that kevin in his multi-million dollar mansion on the

57:10.000 --> 57:15.200
atlantic coast with his hundred million dollars in the bank with all of his patents i'm sure that

57:15.200 --> 57:22.320
he understands that he is grossly misrepresenting my ideas here and really pigeonholing them into

57:22.320 --> 57:28.560
a tiny little dumb compartment instead of the absolutely monumental possibility space that

57:28.560 --> 57:36.480
they represent that none of these medlers will discuss let's go further into this obfuscation

57:36.480 --> 57:42.320
circus the fault in this logic is assuming the spread initiated when the chinese claimed it did

57:42.320 --> 57:50.000
in 2019 when there is in fact evidence of prior circulation well that's another complete failure

57:50.000 --> 57:54.560
because you know and i know that i've been saying it's a background signal that may even extend

57:54.560 --> 58:00.720
back into in perpetuity the background could signal could be insanely loud for all we know

58:00.880 --> 58:09.120
we have no data from before the pandemic i've been claiming that from the beginning for him

58:09.120 --> 58:14.720
to turn it around and pretend as though the fault in this logic is assuming spread initiated

58:14.720 --> 58:24.640
when the chinese claimed it did prior circulation gives time for it to achieve an endemic state

58:24.640 --> 58:33.600
no kidding really kevin wow what a ridiculous misrepresentation now i'm really curious because

58:33.600 --> 58:37.600
we're going to be able to look at a video that comes from over a year and a half ago

58:37.600 --> 58:44.640
where i explain it to kevin and so i wonder if he has the exact same response that that's that's

58:44.640 --> 58:50.640
kind of dumb because because because i wonder if it's going to be there i bet it's not

58:50.640 --> 59:01.760
so seeding clone hypothesis is chemtrail retarded the most efficient mechanism would be

59:01.760 --> 59:07.680
the package of virus and infect a few people in a city huh so package of virus and infect

59:07.680 --> 59:12.640
a few people in the city do you mean like make um do you mean like make a transfection product

59:12.640 --> 59:18.240
do you mean like virus-like particles what do you mean by that do you mean like lipid nanoparticles

59:18.320 --> 59:25.680
with RNA in them what exactly are you talking about you see how silly this is you see how disingenuous

59:25.680 --> 59:31.440
this is a guy who blocked me on twitter after having been on my stream twice in the last four years

59:34.320 --> 59:41.200
not a doctor or a phd just a guy who sold out very early a long long time ago

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
so

59:44.000 --> 59:48.160
transportation takes care of the rest dropping clones everywhere hoping for a magical

59:48.160 --> 59:53.200
transfection to occur while having an endless parade of spies dropping and spreading these

59:53.200 --> 59:58.640
clones around his keystone cop move when the package virus will perform all of this skull

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.640
doggery for you how does he think that clones and and viruses are different in any of the

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.160
experiments that we've read where they apply the RNA to a cell culture and then take the super named

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.160
how does how does he see that as any different is that not preparing viruses

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.840
is that not preparing very pure viruses i don't understand really this is just being

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.080
this is just being obtuse this is somebody who's pretending to dunk on me but he's

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.840
absolutely exposing himself as a fraud

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.400
leaking the virus provides camouflage and plausible dye and dye and deniability as folks

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.240
question the source for years the keystone cop clone chemtrail hypothesis requires a team

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.520
of covert people and is frankly stupid if you know how to package a virus he wants you to

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:03.600
believe that clones and viruses are different and that if you make viruses they can go around

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:13.040
the world but clones can't do that do you see how awful it is it's an absolute inversion of the

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:20.160
truth that all virology is basically based on making RNA clones any study of a coronavirus that

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:26.000
can be replicated starts from a clone and they apply that clone to a cell culture

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:34.080
cell culture packages it up i guess because they gets their their their machinery hijacked

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.040
and then that supernatant can be applied and used as virus i don't know what he means by

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.560
prepare virus if he doesn't mean that and in fact in the video i'm about to show you he's

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.400
gonna say that he doesn't think that clones are much different than the natural thing and that's

01:01:52.400 --> 01:02:00.960
where he's obviously wrong because if you can make 40 liters of the DNA and then you can use a

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.800
commercial polymerase to change that to RNA what you get in this vat over here of RNA is going to

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:15.920
be a quantity and a purity that is unattainable with whatever he's talking about here packaging

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.680
the virus what let's listen to this video

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.520
your latest video with Paul was amazing JJ really nice compliment thank you very much can you

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:40.400
hear me better now or not nice voice nice voice it was really like it nailed down two things for me

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:48.000
but i finally really understand the infectious clone idea and i think it's very very likely

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.320
what happened it aligns so well with the fact that i don't think anybody has been wrong so far

01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:01.040
it's just nobody had a complete picture and this kind of suits all of these things there was a

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.480
misinterpretation of the real question that was being asked and what people really wanted to know

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.560
is this SARS 2 thing of virus that's the real question not whether or not viruses exist in general

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.920
i mean i think that just got mixed up they get mixed up in there indeed and i think that people

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.600
get yeah they get swept away in that and and it's it's a very much more i think the people that are

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.600
actually misrepresenting the no virus angle and i do believe there are people that are doing it

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.920
are purposefully not curious about what happened they're just sure that say didn't happen and that

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.320
part of it really bothers me it drives me bananas and it's the reason why i don't think

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.520
it makes complete sense that's a perfect segue by the way to go to jj's ideas about the

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:51.680
the infectious clones i mean it's fascinating idea and it makes so much sense it gives credence

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.840
to the they did it on purpose as a biological weapon idea you want to go jj yes thank you i'll

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:04.720
go so i've been active like a lot of these these humans um in trying to get the word out about

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:11.840
basic biology and um i've been kind of focused on learning the immunology again um after having

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:18.480
learned it as an undergraduate as a grad student and trying to figure out where the line of fidelity

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:28.000
in virology is really drawn um and after about a year and a half of this struggle i had my my path

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:35.760
cross uh the path of robert f Kennedy jr and so um since then i've been uh a scientific advisor for

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:43.520
him behind the scenes and a lot of my recent work has been spurred by questions and specifically

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.840
questions about what does what is an infectious clone what do they mean when they say this um

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:56.160
was a question that was posed to me by bobby and over the course of trying to figure out what this

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.080
what the implications of this methodology where i've come to realize that

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:08.000
i think it's possible that um there are more smoke and mirrors than anybody wants to really

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.960
admit um so let me just switch over here hopefully if you have it set to um speaker i can just switch

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:22.000
like this and i can put myself down here in the corner um so let's just go forward and say first

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:28.960
of all they've told you that bat coronavirus is out of a cave um are capable of uh of the verb

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:36.000
pandemic um they're capable of pandemicking um they've also told you that this this ability to

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.560
cause a pandemic or rather the potential to cause a pandemic can be accessed if you take a virus out

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:50.560
of the wild and you passage it successively through a special cell culture or even in some cases a

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:57.840
series of animals um and at the end you get pandemic potential and i'm gonna argue that in fact

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:04.080
they've told you these stories because they don't want you to know the real biology can't support

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:10.880
this idea and their goal is to use a relatively harmless background pathogen to try and coerce

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.880
us out of our individual sovereignty and do a kind of global conversion from you know individual

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:23.040
sovereignty to individual permissions and i think that is going to be achieved if we don't

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.440
make it become common knowledge that these gain of function mythologies are are exactly that

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:37.040
they're largely mythologies so the trick is just think about the the cartoon um that they've told

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.040
you on television which is that when you're infected with a virus you have a bunch of copies of it in

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.800
your lungs and you cough those on your family members and that's how this works because it's

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.920
actually not true more importantly all of virology knows that it's not true they know that there is

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.640
a ratio to be measured between infectious particles and particles which are non-infectious because

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.440
they have a genome with too many errors i'm just gonna stop it for one second to get rid of these

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:11.680
things because they're just in the way seeing genes or missing proteins etc this quantity or

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:18.240
let's say this ratio has been very poorly characterized since it was first recognized

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.320
and in fact you might even suggest that there's been a paucity of effort to characterize this

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.680
i'm going to suggest to you that this would be one of the key things to figure out as we try to

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.640
parse out really what coronavirus infection is and how does our immune system deal with it

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:42.880
i'm going to suggest to you that and my viewers that there's um there's one sort of anecdotal

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.040
story that always gets told about coronavirus as it goes along with this one as well and that is

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:53.680
that it's very difficult to culture them you can read papers about the the Wuhan Institute of Virology

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.680
sampling from hundreds if not thousands of animals and only coming up with a few

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.240
imperfect and incomplete sequences and maybe able to culture one that they get a Sanger sequence

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.560
and this one's considered to be quite a successful expedition and they tell you that's because they

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:15.520
don't have the right culture they don't have the right cell type they don't know how to do it

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.960
but in reality i think it could be related to the the infectious cycle and the fact that they

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:27.760
have misled us about the purity of it and the the fidelity of viral replication to tell us a story

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.880
and the stories that they've told us are these and then i'll be done the first story that you

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.440
can accept is that this is a natural bat cave virus each of these sets of earths is a year

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.520
so at the beginning of the pandemic the bat cave virus was released the following year it was

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:49.440
delta i guess or alpha beta gamma delta i don't know which at some point there was an omicron

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.320
variant which first appeared in south africa that omicron variant also took over the world

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:01.040
and now we're here at some green variant in this model the green earths indicate that the lockdowns

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.600
didn't hurt anybody we can also say that the false positives were were rare we can say that

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.080
novel coronavirus has jumped and caused a pandemic and we can say that we've spent money on gain

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:19.760
a bunch of research and it's all okay in the laboratory bat cave zoanosis story maybe you

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.400
think that the protocols hurt more people so we'll start with green earth but then right away we'll

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.880
turn it to yellow because some of the protocols weren't correct but you still believe that there's

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.880
a virus circulating the earth that came from one point on earth and spread all around you might

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:41.120
even think that omicron is a second release either way you still think there was a virus that circulated

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.320
the earth consistently for three years replicating itself in different lines but always coming back

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.000
to the same variant in this scenario it's the exact same thing we spend money on gain a

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.600
function research novel viruses can jump from nature or from a lab and pcr false positives are

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.360
relatively rare you could also say that there's another scenario where maybe the vaccines are

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.440
hurting people but there was a real virus and the lockdowns worked but all of these still have

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.080
this virus in the background that wasn't there before it doesn't matter where it came from it

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.480
wasn't there before and it's here now the other scenario that's very seductive and sucking a lot

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.440
of people in is the no virus scenario now what if i told you actually i think every person that

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.480
believes any of these scenarios is actually not wrong they're just confused and that there

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:36.720
is a single biological narrative which can explain why the no virus story holds a lot of water

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.400
while the laboratory virus holds a lot of water and the natural virus story seems to hold a lot of

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:50.000
water and that is a previously endemic background if you will recall sars was released or found in

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:56.800
2002 but then there were three more coronavirus leaks from china in 2004 then there was a leak

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.920
from taiwan in 2006 then there was a leak from china again in 2009 and there were at least 484

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:11.760
reported leaks by the cdc in their own reports from american labs so it's likely it's kind of likely

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.160
that there are some sars viruses in the background along with the other endemic coronaviruses that

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.440
are always there so if we make the the initial story that there are a bunch of coronaviruses

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.440
then we can say well we don't know because we weren't unfortunately we weren't testing for them at all

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:38.320
um so anyway imagine that in order to explain how the the the beautiful beautiful signal molecular

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.000
signal is released all around the world it's so uniform that it's actually not supported by

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.240
the RNA biology that we understand that underlies coronaviruses and incidentally

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.640
requires them to make coronaviruses into a cDNA copy in order to work on them in a laboratory

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:05.280
a cDNA copy that makes every virus the same it makes every genome the same in the clone

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.760
and so it's a very convenient methodology that's been around since 1987 invented by

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:18.560
david baltimore and vincent ranson yellow and is a way of making an RNA virus that's almost

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.080
impossible to culture and sustain in a lab sustainable in a laboratory for years

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:32.960
and it's jj sorry yes go ahead are you going to do the cd and tape analogy because that really

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.200
really hit home for me and i think people will would love to hear that analogy because they can

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.280
a relate to it and then be really understand the significance of

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.200
i forgot how much jessica rose helped me out in this talk i was kind of going off onto the

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.760
going off into the ditch there for a little bit talking about trying to get myself back to talking

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:05.440
about clones and what clones are and why they're so interesting to think about that they enable

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:13.200
unculturable very untractable RNA signals to be recreated by using a dna construct

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.800
and in fact i was trying to make the argument that if we've been trying to understand these

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.920
dna and rna ghosts in the wild for a long time and the only way that we've come to

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.120
understand them is using dna clones to create the ghosts and study them in the laboratory

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:35.840
we might we might be creating something that is not really related to nature anymore and it is

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.880
fact a higher quantity and higher purity that can exist in nature and therefore whatever

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:48.320
potential that we're studying is already exaggerated hundreds of fold and so then real danger just

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.200
becomes quantity and the real way that you would get the same sequence in many places is to use

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.320
the clone so hopefully i'll figure it out here and the rest of this and then of course kevin

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:05.120
mccurnan's going to ask questions you know the the lab versus the wild type thing i love you

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.880
for saying it because i cut it out i wanted it to be short but i'll put it in it's only going to

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:14.400
take me two more seconds john forgive me it's such a good analogy so i think it's it's like it'll

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:20.000
drive home what you're saying for people who don't really have the the background thank thank you

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.840
jessica um i owe you one so when they typically get infected they say that the virus is all the

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.880
same right and i've already told you that that's not the case and that that's the reason why this

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.120
story doesn't make sense that it's really hard to culture well if the virus was making perfect

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.720
copies of itself it would be easy to culture but it's not it's making very poor copies of itself

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.000
many of the copies are non-replication competent that makes it difficult to culture coronavirus is

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.920
from the wild the solution that they've come up with is to take that RNA sequence that they find in

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.240
the wild turn it into cDNA constructs that can be grown in high quantities in a bacterial culture

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.320
they can then use any number of ways to convert that cDNA to RNA you don't have to get into that

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.160
now and in fact because we're going to talk with with somebody like kevin mccernan it would be

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.960
really silly for me to try and wax intellectual about all the details of that but the point is

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:18.320
is that when they do this they are able to create a purity level of a single copy

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.360
many many copies of a pure RNA that can't exist in nature because of the nature of replicating RNA

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.600
now the the trick is is that up until now no one has really tried to measure the infectious ratio

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.960
of a coronavirus swarm in an animal or in nature or anywhere else but my guess is it's a lot different

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.880
than one to one or ten to one or even fifty to one the point is is that if you make an RNA copy

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.200
or sorry a DNA master copy you can make lots of copies of the same RNA and you will have

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.480
averted this problem that makes it so difficult to culture coronaviruses from the wild

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.960
so are you suggesting that they're making so you know if you put that infectious clone into a

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.120
million cell you're going to get a very similar output to what um sorry status right the the

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.440
replicated machinery is going to make this really odd array of different expression from the

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:22.640
engine the m gene and this is where he's already getting it wrong he's already distorting it

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.920
right and he did this back then and he he tries to do it all the time but if you make a clone

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:36.560
with a large quantity of pure DNA and then you convert that to RNA you're going to have a quantity

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:46.160
of RNA that when you put it on your cell culture it is more pure and way more pure than anything

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:54.720
that you're ever going to get out of a bat anus in your sampling of bat caves because there you're

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:00.800
going to get a single RNA and a swarm of RNA is best we can tell and when you put that into cell

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.800
culture it doesn't go anywhere in a 96 well plate you might get two plate two wells that show

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.480
psychopathic effects and you might get lucky if you can sequence one of those wells

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:20.000
and then that sequence needs to be turned into a clone and then made into more RNA before you can

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.360
study it and so are you suggesting that you would put these RNAs into cell culture and then they

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:34.400
would make yes and then they would make all the subgenomic RNAs exactly the same as we think the

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:43.120
coronavirus does but he would be starting with a hell of a lot more pure genomes than you would

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:50.560
ever start with from any sample in the wild and so the result would also be much more robust than

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:57.760
anything you would start with in the wild and so the idea that a clone is the same as what you

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:06.160
find in the wild is only true if you think one molecule to one molecule and you buy their entire

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.080
cartoon which is that this molecule has to translate itself into a bunch of subgenomic RNA templates

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.600
and only every once in a while makes a copy of itself but then it still needs to make a copy

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.240
right it's got to be positive stranded so I don't know if you're aware of that they need to make a

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.760
negative strand then that negative strand needs to be copied again and the positive strand needs

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:40.320
to be packaged in the new virus so we're really getting close here to exposing this for for the

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:47.920
sham that it is because this is not a valid argument what he's calling a a chem trail retarded

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.520
it's he's not calling it chem trail retarded here

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.720
because it has to right if you want to actually stoichiometrically put one genomic piece of

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.560
DNA or RNA into a capsid you have to make like a hundred to a thousand spikes a hundred to a thousand

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.720
you know end proteins envelope protein so so they're going to express a lot more that junk at the

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.680
end of the molecule just to make that assemble correctly are you suggesting that that to do an

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.240
infectious clone release you'd have to like take the clones grow them in a co-lide like they're

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.560
doing through the vaccines and then purify them and then make a lot of t7 like RNA off of it and then

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.200
infect people with the RNA somehow because in that case it would be it would be linear it all be

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.000
one molecule it wouldn't be all diced up and having this this different type of um expression

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.920
profile that we see in nature right so that would be kind of my point is that if you did that you

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.880
would have a an infectious but it would still work the same it would still need to make an RNA

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:56.720
dependent polymerase and all the other replicates uh cooperative proteins in order to copy itself

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.200
all the the cartoon of coronavirus doesn't change because we make a clone of it

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:10.480
I mean I'm just playing the game here he's the one who insists that coronavirus circle the globe

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.560
every year and that we've made coronaviruses that can do it because we're using parts that have

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.040
been circulating the globe for millions of years if we're gonna work on that assumption then come

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:27.280
on let's be honest do you see do you see how crazy it is that this guy pretends he can't understand

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:33.760
the difference he's supposed to be a guy who didn't do his PhD or his MD went right straight to the

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:48.880
human genome project he was so sharp clone would be and not an accurate representation of what

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.160
SARS does when it's on its own and so if they released a large even a small quantity

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.480
of an RNA infectious clone with the identical molecular signature in these different places

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:06.720
that all of this symptomology and all of the molecular signals would line up perfectly

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.920
for a brief period of time while the clones purity was pure enough for that to happen

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:19.760
yeah so I mean I'm with you that this this allowable like two by five opinion card and Wuhan versus

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:25.200
wet market is ridiculous right like but that's not when it started and all they had to do is like

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.120
turn on the PCR lights if you will and you can start seeing patterns of viruses moving through

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:37.040
the population and they could have done this on HQ HKU1 if they wanted to just by simply looking

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:43.600
in ringing your arm bells I wonder if they could do it with primers that weren't specific for any

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.040
particular RNA signal I wonder if they could tell us they were looking for an N protein when really

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.440
they were just looking for a signal they knew was already there do you see how easy it would be

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.920
we're already there he's already agreeing with me here he's not he's not opposing any of this

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:06.160
where's the chemtrail retarded part this is a year and a half ago

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:14.400
did I catch him off guard where's the chemtrail retarded part here

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.280
I guess what I'm trying to see is like how is the infectious clone RNA expression different

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.280
than what the virus does because when I when I see that I'm like it's the same polymerase

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:37.040
making the same errors making the same yeah so it's starting with a giant quantity of pure DNA

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.960
what part of that doesn't he understand I hope I explain it right here

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.600
oh the problem is though think about it and this is the way I think about it so I'm yeah I would

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:57.840
love you to help me think better if if if the best case scenario was you took an infectious clone

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.120
and put it on an airline and everybody on the airplane or everybody in the room had it then you

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:08.080
put them all on different airplanes wherever they landed that infectious clone would still go off

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.960
now in a relatively random direction in my imagination yeah rather than all going to delta

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:20.320
than all going because these are all different chains of infection it's not like so the only way

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.280
that it Italian doctors for the first month could have measured the same sequence as people in

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.040
in Seattle as if the people that got infected were infected with the same clone otherwise there

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:36.640
would have been a molecular difference because we saw that in the first SARS between every patient

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.440
oh between SARS one you're saying yes there's so much divergence between

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.040
does SARS one have the same I'm it must have the same error proofing a lead a champ baby I think

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.200
it sure does it's a long gene I mean it's a long it's a long genome so therefore it's

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.400
I mean the air rates I've read on that there's something like one in 10,000 maybe one in 100,000

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.560
when there's an exon engine in there and then I it wasn't reading the it seemed pretty similar to

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.840
human R&AP human R&AP is what if you put this clone inside of a human cell the first round of

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:15.040
making the template RNA off the clone is going to be from probably RNA polymerase or R&AP and

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.160
that has an error rate of like one in 100,000 but then after that's made SARS starts doing its

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:26.400
business and RDRP takes over which has an error correcting polymerase which ends up being almost

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.880
in the same ballpark it's a little bit a little bit more noisy than the human one but but it's only

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:37.360
that one cycle of making human R of going off the clone into making human RNA after that it's

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.200
going to be the machinery it's going to get read by the ribosome and then all the expression is

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.120
going to change you're going to start getting too much N protein I shouldn't say too much just

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:52.560
more and protein more and you know envelope and whatnot so I don't know how the mutation spectrum

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:59.440
changes going this way you know but I don't think it did my argument is the mutation spectrum is

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.560
being chosen from the background of SARS viruses they're already there that's why Omicron was

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.880
present the whole time they just brought it up when they decided to cause like target failure

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:16.000
a real so wait I thought he just dunked on me a minute ago on January 19th of 2024 I just thought

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.440
he dunked on me saying that yeah but the big assumption that Jay says is that it didn't spread that

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.240
fast and therefore it had to be there earlier but the easy explanation is it was already endemic

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.560
don't you see how disingenuous it is can you not see that he's actually I don't know how to use

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:45.120
any other word then he's a liar he's lying in that in that comment answer that he posted on his own

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.880
sub stack about my idea and what he understands about it he completely misrepresented it

01:25:52.960 --> 01:26:01.440
here I am explaining it to him live on rumble a year and a half ago I'm explaining it to him

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.400
it's the third time we've been live together

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:18.320
it's absolutely disgusting this man is worth a hundred million dollars and he's attacking

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.640
somebody who's got kids and no job and I'm renting this house

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.560
and he's spending his time he was spending his time attacking me on twitter until he decided

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.880
to block me he's spent his time sending complaining letters about me

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:47.760
a guy who lives on the Atlantic Ocean in in in Boston has spent an exorbit amount of time

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:56.880
trying to ruin and defame and slander somebody who streams out of their back of their garage

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.000
with a thousand three thousand subscribers are you kidding me how can you not see how

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000
diabolical how malevolent it is that this grad school dropout

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.880
is wasting his time actually actively ruining my family's life

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:27.840
I think I dunk on him here a positive right right right so there is no evolution and DARPA is

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.040
controlling these sequences it's not like it's an open source database that that random sequences

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.680
can be thrown into my argument is the mutation spectrum is being chosen from the background of

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.480
SARS viruses they're already there that's why omicron was present the whole time they just

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.400
brought it up when they decided to cause like target failure a real a positive right right right

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.080
so there is no evolution and DARPA is controlling these sequences it's not like it's an open source

01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.880
database that that random sequences can be thrown into you mean the g said yeah yeah maybe yeah

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.480
there are there are several million like six point seven or something in ncbi which is more

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.880
open source but I don't know how quickly they get there they may not be as real time as g said

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.760
all right go on so I interrupted no no you didn't interrupt at all was perfect interruption actually

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:23.760
it was very helpful um so so keeping in mind what Kevin just said um that yeah that um

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:32.640
that I'm there is some difference between RNA and DNA and the the most important thing for my model

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.880
is the idea that DNA can be accurately copied into much larger accurate quantities

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:45.760
relative to RNA you can make a lot of RNA if you start from DNA but if you're making copies of RNA

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:52.480
using the traditional viral proteins that do it there's going to be a certain walk that occurs

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:57.360
that doesn't necessarily have to occur if you're on a molecular bench using the state-of-the-art

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.080
molecular techniques that have been invented by Kevin McCurn and other people DNA is very

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:08.080
high fidelity what that means is is that we can kind of think about RNA viruses as being like a

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:13.120
mixtape so if you remember making a mixtape for your girlfriend it's a tape that's derived from

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.200
original albums that you bought at the store that are of the highest quality when you put

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.080
them on the mixtape they lose a little bit of quality but they're not too bad the problem is

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.600
is that fear they can't make a copy of that because then there will be too much hiss too much noise

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.040
you won't want to listen to it in your headphones and if you turn it loud in your car it'll smell

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:38.000
like garbage but CDs fixed all that suddenly CDs once we could copy them we could we could

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.520
share albums with people and sharing the album you could even make a mixtape and share it with them

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.600
because you didn't lose the fidelity with each copy that you did with this mixtape so my argument

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:57.200
is is that if they've tried to study what is essentially an imperfect genetic pathogen or

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.800
something like that and they've tried to study it by first modeling it with a perfect copy

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:09.920
and this has resulted in a whole field of science there's no question about it that you can study

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.920
the natural sequences by making a synthetic version of them and then putting them in cell

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:21.840
culture in large quantities using electroporation or something like that the the the particles that

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:27.520
are produced will cause animals to get sick they will cause antibodies to to neutralize them they

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.480
will even be shareable with people around the world but the trick is to realize that it is a

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:39.200
horrible approximation of the natural infection and because of this we can look at what I think

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.560
we can look at what happened in this pandemic and come to a conclusion that maybe it might not have

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:51.280
been the story that they say so if you think of it this way a real simple explanation for why

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:59.840
the molecular pattern was so uniform is because on a background of SARS viruses which is depicted

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:07.680
here they released in some places around the world a brief bout of an infectious clone so that all

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:14.160
the molecular signals would be the same and then now they just go forward as the clone disappears

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.360
they just announced new sequences they just omit the ones that don't fit they might have even already

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:25.360
known what the background was before they started the show but the reason why this is cool is because

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:31.520
now the no virus people aren't crazy now the molecular biologists aren't crazy now even debunk

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.160
the funk is not crazy for saying the PCR is pretty accurate when you have nested primers

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:43.040
and this all lines up a bunch of things that can make people that are that seem to be very

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.640
zealous about the thing that they understand actually write and if we could sort of get people

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.880
to just think in this direction i'm not saying i'm correct but i'm just saying that maybe a good

01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:02.640
goal is to find a hypothesis that gets more of us to agree on on the biology think about how dangerous

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:08.320
what I was saying there was and the reason why when I said all this stuff I was also asked to write

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:17.920
a letter for CHD to the no virus people to explain what I thought what what these clones made possible

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.600
was the illusion of a pandemic so that all of us could be right that all of us are fighting

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.960
about things that we don't understand and I wanted people to be able to come together on this idea

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:36.960
just as i'm saying here a year and a half ago and instead what happened the no virus people

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:43.840
trashed the idea kevin mccurnan eventually blocked me on twitter and now calls me kem trail

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:55.760
retarded kem trail retarded i'm not sure how much more is left so i think i'm gonna let it play

01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.760
but we might be done or any that's that's where i've been thanks for for pushing me to add that

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:09.280
a little bit Jessica that was great yeah so for for people who who are have brains like me

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:19.440
um maybe they're wondering uh in your um from your point of view is there a way to prove this

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.880
yeah i i'm sorry i thought i was directed at me no i was directed at me and i was puzzled

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.120
sorry i'm just okay kevin please i thought for something that i yes please we want to

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.160
we want to know the background like what is the mutation rate of like hku one or seasonally

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:41.200
because um you know is that in fact mutating so quickly such that it can arise from a point source

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.720
or is it different than the mutation rate that we're seeing in in cv's right because

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.200
the i think the premise of what you're saying jj is that um the mutation rate should not make it

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.560
there shouldn't be these homogeneous waves of different variants from from alpha delta gamma to

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:02.080
omochron uh to take over the world uh what seemed to be at a too quick of a rate is that my my

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:07.200
summarizing that correctly yeah i i think it's part of it yes definitely it implies a level of

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.560
fidelity that i don't think can exist there should be more branches um okay all right so so yeah

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.040
i guess to try to tease that apart we have to because the one thing that's going on Jessica is that

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.600
we turned on massive scale PCR and sequencing surveillance for the first time in human history

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:28.400
and viruses in in 2020 right so we don't really know what this looked like in 2019 and did we were

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:33.840
we seeing waves of these things that were just not there that we couldn't see right um and that

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:39.600
may in fact be the case that um you know that that may give us some some some idea of what the actual

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.960
viruses look like naturally yeah we might need some we might need some data spectrum we might need

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:51.440
some data might be nice to have some data yeah i i think the the area that will you'll you'll

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:57.680
probably meet some pushback maybe the virologist field maybe the the ransanellas and um i probably

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.400
shouldn't speak for them but i think i think that you know they would probably say okay there's no

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:09.280
reason to believe the mutation rate of the clone is necessarily more stable than um then the virus

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.960
mutation rate unless unless it is that you actually are like you're launching alpha delta gamma in

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:20.320
multiple cities at the same time with uh with the clones uh to to make these radical changes

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.400
um and maybe that's that's you know part of what you're suggesting but um they would probably

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.440
argue that if you put a clone into us into into a million cell its mutation spectrum is going to

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:35.360
be much different once you get into the RNA world because the first step is i agree if you replicate

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.240
the DNA it's got high fidelity it's like one one error in a million right but the moment in

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.920
RNA polymerase hits that thing you're you're already kicking off at like 10 to the minus

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.880
fifth 10 to the minus fourth error rates uh and that's not much worse than the virus but there

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.080
he's saying it again if you do the DNA you can make lots of DNA high fidelity but then when you make

01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:00.720
the RNA it's going to be a little shoddy that's totally true but you're making RNA from a perfect

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:08.160
DNA template over and over and over again when the virus replicates when you get a virus out of an

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.320
animal and you follow the cartoon instructions you take that virus and you grow it in a cell

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:24.320
culture so it starts already in a in a in a state of purity with a clone that cannot cannot

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.040
exist in nature and in fact is scalable because it all depends on how much DNA you make first

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:42.320
and it doesn't seem to be possible that he's able to ignore this but he is he's able to ignore that

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:50.240
DNA allows it to be scalable to commercial sized RNA production just like they made the shots which

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:57.680
is what he said earlier i'm sorry i just find this extraordinary i can't i'm having a hard time

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.560
understanding how it is that he ever thought that he could write such a comment like that without

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:10.000
this video this video existed already like we had this conversation a year and a half ago it's so

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:19.200
incredible that i would have a dream job

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:33.920
and lose it because i'm telling the truth about robber Malone about other medlers

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:41.200
who don't have the right to take off the uniform after three decades of working for them

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.680
and claim that this is you know a mistake

01:37:48.960 --> 01:38:00.160
and i have asserted that this person is playing the DNA contamination card exactly as they want

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.840
it to be played and that is his job right now other than apparently also to ruin the life

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.480
of a family of five in Pittsburgh

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.640
to interfere with a business relationship of mine to the extent to which maybe he played a role i

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:29.680
don't know i do know that he he tried and why because because some unemployed biologist in

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:36.080
Pittsburgh was saying some bad things out of stream on twitch that nobody watches no

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.840
because i was suggesting that there was a biologically plausible explanation

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:51.600
that would allow a national security state to execute the most amazing psychological operation

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.960
and convince everybody to solve a mystery about a spreading pathogen

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:03.120
and by solving that mystery they would teach their kids that that was a potential forever

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:10.320
and we could be governed by that mythology and i cannot imagine that he does not understand the

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:16.720
idea that i'm trying to explain to him better and that he just missed the opportunity to say that

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:24.240
this was chemtrail retarded a year and a half ago i don't think that's the case i don't i don't

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.600
think that's the case is it a year and it might only be a year ago it might have been just last

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.400
year so you know nine months ago ten months ago he's not missing the opportunity here ladies and

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:45.600
gentlemen there was no opportunity it's a fabulous idea and the idea that this recombinant there's a

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:51.600
there's an accessory protein that causes proofreading and coronaviruses is belied by the fact that

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:57.760
denizen himself the guy who found it mark denizen also stated that this increases the recombination

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:04.480
rate of coronaviruses during co-infection recombination will almost always result in a bad thing in

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:13.040
terms of making a full genome copy we're still hand waving a lot about what happens when a

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:19.280
positive stranded RNA virus goes into your cells and then translates itself into a negative strand

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:24.960
and subgenomic RNA and a negative strands that still can't go through your ribosome

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:37.840
i'm gonna let it play it's not very long left i'm just shocked i'm shocked so that they can both

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.920
start making errors it sounds like what you're suggesting is maybe there's the possibility of

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:49.760
someone seeding a consensus through dna first yeah and and that's what is maybe being used to

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.760
make the pcr systems like have s gene dropping see and that's the thing it can be both you can use

01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.360
the RNA to transfect people you can use the RNA to transfect people with a spike protein that

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.200
will annoy their lungs you could you could use the dna that gets left over from that process because

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:13.840
there will be dna left over from that process and just dump it in the sewer and if you dump that

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.520
huge quantity of clone dna into the sewer every time you do it you get you get you get dna signals

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:28.480
in the in the sewer it's super easy you get both from this process you get the dna that you use

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:34.080
to make quantity then you get the RNA that you derive from it but the dna doesn't get destroyed

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.400
in that process it's still there you can send that dna all around the world don't you see

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.560
and spraying that dna might not make you sick but it will make a pcr positive it'll make the

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:58.160
the the surfaces of a screw ship positive i mean it's just absurd it's not keystone cop chem

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:06.160
trail retarded it is most likely how it was done and i think that they all know it oh darn

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.040
did i just hit escape shoot okay i gotta go and do that again sorry about that your latest video

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:19.120
with paul was and that's not much worse than the virus uh so that they they can both start making

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.960
errors uh it sounds like what you're suggesting is maybe there's the possibility of someone

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:30.640
seeding a a consensus through dna first yeah and and that's what is maybe being used to make the

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.360
pcr systems like have s gene dropout and and and sort of be chasing its tail

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.440
yeah maybe that is i mean again i'm i'm still trying to work through this too the the most

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:48.720
important thing that the infectious clone idea came brought to me is an understanding of how

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.720
i mean it's so ubiquitous in virology you can't believe it and i mean almost every

01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:01.760
paper starts with an infectious clone and so it's it's the only way to study RNA viruses

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.200
yeah indeed it's it's the storage system like everyone puts things in plasmids stores them and

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.200
you can ship them around the world they're stable that's that's the way you mail these things around

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:16.400
no doubt because it's uh it's uh it's it's it's a high-sability storage system we can i ask one more

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.600
thing before i'm no i'm taking up too much time but the EXON gene which you were saying is

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:27.680
appropriating gene was also reported by um barrack and denison to be responsible for recombination

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:33.920
and i've been wondering if the homology of the end protein the homology of the RNA dependent RNA

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:41.040
polymerase but the non homology of the spike could be that instead of tracking a virus we

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.600
should really be thinking about tracking the remainder of this toxic spike as it recombines

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:51.200
with other coronaviruses in the swarm does that make sense to you at least yeah yeah so part of the

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:57.280
reason they think that evolves is that um viruses that are this long that don't have like typically

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.680
viruses like the flu have multiple segments of the genome that can recombine and that that's

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:08.240
part of its evolutionary adaptation coronavirus is being 30 kb long don't have recombination

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.800
capability with the with the same strain per se you want them to recombine with something else

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.880
to get that and so the exon engine has made it really accurate at a single nucleotide level

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:22.080
so they can make a 30 kb piece of RNA but one of the tricks it evolved is to be able to recombine

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.680
with other coronaviruses uh so that it it can it can actually accommodate some of what it's missing

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.320
compared to flu um now i don't i don't know what that means in terms of the swarm theory other than

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:38.320
i think we we we may have a harder time tracking that uh you know the the the thing to keep in mind

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.680
is when they when they are doing a lot of this PCR to track uh all the viral sequences um they

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.400
have like a hundred different primer pairs and they're redundantly tiling the genome so they should

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.360
be capturing some of that i just don't know how effective they're getting it all right and one

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.880
more question can they can that recombination result in in in non-infectious particles because

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.760
it's like absolutely yeah yeah i'm sure it does yeah in fact i bet most of them are are dead ends

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.160
like you like you like you mentioned i also think inside the cell when it's actually churning out

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:13.440
all this RNA um not all of those are going to end up in a in a perfect particle with one genome and

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.280
all the right proteins you're going to end up with all the shrapnel that's misassembled uh that has

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.480
just maybe sub-genomic RNA and goes nowhere um so i just don't know that if you put an infectious

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:28.080
clone into a cell that it doesn't anything different i think in fact i think you you need those genes

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.720
to be expressed at different levels to get proper assembly of the of the virus because it's not like

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.360
one spike protein per one dna it's like a hundred to a thousand spike proteins per one piece of

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:43.760
of RNA genome so it needs to have that imbalance of expression in order to build the capsid correctly

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.680
i saw but i doubt that it's a hundred percent efficient where it's putting these all together

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.520
like an assembly line and doesn't leave any parts aside i bet i bet it's somewhat random

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:57.760
and build some some just you know some uh some uh unproductive he doesn't want to say exesomes

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:05.120
unproductive very awesome i i i i'm really happy thank you unproductive viriums is not what it was

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:13.760
right it's not so what's going on here this is common jj kui babble folklore coronaviruses

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:24.080
circle the globe every year hyper optimizing the receptor binding domain equals spread i thought

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.920
it was the fear and cleavage site that caused the spread i'm i'm confused because in this one

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:35.280
he says that they hyper optimize this coven 19 ace two binding affinity so that it could spread

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:41.040
far and wide i'm sure that that was the receptor but it wasn't the receptor binding domain affinity

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.560
but it was the fear and cleavage site that made it spread so fast that's what james lion's

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:53.840
wiler said that's what yuri dagan said that's what bret weinstein said

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.720
it couldn't spread as fast that's not at all what i said i said that it was endemic a long

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.680
time ago from lab leaks and other stuff or just background is what i think it is now there's not

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:15.920
no reason to give them circulating viruses if they haven't proven it and then that task are on that

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:23.600
note i agree with the no virus people completely assume the virus originated in 2019 i assumed

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:30.640
that it was it's an endemic signal from long long ago again he's he's completely misrepresenting

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:38.320
what he had a personal presentation of and reacted to and discussed

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:46.560
prior circulation is claimed by him in this thing even though he just got through hearing

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:54.880
me explain to him that that's exactly my idea seeding clone hypothesis is chemtrail retarded

01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:00.400
and again he didn't say that in that interview at all in that discussion at all sounded pretty

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.360
plausible to him

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.080
infect a few people and transfect a few people he says giro dano says i said he never said that

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.320
and certainly not said it that's my idea like what what's wrong with it

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:26.240
keystone cop clone chemtrail hypothesis can't keep in mind how ridiculous it is for him to say that

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:35.440
not leaking the virus is better so he's sustaining the the the novel virus narrative that a virus

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:43.760
can go around the earth and a clone can't i suspect that's what mccair and and rixie were on about

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.400
when they went on matthew crawford stream that they were going to try and make this silly argument

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:54.080
and absolutely positively all the time that this guy spends on the internet

01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:01.440
when he could be starting companies he spends his time with absolutely no mention of what

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.360
excess deaths can tell us no mention of the lack of of evidence of spread the jessica hocket and

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:14.720
jonathan angler and martin niel are showing that daddy rancor has found evidence of no math at all

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:22.880
about what protocols have done nothing nothing zero just weed genetics and viral genetics that's

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:32.240
it that's all he does at least jessica still cites me at the bottom of this very very bottom of this

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.360
2022 october

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.720
sub stack where she says by the way a massive thank you to can you see that massive thank you to jonathan

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:49.040
cooey matthew crawford john bodeman and mark jeera doh for the thursday night chats

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.800
what are those chats do you think those are the steve curse steering committee

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:06.880
basically what i did was spend my days correcting their nonsense and making sure that they were

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:14.720
staying on immunology 101 in light of the fact that although jessica has it on the top of her

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:20.560
her twitter that she is a computational biologist what is it

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.760
it's uh where is it darn it now i screwed it up

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.400
it's like 10 different things though um

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:43.520
it's a applied mathematician immunologist computational biologist molecular biologist

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:51.840
biochemist musician writer and logger i think logger means surfer but anyway it's jj's idea

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:59.200
and after our conversation last night i dreamed only about clones it was like a matrix of puzzle

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:02.960
pieces were floating around the dark matter of my subconscious waiting for me to put them

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:07.680
together i didn't manage to yet but this hypothesis of an engineered clone makes a lot of sense to me

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:17.600
she's still got a show with chd she can still do programs with them i was ever never actually

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.400
offered a show i think i was somebody asked me if i wanted to do it and they they said not right now

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:32.720
it's fine they hired me to do more important things um but i'm definitely not confused by

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:38.400
this okay this is what i thought he would do this is what i told everybody he was doing before

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:46.320
anybody believed me that he was doing it that every time he came at me with more objections

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.120
to the clone hypothesis i was already well read enough to argue back that's what i walked him into

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:57.440
in that video i walked him into that that's a denizen mark denizen papers that establish the

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.520
proofreading in coronavirus i walked him right into that question

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:07.920
first i made him say yeah combination happens all the time it makes him really good and then

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:12.400
i said yeah but doesn't recombination a lot of times result in dead end so yeah i does sure it

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:22.000
does yeah absolutely and so we kept circling back to the infectious cycle cartoon being horribly

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.760
wrong the infectious cycle cartoon is horribly wrong and the way you overcome it is to make a

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:34.720
lot of pure RNA and he just didn't want to see it he doesn't want to understand it because it's

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:39.680
his job not to understand it or to make sure that the people that are listening have the least

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:45.120
likelihood of understanding it when he's around and that's what this is about that's why you call

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:52.000
it chemtrail retarded and make it seem like all the the ideas that make sense are his

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:58.080
even though none of the ideas in this whole paragraph are his they're either tv narrative

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:04.560
about ace 2 affinity or they're my clone hypothesis being made fun of but not really being made fun

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:11.360
of at all just being misrepresented this is a guy that's sold companies this is a guy whose

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:18.000
brothers have cancer companies this is a guy whose family is probably worth 250 million dollars

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:26.400
this is a guy who's got a house that's worth more than my entire ancestry owns

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:30.560
and he spends his time ridiculing me

01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:38.240
a guy who just got laid off after six months of working for chd who's supposed to be this

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:42.560
organization that would support a guy like me and help get this truth out

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:49.600
one of the reasons why i got in trouble at chd was because i covered a podcast

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.600
where two members of chd interviewed this guy and i criticized what he said in the interview

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:06.160
and i tried to protect the two people from chd from him and i was reprimanded for it

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:18.880
so somewhere in the upper echelons of this theater are people in every single spot that need to be

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:25.680
there and that doesn't mean that chd is a bad organization it doesn't mean that i can is a

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:30.240
bad organization it doesn't even mean that the people that are working for steve kirsch are bad

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:38.880
people they are being misled and it only takes a few people in a tug of war to sabotage a team

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:46.400
and it's really easy to fake helping in a tug of war and that's what this is if you set up

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:54.400
to argue about this stuff if you start pulling on the rope that they offer you you're already

01:54:54.400 --> 01:55:01.120
playing along and you start pulling harder and you put all your energy into the rope in the

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:06.560
meantime they've already stopped pulling they're letting you do it all because that's what they

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:12.800
wanted you to do and that's why i've been ignoring kevin mccurnan for the last six months because

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:18.640
that's what he wants me to do he wants me to argue about this stuff but we already argued about it

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:25.200
a year ago and he lost and now he's turning around and make it seem like that conversation

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.640
never happened i hope you will review what we just listened to to see how obnoxiously

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.040
disingenuous this paragraph is

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:43.600
and how damaging it could potentially be to my family and what other things that he did behind

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.800
the scenes what other emails did he write what other kind of crap is going on

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.600
quite frankly i wouldn't be able to be in the same room with this guy without needing somebody

01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:02.080
to be between us so i'm a real skinny wimp but i would put all of my power behind it i'll tell you

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:10.000
what because this is really this is really nonsense this is really malevolence

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:20.080
you can't see this as two people struggling to save the world you can't see this as two people

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.880
struggling to get out the biological truth of the pandemic

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:38.240
and it was all to make diffuse real again melon cooperating with with mccurnan cooperating

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:44.880
with ark medic cooperating with jessica rose all selling the same story that lo and behold look

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.160
at this the endo nuclease sites that we thought we found a few months ago it turns out they ordered

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:56.880
the right enzyme for them it turns out they were sending emails discussing this stuff see it's

01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:06.480
obviously true it's all a charade to make diffuse real again and it was never real and it was never

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.320
a real danger you don't if you make clones and spray them into back caves you're not going to

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:16.080
get a pandemic just like if you make clones and you spray them in a few cities around the world

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.840
you don't get a pandemic you get a signal that you can test for a little while for

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.000
and so if you test right you could you could you could confound it and that's it

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:37.520
and the diffuse proposals and elaborate ridiculous comic book level scheme that's supposed to imply

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.920
that they already did the experiments duh they put fear and cleavage sites in man

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:56.560
you got to make RNA real again we need to make RNA and what it can and can't do for itself real

01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:03.920
again and we need to make RNA clones real again real like we understand what they are what they do

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:10.880
how pure they are how ridiculously unequal they are to whatever we can possibly identify in nature

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.360
the foundation of all the objections of the farewell to virology document and all the

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:24.240
subsequent discussion is about this RNA clones overcome whatever nonsense

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:32.640
is the biology that results in psychopathic effects and lack of pure sequences this is all

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.240
covered by this illusion here

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:48.800
and I am sure I am sure that somebody like Steve Hatfield has probably sat in a room where they

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:56.320
talked about this I'm pretty sure Robert Malone with all of his long back experience with some

01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:02.880
of the granddaddies of virology I'm sure he sat in a room where this has been discussed

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:15.040
and since the first papers that Jessica Rose ever did for her were virology papers where she did

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:21.520
computer simulations of virology or viruses or viral replication or something she may even know

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:32.240
but Weinstein he doesn't know he's he's really not as sophisticated as a biologist as he would

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:39.280
like you to believe and I'm pretty sure well I don't know I don't know I don't know anybody

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:43.200
any of these people I don't know about any of these people I just know for sure

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:49.920
that there was an elaborate operation where a lot of people were involved in a tug of war and

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:54.960
most of them weren't pulling where a lot of people were pretending to stop and start a train

01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:01.600
when they weren't playing any role at all and they were given comfort and fame and a book deal

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:06.560
just keep doing this with this guy would you just keep helping this guy pretend to stop the train

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:14.400
until we're done and so all of these arguments were that the discussion of everybody's vulnerable

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.040
the PCR cycle counts have nothing to do with reality lab leak spike

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:24.720
well nobody talked about antibiotics or steroids nobody talked about the biohazard

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.520
the the ventilation nobody talked about the financial incentives that were twisting this all up

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:38.400
nobody talked about the lack of discussion of of nutrition it was all this was all things right

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:44.400
all things to fight about oh but they're not giving anybody vitamin D

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:53.920
it's vitamin D deficiency ivermectin hydroxychloroquine these things work for this novel virus

02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:01.520
some very curious people were involved in perpetuating the ivermectin narrative

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:06.720
Brett Weinstein I showed you in the beginning claimed that it was 100% effective as a prophylaxis

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:14.080
and that if we just forced everybody to take ivermectin for six uh six weeks we would be done

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:23.680
with this 60 days I want to argue that the DNA contamination in the shot is being used as another

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:29.840
opportunity to make many fake helpers which will join the vigorous discussion that will never

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:36.320
question the necessity of that countermeasure and they will also not question the general

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.000
application of transfection as a vaccination methodology that's like the the buckholtz guy

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:51.040
and kevin mccernan both of them have been very instrumental in pushing this this DNA contamination

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:59.120
idea forward and now we have the the florida the florida surgeon general saying that we should

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.440
stop the shots because there's DNA contamination in them and that they could integrate now whether

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.920
or not that's true doesn't matter it's that it doesn't it's irrelevant to the to the wholly

02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.760
inappropriate nature of transfection for healthy people

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.480
it suggests that and and buckholtz actually said that when he was presenting in front of the

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:24.400
South Carolina Senate that if this DNA wasn't in there then the shot would be great

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:30.080
but as long as the DNA is in there I'm not sure I want to give it to my daughter wow

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:38.000
and those statements can be seen as somebody also helping this guy fake stop and start the

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.120
train that's what buckholtz did he's faking this faking the resistance the faking the discussion

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:52.640
about what's important and the diffuse proposal and the discussion of its contents it's DARPA

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:59.280
rejection and the likelihood that the experiments described in it were already done is another

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:05.920
example of the limited spectrum of debate maintained by these actors so that we argue about stuff

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:11.440
that gets us to accept the Scooby-Doo like other aspects of the narrative by accepting its relevance

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.040
you accept the premise of RNA pandemics and that a fear and cleavage site could play a role in it

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:25.440
and that molecular modification was key that is an illusion but if you see how they all line up

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.720
they're all trying to get us to believe and teach our kids that gain a function is real

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.680
that's what they need us to do if we teach our kids the gain of function is real

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.680
then they're on the train forever if we teach them that this worst case scenario is real

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:46.800
they're on the train forever they're stuck in the car with these people but we can get them out

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:54.080
we can get them out by realizing that these people don't do the math they don't talk about zero

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:58.320
epidemiological evidence of spread they don't talk about the massive health care costs that

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:04.000
were saved around the world with this operation they don't talk about strict liability they don't

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.200
talk about the strategy of going at the seventh amendment or going at it as a violation of the

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.680
seventh amendment the prep act they don't talk about the prep act they don't talk about getting

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:22.400
rid of it and so all the solutions that these people present us will not reveal this scheme

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:29.040
and they will not reveal that the toxicity of this imaginary virus has been confounded with

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:34.480
transfection so the transfection could be said to be relatively successful they will say that

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:40.800
because we rushed it because it's contaminated because it's imperfect because we chose the wrong

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:48.480
protein but they're not going to question the overall story and they overall need none of them

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.000
none of them Robert Malone is still saying that antibodies are real

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:54.960
and that they're important

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.880
so does Vincent so does carrot fund and bullshit's talking about antibodies all the time this

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:14.000
picture is from the NIH director's own blog in 2020 Francis Collins it's a very nice well drawn

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:17.360
computer-generated picture of spike proteins in different flavors

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:24.880
and how antibodies from infection are not quite as good as antibodies from vaccine

02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:32.080
this is misleading the young this is lying to our children this is lying to parents of children

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:34.080
this is lying to prospective parents

02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:43.840
it is the most malevolent photograph illustration that I've ever seen in the pandemic it is

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:50.960
awful and it's all contains everything here the variants are only in the spike

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:59.120
the antibodies only are for the spike which means you only need B cells which means it's

02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:04.320
become stupid simple stupid complicated or dumb simple this is dumb simple

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:13.760
and so your perception of the pandemic really depends on who you're paying attention to

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.160
you could be here

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:24.720
or you could be here and depending on who you're listening to and who you're seeing you're going

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.800
to have a very different outlook and a very different feel about what's happening in the

02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:33.360
world but it could be that the vast majority of people are still completely trapped and we'd

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:34.000
never know

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:42.640
we could be having 131 viewers or we could have 131,000 viewers right now how would we know

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.640
but this is going to fade away this is going to be erased and the past will become truth if the

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:59.520
lie will become truth if we don't teach it to our children now I went over this biology already

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:04.560
it's not sufficient I think what's happening is existing cellular machinery for exosome production

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:10.960
is being hijacked by these self-replicating RNAs are these self-replicating RNAs out there in the

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:18.240
wild are they produced by mammals are they capable of making a variant like this you see how much

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:25.120
detail they put into the endosomal construction and packaging of viruses to make you believe

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:32.480
that they understand this process this is the kind of illustration upon which

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:38.880
Kevin McCurnan's own understanding of how the infectious cycle works is based on cartoons like

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:45.840
this it's not based on experiments he's done they're all based on the same papers same papers that

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.960
don't adequately justify a cartoon like this

02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:56.960
and that's why I think it's really important to understand the mixtape idea I think it's really

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.960
understood important to understand that they can't culture them but what they can do is sequence

02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:07.600
them they can make them into plasmids those plasmids can be grown and if you ligate them

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:13.200
together you can make a large quantity of an RNA that you claim can only be found in nature

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:19.520
and doesn't really quantify it doesn't really culture but now you can make a lot of it you can

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:23.760
always go back to the DNA you can make animals sick with it you can share it with your family

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:29.600
and friends and you can also make industrial sized quantities of it which would allow you to

02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:33.520
transfect a lot of people would allow you to put a signal in a lot of places would allow you to

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:42.080
spike a lot of sewers and I want to remind you that there are papers where they look at this

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:50.320
expression of this positive strand RNA and when they find these these subgenomic RNAs here what

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.760
Kevin McCurnan was talking about they are in the hundreds of thousands of times more abundant

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:03.840
I'm going to skip this one more abundant than the whole genome these are up here at 10 to the 4th

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:12.080
these are thousands of copies of the N thousands of copies of the E the M and the S protein

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:20.400
very very few copies of RF1A and RF1B these are the replicase proteins and accessory proteins that

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:28.480
are required to copy the virus again and so any of these RNAs that are produced here in the thousands

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:33.600
of times more abundant are not going to produce variants they're going to produce proteins only

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:40.320
in fact in this paper they found exactly two that could qualify as full genome length and

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:47.840
both of them are incomplete this is a much older paper showing you a very similar technique of

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:53.280
trying to make infectious clones and when they do that and they look for the RNA of the whole

02:09:53.280 --> 02:10:00.800
virus they don't find it it's not there it's very very faint just as the same as this paper

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:09.680
where you get one and two the blue and the pink one and the rest are thousands and thousands of

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:17.600
sub genomic RNAs mostly for the N the E the 4 protein and the S and they see the same thing

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:28.480
decades ago when they do the the more traditional RNA gel here and so the confounding has occurred

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:35.520
through the use of a worst case scenario narrative that was carefully curated for the last four years

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.080
and they have achieved a lot they have avoided an exponential increase in Medicare costs they

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:48.400
have protected against a growing skepticism they have been protecting against a growing skepticism

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:55.200
in vaccines they have trans started to make us accept a transition to digital currency they have

02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.400
transitioned us to a genetic form of vaccines for the entire population it's pretty much

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:06.160
already accepted at least in the in the bureaucracies that matter they have confounded the toxicity of

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.280
the virus and transfection to allow the pandemic to prove transfection successful for number four

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:17.600
they are transitioning our youth into submission with full digital control and that will include

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:22.000
them needing to identify themselves on their games and in social media to protect them

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:27.920
and there are people complaining about that on social media as well even adults are asking for

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:35.200
ID so that people can't anonymously harass me and then they have edified the mythology of

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:41.840
pandemic viruses around the world across languages they're also disrupting family formation they

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:46.720
also have maybe shortened the lifespan of billions of people by transfecting them

02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:49.760
are they going to kill billions of people with a gain of function virus

02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:56.560
no they are not are they going to destroy the cultural fabric of america with this story by

02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:02.000
ripping us right down the middle absolutely they are and are they trying to create the

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.040
the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed i think they are

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.600
and i don't think they would mind if the united states fell apart while they did it

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:19.440
so if you want that to stop we've got to learn the biology that they are trying to get us to accept

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:26.640
you've got to really dig in and learn and teach your children that we didn't get rid of every

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:33.360
disease with vaccination in the past it was also water treatment and sewer it was also nutrition

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:41.120
and better hygiene novel coronaviruses do not jump regularly and cause pandemics they might

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.080
jump from species you might be able to get sick from animals

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:50.640
but it's not something that can cause a domino effect that that travels around the world for many

02:12:50.640 --> 02:13:00.400
years. PCR's aren't false positives are not rare they're just irrelevant asymptomatic spread is not

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:06.960
real variants are not evidence of spread if they're if they're just an endemic signal

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:12.960
and we have not been studying viruses with gain of function research that's just an illusion of

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:21.200
things that they do on the bench it's the illusion that they want to trap us in that's the new world

02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:28.880
order that's why i use that bat i think it's just brilliant because it is it's it's it's pandemic

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:34.160
potential and badcaves is the mythology the new world order they want us to pass on to our children

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.400
and once this lie becomes truth they're never going to be able to escape from it

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.000
in a very similar way that most of us were trapped in the idea that vaccines were great

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:46.720
and it would be nuts to be anti-vaccine

02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.560
our kids will be trapped in a much much more malevolent mythology than that

02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:00.720
this faith in a novel virus has to be broken one of the ways to break it is to point out to

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.800
people that we're in our fifth year i mean that should really shake some people fifth year

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.440
we're in the fifth year

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:18.000
and i want to very much emphasize again that kevin mccurnan has been about as disingenuous

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:25.760
as one can be um a lot like maybe a flat earther in fact i think he actually used that before

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:31.200
Robert Malone used that before and in fact Vincent Renson yellow used it in twiv

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:38.880
not too many days ago as well saying that talking about there being no pandemic or debating about

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:44.160
the fidelity of viruses or talking about chemtrail retarded things like the clones

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:51.280
is the equivalent of flat earth discussion it's comical really because again we have already

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.840
known this for a long time that that's what flat earth and some of these other things we're going

02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:02.480
to be used for that's one of the reasons what i think somebody like tom kawan does when he talks

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:11.760
about water storing emotional energy when you freeze it and and confusing that with

02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.960
the water memory that luke montane was investigating for example

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:24.720
and so on one hand you have tom kawan super right about analysis with regard to isolation

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:31.040
and and purification of viruses but then in the same podcast you might talk about how there's

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:37.680
some lady in New Zealand who can freeze water and it'll store memories in it trying to confound

02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:45.280
the research of the late luke montane into the ability of water to store memory of dna

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:52.160
that's how you can see how this whole this whole charade is nonsense

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:59.680
so if you want to break out of this we've got to advocate for a stopping of all childhood

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:03.200
vaccines in the united states and we would make that argument based on the fact that

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:08.080
there's no other western country that does it like we do that does it as early as we do

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:13.520
and as often as we do and it's just stupid we also have to advocate for strict liability

02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.440
at all pharmaceutical products it's a real simple thing lawyers understand it everybody

02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.600
understands it especially the pharmaceutical companies and especially the cdc

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:27.920
who's actually the largest vaccine supplier in america investigate the use of deadly protocols

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:33.360
to cause mass casualty events this would be all of the things including remdesivir but not just

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:38.720
that anything and everything investigate the use of these same mass casualty events and

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:47.280
transfection perhaps clones to seed the idea of a narrative of a pandemic i also want to advocate

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.720
for claiming sovereignty over our bodies and those of our children i want to advocate for

02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:57.600
getting out of the who and the un entirely ending our cdc entirely maybe reorganizing our fda

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:02.720
but to see the medlers you need to see them for who they are they won't really speak out against

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:08.720
the vaccine schedule although i won't use the words strict liability they won't talk about the

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:14.480
deadly protocols and you know what john bodewin was on high wire and john bodewin talked about

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:20.080
the protocols and the high wire guy tried to cut him off but john bodewin called it murder

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:24.720
john bodewin called it murder more than once so here's to you john bodewin i'm going to try

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:32.160
and do a show about that uh that interview tomorrow um and they attack people instead of ideas and

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.880
they're unable to summarize across the entire show

02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:40.480
robert melon's a key example of how he's not able to summarize across the entire show

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:45.520
a couple years ago he would summarize across the entire show by saying that he has a friend in

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:52.160
the cia and another one at ditra and he made an uh computer model of x-ray crystallography of the

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:59.440
three c three cl protease and then he interfaced that crystallography model with all of the known

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:05.440
pharmaceuticals in the fda's in the fda's catalog and he did that in about three weeks and he

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:11.360
identified remdesivir and uh fomotidine and a couple other things that steve kirsch investigated

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:18.080
as combinations that could be patentable and now he tells a completely different story

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:23.440
he doesn't start out with i invented all this stuff these things are saving the world

02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:33.360
like his wife does or did his story has changed because it's hard it's hard to consistently tell

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:40.800
a story when it's not the truth it's hard when the narrative is being pushed back against and

02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:46.640
the script needs to be rewritten it's hard when everybody is starting to see through your ai

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:53.200
lie it's hard when everybody's starting to see through your clone lie it's hard to see

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:59.600
it's hard to move forward when you have to keep changing the script and adding new actors all

02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:05.840
the time because the original script just didn't stick the original script being it's a laboratory

02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:11.440
leak with all kinds of crazy problems and so everybody better take the shot like jordan peterson

02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.560
set take the damn shot so we can get it over with

02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.920
artificial general intelligence is the next myth they're going to push on us

02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:25.360
they're going to use that to try and justify digital id and we don't need those

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:30.880
but the digital id is kind of a joke to me because in reality we already have digital id

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.640
there's no question in my mind that all digital id is already solved right here in the phone right

02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:43.120
i mean we carry it around it's got gps it's got everything that they could possibly want even a

02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:51.840
microphone and a camera i think digital id is probably a little bit of a a hoax and in reality

02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.440
we should all be advocating for like a phone that's anonymous with no tracking and no gps and all

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:02.240
other stuff and you know apps that can't track you and we're not we're not worried about that at all

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:08.480
i think digital id is probably a joke but but digital currency is not so stop all

02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:13.360
transfections and healthy humans they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:19.280
necessary i assure you but it is deeper than that of course they want us to to sign our kids up in

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:26.480
our our grandchildren up for testing forever intramuscular injection of any combination of

02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:30.880
substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb transfections and healthy

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:36.320
humans is criminally negligent and i'm talking to all you academic biologists out there who

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:45.040
should have done known better viruses are not patterned integrity i don't know what to say

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:52.720
ladies and gentlemen but this seems like a pretty significant landmark here when somebody like

02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:59.440
kevin mccurnan just i don't know if it's i don't know how to how to characterize what this what this

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.600
what this landmark is other than somebody that i hoped

02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:09.440
would turn out to be just someone that we were getting our wires crossed and stuff

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.880
it's it's really become pretty obvious that he's a medler it's actually become pretty obvious

02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:21.680
that he's been meddling with me for a long time and uh so here we are uh if you can support this

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:27.440
stream it would be really great if you'd go to giga ohmbiological.com and stroll the scroll down

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:35.840
and subscribe or even a one-time um support link is right here and also join me at giga ohm.bio where

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:40.720
we have this ongoing conversation that sometimes i'm participating in and sometimes i forget about

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:47.520
because i'm on twitter yuck um and then here's gonna be a schedule and uh phone number and then

02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:53.920
here's where you can subscribe um and i will update the list uh tomorrow so that it's up to date for

02:21:53.920 --> 02:22:00.000
the next stream um and i will see you tomorrow i think i'm gonna cover john boedwin's um high wire

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.400
interview because i do think it was a really good one and i do think that he did a very good job

02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:10.880
of underscoring how this the whole thing has just been a giant lie and they won't stop lying about

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:16.640
it and so i'm i'm very pleased with what john boedwin did on the high wire and so i want to amplify

02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:20.880
that a little bit so i'm probably going to do that tomorrow thank you all very much for joining

02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:35.680
