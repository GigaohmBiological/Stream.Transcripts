WEBVTT

00:00.209 --> 00:24.882
can give me a little feedback on the chat that would be really great I don't expect everybody there CQ CQ CQ this is whiskey 3 JJW whiskey 3 JJW whiskey 3 Juliet Juliet whiskey thank you very much for joining me everybody this is Gigo and biological I'm just gonna go through the intro really quick because we have a guest waiting

00:48.203 --> 00:50.184
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

00:51.285 --> 00:56.007
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.129
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

01:00.776 --> 01:01.696
It's embarrassing.

01:14.063 --> 01:15.444
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:15.644 --> 01:21.327
From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, this is Giga Home Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:21.387 --> 01:28.611
I find myself in the same hamster wheel as you are, trying to stay focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and trying to love my neighbor.

01:30.252 --> 01:35.175
Your consciousness is still the prime real estate that these people are trying to occupy.

01:35.215 --> 01:41.440
They're using social media and our acquiescence to it to do that very thing, to achieve that very thing.

01:42.761 --> 01:45.843
And we actually inherited these charlatans from our parents.

01:45.883 --> 01:47.504
It's not totally our fault.

01:49.686 --> 01:52.468
It's a multi-generational game that these people are playing.

01:52.508 --> 01:53.149
They inherited

01:53.949 --> 01:58.930
from their mentors and it's not just the people on TV but also on social media.

01:58.970 --> 02:09.252
There are coordinated groups of people that are ignoring the biology of intramuscular injection being ridiculous for an intent of augmenting the immune system.

02:09.653 --> 02:12.233
The idea that transfection was always criminal.

02:12.373 --> 02:14.614
These are old technologies.

02:15.014 --> 02:20.395
And finally, RNA cannot pandemic is gonna be one of the most famous phrases to come out of

02:22.196 --> 02:24.639
2023 or 2022 whenever as I first said it.

02:25.621 --> 02:33.370
Ladies and gentlemen, Edward Bernays told you, Noam Chomsky told you, it is a very lively debate within a very controlled spectrum.

02:33.911 --> 02:37.875
And now that we've acquiesced to social media, now that they kicked us out of that moving truck,

02:38.576 --> 02:44.299
and pretended to pick us up on the side of the road and whispered a story of a novel virus into our ears.

02:45.099 --> 02:51.503
We've been led to believe that Gain of Function is real, and even if it wasn't this time, it definitely will come again.

02:52.881 --> 02:58.642
And of course, the real reason why they had to do this was because they had a population problem to manage.

02:58.662 --> 03:03.724
A lot of old people going into retirement, going to cost Medicaid and Medicare a lot of money.

03:04.364 --> 03:10.145
And so they needed to use an elaborate story that has no epidemiological evidence of spread.

03:10.185 --> 03:13.566
They needed to put some lawyers in place that wouldn't talk about anything useful.

03:14.286 --> 03:20.049
And they needed to run the clock out on this while they used murder and lies to manage the problem.

03:20.369 --> 03:25.111
The vaccine schedule in the USA is criminal as far as Jonathan Cooey is concerned.

03:25.692 --> 03:29.733
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal and RNA cannot pandemic.

03:29.834 --> 03:34.556
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an illusion of consensus that's been created by them.

03:35.896 --> 03:42.380
These humans that are on the internet and on the interwebs playing games with us on social media.

03:44.451 --> 03:50.094
The social media is not the free town square nonsense that we're being led to believe.

03:50.755 --> 03:55.737
Elon Musk didn't purchase Twitter and just save us before the bell.

03:56.998 --> 04:12.107
This is a new kind of totalitarianism where highly trained acolytes will do an elaborate performance on social media and will make us believe that we're being heard, make us believe that progress is being made, maybe even give us hope about what's to come.

04:12.927 --> 04:20.312
And all of these people are put there by weaponized piles of money that are governing us with a narrative, mostly a mythology.

04:21.673 --> 04:25.295
And by engaging in social media, that's exactly what you're going to accept.

04:25.375 --> 04:31.299
There is no way otherwise it can work because it's a military program.

04:31.359 --> 04:32.520
It's not an algorithm.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.308
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jonathan Cooley.

04:35.348 --> 04:39.349
I'm a recovering academic biologist, neurobiologist to be precise.

04:39.409 --> 04:44.190
I was a microscope jockey and a butcher of mice.

04:44.970 --> 04:50.972
Giga ohm biological, that little phrase comes from the electrical recordings I used to make, the methodology.

04:51.212 --> 04:53.013
There's me again with my microscope.

04:54.093 --> 04:57.916
GigaOM can be found at stream.gigaom.bio slash home.

04:58.096 --> 04:59.918
It's my own peer tube site.

05:00.558 --> 05:05.141
All the videos are hosted there without an algorithm, without having to log in.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.563
You can download them and share them whenever you want to.

05:07.663 --> 05:10.805
And gigaombiological.com is a place where you can support me.

05:10.905 --> 05:11.666
Thank you very much.

05:12.206 --> 05:17.630
Today on the show, I have a friend of mine from late 2022.

05:17.670 --> 05:18.471
I met through Stephen Frost.

05:21.793 --> 05:24.455
of the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International Group.

05:25.075 --> 05:31.040
Meredith Miller has a website www.innerintegration.com.

05:32.320 --> 05:47.011
I was really impressed with the last time that we talked because she was able to articulate how it is that this mass psychosis idea is a little bit disingenuous and a little bit misleading in terms of trying to explain the

05:47.691 --> 05:54.296
the psychological state that was induced in 2020 and sustained, maybe even up until right now, we're going to find out from her.

05:54.737 --> 06:02.763
And I just want to update you on exactly why we are together today with Meredith.

06:02.883 --> 06:05.505
I think I'm just going to drop myself down here on the bottom.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.267
Robert Malone is a guy who kind of

06:07.887 --> 06:16.555
flashed on the scene sometime in 2021 to start telling us a story about how he was actually on the scene already in early 2020.

06:17.376 --> 06:29.166
In fact, in the first week of January, because he got a call from his friend who said that something crazy was happening in Wuhan, and then he spun his team up, and he's a Ditra guy, and he used generative AI and

06:30.387 --> 06:59.747
and x-ray crystallography models of two different proteins in the virus to scan all of the nutraceuticals in the FDA catalog to identify ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and, come on, I just lost it, and there's one more, remdesivir, and then I was working behind the scenes to get those drugs tested for a year or so, and then at some point found it necessary to come out on the Brett Weinstein podcast and the Joe Rogan podcast and tell us that

07:00.207 --> 07:11.212
These shots might not be for everybody Now I promised Meredith that we weren't going to talk about people in a negative way So I'm not talking about Robert Malone in a negative way.

07:11.292 --> 07:22.317
I wanted to understand the history because it's actually his recent substack From November 8th is the reason why Meredith and I got in contact again now I

07:23.257 --> 07:26.019
I think she was a little shocked to get a random message from me.

07:26.059 --> 07:28.921
We were in zero contact since she was on my show.

07:29.421 --> 07:33.424
She could have already assumed that, wow, after having me on, he's never even said hello.

07:33.464 --> 07:34.785
He didn't even send me an email.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.427
I wonder what kind of a clown that was.

07:37.887 --> 07:40.008
So in a way, I was really embarrassed.

07:40.068 --> 07:45.992
I watched the old video of her that's in my archive, and I made this really long introduction, which I seem to be doing again.

07:46.653 --> 07:48.634
And she was waiting in the background.

07:48.674 --> 07:51.116
Now, it's quite embarrassing, actually, how long I made her wait.

07:51.156 --> 07:52.637
But this time, it's for real.

07:53.617 --> 08:11.071
because Robert Malone suddenly decided to make this video, which is not just some video, it's a video of me, a video of Mark Kulak that you all know has been my friend for a good three years now, ever since we met in person for the first time at the inaugural CHD conference in Knoxville, Tennessee.

08:11.571 --> 08:20.158
And so that's not only a video of me and Mark, it's also a video where they use footage of Meredith talking about a certain, whatever, I don't know, Darvo or something.

08:20.818 --> 08:39.156
and also it is a video produced by these anonymous accounts on Twitter that I've been saying for a year or two years or four years now can't be trusted because they could even be anonymous accounts being run by people that you know or interact with and I tried to give a number of examples of how

08:39.976 --> 08:50.805
I've been told by people on Twitter that other people on Twitter are bad, but then those people seem to work and show up in the same places all the time, and it started to become obvious to me that they were coordinating.

08:51.686 --> 09:05.197
So this seems to be a weird admission because the video is, of course, I don't know if it's aware for everybody of Robert Malone's substack, but these videos are pulled from a guy by the name of Kevin McCairn.

09:06.257 --> 09:09.882
who after doing 5 streams with me in March of 2020

09:12.439 --> 09:38.413
Went on to basically harass me from afar Japan or wherever he lives for three years there I have over four terabytes of video of this guy where he spends sometimes hours on me and it's extraordinary how the vitriol and racism and slander and bad words and nonsense and anti-semitism that he throws out it's extraordinary the kinds of

09:39.373 --> 09:48.855
video that this guy has made over the last five years and how many hours are devoted to me and then to have Robert Malone decide to pull this video is really incredible.

09:48.915 --> 09:57.117
So some things to note and I think this is also to set Meredith up in the right way because I have been watching this pattern for a while.

09:57.578 --> 10:02.859
He provides a link to the X account that made the video, the anonymous mouse account.

10:03.539 --> 10:07.023
He posted on X an anonymous rodent account.

10:07.403 --> 10:10.467
The video is composed of clips from Kevin McCarron and Charles Rixey.

10:10.487 --> 10:12.729
Of course, I have a long five-year history with them.

10:13.270 --> 10:18.416
The video uses clips of Meredith Miller interviewed on the 22nd of December, 2022 by Stephen Frost.

10:18.436 --> 10:19.417
Just covering this again.

10:19.437 --> 10:23.802
The video also uses a clip of Mark Kulak, but there are no links to Meredith.

10:24.989 --> 10:27.672
No, Meredith is from inner integration.

10:27.712 --> 10:37.644
And what's strange is that he uses what Meredith says in the video, I think to imply that Mark and I are abusers who have been discovered.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.948
And so then double down and pretend we are the victims.

10:42.097 --> 10:46.420
And so it's not even that Meredith is actually being implied to be bad.

10:46.520 --> 10:54.364
She is implied to be the psychologist who can explain what I guess is happening when in the videos of Mark and I. And that's what's extraordinary.

10:54.424 --> 11:00.428
No links for Mark, no name, no name for me, no name for Meredith.

11:01.048 --> 11:05.631
Just a video of the three of us with links to the anonymous Twitter account.

11:05.771 --> 11:06.872
Thanks, Robert.

11:08.164 --> 11:24.268
And the videos that they used are all clipped from who I can only call as obviously somebody who is deeply involved in this because otherwise he wouldn't have spent the thousands, almost hours on me over the last five years.

11:24.328 --> 11:26.389
So this is just a quick play of it.

11:26.429 --> 11:29.770
You can see here, it's on his little website.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.711
I'm gonna scroll down and it's the second video actually, here it is.

11:37.390 --> 11:37.690
Why?

11:37.710 --> 11:39.432
Well, I'll tell you why.

11:39.952 --> 11:46.618
Because Richard Fleming and Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn.

11:47.239 --> 11:54.245
And so you can see already here, just to interrupt it, that this is from Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn, where they were used.

11:54.285 --> 11:55.426
There's a gigaspiral.

11:55.486 --> 11:56.087
If you go on

11:56.767 --> 12:24.130
on rumble and look up gigaspire you can probably find 30 videos hours long where they're saying something like i'm raising money to to earn crack cocaine money or that i'm on crack or that i'm losing my mind so that's that's what's that's what this little thing is taken from kevin mckernan and jessica rose and all these other fakers you know when abusers are found out what do they do they double down they play the victim

12:25.090 --> 12:26.281
I'm sure we're under attack.

12:29.122 --> 12:31.082
That's because they're traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

12:31.102 --> 12:32.803
They're all traitors.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.423
That's what you should see.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.343
They are all traitors.

12:36.783 --> 12:40.544
These people right here are all traitors.

12:40.944 --> 12:45.245
One of the things we call in the terminology of narcissistic abuse is DARVO.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.285
It's an acronym.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.986
Denial, attack, reverse, victim and offender.

12:50.326 --> 12:51.066
What does that mean?

12:51.586 --> 12:55.587
You tell a person this is abusive, they flip it around on you.

12:56.027 --> 12:58.147
Now you're the abuser and they're the victim.

12:58.627 --> 12:59.649
and we can watch this.

12:59.849 --> 13:08.241
And I'm sure that we are under attack by a lot of different by and a lot of different angles but one of them is anonymous accounts that pretend to be good.

13:11.385 --> 13:12.887
My army is unstoppable.

13:13.328 --> 13:15.090
Each mouse more deadly than the last.

13:18.885 --> 13:24.009
And of course, this video is taken from a specific video on a specific night.

13:24.129 --> 13:28.312
The anonymous mouse, which used to be funny until.

13:28.893 --> 13:36.539
It's interesting, I think, for Meredith to know that I put that hat on very specifically because I noticed that these people were doing their little game.

13:36.579 --> 13:42.284
And so after a two hour or two and a half hour stream in the last 10 minutes, I put that hat on.

13:42.864 --> 13:52.612
because I knew that if they made any meme of me in that hat, that it meant that they had to have watched the whole two and a half hour stream because otherwise they wouldn't have caught me in the hat.

13:53.173 --> 14:01.120
And so I find it also very hilarious that he used that clip because the only reason why I put it on was to demonstrate that they were watching all hours of me.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.122
And this is Mark Kulak, of course.

14:04.923 --> 14:09.767
Meredith, I don't think has met Mark, but I would vouch for Mark as a good guy because,

14:10.936 --> 14:12.157
We've met a number of times.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.558
We've shared rental cars and hotel rooms.

14:14.778 --> 14:18.660
And I think it's pretty hard to lie to somebody.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.401
It's pretty hard to lie to me.

14:20.541 --> 14:27.045
And so over those many, many hours, I've come to trust Mark as a real friend.

14:27.065 --> 14:29.846
He's one of the few guys who will ever promote my work.

14:29.906 --> 14:31.347
I mean, really one of the very few.

14:31.947 --> 14:32.888
gentleman out there.

14:32.988 --> 14:39.554
It realizes, or it's been called out, that its actions and the things that it won't say effectively are facilitating murder.

14:41.917 --> 14:43.298
And I mean that sincerely.

14:44.058 --> 14:47.422
There are people that are dead because of the way these online accounts work.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.564
They are part of, they are assisting this murder.

14:50.925 --> 14:53.407
You know, when abusers are found out, what do they do?

14:53.487 --> 14:55.990
They double down, they play the victim.

14:57.048 --> 15:01.151
And so that video is the reason why we are getting together.

15:01.231 --> 15:02.872
If I hit escape, oh, there we go.

15:03.072 --> 15:03.992
It's finally there.

15:04.553 --> 15:05.853
Sorry, surprise, surprise.

15:08.155 --> 15:10.016
Meredith, thank you very much for joining me.

15:10.136 --> 15:11.717
I really appreciate this.

15:11.777 --> 15:15.919
I know that, I guess when I sent you the video, you weren't even aware of it.

15:15.979 --> 15:21.203
It's probably much better that you don't pay attention to these things that are going on with regard to the biology.

15:22.088 --> 15:29.993
and what's happening with these people that are riding the coattails of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or appear to be, from my perspective.

15:31.093 --> 15:34.055
So we haven't talked in a couple years.

15:34.275 --> 15:35.536
I want to just give you the floor.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.217
I did my introduction.

15:37.497 --> 15:46.603
And if you want to tell people what you've been up to since and what your impression of when you saw this maybe, maybe is a good way to kick it off.

15:46.643 --> 15:48.564
But really, just take it wherever you want to go.

15:48.604 --> 15:49.925
And if I have a question, I'll interrupt.

15:49.965 --> 15:50.585
Thank you very much.

15:51.914 --> 16:10.315
Yeah that was wild when you sent me that video because you know it's just how what the media does is they'll take clips of people or clips of things that happen and then they'll distort that or misrepresent it in some way and obviously people are allowed to do that you know you can take clips of things online and put it out and that doesn't

16:10.895 --> 16:13.738
make it right, but it is legal for them to do.

16:13.919 --> 16:18.083
It's up to the viewer to have the discernment and the wisdom.

16:18.263 --> 16:25.311
And that discernment is a skill that is ever more essential in these times because there are so many lies.

16:25.951 --> 16:31.897
And not just from, you know, what we perceive to be the enemy, the opposite side, you know, it's just the lies are everywhere.

16:32.598 --> 16:37.943
So it's really important to develop discernment, to tune into that discernment.

16:38.043 --> 16:43.428
And that discernment usually comes through painful experiences where you learn the hard way.

16:44.149 --> 16:47.652
You have those experiences with people, with situations, with groups even.

16:48.392 --> 17:01.296
where you thought it was going to be one thing and then it turns out to be completely the opposite or even somebody offers you help and it turns out that that help had strings attached and actually their intention the whole time was to abuse you.

17:01.396 --> 17:09.318
So it really is up to the viewer to do some research, to reflect, to question, and to use your critical thinking.

17:09.938 --> 17:10.138
right?

17:10.198 --> 17:16.083
Because the whole problem is that people are losing access to their higher consciousness.

17:16.103 --> 17:23.890
They're losing access to the critical thinking, but also the higher consciousness of insight and intuition about what's going on.

17:23.930 --> 17:29.434
People are losing this ability because they're getting locked in these fear states, right?

17:29.494 --> 17:33.517
It's been years now of bombardment of fear by the media,

17:34.318 --> 17:49.247
all kinds of different directions even you know you go to the grocery store and you're still hearing that bombardment in the background on the loudspeaker you walk into the store and like it's already on the wall like you know it's time to get your vaccine now you know at the grocery store

17:50.107 --> 17:59.932
So the problem is that that fear bombardment is locking people in lower states of consciousness, where they're getting triggered into what we call primal states or states of defense.

18:00.392 --> 18:03.554
So that's the fight, flight, freeze, and fawn states.

18:03.914 --> 18:06.796
And we all get triggered into any of these states.

18:07.216 --> 18:10.538
But what happens is, depending on however our childhood went,

18:11.298 --> 18:13.019
Everybody had some kind of stress.

18:13.099 --> 18:15.499
Most people had some kind of trauma in childhood.

18:15.539 --> 18:18.700
Sometimes they aren't things that are easily identifiable.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.821
Sometimes it's not war and outward abuse and things like that.

18:22.881 --> 18:26.362
Sometimes it's much more subtle, like neglect, right?

18:26.422 --> 18:30.023
If you grew up with emotional neglect, maybe all your needs were met.

18:30.063 --> 18:36.045
Maybe you even came from a higher economically status family, so you assumed like neglect.

18:36.085 --> 18:37.285
No, I wasn't neglected at all.

18:37.785 --> 18:39.786
But you don't realize you are emotionally neglected.

18:39.866 --> 18:43.589
So then you grow up and you think that your needs don't matter.

18:43.829 --> 18:46.931
You've never been in reciprocal relationships.

18:46.971 --> 18:50.153
You're used to sacrificing yourself and putting someone else first.

18:50.193 --> 18:51.213
That's called fawning.

18:51.814 --> 18:54.415
That's one of those four defense mechanisms.

18:54.475 --> 18:57.317
And so whatever happened in childhood, some people learn to fight.

18:57.817 --> 19:02.120
They learned that was the best way to survive whatever intensely stressful thing was going on.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.982
And then in adulthood, they're fighting all the time.

19:05.022 --> 19:10.126
It's very difficult to connect with them because they just want to fight you on everything that you say, right?

19:10.266 --> 19:11.507
But where does that come from?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.749
Like at a time in childhood, that was the intelligent response.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.692
And then it becomes maladaptive in adulthood.

19:17.832 --> 19:24.037
Or maybe you learned that things were so stressful in your family that your only escape was to go up to your room

19:24.757 --> 19:35.844
and close the door if you're allowed to do that and kind of just zone out or go into fantasy or go into video games or something to escape reality or maybe someplace, you know, in the yard if you weren't really allowed off the premises.

19:36.444 --> 19:39.026
Or maybe, you know, then that carries into adulthood, right?

19:39.046 --> 19:48.092
And then you develop things like alcoholism, food addictions, constant traveling just to, you know, avoid your feelings in your life situation.

19:48.872 --> 19:50.293
Or maybe you learn to fawn.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.474
Maybe that's what kept you safe in childhood.

19:52.954 --> 19:54.094
Sorry, you learn to freeze.

19:54.514 --> 19:57.816
Maybe that's what kept you safe in childhood where it was just so terrifying.

19:57.936 --> 19:58.836
There was no escape.

19:58.876 --> 19:59.577
There was nowhere to go.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.577
Maybe you're in a car on a car trip.

20:02.078 --> 20:02.538
So what do you do?

20:02.558 --> 20:03.358
You shut down.

20:03.498 --> 20:04.779
Your whole nervous system shuts down.

20:04.839 --> 20:05.579
It's not a choice.

20:05.619 --> 20:07.440
It's not a conscious choice when you're a kid.

20:07.960 --> 20:08.941
It just happens.

20:09.461 --> 20:10.421
And so you shut down.

20:10.461 --> 20:11.802
You go into that freeze state.

20:12.202 --> 20:19.806
But that freeze state is really built into the mammalian biological system where you're only supposed to be in that for a very short period of time.

20:19.866 --> 20:22.987
Like a cat will catch a mouse, the mouse fiends death.

20:23.067 --> 20:23.707
What does that mean?

20:24.528 --> 20:28.910
Their body is shutting down vital systems, digestion, respiration.

20:29.470 --> 20:33.655
heart rate, vital systems that you need to live are getting shut down.

20:33.715 --> 20:35.797
That's why it's a short term strategy.

20:36.237 --> 20:40.762
But because as humans, sometimes we're stuck in these situations where there's seemingly no escape.

20:41.162 --> 20:44.606
As I explained in our last conversation about what happened with the whole COVID

20:45.246 --> 20:46.547
campaign in that narrative.

20:46.647 --> 20:54.953
And so when we feel like there's no escape and we can't stay in that shut down state, we go into functional freeze state, we go into dissociation.

20:55.413 --> 20:56.654
So we move into flight.

20:57.354 --> 21:00.116
And so we basically, we check out, we disappear.

21:00.136 --> 21:03.038
And when, when we're not really there, we can't feel what's going on.

21:03.098 --> 21:04.759
The body mind is disconnected.

21:04.799 --> 21:08.702
We can't really access those higher states of consciousness.

21:09.182 --> 21:25.596
right so we all tend to go into one of those states based on or maybe more a combination of those states depending on our childhood upbringing and so it's good to identify what those are for each one of us because with all this stuff going on in the world you go online or you listen to something

21:26.477 --> 21:28.598
one of those states is probably getting triggered.

21:29.078 --> 21:29.218
Right.

21:29.258 --> 21:33.439
So notice what it is that's going to come up in your relational capacity as well.

21:33.499 --> 21:44.682
So when you're in intimate partnerships, when you're in friendships, when you're with anybody, those defense mechanisms will come up when you sense you're when your nervous system senses danger or life threat.

21:44.722 --> 21:54.445
And that could simply be somebody saying something bad about you or even for some people, like if somebody disagrees with you, that can feel like a life threat because maybe in childhood that was threatening.

21:54.485 --> 21:55.485
You weren't allowed to disagree.

21:56.265 --> 22:02.447
And if you said something that an abusive parent disagreed with, you were in big trouble, right?

22:02.507 --> 22:04.488
So all kinds of these dynamics happen.

22:04.528 --> 22:08.910
It's really good for us to be aware of what state am I in right now?

22:09.430 --> 22:18.213
Notice those maladaptive strategies, validate, okay, there was a time in childhood when that was the intelligent, innate capacity for you to survive.

22:18.313 --> 22:19.594
So you gotta validate that.

22:19.754 --> 22:22.635
And then you gotta recognize how it's sabotaging your life.

22:23.255 --> 22:44.822
and how you can change and make new choices and reprogram your nervous system now in adulthood, because the more we can get into those states, it's called in the polyvagal theory, safe and social, or what they also say in biology, like rest and digest, when you're in that state, when you're in a secure state, you have the capacity to emotionally connect with another person.

22:44.982 --> 22:49.684
You're not emotionally connecting with someone when you're fighting, fleeing, freezing, and fawning.

22:49.724 --> 22:51.905
It's not a real connection, even if somebody's right there.

22:52.745 --> 22:57.369
So when we access that state, that inner state of peace, right?

22:57.449 --> 23:03.213
Where no matter what chaos is going on in the world, can we shift the nervous system into that state of inner peace?

23:03.273 --> 23:07.357
And then you have access to those higher faculties of consciousness.

23:07.397 --> 23:10.319
That's why JJ put at the beginning that war on consciousness.

23:10.399 --> 23:11.860
I forget what the quote was that you put.

23:11.920 --> 23:18.445
The whole thing is about overcoming our ability to use our higher states of consciousness.

23:19.366 --> 23:35.883
right and so back to that video though you know i quite i was like why did they use that video of me so like if you wanted to talk about darvo like let's say the point of of that video was to use darvo against jj you'd probably go on youtube you type in darvo and you're gonna get tons of videos that come up

23:36.603 --> 23:37.404
in the results.

23:37.804 --> 23:48.572
But the fact that this person went out of their way to find a video that I did that's not really easily accessible online, like it's certainly not going to come up in a YouTube algorithm and a search engine like that.

23:49.073 --> 23:54.677
And I think that video was actually from my first interview with the Berlin Corona Committee in 2021.

23:54.877 --> 23:56.358
I'm not positive, but I think it was from then.

23:56.778 --> 23:58.139
It's not easy to find online.

23:58.159 --> 23:59.500
It was heavily censored.

24:00.041 --> 24:03.884
Maybe it's up there somewhere, but that person really went out of their way to find that.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.667
When there were so many other easy resources to find.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.149
Also, I said it inaccurately.

24:10.169 --> 24:13.092
I think I said denial instead of deny.

24:13.152 --> 24:20.078
So if the person was actually going for accuracy and they wanted to actually use an act like they would have gone to somebody else or some other better video about it.

24:20.718 --> 24:23.942
than me who made a mistake even in what I was saying, right?

24:24.222 --> 24:36.176
But when I reflected on that, when I tuned into my own intuition, I was like, you know, it really does seem like it was chosen to position two people in this medical freedom movement, whatever you want to call it, against one another.

24:36.896 --> 24:39.198
That's the divide and conquer strategy.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.800
And people take that bait all the time.

24:41.840 --> 24:46.904
That's one of the oldest manipulation strategies that happens in every abusive system.

24:47.405 --> 24:56.512
So if you look at like a family structure in an abusive system, that divide and conquer is always used to pit everybody against one another.

24:56.532 --> 25:01.776
They're always disturbing, distorting, perverting the communication among people.

25:02.296 --> 25:17.445
And then telling lies or smearing people or even revealing secrets or things like this that would like maybe embarrass somebody if somebody else knew, like maybe they had like a, you know, something embarrassing happened to them in their life and they trusted some person, they share that.

25:17.485 --> 25:23.528
But oftentimes it's like a smear campaign that goes on and they're telling these lies to one person, they're telling the lies to the other person.

25:24.008 --> 25:24.168
Why?

25:24.208 --> 25:28.591
Because they wanna make it impossible for other people in that system to have communication.

25:28.631 --> 25:30.192
They want everybody turning

25:30.692 --> 25:48.454
to the abuser they want everybody's loyalty toward the abuser make it impossible that the people ever connect in a way that they can say hey enough of that we're done with this right so the divide and conquer strategy that isolates anybody who threatens the power structure in that system

25:49.435 --> 25:51.575
And we've seen this throughout the years, right?

25:51.595 --> 25:56.336
There's been like a lot of infighting or whatever among this medical freedom group.

25:56.836 --> 26:02.317
And actually, you know, it's unfortunate because it's really a distraction from our focus and our goals.

26:02.417 --> 26:11.019
And it's actually playing right into the hands of the abusers, let's say like the higher up abusers, because in every abusive system, there's a hierarchy of abuser.

26:11.059 --> 26:12.799
It's never one abuser, right?

26:12.839 --> 26:13.919
It's a hierarchy.

26:13.979 --> 26:17.000
And they have like a whole hierarchy of power amongst themselves.

26:17.620 --> 26:22.082
And so what we're doing, you know, essentially there can be abusers down in this movement as well.

26:22.622 --> 26:22.762
Right.

26:22.802 --> 26:26.103
But really what that does is it plays into the hands of that system.

26:26.163 --> 26:29.865
It plays into the hands of the controllers who need to divide and conquer us.

26:30.025 --> 26:32.746
And it makes us enablers of the abuse.

26:33.446 --> 26:33.586
Right.

26:33.606 --> 26:36.187
So it's important for us to remember, like fighting is not empowerment.

26:36.307 --> 26:38.288
Fighting is one of those defense mechanisms.

26:39.088 --> 26:45.934
And so we get triggered by a perceived danger and we're fighting and then we're focusing on, you know, the abuser and what's happening.

26:45.954 --> 26:51.098
We're losing total focus of what really matters, what we're really trying to accomplish, right?

26:51.138 --> 26:56.722
Which is talking about what's happening and creating solutions and getting to the bottom of this.

26:56.802 --> 26:59.845
And we can really get stuck in those states.

27:00.445 --> 27:03.227
And so remember, where are you at right now?

27:03.267 --> 27:05.889
We can always all check in, where am I at right now?

27:06.210 --> 27:09.132
How am I being emotionally manipulated and triggered in this moment?

27:09.752 --> 27:21.261
Before you type some response online, before you run down some train path of what is real and what happened, really come back to center and notice where are you at right now?

27:21.781 --> 27:23.743
Do you have access to your critical thinking?

27:23.763 --> 27:26.165
Do you have access to your intuition and your insights?

27:26.745 --> 27:28.467
And how are you participating in that?

27:29.948 --> 27:37.193
because I'm also seeing like a lot of rage and wrath that's getting stirred and like, you know, even people looking for revenge out there.

27:37.213 --> 27:47.962
And sometimes people think that, you know, it's it's normal to have a fantasy of revenge when you've been abused, when you've been traumatized by somebody.

27:47.982 --> 27:48.122
Right.

27:48.162 --> 27:49.183
It's normal to have that.

27:49.323 --> 27:50.964
It's not OK to act on that.

27:51.404 --> 27:51.564
Right.

27:51.925 --> 27:52.946
Thinking it is one thing.

27:53.286 --> 27:54.267
It's not a thought crime.

27:54.627 --> 27:57.029
But if you act on that, that's wrong.

27:57.649 --> 28:20.687
because when what happens you become like the abuser that's how evil tricks you into becoming evil and then you're carrying the massive weight of that regret which is way worse on your conscience than the resentment towards somebody who hurt you right so what happens is the abusers always trick the targets into destroying themselves particularly the more covert abusers because

28:21.147 --> 28:23.268
They want to look like they're the heroes.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.968
They're saving everybody.

28:24.988 --> 28:27.990
And so what they do is they get you to destroy yourself.

28:28.030 --> 28:30.871
That way they can look like they haven't done anything wrong.

28:31.451 --> 28:35.232
So when we get caught up in that divide and conquer, it keeps us on the defensive.

28:35.312 --> 28:37.373
It keeps us distracted from what really matters.

28:37.433 --> 28:39.174
And then we're not living our best life.

28:40.174 --> 28:59.349
and also the really really tough part is that all this abuse all this trauma has happened in the world and of course it's not new since 2020 but let's say since 2020 what's happened we can all even those of us who are trying to talk about the truth we can get too caught up in focusing on the perpetrators and that's usually a losing battle

29:00.209 --> 29:02.130
The same will happen in the family system.

29:02.550 --> 29:15.075
Even if you get out of that abusive family system, if you spend the rest of your life just trying to point out evidence and trying to point out who the abusers are and trying to convince people who the abusers are, people don't usually want to hear it.

29:15.935 --> 29:16.896
They don't want to know.

29:17.196 --> 29:18.318
Usually they don't believe you.

29:18.358 --> 29:22.922
You know, when you've tried to present evidence of COVID and all the things were going on, people didn't want to see it.

29:23.082 --> 29:25.624
Even as the truth keeps coming out and out and out.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.887
And some people think, oh yeah, the truth is all going to come out.

29:29.187 --> 29:29.868
It's all going to be over.

29:29.948 --> 29:30.709
Everybody's going to wake up.

29:30.729 --> 29:31.850
That's not what's going to happen.

29:32.310 --> 29:34.973
The truth is going to keep coming out and people are going to keep looking away.

29:35.919 --> 29:36.859
most people, right?

29:37.139 --> 29:40.040
More people are going to keep waking up, but most people are just going to look away.

29:40.901 --> 29:41.941
So here's the challenge, right?

29:42.381 --> 29:45.162
Perpetrators are entirely responsible for what they did.

29:45.242 --> 29:48.083
This is not a pass for what they did, right?

29:48.283 --> 29:53.425
But trying to reveal and trying to punish them for what they did, it doesn't solve the systemic problem.

29:54.225 --> 29:57.489
And even when you take down one abuser, like I said, there's a whole hierarchy.

29:58.029 --> 30:00.752
And then there's people who are just like waiting in the shadows.

30:00.812 --> 30:04.156
They can't wait to get into one of those positions on that hierarchy.

30:04.576 --> 30:06.558
And so you take down one, you take down another.

30:06.598 --> 30:07.820
It's like a game of whack-a-mole.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.561
They just keep popping up.

30:10.002 --> 30:10.222
Right.

30:10.282 --> 30:16.769
And it's a distraction from healing, from living our life, from creating positive solutions.

30:16.929 --> 30:24.195
Are you suggesting that if they release the Epstein list, that it's not going to fix all of our problems?

30:24.295 --> 30:26.497
That all the bad guys will just be revealed?

30:27.475 --> 30:30.497
And then we can fire them and replace them and it'll all be great.

30:30.557 --> 30:32.038
I thought that was the key, right?

30:32.078 --> 30:33.419
We just have to get that list.

30:33.820 --> 30:36.702
It's like a carrot, right?

30:36.722 --> 30:37.962
It's like that carrot of hope.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.003
And it keeps you hanging on.

30:39.043 --> 30:39.944
Oh, that'll be the day.

30:40.004 --> 30:46.188
Oh, that'll be the day as soon as that comes out or this comes out or or all the vaccine records, you know, like whatever it is.

30:46.228 --> 30:53.794
But like, for example, think think to when the big stuff was coming about the Catholic Church and all of the sexual abuse that took place.

30:53.814 --> 30:55.175
I mean, it was like a huge thing.

30:55.195 --> 30:55.995
Was that like 10, 15 years ago?

30:57.376 --> 31:04.801
And I thought, oh, this will be the time like everybody wakes up and they stop enabling this cult and they stop enabling the sexual abuse of children.

31:05.221 --> 31:06.422
And people just looked away.

31:07.643 --> 31:15.427
Maybe they talked about it for a few days and maybe at one point there was some lucidity and sobriety in that conversation.

31:15.467 --> 31:18.389
But a week later, it was like Groundhog Day, like it never happened.

31:18.789 --> 31:22.572
And you see the same thing happening as more truth comes out about the COVID stuff.

31:23.252 --> 31:29.421
It's like people maybe will talk about it, but then it disappears, and then most people, it's just like nothing ever happened.

31:30.458 --> 31:31.058
Right.

31:31.179 --> 31:35.421
What would your I mean, let me try to make a micro question here.

31:35.702 --> 31:37.123
I don't know why this is popping in my head.

31:37.183 --> 31:46.269
But if you're if you're talking about the abuse of like a husband, for example, then there is a person that needs the chat would say justice.

31:46.429 --> 31:57.537
A person needs some something should happen where where I don't know, things are put on a scale and things are said and everybody acknowledges that this was wrong and that it's over.

31:59.798 --> 32:13.829
Is there something extra traumatic about maybe being abused by social media personalities that it might not even be all people being abused by an algorithm or the deployment of it?

32:15.330 --> 32:18.872
So I guess in the sense of,

32:20.234 --> 32:42.389
of an abusive husband, it feels to me as though my gut feeling would be that the resolving of the divorce and the, you know, all the friends finding out what he did and whatever helps to also bring the victim back to full functioning, as you would say, and all these higher states of consciousness available to them again.

32:43.129 --> 32:53.119
How does that jive with what you seem to just say there, which is that we should, although these were bad guys, we can't really do anything about it.

32:53.219 --> 32:59.205
We should just kind of not try to get, I don't mean revenge, but how do we differentiate, there's another question.

32:59.245 --> 33:03.369
How do we differentiate justice from revenge and those motivations?

33:04.266 --> 33:05.647
Yeah, these are two different things.

33:05.827 --> 33:13.852
And the really sad thing is even in that situation with like an abusive domestic violence kind of situation, there's very rarely justice.

33:14.693 --> 33:18.115
Every now and then, I mean, I've heard thousands of stories over the year.

33:18.415 --> 33:21.898
Every now and then I'll hear some stories where there's some big miracle.

33:22.578 --> 33:34.866
where the court believes the victim or there's some kind of justice or people in the family system ostracize the abuser instead of the victim, but that rarely happens.

33:35.006 --> 33:47.754
And that's the absolute tragedy of these situations is that most people in that system, and that includes friendships or the family or whatever, most people, the system will defend the system.

33:48.394 --> 34:00.840
and the enablers in that system will defend the abuser or they'll look away because they're so hopelessly dependent on that system for something, whether it's financial, emotional, status, like whatever it is.

34:01.320 --> 34:11.545
So when you come out of those abusive systems or marriages, whatever, you rarely have people from within that system who are allies and you rarely get justice.

34:11.745 --> 34:15.087
And so, yeah, it would be awesome if we took these people to justice.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.689
But if you look at like the Nuremberg trial, what did they hang?

34:18.709 --> 34:20.450
A couple dozen people?

34:20.911 --> 34:23.292
And those weren't even like the top people, right?

34:23.332 --> 34:29.216
Like they just threw up a couple dozen people, you know, in the Nuremberg trial and then things went on.

34:29.256 --> 34:31.378
Like what real justice was that that wasn't?

34:32.098 --> 34:35.241
And so I think probably we're gonna see repetition of that.

34:35.361 --> 34:37.683
And I'm not saying we should just totally forget about it.

34:37.783 --> 34:43.728
It would be awesome if people who work in the justice system like attorneys and whatnot do that, that's their life path.

34:44.188 --> 34:56.238
But what I'm saying is those of us who are coming through this abusive system, we cannot leave the outcome of our healing, of our thriving, of our moving forward

34:57.218 --> 35:02.300
on the necessity to have that justice because it might not happen.

35:02.861 --> 35:08.283
And what happens to most abusive victims is you have to find that closure within yourself.

35:08.803 --> 35:16.506
You have to find the closure and the truth and knowing that truth, you have to validate yourself because you're rarely gonna get that validation from the abusive system.

35:17.106 --> 35:23.409
Now in those family structures, sometimes victims will get, you know, they'll go online, they'll find communities, they'll talk to other people.

35:23.909 --> 35:26.730
who have been abused in their own family systems, right?

35:26.770 --> 35:29.010
And they understand because they went through something similar.

35:29.511 --> 35:31.111
Those become important allies.

35:31.191 --> 35:33.352
That's like those of us talking about what's happening.

35:33.692 --> 35:35.372
We're all waking up in this system.

35:35.412 --> 35:36.213
We're talking about it.

35:36.233 --> 35:41.054
That is so important because as human beings, we have to be able to verify reality together.

35:41.594 --> 35:46.037
Like it's really important to validate ourselves and not rely entirely on that external validation.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.318
That's not healthy, that's very infantile.

35:49.039 --> 35:51.280
And so it's not or, it's not black and white, it's a nuance.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.242
And it's also important that we can verify reality together.

35:54.262 --> 36:01.286
So what I'm saying is we can't hold on to moving on in healing based on like we have to get justice.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.486
I hope one day we do.

36:03.307 --> 36:05.868
And we also have to understand that we might not.

36:06.929 --> 36:08.030
it might not happen, right?

36:08.310 --> 36:12.272
Our powers and our choices, that's the only place we're going to find our power.

36:12.672 --> 36:21.317
One of the chat people said, so when the government is the abuser, and maybe that speaks to something of what you're saying is that we are

36:22.297 --> 36:27.302
What we have just recently experienced is a bunch of people thinking that they're voting their way out of it, right?

36:27.342 --> 36:31.186
That they're voting their way to a better life or a better future.

36:31.226 --> 36:33.889
And now they can go back to Netflix because they did their thing.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.791
So maybe you can take that.

36:36.892 --> 36:39.194
And I don't know, maybe that makes sense in this sense, too.

36:40.100 --> 36:40.541
Totally.

36:40.981 --> 36:48.531
And also I forgot to comment on what you were talking about beyond just the interpersonal aspect, but like online and like, is it AI?

36:48.591 --> 36:49.832
Is it anonymous accounts?

36:49.873 --> 36:51.294
You know, all of these things online.

36:51.775 --> 36:54.619
That's even more difficult because it's so intangible.

36:54.659 --> 36:57.823
Like there isn't even like a human there or there isn't a face there and like,

36:58.223 --> 37:01.766
First of all, any anonymous account, they're not showing their name.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.328
They're not showing their face.

37:03.368 --> 37:04.889
That's already a red flag.

37:05.310 --> 37:13.097
And most of the trolls online are anonymous because they don't want to show who they are.

37:13.117 --> 37:19.543
To me, it's one of those things where anytime I hear someone blame the algorithm, I get a little upset, though, because I think

37:22.080 --> 37:42.748
I think a lot of what's happening with regard to AI is trying to give the listener the idea that there is a software or a program that does stuff that the creators of it have no real responsibility for because we just made an algorithm and told it what to do and now these are the consequences of it.

37:45.089 --> 37:54.841
The most egregious example of this is what's being done, I think, in Israel right now, where some of these attacks are actually directed by AI.

37:55.362 --> 38:02.090
And then if the wrong person is hit, they say, well, you know, the AI is the one who said that that target was a high probability target.

38:02.750 --> 38:17.857
And so I think that what is often being done with this rhetoric is that they try to offload the responsibility or the perceived sort of the forces at play onto the algorithm or the AI, when in reality, if they want

38:19.098 --> 38:22.562
Meredith Miller to be invisible on the internet, they actually just type that in.

38:22.802 --> 38:30.310
And if they want, I don't know, someone else to rise because they're about to nominate that person for some position, then they have them rise.

38:30.390 --> 38:33.633
And it's not an AI that they have no control over.

38:33.673 --> 38:35.515
It's a program that they have full control over.

38:36.454 --> 38:37.816
Yeah, it's human engineers.

38:37.976 --> 38:38.476
Yeah, right.

38:38.557 --> 38:39.778
Programmed AI.

38:40.679 --> 38:46.706
You know, it's so funny, though, how how they they just completely erase any responsibility for that.

38:47.166 --> 38:54.395
So years ago, I went to this YouTube training when you hit a certain amount of followers on YouTube or subscribers, they send you to this training and it's like indoctrination.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.796
And I was already feeling like,

38:56.437 --> 38:58.617
Like there's tension inside to go, but I had to go.

38:58.657 --> 38:59.358
I just knew I had to go.

38:59.598 --> 39:02.718
And they start educating you about the ecosystem of YouTube.

39:02.738 --> 39:05.279
And they tell you that there's three entities in the ecosystem.

39:05.779 --> 39:12.600
The viewer, the person watching the video, the creator, that's you making the video, and the advertiser, the person who pays for the ads.

39:13.040 --> 39:18.481
And if your video is not fully monetized, the algorithm automatically does not suggest you.

39:18.501 --> 39:22.422
They don't give you that top real estate, which gets you suggested videos.

39:22.482 --> 39:23.442
And I said, whoa.

39:24.873 --> 39:27.315
Something's missing in this ecosystem here.

39:27.335 --> 39:27.796
Let's talk.

39:27.816 --> 39:31.719
Oh, ironically, these are the aspects that YouTube has full control over.

39:32.199 --> 39:33.781
That would be the human engineers.

39:34.381 --> 39:36.763
And that would be the algorithm which they program.

39:36.783 --> 39:39.145
But how funny the whole thing is set up to blame you.

39:39.365 --> 39:40.767
Oh, if your videos aren't doing good.

39:40.927 --> 39:42.188
Oh, people don't want to watch them.

39:42.348 --> 39:43.129
Oh, advertise them.

39:43.329 --> 39:44.310
It's your fault.

39:44.430 --> 39:44.590
Yeah.

39:44.870 --> 39:45.991
It has nothing to do with us.

39:46.071 --> 39:47.493
So yeah, that's really gross.

39:47.513 --> 39:50.976
We're being gaslit by the AI and by humans.

39:51.016 --> 39:55.780
But it's important, as JJ said, to remember, the AI is programmed by humans.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.722
It is written into the code.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.203
So that's really key.

39:59.484 --> 40:03.227
But then back to this whole, OK, now we have this political flip.

40:03.247 --> 40:05.729
The pendulum is swinging from one side to the other.

40:05.829 --> 40:06.890
So what is this doing?

40:07.671 --> 40:18.214
So unfortunately, I think it is using hope to numb out the resistance that was building during these years, during the COVID years.

40:18.314 --> 40:20.534
And so what happens is like hope is a good thing.

40:20.574 --> 40:21.655
I'm not saying hope is bad.

40:21.695 --> 40:23.795
Remember, we're talking about nuances.

40:23.875 --> 40:25.836
It's not black and white thinking.

40:26.676 --> 40:26.856
right?

40:26.996 --> 40:29.197
But hope can also be used against us.

40:29.337 --> 40:32.197
And hope is used in every abusive situation.

40:32.217 --> 40:33.958
JJ and I talked about this last time.

40:33.998 --> 40:40.419
It's part of the Stockholm syndrome, the state of captivity, perceived acts of kindness that includes hope.

40:40.919 --> 40:43.279
And so an abuser will always dose hope.

40:43.379 --> 40:50.721
That could be future faking, you know, one day we're going to do this, one day I'm going to change, one day, you know, it'll all be good kind of thing.

40:51.241 --> 41:00.429
That's a tactic to numb the target's critical mind and to gain compliance from the target because now the target's working harder, right?

41:00.469 --> 41:04.833
They're investing more because they're like, oh, we're finally going to get what we want, right?

41:04.893 --> 41:06.434
Despite all the harm being done.

41:06.815 --> 41:08.897
And then you start to block out

41:09.477 --> 41:29.014
all those hypocrisies like all that other stuff that's going on all the other red flags that we're seeing I'm already seeing people who are so awake during the COVID thing they're already starting to rationalize and go into the cognitive dissonance and like I'm seeing how that hope is already become becoming toxic

41:29.614 --> 41:46.981
you know it's really it's Charlie Brown and Lucy and the football and it's Charlie like this will finally be it's Thanksgiving she can't take it away it's Thanksgiving right it's always like this will be the time so we really have to be mindful of where are we placing where are we investing our hope

41:47.721 --> 41:47.881
right?

41:47.941 --> 41:54.023
Because the hope in a rescue fantasy, so many people have a rescue fantasy now on the left and the right, right?

41:54.063 --> 41:57.684
Like everybody has, there's a, there's a, there's a psi op for everybody.

41:58.304 --> 42:08.227
So the rescue fantasy I'm seeing right now with all the, the flip of this pendulum now is that people are like, Oh, these are, these are going to people going to be the people that are going to,

42:08.827 --> 42:21.086
get rid of everything toxic in our food supply, they're going to get rid of these toxic vaccines, they're going to release all the information, they're going to stop the wars, everything is going to be made better now just because that's what they're telling us.

42:21.467 --> 42:22.989
I would love to see good things happen.

42:23.109 --> 42:24.131
I'm not saying that's bad.

42:24.711 --> 42:25.972
But where is your power?

42:26.032 --> 42:27.432
Your power is in your choice.

42:27.872 --> 42:31.193
If you don't like to eat toxins, don't buy toxic food.

42:31.473 --> 42:32.434
Buy organic food.

42:32.574 --> 42:36.955
Buy from local organic farmers who use regenerative farming.

42:37.556 --> 42:38.336
Support that.

42:38.376 --> 42:40.657
If you don't like toxic vaccines, don't take them.

42:41.157 --> 42:42.357
That's your choice.

42:42.417 --> 42:44.438
That is the only place you're going to find power.

42:44.878 --> 42:58.323
So where ought to we invest our hope is in our own healing process, in the hope that if I don't like my life situation, I don't like what's going on, I can make different choices and thereby get different results.

42:58.564 --> 42:59.444
I can have hope in that.

42:59.964 --> 43:00.104
Right?

43:00.144 --> 43:01.946
That's a good place to invest my hope.

43:02.146 --> 43:02.726
And you know what?

43:02.806 --> 43:09.892
I'm not, let's say I go through an abusive experience or I go through a traumatic experience and I realize I'm not feeling the way that I want to feel.

43:09.992 --> 43:12.014
I can have hope that I can heal from that.

43:12.414 --> 43:14.056
Those are good places to invest hope.

43:14.376 --> 43:18.119
But when we externalize our power, that's how they trick us.

43:18.179 --> 43:25.965
They bait us into giving away our sovereignty, into giving away our inner authority, into giving away our power to external sources.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.707
And the result is going to be the same.

43:29.514 --> 43:36.082
What do you, as a neuroscientist, and I should say neurobiologist, I hate the word neuroscience.

43:37.144 --> 43:45.414
As a neurobiologist, I always anthropomorphized the behavior of my mice, thinking about what motivated them.

43:46.355 --> 44:01.266
And when discussing this with colleagues, a lot of times we would generalize to the stress of the animal basically having to have some linear relationship with the amount of uncertainty in its life.

44:01.906 --> 44:08.131
So the more regimented the schedule of light is and the availability of food and water,

44:08.769 --> 44:11.030
the more predictable their cage mates are.

44:12.050 --> 44:16.231
You know, you don't want to have a bunch of dominance relationships changing all the time.

44:17.192 --> 44:20.573
All of these things contribute to the well-being of the animal.

44:20.653 --> 44:30.996
But if you were to boil it down to one word, neuroscience might say that it's uncertainty, that the brain is actually wired to try and make predictions about the future.

44:31.036 --> 44:34.617
And the better the predictions are, the more comfortable we feel in our own shoes.

44:36.498 --> 44:44.883
Does that help at all in terms of, I mean, is that a valid thing in your field or to think about how they might've weaponized that against us?

44:44.923 --> 44:57.890
I guess maybe a good transition now because you had mentioned in the little chat we had before the show that they, did you say militarized fear or they weaponized it?

44:57.990 --> 44:59.431
Yeah, they weaponized the fear.

45:00.391 --> 45:02.092
I'm absolutely certain that they did.

45:04.266 --> 45:10.450
Maybe we can talk a little bit about that, the fear and how uncertainty also contributes to that anxiety.

45:10.490 --> 45:24.018
I mean, and that word also, I think a lot of times people don't understand that you don't have to be afraid so much as just the idea that you're not sure if you can pay rent in two weeks is

45:25.336 --> 45:28.661
is also qualifies as this kind of feeling.

45:29.562 --> 45:29.902
Yeah.

45:30.383 --> 45:37.332
So I think, you know, some psychologists will say that we do need some uncertainty so that we grow, right?

45:37.373 --> 45:41.558
That like a little bit of stress is good because it forces us to evolve and grow.

45:42.219 --> 45:43.219
So that's a good thing.

45:43.399 --> 45:55.404
But this kind of uncertainty where it's like there's so much being thrown at you and all this fear and all this uncertainty about the future, that's collapsing of our nervous system.

45:55.424 --> 45:58.965
And really that uncertainty, what's behind that is the fear, the fear of what's coming.

45:59.545 --> 46:04.187
And I see so many people paralyzed in that uncertainty because it's just too much.

46:05.547 --> 46:07.188
Yeah, I, uh,

46:08.439 --> 46:29.600
I really feel like one of the craziest things that climate change is actually doing to young people, people that are not old enough to have the perspective that you and I both probably do, that there are some people that have been convinced that in a decade, everything could be dead or whatever.

46:29.660 --> 46:29.960
I don't know.

46:31.104 --> 46:35.310
And that level of uncertainty is really hard for me to fathom.

46:36.451 --> 46:46.004
When I was in high school, I certainly was, at least on the longest time horizon, I was already thinking about, you know, when I was retired, what I would be doing.

46:46.725 --> 46:51.968
You know, I was even making jokes about the drugs that I was going to save for retirement and this kind of thing.

46:52.008 --> 47:00.872
And so, I don't know, for me, as a young person, I just remember thinking very differently and certainly I wasn't worried about the world ending.

47:02.032 --> 47:10.798
And now it seems as though we are being regularly told that, well, you know, the old way of nukes is still possible because we're poking a bear over there.

47:11.419 --> 47:15.201
And the new way of viruses is possible because it just almost happened.

47:15.661 --> 47:17.663
And then climate change is coming.

47:17.703 --> 47:21.125
So, I mean, oh my gosh, I mean, how many different ways is it going to happen?

47:21.165 --> 47:25.488
The sun can also have some kind of event apparently that'll burn half the earth.

47:25.928 --> 47:27.429
And so for me,

47:28.510 --> 47:31.956
This part of it has really become absurd.

47:34.452 --> 47:37.855
It's angering because I have three kids.

47:38.595 --> 47:41.077
It is just absolutely angering.

47:42.638 --> 47:47.082
I heard I heard a psychologist a few months ago in a course that I was taking.

47:47.682 --> 47:51.165
She, I think, is part of the American Psychology.

47:52.025 --> 47:52.686
What is that called?

47:53.627 --> 47:55.888
Whatever their APA, I think it's called.

47:56.509 --> 47:59.131
They have a committee on climate science.

47:59.871 --> 48:18.084
And so she was talking about how the man-made fossil fuel driven climate change is really causing all this mental illness in which she said the number one most important thing, in fact I think I have it right here, she said the number one most important thing is believing climate scientists.

48:18.524 --> 48:22.065
I'm like, wow, it's COVID campaign number 2.0.

48:22.525 --> 48:22.805
Right.

48:22.985 --> 48:27.606
And like, literally, that's what they're doing is they're collapsing people into this fear.

48:27.626 --> 48:29.567
In fact, they even brought viruses in there.

48:29.587 --> 48:40.289
I wish I could remember where that was in my notes, but she even brought it in there that somehow climate change is like, it increases, you know, contagious viruses and things like this, like

48:40.569 --> 48:41.589
Oh, it definitely does.

48:41.669 --> 49:00.337
I think EcoHealth Alliance was already saying, actually, that that was part of why there was 1.7 million viruses waiting to jump in 2020, was because climate change was increasing their abundance, but also increasing our interaction with that barrier, you know, where these viruses jump from all the time.

49:00.517 --> 49:01.698
It was an extraordinary

49:03.095 --> 49:04.996
And so why is this in the APA?

49:05.036 --> 49:06.157
Why is this part of psychology?

49:06.177 --> 49:07.737
Because it's behavior change.

49:08.458 --> 49:20.544
It's the behavior science that they're trying to push the behavior change, which is why they got basically the whole psychology institution to do the whole propaganda for COVID.

49:20.564 --> 49:29.589
There were very few people who spoke out because they were terrified of losing their license if they did, or most of them were just completely into that indoctrination.

49:30.749 --> 49:31.070
But why?

49:31.110 --> 49:33.791
Because they want to control the behavior of people.

49:34.332 --> 49:44.838
In fact, there was a memo that a bunch of like the top world renowned trauma trauma experts co-signed on this memo to the Biden administration.

49:44.858 --> 49:46.019
I think it was 2021.

49:46.960 --> 49:52.203
And basically it was about how to talk to trauma survivors who are vaccine hesitant.

49:52.803 --> 50:00.388
And the whole thing was so evil because they're preying upon the trust wound that all trauma survivors have.

50:00.488 --> 50:03.430
And trauma survivors need to learn to trust themselves again.

50:03.470 --> 50:04.251
They don't trust anything.

50:04.291 --> 50:05.191
They don't trust themselves.

50:05.631 --> 50:06.712
They don't trust in the creator.

50:06.752 --> 50:09.254
They don't trust other people because how could this have happened, right?

50:09.774 --> 50:14.158
And so they're working in therapy and whatever they're doing to build that sense of self-trust.

50:14.618 --> 50:30.972
And then they're completely abusing that by trying to talk to them about, well, yeah, of course you have medical trauma or you have racial trauma or you have this trauma and that trauma, but really you should trust us because we're the experts and you should just get vaccinated.

50:31.092 --> 50:35.675
So it was just unbelievable to see how all of this is being weaponized against us.

50:36.636 --> 50:42.141
in every campaign, it's not just the COVID, it's the same playbook that's being used in every campaign.

50:42.301 --> 50:48.807
Now it seems like the climate thing, like how many areas are getting completely destroyed by flooding right now?

50:48.927 --> 50:57.435
And then you see these videos and there's like, seems to be manipulation of the weather happening that's causing that flood to sit on these areas and destroy.

50:57.455 --> 51:02.660
I mean, it was North Carolina, it was Sicily the other day, it was Saudi Arabia.

51:03.340 --> 51:04.861
And Spain was really horrible.

51:05.321 --> 51:10.123
And so when you listen to the media, they're like, this is climate change and it's going to get worse.

51:10.243 --> 51:17.267
And you hear Ursula von der Leyen up there in the EU, like, oh, you know, we could, we're just going to have to send in our help because we got to get used to this.

51:17.287 --> 51:19.027
This is just going to keep happening and worse.

51:19.528 --> 51:21.088
They're horribly traumatizing people.

51:21.128 --> 51:26.191
And like you, you have kids, people, our parents are wondering, you know, how do I help my kids from this?

51:26.311 --> 51:28.492
Because they're being exposed to this constant

51:29.252 --> 51:35.895
propaganda and then kids who go to school system, they'll come home and they'll tell their parents, you know, whatever story propaganda they're hearing.

51:36.195 --> 51:39.837
And then they're mad at the parent because the parents like, well, that that doesn't seem to be true.

51:39.877 --> 51:41.458
It doesn't seem to be based on science.

51:42.038 --> 51:46.541
But because of that peer pressure at school, the kids are getting indoctrinated into that.

51:47.381 --> 51:53.988
And that fear, that weaponized fear, it becomes it basically it corrupts the human operating system, right?

51:54.028 --> 51:56.971
That's our neurological system is our operating system.

51:56.991 --> 52:03.037
And, you know, it's binary, just like, you know, the the technological operating systems that we use.

52:03.097 --> 52:07.881
We created the biology in the image of our we created the technology in the image of our biology.

52:08.562 --> 52:08.722
Right.

52:08.742 --> 52:11.603
So that fear, what it does is it shuts down the nervous system.

52:11.664 --> 52:14.105
It locks us in those states of defensiveness.

52:14.505 --> 52:18.307
Then we don't have access to the emotional attachment system.

52:18.827 --> 52:23.029
And then we don't have access to our higher, our higher consciousness.

52:23.489 --> 52:24.490
I'm scratching your dog.

52:28.251 --> 52:29.652
Yeah, it's it's for me.

52:30.953 --> 52:33.174
I have to I think I said this in the pre chat.

52:33.194 --> 52:35.155
I apologize if I already said it on the video.

52:36.829 --> 52:47.916
that I actually am certain that for nearly two and a half years, I was exactly what I am trying to save people from being now.

52:48.957 --> 53:01.105
I was engaged fully on social media, thinking that despite the best attempt of the government to stop the information, the information was still getting out.

53:01.165 --> 53:03.907
And I was one of the people that was working hard enough to find it.

53:04.987 --> 53:11.974
And I think I was really actively manipulated for a very, very long time into accepting a role.

53:13.215 --> 53:17.739
And if I would have accepted that role, I'd probably be a little more comfortable than I am now.

53:19.200 --> 53:23.324
But it was always, I'm not really sure.

53:23.344 --> 53:27.828
I guess it was because I was always just trying to learn the biology.

53:28.539 --> 53:33.843
and I never really, whatever they were trying to get me to accept never really was an endpoint yet.

53:35.424 --> 53:36.525
I hadn't figured it out yet.

53:36.545 --> 53:38.346
I was sure I hadn't figured it out yet.

53:38.386 --> 53:39.767
So why are you telling me to stop now?

53:41.188 --> 53:54.438
And that, so that's, it's weird because what the Robert Malone video did was kind of, in a way, wake me up to how, you know,

53:56.206 --> 54:12.918
how easily, even if I myself wasn't, or was aware of rather, was aware of what was happening and trying to categorize it, tell everybody so that I could share my experience, how easily it could be used against me, both

54:13.718 --> 54:33.511
both just like you said with a disingenuous edit, but more importantly if I think back to all the off-air time, all the time with my kids, all the time that time is also polluted by this anxiety that was created through the

54:34.815 --> 54:47.242
I don't know, it's a combination of maybe embarrassment and frustration, and why aren't these people listening to me, and I'm right first, and I had it right a long time ago, why don't you tell me that I had it right?

54:48.862 --> 54:57.607
These kinds of traps are pretty easy to fall into if you accept that social media is some kind of useful communication medium.

54:59.214 --> 55:01.575
that you can make friends there or date or whatever.

55:01.595 --> 55:08.500
I don't know what I was thinking, but I was treating it as though if it was just me in a bar and seeing the same people in the bar over and over.

55:08.560 --> 55:14.945
And as you said earlier, which I really liked a lot, we have to verify reality together.

55:14.985 --> 55:20.649
And social media creates the illusion of doing that, but you're actually not at all doing that.

55:21.530 --> 55:26.574
And in fact, you might be verifying a false reality with other people who are doing it to you on purpose.

55:28.372 --> 55:30.973
I really like that phrase a lot to verify reality together.

55:31.013 --> 55:32.713
That's what scientists were supposed to be doing.

55:32.753 --> 55:33.674
But of course, they're not.

55:35.794 --> 55:36.014
Yeah.

55:36.294 --> 55:41.175
Leaving social media was one of the best investments in my mental health that I've ever made.

55:41.295 --> 55:44.276
I got off Facebook, Instagram, like around I think it was the end of 2021.

55:44.316 --> 55:46.016
I don't even remember now.

55:46.077 --> 55:46.717
It's been so long.

55:47.477 --> 55:48.217
I had no idea.

55:48.697 --> 55:51.958
We don't realize when we're in that, like how much it programs our nervous system.

55:52.939 --> 56:11.177
in a very very insidious way because you don't even realize and also how it teaches us to like instantly judge something that somebody says like somebody says something and like and I'm not saying I'm immune to that but like there's like this instant I want to fight that I want to I want to say no no no like like you were talking about right like I know right and wrong

56:11.858 --> 56:20.742
We all have these these what we call these pitfalls of the ego where, you know, we all could fall into those traps.

56:20.783 --> 56:23.184
So it's good that we continually self-examine.

56:24.064 --> 56:29.467
But getting off those sites was such a good investment in my mental health for so many reasons.

56:30.347 --> 56:38.691
and continually talking, talking to people who wanna hear, but not trying to convince people who don't wanna know or whatever.

56:38.811 --> 56:47.554
And also continually reevaluating my own beliefs, my own perspectives, because maybe I'm wrong on some things too.

56:48.435 --> 56:55.858
And how people can get used as pawns in that, one, when we don't even know that what we're saying is a lie,

56:56.658 --> 57:08.086
But then as we were talking earlier, I think maybe before we started recording was how different people and groups of people can get kind of funneled into these campaigns or who knows who's funding that.

57:08.487 --> 57:18.474
But it does seem to be like there's like a billionaire class that is funding like a whole lot of different campaigns and they'll fund both sides of everything because you always win when you fund both sides.

57:18.994 --> 57:36.857
but basically it's like that the whole all the narratives are are kind of being controlled in some kind of way from the top and so sometimes people are knowingly actively enabling that and maybe because they think they're right or maybe because they got tricked into it

57:37.458 --> 57:39.179
through the weapon of flattery.

57:39.439 --> 57:43.522
There's a fantastic book called Outwitting the Devil by Napoleon Hill.

57:43.722 --> 57:45.042
I highly recommend people read this.

57:45.463 --> 57:52.447
Basically, he's having an imaginary conversation with the devil to understand the tactics of the dark forces used to control humanity.

57:53.107 --> 57:55.549
And there's this part on flattery, I have it here.

57:55.889 --> 58:02.092
He says, flattery is a bait of incomparable value to all who wish to gain control over others.

58:02.653 --> 58:09.797
It has powerful pulling qualities because it operates through two of the most common human weaknesses, vanity and egotism.

58:10.437 --> 58:13.039
There's a certain amount of vanity and egotism in everyone.

58:13.339 --> 58:19.262
In some people, these qualities are so pronounced, they may literally serve as a rope by which one may be bound.

58:19.763 --> 58:21.524
The best of all ropes is flattery.

58:22.424 --> 58:23.965
So we ought to be cautious of that.

58:23.985 --> 58:27.168
I think some people get pulled into those roles based on flattery.

58:27.188 --> 58:28.649
Are you going to be a hero?

58:28.669 --> 58:30.711
Are you going to be the next like big thing?

58:30.731 --> 58:31.992
Don't you want to make a difference?

58:32.032 --> 58:33.073
You could be special.

58:33.814 --> 58:34.134
Right.

58:34.214 --> 58:35.395
And I definitely was.

58:35.675 --> 58:36.496
I definitely was.

58:37.076 --> 58:41.160
I have a I have a hard question.

58:41.180 --> 58:45.964
I don't know if it's something you've thought about before, but but in retrospect, in 2020.

58:49.033 --> 59:04.289
If what I'm saying is true and what a lot of other people have said before me is true and that this was probably not a pandemic that went through white-tailed deer and all this other stuff, what

59:09.622 --> 59:23.265
What is the, I mean, maybe a better question, have you ever, have you ever heard of this game with werewolves, where these people are, are the hidden, the hidden bad guys and then you're sitting in a corner and you're supposed to vote people out and

59:24.920 --> 59:35.489
Anyway, the point is that there's a number of different games, there's a number of different experiments where, you know, the Milgram experiment and the other one where it's basically people are lying.

59:35.529 --> 59:41.814
They're pretending to answer a question wrong, or they're pretending to agree, or they think they're shocking somebody.

59:41.874 --> 59:43.215
And so there is this

59:44.056 --> 01:00:01.733
an illusion of consensus gets created where the the experimenter is lying to the person and and also the maybe the person who's who's supposed pretending to be also part of the experiment is lying to that person so if if you as a psychologist were going to try and do this

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:09.236
would it seem to me that the best thing would be to just have people ready?

01:00:10.016 --> 01:00:10.997
To have people ready?

01:00:11.157 --> 01:00:14.718
You just said a minute ago that they seem to be controlling the narrative.

01:00:15.238 --> 01:00:31.586
So if they were gonna pull this off in 2020, it seems like they would have had to put people on the internet in 2019 and get them all ready with their podcasts and then have them have little pieces of the puzzle that they could wave around and say, hey, look at me, I know what's going on.

01:00:32.649 --> 01:00:38.373
And as long as all of those pieces of the puzzle were rolled out at the right timing, right?

01:00:38.433 --> 01:00:51.382
With the right opposition over there or the right, you know, oh no, not, you know, Rand Paul and Tony Fauci could do it, but also somebody like Brett Weinstein and Joe Rogan could do it and put these ideas out there.

01:00:51.422 --> 01:00:55.665
And then no matter which way you go in the internet, you stumble over this thing called ivermectin.

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:59.687
And it seems like everybody agrees that it's something that everybody should have in their,

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:01.708
medicine cabinet.

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:12.392
And so for me, the frightening thing is what you just said, which is what if there isn't any truth available on social media?

01:01:12.432 --> 01:01:24.236
What if essentially you and I having this conversation is one thing, but you and I finding each other on social media doesn't happen, won't happen, never will, because it's not possible there.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.543
And so, I mean, how many other Meredith Millers have you met in the course of the pandemic?

01:01:30.964 --> 01:01:37.007
There must be someone out there that has a similar tact on things.

01:01:37.087 --> 01:01:41.170
I've never met another biologist that also says, you know what?

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:45.753
I think this RNA thing is crazy because DNA is supposed to be magic.

01:01:45.793 --> 01:01:47.174
So how can RNA be magic?

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.875
And no one else, I've never met anyone.

01:01:49.935 --> 01:01:51.796
And so have you met anyone?

01:01:54.468 --> 01:01:59.510
you know, that's trying to pull on the same ropes as you or trying to help people in the same way?

01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:01.911
No, not exactly.

01:02:02.872 --> 01:02:13.137
Though, you know, we were talking about the truth and stuff and like that's one of the dark forces tactics is a drop of truth or some truth and a whole bunch of lies around it.

01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:21.681
And so that's what we have to be able to hold the nuance and use the discernment to decipher out like what feels like truth.

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.542
then use our analytical skills to verify, does this appear to be true, right?

01:02:26.602 --> 01:02:30.504
And not just take the whole package as one, right?

01:02:30.804 --> 01:02:32.664
Each of us are humans, we're all fallible.

01:02:32.864 --> 01:02:35.265
We may say some things that are true and some things that are not true.

01:02:35.305 --> 01:02:37.986
We might fully believe that all of that's true.

01:02:38.306 --> 01:02:40.207
It may not be deceptive.

01:02:40.567 --> 01:02:42.428
It's interesting too, you were talking about 2019.

01:02:42.488 --> 01:02:49.370
I talked to somebody who lived in Sedona and she said in 2019, she was part of like the freedom movement or whatever you want to call it.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:03:13.535
she said actually it started in 2019 she said in 2019 we had this community and all of a sudden there were these infiltrators way before anybody heard of covid 2019 and i was like whoa that just like gave me chills because i was like they did plan that just like you said long in advance and probably it happened on the internet too we just weren't paying attention because we were paying attention to whatever donald trump or whatever you know they were driving

01:03:14.535 --> 01:03:15.235
Absolutely.

01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:17.597
I think, I mean, yes, absolutely.

01:03:17.637 --> 01:03:22.399
We were still thinking that Bernie Sanders might get to be the nominee and stuff like that.

01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:24.940
I mean, absolutely, absolutely.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:35.705
I mean, there's a lot of these people who have been in front of the Senate, whose podcasts did start in 2019, like at the end of 2019.

01:03:36.265 --> 01:03:40.467
There's a lot of them now that have gone from, you know,

01:03:41.437 --> 01:03:52.722
Nowhere to having a podcast, to being censored and then being uncensored and then getting a Tucker Carlson appearance where they get to complain about being demonetized.

01:03:52.802 --> 01:04:02.826
And it's, it's extraordinary really, if you think about it, how easy it is for them to make it seem like somebody is just kind of spontaneously rising because they had a good thing to say.

01:04:03.766 --> 01:04:05.187
Um, when, uh,

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:06.500
Yeah.

01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:11.603
Now we, we, I just, I still can't believe they're doing it.

01:04:11.623 --> 01:04:14.624
I mean, last night there was a little microcosm of this.

01:04:15.045 --> 01:04:25.890
Um, and I hope that when I, when I tell you what I stayed up late last night to watch, you will have no idea that it happened, but you're in Texas, right?

01:04:26.651 --> 01:04:34.755
I'm in Oklahoma now, Oklahoma now, because every, every twice now in this interview, you've slipped just a brief, I heard an accent, but, um,

01:04:36.512 --> 01:04:39.796
In Texas, I think it was in Dallas last night, Mike Tyson had a fight.

01:04:40.036 --> 01:04:40.476
You remember?

01:04:40.496 --> 01:04:41.077
Do you know that?

01:04:41.257 --> 01:04:42.538
I heard Arlington.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:42.979
Yeah.

01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:46.002
And it was exactly what you could imagine it was.

01:04:46.062 --> 01:04:47.964
I think it was just an elaborate stunt.

01:04:48.004 --> 01:04:50.026
You know, everybody makes money.

01:04:50.106 --> 01:04:50.947
Everybody's happy.

01:04:51.047 --> 01:04:52.568
Nobody risked anything.

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:56.933
And it was a big media thing where it went back and forth.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.014
It really felt like you were

01:04:58.806 --> 01:05:05.430
You were, everybody bet money on Mike Tyson, you know, and all the betting apps were available and all this other stuff.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:11.954
But again, it's one of these things where on TV, they have fake wrestling, everything's fine with it.

01:05:12.054 --> 01:05:14.536
They have fake boxing, everything is fine with it.

01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:18.938
They have fake talk shows, and as long as they don't talk about anything important, who cares?

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:19.479
It's fine.

01:05:20.059 --> 01:05:20.939
Sunscreen, yes.

01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:21.800
Sunscreen, no.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.620
Who gives a darn?

01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:26.503
But what I think is so extraordinary

01:05:27.794 --> 01:05:33.496
is that somehow or another, I went into the pandemic believing they would never do anything like that about something serious.

01:05:34.796 --> 01:05:39.437
Like, you know, maybe marital affairs, they lie about that, but they would never lie about biology.

01:05:39.757 --> 01:05:40.657
That would be crazy.

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:47.979
And that's the part for me that is, it's still part of my growth path.

01:05:48.059 --> 01:05:54.261
I still feel like now really what, how I get myself out of this is really to learn

01:05:55.498 --> 01:06:17.395
Verify reality with with my fellow biologists and and make sure that that I don't pass this mythology onto my kids that I don't leave my kids You know, I guess my parents bequeathed me the the newspapers and the TV and the NIH and and the Senate and and

01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:29.403
I don't know, maybe even Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi, because they were there when our parents were there, and they were still there when we were adults, and we all just were like, oh, well.

01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:32.004
But in reality, that shouldn't have happened.

01:06:32.044 --> 01:06:34.766
That just should have been a very big red flag for us.

01:06:36.027 --> 01:06:39.029
And so I was just naive like the rest of us, I think.

01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:43.652
I just had no idea that they would lie about as much as they possibly could.

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:45.993
I think that's the best way to characterize it.

01:06:46.033 --> 01:06:48.994
They will lie about as much as they possibly can.

01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:58.119
And in the case of global governance and the potential to do it, I think they would lie about everything that they can get away with.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:11.385
Yeah, I guess that for me is where this what to do about it next comes in, because I still feel compelled to try and

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.993
I don't know, shed light in different parts of the cave so that people can see it again.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.795
And I don't want people to forget.

01:07:19.915 --> 01:07:26.301
I'm afraid that right now social media also creates this thing where our time horizons are very, very short.

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:31.165
We're only thinking about tonight or tomorrow or maybe next week, but

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:52.227
we're not really thinking about next month or we're not thinking about how to make our job better or where we're gonna, I just, for me, that's also been a real awakening to try and get myself to stop thinking on the timeframe that social media wanted me and had me thinking on with this really short attention span and most importantly, no planning at all.

01:07:53.307 --> 01:08:00.150
All of these things I think are really consequences of that occupation of our mind.

01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:04.943
I don't know, I had a question there and then it didn't come out.

01:08:06.747 --> 01:08:12.249
It is hard, I think, to like you were talking about the youngsters, you know, when we were growing up, we were getting out of college.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:13.649
It's like, what's your five year plan?

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.030
What's your 10 year plan?

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:22.532
And it is really hard to have a five year plan right now, because how do you know what the world is going to look like five years from now?

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:26.953
Even all of that aside, that just happened.

01:08:27.113 --> 01:08:34.736
But like in terms of the technology and how we're like getting into like the vertical part of the curve, you know, where things are happening so quickly,

01:08:35.456 --> 01:08:39.601
We really don't know what the world is going to look like in five years.

01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:40.261
Do you think they do?

01:08:40.882 --> 01:08:41.663
Do you think they do?

01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:52.654
Do you think that we're really just on a script and it feels like it's a roller coaster, but in reality, all these other people are just like, okay, so 45 minutes from now, the next thing's coming and they know.

01:08:52.775 --> 01:08:53.916
And so they're not really worried.

01:08:53.936 --> 01:08:55.417
They just have to fake being worried.

01:08:55.538 --> 01:08:55.738
I mean,

01:08:56.918 --> 01:09:03.061
I think they have their scripts and their plans, but they're also just humans like we are.

01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:14.166
And there's so many things that are out of our control, like the sun, like the earth, like things that are happening that are out of our control, or even just the element of shock and surprise.

01:09:14.246 --> 01:09:22.569
I don't know if you give any credence to astrology, but we're now entering, as of a few days from now, Pluto is moving into Aquarius for the next 20 years.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:24.430
We've had a little bit of glimpse of this here and there.

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:26.091
since the spring of 23.

01:09:27.252 --> 01:09:33.818
But the next 20 years with Pluto and Aquarius, like, we're just gonna see shocking... Wait, is that good for Aquarius or bad for Aquarius?

01:09:34.878 --> 01:09:36.459
So it's transformational.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.940
So it depends how you deal with it.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:45.104
Do you evolve and transform and how do you flow with the surprising changes that are coming?

01:09:45.124 --> 01:09:46.484
It could be amazing, right?

01:09:46.624 --> 01:09:50.046
Or it could just crush you if you avoid it.

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:52.107
And then for everybody else, it doesn't matter?

01:09:52.127 --> 01:09:53.668
And I'm not being a creep.

01:09:53.768 --> 01:09:54.589
It matters for everybody.

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:56.850
It matters for all of us.

01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.932
And so we all have a Pluto placement in our charts.

01:10:01.012 --> 01:10:06.314
And one astrologer, Stephen Forrest, he says, Pluto can also be our navigational error.

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:07.555
It's transformation, all that.

01:10:07.575 --> 01:10:16.980
But it could also be our navigational error, like putting a metal can next to a compass and your boat starts going one degree in the wrong way and you don't notice it.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.541
But before long, you're in a whole other different place.

01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:20.822
in the ocean.

01:10:21.442 --> 01:10:28.107
But the Pluto in Aquarius, it's also like a generational, it's also like the large societal things because these are the long shifts.

01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:32.349
And so we just went through that Pluto and Capricorn from 2008 until now.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:43.357
And Capricorn is all about the systems, the structure, the power in the world, governments, corporations, all of that is collapsing and like drastically changing, even like the money system.

01:10:43.997 --> 01:10:45.338
is massively changing.

01:10:45.378 --> 01:10:49.279
And the last time, you know, it takes almost 250 years, the last time was 1778.

01:10:50.399 --> 01:10:52.300
And we can look at what was happening in the world at that time.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.422
There was massive shifts in power and things going on in the world.

01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:59.703
That was the American Revolution, the French Revolution, lots of stuff happening.

01:11:00.003 --> 01:11:00.163
But

01:11:01.003 --> 01:11:03.965
we have no idea what's coming because it's Aquarius.

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:08.289
And now we have the technological element of all of this.

01:11:08.329 --> 01:11:12.171
So we could see massive changes and we need to be able to flow.

01:11:12.211 --> 01:11:27.823
We need to be able to evolve and we need to be able to navigate the liminal spaces between the old world and the new world and all this uncertainty and be able to adapt to the changes that are happening because a lot of it is going to be out of our control.

01:11:27.843 --> 01:11:29.444
Did you say luminal spaces?

01:11:30.262 --> 01:11:30.702
Liminal.

01:11:31.323 --> 01:11:32.243
Liminal spaces.

01:11:32.463 --> 01:11:47.131
Yeah, the liminal spaces are like those in-between states where we're in between the old and the new and that's why everybody is so confused and nothing feels real anymore and nobody really knows where we are and so many people don't know how to move forward but we also can't go back.

01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:52.914
There's no more going back to normal or how things were because we're in this transformational process.

01:11:54.289 --> 01:11:56.651
Wow, that was a pretty hardcore statement there.

01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.353
There's no going back to the way they were.

01:11:58.473 --> 01:12:05.900
I was hoping that my son would, I want to put things back to the way they were.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.326
Have you heard of this, is it a Greek story, Ovid?

01:12:12.353 --> 01:12:14.394
Ovid, Ovid, O-V-I-D.

01:12:15.495 --> 01:12:17.516
I think it's a Greek story.

01:12:19.077 --> 01:12:22.019
Some people say COVID is actually Ovid.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.741
O-V-I-D, you should look it up.

01:12:24.821 --> 01:12:27.482
It's also kind of a story about transformation.

01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:32.545
I'm not a very good person about it, but somebody just dropped it in the chat and reminded me of that.

01:12:34.423 --> 01:12:36.004
So I'm an Aquarius.

01:12:36.064 --> 01:12:39.967
Does that mean that the fourth turning is actually a zodiac phenomenon?

01:12:40.127 --> 01:12:41.488
Do you know of the fourth turning also?

01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:42.189
That was another joke.

01:12:42.209 --> 01:12:45.231
I don't know a lot about that, but I'm a terrible, I'm a terrible comedian.

01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:52.676
I do think there's, I think there's something about these larger patterns that happen in society and in our world.

01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:56.719
Well, I, I have to believe that even if those patterns, um,

01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:00.944
they aren't spontaneous, they are definitely used to govern us.

01:13:01.024 --> 01:13:18.961
I mean, there's no question that the, and that's the part that frustrates me most about the discussion of AI and social media is that it discounts the idea that someone like Edward Bernays in 1920 already said that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized opinions and habits of the masses

01:13:19.605 --> 01:13:21.505
is essential to their governance.

01:13:21.566 --> 01:13:22.886
They already knew that.

01:13:23.466 --> 01:13:27.587
And so even when they just had newspapers and leaflets, they already knew that.

01:13:27.707 --> 01:13:39.170
So there's no question that back then, the way they would have done it is put different people in different bars and have them tell elaborate stories to a group of people and then have them all go home and tell their friends the next day.

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:47.432
And so the same thing is being done now, but in a much more militarized and sort of surgical fashion.

01:13:48.893 --> 01:13:54.052
What as a psychologist, if you were to turn this around and you were offered

01:13:55.954 --> 01:14:04.941
$10 billion and you took it, what would you tweak about the current system to make it even more effective at governing us?

01:14:06.362 --> 01:14:06.843
Can you remind me?

01:14:06.863 --> 01:14:07.964
I'm not a psychologist.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:09.245
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:09.425 --> 01:14:10.205
Oh, OK, sorry.

01:14:11.787 --> 01:14:21.174
But then using that hat, and more importantly, I think your experience and as you process the pandemic as I did,

01:14:23.777 --> 01:14:26.059
Can you think of how this could get worse?

01:14:26.999 --> 01:14:29.061
For example, I mean, maybe just this is an easy one.

01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:36.225
If they could have digital currency to help nudge our behavior, is that an obvious thing?

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:40.848
Is there any other kind of malevolence you can imagine or foresee coming?

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:46.569
Yeah, I was going to say like the digital slavery system right now would be a big, huge part of it.

01:14:46.589 --> 01:14:52.931
It seems like that may be the plan that they have, but I don't know that they're going to be successful.

01:14:53.091 --> 01:15:01.934
And if so, it would probably be very short lived because of that absolutely uncontrollable, uncertain aspect of Aquarius that

01:15:02.854 --> 01:15:05.116
they're not really going to be in control.

01:15:05.496 --> 01:15:07.878
You know, like that's that's a delusions of grandeur.

01:15:08.559 --> 01:15:16.025
The less significance we give them, the better, because they're not actually afraid of us saying bad things about them or throwing them in jail and things like that.

01:15:16.085 --> 01:15:18.447
They're most afraid of insignificance.

01:15:19.167 --> 01:15:19.447
Wow.

01:15:19.527 --> 01:15:20.608
I like that a lot.

01:15:21.369 --> 01:15:27.854
Actually, the psychopath anti-communists are they use humor, right?

01:15:27.894 --> 01:15:29.555
You're supposed to make fun of your enemies.

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:35.112
Maybe I'm being silly there when I say that, but I like that a lot.

01:15:35.672 --> 01:15:54.241
And I actually think that there's something to be said for it is in their best interest for us to believe that they can control the weather and cause floods and cause crops to fail and do whatever they do, because then that will make us feel even more helpless, right?

01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:56.962
Maybe there's some truth to that.

01:15:57.442 --> 01:16:00.043
But like you said, though, there's more than that.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:08.907
So like there's also something happening on the planet that has seems to be in some kind of natural cycle that has history and it's happened many times.

01:16:08.947 --> 01:16:13.428
And they would love to make us believe that it's our fault while they want us to.

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:19.731
You know, the other side of that is that it's all them controlling the weather because then they're all powerful.

01:16:20.471 --> 01:16:33.640
Right, and we're just the the peasants that are had fault for everything So I think I think the truth is probably very nuanced and it probably has layers of it But I think the most important thing is that we stop giving them so much power.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:40.985
We give them so much power We take them entirely too seriously, and that's exactly what they want whether for good or bad right whether we're

01:16:41.565 --> 01:16:47.607
idealizing them and they're our heroes and our saviors or whether we're demonizing them and they're like the worst thing.

01:16:47.707 --> 01:16:56.790
Either way we're giving them significance and there's this guy HG Tudor, he's a self-proclaimed narcissistic sociopath and he puts a lot of information out

01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:00.653
about narcissism and psychopathy and what he said, he calls it fuel.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:02.635
We also call it narcissistic supply.

01:17:03.176 --> 01:17:12.745
But he says that the negative source of fuel, like all of your negative emotions is more valuable to the narcissist and the psychopath than your adulation of them.

01:17:14.026 --> 01:17:21.773
So the more negative energy we send to them, the more it feeds them and the more significance it gives them because either way they have control of us.

01:17:22.114 --> 01:17:22.294
Yeah.

01:17:23.427 --> 01:17:33.154
Well, my friend has said many times to me that you can't beat evil by calling it out, because then you speak it into existence more by doing that.

01:17:33.214 --> 01:17:35.716
So I've heard this, I feel it.

01:17:37.057 --> 01:17:38.137
Is there a way forward then?

01:17:38.177 --> 01:17:39.979
Are you running for office in Oklahoma?

01:17:39.999 --> 01:17:41.800
Should I run for office in Pennsylvania?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.502
And then once we all get a seat in Congress, everything will be fine.

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:45.342
How do we get out of this?

01:17:46.343 --> 01:17:48.145
Is it really just small communities?

01:17:48.445 --> 01:17:48.665
No.

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:55.511
Yeah, I think I think it's going to be connecting with small communities, and that may not necessarily be like a physical community that you create.

01:17:55.551 --> 01:17:58.974
It may be like connections with people and network that you create.

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:01.757
I don't see there's any way to fix the system.

01:18:01.797 --> 01:18:04.579
The system is set up to defend the system.

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:06.301
The system will defend the status quo.

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.803
You can move everybody out and move new people in.

01:18:08.843 --> 01:18:11.045
And I think we're going to see the same thing happening.

01:18:11.585 --> 01:18:15.987
And I think the whole idea of voting, like it's this perceived power that we have.

01:18:16.107 --> 01:18:16.668
I don't vote.

01:18:16.808 --> 01:18:20.149
I don't think, and people might be mad at me and I'm not telling anybody what they have to do.

01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:26.552
I'm not saying I'm right and everybody's wrong, but why I don't vote is I think if it really gave us power, they wouldn't let us do it.

01:18:26.912 --> 01:18:29.474
Yeah, but now you can't complain for four years, Meredith.

01:18:29.514 --> 01:18:30.774
You're not allowed to say anything.

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:35.396
I don't think that's going to change anything.

01:18:35.436 --> 01:18:40.238
And I think it's a way of every, you know, every how many years it's like, oh, this is the time where I'm going to make a difference.

01:18:40.278 --> 01:18:42.940
And, oh, this is the time where my candidates going to change things.

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.420
I just don't think it's going to happen.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.401
I think the system is going to perpetuate itself.

01:18:46.441 --> 01:18:48.462
We may see some positive changes.

01:18:48.522 --> 01:19:00.027
I'm not entirely negative about that, but I think the real power is in our choices and coming back to the self and the responsibility of our choices and recognizing that's all we have control over.

01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:05.892
Wow, I'm really happy we had this conversation because I tell you when I first

01:19:06.991 --> 01:19:12.215
When I first saw your face in that video, I was like, what in the, what is going on?

01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:13.275
I don't even know.

01:19:13.395 --> 01:19:18.279
I, I had to reorient, like how many years ago was it?

01:19:18.539 --> 01:19:20.260
What in the world is going on?

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.524
And, and all I know is that I've been, I've been chasing a lot of these ghosts for a long time.

01:19:26.204 --> 01:19:30.947
Um, and trying to call attention to how I think I myself was manipulated.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:36.231
Um, but, uh, it was this really this video that, that.

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:41.731
showed me exactly how long I'd been trapped, how far I've gone.

01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:48.935
And maybe even also how close we are to neutralizing this.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:52.897
I really think that this was kind of a desperate move.

01:19:53.138 --> 01:20:00.082
I think they hoped that I would maybe, I don't know, go nuts or make many, many shows about it.

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:05.065
And again, you know, maybe do a few more hours on Robert or somebody else.

01:20:05.205 --> 01:20:05.645
And I think

01:20:07.538 --> 01:20:15.945
I think if what comes of it is less attention and more focus on the stuff that I think is important.

01:20:17.159 --> 01:20:19.360
I think it'll actually be a net gain.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.341
And certainly it's a net gain because we reconnected.

01:20:22.842 --> 01:20:24.202
I'm really happy that this happened.

01:20:25.643 --> 01:20:29.465
I don't know, I'm feeling like I wanna keep it close to an hour.

01:20:29.545 --> 01:20:30.986
That's why I'm sort of wrapping it up.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.446
I don't wanna take too much of your time.

01:20:33.127 --> 01:20:37.389
But if you could just mention, so I was actually scared.

01:20:37.969 --> 01:20:42.171
I'm gonna switch over to here for a second because it's just funny.

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.693
I don't think, can you see yourself now also Meredith?

01:20:46.773 --> 01:20:46.993
Okay.

01:20:47.474 --> 01:21:04.905
So Meredith said that she was in the Canary book and I freaked out at first in the pre-show thing because this Canary book, yeah, the second one, the first Canary book has a lot of people in it that I have been chasing around and waving at and following.

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:08.527
And so when she said that she was in the Canary book, and did I have the Canary book?

01:21:08.547 --> 01:21:09.768
I was like, Oh, no.

01:21:10.649 --> 01:21:12.130
But no, there's a second Canary book.

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:12.990
So I have to get that.

01:21:14.051 --> 01:21:19.355
And you also are working on your own book, I understand, which is also very exciting.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:25.619
I, I have the feeling at some point in time, people have been telling me I should do that, too.

01:21:25.659 --> 01:21:27.261
Although I don't really know what that means.

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:27.481
But

01:21:27.981 --> 01:21:33.468
How long have you been working and do you have a work flow already?

01:21:33.508 --> 01:21:37.052
Do you get up in the morning and write for an hour irrespective of what comes out?

01:21:37.672 --> 01:21:39.374
Do you have some other strategy?

01:21:39.414 --> 01:21:40.636
How did you get started?

01:21:42.028 --> 01:21:47.331
So I started writing the book right when I was giving those presentations on these topics over the last few years.

01:21:47.411 --> 01:21:49.032
And so it's going to be two parts.

01:21:49.552 --> 01:21:53.854
The first part is the presentation I gave when we talked in 22, I think it was.

01:21:54.355 --> 01:21:56.336
And the second part is what I'm talking about now.

01:21:56.756 --> 01:22:06.241
And that's more about healing the trauma and transforming these wounds into a legacy of light so that we don't pass forward this burden to the new generations.

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.982
Because if we don't heal this trauma,

01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:12.643
This is going to lead to a very dark place for humanity in the future.

01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:21.326
This is a huge responsibility we have that we can transmute those wounds into resilience that we pass forward or we could pass forward the unresolved trauma.

01:22:21.986 --> 01:22:26.367
But so the first part is on the state of captivity, which is basically the Stockholm syndrome.

01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:28.548
And the second part is what we can do about that now.

01:22:29.348 --> 01:22:32.970
And I just got the book contract about a month ago or so.

01:22:33.551 --> 01:22:34.531
It's due in April.

01:22:34.591 --> 01:22:35.972
I'm probably going to finish it early.

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:38.594
I don't work well with like a one-hour thing.

01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:46.018
When I do creative stuff, I have certain days a week that I do sessions, certain days a week that are creative, and I have my whole self-care routine as well.

01:22:46.038 --> 01:22:50.640
But I have to block chunks of time for myself, like several hours of time.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:53.102
Otherwise, I can't get into that creative state.

01:22:53.562 --> 01:23:00.167
if I know I have a call or something else and I have to completely shut off the phone, shut off the email, like it's just, it's full on in that.

01:23:00.307 --> 01:23:07.572
And sometimes I'll go to cigar lounges with my laptop and work there and smoke a cigar and nicotine actually really helps with the focus process.

01:23:07.632 --> 01:23:10.434
And sometimes I'll have interesting conversations with people, but.

01:23:10.974 --> 01:23:12.154
Have you ever tried a pipe?

01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:16.775
Actually, people make the joke, but I think it's real.

01:23:17.896 --> 01:23:23.237
A cigar is like a black and white television and color TV is a pipe.

01:23:23.317 --> 01:23:29.898
So there are some very great tobaccos out there.

01:23:30.218 --> 01:23:32.859
And if you're into that and you're

01:23:33.519 --> 01:23:38.662
Because anybody that's listening to this, you don't inhale a cigar generally, you don't inhale a pipe.

01:23:38.862 --> 01:23:46.928
The nicotine is coming in primarily to the epithelium of your mouth and it's a little less impactual unless you do it wrong.

01:23:47.948 --> 01:23:49.810
But more importantly, I do agree.

01:23:50.570 --> 01:24:02.598
That was one of the main reasons why I was a smoker was because an afternoon coffee and cigarette was, I can still think about it now and my brain's like, that's not that bad of an idea, but I don't do that anymore.

01:24:03.478 --> 01:24:07.702
But yeah, it's an interesting thing and we know those wheels turn well.

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:20.874
I'm excited to hear that because for me, I think it's always inspiring to hear that people got started and are doing it and getting there.

01:24:20.914 --> 01:24:24.457
And now you have the optimism to say you think you'll be done early, which is pretty badass.

01:24:24.497 --> 01:24:25.258
I think that's really cool.

01:24:26.748 --> 01:24:32.720
Is there anything else you'd like to share with my audience or anything else you'd like to mention or something that I missed?

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.043
I mean, we're not in a rush to end.

01:24:37.532 --> 01:24:39.994
Not really, unless y'all want to check out the new Canary book.

01:24:40.014 --> 01:24:42.815
There's some really, I only read about five or six essays so far.

01:24:43.395 --> 01:24:45.356
Catherine Austin Fitz was really interesting.

01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:48.598
She wrote about like the money aspect for the Gina side.

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:54.000
And going back way before 2020, Margaret Anna Alice's was amazing.

01:24:54.321 --> 01:24:55.261
It was on the why.

01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:57.582
And she asked all these questions like, why did this happen?

01:24:57.602 --> 01:24:58.202
Why did that happen?

01:24:58.222 --> 01:24:58.923
Why did that happen?

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:03.167
There are some other really interesting ones in there, too.

01:25:03.367 --> 01:25:04.708
I really recommend checking that out.

01:25:04.748 --> 01:25:05.288
It just came out.

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:09.032
I think it's a number one new release in a couple different categories right now.

01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:10.714
How many thought leaders are in that one?

01:25:10.734 --> 01:25:11.774
This one had 34.

01:25:12.235 --> 01:25:12.675
This one has 37.

01:25:13.656 --> 01:25:13.957
Okay.

01:25:14.017 --> 01:25:14.677
It's a big book.

01:25:15.078 --> 01:25:15.338
Wow.

01:25:16.239 --> 01:25:16.659
Right on.

01:25:16.699 --> 01:25:20.623
This one has some real winners in it, so I'm looking forward to that one.

01:25:22.064 --> 01:25:23.585
Maybe I'll get in the third edition.

01:25:23.605 --> 01:25:24.066
You never know.

01:25:25.612 --> 01:25:31.105
Thank you very much, Meredith, for joining me and taking the time to not talk about Robert Malone.

01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.912
Thanks for inviting me, JJ.

01:25:33.932 --> 01:25:34.794
You're very welcome.

01:25:35.195 --> 01:25:35.576
See you soon.

01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:39.913
Okay, I'm gonna click end there.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:40.853
Adios.

01:25:42.034 --> 01:25:45.577
I'm not really sure what to say other than we're making progress.

01:25:45.637 --> 01:25:47.058
We're making a lot of progress.

01:25:48.299 --> 01:25:52.282
I am very excited about the progress, sorry, progress that we're making.

01:25:53.603 --> 01:25:55.424
And I am very excited about tomorrow.

01:25:55.464 --> 01:25:57.486
I'm presenting at the Red Pill at three o'clock.

01:25:58.606 --> 01:26:01.509
And I will stream it here live as well.

01:26:01.529 --> 01:26:05.171
They wanted me to stream it on Twitter, but I'm not a member of Twitter, so I can't do that.

01:26:05.191 --> 01:26:05.952
That was really weird.

01:26:06.796 --> 01:26:07.957
Um, so I'll stream it live here.

01:26:07.977 --> 01:26:09.599
It'll also be live with the red pill.

01:26:10.019 --> 01:26:13.802
Um, don't tell anybody, but I don't really know what I'm going to present tomorrow yet.

01:26:13.822 --> 01:26:16.365
I'm supposed to present about all the reasons why we get sick.

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:20.628
Um, and, uh, so I, I got to put together a slideshow.

01:26:20.969 --> 01:26:32.599
Um, and so I'm not going to the basketball court today because of putting that slideshow together, but I made the first raw recordings of, um, uh,

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.221
The first raw recordings of JC on the hardwood.

01:26:38.181 --> 01:26:41.002
And I think it turned out a lot better than I thought it did.

01:26:41.082 --> 01:26:43.843
I need to mix down the sound and do the cutting.

01:26:44.803 --> 01:26:47.764
But I think I'll have something on the internet probably tomorrow.

01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:52.726
I don't know how that's going to happen with Red Pill, but it's probably going to happen because once I start editing a video, I can't really go to bed.

01:26:53.246 --> 01:26:56.027
Which is one of the reasons why I stopped editing videos a long time ago.

01:26:57.187 --> 01:27:01.670
I really like doing it but perfect gets in the way of good but we'll see.

01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:13.616
I'm really excited about starting a new YouTube channel where we're going to discuss a lot of this biology but in the context of the basketball court and so maybe it will be less intimidating and it will be less

01:27:15.477 --> 01:27:18.520
It will be less, I don't know, it'll be less something.

01:27:18.641 --> 01:27:23.886
Maybe it'll be easier for some people to grasp, some people to accept, some people to think about.

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:25.187
I don't really know.

01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:33.676
I might do a recap of this in the sense of add a little bit of work with the calendar and that kind of thing to put this

01:27:34.336 --> 01:27:43.202
really into context that he used clips of Kevin McCarren and used a real shout out to the anonymous mice.

01:27:43.262 --> 01:27:50.607
This was a gigantic admission by team Robert Malone that they have been coordinating their actions on social media for quite some time.

01:27:50.627 --> 01:27:58.533
And that a lot of them have focused a lot of time on me, which is really very fun because it really actually means that Papa's not crazy.

01:27:59.553 --> 01:28:00.754
Hold on one second.

01:28:00.794 --> 01:28:06.038
I'm just gonna make a phone call here and see if I can give a quick shout out upstairs.

01:28:09.421 --> 01:28:10.582
Hold on one second, please.

01:28:24.614 --> 01:28:29.528
So, um, it's going to take a second and then I'll, uh, I'll let it go.

01:28:30.612 --> 01:28:32.256
Make this disappear.

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:40.591
Thank you very much again everybody for having the patience that it requires sometimes to follow me and to support me.

01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:59.840
This week I was asked to do some consulting work and so I put in a few hours this week that will probably help my family financially quite a bit in the next month or two and get us over the line on that thing.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.741
Thank you very much.

01:29:01.827 --> 01:29:07.493
And we have a new little demon in our household.

01:29:07.774 --> 01:29:13.520
This is Micah.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:20.347
So we have a red dog named Ruby, and now we have a white dog named Micah.

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:22.630
And Micah is,

01:29:25.217 --> 01:29:26.598
About 10 weeks old now.

01:29:26.698 --> 01:29:29.219
Micah is almost potty trained already.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:30.279
He goes over to the door.

01:29:30.319 --> 01:29:31.479
You got to make sure you open it.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.560
Otherwise, it doesn't go.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.180
Nay, nay, nay.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:35.901
Don't get down yet.

01:29:36.761 --> 01:29:37.821
But he's very cute.

01:29:38.381 --> 01:29:39.362
He's a very good boy.

01:29:39.602 --> 01:29:43.023
And Ruby and him, when they play, it is absolutely magical.

01:29:44.383 --> 01:29:50.205
We almost lost Ruby this year, so we thought that it was appropriate that she have a chance to teach somebody.

01:29:51.226 --> 01:29:55.887
So Mike is a little guy, but when he gets big, he's going to be Big Mike.

01:29:56.408 --> 01:30:00.609
And when I figured out that we were going to have a dog named Big Mike, I got very, very excited.

01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:02.390
So this is little Mike now.

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:05.672
But he'll be Big Mike in a couple years.

01:30:05.732 --> 01:30:08.033
So anyway, happy for Ruby, happy for us.

01:30:08.794 --> 01:30:10.055
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:30:10.095 --> 01:30:13.297

The boys and the girls, the kids really love that dog boy.

01:30:51.757 --> 01:30:52.537
It's pretty cool.

01:30:53.678 --> 01:30:54.638

01:30:56.979 --> 01:30:59.280
