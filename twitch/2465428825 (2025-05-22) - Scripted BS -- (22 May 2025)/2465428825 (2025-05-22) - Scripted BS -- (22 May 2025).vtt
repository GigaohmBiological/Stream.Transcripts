WEBVTT

00:21.858 --> 00:25.081
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:27.002 --> 00:27.743
Stop lying!

00:36.528 --> 00:49.450
Science Magazine, John Cohen, covered the bird flu vaccines, and there were some other articles about this new push for mRNA vaccines for bird flu.

00:50.131 --> 01:01.053
And the statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology, and I just gagged at that.

01:04.537 --> 01:15.465
So, so we've already got, you know, modern and traditional, do you believe, you know, cause I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

01:17.447 --> 01:17.527
Uh,

01:19.241 --> 01:35.797
I think that, so for instance, Science Magazine, John Cohen, covered the bird flu vaccines and there was some other articles about this new push for mRNA vaccines for bird flu.

01:38.061 --> 01:46.284
um, the statement was made that, uh, these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology.

01:46.304 --> 01:47.485
And I just gagged at that.

01:50.926 --> 01:53.628
So, so we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

01:53.888 --> 02:01.851
Do you believe, you know, cause I mean, do you still, do you believe that some vaccines are good?

02:03.872 --> 02:03.932
Uh,

02:05.640 --> 02:22.342
I think that, so for instance, Science Magazine, John Cohen, covered the bird flu vaccines and there was some other articles about this new push for mRNA vaccines for bird flu.

02:25.134 --> 02:32.837
the statement was made that these current round of vaccines were using traditional mRNA technology.

02:32.857 --> 02:34.038
And I just gagged at that.

02:37.599 --> 02:40.180
So we've already got, you know, modern and traditional.

02:40.440 --> 02:48.403
Do you believe, you know, because I mean, do you still do you believe that some vaccines are good?

02:52.125 --> 02:52.205
OK.

02:53.775 --> 02:56.958
Generally speaking, are you a pro-vaccine person?

02:58.059 --> 02:58.339
Yes.

02:58.439 --> 03:16.635
I think as a hematologist oncologist who took care of immunocompromised patients as an attending for a decade, including many people post-autologous stem cell transplant, I am a extreme pro-vaccine person because these patients who are immunocompromised are extremely vulnerable and they benefit from vaccination in myriad ways.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.457
And we pursue vaccination in people post-transplant

03:20.057 --> 03:23.479
with the same vigor and commitment that pediatricians pursue vaccination.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.180
It's an important thing.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.162
But again, vaccines are like drugs.

03:27.202 --> 03:40.450
I think it's important for the American people to understand that the right drug to the right person at the right time is life-saving, but that doesn't mean that every single thing is perfect as is, that we can't improve, that there aren't safety concerns we take very seriously.

03:40.710 --> 03:41.691
And at FDA, we do that.

03:42.091 --> 03:53.748
Even in the short time I've been here, a number of things have been brought to my attention where we need to take action and strike the balance between preserving the benefits of these products, but being careful and cognizant of the safety concerns.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.672
Yeah, I remember learning about

03:58.362 --> 04:03.706
Dr. Jenner's development of the cowpox vaccine for smallpox, really an amazing story.

04:03.727 --> 04:08.130
I've had the privilege of doing a deep dive and researching it and writing about it.

04:08.671 --> 04:16.497
And in the 1700s, really, his idea was rejected because of a dogma that there's no way this could be actually happening.

04:16.517 --> 04:19.380
And they were ignoring clinical observations of

04:20.260 --> 04:30.146
nurse maids that had exposure to the cowpox, basically the virus itself, and they were noted to not be getting smallpox.

04:30.226 --> 04:35.189
And for a long time, Dr. Jenner had really encouraged vaccination.

04:35.229 --> 04:46.076
And there was the earliest group of anti-vaxxers, probably in the history of the world, right around that time, including some in the United States when the vaccine was brought to the United States around 1799, around 1800.

04:48.457 --> 04:52.342
Harvard professor tried to champion this it was positioned as a

04:53.559 --> 04:56.100
opportunity to have a national vaccine program.

04:56.560 --> 05:05.122
I think to President Adams, for whatever reason, I don't know, couldn't find the details, President Adams did not act on that recommendation.

05:05.502 --> 05:07.483
President Jefferson later did.

05:07.983 --> 05:11.004
And really, that was the birth of vaccinations in the United States.

05:11.064 --> 05:12.764
It's really an amazing concept.

05:13.364 --> 05:15.305
And I love the idea of vaccinations.

05:15.905 --> 05:22.747
And I've seen vaccines save lives and do incredible things, as we've seen in an immunocompromised population.

05:23.467 --> 05:24.688
in my own clinical practice.

05:25.308 --> 05:29.411
And really that was the birth of vaccinations in the United States.

05:29.491 --> 05:31.172
It's really an amazing concept.

05:31.773 --> 05:33.734
And I love the idea of vaccinations.

05:34.335 --> 05:38.758
And I've seen vaccines save lives and do incredible things as we've seen.

05:38.778 --> 05:40.559
He's seen it with his own eyes.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.121
in my own clinical practice.

05:43.722 --> 05:47.165
And there's another lesson there, which is that change in medicine isn't always easy.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.248
There are lots of advances in medicine that aren't always easy.

05:50.588 --> 05:54.692
And I think there's going to be some people out there who are concerned about various aspects of our framework.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.595
But ultimately, I do think this is a step forward.

05:57.755 --> 06:04.942
And a lot of these questions will be answered by next calendar year when we start to get the interim results of some of these studies back.

06:05.322 --> 06:07.463
And we will have more information to tell the American people.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.886
And, you know, the results of these studies could surprise everybody.

06:10.966 --> 06:13.067
We don't know what that, you know, that's the whole point of running a study.

06:13.087 --> 06:14.188
You don't know what you're going to get.

06:14.648 --> 06:16.449
You never know what you're going to get right.

06:16.549 --> 06:21.032
This is the end of that little town hall that they did yesterday.

06:21.132 --> 06:26.736
I didn't play this yesterday because I can only take so much of this stuff in a given 24 hour period.

06:28.817 --> 06:33.300
before I really need eight hours of sleep to recharge from this.

06:33.820 --> 06:54.353
It is remarkable that it seems as though, and this is the trick, I find myself falling into the same trap that Arthur Vandelay in the chat, I believe we're all in this trap where because we are so subconsciously using social media to try and get a gauge

06:55.783 --> 07:08.108
on what people around us are thinking, and because social media is a gigantic, militarized, computerized, pre-programmed lie, there's no way to do that.

07:08.488 --> 07:13.851
And so we're left with this impression that we're one of the only people on earth who sees this charade.

07:14.827 --> 07:17.448
But in reality, I think a lot of people see it.

07:17.548 --> 07:22.368
They just don't understand it as perhaps as well as we might.

07:22.969 --> 07:34.991
I don't want to say with 100% confidence that we're dead on balls accurate on every sort of estimation on where we stand.

07:35.131 --> 07:40.272
But I think we are in a position to claim that our

07:41.340 --> 07:53.605
understanding of the biosecurity state and what they are capable of has grown in a pretty linear fashion for the last five years.

07:53.665 --> 08:08.010
And as we've learned, we've progressed, checked ourselves again and again, and we are at a stage now where we understand that weaponized piles of money are attempting to govern us on a supernational level

08:09.614 --> 08:20.239
And one of the ways that they are attempting to do it is by putting actors in place on social media to convince us of consensuses around us, if I can say that.

08:20.299 --> 08:24.321
Every time you look on social media, it seems like everybody's busy with something.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.843
And so that, because of our biology,

08:30.094 --> 08:39.299
sends a root signal to our brain that, wow, the rest of the people around me are concerned about something.

08:39.359 --> 08:41.620
Therefore, I should be concerned about it.

08:42.541 --> 08:49.544
And that would be a pretty good baseline level of social interaction in a social animal.

08:50.785 --> 08:54.027
But social media is not social interaction.

08:54.924 --> 09:00.567
Social media is a militarized, computerized, pre-programmed, false reality.

09:01.648 --> 09:22.340
And these guys are in front of us because they used that social media, pre-programmed, militarized version of reality to convince us that these guys might be in line for such a job, that it kind of makes sense, given their track record, when in reality, that track record only exists because of social media.

09:25.211 --> 09:41.179
And once you strip that from their existence and you leave it to really the ideas and the progression of their understanding of what the biosecurity state is capable of, you realize that these people are a part of the biosecurity state.

09:41.299 --> 09:44.621
It's impossible for it to be any other way.

09:45.181 --> 09:47.402
And you realize that the biosecurity state

09:49.068 --> 10:00.711
is present throughout social media is scripting many podcasts or scripting the people on podcasts so that this narrative can be flawlessly maintained.

10:03.032 --> 10:06.833
So my observation is there have been some

10:09.132 --> 10:11.773
great milestones from vaccines.

10:12.733 --> 10:18.254
At the same time, the anthrax vaccine was a total disaster.

10:19.254 --> 10:21.875
How'd you like that, Mark?

10:22.355 --> 10:26.616
Just in time in the chat and I timed it almost like I knew you were coming.

10:26.636 --> 10:27.456
That's pretty funny.

10:27.476 --> 10:28.856
Here we go.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.397
Let's see if I can play that again.

10:30.477 --> 10:31.097
Sorry about that.

10:31.137 --> 10:31.937
Oh, I got to start it.

10:32.717 --> 10:57.237
the anthrax vaccine was a disaster was a total disaster um the road vaccines at the same time um the anthrax vaccine was a total disaster the swine flu vaccine was a total disaster um the rotavirus vaccine was i have no response the original malfunctioning thing the market

10:57.977 --> 11:00.740
There have been HIV vaccines that increase the acquisition of the virus.

11:02.141 --> 11:05.764
HIV vaccines increase the acquisition of the virus.

11:05.845 --> 11:07.206
Wow, this is remarkable.

11:07.286 --> 11:08.507
I mean, that's great.

11:08.527 --> 11:09.868
I got to play that whole thing again.

11:09.888 --> 11:15.153
I mean, your point's well taken, that not every single thing that's labeled... At the same time,

11:18.696 --> 11:21.599
The anthrax vaccine was a total disaster.

11:22.039 --> 11:25.362
The swine flu vaccine was a total disaster.

11:26.403 --> 11:27.704
The road.

11:27.844 --> 11:45.939
And so you know that I'm I'm friends with a guy by the name of Mark Kulak, who runs a a kind of similar operation, albeit much more professional than mine and for longer and with a website full of of, you know, well archived and well organized

11:48.851 --> 11:52.196
let's say, information he often refers to.

11:52.536 --> 12:01.108
And in this case, I have to give a big shout out to Mark for helping me to see the

12:02.438 --> 12:21.079
the sort of central role that the anthrax vaccine in the military, the, you know, and that's all behind the scenes, it's in the bureaucracy, it's in the meetings, it's in the meetings where you need lanyards or special clearance, where they're talking about the priorities for the military, military readiness, and

12:21.739 --> 12:40.665
and and super soldiers and and bioterrorism and what that means and telling people in the bureaucracy that if we're going to be ready for this then there are some things we might need to vaccinate our troops to and one of them was anthrax another one was curiously enough botulinum toxin

12:42.079 --> 12:52.590
And so there is also a history that I didn't know about until Mark's work of a military prerogative to develop a botulinum toxin vaccine.

12:53.666 --> 13:00.948
And so if they had candidates for that, it is very possible that soldiers were tested with those vaccines.

13:01.008 --> 13:12.072
It's very likely that Gulf War syndrome is a result of vaccine testing on those troops, not because they stored the Diet Coke in the sun for too long.

13:13.733 --> 13:17.874
And so there is a long history of this

13:20.051 --> 13:25.813
Again, I'll use the word prerogative in the biosecurity state of America and perhaps NATO.

13:26.594 --> 13:44.701
Maybe it would be more useful to think of it as a NATO military security priority, national security priority, supranational security priority, to be aware of bioweapons, to search for and surveil potential bioweapons programs, and also to think about it as

13:45.641 --> 13:51.665
a thing that the military and maybe even the civilian population would potentially need to be ready for.

13:52.426 --> 13:58.070
Maybe the civilian population could potentially provide data that would allow our military to be more ready.

13:58.690 --> 14:09.458
And any of these permutations of this logic in the right back room would allow the prioritization of a national narrative

14:11.297 --> 14:18.119
a simplified version of a biological narrative, which would get the population to maximally comply.

14:19.119 --> 14:29.502
And then behind the scenes, everybody would know what maximum compliance got them, which would be experimental data, data that would allow them to ultimately make the military more ready.

14:31.815 --> 14:41.629
So it's a very, you know, we're not going to figure this out because suddenly we'll say the right combination of words and everybody in the world is going to agree with us.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.011
This is a crime scene.

14:46.744 --> 15:13.759
The criminal enterprise here is composed of probably, you know, arguing and warring factions or at least factions which are vying for a bigger piece of whatever pie we're talking about in terms of control and capital and real estate and intellectual property and potentially access to whatever data sets are being produced and the results of that analysis.

15:15.649 --> 15:21.144
And so here we have this, you know, what can only be described as a clown show.

15:21.204 --> 15:24.552
These two guys are so out of their depth.

15:26.243 --> 15:27.664
And you can see it.

15:28.385 --> 15:37.032
Their whole shtick, their whole thing that they're doing is obviously they're just acting, placeholding.

15:37.693 --> 15:47.061
They're not doing anything with their... We watched the podcast the other day where they were gonna have a farmer's market and they were bragging about organizing a farmer's market.

15:47.081 --> 15:47.301
I mean...

15:49.980 --> 15:53.162
This, and they did a whole, oh shit, it's still doing it.

15:53.442 --> 15:57.405
Wow, I don't know why it's not giving me a control like that.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.827
They're still doing it, you know?

16:01.527 --> 16:06.050
It's still just a mockery of what the FDA should be, and we'll talk about that more.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.312
I'm gonna let this play a little longer, see how long they go.

16:08.832 --> 16:11.273
A virus vaccine was removed from the market.

16:11.653 --> 16:13.954
The original one was removed from the market.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.436
There have been HIV vaccines that increased the acquisition of the virus.

16:18.636 --> 16:22.277
I mean, your point's well taken that not every single... Hey, thanks for listening.

16:23.758 --> 16:26.699
Six Girl is often in the chat.

16:26.759 --> 16:27.520
It's good to see you.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.140
She is right.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.121
It would have to be a

16:31.241 --> 16:33.082
a vaccine against a toxoid.

16:33.122 --> 16:45.990
So botulinum is a bacteria as I understand it, but some of the proteins are a protein or a complement of proteins that are made by the botulinum bacteria are among the most

16:48.320 --> 16:53.782
let's say low dose, high nasty compounds known to man.

16:54.062 --> 17:10.850
And so I was told by my history teacher in high school, actually, which is really weird, that if you had a, if you could purify that botulinum protein that's toxic and, and have like a mayonnaise jar full of it and distribute it well, you could essentially wipe out most of the planet.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.430
And it would kill a lot of animals too.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.871
Like it's a real nasty thing.

17:15.372 --> 17:20.715
And so you're right, what they're talking about is making a vaccine to the weaponized version.

17:20.755 --> 17:29.861
And that's incidentally, as I've learned from the work of Mark Kulak, that's what any potential anthrax vaccine would also be made against.

17:29.901 --> 17:33.384
It would be made against a hypothetically weaponized

17:34.324 --> 17:35.365
anthrax weapon.

17:35.405 --> 17:42.549
So they're not thinking about anthrax in the dirt and trying to, you know, immunize you against the naturally occurring anthrax.

17:42.569 --> 17:44.650
They're thinking about it from at least

17:46.784 --> 17:50.566
As far as I can conceive, they are thinking of it that way.

17:50.646 --> 18:01.932
They could be thinking of it only that way for the simple fact that they know that they want to weaponize anthrax and have an antidote on board, and so they know that that's the only model to use.

18:02.353 --> 18:04.614
They're not trying to save you from the natural version.

18:05.683 --> 18:12.666
And so I suspect that would be obviously, as she said, and it pointed out rightly, that that would be the same with botulinum toxin.

18:13.126 --> 18:19.368
The thing that's labeled a vaccine has been in advance, but thankfully at the FDA, we've tried to shield the American people from a lot of such things.

18:19.408 --> 18:20.329
Yeah, good point.

18:21.429 --> 18:31.276
Shifting, you talked about endpoints with vaccine trials, how you'd like to see some clinical benefit as the endpoint, not just an antibody increase.

18:31.296 --> 18:32.557
Can you talk about that?

18:32.617 --> 18:35.580
And so again, trying to be the right kind of coach here.

18:36.881 --> 19:00.139
The reason why red flags should be going off, the reason why you should hear the grinding of brake pads that are almost gone, is because they are not moving from the idea that vaccines are a great idea, wonderful methodology, one of the best inventions in modern medicine.

19:01.403 --> 19:05.807
One of the biggest advances, you know, next to washing our hands or something like that.

19:05.907 --> 19:08.689
And it's really, it's really not good.

19:09.990 --> 19:13.513
Because this should be a huge red flag, right?

19:13.613 --> 19:16.976
It should be a giant red flag for one reason and one reason only.

19:18.977 --> 19:20.499
No, many, many, many reasons.

19:21.345 --> 19:27.690
But for me, it's a red flag because in 2021, I was already warning that this is where they were going.

19:27.850 --> 19:47.126
That the only way to explain this sort of lack of movement from spike protein, the spike protein, the spike protein, was that they were eventually going to tell us a story about the spike protein instead of blaming the methodology, intramuscular injection and transfection in particular.

19:48.513 --> 19:55.238
That's why all those people were in place for the spike protein and amyloidosis and now why we're still there right now.

19:56.079 --> 20:05.667
Yesterday, somebody spoke in front of our Congress and said the spike protein S1 subunit causes amyloidosis.

20:07.887 --> 20:15.090
And this is a confounding narrative, that if it's built in there, it can only be built in there.

20:15.150 --> 20:15.570
Why?

20:15.990 --> 20:24.453
Because of what I said yesterday, that you have been made to accept the original sequence, because the original sequence is an exact one.

20:25.566 --> 20:41.304
And the only way that the S1 subunit can be significant causing amyloidosis is because it's an exact sequence with exact properties that presumably would go away if one of those exact amino acids were to change.

20:42.270 --> 20:59.345
and therefore the tertiary structure of that exact sequence and its protein would change and therefore lose the exact function of amyloid generating capabilities because that is based on structure and function, right?

21:00.186 --> 21:05.391
You don't just, it's not every protein that causes it, otherwise we'd be dead a long time ago, right?

21:05.411 --> 21:06.492
Just one particle.

21:07.754 --> 21:08.635
is for prions.

21:09.035 --> 21:13.579
And so this, all this, this mythology is tied in together.

21:14.279 --> 21:18.963
It's tied in together because nobody understands molecular biology correctly.

21:20.044 --> 21:36.117
Nobody in these circles, nobody at the gas station, nobody at the water cooler understands molecular biology sufficiently enough to know that they've just omitted a whole layer of what

21:37.082 --> 21:39.644
you should think of as nature on a baseline.

21:39.684 --> 21:44.026
They've just removed that whole layer and replaced it with this mythology of viruses.

21:44.746 --> 21:53.552
Viruses that infect, viruses that are trying to kill us, viruses that constantly mutate, viruses that go endemic.

21:53.812 --> 22:02.837
And these guys, unfortunately, are so much more interested in progressing in the hierarchy

22:04.386 --> 22:06.027
especially Vinay.

22:06.087 --> 22:12.810
Vinay sees himself, I imagine, as some kind of very precocious, you know, super achiever.

22:14.431 --> 22:23.575
And he's still going in that general progression ever since he was vetted at the National Cancer Institutes in his training.

22:24.841 --> 22:39.464
Talk a little bit about the different types of endpoints in vaccine trials for the COVID boosters and what you'd like to see and what you'd like to see as a sort of condition of approval versus you'd like to see in some post-marketing.

22:39.724 --> 22:47.726
Sorry, so to get back to what I was saying, in order to be the coach that I want to be, I want to remind you of how to look at this, what questions you should be paid.

22:48.946 --> 22:50.546
what you should be paying attention to.

22:50.586 --> 22:54.667
And what you should be paying attention to is what questions do they say are important.

22:55.487 --> 23:03.709
And right now, they are saying what's important is what are the endpoints for vaccine trials and should we choose different endpoints?

23:05.549 --> 23:13.750
And the problem with those questions is that they presume that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is a valid form of medicine for healthy people.

23:14.570 --> 23:17.791
And that is absolutely biological nonsense.

23:18.766 --> 23:23.748
But they work under that assumption and they ask questions that presume that.

23:24.508 --> 23:26.568
And that's the illusion, that's the enchantment.

23:26.608 --> 23:29.149
That's why everybody that listens to this is trapped.

23:30.310 --> 23:40.993
Because the language that they choose, the questions that they choose are all, wittingly or unwittingly, they end up being chosen very well.

23:41.829 --> 23:45.035
in order to reinforce their own presuppositions.

23:45.095 --> 23:51.167
You don't ask questions that bring in doubts about what you believe are right.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.139
It's hard to tell with these people whether they know what they're doing.

23:58.179 --> 24:06.445
My guess is, is that they know that they've been recruited to do what they're told, and they're doing what they're told, and they're given assignments.

24:06.545 --> 24:11.289
And he's been doing assignments like this for many, many years in academia.

24:11.309 --> 24:12.970
And so this is just another assignment.

24:12.990 --> 24:15.232
It's another abstract to write.

24:15.292 --> 24:16.793
It's another grant application.

24:16.813 --> 24:17.953
That's all he's doing here.

24:18.654 --> 24:21.936
And of course, he's also been performing on YouTube for years.

24:22.016 --> 24:23.157
And so this is no different.

24:24.636 --> 24:25.356
Yeah, that's a good point.

24:25.416 --> 24:28.558
So, I mean, I think when we call it symptomatic SARS-CoV-2.

24:28.918 --> 24:35.721
Think about how that made him so much more comfortable on camera than he would otherwise would be when he's lying.

24:37.001 --> 24:51.288
If they just chose a professional who was a professional and wasn't so used to being on camera with ZDogg and this guy, then transitioning to an FDA that does a podcast every few days would be rather difficult.

24:53.068 --> 24:54.189
Maybe even awkward.

24:55.506 --> 25:01.649
People used to tell me in 2020 that I needed media training, and they were going to pay for the media training.

25:02.469 --> 25:05.271
Piper Stover said she was going to pay for the media training.

25:05.431 --> 25:08.012
Brent Weinstein said maybe I should get media training.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.244
But what it usually means, that's the primary endpoint of the original vaccine studies.

25:16.524 --> 25:26.375
And what that means is that if someone's out there and they're in the vaccine study and they start to feel sore throat, runny nose, they start to have symptoms of COVID, they're asked to swab themselves and submit the swab in.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.478
And so the primary point is not, did you feel sick?

25:29.819 --> 25:33.603
But if you felt sick, did the swab test positive for the virus?

25:33.723 --> 25:34.223
There you go.

25:35.413 --> 25:49.390
And so here we have two FDA officials sitting around agreeing that swabbing, PCR-ing, is a perfectly legit way for a high-fidelity measurement, not only of the virus's presence, but probably also relative quantities.

25:51.317 --> 25:55.099
This is at the heart of this operation, ladies and gentlemen.

25:55.139 --> 26:09.646
I don't know how else to explain it, but this, there can be no other explanation for why all the people that I've tried to get in touch with, work with, you know, teach a little bit of this stuff and get them to say it on their big platforms.

26:10.526 --> 26:13.568
This is the one thing that none of them will talk about.

26:13.668 --> 26:19.551
And the one thing that all of them were out in front on is that the PCR needs to be done different.

26:20.626 --> 26:21.686
Not, not done.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.347
Not done at all.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.948
They said it has to be done different.

26:29.008 --> 26:31.109
Most of them said that it's overcycling.

26:31.169 --> 26:33.450
Most of them said that it was maybe the primers.

26:33.530 --> 26:37.431
Most of them said that the Jorston report got no peer review.

26:37.491 --> 26:38.471
It's impossible.

26:40.612 --> 26:42.352
The FDA won't approve tests.

26:42.912 --> 26:45.593
The FDA has held us back on tests.

26:47.441 --> 26:51.985
By the end of 2020, we were all pissed and begging for more tests.

26:53.526 --> 26:56.269
The government was distributing free tests.

26:59.872 --> 27:15.005
And at the head of that operation was the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project, Kevin McKernan, going on podcast after podcast after podcast and following him, who would always be somebody like James Lyons-Weiler or Merrill Nass a couple weeks later.

27:18.243 --> 27:20.605
This is all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

27:20.646 --> 27:29.535
It is scripted bullshit, part of a national security operation, not that dissimilar from what was the brochure version in the SPARS pandemic document.

27:29.855 --> 27:31.717
If you've never seen it, look it up and read it.

27:33.078 --> 27:35.401
We are in the midst of an operation like this.

27:35.881 --> 27:39.925
It is very possible that the FDA is already effectively a non-issue.

27:40.649 --> 27:43.233
for their operation, and I'll explain that in a minute.

27:43.714 --> 27:53.850
Because once they have these people, and they have them chasing shiny objects and getting gold stars on their presentation, then the FDA is toothless.

27:54.642 --> 27:55.902
that we care about, COVID-19.

27:56.202 --> 27:58.823
And that end point is roughly called symptomatic SARS-CoV-2.

27:59.203 --> 28:05.924
And that's what we're asking manufacturers to power their study to have a lower bound that excludes a 30% or more reduction.

28:05.944 --> 28:16.747
Can you believe that he is explaining how companies should formulate their results of their COVID-19 vaccine control trials?

28:18.707 --> 28:21.688
That's what the fake health freedom movement got you.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.983
That's what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:25.103 --> 28:28.526
at the head of the HHS got us.

28:30.047 --> 28:42.759
That's what Jay Bhattacharya at NIH has gotten us, and that's what having an Egyptian and an Indian or whatever these guys are, because they're not Americans.

28:43.299 --> 28:46.102
This guy will regularly say it, watch him.

28:48.103 --> 28:52.047
He will regularly say the American people, the American people.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.588
It's good for the American people.

28:53.668 --> 28:55.030
It's good for the American people.

28:55.070 --> 28:56.411
Do you know why he talks like that?

28:56.451 --> 28:58.253
Because he's not an American person.

28:59.233 --> 29:02.056
And he doesn't think of us as America.

29:05.399 --> 29:06.981
And because he's on a bullshit script.

29:09.016 --> 29:11.458
in that endpoint, which I think is quite reasonable and fair.

29:11.918 --> 29:19.743
And one of the initial concerns of the vaccine is that a vaccine where it's barely better than placebo might do more harm than good by creating a false reassurance.

29:19.763 --> 29:22.905
And I think that's a quote from Phil Krause, who used to work here.

29:23.646 --> 29:26.528
So we're asking them to improve symptomatic SARS-CoV-2.

29:26.808 --> 29:30.610
But of course, we're also looking at severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

29:31.070 --> 29:35.053
We're not asking them to power the study for those endpoints, because that will make the study very, very large.

29:35.513 --> 29:36.954
But we are looking at those endpoints.

29:38.157 --> 29:43.760
When we get the results of this study, doctors could look at it and interpret it as they see fit.

29:43.780 --> 29:49.544
They can counsel the patient, well, this is what you get, this is how long it lasts for, here's what we don't know, and here's what we do know.

29:50.364 --> 29:54.707
And I don't know, I'm not a fortune teller, and that's why we run trials.

29:54.807 --> 30:02.872
And so we'll see what we get, and then it'll allow the American people and their physicians to make- Honestly, I don't think anybody who at this stage argues

30:03.894 --> 30:17.002
without using better language than that, that this guy's using, can be nothing more than a, it's like an eighth grade overachiever.

30:17.983 --> 30:21.025
And the intellect of an eighth grade overachiever.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.186
Here's the book, learn it.

30:24.607 --> 30:26.108
Here's the script, memorize it.

30:29.597 --> 30:35.623
And because he knows the words and he's familiar with it and he heard other people saying it and everybody around him tells him it's good.

30:36.484 --> 30:36.945
That's it.

30:37.025 --> 30:42.731
That's all that's required because there's no actual sausage being made between his ears.

30:43.592 --> 30:48.677
He doesn't spend his day, you know, that's not how it works.

30:48.717 --> 30:50.519
He's looking for his next gold star.

30:51.869 --> 31:00.495
He's looking for his next pat on his back or his little, you know, ribbon on his lapel or, you know, that's all he's thinking about.

31:01.516 --> 31:03.137
And a lot of people think like that.

31:04.358 --> 31:13.185
A lot of people just want to be a successful broadcaster or, you know, I just want to be a journalist or I don't know, whatever.

31:14.226 --> 31:15.287
That's not who I am.

31:16.728 --> 31:19.350
I'm a biologist and I'm an American.

31:20.270 --> 31:39.655
and my kids are American, my wife is Dutch, I see the EU being destroyed, I see America being destroyed, but I also see them taking advantage of an anticipated change in the dynamics of our population, the demographics of our population, as predicted by the population pyramids of the West.

31:41.375 --> 31:49.437
And so I don't know exactly how they're dismantling the American democracy as they take advantage of this phenomenon,

31:50.475 --> 31:55.017
But I think if you're honest as an American, you can look around and see it all around you.

31:55.037 --> 32:03.041
You can see it in the changing demographics or even need for elementary schools.

32:04.181 --> 32:10.704
You will see it very soon in the attendance of and the way that colleges market their wares.

32:13.137 --> 32:20.904
because the competition for students is going to increase extremely fast in America and indeed around the world.

32:20.944 --> 32:28.150
Maybe in America, we won't feel it so much because we still get a good influx of foreigners, but they might have to recruit harder.

32:30.392 --> 32:38.459
The more useless our universities are, then potentially the less likely it is that they're going to come over here.

32:39.321 --> 32:45.445
And so this could very well be the scripted controlled demolition of the American culture.

32:45.485 --> 32:46.846
And it wouldn't surprise me at all.

32:47.386 --> 33:03.356
But what could happen here in an optimistic sense is that Americans could realize that we are being given these cards and it's up to us to play them.

33:04.476 --> 33:08.419
And the cards are that for whatever reason, a lot of us are,

33:09.668 --> 33:10.529
multi-racial.

33:11.889 --> 33:16.372
And so the identity that we have really is America.

33:17.212 --> 33:26.777
It's not African-American or Irish-American or Puerto Rican-American, well Puerto Rican-Americans are not really, you know, it's still America.

33:26.857 --> 33:27.258
I'm sorry.

33:28.318 --> 33:29.620
like Mexican-American.

33:30.320 --> 33:39.610
This idea that you had to have one foot in one place and one foot in another was already established when I was in college in this time of multiculturalism and all this other stuff.

33:40.070 --> 33:42.292
And multiculturalism is even a lie.

33:43.594 --> 33:45.636
America is not multicultural.

33:45.696 --> 33:46.757
America is America.

33:48.716 --> 34:08.017
And if we realize that and understand that and embrace it as in the way that, let's say, Tyrion Lannister would have said in Game of Thrones, you know, when he was talking to Jon Snow and telling him about how you're a bastard, you are a bastard, you should wear it as armor.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.399
don't be ashamed of it.

34:12.619 --> 34:37.005
And as Americans, with a sordid history with our own native people, a sordid history with African slavery, we are just one example in world history of a people that went from struggling to survive to trying to rule the world or trying to

34:37.805 --> 34:41.069
to whatever, I don't know.

34:41.790 --> 34:47.157
This idea that we need to now be ashamed of our past, where do we draw the line there?

34:47.257 --> 34:48.379
How do we draw the line there?

34:48.399 --> 34:50.201
And the beautiful thing of it is,

34:51.343 --> 35:04.867
is that as multiracial Americans, if we look for our multiracial identity, I know it's really easy for me because my multiracial identity comes out in my phenotype and it's obvious that I don't fit in any of these boxes.

35:04.907 --> 35:07.828
You can't be a six foot six Filipino.

35:07.948 --> 35:09.408
Like that doesn't make any sense.

35:10.168 --> 35:12.969
Yet for my whole life, that's basically what everybody's called me.

35:13.009 --> 35:15.170
You're a six foot six Filipino, but I'm not.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.271
I'm a mutt.

35:20.518 --> 35:28.525
My mom was already half Indian and Filipino, so she already looked a little different than most of the people around her.

35:29.946 --> 35:32.028
But she had the last name that worked.

35:32.869 --> 35:42.297
And so this Mutt identity is a way for us to wake up to their illusion on a different level.

35:42.337 --> 35:47.422
Because if we all understand that it's not black and white or brown

35:49.557 --> 36:00.085
America We're one of this is one of the few places where we don't have that problem generally speaking that That we don't have to claim.

36:00.525 --> 36:15.636
We're purebred Because most of us aren't and even if outwardly it looks like we are white or we are black In reality, that's probably not true and if we embrace that

36:16.584 --> 36:20.087
And we embrace our collective history, how we got here one way or another.

36:21.328 --> 36:24.550
But we now have the ability to pull our heads out.

36:26.351 --> 36:30.034
We have the ability to embrace our collective history.

36:30.054 --> 36:31.255
We're all here right now.

36:31.395 --> 36:34.557
Our children are all here right now.

36:34.697 --> 36:37.860
And most of us agree that we want our children to grow up here.

36:39.349 --> 36:49.621
And so if we all come together under that idea, rather than the idea that we all cheer for the White Sox or, you know, white pride, or we have to, there's a white race.

36:50.602 --> 36:54.627
They want us to fight for races because the races are already gone.

36:56.169 --> 37:01.811
They want us to fight for white because white is already gone.

37:02.351 --> 37:03.591
And what white do you mean?

37:03.611 --> 37:04.912
Am I white?

37:05.012 --> 37:08.293
My dad's family is white as far as we can trace it back.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.633
Does that make me white?

37:11.114 --> 37:14.295
Or is it because I got one drop of the other that makes me brown?

37:14.515 --> 37:18.236
And that argument is their argument.

37:20.148 --> 37:26.651
That argument is the same slave speak that these guys are arguing with regard to vaccine and which endpoint should we use?

37:28.112 --> 37:30.873
Well, ethnicity, what ethnicity are you?

37:30.933 --> 37:32.374
What box are you going to check?

37:32.454 --> 37:37.496
This is all part of the current trap that we are in as Americans.

37:39.770 --> 37:50.420
One of the best ways to throw off that trap would be to just say what Morgan Freeman said a long time ago, you agree not to talk about race, I'll agree not to talk about race, and then it'll be not a problem anymore.

37:54.684 --> 37:57.006
And we just all become Americans.

37:58.109 --> 38:20.324
It's a crazy idea, but the way that that would work is if we all embrace that we are on the same dirt, on the same land, with the same borders, with a lot of the same, you know, there's a lot of stuff that we could preserve together, take advantage of, and reorganize despite these people.

38:21.485 --> 38:22.786
In spite of those people.

38:23.867 --> 38:24.847
I don't know which one it is.

38:25.408 --> 38:25.708
Anyway.

38:27.208 --> 38:28.269
these choices in a more informed way.

38:28.289 --> 38:29.029
What am I talking about?

38:29.049 --> 38:44.918
So taking that one step further to the world of cancer research and cancer therapeutic regulation, there are a lot of different thoughts as to what the endpoints should be for approval of cancer therapeutics.

38:45.859 --> 38:47.340
Some say it's surrogate endpoints.

38:48.260 --> 38:55.249
Some have long been champions of clinical endpoints, that is, overall survival or disease-free survival.

38:55.650 --> 39:04.922
Where do you stand in sort of that spectrum of interest in the different endpoints, and what do you see as a requirement for approval in general?

39:05.876 --> 39:08.039
I really think for that we need both.

39:08.520 --> 39:23.099
You know, we will at FDA for life-threatening conditions that affect small populations that are very dire, where there are few treatment options, we will expedite approval through surrogate endpoints, endpoints that show tumor is being reduced or we're delaying the time until relapse.

39:23.479 --> 39:41.590
now you know what i think would be cool is if there was a whole movement in america to not give a shit about this not to care about maha at all but instead a whole movement in america to try to restore strict officiating in the nba and to somehow fix the problem that the three point

39:42.610 --> 39:53.400
line has caused and to better regulate the contracts of athletes and to protect them and to reorganize NCAA sports.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.781
You see what I mean?

39:55.421 --> 40:00.726
That would be America taking priority and American culture taking priority.

40:00.826 --> 40:02.568
Now maybe you're not into basketball,

40:03.393 --> 40:21.734
Maybe you can think of another sport or another activity that we do together as people, that we celebrate life together, that we could focus on and argue about instead of endpoints for vaccines or whether or not talc powder is any good and how we should regulate it.

40:24.150 --> 40:35.799
And I think that that's the trick, to try and find the questions that we want to prioritize, the ideas that we want to prioritize, and the initiatives that we want to prioritize.

40:35.819 --> 40:52.533
Because right now, as long as we use social media, we will always end up accidentally prioritizing something that social media wants us to prioritize, because we are being forced to choose from a list

40:54.793 --> 40:56.034
We have to write the list.

40:59.557 --> 41:03.560
We'll expedite those approvals through accelerated approval and a number of other pathways available to us.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.782
But that doesn't mean we're not also interested in overall survival.

41:07.002 --> 41:12.727
We can ascertain that with the long-term follow-up of trials, or with post-marketing studies, or with real-world data.

41:12.907 --> 41:21.714
And there's a number of innovations in this space, including work on target trials and other sorts of advances in the causal inference space from real-world data.

41:22.154 --> 41:23.635
So the answer to the question is really both.

41:24.856 --> 41:34.982
We will always embrace surrogate endpoints for people who have very concerning diseases, very rare conditions, few treatment options.

41:35.322 --> 41:37.724
We have an obligation at FDA to expedite those products to those.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.465
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

41:41.485 --> 41:48.107
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

41:48.127 --> 41:56.570
This is one of the only places where we talk about people being on a script, and that script is very easy, it's very simple.

41:57.070 --> 42:01.832
You have to accept that there was a novel virus that had killed millions of people, that millions more were saved.

42:02.612 --> 42:05.073
Um, and it could come again because it was gain of function.

42:05.113 --> 42:14.056
This is the former research and development director of the human genome project, Kevin McKernan, stating it very, very clearly is that this RNA exists.

42:14.336 --> 42:18.697
You can capture it and you can sequence it and you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

42:19.718 --> 42:20.058
And so

42:20.842 --> 42:24.826
These people were put on a script because this is a national security priority.

42:24.926 --> 42:27.368
Social media is part of that control mechanism.

42:27.968 --> 42:32.732
So if you're going to go on social media, you have to go on social media with the idea of undermining it.

42:33.293 --> 42:38.457
You can't go on it with the idea of gathering information or changing minds because that doesn't happen there.

42:39.481 --> 42:45.386
Um, and the reason why I know that is many, but one of the best reasons that I know that is Kevin McCairn.

42:45.426 --> 42:48.669
This is a guy who sought me out in March of 2020.

42:49.530 --> 42:53.153
And, uh, I was more or less in and out of his spell for five years.

42:53.193 --> 42:56.756
And I've certainly been followed by him for five years.

42:56.856 --> 43:00.039
It's been 28 days since he did a stream on rumble.

43:00.479 --> 43:02.801
And I think part of the reason might be because I keep.

43:03.582 --> 43:17.946
emphasizing that there's no way that this slide could exist unless this guy was put in place, because this guy has the same narrative that Kevin McKernan has with regard to the lab leak Scooby-Doo mystery.

43:18.666 --> 43:28.349
And I've explained it very succinctly for a few years now, and these guys make fun of me all the time for saying it this way, but they've fooled us into solving a mystery.

43:29.346 --> 43:32.308
They fooled us into solving a mystery about a novel virus.

43:33.108 --> 43:47.597
And all of these anti-vax health freedom organizations were put in place to make sure that we would never question the existence of the novel virus, how it is found, how it is sequenced, how it is whatever.

43:48.477 --> 43:53.480
And even Brian Hooker needed to be controlled in order for this to work.

43:54.929 --> 43:58.592
Because in 2013, he was saying not autism.

43:59.032 --> 44:05.097
And in 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, he was saying asymptomatic spread and autism.

44:05.238 --> 44:06.278
He was vaccine damaged.

44:06.639 --> 44:08.080
He was neurologically damaged.

44:08.961 --> 44:11.523
In condition that we will not call autism.

44:11.663 --> 44:13.224
I don't like the word autism.

44:14.105 --> 44:15.166
He was vaccine damaged.

44:15.526 --> 44:16.927
He was neurologically damaged.

44:17.788 --> 44:20.370
In condition that we will not call autism.

44:20.510 --> 44:22.051
I don't like the word autism.

44:22.952 --> 44:23.893
He was vaccine damaged.

44:26.587 --> 44:28.328
And so why did they do this?

44:28.909 --> 44:31.210
I think, unfortunately, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.232
got caught up in something much bigger than him.

44:33.812 --> 44:37.495
And he just went along with it because, you know, he's got a lot of people whispering in his ears.

44:38.056 --> 44:41.138
But that's how we got to the stage where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:42.019 --> 44:42.919
is where he is.

44:43.480 --> 44:55.869
And I think this plan was hatched by Tony Lyons and probably Steve Bannon already back in 2008 when Jesse Ventura wrote a book with Sky Horse Publishing and in the epilogue,

44:57.284 --> 45:00.905
they tell a story about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:00.945 --> 45:07.928
becoming vice president after being an independent candidate and joining up with one of the two candidates.

45:08.708 --> 45:08.928
See?

45:09.889 --> 45:13.230
And Steve Bannon was advocating for him to be vice president.

45:14.403 --> 45:15.303
like for a while.

45:16.164 --> 45:28.488
And that's what the narrative is that includes that presidential candidate getting shot, which in the book is supposedly Jesse Ventura, but you know, substitute Trump in there and you have basically the story.

45:29.108 --> 45:35.911
I think that it's very likely that the biological narrative that we've been stuck in, the hamster wheel that we've been running in that started with

45:36.511 --> 45:45.834
spike protein and you know gain of function and furin cleavage sites and HIV inserts and Staphylococcan and Teratoxin B homologies.

45:46.374 --> 45:57.997
All of that stuff was probably created by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone among others but these are the two guys that are now on stage and have been on stage on social media since the beginning especially this fella.

45:59.037 --> 46:01.519
And they all agree that, you know, PCR works.

46:01.599 --> 46:02.940
It's just a matter of how you do it.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.321
And we can find the virus.

46:04.361 --> 46:05.282
We can sequence it.

46:05.302 --> 46:08.285
We can put it in cells and recapitulate disease.

46:08.905 --> 46:11.427
Which is the same thing as saying there is a novel virus.

46:11.507 --> 46:12.608
It killed millions of people.

46:12.648 --> 46:14.750
Millions more were saved by the vaccines.

46:15.530 --> 46:18.252
And it could come again because, you know, gain of function is real.

46:19.033 --> 46:21.214
That's what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

46:21.174 --> 46:30.818
's book actually says, the one that they tried to trap me in writing and becoming the expert of and essentially fired me when I no longer went along with it.

46:32.579 --> 46:33.639
And that's where we are.

46:33.659 --> 46:41.303
I don't think that he's aware of how we are screwed if we don't wake up our children to this mess.

46:42.216 --> 46:57.761
The adults that are in Congress and in the bureaucracy of our government are probably already lost because they have been taught this mystery and taught this narrative over their entire career.

46:59.471 --> 47:04.155
And so they're not coming at it from an angle where it's gonna be easy for them to see through it.

47:04.235 --> 47:17.446
Even somebody like Ron Johnson is coming at it from an angle where he's had security briefings and lanyard meetings and secret meetings and private meetings and skiff meetings where they talk about this stuff, even before 9-11.

47:17.506 --> 47:22.710
Because of course, if you're paying attention to Mark Kulak, you know that before 9-11, it was all bio.

47:25.598 --> 47:32.382
So these people have been rehearsing this script, even if they're unwittingly rehearsing a script, they think that they're getting ready for something.

47:32.842 --> 47:33.983
They are ready for it.

47:34.083 --> 47:34.904
It's here now.

47:36.224 --> 47:48.952
The laughable thing is to see that Steve Bannon knew it could be a lab leak in January of 2020, that Steve Bannon had Steve Hatfield on his show, The War Room in 2020, that Steve Bannon

47:51.423 --> 47:56.427
is the guy who works for Goldman Sachs, like Aaron Seery worked for Goldman Sachs.

47:56.487 --> 47:58.469
Like, ladies and gentlemen, it's bad news.

47:59.269 --> 48:14.902
Because you can also see a red thread through the father of Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein, the financial advisor, numerical advisor to Peter Thiel of Thiel Capital, because his father, Les Weinstein, was in the Department of Justice of his father, Robert F. Kennedy.

48:16.203 --> 48:19.845
And as an intellectual property lawyer, no less,

48:20.862 --> 48:38.071
over the thalidomide scandal, no less, and the formation of the FDA, no less, which was from the beginning of the pandemic in the way, as Kevin McKernan said on podcast after podcast in 2020, intellectual property expert has said the FDA is in the way, it's corrupt, it's whatever.

48:38.492 --> 48:40.993
These guys have said the FDA is corrupt, whatever.

48:41.013 --> 48:47.416
And now we're hearing those two foreign guys a minute ago saying that vaccines are great, we just have to do different end points.

48:47.456 --> 48:50.238
They're big fans of vaccines.

48:52.110 --> 48:53.693
This is for all the marbles.

48:53.893 --> 48:57.900
It is for the children, the grandchildren of earth, not the children of earth.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.922
They're already alive.

48:59.523 --> 49:03.190
It's the grandchildren of earth because they need the data from birth to death.

49:05.393 --> 49:07.534
So they're just, they're ramping up to that.

49:07.574 --> 49:10.336
They know that this window's open for a generation or two.

49:10.396 --> 49:11.036
They got you.

49:11.277 --> 49:13.358
They got the population pyramid mapped out.

49:13.398 --> 49:14.358
They know what they're missing.

49:14.398 --> 49:15.679
They know what they already collected.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.560
They know what they can store and what they can't.

49:17.600 --> 49:22.623
They might even need to do a couple iterations of the exercise of collecting and storing it.

49:23.244 --> 49:26.706
And so maybe this was the first or already on their second or third trial of it.

49:26.746 --> 49:31.729
I don't know because I'm not behind the scenes of this malevolent operation and neither is she.

49:32.881 --> 50:00.095
But understand that if you go on a podcast and two of the other people that are being interviewed, like say Callie and Dr. Cruz, are lying together on the same script, then Mary Talley Bowden has no chance of either learning it, nor does she have a chance of making any useful progress in understanding if they are working together to make sure that she doesn't covertly.

50:00.894 --> 50:06.496
And I assure you that this happens and has happened and has been weaponized against us.

50:06.936 --> 50:10.117
And instead, what they would like you to be concerned about is AI.

50:10.137 --> 50:12.798
Oh my goodness, AI is gonna get us.

50:12.898 --> 50:22.522
No, coordinated liars on social media podcasts are thousands of times more dangerous than an AI algorithm run wild.

50:23.622 --> 50:24.402
I assure you.

50:25.503 --> 50:27.443
Seek the truth, ladies and gentlemen.

50:28.144 --> 50:28.884
Seek the truth.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.422
Otherwise you will be subject to this kind of thing.

50:34.464 --> 50:36.346
Like I was subject to this kind of thing.

50:36.886 --> 50:42.231
Tommy stands no chance of learning anything if these two are singing a song together.

50:43.652 --> 50:46.995
And certainly Tommy's viewers have no chance.

50:48.957 --> 50:50.238
That's how podcasts work.

50:50.979 --> 50:52.640
That's why I'm dangerous, right?

50:52.680 --> 50:56.164
Because if you don't follow what I'm saying, then you're gone.

50:57.025 --> 51:00.309
that if you don't believe it, don't understand it, there's nobody to catch me.

51:00.749 --> 51:05.975
There's nobody to say, yeah, but Jay and keep you there so that you could agree with one or the other.

51:06.075 --> 51:07.056
You could follow both.

51:07.096 --> 51:08.158
There's nothing like that.

51:08.198 --> 51:10.020
It's either I hold you or you, I don't.

51:10.681 --> 51:15.226
It's a pretty, it's a pretty dangerous tight rope to walk in the grand scheme of grifts.

51:20.014 --> 51:22.015
Too bad I'm not grifting, ladies and gentlemen.

51:22.035 --> 51:22.735
Let's get some.

51:23.455 --> 51:24.576
This is really important.

51:24.676 --> 51:26.596
Why is this scripted bullshit?

51:26.636 --> 51:26.957
Why?

51:27.437 --> 51:44.703
Not only to hide the murder and lies, but to fundamentally change the way that we think about ourselves as people into humans, from people into experimental animals, from people into communities,

51:45.973 --> 51:49.775
from people into races.

51:52.115 --> 51:59.338
It's scripted bullshit because social media is going to become the supranational control over all people.

52:01.719 --> 52:05.681
And it's how they will take control of the evolution of the species.

52:08.373 --> 52:18.496
Because if they can use social media to convince our kids not to have kids, or convince our kids not to have pets, social media is an amazing, amazing, powerful thing, right?

52:18.536 --> 52:19.157
And they can.

52:21.857 --> 52:29.240
They can use social media to make sure that our kids never, ever, ever realize that intramuscular injection is a terrible methodology.

52:29.640 --> 52:32.201
They never, ever realize that virology is not

52:33.277 --> 52:48.066
a high-fidelity science, it's almost exclusively based on transfection, and that public health is not a very well-justified idea.

52:50.652 --> 52:53.754
And they're never gonna meet a social studies teacher who's gonna tell them that.

52:53.814 --> 53:06.823
They're never gonna meet a biology teacher who's gonna tell them that gain of function is a myth or that autism is a myth or that pandemics are a myth because they're never gonna meet a biology teacher until they meet me that's capable of teaching it.

53:08.604 --> 53:13.508
That's aware of the way that a molecular phylogeny

53:15.018 --> 53:23.149
myth has been used to, I mean, really just disconnect ourselves from the nature of life.

53:24.470 --> 53:29.457
It is a crazy, crazy thing that I've slowly become aware of.

53:29.477 --> 53:32.361
Who has perished as a result of COVID-19.

53:32.421 --> 53:33.202
This is where we are.

53:34.622 --> 53:42.929
But when the vaccine became widely available in 2021, deaths sharply declined, and many lives have been saved in the years since.

53:43.549 --> 53:53.017
Many in this room, speaking for myself as well as others, probably have been saved from this disease because of those vaccines.

53:53.237 --> 53:57.841
One study found that 3 million American deaths were averted.

53:59.322 --> 54:02.465
18 million hospitalizations were avoided.

54:03.007 --> 54:12.916
and $1 trillion in health care costs were saved in the United States in just the first two years after COVID vaccines were distributed.

54:13.436 --> 54:17.640
I'd like this study entered into the record, Mr. Chairman, if there's no objection.

54:17.660 --> 54:18.200
No objection.

54:20.342 --> 54:25.747
Now, vaccines not only saved American lives, they enabled us to get back on our feet economically.

54:25.807 --> 54:29.871
They enabled the American economy to recover.

54:32.298 --> 54:42.386
Let's try to think of where we were five years ago with a deadly unknown virus spreading through America and through the world.

54:42.526 --> 54:52.034
We were only able to come so far because of the vaccines and the researchers who developed them and the public health officials who distribute them.

54:53.415 --> 54:57.739
And now those individuals are again under attack, our public health officials.

54:59.460 --> 55:01.242
I've looked at

55:03.086 --> 55:15.456
Those documents, maybe not all of them, that the majority alleges show that the Biden administration or those public health officials suppressed evidence of side effects.

55:16.057 --> 55:16.637
Let's be clear.

55:16.677 --> 55:22.942
The allegation is that they purposefully concealed evidence.

55:26.105 --> 55:30.468
I am unable to support that conclusion with this evidence.

55:30.649 --> 55:31.009
In fact,

55:32.301 --> 55:51.687
The primary piece of evidence for this claim is that the CDC did not issue a notice on its health alert network, HAN, in May 2021, while it was still analyzing the evidence about myocarditis.

55:53.288 --> 55:54.608
We're talking about myocarditis.

55:54.688 --> 55:57.069
The chairman has referenced other side effects.

55:57.089 --> 55:59.450
I'm not sure what he means.

56:00.592 --> 56:14.997
But what I see as I look at that evidence is public health officials wrestling with what to do and what kind of warning to issue.

56:15.817 --> 56:19.318
And again, side effects must be studied and communicated.

56:20.218 --> 56:25.540
And that's what I see happening in these documents that the majority has released.

56:27.654 --> 56:55.645
So we have to distinguish, I think, between differences of opinion under the pressure of a pandemic and separate the opinions of scientists who are working for the greater good and, frankly, others who may simply be seeking to sow distrust while they profit off misinformation and fear.

56:56.638 --> 57:11.370
frankly, deeply concerned about some of today's witnesses because they have a financial interest in fomenting distrust about COVID-19 vaccines and pushing untested alternative remedies over proven treatments.

57:11.430 --> 57:23.539
In fact, two of today's witnesses are executives at something called the Wellness Company, which sells the disproven treatment, ivermectin, and a host of

57:24.725 --> 57:36.153
untested supplements, which include something called quote, unquote, ultimate spike detox, $18 and $89 and 99 cents a bottle.

57:37.994 --> 57:42.697
And you understand that this is a scripted setup, right?

57:42.917 --> 57:48.901
That the Maha movement can be easily made fun of by this side by design.

57:50.876 --> 58:02.598
It's not accident that we're coming here, even if this is just a monkey, which I'm sure this is just a script reading monkey, but he wouldn't be there still for as long as he was if he wasn't, but understand that it's a show for us.

58:04.258 --> 58:05.919
It's a show for us.

58:07.659 --> 58:13.820
And in a few minutes, this guy right here from my home state of Wisconsin is gonna say, it's a show for us.

58:14.980 --> 58:19.421
We're gonna just give American people this show and we're gonna let them decide.

58:23.186 --> 58:27.468
This is scripted bullshit because it is a trap for our grandchildren.

58:28.129 --> 58:35.432
And we are going to willingly give our grandchildren up to this trap if we don't look and see it for what it is.

58:35.452 --> 58:45.698
Another makes money from suing vaccine companies and still others are pushing unsupported research while rejecting the proven scientists on COVID and other vaccines.

58:46.735 --> 58:55.963
Let's be very clear that fear-mongering and rushing to conclusions without examining the evidence can lead to tremendous harm.

58:56.263 --> 59:01.507
And this risk is not just hypothetical or rhetorical.

59:02.688 --> 59:10.135
Misinformation about the safety of vaccines has led to a deadly outbreak of a preventable disease.

59:11.576 --> 59:12.857
We all know it, measles.

59:14.093 --> 59:17.616
Just 25 years ago, measles was declared.

59:18.036 --> 59:20.498
You can't really hear it if you don't have headphones on.

59:20.538 --> 59:27.843
But in the background, you can hear that there are people at the panel or behind the panel that are like groaning when he says this stuff.

59:27.943 --> 59:28.444
It's hilarious.

59:28.484 --> 59:32.647
Eliminated in the United States since then.

59:34.192 --> 59:38.155
Conspiracy theories, some financially motivated, have caused vaccination.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.737
They should look demoralized though, right?

59:40.877 --> 59:46.862
Because they know their job is to pacify with theater.

59:49.064 --> 59:52.927
These are the social media gladiators, basically.

59:52.987 --> 59:55.509
You know, it's like American gladiators.

59:55.589 --> 59:57.290
Wow, that's what we should call it.

59:58.651 --> 01:00:00.693
It is, it's like American gladiators.

01:00:00.733 --> 01:00:01.714
This is bullshit.

01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:05.577
Maybe American gladiators was relatively real.

01:00:05.617 --> 01:00:07.138
I mean, they use these pad things.

01:00:07.178 --> 01:00:08.558
They were hitting each other pretty hard.

01:00:08.618 --> 01:00:12.561
I mean, I know nitro was real rates to plummet.

01:00:14.002 --> 01:00:24.668
Last September, the CDC warned that declining childhood vaccination could lead to a resurgence of a preventable disease like measles and rotavirus.

01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:32.533
Exactly what is happening today, as of today, more than a thousand Americans have been diagnosed with measles this year.

01:00:33.837 --> 01:00:37.922
In 31 states, many of them children, so far three have died.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.566
These deaths were preventable.

01:00:43.429 --> 01:00:44.270
They could have been avoided.

01:00:45.432 --> 01:00:50.819
But for the efforts of misinformation proponents that have spread lies and created fears,

01:00:51.223 --> 01:00:54.765
There has been so much misinformation and fear since COVID-19.

01:00:54.865 --> 01:01:08.295
Remember, the presumption here is, is that the Department of Defense or intelligence agencies or weaponized piles of money like supranational organizations would never spread misinformation on social media.

01:01:08.775 --> 01:01:20.343
That social media would never be used to militarized, to spread misinformation in a militarized way to perhaps gain maximum compliance.

01:01:21.564 --> 01:01:28.866
The implication here from a likely red in person is that the government never does that.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.806
The government would never do it.

01:01:30.906 --> 01:01:32.527
Governments would never do it.

01:01:33.367 --> 01:01:41.409
And governments would never collude with other governments, you know, like in a NATO type organization kind of way to, to, to control

01:01:43.393 --> 01:01:46.775
public opinion using social media against us.

01:01:46.815 --> 01:01:48.096
They would never do that.

01:01:48.316 --> 01:01:55.261
Only the wellness company who's selling $80 bottles of spike enthusiast stuff would do that.

01:01:55.341 --> 01:02:07.949
Now I'm not saying that the wellness company is good, but this joker is trying to make us believe that the only thing going wrong with the pandemic is that there's these, all these bad actors, like, you know, the wellness company, give me a break.

01:02:08.009 --> 01:02:12.913
That's what Paul, the, the amazing Polly told us on X for shit sake.

01:02:13.713 --> 01:02:21.338
emerge that during the height of the pandemic, health care workers and public health officials were often harassed and threatened.

01:02:21.978 --> 01:02:24.840
Some of them continue to fear for their lives.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:41.529
If you haven't seen it, Mark Kulak did a really awesome episode this morning, which basically, I think, frames the appearance of Robert Malone and the pattern of behavior of Robert Malone the best.

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:57.880
And that is that when Mike Callahan called him and said, you need to spin your team up, it wasn't to spin a team up about repurposed drugs or spin a team up about, I don't know, antidepondent enhancement or spin a team up about

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.762
He needed to spin a narrative control team up.

01:03:05.144 --> 01:03:12.089
And that's what you see with him on stage with Lee Min Yan and with Ryan Cole in churches in 2021.

01:03:12.569 --> 01:03:18.753
That's what you see with him, you know, doing the six international COVID summits and visiting the Vatican and all this other shit.

01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:20.954
That's narrative control.

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:24.537
That's not some guy who's a really international whistleblower.

01:03:24.557 --> 01:03:26.398
I got to go everywhere and teach this stuff, man.

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:45.656
But during the first frightening year of the pandemic, the Trump administration withheld critical information from the public, made baseless promises that the virus would magically disappear – I think I'm almost quoting the President – magically disappear, engage

01:03:46.633 --> 01:03:52.279
in unfounded conspiracy theories and sham science about COVID-19 treatments and sowed the seeds.

01:03:52.699 --> 01:03:59.806
This is the reason why I don't think it's likely that Donald Trump went off script with the warp speed.

01:03:59.946 --> 01:04:08.315
I think it's more likely that he was offered a number of alternatives and they could easily sell one alternative as better than the other.

01:04:08.495 --> 01:04:10.457
And maybe he chose a different one, but

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:14.033
These were not lose-win situations.

01:04:14.093 --> 01:04:18.059
It wasn't a brilliant idea on his part to speed stuff up.

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:18.960
I don't think so.

01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:24.368
If that would be the case, I think then that

01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:32.387
there would be more of a narrative in the Trump sect about the, you know, the resistance to it.

01:04:32.588 --> 01:04:36.090
You know, there would have been a more public resistance to it.

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:39.052
You know, like Fauci didn't want to rush anything.

01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:46.398
The FDA, you know, you know, Peter Marks was really against rushing it, but Donald Trump said, screw it, I'm going to do it anyway.

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:48.019
And I don't think that happened.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.861
I think that they gave him two alternatives.

01:04:50.901 --> 01:04:54.244
He chose one and they told him he was a genius for choosing that one.

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.625
And they're still playing him now like that.

01:04:57.665 --> 01:05:03.866
And that's, I think the most, because I don't think many presidents are ever choosing anything.

01:05:03.926 --> 01:05:09.967
They're given choices because it's too big of a ship or something like that.

01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:14.128
Of distrust in public health institution.

01:05:15.648 --> 01:05:18.969
And then to the tremendous credit of President Trump,

01:05:20.199 --> 01:05:21.980
he fast-tracked the vaccine.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:22.701
See?

01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:24.382
And he's willing to give him credit.

01:05:25.062 --> 01:05:27.904
Oh, to the credit of President Trump.

01:05:27.944 --> 01:05:29.625
And again, I think that was like a setup.

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:35.309
They made him feel smart about it, so much so that he went on the campaign trail last year telling everybody that it was smart.

01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:37.230
I don't think that's accident.

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.191
I think that's duping.

01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.512
Let me repeat.

01:05:40.232 --> 01:05:48.698
To the credit of the Trump administration, the President of the United States fast-tracked the vaccine and

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.446
Saved lives.

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.969
I didn't even have to make him repeat it.

01:05:53.009 --> 01:05:53.709
He repeated it.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.511
And it saved lives.

01:05:55.591 --> 01:05:58.014
And he's going to take credit for that until he dies.

01:05:58.074 --> 01:05:58.775
Of course he will.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:00.256
It's millions.

01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:01.758
It saved millions.

01:06:05.502 --> 01:06:06.643
We need to learn from history.

01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:11.148
we're seeing the same pattern now.

01:06:11.848 --> 01:06:16.232
We need to learn from history is really amazing, an amazing enchantment.

01:06:16.352 --> 01:06:24.259
I hear an amazing enchantment there because what that does is it sets up a presupposition that you understand the history.

01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:29.604
I know you understand the history and we have to learn from the history.

01:06:29.644 --> 01:06:31.425
Well, he just told you the history, right?

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:32.466
So it's an enchantment.

01:06:33.067 --> 01:06:34.328
It's an amazing enchantment.

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:58.865
Those same seeds of doubt and distrust have been nurtured by the president's choices for key positions in this administration, including the decision to install a well-known vaccine skeptic as the head of HHS and to fill our public health agencies with conspiracists.

01:07:00.406 --> 01:07:03.627
And let's bring it right to the present day.

01:07:04.868 --> 01:07:05.508
Just yesterday,

01:07:08.174 --> 01:07:20.100
It was announced that the FDA may start restricting access to new COVID boosters to those over 65 or with a narrow set of preexisting conditions.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.521
Now, we ought to be very frank here.

01:07:24.802 --> 01:07:36.248
Discerning what exactly this new guidance may be at the moment is confusing and the troubling

01:07:37.201 --> 01:07:45.213
news leaves many questions unanswered about whether and how people can actually access vaccines if they want to do so.

01:07:47.448 --> 01:07:57.397
It's almost like on one side it's about free speech and choice and on the other side it's about free access and stuff like that.

01:07:57.517 --> 01:08:02.542
So it's kind of like, I don't know, it's kind of like the same as other things.

01:08:02.762 --> 01:08:06.566
It's really weird until you see it as scripted bullshit like it is.

01:08:07.266 --> 01:08:08.747
I'm going to be back in a second.

01:08:09.187 --> 01:08:15.069
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:20.532
If you want to share the stream, you can share it at stream.gigaom.bio after it's transcoded.

01:08:21.492 --> 01:08:32.117
And if you have the means, can I humbly request that you go to gigaombiological.com and find a way to chip in something to help this stream keep going.

01:08:33.657 --> 01:08:39.620
I want to dedicate as much time as I can to the production of a high school curriculum that will teach this biology.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.602
I'm going to be back in a second with a little bit of a summary.

01:08:43.322 --> 01:08:44.523
Thank you very much for being here.

01:08:45.383 --> 01:08:48.925
Don't forget, this is a multi-generational plan.

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:52.767
This is a national, multinational security priority.

01:08:53.887 --> 01:08:58.188
And social media is one of the ways that they keep our eyes off of the ball.

01:08:58.288 --> 01:09:16.473
So Unfortunately as fun as it is, we're gonna have to wean ourselves from it, especially substack and X Unfortunately, I think those are our tools of theirs and they are using the content that we put on those platforms in their AI generation and

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:24.737
Uh, we are allowing them to fine tune their military tools to control our consciousness.

01:09:24.877 --> 01:09:25.857
And we don't want to do that.

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:30.419
So we got to get off social media, start sending emails again, start making phone calls.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:31.180
Thanks for being here.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:31.800
I'll see you in a minute.

01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:34.541
I don't care how you get there.

01:09:34.561 --> 01:09:37.223
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:09:37.243 --> 01:09:39.864
The goal is to win.

01:09:49.892 --> 01:09:50.032
so

01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:28.061
I've seen the toughest around.

01:10:28.201 --> 01:10:30.722
And I know, baby, just how you feel.

01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:34.842
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real.

01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:37.883
Can't you see me standing here?

01:10:38.003 --> 01:10:42.084
I've got my back against the wrecking machine.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:45.444
I eat the worst that you've seen.

01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:59.594
How can't you see what I mean?

01:10:59.934 --> 01:11:03.777
Ah, might as well jump!

01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:05.839
Jump!

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:07.940
Might as well jump!

01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:11.063
Go ahead and jump!

01:11:11.443 --> 01:11:12.584
Jump!

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:15.546
Go ahead and jump!

01:11:15.707 --> 01:11:16.727
Oh, hey you!

01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:17.668
Who said that?

01:11:17.728 --> 01:11:19.229
Baby, how you been?

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.494
You won't know until you begin Can't you see me standing here?

01:11:31.594 --> 01:11:44.247
I got my back against the record machine I ain't the worst that you've seen Why can't you see what I mean?

01:12:55.818 --> 01:12:56.682
you

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:36.016
you

01:14:05.586 --> 01:14:08.208
OK, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for staying.

01:14:08.288 --> 01:14:10.909
We're going to start the second half of the show today.

01:14:10.929 --> 01:14:16.532
Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:14:19.314 --> 01:14:21.935
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

01:14:21.975 --> 01:14:24.877
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

01:14:25.497 --> 01:14:32.901
A lot of my ideas are available in diluted and obfuscated form on the substack called Woodhouse 76.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:42.969
Um, that is run by a trader in America named Jessica Hockett in cooperation with Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson of Panda.

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:49.976
Um, and they have fake arguments with Claire Craig of Heart and Pierre Corey of FLCCC, now IMA.

01:14:50.656 --> 01:14:59.524
Um, and also with Mike Eden and with Jay Bhattacharya, of course, because again, this is all one big show and, uh, you're not going to see me in it, even though I helped

01:15:00.004 --> 01:15:06.926
The current Health and Human Services Secretary write his book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, that Malone can't seem to get the title right.

01:15:07.386 --> 01:15:12.107
And then I used to work for Children's Health Defense, been at a few barbecues with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:15:12.587 --> 01:15:19.169
He always defers to me as the biologist until he got this job at NIH, and now he's pretty good at biology, I guess.

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.510
So, a lot of people are whining

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.772
about the idea that I never write anything down.

01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:32.639
And so I thought I'd write something down today and walk you through it and see if this gets anybody past the goal here.

01:15:33.019 --> 01:15:43.268
I might even put this slide on Substack later today because, you know, maybe Substack is a way of getting people off Substack is by occasionally posting to it.

01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:43.869
I don't know.

01:15:43.889 --> 01:15:45.910
I don't know what my strategy is going to be.

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:48.292
I just know that I'm going to read this to you right now.

01:15:49.093 --> 01:15:54.236
I'm going to go over here and just transform to the reading mode.

01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:57.738
I'm going to put myself down here at the bottom.

01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:07.643
I just want to explain a few things that have to do with my current summary of the situation, if you will.

01:16:08.443 --> 01:16:17.089
and reiterate what I think are some of the big points that everybody whines about and has been whining about ever since I've been hammering on Robert Malone.

01:16:17.129 --> 01:16:22.333
I'm getting a lot of flack in the background that I don't have any clear points or I don't know what it is.

01:16:22.773 --> 01:16:24.535
So I thought I'd clear some things up for you.

01:16:25.235 --> 01:16:27.297
And again, welcome to the show.

01:16:27.357 --> 01:16:28.237
Thanks for being here.

01:16:28.257 --> 01:16:29.058
Thanks for sharing.

01:16:29.758 --> 01:16:32.560
And if you can, really thanks for sharing.

01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:37.224
First point is that in American law, there's a principle that goes something like,

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:40.212
And so remember the sort of...

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:44.033
The caveat here is that I'm not a law student.

01:16:44.253 --> 01:16:53.937
And if you're not from America, then a lot of these terms won't mean anything likely in your set of legal precedents and legal principles.

01:16:53.997 --> 01:16:58.979
But in America, there are a few legal principles, and you can discuss them in certain ways.

01:16:59.039 --> 01:17:01.680
And I might not be exactly accurate, great.

01:17:02.261 --> 01:17:07.103
I'm not a certified fundamentalist, a certified

01:17:08.163 --> 01:17:10.464
constitutional scholar or something like that.

01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:20.089
I'm not even an L1 law student, but I do know that when I say these combinations of words like this to lawyers, they either have one of two reactions.

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:23.010
Either they say, holy shit, where did you learn that?

01:17:24.091 --> 01:17:24.131
Or,

01:17:25.282 --> 01:17:36.008
they kind of react with a blank look and say that they don't really think it's an appropriate time for these things or we need there's no one withstanding or some other thing and then they walk away.

01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:37.929
So I'll just read this out loud.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:47.975
Any law that allows suspension of fundamental rights based on the rational basis test alone without holding the government to strict scrutiny is unconstitutional.

01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:54.580
So I have to explain a few things in there for the non-American audience and for the American audience alike.

01:17:55.361 --> 01:17:58.464
Fundamental rights are the rights that are codified in the Constitution.

01:17:59.765 --> 01:18:04.989
And based on the rational basis test means that you just have to have a hunch or a reason.

01:18:05.049 --> 01:18:07.752
The rational basis test means you're not crazy.

01:18:09.558 --> 01:18:25.404
And so when something can be made by the rational basis test alone, for example, like zoning laws, if the mayor of your city and the township decide to change the zoning laws in your region, that

01:18:26.024 --> 01:18:30.267
They can do that and that's suspending fundamental rights.

01:18:30.327 --> 01:18:32.048
You can't build a house there anymore.

01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:40.074
You can only have a business there or vice versa or any other number of zoning laws or maybe even putting a pipe there or something like that.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:45.078
And those are technically suspensions of fundamental rights that occur on the rational basis test alone.

01:18:45.438 --> 01:18:51.162
Those guys in that room or that guy in the room or that lady in the room just has to have a good reason and a reasonable reason.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.744
And they don't even have to explain what it is.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.711
And that's how the PREP Act is written.

01:19:02.372 --> 01:19:14.297
That an indefinite national emergency that suspends all kinds of fundamental rights, never mind the legislated protections that are built in, in a number of these administrative things, but

01:19:14.778 --> 01:19:18.062
But all of those things are suspended on the rational basis test alone.

01:19:18.082 --> 01:19:30.155
And at this time, it's the rational basis defined by the whimsical mind of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who at one time thought it would be a clever idea to put a bicycle and a dead bear in a park.

01:19:31.056 --> 01:19:31.597
It's a joke.

01:19:34.696 --> 01:19:42.243
So we are due substantive due process for any such encroachment, meaning that they got to do some kind of ritual before they do this.

01:19:42.383 --> 01:19:43.524
They can't just do it.

01:19:43.584 --> 01:19:57.556
They have to have a list of reasons or a threshold or describe some set of circumstances that would allow them to do this before they do it, not after or a sidebar from it should be in the law.

01:19:57.716 --> 01:19:58.477
And it's not.

01:19:59.534 --> 01:20:08.917
And because it's not, the PREP Act is unconstitutional on its face because it allows the suspension of fundamental rights without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:17.459
Now, if you just learn the definitions of those words and understand that combination of them, you can stun a lawyer.

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:32.638
because the pandemic is a prepped act emergency declaration that is still suspending a number of fundamental rights right now on the rational basis test alone, essentially Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:33.639
's rational basis.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.801
That's point number one.

01:20:38.122 --> 01:20:42.524
Point number two is yes, virology is a fraud, but like PCR, it's not fake.

01:20:43.685 --> 01:20:45.106
There is only fraudulent use.

01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:50.013
No one denies bacteriophages, including the no virus crew.

01:20:50.433 --> 01:20:56.476
And that is because there is an irreducibly complex background noise of genetic signals all around us.

01:20:56.536 --> 01:20:59.697
And a large portion of that noise is bacteriophages.

01:21:00.758 --> 01:21:04.019
This noise is the biological source foundation of their myth.

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.561
And it is co-opting, it's co-opting started.

01:21:08.421 --> 01:21:09.162
Should that be it's?

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.682
No, it is co-opting.

01:21:10.743 --> 01:21:11.503
That should be it's.

01:21:13.064 --> 01:21:17.593
It's co-opting started with metabiota, Nathan Wolf, and metagenomic sequencing.

01:21:17.793 --> 01:21:19.737
I am actually telling you that

01:21:23.615 --> 01:21:38.963
The book Viral Storm in 2011 is an admission the existence of metabiota and what they sold on stage in TED Talks is exactly the fraud of virology and exactly the explanation that I'm giving you here.

01:21:39.443 --> 01:21:45.667
An irreducibly complex background of phages and bacterial origin signals.

01:21:46.687 --> 01:21:56.732
were confounded as direct human pathogens, exclusively generalized across as exclusively human pathogens.

01:21:56.932 --> 01:22:04.115
And somebody like Nathan Wolf was responsible for establishing that science.

01:22:04.175 --> 01:22:09.537
Somebody like Peter Daszak was responsible for establishing that science.

01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:14.059
Somebody like Ralph Baric was establishing that science.

01:22:14.099 --> 01:22:15.300
Do you see what I'm saying here?

01:22:17.119 --> 01:22:19.060
It's all one illusion.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:25.863
And so they needed a neutered, useless, no-virus crew to be part of the illusion.

01:22:26.043 --> 01:22:44.211
Otherwise, you might get here, where you realize that first and foremost, most of virology is based on experiments that start with a synthetic pure quantity of the DNA or RNA that they purport is viral, and therefore are just transfection experiments.

01:22:46.601 --> 01:22:54.927
This does not mean that there are no signals to be found, nor does it mean that contagious phenomenon do not exist, but the explanation for them is not human pathogens.

01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:59.169
The explanation for them is not mother nature out to get us.

01:22:59.209 --> 01:23:05.013
The explanation for them is not EcoHealth Alliance, nor is it gain of function and the diffuse proposal.

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:07.415
It is a national security myth.

01:23:14.039 --> 01:23:14.860
Should be moving here.

01:23:16.374 --> 01:23:16.954
It's not moving.

01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:18.054
Oh, resume slideshow.

01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:18.334
Sorry.

01:23:21.075 --> 01:23:28.597
RNA is a class of molecule without the requisite biological and chemical characteristics that would permit any kind of sustained spontaneous spread.

01:23:29.257 --> 01:23:35.418
This concept is antithetical to everything we have been taught about the unique biological chemistry of DNA.

01:23:36.718 --> 01:23:44.000
Only virology primary literature makes claims otherwise about RNA, and those papers are all written by players.

01:23:45.390 --> 01:24:03.356
And two very good clues are all the papers about remdesivir and all the papers about XON, the supposed proofreading protein in coronaviruses, because these papers are all written by people associated with Ralph Baric and Mark Denison, the two guys that supposedly found remdesivir.

01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:04.877
And what does remdesivir do?

01:24:05.297 --> 01:24:08.998
It interferes with the proofreading of coronavirus RNA.

01:24:12.677 --> 01:24:18.879
which is the foundational myth of an RNA pandemic because otherwise they all admit that RNA could never do this.

01:24:18.899 --> 01:24:26.482
I mean, it's just the coronaviruses have this real special function that allows them to have this gigantic genome and not make any errors.

01:24:28.043 --> 01:24:37.106
And after five years, Vinay Prasad thinks that that signal has become and stayed a uniform signal that's like still the J6 lineage.

01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:46.363
So that's where you go if you want to train yourself on this stuff.

01:24:49.364 --> 01:24:52.805
PCR is not a valid diagnostic as it was used in 2020.

01:24:52.865 --> 01:24:57.927
The use of PCR as a tool on the academic bench requires vigorous experimental discipline.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:04.654
that includes replicate experiments, as well as exquisitely chosen and designed negative and positive controls.

01:25:05.235 --> 01:25:15.662
The EU-granted diagnostic products used in 2020 and 21 and 22 actually had none of these widely accepted attributes that make PCR a gold standard methodology in academia.

01:25:16.483 --> 01:25:26.870
It could be that many or all of the current products on the market also lack these crucial methodological checkpoints that would be the basis for any claims of high-fidelity detection capability.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:35.156
This is potentially massive system-wide fraud that the current FDA is never gonna check by design.

01:25:36.657 --> 01:25:42.402
Jessica Rose isn't saying that, Kevin McKernan's not gonna tell you that, but it's definitely true.

01:25:44.684 --> 01:25:49.208
The FDA should have evaluated every diagnostic product as a separate medical device.

01:25:49.268 --> 01:25:54.453
Perhaps more importantly, under the still in effect PrEP Act emergency, the FDA will never be asked to revisit it.

01:25:55.444 --> 01:26:03.286
and PCR diagnostics instead will focus on future regulatory activities only, which you heard in the town hall yesterday.

01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:13.368
Instead, PCR testing as a standard has likely created the ideal medical remnant source for several human genome project related national security priorities.

01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:15.689
How do you like them apples?

01:26:19.144 --> 01:26:27.668
And so the national security priority for the USA, one of them at least, is to achieve a national database of genetic and medical data on every citizen and soldier from birth.

01:26:28.529 --> 01:26:34.532
At the same time, the old vaccine schedule will be acknowledged as flawed because it was a one size fits all system.

01:26:35.032 --> 01:26:39.634
The old FDA will be identified as no longer appropriate for regulating personal medicine.

01:26:40.074 --> 01:26:43.236
But in reality, it doesn't really matter because it's already neutralized.

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:49.374
And so the rest will be theater because they need our data from birth until death.

01:26:49.394 --> 01:26:51.716
So this isn't about us, it's about the grandchildren.

01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:59.903
This is about the grandchildren of earth accepting intramuscular injection as medicine, virology as a science and public health is both a reason and an answer.

01:27:01.004 --> 01:27:07.149
And the reason, this is the reason why Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan were so prominent in the narrative control space for five years.

01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:10.312
It's the only explanation for it.

01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:15.144
How's that?

01:27:17.226 --> 01:27:38.465
So we did look at some scripted bullshit yesterday and we looked at some in the beginning and I want to finish this with a little bit of looking at the scripted bullshit that we left off with just now with that Senate hearing but let's watch when we hand the mic to Senator Ron Johnson and Peter McCullough and some other guy who's sure it's amyloid.

01:27:44.434 --> 01:27:45.635
That should have been playing first.

01:27:45.675 --> 01:27:46.675
Oh, well, it's going to play now.

01:27:46.735 --> 01:27:51.157
Here are his experiences addressing both measles and COVID-19.

01:27:51.818 --> 01:28:01.503
He's not only a dedicated public service, but he's also a physician who led his experience, his state, Hawaii, during the pandemic.

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:04.064
And I'm thankful to him for

01:28:04.744 --> 01:28:09.788
being here today, and I look forward to the testimony.

01:28:10.188 --> 01:28:10.949
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:28:11.089 --> 01:28:12.831
Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:16.193
I think people understand why you didn't join me in my oversight request.

01:28:16.253 --> 01:28:19.176
There's over 70 letters that were not responded to.

01:28:19.196 --> 01:28:24.280
Again, I haven't uncovered yet what they were trying to hide, but our intention is to do so.

01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:26.261
You did mention the

01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:32.351
irrefutable fact that these vacs, these injections saved lives.

01:28:32.371 --> 01:28:41.938
I would enter into the record a recent study by Rafael Letaster, who does a pretty effective job of rebutting one of those studies from Watson et al.

01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:51.786
But put in the record and again, will allow the public, the American people who are watching this hearing decide based on what testimony is based on what's been entered in the record.

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.367
We will let the American public decide.

01:28:54.407 --> 01:28:57.630
We will give them all the evidence and let them decide this is the trap.

01:28:59.051 --> 01:29:02.873
If you're using social media to decide, you're not gonna make a decision on your own.

01:29:04.193 --> 01:29:07.514
As Sam Harris said, free will is an illusion.

01:29:07.735 --> 01:29:10.276
On social media, it sure as hell is.

01:29:11.936 --> 01:29:23.701
Free will with your wife, what you say to your wife, that's more in your control than the conscious questions that come to mind when you're freely using social media, nevermind skillfully using it.

01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:26.022
Make sure you understand that message clearly.

01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:27.832
We are in trouble.

01:29:28.172 --> 01:29:29.353
Record based on our report.

01:29:31.174 --> 01:29:36.258
It is the custom of this, the full committee and the subcommittee to swear in witnesses.

01:29:36.298 --> 01:29:38.080
So if you all rise and raise your right hand.

01:29:41.222 --> 01:29:41.883
Look at that.

01:29:41.923 --> 01:29:43.264
There's Aaron Seery.

01:29:43.284 --> 01:29:49.129
You swear that testimony you are about to give before the subcommittee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.

01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:51.991
That was funny.

01:29:57.119 --> 01:29:58.860
Our first witness is Dr. Peter McCulloch.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.761
Dr. McCulloch is an internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist from Dallas, Texas.

01:30:04.301 --> 01:30:08.763
He has broadly published with over 700 citations in the National Library of Medicine.

01:30:09.243 --> 01:30:10.943
He has testified multiple times in the U.S.

01:30:10.963 --> 01:30:11.543
Senate, U.S.

01:30:11.563 --> 01:30:15.785
House of Representatives, European Parliament, and many state capitals concerning public health policy.

01:30:16.125 --> 01:30:16.845
Dr. McCulloch.

01:30:20.154 --> 01:30:30.256
Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Blumenthal, subcommittee members, it's an honor to present my insights, my analysis, my clinical experience on this very important topic.

01:30:31.396 --> 01:30:46.879
The first time I testified at Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, before a word came out of my mouth, Minority Senator Gary Peters said, what America was about to hear was misinformation.

01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:49.792
I didn't even know what he was talking about.

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:58.700
I had never heard that term before in academic medicine or in important deliberations.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.501
That's November 19th, 2020.

01:31:02.703 --> 01:31:03.464
What was he doing?

01:31:04.605 --> 01:31:08.028
He was using an old communist propaganda technique.

01:31:10.566 --> 01:31:15.450
He was attempting to gain leverage over me before a word ever came out of my mouth.

01:31:16.391 --> 01:31:27.660
We should never have our public servants ever try to gain leverage over anyone who is coming to Washington to help the nation on an important issue.

01:31:28.701 --> 01:31:29.922
As introduced, I'm an internist.

01:31:29.942 --> 01:31:30.883
I'm a cardiologist.

01:31:31.183 --> 01:31:39.510
I believe I'm the most published individual who's ever testified on matters related to COVID-19 in any of these hearings.

01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:43.409
I've seen and examined more patients.

01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:45.690
I've examined more data.

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.851
And I'm one of the most published people on the topic in the world.

01:31:50.951 --> 01:32:03.154
And as a cardiologist, I can tell you, my role in this was to fight disease, preserve life, and above all, do no harm.

01:32:04.114 --> 01:32:04.714
Do no harm.

01:32:06.832 --> 01:32:10.476
I get the feeling that this is like the last time he's gonna do this.

01:32:11.236 --> 01:32:11.897
That he's done.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.142
And it's amazing how he's insisting that you have to believe him.

01:32:17.182 --> 01:32:23.769
It's a lot like trying to, how they set you up with, I'm not gonna say that, it's too dark.

01:32:25.150 --> 01:32:28.133
But I think they play this card a lot in a lot of different ways.

01:32:29.521 --> 01:32:45.671
They can do it with race and with racism because you don't understand because you're white But they can do it with a lot of other things too, you know Like because you don't have a disease or you don't have a situation then you don't get it And they do it with expertise.

01:32:45.771 --> 01:32:53.836
They do it with empathy and we have to reject this kind of reasoning wholeheartedly as independent thinking adults

01:32:54.178 --> 01:32:58.761
Now, the topic today is myocarditis or heart damage from the COVID-19 vaccines.

01:32:58.901 --> 01:32:59.802
I'm a cardiologist.

01:32:59.922 --> 01:33:00.902
I know the topic well.

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:04.305
I've examined thousands of patients with this problem, thousands.

01:33:04.665 --> 01:33:08.027
Before the pandemic, I had two patients ever with this problem.

01:33:09.148 --> 01:33:16.613
There's 1,065 papers in the peer-reviewed literature on COVID vaccine myocarditis.

01:33:17.353 --> 01:33:19.475
So let me summarize them for you.

01:33:20.492 --> 01:33:26.821
The first one that came on my radar screen that was alarming came from Washington University in St.

01:33:26.861 --> 01:33:28.764
Louis, August 18th of 2021.

01:33:28.864 --> 01:33:33.671
The first author is Verma and colleagues, New England Journal of Medicine.

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:40.655
A 42-year-old man comes into Washington University Hospital with vaccine myocarditis.

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.417
The infection's ruled out.

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:45.139
Why would we be at Washington, yeah, right?

01:33:45.179 --> 01:33:47.460
I mean, this is, I think there's a vaccine.

01:33:48.201 --> 01:33:49.181
He's in the hospital.

01:33:49.202 --> 01:33:51.083
This is one of our best hospitals in the United States.

01:33:51.663 --> 01:33:54.946
He dies three days after taking Moderna.

01:33:56.004 --> 01:33:57.584
They can't save him in the hospital.

01:33:57.744 --> 01:34:00.885
So, Dr. McCullough, move the microphone just a little bit away from you.

01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:02.866
Then one was reported.

01:34:02.906 --> 01:34:04.766
We're getting too many plosives.

01:34:05.066 --> 01:34:06.207
We're getting too many plosives.

01:34:06.227 --> 01:34:10.088
This is now a younger man, just a few days after Pfizer.

01:34:10.188 --> 01:34:11.168
He comes in the hospital.

01:34:11.568 --> 01:34:15.189
He dies within eight hours of being in the hospital.

01:34:16.365 --> 01:34:17.526
I can tell you I'm a cardiologist.

01:34:17.546 --> 01:34:19.008
That doesn't even happen with heart attacks.

01:34:19.208 --> 01:34:20.730
He dies within eight hours.

01:34:21.231 --> 01:34:25.576
I examined all of the slides and the images that the Koreans had showed us.

01:34:26.217 --> 01:34:29.300
It looked like somebody took a blow charge to that heart.

01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:32.484
It was so completely fried with inflammation.

01:34:32.524 --> 01:34:33.545
His heart was destroyed.

01:34:34.607 --> 01:34:35.428
These cases

01:34:36.482 --> 01:34:41.167
which were widely known at the time, should have gotten everyone's attention.

01:34:41.908 --> 01:34:44.490
Everyone should have been laser-focused on this.

01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:49.075
We should never have someone die after taking a vaccine.

01:34:49.235 --> 01:34:51.157
That's directly caused to the vaccine.

01:34:51.457 --> 01:34:57.924
Then Gill and colleagues, Connecticut, publishing archives of pathology, two boys, age 16 and 17,

01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:03.258
who die a few days after taking Pfizer.

01:35:03.739 --> 01:35:04.639
These are teenagers.

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.103
They're found dead at home by their parents.

01:35:09.563 --> 01:35:10.804
They're absolutely horrified.

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:16.623
They requested- So COVID shots are bad, don't talk about 2020, right?

01:35:16.743 --> 01:35:19.105
I just hope I'm being clear about what's happening here.

01:35:19.125 --> 01:35:19.926
An autopsy.

01:35:20.226 --> 01:35:25.231
They call in University of Michigan and University of Minnesota to look over what are they finding at autopsy.

01:35:25.571 --> 01:35:36.281
I've been saying that I think since 2023, that they are doing something weird because they're only talking about the COVID shots and they don't want to talk about 2020 anymore.

01:35:36.401 --> 01:35:37.482
They don't want to talk about 2021 anymore.

01:35:40.547 --> 01:35:42.289
and they are doing it still.

01:35:42.509 --> 01:35:44.752
It is remarkable.

01:35:59.562 --> 01:36:04.584
if they found their children dead after taking a COVID-19 vaccine.

01:36:04.804 --> 01:36:06.664
This is in the peer-reviewed literature.

01:36:06.905 --> 01:36:08.565
This is not misinformation.

01:36:08.665 --> 01:36:13.767
Now, shouldn't this make all of the moms that have lost a kid to SIDS?

01:36:15.618 --> 01:36:26.721
angry and all those moms should already be in the tent of CHD because CHD would have been telling them a long time ago that SIDS is probably just vaccines and you should speak out or we should look into it.

01:36:27.262 --> 01:36:28.202
But they never did.

01:36:28.882 --> 01:36:29.462
They don't.

01:36:30.383 --> 01:36:32.023
Until very, very recently.

01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:38.065
And then they're still doing it in such a ham-fisted, half-assed way that nothing, no progress is made.

01:36:40.987 --> 01:36:54.429
And so this guy is going to make you believe that it's the spike protein, that the transfection worked really well, but they chose this absolutely toxic spike protein that has a extremely toxic S1 subunit.

01:36:54.589 --> 01:36:55.830
I shit you not.

01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:00.130
Everyone should be paying attention to this.

01:37:00.751 --> 01:37:02.571
This is not conjecture.

01:37:02.891 --> 01:37:05.451
This is in the peer-reviewed literature.

01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:08.332
So we started to ask ourselves, what is going on?

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:16.264
Turns out that Pfizer and Moderna and Janssen are the genetic code for the spike protein.

01:37:16.644 --> 01:37:21.627
The spike protein is the damaging part of the virus.

01:37:22.207 --> 01:37:29.751
The spike protein is loaded into the body and it causes tremendous damage, tremendous damage in some.

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:35.914
Acute myocarditis appears to have some genetic predilection in all of the virus.

01:37:36.635 --> 01:37:43.294
genetic predilection holy stop lying wow stop lying

01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:48.151
Maybe it's racial.

01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:50.693
Files of the vaccine are not the same.

01:37:50.994 --> 01:37:59.301
But I can tell you, I'm concerned that until the vaccines are stopped, there will be cases of acute myocarditis.

01:37:59.742 --> 01:38:04.626
And to finish, we've had 216 vaccine deaths this year alone.

01:38:07.108 --> 01:38:16.041
So if the vaccine campaign continues, we have to look at what are we getting out of it now, four and a half years of the campaign, and how many more people will die.

01:38:16.441 --> 01:38:17.463
I'm Dr. Peter McCullough.

01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:18.324
Thank you for listening.

01:38:18.732 --> 01:38:19.592
Thank you, Dr. McCullough.

01:38:20.133 --> 01:38:21.834
Our next witness is Dr. Jordan Vaughn.

01:38:22.394 --> 01:38:26.496
Dr. Vaughn is a physician and clinical researcher in Birmingham, Alabama.

01:38:27.016 --> 01:38:36.361
As owner and CEO of MedHelp Clinics, Dr. Vaughn has directed his organization to the leading edge of early outpatient treatment of COVID-19 for his patients and greater Birmingham community.

01:38:36.761 --> 01:38:41.963
Dr. Vaughn has treated over 4,000 long COVID and COVID vaccine injured patients.

01:38:42.564 --> 01:38:43.064
Dr. Vaughn.

01:38:44.264 --> 01:38:46.986
Thank you, Chairman Johnson and

01:38:47.962 --> 01:38:50.123
Ranking Member Blumenthal, thank you for having me.

01:38:51.204 --> 01:38:54.346
I'm going to dovetail a little bit off what Dr. McCullough said.

01:38:54.366 --> 01:38:56.647
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:38:56.747 --> 01:38:58.568
Is this the guy that was on that?

01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:59.549
Oh my gosh.

01:38:59.589 --> 01:39:00.610
Wait, let's see where we are.

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:01.770
We're at eight minutes and 15 seconds.

01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:02.271
I got to go back.

01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:11.432
Holy shit.

01:39:11.833 --> 01:39:14.657
I didn't even realize that was happening right now, but it is, isn't it?

01:39:15.418 --> 01:39:16.660
Oh my gosh.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.563
Look at this, ladies and gentlemen.

01:39:19.264 --> 01:39:20.246
Look at this.

01:39:21.368 --> 01:39:22.409
Look at this.

01:39:23.391 --> 01:39:23.631
Okay.

01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:40.406
When this slide advances, I'm gonna just advance it without the transition, you will see up here that the second VRSF live on spike-induced brain injury was Kevin McCairn and this Jordan Vaughn guy.

01:39:40.426 --> 01:39:42.267
Holy shit!

01:39:43.187 --> 01:39:44.428
Can you see the admission?

01:39:45.458 --> 01:39:47.459
Can you see how easy it is to see?

01:39:47.559 --> 01:39:48.699
Are you from the UK?

01:39:48.779 --> 01:39:50.080
Are you from the Netherlands?

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.000
Are you from France?

01:39:51.461 --> 01:39:56.122
Are you from Russia or China or Australia or New Zealand?

01:39:56.182 --> 01:39:58.363
Because it's all should be visible to you.

01:39:58.463 --> 01:40:08.868
America has been subverted by people like Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and all of these organizations.

01:40:09.608 --> 01:40:13.089
They've co-opted Brian Hooker and Brian Hooker can't do anything about it.

01:40:13.489 --> 01:40:20.831
And all the way back here, all the way back here, you can see on Thursday, April 24th, they already told you they had it.

01:40:21.351 --> 01:40:24.652
They just didn't bring in Kevin McCairn because we blew him out of the water.

01:40:25.053 --> 01:40:26.813
Because he legitimizes me.

01:40:27.253 --> 01:40:36.196
His track record of five years of coming after me, calling me names, making thumbnails about me, and then showing up here with him.

01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:45.640
While this guy was on a podcast saying that Rixie's a hero, Rixie was in Japan with this guy for a year.

01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:48.263
Going to swimming pools with him.

01:40:49.685 --> 01:40:50.707
Living in his house.

01:40:53.436 --> 01:41:04.842
This is unbelievable that that guy is in front of Congress right now after having just been on a podcast with that foreign trader meddler.

01:41:05.742 --> 01:41:07.623
Wow, I can't believe it.

01:41:08.203 --> 01:41:09.464
I simply can't believe it.

01:41:09.504 --> 01:41:11.605
I didn't think that I was doing this.

01:41:13.646 --> 01:41:14.787
It just keeps happening.

01:41:14.847 --> 01:41:16.928
It's always just keeps happening.

01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:21.450
I gotta go advance it, right?

01:41:25.237 --> 01:41:25.517
to 815.

01:41:29.219 --> 01:41:33.141
People working for him and actually seeing about 170,000 patients a year.

01:41:33.661 --> 01:41:43.166
When COVID came along, I had to really figure out how to not only help my staff and make sure they're safe, but also help the patients that my organization was responsible for.

01:41:43.226 --> 01:41:47.148
And that really made me dive into understanding the pathology.

01:41:47.528 --> 01:41:49.709
And what I came away with was understanding

01:41:50.169 --> 01:41:54.733
that the spike protein, the S1 subunit specifically, is not a benign protein.

01:41:54.933 --> 01:42:03.260
It triggers inflammation, it disrupts endothelial barriers, it induces fibrin-resistant breakdown, and it promotes a lot of amyloid aggregates, which is what I research.

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:08.244
These effects impair oxygen delivery, damage blood vessels, contribute to clotting pathologies,

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:17.227
that manifest with a lot of the symptoms that we're seeing in the long COVID and vaccine injured, which to this day is a huge... He's a lot better than McCairn.

01:42:17.547 --> 01:42:18.467
That's for sure.

01:42:18.967 --> 01:42:22.929
If they had McCairn sitting here right now, it would all be over already.

01:42:23.769 --> 01:42:25.649
I mean, that's impressive.

01:42:25.689 --> 01:42:26.430
...amount of people.

01:42:26.490 --> 01:42:35.973
We're talking upwards of 10 to 15 million people in America that are being affected by the consequences of COVID in the long form or vaccine injury.

01:42:37.409 --> 01:42:41.936
Typical symptoms are things like heart racing, brain fog, shortness of breath, and post-exertional malaise.

01:42:42.297 --> 01:42:49.328
In my clinic, I actually use immunofluorescent microscopy to be able to actually see what's going on in the blood and look for these amyloid aggregates.

01:42:50.053 --> 01:42:52.155
Some as young as teenagers that are unable to stand.

01:42:52.195 --> 01:42:57.840
Others are previously active adults suffering small strokes without typical identifiable causes.

01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:59.561
These are not abstract theories.

01:42:59.581 --> 01:43:02.543
They are the lived realities of my patients in Alabama and beyond.

01:43:02.964 --> 01:43:07.768
The mRNA injection heralded as a solution introduced a novel mechanism.

01:43:08.459 --> 01:43:13.922
lipid nanoparticles delivering modified mRNA that instructs the cells to produce a stabilized spike protein.

01:43:14.302 --> 01:43:25.049
Unlike traditional vaccines, this approach resulted in uncontrolled production of the spike protein for an unknown duration and distributes it widely across organs, including the heart, brain and vasculature.

01:43:25.529 --> 01:43:34.234
Now, it's funny because we were already talking about this in 2021, when a guy by the name of Byron Bridle came out to say that this is what would happen.

01:43:35.235 --> 01:43:37.416
And instead of an immediate halt,

01:43:38.442 --> 01:43:47.851
of the rollout of Transfection, Robert Malone went public with Steve Kirsch on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

01:43:48.851 --> 01:43:56.438
And essentially took all of the attention away from this guy who was burning his career in Canada.

01:43:56.799 --> 01:44:02.624
And Canada, in fact, put him off of camera because they went very hard after his career.

01:44:04.031 --> 01:44:14.818
And only when it was time did they get Byron Bridle on a few streams with Robert Malone or a few streams with Kevin McKernan and say, yeah, you're a hero, man.

01:44:15.379 --> 01:44:17.840
But who do they have in front of us telling us now?

01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:20.782
It's not Byron Bridle, the hero.

01:44:21.263 --> 01:44:24.305
It's not even Robert Malone, the guy who stepped in front of him in June of 2021.

01:44:24.465 --> 01:44:27.487
It's this guy, Amyloidosis.

01:44:28.513 --> 01:44:46.236
when the only people who were saying amyloidosis in 2020 were Kevin McCairn and Richard Fleming and a guy by the name of Walter Chestnut and Jessica Rose.

01:44:48.911 --> 01:44:59.022
I mean, and ovaries and test script is exposed EMA, their assessment of community, which is Pfizer's vaccine noted biodistribution beyond the injection site.

01:44:59.082 --> 01:45:02.305
He didn't even say core manatee, right?

01:45:04.127 --> 01:45:07.070
This is a joke, right?

01:45:07.461 --> 01:45:10.563
contradicting claims that the vaccine stays in the arm.

01:45:10.923 --> 01:45:32.614
And a recent groundbreaking study using single-cell precision nanocarrier identification revealed LNP accumulation in the heart tissue of mice with adverse proteomic changes in immune and vascular proteins, raising concerns about the cardiac complications that dovetail with what we were seeing when we were looking at the COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis.

01:45:32.654 --> 01:45:34.335
Is he seriously gonna just read?

01:45:36.601 --> 01:45:41.043
just like Callie Means did or Casey, whatever the hell her name is.

01:45:41.183 --> 01:45:42.484
Like this is a joke.

01:45:43.585 --> 01:45:50.568
They are so deep in their bench right now that they are reading scripts and this guy will not do it anymore.

01:45:51.589 --> 01:45:55.190
What you saw there was Peter McCullough saying, dudes, I'm done with this shit.

01:45:58.392 --> 01:45:59.853
Now they're stepping in other people.

01:46:01.334 --> 01:46:04.597
I will tell you my first encounter with a vaccine injury came in winter of 2021.

01:46:05.397 --> 01:46:10.321
A 69-year-old man from Alabama presented with unexplained shortness of breath.

01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:11.382
He was a patient of mine.

01:46:11.402 --> 01:46:13.863
He really had no other reason that he had this shortness of breath.

01:46:14.124 --> 01:46:19.007
And after the second Pfizer dose, he actually had significant shortness of breath.

01:46:19.207 --> 01:46:23.610
I couldn't figure it out in a sense because it would typically be that he had a pulmonary embolism.

01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:27.153
But empirical anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy brought rapid improvement.

01:46:27.537 --> 01:46:37.684
This case prompted deeper investigation that the spike protein's ability to induce fibrin that's resistant to breakdown, activate platelets irreversibly, and damage the inside of our vessels.

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:40.406
It's not the spike protein, it's transfection.

01:46:41.707 --> 01:46:56.057
You can look in the primary literature of PubMed, the website of NIH, and you can find papers where one of the early proposed uses of lipid nanoparticles was to transfect platelets because that's where they tended to go.

01:46:58.894 --> 01:47:01.876
Just like liver was also another place where they tended to go.

01:47:01.956 --> 01:47:04.198
So they thought, why not use it in Jesse Gelsinger?

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.222
Even if some go systemic, it'll come right back to the liver anyway.

01:47:09.262 --> 01:47:10.423
That's where they mostly go.

01:47:10.503 --> 01:47:12.824
So if we inject it into the liver, for sure it'll work.

01:47:17.248 --> 01:47:20.390
Ladies and gentlemen, we're standing like this far away from the brick wall.

01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:23.092
All we got to do is open our eyes and see the bricks.

01:47:24.933 --> 01:47:28.116
All we got to do is open our eyes and see that there's nobody left on the bench.

01:47:29.278 --> 01:47:33.179
The people that have been on the floor for the last five years are tired.

01:47:34.899 --> 01:47:38.580
And they can't do a full court press anymore, especially not with these half-asses.

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:40.980
So we have them on the ropes.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.441
We have to keep the pressure steady.

01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:49.962
And that's what I think our job has to be now, is to keep up the steady pressure.

01:47:50.882 --> 01:47:56.063
And I think that the other guys who are doing that are Mark Kulak and Joe Marshall of

01:47:56.863 --> 01:48:02.365
the Liberty perspective, I will confess that I don't always get to watch everything that he sends me.

01:48:03.485 --> 01:48:08.126
And when I do watch Joe, I always watch it at 2x, but I watch a lot of things at 2x.

01:48:08.186 --> 01:48:09.767
It's not an insult, that's time-saving.

01:48:10.607 --> 01:48:16.929
So I think Joe does a lot of really great work, and he does a lot of work that I can't do because he's read a lot of things that I haven't read.

01:48:17.789 --> 01:48:22.014
Just like Mark Kulak finds and archives things that otherwise I would have never read.

01:48:22.775 --> 01:48:24.998
So thanks to those guys for staying in the fight.

01:48:25.879 --> 01:48:32.005
Ladies and gentlemen, realize that the way that this bamboozlement is being happened is that we inherited a

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:37.910
a bad biology from our parents and from our high school and college biology teachers.

01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:47.997
And I think that we can come up with a high school curriculum that will teach a new biology that will make this exactly as ridiculous as it is, evolution because DNA.

01:48:48.017 --> 01:48:49.398
We have to dispel that illusion.

01:48:49.938 --> 01:48:59.201
We have to dispel the illusion of endemicity and explain that that is also a mythology upon which this pandemic myth rests.

01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:05.443
And that's also why the anti-vax movement is fake in America, because they have to sustain that myth.

01:49:05.823 --> 01:49:06.943
But we can seek the truth.

01:49:06.983 --> 01:49:09.924
You can see it because they only talk about the COVID shots being bad.

01:49:10.304 --> 01:49:19.407
They don't talk about 2020 because they want you to never realize that there was an infinitesimally, irreducibly complex background of genetic signals

01:49:20.027 --> 01:49:24.992
on the background of which any of these PCR tests could be used as a diagnostic.

01:49:25.613 --> 01:49:29.597
And the way they got away with transfection is they just put out a bunch of placebos.

01:49:29.617 --> 01:49:36.424
They've probably been doing that for years already to the very, very happy companies that can do it.

01:49:36.444 --> 01:49:37.345
You know, mostly Merck.

01:49:38.966 --> 01:49:42.229
Using their tests to find their ghost doesn't make you a ghostbuster.

01:49:42.249 --> 01:49:43.570
It doesn't make their ghosts real.

01:49:44.051 --> 01:49:45.612
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being here.

01:49:45.692 --> 01:49:46.553
Thanks for sharing.

01:49:47.053 --> 01:49:48.634
And if you can, thanks for supporting.

01:49:49.095 --> 01:49:50.656
If you ever supported, thank you.

01:49:51.096 --> 01:49:52.858
If you can't support anymore, thank you.

01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:55.720
And if you're thinking about supporting, thank you very much.

01:49:56.401 --> 01:49:57.282
See you guys again soon.

01:50:02.543 --> 01:50:11.019
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and wreak a bitch-like disease.
