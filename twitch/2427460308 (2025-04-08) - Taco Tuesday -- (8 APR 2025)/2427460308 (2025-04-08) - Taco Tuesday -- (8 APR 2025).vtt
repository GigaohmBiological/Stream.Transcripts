WEBVTT

01:05.064 --> 01:05.904
you you

01:47.899 --> 01:50.461
Neptune, eighth planet from the sun.

01:51.021 --> 01:51.901
A mystery now.

01:52.322 --> 01:55.463
We hope to have close-up photos from Voyager 2 in 1989.

01:55.944 --> 01:59.106
We do have them!

01:59.226 --> 02:00.526
They're my home screen.

02:00.887 --> 02:10.912
Miss Hoover, once again, the lesson plan I prepared would have covered this topic much better, but I can see... Miss Hoover?

02:11.773 --> 02:12.874
It's Tuesday, Lisa.

02:13.114 --> 02:14.254
Taco Tuesday.

02:14.795 --> 02:14.895
Oh!

02:26.795 --> 02:28.536
It's real Full speed Kevin

03:19.855 --> 03:20.595
And I have lied.

03:20.755 --> 03:21.616
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:21.636 --> 03:22.576
I don't want to lie.

03:23.076 --> 03:24.417
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:24.517 --> 03:25.557
I try not to be a liar.

03:25.577 --> 03:26.437
I don't want to be a liar.

03:26.997 --> 03:29.758
I think it's like, really important not to be a liar.

03:31.999 --> 03:37.161
Specialization should make you suspicious, because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on.

03:37.641 --> 03:40.722
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

03:41.162 --> 03:43.123
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

03:43.143 --> 03:46.264
And that's, that's, that's sort of my starting my starting bias.

04:03.234 --> 04:14.958
Still it's their appointed duty They keep trying to tell me All you want to do is use me But my answer They know all that use me stuff

04:36.740 --> 04:44.249
i wanna spread the news that if it feels it's good getting used oh you just keep on using me

05:05.994 --> 05:18.561
Sit me right down and he'd talk to me And he told me That I ought not to let you just walk on me And I'm sure he meant well Yeah, but when our talk was through

05:37.657 --> 05:44.063
Hey, I said, brother, if you only knew, you'd wish that you were in my shoes.

05:44.083 --> 05:51.309
You'd just keep on using me until you use me up.

05:51.409 --> 05:53.071
Until you use me up.

06:20.996 --> 06:27.859
And then you act real rude to me.

06:27.899 --> 06:35.843
But oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me, I can't get enough.

06:35.883 --> 06:48.550
And I want to spread the news that if it feels it's good getting used, oh, you just keep on using me.

06:51.877 --> 06:53.819
Until you use me up.

06:54.019 --> 06:55.100
Until you use me up.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.842
Talking about you, I'm a little fevered.

06:57.102 --> 06:59.384
It all depends on what you do.

06:59.484 --> 07:05.710
It ain't too bad the way you lead me, cause I sure am you then you.

07:22.079 --> 07:23.641
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

07:23.681 --> 07:24.642
Good to see everybody.

07:25.142 --> 07:27.144
It's really a pleasure to be here this morning.

07:27.165 --> 07:28.266
I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.

07:28.306 --> 07:35.654
We have a lot of things going on in the background, and sometimes I just can't make that 10-10 thing that I really like to make.

07:37.035 --> 07:39.137
But I missed it today, so I apologize for that.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.399
Thank you very much for being here.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.841
We're going to keep going with this little slide deck here.

07:45.482 --> 07:57.816
I'm very excited to be here, as I said, because I think at this stage they're really left with very little options other than to stay spectacularly committed to this lie that includes testing.

07:57.836 --> 08:01.120
I'm a clinical pathology subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.362
I do molecular biology.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.025
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

08:05.405 --> 08:14.351
And they're just going to stay committed to this idea that these molecular tests mean something and that they're picking up something novel, a new phenomenon.

08:15.472 --> 08:21.035
And this commitment is so spectacular because these people are on stage together.

08:21.095 --> 08:22.957
That's why you can't change their script.

08:23.817 --> 08:28.439
Kevin McKernan belongs down here on this diagram.

08:28.479 --> 08:32.681
He does not belong on the diagram with these people.

08:32.741 --> 08:47.708
In reality, he is one of the links between the mainstream media, you know, theater and that theater that is present on X, on Twitter, on Telegram, and on all these other platforms where these people have been performing there.

08:48.268 --> 09:02.660
their act for the last five years and it could be different ladies and gentlemen if we can see that they are on stage together and that's why you can't change their script you just kind of argue with them and they incorporate your arguments and move on

09:03.683 --> 09:07.105
And that's because there is a spectacular commitment to this lie.

09:07.606 --> 09:15.611
They have created this illusion of consensus together, the Brownstone Institute to the heart, to the international COVID summits.

09:15.691 --> 09:19.193
It's all one big show on one big stage.

09:19.713 --> 09:27.358
And when you start to understand that your consciousness has been their prime real estate for years and years, this will all make a lot more sense.

09:28.138 --> 09:30.280
And GigaOM will start to provide hope.

09:32.537 --> 09:39.287
Because hope is really to be found in biology, in the truth, in our history, that's still available on the internet.

09:39.327 --> 09:43.594
And there's almost no way they can avoid this now because the truth is starting to spread.

09:44.174 --> 09:45.797
The biology is starting to spread.

09:45.837 --> 09:46.979
Biology 101, after just one week,

09:48.601 --> 09:51.463
has already changed some people's minds about things.

09:51.823 --> 10:01.708
I've never gotten a response to any of my shows like I've gotten to the response to the first two Gigaohm Biological New Biology 101 from last week.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.909
So I'm very, very happy with that result.

10:04.889 --> 10:07.491
Let me just see what slide we're on here.

10:07.511 --> 10:09.592
Oh yeah, that's right.

10:18.723 --> 10:19.604
I wonder if this will work.

10:19.684 --> 10:22.466
I feel like it's overloading there a little bit.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.908
Oh, I didn't close that green screen.

10:24.928 --> 10:28.171
I have to fix that problem.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.675
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

10:32.755 --> 10:35.297
The voice that you hear in the echoing background

10:36.096 --> 10:37.278
Is Jonathan Cooey.

10:37.298 --> 10:41.662
I am the one man show called Giga Home Biological.

10:41.722 --> 10:46.147
And so if somebody needs to reset a green screen curtain, it is me.

10:46.167 --> 10:50.332
I don't even have a 12 year old kid son back here helping me.

10:51.264 --> 10:58.107
He's busy doing exercises and practicing with his basketball and doing his homework and this kind of thing.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.968
Helping his mom with chores around the house.

11:01.048 --> 11:07.791
Ladies and gentlemen, again, this is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

11:09.152 --> 11:13.794
If you want to get on the mailing list, we're going to start with that, I swear, very, very soon.

11:14.894 --> 11:21.798
I just keep not having my act together in the morning early enough to give Fela the go-ahead to give the email out.

11:22.899 --> 11:32.325
But I'm going to try very hard to do that tomorrow and Thursday for Biology 101 classes and then Friday we'll see what we go on there.

11:33.907 --> 11:52.726
um if you want to share the stream please share this link here stream.gigaom.bio i know that you can't download right now i'm i'm working on fixing that we're working on fixing that we're hoping that that update will come soon um i'm not very happy with it but on the other hand it keeps people focused on the big big um shows and and

11:53.587 --> 11:55.289
And you know, Jeff gets a little bit of a break.

11:55.329 --> 11:58.652
Jeff from Earth in the chat is the guy who's doing those clips for me.

11:59.673 --> 12:01.955
Anyway, you can see the truth has been here for a while.

12:02.015 --> 12:02.855
It's April 8th, 2025.

12:03.336 --> 12:14.566
And yeah, it is the high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of his garage with a decent green screen setup.

12:16.067 --> 12:18.109
It is taco Tuesday's one of these things.

12:18.169 --> 12:30.940
It's not for everybody, you know, not everybody's gonna break in the back door of the school to to eat tacos and there's a lot of jokes writing here for me because we used to call the the the

12:32.842 --> 12:41.954
This is going to be very bad, but we used to call the cadavers of the mice and rats that we would have in the freezers after using these experimental animals.

12:42.014 --> 12:49.464
I used to call that, and it used to drive people nuts, the taco meat, and that people had to regularly make sure that we were

12:50.194 --> 13:06.447
cleaning out the taco meat and uh anyway so taco tuesday has something to do with that for me too in the sense of do you really know what's in your taco and so it kind of gives me this funny way of you know saying i can do whatever i want today on taco tuesday and you just have to

13:07.313 --> 13:09.634
eat the taco not knowing really what the meat's gonna be.

13:10.574 --> 13:14.375
But basically, it's the same taco all the time on this show.

13:14.475 --> 13:22.297
Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, I'm always trying to give you the truth, which is that they are playing for all the marbles on a multi generational timescale.

13:22.317 --> 13:23.918
This is about the grandchildren of earth.

13:23.958 --> 13:27.819
And that's exactly why there is a spectacularly public

13:28.519 --> 13:36.462
fake anti-vaccine movement in America that reaches mainstream media on a regular basis with the face of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:36.522 --> 13:45.325
and a few other key meddlers, or puppets, or players, or actors, or people on the stage.

13:45.465 --> 13:46.806
I don't know what to call them.

13:47.486 --> 14:01.680
But we are governed by a theater where there is some truth and there is a lot of stuff behind the scenes that people are shown as they need to be shown or are shown as a way of, you know, feeling like they're special.

14:02.261 --> 14:10.049
But in the end, we are governed by people that are wittingly and unwittingly participating in this theater, which is almost exclusively false.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.040
A lot of this stuff with tariffs right now is just a theater.

14:14.100 --> 14:21.784
It's a lot of smoke and mirrors and, you know, let's get all riled up in front of Congress just the same way as gain of function was in 2020.

14:22.824 --> 14:24.625
And the lab leak was in 2020.

14:25.006 --> 14:33.470
We are being manipulated into responding to day by day, hour by hour, media stories that mean nothing.

14:33.530 --> 14:37.773
None of these things can change on a timescale of hours.

14:38.959 --> 14:42.861
And so at best, what we're dealing with here is an elaborate theater.

14:43.141 --> 14:51.606
At worst, we're dealing with a rather amateur theater at this point because the script has been so destroyed by the lack of compliance.

14:53.651 --> 14:59.613
The bottom line is, is that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and lies.

14:59.673 --> 15:02.354
And some of those are listed here, but it's definitely not all of them.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.374
But there are a few things that no one will talk about.

15:05.574 --> 15:17.978
So I thought I'd keep plugging those all the time and keep making sure that people understand that you gotta hold somebody to extremely high standards if you're gonna say that somebody

15:18.618 --> 15:34.587
who is responsible for, and who has done, and who has appointed, and who has been, and who has said all the things that our current president has said, we're gonna have to require more than that for us to still blindly believe that this guy is the guy on the white horse.

15:34.627 --> 15:41.851
I mean, it is absurd where we are right now with Tulsi Gabbard and these other people in the administration.

15:41.951 --> 15:43.552
It is absurd right now.

15:44.451 --> 15:46.672
And so it is a message of hope.

15:46.832 --> 15:55.837
It is a message for anyone, but not necessarily for everyone, because there are still people on both sides of the equation who are not ready to accept that they are both fooled.

15:56.513 --> 15:59.934
There's people on the left who definitely don't want to hear anything about it.

15:59.974 --> 16:07.517
There's definitely people on the right who don't want to hear anything about it, because the Q movement is still coming, and John F. Kennedy Jr.

16:07.557 --> 16:11.758
is still alive, or whatever other things are just ready to break out.

16:11.798 --> 16:14.139
You know, the Space Force is going to take over, I guess.

16:14.239 --> 16:14.599
I don't know.

16:15.479 --> 16:28.626
I really don't know, except I do know that there is a biological truth or two that we have been stating for quite some years now that no one is challenging, and that is that this illusion requires your participation to sustain.

16:29.246 --> 16:35.409
That is that transfection in healthy people, oh, in health people, in healthy people,

16:37.406 --> 16:39.729
Wow, that's interesting that I never caught that before.

16:41.852 --> 16:42.993
Interesting, indeed.

16:43.013 --> 16:44.054
There we go.

16:45.296 --> 16:48.780
In healthy people is a crime and RNA cannot pandemic.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.602
That's that's the reality of it here.

16:51.023 --> 16:56.109
We have been pretty succinctly saying this intramuscular injection is of course dumb as that.

16:56.730 --> 17:01.291
the most succinct thing that we've managed to say here at Gigaohm Biological.

17:01.331 --> 17:09.213
And if you feel not so comfortable with saying intramuscular injection is dumb, you can add a few more words to it and then it's like bulletproof.

17:10.294 --> 17:16.355
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

17:16.916 --> 17:25.398
That statement has been absolutely ignored by every single human being on the planet that doesn't already follow Gigaohm Biological.

17:26.658 --> 17:36.927
It is remarkable how easy it would be for anybody like Sam and Mark Bailey or Andrew Kaufman or Tom Cowan or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:36.947 --> 17:44.494
or Mary Holland or Brian Hooker or any of these people who know that I've been saying this for a couple, three years now, more or less,

17:46.360 --> 17:49.102
could have just taken the idea and run with it.

17:49.442 --> 17:55.226
Even if they think I'm a creep or that I attack people too much or that I'm too negative, they could take this idea and run with it.

17:55.626 --> 18:04.452
They could take the idea that transfection was a word, a term that meant exactly what the COVID vaccines are.

18:05.012 --> 18:13.438
And instead of using slave speak and calling them COVID vaccines, they could have demanded them be called transfection from the very beginning.

18:13.478 --> 18:14.639
But these same people,

18:15.706 --> 18:25.451
also failed and dropped that ball as well, even though they paid me for a year and a half, and I begged them to say it for a year and a half, eventually it resulted in my firing.

18:27.652 --> 18:31.655
RNA cannot pandemic is something that they just simply cannot discuss.

18:32.503 --> 18:34.584
They can't even address these three words.

18:35.184 --> 18:35.904
No one can.

18:36.004 --> 18:44.267
Nick Hudson can't say these three words, just like Nick Hudson can't say intramuscular injection is dumb without admitting that he learned it from me.

18:44.727 --> 18:46.147
Because no one else has said it.

18:46.587 --> 18:54.470
These people with these books, all these anti-vax books with hundreds of pages in them, none of those books say it.

18:56.437 --> 19:01.601
Imagine starting a book with a basic set of statements like this.

19:01.781 --> 19:06.104
Imagine starting a book where you just said the main idea.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.486
But none of these books do that.

19:08.546 --> 19:09.967
None of these podcasts do that.

19:10.027 --> 19:11.488
None of these organizations do that.

19:11.528 --> 19:13.129
None of these conferences do that.

19:13.590 --> 19:23.457
None of these people have managed to do it in the 15 to 20 years that they purport to have been fighting the vaccine schedule as anti-vaxxers.

19:24.730 --> 19:29.154
I've come to figure out that I'm one of the only real anti-vaxxers that I know of.

19:30.555 --> 19:34.959
Everybody else is just pretending to say something other than this.

19:36.052 --> 19:40.216
The US vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

19:40.276 --> 19:53.927
And in fact, the concept of vaccination is a biologically incongruent idea because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

19:54.428 --> 19:56.289
That's what Taco Tuesday is all about.

19:56.349 --> 20:03.716
How many different ways could we possibly say those words to make more and more people learn the basic biology

20:04.983 --> 20:23.884
so that they can identify these people who should have known better, did know better in fact, because they worked for the Human Genome Project, or sold the company to Pfizer, or have been advising DITRA and the DoD for the last 20 years, or were originally an activist on the anthrax vaccine in coordination with one of those operators.

20:24.344 --> 20:35.589
or was on stage with all of those operators in 2023, or maybe even just, for example, was a genetic expert in modifying and expressing proteins in plants.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.471
It's for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.732
It's for the grandchildren of earth.

20:42.772 --> 20:50.035
That's why it's so unbelievably comprehensive, this coverage of people on the internet.

20:50.075 --> 20:50.655
It's cheap.

20:51.536 --> 20:56.280
It's for all the grandchildren of Earth and that's why there's a fake anti-vaxx movement in America.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.521
Make no mistake about what I'm trying to say.

20:59.102 --> 21:07.488
The anti-vaxxers that are fake are traitors to our grandchildren and they have not made any progress in this fight in decades.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.771
That is the evidence of them being traitors.

21:11.851 --> 21:13.873
They've never gone all in.

21:14.918 --> 21:22.444
And going all in would be what I'm suggesting, the criminal enterprise, the lack of biological congruence, the bad ideas.

21:22.504 --> 21:23.425
They can't say it.

21:23.485 --> 21:26.647
They haven't been able to say it and they keep not saying it.

21:28.408 --> 21:35.894
And it's time we hold these people to account and we admit that this is happening because our country right now is being fractured.

21:36.595 --> 21:41.759
And one of the main wedges that's being driven between our fellow citizens

21:42.907 --> 21:46.350
is this wedge that you're either an anti-vaxxer or you're not.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.192
You either like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:48.212 --> 21:49.453
and Mary Holland or you don't.

21:49.473 --> 21:51.575
You either know who Brian Hooker is or you don't.

21:52.015 --> 21:59.061
And that is, that is a militarized fake anti-vaxx movement.

22:00.662 --> 22:02.824
And I'm going to go to my grave knowing it's true.

22:04.726 --> 22:05.146
Because in 2020,

22:06.598 --> 22:16.102
their track record shows it, and their track record to 2021 shows it, their track record to 2022 shows it, their track record all the way to 2025 shows it.

22:16.142 --> 22:32.868
In fact, if you go all the way back and compare their track record to someone like Brandy Vaughn, who after about a year of investigating the vaccine schedule in America, having naively brought an unvaccinated child to the United States back from Holland,

22:34.090 --> 22:45.134
came to the conclusion that this was the best way to teach it to people, that there's a huge difference between injection and ingestion, and that injection is no way to administer medicine.

22:45.495 --> 22:48.116
And this was a mom with an unvaccinated child.

22:48.576 --> 22:53.418
She was dead in the 7th of December, 2020, and that's her story.

22:54.278 --> 23:03.622
The same idea was, of course, available to Brian Hooker because Brian Hooker, in 2013, already had an injured son and was already being interviewed about it.

23:04.864 --> 23:10.311
and was already saying that he had several vaccines coincident with an ear infection and that's just wrong.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.134
He should never do that.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.758
And then he had questions about vaccination in general.

23:15.859 --> 23:20.465
He said he would never use the word autism because these are just neurologically injured children.

23:21.065 --> 23:24.968
And he has 16 years of experience in genetically modifying plants.

23:25.428 --> 23:37.036
So the funny thing is, is after this guy meets Brandy Vaughn and makes a couple videos with her at the beginning of 2020, he's not saying that intramuscular injection is a terrible way to augment the immune system.

23:37.076 --> 23:47.103
He's saying that COVID spreads asymptomatically and the PCR testing works, that antibodies aren't a great model for immunity, that natural immunity is real, that the vaccine studies are underpowered, but they're,

23:47.523 --> 23:52.467
at least they're vaccines, and knows what transfection is, but says nothing.

23:56.171 --> 24:00.054
And makes no mention of Brandy's death two weeks after she died.

24:01.636 --> 24:10.804
Instead is doing a callback routine with another doctor in the same Zoom meeting about antibodies and B-cells and ah, really funny.

24:13.286 --> 24:26.739
And of course, five years later, he's in front of the Senate as part of this fake anti-vaccine movement, this free health freedom movement that opposes mandates and advocates for free speech and free choice and safe vaccines.

24:30.959 --> 24:43.107
We're in big trouble in America because these murders and these lies are being committed and told for the Human Genome Project, which requires our grandchildren to be experimental animals.

24:43.147 --> 24:50.992
There is only one chance for them to acquire the data of a population of this size and this diversity.

24:52.754 --> 24:56.316
In another hundred years, all the people on this planet will be dead.

24:58.504 --> 25:06.768
And the population that replaces them will be a fraction of the size of the population that exists now, and more importantly, will be a fraction of the diversity.

25:08.168 --> 25:18.773
And so literally, this data is only actually, this data is only available this one time in history, this one window.

25:23.564 --> 25:32.250
and their God is an AI, their God is an imaginary computer, their God is something that was conceived first really in Joshua Lederberg's imagination.

25:32.330 --> 25:50.602
Before they ever had these neuronal networks, machine learning algorithms going as well as they're going now, Joshua Lederberg already anticipated this, this idea of being able to just test all the possibilities, turn all the numbers to crack a code because there's a limited number of combinations.

25:50.642 --> 25:51.443
He saw that.

25:52.984 --> 26:00.053
And it makes sense if you believe that the genetic code is the genetic code which codes for everything, but they haven't proven that yet.

26:03.317 --> 26:05.520
And that's why these people were put in place.

26:07.362 --> 26:11.908
Anthrax Merrill, you know, Anthrax Malone, and Ebola Malone.

26:12.421 --> 26:19.984
the broker who brokered the Ebola vaccine to Merck, the company that owns most of the childhood vaccine schedule.

26:20.444 --> 26:23.825
Merck, the company that none of these people mentioned.

26:24.005 --> 26:29.468
Merck, the company that just had the patent expire on ivermectin before the pandemic started.

26:31.248 --> 26:40.832
This geneticist and virologist, this geneticist and pathologist, that geneticist, that virologist, that fake

26:42.571 --> 26:44.192
Glyphosate biologist.

26:47.293 --> 26:50.414
Plus a bunch of people who are just in it for the money and fame, I guess.

26:50.474 --> 26:56.996
I don't know who these clowns are, but most of them are just awful because they can't not understand anymore.

26:57.897 --> 27:03.379
They can't read these slides and go, wow, I mean, I think somebody should start saying what Jonathan's saying.

27:03.399 --> 27:04.179
They don't do that.

27:05.407 --> 27:27.143
These organizations that I've all presented to multiple times or even been paid by, they all don't do it either because they are all there to curate a narrative to make sure that transfection and its effects gets blamed on a spike protein instead of transfection, the methodology itself, and the fundamental flaws that are in it.

27:31.681 --> 27:38.613
Everyone likes to talk about the climate crisis, but we are actually in a biodiversity crisis, and that's absolutely critical to our way of life.

27:38.673 --> 27:43.581
So if all of these species go extinct, then we'll have full ecosystem collapse.

27:45.265 --> 27:51.087
Some scientists have estimated that by 2050, half of all species that are alive today will be extinct.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.208
The truth is that extinction happens.

27:53.408 --> 27:56.209
Extinctions have happened throughout evolutionary history.

27:56.749 --> 28:05.572
But right now, the rate of extinction is estimated to be 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than the base rate in the fossil record.

28:05.752 --> 28:12.374
Have you ever thought about the possibility that they might also be trying to sample all the biodiversity before it goes away?

28:13.632 --> 28:29.135
Have you ever thought about that impetus as being real as well for the exact same reason that they want to take advantage of the couple generation window here where there's going to be more than 8 billion people on the planet and sample as much of that data as possible before it's lost forever?

28:30.636 --> 28:33.837
It sounds like a very similar motivation, doesn't it?

28:36.697 --> 28:38.498
And a lot of that is our fault.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.158
We need a solution.

28:47.512 --> 29:08.183
Colossal is the world's first de-extinction company, and we... De-extinction company is already a mythology, an illusion that they are casting on you right now, because what they're gonna suggest to you is, is they find DNA in a fossil, and they're gonna make it alive again, you know, by just, I guess, squirting it in the right place.

29:09.063 --> 29:09.943
That's not what they did.

29:10.124 --> 29:14.666
Combine de-extinction with species preservation, and our goal is to make extinction a thing of the past.

29:15.319 --> 29:15.819
Colossal.

29:15.879 --> 29:16.520
Colossal.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.081
Colossal biosciences.

29:18.121 --> 29:21.264
Develops cutting edge technology to protect biodiversity.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.485
But look at what they're admitting.

29:23.746 --> 29:40.040
They're also admitting, they're showing you as if that's a selling point that he's been on so many podcasts, so many of these influencers, so many of these jackasses that we've identified as part of this narrative network, this control grid of an illusion of consensus.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.722
They're just showing it to you right there.

29:46.870 --> 29:54.480
People think it's a colossal colossal colossal biosciences develops cutting-edge technology to protect biodiversity and reverse

29:56.621 --> 29:58.622
People think it's a scary word, de-extinction.

29:58.703 --> 30:02.085
They immediately put us with Jurassic Park, and it's not.

30:02.725 --> 30:10.571
We're trying to develop these new techniques in order to save animals, in order to bring back animals that, in some cases, were our fault, that we don't have them anymore.

30:11.511 --> 30:23.640
Oh, so Jurassic Park was totally gay because they were bringing back animals that went naturally extinct millions of years ago, but now we're gonna bring back animals that we made extinct because of

30:23.680 --> 30:24.503
It's our fault.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.750
We're going to try and fix what we did wrong.

30:29.945 --> 30:32.507
Oh my, oh my goodness.

30:32.688 --> 30:37.592
Oh, don't you just want to buy a t-shirt and get on board for this really good idea?

30:37.612 --> 30:41.495
It wasn't a climate problem.

30:41.515 --> 30:43.116
It was a human problem.

30:43.136 --> 30:53.404
I think we all share the deep concern about what's happening to biodiversity, what's happening to the planet, what's happening to people whose lives have been intertwined with wild nature.

30:53.865 --> 30:55.566
That was not a real Indian.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.284
This is fantastic.

31:00.345 --> 31:01.967
Wow, I didn't know it was going to be this funny.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.290
Before time began.

31:03.931 --> 31:07.698
And so coming together is so exciting because I think that's how we can really drive change.

31:09.457 --> 31:13.359
We're finding solutions to restore a species back to the wild.

31:13.399 --> 31:16.221
The purpose of that is to serve an ecological function.

31:16.901 --> 31:22.284
As we lose species within an ecosystem, if you think of a Jenga puzzle, you're sort of pulling blocks out of there.

31:22.564 --> 31:27.327
Those blocks that are creating the instability in the ecosystem is literally the function that animal plays.

31:27.927 --> 31:35.491
If we can find ways to restore animals that provide that specific function, we can create more stability within an ecosystem.

31:37.887 --> 31:54.762
And so rather than working on an existing population like cheetahs and try to save that genetic diversity and improve it with breeding and conservation programs, these yo-yos are pretending to circumvent that problem.

31:54.802 --> 31:59.286
Now we can let them go extinct and we'll just store them in a database and make some more if we need some more.

31:59.827 --> 32:03.490
And if that forest runs out over there, we'll just put some more back.

32:04.671 --> 32:14.750
It is so absurd, it's so obnoxious, but remember, this is part of that subconscious slippery slope that your kids and you are on together.

32:15.848 --> 32:21.131
And so what we're trying to do is wake up together with our kids so that we see it together with them.

32:21.551 --> 32:26.153
It has to be a multi-generational awakening or our grandchildren won't be saved.

32:26.193 --> 32:44.782
If we wake up as grandparents before our grandchildren are born, but our kids are still engaged in this world, in this nonsense, and we have to argue with our kids about this years from now, after they've already absorbed this already for five years, and now for a few more years,

32:45.422 --> 32:47.163
We need to pull them out now.

32:47.703 --> 32:49.304
We need to get together with them now.

32:49.344 --> 32:51.825
We need to absorb these stories together now.

32:52.485 --> 33:04.071
And this is a great one to absorb with your kids because, you know, direwolves and the reference to Game of Thrones in some of the evening news, it's just hilarious.

33:05.114 --> 33:08.077
We've announced three species, the woolly mammoth, the diocene, and the dodo.

33:08.377 --> 33:16.344
But one of the things that's absolutely critical to ecosystems is predators, as we've seen with what's happened in Yellowstone with the reintroduction of wolves back into the park.

33:16.464 --> 33:19.666
They've shown that they've even reshaped the river systems.

33:19.907 --> 33:21.168
They've brought back beavers.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.649
They've brought back songbirds.

33:23.009 --> 33:26.372
And so we felt that it was very important for us to bring back the dire wolf.

33:26.412 --> 33:26.772
Dire wolf.

33:26.793 --> 33:27.213
The dire wolf.

33:27.253 --> 33:30.456
The dire wolf is the first species that we're bringing back at Colossal.

33:38.755 --> 33:51.663
The dire wolf, which most people think is just a mythical creature, was actually a keystone species that was not only endemic to the United States and mostly Americas, but it was actually culturally important to some of the biggest indigenous early tribes in America.

33:52.104 --> 34:01.890
So we thought if we could use it as an opportunity where we can also develop technologies that can help wolves, we thought it was the right first project given how important wolves are to ecosystems.

34:06.491 --> 34:13.733
One of the challenges when we started working on the direwolf was that we knew of only two direwolf specimens in the world that contained some usable DNA.

34:14.833 --> 34:23.115
One of our direwolf samples was a single tooth, and then another was a 72,000-year-old skull.

34:23.995 --> 34:29.876
So we were able to use these specimens and isolate this ancient DNA out of them.

34:31.647 --> 34:42.738
I'm already quite skeptical of that, although as a non-molecular biology super expert, I'm not going to put myself out on the line and saying they can't do this.

34:42.898 --> 34:50.165
But I would be very interested to hear the exact things they were able to pull up.

34:50.225 --> 34:52.087
The exact way that they did it.

34:52.167 --> 34:53.668
How they chose their primers.

34:53.709 --> 34:55.010
Were they based on wolves?

34:55.030 --> 34:56.091
Were they based on something?

34:57.032 --> 35:00.575
All this stuff, I think, in the details, the devil's in the details.

35:00.755 --> 35:05.700
And in this case, you're already seeing this kind of, how should we call it?

35:05.760 --> 35:09.043
Probably like a Theranos style pitch here.

35:10.623 --> 35:16.308
Before the dire wolf, there was a massive study that did many samples across multiple institutions.

35:17.209 --> 35:22.374
And Colossal took two of those samples and was able to generate whole genome sequences from each.

35:22.874 --> 35:27.498
And so this is incredible for any species, let alone species that have been extinct.

35:29.778 --> 35:37.926
So my guess would be that they use metagenomic sequencing with a few model genomes in mind, a few target genomes in mind.

35:38.106 --> 35:44.293
And so it is like saying that you took a shredded library

35:45.382 --> 35:56.867
and tried to assemble a book from the shredded fragments of individual sentences, and were able to assemble a book that looks pretty close to a book by Shakespeare.

35:57.227 --> 36:06.251
But all you really did was use a computer to pull all those shredded words out of a huge pile that is generated from a shredded library.

36:08.902 --> 36:35.332
Because if you take all the background DNA and all the background RNA and turn it into DNA, and then you take all that DNA and you amplify it enough to sample it and read it, and then you apply a algorithm to it and reconstruct something, if the background is loud enough, if the library is big enough, then making a kid's book out of the shredded remains of a library is a trivial thing.

36:37.344 --> 36:47.854
Making a magazine article about fly fishing is a trivial thing if you have the shredded remains of an entire library from which to choose your text.

36:49.595 --> 36:58.784
If you're trying to make a ransom note out of random text and you can pull from a whole library, then you can make your ransom note say whatever the hell you want.

37:00.822 --> 37:13.407
And in this context, what they're doing is they're saying that they generated a library of DNA fragments generated from the tooth, generated from the skull, and the preparation that they did.

37:13.667 --> 37:18.609
And all of those fragments are only from the skull, only from the tooth.

37:20.854 --> 37:33.841
And then they used a computer to try to assemble a full genome just like they do with viruses, with the pretense that anything that they can't find, they'll just substitute with a known book.

37:35.182 --> 37:39.885
Well, you know, it was tough to find the exact sentence, you know,

37:42.045 --> 37:44.786
the Queen doth protest too much or something like that.

37:44.806 --> 37:46.666
I don't know, I can't come up with anything off the top of my head.

37:47.226 --> 37:54.088
So, you know, we just assume that that sentence is where it's supposed to be because it is in the original Shakespeare book.

37:54.448 --> 37:56.728
So we'll just slap it in even though we didn't find it.

37:56.788 --> 38:10.511
So all of those sort of shortcomings and patchwork and hand-waving is happening here under the pretense of a sales pitch that they are able to recreate an entire genome

38:11.111 --> 38:28.343
from anatomical scraps that include a tooth and a skull, which quite possibly understand could be a gray wolf skull and a gray wolf tooth with what amounts to a gray wolf genome.

38:30.205 --> 38:38.371
And we're supposed to just take their word for it that the genome that they made and recorded is different and novel and pre

38:39.810 --> 38:44.112
pre-exists to a gray wolf skull.

38:44.212 --> 38:46.373
And that's the, that we just have to take their word for it.

38:46.393 --> 38:48.073
Cause it's a, it's a, it's a skull.

38:48.554 --> 38:51.515
And apparently it's definitely not a wolf skull.

38:51.615 --> 38:53.115
It's a dire wolf skull.

38:53.135 --> 38:58.497
What you can do is you can map that to its closest living relative.

38:59.658 --> 39:06.921
So at Colossal, we're using the gray wolf and we've been able to generate such a high quality genome that we can map back to create our own dire wolf reference genome.

39:08.188 --> 39:16.373
And so the whole pretense is, is that what they have constructed is a novel genome because why?

39:16.393 --> 39:22.297
The tooth and the skull are definitely direwolf skulls and tooth.

39:23.338 --> 39:24.919
That's the whole presumption here.

39:25.339 --> 39:37.107
If those two, if the skull and the tooth are actually just that of a gray wolf or a Mexican wolf or a Siberian wild dog or an African wild dog,

39:38.646 --> 39:51.134
then what they've done is nothing except for create a pseudo-wolf genome on the basis that, well, we start with the idea that it is a wolf, and we start with the great wolf genome.

39:51.174 --> 39:51.995
She just said that.

39:52.575 --> 40:04.543
So we're going to start with a Shakespeare book as what we're going to look for, and then we're going to go into a pile of a shredded library and pull out text until we've filled in most of the book and recreated most of the book.

40:05.612 --> 40:11.135
And so now we have what we call a Shakespeare, a novel Shakespeare book that's never been written before.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.096
And we're going to show you that, wow, look at what we can do.

40:14.136 --> 40:15.196
We have a new book here.

40:16.857 --> 40:20.519
But if it's just a library that had Shakespeare in it already.

40:25.515 --> 40:45.602
I hope you can see the point I'm trying to make and how all of this rests on the idea that that skull and that tooth, not only do they produce DNA, but that DNA is presumed to be unique instead of just a variant of wolves currently or dogs currently.

40:46.402 --> 40:52.624
And we're supposed to believe that the genetic differences are so profound and obvious that they were able to detect them all.

40:55.435 --> 41:11.827
There's an amazing amount of magic happening here, which coincides exactly with the same illusion that the Human Genome Project is, that these genomes are real sequences that they just read out because they're just letters in a pile over there.

41:11.867 --> 41:13.788
But they're not letters in a pile.

41:15.049 --> 41:16.910
It's not a shredded library.

41:18.091 --> 41:23.035
The result of these experiments is a model of a book.

41:23.922 --> 41:29.085
that could be found in the library based on the computer assessment of the shredding.

41:31.186 --> 41:36.489
And that assessment can be tweaked based on the target, like the gray wolf.

41:37.450 --> 41:38.690
It's just so absurd.

41:38.850 --> 41:47.095
It's so absurd that they are, and you see all the intellectual dark web people and that he was already on with, it's just remarkable.

41:50.279 --> 42:02.342
When we edit different lines of genetically diverse gray wolves, we'll create a set of genetically diverse dire wolves with similar edits, but the basis of their diversity already existed within the gray wolf.

42:03.542 --> 42:09.183
So the basis of their diversity exists in the gray wolf, but they're making a new dire wolf.

42:09.263 --> 42:11.603
So they've already admitted that this is just bullshit.

42:12.604 --> 42:18.765
They've sequenced an old wolf and pretended that that old wolf is a dire wolf.

42:20.123 --> 42:29.613
And the sequence that they're making is an old extinct sequence when all they're really doing is probably at best just kind of pretending to clone a dog.

42:30.994 --> 42:31.635
That's about it.

42:33.737 --> 42:38.782
Gray wolves are on the endangered species list and that means you can just go in and collect the samples that we want.

42:39.338 --> 42:45.841
Typically, people have to take a ear punch or a skin biopsy, and sometimes it's a very invasive process for the animal.

42:46.401 --> 42:53.684
We've developed a technology where you can take a simple blood draw, isolate these specific cells in the blood, and then clone from it.

42:54.324 --> 42:54.885
Oh, there you go.

42:55.945 --> 42:56.485
Ta-da!

42:57.966 --> 42:59.767
It's the Theranos experiment!

42:59.827 --> 43:07.030
In a nutshell, we can take a blood sample, and we can do a whole genome sequence and read it all.

43:08.359 --> 43:09.339
And we're very good at it.

43:10.220 --> 43:11.780
And it's very non-invasive.

43:15.462 --> 43:27.446
We're changing the genome of this living animal partially into the genome of the extinct animal for those genes that matter for the traits and characteristics that we want to see in that animal.

43:28.207 --> 43:36.670
So the implication, of course, is that they can take the genome of the gray wolf and they can point to all of the genes and all the characteristics

43:37.290 --> 43:46.278
and they can just mod them like it's a little, you know, a Minecraft world where they can flip switches on different things and different levels of textures and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

43:46.698 --> 43:48.139
They have all of this already.

43:48.199 --> 43:49.080
It's just easy.

43:50.541 --> 43:51.542
That's the enchantment.

43:54.637 --> 44:02.202
Discovering which parts of the genome make an animal look and act like that animal is one of the hardest problems in biology.

44:02.443 --> 44:08.727
It is unsolved and something that we have to solve if we want to know which parts of the genome we want to edit.

44:09.207 --> 44:10.989
Oh, so we have to solve it.

44:11.049 --> 44:13.891
It's an unsolved problem, but we have to solve it.

44:14.291 --> 44:19.575
She hasn't even identified the fact that the trajectory through time and the instructions of how to do that

44:20.075 --> 44:27.197
are not even, we haven't even remotely begun to look for those or identify those or even think about how that might be encoded and where.

44:28.958 --> 44:37.041
She can't even describe life in a significant enough way so that you understand that she respects the irreducible complexity that she claims to be working on.

44:38.401 --> 44:44.463
And that is again where this new biology 101 is just going to, it's going to massacre, destroy this.

44:44.663 --> 44:49.485
It's going to run this over like a great big truck over a little stuffed animal.

44:50.503 --> 44:52.444
Because all of this stuff is nonsense.

44:52.544 --> 45:00.889
All of this mythology just disappears once you understand the biology that Joshua Lederberg and his contemporaries established.

45:01.369 --> 45:05.652
And then the people that came after him seem to have just kind of decided, yeah, never mind.

45:07.212 --> 45:09.694
To make a gray wolf more like a dire wolf.

45:10.734 --> 45:19.400
To analyze our genomes, to compare dire wolves with gray wolf genomes, we use our tools on a platform built by FormBio.

45:19.420 --> 45:22.702
It's a bioinformatics company that spun out of Colossal.

45:23.482 --> 45:35.370
They built this whole suite of analysis tools and algorithms that allow us to find the differences between the dire wolf genome and the gray wolf genome and filter out these differences that we actually want to edit.

45:35.890 --> 45:38.652
And so we aligned our dire wolf reads to the gray wolf

45:38.732 --> 45:39.992
What an interesting algorithm.

45:40.032 --> 45:43.254
I wonder if you can apply that to different ethnic backgrounds of human.

45:56.562 --> 46:05.486
One of the most exciting differences that we found in the direwolf genome is that there is a change in the L-choral gene.

46:05.726 --> 46:08.668
L-choral is a key regulator of animal size.

46:10.342 --> 46:20.945
What an interesting observation, you know, like they show you a protein binding to something and L-coral is related to size.

46:21.305 --> 46:26.707
I don't know how much we expect dire wolves to be a lot bigger than regular wolves.

46:26.747 --> 46:27.427
I don't think we do.

46:28.419 --> 46:30.861
Next, we have to use gene editing technologies.

46:31.421 --> 46:35.704
We have cells growing in a dish in a lab that belong to a gray wolf.

46:35.824 --> 46:37.545
And so these have gray wolf genomes.

46:37.785 --> 46:43.129
Oh, so they start with a gray wolf genome and then they mutate it in a few places and then call it a dire wolf.

46:46.811 --> 46:51.854
They are basically cloning a gray wolf with a few edits.

46:53.435 --> 46:54.736
This is really Theranos.

46:54.876 --> 46:55.897
It's really a joke.

46:56.157 --> 46:57.038
It's really a joke.

46:58.237 --> 47:00.799
We've decided which part of that genome we want to chain.

47:01.039 --> 47:08.704
In fact, I would be willing to bet that when they did this, they had to use hundreds of embryos to get one to land.

47:08.984 --> 47:10.866
I bet you, I bet dollars to donuts.

47:11.798 --> 47:19.641
So one at a time, we take our gene editing tools and we go into that cell and we cut out the bit of DNA that looks like a gray wolf.

47:19.762 --> 47:24.804
And look at that, how they, look at how they showed that they showed them sucking stuff out of a cell.

47:25.744 --> 47:28.846
And now they're saying what, that that's how they get the DNA out?

47:28.986 --> 47:30.306
Are they really saying that?

47:30.566 --> 47:31.307
That looks like a diary.

47:31.847 --> 47:38.070
One at a time, we take our gene editing tools and we go into that cell and we cut out the bit of DNA.

47:38.490 --> 47:40.771
That is freaking remarkable.

47:41.707 --> 47:47.091
That is freaking remarkable because that has nothing to do with what this lady's saying.

47:47.171 --> 47:49.793
So now, can you take these people seriously?

47:49.813 --> 47:53.115
Or are they actually pulling a little snake oil on you here?

47:53.535 --> 48:03.682
I don't think you can see anything else other than snake oil if they say that we pull the gene out as they show them removing the contents of an ovum.

48:04.403 --> 48:04.863
It's like,

48:09.246 --> 48:13.709
that looks like a gray wolf and paste in its place the DNA that looks like a dire wolf.

48:14.889 --> 48:23.194
Each time you edit the gene in a cell, you put a lot of stress on that cell because you have to get your gene editing tools in these cells and then these changes are made.

48:23.634 --> 48:27.096
So what we do instead is we try to make dozens or hundreds of changes at once.

48:27.156 --> 48:28.557
It's called multiplex gene editing.

48:30.498 --> 48:37.342
So now we have cells growing in a dish in a lab that have DNA that makes them a little bit more dire wolf-like than gray wolf-like.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.763
We have to transform these living cells.

48:40.883 --> 48:44.026
It's weird that they had to show a bacterial culture there, isn't it?

48:45.228 --> 48:47.431
I wonder what they're using the bacterial culture for.

48:48.792 --> 48:51.996
It's very strange that they just happened to, oops, sorry.

48:52.517 --> 48:54.078
That's a bacterial culture.

48:54.119 --> 48:55.040
What do you need that for?

48:55.901 --> 48:56.802
What are you making there?

49:00.575 --> 49:04.637
Let's just go back once just to make sure you see that that was a bacterial culture.

49:05.457 --> 49:10.019
Into actual pups growing in a dish in a lab that belonged to a gray wolf.

49:10.179 --> 49:11.879
And so these have gray wolf genomes.

49:12.260 --> 49:14.981
Now we've decided which part of that genome we want to change.

49:15.041 --> 49:26.205
So one at a time, we take our gene editing tools and we go into that cell and we cut out the bit of DNA that looks like a gray wolf and paste in its place the DNA that looks like a dire wolf.

49:27.409 --> 49:35.713
Each time you edit a gene in a cell, you put a lot of stress on that cell because you have to get your gene editing tools in these cells and then these changes are made.

49:36.154 --> 49:39.615
So what we do instead is we try to make dozens or hundreds of changes at once.

49:39.695 --> 49:41.096
It's called multiplex gene editing.

49:43.037 --> 49:49.901
So now we have cells growing in a dish in a lab that have DNA that makes them a little bit more dire wolf-like than gray wolf-like.

49:51.121 --> 49:52.382
That's not a cell culture.

49:55.433 --> 50:02.480
So they are making these changes using plasmids in bacteria.

50:04.942 --> 50:09.006
They are generating large quantities of pure DNA in bacteria.

50:09.046 --> 50:13.371
They are selecting from these quantities of DNA the DNA that they want.

50:13.511 --> 50:14.732
It's not them.

50:16.817 --> 50:25.440
They're using bacterial cell techniques to create the DNA and to get the DNA to be mutated in the ways that they want.

50:25.980 --> 50:30.122
They're creating libraries of randoms and selecting from them.

50:31.462 --> 50:38.805
They're doing things with bacterial cultures, ladies and gentlemen, and pretending that this has nothing to do with biology.

50:39.225 --> 50:40.905
Who cares about microbiology?

50:40.966 --> 50:42.166
Who's Joshua Lederberg?

50:45.165 --> 50:48.546
We have to transform these living cells into actual pups.

50:48.926 --> 50:53.908
We have to transform these living cells, and they do that with bacteriophages.

50:54.128 --> 50:56.748
They do that with bacterial genetics.

50:56.848 --> 51:03.990
They do that with synthetic biology, which is just bacterial recombinant DNA.

51:04.110 --> 51:04.971
It's crazy.

51:06.331 --> 51:08.892
This is just as fake as RNA virology is.

51:09.963 --> 51:14.725
And for that, we use a process called cloning, or somatic cell nuclear transfer.

51:14.825 --> 51:18.287
This is the same process that most famously brought us Dolly the Sheep.

51:19.568 --> 51:22.609
They are actually cloning a dog.

51:23.349 --> 51:34.535
And they're putting a few mutations in it that they claim are derived from a tooth and a skull fragment that they say is a dire wolf.

51:34.915 --> 51:36.936
That's the whole premise here.

51:39.335 --> 51:43.157
You take an egg, an oocyte from a wolf or a dog.

51:43.937 --> 51:47.699
You take out its own DNA and you stick that direwolf cell in it.

51:49.180 --> 51:49.840
That cell?

51:50.160 --> 51:53.022
There was already the magic, the direwolf cell in it.

51:53.062 --> 51:54.523
It's not a direwolf cell.

51:54.563 --> 51:55.943
It was a gray wolf cell.

51:55.963 --> 51:56.904
You said it yourself.

51:59.315 --> 52:04.177
And then you use bacterial genetics to make mutations in the DNA of it.

52:04.397 --> 52:05.177
It's just crazy.

52:05.517 --> 52:07.118
It becomes an embryo that's a dire wolf.

52:07.678 --> 52:11.600
It's no longer a domestic dog, which sounds totally science fiction.

52:11.960 --> 52:18.062
And with the help of a vet team, we then are able to surgically put this embryo back inside to the surrogate dog.

52:18.563 --> 52:22.064
We have to find an appropriate dog that can carry our dire wolf.

52:22.144 --> 52:24.285
There's a reason why these people are so young.

52:25.888 --> 52:35.411
And it's because they can't possibly have the requisite biological experience and knowledge to judge whether they're doing anything real or imaginary.

52:37.332 --> 52:38.432
They can't possibly.

52:39.833 --> 52:41.893
And so they can be told what they're doing.

52:41.973 --> 52:43.294
They believe what they're doing.

52:43.314 --> 52:46.315
And then it's really a magic trick here.

52:48.696 --> 52:53.937
Everyone is thinking very critically about each step so that when that pup is finally born.

52:54.058 --> 52:55.158
Those are children.

52:57.264 --> 53:11.290
Those are children, those are actors at best, but these are not the people that are making the decisions on the molecular biology lab bench that's running these plasmids and growing them using the SV40 promoter.

53:11.330 --> 53:12.370
I mean, give me a break.

53:13.511 --> 53:15.131
We know there aren't any issues.

53:15.752 --> 53:19.593
The safety of all of our surrogates for any of our species is the highest priority.

53:19.933 --> 53:21.054
For any of our species.

53:23.427 --> 53:28.968
The safety of the surrogate moms that we use is the highest priority because this is really about the animals.

53:30.148 --> 53:41.430
We have an overemphasis on our animal husbandry team to secure their safety, as well as are pursuing on the science side, our own exogenous development team so that one day we won't have to use surrogates.

53:42.590 --> 53:48.351
Exogenous development team, so we won't have to use surrogates.

53:48.391 --> 53:52.712
We'll just use our own bioengineered animals, which are really

53:54.096 --> 53:59.580
The most exciting part is when the vet team comes in, they do their ultrasound and they say, yeah, congrats.

54:00.341 --> 54:02.122
You're going to be a puppy mom or, you know.

54:02.582 --> 54:03.523
So that's exciting.

54:03.563 --> 54:05.444
There's only two pups right now.

54:05.504 --> 54:06.525
What is she talking about?

54:06.545 --> 54:08.847
Do they have a lot more pups that they haven't announced?

54:09.847 --> 54:12.930
Or were they doing this incrementally with like one change?

54:13.700 --> 54:17.121
and then two changes, or then when they got lucky, they tried that one.

54:17.141 --> 54:26.522
And they didn't announce it until now, when they have like so many, that they were able to get so many changes that they can identify.

54:26.683 --> 54:30.483
And so they're showing you now something that as a result, they can claim.

54:30.603 --> 54:32.964
You're gonna have a cub on the ground in a couple of weeks.

54:33.704 --> 54:37.705
After the pups are delivered, there's a care team in place.

54:38.025 --> 54:38.925
Is she gonna cry?

54:40.100 --> 54:40.721
Is she gonna cry?

54:40.801 --> 54:46.966
Dyer wolves are happy and healthy and that mom- They keep saying Dyer wolves and it's just annoying.

54:47.726 --> 54:49.868
Has gone through delivery without any problems.

54:50.509 --> 54:53.131
And then we have another team that will- That's not them.

54:53.471 --> 54:54.312
That's not them.

54:55.093 --> 54:56.174
That's a Mexican wolf.

54:56.254 --> 54:58.095
That's so stupid, it's not even funny.

54:58.135 --> 54:59.717
Those are wolves in a zoo.

55:00.357 --> 55:01.738
Pups have the right dynamics.

55:01.798 --> 55:03.420
They have the right social structures.

55:05.100 --> 55:12.684
We're working actively right now with partners today to make sure that there are solutions and places for these animals to go in the future.

55:13.265 --> 55:16.486
And then they're going to let them out in the wild because that's what they're doing?

55:16.586 --> 55:17.227
Like what?

55:17.647 --> 55:17.947
Really?

55:17.967 --> 55:21.049
Are you going to put them back where they ecologically belong?

55:22.662 --> 55:27.147
Are you going to put them back where they ecologically belong to the detriment of those that are already there?

55:27.187 --> 55:28.188
Will they interbreed?

55:28.208 --> 55:31.311
I mean, what kind of bullshit nonsense is this?

55:31.351 --> 55:33.193
This can't be real.

55:33.493 --> 55:39.039
And it's really important to say that all of this is done in... But it can be that all of these people are bamboozled.

55:39.219 --> 55:44.724
It can be that all of these scientists are not sophisticated enough to understand

55:45.325 --> 55:59.236
that the Human Genome Project is an elaborate theater that requires decades more data collection and probably decades more of reiteration before any meaningful results will come.

56:00.076 --> 56:05.180
They don't even have the infrastructure to integrate that data with all the medical data we have.

56:05.220 --> 56:07.702
That's why they're building all those things in Texas right now.

56:07.762 --> 56:08.863
Come on, this is a joke.

56:10.324 --> 56:11.285
In this massive network,

56:12.361 --> 56:20.305
It's critical to work with private landowners, local governments, indigenous people groups, and the public at large to do that in a way that's safe.

56:20.485 --> 56:23.366
What a magnificent cat herding operation.

56:23.426 --> 56:39.634
Look at how many intelligent, motivated people are dedicating energy to this bullshit that could otherwise be fighting a US vaccine schedule that's criminal and is spreading the word that intramuscular injection is so dumb

56:41.004 --> 56:43.205
And we should stop doing it to our children now.

56:45.527 --> 56:48.228
But they're focused on de-extinction.

56:50.349 --> 56:54.351
And publicly accepted, but also it's good for the ecosystem and the animals themselves.

56:54.832 --> 57:00.695
What we're doing is having all of this collaboration in place well before we have these animals.

57:00.735 --> 57:04.037
And this is absolutely critical to making this work successful.

57:05.965 --> 57:09.246
We're a part of the evolutionary stream of the planet.

57:09.286 --> 57:12.367
We're kin to every other species out there.

57:13.007 --> 57:23.971
And so because we have the ability to shape the world, I think we have a responsibility to correct our mistakes from the past.

57:24.833 --> 57:29.556
What we do today is, I think, what the hope for the future is for biodiversity and for nature.

57:29.876 --> 57:40.263
And so to be on sort of the ground floor of creating a tool that will be the solution for our biodiversity crisis is the most motivating thought that I could ever have.

57:41.304 --> 57:44.426
A solution to our biodiversity crisis.

57:44.446 --> 57:45.426
We'll just make them.

57:46.367 --> 57:52.411
I mean, I can't really fathom it, but it is very clear that these people believe.

57:53.817 --> 58:02.585
They believe in this idea, this cause, and it is because they thoroughly believe in the bad biology 101.

58:03.766 --> 58:05.508
We're evolution because DNA.

58:07.009 --> 58:08.230
It's a disaster.

58:09.692 --> 58:12.134
That's why we need to save our children together.

58:14.076 --> 58:17.499
Because they're surrounded by adults that are absolutely lost.

58:20.783 --> 58:23.465
What we're doing at Colossal has never been done before.

58:24.646 --> 58:32.632
I hope everyone around the world is leveraging the technologies that we develop here, and I hope that biodiversity loss and extinction is just a thing of the past.

58:34.294 --> 58:43.821
The idea of being able to have dire wolves again is tremendously personally exciting, and I think it's gonna be exciting to a lot of people.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.343
The first time I see a dire wolf?

58:46.363 --> 58:47.084
Oh, my God.

58:47.104 --> 58:49.626
A dire wolf's a big, fluffy dog that I probably wouldn't pet.

58:50.140 --> 58:53.942
I think it's going to be amazing in a lot of ways.

58:56.303 --> 59:02.426
I'm really excited to see the birth of this direwolf pup and all the hard work that all of the teams have contributed to.

59:03.987 --> 59:10.410
There's so many people that have had their hand in this, that it's just fulfilling for us to see, okay, we did it.

59:11.810 --> 59:16.933
We produced something that is magnificent and science fiction at its finest.

59:23.679 --> 59:23.940
So,

59:55.899 --> 59:57.580
Looks a lot like Micah, I gotta say.

59:58.201 --> 01:00:00.662
Although Micah doesn't have quite that shepherdy nose.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:05.285
He's got a stouter, stronger nose.

01:00:06.246 --> 01:00:07.267
They look a little foxy.

01:00:11.009 --> 01:00:14.211
Ha, they might have made that with the same little thing that I make mine with.

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:16.333
That is maze balls.

01:00:16.453 --> 01:00:20.315
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to share this with you.

01:00:22.099 --> 01:00:24.240
I think of it a little bit like the Netherlands.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.742
Eventually they will be underwater again.

01:00:26.962 --> 01:00:36.007
It is an inevitability because the pumps need gas and the dykes need maintenance and they live in denial, yet their system will chug along until the diesel engines stop.

01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:41.219
or some other catastrophic failure occurs, the Dutch will never abandon their project.

01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:49.223
So in case you're not aware, most of the northern part of the Netherlands is technically under sea level.

01:00:49.803 --> 01:01:00.748
And it is only kept dry by a lot of diesel-fueled pumps that pump water out of that region of the Netherlands 100%, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

01:01:00.788 --> 01:01:01.868
Yes, there are dikes.

01:01:06.431 --> 01:01:07.714
but that's underwater.

01:01:08.559 --> 01:01:11.761
And if they stopped the pumps, that place would flood.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:26.091
And so eventually, because of weather or collapse or erosion, or just the fact that those pumps get turned off for a little while, the Netherlands will eventually be underwater.

01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:29.873
But none of those people are going to abandon their lives there.

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:34.436
None of those people are going to abandon that project, even though it is a certainty.

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:35.557
If it's in 100 years or 1,000 years,

01:01:37.638 --> 01:01:40.420
some or all of the Netherlands is going to go back underwater.

01:01:41.641 --> 01:02:00.534
Now, my argument is that the overclass, the people for whom the overclass is the people for whom money doesn't matter, the overclass can predict and orchestrate societal failures and therefore can also frame social media governance in the context of knowing what failures are coming.

01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:10.121
The overclass can predict and orchestrate societal failures and therefore can also frame social media governance in the context of knowing what failures are coming.

01:02:10.882 --> 01:02:21.210
In other words, they can use militarized social media representations of these crises to curate mythologies most advantageous to the overclass.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:33.939
and militarized social media representations are composed primarily of coordinated groups of liars, supported by anonymous bots, sock puppets, i.e.

01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:35.480
digital Truman shows.

01:02:36.982 --> 01:02:42.546
And so the overclass is never going to abandon this project and the myths that edify it, and there will be new myths.

01:02:43.147 --> 01:02:47.090
And so this project extends back to the 50s and to the 30s, before DNA,

01:02:51.007 --> 01:03:01.595
when they already had the plan to take over the evolution of the species in a eugenics kind of way, making sure that they were breeding the right people.

01:03:02.716 --> 01:03:06.559
And more importantly, making sure that they could collect this data before they got rid of us.

01:03:07.639 --> 01:03:09.421
And this plan is not going away.

01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:14.810
because it's on a longer timescale than social media can ever represent.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:26.793
And so unless you really start to understand that this is a game that they can lose in the short term, because they're committed to winning it in the longterm, they can even have a loss that lasts for six months.

01:03:27.953 --> 01:03:31.674
They can have a setback that lasts as long as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:35.015
is Health and Human Services Secretary and the actual,

01:03:37.585 --> 01:03:39.245
The project is not going to change.

01:03:39.305 --> 01:03:40.306
It's not going to go away.

01:03:40.706 --> 01:03:44.507
Kevin McKernan is still going to have a job after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:45.587
is used up and gone.

01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:51.789
Ladies and gentlemen, synthetic recombinant genetics is all that they have.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:56.230
The vast majority of our tools are derived from bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:03:57.691 --> 01:04:01.492
Even the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a bacteriophage system.

01:04:02.841 --> 01:04:06.243
And they can make large quantities of DNA and they've been doing it for a long time.

01:04:06.283 --> 01:04:07.744
They can put those things places.

01:04:08.684 --> 01:04:13.567
But PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud for the simple fact that the background is too loud.

01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:28.579
The background is too unquantifiable to use something like PCR as a diagnostic and certainly not with a kind of strict scrutiny equivalent that would allow us to see what they were really doing.

01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:34.983
And it's never going to be there because it is as simple as a synthetic recombinant peer signal in quantity.

01:04:35.623 --> 01:04:38.164
could be found and then claimed to have found.

01:04:38.645 --> 01:04:49.310
For example, a bacteriophage could be released in Wuhan containing a sequence and that sequence could be found and reported and claimed to be something else, evidence of something else.

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:59.215
And it would require no special biology, just a spectacular commitment to the lie that that bacteriophage signal was indeed something else, you know, like a coronavirus.

01:05:00.555 --> 01:05:03.657
The funny thing is, is that a transfection is an old word

01:05:04.229 --> 01:05:11.799
And it would have been a crime before 2020 to do it in a healthy person without their absolute consent and them understanding how dumb it was.

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:14.955
And the way they got away with this is with a placebo.

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:22.381
The reason why they did it is so that transfection could be rolled out under the pretense that the mouth breathers accept it worked for COVID.

01:05:22.761 --> 01:05:33.531
So it must be a new technology that maybe even could replace the old vaccine schedule that's going to be soon admitted to be faulty because the adjuvants aren't that great for you.

01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:37.214
But you know, there's no adjuvants in mRNA vaccines.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:43.087
Ladies and gentlemen, they are ruling us by mythology.

01:05:43.187 --> 01:05:53.713
One of the best things to learn what it means and therefore why it's a myth is endemicity and the idea of a molecule going endemic.

01:05:53.753 --> 01:05:58.596
With nonspecific PCR tests and a spectacular commitment to lies, they could have pulled this off.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.178
RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:01.238 --> 01:06:04.319
Nobody says it better than gigaohm biological RNA cannot pandemic.

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:05.700
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.402
Transfecting healthy people is a crime.

01:06:09.162 --> 01:06:13.063
And the population pyramids are a problem in need of solving.

01:06:14.483 --> 01:06:16.963
I am not finding, where are you?

01:06:17.123 --> 01:06:18.844
There you are, right there.

01:06:18.924 --> 01:06:19.724
Needs to go.

01:06:19.924 --> 01:06:20.704
Here we go.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:21.744
Sorry about that.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:22.924
Thank you very much.

01:06:25.265 --> 01:06:26.285
See you again tomorrow.

01:06:26.885 --> 01:06:30.766
I will probably post the, I haven't made the decision yet.

01:06:30.806 --> 01:06:34.406
I got three on my, on the plate of which one to start with.

01:06:34.646 --> 01:06:37.947
There's a set of papers that we're gonna work through over the next couple of weeks.

01:06:38.925 --> 01:06:52.893
I'll probably post either tonight or early tomorrow morning the Journal Club paper and then we'll cover it on Wednesday and then we'll do a discussion and lecture on Biology 101 on Thursday and then Friday we'll have a little meddler stream again.

01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:58.116
I don't know what Taco Tuesday will be next week, but this was Taco Tuesday this week.

01:06:58.136 --> 01:06:59.116
Thank you very much for being here.

01:06:59.536 --> 01:07:00.197
See you guys again soon.
