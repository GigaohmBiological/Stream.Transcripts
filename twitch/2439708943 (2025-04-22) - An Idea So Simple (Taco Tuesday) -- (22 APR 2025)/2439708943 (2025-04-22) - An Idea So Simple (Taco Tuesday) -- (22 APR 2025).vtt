00:35.632 --> 00:39.873
Our first public comment speaker is Mr. Jonathan Cooey.

00:42.054 --> 00:42.294
Hello.

00:42.314 --> 00:42.834
Can you hear me?

00:42.854 --> 00:44.735
Go ahead.

00:45.235 --> 00:45.595
Thank you.

00:45.655 --> 00:48.417
My name is Jonathan Cooey, and I have no conflicts of interest.

00:48.797 --> 00:53.999
The ethical principle of informed consent has been effectively ignored for the duration of the pandemic.

00:54.699 --> 01:02.482
The FDA and the CDC long ago failed to meet their responsibility to ensure informed consent in those healthy adults who have been already transfected.

01:03.163 --> 01:07.845
most egregiously in the healthy college students and teens for whom there was never an emergency.

01:08.485 --> 01:18.669
The CDC and FDA failed again just days ago to provide the opportunity for informed consent, this time for parents of children under five when recommending transfection as safe and effective.

01:19.249 --> 01:29.553
After nearly two years of calling transfection by lipid nanoparticle an investigative vaccine, you have failed to provide informed consent by pushing a false equivalence between transfection

01:30.166 --> 01:33.167
and traditional live attenuated and recombinant vaccines.

01:33.667 --> 01:51.472
You have failed to inform the public that transfection, the expression of a viral protein by injection of synthetic RNA, is a highly variable and tissue-dependent process that we are unsure can provoke meaningful immune memory, the goal of any vaccination.

01:51.972 --> 01:59.174
You have failed to notify the public of the potential for autoimmunity while also failing to look for this known downside of this technique.

01:59.932 --> 02:05.816
The FDA have no data to support recommending transfection for any healthy human in 2022.

02:06.456 --> 02:13.781
After more than two years, you have failed to inform the public that you know the studies upon which these recommendations are based are woefully underpowered.

02:14.421 --> 02:20.605
In place of informed consent, you have pushed the vague concepts of safe and effective until they were devoid of meaning.

02:21.066 --> 02:29.311
The studies used to specifically recommend transfection to the under five age group are statistical jokes without clinically meaningful endpoints.

02:29.818 --> 02:33.561
You know, immunobridging to non-inferiority is useless.

02:33.681 --> 02:34.662
Do your job.

02:35.163 --> 02:49.915
Of course, the CDC, NIH, and NIAID also failed to inform the public that they knew late in 2019 that the virus had already several key molecular aspects that indicated both its origin and the many known countermeasures that would be expected to work.

02:50.496 --> 02:52.277
Instead, they said they knew nothing.

02:52.337 --> 02:57.542
They could see nothing unusual, and that our immune systems were equally vulnerable, and you ran with it.

02:58.027 --> 03:08.153
Data from your own presentations demonstrate the vast majority of kids have been infected, a primary counter indication for the administration of any vaccine before 2020.

03:08.753 --> 03:14.976
You are pushing products under the guise of a regulatory framework that we know by your actions is pro forma only.

03:15.537 --> 03:26.643
You failed to inform the public that you know from studying influenza and other viruses that the developing immune system is an impossibly complicated process that involves imprinting mechanisms that cannot be reversed.

03:27.242 --> 03:35.287
The catalog of molecular immune memories that protects us for a lifetime has formed through the countless exposures of pathogens in our childhood.

03:35.307 --> 03:43.651
And you have failed to inform the public that you know that transfection to a 2020 viral code protein cannot be useful in augmenting this process.

03:44.172 --> 03:49.575
You know it will not meaningfully protect these children because there is a planet worth of data informing you of this.

03:50.315 --> 03:51.236
It's biology.

03:51.376 --> 03:53.517
Please get some and then do your job.

03:55.518 --> 03:56.118
We will move on.

03:56.158 --> 03:56.999
Thank you for your comment.

03:57.059 --> 03:58.199
We'll move on to the next.

04:01.279 --> 04:04.960
Please turn your attention to the video board for a special tribute video.

04:08.141 --> 04:16.963
With the fifth pick in the 2018 NBA draft, the Dallas Mavericks select Luka Doncic from Ljubljana, Slovenia.

04:18.848 --> 04:19.909
Hi, it's Luka Doncic.

04:20.009 --> 04:27.114
I'm really excited to be a part of the Dallas Mavericks team, and I hope you will enjoy my games, and you will enjoy how I play, and I hope to see you soon.

04:27.195 --> 04:32.439
And 2019 Rookie of the Year is... Luka Doncic.

04:47.475 --> 04:48.555
with a little spice.

04:48.875 --> 04:53.676
How did he get that through all those defenders and hands and arms?

04:53.736 --> 04:54.617
He's trying to win it back.

04:54.637 --> 04:54.697
Oh!

04:54.777 --> 04:54.857
Oh!

04:54.917 --> 04:54.997

05:00.158 --> 05:00.198

05:00.218 --> 05:00.378

05:00.498 --> 05:00.538

05:00.638 --> 05:00.738

05:06.139 --> 05:06.219

05:07.119 --> 05:07.239
Oh!

05:07.319 --> 05:07.479
Oh!

05:07.559 --> 05:07.739
Oh!

05:07.799 --> 05:07.919
Oh!

05:07.939 --> 05:07.979
Oh!

05:07.999 --> 05:08.119
Oh!

05:08.139 --> 05:08.179
Oh!

05:08.239 --> 05:08.359
Oh!

05:08.459 --> 05:08.559
Oh!

05:08.619 --> 05:08.659
Oh!

05:08.679 --> 05:08.739
Oh!

05:08.819 --> 05:08.860
Oh!

05:08.880 --> 05:08.940
Oh!

05:08.960 --> 05:09.040
Oh!

05:09.080 --> 05:09.120
Oh!

05:09.160 --> 05:09.220
Oh!

05:09.260 --> 05:09.300
Oh!

05:09.320 --> 05:09.400
Oh!

05:09.420 --> 05:09.740
Oh!

05:09.760 --> 05:09.900
Oh!

05:09.920 --> 05:09.960
Oh!

05:10.000 --> 05:10.040
Oh!

05:10.080 --> 05:10.220
Oh!

05:10.240 --> 05:10.420
Oh!

05:10.460 --> 05:10.500
Oh!

05:10.560 --> 05:10.740
Oh!

05:10.760 --> 05:10.820
Oh!

05:10.840 --> 05:10.880
Oh!

05:10.900 --> 05:10.940
Oh!

05:10.960 --> 05:11.040
Oh!

05:11.060 --> 05:11.100
Oh!

05:11.120 --> 05:11.160
Oh

05:12.364 --> 05:20.186
Dodgers pulls off three-pointer.

05:20.206 --> 05:20.426
Bang!

05:20.466 --> 05:20.586
Bang!

05:20.666 --> 05:21.126
It's good!

05:21.206 --> 05:21.587
Amazing.

05:21.667 --> 05:22.387
Amazing.

05:22.427 --> 05:22.787
Amazing.

05:42.529 --> 05:48.991
As crazy as it might sound, I think they even have to destroy something as seemingly harmless as the NBA.

05:49.831 --> 05:57.093
They have to destroy what everything that America is and represents, everything that was good about America, they have to destroy it.

05:58.214 --> 06:08.196
And that includes everything that things like the NBA represent, where dreams could come true for anyone on the planet to be one of the 240 men that are allowed to play

06:10.623 --> 06:15.607
given the extremely wonderful opportunity.

06:15.627 --> 06:23.474
Do you think Luka Doncic left and they traded him because they're dumb?

06:23.494 --> 06:27.757
Do you think they traded him because LeBron James is a genius?

06:29.459 --> 06:38.326
Or do you think they traded him as part of an ongoing, slowly dismantling this once something that united the country?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.691
in its greatness, the dream team.

06:41.711 --> 06:44.232
Do you remember the dream team?

06:44.272 --> 06:50.735
Because that was when the NBA represented everything that you can imagine was good about America.

06:52.295 --> 07:00.699
A bunch of black dudes and a bunch of white dudes from mainstream, it's main street America going to beat the world in basketball.

07:00.759 --> 07:08.302
That's where we used to be in 1992 when I graduated from college or high school and was going to college.

07:09.471 --> 07:17.217
That's the America that I'm fighting for, the America that I want my kids to be able to inherit, not this crazy place where we are now.

07:18.318 --> 07:19.739
And I think we can turn it around.

07:19.779 --> 07:25.764
I think we can take it back because I think we all agree, we all agree that that's the America we want.

07:26.225 --> 07:29.908
The America of the dream team, the America of like 1992.

07:29.948 --> 07:29.988
Ms.

07:30.048 --> 07:37.194
Hoover, once again, the lesson plan I prepared would have covered this topic much better, but I can see...

07:42.808 --> 08:06.134
It's Tuesday Lisa, we have to start a movement we have to start a movement It's gotta be a movement like Taco Tuesday it really does Think but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

08:06.154 --> 08:06.194
Oh

08:07.947 --> 08:08.688
And I have lied.

08:08.848 --> 08:09.729
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:09.749 --> 08:10.669
I don't want to lie.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.511
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

08:12.611 --> 08:13.652
I try not to be a liar.

08:13.672 --> 08:14.532
I don't want to be a liar.

08:15.093 --> 08:17.855
I think it's like, really important not to be a liar.

08:20.117 --> 08:25.281
Specialization should make you suspicious, because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on.

08:25.742 --> 08:28.844
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

08:29.284 --> 08:31.226
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

08:31.246 --> 08:34.388
And that's, that's, that's sort of my starting my starting bias.

08:46.738 --> 08:48.260
Please share the stream right now.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.785
This is one of the most important ones I've ever done.

08:51.805 --> 08:54.028
This one's for Nate.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.579
I'm Dr. Ryan Cole.

13:40.819 --> 13:41.300
I'm an MD.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.041
I'm a physician.

13:42.842 --> 13:47.450
Mayo Clinic trained anatomic clinical pathology subspecialty fellowship in dermatopathology.

13:47.470 --> 13:48.672
I do molecular biology.

13:48.692 --> 13:51.336
I've done over 150,000 COVID tests in my laboratory.

13:57.498 --> 13:59.540
Hey, good morning, everybody.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.480
Good afternoon.

14:00.540 --> 14:00.981
Good evening.

14:01.021 --> 14:01.361
Good night.

14:01.421 --> 14:02.722
It's 12 p.m.

14:02.982 --> 14:06.084
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the 22nd of April, 2025.

14:08.886 --> 14:16.252
And unfortunately, this long play is about to end because this presentation could be the one that breaks it.

14:16.932 --> 14:31.178
This presentation could be the one that ends this show and takes the power back from these charlatans, or at least starts the landslide of truth that will get these people off stage and allow us to get off of their script.

14:31.678 --> 14:35.280
These charlatans were inherited, ladies and gentlemen, from our parents.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.001
We can't really blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:39.021 --> 14:40.282
for not know what's going on.

14:41.162 --> 14:44.964
I think he is just a player in this theater.

14:45.544 --> 14:48.746
He is hopelessly surrounded by people who are using him.

14:49.826 --> 14:52.148
But we can save ourselves.

14:52.628 --> 15:00.232
And maybe we can even save him and he can finally figure out why his uncle and his father were actually murdered.

15:01.032 --> 15:04.336
Um, your consciousness is their prime real estate.

15:04.456 --> 15:12.383
It's been, it's been Bobby's, Bobby's consciousness has been their prime real estate for many, many, many years.

15:13.244 --> 15:16.587
And that's how we got here, where the true origins of COVID-19

15:17.908 --> 15:22.092
as a lab leak is now a government website for the United States of America.

15:22.572 --> 15:30.698
My country is under attack from people within and if you want to help and you are outside of the United States that's one of the first truths you can start to tell.

15:31.179 --> 15:38.505
Start to tell everybody that America is under attack and the only hope we have is to wake Americans up to it.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.506
And that's what GigaOM Biological wants to do.

15:42.106 --> 15:50.449
I'm gonna try and wake up some Americans with the love and the hope and the truth of biology and the history of it.

15:51.129 --> 15:53.610
There's no way that everybody can avoid GigaOM.

15:53.690 --> 15:57.571
At this point in time, the biology has shown us the way.

15:57.631 --> 16:03.213
And yesterday, a large cognitive stone fell out of the sky and hit me in my brain.

16:03.293 --> 16:04.173
And before you knew it,

16:05.773 --> 16:08.054
I mean, the dark tunnel is over, my friend.

16:08.714 --> 16:10.454
The dark tunnel's coming to an end.

16:10.674 --> 16:12.215
This is GigaOM Biological.

16:12.255 --> 16:17.056
It's a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:19.756 --> 16:24.857
If you want to support the work of GigaOM Biological, please go to gigaombiological.com and find a way to do so.

16:24.897 --> 16:26.518
If you want to get notified of the stream,

16:27.557 --> 16:34.761
Please go to gigaohmhq at proton.me with an email and send that to my wife who will then notify you.

16:34.801 --> 16:38.363
She probably didn't notify you today because she does have dance class these mornings.

16:38.944 --> 16:42.045
And I wasn't sure exactly what I'm going on, but maybe she did too.

16:42.125 --> 16:42.426
I don't know.

16:43.346 --> 16:47.410
And you want to share the stream, please go to stream.gigaom.bio there.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.851
That's our own website.

16:48.951 --> 16:50.592
Mark's archive is also there.

16:51.053 --> 16:56.858
We also have a Batcave there that has some of the videos that we think are important to the history to archive.

16:58.039 --> 17:10.249
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big day because I'm about to explain an idea that I was able to successfully explain to my 12-year-old this morning.

17:11.130 --> 17:15.192
And I think it was kind of, you know, like, wow, really?

17:15.412 --> 17:16.392
Are adults like that?

17:18.693 --> 17:28.258
This is going to be rough because it's also been rough for me to come to really accept that this is true and that I didn't think of it until yesterday.

17:29.598 --> 17:33.220
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you're hearing is the voice of Jonathan J. Cooey.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.441
I'm an independent biologist in

17:36.777 --> 17:37.958
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

17:38.098 --> 17:42.040
I used to be a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

17:42.980 --> 17:49.803
I've got about a 20-year career as a neuroscientist that you can find evidence for on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

17:50.884 --> 17:55.586
I presented three times to Panda, although the contents of those talks

17:56.306 --> 18:00.867
are basically only now available, not on the Panda Rumble channel, of course.

18:01.407 --> 18:15.510
They lost those presentations, but the content of those presentations is largely archived on a substack called Woodhouse 76, which is fraudulently written by a woman by the name of Jessica Hockett in Chicago, Illinois.

18:16.371 --> 18:22.532
She is collaborating with a number of foreigners that include Claire Craig and Jonathan Engler, also associated with

18:23.392 --> 18:27.015
Panda and Heart in the UK and in South Africa.

18:27.535 --> 18:45.548
She's also had some collaboration with Pierre Corey, who was, I'm sure, an insider on this because of his weird relationship to the use of supplementary oxygen, but also because of his ties to the George Floyd medical case.

18:46.168 --> 18:51.312
And finally, again, like I said, she co-writes with a guy by the name of Jonathan Engler.

18:51.372 --> 18:52.193
Most of their work

18:52.933 --> 19:00.854
on the internet is essentially whatever they can glean from my stream and that their handlers deem appropriate for them to try and absorb.

19:01.315 --> 19:06.135
These are two of the worst people on the internet right now, as far as I'm concerned.

19:06.596 --> 19:13.517
These are two people who have interfered with my ability to make a living and protect my family.

19:13.557 --> 19:18.278
And I think, therefore, I often cite Jessica Hockett of Chicago, Illinois.

19:20.058 --> 19:26.322
and Jonathan Engler of the UK, often as people that are directly interfering with my life.

19:26.902 --> 19:42.391
I'm also, I was lucky enough to work for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the current Health and Human Services Secretary and former General President and Counsel of Children's Health Defense, write the Wuhan cover-up book.

19:42.991 --> 19:45.513
I am cited in there and, you know, you can find lots of stuff in there.

19:45.533 --> 19:49.175
I'm also good friends with Jay Bhattacharya, a guy who is now the

19:49.949 --> 19:58.854
the head of the NIH, and their friend Kevin McCarran came to visit me, actually, in 2022 to my house in Pittsburgh.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.175
So these people are all on stage together.

20:01.195 --> 20:03.557
You cannot change their script, okay?

20:04.017 --> 20:09.600
That's a message that I want to make clear, and that's why I think it's so important.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.601
Let me just switch over here.

20:10.641 --> 20:11.241
I apologize.

20:11.301 --> 20:12.262
I should have done that a while ago.

20:13.227 --> 20:14.388
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

20:14.408 --> 20:15.389
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

20:15.409 --> 20:16.150
Welcome to the show.

20:16.970 --> 20:21.494
This is Gigaohm Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by me.

20:21.995 --> 20:23.856
It is the 22nd of April 2025.

20:24.497 --> 20:30.141
I just want to make clear that, you know, it's taken a long time for me to

20:30.942 --> 20:34.805
pull my head out of the swamp of anger that I've been in.

20:34.845 --> 20:39.268
And I feel sometimes like I should apologize.

20:39.308 --> 20:54.140
A lot of times people make me feel like I should apologize for being angry that people have lied to me, that people have misrepresented my ideas as their own over a five-year period.

20:55.361 --> 20:56.982
I feel like it's weird.

20:58.503 --> 21:03.146
It feels oftentimes like people portray it as though I don't have a reason to be angry.

21:04.627 --> 21:19.117
I think if you are aware of how many ways people are being poisoned and how many ways pregnant women and small children are being specifically poisoned, then there's reason to be angry.

21:19.957 --> 21:28.364
And there's reason for there to be frustration when you have put years of your life into trying to join that fight.

21:29.625 --> 21:35.369
Because there is a fight, and it is often called an anti-vax fight or a health freedom movement fight.

21:35.869 --> 21:43.495
And if you try to join that movement and you're successful in joining it, you will find out what I've found out, which is that it is fake.

21:44.605 --> 21:55.031
There are no genuine players in the health freedom movement that are not co-opted and participating in this lie.

21:55.472 --> 22:05.398
And today, I am going to teach you an idea that is so simple, it will reveal how impossible it is that I'm wrong.

22:06.178 --> 22:12.062
I can't be wrong about the fake anti-vax movement if this simple idea makes sense to you.

22:12.990 --> 22:20.775
So I'm going to make quite a preface here because I think it's that important to bring everybody to the same page and then just kind of mic drop it.

22:22.076 --> 22:22.736
And we'll be done.

22:22.756 --> 22:25.818
I don't know how much more work will have to happen.

22:25.858 --> 22:28.940
All you'll have to do is watch this idea be ignored.

22:29.660 --> 22:42.548
Watch its simplicity be ignored, much in the same way that other ideas that I've presented over the last couple of years, very simple, very precise, and very thoroughly ignored.

22:43.806 --> 22:48.989
Not unlike what Brandy Vaughn experienced with her interaction with these same people.

22:49.429 --> 22:51.750
And so this message is not for everyone.

22:51.810 --> 22:53.511
Not everybody's gonna be happy with it.

22:53.571 --> 22:55.392
I understand that.

22:55.472 --> 22:56.532
That's just the way it is.

22:56.652 --> 22:59.254
But GigaOM is about the truth.

22:59.414 --> 23:01.495
I am really serious about finding the truth.

23:01.555 --> 23:03.676
I'm not screwing around here.

23:03.836 --> 23:09.319
As soon as I find it and people accept it, my work will move on and I'll go on to teaching

23:09.919 --> 23:13.180
biology to high school kids, and nobody has to bother with me anymore.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.781
But this is for all the marbles.

23:15.841 --> 23:17.201
It is for the children of Earth.

23:17.281 --> 23:19.822
It is about enslaving future generations.

23:19.902 --> 23:29.984
And it's very easy to talk about that and talk about it safely without actually explaining how it is and what their objectives are.

23:30.024 --> 23:31.505
And that's one of the things that I think

23:32.285 --> 23:34.927
Understanding biology allows you to see very easy.

23:34.947 --> 23:47.937
I have spent five years trying to explain how it is that murder and lies using an anticipated rise in all cause mortality could be used to create the illusion of a pandemic and I've

23:48.517 --> 23:50.739
been focusing on a few key issues.

23:50.839 --> 24:09.814
One of the things that's not on this list right here would be the opioid crisis that has gone on for five years and taken out an innumerable number of people throughout the age spectrum, which has contributed to an effect that everybody wants us to believe is solely due to a novel virus and our sort of silly responses to it.

24:11.007 --> 24:14.392
And this story is essentially what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:14.432 --> 24:25.548
and all the people that are pushing him forward as the leader, as the front man, all those people are united in their seemingly

24:27.057 --> 24:47.595
seamless goal of making sure that people never realize that Americans very specifically, can't really put my hand, I'm not a weatherman, Americans very specifically were murdered for almost two years straight by a few basic changes in the way that we treat pneumonia and other bacterial infections.

24:49.136 --> 24:54.681
How we treat people when they come into the hospital, how we use supplementary oxygen,

24:56.767 --> 24:59.768
and how we count and pay attention to opioid deaths.

24:59.828 --> 25:07.049
This is all part of these murder and lies which have been misconstrued as obviously there was a novel virus.

25:07.129 --> 25:11.810
It killed millions of people, but millions more were saved, and there probably will be another one.

25:12.130 --> 25:12.990
Maybe bird flu.

25:13.290 --> 25:16.070
That's why 60 Minutes says it's bird flu coming next.

25:18.131 --> 25:23.352
And so these murder and lies, I believe, are being covered up by a fake anti-vaccine movement.

25:23.532 --> 25:24.392
I've come to...

25:25.506 --> 25:27.309
Think of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:27.370 --> 25:36.346
as not sophisticated enough to understand that he's part of a fake anti-vax movement because he believes that vaccines also save people.

25:37.096 --> 25:40.477
He believes that it's possible that they also do good.

25:40.537 --> 25:42.918
Maybe some of them do good and some of them don't.

25:43.378 --> 25:46.699
He's not sophisticated enough to sort all of this out.

25:47.199 --> 25:57.642
And because he's surrounded by people who have not been ever motivated to help him sort it out, to sort it out for future generations, then that's why we are still here.

25:57.702 --> 25:58.922
But where are we?

25:59.941 --> 26:00.521
Exactly.

26:01.181 --> 26:02.682
Where have they brought us?

26:02.782 --> 26:09.484
Because that's what I have been unable to succinctly codify until recently.

26:09.524 --> 26:16.987
And when I tried to do it in my head the other day while listening to Paul Offit, something just, it was like getting hit by a two by four.

26:18.971 --> 26:20.752
So they've made no progress.

26:21.412 --> 26:22.332
I say that a lot.

26:23.813 --> 26:33.777
I think it's really important to understand that they've made no progress despite being on this frontline, you know, against this war on humanity for more than a decade.

26:33.857 --> 26:42.941
People like Mary Holland and Polly Tommy, who's been for 20 years on this fight, have not made any useful progress.

26:42.981 --> 26:44.202
But what does that really mean?

26:46.394 --> 26:49.115
What does it really mean to not make any progress?

26:50.256 --> 27:00.581
That's really what this message is today because if you can see their message and you can see where they were in like, let's say 2015 or 2018 or 2009 and see where they are now,

27:06.345 --> 27:08.926
you can see very clearly that they haven't progressed at all.

27:08.986 --> 27:15.668
And that's a message of hope because that means that the illusion requires our participation to sustain.

27:16.388 --> 27:23.030
That means that they are ignoring transfection in healthy humans because it is a crime.

27:23.790 --> 27:34.574
Just like I said, very succinctly to the FDA ACIP committee in June of 2022, and then sent that video to all of these people.

27:35.424 --> 27:38.745
Transfection, transfection, transfection, transfection, transfection.

27:41.886 --> 27:47.548
RNA cannot pandemic is also probably true and that's the reason why they are ignoring it.

27:47.648 --> 27:53.170
Even the no virus people are ignoring this clever little phrase because it's probably true.

27:54.831 --> 27:56.512
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

27:56.572 --> 28:02.874
Another pretty clever little phrase that all these no virus people and all these anti-vax people could just adopt.

28:04.699 --> 28:05.980
Steal it, please.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.681
Don't give me any credit.

28:07.721 --> 28:19.948
Just say intramuscular injection is dumb, or try to challenge other doctors to argue in favor of intramuscular injection in the case of X, Y, and Z, and see if they can do it.

28:20.488 --> 28:21.348
But no one will.

28:22.169 --> 28:25.511
No one will, ladies and gentlemen, because the truth is right there.

28:28.959 --> 28:35.241
Intramuscular injection is dumb, especially if it's a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a healthy immune system.

28:35.301 --> 28:47.244
I mean, that is... Transfection and transformation are old technologies, old names that have been used on the academic bench for many years.

28:47.324 --> 28:52.465
And all of these people that are in front of us now, curiously enough, probably knew that already.

28:53.266 --> 28:57.667
And probably pretended not to hear me when I was saying it like, dudes,

28:59.346 --> 29:00.367
RNA cannot pandemic.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.868
That one's a funny one.

29:01.888 --> 29:03.028
They all got to stay away from it.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.209
Here's another way to say it.

29:04.870 --> 29:10.053
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

29:10.633 --> 29:22.141
So... So... They created a mythology about autism spectrum disorder.

29:25.066 --> 29:31.948
And I think Brian Hooker in 2013 knew that, and that's why in that interview that we listened to, he said he doesn't use the word autism.

29:32.869 --> 29:36.450
His son was injured by intramuscular injection, or he still said vaccines.

29:37.810 --> 29:45.133
But if he was real precise, he would have said, I don't use the word autism because my son was injured by intramuscular injection.

29:45.413 --> 29:46.833
Ah, done.

29:48.614 --> 29:49.654
This is it right here.

29:49.694 --> 29:51.755
This is the truth, but this is not the idea

29:52.881 --> 29:53.441
that ends it.

29:53.521 --> 29:56.983
This is what I've been saying for about two and a half years now.

29:57.083 --> 30:00.525
So don't get excited if you think, oh wow, I guess he's not going to really end anything.

30:00.565 --> 30:13.392
No, I got something that is better than probably anything that I've ever done up until now in the sense of the impact that it has to have both on Paul Offit and on Mary Holland.

30:14.332 --> 30:17.974
Both on Tony Fauci and on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:18.655 --> 30:21.216
Both on Vincent Racaniello and

30:22.918 --> 30:23.699
Mary Holland.

30:25.780 --> 30:35.408
Either side of the equation could have produced the idea that I'm about to give to you and it would have solved the problem from their own perspective.

30:35.548 --> 30:37.750
It would have been check, checkmate.

30:39.792 --> 30:48.279
I wanna give you enough time in this prelude to come up with the idea yourself because it's that simple.

30:49.286 --> 30:55.732
It's so simple, it's frustrating, but they've been casting an enchantment on you by the words that they use and the people that use them.

30:56.593 --> 31:01.517
And that has resulted in us being unable to see the way out of the trap.

31:02.779 --> 31:05.161
That's why it took me five years to get here.

31:07.910 --> 31:16.916
The US vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.600
That is the way a lawyer should argue.

31:22.941 --> 31:27.704
A lawyer should not be arguing about mandates and whether they are constitutional.

31:27.764 --> 31:34.667
A lawyer should not be arguing about whether choice or exemption is something that we should fight about.

31:34.767 --> 31:38.850
No, a lawyer should be arguing very specifically that the U.S.

31:38.890 --> 31:47.915
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

31:47.955 --> 31:48.395
Do you see it?

31:50.134 --> 31:56.518
And that's why there are lawyers like Aaron Seery and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:56.598 --> 32:02.642
who cannot enunciate that when the United States government suspends fundamental rights, they should be held to strict scrutiny.

32:07.585 --> 32:11.768
Play that clip for any lawyer that pretends that they're playing this game.

32:13.507 --> 32:32.138
And if they look at you goofy like Bobby Ann Cox from the Brownstone Institute looked at me goofy last November when I said it to her face, or that Mendel Hall lawyer, though I also said it to his face and he looked at me goofy, you know that they are playing for this team.

32:33.766 --> 32:39.568
the same team that's protecting the US vaccine schedule from reasonable scrutiny around the world.

32:40.008 --> 32:46.430
So that everybody would see that the American public is captive to a traitorous government.

32:47.510 --> 32:56.153
And the evidence is the criminal vaccine schedule in America and its near exponential expansion over the last 30 years of my adult life.

32:56.213 --> 32:57.513
This is unacceptable.

32:59.369 --> 33:05.932
And instead of coming to our rescue, it seems like our allies are being egged on to blame us.

33:07.993 --> 33:19.299
Egged on to attack America instead of save America's people from their rogue government that has been infiltrated by traitors.

33:21.437 --> 33:26.401
And if you learn the biology, then we can chase down the people who should have known better.

33:26.441 --> 33:28.922
And if many of them are Americans, so be it.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.344
But David Hone's not an American.

33:31.704 --> 33:33.446
Sina Bavari's not an American.

33:33.586 --> 33:35.267
Jessica Rose is an American.

33:36.208 --> 33:38.009
Denny Rancor is not an American.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.434
Andrew Wakefield is not an American.

33:45.514 --> 33:47.476
Peter Daszak is not an American.

33:49.841 --> 33:51.743
Pauly Tommy's not an American.

33:54.805 --> 33:58.028
The unfortunate thing is, is that they've gotten away with a lot, all right?

33:58.088 --> 33:59.289
They've gotten away with a lot.

33:59.369 --> 34:08.918
The FDA has already basically approved all forms of PCR as a diagnostic, and that means that they have produced a remnant stream.

34:09.018 --> 34:17.806
Leftover tests are DNA samples, and those DNA samples can be sold to the highest bidder, and they are.

34:18.840 --> 34:28.183
More importantly, the DNA samples that were collected in this way from the university students in 2020, 21, and 22 were most certainly sold.

34:30.143 --> 34:34.384
And we're running out of time to go back and hold those people accountable, you know.

34:37.445 --> 34:38.586
Don't wanna look back.

34:38.686 --> 34:42.967
We wouldn't wanna look back, figure out how the crime was committed.

34:43.027 --> 34:46.788
No, now they have control of the FDA and the FDA is gonna get fixed.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.262
but it's never going to question the use of PCR as a diagnostic again.

34:52.342 --> 34:53.803
I can guarantee you that.

34:54.844 --> 35:00.148
I guarantee you they will never question the use of PCR as a diagnostic again.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.909
And that's really a problem.

35:03.270 --> 35:08.033
And this was accomplished by Team Worst Case Scenario, all these people that I've put on the screen.

35:10.114 --> 35:14.037
I am desperate for someone to see this and understand it for the full

35:17.230 --> 35:24.332
the full expose it is because now the vaccine schedule is going to escape real scrutiny.

35:25.453 --> 35:31.395
And instead, the scrutiny will be focused on the mRNA, which can be improved if we just personalize it.

35:37.117 --> 35:37.937
Now, thank you very much.

35:38.894 --> 35:49.342
Now the important thing for you to see is that the transfection was already in place as a potential personalized vaccine.

35:49.382 --> 35:51.363
They've been doing it for cancer for years.

35:51.423 --> 36:00.029
They even tried it on Jesse Gelsinger and they do it with immune cells for the sickle cell anemia cures and these other things that they're doing.

36:00.069 --> 36:06.614
But these are not the augmentation of healthy humans.

36:08.857 --> 36:19.948
And in no way, shape or form, if you can change the starter on a motorcycle, does that mean you're capable of designing a race motorcycle or diagnosing the problems in one?

36:23.234 --> 36:39.622
And in the case of these applications, that's never been, it's never been, but they, they are going to replace the old vaccine schedule that they will say is part of this, this bouquet of causes of the autism epidemic or the chronic disease epidemic.

36:44.064 --> 36:46.605
But both sides of the story have been lying to you.

36:46.645 --> 36:47.586
That's the crazy part.

36:48.886 --> 36:52.288
Both sides of the story have been on a script and I can show you why.

36:53.874 --> 37:03.677
I can show you what they all seem to have been too focused to come up with, too smart to come up with.

37:05.097 --> 37:10.579
Please, if you're joining me for the first time, I want to explain that the pandemic is not what you were told.

37:11.279 --> 37:14.680
This is the data from 2013 all the way to 2025 of all cause mortality in America.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.900
And it is somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 people dying every week.

37:25.717 --> 37:33.341
And if I briefly remove my head here, the bright red is the pneumonia deaths per week.

37:33.401 --> 37:39.964
And you can see very clearly, if you look at my arrow here, that we've had this under control for many years.

37:40.044 --> 37:42.986
And at the beginning of 2020, we lost control of it.

37:43.706 --> 37:54.772
The primary reason we lost control of it is because we stopped using antibiotics to treat pneumonia because we started telling everybody that this was a viral pneumonia for which antibiotics would be inappropriate.

37:57.122 --> 38:21.672
And because there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, they knew that we were having an excess of old people, and they were doing everything they could to save those old people in 2016, and 17, and 18, and 19, and making sure that they didn't die of pneumonia by giving them antibiotics when appropriate, maybe even giving them IV antibiotics if the pneumonia went septic.

38:21.692 --> 38:24.113
But in 2020, they stopped doing that.

38:27.537 --> 38:32.498
They even sent people back to old folks' homes with pneumonia and didn't give them anything at all.

38:33.499 --> 38:55.725
And so that drastic change in addressing just one very common cause of death of old people created an extra abundance of old people that then when that switch was flipped in New York and elsewhere in America, they could scream and yell about it around the world as look at what's happening because Donald Trump isn't closing down.

38:56.585 --> 39:05.169
Look how safe we are here in places like Australia or Japan or New Zealand where they wore masks or they locked down harder.

39:07.671 --> 39:13.954
And that was the story that everyone in front of us now was put in place to tell already in 2020.

39:14.894 --> 39:21.938
This anticipated rise in expected deaths was sculpted using murder and sophisticated lies.

39:23.632 --> 39:26.753
to create the myth of an RNA pandemic.

39:26.793 --> 39:28.153
We are all victims of it.

39:29.154 --> 39:31.574
Left and right, everyone.

39:34.115 --> 39:42.097
But most important to see is that they took advantage of something that was biologically obvious and inevitable decades ago.

39:42.917 --> 39:49.859
That even people like Ted Turner were on TV talking about how this little bump right here is gonna bankrupt social security.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.520
It's just math.

39:54.093 --> 39:56.334
And so this was a problem that had to be dealt with.

39:56.354 --> 39:59.276
This was a problem that was shared across the Western world.

40:00.757 --> 40:13.584
And because it's for all the marbles, they put people in place on regular media and social media to lie about this biological phenomenon and twist it into the mythology that we have now accepted as pandemics happen.

40:14.485 --> 40:15.425
They just happened.

40:15.725 --> 40:17.626
They ruined my kid's graduation.

40:18.007 --> 40:22.189
My kid's college was really not the same because of the COVID.

40:27.392 --> 40:32.399
But this is about all the grandchildren of Earth and that's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

40:33.941 --> 40:42.772
And it's a fake anti-vax movement that had to be in place years before the military operation that was COVID could be executed.

40:43.601 --> 40:55.373
before the military control of the narrative could be turned on, the people had to be put in place, the players had to be put in place, and the script had to be ready to go.

40:55.773 --> 40:58.136
And that's why they haven't made any progress.

40:58.176 --> 40:59.077
So just to review

40:59.617 --> 41:19.184
Some of the people that are involved in the fake anti-vax movement that's primarily opposed to mandates, but doesn't have any specifics about the biology that advocates for free speech and free choice, even if it is killing your kid or causing autism, you should have the choice to do or the freedom to do it and advocates for safe vaccines.

41:19.244 --> 41:25.947
And lots of them say it, and that's just wrong because that belies a lack of understanding of the biology.

41:28.925 --> 41:40.256
So I've been trying to beat the dead horse over and over again for five years by trying to retrace the history of these people back to 2020 to see what they said and see what they knew.

41:40.697 --> 41:41.738
Did they know too much?

41:42.258 --> 41:45.482
Were they sure about something that they should have never been sure about?

41:46.852 --> 41:48.653
Did they stay sure about that until 2021?

41:49.434 --> 41:51.296
Or did they focus on new things?

41:51.336 --> 41:52.937
Did their understanding grow?

41:53.417 --> 42:10.090
By 2022, had they come to understand what some of the lies were, were they still pushing the spike protein or the fear and cleavage site or amyloidosis or prion disease that they already were pushing in 2020?

42:11.151 --> 42:15.795
And once you see it from a three-year perspective, it's easier to see someone's on a script

42:17.148 --> 42:33.375
It's easier to see that someone seems to be sticking to these ideas, and especially if you realize that in those three years, they were interacting with me, arguing with me, even opposing me on social media.

42:34.555 --> 42:37.576
And now we are six years in.

42:38.957 --> 42:45.980
Six years in, ladies and gentlemen, and someone like Brandy Vaughn, who is now dead, God rest her soul,

42:49.332 --> 43:11.377
was able to progress from being a skeptic of the work of her employer Merck on Vioxx to explaining to people the huge difference between ingestion versus injection and why they should take this biological difference into account when thinking about vaccines as possibly okay.

43:14.598 --> 43:15.298
She progressed.

43:16.607 --> 43:25.592
She went from being a skeptic with little knowledge to building an understanding which she could summarize in three words, and that was a mom with an unvaccinated child.

43:27.713 --> 43:29.434
She dedicated her whole life to it.

43:30.055 --> 43:35.158
Her name is Brandy Vaughn, and her organization is learntherisk.org.

43:36.679 --> 43:39.340
Compare that to Brian Hooker, who in 2013, that's right, 2013,

43:46.358 --> 43:53.344
10 years after Newsweek already was teaching us about what autism was and that maybe it affects boys more than girls.

43:54.144 --> 43:55.505
This is 2003.

43:55.545 --> 44:06.113
10 years later, a guy by the name of Brian Hooker with 16 years of experience genetically modifying plants, transforming and transfecting is what that would be.

44:06.133 --> 44:13.599
He doesn't wanna use the word autism to describe his injured son because he doesn't really, they don't use that word.

44:14.815 --> 44:17.016
implying that autism is kind of bullshit.

44:17.976 --> 44:21.178
And he knows it's bullshit because his son doesn't have autism.

44:21.218 --> 44:24.959
He was injured by an injection or many injections on the same day.

44:27.260 --> 44:30.942
And questions the rationale of vaccination in general in 2013.

44:32.182 --> 44:41.506
And now that guy, Brian Hooker, is at the forefront of this health and health freedom movement right behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:43.197 --> 44:52.405
and was unable to call out the investigational vaccines as transfections, even though he had 16 years of experience transfecting plants.

44:54.527 --> 45:09.481
And instead was completely on Tony Fauci's narrative at the beginning of 2020, talking about asymptomatic transmission, the relevance of antibodies for immunity, and whether or not these vaccines have been thoroughly enough tested to be rolled out.

45:11.172 --> 45:21.319
the exact debate that they wanted us on, the exact hamster wheel they wanted us in, and he was even doing a callback with another doctor in the chat.

45:23.021 --> 45:37.793
And he has shown no integrity over these last 10 years because he met Brandy Vaughn, he was on stage with Brandy Vaughn, he made a couple movies with Brandy Vaughn, he knows exactly the progress that Brandy Vaughn made from 2015 to 2018 because he was already there in 2013.

45:43.197 --> 45:53.303
But somehow or another, after meeting Brandy Vaughn, and hearing her story, and hearing her talks, and being in movies with her, being the producer of the movies that she's been in,

45:54.537 --> 46:16.795
Brian Hooker has never been able to adopt the ingestion versus injection thing, never been able to succinctly explain why people should definitely consider it differently than any other pharmaceutical product, never bothered to try and get people to compare the childhood vaccine schedule in America to any other vaccine schedule in the Western world, the developed world.

46:17.535 --> 46:25.020
But instead, at the beginning of the pandemic, was completely focused on making sure that people understood that there definitely was a novel virus.

46:25.640 --> 46:29.883
The PCR worked to find it, that they were just exaggerating stuff.

46:31.604 --> 46:38.508
And there's no mention of Brandy's death, despite it happening two weeks before he did this performance.

46:39.709 --> 46:40.670
Could have just mentioned her

46:46.785 --> 46:52.132
And in 2025, he's still right there in the freedom anti-vax movement, building a big top tent to nowhere.

46:53.482 --> 47:04.325
I can't come to any other conclusion because he's been my boss for like six months, had children's health defense and didn't learn a damn thing from me, actually pretended to not know what the word transfection meant.

47:04.365 --> 47:12.027
And that's gotta be a lie because in 2013 on a radio program, he said he had 16 years experience genetically modifying plants.

47:12.567 --> 47:19.149
The only way you can genetically modify plants to make them grow medicine for you is to transfect or transform them.

47:22.731 --> 47:23.752
So Brian Hooker knew.

47:25.592 --> 47:34.157
Brian Hooker knew and probably was told to keep his mouth shut because we got to get Bobby in the White House first and then we'll win.

47:35.037 --> 47:42.081
And he was probably told that by Mary Holland and maybe even Meryl Nass and Bobby Kennedy himself.

47:45.482 --> 47:47.503
I don't know, but I know it's fake.

47:48.204 --> 47:50.085
It's not possible that

47:51.207 --> 47:53.509
Autism is on Newsweek in 2003.

47:54.590 --> 48:03.116
10 years later, Brian Hooker, a father of an autistic child says that he doesn't use the word autism because that's not what his son has.

48:03.856 --> 48:08.620
His son is neurologically injured by vaccination that he doesn't really believe it.

48:11.291 --> 48:22.118
And why would somebody like a guy with 16 years experience transforming plants ever be in front of a fake anti-vax movement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:22.658 --> 48:23.499
and Mary Holland?

48:23.519 --> 48:25.460
Well, it's because of the Human Genome Project.

48:27.722 --> 48:37.008
It's because it's a national security priority that we turn the American population into the most useful experimental population ever.

48:38.820 --> 48:40.781
The Chinese have already done it to their people.

48:40.861 --> 48:41.842
So we're way behind.

48:42.402 --> 48:46.065
The Chinese are already collecting our data despite our best efforts.

48:46.105 --> 48:50.308
The Chinese may already have the entire database of 23andMe for all we know.

48:50.748 --> 48:51.689
We're in big trouble.

48:51.729 --> 48:52.529
We're way behind.

48:53.050 --> 48:54.171
So we need your help.

48:56.332 --> 48:59.834
We need to get people to understand public health in a different way.

48:59.874 --> 49:03.457
We need to get people to think about their data in a different way.

49:05.356 --> 49:17.108
And so they enlisted people like Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and Mary Holland to enlist people like Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:17.688 --> 49:24.435
and Suzanne Humphreys and all these other people to get us right where we are now.

49:26.617 --> 49:27.898
Exactly where they want us.

49:28.855 --> 49:33.258
ready to be harvested, or more importantly, our children are right where they want them.

49:33.298 --> 49:40.924
Because it's very easy, I'm sure, for you to imagine a world where all of our children have a chip, an Apple chip.

49:42.505 --> 49:49.891
And it's really handy because, you know, then I can just, I can have access to my email anywhere I go or whatever the argument is.

49:53.527 --> 49:56.489
They only have one time in history to gather this.

49:56.569 --> 49:58.610
So they have put people in place.

49:58.751 --> 50:16.262
They have created mythologies to the extent to even creating the mythological backing in the scientific literature so that they can justify the turning of Americans into experimental animals.

50:16.483 --> 50:18.344
And it's probably mostly done already.

50:19.940 --> 50:26.845
because PCR is being used, because the health system has been hijacked, and because all these laws are in place, all these people are in place.

50:28.267 --> 50:43.038
And so the next stage can be more malevolent, because they have even more people in place that are willing to protect transfection from scrutiny, that are willing to testify, yeah, it's a novel virus.

50:43.078 --> 50:43.999
Of course, it's true.

50:44.019 --> 50:44.880
I mean,

50:47.725 --> 50:53.647
There's no other explanation that fits so well and puts all these pieces of the puzzle together.

50:54.928 --> 50:56.788
These are not freedom organizations.

50:56.828 --> 50:58.909
These are controlled opposition.

51:00.009 --> 51:02.330
Heart, Panda, the wellness company.

51:03.191 --> 51:09.853
And that's what I've been trying to teach everybody for so long by showing how these people have interacted with each other over five years.

51:10.748 --> 51:16.392
It is, hey theater, they are on stage together and they make you feel as though you're a part of the script.

51:16.752 --> 51:21.315
They might even do a little improvising if you say something particularly clever.

51:21.976 --> 51:27.139
But in the end, it's their script, it's given to them and the next act is the next act.

51:27.159 --> 51:38.868
Hello everyone and welcome to Street MD versus- So I showed this video yesterday and I think I made, or the day before, and I think I made very clear why it's so important to see how

51:39.986 --> 51:52.889
Handy Kaufman and Tom Cowan and Mark Bailey interact with a video that this host made of Robert Malone and Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough.

51:54.409 --> 51:56.669
They are two sides of the same team.

51:57.370 --> 52:01.410
It is a theater, and if that podcaster doesn't know, that's okay.

52:02.351 --> 52:03.951
But Mark and Sam Bailey

52:05.262 --> 52:21.516
Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan are all part of this same group of people that is on a script that was probably curated by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, because those are the two guys with the most sophisticated understanding of the mythology.

52:22.250 --> 52:35.613
the mythology of RNA pandemics, the mythology of public health equals transfection, that we can sequence things in the background to a great and high fidelity resolution.

52:35.873 --> 52:43.695
That's all they are there for in making sure that people have the semantic weaponry to fight somebody like me.

52:44.855 --> 52:50.837
And so I think it's really important to go back and watch that video if you haven't seen it because I wiped

52:51.877 --> 53:00.210
the metaphorical floor with the idea that the no virus people are there with good intention.

53:00.250 --> 53:02.834
It's impossible to explain how

53:04.983 --> 53:19.951
They could say the words that they were saying in any of these videos and be actually trying to break free, actually trying to help Americans see the truth of their government, actually trying to help Americans see the mythology.

53:20.011 --> 53:20.471
No, no, no.

53:20.511 --> 53:27.355
They are perpetuating the same mythology that people like Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak are there to perpetuate.

53:30.976 --> 53:33.898
And that mythology is a mythology where bacteria

53:34.918 --> 53:57.747
and archaebacteria, or however you want to call archaea, and all of the other life forms of that size are completely ignored, as well as the phages, the viruses, the genetic communication that occurs between them is completely ignored as a background.

53:57.847 --> 54:04.069
And instead, we're supposed to believe their story about virology, and that's why they're there.

54:06.451 --> 54:15.398
Now, it is impossible to explain this more succinctly by just challenging you to go look at the Weston A. Price Foundation.

54:16.539 --> 54:33.173
On the Weston A. Price Foundation, you will see that their board of directors or whoever that, whatever the hell you call it, includes Tom Cowan, and honorary members include Suzanne Humphreys and Stephanie Seneff.

54:34.656 --> 54:40.481
Now remember, Stephanie Seneff and Suzanne Humphries are two people that are sure that viruses exist.

54:43.683 --> 54:45.424
They might even make you healthier.

54:47.026 --> 54:55.792
Why, as this guy is a guy who says that there are no viruses, no diseases caused by viruses, and they're all part of the same foundation.

54:58.554 --> 55:01.737
But they're supposedly on opposite sides of this battle.

55:08.393 --> 55:16.300
Your consciousness has always been their prime real estate, ladies and gentlemen, and there's no easy way to get to this.

55:17.140 --> 55:17.841
There really isn't.

55:20.403 --> 55:29.851
It is with great trepidation that I, it is with great trepidation that I teach this next idea.

55:43.917 --> 55:48.740
Ladies and gentlemen, please, if you can, go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support this work.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.981
I really do want to write this in a book.

55:51.021 --> 55:57.425
I do also want to produce a Biology 101 book and course, and that's my main thing that I'm doing in the background right now.

55:58.365 --> 55:59.226
So thank you very much.

55:59.286 --> 56:00.686
Remember, they're all in a script together.

56:00.727 --> 56:01.447
You can't change it.

56:03.365 --> 56:12.208
So the idea is, is that Trump has installed heroes at the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, the HHS, and autism is real.

56:12.308 --> 56:13.268
Parents wanna know.

56:14.568 --> 56:17.429
And let's see if we can get just an idea of where we are in 2025.

56:18.310 --> 56:19.250
Come see us on tour.

56:19.270 --> 56:31.914
We're gonna be in Bakersfield, San Jose, California, Buffalo, New York, Toledo, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Glasgow, Manchester, Belfast, Dublin, Liverpool, Birmingham, and London.

56:31.954 --> 56:33.014
Go to JimmyDoe.com.

56:33.294 --> 56:34.255
for a link for tickets

56:50.196 --> 57:09.261
If you watch the news, you would never think it would be Donald Trump would be the guy to come and get the corruption out from our regulatory bodies called the FDA and the CDC and the NIH and put in actual competent truth-tellers like Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, RFK Jr.

57:09.981 --> 57:10.861
and- Dr. Oz.

57:11.161 --> 57:17.143
And Dr. Marty Makary, which I'm going to show you right now, who's the new head of the FDA.

57:17.763 --> 57:20.724
and it's not Joe Rogan it's not people like me it's not randos on social media

57:37.629 --> 57:39.331
It's not Dr. Robert Malone.

57:39.391 --> 57:41.014
It's the government was lying to you.

57:41.094 --> 57:43.597
And you had the courage to stand up and say it.

57:44.137 --> 57:45.259
And so here he is.

57:45.299 --> 57:45.679
He did it.

57:46.821 --> 57:48.163
So it's the new FDA.

57:48.763 --> 57:51.427
So first of all, let's just make sure we're very clear.

57:51.507 --> 57:53.950
Marty McCarty told people to take the shot.

57:54.935 --> 57:57.717
And apparently Jimmy Dore doesn't give a shit about that.

57:57.817 --> 58:00.520
He's just sure that Marty McCarty got COVID right.

58:01.240 --> 58:10.808
And that is pretty slimy because Jimmy Dore supposedly is a guy who was injured by a shot and that's the whole reason why he woke up because he got injured himself.

58:12.569 --> 58:13.570
So it's pretty gross.

58:14.511 --> 58:19.395
It's pretty gross because, yeah, it's pretty gross, but I'm gonna let it play.

58:20.100 --> 58:40.557
chair who's serving under RFK Jr., and he's from Johns Hopkins University, surgeon, and here he is, he's talking about taking on the autism epidemic, and it's got a real interesting connection to gut health and biome, and I wanted to run past you, but let me play this for you and get your reaction.

58:40.958 --> 58:46.622
Dr. Kennedy said this week that we are going to know what causes autism by September.

58:47.203 --> 58:47.924
Is that crazy talk?

58:48.885 --> 58:53.587
Now, people wanna know, a lot of parents have been dealing with kids with autism.

58:53.887 --> 58:58.089
I mean, one in 32 kids in America today have autism.

58:58.309 --> 59:13.076
So now a guy from Johns Hopkins, you know, that place that gave us the map with all the red dots, Johns Hopkins is now gonna tell us that autism is real, that those parents are dealing with a real thing.

59:15.114 --> 59:17.395
We can't just keep medicating every kid.

59:17.495 --> 59:19.116
It was one in 10,000 in the 90s.

59:19.637 --> 59:27.001
It was unheard of, and the sort of repetitive motions, the ticks, the heavy, the complete nonverbal chop.

59:27.482 --> 59:30.924
Where did you see that in the 1940s and 50s?

59:31.104 --> 59:33.605
See, that's the same script as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:33.625 --> 59:34.786
has been on for a while.

59:35.767 --> 59:37.728
Where did you see that in the 30s and the 40s and the 50s?

59:37.768 --> 59:38.228
It's remarkable.

59:44.235 --> 59:46.056
And so we have to look at everything.

59:46.076 --> 59:54.140
And when you do science, you can't say, hey, we're going to do a study of what is causing this epidemic affecting 1 in 32 kids.

59:54.940 --> 59:59.422
But when you can't look at these potential causes, that's not how science is done.

59:59.442 --> 01:00:00.142
That's what we've been saying.

01:00:00.162 --> 01:00:07.706
And for the record, you're not saying it, but people are talking in part about vaccines, because Kennedy has said it should be on the list of things we look at.

01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:11.148
Now, his critics will say he's blaming it all on the vaccine.

01:00:11.188 --> 01:00:12.529
He's blaming autism on the vaccine.

01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:13.430
I've talked to him personally.

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:14.190
That's not what he says.

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:15.091
It's not what he's saying at all.

01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:17.052
He says they're growing up in a toxic stew.

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:22.095
That's one of the many things, and in particular, like, the aluminum that they put in it as a preservative.

01:00:22.416 --> 01:00:25.278
Like, we should be looking at everything they're consuming, and we're forcing on them.

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:25.998
Keep going.

01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:30.381
I don't know what causes autism, but I'm deeply concerned about the rise.

01:00:30.521 --> 01:00:35.865
If I had to make a hypothesis as a scientist, not as a regulator, but as a scientist,

01:00:36.565 --> 01:00:42.232
And Dr. Bhattacharya is going to be launching a very impressive study using electronic health big data that we're helping curate.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:55.049
cumulative burden of all of these exposures, environmental and dietary, that alter the microbiome.

01:00:55.589 --> 01:01:02.192
Remember, 90% of the... Now remember that microbiome is a term that was coined by Joshua Lederberg.

01:01:02.232 --> 01:01:10.595
And actually, I think Joshua Lederberg's biggest contribution to my understanding, and sort of new

01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:21.057
vision of biology 101 for my kids is his statement about it being unclear where to draw the lines of the individual.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:41.111
When you understand what the microbiome is, and when you understand what, you know, symbiotic symbiosis in cell evolution means, what mitochondria might actually be, then you can start to see where drawing the line of the where the

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:47.356
individual starts and ends actually is probably not where we draw it right now.

01:01:48.497 --> 01:02:09.993
And there is one thing that you can see from Andrew Wakefield all the way to the fake Sabine Hazan, that they've always had to have a gut person involved because they always had to have somebody there to control the narrative to make sure that nobody ever mentioned payers patches.

01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:32.688
that nobody ever mentions what happens every night in payers' patches, to make sure that no one ever understands that the most abundant biological genetic entity at the size scale of what everyone calls viruses are actually bacteriophages of many different types, not just the Lunar Lander T-Phage type.

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:40.212
Many of them are round and are indistinguishable under electron microscope from what they would call a coronavirus.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:44.286
And the sources of these are endless.

01:02:48.489 --> 01:02:58.656
And so they have to have people in place to say things that make everybody nod, like, oh, maybe it's a combination of all these exposures that dysregulate our microbiome.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:10.504
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth of the matter is what Brandy Vaughn so eloquently said when she suggested that you needed to compare

01:03:11.468 --> 01:03:26.216
the beauty of the organization of our physiology relative to ingestion versus the absurdity of the organization of our body relative to intramuscular injection.

01:03:30.939 --> 01:03:34.301
And this is just really a tragic place to be.

01:03:35.714 --> 01:03:47.544
And I've been trying to illustrate it for a long time now, but it has never been more apparent than right now when this chorus of liars continues to tell the same nonsense.

01:03:49.594 --> 01:03:52.217
Narrative, the same nonsense arguments.

01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:53.359
It's a hamster wheel.

01:03:53.379 --> 01:04:07.297
There's no way this is progress if a guy from Johns Hopkins is saying essentially what everybody's been saying since 2013 when Brian Hooker had the courage to say, I don't use the word autism.

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:16.500
The serotonin made, which is involved in mood and mental health, is from bacteria in the microbiome.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.981
That's where it's produced.

01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:29.228
And when you mess up the microbiome, when you carpet bomb the microbiome with all of these ingredients that don't appear in nature, these are novel chemicals, what are we doing?

01:04:29.308 --> 01:04:37.094
So we've known for a long time as a scientific community that kids with autism have different stool composition, different biodiversity.

01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:46.453
So when you... Exactly what Sabine Hazan is talking about biodiversity and how the COVID actually killed the bifidobacteria.

01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:53.737
That maybe long COVID is because people don't have their bifida bacteria anymore.

01:04:53.797 --> 01:05:03.025
Ladies and gentlemen, they are going to pull one of the greatest scams ever if we do not learn this biology ourselves.

01:05:03.045 --> 01:05:04.526
They're still leaving everything out.

01:05:04.926 --> 01:05:06.408
They're still leaving it all out.

01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:09.970
Look at the billion different bacteria that live in the microbiome.

01:05:11.051 --> 01:05:19.018
there may be an association between change in the microbiome and autism, and things that are changing the microbiome that we've not yet fully appreciated.

01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:20.940
And that could be a whole list of things.

01:05:22.515 --> 01:05:30.137
So I mean, this is right in your wheelhouse, Kim, to talk about gut health and microbiome.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.517
And he's talking about that.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:32.898
It's not just one.

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:42.600
Now, Kim is going to go on to sell a kimchi product and fermented foods product as a way of encouraging the good guys to grow in your gut microbiome.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:49.782
So the rest of this program, the rest of this program is essentially selling her products.

01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:58.427
And at the end of this little clip, he will say, yeah, you know, she's a sponsor and I take her things and I'm gonna take all of her stuff because I believe her.

01:05:59.367 --> 01:06:00.107
I shit you not.

01:06:01.608 --> 01:06:03.828
Now, why is this important?

01:06:03.908 --> 01:06:04.688
Why does it matter?

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.029
Who the hell is Jimmy Dore?

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:10.050
Well, Jimmy Dore is a guy who's in this picture right up there.

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:13.911
This same picture where if I get my head out of the way, this is my friend.

01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:19.052
This is my friend, smartest guy I ever knew, Nathan Breen.

01:06:20.745 --> 01:06:26.427
Him and his family were transfected multiple times because I, at the time, couldn't explain to him why it was so crazy.

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:27.308
I just knew it was.

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:29.509
He's gone.

01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:33.170
He died a couple years ago of acute amniorism.

01:06:33.451 --> 01:06:35.251
Just disappeared from their lives.

01:06:36.012 --> 01:06:36.432
And mine.

01:06:39.232 --> 01:06:40.113
So who's Jimmy Dore?

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:42.034
Well, Jimmy Dore's in this picture right here.

01:06:42.054 --> 01:06:43.735
It's a long, strange trip.

01:06:43.775 --> 01:06:47.557
There's Jimmy with my wife and the book that I gave him right there.

01:06:48.117 --> 01:07:00.204
I gave him a copy of the Wuhan coverup with lots of little tabs in it and handwritten notes, as well as a note with my number and an explanation for what these people were lying about.

01:07:00.804 --> 01:07:06.907
And two and a half years later, here he is, still promoting all the same people that are on the same team.

01:07:06.967 --> 01:07:07.708
Isn't that weird?

01:07:08.652 --> 01:07:10.994
He said Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:07:10.954 --> 01:07:11.375
's name.

01:07:11.435 --> 01:07:13.317
He said Jay Bhattacharya's name.

01:07:13.357 --> 01:07:15.158
He said Robert Malone's name.

01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:19.362
Didn't say Nathan Breen's name, but it's funny, right?

01:07:20.383 --> 01:07:21.204
It's pretty funny.

01:07:22.886 --> 01:07:23.767
I must be nuts.

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:32.551
So again, Robert Malone.

01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:39.653
Autism rates we've just learned in the United States in eight-year-olds are up to 3.22%.

01:07:41.553 --> 01:07:48.255
And a large proportion of these have severe intellectual disabilities, what we'll call learning disabilities in the UK.

01:07:48.395 --> 01:07:50.536
Remember, this is a guy who pushed the shot.

01:07:50.616 --> 01:07:59.018
This is a guy who has promoted the limited spectrum of immunological debate with a guy that worked for an mRNA company for a real long time.

01:07:59.598 --> 01:08:02.220
The other old dude that's on his program all the time.

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:06.083
This guy is the ultimate paid charlatan.

01:08:06.723 --> 01:08:17.530
And with his, you know, he is as seductive to a different group of people as Claire Craig is with her pointy glasses and weird accent and annoying voice.

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:22.013
This guy with his soothing voice and, hello, thank you for joining me.

01:08:22.033 --> 01:08:25.696
You know, he's kind of like an old Mickey Willis over there.

01:08:26.116 --> 01:08:28.377
He's selling you the same thing as well.

01:08:28.498 --> 01:08:28.758
Listen.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:30.439
23 data is one in 36.

01:08:30.999 --> 01:08:35.742
It is now going up to one in 31.

01:08:36.202 --> 01:08:39.004
This is a complete epidemic of autism.

01:08:39.704 --> 01:08:40.725
So what is causing it?

01:08:40.805 --> 01:08:44.687
Well, diseases can be caused by endogenous factors.

01:08:44.727 --> 01:08:48.829
Now, these are basically genetic factors, and it wouldn't change so quickly.

01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:52.752
So we can rule that one out while there might be a genetic predisposition.

01:08:53.472 --> 01:08:56.654
Sorry, let me make my head a little bigger here and then we'll go on.

01:08:58.212 --> 01:09:00.875
in some individuals, this is not what's causing this pandemic.

01:09:01.516 --> 01:09:05.339
And I think we can also pretty well rule out sociological and psychological things.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.644
This is due to some environmental cause, some environmental toxin.

01:09:10.264 --> 01:09:18.332
I've ruled those out so quickly because this is a biological disorder resulting in intellectual disability as well as all the features of

01:09:19.273 --> 01:09:45.980
autism this is a complete tragedy for what are all the features of autism as i said in the beginning of the program i would make the argument that i think 2013 brian hooker back when he had a pair would have made the argument that autism is a bullshit word that they put on the front of newsweek so that they can put all this injury into one bucket and then get everybody to run in a hamster wheel for 20 years trying to figure out what's the cause of all the shit in the bucket

01:09:48.456 --> 01:09:59.601
And if they start grouping Asperger's in there and all these other things in there, then it becomes very quickly obvious that we're not talking about acute injury from a vaccine exposure.

01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:04.523
We're talking about a whole host of things that could have a genetic and an environmental component.

01:10:07.044 --> 01:10:10.005
2013, Brian Hooker knew that that was the game.

01:10:11.746 --> 01:10:17.368
And 2020, Brian Hooker sold out Americans' children to Transfection and the Human Genome Project.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:21.516
in hopes that his friend Bobby Kennedy would get to the White House, I guess.

01:10:25.818 --> 01:10:31.000
And he adopted the narrative of Andy Wakefield, who is for sure a fraud.

01:10:32.076 --> 01:10:35.138
The papers that he published in the UK are frauds.

01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:37.721
The kids that are in that paper are frauds.

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:43.265
Within a week, I think I'm gonna have one of those parents be an interviewee on my show.

01:10:43.765 --> 01:10:51.772
And we're gonna go through the evidence that she has that shows that Wakefield is a fraud and was already a fraud in the UK years ago.

01:10:53.813 --> 01:11:00.599
She's been suffering her whole life because she's been living with this truth while he is on his ranch in Austin.

01:11:06.204 --> 01:11:11.669
or millions of families around the world that is going on at the moment that wasn't there in the past.

01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:13.851
This is a new phenomena.

01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:15.652
This is a new epidemic.

01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:18.755
So could it be a food?

01:11:19.355 --> 01:11:20.336
Potentially, yes.

01:11:20.937 --> 01:11:22.118
Or a variety of foods.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.200
Environmental toxins?

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.641
Yes, quite possibly.

01:11:26.342 --> 01:11:27.603
Could it be iatrogenic?

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:36.464
Now the Greek word for doctor is iatros, so iatrogenic means that which is caused by the iatros, the doctor.

01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:38.307
Could it be drugs?

01:11:39.269 --> 01:11:40.872
Could it be other factors?

01:11:42.486 --> 01:12:04.169
Now, what's curious about this is that people like Polly Tommy that have been in front of us for decades, people like Mary Holland, who have been front of us for decades, understand that the injury that occurred to their kids, Brian Hooker, who's been in front of us for decades now, they understand that their child changed abruptly.

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:12.833
It happened over hours or a couple days at most, but not weeks and months and years.

01:12:16.174 --> 01:12:27.339
The acute injuries that we are talking about as vaccine injuries, sudden infant death syndrome, does not require weeks.

01:12:38.038 --> 01:12:38.838
Are you hearing it yet?

01:12:40.199 --> 01:12:42.499
Is anyone having a revelation yet?

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.740
Could it be a cocktail effect?

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.301
Almost certainly it's going to be a cocktail effect.

01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:56.723
It's a case of what environmental factors are interacting to cause this increasing disaster.

01:12:57.804 --> 01:13:05.906
So this is supposedly an UK guy trying to use American data to say that there's some kind of disaster and supposedly trying to help.

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:09.936
He's a traitor and he is a liar.

01:13:12.076 --> 01:13:29.681
He has profited greatly from being on YouTube and making no progress at all as a skeptic, going from pushing transformation and transfection on millions of people around the world to apologizing for maybe have been wrong about it.

01:13:31.301 --> 01:13:34.982
And now he is still considered a prominent voice

01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:42.301
And he is parading the exact story that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:45.103
and Marty McCarty are all parroting now.

01:13:46.044 --> 01:13:48.065
We're going to get to the bottom of it by September.

01:13:49.326 --> 01:13:50.346
That we have in the United States.

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:52.808
And if you're in the UK, we'll see it in a minute.

01:13:52.888 --> 01:13:56.110
We're not that far behind, unfortunately.

01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:59.072
Not far behind at all.

01:14:00.173 --> 01:14:01.814
Now, this comes from here.

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:04.330
This is the source.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.212
Let's just look at that.

01:14:05.252 --> 01:14:07.076
We always want to check the references.

01:14:07.837 --> 01:14:11.324
That's from this paper here from the U.S.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.509
Department of Health and Human Services.

01:14:15.236 --> 01:14:19.417
This is what we are quoting from government communications in the United States.

01:14:19.977 --> 01:14:21.578
All are eminently readable, by the way.

01:14:21.658 --> 01:14:23.598
Feel free to check it out.

01:14:23.998 --> 01:14:26.099
So Washington, DC, 15th of April, 2025.

01:14:27.599 --> 01:14:30.460
Autism prevalence in the United States, eight years of age.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.081
2021, it was one in 36 children.

01:14:32.121 --> 01:14:32.541
Totally appalling.

01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:33.481
2022, one in 31 children.

01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:35.101
Now, I know what you're saying.

01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:35.982
It's 2025.

01:14:41.823 --> 01:14:46.045
It's preposterous that the data is so delayed, completely unacceptable.

01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:50.507
And I know Robert Kennedy is actively working on that now, I am expecting.

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:53.169
I would expect we're going to get 2023, even 2024 data in 2025.

01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:54.169
They are working on that.

01:14:59.442 --> 01:15:03.806
Anyway, what we now have is one in 31 eight-year-olds with autism, 3.22%.

01:15:04.426 --> 01:15:10.351
This is a complete, well, it's a catastrophe.

01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:13.614
It's just an appalling, an appalling situation.

01:15:13.794 --> 01:15:18.558
An appalling situation that Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:18.778 --> 01:15:25.484
and Brian Hooker and Andrew Wakefield, well, Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy have been aware of it for more than 20 years.

01:15:27.359 --> 01:15:30.722
Brian Hooker has been aware of it at least as far as I can tell since around 2010.

01:15:34.284 --> 01:15:35.365
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:15:35.405 --> 01:15:47.677
was only made aware of it in like 2017 when he did the introductory foreword for the third edition of the peanut allergy epidemic book.

01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:53.684
And that's a really interesting foreword because there he's not even really worried about autism.

01:15:53.724 --> 01:15:57.627
He's just talking about the allergy epidemic and how his kids had allergies.

01:15:58.328 --> 01:16:03.311
And so it's a very interesting progression that he's been on, because it's a progression.

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.952
It's just not a very impressive one.

01:16:05.713 --> 01:16:07.594
And this guy is the same kind of way.

01:16:08.014 --> 01:16:08.955
It's a progression.

01:16:09.015 --> 01:16:22.143
It's just not a very impressive one, where you go from advocating willy-nilly that everything on the TV is true and just accept everything that I tell you to, oh, sorry, I shouldn't have told you to do those things.

01:16:23.244 --> 01:16:26.446
Anyway, I'm going to keep going now because I don't feel any shame

01:16:26.966 --> 01:16:30.749
for having ruined millions of people's lives with my dumbass mouth.

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:33.251
I've got millions of subscribers.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:42.318
It's very hard not to be upset with these people given the fact that my family doesn't know how we're going to pay rent next month.

01:16:43.079 --> 01:16:54.308
Given the fact that I lost 20 years of my life and career in neuroscience because no one in this world would listen and continues to ignore me.

01:16:56.032 --> 01:16:57.193
But that's all over today.

01:16:58.734 --> 01:17:00.235
This is the show that ends it all.

01:17:01.937 --> 01:17:19.591
Now, this continues, the absurdity continues beyond the joke Nurse Campbell here, the obvious traitor from the UK who has had all these people on his show and never once questioned the premise of any of this.

01:17:21.639 --> 01:17:24.300
But the absurdity goes even worse, right?

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.961
Because Rumble will show you an absurdity.

01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:30.782
I'm honored to introduce to you Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:33.343
This is the thing they're all talking about, right?

01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:39.165
This is the one they're all talking about, right?

01:17:41.266 --> 01:17:48.669
I'm going to go over some of the key numbers from the ADDM report.

01:17:50.615 --> 01:17:57.383
You would be forgiven if you didn't realize that this was the first time he was speaking as HHS secretary.

01:18:01.648 --> 01:18:10.679
After apparently dedicating his life to getting where he is now, this is the speech.

01:18:14.338 --> 01:18:26.588
this wonderful writer of many books, this spectacular orator that spoke in front of a huge crowd in Germany in 2021 to speak out against the lockdown.

01:18:28.589 --> 01:18:29.750
Here's his great speech.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:38.938
Overall, the autism is increasing in prevalence at an alarming rate.

01:18:40.453 --> 01:18:44.395
The study tests eight-year-olds who were born in 2014.

01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:50.738
And by the way, these studies are two years later than they should be.

01:18:51.898 --> 01:19:02.643
And one of the things that we're going to do as we move this function to the Administration for a Healthy America to the new chronic disease division.

01:19:02.803 --> 01:19:09.006
If your advisors are Mary Holland and Meryl Nass,

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:20.830
and Robert Malone, and you allow your secretary to introduce you because she's the only one you trust.

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:22.390
It's like an admission.

01:19:25.612 --> 01:19:33.135
That lady who introduced him is the same lady that is always there when you're on his podcast or when you talk to him, you talk to her first.

01:19:33.655 --> 01:19:34.496
She's always been there.

01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:38.898
This is a sign of desperation.

01:19:40.097 --> 01:19:41.178
He doesn't trust anyone.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:43.139
And with good reason.

01:19:44.979 --> 01:19:49.482
Because he's Health and Human Services Secretary and this is what he's left with?

01:19:51.263 --> 01:20:07.131
His first public appearance after being General Counsel and CEO of Children's Health Defense, after being featured in Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2, after being slandered on TV as an anti-vaxxer,

01:20:10.182 --> 01:20:12.443
He's not exactly bringing down the house with this.

01:20:15.404 --> 01:20:18.325
I think I feel a little sad for him when I saw it live.

01:20:20.105 --> 01:20:23.647
It made me terrified, actually, because I know who's behind him.

01:20:23.827 --> 01:20:30.049
I know who gets to whisper in his ears and who gets to tell him that you shouldn't listen to Jonathan Cooey.

01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:38.412
You know, Jonathan Cooey, the guy that he listed first in the expert list in this book.

01:20:41.559 --> 01:20:45.282
America is under attack, and we need your help.

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:51.627
Bobby Kennedy doesn't know how badly he is being used.

01:20:52.027 --> 01:20:53.148
It's obvious here.

01:20:53.428 --> 01:20:55.790
Otherwise, his secretary wouldn't have introduced him.

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:57.071
It would have been somebody else.

01:20:58.232 --> 01:20:59.573
But he doesn't trust anyone.

01:20:59.593 --> 01:21:02.134
He doesn't have anyone around him he can trust.

01:21:03.355 --> 01:21:09.160
And he's very reluctantly reading this dumb script that he knows is dumb, but he doesn't understand why.

01:21:13.029 --> 01:21:14.349
Do you understand why yet?

01:21:14.389 --> 01:21:26.051
We are going to have updated real-time data so that people can look at this, so Americans can understand what is happening with chronic disease in this country in real time.

01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:29.452
And I'd have to wait two years to react.

01:21:30.632 --> 01:21:37.613
We don't wait two years to react to a measles epidemic or any kind of infectious disease.

01:21:37.673 --> 01:21:41.854
We shouldn't have to do that for diabetes or autism.

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:47.975
The ASD prevalence rate in 8-year-olds is now 1 in 31.

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.798
Shocking.

01:21:50.858 --> 01:21:52.840
There is an extreme risk for boys.

01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:59.027
Overall, the risk for boys of getting an autism diagnosis in this country is now 1 in 20.

01:21:59.227 --> 01:21:59.647
And as high

01:22:04.198 --> 01:22:10.987
I mean, understand on Newsweek in 2003, it said boys get it more than girls.

01:22:11.568 --> 01:22:12.710
Is he really a hero?

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:20.841
Because 10 years later, Brian Hooker said he doesn't use the word autism.

01:22:23.137 --> 01:22:35.406
And then 10 years after that, Brian Hooker has a book with Sky Horse Publishing and supported him to get president and fired me at Children's Health Defense with Mary Holland.

01:22:38.007 --> 01:22:59.573
and uses the word autism just like they're using the word autism as a bullshit mythology to make sure that nobody understands the difference between injection and ingestion and considers the exposure to heavy metals from exhaust and cars to be equivalent to that in needles in your first six months.

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:05.895
And once again, I'm disappointing some of my friends because I'm angry again.

01:23:07.952 --> 01:23:11.494
Because I'm not able to shine love.

01:23:14.936 --> 01:23:18.958
Because I'm not able to deliver this message with love.

01:23:19.099 --> 01:23:28.224
But I don't know how to describe the malevolent trap that we're in without some degree of desperation that you really grasp it.

01:23:29.795 --> 01:23:38.517
The absolute best case scenario is this guy doesn't know what's going on and hasn't known what's going on since he was in his early 20s.

01:23:39.938 --> 01:23:43.178
And he's a damaged and traumatized kid.

01:23:45.939 --> 01:23:52.180
And behind him are extremely malevolent players that have not allowed us to escape.

01:23:54.081 --> 01:23:57.842
That have stood in front of people like Brandy Vaughn and now me,

01:23:58.942 --> 01:24:08.444
four years without telling the American public and the world the truth, and had a fake argument about it for more than a decade.

01:24:08.464 --> 01:24:17.126
Uh-oh, I might have a problem here.

01:24:18.246 --> 01:24:18.546
Ships.

01:24:19.127 --> 01:24:19.827
Are you still there?

01:24:19.907 --> 01:24:20.807
Everybody still there?

01:24:20.827 --> 01:24:22.747
Can you give me a shine in the chat?

01:24:22.847 --> 01:24:25.248
I think something happened with my

01:24:26.343 --> 01:24:27.984
with my slideshow here.

01:24:28.004 --> 01:24:29.385
I'm going to have to escape out.

01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:30.446
Yes, you're still there.

01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:30.687
Good.

01:24:30.867 --> 01:24:31.187
Okay.

01:24:31.307 --> 01:24:36.772
I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to quit PowerPoint here.

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:37.592
Something happened.

01:24:40.555 --> 01:24:41.435
Yeah, I'm going to have to quit.

01:24:41.495 --> 01:24:41.976
There we go.

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:43.817
I think it's coming back.

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:45.218
No, it's dying.

01:24:45.779 --> 01:24:46.620
So just give me a second.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.941
I have to reset PowerPoint.

01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:52.925
I don't know what exactly happened here, but we're going to have to do a little control alt delete action.

01:24:54.813 --> 01:24:56.234
and just kill that PowerPoint.

01:24:56.294 --> 01:24:57.254
That's the easiest way.

01:24:58.074 --> 01:24:58.554
Bang.

01:24:59.435 --> 01:24:59.815
Oh no.

01:25:02.236 --> 01:25:02.636
Bang.

01:25:02.936 --> 01:25:03.736
Yes, there we go.

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:04.357
Okay.

01:25:04.737 --> 01:25:07.118
I'm going to reopen the PowerPoint.

01:25:07.158 --> 01:25:08.058
I hope you're still there.

01:25:08.078 --> 01:25:12.980
I will just, whatever.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.361
I don't need that.

01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:17.642
I must have altered something and not saved it.

01:25:17.662 --> 01:25:19.902
And then that creates a little bit of a problem here.

01:25:20.023 --> 01:25:21.103
So we are here.

01:25:21.977 --> 01:25:30.721
We are here, we are there, we got there, we did that one, we did this one, we did this one, now we did this one, so we were doing this one.

01:25:30.741 --> 01:25:44.567
Yeah, so I had another video too that I wanted to show you, I didn't even include it in this one, so oops, sorry, I'm gonna get rid of that, and then I'm starting with this slide, sorry.

01:25:44.667 --> 01:25:49.209
So we have this video going right- I'm honored to introduce to you Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:50.093 --> 01:25:53.914
And I think I can probably, can I do that?

01:25:53.994 --> 01:25:54.215
No.

01:25:55.975 --> 01:25:56.295
So.

01:25:56.315 --> 01:26:00.017
I'm honored to introduce to you Secretary Robert F. Kennedy.

01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:11.360
I'm just going to escape really quick and move this to the front so I can, so that I can put it right here.

01:26:11.981 --> 01:26:12.201
There.

01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:13.001
Yeah.

01:26:13.561 --> 01:26:14.842
So I can control it a little bit.

01:26:18.883 --> 01:26:30.566
So what I'm arguing is that the primary argument that they make is that it's exposure to a bunch of things.

01:26:30.606 --> 01:26:31.726
We've got to think about it.

01:26:31.826 --> 01:26:35.907
In this particular talk, he doesn't say vaccines at all.

01:26:38.288 --> 01:26:42.629
He's going to go through the key numbers of this new study that came out that, you know,

01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:49.532
People like John Campbell are covering, and people like Peter McCullough are covering, and they're doing substacks about it.

01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:54.474
And it's all supposed to be revealing something that was already on the cover of Newsweek in 2003.

01:26:54.995 --> 01:27:09.662
And Brian Hooker already knew was bullshit and could say it very well in 2013, and then stopped saying it at some point after he met Brandi Vaughn, after he met Mary Holland, after he was in Bax and Bax 2.

01:27:10.987 --> 01:27:13.768
And so somewhere along the line, Brian Hooker sold us out.

01:27:14.008 --> 01:27:23.833
Somewhere along the line, he capitulated to Mary Holland and these other people who I guess promised that this guy would get into power and then finally fix the problem.

01:27:25.339 --> 01:27:33.583
And that argument is, I think, what they use to get everybody to ignore Brandy Vaughn's basic biology and get them to ignore my basic biology.

01:27:34.004 --> 01:27:41.788
That's why Brian Hooker and Mary Holland fired me from CHD after I had worked for a year for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:41.848 --> 01:27:44.990
and successfully gotten my name in the book first.

01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:47.511
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:47.551 --> 01:27:48.832
and I parted friends.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.801
I still have his email and cell phone.

01:27:51.861 --> 01:27:55.263
I have his secretary's cell phone number still.

01:27:55.343 --> 01:27:55.863
It works.

01:27:58.244 --> 01:28:04.368
But these people who are influencing him and telling him what to believe have already discredited me many times.

01:28:04.428 --> 01:28:06.309
And so he doesn't believe me, he believes them.

01:28:06.689 --> 01:28:17.655
And he believes that this is the way forward, the way forward that they've been doing for like 10 years, before he reluctantly went from being the head of the World Mercury Project to being the head of CHD.

01:28:23.514 --> 01:28:23.935
It's one in 36.

01:28:24.415 --> 01:28:31.881
Since the first ADDM report in 1990, which was 1992 births.

01:28:32.762 --> 01:28:34.943
I mean, you should, it's pathetic, this talk.

01:28:34.983 --> 01:28:36.325
So what did I figure out?

01:28:36.405 --> 01:28:37.245
What did we break?

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:38.827
How can we win?

01:28:44.851 --> 01:28:46.553
This is the video that broke it for me.

01:28:51.236 --> 01:28:51.837
This is the one.

01:28:52.574 --> 01:28:54.254
I am honored to introduce to you.

01:28:56.715 --> 01:29:10.558
Remember, since 2015, since 2015, Mary Holland has been fighting and been saying that vaccines have never been tested against a placebo.

01:29:12.098 --> 01:29:18.860
Testing vaccines against placebo is simply unethical, is exactly what Paul Offit argued with her

01:29:19.961 --> 01:29:21.262
on Democracy Now in 2015.

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:33.233
A prominent television program at that time, and not television, a prominent alternative cable and internet thing.

01:29:33.433 --> 01:29:35.335
I mean, it's crazy, NPR lady.

01:29:38.652 --> 01:29:40.654
Now understand the significance of that.

01:29:40.774 --> 01:29:41.935
Those are the two arguments.

01:29:42.035 --> 01:29:46.279
Paul Offit says that testing vaccines against a placebo is simply unethical.

01:29:46.759 --> 01:29:47.800
What does he mean by that?

01:29:47.840 --> 01:30:00.912
He means that you can't let a kid grow up without the measles vaccine to test the measles vaccine against placebo because that would be unethical to the kid that will inevitably get measles without the vaccine.

01:30:02.153 --> 01:30:14.855
And that argument is precisely the argument that he presented against Mary Holland on this program as representative of the FDA and the CDC and the NIH and the U.S.

01:30:14.915 --> 01:30:30.318
government back then in 2015 when she presented herself as a Columbia professor with an injured child who regressed rapidly after his MMR shot, just like Pauly Tommy

01:30:31.181 --> 01:30:48.591
in the UK a few years earlier was telling a story about her son who acutely regressed after her MMR and helping to sway more than 6 million voters in the UK by putting herself on billboards in a bra.

01:30:51.303 --> 01:31:13.576
In 2015, Mary Holland and Polly Tommy would get together and organize a movement that would eventually result in the Vaxxed movie and the formation of ICANN and eventually the co-opting of the World Mercury Project in 2018 to become the Children's Health Defense with Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:13.656 --> 01:31:16.478
as their figurehead and Brian Hooker,

01:31:19.594 --> 01:31:26.478
And the argument that they have continued to make throughout this time is that the vaccines have never been tested against placebo.

01:31:26.959 --> 01:31:28.840
The vaccines have never been tested.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.002
The adjuvants have never been tested against placebo.

01:31:32.402 --> 01:31:35.724
They always use an adjuvant when they test vaccines.

01:31:35.764 --> 01:31:37.625
They never test against placebo.

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.006
That's not fair.

01:31:40.285 --> 01:31:44.090
And Paul Offit has always been arguing, no, they test against the old vaccine.

01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:50.978
They test new vaccines against old vaccines because testing against the placebo would be unethical.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:32:00.329
And if you're following me along now, the exact enchantment that Aaron Seery of Goldman Sachs

01:32:02.278 --> 01:32:08.523
There's a Goldman Sachs person that's also in the same group that I just said, the Weston, what is it?

01:32:08.543 --> 01:32:11.065
Weston Price, Weston A. Price Foundation.

01:32:11.445 --> 01:32:13.427
There's also a Goldman Sachs person in there.

01:32:14.488 --> 01:32:24.295
And not only is Aaron Seery and this lady, Makuna Han, she's also a Goldman Sachs, but also Steve Bannon, who's behind these people is Goldman Sachs.

01:32:24.355 --> 01:32:25.056
It's weird, right?

01:32:26.223 --> 01:32:29.809
They also all work for Merck or brokered for Merck.

01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:34.476
The one that owns the vaccine schedule majority shots, but you know, nobody talks about Merck.

01:32:34.836 --> 01:32:39.504
The one that used to own the intellectual property for Ivermectin.

01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:44.591
These people have been arguing two sides of a coin.

01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:46.051
Please let me be clear.

01:32:46.512 --> 01:32:52.393
The one side of the coin that Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:32:52.673 --> 01:33:00.256
and Aaron Seery and Del Bigtree have been on is that vaccines have never been tested against placebo.

01:33:01.317 --> 01:33:11.980
The specific enchantment is that vaccines have never been put through a long-term placebo-controlled double-blind trial.

01:33:15.021 --> 01:33:27.265
And the dispellation, the dispelling of that enchantment is done by Paul Offit and Paul Offit exclusively for more than 20 years.

01:33:29.113 --> 01:33:43.684
Because we can go back all the way to 2007 to the book that Paul Offit wrote called Vaccinated, From Cowpox to mRNA.

01:33:45.385 --> 01:33:54.612
And so it's not by accident that Paul Offit is the guy who has been consistently in front of us, arguing with Mary Holland, arguing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:56.455 --> 01:33:58.356
calling out Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:58.456 --> 01:34:05.559
as a fraud for so many years that it is impossible for it to be anything but a theater.

01:34:07.139 --> 01:34:13.622
Because he has also occupied the exact same script for that entire duration.

01:34:14.062 --> 01:34:18.143
That testing vaccines against a placebo is simply unethical.

01:34:18.604 --> 01:34:22.345
And everybody has repeated this from Tony Fauci on down.

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:25.379
And for some reason or another.

01:34:27.233 --> 01:34:35.678
Yesterday, I came up with an idea that would satisfy both of these problems in one go that either side could propose as the checkmate experiment.

01:34:36.198 --> 01:34:48.085
And for some reason or another, both the genius, Paul Offit, the genius of Tony Fauci, the genius of all these people at the FDA and the CDC have never come up with this question and this experiment.

01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:54.068
And also equally befuddling, all the people with all these Skyhorse books

01:34:54.923 --> 01:35:12.410
You know, all these Skyhorse books, like the Skyhorse book that Brian Hooker has, the multiple Skyhorse books that Robert Malone has, the multiple Skyhorse books that frickin' Andrew Wakefield has.

01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:23.467
Those people have never been able to come up with a counter-argument for testing vaccines against placebo is simply unethical.

01:35:24.147 --> 01:35:29.412
They only repeat the line that Aaron Seery repeats and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:29.452 --> 01:35:34.156
repeats that they've never tested vaccines or their adjuvants against a placebo.

01:35:34.877 --> 01:35:42.684
There are no long-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of vaccines.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.404
Listen carefully and see if you can get the conclusion before I do, or before I say it.

01:35:50.704 --> 01:36:00.031
From Microbe TV, this is Beyond the Noise, episode number 62, recorded on April 15th, 2025.

01:36:04.334 --> 01:36:05.815
That's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:05.855 --> 01:36:06.876
under fire there.

01:36:06.936 --> 01:36:09.398
And joining me today is your host, Dr. Paul Offit.

01:36:09.938 --> 01:36:10.499
Hi Vincent.

01:36:11.786 --> 01:36:19.549
This is the video version of Paul's column on Substack called Beyond the Noise, cutting to the chase on important health topics.

01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:25.632
Today we will have a closer look at Paul's column, RFK Jr.'

01:36:25.612 --> 01:36:28.173
's Autism Bombshell.

01:36:29.699 --> 01:36:31.581
As you write, RFK Jr.

01:36:31.621 --> 01:36:37.807
claims he will find the cause of autism by September.

01:36:38.168 --> 01:36:47.437
We've launched a massive testing and research effort that's going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world.

01:36:48.223 --> 01:36:51.845
By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.

01:36:52.665 --> 01:36:53.826
We'll be able to eliminate it.

01:36:53.846 --> 01:37:00.630
Now, one of the arguments that I'm making, and I want all of you foreigners, people from outside of America to hear this, I'm asking for help.

01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.531
Because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:03.571 --> 01:37:05.593
doesn't understand that he's been set up.

01:37:06.273 --> 01:37:09.094
Maybe Donald Trump doesn't know or care that he's been set up.

01:37:09.695 --> 01:37:15.118
But half of America is about to be led to believe that this is the most dangerous man

01:37:16.403 --> 01:37:18.883
in the most dangerous times we've ever been in.

01:37:18.984 --> 01:37:25.345
He's about to ruin America and endanger children going into the future.

01:37:27.125 --> 01:37:42.428
Paul Offit is painting a very dark picture where action might be necessary, where we might have to do something drastic, just like other people are painting a picture where, you know, maybe we're gonna have to do something about these people because they're really bad.

01:37:45.029 --> 01:37:56.293
We are in a very dangerous place in America because the American right is captured by a fake anti-vax movement and they believe very strongly in that anti-vax movement.

01:37:56.373 --> 01:38:05.977
And the left is captured by people who can use that designed fake anti-vax movement to implode America.

01:38:08.052 --> 01:38:13.676
because the right is not aware that they are fooled and the left is not aware that they are being fooled.

01:38:13.736 --> 01:38:20.021
They just think they are willing, that they are right, that they are just dumb people.

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:34.772
But no, ladies and gentlemen, outside of America, this has been a long and meticulous trap that was first executed in the UK by Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield.

01:38:36.047 --> 01:38:50.758
and then imported into the United States and re-executed using ICANN, the movie Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2, and CHD to ultimately put people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:51.218 --> 01:39:01.206
in positions of power falsely and never actually get to the stage where we break the mythology.

01:39:03.007 --> 01:39:03.828
It's by design.

01:39:04.676 --> 01:39:10.742
And they use people who have ambitions, like I want to be president, and they use people to do that.

01:39:11.563 --> 01:39:19.230
People like the Goldman Sachs operator, Steve Bannon, uses people like that.

01:39:20.731 --> 01:39:23.253
I believe Steve Bannon lies for a living.

01:39:24.156 --> 01:39:34.662
I believe Steve Bannon coordinates scripts for other people that lie for a living on social media, that get contracts to lie on social media.

01:39:37.103 --> 01:39:41.726
Lie about biology and lie about the people trying to tell the truth about the biology.

01:39:42.847 --> 01:39:45.528
And to lie to people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:45.588 --> 01:39:48.810
so that he is completely unaware of the Truman Show that he is.

01:39:52.421 --> 01:40:05.885
Maybe they lie to Donald Trump too and Donald Trump doesn't know, but my guess is, is that these people agree that people need to be ruled, that the vast majority of people are godless animals and that we can treat them like garbage.

01:40:08.225 --> 01:40:09.046
I don't believe that.

01:40:09.786 --> 01:40:13.247
I don't believe the children of earth are the vast majority of them are garbage.

01:40:16.007 --> 01:40:21.609
I believe I've been put on this earth for one reason and one reason only it's to make sure that the children of earth are

01:40:24.423 --> 01:40:27.565
are not subject to this for another countless generations.

01:40:27.825 --> 01:40:28.806
So what's the break?

01:40:29.846 --> 01:40:31.147
Did you figure it out yet?

01:40:32.368 --> 01:40:34.269
Did you figure out the enchantment yet?

01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:39.753
Has this disease been ignored by researchers?

01:40:41.154 --> 01:40:41.414
No.

01:40:42.154 --> 01:40:46.917
So autism was first defined by Leo Kanner in the late 1930s.

01:40:48.098 --> 01:40:52.481
And at the time it was considered to be very rare, kind of similar to childhood schizophrenia.

01:40:53.146 --> 01:40:55.627
But over time, it's become much better recognized.

01:40:55.987 --> 01:40:58.947
The definition has... Now, remember what I'm trying to argue.

01:40:59.047 --> 01:41:01.648
First and foremost, you must see the illusion.

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:08.290
This is a 2003 Newsweek article telling you that four out of five autistic children are male.

01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:20.052
Ten years later, Brian Hooker, the father of an autistic child, would not use the word autism because he did not believe autism was the right term.

01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:22.593
These are injured children.

01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:27.179
neurologically injured children, and it's from injection.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:37.627
And at that time in 2013, 10 years after this front cover, Brian Hooker would not use the word autism and questioned the rationale of vaccination.

01:41:38.107 --> 01:41:51.377
Brian Hooker is now one of the people, part of CHD, who does use the word autism, does think there's all kinds of causes for it, does think there's a genetic part of it, does think there was a COVID,

01:41:52.304 --> 01:42:09.169
does think that lots of people were killed by the spike protein and will not tell you the truth that I so desperately tried to tell him as I worked as a staff scientist for him for six months before he fired me on the advice of Mary Holland.

01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:15.171
I guess because he believed that ultimately Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:15.211 --> 01:42:16.072
would do the right thing.

01:42:16.112 --> 01:42:17.512
But Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:20.033
isn't doing anything on his own.

01:42:22.642 --> 01:42:25.333
Otherwise, there's no explanation for how we're here.

01:42:27.059 --> 01:42:27.662
Go ahead, Paul.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.844
broadened, there's to include autism spectrum disorder, there's better diagnostic testing.

01:42:33.884 --> 01:42:38.427
So now, it's far more common, arguably as common.

01:42:38.608 --> 01:42:41.410
There's a problem Reginald Perrin in the chat.

01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:43.671
I'm going to put this up really quick, the Twitch chat.

01:42:44.232 --> 01:42:50.096
Reginald Perrin here, he says, just don't bother with placebo test backs versus non backs.

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:53.299
Okay, so that's, there's a problem with that.

01:42:53.379 --> 01:42:55.801
I'm sorry, that chat didn't show up as well as it should have.

01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:55.941
But

01:42:58.377 --> 01:43:00.797
Reginald is posing an argument.

01:43:00.837 --> 01:43:02.018
Don't bother with placebo.

01:43:02.058 --> 01:43:03.818
Test the vaxxed versus non-vaxxed.

01:43:04.318 --> 01:43:10.060
Of course, you understand, right, that that is this book that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:13.301
eventually published with Skyhorse Publishing and Brian Hooker in 2023.

01:43:13.501 --> 01:43:15.581
That's this book.

01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:18.482
Let's compare vaxxed to un-vaxxed.

01:43:19.082 --> 01:43:20.663
Now, the problem with that is,

01:43:21.483 --> 01:43:25.225
is that that's not a placebo double blind control trial.

01:43:25.305 --> 01:43:29.427
And that's what Aaron Seery and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:29.467 --> 01:43:32.888
and Mary Holland keep vomiting for the last 10 years.

01:43:32.928 --> 01:43:35.490
They're not asking for that comparison.

01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:40.092
That's the comparison that Brandy Hooker, sorry, Brandy Vaughn wanted to make.

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:44.794
And Brian Hooker made apparently in his book that CHD doesn't ever bother to sell.

01:43:47.338 --> 01:43:50.019
To a certain extent, you're right, except for one thing.

01:43:50.519 --> 01:43:54.720
Paul Offit will tell you that that comparison is not valid.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:06.123
That comparison is not valid because those kids don't get the infectious disease that they're not vaccinated for because the rest of the kids around them are vaccinated.

01:44:07.364 --> 01:44:10.444
And so it's not a real observation.

01:44:10.584 --> 01:44:11.985
It's just anecdotal.

01:44:12.085 --> 01:44:14.085
It's just because vaccines work.

01:44:14.746 --> 01:44:15.726
This difference

01:44:16.806 --> 01:44:28.735
he would argue is because vaccines work and to actually ethically test in the way that they are arguing with a double blind control trial with placebo would be unethical.

01:44:30.937 --> 01:44:32.078
And so you're almost there.

01:44:32.218 --> 01:44:33.959
You're almost there, Reginald.

01:44:34.019 --> 01:44:34.660
Keep thinking.

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:35.741
You almost got it.

01:44:36.722 --> 01:44:37.742
One has one in 32 children.

01:44:39.643 --> 01:44:42.925
And what that has garnered is an enormous amount of resources.

01:44:43.265 --> 01:44:48.849
Really, billions of dollars have been spent trying to understand the cause or causes of this disorder.

01:44:49.089 --> 01:44:57.114
Starting in 2011, when there were $160 million spent by the government, with increases every year up to about $330 million last year.

01:44:57.134 --> 01:44:58.395
A funny argument, right?

01:44:58.415 --> 01:45:02.137
That they spent a lot of money, so obviously people are trying to understand it.

01:45:02.198 --> 01:45:02.838
That's really cute.

01:45:03.573 --> 01:45:10.159
An additional $2 billion is going to be spent through the Autism CARES Act over the next five years.

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.142
So this is a heavily studied phenomenon.

01:45:13.383 --> 01:45:15.705
I would argue again, let me put the chat up here.

01:45:15.805 --> 01:45:21.711
I would argue again, Rupo Mini says, can we look at the Amish?

01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:23.532
I would argue that we cannot.

01:45:23.713 --> 01:45:26.856
And the reason why is because, again, the left

01:45:28.319 --> 01:45:30.180
Because remember, it's bullshit on both sides.

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:36.784
The left can just make the disingenuous argument that the reason why the Amish are healthy is because they eat better.

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:41.907
And because there is no measles anymore because everybody else is vaccinated.

01:45:43.648 --> 01:45:49.011
That's the reason why Steve Kirsch can make that argument on Twitter and gets promoted making that argument on Twitter.

01:45:49.451 --> 01:45:51.432
Because it's a loser argument.

01:45:52.553 --> 01:45:54.314
And I didn't see it until yesterday.

01:45:55.819 --> 01:46:07.949
The non-VAX to VAX comparison is a loser argument, and more importantly, it doesn't address the hamster wheel that Paul Offit and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:10.751
have been reinforcing for a decade.

01:46:11.412 --> 01:46:16.036
This hamster wheel is still rock solid, and nobody

01:46:16.781 --> 01:46:32.673
Aaron Seery, Big Tree, Robert Malone, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Meryl Nass, Mary Holland, none of them in a decade have been able to break free of this hamster wheel, this bullshit dichotomy.

01:46:33.834 --> 01:46:35.495
And today I'm going to break you free of it.

01:46:36.276 --> 01:46:38.237
So fast, it's going to make your head spin.

01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:42.821
Coming on, um, autism and, um,

01:46:44.464 --> 01:46:45.224
RFK Jr.

01:46:45.244 --> 01:46:54.651
makes it sound like he's just discovered all this and will let us know exactly what the cause is by September, which is a level of hubris that is kind of hard to watch.

01:46:55.912 --> 01:47:02.757
Specifically, he says he will find out why the numbers of autism diagnoses have gone up.

01:47:02.857 --> 01:47:09.743
Now, when did, so discovered in 1930, you said, when did the cases really start to go up, do you know?

01:47:10.283 --> 01:47:11.404
I think probably in the last

01:47:12.727 --> 01:47:12.987
15 years.

01:47:13.647 --> 01:47:15.208
You really started around 2010.

01:47:15.568 --> 01:47:21.109
Okay, so let's just ignore the fact that they're trying to pretend like I don't really know the real numbers.

01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:23.290
It's pretty hard to tell because why?

01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:25.431
Because we tried to diagnose them.

01:47:25.471 --> 01:47:27.531
We're starting to diagnose them differently.

01:47:27.971 --> 01:47:32.632
Pretty soon they're going to use PCR and then they can find the epidemic of autism everywhere.

01:47:32.692 --> 01:47:34.493
It's probably spreading asymptomatically.

01:47:35.513 --> 01:47:38.174
In 2011, when you started to see more federal funding, and that's just federal funding.

01:47:38.314 --> 01:47:40.835
I mean, you have groups like the Autism Science Foundation.

01:47:40.915 --> 01:47:47.798
So the more money they spent, the more autism they detected, and so then the numbers are all really bullshit.

01:47:48.598 --> 01:47:49.498
Interesting, isn't it?

01:47:50.739 --> 01:47:54.260
Foundation, which also spends millions of dollars trying to understand this disorder.

01:47:55.112 --> 01:47:56.634
the Autism Society of America.

01:47:57.815 --> 01:48:04.984
There are a number of autism societies, private foundations, that have also spent money giving grants to try and understand this.

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:07.227
But nonetheless, RFK Jr.

01:48:07.267 --> 01:48:09.069
is going to figure this all out by September.

01:48:10.213 --> 01:48:10.893
I wonder if he's aware.

01:48:10.953 --> 01:48:23.376
And so America is under attack because it is scary if the left and people representing the left and the Democrats and the blue team can just look at the Trump administration and say, this is really scary.

01:48:23.796 --> 01:48:26.036
This level of hubris is really scary.

01:48:26.376 --> 01:48:31.717
If we knew the cause of autism and we could just have it by September, then we would have done it a long time ago.

01:48:31.777 --> 01:48:34.198
And that argument is pretty damn persuasive.

01:48:34.638 --> 01:48:42.745
And it makes Bobby look like kind of a chump, especially when he goes on stage and puts his reading glasses on and isn't very impressive as an orator.

01:48:43.686 --> 01:48:54.075
I mean, the level of separation between people in America right now is worse than it's ever been.

01:48:54.275 --> 01:48:55.696
And it's a frightening level.

01:48:55.836 --> 01:48:58.339
And we need help getting out of this.

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:05.844
because we are being misled on both sides by people who are following the same script.

01:49:08.626 --> 01:49:11.568
There are all these other studies that have gone on.

01:49:11.588 --> 01:49:15.831
I mean, they're under his purview now.

01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:22.556
It's interesting that autism was discovered at a time when there really were no vaccines.

01:49:24.445 --> 01:49:26.430
That's right, so in the 1930s, what did you have?

01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:29.779
You had the smallpox vaccine, you had a rabies vaccine.

01:49:30.727 --> 01:49:32.388
You didn't have a flu vaccine yet.

01:49:32.428 --> 01:49:36.109
You were just starting to get diphtheria and pertussis vaccines.

01:49:36.209 --> 01:49:42.871
So now the argument that they're trying to make is that autism's always been around and so we're just detecting it better.

01:49:43.291 --> 01:49:46.372
We're grouping more sets of symptoms in.

01:49:46.432 --> 01:49:49.533
That's why we have Asperger's and this one and that one.

01:49:50.053 --> 01:49:54.375
And so again, this is a very persuasive argument that has been

01:49:54.935 --> 01:50:04.219
crafted over a couple decades, starting with Andrew Wakefield in the UK, and then his reinvention of him and Polly in America for Vaxxed.

01:50:04.299 --> 01:50:13.643
This is all part of the same narrative that has been curated and honed to absorb all of the challenges.

01:50:15.384 --> 01:50:16.205
And here we are now.

01:50:17.125 --> 01:50:17.965
This is recent.

01:50:17.985 --> 01:50:22.487
This is like yesterday, which were invented around the 20s and started to be used around the 30s.

01:50:22.507 --> 01:50:22.988
But you're right.

01:50:23.088 --> 01:50:23.688
Didn't have much.

01:50:25.194 --> 01:50:32.699
So this money that you just mentioned for autism research comes from the U.S.

01:50:32.739 --> 01:50:33.099
government.

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:41.424
I presume it's not going to be touched as so many other programs have been canceled by this administration, right?

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:45.811
if it's a priority for RFK Jr., I guess that that money won't be tossed.

01:50:45.831 --> 01:50:55.639
And there is the Autism Cares Act, which gives another $2 billion over the next five years, but no need to do things over the next five years, since we're going to know everything we need to know by September.

01:50:56.519 --> 01:50:59.242
What are some of the potential causes of autism?

01:50:59.282 --> 01:50:59.862
Is there just one?

01:51:02.603 --> 01:51:06.726
It's a complex interplay, I think, between genetic and environmental factors.

01:51:06.826 --> 01:51:21.236
Which is exactly the same thing that Sky Horse publishing author James Lyons Weiler said in 2016 in his book titled The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:30.582
It's the same thing that Marty McCarty says is it's a variety of things that are causing a dysregulation of our microbiome.

01:51:32.717 --> 01:51:43.241
What a remarkable parallel in the interpretation of the, you know, the thing that also even Peter McCullough agrees it's like a whole spectrum of stuff that causes the spectrum.

01:51:43.581 --> 01:51:48.803
The genetic factors include a number of genes, up to a hundred genes really, that have been identified.

01:51:49.163 --> 01:51:53.385
A hundred of genes have been identified as possibly related to

01:52:02.499 --> 01:52:10.964
most of which are associated with synaptic development, meaning how one brain cell communicates with another, and that are expressed often early in pregnancy.

01:52:11.659 --> 01:52:18.643
There are environmental factors like during pregnancy infection with rubella, germ measles, or infection with cytomegalovirus.

01:52:19.423 --> 01:52:29.348
Remember that that's also what Suzanne Humphreys and Brian Hooker have been saying for the last five or six years since they got co-opted or since they got introduced to this.

01:52:29.428 --> 01:52:34.471
They say that it's really dangerous to give vaccines to kids that are sick.

01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:38.632
And that's a part of the narrative that they adopted very recently.

01:52:38.692 --> 01:52:43.174
And actually Suzanne Humphreys repeated on the Joe Rogan show a couple of weeks ago.

01:52:44.134 --> 01:52:48.256
The maternal age and paternal age are all also associated.

01:52:48.576 --> 01:52:51.417
And so it's not going to be one thing.

01:52:51.597 --> 01:52:52.957
I think when RFK Jr.

01:52:53.298 --> 01:52:58.539
points to the notion that he's going to find it out, I think he already knows what he's going to find.

01:52:58.599 --> 01:53:02.841
And that's been his bias for the last 20 years, that it's vaccines that cause autism.

01:53:03.982 --> 01:53:04.242
Nope.

01:53:05.123 --> 01:53:07.624
He's not going to find that, and I assure you he's not.

01:53:07.764 --> 01:53:08.244
Here we go.

01:53:08.264 --> 01:53:17.668
I was going to just ask you, how can he say he'll find it in four months if it's taken so long by so many researchers to get clues?

01:53:18.028 --> 01:53:20.809
But, well, you just said it's vaccines, right?

01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:21.870
I think

01:53:22.726 --> 01:53:45.420
What he's going to do, I assume it's going to take him, whatever, four or five months to look behind the curtain at the FDA, look behind the curtain at the CDC, and be amazed at the fact that here was all these data, here were all these data, that in fact showed that it was vaccines, and that the government was hiding it all along, and that the pharmaceutical company was hiding it all along.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:54:00.892
Make sure you understand that Brian Hooker's story is the CDC covered up data that the CDC could have released that showed that one of the shots or some shot was causing autism in black boys.

01:54:04.155 --> 01:54:08.338
This is an appeal to all Americans to understand that we are under attack.

01:54:09.673 --> 01:54:24.548
and the likely narrative that is going to be sprung upon us in September that is not only is the vaccine schedule been kind of malevolent and covered up that they're hurting kids, but it hurts black boys more than white boys.

01:54:25.108 --> 01:54:29.673
It's going to be a racially tinted conclusion.

01:54:31.516 --> 01:54:37.381
And Brian Hooker may even be the guy who goes out on the podium and says, you know, thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:54:37.421 --> 01:54:38.702
for finally telling the truth.

01:54:39.202 --> 01:54:44.766
And the whistleblower that I recorded all those years ago told me that they hid data about black boys.

01:54:44.826 --> 01:54:47.749
And now America explodes.

01:54:53.933 --> 01:54:55.454
Please help us.

01:54:56.601 --> 01:55:01.145
But now that he's head of HHS, he's been able to reveal that.

01:55:01.405 --> 01:55:10.672
And I think if he does that, it is going to be enormously destructive to not just the perception of vaccines, but for the availability of vaccines, the affordability of vaccines.

01:55:11.033 --> 01:55:18.178
And he will make vaccines more feared and will only worsen the situation now in this country, which is the experience of a massive measles epidemic.

01:55:18.198 --> 01:55:20.080
And also pertussis is on the rise.

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.342
Pertussis deaths in this country are on the rise.

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:27.384
all because of this basically fear of vaccines, unfounded fear of vaccines.

01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:29.946
Now, I want you to understand what I'm trying to say to you.

01:55:31.026 --> 01:55:38.810
And Mark Kulak made a very apt analogy by just citing something that Louis C.K.

01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:47.375
said, which is that, you know, you can laugh at people when they go to extremes to try and stop abortion.

01:55:48.379 --> 01:55:57.168
but if you understand that they believe abortion is killing babies, then their actions don't seem so crazy anymore.

01:55:57.308 --> 01:56:05.556
If you think that vaccines are poisoning babies before birth, and you get a little excited about it, I think that would be okay.

01:56:07.856 --> 01:56:10.719
If you think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:56:10.979 --> 01:56:30.076
is injuring lots of people by allowing measles outbreaks to occur, to allow pertussis deaths in hospitals to go up, then you might be just as motivated as somebody who bombs an abortion clinic.

01:56:31.630 --> 01:56:38.711
Because Paul Offit is telling you that kids are dying because of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that people are being put in danger.

01:56:38.751 --> 01:56:43.392
Immunocompromised people are being put in danger because of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:56:43.492 --> 01:56:47.233
and his years and years of spreading this misinformation.

01:56:50.054 --> 01:56:56.935
And so it's gonna be pretty easy to understand if you have any empathy for why some people on the left might soon lose their mind.

01:56:57.856 --> 01:57:07.065
if this narrative continues to progress in the direction it's going, while the direction on our side of social media progresses in the opposite direction.

01:57:08.646 --> 01:57:17.234
And both sides are blissfully unaware that neither side can see the other, like a Lollapalooza of liars with multiple stages.

01:57:20.157 --> 01:57:22.800
But if data existed,

01:57:23.982 --> 01:57:25.322
implicating vaccines in autism.

01:57:25.362 --> 01:57:26.243
They would have been published.

01:57:27.163 --> 01:57:30.164
It's not in the way of American science to hide such a big deal, right?

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:31.264
Right.

01:57:31.304 --> 01:57:40.687
Well, I mean, so in 1998, the notion was brought up by a British researcher named Andrew Wakefield that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine caused autism.

01:57:41.047 --> 01:57:41.748
You could argue.

01:57:41.948 --> 01:57:52.311
Is it possible to explain his use and citation of Andrew Wakefield in the history of this as just the way things worked out?

01:57:54.392 --> 01:57:58.175
When Andrew Wakefield has a paper with Peter Daszak about measles?

01:57:59.015 --> 01:58:11.223
When Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy went through the whole exercise of trying to bring autism awareness 10 years before they tried to bring vaxxed autism awareness in the movie?

01:58:14.245 --> 01:58:15.586
And now are millionaires?

01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:24.072
Foreigners in America in front of the Senate

01:58:26.983 --> 01:58:29.604
Foreigners at the head of DITRA.

01:58:30.204 --> 01:58:32.205
Foreigners at the head of U.S.

01:58:32.425 --> 01:58:32.765
Emirate.

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:36.327
Foreigners at the head of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories.

01:58:39.048 --> 01:58:45.090
Foreigners getting grants in China to sample things.

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.221
The nicest thing you could say was he raised the hypothesis.

01:58:53.542 --> 01:58:55.062
Well, it was a testable hypothesis.

01:58:55.303 --> 01:58:59.825
There had been 24 studies, 24 looking retrospectively at children.

01:58:59.865 --> 01:59:19.856
There have been so many studies and yet all these smart people with all these tenure track positions, all of these multiple appointments at multiple hospitals and multiple committees, multiple chairmanship positions, 20 years of grant application success.

01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:24.412
None of them can come up with the idea that I'm about to tell you.

01:59:25.632 --> 01:59:29.574
Couldn't come up with, all these 24 studies are stupid.

01:59:30.035 --> 01:59:33.176
All the hundreds of studies that have ever been cited are dumb.

01:59:33.817 --> 01:59:41.741
All these studies and comparisons that are here in the Vaxxed, Anti-Vaxxed, Vaxxed, No-Vaxxed are all dumb.

01:59:42.962 --> 01:59:44.983
How in the world can I make that statement?

01:59:46.641 --> 01:59:52.426
All the ideas that Aaron Seery and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:52.466 --> 02:00:05.336
and Mary Holland with her big law degree in 10 years, with his big law degree in 10 years, with Aaron Seery's big law degree in 10 years, none of them have been able to solve this little conundrum.

02:00:06.377 --> 02:00:07.658
It's just a standoff.

02:00:08.058 --> 02:00:11.541
I guess they're right and we're right.

02:00:11.821 --> 02:00:13.402
I can't figure out a way out.

02:00:13.863 --> 02:00:15.084
He's so smart.

02:00:19.069 --> 02:00:24.613
who did or didn't get the MMR vaccine, controlling for confounding variables, and they all found the same thing.

02:00:25.073 --> 02:00:26.814
So there's two ways to interpret those data.

02:00:27.354 --> 02:00:31.157
One, the reasonable way, which is the reason that all these researchers couldn't find that,

02:00:31.972 --> 02:00:34.233
association was because it wasn't there to be found.

02:00:34.613 --> 02:00:35.633
Or RFK Jr.'

02:00:35.613 --> 02:00:44.536
's way, which is that there's a vast international conspiracy involving hundreds of researchers, all sort of in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry or the governments, to hide the truth.

02:00:44.596 --> 02:00:46.036
But he's going to find the truth.

02:00:46.596 --> 02:00:47.697
And that's what scares me.

02:00:48.217 --> 02:00:54.359
He is appealing to something in this country that's very real, which is this notion that we're not really getting the right information.

02:00:54.679 --> 02:00:59.180
I mean, I got an email from a nurse, actually, who said she was seeing a one-month-old,

02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:04.702
the one month old was going to be getting vaccines at two months of age.

02:01:04.722 --> 02:01:08.063
So, she was explaining to the parents what to expect in terms of vaccines.

02:01:08.463 --> 02:01:14.585
And the father said, and I quote, I'm not anti-vaccine, but I'm going to wait to hear which vaccines Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:14.625 --> 02:01:15.906
recommends before I get them.

02:01:17.186 --> 02:01:17.946
Oh, my gosh.

02:01:19.027 --> 02:01:19.707
This is great.

02:01:19.747 --> 02:01:23.188
And a lawyer, you're going to wait till a lawyer tells you what vaccines to get.

02:01:24.409 --> 02:01:25.269
What have we come to?

02:01:26.857 --> 02:01:31.940
We have come to a place where we have been designed to arrive at.

02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:42.806
We have come to a place that the script has brought us, and it is a script that was already out there from the moment that the Vaxxed movie was made.

02:01:42.866 --> 02:01:48.609
The moment on April 1st, 2016, when ICANN was formed.

02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:51.171
Yes, April Fool's Day.

02:01:54.818 --> 02:02:04.413
September relate to the other study that he's going to do to specifically look at vaccines and autism again.

02:02:06.267 --> 02:02:08.208
Something, by the way, that he promised not to do.

02:02:08.548 --> 02:02:16.231
I mean, when Senator Cassidy and Senator Sanders interviewed him for that during that second confirmation hearing, he was pushed on this.

02:02:16.891 --> 02:02:25.515
And then Cassidy, who's a Republican from Louisiana, said, you know, to do any more studies in this is to just basically waste money.

02:02:26.055 --> 02:02:29.577
And frankly, it isn't fair to children with autism because there are a lot of promising leads.

02:02:29.597 --> 02:02:35.059
Why don't we pursue those instead of pursuing this fruitless, dead-end hypothesis

02:02:35.489 --> 02:02:38.490
that's pretty much been answered.

02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:42.672
I just, he has, he, RFK Jr.

02:02:42.712 --> 02:02:49.814
has this fixed immutable religious like belief that vaccines cause autism and nothing is going to convince him otherwise.

02:02:50.114 --> 02:02:54.356
And he's going to quote unquote find that he was right all along and just further

02:02:55.277 --> 02:02:59.640
make vaccines more difficult to get in this country.

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.483
He's going to do everything he can to destroy the vaccine infrastructure in this country.

02:03:03.523 --> 02:03:08.167
And I don't see why we should expect anything different since this has been who he's been for the last 20 years.

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:10.028
The only difference is now he's in a position.

02:03:10.168 --> 02:03:13.451
He has not been this guy for 20 years.

02:03:13.471 --> 02:03:14.692
You're giving him too much credit.

02:03:15.532 --> 02:03:17.354
It's ridiculous to make policy.

02:03:19.218 --> 02:03:19.459
Okay.

02:03:21.442 --> 02:03:29.115
I don't see what he's going to find unless he makes up data, because there are no data behind the scenes at CDC and FDA that implicate vaccines.

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:29.716
I'm quite sure.

02:03:30.017 --> 02:03:31.259
So, do you think he will make it up?

02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:48.355
Yes, he'll do what he did at the second confirmation hearing when he held up this paper by Mawson and colleagues, which he said was the gold standard paper showing that this Medicaid evaluation in Florida proved that vaccines cause neurodevelopmental delays, including autism.

02:03:48.415 --> 02:03:49.375
But look at that paper.

02:03:49.395 --> 02:03:51.256
First, it was never published in a medical journal.

02:03:51.516 --> 02:03:53.236
It was never published in a scientific journal.

02:03:53.596 --> 02:03:54.777
It was critically flawed.

02:03:55.617 --> 02:04:01.739
You couldn't even tell who got vaccines when or whether they'd gotten them through the Medicaid system or through the Vaccine for Children's program.

02:04:02.299 --> 02:04:03.502
It was never peer-reviewed.

02:04:03.542 --> 02:04:07.208
It was funded by an anti-vaccine group, the National Vaccine Information Center.

02:04:07.749 --> 02:04:09.251
It wasn't a study at all.

02:04:09.392 --> 02:04:11.936
It was so methodologically thought as to be just

02:04:13.158 --> 02:04:17.141
Uninterpretable and nonetheless he held that up as a gold standard study.

02:04:17.221 --> 02:04:17.541
Why?

02:04:17.961 --> 02:04:28.288
Because he believes this to be true no matter how weak the data and that is I think what you're about to see the only difference now is it's going to be under the imprimatur of health and human services.

02:04:28.749 --> 02:04:36.434
Now the one crazy part is is that Paul Offit, Mary Holland, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Aaron Seery, Robert Malone,

02:04:37.304 --> 02:04:48.139
Jay Bhattacharya and any other person you could possibly add to the list has never been able to explain the problem with these two statements.

02:04:50.552 --> 02:04:58.315
No one, not one person on earth that you can find has ever been able to say what they are doing here.

02:04:58.995 --> 02:05:03.277
Why it's suspicious that Paul Offit and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:05:03.697 --> 02:05:08.599
have been having the same dumb argument for so long and what's so dumb about the argument?

02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.201
Everything that Paul Offit is saying in this video makes sense.

02:05:12.822 --> 02:05:22.186
Everything that Aaron Seary says is perfectly valid, that they have not tested in any long-term placebo-controlled double-blind trials.

02:05:23.727 --> 02:05:29.590
So if he agrees with that, and they agree with, why can't we get out of this?

02:05:30.130 --> 02:05:31.131
What's happening here?

02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:39.994
All right, so what's the fellow's name that he's enlisted to do this study?

02:05:42.116 --> 02:05:42.676
David Geyer.

02:05:42.956 --> 02:05:43.517
David Geyer?

02:05:43.677 --> 02:05:43.857
Yeah.

02:05:44.277 --> 02:05:58.969
Okay, so he'll put David Geyer to work, and they'll come up with some scientifically implausible paper, which they purport is the gold standard, another gold standard implicating vaccines and autism.

02:06:02.153 --> 02:06:09.843
If he implies that these data existed already at the FDA and CDC, presumably some people who work there need to open their mouths and speak up, no?

02:06:10.584 --> 02:06:11.525
Or people who've been fired.

02:06:11.946 --> 02:06:13.327
Oh, people need to open their mouths.

02:06:13.367 --> 02:06:18.634
You mean like the whistleblower that knows that it was black boys that Brian Hooker's waiting to reveal?

02:06:18.734 --> 02:06:19.095
That one?

02:06:20.775 --> 02:06:21.375
That would be nice.

02:06:21.415 --> 02:06:33.161
I mean, so David Garrett worked with his father, Mark, who actually recently passed away, and published papers looking really at thimerosal, this ethyl mercury-containing preservative in vaccines, to see whether it was associated with autism.

02:06:33.321 --> 02:06:34.962
And they were horribly done.

02:06:35.002 --> 02:06:40.945
These papers were reviewed by the Institute of Medicine and said to be methodologically flawed, as to be uninterpretable.

02:06:41.585 --> 02:06:43.766
And that's who David Guyer is.

02:06:43.886 --> 02:06:52.089
And so everybody that tries to study this stuff can't seem to design a study that will figure it out.

02:06:52.169 --> 02:06:53.250
It's so weird.

02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:55.591
Polly can't come up with anything.

02:06:55.711 --> 02:06:57.191
Mary can't come up with anything.

02:06:57.752 --> 02:07:04.374
Even Paul Offit can't come up with a simple experiment that would dismiss this argument forever.

02:07:04.534 --> 02:07:05.455
Isn't that weird?

02:07:06.235 --> 02:07:11.376
Paul Offit can only say that, well, we've already proven it, and these studies that they do are dumb.

02:07:11.956 --> 02:07:26.279
But wouldn't it be crazy if there was a very easy study that could be proposed that would answer both questions at once and could be proposed vigorously by either Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:07:27.099 --> 02:07:32.160
or Paul Offit, either Aaron Seery or Tony Fauci?

02:07:33.174 --> 02:07:39.780
And they could propose these experiments to hundreds of thousands of doctors around the United States.

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:45.525
And the doctors around the United States would gladly participate if they're on either side.

02:07:46.766 --> 02:07:56.034
Can you imagine the possibility that some dumb guy like me would come up with an experiment that any doctor would be happy to do?

02:07:57.339 --> 02:08:03.090
any doctor would be happy to do if they believed in Paul Offit or if they believed in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:15.736
Is it possible that some dumb guy like me who just wants to play basketball and teach basic biology could have come up with an experiment that would be proposable by either side?

02:08:16.256 --> 02:08:17.917
Because it's just a good experiment.

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:21.819
And if you really wanted to shut Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:21.899 --> 02:08:24.980
up, Paul Offit, you could propose this experiment.

02:08:25.821 --> 02:08:28.042
And if you wanted to shut Paul Offit up,

02:08:28.482 --> 02:08:30.545
Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:30.585 --> 02:08:35.753
and their wonderful CHD could propose this experiment and shut Paul off it up.

02:08:37.035 --> 02:08:40.660
And doctors on either side would go, wow, that's a great idea.

02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:41.762
I'll participate.

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:56.672
Can you imagine that there's an experiment that would work like that and would work like that and should work like that and will work like that if any of these people, either side, decided to take the language and use it?

02:08:57.373 --> 02:08:58.353
Can you imagine that?

02:08:59.333 --> 02:09:04.095
It's very similar to the cleverness of intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:08.279
And if anybody wanted to beat Paul Offit for real, that's where they'd start.

02:09:09.199 --> 02:09:10.480
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:14.943
If you want to beat Vincent Racaniello in an argument, that's where you start.

02:09:16.484 --> 02:09:17.764
That's why nobody starts there.

02:09:18.885 --> 02:09:27.650
If you wanted to end this argument about the pandemic, you'd always go back to the ridiculousness of PCR as a diagnostic, but none of them ever do.

02:09:29.986 --> 02:09:39.028
And for 15 years, none of them have been able to escape the hamster wheel, which is vaccine testing against a placebo would be unethical.

02:09:40.448 --> 02:09:47.429
Vaccines have never been long-term placebo-controlled, double-blind tested, and neither have the adjuvants.

02:09:48.369 --> 02:09:55.031
And running in this wheel we have been because of Mary Holland and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:09:55.611 --> 02:09:57.331
and Paul Offit.

02:09:59.372 --> 02:10:11.997
and NIH and NIAID and Andrew Wakefield and Peter Daszak and all of these people, they're all the same dumb trap because they could not get out of this.

02:10:13.437 --> 02:10:18.059
They can't propose an experiment that either Paul Offit or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:10:18.079 --> 02:10:18.479
can use.

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.840
That is your homework.

02:10:21.263 --> 02:10:25.889
That should have been your homework for the last 20 years, Polly Tommy.

02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:28.412
The last 15 years, Mary Holland.

02:10:28.432 --> 02:10:31.697
The last 20 years, Anthrax Meryl Nass.

02:10:31.957 --> 02:10:35.502
Any of you people could have come up with this experiment.

02:10:35.522 --> 02:10:39.347
It's so easy, my 12-year-old kid understood it in one pass.

02:10:42.219 --> 02:10:43.039
Anybody got it yet?

02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:44.860
But he's RFK Jr.'

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:52.203
's kind of guy, because he basically goes along with the notion that you can shoehorn data into a hypothesis and make it fit.

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:55.065
And I think that's what we're about to see.

02:10:55.145 --> 02:10:55.785
I could be wrong.

02:10:55.905 --> 02:11:03.409
I mean, it may be that RFK Jr., like any reasonable scientist, has an open mind as to what he might find.

02:11:03.809 --> 02:11:08.791
But I feel what he has is something no scientist should have, which is a non-falsifiable hypothesis.

02:11:10.708 --> 02:11:19.155
All right, so let's say he- A non-falsifiable hypothesis is also an absolute lie.

02:11:20.076 --> 02:11:24.880
Again, because if you have the right hypothesis, all you need is the right experiment.

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:30.824
So he says that there's no experiment that can solve this conundrum.

02:11:31.045 --> 02:11:31.465
Hmm.

02:11:31.645 --> 02:11:37.410
Comes out with some bogus data on associations of vaccines and autism.

02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:38.771
What do you think he will do with that?

02:11:39.807 --> 02:11:42.009
I think he will hold it up as an aha moment.

02:11:42.450 --> 02:11:43.731
Look, look what I found.

02:11:43.791 --> 02:11:45.633
Look what I found when I looked behind the curtain.

02:11:45.673 --> 02:11:46.774
We were right all along.

02:11:47.795 --> 02:11:53.941
And appealing to this enormous sense of conspiracy that we're being told things that aren't true by people who mean to do us harm.

02:11:54.302 --> 02:11:56.224
And there is that sense in this country.

02:11:56.464 --> 02:11:57.345
And I think that

02:11:57.995 --> 02:12:01.097
will do a lot of harm to children in this country.

02:12:01.357 --> 02:12:14.045
That's who the big losers are here, are the children who are going to be caught up in this maelstrom of misinformation that's only going to make parents more fearful and may ultimately make vaccines less affordable.

02:12:14.065 --> 02:12:18.668
What worries me in this is that he can fool around with a vaccine injury compensation program,

02:12:19.108 --> 02:12:24.210
to make it so that vaccines are less protected and are more subject to civil litigation.

02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:34.393
And then we're right back where we were in the early 1980s, before there was the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, when we had 18 companies that made vaccines, and by the end of the decade had four.

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:36.174
This is a fragile market.

02:12:36.694 --> 02:12:46.223
I mean, I think people look at the COVID vaccines as being truly what they were, which was a windfall for Pfizer and Moderna because it was a guaranteed market and it was paid by the federal government.

02:12:46.243 --> 02:12:48.465
But that's not the way it usually works here.

02:12:48.705 --> 02:12:52.248
And vaccines are made by four companies.

02:12:52.388 --> 02:12:57.773
It's less than 10 percent of what they do because vaccines are given once or a few times in a lifetime, not every day.

02:12:57.793 --> 02:13:00.616
So they're never going to compete with drugs like lipid-lowering agents.

02:13:01.216 --> 02:13:04.842
or psychiatric drugs or neurological drugs, and so it's a fragile market.

02:13:04.902 --> 02:13:11.552
I mean, make it more expensive for these companies to make these vaccines, and they'll stop making them, and then where are we?

02:13:11.572 --> 02:13:15.137
Howard Bauchner Do you think he can have MMR delicensed?

02:13:16.417 --> 02:13:17.817
I think he can do much.

02:13:18.358 --> 02:13:21.378
I think he could say, I don't think this vaccine has been studied well enough.

02:13:21.479 --> 02:13:23.959
I mean, the MMR vaccine came out in 1971.

02:13:24.499 --> 02:13:28.421
I mean, he could say, I don't think that you had a long enough study.

02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:30.181
I don't think enough children were studied.

02:13:30.901 --> 02:13:35.163
I don't think you had the right placebo group, not that you could really have a placebo group, because you couldn't.

02:13:35.243 --> 02:13:36.503
I mean, you had a measles vaccine.

02:13:37.023 --> 02:13:40.145
By 1968, you had a mumps vaccine in 67.

02:13:40.185 --> 02:13:41.746
You had a rubella vaccine in 69.

02:13:42.026 --> 02:13:44.748
Those were combined to be a single vaccine in 1971.

02:13:45.208 --> 02:13:47.530
Was the MMR vaccine tested against placebo?

02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:48.390
Of course it wasn't.

02:13:48.591 --> 02:13:50.172
It wouldn't have been an ethical thing to do.

02:13:50.532 --> 02:13:56.796
You knew that those three vaccines work, so when you combine them, you can't do a placebo-controlled trial, which is what he's always asking for.

02:13:57.901 --> 02:14:04.907
And so there it is, succinctly stated by Paul Offit, that the real conundrum here is that, you know, they weren't tested against placebos.

02:14:05.127 --> 02:14:06.929
Obviously, Aaron Seery's right.

02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:14.715
These vaccines weren't tested against placebo because we already had a working measles vaccination.

02:14:15.156 --> 02:14:23.022
And so the whole idea of testing these against placebos would be unethical because then you're not protecting those children with a proven vaccine.

02:14:23.923 --> 02:14:26.065
This is the exact place

02:14:27.438 --> 02:14:41.024
that we have been, the exact place that we have been since Mary Holland appeared on Democracy Now in 2015, opposite Paul Offit, who made the exact same argument.

02:14:42.084 --> 02:14:54.270
No progress in 10 years, despite millions of dollars in donations, hundreds of hours of podcasts, conferences and meetings,

02:14:55.999 --> 02:14:58.320
No progress and no people saved.

02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:01.421
And no solutions and no answers.

02:15:02.001 --> 02:15:04.322
And no experiment proposed.

02:15:08.343 --> 02:15:08.943
He could do that.

02:15:09.463 --> 02:15:14.625
There was a former HHS secretary who said, I can't believe the power I have with the stroke of a pen.

02:15:16.205 --> 02:15:21.267
So he could demand another clinical trial of MMR?

02:15:23.309 --> 02:15:28.975
although he couldn't ever demand the kind of trial he's always asking for, which is a placebo-controlled trial.

02:15:29.075 --> 02:15:32.498
He can never demand a placebo-controlled trial.

02:15:32.558 --> 02:15:33.980
He can never do it.

02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:35.001
Hear it, hear it.

02:15:35.522 --> 02:15:36.683
He can never do it.

02:15:37.463 --> 02:15:39.505
for vaccines that you already know work.

02:15:39.785 --> 02:15:40.626
You can't do that.

02:15:40.726 --> 02:15:41.927
It's not ethical to do that.

02:15:41.967 --> 02:15:44.349
You can't give children no vaccine.

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:54.937
If you do that, then you're right where you were with Samoa when you had 83 children die, or where you are now, where you've had three people die, two of whom are healthy young children, because their parents chose not to vaccinate them.

02:15:55.497 --> 02:15:57.339
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to end it right here.

02:15:58.447 --> 02:16:08.312
You don't need a long-term placebo-controlled trial to test whether intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dangerous.

02:16:08.352 --> 02:16:09.152
You don't need that.

02:16:10.433 --> 02:16:15.015
You can give everybody their vaccine, and you can give everybody a placebo.

02:16:15.696 --> 02:16:20.098
You can just separate the vaccine and the placebo by about three or four weeks.

02:16:22.116 --> 02:16:23.377
Everybody gets two shots.

02:16:23.397 --> 02:16:28.561
You just don't know which one was which, and you unblinded after both shots have been given.

02:16:29.442 --> 02:16:47.475
Now, Paul Offit gets everybody their vaccine within a month, and they get their placebo-controlled trial, and anybody that shows any symptoms at all in the first four weeks after intramuscular injection will inevitably be in the live injection group.

02:16:48.937 --> 02:16:49.437
Game over.

02:16:50.407 --> 02:16:59.009
The only way that trial could fail is if they gave placebos to the people that were supposed to get a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting their immune system.

02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:19.154
Any doctor that believed in vaccines could easily see that that will solve the problem, that will answer the question, and whether you believe in vaccines or you don't believe in vaccines, that's a pretty easy way to figure it out, and it's especially enticing to the people who believe.

02:17:20.205 --> 02:17:34.051
It's an especially awesome way for somebody like Paul Offit or anybody else who wanted to be super smart to dunk on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to dunk on all these people, because remember, Mary Holland's kid

02:17:35.077 --> 02:17:36.178
regressed rapidly.

02:17:36.598 --> 02:17:40.661
Remember that Pauly Tommy's kid regressed rapidly.

02:17:41.022 --> 02:17:50.609
That many of the parents in the movie Vaxxed testify to their kid regressing very quickly after their shots.

02:17:53.251 --> 02:17:55.493
You don't need a long-term control trial.

02:17:55.573 --> 02:17:58.335
You don't need a long-term control trial.

02:18:17.086 --> 02:18:25.752
Paul Offit and Mary Holland could have ended this in 2015 by just agreeing that, well, if you're right, Mary, then we can do it this way.

02:18:25.872 --> 02:18:28.314
And if I'm right, Mary, we can do it this way.

02:18:29.095 --> 02:18:30.556
And we'll have the problem solved.

02:18:32.014 --> 02:18:35.917
And instead, those two people have been in front of us for 15 years straight.

02:18:36.017 --> 02:18:36.357
Why?

02:18:36.778 --> 02:18:38.519
Because this is the trap.

02:18:41.261 --> 02:18:42.722
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:18:42.802 --> 02:18:57.253
is in it with us and doesn't understand how shitty of a trap it is and how easy it would be to get out with the help of thousands, if not millions of doctors all around the world, who, whether they believe or not, should gladly participate in such a thing.

02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:03.783
provided that the entire vaccine schedule in America isn't inundated with placebo.

02:19:08.926 --> 02:19:11.588
Paul Offit could have won years ago.

02:19:13.409 --> 02:19:15.410
It's not a very complicated experiment.

02:19:15.490 --> 02:19:16.931
I'm not some kind of genius.

02:19:17.011 --> 02:19:18.512
It's so simple, it's a joke.

02:19:22.205 --> 02:19:25.552
And since 2015, no one's come up with it at all.

02:19:25.973 --> 02:19:29.120
None of these brilliant lawyers that used to work for Goldman Sachs.

02:19:30.137 --> 02:19:52.685
None of these lawyers that used to fight pollution, none of these lawyers who spoke out from my faculty position at Columbia have ever been able to figure out that if my son or my daughter was injured in the first couple weeks after the shot and showed it like hours later, just started headbanging hours later, then the autism that CHD is fighting about is not a long-term effect.

02:19:53.465 --> 02:19:54.726
Maybe allergies are.

02:19:55.686 --> 02:19:57.647
Maybe all these other consequences are.

02:19:59.602 --> 02:20:08.305
but the turbo diarrhea against the wall, the verbal regression over a few days, these are not long-term side effects.

02:20:08.325 --> 02:20:11.527
You don't need a long-term trial to find those.

02:20:11.567 --> 02:20:22.431
A short-term placebo-controlled trial could be done where all the kids got their appropriate vaccines, and that would test the short-term side effects of intramuscular injection as medicine.

02:20:23.476 --> 02:20:30.238
And there's no way in hell that these people who knew Brandy Vaughn and took pictures with her could have not thought of this.

02:20:31.559 --> 02:20:33.379
I'm surprised Brandy didn't think of it.

02:20:38.741 --> 02:20:50.745
Sure, wait 60 days in between, and now you're all of a sudden giving Paul Offit the argument that he wants, which is, oh, that's too much time for them to be vulnerable to pertussis, or too much time for them to be vulnerable to rotavirus.

02:20:52.286 --> 02:20:52.926
That's the trick.

02:20:54.261 --> 02:20:56.210
That's why we have to do short term stuff.

02:20:56.974 --> 02:20:57.637
My daughter.

02:21:05.529 --> 02:21:20.859
Ladies and gentlemen, they could talk if they wanted to, they could tell you the truth that all these companies have all these military operations have our synthetic recombinant genetics, they can make a lot of DNA, they can put it in places and it might have effects, they can transform and transfect things.

02:21:20.899 --> 02:21:22.060
And that's about all they can do.

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:25.402
And most of the time they probably use bacteriophages

02:21:27.383 --> 02:21:31.406
PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud, and I'll never tell you that.

02:21:31.827 --> 02:21:39.513
They could just have put the sequence they wanted to find in the hands of their agent in Wuhan, and the rest is just a spectacular commitment to lies.

02:21:40.614 --> 02:21:42.596
Because truly healthy people don't get sick.

02:21:44.295 --> 02:22:00.049
Transfection and transformation was a crime and anybody that could have told you these words and explained what they meant and differentiated them from a traditional vaccine is part of this traitorous anti-vax fake movement of health freedom.

02:22:01.751 --> 02:22:10.639
The likely reason why they get away with it in America with such an atrocious vaccine schedule is because the vast majority of those vaccines are probably placebo.

02:22:17.052 --> 02:22:18.333
Endemicity is a lie.

02:22:18.433 --> 02:22:24.776
Please teach your kids about, you know, that there's a background of bacteria and archaea and phages.

02:22:25.057 --> 02:22:39.925
And that background is so dense and so ridiculously immeasurable that to measure a PCR test of a coronavirus on that background is absurd without like 500 controls to show that it's not part of it.

02:22:41.346 --> 02:22:43.207
And we have allowed them to get away with it.

02:22:43.507 --> 02:22:45.288
These people are getting away with it.

02:22:45.956 --> 02:22:48.156
And RNA cannot pandemic, dammit.

02:22:49.637 --> 02:22:53.238
I'm sorry, but this is frustrating because it's here now.

02:22:53.298 --> 02:23:00.419
We've got them, and we have the experiment that they could have proposed 10 years ago, and for some reason, none of these brainiacs have ever come up with it.

02:23:01.279 --> 02:23:14.182
That's because they are making sure that our children don't realize that RNA cannot pandemic, that intramuscular injection is dumb, that transfecting healthy people was always a crime, and the population pyramid is a problem that they are managing actively now.

02:23:21.601 --> 02:23:22.782
Thank you very much for being here.

02:23:22.842 --> 02:23:26.847
I hope to see you again soon and with more love than I can possibly project.

02:23:27.968 --> 02:23:28.869
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:23:29.109 --> 02:23:29.470
See you soon.
