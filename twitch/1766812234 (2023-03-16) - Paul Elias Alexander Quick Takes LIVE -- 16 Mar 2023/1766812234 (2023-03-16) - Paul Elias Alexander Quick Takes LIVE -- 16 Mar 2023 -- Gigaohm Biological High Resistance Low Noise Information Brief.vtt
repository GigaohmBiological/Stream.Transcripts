WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.960
All right, as soon as we get somebody in the view in the chat, give me a feedback there

00:09.960 --> 00:17.560
on the synchronous of the video chip.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.680
The sink is now good according to Clarkson who said the sink was off before.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.160
Pamela says the sink is perfect now.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.600
Is that true?

00:25.600 --> 00:31.880
A little off is okay.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.480
A lot of people were saying it was off.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.680
Now we're saying it's on.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.720
Okay, we're on.

00:35.720 --> 00:40.720
So anyway, let's see here.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.000
Where is my friend Alexander?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
What's happening with him?

00:45.000 --> 00:59.760
I might have to send him a message, dude, dude, dude.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.960
I told him I'm live, so it'll put more pressure on him to join right away.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.960
Here we go.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.560
I'm just going to place one, just one little image here.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.600
I'll fade out and I'll do one quick one.

01:13.600 --> 01:42.600
He's on his way.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
Here we go.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.480
Got this figured out now.

01:45.480 --> 01:51.000
Very short introduction and we'll have Paul, Alexander on for a real quick take.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.800
Thanks again, Greg and Rodney and everybody who supports the stream.

01:53.800 --> 01:58.720
Like I said, I could not have gotten here without you guys.

01:58.720 --> 02:06.320
And it is really just a few people who took a risk on me, just a few people who stuck their

02:06.320 --> 02:13.320
neck out that got me this far and every one of you, thanks.

02:13.320 --> 02:27.880
Oh, I heard somebody.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.400
I heard somebody who I was supposed to push out and then here.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
Yes, sir.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
Yes, sir.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
Yeah, I'm Paul.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
Paul here.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
I'm Rachel.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
All right.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.880
So listen, I'm going to start my recording.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.920
You could do yours.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.280
I have a meeting starting around 12 or 5 or so, 12, 10.

02:47.280 --> 02:53.160
So I just want me to have a casual conversation of what we're trying to say.

02:53.160 --> 02:59.240
And if you don't mind, this time I want you to introduce yourself and a little bit of

02:59.240 --> 03:02.040
your background to my background quickly again.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.360
I want to just do our 50,000 foot few lines.

03:05.360 --> 03:11.880
And then I want us to get into what it is we are trying to see, which is that we want

03:11.880 --> 03:17.160
people to look behind the curtain a little bit and try to begin to think about what it

03:17.160 --> 03:22.800
has happened here, not necessarily why we'll focus on that in the future, but what?

03:22.800 --> 03:32.680
And I will show out to you how about this, each issue, meaning J virus in the beginning

03:32.680 --> 03:39.360
manufactured or natural J lockdowns work for didn't work J and I'll give you my view

03:39.360 --> 03:40.920
and then you give me your view.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.920
Perfect.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.920
How about that?

03:42.920 --> 03:43.920
Perfect.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.920
Good.

03:44.920 --> 03:51.240
So I'm going to start now recording in progress.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
Hi, folks.

03:52.240 --> 03:57.480
Once again, this is Dr. Paul Alexander and I have the pleasure of dealing with Jay Kui

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
again.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.440
Jay, can I refer to you as Dr. Kui?

04:01.440 --> 04:05.200
You can also refer to me as Jay, whatever you feel comfortable with.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.000
You could always call me Paul.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay, very good.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.560
We have developed a quick, nice friendship.

04:11.560 --> 04:18.080
I think you've stunned me in the sense of your academic depth and breadth and your grasp

04:18.080 --> 04:22.240
for all of the issues that we've been dealing with for three years, many in the Freedom

04:22.240 --> 04:27.920
Fighter group, many of the scientists and doctors that I work with, do not grasp what

04:27.920 --> 04:30.440
we've dealing with, like how you grasp it.

04:30.440 --> 04:37.160
And that's why I've come towards you because the more I listen to you, the more I read

04:37.160 --> 04:42.800
your work and I unpack it, the more I realize that this guy has studied this, well, you've

04:42.800 --> 04:45.760
brought a lot of years back on to the situation.

04:45.760 --> 04:53.280
So that gives you a very unique insight and I like your personality and your professionalism.

04:53.280 --> 04:58.280
So it is no problem for me to work with you and collaborate.

04:58.280 --> 05:04.320
So we started to talk, right, we did this presentation yesterday, full disclosure, we

05:04.320 --> 05:08.360
dealt with each other before, but we did an official presentation yesterday.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.760
I already put up on sub stack for your listeners, Alexander COVID news.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.640
You put it up on all of your portals.

05:15.640 --> 05:24.360
I put it up on Twitter, GAB, getter, every single channel that people who deal with me

05:24.360 --> 05:25.600
put it up on.

05:25.600 --> 05:34.760
And the response, Jay, is not shocking, but I didn't know that it would have been so well

05:34.840 --> 05:41.320
received that we are challenging people to think in a different way about this.

05:41.320 --> 05:47.360
And again, we are not saying, you are not saying people were wrong and we are not saying

05:47.360 --> 05:48.640
that people were right.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.440
We are saying that we were right and wrong for different reasons too.

05:53.440 --> 06:00.480
And okay, so I'm Dr. Paul Alexander, my background training is in epidemiology, evidence based

06:00.480 --> 06:05.560
medicine, some bioterrorism, et cetera, between Canada, University of Toronto, Oxford

06:05.560 --> 06:09.240
in England, McMaster in Canada.

06:09.240 --> 06:15.120
I did a certificate on the Donald Henderson at Johns Hopkins in bioterrorism.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.600
My work is in infectious disease society of America for about three years, training their

06:20.600 --> 06:26.160
doctors and scientists in how to develop clinical practice guidelines.

06:26.160 --> 06:31.440
I work for WHO, I work for the government of Canada as an epidemiologist, I work for

06:31.440 --> 06:36.800
the government of the United States as a pandemic advisor, and I work for the World Health Organization

06:36.800 --> 06:39.600
as a pandemic consultant advisor.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.400
Jay, can you give us your introduction with a little bit of background for the listeners?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.800
I'm sure I'd be happy to.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.760
So I'm a biologist by training from my bachelor's degree in Chicago.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.000
I was intending on being a doctor, and I applied for medical school after my bachelor's degree

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
five years in a row, and I was always waitlisted on a couple schools in Chicago but never made

07:06.000 --> 07:09.120
it on to the actual roster.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.120
While I was doing that, I was a high school teacher, and I actually fell in love with

07:14.120 --> 07:20.120
teaching while I was treading water to try and apply for medical school every year.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.600
But the financial aspect of teaching got the best of me, and I actually made a lot more

07:24.600 --> 07:27.560
money as a bartender, if you can imagine.

07:27.560 --> 07:33.520
So I took a few years off as a bartender and was just kind of living a life of a 20-something

07:33.520 --> 07:40.280
year old in Chicago, and I made a few bad choices with regard to my responsibilities

07:40.280 --> 07:43.680
at the bar and the owner of the bar, let me go.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.560
So I was forced to find another job, and I actually applied for a job for somebody that

07:48.600 --> 07:54.440
had microscope experience and good hands at the University of Chicago, and a lifelong

07:54.440 --> 08:03.040
friend of mine, Colin Hoam had taught me patch-clamp physiology as a bartender.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.720
And he took me under his wing.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.880
He taught me a lot of methodology, but also a lot of philosophy about how to get my act

08:11.880 --> 08:16.280
together again and how to show up on time and this kind of thing.

08:16.280 --> 08:22.760
And working as a technician at the University of Chicago with him, I met a Harvard Mansfelder

08:22.760 --> 08:27.920
who after he became a professor in the Netherlands invited me to the Netherlands to do my PhD

08:27.920 --> 08:29.480
with him.

08:29.480 --> 08:34.840
And so in about a month, I had gone from not knowing really what I wanted to do to being

08:34.840 --> 08:39.920
offered this, you know, live in the Netherlands for a few years and learn biology and maybe

08:39.920 --> 08:43.120
become a university professor.

08:43.120 --> 08:48.280
And that led me to meeting my wife in the Netherlands, us moving to Norway and working

08:48.280 --> 08:53.600
with Edward and Mabert Moser, where I continued to develop these techniques in more advanced

08:53.600 --> 08:59.080
ways and then tried to go back to the Netherlands and get tenure where I didn't get enough money

08:59.080 --> 09:01.200
as a foreigner to stay.

09:01.200 --> 09:07.200
So my wife moved with me to Pittsburgh here in 2016, where I became a research assistant

09:07.200 --> 09:12.120
professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and I wasn't really able to scratch my teaching

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
itch.

09:13.120 --> 09:19.240
I taught one class at Carnegie Mellon that was okay, but because I had to do all my laboratory

09:19.240 --> 09:23.480
stuff anyway, it wasn't really a nice side job.

09:23.480 --> 09:28.760
And so I started doing a YouTube videos on my bike ride because I was riding my bike

09:28.760 --> 09:33.480
from my house to the University of Pittsburgh every day, which was about nine miles.

09:33.480 --> 09:39.360
And this was a journal club where I would talk about a neuroscience paper on my bicycle.

09:39.360 --> 09:45.680
And when the COVID pandemic broke out, I did three bike rides that were basically COVID,

09:45.680 --> 09:50.720
not COVID, but coronavirus review bike rides where I talked about lots of papers and the

09:50.720 --> 09:55.720
technology and the molecular biology behind gain of function because I had worked at the

09:55.720 --> 10:03.160
University of Erasmus in the Netherlands when I was there in the early 2012 through 16.

10:03.160 --> 10:09.880
So long story short, I've been an academic biologist for a long time, and I have been

10:09.880 --> 10:17.600
a well-rounded one, and I've been often interested in transitioning to teaching full-time.

10:17.600 --> 10:23.560
I found creating videos quite fun, and once I started making videos about the coronavirus

10:23.560 --> 10:26.560
pandemic, I started to get into a lot of trouble.

10:26.560 --> 10:32.840
I got an email from the media corporation that's tied to the University of Pittsburgh,

10:32.840 --> 10:38.840
and UPMC, which said that they saw that I had made a comment in the Washington Times,

10:38.840 --> 10:44.040
and that they've seen my YouTube channel, and they reminded me that my expertise was

10:44.040 --> 10:45.600
neurobiology.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.520
So I took that as a pretty interesting email, and about three months later, they asked me

10:50.520 --> 10:55.720
to send my badge and keys in because they didn't think it was safe for me to continue

10:55.720 --> 10:57.520
coming to campus.

10:57.520 --> 11:03.240
So then I just kept teaching on the internet and kept trying to learn the stuff that I

11:03.240 --> 11:11.800
hadn't fully mastered, and that led to me eventually getting the attention of Robert

11:11.800 --> 11:17.200
F. Kennedy Jr. and Children's Health Defense, and so now I have a consulting relationship

11:17.200 --> 11:23.120
with them that allows me to make videos and also help them with figuring this out.

11:23.120 --> 11:27.040
So I'm helping them behind the scenes, and I'm also continuing to try and teach as much

11:27.040 --> 11:31.600
as I can online, and I contacted you to give me 15 minutes, and you gave me a little

11:31.600 --> 11:34.080
more time than that, and now here we are.

11:34.080 --> 11:42.240
Well, well, first of all, G is a fascinating story, and again, full disclosure, we talk

11:42.240 --> 11:49.920
a little bit more, and I'm going to know G a little bit more, too, and you know, sometimes

11:49.920 --> 11:56.920
you get very humble by people, and some people that come across initially as very unassuming

11:56.920 --> 12:01.760
in the sense that you don't really understand the depth and the breadth and where they're

12:01.760 --> 12:03.280
coming from.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.960
But as we have spoken, I realize that you have more to offer the world, not just the

12:08.960 --> 12:14.080
United States, but the world and what we're dealing with here, because our problem right

12:14.080 --> 12:17.240
now is we're trying to understand the what.

12:17.240 --> 12:22.040
We're going to get to why people did certain things, because that's very gossipy and nice

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040
too.

12:23.120 --> 12:28.600
We need to figure out what really happened here, and we have a lot of people in the

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
freedom movement.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.560
You know, I work with the giants like Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Harvey Wish, and I even

12:34.560 --> 12:37.600
know Bobby Kennedy well, I didn't several interviews with him.

12:37.600 --> 12:45.520
I think he's one of our advocates out there, and doing a good job in terms of the childhood

12:45.520 --> 12:49.840
vaccines, and I did a nice interview with him a couple months ago that we're still trying

12:49.880 --> 12:54.480
to edit up to put it out there.

12:54.480 --> 13:00.280
The people who published my book also published his book, Sky Horse, so we have a lot of things

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
in common.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.920
I'm glad that you're getting some support.

13:03.920 --> 13:08.080
I just want to see, because when I'm done, I'm putting this on sub-stack, I'm putting

13:08.080 --> 13:15.040
this on Getter, Gab, Twitter everywhere, that channel, what do you call telegram?

13:15.040 --> 13:20.840
And I would ask all my people, people who follow me, and look, I know this has become

13:20.840 --> 13:25.240
an incestuous thing, and everybody have their own people who follows you.

13:25.240 --> 13:30.160
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, support Jay.

13:30.160 --> 13:37.280
Find a way to support this guy, find his site, Jay, what's the, what's the address?

13:37.280 --> 13:44.680
It's giggleombiological.com, which is I know a pretty lame amount of words, but it's on

13:44.680 --> 13:48.800
the site they're watching now, and you really don't need to worry too much about that right

13:48.800 --> 13:49.800
now.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.560
I think we should focus on getting this message out.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.520
I really appreciate it.

13:53.520 --> 13:59.920
So listen, so from the beginning, Jay, people like myself, again, the people I'm working

13:59.920 --> 14:07.800
with, people like Avery Brinkley, Ramen Oskwe, we've been out there hammering away.

14:07.800 --> 14:14.720
We even have Dr. Naomi Wolf who joined the fall fighting against the ravages, particularly

14:14.720 --> 14:22.000
Dr. James Thorp, the damages of the mRNA vaccine on the developing child in utero, and the

14:22.000 --> 14:23.240
pregnant woman, et cetera.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.160
So we know we had a big problem.

14:25.160 --> 14:29.400
So from the beginning, we've looked at the science and we saw that no lockdown ever worked,

14:29.400 --> 14:35.160
no school closure, no mask mandate, nothing, no business closure, no shielding, every single

14:35.160 --> 14:39.280
COVID policy failed, and actually harmed and killed people.

14:39.280 --> 14:46.520
And then we were faced with this mRNA DNA platform gene injection, whether it be the

14:46.520 --> 14:50.960
hell you want to call it, that has caused more harm.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.880
And from my point of view, even when you look at the data Pfizer, Madonna submitted to the

14:55.880 --> 15:02.200
FDA, it was actually data that they should have never been given an EU based on a 0% absolute

15:02.200 --> 15:03.600
risk reduction.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.000
So no benefit, yet here we are.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.920
And here's what I want to do, because we did a nice tour, it was actually 2015 minutes,

15:11.920 --> 15:16.560
I put it out, but we're going to do something, I believe, this Sunday again.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.720
But I wanted to just be talk, talk, talk with you.

15:19.720 --> 15:24.680
I'm going to say each issue, I'm going to give you quick and a sentence, my view, and

15:24.680 --> 15:30.480
I want you of you, because my role now is there are a lot of people parading out there

15:30.480 --> 15:32.240
who are not doing what you're doing.

15:32.240 --> 15:37.440
I want to help showcase you, because you have a lot, a lot of common sense and a lot

15:37.440 --> 15:39.120
of scientific depth.

15:39.120 --> 15:45.720
The people need to listen, at least as we say, look behind the curtain or below the rock,

15:45.720 --> 15:51.160
so the phone we are thinking, and you've provoking people into very sophisticated thought now.

15:51.160 --> 15:58.960
So question, my view on the virus in the beginning, I knew, I felt from different people I've

15:58.960 --> 16:05.880
spoken to, some we wouldn't name here for now, but I have felt that this always was

16:05.880 --> 16:09.720
some sort of lab manufactured entity, number one.

16:09.720 --> 16:17.280
I did feel that it was disposed and it could not be a point source, dispersion, it had

16:17.280 --> 16:22.640
to be based on what we are seeing, a multiple sort of a release.

16:22.640 --> 16:30.880
I believe multiple labs always felt, and what I also believe is that this is function

16:30.880 --> 16:35.560
in G, I'm going to use the term, many people keep writing me and calling me and say, Paul,

16:35.560 --> 16:40.200
you know, in your session, you should step back from using that term, still use the term

16:40.200 --> 16:45.680
vaccine or geneogen, no, I'm going to say, I believe it is functioning as a bioweapon.

16:45.680 --> 16:52.520
So can you tell us your view as the lab, multiple, multiple release bioweapon?

16:52.520 --> 16:55.280
Tell us what you think.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.760
If I follow the tenant that got me this far, it is that we have to stick to the biology

16:59.760 --> 17:01.880
we can know for sure.

17:01.880 --> 17:08.440
And in that case, the reason why I believe it has to be a laboratory manufactured clone

17:08.440 --> 17:14.400
is because the molecular signal that we are told was found in all these disparate places

17:14.440 --> 17:21.080
in the world could not have been created by a number of infected people landing in these

17:21.080 --> 17:24.760
places as would be expected from a point release.

17:24.760 --> 17:32.020
The best case scenario couldn't produce this, but how it exactly occurred, like how it was

17:32.020 --> 17:40.680
done is going to be a lot harder to show because we can't prove the molecular, the presence

17:40.720 --> 17:47.200
of the molecular signature being the cause of the symptomology that's correlating with

17:47.200 --> 17:48.200
it.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.280
Now, what I'm saying is, again, that these tests aren't capable of doing that, even though

17:52.280 --> 17:56.640
the correlation is very high in Italy and in Washington and New York at the beginning

17:56.640 --> 18:03.600
with the same kind of severe symptoms, we should be very careful not to overextend and

18:03.600 --> 18:06.640
say that, well, it has to be this or it has to be that.

18:06.640 --> 18:14.000
The only thing we really need to say for sure is that a natural virus escaping from

18:14.000 --> 18:21.120
a building or infecting a lab worker or even infecting a hundred lab workers is not capable

18:21.120 --> 18:23.560
of generating a three year pandemic.

18:23.560 --> 18:29.760
The only way that we could get this uniform of a signal in this many people simultaneously

18:29.760 --> 18:33.560
is some application of a synthetic agent.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.560
That's all I can.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.240
That's about as far as I would go.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.240
Synthetic agent.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.240
Exactly.

18:39.240 --> 18:44.520
As in the sense of a purified viral clone, that's what I mean by a synthetic agent.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
Yes.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.280
So we're talking about something man made.

18:47.280 --> 18:54.360
Can you in two or three sentences tell the viewer, I understand what the clone is and

18:54.360 --> 19:00.480
what we're talking about here in terms of taking the mRNA to DNA, making multiple copies,

19:00.480 --> 19:08.920
et cetera, extracting the mRNA and can you, because I realize you have a certain expertise

19:08.920 --> 19:13.720
in this area also, tell the viewer what you mean by clone.

19:13.720 --> 19:27.080
In the wild RNA viruses exist as an assortment of closely related but non-identical genomes.

19:27.080 --> 19:35.400
In other words, the story that they've told you about variants is actually a gross oversimplification

19:35.400 --> 19:37.360
of what's happening.

19:37.360 --> 19:45.640
If there is a viral entity which is infecting you, it makes imperfect copies of itself and

19:45.640 --> 19:52.160
as a result, you have to make an approximation of what all that genetic material adds up

19:52.160 --> 19:56.360
to and that's what they call a viral sequence.

19:56.360 --> 20:01.400
In the wild, when they look for coronaviruses in bats or when they look for coronaviruses

20:01.400 --> 20:03.840
in pangolins, that's what they're looking for.

20:03.840 --> 20:09.600
They're looking for a genetic shadow which they can reassemble and once they reassemble

20:09.600 --> 20:15.040
it into this genome, in order for them to study it usefully in the laboratory, they need

20:15.040 --> 20:21.760
to use reverse genetics to convert it to DNA so that they can amplify it into enough copies

20:21.760 --> 20:27.440
so that they can use it in the laboratory as something that will cause plaque assays

20:27.440 --> 20:32.280
or cause an animal to get sick.

20:32.280 --> 20:38.000
The only way that they've been able to make coronaviruses and in fact many other RNA viruses

20:38.000 --> 20:44.920
tractable from a laboratory perspective is to use reverse genetics to convert the RNA

20:44.920 --> 20:51.200
sequence that they can find in the wild into a DNA molecule so that they can make enough

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
of it.

20:52.200 --> 21:01.680
Correct, so in other words, in other words, when you look at it from that point of view,

21:01.680 --> 21:06.720
I would say then that I want to jump forward because there are a couple of questions I

21:06.720 --> 21:08.280
want us on record.

21:08.280 --> 21:16.400
PCR tests, my own analysis, I remember when I was in the Trump administration, Dr. Atlas

21:16.400 --> 21:21.760
and me, we had collaborated to produce, try to understand what would be cycle thresholds

21:21.760 --> 21:27.360
and the limits in terms of finding infectious, cultural, viable virus.

21:27.360 --> 21:32.840
From my point of view, my definition of that means virus that could infect you and cause

21:32.840 --> 21:38.920
pathology and we found when we looked at the literature that our own 24 to 25 cycles with

21:38.920 --> 21:41.960
the RTPCR test was the limit.

21:41.960 --> 21:48.800
Of that, you are now talking about non-infectious, non-lethal pathogen and that was what was

21:48.800 --> 21:53.800
omitted in the PCR test that we did not know the cycle threshold, we won't do that and

21:53.800 --> 22:00.320
more importantly, the reality about it is that we are not saying that when you get a

22:00.320 --> 22:06.040
positive test, when we use it to enforce positive, I don't necessarily mean that it is wrong,

22:06.040 --> 22:12.000
false positive that you are actually positive, et cetera, but you're not positive when they're

22:12.000 --> 22:13.840
saying you are positive.

22:13.840 --> 22:20.680
What we are saying is it is not that particular coronavirus now or it is not detecting positivity

22:20.680 --> 22:26.520
today, you were infected with the likely coronavirus in the past.

22:26.520 --> 22:31.120
What is your view on the PCR test?

22:31.120 --> 22:36.040
I've been trying to come up with a number of different analogies.

22:36.040 --> 22:44.240
There are multiple ways that the PCR test can result in a bad answer and the question

22:44.240 --> 22:52.040
is did they manipulate the use of it or the application of it to increase the false positives,

22:52.040 --> 23:01.040
which are the ones that would help any pandemic go from controllable to a hypothetical emergency.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.440
From my perspective, there's two ways they can do it.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.640
The first one is the obvious one that everybody understands, which is that they could cycle

23:09.640 --> 23:16.560
it long enough so that the very process itself becomes erroneous, it generates the fluorescence

23:16.560 --> 23:22.080
in some other erroneous way and reading the diagnostic, you get a fluorescence signal so

23:22.080 --> 23:26.840
you say it's positive, but if you were to ever look at that sample, you would find that

23:26.840 --> 23:31.360
the amplicons that were amplified would be the incorrect ones, but they don't have

23:31.360 --> 23:38.120
that built into this system so once the test is glowing, they just say it's a positive

23:38.120 --> 23:44.640
and that's the problem with cycling to 55 cycles or even 45 cycles is way too far.

23:44.640 --> 23:52.920
On the background of that is this implication that PCR is so good and the background is

23:52.920 --> 24:00.640
composed of nothing that could also be amplified and that's an illusion because most coronaviruses

24:00.640 --> 24:07.520
at the end protein and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase have a homologous protein there.

24:07.520 --> 24:12.160
So if you're looking for three amplicons, the spike, the RNA dependent polymerase and

24:12.160 --> 24:18.720
the end protein, most if not all coronaviruses that we would ever study in nature will have

24:18.720 --> 24:24.680
two of those proteins homologous and the high likelihood of testing positive at those

24:24.680 --> 24:30.400
two amplicons just like SARS-CoV-2 is purported to do so.

24:30.400 --> 24:35.680
So on that background it really depends on whether you require the spike or whether you

24:35.680 --> 24:41.080
accept two out of the three as being a positive which is a lot of these products did and in

24:41.080 --> 24:47.320
that case any coronavirus in the background could contribute to the overall appearance

24:47.320 --> 24:52.400
of the spread of this novel pathogen when in reality the test is unable to separate

24:52.400 --> 24:57.960
the novelty from the background except for on one protein, this spike.

24:57.960 --> 25:05.320
Yes, I like that explanation because people like more call on myself we had written and

25:05.320 --> 25:08.080
we had all due day one.

25:08.080 --> 25:14.520
Maybe two to three weeks out of the box early in 2020 that this idea of asymptomatic transmission.

25:14.520 --> 25:18.560
I want to use the word that it was a lie I would say it was a falsehood and we were

25:18.560 --> 25:27.360
looking at papers out of China made well also a good paper in JAMA that showed the term

25:27.360 --> 25:33.960
that the asymptomatic transmission was not a real viable issue and they were using that

25:33.960 --> 25:40.960
to scare the population into lockdown and just paranoia similar to the we were even looking

25:40.960 --> 25:47.840
at recurrent infections pre-omocron era and we were not finding bonafide recurrent infections

25:47.840 --> 25:53.920
now that is pre-omocron we understand that almost a different animal you know with enough

25:53.920 --> 25:59.080
changes on the antigen etc all of those mutations so it's like your immune system is seen something

25:59.080 --> 26:03.520
different but but again that's getting too much into all biochemistry right now we are

26:03.520 --> 26:09.920
still talking about what so so I don't want people to get our interview and our discussions

26:09.920 --> 26:14.960
that oh my god dr. Alexander these guys were working on early treatment these guys are the

26:14.960 --> 26:20.000
gurus of early treatment what are they trying to say when he says nothing worked well from

26:20.000 --> 26:31.240
my point of view if what we are trying to table up is that is that that that the pathology

26:31.240 --> 26:37.960
really was from the initial release the initial exposure particularly vulnerable people to

26:37.960 --> 26:48.160
the clone that that from there what was released behaved as it would as a as a as as a normal

26:48.160 --> 26:55.000
pathogen and stabilize and become milder in the environment and using your analogy a study and

26:55.000 --> 27:06.600
your explanation less purity or less concentration that really and truly this COVID gene injection

27:06.920 --> 27:13.320
from all of those people involved in its development they must have known that this could not have

27:13.320 --> 27:21.240
worked this my point is how I'm looking at it because because this was so benign to begin with

27:21.240 --> 27:26.200
and that and that makes sense when you look at the Pfizer Moderna data that they could only find

27:26.200 --> 27:34.200
an absolute benefit of less than one percent because how could you find a decrease when the

27:34.280 --> 27:40.840
baseline risk in your control group is almost zero you can't find less than zero you will have

27:40.840 --> 27:49.800
to actually sample the entire world that's the issue so so your view on that well I agree and I

27:49.800 --> 27:54.440
think that the I think that the main theater that they knew they were going to play from the very

27:54.440 --> 28:00.440
beginning was that the effectiveness of the drug or the effectiveness of the therapeutic would be

28:00.440 --> 28:05.320
based largely on the appearance of antibodies that's why they stressed it so early there was

28:05.320 --> 28:11.800
even a song on Saturday Night Live where they said i-m-n-u-n-i-t-y that's what I got bodies

28:11.800 --> 28:18.920
anti it was part of a song and they did it all over on late night television so that even when

28:18.920 --> 28:26.280
the numbers came out and people would object and say well the absolute risk was almost minuscule

28:26.280 --> 28:32.280
you're using relative risk reduction just to make it sound better this is lame they could say

28:32.280 --> 28:38.840
well look we've got this beautiful antibody signal I mean it's extraordinary and they sold that

28:38.840 --> 28:44.920
is sold it on that every time to the FDA and and to these these committees that approve their

28:45.480 --> 28:53.880
their EUA so to me again it just kind of all goes along with this idea that there was a waiting

28:54.520 --> 29:04.040
a waiting plan which which was going to do this shift into into focusing on mRNA based

29:04.600 --> 29:11.320
vaccination and they they went hard for a while and RSV and flu they've backed off a lot now and I

29:11.320 --> 29:16.600
think that's because they're kind of off-script if we would have allowed them to we would already be

29:17.400 --> 29:25.480
RSV flu and COVID RNA shots for everybody if we if if people weren't fighting back I'm pretty sure

29:26.120 --> 29:29.720
that we're pretty far off script at this point and that's what makes it so exciting

29:32.840 --> 29:33.960
oh did you lock up

29:36.680 --> 29:45.000
shoot what happened they interfered with us am I still streaming darn it

29:46.600 --> 29:51.400
what happened I think it fools oh there you go there you go you're back now

29:51.400 --> 29:57.160
yeah about the RSV you got to the RSV yeah so I think if we would not have pushed back last year

29:57.160 --> 30:04.760
there were already plans to have an RSV a flu and a pneumonia mRNA vaccine there's an mRNA

30:04.760 --> 30:11.640
vaccine in the works for shingles and I think right now they're they're stalling back a little bit

30:11.640 --> 30:17.560
their original plan was to bowl us over I mean and and and this this pivot was going to be

30:17.560 --> 30:23.080
something that they sold as wow isn't it great how we just stumbled into this new technology and

30:23.080 --> 30:29.240
it was right there ready and waiting for us so that we are really off-script for them I think

30:29.240 --> 30:34.920
right now and so we have to keep this momentum going exactly and that's why people like you I

30:34.920 --> 30:40.040
mean we've been we've been willing and I've realized you were doing serious lifting behind the scenes

30:40.040 --> 30:45.720
and the reality about it is when we look at the mRNA technology itself that was devastating

30:46.360 --> 30:53.960
and the lipid nanoparticle I separated to the mRNA technology that goes into the lipid nanoparticle

30:53.960 --> 31:00.280
both of them to me are when you look at the science are very toxic and together as this complex

31:00.280 --> 31:07.000
it is causing serious you look I just put a paper on substack that showed the term we are finding

31:07.000 --> 31:13.960
two papers one is that the messenger RNA is reversed transcribed they looked at some human

31:13.960 --> 31:21.480
liver cells it's reversed transcribed back into DNA in as quick as six hours that was stunning

31:21.480 --> 31:27.960
that's a serious serious issue if so what do you think of that um kevin mccernan has also shown

31:27.960 --> 31:33.160
though that these shots are at least the bivalent shot is contaminated with the cDNA

31:33.160 --> 31:39.480
plasmid that they use to generate the RNA so they have to make a cDNA clone of the spike protein

31:39.480 --> 31:45.160
in order to generate the mRNA that they put in the shot but they weren't able to separate the cDNA

31:45.160 --> 31:52.120
from the mRNA and so it's about 10 micrograms for every 60 micrograms of mRNA there's 10 micrograms

31:52.120 --> 31:57.720
of the cDNA which includes these are kind of big terms but they include the origin of replication

31:57.720 --> 32:03.640
in bacteria that was used to amplify the cDNA into many copies and they also include a cassette

32:03.640 --> 32:11.160
for um resistance to the antibiotic that the bacteria was used so it may be that that paper is

32:11.160 --> 32:16.680
mistaken that the RNA isn't getting reversed transcribed but this circular DNA is just inserting

32:16.680 --> 32:20.520
directly and they couldn't tell the difference because they didn't realize there was DNA in the

32:20.520 --> 32:25.560
shot when they made that paper so I would suggest that those authors probably have to go back and

32:25.640 --> 32:33.320
look yeah and just for the audience and who the viewers are plasmids are circular DNA

32:33.320 --> 32:39.960
is circular DNA yeah circular DNA yes that's correct correct so listen I want to end this show because

32:39.960 --> 32:46.120
I have another hard interview coming up yes but I wanted because I know me and you and your group

32:46.120 --> 32:51.320
and other people I'm going to get onto that call we are talking on Sunday we're going to pin

32:51.320 --> 32:57.720
long time so I want a lot of people to follow but I wanted to say this that um on the issue of

32:57.720 --> 33:03.640
early treatment I am trying to say based on what we are talking about here is that early treatment

33:04.760 --> 33:12.440
had its role and has its role and is actually critical um but let's see if we could just do a

33:12.440 --> 33:17.080
sentence or two sort of we could try to make those who are listening understand what you're

33:17.080 --> 33:26.280
saying in other words this is my view that the potency of early treatment has more to do with its

33:26.280 --> 33:33.080
role in severe more critical illness more let's say the initial release if you're going with the

33:33.080 --> 33:40.760
multiple release theory the initial release so the more severe pathological clone that caused

33:40.760 --> 33:46.520
more severe illness that is where the early treatment functioned and was ideal in other words

33:47.160 --> 33:51.960
if I'm understanding what we are trying to say on our discussion is that with the mild illness

33:52.680 --> 33:58.840
it is very difficult for these therapeutics to actually have a beneficial effect am I correct

34:01.640 --> 34:08.520
I think that that that to say that they can't have a beneficial effect would be extending it too

34:08.520 --> 34:15.880
far but to say that yes there is much more opportunity for them to have effect on a clone

34:15.880 --> 34:21.720
infection than what I imagine a natural infection would be can I clarify one thing with a picture

34:21.720 --> 34:29.880
here yes please so I'm gonna we are not we are not saying I am look I have right the papers I stand

34:29.880 --> 34:37.240
with people like makala zalenko reach etc I knew the potency of early treatment it does it works

34:37.240 --> 34:43.640
but the question is the question is to extent of how right people were and how wrong

34:45.080 --> 34:49.800
where does it actually in other words what we are saying and I want to see that photo that thing

34:49.800 --> 34:56.120
you're driving what we are saying is what we have done here is early treatment has really shown the

34:56.120 --> 35:05.400
world the importance of using off-label repurpose cheaper effective existing antivirals for respiratory

35:05.400 --> 35:11.720
type illnesses etc and has shown us that we have to move faster away from reliance on farmer

35:11.720 --> 35:17.800
so this is not a matter of right or wrong this is a matter of how we could make this early treatment

35:17.800 --> 35:24.280
the most optimal modality and how we could from the work that you are doing too from what we are

35:24.280 --> 35:31.720
discussing now make sure that it is used the best way it can so can you yes and so I think that

35:31.720 --> 35:36.600
that's a great segue the way that I would describe it best and you might have inspired this in me

35:37.240 --> 35:43.160
is that all of the doctors who have had a cognitive model of what has happened during the pandemic

35:43.160 --> 35:49.800
have had some form of model in their head about a spreading pathogen and how the presence of the

35:49.800 --> 35:56.760
pathogen can be or the the pathology caused by the pathogen can be mitigated with hydroxychloroquine

35:56.760 --> 36:04.120
or ivermectin etc yes what we need to do is now if we if we all agree that maybe we need a new model

36:05.000 --> 36:11.400
yes what happened we do then what we also need to do is step back and think okay so what did we

36:11.400 --> 36:20.440
really change in 2020 was it really only that some people were put on ventilators and had remdesivir

36:20.440 --> 36:26.840
and other people had hydroxychloroquine or was it some people were put on ventilators

36:27.560 --> 36:33.640
were given remdesivir were prevented from having antibiotics and prevented from having steroids

36:33.640 --> 36:39.960
while the people that were being treated by people like heroes like Dr. Peter McCullough were given

36:39.960 --> 36:46.280
hydroxychloroquine azithromycin and I can't say all of what they were given because it's a long list

36:46.280 --> 36:51.560
but we shouldn't discount the fact that we don't know for sure which of those lists

36:51.560 --> 37:00.120
was working for what reason because the source of this danger evolved yes it wasn't one constant

37:00.120 --> 37:06.040
novel pathogen but it evolved because the biology was different than what we were told on television

37:06.040 --> 37:13.000
so we all need to recalculate a little bit and yes and and I think early treatment is one of those

37:13.000 --> 37:18.760
things that worked but maybe not for the mechanistic reasons that we have in our head

37:18.760 --> 37:23.880
that's and I think yes beautiful and I think that's why in our discussion yesterday talks we've

37:23.880 --> 37:29.880
been having is that we want now people like the McCulloughs and the rich and these types to now

37:29.880 --> 37:35.720
because there are these gurus and leaders that transcend now elevate even further and let's help

37:35.720 --> 37:41.240
us and practice properly because we know good was done here where you mentioned two things ventilators

37:42.200 --> 37:47.480
let me make sure i'm on record those two things kill people you know that right yes absolutely

37:47.480 --> 37:53.800
there's still being used i mean remdesivir is still being used to push people to make them

37:53.800 --> 37:58.920
sicker and can often lead to them being at a ventilator because it decreases kidney function

37:58.920 --> 38:05.240
which increases the amount of liquid in the lungs yes yes boy j you should have been with us on

38:05.240 --> 38:10.680
stage on those talks with me and McCullough and rich and all of us you should have been there listen

38:10.680 --> 38:16.280
shortest diagram you have um i just wanted to point out that um if i can switch to this one

38:16.920 --> 38:21.720
and that i'm going to switch to this one now you should be able to see it um it's important to

38:21.720 --> 38:27.480
remember that when the clone was released it had the only unique thing about it was the spike

38:27.480 --> 38:33.560
protein so there's two possibilities the first one is of course that it could be a clone and the

38:33.560 --> 38:37.800
concentration of the clone itself is what matters most and that's what i've been trying to sell to

38:37.960 --> 38:42.120
you in the background that it can take any virus and make it pure enough people would get sick

38:42.680 --> 38:48.600
but there is the added possibility because berry and all the coronavirus people have told us that

38:48.600 --> 38:55.400
if you have a co-infection with two different coronaviruses they can exchange genes so if the

38:55.400 --> 39:03.480
spike protein is a source of pathology by itself and they released a clone it would be expected

39:03.560 --> 39:08.760
that anybody that had other coronaviruses in their system could have a reassortment where

39:08.760 --> 39:17.080
this toxic spike protein could be floating around in the genome of other coronaviruses that got it

39:17.080 --> 39:22.280
taken into their genome during recombination events of the clone and it's important to note

39:23.000 --> 39:32.040
that the clone itself if i put this back up and then turn you on if the clone itself was released

39:32.040 --> 39:37.880
in sufficient quantities it would be expected to recombine with the with the coronaviruses in

39:37.880 --> 39:45.720
the background so that means that it's possible that the way that the clone sort of died away

39:46.600 --> 39:53.720
has a component of it which is the spike protein gene sort of filtering out into the background

39:53.720 --> 39:59.960
so that you would see not only an initial wave of extremely nasty high virus load

40:00.920 --> 40:06.200
high molecular signal wherever you released it but then going away from there there really

40:06.200 --> 40:12.840
would be a signal where people were kind of getting sick and it seemed to be contagious

40:12.840 --> 40:20.920
and it seemed to have some extra qualities that either produced like an allergic reaction in

40:20.920 --> 40:27.480
people and this kind of thing that again it made doctors were not seeing ghosts they were

40:27.480 --> 40:33.880
seeing something but we need to understand why it wasn't a uniform set of symptoms correlating

40:33.880 --> 40:41.160
with a uniform positivity it never had that aspect of a normal what someone would expect

40:41.160 --> 40:46.200
a cartoon pathogen and this i think is the best explanation for it but i just wanted to throw

40:46.200 --> 40:51.080
that extra variable in there because that's also part of the virology we shouldn't ignore

40:52.040 --> 40:57.160
so in simple terms from your schematic we're looking at what the purity or concentration

40:57.160 --> 41:03.880
then yeah that's the key it always is and just a question of then how do we model the decay away

41:03.880 --> 41:09.880
but the decay away will also always be a real exponential because again you're starting from

41:09.880 --> 41:16.120
purity that can't be sustained so so i i think the unique message out of this is that um

41:16.760 --> 41:22.520
what we need is we not again if you go to the early treatment papers i am a senior or a total

41:22.520 --> 41:29.560
second or two behind my collar zalenko is a senior scientist so i have been involved so i am standing

41:29.560 --> 41:34.680
by the early treatment the point though is you are saying that um we need to figure out what

41:35.560 --> 41:42.360
how did this really work which is a patient set that is really work on etc and which components

41:42.360 --> 41:48.680
because antibiotics as an example and i mean you and me discuss this pneumonias are serious

41:48.680 --> 41:55.320
complication especially for severely uh covid patients antibiotics may have played because

41:55.320 --> 42:01.240
remember j we spoke about this yesterday i was talking to you about the antiviral properties

42:01.320 --> 42:06.600
and you reminded me about the anti-inflammatory properties of antibiotics so it didn't just

42:06.600 --> 42:15.640
function as an antibacterial antimicrobial it is both anti-inflammatory and etc so antiviral i mean

42:15.640 --> 42:22.520
antibiotics like doxycycline as a term icing etc so we we need to have an honest discussion and everybody

42:23.400 --> 42:32.200
what dang it this free zoom meeting has ended you shite head why did he use a free zoom meeting

42:32.200 --> 42:38.920
so i want to i want to um i want to i'm gonna i'm gonna why is this not signed in

42:42.440 --> 42:48.360
i'm just he can just use my meeting

42:52.680 --> 43:01.880
i'm gonna do a new meeting and just see if uh see if he shows up

43:04.680 --> 43:11.000
oh he's calling in let's just call in um i'm gonna close zoom come on come on come on

43:15.560 --> 43:21.960
hello sir jim jesica saw because it was supposed to be for 15 minutes but listen

43:21.960 --> 43:26.440
i have to go to another meeting now i'm going to interview karen she's going to interview me

43:26.440 --> 43:33.400
karen king son i want to get you to talk with her but another day bugger son this interview the way

43:33.400 --> 43:41.640
i set it up i wanted to bring you slap dab into the middle of early treatment now the way i asked

43:41.640 --> 43:47.160
you those questions and you responded you are now going to be a central player how we gonna talk

43:48.120 --> 43:51.640
and that was the purpose of this

43:51.640 --> 43:56.280
i'm very i'm very excited so let me just say that we have to talk about long covid and we have to

43:56.280 --> 44:03.240
talk about people who know about extended hospital stays or extended ventilation stays

44:03.240 --> 44:09.480
that have led to chronic fatigue syndrome before the pandemic so that we can really talk about

44:10.200 --> 44:15.080
what to what extent long covid has to do with the virus versus hospitalization and other things

44:15.880 --> 44:21.800
absolutely so everything you want to talk about going for but this interview actually is going

44:21.800 --> 44:27.400
to now set the stage and i love it so we got cut off but i made sure you said what you needed to

44:27.400 --> 44:33.800
say and i knew what i needed you to say because i want to table you and get you palatable to all

44:33.800 --> 44:38.200
the early treatment and you said you write rules about my car on these people they're not going

44:38.200 --> 44:44.680
to be a person and and and we had praise beautiful so i'm gonna talk to you later because i'm going

44:44.680 --> 44:50.760
to not integrate i'm gonna send you i'm gonna send you my uh my zoom link to rumble and whatever

44:50.760 --> 44:55.560
and you put this out massively very good see you soon take what because

44:58.200 --> 45:03.080
we're not messing around ladies and gentlemen nay we ain't playing anymore we ain't playing

45:03.160 --> 45:08.440
anymore fools that's for sure thank you very much for joining me i'm gonna take um

45:09.400 --> 45:13.080
i'm gonna take a break here uh figure out what i'm gonna do with my afternoon

45:13.720 --> 45:19.560
i might take um the afternoon off i was gonna do a throwback thursday so maybe we'll watch the

45:19.560 --> 45:24.840
second half of that i don't know but i gotta i gotta read a line it looks like mosquito says i

45:24.840 --> 45:29.560
gotta read a lot more about hydroxychloroquine that's fine i'm totally done with the fact that

45:29.640 --> 45:34.440
hydroxychloroquine could be useful i just want to make sure that we evaluate everything

45:34.440 --> 45:39.480
with eyes wide open um and give everybody an opportunity to be a part of this so

45:40.360 --> 45:46.440
um just keep sharing it man i i can't tell you how excited i am so thank you very much

45:59.560 --> 46:11.800
i'm gonna use twitter for star trek star trek is coming i swear i'm gonna do it in like no time

46:11.800 --> 46:15.960
um i'm just super nervous now that it's finally gonna happen star trek is ready

46:16.600 --> 46:22.680
this was ready this is what we needed um it's definitely happening garden variety human it's

46:22.680 --> 46:27.640
definitely it's definitely happening i know i'm back on twitter i just haven't tweeted yet

46:27.640 --> 46:43.560
thanks a lot for being here guys

46:57.640 --> 47:00.520
you
