WEBVTT

00:23.704 --> 00:24.204
Actually, J.J.

00:24.224 --> 00:30.846
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

00:40.538 --> 00:43.220
These people are absolutely out there.

00:43.400 --> 00:54.549
And anybody that's in our space, you kind of have to assume that you are interacting with them at one point or another, usually surreptitiously.

00:54.609 --> 01:01.294
So these are the chaos agents, and they're the ones that they so, so want to work with you.

01:02.054 --> 01:03.435
and collaborate with you.

01:03.636 --> 01:06.198
And you know, you're like how brilliant you are.

01:06.238 --> 01:06.979
Precisely.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.320
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09.141 --> 01:14.465
You know, it's not just the honey trap with the short skirt.

01:15.406 --> 01:19.510
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

01:27.145 --> 01:45.694
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.096
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

01:50.926 --> 01:56.890
panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

01:57.150 --> 02:03.273
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

02:03.313 --> 02:08.896
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

02:09.577 --> 02:17.861
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

02:19.402 --> 02:32.237
particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

02:33.590 --> 02:52.921
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

02:59.144 --> 03:03.185
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody, and flattery is one of them.

03:04.586 --> 03:08.687
There's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody, and flattery is one of them.

03:08.707 --> 03:12.649
I think that you can tell if someone's lying.

03:13.309 --> 03:15.070
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:16.870 --> 03:17.591
And I have lied.

03:17.811 --> 03:18.651
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:18.671 --> 03:20.351
I don't want to lie, you know?

03:20.612 --> 03:21.432
I don't think I'm a liar.

03:21.532 --> 03:22.572
I try not to be a liar.

03:22.592 --> 03:23.453
I don't want to be a liar.

03:24.013 --> 03:26.734
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.634
I think truth is good for kids.

03:39.055 --> 03:42.922
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

03:43.363 --> 03:45.006
We want everybody to feel good.

03:45.126 --> 03:47.090
That's not the way life is.

04:00.427 --> 04:02.429
Okay, so this is kind of a young guy.

04:02.489 --> 04:06.112
He only started jumping a couple years ago.

04:32.478 --> 04:53.175
these guys um the other guy broke the world record uh in 2023 or at least recorded a 50 inch vertical um the world record would be above 50 inches and so they have this they have this pole and it's you know 50 inches above their reach and so they give you the the sort of

04:54.324 --> 05:16.399
the the numbers all the time one guy is slightly higher than the other guy in terms of reach and so the the amount they jump is different but this this dude is crazy look at this now i would already love to have a 35 inch vertical jump like i probably hurt myself but i would kill actually to have a 35 inch vertical jump um

05:17.501 --> 05:25.229
Depending on who that was I would have very very little qualms, but of course I'm joking so look how easy it is

05:26.980 --> 05:28.821
He's like just, ding.

05:29.301 --> 05:34.243
So this is really, I think, just amazing how far athleticism has progressed.

05:35.564 --> 05:37.545
And I think a lot of this has to do with the internet.

05:37.585 --> 05:42.707
It has to do with the collective belief that these records exist and can be broken.

05:43.228 --> 05:51.872
And if you can see it and see it over and over and over again, then the understanding of what's possible is just different.

05:52.552 --> 05:57.956
than if you don't have this access to this, like our parents didn't, and like lots of us didn't.

05:58.536 --> 06:04.540
The only time you could see NBA basketball was to watch it, you know, on television.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.583
And maybe if you recorded it, oh my gosh, 40 inches.

06:08.663 --> 06:13.787
I mean, that's Kobe Bryant had a average 40 inch vertical jump.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.069
We're talking about serious hops, like serious hops.

06:19.386 --> 06:21.107
The spring, it doesn't even really look real.

06:21.167 --> 06:26.448
I used to hear stuff in college about people that could take

06:37.768 --> 06:42.870
and put quarters, like leave quarters on the top of the backboard, and it never made sense to me.

06:42.890 --> 06:56.097
It never made sense to me, but they used to talk about the UNLV players being able to put quarters on the top of the backboard, and that seems like incredible, but not if you see these dudes.

06:59.659 --> 07:04.364
Because remember those guys, those guys could have a 40 inch vertical and be 6'10".

07:04.404 --> 07:05.845
These guys are not 6'10".

07:06.265 --> 07:07.587
So what can a 6'10 do?

07:07.607 --> 07:10.009
If I could touch 12 feet.

07:10.329 --> 07:15.054
I would go home in an ambulance if I could touch 12 feet.

07:21.277 --> 07:29.560
You can't play basketball around normal people because when you jump like that, you'll inevitably get, you'll get the legs taken out from under you.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.860
Look at how high he goes.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.181
No problem with that.

07:35.282 --> 07:37.162
Okay, 47 inches for the other boy.

07:38.262 --> 07:40.163
He's also very, very impressive.

07:42.944 --> 07:44.805
And he doesn't really have any calves.

07:45.085 --> 07:48.546
Like, he looks like a guy who could train a lot.

07:49.810 --> 07:56.232
I mean, imagine if that guy doesn't really jump rope you.

07:57.612 --> 07:58.413
12 foot 2.

07:58.593 --> 07:59.713
You see, that's crazy.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.074
You gotta watch out for your face on the rim then.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.414
You might catch your, break your teeth.

08:17.859 --> 08:18.519
Oh, he missed it.

08:23.222 --> 08:26.263
He's gonna take another step now, a little more energy.

08:27.064 --> 08:28.064
He's been conserving.

08:28.084 --> 08:32.587
Ding!

08:32.607 --> 08:32.587
49.

08:32.627 --> 08:38.009
I mean, that is just incredible.

08:38.630 --> 08:41.511
How do you rebound against a person who can jump 49 inches high?

08:44.158 --> 08:47.459
This is kind of like Derrick Rose kind of springing.

08:51.141 --> 08:51.981
Ooh, he missed too.

08:52.561 --> 08:57.203
Now that guy starts to try at the end indeed, but he's got a lot of growing to do yet.

08:57.283 --> 09:00.485
I think that's like a kid compared to the other dude.

09:00.505 --> 09:04.626
I think the other dude is a little more of a professional and he's been at it for a few more years.

09:04.686 --> 09:10.069
This dude, I think he's got a couple more years of training where he's still only going to get stronger.

09:11.294 --> 09:27.998
unless he becomes a fat ass this dude's this is flying he'll be doing 52 next year cuz see that he got hard he got a lot of that belt that was 50 inches right there like that's easy damn 50 inches like

09:32.881 --> 09:34.822
Come on, this is absurd.

09:38.044 --> 09:41.166
They have to have like a special stick for this because that's crazy.

09:44.508 --> 09:47.650
And he's very nice, he cheers for the other dude, it's really cool.

09:51.593 --> 09:57.617
I keep trying to tell my gym we need something like this in the gym so people can test what they can touch.

09:59.699 --> 10:03.862
I know we have the backboard, but it's kind of nice to have something that you can swing at.

10:04.843 --> 10:12.689
The backboard, you know, you can hurt yourself if you had to really learn to jump straight up, which is also good for basketball, but I'm still just saying this is fun.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.411
This kind of stuff is fun.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.454
They should do this for Olympics, really.

10:18.474 --> 10:19.395
This is kind of cool.

10:24.136 --> 10:24.816
See, that's like 51.

10:24.997 --> 10:28.599
If he got that hard, that's like 51.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.100
That's really a lot of bell.

10:31.861 --> 10:34.062
That wasn't a little bit of bell, that was a lot of bell.

10:34.262 --> 10:35.303
That was impressive.

10:36.044 --> 10:37.104
Holy balls.

10:41.887 --> 10:43.468
See, because he barely got it.

10:44.289 --> 10:45.510
He barely got the bell.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.031
The other dude pounded on that bell.

10:50.152 --> 10:51.994
Now the other dude pounded on that bell.

10:54.808 --> 10:55.068
51 now.

10:55.108 --> 10:55.608
Here we go.

10:55.628 --> 10:55.608
51.

10:57.350 --> 10:57.790
Here we go.

10:57.830 --> 11:05.037
This dude... I think he got 51 on the last jump.

11:05.697 --> 11:05.837
See?

11:05.857 --> 11:06.758
Because he missed now.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.019
That sucks.

11:08.219 --> 11:10.261
Because I think he got 51 on the last one.

11:10.882 --> 11:15.566
It's like... They should have different frequency, pal.

11:16.006 --> 11:17.628
So you can see how high he's going.

11:17.688 --> 11:18.769
Okay, he's gonna take one.

11:19.749 --> 11:20.010
Nice.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.681
Now he's not going to try again.

11:31.701 --> 11:31.681
51.

11:37.582 --> 11:38.342
New world record.

11:38.962 --> 11:39.703
That's pretty dope.

11:42.203 --> 11:44.084
I still think the other guy could probably do it.

11:44.784 --> 11:46.644
Look how high he jumps when he bounces.

11:46.724 --> 11:47.604
It's crazy.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.745
It's like he's got something under him, but he doesn't.

11:56.207 --> 11:57.467
That doesn't even make sense.

12:05.919 --> 12:09.021
He's gonna try one more time, but he doesn't hit it, unfortunately.

12:09.382 --> 12:10.302
I'll spoil it for you.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.245
But I'm sure that he did on the first jump.

12:14.706 --> 12:17.148
See, I'm sure that he did on the first jump.

12:17.628 --> 12:19.650
He could even go back and see it, but we won't.

12:20.951 --> 12:21.671
Thanks for being here.

12:21.711 --> 12:22.292
I'll see you in a minute.

12:26.406 --> 12:45.737
I don't care how you get there.

12:45.757 --> 12:48.458
I don't care what you do to get there.

12:48.478 --> 12:51.040
The goal is to win.

12:55.836 --> 12:56.740
What time is it?

12:56.820 --> 12:57.543
Game time!

13:03.317 --> 13:05.059
Alright, let's get down to work here.

13:05.139 --> 13:06.821
I wanted to start out with something fun.

13:06.881 --> 13:08.702
I could not believe that video.

13:08.763 --> 13:13.207
Like, those dudes... Those dudes are like some kind of bionics or something.

13:13.267 --> 13:17.251
Like, that's old school crazy right there.

13:17.311 --> 13:18.052
Those are freaks.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.553
Jumping jacks, indeed.

13:20.074 --> 13:20.915
It is Monday.

13:21.455 --> 13:26.140
Sorry if you are starting your week, but look forward to the fact that you are starting your week.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.101
That you have a job.

13:27.661 --> 13:31.064
that you have a way of providing for your family.

13:31.124 --> 13:33.346
I don't know how to think positively about it.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.989
I don't know how to think positively about my own existence.

13:37.029 --> 13:46.437
I just try every day to get up in the morning and count the things that I'm very thankful for, all the blessings that I have in my life.

13:46.637 --> 13:50.681
And I hope that you are able to find a way to do that every morning as well.

13:50.781 --> 13:54.203
One of the best ways to attempt to do that is to stay off of social media.

13:54.924 --> 14:09.027
One of the best ways to ponder what you have in life and how to maximize your contributions to the next generation by planting the trees under whose shade you will not shelter is to get off social media.

14:09.607 --> 14:13.768
This is the only non-compliance that really matters, especially with respect to our children.

14:14.908 --> 14:18.449
I can say without a doubt that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

14:19.049 --> 14:29.537
It's used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

14:30.077 --> 14:39.484
And they have accomplished the same thing with regard to these myths of pandemics and of gain of function.

14:39.924 --> 14:42.426
The same goals have been accomplished.

14:42.646 --> 14:44.648
It is a bamboozlement.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.629
It is an enchantment.

14:46.249 --> 14:52.534
And if you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, you will not be able to pull your kids out.

14:53.054 --> 15:05.424
You will not be able to see why this illusion about all the biological problems in the world already being answered, why this needs to be broken, why we need to teach our kids a different biology.

15:05.784 --> 15:07.065
Hey, there's a the the again.

15:07.505 --> 15:08.006
That's funny.

15:08.446 --> 15:09.407
I thought I got all those.

15:12.559 --> 15:21.505
And yeah, so anyway, I'm trying to spread the word that there are other people on the internet that are working in earnest to try and get to the end zone here.

15:21.525 --> 15:34.553
I think, if anything, the recent work of Mark Kulak at HousatonicITS.com has really shown that an independent group of journalists

15:35.313 --> 15:51.176
whatever analysts, whatever you want to call us, is capable of pushing one another in directions and influencing one another's thinking in a way that benefits both and prevents errors from being made on both sides.

15:51.256 --> 15:53.577
But it really depends on the independence of it.

15:54.637 --> 15:59.338
Shout out to that Substack in Scotland.

15:59.378 --> 15:59.938
Sorry about that.

15:59.978 --> 16:00.878
I missed that slide.

16:02.196 --> 16:03.857
going a little fast for myself here.

16:04.978 --> 16:08.439
That is biological, biology phenom?

16:08.660 --> 16:11.941
Yeah, biology phenom, bio phenom, Substack.

16:12.041 --> 16:15.143
It is biology phenom, yes.substack.com.

16:15.903 --> 16:18.125
And we are gigaohmbiological.com.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.166
We're Gigaohm Biological on Substack.

16:20.766 --> 16:25.509
We are stream.gigaohm.bio on our own PeerTube platform.

16:26.369 --> 16:37.215
and we are gigaohm.bio on our own uh soapbox platform and sometimes I think sometimes I wake up in the morning and I'm so pessimistic I think you know what I ought to do?

16:37.916 --> 16:50.123
I ought to just stop streaming on all these other platforms and just only stream to my own peertube and only post my videos you know on my own channels with my own links

16:51.263 --> 16:54.386
And somehow I have the feeling that that would keep me more focused.

16:55.086 --> 16:58.688
Like this eagle is very focused.

16:58.729 --> 17:02.351
You can notice that his eyes are very focused on the biology.

17:02.371 --> 17:09.776
And I think America and American citizens need to focus, very much focus.

17:10.537 --> 17:12.778
And that means getting off of social media.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.280
It means not taking the bait on social media.

17:17.307 --> 17:18.628
That is focus.

17:18.948 --> 17:19.609
See the focus?

17:21.230 --> 17:22.932
And it means loving your neighbor.

17:23.272 --> 17:24.433
You gotta focus on that.

17:24.453 --> 17:25.114
See the focus?

17:26.415 --> 17:29.077
If you don't, you can be distracted.

17:29.137 --> 17:36.203
This wave of mythology surrounding coronavirus is something we've been surfing for a few years now.

17:36.943 --> 17:43.149
And if you're a skilled TV watcher, a skilled social media user, you may indeed have already been overwhelmed by that wave.

17:43.989 --> 17:59.302
Overwhelmed by the Ukrainian wave, and that Gaza-Israel wave, and the Iran nuclear wave, and the China-Taiwan wave, and the Philippines and Chinese island wave, and the... Wow, there's a lot of waves.

17:59.802 --> 18:00.703
Gotta stay focused.

18:01.524 --> 18:04.626
Can't take their bait on social media, and you gotta love your neighbor, your real neighbors.

18:05.785 --> 18:11.771
Even the ones that are a little goofy because they are the skilled TV watchers, the skilled social media users.

18:11.811 --> 18:24.643
You got to stay focused because if you don't stay focused, you'll be reading a bunch of, you know, anonymous substacks and the seemingly endless conversations that occur in their comment sections.

18:24.763 --> 18:25.564
My goodness.

18:26.556 --> 18:32.322
All these people are working very hard to make these social media platforms relevant around the world.

18:32.382 --> 18:36.085
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooley.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.007
I'm chief biologist at Gigoloan Biological.

18:38.027 --> 18:40.990
We're coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

18:41.471 --> 18:44.574
I used to be a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

18:44.614 --> 18:48.557
You can find the stain of that academic work on the National Library of Medicine Pub Lab website.

18:49.258 --> 18:53.781
Under my last name, Kouey, C-O-U-E-Y, with my first initials, J-J.

18:53.861 --> 19:04.207
Also my, you know, nickname from a lot of these people, including those people in Panda that made me, asked me to present three times, recorded it, and then didn't put it anywhere.

19:05.127 --> 19:14.075
Also, some panda members are responsible for the use of my ideas, the shitty use of my ideas, on a substack called Woodhouse 76.

19:14.856 --> 19:28.367
You can also find a lot of my work and quotes and stuff in the Wuhan cover of a book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published by Children's Health Defense, for whom I've also served as a staff scientist

19:29.969 --> 19:32.530
under Brian Hooker and the trader Mary Holland.

19:33.251 --> 19:38.515
And I'm also good friends, barbecue buddies, with Jay Bhattacharya, now head of NIH.

19:39.775 --> 19:41.997
I think these people are all scripted traders.

19:42.317 --> 19:43.878
And that's a pretty bold statement to make.

19:44.439 --> 19:45.599
And I'm very happy to make it.

19:45.820 --> 19:49.362
My wife, my family, our whole life is on the line here.

19:49.382 --> 19:53.425
And gigahomebiological.com is kind of our headquarters.

19:53.945 --> 19:55.947
If you go there, you can find the Scooby link.

19:56.667 --> 20:01.641
which will, you know, show you what I was up to in 2021, how fooled I was.

20:02.123 --> 20:03.507
You can find the stuff link

20:04.682 --> 20:08.463
And then you can also find a bunch of links to where I am still posting my live shows.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.383
But I don't know, maybe I'm not going to do that very much longer.

20:11.403 --> 20:16.325
And then you can find a bunch of links on how to get in contact, how to support the stream.

20:16.345 --> 20:20.785
And I gotta tell you, we need your support and we need you to share the stream.

20:21.866 --> 20:23.846
Because sharing the stream is how we win.

20:24.746 --> 20:27.167
And that might mean that you need to download the stream.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.929
And then, you know, extract the audio file.

20:31.809 --> 20:34.150
Then send that audio file to your friends.

20:34.771 --> 20:40.054
I'm going to start extracting the audio file, because the audio file that I get to download from Peertube is crap.

20:40.914 --> 20:42.615
And I don't really know how to fix it.

20:42.635 --> 20:44.136
I've been trying to troubleshoot it.

20:44.236 --> 20:50.099
I've been trying to get some help troubleshooting it, but that has so far failed, which is another story.

20:51.972 --> 21:00.498
And so I have found a strategy with which I can fix this problem, alleviate the problem, and then I can start producing audio only.

21:00.518 --> 21:04.301
Them waves can make you slaves, they can.

21:04.381 --> 21:08.984
I mean, just ask Jessica Rose, she's a slave to the waves.

21:09.144 --> 21:09.544
Anyway...

21:10.665 --> 21:16.531
I'm gonna start producing an audio file which I can upload as a podcast on Spotify.

21:16.652 --> 21:24.800
I don't know how many people will think that's a great idea, but I'm gonna try that for a little while and see what occurs.

21:26.522 --> 21:28.704
Welcome to the bridge, ladies and gentlemen.

21:28.824 --> 21:30.726
This is Gigaohm Biological.

21:31.707 --> 21:52.833
We are in some kind of weird, weird place where most of reality is distorted by social media and in fact the coordinated effort of liars on social media, scripted liars, has allowed humanity in general, governments and organizations to be bamboozled in many different ways.

21:53.815 --> 22:16.708
And so although I got here basically by trying to be a biologist with integrity, I'm now more just kind of an American who's desperate to get his fellow Americans off of social media and to start to establish a worldwide trend where people leave social media and start to establish a spontaneous network, a federated

22:17.268 --> 22:31.115
you know, open source, GitHub-sourced social media clone equivalents, you know, like Soapbox, like PeerTube, so that spontaneous networks of patriots and freedom fighters can form.

22:31.989 --> 22:39.955
If Mark Kulak had a PeerTube, I would link my PeerTube to it and it would appear as though there was just another channel.

22:40.956 --> 22:50.744
And then, you know, we could mirror each other's videos, for example, so that even some of my videos would be mirrored on his servers and on his websites.

22:51.544 --> 23:00.972
There's lots of things that can happen if we start to make redundancies and you start to realize that, you know, that investment isn't very high, especially if you're already invested.

23:01.887 --> 23:03.368
in a podcast or something like that.

23:03.468 --> 23:05.288
And Apple podcast says Reginald.

23:05.408 --> 23:05.688
Okay.

23:06.168 --> 23:11.330
Well, you know, because you said it in the chat, I'm going to write it down and I'm going to find out how hard that is.

23:11.370 --> 23:17.752
And I bet it's not very hard once I have the MP3 and I'm going to do that for you alone.

23:18.112 --> 23:19.273
And that's already enough for me.

23:20.363 --> 23:20.863
How's that?

23:21.564 --> 23:22.304
Welcome to the show.

23:22.324 --> 23:23.945
My name is Jonathan Couey.

23:23.985 --> 23:24.585
Good to see you.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.006
Welcome, welcome.

23:26.967 --> 23:31.289
We are still under the same... There's a little dinging going on here.

23:31.309 --> 23:35.211
I'm just going to check and make sure it's no immediate problem dingings here.

23:35.231 --> 23:36.752
Ding dong dingers.

23:39.054 --> 23:40.375
My package was delivered.

23:40.415 --> 23:41.495
I wonder which one that is.

23:41.675 --> 23:44.856
Anyway, I bet you Mikey was mad about that.

23:45.856 --> 24:04.522
We are in a crucial state in America and I can't stress enough how possible it is that America could snap out of this and in a way that would allow a sort of mass forgiveness in the sense of

24:05.538 --> 24:11.040
If we could look at our family and friends and say, hey, we were kind of fooled by this pseudo-conservative movement.

24:11.620 --> 24:12.760
We were kind of fooled.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.022
We didn't really think that Donald Trump was a hero, but we kind of thought Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:17.062 --> 24:17.262
was.

24:17.302 --> 24:23.804
We kind of thought that Brian Hooker was a good guy, that Mary Holland was a good guy, that Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield.

24:23.844 --> 24:26.085
These people all kind of fooled us together.

24:26.905 --> 24:30.426
And I know it's dumb, but that's what happened.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.167
And now we see it.

24:33.388 --> 24:40.814
And we are aware now that we're all vulnerable to this governance by social media.

24:40.854 --> 24:46.339
And you have to see it too, that actually, although you might not think it's happening on your side, it is.

24:48.200 --> 24:55.467
The only question becomes, is your side trying to sustain narratives which are more difficult to sustain?

24:56.300 --> 25:09.631
And I think, for example, the narrative of is this a lab leak or is this a natural virus took a lot more technical scripting and a lot more coordinated lying over the last five years.

25:09.671 --> 25:13.955
It was a very carefully orchestrated running of a clock.

25:15.390 --> 25:21.036
and a titrating of a mythology that brought everybody to the same place, even though they came there by different routes.

25:21.776 --> 25:39.774
And that cannot be underestimated as a militarily coordinated exercise, even if it was done by primarily private operators, funded by private, untraceable funding, you know, like fake Substack subscriptions or fake book sales.

25:41.969 --> 25:45.851
even money laundering through casinos for all I know.

25:48.233 --> 26:03.361
And because this is for the grandchildren of Earth, because they want to invert the sovereignty of our grandchildren, what they need us to do is teach our kids the wrong biology so that our grandchildren are

26:04.477 --> 26:21.531
inheriting this very, very fine-tuned and awful set of myths that includes public health, includes intramuscular injection, includes virology, includes maybe a gender spectrum, or at least the malleability of it.

26:22.953 --> 26:27.817
And all of these things are being slowly, coercively,

26:28.914 --> 26:30.355
imposed on our children.

26:30.395 --> 26:41.983
And if we're not there as their parents and their elders to protect them, then this coercion will be complete using social media in a way that you cannot underestimate the danger of.

26:43.805 --> 26:50.910
And so in terms of breaking free, I really do think that one of the ways to break free is to try and see the truth

26:51.721 --> 27:08.706
to seek the truth together about this mythology of a lab-leak virus that has gone endemic, because endemicity is the myth, and... In addition, we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

27:09.226 --> 27:12.927
But there are central myths that are easier to attack.

27:13.627 --> 27:18.709
And I think, for example, the idea that all of these no-virus people, like,

27:21.115 --> 27:23.797
Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.300
I should have probably paused that.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.784
And Christine Massey.

27:32.844 --> 27:37.507
You see, the problem with their position is that they haven't gotten here.

27:38.268 --> 27:47.875
And anybody that has been doing this for 10 or 15 or even longer has no excuse for not getting here.

27:49.383 --> 28:14.681
because the only reason, the only possible explanation for both Paul Offit and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both Peter Hotez and Mary Holland having arrived at the same place where autism spectrum disorder is a thing, and at least some of it is described, or sorry, caused by some component of vaccines, which can be injurious.

28:17.042 --> 28:17.943
It's impossible.

28:20.009 --> 28:21.650
But essentially, that's where we are.

28:21.670 --> 28:23.171
That is a mythology.

28:24.512 --> 28:32.497
And that is the reason why this recording of Brian Hooker exists, where at some point in 2013, he did not use the word autism.

28:32.537 --> 28:33.898
It didn't make any sense to him.

28:34.499 --> 28:45.025
If there are, there is such a thing as what this book describes as infantile autism from the proceedings of Indiana University in 1971.

28:50.299 --> 28:53.100
Edited by Churchill, Apern, and DeMere.

28:53.601 --> 28:58.103
If these kids exist, these kids are not the same kids.

28:59.603 --> 29:10.549
Just like the movie Rain Man is not about a kid that was injured by a vaccine and put in a home and then later taken out of the home to count cards in Vegas.

29:10.589 --> 29:15.331
That's not what, that's not the kid that Brian Hooker has.

29:18.342 --> 29:26.549
That's not what happened to that black lady and vaxxed who had fraternal twins and gave the shots to one baby and not the other baby.

29:27.109 --> 29:29.031
And now the boy is just wrecked.

29:29.371 --> 29:31.773
That's not, that's not what we're talking about here.

29:32.234 --> 29:45.545
And autism spectrum disorder has allowed both the anti-vax movement and the people like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez to run this clock for years, calling each other grifters.

29:48.598 --> 29:49.859
This is how we are governed.

29:50.460 --> 30:01.789
And once we see and can clearly teach our children how this is done, then social media will be useless to them and unattractive to them, almost repellent.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.633
And so not only is this true- He was vaccine damaged.

30:06.993 --> 30:11.877
He was neurologically damaged, in condition that we will not call autism.

30:12.017 --> 30:13.578
I don't like the word autism.

30:14.459 --> 30:15.360
He was vaccine damaged.

30:16.621 --> 30:21.306
And so pandemics and gain of function accomplish the same thing as I said earlier.

30:22.327 --> 30:24.109
And there might even be a better way to say it.

30:24.789 --> 30:28.994
I think, you know, I got to be really, I want to be brutal here.

30:29.154 --> 30:29.374
Okay.

30:29.414 --> 30:30.235
I want to be brutal.

30:31.076 --> 30:38.463
I have books over there on the shelf that if you take those books at face value, then you can confirm exactly what Mark

30:39.204 --> 30:51.853
has found, which is that, you know, intramuscular injection was not thought of as a great way to administer medicine until around the late 1800s.

30:52.033 --> 31:06.264
And then it was still kind of associated with morphine, kind of associated with wounds, you know, like if you want the pain relief of morphine to help somebody with a leg wound, you don't necessarily want to put it in a vein in the arm.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.105
Maybe it's better to shoot it in the muscle.

31:09.246 --> 31:11.748
That's how this essentially started.

31:12.529 --> 31:23.076
In no way, shape or form was this a methodology to apply medicine internally to a healthy human until around this time.

31:23.157 --> 31:25.418
And so it's a bad idea from the late 1800s.

31:27.469 --> 31:38.893
That's pretty much a home run right there that anybody on this bookshelf next to me with a book in the last 10 years could have probably gotten there with a reasonable amount of research.

31:38.973 --> 31:40.093
Mark took like a week.

31:42.474 --> 31:46.516
And I bet if you asked him, like, what did he spend all of his time on?

31:46.556 --> 31:51.397
He would probably tell you it was a ridiculous short amount of time because number one, he's skilled.

31:51.537 --> 31:54.278
Number two, we've been working for six years on this problem.

31:54.739 --> 31:55.479
And number three,

31:57.182 --> 31:58.963
He hasn't made any assumptions yet.

32:00.004 --> 32:05.086
He's still listening to me and still trying to understand intramuscular injection is dumb.

32:05.767 --> 32:06.327
What is that?

32:06.927 --> 32:08.028
What are the brass tabs?

32:08.048 --> 32:08.968
When did it start?

32:09.148 --> 32:15.912
Why is it that Mark Kulak is the first person to ask that in response to my work?

32:17.455 --> 32:35.297
Why in the hell is it Mark Kulak and not Robert F. Kennedy Jr., any employee of CHD, any person that I've ever been on their podcast and they've interviewed me, you know, like, I don't know, Sarah Westall or Kim Iverson or, you know, it's remarkable.

32:36.264 --> 32:41.145
No one, no one except for Mark Kulak was able to go in that direction.

32:41.165 --> 32:43.426
And that's why you can see that they're all scripted.

32:43.846 --> 32:45.226
They're all scripted frauds.

32:45.947 --> 32:49.788
Even the people fighting for profound autism.

32:49.808 --> 32:58.370
Do you see that profound autism and the statements that they made earlier this year about profound autism are actually an admission that I'm right here.

33:00.029 --> 33:13.961
They never used the words profound and autism together until 2025, when it finally became apparent that something was gonna go wrong here because autism spectrum disorder admittedly covers a lot of shit.

33:16.784 --> 33:22.469
And so they walked you right into that libertarian left hook, my ass.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.732
They walked us into on both sides.

33:27.318 --> 33:36.060
And the health freedom movement orchestrated by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and Steve Bannon and all the people behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:36.100 --> 33:41.861
is one of the nastiest tricks and long cons to ever have been played in recent human history.

33:42.341 --> 33:47.322
And the only way it was able to be played is because of our acquiescence to social media.

33:49.423 --> 33:54.484
And that's why, that's the answer to why would there be a fake health freedom movement in America?

33:54.524 --> 33:55.724
Because it's worth votes.

33:57.762 --> 33:59.503
because it can herd cats.

34:00.223 --> 34:04.925
The illusion, the promise can herd many cats.

34:07.707 --> 34:13.590
That's why we have a fake health freedom movement because intramuscular injection as medicine is a dumb idea from the 1800s.

34:13.690 --> 34:19.392
And they don't want our kids to know that because autism spectrum disorder is a mythology.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.813
They don't want our kids to know that.

34:22.932 --> 34:24.533
Hell, they don't want us to figure it out.

34:24.873 --> 34:37.782
They don't want us to figure out that pandemics and gain of function are just mythologies used to hide this other stuff, including the inversion of our grandkids sovereignty to experimental animal status.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.764
So you got to ask yourself how we got here.

34:41.804 --> 34:45.707
We got here because they were telling coordinated lies.

34:45.787 --> 34:46.427
Who's they?

34:46.507 --> 34:47.988
They are coordinated liars.

34:48.429 --> 34:50.610
And they all trust the script that they were given.

34:51.030 --> 34:51.871
They stick to it.

34:53.499 --> 34:56.101
and they've seen the results of sticking to the script.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.322
You cannot change their script.

34:58.442 --> 35:01.504
Interacting with them on social media is an illusion.

35:02.305 --> 35:09.309
Engaging with them and their, you know, bots are probably just a bunch of Indian people, not Chinese people, Indian people.

35:09.389 --> 35:10.930
These people employ Indians.

35:11.491 --> 35:13.532
The Chinese people probably have Chinese bots.

35:13.552 --> 35:15.013
There's probably Russian bots too.

35:15.774 --> 35:17.715
But these people are using Indian bots.

35:19.531 --> 35:21.571
There's no automatic bots.

35:21.671 --> 35:26.513
There are no chat bots that are posting in cooperation with Robert Malone.

35:26.533 --> 35:27.373
There are just people.

35:30.313 --> 35:32.394
And some of those people are these people.

35:33.034 --> 35:33.874
It's the way it works.

35:35.135 --> 35:37.675
And you don't even need to think that it's always them.

35:37.775 --> 35:41.676
It can just be somebody who's got the administrative rights to use their account.

35:42.356 --> 35:46.057
Do you really think that David Icke is always on X tweeting all this shit?

35:48.564 --> 36:00.670
Or do you think that David Icke has just, you know, been a part of this the whole time, like a little announcer, getting the idea out there into the heads of the people who need the idea and are looking for it.

36:06.193 --> 36:11.956
David Icke is a fraud, just like any of these other people are frauds, and they were put in place a long time ago,

36:13.578 --> 36:18.300
You know, the recordings that you're going to see of David Icke start around 2013, 2014, 2015.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.442
And all of these people were started to get seated in place.

36:22.462 --> 36:33.306
2011 is when that Australian guy with the black hats talking into the mic about how there's going to be a new disease and they're going to lock down the world for it.

36:33.846 --> 36:38.008
And then what happens in the next 10 years, they put people in place to be ready for this.

36:40.319 --> 36:42.620
They scripted a bunch of shit in Samoa.

36:42.661 --> 36:46.723
They wrote, they wrote Rolling Stone articles.

36:46.783 --> 36:51.666
They wrote Skyhorse books where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:51.726 --> 36:55.549
is an independent candidate who gets taken as a vice presidential candidate.

36:55.609 --> 36:59.191
That presidential candidate gets shot and he becomes president.

36:59.211 --> 37:00.792
These are not random things.

37:02.313 --> 37:09.658
These are all admissions that this is one malevolent script with somebody like Steve Bannon up there involved.

37:14.441 --> 37:18.364
but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

37:18.484 --> 37:22.727
And all of these organizations are not spontaneous grassroots organization.

37:22.747 --> 37:36.357
The Brownstone, World Health, World Council for Health, Heart, Panda, the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics and the Doctors for COVID Ethics.

37:36.397 --> 37:38.659
These are all fractions.

37:41.877 --> 37:56.382
where for the last five years, people have been claiming their intellectual property rights to different ideas about how to explain different things and about who came up with the batch idea first or the, or the, you know, the amyloids first, or it's all just gross.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.964
And we always got, we all get sucked into it.

38:00.064 --> 38:03.785
We all got sucked into it because there's nothing good.

38:06.095 --> 38:11.239
I've been trying to get a lawyer in Pennsylvania to help me start a nonprofit for the last six months.

38:11.300 --> 38:14.522
And every time I've contacted a lawyer, they've said yes.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.564
Then they never contact me again.

38:16.584 --> 38:18.926
I can't explain the pattern.

38:20.187 --> 38:21.688
I can only tell you what's happening.

38:23.510 --> 38:29.135
I have a very little, I don't know what to do.

38:30.287 --> 38:35.069
But I do know that we are making progress and I do know that we are wiping the floor with them.

38:35.109 --> 38:36.809
Otherwise, all these things wouldn't be happening.

38:36.829 --> 38:39.370
They wouldn't care if I was going to set up a nonprofit or not.

38:40.171 --> 38:42.392
But I think they know that a dam is about to break.

38:42.472 --> 38:47.493
And I think they know that myself and Mark are people that could break that dam.

38:50.355 --> 38:59.518
And so again, I just want to emphasize these people have maintained the illusion and they're still maintaining that illusion now by sticking to the script that they've been provided.

39:01.243 --> 39:11.331
I think it's very likely that Kevin McKernan, maybe Claire Craig, Robert Malone, these people are all involved in the writing of the script.

39:14.334 --> 39:16.696
But this illusion is what hides the murder.

39:18.477 --> 39:25.643
The ghost of health freedom that will never come to pass because this is really about inverting our sovereignty.

39:25.663 --> 39:30.127
This is about a global network

39:31.152 --> 39:34.073
where national governments don't really matter.

39:34.513 --> 40:00.139
If Twitter can cancel anybody around the world, if Facebook can cancel anybody around the world, if they can create political movements that don't exist spontaneously, which I'm sure that they can, then they just have to have a closed-door briefing with governments to say, hey, look, we're going to create an uprising throughout your whole country if you don't

40:00.851 --> 40:05.821
give in to our needs in terms of regulation or in terms of this or that or the other.

40:07.104 --> 40:08.867
And I don't think you can underestimate the

40:10.919 --> 40:33.720
potential there and the reason why these people are exclusively on X and exclusively on Substack, on this fake conservative movement side, because those are the social media platforms that these people have been conscripted in terms of, you know, to make them more relevant.

40:35.575 --> 40:42.396
The more relevant to German politics Substack authors are, the better for Substack.

40:42.856 --> 40:49.638
The more relevant to the media landscape of the UK politics scene that Substack is, the better for Substack.

40:50.218 --> 40:59.680
The more relevant Substack writers are to the conservative health freedom movement in America, the more that they can be said to define it.

41:00.811 --> 41:03.952
And the same can be said for X, for Telegram, for Signal.

41:04.532 --> 41:21.719
And so, to their shareholders, and more importantly, maybe, to the governments that pay them, use them, contract them, they have, over the last five years, demonstrated their ability to sway people into arguing about what they want them to argue about.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.721
To fight about the answers to particular questions.

41:26.872 --> 41:29.394
And that power has been sold to the highest bidder.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.135
I believe that 100%.

41:30.736 --> 41:39.523
And I also believe that governments are attempting to develop their own versions of this technology.

41:39.704 --> 41:44.788
And still, the state of the art of this technology will always be the Truman Show.

41:45.629 --> 41:51.054
It will always be having somebody like Bobby Kennedy surrounded by people who are on a script that he's unaware of.

41:53.991 --> 41:55.472
That's what they attempted to do to me.

41:55.572 --> 41:57.213
That's what they do to a lot of people.

41:57.293 --> 42:02.475
And you can probably signal to these people that you're willing to be one of these people.

42:04.256 --> 42:05.796
But that's not what I was doing.

42:05.836 --> 42:06.857
That's not what I did.

42:06.977 --> 42:11.199
I made sure that people knew that I meant business.

42:12.980 --> 42:17.382
And that's why we find ourselves here now with this ghost of the health freedom movement.

42:17.402 --> 42:19.423
President Trump went through was hard and it was.

42:21.363 --> 42:23.655
The road ahead will not be easy.

42:25.006 --> 42:33.873
I can attest personally that in my work as the Director of National Intelligence, the deep state is fighting us every step of the way.

42:34.973 --> 42:37.635
And it exists within every single federal agency.

42:37.695 --> 42:46.902
And so I feel the same frustration that I see many of you expressing on X or in different platforms about, why aren't things going faster?

42:46.982 --> 42:49.404
Why aren't we getting results more quickly?

42:49.664 --> 42:53.167
I feel this frustration every single day.

42:54.645 --> 42:55.906
We are pushing hard.

42:56.546 --> 42:58.608
Know that they are pushing hard back.

43:00.329 --> 43:06.934
It's pretty remarkable, right, that we're supposed to believe that Tulsi Gabbard is a hardcore patriot.

43:08.955 --> 43:15.560
Tulsi Gabbard the Hindu is a hardcore patriot at the head of the Director of National Latino, like Avril Haines.

43:16.698 --> 43:22.870
who sat in on this public event 201, instead of the real event 201, which happened a year earlier.

43:22.911 --> 43:24.674
You can find the real event 201 at realevent201.com.

43:28.055 --> 43:29.756
I mean, this is all just a ghost.

43:29.896 --> 43:32.679
It's all just an illusion that they all insist exists.

43:32.699 --> 43:36.481
You know, when Brett Weinstein says the health freedom movement, he's conjuring it.

43:37.182 --> 43:42.906
It doesn't exist except for on X because all of these people agree that that's what they're a part of.

43:42.946 --> 43:44.087
And now we shouldn't fight.

43:44.868 --> 43:46.069
That's the big thing again.

43:46.129 --> 43:49.632
Now, you know, Tucker's really trying to say, I don't want to argue with anybody.

43:49.672 --> 43:54.295
That's kind of, I logically the same as me, but you know, some of this stuff is really crazy.

43:54.355 --> 43:56.377
I know lots of people have been killed by the shot.

43:56.417 --> 43:56.557
Yo,

44:01.348 --> 44:02.349
And these are all lies.

44:03.530 --> 44:13.097
The reason why Brandy Vaughn is dead, the reason why Tony Bark is dead, is because they replaced them with other people that were gonna stick to the script.

44:13.997 --> 44:18.360
Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn could not be scripted.

44:19.581 --> 44:20.762
That's the reality of it.

44:23.544 --> 44:29.068
Maybe Joe Rogan couldn't be scripted except for $100 million, so they gave him $100 million.

44:29.168 --> 44:29.789
I don't know.

44:30.970 --> 44:33.672
Maybe Kim Iverson is pretty expensive too.

44:33.813 --> 44:34.693
I have no idea.

44:35.334 --> 44:40.158
I just know that if you can't be scripted, you don't rise on social media.

44:40.218 --> 44:41.179
You are canceled.

44:41.219 --> 44:45.143
You are prevented from spreading or rising on social media.

44:45.163 --> 44:51.989
There's no way to describe the level of the lack of growth that I've had over the last three and a half years.

44:53.050 --> 44:57.914
Um, it started to grow just a little bit when I first started, but after that, it's never,

44:58.789 --> 45:00.150
It's never really gone anywhere.

45:00.591 --> 45:02.933
And that's because there's programming.

45:04.234 --> 45:10.900
There's programming that allows this guy and all the podcast appearances he's appeared on to be everywhere on the internet.

45:12.401 --> 45:18.967
That same with this one, this scripted bullshitter down here about DNA contamination and genetic integration.

45:20.230 --> 45:29.892
Do you know if you go on Rumble and you just do Sasha and COVID, you get like 20 hits that are all Sasha Latupova, but if you do Cooey and COVID, you don't get me.

45:31.573 --> 45:32.233
It's bizarre.

45:33.733 --> 45:36.734
You certainly don't get me if you do JJ and COVID.

45:39.075 --> 45:41.655
You know, we also have another scripted bullshitter here.

45:42.396 --> 45:43.596
Is this gonna not play?

45:43.616 --> 45:47.357
Maybe this is, I gotta check this one and see if they got the animations right on this one.

45:49.369 --> 45:51.851
just probably is running out of memory.

45:54.193 --> 45:58.157
And so we have this guy scripted, you know, very much scripted by Robert Malone.

45:58.197 --> 46:04.142
He asked me not to use Robert Malone's name in our last in face-to-face conversation.

46:05.584 --> 46:11.309
And so I think that's all but an admission at this point that this guy is part of this show.

46:12.359 --> 46:19.966
And, uh, it, I don't like having to say it, but, um, I don't think this guy has any loyalty to the America that I love.

46:20.546 --> 46:23.489
And I don't think this guy has any loyalty to my family.

46:23.529 --> 46:24.450
He doesn't give a shit.

46:24.530 --> 46:25.270
That's for sure.

46:25.290 --> 46:35.960
Um, having been my friend for three years and barbecue buddy for three years, um, it's not like he signed up to give me $10 a month, even for, you know, three months.

46:37.895 --> 46:45.320
The skateboarder Rodney Mullen, who I have a skateboard of behind here, Rodney Mullen gave me like $500 a month for like a year and a half.

46:47.522 --> 46:54.767
So there are people who have supported me when they could, supported me when I was working, and I'm so grateful for it.

46:54.787 --> 47:05.434
But I've had a lot of people fly me around or meet me in places and ask me to do stuff and, you know, ask me to present and, you know, can you come and present to our group again and never given a dime.

47:07.714 --> 47:08.835
It's really weird.

47:11.716 --> 47:20.582
I can't explain why this guy is having scripted bullshit about a lab leak and about open publishing fees and open science.

47:20.642 --> 47:22.783
I mean, it's absurd.

47:23.784 --> 47:31.328
This guy has no business being the head of NIH if Francis Collins is the guy that he's more or less succeeding.

47:31.368 --> 47:32.649
That's just frightening.

47:34.570 --> 47:35.371
I mean, these two,

47:37.553 --> 47:43.397
It's really unfortunate how long people have been trying to tell me this guy's a good guy, this guy's great, he's awesome.

47:44.037 --> 47:50.261
For a brief period of time, he said that he doesn't think he would use any of the vaccine schedule again.

47:50.321 --> 47:58.847
But that's still, for a cardiologist and lifelong doctor, it's still kind of scripted bullshit, right?

47:59.948 --> 48:03.571
Scripted bullshit about a gain-of-function spike protein and how to detox.

48:06.704 --> 48:08.965
It's a dangerous game these people are playing.

48:09.825 --> 48:11.626
Because this fraud can't last.

48:12.166 --> 48:14.807
This is who they have to be for the rest of their lives.

48:16.068 --> 48:19.709
They're never going to be able to say, oh yeah, I was kind of wrong about that spike protein thing.

48:20.389 --> 48:22.630
I guess it's just the methodology in general.

48:22.930 --> 48:24.251
Because if you tell the truth,

48:25.734 --> 48:30.559
What should happen as a consequence of the truth makes itself manifest in the world.

48:31.099 --> 48:32.881
And that's the best possible outcome.

48:33.202 --> 48:39.948
But it's also the most adventurous thing that you can do, the most exciting thing you can do, hands down.

48:40.229 --> 48:41.750
There's nothing that compares to it.

48:42.070 --> 48:48.096
That pathway of maximal responsibility, voluntary,

48:49.082 --> 48:51.444
responsibility and truth.

48:52.124 --> 48:55.247
And I understand that deeply at a religious level.

48:55.267 --> 49:04.154
I understand that that's the symbolic world on which our productive and peaceful culture was properly founded.

49:04.794 --> 49:08.977
And I've seen the effect of communicating that

49:09.838 --> 49:22.906
to people, thousands of people, and it's a great privilege to serve that role, but it's also overwhelming.

49:23.267 --> 49:31.452
You know, I think it's one of the things that made me, I was ill for quite a long time,

49:37.901 --> 49:43.563
Holy barking Christ, we're gonna have to talk about that Jordan Peterson surrounded video, aren't we?

49:43.923 --> 49:45.463
Great, that's just great.

49:45.523 --> 49:47.324
And on my beard day, no less.

49:47.384 --> 49:48.484
That's my beard's birthday.

49:48.504 --> 49:49.385
I don't actually know the exact date.

49:49.405 --> 49:56.167
Now, the reason why I want you to see this guy is Cody, it's called Samore News, has a lot of followers, like a million, and he's pretty good.

49:56.207 --> 49:57.407
Him and his wife are clever.

49:58.007 --> 49:59.448
They're very much left of center.

50:00.929 --> 50:09.282
But what I want you to see is how set up the conservative movements in our respective countries have been by these people.

50:09.342 --> 50:15.952
Because now, of course, Jordan Peterson is one of the flag bearers of the intellectual dark web, of this, you know,

50:17.172 --> 50:44.783
Heterodoxy whatever the bullshit they call themselves And and so they're putting them on these kind of podcast sort of goofball shows Where these extreme narratives can be, you know hammered on by both sides and they can both be always be made to look like fools the conservative movement in America is slowly going to be fractionated on all of these different little fault lines and it's very easy for them to do it and

50:45.555 --> 50:52.679
annoying reaction videos and the endless cycle of hollow online content that ultimately just distracts us from the real injustices in the world.

50:52.839 --> 51:05.486
Now, I do understand that me making a show about somebody who's making a show about something else is extraordinary, but that's where we live because this is how we are being governed.

51:06.247 --> 51:15.172
We have been set up over time because I guess Jordan Peterson said some clever things in some video clips or wrote a book that some people like.

51:16.291 --> 51:27.073
But in the end, he's a mealy mouth piece of shit who said that everybody should just take the shot so we could get this over with and had no principles for more than two years.

51:27.133 --> 51:35.895
And in fact, the opposite of principles, because he was willing to go on large social media platforms and say that everything and everybody should comply.

51:36.255 --> 51:44.237
He went so far as to say that maybe complying would help us get rid of the infectious disease that allows totalitarianism to grow anyway.

51:48.619 --> 52:13.470
And so this is really them taking Jordan Peterson and slapping us across the face with him in a kind of pseudo religious way even because of course him and Russell Brand are two foreigners who were on stage at the rescue the Republic thing with Brett Weinstein and all these other shitheads and both of them are these kind of pseudo Christians that figured it out when they were adults and

52:15.435 --> 52:18.397
but don't seem to have the humility to keep it to themselves.

52:18.597 --> 52:23.020
Don't seem to have the humility to realize that their journey just began.

52:23.080 --> 52:27.984
So maybe they shouldn't be, you know, selling t-shirts and waving flags yet.

52:30.746 --> 52:31.806
And yet that's what they do.

52:33.027 --> 52:34.929
Carrying a cross wrapped in a flag.

52:38.311 --> 52:40.673
Now, just a curious side note here.

52:40.753 --> 52:43.975
I just thought I'd bring this up because it's just come to my mind right now.

52:46.633 --> 52:50.647
I have been collecting on eBay when I find them cheap.

52:52.034 --> 52:56.716
early 1900 and before Bibles.

52:56.776 --> 53:12.543
What I find most interesting to do is to try and find Bibles in alternate languages, especially languages that either I can read or my wife can read, and also languages that I can't read, although those are more difficult to find pre-1900.

53:13.423 --> 53:19.146
What's interesting about it is that most of these books actually don't contain what we would call an Old Testament.

53:21.240 --> 53:24.801
They actually just contain the New Testament of Jesus Christ.

53:26.882 --> 53:27.502
A Dutch one.

53:27.522 --> 53:29.622
I even have a Choctaw one.

53:30.363 --> 53:30.823
That's right.

53:31.563 --> 53:34.504
A New Testament of Jesus Christ in Choctaw.

53:35.984 --> 53:47.808
And so, it's an interesting thing to think about because again, one of the things that is occurring here is what is clearly a fake intellectual debate between

53:50.183 --> 53:52.986
unwitting participants and Jordan Peterson.

53:53.366 --> 54:01.793
Jordan Peterson playing the role of this amorphous Christian who believes in God, but what kind of God and what do you mean by believe?

54:02.314 --> 54:10.100
And his act allows him to be thoroughly dismantled by our friend Cody here.

54:10.421 --> 54:11.422
Until we die.

54:14.484 --> 54:14.725
So,

54:17.045 --> 54:20.146
Cody reacts, Jordan Peterson on Surrounded.

54:37.731 --> 54:52.119
After all, probably the first thing you know about this video, assuming you knew about it at all, was that they changed the title from Christian vs. 20 Atheists to Jordan Peterson vs. 20 Atheists, right after this clip went viral.

54:52.319 --> 54:53.199
You're a Christian.

54:54.040 --> 54:54.740
You say that?

54:54.960 --> 54:55.921
I haven't claimed that.

54:56.061 --> 54:56.661
Well, what is this?

54:56.721 --> 54:58.422
Is this Christians vs. Atheists?

54:59.163 --> 54:59.723
I don't know.

54:59.903 --> 55:01.084
You don't know where you are right now?

55:01.364 --> 55:02.364
Don't be a smartass.

55:02.705 --> 55:05.946
I was under the impression, I was invited to talk to a Christian.

55:05.986 --> 55:07.127
Am I not talking to a Christian?

55:07.984 --> 55:12.288
No, you were invited to... I think everyone should look at the title of the YouTube channel.

55:12.308 --> 55:13.749
You're probably in the wrong YouTube video.

55:14.050 --> 55:17.913
To be fair and balanced, he is being a bit of a smartass, isn't he?

55:18.154 --> 55:25.501
But that clip really does set the tone for the entire uselessness of the video and of Jordan Peterson himself.

55:26.041 --> 55:33.485
They had to change the premise of their video because he wouldn't participate in the way seemingly everyone else agreed to.

55:33.945 --> 55:41.569
Also, for some reason, they kept the thumbnail image of Peterson smiling, which will become funnier and funnier as we show more and more clips of Peterson.

55:41.589 --> 55:47.052
And so now the important thing to realize here is that it's an illusion.

55:47.904 --> 55:52.128
It was always a scripted illusion, 20 atheists versus a Christian.

55:52.228 --> 56:09.104
And the Christian is Jordan Peterson himself, who won't even say what that is or whether he is that it's you who say that, you know, it's like almost a, a twisted, ugly, you know, play on the, uh, you know, you're king of the Jews.

56:09.184 --> 56:12.507
It's, you know, it's you who says that it's really hardcore.

56:12.547 --> 56:13.488
This is so gross.

56:16.246 --> 56:18.388
Here's his face as he talks.

56:18.908 --> 56:29.276
But they definitely had to change the title, because while a video where a Christian who believes in the Bible debates atheists has a clear intent, this video doesn't anymore.

56:29.716 --> 56:36.141
It's just 20 atheists versus some guy with some vague thoughts about religion and stories and stuff.

56:36.741 --> 56:41.886
There's no clear opposing positions, and it immediately makes the entire thing pointless.

56:42.326 --> 56:43.067
Don't watch it.

56:43.347 --> 56:44.388
I wish I didn't.

56:44.889 --> 56:49.073
This change of title also immediately moves the goalposts for Jordan Peterson.

56:49.533 --> 56:58.742
These people presumably sat down thinking they were going to debate a Christian about the specifics of Christian teachings, but Peterson has now presented himself

56:59.082 --> 57:06.988
as a sort of amorphous fog where he can choose which parts of Christianity he chooses to defend and which ones he can sort of brush off.

57:07.489 --> 57:15.515
Well, I can't explain the rapture to you because that isn't something I concern myself with, and that's more of a sectarian belief than something that's central to Christianity.

57:15.795 --> 57:21.179
Now, there's all sorts of evangelical Protestants who might disagree with that, but that doesn't have anything to do with me.

57:21.399 --> 57:23.861
He does this several times throughout.

57:24.061 --> 57:26.803
Someone will say, well, what about the Christian belief in blank?

57:27.084 --> 57:28.845
And he'll just say, well, that doesn't interest him.

57:29.305 --> 57:37.797
At the same time, he'll constantly cite specific parts of the Bible that do interest him to make a point, such as one story that depicts God as unknowable.

57:47.090 --> 57:54.835
Okay, so the implication and implication of that story is that the divine is fundamentally unknowable.

57:55.235 --> 57:56.576
It's a pinnacle experience.

57:56.977 --> 58:03.441
The God that's defined in that manner, right, is not a simple personification.

58:03.501 --> 58:05.362
It's not a simple old man in the sky.

58:05.442 --> 58:09.025
It's something that in its essence is unknowable and overwhelming.

58:09.665 --> 58:16.550
And that isn't, in my experience, the God that's defined by atheists who are attempting to undermine the story.

58:17.319 --> 58:24.083
Sure, but then he'll later note that he doesn't really know which stories are metaphors or truth or what.

58:24.283 --> 58:25.804
Now why am I talking about this?

58:25.884 --> 58:27.045
Why am I talking about this?

58:27.125 --> 58:32.969
Because I believe that Cody is another example, although it's somebody you probably won't see in your YouTube feed,

58:33.889 --> 58:35.069
of how this is done.

58:35.189 --> 58:53.794
Highly produced, well-sponsored, well-meaning people that are unwittingly participating in the creation of and the maintenance of these illusions of consensus about dum-dums and silly ideas and the conservatives being crazy just like they can do the other way around.

58:55.154 --> 58:57.535
This is how we are going to get crushed

58:58.393 --> 59:15.057
from within using social media to create illusions of consensus about what the conservative movement in America is, about what conservatives think, about what Christians think or whatever, I don't know, but it's very, very bad.

59:15.517 --> 59:17.878
And it's only possible because of social media.

59:17.938 --> 59:23.799
And even this guy is probably to a certain extent scripted now.

59:27.108 --> 59:31.591
I'm going to let it play for just a little while longer, and then I'm going to show you why I really brought it on.

59:31.831 --> 59:36.355
But I don't know the answer to the questions that you're asking.

59:37.055 --> 59:43.220
It's the case that forever, when people have been interpreting religious stories, they... Now, why is this relevant, you ask?

59:43.300 --> 59:53.207
Well, because if you want to be a Members Only subscriber to Cody and Just Some News, you can see a special interview with Ro Khanna.

59:54.616 --> 01:00:00.801
It's all about Medicare for all, about Bernie, about economic populism and about JD Vance.

01:00:03.723 --> 01:00:22.937
So the guy who has this beautiful script, who's been queued up to talk about Jordan Peterson and how ridiculous he is and how silly Christians are and whatever other shit he says, has also paid and given, making members only content where he's allowed to interview Ro Khanna.

01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:29.369
And I guess you'd have to ask Mark Kulak about who the hell that is.

01:00:29.449 --> 01:00:29.850
I don't know.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:31.210
He's some Indian guy, I guess.

01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:33.031
No importance here.

01:00:34.372 --> 01:00:36.013
And so we outlined a goal.

01:00:36.353 --> 01:00:42.896
Now, when we outline goals, sometimes we have to pivot along the journey, but it's good to have goals.

01:00:43.856 --> 01:00:54.942
When we had a goal of rolling out AI for our scientific reviewers and staff agency-wide by June 30th, after a very successful pilot,

01:00:55.427 --> 01:01:08.378
Now we've shown you this before, the scripted bullshit in the background, the scripted bullshit from a couple of weeks ago where they were talking about something at the FDA about modernizing things, and this is the introduction that he gave to it.

01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:17.206
I just want to bring to your attention that he was on Meet the Press or some shit like that this weekend, maybe Face the Nation, and was interviewed for 17 minutes.

01:01:19.758 --> 01:01:21.119
So two weeks later, right?

01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:22.861
Or three weeks after this video.

01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:24.562
So just put it all in context.

01:01:25.283 --> 01:01:27.525
Five years of podcasting with these shitheads.

01:01:28.606 --> 01:01:39.716
Now he's the head of the FDA and the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is this super clown child over there, Vinayak Prasad.

01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:44.621
All foreign passport having traders to our grandchildren.

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:48.215
we hit that goal ahead of schedule and under budget.

01:01:48.936 --> 01:01:49.916
It's good to have goals.

01:01:50.496 --> 01:01:59.340
And so one of our biggest goals is to reduce animal testing in a way that's meaningful and continues to protect against public safety.

01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:07.263
And so we'll just move on from here and watch this video.

01:02:08.443 --> 01:02:09.304
I might have to put that

01:02:09.884 --> 01:02:11.085
title in the background here.

01:02:12.005 --> 01:02:14.626
I'm going to escape for a second, make sure this is all ready to go.

01:02:15.386 --> 01:02:18.128
Start with previous, send this to the back, I think is better.

01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:21.029
Maybe we don't.

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:22.749
Maybe we don't need to send that to the back.

01:02:22.769 --> 01:02:25.651
Let's just go.

01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:26.171
Okay.

01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:31.953
This is our Dr. Marty McCary, the FDA commissioner, marking his first 100 days on the job.

01:02:31.993 --> 01:02:36.235
It's been a busy few months with many changes at the agency from vaccines to staffing.

01:02:36.775 --> 01:02:37.936
Good morning, doctor.

01:02:39.116 --> 01:02:40.917
Good morning, Joe.

01:02:41.518 --> 01:02:42.839
Maybe you've been on a few times.

01:02:43.179 --> 01:02:43.800
I don't remember.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.803
But we all went through that period together, obviously.

01:02:47.923 --> 01:02:53.307
And there's a lot of look back now at that period.

01:02:54.848 --> 01:02:56.229
It's a hot button issue.

01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:57.830
And sometimes it's tough to talk about.

01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:00.633
And there's conspiracies and controversies.

01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:02.974
I think of Novak Djokovic.

01:03:03.435 --> 01:03:06.277
Right now, he's going to be in the finals, I think, at Wimbledon.

01:03:06.317 --> 01:03:08.359
And at the time, I wondered about,

01:03:09.366 --> 01:03:12.008
his decision, the decision of tennis.

01:03:12.068 --> 01:03:17.293
What do we know now, doctor, in your view about what we should have done with COVID?

01:03:17.373 --> 01:03:21.416
Should healthy people have been... So COVID exists.

01:03:21.576 --> 01:03:22.957
There were choices to make.

01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:26.000
We didn't have all the choices available to us at the beginning.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.502
You know, maybe some wrong mistakes were made.

01:03:28.562 --> 01:03:32.465
Maybe some lies were told and just hand-waving over 2020 and 2021 until

01:03:34.867 --> 01:03:37.290
You know, the shots were out there and people were being pressured.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.312
What did we do wrong?

01:03:38.872 --> 01:03:40.354
Don't talk about 2020.

01:03:40.475 --> 01:03:41.416
Go ahead, Marty.

01:03:42.717 --> 01:03:45.661
Not forced, but strongly coerced to take that.

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:49.066
At the time, I thought it was a game changer and a lifesaver.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:04:00.409
Look, Joe, I had said during the time of the pandemic that if we have vaccine mandates for young, healthy individuals, we were going to see a rise of an anti-vaccine sentiment.

01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:02.191
And I think that's exactly what happened.

01:04:02.211 --> 01:04:04.033
We saw a tremendous loss.

01:04:04.053 --> 01:04:07.616
So the anti-vaccine sentiment rose because of the mandates.

01:04:07.676 --> 01:04:13.442
And that's very interesting because the frauds like Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Larry Cook

01:04:13.962 --> 01:04:17.163
have all been pushing this idea that we should stop the mandates.

01:04:17.223 --> 01:04:20.625
And so it's always been for many, many years about the mandates.

01:04:21.505 --> 01:04:23.206
It's never been about the biology.

01:04:23.246 --> 01:04:31.789
And that's the very big difference between what we are doing here at Gigaohm Biological and all these frauds from ICANN to CHD.

01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:37.471
That's why we need a 501c3, because we would accomplish something that they can't.

01:04:39.366 --> 01:04:49.013
because we would be scoring touchdowns with the biology, not scoring touchdowns on some amorphous legal principle that's even horribly represented by them.

01:04:51.075 --> 01:04:56.019
Lawyers that don't understand the principle of strict scrutiny are holding the government to it.

01:04:57.153 --> 01:05:00.194
Lawyers that don't understand liability and what it means.

01:05:01.055 --> 01:05:02.075
It's just gross.

01:05:03.135 --> 01:05:13.679
Lawyers that don't understand the difference between implied consent and informed consent and how one is a legal principle and one is like something else that's not in law.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:18.741
I mean, these people are the worst kind of traitors.

01:05:19.441 --> 01:05:21.222
They're happy not to know what's going on.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.823
They're happy to trust the script.

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:25.544
Awesome public trust.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:34.891
study in JAMA found that 71% of people trusted their doctors and hospitals before the COVID pandemic.

01:05:34.951 --> 01:05:36.471
That's down to 40%.

01:05:36.531 --> 01:05:42.573
This is the FDA talking about trust in hospitals and survey numbers about trust in hospitals?

01:05:43.013 --> 01:05:48.855
He can't barely even speak because he knows he's about to be outed as the traitor and foreign meddler that he is.

01:05:49.396 --> 01:05:50.476
This is a fraud.

01:05:51.216 --> 01:05:58.563
sitting over the top of an agency that has been gutted by a early retirement offer and by firings to come.

01:05:59.043 --> 01:06:01.125
There is some serious shit happening here.

01:06:01.185 --> 01:06:06.530
They are willing to burn it down in order to prevent themselves from being taken to justice.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:07.391
I assure you.

01:06:08.712 --> 01:06:10.333
That's a 31 point drop.

01:06:10.774 --> 01:06:11.554
And I think it was from

01:06:12.634 --> 01:06:14.056
ignoring natural immunity.

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:18.422
I think it was from vaccine mandates, insisting that soldiers and and fire.

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:19.804
OK, I got it.

01:06:19.904 --> 01:06:20.785
I got an issue here.

01:06:22.588 --> 01:06:23.308
How do I do that?

01:06:23.969 --> 01:06:24.851
Do I have to bring this up?

01:06:24.951 --> 01:06:28.576
I do shoot should be OK.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:37.802
Um, this is a problem because he's on a script and it's very obvious what script he's on if he says natural immunity.

01:06:37.842 --> 01:06:42.925
So I'm going to go backwards in the video because I want to be sure that we don't miss.

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:55.393
Firefighters and teachers be fired if they don't have the vaccine, even if they were young and healthy and had me found that 71% of people trusted their doctors and hospitals before the COVID pandemic.

01:06:55.414 --> 01:06:55.974
And that's down to 40%.

01:06:56.634 --> 01:06:58.315
That's a 31 point drop.

01:06:58.776 --> 01:07:00.257
And I think it was so poll numbers.

01:07:01.378 --> 01:07:03.400
poll numbers about trust in hospitals.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:14.072
This guy's the FDA, you know, in charge of making sure what is on the label is what's in the bottle, that safe and effective is followed that, you know, that guy is talking about poll numbers right now.

01:07:14.693 --> 01:07:17.015
And then listen to this, because this is crucial.

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:18.717
This is a point you really need to catch.

01:07:19.278 --> 01:07:21.060
And it needs to hit you hard in the stomach.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:21.640
What's from

01:07:22.699 --> 01:07:24.139
Ignoring natural immunity.

01:07:24.299 --> 01:07:26.240
I think it was from vaccine mandates.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.620
Ignoring natural immunity and vaccine mandates.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.261
That's why they lost trust in the government.

01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:38.302
Now, there were a few people in 2020 that were on the natural immunity kick.

01:07:38.482 --> 01:07:41.123
One of them was the illustrious Michael Yeadon.

01:07:42.163 --> 01:07:49.204
Mike Yeadon was saying that, you know, I'm a respiratory physiologist and we would have previous immunity to other viruses.

01:07:49.284 --> 01:07:52.305
So this new virus wouldn't be as dangerous as they say.

01:07:54.522 --> 01:07:58.606
So Mike Eden, from the very beginning, accepted the existence of the novel virus.

01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:02.330
Didn't usefully challenge PCR at all.

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:14.882
In fact, let himself be a part of that stupid paper that Claire Craig and Kevin McKernan orchestrated to oppose the Corman-Jorstin PCR test used by the WHO.

01:08:16.567 --> 01:08:35.924
Mike Eden is a fraud, and he is a scripted fraud for sure, because Mike Eden brought to the table two things very clearly in the beginning, and he brought them to the table, usually in front of a CHD microphone, even if he was on the street in London, and that's something that only now becomes very significant to me.

01:08:37.734 --> 01:08:45.640
But the idea that natural immunity is proof that the virus was there is something to argue about, accepts the existence of the virus.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:55.627
And Mike Yeadon was saying that there is previous immunity to other respiratory diseases because he's a respiratory physiologist who used to work for Pfizer.

01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:57.469
And so you can trust him on that.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:08:59.710
And you accepted and I accepted the virus.

01:09:00.211 --> 01:09:05.375
And in fact, I taught immunology for a year and learned it myself as best I could.

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:09.638
because I thought I had to understand the mechanisms of natural immunity.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.321
So I learned virology.

01:09:14.762 --> 01:09:15.062
You see?

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.314
All because Mike Eden was a scripted traitor as well.

01:09:20.394 --> 01:09:23.698
He might not have understood the script that he was sticking to.

01:09:23.718 --> 01:09:36.153
He might not have understood how malevolent the outcome would be because his advocating for the existence of natural immunity also meant that it was worthwhile to question exactly how dangerous is this virus to you.

01:09:36.653 --> 01:09:43.676
Maybe it's not so dangerous to Mike Eden because he's healthy and has been a respiratory physiologist exposed to a lot of this stuff for his whole life.

01:09:44.116 --> 01:09:55.360
Whereas you might be a frail old lady who might need help from this dangerous virus because Kevin McCarron says, and Charles Rixey says it's the most dangerous and contagious pathogen on earth ever.

01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:18.906
The natural immunity mentioned in this podcast or this interview one day ago is an admission that this is part of the script because that can't keep coming up unless we are on a hamster wheel and the same shit-covered rungs are coming back every six months.

01:10:18.946 --> 01:10:23.949
You know, like natural immunity and herd immunity and circulating antibodies.

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:25.270
Come on, guys!

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:36.279
Insisting that soldiers and firefighters and teachers be fired if they don't have the vaccine even if they were young and healthy and had the infection already.

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:44.186
They had circulating antibodies that could neutralize the virus but they were antibodies the government did not recognize because it failed to recognize natural immunity.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:51.273
So we lost a lot of ground in public trust and we're trying to rebuild that now through radical transparency and being very honest and telling people

01:10:51.633 --> 01:10:53.314
The government is not your doctor.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:57.178
Talk to your doctor and get good advice from your doctor's wisdom and judgment.

01:10:58.258 --> 01:11:08.767
There are some changes at the Vaccine Advisory Committee that a lot of hand-wringing and consternation about the new members.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:11.529
Is it anti-vax, doctor, would you say?

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:17.314
How would you describe your approach to preemptive disease management?

01:11:19.076 --> 01:11:29.465
Look, I think over at CDC, a different agency, they do have a reconstituted ACIP committee with a diversity of views among people who do believe that vaccines save lives.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:35.130
The past committee had pushed for COVID boosters in young, healthy people.

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:37.652
And of course, that is probably why we see

01:11:38.112 --> 01:11:39.333
such a backlash today.

01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:43.615
There was never great evidence for repeat boosters in young, healthy children.

01:11:43.635 --> 01:11:48.157
As a matter of fact, there was a myocarditis risk that was largely downplayed in young males.

01:11:48.817 --> 01:11:57.982
And I think if you look at the track record of that committee, there's a reason why 85% of healthcare workers did not get a COVID booster last fall.

01:11:58.342 --> 01:12:05.025
So we're taking an evidence-based- Think about the shitty questions that he's implying are important.

01:12:05.085 --> 01:12:06.826
We should be asking questions like,

01:12:07.486 --> 01:12:10.909
Why didn't the majority of healthcare workers get a booster last year?

01:12:13.011 --> 01:12:14.031
What a stupid question.

01:12:16.473 --> 01:12:19.416
Why did the majority of Americans not get a booster last year?

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:20.476
What a stupid question.

01:12:22.558 --> 01:12:28.443
There was no evidence for people to get boosters seems to imply that there was evidence for the first two shots.

01:12:31.308 --> 01:12:32.889
You have to listen carefully.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.190
They talk too fast.

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:37.572
The script is too orchestrated at this point.

01:12:37.872 --> 01:12:38.913
You can just miss it.

01:12:39.253 --> 01:12:41.535
But the entire script is an enchantment.

01:12:46.058 --> 01:12:47.339
We may have a crash here.

01:12:50.989 --> 01:13:01.252
Dr. Vinay Prasad and I outlined it in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we're basically saying that there's got to be a risk stratified approach, that is high risk versus low risk.

01:13:01.332 --> 01:13:08.694
Does a healthy 12-year-old girl today need another 60 doses in her average lifespan?

01:13:08.714 --> 01:13:14.936
That is a scientific unknown, and we'd like to see a clinical trial before approving the vaccine for that reason.

01:13:15.814 --> 01:13:32.860
How does removing the recommendation, though, increase choice, increase the patient's ability to come to a decision with doctors, since so many insurance plans and programs depend on ASIP and CDC recommendations in order to provide the no-cost, low-cost vaccines?

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.701
Isn't this removing choice effectively from patients?

01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:39.322
So even she agrees that it's about choice.

01:13:42.972 --> 01:13:46.794
So it's about mandates or choice or freedom.

01:13:47.475 --> 01:13:51.937
It's not about the biology that is really plain and simple.

01:13:52.598 --> 01:13:57.800
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea that originated in the early 1800s.

01:13:57.861 --> 01:13:58.621
Full stop.

01:14:01.983 --> 01:14:04.925
We don't need to come up with a real firm

01:14:06.278 --> 01:14:14.063
psychological model for why it is that after that bad idea started in the late 1800s that it's perpetuated itself until now.

01:14:14.643 --> 01:14:20.787
Unless you just want to say that, you know, at some point the Rockefellers realized that people hadn't figured anything out yet.

01:14:21.407 --> 01:14:26.390
And so if we just took over right now, while people are this stupid, holy shit,

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:29.851
We could have this go to impurity.

01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:31.011
We could manage them.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:32.352
We could depopulate them.

01:14:32.392 --> 01:14:33.472
We can do whatever we want.

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:39.015
If they believe intramuscular injection is good, why not make a bunch of products from my oil or some shit like that?

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:39.455
I don't know.

01:14:41.124 --> 01:14:43.265
We don't need to come up with that explanation.

01:14:43.385 --> 01:14:46.326
All we need to do is teach our children that that is the history.

01:14:46.406 --> 01:14:48.547
I have books over there on the shelf that can show it.

01:14:48.587 --> 01:15:00.471
Mark has articles and PDFs and references that he, that show it, that it's not some kind of brilliant thing that happened at the end of a long evolution of our interaction with ourselves.

01:15:00.591 --> 01:15:09.874
No, it really originates from trying to treat wounds, really grave wounds by getting the pain relief local.

01:15:11.431 --> 01:15:11.792
That's it.

01:15:13.396 --> 01:15:15.622
And now we're in big trouble.

01:15:19.684 --> 01:15:25.368
Secretary Kennedy is to let people know that vaccines will be available if people want them.

01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:27.449
You will be able to get a vaccine if you want them.

01:15:27.469 --> 01:15:29.550
So that's a decision between you and your doctor.

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:34.994
And each individual insurance company has their own policy.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:42.178
Some insurance companies don't pay for important cancer treatments for patients that I saw as a cancer surgeon.

01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:46.321
And so that is another entire issue that's unrelated to the FDA.

01:15:47.682 --> 01:16:07.719
OK, so the fact that private insurers, employer-sponsored insurance plans, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, the Vaccines for Children program, all of them link providing no-cost vaccines to CDC and ACIP recommendations, that removing the recommendations doesn't remove in some way the choice

01:16:07.759 --> 01:16:13.842
And don't forget that the FDA is looked to by other countries as well, including places like the Netherlands and Germany.

01:16:13.922 --> 01:16:18.165
So this is not to be underestimated how much power this puppet actually has.

01:16:18.845 --> 01:16:22.367
Or let's say the people whose hands are inside of this puppet.

01:16:24.008 --> 01:16:29.691
That patients can make, especially the vulnerable patients who may not be able to afford to pay.

01:16:31.937 --> 01:16:33.357
That's right, it does not remove the choice.

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:42.060
And our job at the FDA is, and this is a charge by Congress, is to look at applications that are submitted to us and determine what is safe and effective.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.800
And so that is what we are committed to.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:53.562
I think there was some lost trust in the FDA when there was a new policy that basically said for a young, healthy 15-year-old boy,

01:16:55.663 --> 01:17:01.968
We were going to rubber stamp a COVID vaccine without a clinical trial every year in perpetuity and the kid must get it.

01:17:02.109 --> 01:17:02.509
And I think.

01:17:02.729 --> 01:17:12.858
So here now he's trying to pretend that the issue is, is that we weren't, we just gave blanket approval to a COVID shot and we were going to change it without doing clinical trials.

01:17:12.938 --> 01:17:14.679
And so that's crazy, man.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.082
I want to do clinical trials on the COVID shot.

01:17:17.182 --> 01:17:18.563
I want to make sure it's safe.

01:17:21.974 --> 01:17:25.115
We're saying we're going to be less absolutist when there's no evidence.

01:17:25.155 --> 01:17:41.823
I think the most dangerous thing you can do in public health is to demand something of a young, healthy individual when the evidence is just not that supportive for a new virus that creates a new protein and a new vaccine that creates a new protein where we haven't had a clinical trial in over four years.

01:17:41.943 --> 01:17:45.485
And those results in children were mixed back four years ago.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:18:00.137
The basic tenets of M.A.H., of MAHA, or Make America Healthy Again, it seems to me... So he also thinks that there is a Make America Healthy Again movement that has tenets.

01:18:01.437 --> 01:18:05.259
You see, it's one great big enchantment.

01:18:05.279 --> 01:18:12.201
They are conjuring something that cannot exist without the explicit and

01:18:14.099 --> 01:18:17.202
complete acquiescence to the use of social media.

01:18:17.302 --> 01:18:19.044
Otherwise, this is all bullshit.

01:18:19.124 --> 01:18:20.666
Nobody agrees like that.

01:18:22.027 --> 01:18:22.488
Nobody.

01:18:23.995 --> 01:18:26.436
It's proactive health care versus reactive.

01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:28.857
You'd have to do that with children, I think.

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:39.160
And I immediately think about, as a country, our levels of obesity are just much higher than they need to be or should be.

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:48.304
What does tackling that entail, and how does it play into these new drugs, and whether you really start

01:18:49.444 --> 01:18:49.804
I don't know.

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:52.046
Is that what we need to do to all our kids?

01:18:52.707 --> 01:18:55.249
With Wegovy or Ozempic or something, doctor?

01:18:55.909 --> 01:18:56.590
What's the answer?

01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:57.310
Is it foods?

01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:58.611
Is it additives?

01:18:59.032 --> 01:19:00.593
The secretary has a lot of ideas.

01:19:02.472 --> 01:19:03.872
Yeah, it's all of the above, Joe.

01:19:03.932 --> 01:19:06.933
And we've not been talking about root causes in health care.

01:19:06.973 --> 01:19:12.314
I've been in academic medicine and been at all, all the major institutions giving grand rounds.

01:19:12.354 --> 01:19:13.995
We don't talk about root causes.

01:19:14.055 --> 01:19:19.276
We don't ask, why do 40% of our nation's children now have a chronic disease?

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:24.277
Why do a third of our nation's children now have prediabetes or diabetes?

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:29.079
We've got to talk about school lunch programs, not just putting every six-year-old on Ozempic.

01:19:29.359 --> 01:19:36.401
We've got to talk about environmental exposures and chemicals in the food, not just chemotherapy.

01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:41.723
If you look at the types of cancer that are going up in young people, they are the GI cancers.

01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:45.324
That is the organ that interfaces with what we eat.

01:19:45.404 --> 01:19:47.525
So we've got to look at all the chemicals.

01:19:47.585 --> 01:19:52.587
We are doing an inventory of the 1,000-plus chemicals banned in Europe that appear in the U.S.

01:19:52.607 --> 01:19:53.227
food supply.

01:19:53.627 --> 01:19:55.788
He should have Robert Malone do that inventory.

01:19:55.828 --> 01:20:10.452
He was able to screen all the known nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog in a matter of three weeks in January of 2020 to come up with silicoxib, famotidine, ivermectin, and remdesivir.

01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:11.947
He could have helped you.

01:20:12.067 --> 01:20:13.908
I mean, he did way more than $20,000.

01:20:13.968 --> 01:20:16.210
Come on, that's cakewalk for Domain.

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:22.675
You saw our action to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S.

01:20:22.695 --> 01:20:23.975
food supply by next year.

01:20:23.995 --> 01:20:26.938
We're getting tremendous participation by the food manufacturers.

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:29.819
We are looking into baby formula innovation.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:34.340
That recipe, the FDA issues hasn't been updated essentially in 30 years.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.561
We need more innovation.

01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:40.283
Moms want baby formula without added sugar, without corn syrup, without seed oils.

01:20:40.643 --> 01:20:41.783
We need more innovation.

01:20:41.883 --> 01:20:43.404
It's been a regulatory failure.

01:20:44.364 --> 01:20:48.085
So we need to fix our infant formula.

01:20:48.165 --> 01:20:52.727
I mean, these are such fringe issues with regard to where we're going, you know.

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:56.209
where we should be going, what we should be teaching our kids.

01:20:56.389 --> 01:20:58.871
It's just, it's absolutely effed up.

01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:03.494
Asking the big question, why does it take 10 years for a drug to come to market?

01:21:03.974 --> 01:21:09.538
I mean, that is a giant existential question, and we're going to have to challenge deeply held assumptions to answer it.

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:11.220
So we announced our program

01:21:12.341 --> 01:21:25.624
to reduce animal testing and replace it with computational modeling and organ-on-a-chip technology whereby drugs can be tested on cell culture medium in a lab with cells from the liver or heart or other organoids.

01:21:26.324 --> 01:21:29.745
We have a priority pathway now to pilot.

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:39.448
Think about how much easier it will be to justify drugs if you only have to pass a toxicity test which is based on an AI

01:21:40.999 --> 01:21:48.323
model system and a culture cell line, you know, under the guise of using less animals.

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:50.484
You see how disingenuous this is?

01:21:50.945 --> 01:21:56.288
It sort of implies that we just use animals willy-nilly in research and we never did that.

01:21:57.408 --> 01:22:02.751
Every person in neuroscience is required to take a training almost every year about that kind of thing.

01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.792
There are books about it.

01:22:03.812 --> 01:22:10.176
There are whole classes that you could take in the Netherlands in marketing and where you had to go away and stay for a week

01:22:11.024 --> 01:22:25.736
in order to learn the fine art of minimizing the number of animals that you use and choosing the least complicated model that required the least amount of moral sacrifices in order to answer the question.

01:22:27.714 --> 01:22:28.895
We've done this already.

01:22:28.935 --> 01:22:49.790
The idea of getting rid of animal testing in terms of toxicology and these other things is very, very extraordinary and something that is absolutely in line not with saving the animals, not with thinking about animal rights, not with saving the beagles, but it is with this transition of our grandchildren

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:52.211
to experimental animal status.

01:22:52.331 --> 01:23:05.297
And one of the steps in that transition is to make sure that everybody believes that animals are either useless, or conscious, or amoral in terms of experimental subjects.

01:23:05.337 --> 01:23:15.002
So this is all, you know, I'm, I'm a guy who is a biologist all the way to the bone, and I don't think there's anything wrong with I think it's even great.

01:23:17.677 --> 01:23:33.968
to take a child around 12 years old and put a frog in some ether and pin it down on a thing and cut it open while its heart is still beating and its lungs are still beating and its guts are there so that a child can actually see it.

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:40.013
Because the imagination is fueled by real experience.

01:23:40.093 --> 01:23:46.117
And so if you can see the inside of a working frog and move it around a little bit, if you can add some salt,

01:23:48.476 --> 01:23:59.007
You can start to imagine what's going on in your body very easily and then come to the real, real important conclusion that you are as fragile as that little frog.

01:24:00.789 --> 01:24:06.254
A sharp knife away from being wide open and a deep cut away from being close to dead.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.640
I'm not saying you should dissect a hundred million frogs.

01:24:12.998 --> 01:24:15.479
But I am saying that animal experiments are useful.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.442
I am saying that animal physiology is a worthwhile endeavor.

01:24:20.282 --> 01:24:27.006
I don't think that we should just never experiment on anything else because there's nothing to be learned there.

01:24:27.166 --> 01:24:30.568
Even the knowledge itself justifies the pursuit.

01:24:30.628 --> 01:24:33.950
Just the knowledge of insects justifies dissecting a few.

01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:42.195
If only to understand a little bit more about how irreducibly complex the system in which we find ourselves is.

01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:52.475
And so this, this is really an infantile idea that we have to reduce or get rid of animal testing is an infantile idea.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:55.817
And it assumes that nothing has ever been done.

01:24:56.297 --> 01:25:03.502
There is no concern like this in the professional scene that he was actually a part of, he claims for a very long time.

01:25:03.922 --> 01:25:11.587
And so it's a horrible, horribly disingenuous representation of academia in the Western world.

01:25:11.888 --> 01:25:12.388
I'm sorry.

01:25:14.158 --> 01:25:18.661
Can we get a decision out in weeks instead of a year once that final application is approved?

01:25:18.721 --> 01:25:20.682
Can we run more continuous trials?

01:25:21.243 --> 01:25:24.865
And can we use AI more in the review process?

01:25:24.925 --> 01:25:28.387
We now have AI agency-wide for our reviewers.

01:25:28.607 --> 01:25:40.816
And yesterday, we announced we're going to make our decision letters, including rejection letters for drug, public information so companies don't spin the results and developers can see exactly how the FDA thinks.

01:25:40.896 --> 01:25:43.057
And that's part of our radical transparency

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.678
So what would be the difference?

01:25:44.698 --> 01:25:47.480
What about dissecting a chicken that I'm going to eat?

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.661
I can go there too.

01:25:48.741 --> 01:25:49.462
It's fine with me.

01:25:49.502 --> 01:25:51.723
We don't need to use a frog that we're not going to eat.

01:25:52.804 --> 01:25:57.527
What if I raise a chicken and at some point we're going to eat the chicken?

01:25:57.547 --> 01:25:58.708
Can I dissect it then?

01:25:58.788 --> 01:26:00.590
Can we do it then?

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:02.771
Because I don't understand this part.

01:26:04.312 --> 01:26:05.593
Like, I really don't.

01:26:05.733 --> 01:26:09.876
As a biologist, you know, you could even look at it as a Christian.

01:26:09.896 --> 01:26:11.077
This was all given to us.

01:26:11.137 --> 01:26:11.998
We are gardeners.

01:26:13.422 --> 01:26:24.847
I think that humans, that people were put on this earth to be gardeners, the gardeners of their mind, gardeners of their own body, and gardeners of the plants and animals around them.

01:26:24.887 --> 01:26:35.652
There's no other explanation for how most animals, even wild ones, are somewhat amenable to petting and scratching and contact.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:56.614
I've had too much experience with captive tigers and lions to know that, yes, animals remain wild in the sense that they have a repertoire of behaviors, just like my teenage boys have a repertoire of behaviors that extends quite, quite wide on the extreme ends.

01:26:57.674 --> 01:27:06.078
You can kind of hope you never provoke any of these extreme behaviors, but they exist in the spectrum of potential behavior that my teenager has.

01:27:06.158 --> 01:27:18.785
And yes, that breadth and depth of potential behavior is probably greater and more dangerous in a animal that is directly from the wild or descending from wild animals.

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:26.529
But it doesn't change the fact that I'd bet dollars to donuts that if you gave me a wild wolf puppy,

01:27:27.279 --> 01:27:38.586
from birth, you know, and weaned it at 12 weeks after its mom had fed it long enough that I could raise that animal not to kill my kids and to kill strangers.

01:27:39.366 --> 01:27:41.087
I mean, that I'm confident of.

01:27:41.788 --> 01:27:50.633
And so for me, I understand why you think of vivisection as the high school class where there's, you know, frogs and everybody's going to kill one.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:52.334
But in a world

01:27:53.584 --> 01:28:01.928
where nobody is dissecting their own food anymore, where nobody is raising their own food and doesn't have the respect that it has.

01:28:01.968 --> 01:28:09.472
You know, if you have a chicken produce eggs for two years before you eat it, when you kill that animal, you'll have a very different respect for it.

01:28:09.532 --> 01:28:14.635
And also you'll have a different respect for the bone broth and for the roast chicken that comes from it.

01:28:15.495 --> 01:28:18.296
So that's what I mean by vivisection.

01:28:18.316 --> 01:28:20.577
That's what I mean by dissecting an animal.

01:28:22.578 --> 01:28:27.760
Again, I'm not suggesting that kids should have an endless supply of frogs that they can play with every day.

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.261
That's not, I don't mean that at all.

01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:33.063
I don't mean that they should, you know, progress to cherry bombs and that kind of thing.

01:28:33.103 --> 01:28:40.986
But what I mean is that there are experiences which, if done correctly, will induce a kind of humility for all life.

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:46.577
I don't want to dissect a frog again would be the perfect outcome.

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:50.198
Right?

01:28:50.838 --> 01:28:53.078
In my mind, it would be the perfect outcome.

01:28:56.739 --> 01:28:58.819
It's not going to be the outcome that every kid has.

01:28:59.039 --> 01:29:07.361
If you say that I'm going to, you know, we're going to kill this chicken and eat it, put it on the barbecue and the act of killing, you know, might make some kids not want chicken for a little while.

01:29:07.421 --> 01:29:07.761
I don't know.

01:29:09.144 --> 01:29:12.925
But we've got to be honest and real with the real world.

01:29:13.185 --> 01:29:14.425
And we're not there anymore.

01:29:14.465 --> 01:29:20.026
And that's why this bad biology is so easy to push on kids because it's so abstract.

01:29:20.967 --> 01:29:26.448
And their understanding of themselves and the way that they fit into this world is so abstract.

01:29:26.488 --> 01:29:27.528
And we have to change that.

01:29:27.548 --> 01:29:28.768
And we have to change it now.

01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:30.249
We really do.

01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:30.689
Agenda.

01:29:31.431 --> 01:29:44.974
I wanted to talk to you, Dr. McCary, about the national priority vouchers, which does aim to speed up the approval process after a final drug application is submitted, to get it down to one to two months, as opposed to 10 to 12 months.

01:29:45.014 --> 01:29:49.695
For national priorities, what qualifies as a national priority?

01:29:49.735 --> 01:29:54.336
I mean, let's say there's an obesity drug that's even better than the ones out on the market.

01:29:54.376 --> 01:29:56.957
Is that a national priority for the FDA?

01:29:58.757 --> 01:29:59.417
to consider.

01:29:59.537 --> 01:30:04.639
So just as I said, they are just here to take all the teeth out of the FDA.

01:30:05.459 --> 01:30:09.280
These national vouchers are just taking the teeth out of the FDA.

01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:14.202
We no longer need to regulate safe and effective before a product comes to market.

01:30:14.662 --> 01:30:16.743
We'll let a product come to market and then we'll

01:30:17.549 --> 01:30:23.993
I guess, pull the pin if we see a signal that indicates it might not be safe and effective.

01:30:24.033 --> 01:30:26.375
That's the new strategy of the FDA.

01:30:26.915 --> 01:30:27.916
That's what they're gonna do.

01:30:28.516 --> 01:30:31.518
And that is essentially testing it on people.

01:30:33.579 --> 01:30:35.060
Just like they did with the vaccine.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.262
We're never gonna really know until we roll it out, right?

01:30:37.342 --> 01:30:38.883
So this is the reality.

01:30:38.923 --> 01:30:40.504
They are inverting our sovereignty.

01:30:41.539 --> 01:30:51.073
into experimental animal status because they, on the inside, are all of the consensus that we've pretty much exhausted all that we can learn from mouse and monkey experiments.

01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:53.376
And they're really expensive anyway.

01:30:54.477 --> 01:30:55.719
Expedited process.

01:30:55.839 --> 01:30:57.422
What falls into the category?

01:30:58.649 --> 01:30:59.510
Great question, Melissa.

01:31:14.918 --> 01:31:28.467
adamant that he would like to see lower drug prices for Americans, and he doesn't like it that Americans are getting ripped off with drugs that are two, five, ten times higher in the United States than in London or France or Germany, other OECD countries.

01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:33.130
So we are including the affordability of drugs as a national priority.

01:31:33.190 --> 01:31:40.155
So we have a committee that's set up that will determine which products and companies will get these vouchers as a part of a pilot.

01:31:40.475 --> 01:31:41.716
Look, we've got to try new things.

01:31:41.976 --> 01:31:44.458
We've got to ask ourselves,

01:31:44.838 --> 01:31:48.280
Why does it take so long for a cure to come to market?

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.381
And we want to see more cures and meaningful treatments for Americans.

01:31:51.821 --> 01:32:03.406
We want to see big data used so we can have eyes on a drug immediately after approval and not just wake up five years later and say, hey, Vioxx may have killed 38,000 people.

01:32:03.466 --> 01:32:05.147
Maybe we need to take action.

01:32:05.287 --> 01:32:10.829
Or opioids may have killed nearly a million Americans 19 years after the approval of OxyContin.

01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:14.251
We're going to be having an incredible post-market surveillance program.

01:32:14.671 --> 01:32:16.032
where we monitor drugs.

01:32:16.252 --> 01:32:18.593
I don't know how many of those numbers and what that means.

01:32:18.653 --> 01:32:24.636
I think he was throwing out something there, but a million he was talking about since the approval of Oxycontin or something like that.

01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:27.057
Strange statement to make there.

01:32:27.097 --> 01:32:28.198
That was a really weird one.

01:32:28.238 --> 01:32:30.799
Just a, just a fire hose.

01:32:30.919 --> 01:32:37.443
I don't know who Nick's Nick's Nicolay Slayer's resonant one, two, three.

01:32:38.423 --> 01:32:40.866
Nicolates, resonant, one, two, three.

01:32:41.286 --> 01:32:45.310
Lots of interesting comments that have nothing to do with bacteria and bacteriophages.

01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:48.213
Lots of resonant and stuff like that.

01:32:48.253 --> 01:32:48.993
It's cool stuff.

01:32:49.153 --> 01:32:51.175
Interesting comments.

01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:54.178
But yeah, you should post them on the soapbox.

01:32:54.418 --> 01:32:57.641
Immediately after approval, using big data and the cloud.

01:32:57.661 --> 01:33:03.147
And if we do it well, it can actually change the threshold for approval, especially when it comes to rare diseases.

01:33:04.107 --> 01:33:13.955
Can you give us an example of a health crisis right now, just so we have an idea of what source of drugs, what source of companies may be seeking to use this National Priority Voucher Program?

01:33:15.016 --> 01:33:21.161
You know, one of the cool things, Melissa, in this job is you get to see potentially promising treatments that are in the pipeline.

01:33:21.341 --> 01:33:24.244
And I'd like to see a cure for type 1 diabetes.

01:33:24.664 --> 01:33:28.227
I'd like to see more cancer therapies that apply to stage.

01:33:28.287 --> 01:33:28.788
What is that?

01:33:28.808 --> 01:33:29.768
I mean, a cure?

01:33:30.874 --> 01:33:32.375
This is remarkable, right?

01:33:32.435 --> 01:33:34.457
I mean, what does that imply?

01:33:34.817 --> 01:33:37.079
What is a cure for type 1 diabetes?

01:33:37.119 --> 01:33:38.060
I think it's a genetic.

01:33:38.721 --> 01:33:45.526
For metastatic disease and cancer therapies that result in what we call in medicine a complete pathologic response.

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:47.588
That is, the cancer melts away.

01:33:47.928 --> 01:33:50.491
There already appears to be some therapy.

01:33:50.511 --> 01:33:52.812
And of course, again, this is kind of the same

01:33:53.613 --> 01:33:59.797
It's on the same tip as the shot has SB40 in it, so it's causing cancer in a lot of people.

01:34:00.317 --> 01:34:03.759
Now he's got a number of different ways that they're gonna cure cancer.

01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:13.444
Is he unaware that there's a whole sect of America and Canada and Australia and Europe that thinks ivermectin cures cancer as long as you combine it with something else?

01:34:14.225 --> 01:34:15.845
It's incredible.

01:34:15.885 --> 01:34:17.366
Of course this is all bullshit.

01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:19.107
This is a scripted bullshitter.

01:34:20.868 --> 01:34:21.849
He was put in place.

01:34:22.915 --> 01:34:24.976
He's on a script provided by Robert Malone.

01:34:52.915 --> 01:35:10.866
A lot of angst and... Neurodegenerative space has a lot of these, you know, genetic models of disease, genes tied to Alzheimer's, genes tied to protein folding, all kinds of bullshit that they have no idea.

01:35:11.506 --> 01:35:14.688
Notice that Google Fold still hasn't figured out how prions work.

01:35:14.768 --> 01:35:19.051
Google Fold hasn't explained to us why amyloid plaques form.

01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:20.792
It's just kind of a joke.

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:28.406
in panic about layoffs at the FDA.

01:35:29.286 --> 01:35:30.947
Was it bloated?

01:35:31.907 --> 01:35:33.287
Did it need restructuring?

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:37.408
Is 15% a big number in terms of layoffs, doctor?

01:35:37.428 --> 01:35:45.931
Because there are some people that say it's going to safeguarding the drugs that come into this country, manufactured elsewhere, are at risk now.

01:35:45.971 --> 01:35:47.731
There's not enough people to monitor.

01:35:49.091 --> 01:35:51.392
What do you make of that, that criticism?

01:35:52.691 --> 01:35:53.431
That's not true.

01:35:53.531 --> 01:35:59.473
So there were no layoffs to scientific reviewers or inspectors or our law enforcement division.

01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:18.060
And so now he's got to cover all of his bases or cover his ass and not make sure that you don't really think it's too big a deal that some people took early retirement and not think it's too big a deal that they're firing a lot of people and that will change any way that the organization functions because they don't want the organization to do anything anymore.

01:36:18.899 --> 01:36:20.160
They wanted to get out of the way.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.882
That's why they toured the United States talking to CEOs about what they would like behind closed doors.

01:36:25.303 --> 01:36:31.706
At the FDA, you know, we do inspections around the world and we're leveling the playing field on that front.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:34.148
But there were early retirements.

01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:37.690
Are you telling me, Nick, in the chat, Nicolate

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:53.027
resonant one two three that you believe that dna is a resonant thing and that there's organized water and that electromagnetic radiation is is everything but you also believe in prions

01:36:54.244 --> 01:36:55.025
Are you serious?

01:36:55.545 --> 01:36:59.809
Because if you're serious, then I know all I need to know.

01:36:59.829 --> 01:37:01.911
Wow, that's pretty hilarious.

01:37:02.071 --> 01:37:02.811
Fantastic.

01:37:03.372 --> 01:37:04.713
Thanks for joining the chat.

01:37:05.714 --> 01:37:07.395
You're probably in the wrong show.

01:37:07.435 --> 01:37:09.057
You're probably at the wrong broadcast.

01:37:09.397 --> 01:37:17.564
And so we're actively- Wow, that's a remarkable level of broken.

01:37:18.004 --> 01:37:21.908
If you actually think, for example, I bet you think

01:37:23.416 --> 01:37:33.170
I have multiple... I have multiple copies of this book because I use them as my left and right supports for when I do calf raises.

01:37:33.671 --> 01:37:38.318
I don't know how many people have sent me this stupid book, but oh my gosh, like...

01:37:39.918 --> 01:37:51.269
If you're a guy that would share that book, and you believe that prions also are real, I don't know what to tell you, man, but you gotta find better biologists.

01:37:51.349 --> 01:37:53.190
Better biology coaches is what you need.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:59.937
Reviewers, normally there's a vacancy rate because there's a turnover in scientific reviewers, but no scientific reviewers were laid off.

01:38:00.237 --> 01:38:04.421
There were tremendous redundancies in the empire building culture.

01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:13.527
the fiefdoms of the centers at the FDA, and they became their own independent organizations, and they had very little accountability.

01:38:13.908 --> 01:38:18.431
They had their own revenue stream from user fees, and they had redundant services as a result.

01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:21.193
That is, we had 12 different travel offices.

01:38:21.998 --> 01:38:28.344
Explaining the phenomenon of pre-on like a bad chord doesn't make the phenomenon real.

01:38:28.985 --> 01:38:42.937
If you understand it to the level where it's a mathematical relationship between frequencies of vibration, then you should be able to use Google Fold to explain to me exactly where those vibrations are coming from, where those resonance are coming from.

01:38:43.477 --> 01:39:03.718
and show me how it changes when you change a single amino acid and then it stabilizes and doesn't do that anymore and that would be ridiculously simple if it was ridiculously simple like it's just a resonant thing and it's like a chord that's out of tune come on dude come on dude this is a place for serious thinking not for clowns

01:39:04.218 --> 01:39:10.380
had nearly 2,000 HR person people and budget and procurement staff.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.161
And a lot of it was just because of the center fiefdom culture.

01:39:14.201 --> 01:39:23.144
So we've consolidated that now to say, if we're going to launch AI for the FDA reviewers, as we recently did, we're going to do it agency-wide.

01:39:23.184 --> 01:39:26.745
It's not going to be each center independently with their own IT teams.

01:39:27.385 --> 01:39:42.269
So AI, again, is this rollout of a machine learning algorithm that supposedly does something that they think is true, is real, is high fidelity, is useful, or maybe the next version will be.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:50.012
And so again, we're transitioning a bedrock part of our sort of regulatory structure into a

01:39:51.112 --> 01:40:04.841
free zone of nonsense that includes artificial intelligence being used as a tool and also modeling and AI being used as a way to screen drugs for their use and marketing.

01:40:06.242 --> 01:40:12.186
And so an application to the FDA is now transitioning to a ability to market something.

01:40:12.226 --> 01:40:19.831
All you got to do is just put the application through and then we'll fast track you to, to post marketing surveillance.

01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:27.773
And of course, the only people who will get this privilege will be the, you know, the rich and greedy that are already getting that privilege.

01:40:27.813 --> 01:40:32.116
And so it doesn't really feel like a lot of radical transparency here.

01:40:32.156 --> 01:40:34.178
It feels like a lot of radical bullshit.

01:40:34.718 --> 01:40:38.600
Coming up with a product, just look at our adverse event reporting systems.

01:40:39.021 --> 01:40:40.722
They are so clunky, Joe.

01:40:41.062 --> 01:40:49.868
We have one for- So clunky, you mean like Jessica Rose said from the beginning of the pandemic, like EpiGirl was scripted to do in the sparse pandemic document?

01:40:50.635 --> 01:40:53.818
vaccines called VAERS, one for devices called MOD.

01:40:54.158 --> 01:40:57.521
We have VAERS and CARES and FAERS and Sentinel.

01:40:57.541 --> 01:41:02.986
We have 10 different adverse event reporting systems, all sort of independently developed.

01:41:03.066 --> 01:41:04.087
We're going to go to one.

01:41:04.447 --> 01:41:13.376
And so that way we can have a great user interface and a great database of adverse events that we can use for our post-market surveillance of drugs.

01:41:14.356 --> 01:41:18.159
Doctor, I also wanted to ask you about your quest to make the FDA more transparent.

01:41:18.179 --> 01:41:24.903
And part of that was yesterday releasing more than 200 rejection letters, as you had mentioned before, to the public.

01:41:24.943 --> 01:41:36.790
So the public can actually see why a drug was rejected, as opposed to getting a press release from the company, which may or may not give the full details or may have spin involved, et cetera.

01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:39.352
The letters were from 2020 to 2024.

01:41:41.613 --> 01:41:47.061
And investors, at least, are wondering if it's going to be more real time, because that's the only way it's really going to be useful.

01:41:48.817 --> 01:41:51.499
Let me be clear, Melissa, it's going to be real time.

01:41:51.539 --> 01:41:56.561
That was just the initial batch because we need time to do the human redaction of those letters.

01:41:57.042 --> 01:42:05.687
So I know some media outlets were hours after our announcement saying, oh, this is only part of the stack of all the letters.

01:42:06.387 --> 01:42:09.909
We have thousands of letters that we are redacting.

01:42:09.929 --> 01:42:11.130
We're going to make them public.

01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:21.521
drug developers and inventors are going to be able to go through them and see not just how the FDA thinks, but how one study section of the FDA thinks, the study section of interest.

01:42:22.022 --> 01:42:25.946
And we're going to be releasing them in real time as we make decisions.

01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:31.092
And that way, shareholders will be able to see exactly what the FDA said.

01:42:31.112 --> 01:42:32.454
Look, markets like

01:42:32.654 --> 01:42:34.535
I am trying to address your positions.

01:42:34.595 --> 01:42:36.417
I think your positions are bullshit.

01:42:36.577 --> 01:42:42.941
I don't think that prions transmit by using frequency, light, and sound, and coherence.

01:42:43.582 --> 01:42:51.587
They're not like out of tune chords, and you're really lost, and you're not gonna convince anybody here.

01:42:51.747 --> 01:42:55.150
In a moment, I'm just gonna unmute you in the chat because it's ridiculous.

01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:58.332
What you're saying is ridiculous.

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:00.614
What you say you can explain is ridiculous.

01:43:02.471 --> 01:43:10.294
You just got to stick to what you know and not to these ridiculous ideas for which there's no basis in reality, including prions.

01:43:10.375 --> 01:43:16.417
Prions have such a large set of textbooks because they are such a large mythology.

01:43:17.257 --> 01:43:23.360
When people eat other people's brains, it's not very surprising that they might occasionally get sick from it.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.921
But it's not a magic folding resonant protein.

01:43:26.961 --> 01:43:29.462
And if there was a magic folding resonant protein,

01:43:30.137 --> 01:43:32.439
then Google fold would have figured it out by now.

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.042
And just please, just stop clowning.

01:43:35.402 --> 01:43:36.223
It's so silly.

01:43:37.023 --> 01:43:37.864
Predictability.

01:43:38.164 --> 01:43:43.309
So I'm gonna transition to a video that I think is very interesting.

01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:47.793
It is from 2017 at the National Press Club.

01:43:49.035 --> 01:43:53.178
And it features a Paul Thomas.

01:43:54.241 --> 01:43:55.862
It features Del Bigtree.

01:43:55.942 --> 01:43:57.083
It features Brian Hooker.

01:43:57.103 --> 01:44:01.185
It features this lady right here, Judy Mickiewicz.

01:44:01.265 --> 01:44:03.086
And it features this lady right here.

01:44:03.526 --> 01:44:05.828
I can't remember who that lady is.

01:44:05.868 --> 01:44:06.988
She's got like gray hair.

01:44:07.008 --> 01:44:07.789
She's kind of pretty.

01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:16.474
But first I'm going to do a brief respite in the form of music.

01:44:19.055 --> 01:44:19.896
Just a short one.

01:44:20.176 --> 01:44:21.257
Thank you very much for being here.

01:44:21.277 --> 01:44:21.717
I'll see you soon.

01:45:58.387 --> 01:45:59.392
I can't sleep all day

01:46:56.789 --> 01:46:59.997
surrounding castles and skies

01:48:03.145 --> 01:48:05.108
taught with how to create the coronavirus.

01:48:05.668 --> 01:48:06.109
Taught who?

01:48:06.829 --> 01:48:08.031
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:48:08.251 --> 01:48:08.371
Oh.

01:48:08.571 --> 01:48:17.220
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of echo health into the wave because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:25.389
Obama did that and so what Fauci's creative way around that was we'll fund a non-profit called Echo Health Alliance run by Peter Daszak

01:48:25.809 --> 01:48:29.271
who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:48:29.311 --> 01:48:32.753
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan, it's going through some intermediary.

01:48:33.633 --> 01:48:43.519
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes.

01:48:46.561 --> 01:48:50.643
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

01:48:51.863 --> 01:48:56.546
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it necessarily from the laboratory.

01:48:57.386 --> 01:49:00.188
However, they did- That's called golden gate assembly, not no-see-um.

01:49:02.009 --> 01:49:03.510
That got them caught, basically.

01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:07.572
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

01:49:07.672 --> 01:49:11.114
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

01:49:11.794 --> 01:49:18.078
And Charles Rixey's a Marine, and he's been a dog on a bone with this problem.

01:49:18.458 --> 01:49:21.080
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

01:49:23.621 --> 01:49:31.826
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DoD to go build- I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:49:32.286 --> 01:49:36.549
Under the banner of we need to build a vaccine against this, because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

01:49:37.089 --> 01:49:39.912
And the DoD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

01:49:40.993 --> 01:49:43.495
You'll have something to leak from this.

01:49:43.896 --> 01:49:47.700
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.362
We got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

01:49:50.743 --> 01:49:53.205
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

01:49:53.725 --> 01:49:55.627
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

01:49:55.687 --> 01:49:55.868
Because...

01:49:59.514 --> 01:50:02.577
I am very happy to be here in the second half of the show.

01:50:02.617 --> 01:50:03.578
It's a long one today.

01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:09.164
They are scripted bullshitters all on Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone's bullshit script.

01:50:10.085 --> 01:50:13.950
I'm going to briefly escape from here and restart the slide deck one more time.

01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:15.571
There were a lot of videos in that section.

01:50:16.434 --> 01:50:19.797
And so sometimes it gets a little heavy on the memory.

01:50:21.139 --> 01:50:21.979
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:28.005
Insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than the vaccine.

01:50:28.145 --> 01:50:29.347
These people are trash.

01:50:30.928 --> 01:50:33.090
I don't know what to say anything other than that.

01:50:33.651 --> 01:50:35.072
This man is a fraud.

01:50:35.112 --> 01:50:36.634
That woman is a fraud.

01:50:36.674 --> 01:50:39.436
They're both just, they're clowns.

01:50:40.602 --> 01:50:42.803
Best case scenario, they're scripted idiots.

01:50:43.443 --> 01:50:56.947
Worst case scenario, Brett's been lying to his wife about where he gets all of his ideas, and she believes, but he is a scripted jackass, traitor to our grandkids, scripted by his brother and his dad.

01:50:57.627 --> 01:51:05.130
So I'm making the claim that Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn were killed and replaced by Judy Mikovits, Paul Thomas, Brian and Mary.

01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:06.110
Why did that fade away?

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:32.964
shit hold on one second escape and that text box why are you i'm just gonna remove that i don't know why that's there all right i don't know why that faded i think tony bark and brandy vaughn were killed and replaced with judy mckovitt's paul thomas brian hooker mary holland and robert f kennedy jr and i think that this video will actually kind of convince you um i might i might just watch the beginning and

01:51:33.664 --> 01:51:42.230
and then switch to full screen with it a little bit faster because it's like two hours and I don't want... I'm already here for two hours.

01:51:42.390 --> 01:52:02.485
I might have to just start the stream over again tomorrow and only watch the beginning of this right now and just slam the first speaker knowing full well that there are several other winners to come before they will put our friend Tony Bark on stage or in front of the podium.

01:52:14.243 --> 01:52:28.009
Look at the calendar behind the video ladies and gentlemen We are a long time from this video a long time one year to the day after the release of Vaxxed the movie in 2017 is April 1st

01:52:31.716 --> 01:52:34.057
Or very close to April 1st, let's say it like that.

01:52:34.758 --> 01:52:43.322
ICANN was established on April 1st, 2016 on the same day that Vaxxed was released on April 1st, 2016.

01:52:45.183 --> 01:52:52.306
In the front row there, you see Judy Mikovits and you see her sitting next to Tony Bark.

01:52:52.987 --> 01:52:53.347
Oh yeah.

01:52:54.187 --> 01:52:54.707
What did I do?

01:52:54.848 --> 01:52:55.508
Oh, I did that.

01:52:55.688 --> 01:52:56.168
Oh, sorry.

01:52:56.228 --> 01:52:56.688
I did this.

01:52:56.789 --> 01:52:57.109
Great.

01:52:57.449 --> 01:52:58.589
So we already have it here.

01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.530
Awesome.

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:02.682
This should be the start.

01:53:13.148 --> 01:53:15.430
Actually, I'm going to make myself a little bit bigger.

01:53:15.490 --> 01:53:15.830
Check.

01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:17.691
Check for one second.

01:53:18.011 --> 01:53:24.455
A. That's A. I want to be B. There we go.

01:53:24.536 --> 01:53:25.076
That's better.

01:53:25.576 --> 01:53:25.916
Okay.

01:53:29.212 --> 01:53:30.133
Good morning, everyone.

01:53:30.953 --> 01:53:36.778
Thank you for joining us today for Doctors for Accountability in Medicine and Media.

01:53:37.178 --> 01:53:41.362
Doctors for Accountability in Medicine and Media.

01:53:41.442 --> 01:53:43.523
I guess that's the title of this meeting.

01:53:44.304 --> 01:53:44.724
Hmm.

01:53:45.305 --> 01:53:45.725
Interesting.

01:53:49.577 --> 01:53:51.238
My name is Del Bigtree.

01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:59.345
My background, I was a producer on the Emmy Award winning television show, The Doctors.

01:53:59.745 --> 01:54:02.388
Is anybody struck by how low energy this is?

01:54:03.188 --> 01:54:03.989
Holy shit.

01:54:06.044 --> 01:54:07.586
Must have had Indica beforehand.

01:54:08.848 --> 01:54:19.243
For six years, I spent my career celebrating the best that medicine has to offer, the best science, the best doctors, cutting edge techniques, new surgeries.

01:54:20.004 --> 01:54:23.048
I'm a fan of great doctors and great medicine.

01:54:24.393 --> 01:54:25.754
while working on that show.

01:54:25.974 --> 01:54:29.315
This is somebody walking very carefully here.

01:54:29.795 --> 01:54:50.361
And you can imagine that if Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark are alive and you're trying to orchestrate a replacement exercise, stepping in front of them to create a false health freedom movement, a false anti-vax movement that stands in front of those real activists,

01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:57.334
then you're gonna have to be very careful, especially if the movie's been out for a year and they're onto you.

01:55:01.617 --> 01:55:04.379
Tony Bark is not in the first vaxxed movie.

01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:10.783
Produced by Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy and Brian Hooker, right?

01:55:10.843 --> 01:55:11.224
Remember.

01:55:11.604 --> 01:55:14.126
Stumbled upon the story of Dr. William Thompson.

01:55:15.090 --> 01:55:17.333
the whistleblower from the Centers for Disease Control.

01:55:17.393 --> 01:55:32.650
The whistleblower from the Centers for Disease Control, the story that supposedly Brian broke, the story that black kids and most importantly black boys are most injured by the vaccine schedule or the MMR or something like that, and the CDC hid the data.

01:55:33.871 --> 01:55:41.398
And so one possible near future event will be that in September or October, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:41.438 --> 01:55:48.664
will reveal that this is the real data, that William Thompson is really that guy, that Brian Hooker is really that guy.

01:55:48.724 --> 01:55:50.366
And this is what they really found.

01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:59.254
And it is a racist vaccine schedule, which could fracture the American public if used correctly on social media.

01:56:00.663 --> 01:56:03.885
I don't know that that's gonna happen, but that is a distinct possibility.

01:56:04.805 --> 01:56:10.669
The foundation mythology of which was laid down already a decade ago.

01:56:13.971 --> 01:56:15.732
Just trying to show you what you're seeing here.

01:56:16.252 --> 01:56:21.715
One prevention that came forward in the fall of 2014 to let us know that the CDC had been corrupted.

01:56:21.735 --> 01:56:23.296
2014, it is actually 11 years ago right now, you see?

01:56:30.546 --> 01:56:32.647
It's been a long con, ladies and gentlemen.

01:56:33.648 --> 01:56:46.014
And that they were committing scientific fraud on their vaccine studies, specifically the MMR vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and its causal relationship to autism.

01:56:46.735 --> 01:56:50.937
I made a movie about that, produced it, called Vaxxed.

01:56:51.817 --> 01:56:56.940
Actually, tomorrow will be the one year anniversary of the first premiere of Vaxxed.

01:57:02.375 --> 01:57:09.922
So he, like Andrew Wakefield, supposedly risked his mainstream career to speak out about this shit.

01:57:10.022 --> 01:57:15.227
So he used to be on ABC and is really a mainstream loves medicine thing.

01:57:15.808 --> 01:57:19.891
But, you know, I decided to give it all up because why?

01:57:21.833 --> 01:57:23.415
That began a journey for me.

01:57:24.381 --> 01:57:27.262
as I think many of the people you're about to hear from today.

01:57:27.762 --> 01:57:29.783
What do you mean the movie began a journey?

01:57:29.803 --> 01:57:33.043
You mean you didn't even start the journey before the movie?

01:57:33.063 --> 01:57:34.844
That's a weird thing that he said there.

01:57:34.884 --> 01:57:38.705
It's almost like somebody asked him to make a movie about something he didn't understand.

01:57:38.725 --> 01:57:40.706
I might need to replay that part.

01:57:41.286 --> 01:57:48.908
That takes you out of what you believe was the foundation and truth in science and specifically to vaccine research and testing.

01:57:50.565 --> 01:58:00.099
Once you start asking the appropriate questions about the vaccine program in this nation and the one that really is promoted all around the world.

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.262
What are the appropriate questions?

01:58:02.302 --> 01:58:03.685
Do you think he's going to list those?

01:58:03.705 --> 01:58:05.167
I bet he's not.

01:58:06.434 --> 01:58:13.839
I bet he might indirectly imply that it's lack of placebo testing or the particular adjuvant that nobody cares about.

01:58:13.879 --> 01:58:24.146
You see, there's no, and this is in 2017, they actually say the same things now a decade later.

01:58:24.806 --> 01:58:29.769
They might even say it with less specificity depending on what he says in the next five or 10 minutes.

01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:34.813
You begin a journey that takes you to some very scary realities.

01:58:36.849 --> 01:58:46.336
These people here today represent some of the people that I've studied and investigated and interviewed for some of my research and the work that I'm doing.

01:58:46.917 --> 01:59:04.931
They only represent a handful of the many, many doctors across this nation and the world that are standing up now and asking for real accountability in vaccine safety, research, testing, and the promotion of future vaccines and those we're using on our children.

01:59:05.657 --> 01:59:14.546
I'm going to let them do the talking today because we live in a nation right now that wants to say the science is settled around vaccines.

01:59:15.446 --> 01:59:17.188
What that means is we're done.

01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:23.855
We're saying that we accept a vaccine program that this year will murder children.

01:59:24.537 --> 01:59:25.358
That's a fact.

01:59:25.538 --> 01:59:39.329
There will be Children who will lose their lives this year to the vaccine program that would have had an otherwise totally normal life could have gone on to become president of the United States or a future scientist with some great new breakthrough.

01:59:39.889 --> 01:59:42.832
They will not be here because of this vaccine program.

01:59:43.412 --> 01:59:47.155
Other Children will suffer paralysis.

01:59:47.835 --> 01:59:50.738
Some will have their brains damaged permanently for life.

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:56.464
And recently I've been asking this question of some fairly high up officials.

01:59:57.224 --> 02:00:00.827
And what I say is, how is that where we're settled?

02:00:01.148 --> 02:00:05.471
And they say, well, science has determined that that's an acceptable casualty.

02:00:06.012 --> 02:00:11.656
We have an accepted casualty in order to reach herd immunity in the United States of America.

02:00:12.096 --> 02:00:13.177
So there is the narrative.

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:25.786
that it is a careful weighing of the risks and benefits across society that determines that vaccines work and the trade-offs are worth it.

02:00:26.567 --> 02:00:28.588
He's not questioning anything.

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:34.152
If he believes that kids are killed, I don't hear him saying that now.

02:00:34.612 --> 02:00:38.115
If he believes that kids are being damaged, I don't hear him saying that now.

02:00:38.195 --> 02:00:40.136
I hear him saying that it causes autism.

02:00:42.844 --> 02:00:48.225
that, you know, he just said it like five minutes ago, that a certain part of the MMR causes autism.

02:00:49.686 --> 02:00:51.686
But now he's saying that kids will die.

02:00:53.227 --> 02:01:01.869
Is he talking about SIDS that we just, you know, blew the lid off of with Pierre Corey and Steve Kirsch this year?

02:01:02.409 --> 02:01:05.730
That CHD is supposedly blowing the lid off of this year?

02:01:06.190 --> 02:01:11.412
When in 2017, he already knew that kids were getting killed from the vaccines.

02:01:12.315 --> 02:01:27.758
that they were an acceptable casualty to reach the hypothetical concept of herd immunity, which make no mistake about it, it wasn't accidentally brought out again as a center part of the debate in COVID by accident.

02:01:29.058 --> 02:01:30.418
These people are on a script.

02:01:35.139 --> 02:01:37.559
I mean, this guy was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:01:37.539 --> 02:01:41.020
's campaign manager along with Tony Lyons, ladies and gentlemen.

02:01:42.079 --> 02:01:43.359
That's not by accident.

02:01:43.459 --> 02:01:55.361
I follow that question with my or that statement with my own question, which is, please tell me how many children exactly are going to die this year from our vaccine program.

02:01:56.101 --> 02:02:03.443
Could you please tell me exactly how many children's minds will be ruined for their lives or be paralyzed?

02:02:04.643 --> 02:02:10.364
And the answer you get from the mainstream medical community is we don't have the data on that.

02:02:11.041 --> 02:02:12.082
You understand, right?

02:02:12.122 --> 02:02:18.326
They are now talking exclusively about autism and about how we're going to have the cause of autism.

02:02:18.827 --> 02:02:23.590
But in 2017, he was saying that people died, they get paralyzed.

02:02:24.391 --> 02:02:29.054
You see, he was talking like Brian Hooker kind of was.

02:02:29.094 --> 02:02:34.618
We don't need to use the word autism if these people are just getting injured by intramuscular injection.

02:02:35.896 --> 02:02:37.720
But even Brian Hooker couldn't quite say it.

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:39.624
He still had to use the word vaccine.

02:02:39.684 --> 02:02:43.353
He still uses the word safe vaccines and vaccine safety.

02:02:44.844 --> 02:02:46.645
Because he is a scripted traitor.

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:51.248
Even in 2017, he was a scripted traitor.

02:02:51.788 --> 02:02:56.491
Frickin' Paulie Tommy and Andrew Wakefield were scripted traitors when they came to America.

02:02:57.271 --> 02:03:01.354
So of course they were scripted traitors when they made the movie Vaxxed.

02:03:01.854 --> 02:03:04.035
And of course this guy is a scripted traitor.

02:03:04.596 --> 02:03:06.597
If he was on the campaign for

02:03:07.237 --> 02:03:09.999
President for for Robert F. Kennedy jr.

02:03:10.119 --> 02:03:28.329
None of these people ever had any inkling of an idea that they were gonna save kids They were gonna get somebody elected president So, how do we have an acceptable casualty if we don't know what number we're accepting I Think that's the beginning of the first question.

02:03:28.469 --> 02:03:30.430
Anybody should be asking right now.

02:03:31.210 --> 02:03:32.511
So when we live in a nation

02:03:33.083 --> 02:03:34.544
that says that vaccines are safe.

02:03:34.624 --> 02:03:41.327
I think it's a more relevant question to ask, where did we ever get the idea that intramuscular injection was a good way to administer medicine?

02:03:43.288 --> 02:03:48.330
And that question has been asked and answered in earnest by my friend Mark Kulak.

02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:55.513
It apparently just came from morphine application during combat wounds and veterinary science.

02:03:58.435 --> 02:03:59.055
It's fucked up.

02:03:59.916 --> 02:04:00.756
If ineffective.

02:04:01.411 --> 02:04:04.312
which actually flies in the face of the highest court in the land.

02:04:04.352 --> 02:04:11.294
And of course, he's already saying safe and effective, which is the literal mandate of the FDA.

02:04:11.374 --> 02:04:22.858
So already back in 2017, you can hear the challenge, the undermining, the irrelevance of the FDA being implanted in people's heads in this fake health freedom movement.

02:04:23.178 --> 02:04:28.239
And right here in this town, the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2011, made the official statement

02:04:30.359 --> 02:04:33.742
vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

02:04:34.683 --> 02:04:45.753
I would like to know how the medical community stands in direct opposition to that statement made by the highest court in the land and repeats constantly vaccines are safe and effective.

02:04:46.274 --> 02:04:47.375
That duality

02:04:48.288 --> 02:04:48.828
inside.

02:04:49.089 --> 02:04:52.831
It is not by accident that he's saying safe and effective over and over again.

02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:56.794
It's not by accident that Tony Fauci said it at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:04:56.834 --> 02:05:06.060
It's not by accident that Kevin McKernan was going on podcasts including a guy who used to work for the World Bank to say that the FDA was in the way.

02:05:07.581 --> 02:05:10.142
It's not by accident that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

02:05:10.102 --> 02:05:10.703
's dad

02:05:11.465 --> 02:05:12.866
helped establish the FDA.

02:05:12.946 --> 02:05:19.271
It's not by accident that Brett Weinstein's dad, alive still, helped establish the modern FDA.

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:20.792
It's not by accident.

02:05:23.674 --> 02:05:34.002
This nation, between our medical establishment and the highest court in the land, should be the beginning of a question that allows us to have true conversation

02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:36.310
Open conversation.

02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:56.361
It's funny that you say that entropy writer because after we get through all the other shitheads and they finally let Tony bark talk one of the first things that she brings up is the d-tap shot about the science of vaccines if We cannot question science That it is no longer science.

02:05:57.381 --> 02:05:58.382
It has become a religion

02:05:59.673 --> 02:06:02.255
And much of the way this- And we're here right now, right?

02:06:02.295 --> 02:06:05.358
A decade later, people are still talking about it like a religion.

02:06:05.498 --> 02:06:06.238
It's just dumb.

02:06:07.079 --> 02:06:08.260
It's just a dumb idea.

02:06:09.961 --> 02:06:15.906
It's a dumb idea that it looks like maybe this Rockefeller music medicine movement maybe fueled it.

02:06:16.006 --> 02:06:16.406
I don't know.

02:06:16.807 --> 02:06:18.908
But it's a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

02:06:19.929 --> 02:06:21.190
Situation is addressed.

02:06:21.250 --> 02:06:22.151
This medicine is addressed.

02:06:22.171 --> 02:06:22.812
My dog is barking.

02:06:22.912 --> 02:06:24.833
This vaccine program is addressed.

02:06:24.853 --> 02:06:26.014
It is like a religion.

02:06:26.835 --> 02:06:29.417
If you question it, you are a heretic.

02:06:31.010 --> 02:06:38.035
If you question why there's a duality between the Supreme Court and the medical establishment, you're a heretic.

02:06:40.156 --> 02:06:42.558
We are the greatest nation in the world.

02:06:43.178 --> 02:06:45.200
We have the greatest scientists in the world.

02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:51.564
And I don't believe we should say the science is settled when lives will be destroyed by a program.

02:06:51.844 --> 02:06:53.465
We can do better.

02:06:54.206 --> 02:06:55.847
We must do better.

02:06:57.048 --> 02:07:22.214
And for any scientist that wants to say they have settled at a place where innocent children's lives will be destroyed, I say, please, step out of the way and let the future scientists come in and figure out a way to create immunity in our children, health in our children, that is safe and effective for every single child in this nation and around the world.

02:07:22.874 --> 02:07:25.155
And until we have achieved that,

02:07:26.616 --> 02:07:41.979
We must never, ever say we have settled, or we are no longer the greatest nation in the world, we are no longer the greatest scientists in the world, and we no longer have the greatest medical practice and institutions in the world.

02:07:42.819 --> 02:07:54.642
I think we stand here in the United States of America as a great nation, and these people that are gonna speak today are going to move us into the direction that we need to go

02:07:55.492 --> 02:08:04.862
which is open dialogue, scientific research, and getting back to the principles of true safety medical testing.

02:08:05.422 --> 02:08:06.543
All right, there it is.

02:08:07.495 --> 02:08:15.641
So you can see they were on a script already in 2017 and they were very carefully trying to displace Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

02:08:16.082 --> 02:08:18.764
We will watch the entirety of this video tomorrow.

02:08:18.804 --> 02:08:20.465
It's way too late for me to keep this going.

02:08:21.306 --> 02:08:22.747
Um, I'm just going to sign off.

02:08:22.827 --> 02:08:24.428
It's been two hours and seven minutes.

02:08:24.488 --> 02:08:35.036
Remember there's an irreducibly complex background with a very simple bullshit PCR test timed well with this anticipated rise in all cause mortality sculpted using

02:08:36.724 --> 02:08:39.666
A little manslaughter and lies, that's how we got here.

02:08:40.826 --> 02:08:42.147
Boy am I hungry, it's crazy.

02:08:43.528 --> 02:08:58.996
Again, you can see these people are fake because they don't bring up the population pyramid, they don't bring up this anticipated rise, and they don't try to list and assemble a list of the ways that this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality could have been sculpted

02:09:00.056 --> 02:09:14.743
with manslaughter and myths and lies and confusion about supplementary oxygen and antibiotics appropriateness and also remdesivir, midazolam and ventilators and DNR orders and all that stuff.

02:09:14.843 --> 02:09:28.310
All of it combined together means that there was no mystery virus that was very strange that Mary Holland had natural immunity to or that Mike Yeadon had natural immunity to.

02:09:30.157 --> 02:09:52.026
Endemicity is a myth that Mike Eden is apparently not sophisticated enough to question as a respiratory physiologist, former employee of Pfizer, that Sasha Latupova, who says it was the DOD who did it to us, is not sophisticated enough to get to the point where she could say that endemicity is a myth, both as a process and as an endpoint, because she's not there.

02:09:52.086 --> 02:09:58.469
She's employed to post on Substack comments, bullshit statements, and half-truths.

02:09:59.309 --> 02:10:06.778
That's why the same pharmaceutical employees, retired people can't get to the point where they can tell you that placebo would have made it stupid easy.

02:10:07.239 --> 02:10:10.002
And it would have got rid of all those problematic side effects.

02:10:10.462 --> 02:10:14.848
That's why they also can't explain to you that using their test to find their ghost don't make the ghost real.

02:10:16.479 --> 02:10:18.460
That's why they've never gotten there, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.941
They are on a shitty script from Robert Malone.

02:10:20.981 --> 02:10:24.042
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America and around the world.

02:10:24.102 --> 02:10:25.983
If you want to wake up, that's where you got to start.

02:10:26.523 --> 02:10:27.463
You can start right here.

02:10:27.523 --> 02:10:30.985
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

02:10:31.905 --> 02:10:36.987
And autism spectrum disorder and pandemics and gain of function are mythologies used to hide that.

02:10:37.847 --> 02:10:38.548
I love you very much.

02:10:38.568 --> 02:10:39.128
See you tomorrow.
