WEBVTT

00:23.221 --> 00:28.104
Oh, once upon a midnight dreary I woke with something in my head

00:48.362 --> 00:53.465
I couldn't escape the memory of a phone call and of what you said.

00:53.645 --> 00:59.608
You're like a game show contestant with a parting gift that could not but leave my eyes.

00:59.688 --> 01:06.051
When I saw it through the buds of a trusted friend who needs to humor me and tell me lies.

01:06.612 --> 01:09.293
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies.

01:10.173 --> 01:12.915
And I'll lie to you and say I don't mind.

01:13.195 --> 01:16.057
And as we sit so shall we find.

01:35.353 --> 01:35.834
it's so low

01:48.125 --> 02:09.083
But I crave many things But I've been there, I can see it A coward like a nervous magician waiting in the wings Of a bad play where the heroes are right Nobody thinks or expects too much Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing, hey babe, let's keep in touch

02:09.844 --> 02:12.625
Hey, baby, let's keep in touch.

02:13.066 --> 02:19.289
For our moment of touch, I want you to reach me and show me all the things no one else can see.

02:40.773 --> 02:43.030
When all I got's this

03:10.149 --> 03:34.616
And I've got some news for you It's in my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can get I'm sure the battery's torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress proves I should drink it and always be poor Yeah, I will drink it and always be poor

03:42.551 --> 03:45.152
I got this dream that you just can't shake.

03:45.252 --> 03:47.513
I love you to the point you can't no longer take.

03:47.573 --> 03:48.633
Well, all right.

03:49.654 --> 03:51.094
OK, so be that way.

03:51.394 --> 03:54.215
I hope and pray that there's something that you say.

03:54.315 --> 03:55.516
But yeah.

03:55.536 --> 03:59.837
Why do you want to give me a run around?

04:00.437 --> 04:06.460
Is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down?

04:14.682 --> 04:18.793
I rarely beat things up when all I've got is the love

04:53.848 --> 04:55.449
You know who the best player in the game is?

04:56.010 --> 04:57.311
Me, Mars Blackman.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.014
And I'm way above the rim, demonstrating some serious hang time.

05:01.394 --> 05:02.215
Very serious.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.076
Do you know how I get up for my game?

05:04.496 --> 05:04.917
Do you know?

05:04.977 --> 05:05.337
Do you know?

05:05.377 --> 05:05.798
Do you know?

05:06.178 --> 05:06.718
That's right.

05:06.978 --> 05:09.080
Air Jordan, Air Jordan, Air Jordan.

05:10.281 --> 05:11.462
Mike, what's up?

05:13.644 --> 05:14.865
Oh, money, money.

05:14.885 --> 05:15.886
Why you wanna do that to me?

05:15.906 --> 05:16.746
Why you leave me hanging?

05:17.487 --> 05:17.807
Come on.

05:18.388 --> 05:18.728
I got it.

05:32.581 --> 05:41.028
one of our hits here in a second.

05:41.949 --> 05:43.691
Here we go.

05:43.731 --> 05:44.031
Set.

05:44.131 --> 05:45.933
No waves, no beats.

06:34.818 --> 06:35.678
an an an

07:09.445 --> 07:09.645
so so

08:01.761 --> 08:03.341
I think truth is good for kids.

08:03.741 --> 08:07.583
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

08:08.043 --> 08:09.663
We want everybody to feel good.

08:09.683 --> 08:11.784
That's not the way life is.

08:14.654 --> 08:18.456
you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

08:20.257 --> 08:20.957
And I have lied.

08:20.977 --> 08:22.018
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:22.038 --> 08:22.978
I don't want to lie.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.819
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

08:24.919 --> 08:25.960
I try not to be a liar.

08:25.980 --> 08:26.820
I don't want to be a liar.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.102
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

08:33.936 --> 08:52.490
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

08:53.611 --> 09:02.058
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

09:05.728 --> 09:24.254
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

09:24.554 --> 09:28.635
It's just a big hassle in the end, but no one,

09:29.636 --> 09:37.064
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality.

09:37.365 --> 09:42.671
It's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of this flu.

09:42.751 --> 09:45.414
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

09:47.443 --> 09:51.585
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

09:51.925 --> 09:56.206
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

09:56.526 --> 10:00.788
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

10:00.968 --> 10:07.231
I'm afraid that the latest data... Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

10:07.711 --> 10:09.471
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

10:11.492 --> 10:11.772
Isolation?

10:11.792 --> 10:12.112
What was it?

10:12.132 --> 10:13.573
Isolation and purification.

10:15.374 --> 10:16.054
Of the virus?

10:16.174 --> 10:16.314
Yes.

10:17.622 --> 10:28.665
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

10:29.325 --> 10:34.206
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

10:34.986 --> 10:37.027
I don't understand what the issue.

10:37.127 --> 10:42.568
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

10:43.669 --> 10:44.809
No, it depends on how they used it.

10:46.365 --> 10:49.149
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.615
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

10:53.675 --> 10:55.517
I mean, he actually isolated it.

10:55.878 --> 10:59.723
I mean, why should I do all of this?

10:59.783 --> 11:01.806
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

11:07.196 --> 11:07.797
so so

11:36.736 --> 11:37.358
you

16:07.941 --> 16:14.347
So I've been talking about truth for a while now and what this wave of consensus means for us.

16:15.728 --> 16:23.535
And part of the difficulty of getting the truth out there is that social media is not behaving like we all imagine it does.

16:24.916 --> 16:35.385
And there have been several times when I have been near where I am now and was misled and misdirected and lost another half a year of my life.

16:36.525 --> 16:37.746
asking the wrong questions.

16:37.966 --> 16:44.910
And so it might be simple to say that, why don't you just tell us what biology we should stay focused on?

16:44.930 --> 16:47.111
Why don't you just tell us what their bait looks like?

16:47.171 --> 16:49.772
And why don't you just teach us how to love our neighbor?

16:49.812 --> 16:52.554
But teaching you how to love your neighbor, that's not my thing.

16:53.814 --> 17:03.840
I didn't even recognize their bait on social media until probably this year when I realized the extent to which these people were coordinating their lies.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.922
and that they were sharing with each other about me.

17:07.802 --> 17:12.645
And so staying focused on the biology has been the only thing that's ever saved me from these people.

17:13.326 --> 17:24.073
And every time I wander away and start to trust one of them, inevitably I lose some time and I lose some ground because I get caught up in this wave of consensus.

17:24.893 --> 17:26.374
And so I'm an American.

17:26.514 --> 17:27.755
I'm fighting for America.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.236
My loyalty is to America.

17:29.296 --> 17:33.519
It's not to a candidate or to an office or to some other nonsense.

17:33.860 --> 17:38.343
It's to the dirt and to the future that I think my kids still have here.

17:40.970 --> 17:42.972
And I think we have to stay focused on the biology.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.874
We can't take their bait on social media.

17:44.894 --> 17:46.536
We've got to learn to love our neighbors again.

17:46.596 --> 17:48.118
We've got to get acquainted with them again.

17:48.138 --> 17:51.861
And we need to spread the word of this each week.

17:52.042 --> 17:57.407
We need to spread the word of the biology that we've come to understand and they have come to ignore.

17:59.048 --> 18:12.751
It is a biology that has to do with irreducible complexity and being a little bit honest about our lack of understanding instead of exaggerating it and stop the lies.

18:13.431 --> 18:24.994
Stop the lies about all these things we know about and all these phenomenon that we understand and start to just see science and biology and medicine as something that is all

18:26.980 --> 18:51.162
a gift given to us as part of creation and as part of the world around us that we can hope to understand little pieces of, but until we have a shift in our understanding and we start to understand nature as something that we are a part of, an integral part of, rather than some lord of or manipulator of or demigod over,

18:52.243 --> 18:53.203
We're not going to escape.

18:53.263 --> 19:10.348
And if you keep your phone up to your face, you're going to see more and more people telling you that we are the lords of creation, and we are the lords of nature, and we run stuff, and we know how stuff works, and we can make it work better, and all of this stuff is absolute nonsense.

19:11.048 --> 19:20.191
But if you want to engage in United Noncompliance, you need to understand how this illusion is created, how this illusion is sustained.

19:21.304 --> 19:23.865
And we're going to have to break teachers out of it.

19:23.905 --> 19:25.806
We're going to have to break doctors out of it.

19:25.846 --> 19:34.169
We're going to have to break faculty members out of this illusion, or we're going to lose our country pretty fast here, ladies and gentlemen.

19:35.129 --> 19:37.150
This is gigaohm biological.

19:40.914 --> 19:41.535
do do

20:07.533 --> 20:09.155
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.280
It is 253 here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.782
I'm coming to you live from my garage.

20:13.822 --> 20:16.626
My name is Jonathan Cooey, and this is GigaOM Biological.

20:17.387 --> 20:22.274
GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by me.

20:23.792 --> 20:31.959
It's been a little while since I've been on and I don't have any good excuses for it other than I've been doing other things in the background.

20:32.600 --> 20:40.968
Soon my family will go on a very brief trip to the Netherlands and so I'm spending the last couple days with them before they take off for grandma's house.

20:42.689 --> 20:46.470
And so that coupled with some other things has kept me offline.

20:46.890 --> 20:51.072
But I assure you, the ball has not stopped rolling down the hill.

20:51.952 --> 20:55.674
The reaction to my latest sub stack has

20:56.809 --> 20:58.170
has been kind of crickets.

20:59.651 --> 21:03.554
Of course, some of you have been there posting nice comments, and I really appreciate that.

21:03.594 --> 21:11.579
But I was really hoping that one or more molecular biologists would come there and cross things out or highlight things that don't make sense.

21:11.659 --> 21:12.880
Or what's he talking about here?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.721
And I understand it's not perfectly written.

21:15.321 --> 21:16.902
Of course, it's as fast as I can write on

21:19.404 --> 21:28.053
on a document to try and bring people into an understanding of where I was and what argument I wanted to make so that we could write a succinct substack about it.

21:28.114 --> 21:37.163
Unfortunately, those people didn't help me do that and instead wrote their own substack and I, through that action and a few other mistakes made by them,

21:38.564 --> 21:46.567
It's come to my understanding, at least as best as I can tell, that a lot of these people were wasting my time for more than six months of this year.

21:46.707 --> 21:49.428
So there's just a lot of this stuff going on.

21:49.989 --> 21:56.711
I've just recently had an interview about a month and a half ago, I think on the 19th or 18th of May.

21:59.452 --> 22:15.076
with a guy by the name of Gabe Mason in Canada and he said it would be a few weeks before he put out the podcast but unfortunately I don't see anything and I knew I wouldn't see anything and that's why I did this little sub stack about him.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.917
Just a few talking points or a few slogans for you here.

22:20.597 --> 22:25.638
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

22:26.238 --> 22:30.680
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

22:31.200 --> 22:47.686
The top one there should have enough useful combinations of English words that if you understand their sort of definition and combine them in the logical way dictated by the rules of English grammar, that's a pretty bold statement that shouldn't need a lot of backing.

22:47.726 --> 22:51.888
It should just inspire a great number of questions in you.

22:52.828 --> 22:59.430
And if it doesn't inspire a great number of questions in you, then I don't think you've been accurately paying attention.

22:59.470 --> 23:06.492
Because the whole point is to inspire questions in the people that read these statements.

23:06.612 --> 23:09.913
Because we want to inspire doctors and

23:10.813 --> 23:20.718
academicians, otherwise known as faculty members of medical schools, to start to reconsider what they think they know about the immune system and what they think they know about vaccination.

23:21.198 --> 23:26.820
And most importantly, what they think they know about the legal structure of the vaccination schedule in America.

23:28.501 --> 23:36.285
Because if we don't bring these people step-by-step to understand the malevolence of the system, they're never gonna wake up from their slumber.

23:38.066 --> 23:50.051
where they are still protected by an illusion of consensus all around them, where half of these children are wearing masks and where everybody agrees that, you know, the rainbow flag and all that stuff.

23:51.712 --> 23:56.114
We are at a crucial turning point in our civilization.

23:57.514 --> 24:06.138
And the only way we're gonna get a hold of the controls of this cruise ship and maybe change the direction by a few degrees in this year

24:07.307 --> 24:11.350
is going to be to wake people up using statements like this, where they're like, wait, what?

24:12.851 --> 24:15.634
And it ends up to be a ladder where they just climb right out.

24:18.216 --> 24:24.661
Now, RNA cannot pandemic is backed by some of the things that I've outlined in that latest sub stack.

24:24.761 --> 24:35.409
And I'm not covering that latest sub stack yet, because it's important for me that people have enough time to go and say, well, I'm going to look at some of these papers that he's cited here and see what they really say.

24:37.045 --> 24:47.228
and maybe come to the same conclusions that I have in a better way or in a more clear way or even a more profound way and express it on your own sub stack or express it on your own tweet.

24:48.688 --> 24:52.209
It's all right there laid out, even some of it's bolded.

24:53.789 --> 24:59.671
And yet somehow or another, nobody's really been able to get the ball over the finish line by themselves.

25:00.851 --> 25:03.312
And it's really unfortunate because that's where we are.

25:04.778 --> 25:13.344
I had 50 comments in the first two or three hours of the substack where I released the email from Miss Hockett.

25:14.584 --> 25:34.197
But on this substack where I release a working document that was working between me and Jonathan Engler, the co-chair of HART in the UK, as well as his friend and colleague from Panda and HART, I guess, Martin Neal, and Nick Hudson,

25:35.700 --> 25:36.640
and Jessica Hockett.

25:38.722 --> 25:49.627
And all of those people promoted their virology review, which is kind of a convoluted mix of Peter Hotez and Vincent Racaniello.

25:52.408 --> 26:01.993
And then dared behind the scenes to scold me for not sharing it after a couple weeks of me saying, dude, this is not the review the world needs.

26:04.383 --> 26:06.664
I got tricked into doing that review on my bicycle.

26:07.684 --> 26:19.870
And so we are, I am, I am subject to wasting my time arguing with people that nobody listens to and have no intention of spreading my information anywhere.

26:22.891 --> 26:24.292
One example would be this dude.

26:25.372 --> 26:26.653
You can find him on YouTube.

26:27.585 --> 26:33.369
You can find this thing, or he's done like 90 programs already, but he was gonna do some other new thing.

26:33.729 --> 26:35.730
And this was on the 19th of May.

26:36.210 --> 26:44.416
And this is just a email that I released of him the day after I recorded with him, because I asked him, you know, you think I could put out a transcript of this?

26:44.516 --> 26:49.439
Because I'd really like to get this information out in the way that I expressed in this video.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.600
I'd like to get it out as soon as possible.

26:51.640 --> 26:52.521
And he flipped out.

26:53.121 --> 27:03.669
in an email about how I was changing the rules of the experiment or something like that and how I didn't have his consent to release the recording of me talking.

27:05.991 --> 27:06.892
Super strange.

27:07.372 --> 27:08.913
And so I didn't know what else to do.

27:08.994 --> 27:12.596
So I released it as a sub stack where I said I got an email.

27:12.636 --> 27:14.518
It's kind of like what I did with Jessica Hockett.

27:14.538 --> 27:15.539
I don't know what to do with that.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.141
You didn't mention your sister.

27:19.164 --> 27:29.233
And so these people are all playing the same game, where they get me to trust them, and then they can ask me questions, and then they can go on other podcasts and pawn some of it off as their own.

27:29.313 --> 27:31.995
So it makes it seem like, wow, we're really on the same page.

27:32.636 --> 27:36.399
And all along, their whole idea is to absorb and to ignore.

27:39.762 --> 27:45.426
And so I think either tonight or tomorrow, I'm just going to play the video that I have of this recording.

27:47.188 --> 27:53.130
It's just a video of me and you can hear his voice asking some questions, but who knows whose voice it is.

27:54.410 --> 28:04.854
Anyway, all social media right now is expressing this in terms of a worst case scenario and asking the questions.

28:04.894 --> 28:05.554
Was it a leak?

28:05.614 --> 28:06.414
Was it a release?

28:06.514 --> 28:07.455
Are they trying to kill us?

28:07.495 --> 28:08.715
Who's coming to our rescue?

28:08.735 --> 28:10.816
And is everything under their control?

28:10.836 --> 28:14.097
Is bird flu also made by them?

28:15.498 --> 28:18.239
souped up in laboratories and then released as a weapon.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.701
Don't forget, this is 2024, ladies and gentlemen.

28:25.202 --> 28:29.324
And this illusion of consensus is spread across the world.

28:31.485 --> 28:36.807
We are at a crucial moment where it's still possible that a huge number of people could be snapped out of it.

28:38.247 --> 28:39.288
But it's not long now.

28:41.325 --> 28:54.632
We only need one more presidential assassination or presidential death or something like that for us to be fast forwarded into a future that it's no longer capable of looking back to here.

28:58.564 --> 29:00.264
And that's really what this is all about.

29:00.324 --> 29:07.146
That's why this worst case scenario is being pushed on social media because this is where they wanted us to end the narrative.

29:07.206 --> 29:13.927
They wanted us to end it right here with an illusion of consensus and wondering if all of this stuff was always under their control.

29:14.647 --> 29:17.548
Wondering if they really are trying to kill us.

29:17.648 --> 29:21.929
Wondering if someone, if anyone will come to our rescue, who could it possibly be?

29:24.656 --> 29:32.784
And then they've answered those questions for us, of course, on TV and social media with an illusion of consensus about who the heroes are.

29:33.345 --> 29:47.539
That's why all around the world, in many, many countries, people know Pierre Kory, because he's flown around the world, even though he's only certified as a doctor in, I think, Illinois and Wisconsin.

29:48.792 --> 30:01.480
It's absolutely spectacular what's happening right now and how much we've been led to believe we've spontaneously come to understand, as opposed to subvertly coerced into accepting.

30:02.881 --> 30:03.601
That was pretty nice.

30:05.282 --> 30:07.344
So COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

30:08.064 --> 30:09.505
That's really where we are right now.

30:09.565 --> 30:11.866
And that's a lie, of course, because the faith is a lie.

30:11.906 --> 30:13.167
Transfection is real though.

30:14.228 --> 30:15.909
Transfection is surely real.

30:18.302 --> 30:45.879
That's why I think if you look back at how they did it, and you think about the intellectual dark web alone, and just look at the last couple of weeks, where you see one member of the intellectual dark web interviewing another member of the intellectual dark web, and then that intellectual dark web member interviewing Vivek, and then Vivek getting interviewed by another guy who was promoted by them, but not really part of the direct intellectual dark web, he could be the second layer.

30:46.539 --> 30:50.304
And then that intellectual dark web guy interviews another intellectual dark web guy.

30:50.745 --> 30:56.513
Then that other intellectual dark web guy does a show about the debates.

30:57.506 --> 31:02.748
And then they talk about Joe Rogan on that Intellectual Dark Web member show.

31:03.088 --> 31:06.890
That Intellectual Dark Web has another Intellectual Dark Web member on his show.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.851
This is also in the last few weeks.

31:09.391 --> 31:12.352
Then that Intellectual Dark Web member has Bobby on his show.

31:12.772 --> 31:14.593
Then he has Dr. Phil on his show.

31:14.653 --> 31:18.795
Dr. Phil then has Bobby on his show and also has Netanyahu on his show.

31:19.844 --> 31:23.609
And then you have this same guy also having that lady from Fox on his show.

31:23.649 --> 31:28.375
And then she's also talking about Biden and she's also talking to Steve Bannon.

31:30.216 --> 31:33.898
And of course we can go back over here and he's also gonna have Kennedy on it.

31:33.918 --> 31:36.099
I mean, Shapiro's gotta have Kennedy on his stream.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.481
And this guy will have Vivek too, who's also been promoted by them.

31:39.862 --> 31:41.983
And we'll also talk about Biden and the debates.

31:42.803 --> 31:44.504
It's like they all got the same artist.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.666
And then here we have Tucker.

31:46.706 --> 31:50.368
Of course, Tucker will have a guy from the intellectual dark web Rogan streams.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.270
And then also so will Tim Pool over and over and over again.

31:55.011 --> 31:56.752
This is just in the last couple of weeks.

31:57.759 --> 31:59.600
And that guy was also on this guy's show.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.721
And this guy also has Shapiro on his show.

32:01.761 --> 32:03.803
And this guy also has that guy on his show.

32:03.823 --> 32:05.684
So he's pretty much in the same network too.

32:08.565 --> 32:12.988
And then of course you have all kinds of other members and people that have their own podcasts on the left.

32:13.008 --> 32:16.750
You have people in Australia that regularly make fun of America.

32:18.431 --> 32:22.794
And then you have other people from the Five Eyes countries that are interviewing these same people.

32:24.721 --> 32:29.064
And these Five Eyes countries are either making fun of Americans or talking to Canadians.

32:33.627 --> 32:35.809
None of them will talk about who Ron Klain is.

32:37.099 --> 32:39.240
None of them will talk about who Averill Haynes is.

32:39.761 --> 32:43.243
None of them talk about the powers that Averill Haynes has or doesn't have.

32:43.663 --> 32:47.325
They would never talk about what the powers that Jake Sullivan has or what he does.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.987
They won't talk about Anthony Blinken very often.

32:50.367 --> 32:54.530
And they don't talk about the role that Jill Biden probably plays in the White House right now.

32:57.052 --> 33:05.537
None of these people will mention any of these people, nevermind Krupowski and Plotkin and Gallo and Baltimore and all the other

33:09.969 --> 33:24.199
Once you just start paying attention and seeing where they direct your gaze and realize that your consciousness is prime real estate and how they're playing this, they had to have these people in place.

33:24.259 --> 33:26.560
There had to be these people.

33:26.620 --> 33:32.565
Some of these people were working already because of people like Brian Hooker and this lady from NBIC.

33:35.495 --> 33:37.037
I'm sorry, I keep screwing that up.

33:37.077 --> 33:40.740
I don't know what her organization's name is, but somebody will drop it in the chat.

33:43.423 --> 33:45.925
And so I'll just pop my head out of the way a minute.

33:45.945 --> 33:50.630
Here's Robert Malone telling us that the flu is going to be some kind of thing.

33:52.471 --> 33:53.653
And avian flu

33:54.918 --> 33:58.100
Avian flu has been endemic in many parts of the world for decades.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.562
Therefore, this virus cannot be eradicated.

34:01.122 --> 34:09.467
Infections with highly pathogen avian flu have resulted in the deaths of millions of domestic birds and thousands of wild birds.

34:10.208 --> 34:14.330
A fraction of the millions of domestic birds that have died were intentionally culled.

34:14.490 --> 34:15.471
Oh, a large fraction.

34:16.954 --> 34:24.371
Throughout the current avian outbreaks, spillovers of the virus to mammals have been frequently documented.

34:24.391 --> 34:25.393
I mean, are you kidding me?

34:26.471 --> 34:34.276
Migratory waterfowl are often infected with influenza and shed large amounts of virus in their stool.

34:34.997 --> 34:36.338
It is a well-established fact.

34:36.478 --> 34:38.079
Don't walk outside with your mouth open.

34:38.879 --> 34:46.464
It's a well-established fact that all influenza A viruses, including this one, exhibit exceptional stability in wet environments.

34:46.484 --> 34:47.385
What?

34:48.065 --> 34:50.147
Holy shit.

34:50.527 --> 34:56.071
No human deaths or hospitalizations have been reported from the current circulating strain.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.772
Cattle can be infected with the current circulating strain.

35:00.792 --> 35:07.957
There is no evidence that the strain circulating in American birds is highly pathogenic or even lethal in cattle, humans, or other mammals.

35:07.997 --> 35:11.659
When infected, it's there, it's there, it's real, it's there.

35:14.121 --> 35:17.883
Open source with waterfowl, so it's possible, it's there.

35:18.764 --> 35:21.606
Milk machines could spread it, unproven at this time.

35:21.626 --> 35:27.090
Wow, unconsumption of unpasteurized milk, oh no.

35:28.410 --> 35:31.832
Milk is unlikely to enter the flu supply, but unlikely.

35:31.892 --> 35:35.714
He's already seeding the narrative of a contaminated food supply.

35:35.734 --> 35:40.676
Of course, Andrew Huff is really an expert on the contaminated food supply.

35:40.696 --> 35:51.061
He did like a couple papers for somebody, writing some papers about contamination of a supply chain or some shit.

35:52.602 --> 36:04.153
And of course, you know, the day wouldn't be complete if I didn't point out that the Brownstone Institute is apparently being retweeted or republished or publishing articles of the Defender.

36:04.693 --> 36:10.158
And this one is, government's pandemic preparedness operation looks a lot like arsonists running the fire department.

36:10.879 --> 36:14.842
It says by the Brownstone Institute, July 2nd, 2024.

36:14.902 --> 36:20.045
But then down here, it's Clayton Baker, MD, and Brian Hooker, PhD.

36:20.185 --> 36:27.490
So it looks like a pretty good collaboration between the Children's Health Defense Defender and

36:29.031 --> 36:34.736
and Brownstone Institute, which is somewhat discouraging, but it's not like I didn't really get that already.

36:34.796 --> 36:36.097
Of course, that's going to be the case.

36:37.078 --> 36:45.205
Imagine, if you will, an exceptionally ambitious city fire department located in a city with very few naturally occurring fires.

36:45.825 --> 36:52.951
These ambitious firemen do not have nearly enough work prestige or pay for their liking, uninterested in simply polishing their trucks.

36:53.712 --> 36:58.256
lifting weights and cooking chili, these firemen want more, a lot more.

36:58.376 --> 37:21.754
So you're already painting an interesting picture where people that study viruses are such shitheads that they've decided to create dangerous viruses in order to justify their existence, which is already an incredibly far-fetched narrative relative to, for example, a biosecurity state that doesn't really have anything to scare you with, but needs you to believe that there's something scary out there.

37:26.650 --> 37:35.970
This is extremely discouraging to me because rather than coming up with an apt metaphor for what we're dealing with or what we likely are dealing with,

37:36.553 --> 37:50.808
They are painting biologists as people who are such shitheads that they would make dangerous viruses just so that grant applications become easier to get fulfilled or that they can get funding easier.

37:50.868 --> 37:55.052
Because, you know, if we create dangerous viruses, then that's where we get funding.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.974
And that's not even how the system works.

37:57.134 --> 37:57.635
Wow.

37:59.343 --> 38:00.384
They construct a plan.

38:00.404 --> 38:07.409
They will start a research program funded by taxpayers where they will develop an arsenal of the biggest, scariest, most flammable products on earth.

38:07.449 --> 38:09.691
See, this is completely wrong.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.292
It's completely disingenuous.

38:11.352 --> 38:12.893
It's not even the Scooby-Doo.

38:14.054 --> 38:25.263
The Scooby-Doo where people made a mistake and then covered it up, or people were trying to invent a bioweapon, or people were making a huge quantity of something they shouldn't have made a huge, it's nothing like that.

38:28.288 --> 38:41.261
We're talking about ambitious biologists who don't have nearly enough work prestige or pay for their liking, uninterested in simply using their microscopes and culturing their cells.

38:42.822 --> 38:47.727
And going to conferences, these biologists want more, a lot more.

38:47.787 --> 38:48.988
So they construct a plan.

38:49.028 --> 38:57.496
They will start a research program funded by taxpayers where they will develop the most dangerous, scariest biology on earth.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.919
I mean, listen to how dumb that is.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.154
I'm extremely disappointed.

39:14.455 --> 39:25.002
The fire department develops and grows its stockpile of manufactured fire super hazards until one day, oops.

39:27.063 --> 39:36.409
And the image that the Children's Health Defense Defender has decided to post with the Brownstone Institute article

39:37.685 --> 39:42.248
is an American flag with a burning virus overlay.

39:44.870 --> 39:49.132
An American flag with a burning virus overlay.

39:49.172 --> 39:54.996
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but this is not the patriotic organization you were looking for.

39:56.557 --> 40:04.242
This is not the organization that is trying to save children from a criminal vaccine schedule, at least not in my best estimation.

40:05.768 --> 40:10.290
And now they are retweeting Brownstone, which I have a feeling is a bad organization.

40:10.330 --> 40:12.511
I've had a bad feeling about them for quite some time.

40:12.531 --> 40:23.076
And then they gave Brett Weinstein a... They gave Brett Weinstein a fellowship and then I was sold.

40:23.576 --> 40:24.717
Then I knew they were good.

40:31.761 --> 40:36.002
And so today I want to give another shout out to Joe Marshall of The Liberty Perspective.

40:36.062 --> 40:45.985
If you go to Rumble somebody in the chat and you look up The Liberty Perspective as a channel and then copy that link and put it in the chat, I would be greatly appreciated.

40:47.105 --> 40:50.106
Joe Marshall has become a pen pal of mine.

40:52.520 --> 41:05.085
He sent me a letter, he sent me a few emails, and I covered or gave a shout out to his channel once when he had about 20 followers, and now he has a whopping 120 followers.

41:05.765 --> 41:10.227
So if any of you went over there to subscribe to that, that would be really great.

41:10.347 --> 41:13.008
I understand that a lot of people don't even have an account on Rumble.

41:14.355 --> 41:22.081
But Joe Marshall's also got a book, Last Call for Liberty, and I assume it's available somewhere if you Google that as well.

41:22.981 --> 41:29.366
But if you find him on Rumble or you look him up, you'll be able to find him and I can put you in touch with him if it's something very important.

41:30.026 --> 41:35.992
He's actually going to read an article that he wrote a year and a half before making this video a couple days ago.

41:36.752 --> 41:39.275
And so it's an article with links and stuff.

41:39.335 --> 41:46.721
And so if there's anybody else who's doing any research on this dude, if you can find where he publishes some of these texts, that would also be great.

41:48.303 --> 41:52.567
And if when Joe catches this video, I'm sure he'll send me the links and then I can put them up as well.

41:53.467 --> 42:20.938
I'm very tempted to add Joe to the list of people that I advertised at the beginning of the show Because I just got the feeling that this guy is doing a lot of what I intend to do in the future Let me just get out of here and pull this up You'll see that Joe has very similar taste in hats that I do I'm not so into the blaze orange, but I Get it.

42:21.559 --> 42:22.019
I have got a

42:23.519 --> 42:30.905
Somewhere over there I think I have a Green Bay Packer hat that is actually real tree camo and bright orange in the back.

42:30.965 --> 42:31.526
It's pretty funny.

42:32.667 --> 42:43.636
And that is actually the other thing that everybody wears at Packer games is their snowmobile suits that are usually bright or else their hunting gear because a lot of times those are the

42:44.176 --> 42:45.837
the warmest jackets that they've got there.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.860
Anyway, and that's become a thing now.

42:49.440 --> 42:53.243
Anyway, anyway, anyway, let's get on with the show.

42:55.346 --> 43:11.969
So this is a essay He's gonna read an essay that he did about the Brownstone Institute about a year and a half ago And so I think it's really nice Because he's on to some things that I heard actually at the red pill conference the day after It was over on Monday.

43:12.029 --> 43:20.031
We had breakfast and we got a lecture from G Edward Griffin and I gotta say a 90 plus year old man

43:21.712 --> 43:25.114
sharp as a razor blade and extremely witty.

43:25.715 --> 43:34.301
And also, I actually learned a lot from listening to that hour and, you know, eating scrambled eggs and stuff while I was doing it was an extra luxury.

43:34.321 --> 43:41.246
I gotta say, it really comes down to collectivism versus individualism.

43:41.306 --> 43:43.708
And it comes down to the fact, in my humble opinion,

43:44.378 --> 44:02.731
that the American ideal was an ideal about individualism, that states should protect the rights of the individual because when the individual is truly free to pursue happiness in the state of liberty, then the most benefit to society will come from that individual.

44:03.391 --> 44:11.414
And if society is organized around protecting the rights of society, then individuals will not thrive and individuals will not be free.

44:11.434 --> 44:12.675
And that's called collectivism.

44:13.195 --> 44:27.140
And so communism, totalitarianism, fascism, Black Lives Matter-ism and woke-ism, these are all things that are the same kind of, you know, communistic, communitarian is the word that

44:27.700 --> 44:32.964
that Christine Grady used as she described the ethics of a pandemic.

44:33.044 --> 44:35.285
And so these are all collectivist notions.

44:35.845 --> 44:49.594
And that's one of the ways that they have used the biology of a pandemic and the biology of vaccines and infectious disease to declare war on this idea of individualism versus collectivism.

44:50.075 --> 44:51.636
And they want you to feel guilty for

44:52.276 --> 45:17.997
for thinking that you have individual rights to decide whatever the hell you want to do, because then that goes against this collectivist idea that you owe something to society, rather than society being essentially, you know, free individuals are the best component of society, the most robust and the most, how do you say it?

45:19.082 --> 45:19.764
most valuable.

45:20.465 --> 45:24.434
And so once you start to restrict the freedoms of an individual,

45:26.568 --> 45:30.129
then society as a whole is not enriched in the way it otherwise would be.

45:30.250 --> 45:33.711
And that's the idea of America from the very beginning.

45:33.771 --> 45:39.153
And I'm not expressing it nearly as well as somebody like G. Edward Griffin can.

45:39.193 --> 45:50.118
So if you go look for his stuff, you can find him on the net and then you can find all of these things, which I'm eventually gonna have a link to on my website, but I don't have it there yet.

45:50.158 --> 45:55.960
So I'm gonna let Joe take it away and probably interrupt him a few hundred times, but let's see what we do here.

45:56.994 --> 45:58.318
Welcome back to the Liberty Perspective.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.544
Today I want to talk to you about

46:02.330 --> 46:11.956
Brownstone Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey Tucker's organization and all the fellows, the academic fellows that he has in there that are all part of the medical freedom movement.

46:12.516 --> 46:20.641
And it's been kind of, you know, for a while now, I've been asking, sent quite a few emails to Jeffrey Tucker, asking him about, you know, the human rights aspect of things.

46:20.681 --> 46:23.203
You know, they're kind of they include human rights.

46:23.463 --> 46:27.145
They don't mention so much our individual rights and liberty as our as our founding.

46:27.245 --> 46:27.886
You know, he likes to

46:28.993 --> 46:37.100
Anyways, there's a kind of a convolution there, and I was just hoping to get it straightened out, and I sent him some emails and asked him different things about stuff, and I've never heard back from him.

46:37.300 --> 46:39.462
I've never heard back from him on anything.

46:39.922 --> 46:53.754
I think he said thank you once when I sent him the mass formation, the liberty perspective that I did on, if you could call it a critique, I don't know, but I did on Matthias Desmet's psychology of totalitarianism.

46:53.774 --> 46:55.095
I did a show on that, which,

46:56.116 --> 47:23.723
you know, deciphering the collectivism of Matthias Desmet's mass formation or proto-totalitarian psychology of totalitarianism, where he basically blames everything on the individualism, free markets and individual rights and liberty as being the source, the ideological source, the philosophical source of all totalitarian states hitherto known to mankind, you know, should you not check it out?

47:24.258 --> 47:29.721
But anyways, today, what I'd like to get into, I got a thing I wrote a year and a half, two years ago, or whatever.

47:29.741 --> 47:30.402
I don't even know.

47:30.442 --> 47:37.906
But I wrote Brownstone, Champions of Liberty, or Collectivist Human Rights Advocates Incognito.

47:38.647 --> 47:39.267
I still don't know.

47:39.967 --> 47:42.049
Still trying to find out about this medical freedom movement.

47:42.269 --> 47:48.512
What's the freedom in the medical freedom movement supposed to be?

47:49.093 --> 47:51.274
Is it our individual rights, our founding principles?

47:53.806 --> 48:02.654
founding republic, free society, similar, or a constitutional republic, or limited constitution, is it free enterprise, free markets, what is it?

48:03.015 --> 48:03.495
You know what I mean?

48:03.655 --> 48:18.349
We're starting to get an idea lately as you see some of this freedom, quote unquote freedom in the medical freedom movement starting to come into question with, I don't know, Dr. McCullough, Peter McCullough out there, you know, introducing an mRNA platform

48:20.106 --> 48:29.941
Vaccine vaccine so now for all the problems that everybody's having for the mRNA jabs cold jabs They're gonna have another mRNA jab to fix the jab.

48:30.101 --> 48:30.702
You know, I don't know

48:31.966 --> 48:33.627
So that's pretty extraordinary, right?

48:33.667 --> 48:45.617
This is not a biologist, but somebody who's really picked up on the absolute contradiction that he is pushing some kind of mRNA jab for an mRNA jab.

48:46.397 --> 48:53.082
He's also pushing some kind of nanosynthetic antibodies that are just one fragment of the antibody or something like this.

48:54.123 --> 48:59.107
Um, all very extraordinary moves on, uh, Peter McCullough's part.

49:00.008 --> 49:11.377
Um, and it may be because he spoke out so, so, um, so aggressively against the vaccine schedule a couple of times that he's been kind of forced to say these crazy things.

49:11.457 --> 49:17.122
But, um, yeah, I mean, I mean, Joe's completely right here and it's, and it's impressive.

49:17.182 --> 49:20.645
It's a, it's a feather in his hat that, that he's on top of it in that way.

49:20.665 --> 49:22.106
I don't know.

49:22.927 --> 49:23.207
I don't know.

49:25.046 --> 49:29.229
You got other people like Dr. Pierre Corey, you're finding out why he's calling for public-private partnerships.

49:29.249 --> 49:32.411
He's a medical freedom doctor calling for more public-private partnerships.

49:33.412 --> 49:49.303
You know, come to find out he was, you know, the one who testified on behalf of, you know, George Floyd's family and basically put it out there that he was murdered by the cops and ensuing chaos.

49:50.487 --> 49:54.290
cities and everything getting burned down to the ground all across the country and sued right after that.

49:54.570 --> 49:56.111
I mean, medical freedom doctor, right?

49:56.131 --> 49:56.452
I don't know.

49:57.052 --> 49:57.372
I don't know.

49:58.573 --> 50:03.557
But then you've got, you know, the Great Awakening tour.

50:03.577 --> 50:05.519
I don't know the new freedom as Trump.

50:06.520 --> 50:10.483
And you got other people, the new the new medical freedom is going to be Kennedy, right?

50:11.403 --> 50:11.724
I don't know.

50:12.764 --> 50:18.509
But none of them have pointed to the individual rights and liberty of our founding as of yet.

50:20.222 --> 50:20.782
I've been asking.

50:21.962 --> 50:25.963
But anyways, so the Brownstone Institute, I've had questions about the Brownstone Institute.

50:25.983 --> 50:37.526
I've been kind of holding off, hoping that they'd come around, that it was just a mistake that they were calling our individual human, individual... That extra buzz in the background is on his recording, not on mine, just so you can hear it.

50:38.386 --> 50:41.107
I mean, there is something in the background of mine, but not like this.

50:41.227 --> 50:49.749
Natural, endowed by our creator, unalienable individual rights and liberty, just confusing them with, you know, the populism of the term human rights, but...

50:51.564 --> 51:12.280
I'm gonna go over some stuff and I'll leave that with you this is with this information and you can make that determination But I've got this article that I wrote I'm gonna share it with you here If you can see that Give her to I got my dog with me any pee I don't know how much of this shit she can take for she bugs out but if she does Take care of that then but um

51:12.853 --> 51:41.387
okay brownstone champions of liberty or collectivist human rights advocates incognito to some people there's a higher just you know it's just semantics but i'm telling you i've done enough shows on here where you can go and see where i'm coming from human rights intrinsically implicitly inherently uh... correlate to world socialism globalist world socialism global governance you can't have human rights without the

51:42.677 --> 51:46.220
Global world socialism that it that it that it that's implicit to it.

51:46.581 --> 51:47.201
You see what I'm saying?

51:47.461 --> 52:05.838
But anyways As a totalitarianism of pandemic mandates and lockdowns continues to expand the technocratic influence of the science and academia behind Being used to justify it is expanding as well few to none remain among them who would dare to counter the centrally planned narrative for any reason be it life or liberty or

52:06.829 --> 52:16.034
except for maybe the Brownstone Institute, whose website says that they're a small scholarly group of scientists and intellectuals who, at least at the onset, appear to be bucking the trend.

52:16.074 --> 52:20.496
Again, I wrote this year and a half ago, last year anyways, right?

52:21.057 --> 52:28.361
In a recent article posted under the large and looming image of a cock guillotine, they bluntly ask who will be held responsible for this devastation.

52:30.282 --> 52:30.762
That article.

52:32.642 --> 52:36.726
If we can get it to come up, no longer has that picture of the big picture of the guillotine.

52:37.066 --> 52:37.626
They changed it.

52:37.646 --> 52:39.748
I don't know.

52:40.529 --> 52:44.933
Anyways, it used to be a big picture of a big guillotine, cocked and ready to fricking drop.

52:45.353 --> 52:50.657
Presumably, like in the French Revolution, once they figure it out, some heads are going to roll.

52:51.258 --> 52:58.304
For many, sick of the loss of liberty, that alone could be reason enough to want to welcome and hear more of what this group of renegade intellectuals has to say.

52:58.544 --> 52:59.085
And I agree.

52:59.265 --> 52:59.965
As the author says,

53:00.726 --> 53:08.969
If the pandemic policy response had taken the form of mere advice, we would not be in the midst of this social, economic, cultural, and political disaster."

53:09.249 --> 53:09.649
Unquote.

53:10.290 --> 53:18.273
So here you can hear him identifying that the Brownstone Institute is writing it as we are in a socio... What?

53:21.094 --> 53:27.296
We are in a socio-economic, cultural, and political disaster, which is a pretty incredible statement.

53:28.336 --> 53:29.497
And I agree that it's...

53:30.427 --> 53:32.928
that it's the compulsion that's the source of all these issues.

53:33.388 --> 53:35.449
But what's the source of the compulsion?

53:38.430 --> 53:48.633
What was the source of the compulsion in the centralized COVID narrative, COVID protocol, COVID countermeasures mandates?

53:50.673 --> 53:51.794
What's the source of the compulsion?

53:54.114 --> 53:58.776
Just skip the head to kill it, you know, like, it's collectivism, but I'm going to get there.

53:59.724 --> 54:00.364
Presumably, okay.

54:01.725 --> 54:01.926
Yeah.

54:04.347 --> 54:05.068
The answer is simple.

54:05.348 --> 54:05.868
Collectivism.

54:06.669 --> 54:08.130
I'm on the same page with myself, I guess.

54:08.570 --> 54:15.955
If not for the tenets of collectivism permeating the mindset of both government and the people, none of these mandates or lockdowns would have or could have possibly happened.

54:19.545 --> 54:35.197
without a collectivist mindset on not only the part of the planners and the quote-unquote elite, but on the masses at large conditioned to the collectivist mindset and the duties owed to the collective.

54:36.266 --> 54:37.387
None of that shit would have happened.

54:38.027 --> 54:42.769
When they first started coming out with all these socialist distancing and all this fricking shit, I was like, I hope they don't fall for it.

54:42.789 --> 54:43.889
I hope these people don't fall for it.

54:44.290 --> 54:47.751
They came up with the mask mandates and the lockdowns and all this other shit.

54:48.191 --> 54:51.253
If people had a free mindset, none of that shit would have flown.

54:51.913 --> 54:55.174
They tried to implement that shit 50 years ago, none of that shit would have flown.

54:55.475 --> 54:58.236
Even 25 years ago, maybe even 15 years ago.

55:00.357 --> 55:01.717
But they had a collectivist mindset.

55:01.757 --> 55:05.019
Everybody, everybody's got the same collectivist mindset from the planners,

55:06.161 --> 55:12.727
to the, you know, compliant masses and everybody in between all the Project Halo, fricking influencers and all that shit.

55:12.747 --> 55:14.890
They all had the same social contract training, you know.

55:17.172 --> 55:28.202
But however, for the past 150 years or so, the mindset of America, as well as the world at large, has been undergoing a radical fundamental transformation from one of freedom, autonomy and unalienable.

55:28.863 --> 55:30.705
No lien can be put on our natural rights.

55:31.345 --> 55:34.546
Collectivist rights, human rights, have that social contract lien.

55:34.866 --> 55:41.107
Can't be spoken of outside the context of the duties owed back to the collective from which they came.

55:43.448 --> 55:58.631
Autonomy, from one of freedom, autonomy, an unalienable, natural, and or God-given individual rights and liberty necessary for a truly free and independent pursuit of happiness to one of a collectivist living for the sake of others' altruism and human rights-based security of person.

56:00.054 --> 56:02.335
Necessary for mass compliance with central planning.

56:03.776 --> 56:04.957
Our Declaration of Independence.

56:07.098 --> 56:08.299
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.862
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

56:13.782 --> 56:15.643
Life, liberty, security of person.

56:16.264 --> 56:17.064
They sound familiar?

56:17.585 --> 56:18.585
Totally opposite in meaning.

56:19.246 --> 56:19.866
Totally opposite.

56:20.086 --> 56:21.867
One is liberty and freedom.

56:21.907 --> 56:26.370
The other one is literal enslavement to the will of others, to the central plan.

56:29.349 --> 56:31.290
Accordingly, such lockdowns were eventually inevitable.

56:31.950 --> 56:40.752
The fact that they actually happen now is only proof of the saturation level of just such a populist collectivist mindset hasn't only reached but surpassed the level needed to ensure mass compliance.

56:41.212 --> 56:49.515
What Gramsci, Antonio Gramsci, called natural consent, immediate consent,

56:50.987 --> 56:51.727
I'll think of it in a minute.

56:52.208 --> 56:54.069
But anyways, um, spontaneous consent.

56:54.969 --> 56:55.869
Spontaneous consent.

56:56.310 --> 56:57.150
You're trained.

56:58.271 --> 57:01.212
You get your cue, you get your order, you're trained, you respond.

57:01.732 --> 57:02.613
Just like a trained animal.

57:02.833 --> 57:03.253
No different.

57:09.997 --> 57:13.798
At which point, all the planners had to do was flip the switch for whatever reason.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.100
Warp speed was the switch.

57:16.260 --> 57:16.720
They flipped it.

57:19.096 --> 57:20.976
at least on the level of the masses.

57:21.797 --> 57:41.181
And coming out against the lockdowns, academic organizations like the Brownstone Institute, if genuine, can become a valuable source of real and well-documented non-conspiratorial scientific information countering the technocratic narrative defenders of liberty have been starving for.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.982
The whole time, I was pretty much on my own.

57:44.682 --> 57:45.202
Here all through 2020, 2021, 2022,

57:49.650 --> 57:52.791
I was putting out information, trying to gather information, because none of it sounded right to me.

57:52.811 --> 57:54.112
None of the numbers were adding up to me.

57:54.132 --> 57:55.032
So we started researching.

57:55.052 --> 58:00.474
And I was always looking for objective, scientific information that I could use to say, hey, people, look it.

58:00.815 --> 58:02.055
The narrative is bullshit.

58:02.755 --> 58:07.597
And here's some scientific evidence to the contrary that they're not allowing because of narrative control, right?

58:07.617 --> 58:10.599
I was on my own.

58:10.619 --> 58:13.300
I was always looking for places like the Brownstone Institute.

58:13.320 --> 58:17.401
When they came out with all the information they had on mass, I'd use a lot of their information, their scientific information,

58:21.206 --> 58:24.827
get people as much information on what the hell was going on as I could, right?

58:26.188 --> 58:29.989
So yeah.

58:31.849 --> 58:35.810
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they're a pro-individual liberty organization.

58:36.851 --> 58:43.173
As Brownstone's own About page points out, their social message is at best convoluted.

58:43.973 --> 58:44.933
OK, this is their social.

58:44.953 --> 58:47.634
Let's see if it even comes up.

58:48.314 --> 58:49.675
Yep, there's their About page.

58:52.162 --> 58:53.163
This is from the About page.

58:53.183 --> 59:00.451
The revision, it says, is that of the Enlightenment, the elevated learning, science, progress, and universal rights.

59:01.072 --> 59:06.177
The motive force of Brownstone Institute is the global crisis created by the policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

59:07.499 --> 59:10.162
Jeffrey Tucker was also involved with the Great Barrington Declaration.

59:11.664 --> 59:18.989
The trauma revealed a fundamental misunderstanding alive in all countries around the world today, a willingness on the part of the public and officials to relinquish.

59:19.249 --> 59:21.190
Jordan Peterson says it's a trauma.

59:21.270 --> 59:25.473
It's a psychological trauma, and he doesn't have any defense against it any other than us.

59:25.533 --> 59:28.015
He's just, he's a psychological disarray.

59:30.036 --> 59:34.659
And so here's the Brownstone Institute again, stating that this is a public health crisis.

59:34.740 --> 59:36.681
The pandemic is definitely real.

59:36.721 --> 59:38.242
And the response screwed it up.

59:41.035 --> 59:42.496
It's it's incredible, really.

59:43.177 --> 59:48.181
Freedom and fundamental human rights in the name of managing a public health crisis.

59:49.562 --> 01:00:00.831
The Brownstone Institute regards the great task of our times as rebuilding the foundation of liberalism as classically understood, including core values of human rights.

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.036
He contradicts himself.

01:00:07.779 --> 01:00:30.027
The brownstone literally ideologically and philosophically counter contradicts itself a multiple times So if you're trying to understand what the hell they're actually saying here, this this is so convoluted You wouldn't I can't tell what they're saying and I'm gonna go over that in a minute But I got an idea that they're just are they trying to convolute truth?

01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:30.708
Are they?

01:00:31.664 --> 01:00:43.868
Mistaking human rights for our individual rights and the classic liberalism that they say they are or they are they just do they know what frickin you do they know the world socialism of what that the human rights represents and They're just trying to confuse everybody.

01:00:44.228 --> 01:00:50.491
It's like that bug zapper you put up there You draw the frickin bugs to the light and then frickin zap them.

01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:50.991
I don't know.

01:00:51.671 --> 01:00:52.051
I don't know.

01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:54.112
I'm at a loss You know, I'm at a loss

01:00:58.243 --> 01:01:03.606
The point is that despite being against the lockdowns, there are still academics who at heart are still human rights advocates.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.887
I'm going to say, look at the Enlightenment.

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:07.828
I'm just going to go on.

01:01:07.848 --> 01:01:09.668
I'll go back to it if I don't cover it here.

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:14.511
As such, they have not divorced themselves of the collectivism that got us here in the first place.

01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:14.951
Right.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:28.333
It was the collectivism of the whole COVID narrative, centralized COVID narrative, centralized COVID protocols, COVID lockdowns, everything was centralized.

01:01:28.633 --> 01:01:31.033
You can't have that without a full-blown collectivism.

01:01:32.274 --> 01:01:32.834
Can't have it.

01:01:33.954 --> 01:01:35.654
Centralized shit, central planning.

01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:38.675
They haven't divorced themselves of the collectivism.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:46.117
If they're pushing human rights, if they're pushing the enlightenment, other than John Locke, Adams, and maybe a couple others,

01:01:46.926 --> 01:02:10.842
The rest of the whole quote unquote enlightenment coming out of the French Revolution is nothing but the secularization and collectivization of humanity towards the end goal of a single global human organism run by one queen, be it one dictator, king, queen, or a single table of central planners, you know, stakeholder model beehive, right?

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:11.723
I don't know.

01:02:13.553 --> 01:02:14.114
Doesn't matter.

01:02:14.134 --> 01:02:15.255
It's all the same collectivism.

01:02:16.016 --> 01:02:21.504
And they obviously if they're pushing human rights, they haven't divorced themselves of the collectivism that got us here.

01:02:21.544 --> 01:02:25.048
So what's the freedom in the medical freedom movement that they're pushing?

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.790
I don't know.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:27.932
Still don't know.

01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:31.717
Digging in a little bit more here, you know.

01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:37.322
The Enlightenment, we need to remember, didn't just bring us Thomas Jefferson, John Locke, and Adam Smith.

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.603
It also brought us the collectivist social contracts.

01:02:39.943 --> 01:02:45.784
General will and force to be free, moral liberty of Hobbes, Rousseau, and not to mention the guillotines of the French Revolution.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:49.765
Well, that whole concept, you know, Hobbes was before the Enlightenment, but it goes back to Hobbes.

01:02:49.805 --> 01:02:51.026
It goes back to Plato.

01:02:51.866 --> 01:02:55.747
Plato's Republic, the whole centralized utopian society, right?

01:03:00.262 --> 01:03:02.883
And not to mention the guillotines of the French Revolution.

01:03:03.383 --> 01:03:04.404
That was the Enlightenment.

01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:16.869
It's what brought us the collectivism of secular humanism, critical theory, socialism, communism, in the age of reasons, materialist sciences, born to prove the fallacy of the individual.

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:18.810
The fallacy of the individual.

01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:23.612
This is Michael Bakunin, Man, Society, Freedom.

01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:25.233
This is anarchist doctrine.

01:03:26.353 --> 01:03:26.974
The whole thing.

01:03:28.163 --> 01:03:32.705
The Human Rights, Universal Declaration of Human Rights is consistent with all that.

01:03:33.245 --> 01:03:37.327
Eradication of any value to the human individual outside society.

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:39.368
It's the society that gives you value.

01:03:40.868 --> 01:03:44.670
We're an individual rights and liberty, our founding republic.

01:03:47.651 --> 01:03:49.532
Every individual life has intrinsic value.

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:54.614
You don't, your value isn't determined by that value which you add to society.

01:03:54.974 --> 01:03:57.175
Anything outside that, you become a drag to society.

01:03:59.070 --> 01:03:59.330
You know?

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:09.315
But anyways, so it's what brought us to collectivism of secular humanism.

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.356
Ever read the Humanist Manifesto?

01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:13.276
Try reading the Humanist Manifesto sometime.

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:15.257
All three of them, every 40 years or so, they come out with a new one.

01:04:15.277 --> 01:04:16.018
The first one was written in 1933.

01:04:16.558 --> 01:04:17.918
You should read it.

01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:21.240
Second one came out 40 years later, and then 40 years later.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.661
I think it was every 40 years, I don't know.

01:04:22.941 --> 01:04:25.322
But you'll see how they change, how they change.

01:04:26.358 --> 01:04:31.162
the terminologies and words that they're using to today's collectivism, global world collectivism.

01:04:32.423 --> 01:04:34.966
Critical theory, you know, critical race theory, that whole thing right there.

01:04:35.026 --> 01:04:47.917
Socialism, communism, the age of reasons, materialist science is born to prove the fallacy of the individual like radical revolutionary anarchism does the same thing and facilitates not only the abolition of the family and all the objective eternal absolute truth.

01:04:49.139 --> 01:05:00.662
and facilitates not only the abolition of the family and all objective eternal and absolute truths, but the annihilation of an ultimate patriarchy and the superstition of God himself.

01:05:01.182 --> 01:05:08.064
That's really the essence of collectivist doctrine, be it anarchist, humanist, communist, even nationalist.

01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:09.345
It's all the same.

01:05:09.825 --> 01:05:10.305
They all do the same.

01:05:10.525 --> 01:05:11.405
Abolition of the family.

01:05:12.285 --> 01:05:13.806
OK, let me see what we got here.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:14.506
Uh-huh.

01:05:14.866 --> 01:05:15.966
Oh, it's Communist Manifesto.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.307
It says it right in the Communist Manifesto.

01:05:20.327 --> 01:05:26.242
A couple of misunderstandings here, misrepresentations to be revealed here are Brownstone's own, okay?

01:05:26.994 --> 01:05:38.983
One, to rebuild the foundation of classic liberalism on the core values of human rights would be to rebuild the foundation of individual rights and liberty within the confines of the collectivism targeting them for destruction.

01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:41.845
See, that's why I don't get why people are trying to say that it's just semantics.

01:05:41.925 --> 01:05:51.031
Oh, people aren't ready to differentiate, to clarify the difference between human rights and our individual rights and liberty, our natural individual rights and liberty.

01:05:51.271 --> 01:05:51.812
We don't need to clarify.

01:05:51.832 --> 01:05:52.552
People aren't ready for that.

01:05:52.572 --> 01:05:53.613
They just think they're the same thing.

01:05:53.893 --> 01:05:55.294
Well, right there, I just went over that.

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:56.315
I'm going to read that to you again

01:05:59.028 --> 01:06:01.729
It's not just semantics.

01:06:02.469 --> 01:06:16.653
To rebuild the foundation of classic liberalism, as Brownstone says it wants to do, on the core values on human rights would be to rebuild the foundation of individual rights and liberty within the confines of the collectivism targeting them for destruction.

01:06:16.713 --> 01:06:18.093
It can't be put any clearer than that.

01:06:18.554 --> 01:06:19.554
At least I haven't seen it.

01:06:19.974 --> 01:06:21.214
Maybe an academic could do it.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:31.465
jar themselves of their stupor, their mental, if they have the mental metanoia, as Dr. James Thorpe puts it, to do it, right?

01:06:32.386 --> 01:06:35.328
The other, which within the confines of the collectivism targeted for destruction.

01:06:35.348 --> 01:06:42.514
The other, sorry, which most have yet to realize is that the concept of universal human rights has already done just that.

01:06:44.815 --> 01:06:57.792
human rights, takes liberty, even individual rights and liberty, and restructures it, redefines it within the confines of the collectivism targeting them for destruction within the world globalist

01:06:59.602 --> 01:07:07.485
That's why a lot of nationalists, a lot of far-right people might have an argument against human rights because it's a globalist, leftist, collectivist fricking concept more than it is a nationalist.

01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:13.368
But nationalists, you'll see them hating human rights and also agreeing with human rights at the same time.

01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:19.590
That's not something that you should be too surprised to find either.

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:21.411
But either way, it's collectivism.

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:22.091
It's collectivism.

01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:24.452
Let me see.

01:07:24.472 --> 01:07:24.912
Where was I?

01:07:28.386 --> 01:07:39.991
The simple truth is that there is no and can be no violation or relinquishing of any fundamental human right in the name of managing this or any public crisis and managing the COVID or any public crisis.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:52.396
As even individual human rights mean absolutely nothing outside their collectivist context, their social contract context, that the needs of society as per its planners always come first.

01:07:52.776 --> 01:07:57.478
In short, the collective freedom of society determines the extent of the individual freedom as opposed to

01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:03.164
under our Constitution, where it's the freedom of our individual rights and liberty that determine the governing limits of society.

01:08:03.404 --> 01:08:20.471
Accordingly, there is no and can be no such thing as a human right to not wear a mask or refuse the vaccine or not comply with any collective society or not comply with any of the lockdowns and mandates anywhere it has been deemed in the best interest of the collective or society to do so.

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.872
This is a source I got on as individual freedom in a collective context.

01:08:27.514 --> 01:08:28.334
This was back in 2020.

01:08:28.474 --> 01:08:49.351
And they asked the question, by asking me to incorporate a philosopher and a fine scholar with a PhD from Germany responded to my recent columns on the idea of freedom by asking me to incorporate the idea of individual freedom into my argument.

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:51.453
It is an intriguing line of thought.

01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:53.892
that I intended to pursue.

01:08:54.773 --> 01:08:59.658
My argument in this regard is that the individual's freedom makes sense in the context of society.

01:09:00.078 --> 01:09:00.939
This is where they're coming from.

01:09:00.999 --> 01:09:02.080
I'm not making this shit up.

01:09:02.561 --> 01:09:03.121
It's out there.

01:09:03.282 --> 01:09:04.783
It's a commonplace.

01:09:05.744 --> 01:09:13.893
It's known amongst collectivists and human rights advocates that your individual rights and liberty are meaningless outside their collectivist context.

01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:19.036
The collective freedom of society determines the extent of the individual's freedom.

01:09:19.116 --> 01:09:20.537
I mean, it's right there.

01:09:21.798 --> 01:09:22.298
You know what I mean?

01:09:22.638 --> 01:09:24.239
This is where these people are coming from.

01:09:24.259 --> 01:09:25.300
I just wanted you to see that.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.160
That's why I put that there.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.361
It's not me.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:30.783
I'm just bringing this information to you so you can see how these people freaking think.

01:09:31.864 --> 01:09:33.505
They're talking about human rights and freedom and liberty.

01:09:33.985 --> 01:09:44.632
According to their collectivist mindset, you're hearing those same words that from a, well, if you're an American with any remembrance of what America was and our founding principles were and individual rights and liberty are,

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.348
You're going to hear them according to how you understand them.

01:09:47.788 --> 01:09:49.768
You're hearing the opposite of what they're actually freaking saying.

01:09:49.808 --> 01:09:50.509
Like, oh, that's cool.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:53.630
You know.

01:09:55.450 --> 01:10:01.152
But from a liberty perspective, it's not cool, and that's why I'm trying to unravel the convolution here.

01:10:01.212 --> 01:10:01.672
You know what I mean?

01:10:01.692 --> 01:10:05.433
I'm trying to unravel the convolution so you can have this information kicking around yourself.

01:10:05.973 --> 01:10:08.494
You know, maybe I'm just freaking seeing shit.

01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:11.215
Maybe I'm just maybe I'm maybe I'm crazy.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:11.575
I don't know.

01:10:12.517 --> 01:10:15.638
I don't think I am, but I'm giving you this information.

01:10:15.658 --> 01:10:16.918
You can just decide for yourself.

01:10:17.558 --> 01:10:22.080
Because it's, I don't know, when I see it, it makes me mad that they're doing this to people.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:35.824
And it's all part of the, you know, applied psychology tactics to do exactly what they're doing, to use your own biases, our own biases against us, to manipulate us into accepting the plan.

01:10:36.821 --> 01:10:38.302
Gramsci said it's the free.

01:10:38.382 --> 01:10:58.154
It's it's the Conformity that's been proposed to us as freedom His plans coming together pretty good in this too Bottom line is that human rights are not the individual rights of our founding They are opposites if individual rights and liberty are matter the human rights are antimatter.

01:10:58.334 --> 01:11:00.536
It can't exist together Just like in Star Trek, right?

01:11:01.601 --> 01:11:02.001
Can't do it.

01:11:02.482 --> 01:11:13.270
If Brownstone truly wants to influence a post lockdown world and shed light on a path to recovery, recovery by providing a vision for a different way to think about freedom, security and public life.

01:11:15.491 --> 01:11:16.512
As they say, they do.

01:11:16.952 --> 01:11:22.837
A good place to start would be in helping to clarify the difference between human rights and individual liberty instead of further convoluting them.

01:11:23.377 --> 01:11:24.618
Or is that the idea?

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.060
I like Joe a lot.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:30.222
That's the whole thing.

01:11:31.943 --> 01:11:32.423
Is that the idea?

01:11:33.524 --> 01:11:38.649
Wouldn't it be cool if we could get Joe for the weekend in Pittsburgh to come to the Brownstone thing?

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:40.411
Do you imagine that as a little gathering?

01:11:50.368 --> 01:12:01.235
Maybe we should do the first ever live broadcast of GigaOM Biological with an audience on the November 3rd, which would be the Sunday.

01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:04.897
after the Brownstone event.

01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:25.212
The Brownstone event is Friday and Saturday so we could do it on the Sunday and then if Joe comes to town he could be one of the guys on stage with me and then we could broadcast live from some kind of card table on a stage somewhere with a live studio audience of everybody that wanted to come and be at the Brownstone thing and also hang out with us.

01:12:25.272 --> 01:12:26.653
It could be a really great idea.

01:12:26.693 --> 01:12:27.014
I mean if

01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:43.626
if Mark Kulak from Boston were to come into Pittsburgh and I was here and maybe, I don't know, Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson will be here, maybe we'll get lucky and Brett Weinstein will join us on stage for a quick chat and we can get a lot of pop-ins.

01:12:43.706 --> 01:12:50.392
It'd be kind of funny, we could go all afternoon and invite everybody that wants to show up to show up and we'll just bring people on stage.

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:51.332
All I really need is a

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:53.030
is a hard line.

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:57.953
If I can get a hard line at one of these community centers around here, then I'm good to go.

01:12:57.973 --> 01:13:00.574
I mean, we could do that easily.

01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:02.715
Stay tuned.

01:13:02.735 --> 01:13:04.055
I think we should try and plan that.

01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:18.461
Maybe I'll reserve a space because I've got the equipment to do it and I've got a sound, you know, I can take my smaller soundboard and I could bring my, I could actually bring these speakers too.

01:13:18.502 --> 01:13:19.182
I mean, why not?

01:13:19.722 --> 01:13:21.043
We could use the PA and everything.

01:13:21.103 --> 01:13:21.583
It'd be fun.

01:13:22.683 --> 01:13:27.947
Um, yeah, so I think, I think there's a possibility that Joe might come.

01:13:28.007 --> 01:13:28.768
So let's just see.

01:13:28.848 --> 01:13:30.529
He's got, this is like a two hour video.

01:13:30.549 --> 01:13:31.951
We're definitely not going to watch it all.

01:13:33.468 --> 01:13:44.837
This has already been one hour of it, and I do have it on 1.23, so if you want to watch him again and you see him on Rumble, he might speak a little slower, but that's all right.

01:13:44.897 --> 01:13:47.239
I mean, you know, you can listen to it or speed it up, whatever you want.

01:13:47.259 --> 01:13:49.661
I think he's a nice guy, though, and I think he's on to something here.

01:13:49.981 --> 01:13:57.187
It literally saturates the whole of academia, and it helps explain a lot in science and education today from the social constructs of race.

01:13:57.547 --> 01:13:59.909
Social constructs of race, okay?

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.371
Shit you not, race is a social construct.

01:14:04.096 --> 01:14:05.257
Race is a social construct.

01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:09.702
Making this shit up.

01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:11.044
Gender is a social construct.

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:13.567
Is it going?

01:14:13.707 --> 01:14:14.468
I think it might be going.

01:14:19.198 --> 01:14:20.659
So he's got links that are dead.

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:21.579
No longer available.

01:14:21.799 --> 01:14:21.979
Yeah.

01:14:22.059 --> 01:14:22.380
Gender.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.900
Childhood is a social construct.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.041
Evolutionary determinism of sexual preference.

01:14:26.342 --> 01:14:33.865
Social sciences of climate change, eugenics and Malthusian principles of population control to change agents of stem change agents of stem.

01:14:33.885 --> 01:14:38.007
You don't think that this critical theory is infiltrated the science, technology.

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.329
Engineering and math.

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:47.332
Systemic four frames for systemic change in STEM departments.

01:14:49.468 --> 01:14:50.168
I shit you not.

01:14:50.228 --> 01:14:58.413
Inherent whiteness of implicit bias, social determinants of health, of health equity in the mere existence, in the mere existence of critical math and science.

01:14:58.713 --> 01:14:59.993
Why would there be a critical math?

01:15:01.454 --> 01:15:03.115
How could math be racist or white?

01:15:03.195 --> 01:15:03.735
You know what I mean?

01:15:07.277 --> 01:15:09.118
Critical mathematics education for the future.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.481
Education can mean disempowerment or empowerment.

01:15:17.903 --> 01:15:18.363
Crazy, right?

01:15:20.489 --> 01:15:21.413
The shit flies, though.

01:15:21.514 --> 01:15:22.277
The shit flies.

01:15:30.472 --> 01:15:43.921
But anyways, not to mention that the student agency of critical pedagogy in which our own children are being schooled in the revolutionary arts of agents of change disrupting the narrative of America's capitalist white supremacist white supremacist Christian normative oppressor society.

01:15:44.201 --> 01:15:50.685
And that's what that whole pedagogy of the oppressed, which is today's critical pedagogy, today's critical curricula are all.

01:15:52.152 --> 01:16:13.487
Apollo Furies pedagogy of the oppressed which is in the context of the oppressed versus oppressor of the context of the Communist Revolution and part of that is that the students are to become to leave school and go out in society and become agents of change and to disrupt the normative Disrupt the normative take it down man burn it down if you gotta doesn't matter.

01:16:13.507 --> 01:16:16.929
It's all part of the same doctrine Liberty

01:16:18.487 --> 01:16:36.884
Even more alarming about these lockdowns and mandates, from a liberty perspective, are the automated ease in which the grand scheme benchmark of a spontaneous consent, which I mentioned earlier, to mass compliance was achieved in the speed in which the mutual surrender of liberty became the populist general will, forcing the rest of us to no longer be free as well.

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.326
That's just like an illusion of consensus.

01:16:39.406 --> 01:16:43.930
And the thing about it that I would add to Joe's thesis here is that with

01:16:44.795 --> 01:16:59.089
with the illusion that social media is, with the illusion that Twitter is or Facebook is, they can get that appearance of a populist general will forcing the rest of us to no longer be free as well.

01:16:59.189 --> 01:17:07.977
That is much more powerful in a world where everybody's willingly holding a phone that has four or five different social media apps on it.

01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:18.861
And so that's something that he could add to this that would really drive the point home, that we're not even talking about a few newspapers or what's on TV.

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:28.088
We're talking about really intimate programming of social media to create this general will.

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:47.836
In arguing the collectivism of human rights as the cure for the totalitarianism of these lockdowns, the spirit of resistance being put forth by the intellectuals at Brownstone can only serve to further instill the very collectivism upon which they are wholly contingent.

01:17:49.918 --> 01:17:52.321
Even deeper into the populist mindset of our body politic.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:18:07.648
The more you familiarize people with the terminology of human rights, the more you familiarize people with the terminologies of sustainability, the more you familiarize people with the terminology of altruism or, you know, inclusion or, you know, whatever.

01:18:08.508 --> 01:18:17.093
The more you instill that into the normative of the mindset of the body politic, they don't see any problem with it, you know.

01:18:21.926 --> 01:18:28.932
which in the end secures nothing other than, at minimum, the real political force baked into the pandemic response, collectivism.

01:18:31.435 --> 01:18:46.649
Its enslaving cycle of deception lives on to repeat itself over and over and over again, just as it did through the bloodlust of the French, Russian, and Cuban revolutions, which long-term could be far more devastating for the future of mankind than these lockdowns themselves.

01:18:48.177 --> 01:18:56.843
If the real freedom and actual individual rights and liberty is to ever survive at all, we can't allow it to get sucked into that trap again.

01:18:57.563 --> 01:19:01.826
In 1221 I wrote that, at least when I finished it.

01:19:02.206 --> 01:19:05.428
But anyways, that's my whole thing.

01:19:06.689 --> 01:19:07.570
If the medical freedom

01:19:08.297 --> 01:19:25.925
the parallel society that these people in the medical freedom movement, these academics in the medical freedom movement want to establish, then all they're going to do, the best that they can possibly do, is to hit the reset button to start us right back over with the same human rights collectivism.

01:19:25.965 --> 01:19:37.390
The same collectivism, human rights comes right out of the same collectivism that wound up bringing you the tyranny of COVID, the centralized tyranny of COVID.

01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:40.253
I'm going to read this thing that's next to him here.

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:50.481
Jeffrey Tucker is a writer, published entrepreneur, and advocate of anarchical capitalism and Bitcoin.

01:19:51.582 --> 01:19:53.764
I wrote a few things about you, actually.

01:19:53.824 --> 01:19:59.649
The founder and president of the Brownstone Institute is senior economist, columnist for the

01:20:01.113 --> 01:20:07.174
economics columnist for the Epoch Times, author of 10 books, including Liberty or Lockdown.

01:20:08.015 --> 01:20:18.357
He's worked with Ron Paul, the Mises Institute, Lou Rockwell, the American Institute for Economics Research, and you've organized efforts against the COVID-19 restrictions.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:22.158
He's also the Chief Liberty Officer of Liberty.me.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:24.238
I don't know what that is.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:27.479
He's an Advent advisor, Advent scholar with

01:20:28.536 --> 01:20:32.038
Macadam Advent Scholar with a Macadam.

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.701
I assume this is like a translation.

01:20:37.022 --> 01:20:40.964
I mean, like, you know, text to speech to text.

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:42.025
And so it's not right.

01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:43.506
But that's interesting.

01:20:43.546 --> 01:20:49.130
What's an Advent Scholar with a name for that wrong Center of Public Policy and Research Affiliate of?

01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:55.614
Emory University Blockchain Innovation Fund, so it's interesting that he's also a Bitcoin fella.

01:20:56.715 --> 01:21:03.080
I would strongly encourage you to go find this whole video by Joe Marshall on the Liberty Perspective on Rumble and take a listen.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:10.145
I'm gonna move on to the next video that I wanted to watch, which I hinted to in the title as Bob on Joe.

01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:14.862
I think Bob on Joe is very, very, very interesting.

01:21:15.022 --> 01:21:20.264
And so I wanted to watch Bob on Joe, if you don't mind.

01:21:22.365 --> 01:21:24.446
And specifically, I just want to watch the beginning.

01:21:24.526 --> 01:21:36.350
I want to hear how long it takes them to get to, how long does it take them to get to saying something useful?

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:44.771
I like them because they keep people from locking in.

01:21:44.811 --> 01:21:49.854
But one of the things I wanted to make sure I did in this conversation is not interrupt you.

01:21:50.834 --> 01:21:54.036
Because it's very frustrating for me.

01:21:54.096 --> 01:21:57.157
Now, the reason why I want to watch this is very, very simple, right?

01:21:57.338 --> 01:22:07.163
I want to see at what point in time do we get to the stage where we say anything close to something like this, for example.

01:22:07.183 --> 01:22:09.404
Oh, come on, Zach.

01:22:10.908 --> 01:22:12.269
I had it on the right slide.

01:22:12.309 --> 01:22:13.910
I know I had it on the right slide.

01:22:15.391 --> 01:22:26.297
You know, is he going to get anywhere near explaining that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb because of what we don't know about the immune system?

01:22:26.357 --> 01:22:34.782
Is he going to say that transfection was always something we knew and we used and we've used in cell culture and in animals for a long time?

01:22:36.403 --> 01:22:43.890
and it should be criminally negligent to suddenly start calling it an investigative vaccine and give it an EUA, and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:22:44.031 --> 01:22:45.432
All things that he could say.

01:22:47.972 --> 01:22:50.173
I know he's not gonna say them, but he could say.

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:53.053
So how close will he get to saying strict liability?

01:22:53.493 --> 01:23:00.115
How close will he get to saying the Seventh Amendment is being violated by a number of these laws?

01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:07.717
What point is he gonna say something that I'm gonna go, because that'll be a good statement.

01:23:07.777 --> 01:23:09.297
Like, wow, that's awesome.

01:23:09.357 --> 01:23:13.718
And otherwise I'm not gonna put any sound effects in unless he gets something wrong.

01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:17.307
But I don't expect that he'll get something wrong.

01:23:17.387 --> 01:23:20.549
So we'll see where we are here with this.

01:23:20.969 --> 01:23:24.391
But I want to just watch the first few minutes.

01:23:24.451 --> 01:23:31.155
Maybe I will speed it up just a bit because, you know, it always helps when you're watching something to speed it up just a little bit.

01:23:32.196 --> 01:23:33.156
Can I do that right there?

01:23:34.417 --> 01:23:35.177
Is that sped up?

01:23:35.357 --> 01:23:35.557
Yes.

01:23:37.376 --> 01:23:39.678
So then I'll go full screen.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.965
I'm hearing people talk in these what should be long form conversations about very important and nuanced things.

01:23:49.545 --> 01:23:58.272
And I think one of the things that happens is people are very concerned with letting you say things that is going to get them in trouble or get their channel in trouble.

01:23:58.532 --> 01:24:00.634
There's people that are doing a lot of self-censoring.

01:24:01.154 --> 01:24:03.256
And I think they're doing that also when they have these conversations with you.

01:24:03.976 --> 01:24:11.181
because they want to stab... Okay, so here we're talking about a story where people have decided not to publish the interviews with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:13.223
because they're afraid to get a YouTube strike.

01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:17.146
They wouldn't want to lose all their ad revenue like Brett Weinstein did.

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:47.864
And so they're opening with a story about the fake censorship, which I think is really fake censorship, because when you get censored on one platform, but you're allowed to cry about it on all the other platforms, and also on Tucker Carlson, and also on Fox News, then it's not exactly the same thing as getting your videos taken down, or your channel cancelled, and remaining at like 6,000 followers for six years in a row.

01:24:48.991 --> 01:24:54.652
Or in my case, I went up to 14,000 followers on Twitter and then I've stayed there ever since.

01:24:56.313 --> 01:25:01.574
It's a strange world we live in because nothing is spontaneous on social media.

01:25:01.654 --> 01:25:04.075
Nothing is something that, there's nothing going viral.

01:25:05.855 --> 01:25:11.157
They allow things, they make things go viral and they can make anything they want go viral.

01:25:11.657 --> 01:25:15.878
Like the idea that we're going to run out of toilet paper in the next week and a half could go viral.

01:25:19.457 --> 01:25:23.480
Like the idea that a lab leak is being covered up could go viral.

01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:27.423
It's right away that they have problems with you.

01:25:27.724 --> 01:25:30.986
They have problems with some of the positions that a lot of people have problems with.

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:32.367
I was one of those people.

01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:39.253
So when I had heard of you in the past, before I had read your book and before I'd met you, I had no information on you.

01:25:39.653 --> 01:25:40.614
But there was this narrative.

01:25:40.934 --> 01:25:46.599
And this narrative was you were anti-vax, and you believed in pseudoscience, and you were kind of loony.

01:25:47.662 --> 01:25:48.662
I didn't look into it at all.

01:25:48.963 --> 01:25:51.043
I just took it at face value, because that's what everybody had said.

01:25:51.343 --> 01:25:58.826
And in my mind, vaccines have been one of the most important medical advancements in human history, saved countless lives, protected children.

01:25:58.866 --> 01:26:00.787
And I thought very strongly that they were important.

01:26:01.227 --> 01:26:02.628
I didn't have any information on that anyway.

01:26:03.048 --> 01:26:10.731
This was also just a narrative that I got from cursory reading of news articles and not really getting into the subject at all.

01:26:11.812 --> 01:26:12.732
then the pandemic happens.

01:26:13.492 --> 01:26:21.995
And I had quite a few very reasonable, liberal people, rational people, people that I trusted their mind, recommend the real Anthony Fauci, your book.

01:26:22.035 --> 01:26:24.215
And I'm like, Robert Kennedy wrote a book about Anthony Fauci?

01:26:24.235 --> 01:26:24.916
What is this going to be about?

01:26:25.196 --> 01:26:26.316
This is my initial reaction.

01:26:26.596 --> 01:26:34.958
You've got this, what I perceive to be a kind of fringy thinking, you know, almost conspiracy theorist type person that's not based in fact what their argument was.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.559
And he had written a book on Anthony Fauci.

01:26:38.823 --> 01:26:43.144
And I think Robert Malone helped him write that book on Anthony Fauci.

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:52.467
And I think actually they called Davis, David Hone is named Davis Hone in that book.

01:26:52.527 --> 01:27:01.990
I don't know if that's an accident or not, but since Robert Malone used to sleep on Dave Hone's couch, it seems like weird that he wouldn't have got the name right.

01:27:04.673 --> 01:27:13.460
And this was right around the time where I was very concerned with the way things were going, that people were just blindly trusting that there was only one way out of this.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:18.623
That was kind of bothering me, particularly when I had known that so many people had gotten the virus, had been fine.

01:27:19.144 --> 01:27:20.985
So I'm like, well, what's the reality of this?

01:27:21.786 --> 01:27:22.406
So then I read the book.

01:27:22.546 --> 01:27:25.328
So many people that have gotten the virus were fine.

01:27:25.388 --> 01:27:33.675
And so here we are very, very, very nicely reinforcing all the presuppositions of the state.

01:27:34.568 --> 01:27:41.577
that there was a novel virus, that it infected and killed millions of people around the world, that millions more were saved from it.

01:27:41.617 --> 01:27:48.105
Because as he said, you know, vaccines have saved countless lives in the past and they've saved countless lives this time around as well.

01:27:48.545 --> 01:27:49.687
Just harder to count them.

01:27:54.332 --> 01:27:56.234
And I've talked about it multiple times on the podcast.

01:27:56.334 --> 01:28:00.598
But if what you were saying in that book was not true, I do not understand how you are not being sued.

01:28:01.239 --> 01:28:03.701
You would instantly, immediately be sued.

01:28:04.241 --> 01:28:06.604
The book was very successful.

01:28:06.784 --> 01:28:10.707
It sold a lot of copies, but it was mysteriously absent from certain, certain

01:28:11.528 --> 01:28:13.450
Test one, two, test, test, test.

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.291
Seller lists.

01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:24.360
People were not promoting that book at all, but through word of mouth and through the time that we live in, through this time where there was so much uncertainty and people were very confused and also suspicious.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.165
They were suspicious that they're being told a narrative and they were starting to remember that, hey, this has happened in the past.

01:28:30.565 --> 01:28:34.689
These kind of narratives about medications, they have happened in the past, they just never happened.

01:28:35.289 --> 01:28:49.876
I want you to think about how significant it is that these people, this having this conversation in 2024, how much of a sort of... This conversation could have happened in May, 2020, but it didn't.

01:28:50.616 --> 01:28:53.757
It could have been these two guys in May of 2020, but it didn't.

01:28:54.498 --> 01:28:57.499
I was having this conversation with my viewers in May of 2020.

01:28:57.859 --> 01:29:03.902
I was having this conversation with Kevin McCairn and Paul Cottrell.

01:29:04.602 --> 01:29:05.763
during these months of 2020.

01:29:06.483 --> 01:29:12.087
So it's very strange that so far you can't even really place this in the time frame.

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:18.671
We're talking about COVID like it's old history and there's no reason to be precise about what year we're talking about.

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:20.372
This is extraordinary.

01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:24.294
Like the whole country is being convinced that this is the way to do it.

01:29:25.734 --> 01:29:26.254
So I'll read your book.

01:29:26.715 --> 01:29:32.678
And by the end of the book, it was so disturbing that sometimes I had to put it away and just read fiction for a few days.

01:29:33.298 --> 01:29:34.699
I was like, I don't want this in my head right now.

01:29:34.879 --> 01:29:36.220
Because I listen on audio.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.861
And a lot of times, I'm listening in the sauna.

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:39.382
So I'm listening while I'm already getting tortured.

01:29:39.802 --> 01:29:50.828
So it's 185 degrees, and I'm listening to this book that, if it's telling the truth, just about the AIDS crisis, just about the AIDS crisis, just about the use of AZT, just about all of it, all of it.

01:29:51.977 --> 01:30:10.894
that they murdered people and lied about it in order to create the illusion of a pandemic, the illusion of an epidemic, the illusion of a novel spreading pathogen, a retrovirus, a latent virus, a coronavirus, Zika virus.

01:30:12.714 --> 01:30:18.956
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a very big problem we have right now because we are being fooled.

01:30:19.056 --> 01:30:22.778
Remember that slide I started with, with all the pictures there.

01:30:22.818 --> 01:30:24.778
This is just one frame of that, right?

01:30:25.719 --> 01:30:37.303
This is just one frame of that, that slide that I showed in the beginning where, you know, you have all these, how can I get it up?

01:30:38.504 --> 01:30:43.611
there in the right way so that you can see it immediately without having to go through it.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:48.659
I think I have to start with this one and then if I go back one you will see it, right?

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:49.119
I mean, no?

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.583
Oh darn it.

01:30:52.383 --> 01:30:53.743
I can pull them all in like this, right?

01:30:53.783 --> 01:31:00.085
This is just one part of the illusion, one frame of the illusion that we just saw.

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:10.068
And in this frame of the illusion, we have an intellectual dark web central player talking to a Kennedy whose dad worked with

01:31:10.828 --> 01:31:21.296
the dad of another two members of the intellectual dark web, Brett and Eric Weinstein's dad, worked in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:31:21.256 --> 01:31:21.957
's dad.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:29.743
So it's a really interesting sort of my dad, your dad thing that they never talked about on the podcast when Robert F. Kennedy was talking to

01:31:31.064 --> 01:31:40.997
Bret Weinstein for three hours and in fact I was so stupid as to send an email thinking that I was revealing some information to Bobby about how Bret Weinstein might have lied to him.

01:31:47.826 --> 01:31:49.107
I actually sent that mail.

01:31:50.146 --> 01:31:55.650
still believing at some point that this was a good guy and that he was on my team and I was on his team.

01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.011
And it's not that way at all.

01:31:57.071 --> 01:32:08.460
This is an orchestrated theater fueled by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and a bunch of other people with a lot of money and their weaponized piles of money that are in their control.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.784
I was on the wrong thing there.

01:32:13.824 --> 01:32:15.145
Here we go.

01:32:15.706 --> 01:32:16.907
So I had

01:32:17.958 --> 01:32:24.081
I'd seen numerous interviews with you, and you seemed very reasonable and very rational.

01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:27.922
And then I was like, is this possible that this is the guy that's telling the truth?

01:32:28.443 --> 01:32:34.765
Is this possible that everyone that I know that had these strong opinions of you, that most of them at least, were like me?

01:32:35.446 --> 01:32:41.688
They had formed these opinions through a glance at a headline, someone talking about you on a television show.

01:32:42.929 --> 01:32:44.850
And so then we run into each other in Aspen.

01:32:46.809 --> 01:32:47.290
Just random.

01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:49.652
That was the weirdest moment because we were both staring at each other.

01:32:49.672 --> 01:32:50.012
Yeah.

01:32:50.032 --> 01:32:51.334
And then we almost did it like a full 360.

01:32:51.534 --> 01:32:52.475
Yeah.

01:32:53.015 --> 01:32:53.356
Yeah.

01:32:54.637 --> 01:32:54.797
Yeah.

01:32:54.817 --> 01:32:55.538
I noticed you walking.

01:32:55.578 --> 01:32:56.999
I'm like, that's, yeah it is.

01:32:57.813 --> 01:32:58.373
I was like, hey, what's up?

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:02.855
So first of all, I wanted to ask you.

01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:04.716
I saw you in Aspen.

01:33:05.196 --> 01:33:06.337
Oh, great.

01:33:06.957 --> 01:33:07.457
Oh, my God.

01:33:07.477 --> 01:33:12.400
If you could just please explain how you got into these controversial positions in the first place.

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.301
How did you adopt these opinions that people find so controversial?

01:33:15.581 --> 01:33:19.823
Because you started out as an environmental guy, right?

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:22.586
What are the positions?

01:33:22.626 --> 01:33:27.188
You know, I find myself asking kind of Joe kind of questions.

01:33:27.288 --> 01:33:29.109
Joe Marshall would ask the same question.

01:33:29.169 --> 01:33:30.390
What are these positions?

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:36.873
Why don't we talk about what his positions are before we talk about the history of how he came to be in those positions?

01:33:36.953 --> 01:33:42.596
Because if we're not very succinct about those positions, we're not going to learn very much about the guy who wants to be president.

01:33:42.876 --> 01:34:00.082
Yeah, and I'll say one thing about that book is that it is depressing to read and like my wife could not read it, she, she was going to read it out of loyalty to me and I just said you can't do that because it would have depressed her so much, you know, this is not a good advertisement for this book but it's, you know, she.

01:34:00.942 --> 01:34:05.544
There's so much about documentation of corruption and the brutality towards children.

01:34:05.564 --> 01:34:07.565
And I didn't want her reading that.

01:34:07.605 --> 01:34:14.869
Her life is about making people laugh, making people joyful, which is its own contribution to global health.

01:34:15.369 --> 01:34:21.032
People who can make you laugh are doing something for you that is going to probably extend your lifetime.

01:34:22.092 --> 01:34:33.384
You know, I look at Norman Lear, who's like 96 years old or whatever, and he's looked like 50, and Carl Reiner and all these people who, you know, there's something about laughter that makes, you know, that is good for you.

01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:39.831
And so, you know, I admire anybody who took it on to read that book and made it through.

01:34:40.626 --> 01:34:46.110
I was kind of one of the leading environmentalists in the country.

01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.812
It's the previous book.

01:34:47.852 --> 01:34:49.793
They're talking about the Fauci book.

01:34:49.993 --> 01:34:53.576
I went to work for commercial fishermen on the Hudson River in 1983 when I first got sober.

01:34:55.689 --> 01:35:02.155
And I wanted to do something with my life that I felt drawn to, and I'd always been an outdoors person.

01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:06.378
I'd always been a fisherman, and outdoors, wildlife, kayaking, and all that stuff.

01:35:07.139 --> 01:35:09.261
And I went to work for a commercial fisherman on the Hudson River.

01:35:10.142 --> 01:35:11.463
We began suing polluters.

01:35:11.483 --> 01:35:14.165
They purchased a patrol boat and began patrolling the river.

01:35:14.425 --> 01:35:15.106
And we sued.

01:35:15.606 --> 01:35:18.069
While I was there, we sued over 500 polluters.

01:35:19.770 --> 01:35:23.073
We forced polluters to spend almost $5 billion on remediation of the Hudson.

01:35:23.873 --> 01:35:28.437
And today, partially as a result of our work, the Hudson is now the richest waterway in the North Atlantic.

01:35:29.137 --> 01:35:34.241
It produces more biomass per gallon, more pounds of fish per acre than any other waterway in the Atlantic Ocean north of the equator.

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:45.670
The miraculous resurrection, and when I first started working on the Hudson, it caught fire, it was dead water, zero dissolved oxygen for 20 miles north of New York City, 20 miles south of Albany, no life in it.

01:35:46.651 --> 01:35:47.632
It caught fire.

01:35:47.873 --> 01:35:48.473
It was that polluted?

01:35:48.513 --> 01:35:48.974
It caught fire.

01:35:49.014 --> 01:35:54.200
It would turn colors every week, depending on what color they were painting the trucks at the GM plant in Tarrytown.

01:35:54.340 --> 01:36:01.528
You know, it was really my father toured it in 1967 and it was regarded as... I think it's a good exercise to watch it though.

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:05.813
That's why I want to see how long it takes to get to a talking point.

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:12.879
slogan, a succinct elevator pitch message of what I stand for right now.

01:36:12.959 --> 01:36:19.464
And I'm very curious as to when that's going to come out, because I start every stream with what I stand for.

01:36:19.564 --> 01:36:20.165
National joke.

01:36:20.645 --> 01:36:23.627
Well, today it's an international model for ecosystem protection.

01:36:24.548 --> 01:36:25.830
and the miraculous resurrection.

01:36:26.651 --> 01:36:36.902
It's the only waterway in the North Atlantic that still has strong spawning stocks of all of its historical species of migratory fish, of the anadromous fish like striped bass, sturgeon, herring, alewives, blue crab, etc.

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:43.608
The miraculous resurrection of Hudson inspired the creation of new river keepers.

01:36:43.648 --> 01:36:47.471
We copyrighted the name, and we started helping these other groups get started.

01:36:48.191 --> 01:36:50.193
And today it's the biggest water protection group in the world.

01:36:50.213 --> 01:36:51.954
So we have 350 water keepers.

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:53.195
Each one has a patrol boat.

01:36:53.315 --> 01:36:56.698
Each one patrols their local waterway, and they sue polluters.

01:36:56.798 --> 01:36:57.438
And we're in 46 countries.

01:36:57.458 --> 01:36:57.639
So in 2005,

01:37:01.301 --> 01:37:11.409
I was representing a bunch of water keepers all over the United States and in the province of Canada suing coal-burning power plants and cement kilns for discharging mercury.

01:37:11.469 --> 01:37:15.252
So if Joe Rogan and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:15.292 --> 01:37:24.860
are sitting across from each other and they both work out a lot, but they also both take testosterone replacement therapy, are you impressed or not impressed?

01:37:27.162 --> 01:37:33.887
Because I'm a 53-year-old guy, I'm like 6'5", and I'm definitely less than 200 pounds.

01:37:34.827 --> 01:37:37.389
I'm sure if I took testosterone, I could get bigger.

01:37:37.409 --> 01:37:44.394
I'm sure if I just worked out more and spent more time lifting weights, I could get bigger.

01:37:45.455 --> 01:37:52.980
But I don't have much time for that with three kids and a wife and hobbies and a stream to do and consulting to do.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.423
I don't know how these people do it unless

01:37:58.581 --> 01:37:59.681
And then what is it really?

01:37:59.721 --> 01:38:01.002
What does it really represent?

01:38:02.442 --> 01:38:05.222
If Sam Harris is a buff guy, what does that represent?

01:38:05.302 --> 01:38:13.464
If all of these dudes like Huberman and all of them are taking testosterone and creatine on the side, what does it really mean?

01:38:13.644 --> 01:38:19.045
Other than that, they're kind of transhuman like a lot of these people are.

01:38:19.125 --> 01:38:26.467
And supplements is just the slippery slope to mechanical enhancement or augmentation.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:34.367
I mean, if you could bench press three tons with a shirt that you could wear, would you wear the shirt?

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:37.189
Some of these guys would.

01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:41.091
And that's the thing, right?

01:38:41.351 --> 01:38:51.457
That's where we are at this stage, where I think you're seeing an absolute, it's an awful representation of life as an old man.

01:38:53.618 --> 01:38:55.520
It's an awful representation of,

01:38:56.770 --> 01:38:58.010
of aging gracefully.

01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:02.111
And instead, I mean, you want to say that he's raging against the dying of the light.

01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:11.394
I don't, I don't really see testosterone replacement therapy and as, as the same thing, it might be, I could be wrong.

01:39:11.454 --> 01:39:16.415
I'm not a doctor, but for me, I don't have any respect for somebody who works out in that way.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.180
I train.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.061
I don't gain a lot of weight.

01:39:20.382 --> 01:39:20.982
I train.

01:39:21.062 --> 01:39:23.523
I get better at jumping and shooting a basketball.

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:26.605
I'm not interested in becoming a giant muscle man.

01:39:26.685 --> 01:39:29.707
But on the other hand, if I was, I know there are shortcuts to it.

01:39:30.788 --> 01:39:36.151
I know there are ways that I could do it that would be a lot better than just going and lifting weights until I was big enough.

01:39:37.411 --> 01:39:39.953
And there's no question that both of these guys do those things.

01:39:43.413 --> 01:39:48.075
So now the question really becomes, where are we going and who are these people that are leading us there?

01:39:48.135 --> 01:39:53.557
Because they are not the examples to our kids that we imagine them to be because they're fit.

01:39:55.277 --> 01:39:58.559
If our kids don't understand that that fitness is kind of an illusion.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:03.480
I don't know.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:04.841
I mean, maybe I'm being too harsh.

01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:06.542
Two years before nine, 2003.

01:40:08.444 --> 01:40:18.851
The National Academy of Sciences and the FDA had published a report, like a five-year study, that showed that every freshwater fish in America had dangerous levels of mercury in its flesh.

01:40:19.773 --> 01:40:46.299
the cdc simultaneously publish a study that showed that one of every six american women at levels high enough in her core blood in order that her child would have some kind of intellectual deficiency like lost iq et cetera there was a murky coming from the mercury was largely coming from coal-burning power plants it's in the geology in the cold and precipitates out you know when there's rain if u when you burn the coal it's in the you know it's an element so it doesn't degrade

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:53.011
and when the rain comes it falls onto the landscapes and it washes off the landscapes into the rivers and the fish were all contaminated.

01:40:53.051 --> 01:40:57.520
We know that saltwater fish, the big predatory species that have mercury, but the freshwater fish are just as bad.

01:40:58.439 --> 01:41:13.948
And it struck me then that we were living in a science fiction nightmare where my children and the children of every other American could now no longer engage in the seminal, primal activity of American youth that I had grown up with, of your parents taking you to the local fishing hole and then coming home and safely eating the fish.

01:41:13.968 --> 01:41:17.130
You can't do that anymore in the United States of America or anywhere in North America.

01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:23.391
And so we started suing coal plants and cement kilns, which were the primary contributor of mercury.

01:41:23.572 --> 01:41:25.712
And there were a lot of people suing coal plants back then.

01:41:26.352 --> 01:41:31.554
They were suing them for other reasons, for ozone particulates, for acid rain, for carbon, et cetera.

01:41:32.334 --> 01:41:35.315
And we were focused, the water keepers were mainly focused on mercury.

01:41:35.695 --> 01:41:40.976
Yeah, I was going to say that I think in northern Wisconsin, where we used to go fishing, I bet those lakes are still clean.

01:41:40.996 --> 01:41:41.436
I don't know.

01:41:41.536 --> 01:41:44.397
I mean, maybe not, but I don't think they've been

01:41:45.185 --> 01:41:49.348
They've been rained on so much that there's mercury in them, and the fish can't be eaten.

01:41:49.388 --> 01:41:50.669
I mean, we ate them all winter.

01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:54.192
Of course, they could be more polluted now than they were when I was a kid.

01:41:55.353 --> 01:42:01.218
So I was also pushing legislation about mercury, lobbying EPA to reduce it.

01:42:01.898 --> 01:42:03.339
And I was giving lectures all over the place.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:07.163
So these women start showing up at every lecture that I give, public lectures.

01:42:08.043 --> 01:42:09.745
And they would come and sit in the front seat.

01:42:10.732 --> 01:42:11.833
Occupy the front, they'd come early.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:16.796
Occupy the front row, and then afterwards they'd stay late, and they would ask to talk to me.

01:42:17.156 --> 01:42:24.361
And they would say to me, in a very respectful, and by the way, these women all looked kind of similar.

01:42:24.381 --> 01:42:26.122
They were very pulled together.

01:42:26.142 --> 01:42:28.363
They were women in childbearing years.

01:42:29.204 --> 01:42:35.948
As it turns out, they were all the mothers of intellectually disabled children, and they believed that their children had been injured by the vaccines, by mercury in the vaccines.

01:42:36.728 --> 01:42:51.496
So they would say to me in kind of a respectful but vaguely scolding way, if you're really interested in mercury contamination exposures to children, you need to look at the vaccines.

01:42:51.616 --> 01:42:52.836
Now, this is something I didn't want to do.

01:42:53.096 --> 01:42:56.778
Because first of all, I'm not a public health person.

01:42:57.139 --> 01:42:58.399
I wanted to do environmental stuff.

01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:03.562
Second of all, I've been involved since I was a little kid in the whole area of intellectual disabilities.

01:43:04.442 --> 01:43:05.363
It's a wonderful pitch.

01:43:05.403 --> 01:43:06.244
I mean, it really is.

01:43:06.344 --> 01:43:06.765
It's hard.

01:43:06.845 --> 01:43:07.426
It's really, really.

01:43:07.446 --> 01:43:08.547
It's a wonderful pitch.

01:43:19.666 --> 01:43:24.490
And I believed wholeheartedly in it when I worked for him and helped him write that book.

01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:28.253
Ira, who was my godmother, founded Special Olympics in 1969.

01:43:28.353 --> 01:43:32.076
But before it was called Special Olympics, it was called Camp Shriver.

01:43:32.737 --> 01:43:33.977
She lived 10 minutes from my house.

01:43:34.058 --> 01:43:38.901
And I would go over there every weekend to be a hugger and a coach in Special Olympics.

01:43:39.021 --> 01:43:44.045
And then when I was in high school, because this was so much part of my family DNA,

01:43:45.086 --> 01:43:49.688
I spent 200 hours in, let's say, a gun for the retarded, you know, working, doing service.

01:43:50.329 --> 01:43:52.209
So, but it wasn't something I wanted to do with my life.

01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:54.691
Other people in my family were devoting their lives to that.

01:43:54.791 --> 01:43:58.973
My cousin Anthony Shriver started Best Buddies and many other people.

01:43:59.053 --> 01:44:04.055
My family had written a lot of the legislation that protected people and gave rights to people with intellectual disabilities.

01:44:04.675 --> 01:44:07.277
My father had kicked down the door and, you know,

01:44:08.297 --> 01:44:12.460
of Willowbrook, which was a big hospital in Staten Island.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.362
So my family was deeply involved, but it was not what I wanted to do with my life.

01:44:16.363 --> 01:44:21.327
But these women kept continually, I don't want to say harassing me, but they were following me.

01:44:21.407 --> 01:44:22.888
And it was different ones at every speech.

01:44:23.788 --> 01:44:32.655
And I did enough research to show that the public health authorities were saying that these women were crazy.

01:44:33.598 --> 01:44:34.818
But they didn't look crazy to me.

01:44:35.499 --> 01:44:36.499
And they were rational.

01:44:36.819 --> 01:44:37.760
They weren't excitable.

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.020
And they had done their research.

01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:43.062
And I was like, I should be listening to these people.

01:44:43.182 --> 01:44:46.043
Even if they're wrong, somebody needs to listen to them.

01:44:46.603 --> 01:44:49.764
And by the way, I had worked on the Hudson River with commercial fishermen.

01:44:50.544 --> 01:44:56.207
And I'd seen so many times when the scientists were wrong and the commercial fishermen were right about what was happening in the Hudson River.

01:44:57.787 --> 01:44:59.028
One time, I'll just give you an example.

01:44:59.048 --> 01:45:02.149
This commercial fisherman came to me and said,

01:45:02.967 --> 01:45:26.781
all the goldfish are dying uh... up in the wall kill creek and and i went up they said we help us get to that because there's a new sewer plant up there that's discharging chlorine it's hard to kill a goldfish they're one of the most hardy species in the world you can put oil on a goldfish and it won't do anything it won't hurt it and uh... i went up to uh... to the department of environmental conservation they said there are no goldfish in the hudson river well these were people who i'd watch them catch goldfish in the hudson

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:34.712
So anyway, that was just part of the background of my little bit of skepticism about government scientists, that they're not always right, that sometimes you have to listen to people.

01:45:35.768 --> 01:45:37.509
And that human experience is valid.

01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:43.153
And that if a woman tells you something about her child, you should listen.

01:45:43.614 --> 01:45:46.076
And so then one of these women came to my home.

01:45:47.056 --> 01:45:50.399
And she found my home in Hyannisport at a little bungalow.

01:45:50.479 --> 01:45:51.560
And her name was Sarah Bridges.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.641
She was a psychologist from Minnesota.

01:45:53.961 --> 01:45:55.102
And she found my home.

01:45:55.142 --> 01:45:55.743
She came to it.

01:45:55.823 --> 01:45:58.024
She took out of the trunk of her car.

01:45:59.005 --> 01:46:01.187
a pile of scientific studies that was 18 inches thick.

01:46:01.948 --> 01:46:07.874
She put it on my front porch, my stoop, and then she rang the bell, and then she pointed to that pile, and she said, I'm not leaving here until you read those.

01:46:08.594 --> 01:46:18.924
And as it turns out, her son, Porter Bridges, had been a perfectly healthy kid, got a battery of vaccines when he was two, and lost the ability to speak.

01:46:18.965 --> 01:46:21.887
He lost the ability to, he lost his toilet training.

01:46:23.268 --> 01:46:32.633
He began headbanging and engaging in other stereotypical behavior like stimming, hand-flapping, toe-walking, and got an autism diagnosis.

01:46:32.733 --> 01:46:38.616
And the vaccine court had awarded her $20 million for acknowledging that the child had gotten autism from the vaccines.

01:46:39.739 --> 01:46:41.320
And she didn't want it to happen to other kids.

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:45.583
And so I started, I sat down with this pile of studies and I'm used to reading science.

01:46:45.643 --> 01:46:46.664
I'm very comfortable reading it.

01:46:46.784 --> 01:46:48.485
I wanted to be a scientist when I was a little kid.

01:46:49.385 --> 01:46:52.427
And my life, my legal career has been about science.

01:46:52.708 --> 01:46:54.168
It's, you know, virtually all the,

01:46:55.796 --> 01:47:00.257
cases that I've been involved with, hundreds and hundreds of cases, almost all of them involve some scientific controversy.

01:47:01.058 --> 01:47:04.939
And so I'm comfortable with reading science, and I know how to read it critically.

01:47:04.999 --> 01:47:10.961
I know how to look for the flaws in it, and how to attribute weight to various studies, et cetera.

01:47:11.981 --> 01:47:16.823
And I sat down while she was there and I read through the abstracts of these studies one after the other.

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:28.609
And before I was six inches down in that pile, I recognized that there was this huge delta between what the public health agencies were saying, were telling us about vaccine safety and what the actual peer reviewed public science was saying.

01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:32.250
There is a huge delta.

01:47:34.491 --> 01:47:37.453
This is the first kind of statement about

01:47:38.883 --> 01:47:41.023
what he knows and what his message might be.

01:47:41.083 --> 01:47:42.044
Let's listen to it again.

01:47:42.324 --> 01:47:46.664
And, you know, how to weigh the attribute weight to various studies, etc.

01:47:47.625 --> 01:47:52.426
And I sat down while she was there and I read through the abstracts of these studies one after the other.

01:47:52.886 --> 01:48:04.208
And before I was six inches down in that pile, I recognized that there was this huge delta between what the public health agencies were saying, were telling us about vaccine safety and what the actual peer reviewed public science was saying.

01:48:05.348 --> 01:48:10.391
Then I took the next step, which is I started calling people, high-level public officials, and I had access to everyone.

01:48:10.411 --> 01:48:11.472
I called Francis Collins.

01:48:11.532 --> 01:48:15.095
I called Marie McCormick, who ran the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences.

01:48:16.155 --> 01:48:18.577
I called Kathleen Stratton at the National Academy of Sciences.

01:48:19.244 --> 01:48:22.088
who was the chief staffer, and I was asking her about these studies.

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:26.454
And I realized during these conversations that none of these people had read any of the science.

01:48:26.514 --> 01:48:29.138
They were just repeating things that they had been told about the science.

01:48:30.239 --> 01:48:33.964
And they kept saying to me, well, I can't answer that detailed question.

01:48:34.024 --> 01:48:35.166
You need to talk to Paul Offit.

01:48:36.067 --> 01:48:42.614
Well, Paul Offit is a vaccine developer who made $186 million deal with Merck on the rotavirus vaccine.

01:48:43.756 --> 01:48:49.142
And it was odd to me that government regulators were saying, you should talk to somebody in the industry.

01:48:51.084 --> 01:48:54.908
I used to talk to EPA people all the time asking them, what does this provision mean in the permit?

01:48:54.968 --> 01:48:55.789
Why did you put it in there?

01:48:56.826 --> 01:49:07.290
And if they said to me, I don't know, why don't you go talk to the coal industry, or this lobbyist for the coal industry, and he will tell you what we're doing, I would have been very, you know, puzzled and indignant.

01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:14.392
It was weird to me that the top regulators in the country were telling me, go talk to somebody who's an industry insider, because we don't understand.

01:49:14.452 --> 01:49:17.153
I don't know if I would call him an industry insider.

01:49:17.233 --> 01:49:22.275
I mean, is he an industry insider because he's the author of this book?

01:49:24.215 --> 01:49:26.716
Paul Offit worked for the FDA, didn't he?

01:49:26.736 --> 01:49:29.317
He worked for the Vaccine Safety Committee.

01:49:29.337 --> 01:49:35.200
He's written a book titled Vaccines, and it's, like, gigantic.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.861
It's one of the biggest books I have.

01:49:36.901 --> 01:49:39.882
It's as big as the old Catholic Bible that I have on my desk.

01:49:39.962 --> 01:49:40.882
It's gigantic.

01:49:42.683 --> 01:49:48.526
Like, Paul Offit is a authority on vaccines, just like Stanley Plotkin is.

01:49:51.988 --> 01:49:54.589
It's a weird industry insider.

01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.969
Really?

01:49:55.049 --> 01:49:56.050
He's an academic.

01:49:57.570 --> 01:49:59.591
I mean, he's an insider at the FDA.

01:49:59.691 --> 01:50:07.254
He's an insider at the, at the, at the vaccine approval, you know, the whatever they're called ACIP or whatever.

01:50:08.609 --> 01:50:10.970
It's a weird, I don't think that's a good one.

01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:13.551
That's not accurate in my humble opinion.

01:50:14.251 --> 01:50:18.333
Not when this book, the book on vaccines was written by that guy.

01:50:18.353 --> 01:50:24.576
He's more than a vaccine insider and I wouldn't, he's more like a traitor.

01:50:24.596 --> 01:50:28.877
He's more like a biological insider.

01:50:28.917 --> 01:50:32.399
He's like a biosecurity state insider.

01:50:34.226 --> 01:50:42.667
He's not a, I just, I find that a very disingenuous representation of the role of somebody like, like Paul Offit.

01:50:44.462 --> 01:50:45.682
It's weak in the science.

01:50:46.023 --> 01:50:48.483
And when I talked to him, I caught him in a lie.

01:50:49.384 --> 01:50:54.305
And both of us knew that he was lying, and that both of us recognized that he was lying.

01:50:55.266 --> 01:50:56.966
And at that point, I was like- What was the lie?

01:50:57.847 --> 01:50:59.107
Well, I asked him this question.

01:50:59.207 --> 01:51:09.351
I said, why is it that CDC and every state regulator recommends that pregnant women do not eat tuna fish?

01:51:10.185 --> 01:51:21.913
to avoid the mercury, but that CDC is recommending mercury-containing flu shots with huge bolus doses of mercury, I mean massive doses, to pregnant women in every trimester of pregnancy.

01:51:22.994 --> 01:51:29.639
And he said to me, he said, well, Bobby, in this kind of patronizing way, and by the way, when I talked to Paul Offit,

01:51:30.478 --> 01:51:35.501
He started the conversation, he was very enthusiastic, and he said, you know, your father was my hero.

01:51:35.521 --> 01:51:39.064
The reason I got into public service and public health was because I was inspired by your father.

01:51:39.664 --> 01:51:43.386
So that kind of, you know, I'm susceptible, like anybody else, to kind of that kind of flattery.

01:51:43.426 --> 01:51:44.967
So I was inclined to like the guy.

01:51:45.828 --> 01:51:54.333
But then he said, I asked him about how can you be, you know, telling people not to eat, women not to eat tuna fish, giving them a flu shot that has, you know, these huge doses.

01:51:55.214 --> 01:51:58.296
And he said, well, Bobby, there are, there's two kinds of mercury.

01:51:58.316 --> 01:52:00.037
There's a good mercury and there's a bad mercury.

01:52:00.931 --> 01:52:04.494
And the minute he said, and I knew there's a different kind of mercury in the vaccines.

01:52:04.734 --> 01:52:06.776
It's ethylmercury in the vaccines and methylmercury in the fish.

01:52:08.037 --> 01:52:10.438
And you can imagine, I know a lot about mercury.

01:52:10.559 --> 01:52:11.339
I've been suing people.

01:52:11.359 --> 01:52:14.141
When you sue somebody, you get a PhD in that.

01:52:14.181 --> 01:52:15.462
You know more than anybody in the world.

01:52:15.502 --> 01:52:17.064
You have to or you're not going to win your lawsuit.

01:52:17.084 --> 01:52:18.465
So I knew a lot about mercury.

01:52:18.485 --> 01:52:24.690
And I knew that his argument was not with me, but it was with the periodic tables, because there's no such thing as a good mercury.

01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:32.969
And I also knew the history of why he was saying that because, you know, mercury was added to vaccines in a form called dimerosol in 1932.

01:52:34.702 --> 01:52:40.085
And Eli Lilly, which was the manufacturer, was because people knew then that mercury was horrendously neurotoxic.

01:52:40.125 --> 01:52:42.327
Mercury is 1,000 times more neurotoxic than lead.

01:52:43.167 --> 01:52:44.868
You would never shoot lead into your baby.

01:52:44.948 --> 01:52:46.549
Why was thermosol introduced in the United States?

01:52:46.649 --> 01:52:49.571
It was allegedly introduced as a preservative.

01:52:49.611 --> 01:52:55.295
But it doesn't kill streptococcus or any of the other contaminants you would be worried about.

01:52:55.315 --> 01:52:56.495
In fact, it kills brain cells.

01:52:57.316 --> 01:53:00.458
At 130 of the dose that it takes to kill streptococcus or staphylococcus.

01:53:02.839 --> 01:53:03.900
It wasn't a good preservative.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.023
What NIH admitted to me in 2016, the real reason was there as an adjuvant.

01:53:08.904 --> 01:53:16.530
An adjuvant is a toxic material that they add to dead virus vaccines to amplify the immune response.

01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:17.491
So your body

01:53:19.793 --> 01:53:23.414
This is kind of getting into the weeds, but a live virus vaccine, if they give it to you, it can spread the disease.

01:53:23.474 --> 01:53:24.794
It can mutate in you and spread the disease.

01:53:25.674 --> 01:53:30.116
That's why most of the polio today, 70% of the polio today is vaccine polio that came from the vaccines.

01:53:31.636 --> 01:53:34.577
So the regulators expressed a preference for dead virus vaccines.

01:53:35.297 --> 01:53:40.481
A dead virus vaccine, however, will not produce a durable or robust immune response enough to get a license.

01:53:40.501 --> 01:53:49.026
The way you get a license for a vaccine is showing that you got an antibody response for a certain amount of time and that it's a strong antibody response, but the dead virus vaccine won't produce that.

01:53:49.567 --> 01:53:54.290
But vaccinologists figured out that if you add something horrendously toxic to the vaccine,

01:53:55.185 --> 01:54:09.343
that your body confuses that toxic product, you add it with the dead antigen, which is the viral particle, your body confuses that toxin with the viral particle and gets frightened and mounts this huge, humongous immune response.

01:54:10.084 --> 01:54:11.365
The next time it sees that virus,

01:54:12.486 --> 01:54:13.447
the immune response is there.

01:54:13.967 --> 01:54:17.469
So at that point, vaccinologists went around searching around the world to find the most.

01:54:17.649 --> 01:54:21.772
See, it's not next time the virus is there, the immune response is there.

01:54:21.832 --> 01:54:25.254
That's already a poor, it's a poor characterization.

01:54:25.354 --> 01:54:31.158
So what he should have said was gone on with the previous analogy.

01:54:31.218 --> 01:54:41.164
He said that dead virus vaccines don't produce a robust antibody response and a robust antibody response is the only observation required

01:54:42.711 --> 01:54:44.993
to claim that you have an effective vaccine.

01:54:45.053 --> 01:54:53.799
And so they added toxic adjuvants to these recombinant proteins as a way of increasing the seroprevalence that resulted.

01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.982
It has nothing to do with the next time you see the virus.

01:54:58.022 --> 01:55:09.390
It only has to do with whether or not they can measure a detectable seroprevalence in the vast majority of people exposed to this combination of substances injected intramuscularly to augment the immune system.

01:55:10.971 --> 01:55:12.132
It could be said better.

01:55:14.113 --> 01:55:16.255
and in some cases, more accurately.

01:55:17.216 --> 01:55:19.578
There's horrendously toxic materials to add to vaccines.

01:55:20.439 --> 01:55:25.383
And there's a mantra in vaccinology that the more toxic the adjuvant, the more robust the immune.

01:55:25.403 --> 01:55:28.586
But I want to stress something to Girl Rocks in chat.

01:55:28.666 --> 01:55:29.887
Hello, good to see you.

01:55:31.068 --> 01:55:33.150
They could be having this conversation in 2020.

01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:36.713
They could have had this conversation before the pandemic.

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:41.794
Because that's supposedly where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:43.315
was before the pandemic.

01:55:43.355 --> 01:55:45.876
He knew all of this before the pandemic.

01:55:47.538 --> 01:55:50.260
CHD knew all of this before the pandemic.

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:52.001
That's why they made the movie Vaxxed.

01:55:58.854 --> 01:56:05.780
And so this is very important to see that this conversation could have and should have happened in 2020.

01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:16.409
And it didn't, except for in fringe places like on my broadcast, on my bicycle, or in arguments that I was having with people on Twitter and other places in 2020.

01:56:19.284 --> 01:56:44.640
And there's a really, it's a really gaping hole in our little history here that it wasn't until October of 2020 that this guy spoke out against lockdowns in the street of Germany and started to sell that idea that maybe it's a bioweapon, that maybe it's a lab leak, that maybe the virus was definitely real, but we just shouldn't surrender to their totalitarian response to it.

01:56:45.161 --> 01:56:46.802
It's a very subtle,

01:56:49.343 --> 01:56:51.305
It's a very subtle shepherding of our thoughts.

01:56:51.625 --> 01:56:52.026
Response.

01:56:52.406 --> 01:56:55.790
And so that's why toxicologists and vaccinologists don't get along with each other.

01:56:55.810 --> 01:57:02.537
Because the toxicologists would say to the vaccinologists, well, I understand it gave you immune response, but then what is the fate of that in your body?

01:57:03.118 --> 01:57:03.719
Where is it going?

01:57:03.759 --> 01:57:04.640
Is it being excreted?

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.901
Is it being lodged in the brain?

01:57:06.161 --> 01:57:07.643
Is it penetrating the blood brain barrier?

01:57:08.684 --> 01:57:11.407
And the vaccinologist could not answer those questions and did not want to.

01:57:11.867 --> 01:57:17.392
So they basically moved the toxicologists out of these, you know, out of the vaccine, the whole vaccine universe.

01:57:18.233 --> 01:57:29.543
Anyway, so when it was added in 1932, the industry said, Eli Lilly said, well, the reason, because everybody was saying, how can you put mercury into a child?

01:57:30.084 --> 01:57:30.604
Who would do that?

01:57:31.705 --> 01:57:33.046
And they said, well, it's a different kind of mercury.

01:57:33.066 --> 01:57:36.668
It's ethylmercury, and the ethylmercury is excreted very quickly, so it won't stay in your body.

01:57:37.428 --> 01:57:39.990
They had no science to say that, but that's what they were saying for years.

01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:52.877
And then, in 2003, a CDC scientist called Picciaro did a study where he gave tuna sandwiches that were mercury-contaminated to children, and then measured their blood.

01:57:52.977 --> 01:57:55.298
And the mercury from the tuna sandwich was there.

01:57:55.885 --> 01:57:59.007
a half-life 64 days later, so it was still there 64 days.

01:57:59.847 --> 01:58:05.170
And he injected the children with mercury from a vaccine, and that mercury disappeared from their blood within a week.

01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.971
And this kind of confirmed

01:58:09.266 --> 01:58:12.990
What Eli Lilly had said in 1932, oh, it disappears really quickly from the body.

01:58:13.871 --> 01:58:16.434
And that was published, I believe, in the Lanceter Pediatrics.

01:58:16.474 --> 01:58:21.819
But immediately... A lot of times the adjuvant is actually conjugated to the protein.

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.523
So they put the toxin on the protein using a chemical bond.

01:58:26.244 --> 01:58:37.436
And so then when the antigen-presenting cell takes in the toxin to dispose of it or whatever, they also antigenically process the protein that's attached to it.

01:58:37.476 --> 01:58:49.148
So honestly, Girl Rocks, it's not very clear how the adjuvant works together with the recombinant protein, but generally speaking,

01:58:50.438 --> 01:59:01.464
The narrative that they tell you is that the detection of antibodies are antibody specific for that protein associated with the pathogen rather than the toxin because

01:59:02.205 --> 01:59:07.106
The toxin, the toxic adjuvant is going to be a small chemical compound, maybe a heavy metal.

01:59:07.686 --> 01:59:18.328
And so it's very unlikely that you'll develop an autoimmune, or sorry, an antibody response to that chemical, but rather to what it's conjugated to.

01:59:18.408 --> 01:59:30.670
So the HibTiter injection, for example, is a protein from the Hib,

01:59:31.696 --> 01:59:36.821
Hib toxin, and then I think it's conjugated to some heavy metal or something like that.

01:59:36.861 --> 01:59:48.674
I'd have to look it up again, but it's definitely one of these tagged or conjugated, I guess that's the best word, conjugated molecules where they conjugate the protein with some kind of toxin that's actually the adjuvant.

01:59:49.294 --> 01:59:51.477
And so that also keeps the localization correct.

01:59:53.564 --> 02:00:11.276
I'm just trying to relay the cartoon version of what they say happens and try to help you understand why it is possible that some of the seroprevalence that gets produced is specific for the toxin, rather, sorry, specific for the protein that they attach the toxin to.

02:00:11.737 --> 02:00:21.664
That still doesn't mean that those antibodies are gonna protect you from the bacteria or from the whatever pathogen they say that that recombinant protein is derived from.

02:00:22.432 --> 02:00:34.799
because the recombinant protein and how it's derived and how it's produced might fold it differently and therefore create a whole different epitope structure that'll have nothing to do with the original natural protein, whatever it's derived from.

02:00:35.459 --> 02:00:36.940
So that's a whole nother ball of wax.

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:38.401
But anyway, I just wanted to say that.

02:00:38.801 --> 02:00:46.265
The journal began getting letters from people, including this famous scientist called Dr. Boyd Haley, who is the head of, he's the chair of that chemistry department of the University of Kentucky.

02:00:47.246 --> 02:00:49.327
And he said, but what happened to the mercury?

02:00:49.347 --> 02:00:51.248
Because Piggier couldn't find it in the children's

02:00:52.248 --> 02:00:55.430
urine or in their feces or in their hair or sweat or nails.

02:00:55.651 --> 02:00:56.291
So where is it?

02:00:57.372 --> 02:01:00.054
And then NIH actually then commissioned a study.

02:01:00.914 --> 02:01:03.336
And they, because they, at that point, they were really trying to figure out.

02:01:03.876 --> 02:01:15.144
Putting mercury and these other things in as preservatives could also keep them out of the regulatory structure where they are required for safety testing and that kind of thing.

02:01:15.184 --> 02:01:17.126
I could be wrong, but that could be part of the

02:01:17.907 --> 02:01:21.791
the thing they're trying to do there with that language.

02:01:21.911 --> 02:01:22.952
You know, whether this was dangerous.

02:01:23.813 --> 02:01:30.639
And they commissioned a very famous scientist called Thomas Burbacker out of the University of Washington, Seattle, to do a study with monkeys, with macaques.

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.342
And he did the same study, Pichiera did.

02:01:33.903 --> 02:01:37.026
But he did something you can't do with children, which he then killed the monkeys.

02:01:37.785 --> 02:01:41.948
And then he looked for the mercury, and what he found was the mercury, yes, it left their blood immediately.

02:01:42.288 --> 02:01:45.591
The ethylmercury from the vaccines was gone from their blood in a week.

02:01:46.491 --> 02:01:50.134
Methylmercury from the tuna fish was there a month later, two months later.

02:01:51.595 --> 02:01:54.197
And he sacrificed the monkeys and did postmortems.

02:01:54.998 --> 02:01:56.779
He found that the mercury had not left their body.

02:01:57.972 --> 02:02:04.395
Instead, the reason it was disappearing from their blood is because ethylmercury causes the blood-brain barrier much easier than methylmercury.

02:02:05.016 --> 02:02:10.378
The ethylmercury from the vaccines was going directly to the brains of these animals, and it was lodging there and causing severe inflammation.

02:02:11.439 --> 02:02:14.240
And we now know it's there 20 years later.

02:02:15.001 --> 02:02:23.445
So when I'm on the phone with Burba and I said, he said, the ethylmercury is excreted quickly.

02:02:23.465 --> 02:02:24.366
And I said, how do you know that?

02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:27.167
And he said, because of the Picciaro study.

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.902
because a study by Pigiero found that it was excreted quick in a week.

02:02:32.802 --> 02:02:37.224
And I said, but you're familiar with the Burbacher study that showed that it's gone to the brain.

02:02:38.324 --> 02:02:39.825
And there was dead silence on the phone.

02:02:40.945 --> 02:02:43.546
And then he said to me, he kind of hemmed and hawed and said, well, you're right.

02:02:44.467 --> 02:02:45.167
It's not that study.

02:02:45.187 --> 02:02:46.528
It's just a whole mosaic of studies.

02:02:46.768 --> 02:02:48.108
And I said, can you cite any for me?

02:02:48.809 --> 02:02:49.929
And he said, I'll send them to you.

02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.609
And he never did.

02:02:50.649 --> 02:02:51.650
That's the last I heard from him.

02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:54.871
So at that point, I knew there was something wrong.

02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:56.532
And then somebody handed me a transcript.

02:02:57.552 --> 02:03:01.313
of a secret meeting that took place in 1999.

02:03:01.413 --> 02:03:04.553
I think it was 1999.

02:03:04.634 --> 02:03:06.214
It might have been 2000.

02:03:06.854 --> 02:03:08.834
But it's called the Simpsonwood meeting.

02:03:09.675 --> 02:03:16.556
And what happened is, in the midnight, I mean, the history is that in 1986, well, I'll go back a little further.

02:03:16.696 --> 02:03:20.337
In 1979, 1980, when I was a kid, I only had three vaccines.

02:03:20.957 --> 02:03:22.477
My kids got 72 vaccines.

02:03:22.837 --> 02:03:24.858
That's what you need now to get through school, 72 doses of 16 vaccines.

02:03:26.897 --> 02:03:29.338
So and it started changing in the 80s and 90s.

02:03:29.378 --> 02:03:35.159
But in 1979, they they brought out a vaccine called the diphtheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine.

02:03:35.899 --> 02:03:37.239
And that vaccine was very dangerous.

02:03:37.359 --> 02:03:40.860
And it was killing one out of killing or giving severe brain damage to one in 300 kids.

02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:42.601
And it was pulled in the United States.

02:03:43.621 --> 02:03:44.381
It was pulled in Europe.

02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:47.082
But Bill Gates still gives 161 million African children every year.

02:03:48.789 --> 02:04:12.169
the same vaccine vaccine and the south asian kids i'll tell you you know we now know what that does because the danish government to the study uh... called morganson in twenty seventeen that show that african kids and that's that's uh... polish in a journal called e-bio pharma and it was done by the leading duties of of of african faxology all of them pro-vaccine people like peter a a b whose name is very famous sigrid morgan said a bunch of others

02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:14.792
And they went to Africa and looked at that.

02:04:14.812 --> 02:04:15.853
They had 30 years of data.

02:04:16.694 --> 02:04:23.700
And Gates had gone to the Danish government and said, you know, give us money because we've saved millions of lives with this vaccine in Africa.

02:04:24.762 --> 02:04:26.703
And the Danish government said, can you show us the data?

02:04:27.444 --> 02:04:27.845
And he couldn't.

02:04:28.365 --> 02:04:31.888
So they went to Guinea-Bissau, which is a country in the west of Africa.

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:39.794
And Guinea-Bissau, the Danes for 30 years had been paying for these very advanced health clinics, local health clinics all over Guinea-Bissau.

02:04:39.834 --> 02:04:45.541
He's now citing Christine Stibel, Ben's work that we covered on this broadcast in 2021, in the beginning of 2021, over and over and over again.

02:04:49.005 --> 02:04:54.227
as an example for how vaccines aren't doing what they say they were doing.

02:04:54.267 --> 02:05:03.631
We still didn't understand it all, but we definitely understood that all-cause mortality increased by a factor of five in those kids that took some of these shots versus the kids that didn't get them.

02:05:04.672 --> 02:05:09.334
And the clinics were weighing every child at three months and every child at six months.

02:05:10.445 --> 02:05:19.188
And in the 80s or 90s, they began giving the DTP vaccine at the first visit, a three-month visit.

02:05:19.208 --> 02:05:26.851
But if they didn't hit the child exactly, if they didn't have full 90 days of age, if they were 89 days, they wouldn't give it to them at the six-month visit.

02:05:27.711 --> 02:05:34.633
As it turns out, they had 30 years of data where half the kids were vaccinated and half the kids were not, between two months and five months of age.

02:05:35.374 --> 02:05:36.834
So it was a perfect natural experiment.

02:05:37.455 --> 02:05:39.316
And they went in there, and they looked at it.

02:05:39.396 --> 02:05:49.263
They looked at 30 years of data, and they found that girls who got that vaccine, the DTP vaccine, were 10 times more likely to die.

02:05:50.704 --> 02:05:54.566
I think it was only five, but it could have been 10.

02:05:54.686 --> 02:05:55.467
Three months, then girls.

02:05:55.707 --> 02:05:56.628
Then children who did not.

02:05:57.748 --> 02:06:00.551
And they weren't dying of diphtheria, deadness, and pertussis.

02:06:00.591 --> 02:06:02.512
They were protected against those by the vaccine.

02:06:03.273 --> 02:06:03.814
They were dying.

02:06:03.834 --> 02:06:06.336
They were protected by those against the vaccine.

02:06:06.376 --> 02:06:08.298
And that's not technically true.

02:06:08.538 --> 02:06:10.680
See, that's the problem that we have here.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:23.972
And the problem that I have with Christine Stibel's, Ben's work is that it's used as a way of saying that, well, they didn't get diphtheria, pertussis, and whatever else is in there, but they got other things.

02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:38.872
And for me, the prevalence of diphtheria and other things in these countries needs to be figured in because if nobody else has diphtheria, or the people that aren't vaccinated aren't getting diphtheria, then you can't make the same statement that he just made there.

02:06:38.912 --> 02:06:39.773
He just told you.

02:06:40.598 --> 02:06:44.321
He just told you that there were unvaccinated kids and vaccinated kids.

02:06:44.802 --> 02:06:49.766
So did any of those vaccinated kids get diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus?

02:06:50.507 --> 02:06:55.772
Because if they didn't, that's not really proof of anything in the injected group.

02:06:55.812 --> 02:06:57.993
Yet he stated it as clear as day.

02:06:58.574 --> 02:07:01.076
They were protected by the vaccines.

02:07:01.817 --> 02:07:05.160
And that is not a logical assumption here.

02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:07.162
And yet he does that a lot.

02:07:08.055 --> 02:07:15.586
And it's reinforcing the presuppositions that Joe has been working under, which is that vaccines have saved millions of lives.

02:07:15.626 --> 02:07:17.048
We've got to roll that back.

02:07:18.226 --> 02:07:22.727
At some point we got to roll that assumption back and revisit it because that's not the case.

02:07:22.787 --> 02:07:36.089
And definitely not if kids weren't already dying from pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus all the time, that injecting them to protect them from something they're not going to get anyway is pretty extraordinary.

02:07:36.569 --> 02:07:38.310
And yet he says they were protected.

02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:39.330
Listen carefully.

02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:44.891
Vaccine had, um, had, uh, 10 times over 10 times more likely to die.

02:07:45.842 --> 02:07:48.164
over the next three months than children who did not.

02:07:49.245 --> 02:07:52.068
And they weren't dying of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.

02:07:52.088 --> 02:07:54.010
They were protected against those by the vaccine.

02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:59.055
They were dying of anemia, and bilharzia, and malaria, and pulmonary disease.

02:07:59.095 --> 02:08:00.897
But mainly, they were dying of pneumonia.

02:08:01.998 --> 02:08:04.381
And what the researchers said is- Of pneumonia.

02:08:05.427 --> 02:08:16.491
vulnerability to bacterial infection at the barrier of the lungs due to a adjuvant exposure, a toxin exposure, a heavy metal exposure.

02:08:19.692 --> 02:08:33.036
So the propensity for weakening the immune system and having one of the first things that's happening is an imbalance in that bacterial presence in your lungs and a infection of sorts, a bacterial pneumonia,

02:08:35.137 --> 02:08:36.298
I can see the theme here.

02:08:37.298 --> 02:08:41.580
The old people in Italy were vaccinated two years in a row for pneumonia and flu.

02:08:42.761 --> 02:08:43.541
They were vulnerable.

02:08:45.222 --> 02:08:47.803
Flu vaccines could have created vulnerabilities.

02:08:49.209 --> 02:08:58.957
vulnerabilities to just viral, sorry, just bacterial pneumonia, not viral pneumonia, but bacterial pneumonia due to a weakened immune system.

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:15.832
And that raising that up and then simultaneously rolling out a test that was not indicative of what they said it was, but indicative of a background signal that was being misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen that needed novel treatments.

02:09:18.052 --> 02:09:26.976
that the vaccine is almost certainly killing more children than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis prior to the vaccine because it was protecting them against the target illnesses, but it had ruined their immune systems.

02:09:27.216 --> 02:09:30.097
So they could not defend themselves against these other minor infections.

02:09:30.317 --> 02:09:35.039
And nobody noticed for 30 years that it was the vaccinated children who were disproportionately dying.

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.861
And that's the problem with not doing real placebo-controlled trials.

02:09:38.881 --> 02:09:42.442
None of the vaccines are ever subjected to true placebo-controlled trials.

02:09:42.462 --> 02:09:45.484
It's the only medical product that is exempt from that prior to licensure.

02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:53.116
Anyway, what happened in the DDP vaccine, when it was pulled in this country, it was pulled because so many people were suing the drug companies.

02:09:54.037 --> 02:09:56.639
Why is, which is now Pfizer, was the primary manufacturer.

02:09:56.659 --> 02:10:05.628
They went to the Reagan administration in 1986 and they said, you need to give us full immunity from liability for all vaccines or we're going to get out of the business.

02:10:06.744 --> 02:10:13.167
And Reagan actually said to them, they said, we're losing $20 in downstream liability for every dollar we're making in profits.

02:10:14.288 --> 02:10:16.489
And Reagan said to them, well, why don't you make the vaccine safe?

02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:20.471
And they said, because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

02:10:20.932 --> 02:10:21.832
That's the phrase they use.

02:10:21.872 --> 02:10:23.633
And that phrase is in the statute.

02:10:24.534 --> 02:10:28.436
And it's also in the Brusewitz case, which is the Supreme Court decision upholding that statute.

02:10:29.449 --> 02:10:37.714
And so anybody who tells you vaccines are safe and effective, the industry itself got immunity from liability by convincing the president and Congress that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

02:10:38.395 --> 02:10:46.059
Now, the argument against that would obviously be they've prevented disease that would have killed untold numbers of children, right?

02:10:46.099 --> 02:10:47.540
That would be the argument they would use against that.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:47.960
Exactly.

02:10:48.021 --> 02:10:50.442
And that vaccine injuries are very rare.

02:10:50.502 --> 02:10:52.203
That is the argument that is used against them.

02:10:52.924 --> 02:10:58.067
And both of those arguments in CDC's own studies have been severely challenged.

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:02.124
Oh, the CDC did a study in 2010 called Lazarus.

02:11:03.065 --> 02:11:08.913
And it was Harvard scientists who looked at one of the HMOs, the Harvard Pilgrim HMO, which is one of the top HMOs.

02:11:10.955 --> 02:11:12.557
It's actually, I think, the ninth biggest HMO.

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:16.763
And they were testing a machine counting system that could do

02:11:17.688 --> 02:11:28.271
a cluster analysis because right now the only way, the only vaccine injury surveillance system they have, it doesn't work, it's fewer than 1 in 100 vaccine injuries are ever reported because it's voluntary.

02:11:28.391 --> 02:11:31.652
And this is what you can find support for this in the Lazarus study.

02:11:31.712 --> 02:11:36.113
Lazarus actually looked and said, how many injuries are actually happening, how many are reported?

02:11:36.193 --> 02:11:38.434
And they said fewer than 1 in 100 are ever reported.

02:11:40.094 --> 02:11:43.976
And they developed a system of machine counting so that it doesn't rely on voluntary reporting.

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:50.698
What you do is you look at all the vaccine records or population and all of the medical claims, the subsequent medical claims.

02:11:51.699 --> 02:11:52.579
And you do machine counting.

02:11:52.599 --> 02:11:53.579
You do a cluster analysis.

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.240
And you it's very, very accurate.

02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:01.102
And they found CDC at that time was saying one out of a million people were being injured by the vaccine.

02:12:01.122 --> 02:12:01.723
They found one in 37.

02:12:03.763 --> 02:12:12.269
And so, and CDC had asked this team to design a machine counting system because their system was so heavily criticized by everybody.

02:12:12.309 --> 02:12:15.791
David Kessler, who was a Surgeon General, everybody was saying it's terrible, it doesn't work.

02:12:16.711 --> 02:12:20.214
And Congress had told them you have to accurately count vaccine injuries and they weren't doing it.

02:12:20.981 --> 02:12:25.742
But when they did it, when they actually looked, they found that it's not one in a million.

02:12:25.822 --> 02:12:28.683
One in 37 kids had potential vaccine claims.

02:12:28.723 --> 02:12:32.623
Now, you can't tell whether any of those claims were actually from the vaccine, because it's a machine counting.

02:12:32.643 --> 02:12:33.323
So it's statistical.

02:12:33.363 --> 02:12:39.025
But you can say that the number of injuries is much higher than anybody was admitting.

02:12:40.225 --> 02:12:50.907
And then in the year 2000, CDC did a study with Johns Hopkins called Geyer, because there was this emerging claim that vaccines had saved tens of millions of lives around the world.

02:12:51.983 --> 02:12:55.685
I'm not going to tell you that they don't, because nobody should trust my word on this.

02:12:56.145 --> 02:12:57.226
What I say is irrelevant.

02:12:57.546 --> 02:12:58.906
What is relevant is the science.

02:12:59.827 --> 02:13:03.789
And this is the principal effort by CDC to actually verify that claim.

02:13:04.684 --> 02:13:09.506
and what the Geyer study, and they looked at all the history of each vaccine and health claims.

02:13:09.626 --> 02:13:19.049
And what they were trying to say is there was this huge decline in mortality from infectious disease that took place in the 20th century.

02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:23.310
An 80% drop in deaths from infectious disease.

02:13:24.371 --> 02:13:25.451
And what caused that?

02:13:25.811 --> 02:13:26.631
Was it vaccines?

02:13:27.632 --> 02:13:28.832
And what they said is no.

02:13:29.072 --> 02:13:32.213
It had very little, almost nothing to do with vaccines.

02:13:32.253 --> 02:13:33.874
The real drop happened because

02:13:34.874 --> 02:13:49.877
of really engineering solutions, refrigerators, you could store food, transportation systems that would get oranges up from Florida, et cetera, roads, better housing, sanitation, the invention of chlorine, sewage treatment, but mainly nutrition.

02:13:49.917 --> 02:13:52.437
Nutrition is absolutely critical to building immune systems.

02:13:52.577 --> 02:13:55.878
And so- So interesting, good statement, good statement.

02:13:55.938 --> 02:14:00.439
What does the, what does Children's Health Defense want

02:14:01.994 --> 02:14:06.378
I guess they want public demands a safe COVID-19 vaccine.

02:14:06.498 --> 02:14:06.998
No, we don't.

02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:13.684
What many really want is a safe vaccination program for everyone.

02:14:13.704 --> 02:14:19.209
No, I think we should tell people that it's a criminal enterprise and it's probably biologically debunk.

02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:23.072
It's a biologically bunk idea.

02:14:23.092 --> 02:14:27.576
I don't think that was the right word of debunk, but it is a bunk idea.

02:14:29.181 --> 02:14:31.422
The desire is common to all of us.

02:14:31.842 --> 02:14:32.483
All of us.

02:14:32.603 --> 02:14:34.324
It's common to all of us.

02:14:34.424 --> 02:14:35.464
It's a community.

02:14:35.624 --> 02:14:38.806
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a collective.

02:14:38.866 --> 02:14:40.207
It's common to all of us.

02:14:40.287 --> 02:14:44.609
Those who are pro-vaccine and those who have voiced concerns.

02:14:50.692 --> 02:14:52.353
It's a collectivist idea.

02:14:52.493 --> 02:14:57.416
Just like Joe pointed out the brownstone who retweets and publishes cross posts.

02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.261
It's a collectivist idea.

02:15:00.301 --> 02:15:01.562
It's not individualism.

02:15:01.622 --> 02:15:05.606
It's not the individualist ideal of America.

02:15:05.726 --> 02:15:06.787
It is collectivism.

02:15:07.767 --> 02:15:11.831
We can work together to make a safer vaccine program for everyone.

02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:25.462
We at CHD have been looking at the vaccine safety issue for years, and there are legitimate scientific concerns that need to be addressed, nevermind the criminal enterprise that it is.

02:15:29.645 --> 02:15:32.747
It is time for medicine and public health to address them.

02:15:32.847 --> 02:15:33.907
So see, that's it.

02:15:33.927 --> 02:15:35.288
That's really it.

02:15:36.248 --> 02:15:36.809
That's really it.

02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:56.976
It's a criminal enterprise and you don't really have much to say at that stage if you see it for what it is.

02:15:57.216 --> 02:15:58.877
Thanks for that slide deck.

02:16:00.859 --> 02:16:01.499
That was handy.

02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:05.442
It's going to be scary to look at that after the show.

02:16:06.693 --> 02:16:13.901
What was really killing these children was malnutrition, and it was the infectious disease that was kind of knocking them off at the end.

02:16:14.822 --> 02:16:17.806
But the real cause of death was malnutrition and a collapsed immune system.

02:16:17.886 --> 02:16:19.267
And that is what the Geyer study says.

02:16:19.307 --> 02:16:20.969
Now, anybody who's listening to this,

02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:23.271
You know, you can go look at this study.

02:16:23.491 --> 02:16:24.972
Couldn't be DDT, right?

02:16:25.132 --> 02:16:28.014
None of these things that were also phased out at the same time.

02:16:28.074 --> 02:16:29.935
It's still a very limited spectrum.

02:16:29.995 --> 02:16:35.979
It's not discussing all of the things on the table all of the time, and I think that's how you can catch them.

02:16:36.279 --> 02:16:38.660
Don't blame me and don't say, you know, Kennedy's in denial.

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:41.562
This is the only time CDC ever looked at this, and it's called G-U-Y-E-R.

02:16:43.323 --> 02:16:51.391
It's published, as I recall, in Pediatrics, and it's CDC and Johns Hopkins in the year 2000.

02:16:51.812 --> 02:16:56.376
And I believe the study is true, and it's borne out by many, many others.

02:16:56.396 --> 02:17:01.722
There's another study from 1977 called McGinley and McGinley, and it was

02:17:02.837 --> 02:17:09.999
And that study also said that fewer than 1% of the decline in infectious mortality deaths could be attributed to vaccines.

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.542
And that study was required reading in almost every medical school in this country until the mid-1980s.

02:17:16.682 --> 02:17:24.544
So anyway, I'm just saying that that orthodoxy that you just described, it's not an orthodoxy that should be accepted on faith.

02:17:24.624 --> 02:17:25.645
People should actually look at it.

02:17:25.705 --> 02:17:27.165
And when they have, it has not borne up.

02:17:27.965 --> 02:17:29.506
I'll just finish this story, and I'll try to be brief.

02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:38.834
I'm in because why because Reagan caved in and it wasn't just Reagan it was the Democrats my uncle was chairing the Health Committee at that time and the Democrats also went along.

02:17:39.774 --> 02:17:57.162
They passed the Vaccine Act in 1986 and the Vaccine Act gave immunity from liability to all vaccine companies if you for any injury for negligence no matter how negligent you are no matter how reckless your conduct no matter how toxic the agreement how shoddily tested or manufactured the product no matter how grievous your injury you your vaccine company you cannot be sued.

02:17:58.308 --> 02:18:04.358
This was a huge gift for this industry because the biggest cost for every medical product is downstream liabilities.

02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:06.982
And all of a sudden, those have disappeared.

02:18:07.423 --> 02:18:12.090
So you're not only taking away that cost, but you're also incentivizing the production of many new vaccines.

02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:15.472
You're also disincentivizing.

02:18:15.832 --> 02:18:21.255
You're removing the incentive to make them safe because no matter how dangerous they are, they don't care because they can't be sued.

02:18:22.776 --> 02:18:26.198
But you may say, well, if they're really dangerous, then nobody is going to buy them.

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:28.640
But the problem with that is nobody has a choice.

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:41.064
They not only got rid of the downstream liability, but they don't have any advertising or marketing costs because the federal government is ordering 76 million people, essentially ordering 76 million kids to take the product a year.

02:18:42.004 --> 02:18:44.545
If you can get that on the schedule, it's like printing a billion dollars for you.

02:18:44.965 --> 02:18:46.005
And so there was a gold rush.

02:18:46.065 --> 02:18:50.367
And then the other thing is they are exempt from pre-licensing safety testing.

02:18:51.207 --> 02:18:52.027
They don't have to be tested.

02:18:52.488 --> 02:18:52.948
And they're not.

02:18:53.368 --> 02:18:55.129
And I said this for many, many years.

02:18:55.309 --> 02:19:04.873
You know, I said not one of these 72 vaccines has ever been tested, pre-licensing and a placebo-controlled trial where you're looking at vaccinated versus unvaccinated kids and looking at health outcomes.

02:19:05.193 --> 02:19:07.634
So it's frustrating because we're really not saying it.

02:19:08.095 --> 02:19:09.215
And I get it.

02:19:09.355 --> 02:19:10.116
I want to say it.

02:19:10.256 --> 02:19:11.216
He's a politician.

02:19:11.236 --> 02:19:15.558
I get it that the message has to be crafted in the right way to open other people's minds.

02:19:16.338 --> 02:19:17.459
But, um,

02:19:18.263 --> 02:19:22.627
What strikes me as much more important is that they had me in their stable.

02:19:23.528 --> 02:19:26.271
They had me in their stable and they threw me out.

02:19:26.651 --> 02:19:30.395
And they threw me out with a vengeance, with prejudice.

02:19:35.325 --> 02:19:45.133
and now are in a concerted effort to assert this narrative of a circulating, many circulating pathogens for which we may need vaccines.

02:19:45.713 --> 02:19:48.255
We just may not have working vaccines right now.

02:19:48.295 --> 02:19:50.637
We may not have well-tested vaccines right now.

02:19:51.118 --> 02:19:56.042
We may not have completely safe vaccines right now, but we definitely need vaccines.

02:19:56.082 --> 02:20:02.687
There are definitely viruses for which we would need vaccines if we could produce vaccines that weren't inherently dangerous.

02:20:03.837 --> 02:20:12.305
And so just like the slideshow that I just showed you is stating it, they are not arguing that the vaccine schedule is a crime.

02:20:12.465 --> 02:20:21.573
They're not arguing that the vaccines represent a toxifying of our children that is wholly unnecessary.

02:20:21.673 --> 02:20:24.655
Even though he kind of says it, the Geier study kind of said that.

02:20:25.455 --> 02:20:38.465
But if the Geier study is true, then the next thing out of your mouth should be, it looks like this vaccine schedule has largely become a criminal enterprise, even if there was something there in the original three shots that we were given when I was a kid.

02:20:39.526 --> 02:20:41.727
How hard would it be to say that?

02:20:41.807 --> 02:20:44.229
You're already alienating anybody anyway.

02:20:44.249 --> 02:20:45.991
You're on the Joe Rogan podcast.

02:20:46.031 --> 02:20:51.475
It's not like more than half of the world just discounts Joe Rogan as an idiot from the start.

02:20:55.174 --> 02:20:57.674
I don't know, I see a problem here.

02:20:57.754 --> 02:21:01.215
I definitely see a problem here and I don't like it.

02:21:01.255 --> 02:21:03.155
You can watch the rest of that if you'd like.

02:21:04.716 --> 02:21:11.197
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Joe Marshall, the Liberty Perspective you can find on Rumble and elsewhere.

02:21:11.237 --> 02:21:14.297
He's also got a book called The Last Call for Liberty.

02:21:15.258 --> 02:21:17.338
And then this has also been Bob on Joe.

02:21:17.398 --> 02:21:20.058
So that was Bobby on Joe Rogan's podcast.

02:21:20.098 --> 02:21:23.159
And we're trying to build an understanding of the illusion here.

02:21:24.758 --> 02:21:35.373
If you want to understand the illusion, you have to understand how they've been telling us that the algorithms have been telling us, yeah, the programming of social media has been telling us that there's pandemic potential and bat caves.

02:21:36.485 --> 02:21:44.366
that can be accessed by Dutch and Wisconsin scientists in animal passage and in serial passage in cell culture.

02:21:44.387 --> 02:21:56.249
And then there's also people like Ralph Baric and Peter Daszak and Shengli Shi, who can stitch different genes of these viruses together and create thing that mother nature never would have created on her own.

02:21:56.789 --> 02:22:02.310
And the reason why they've told us this mythology is because they wanna invert our individual sovereignty

02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:12.239
our individualism to collectivism so that they can have us as experimental subjects, or more importantly, your kids.

02:22:12.419 --> 02:22:25.591
And so the real truth is, is that they can make DNA and RNA and they can play with it in animals, they can play with it in cell culture, they can passage it in animals, and they can stitch it together and see what happens when they make a lot of it and put it on a cell culture in an animal.

02:22:26.428 --> 02:22:42.631
But just because the DNA is in the first one and then in the last dish, or just because the DNA is in the first animal and then in the last animal, doesn't mean that all of the pretenses and presuppositions of virology have been confirmed by any of these experiments.

02:22:42.651 --> 02:22:48.392
And in fact, the no virus people like Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan have been very right about that.

02:22:48.432 --> 02:22:51.353
But I think they've been standing in front of somebody like

02:22:51.953 --> 02:23:09.951
like Mark Bailey, who actually was saying it in a way that meant something, saying it in a way that would have moved the ball forward because he was connecting his observations about SARS-CoV-2 to the observations that were made about AIDS and other virology, and those observations need to be hidden behind a clown show

02:23:10.532 --> 02:23:13.415
that I think is Andy Kaufman and Tom Cowan.

02:23:13.796 --> 02:23:24.127
Because otherwise we would have usefully reached the point of hearing from Stefan Lanka or maybe from Dave Resnick or any of these other people that have literally 20 more years of

02:23:26.249 --> 02:23:31.634
credit under their belt for having been skeptical at a time when it wasn't cool to be skeptical.

02:23:31.674 --> 02:23:39.902
And instead, we've been force-fed the opinions and the images of these other people who don't have the street cred to be where they are.

02:23:40.343 --> 02:23:41.023
They just don't.

02:23:41.943 --> 02:23:44.125
And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are.

02:23:44.165 --> 02:23:48.408
And that's why this common knowledge is not out there yet.

02:23:48.548 --> 02:23:50.790
What should be common knowledge is not out there yet.

02:23:50.850 --> 02:23:52.051
Yes, they can make DNA.

02:23:52.091 --> 02:23:53.953
Yes, they can make RNA.

02:23:53.993 --> 02:24:01.579
And yes, they can force it into cell culture and into animals and get immune responses and get PCR positives and sequence stuff.

02:24:01.619 --> 02:24:02.180
Sure they can.

02:24:03.954 --> 02:24:07.817
that does not prove the tenements of biology or whatever the right word is.

02:24:07.877 --> 02:24:13.722
It's not that doesn't prove that the presuppositions of the virology narrative at all.

02:24:13.802 --> 02:24:17.665
And it certainly doesn't prove the existence of pandemic potential.

02:24:17.745 --> 02:24:21.528
And if you understand that RNA can't be copied very well, just like

02:24:22.068 --> 02:24:36.253
An audio cassette from the 80s can't be copied very well, so you could sell those in music stores, and you could also sell a dubbing tape deck, and there was no danger of you selling these copied tapes or copied albums.

02:24:36.313 --> 02:24:37.514
The album 1984 from

02:24:41.175 --> 02:24:44.097
Van Halen was one of the first albums I ever got as a gift.

02:24:44.617 --> 02:24:49.821
It came on a cassette tape, and I had a dual cassette player that could copy that one onto another one.

02:24:50.461 --> 02:24:56.285
Sure, you could make mixtapes from your albums, but you couldn't copy an album and sell it to somebody.

02:24:57.486 --> 02:25:03.329
the level of the audio and the quality of the sound will necessarily degrade every time you copy it.

02:25:03.809 --> 02:25:15.175
And so just like that analogy, you can't copy these, whatever these RNA signals are, you can't copy them by putting them into a Vero 6 cell culture and get lots and lots more DNA out.

02:25:15.295 --> 02:25:16.376
It doesn't work like that.

02:25:16.456 --> 02:25:17.617
It's never worked like that.

02:25:18.097 --> 02:25:25.921
And in fact, the way that they've circumvented this huge problem is they just say, well, we sequence something in the wild and we made a DNA copy of it.

02:25:26.041 --> 02:25:31.947
because DNA copies are very easy to make and they're double-stranded so they're also very high fidelity to copy.

02:25:32.648 --> 02:25:47.843
And so unlike an RNA signal found in the wild and purported to be sequenced that can't be grown in a culture, we can use very, very standard techniques to grow DNA plasmids in bacterial culture.

02:25:48.567 --> 02:26:06.421
And so we can make as much DNA as we want to by any number of means, including the way that Brian Artis showed us in the red pill presentation that came right before mine, where he showed that venom was being made, but he didn't describe exactly how the venom is made, which is that they make the DNA that encodes the venom.

02:26:06.982 --> 02:26:13.427
And they make a large quantity of that DNA before they use any number of means to convert it from RNA to protein.

02:26:16.747 --> 02:26:36.104
And these same methodologies that are essentially used to produce all protein biologics up until the pandemic can also be used to produce large quantities of RNA, which can be put on cell culture and called virology, put on animals and called virology, or given to other people and called virological samples.

02:26:37.173 --> 02:26:41.358
And in the literature of virology, these things are called infectious clones.

02:26:41.439 --> 02:26:48.468
And yes, you can use these same industrial techniques to make a lot of DNA or RNA and call them infectious clones.

02:26:49.471 --> 02:26:52.373
And in fact, that's most likely what they've done here.

02:26:53.073 --> 02:26:59.677
They don't need to produce a lot of it, but whatever they wanted to find, they probably put it there so that they were sure to find what they wanted to find.

02:27:00.177 --> 02:27:03.960
You know, like a designer spike protein that they could cry about for four and a half years.

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:06.581
But it's just synthetic DNA.

02:27:06.621 --> 02:27:09.843
It's just synthetic RNA, or just made in quantity.

02:27:09.903 --> 02:27:10.304
That's it.

02:27:11.169 --> 02:27:12.029
There's no more tricks.

02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:14.991
There's no more mastery of the human genome.

02:27:15.031 --> 02:27:20.173
No more massive understanding of how to stitch gain-of-function viruses together.

02:27:20.213 --> 02:27:20.994
It's this simple.

02:27:21.754 --> 02:27:23.235
And then they tell you they found it.

02:27:24.221 --> 02:27:41.026
If this signal that they put in a certain place could be confounded with a background signal, then you've got the most convoluted Scooby-Doo mystery ever, especially if the people that social media say are the leaders in solving the mystery are actually part of the show.

02:27:43.006 --> 02:27:47.688
And I assure you, these people are part of the show and they are hiding it by cooperative lying.

02:27:50.868 --> 02:27:54.950
And they absorb people, they let people participate in it, and they never say these things.

02:27:55.010 --> 02:28:00.832
Intermuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:28:01.333 --> 02:28:05.875
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent, and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:28:05.895 --> 02:28:07.795
You could say it a different way if you wanted to.

02:28:08.256 --> 02:28:13.038
You could say weaponized piles of money have murdered people and gotten people to agree about it being a lab leak.

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:19.381
The old vaccine schedule was injuring and killing thousands of people every year and VAERS sucked.

02:28:19.941 --> 02:28:31.426
So comparing the VAERS sucky signal from before to the VAERS signal now is stupid because it sort of kind of just says that the previous VAERS was okay.

02:28:34.381 --> 02:28:38.724
RNA virology is just transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animal models.

02:28:38.784 --> 02:28:43.647
Ladies and gentlemen, these are as close as I can get to the truth in a few words.

02:28:44.448 --> 02:28:47.590
And there's lots and lots for you to read if you want to find out.

02:28:48.090 --> 02:28:53.314
Maybe start with the citations in my latest substack titled, A Working Document.

02:28:54.234 --> 02:28:59.217
Please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:29:00.097 --> 02:29:04.480
If you want to support the stream, you can go to gigaohmbiological.com.

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:09.122
If you want to share the stream, you can actually go to stream.gigaohm.bio and guess what?

02:29:09.602 --> 02:29:16.686
You can now download all the videos at either 480 or at full resolution and then you can post them wherever you want to.

02:29:17.146 --> 02:29:30.873
You can start your own Rumble channel called Gigaohm Biological Rocks and you can download a video a day and you can post it on your own Rumble channel or you can post them to Twitter or you can do anything you want with them.

02:29:30.993 --> 02:29:32.254
All of them are downloadable.

02:29:32.674 --> 02:29:45.980
We're gonna get Jeff from Earth on stream.gigaohm.bio so that he can upload clips there as well, so that we can start to bombard Twitter with our own message as we slowly leave Twitter behind.

02:29:47.421 --> 02:29:48.941
Because it's not working for us.

02:29:49.001 --> 02:29:50.142
It's never worked for us.

02:29:50.222 --> 02:29:53.063
It's always been a tool to manipulate us.

02:29:53.363 --> 02:29:55.544
And so, thank you very much for joining me.

02:29:56.464 --> 02:29:59.646
Shout out to Rodney Mullen, and I will see you guys again soon.

02:30:02.512 --> 02:30:07.416
This is a luxury of having spent my life doing what I love.

02:30:08.878 --> 02:30:14.162
The cost of that, it sucks.

02:30:17.605 --> 02:30:18.726
I'm not blind.

02:30:20.708 --> 02:30:22.669
I'm not numb to the pain.

02:30:24.151 --> 02:30:30.116
I would argue I'm more conscious of it than anybody else, but I'm also more conscious of what that gives me.

02:30:34.355 --> 02:30:42.580
And when I'm done with this, that will be what it is and I'll find a way.

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:51.286
But there's something inside of me propelling that I'm not going to give up until the wheels fall off.

02:30:52.527 --> 02:30:53.407
That's what I'm made of.

02:30:55.108 --> 02:31:01.873
And I wish I see all the arguments against it, but I wish I could relate the intangibles to you.

02:31:04.821 --> 02:31:07.401
My guess is that we're all built the same.

02:31:08.622 --> 02:31:12.602
None of us are completely stupid, a little deranged.

02:31:12.882 --> 02:31:14.463
I think a strong argument, I do.

02:31:16.463 --> 02:31:20.564
But ultimately, we also know what we have.

02:31:22.424 --> 02:31:32.866
And to go and lay down in that sense of it, that's like embracing what we've done with our lives, you know?

02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:37.050
You guys are all a part of this, you know.

02:31:38.350 --> 02:31:39.691
We all made it here together.

02:31:40.892 --> 02:31:42.973
And we're gonna make it to the finish line together.

02:31:43.013 --> 02:31:44.033
Don't you ever forget it.

02:31:44.113 --> 02:31:45.854
Thank you very much for being a part of this.

02:31:46.134 --> 02:31:49.335
And I will see you tomorrow for a 4th of July special stream.

02:31:50.016 --> 02:31:52.877
Because our basketball gym is closed tomorrow.

02:31:52.957 --> 02:31:56.899
So if you need something to listen to, I'll be on sometime in the afternoon.

02:31:56.959 --> 02:31:58.880
Probably right after lunch or right before.

02:31:58.940 --> 02:31:59.240
I don't know.

02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:00.000
I'll figure it out.

02:32:00.581 --> 02:32:03.142
I love you guys all very much and I will see you again very soon.
