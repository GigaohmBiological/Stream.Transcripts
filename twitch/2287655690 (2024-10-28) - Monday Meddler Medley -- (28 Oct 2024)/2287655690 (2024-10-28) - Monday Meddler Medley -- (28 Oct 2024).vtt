WEBVTT

00:05.194 --> 00:05.414
you.

00:25.435 --> 00:25.855
and and and

01:51.510 --> 01:51.571
you

02:22.535 --> 02:22.775
Oh.

02:50.540 --> 03:12.001
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

03:13.563 --> 03:14.524
But I know for sure

03:14.909 --> 03:32.358
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

05:21.582 --> 05:29.746
It's one of the reasons why I'm late today because there's a lot of things to prepare even if you're not charging for tickets and you don't plan to do anything special.

05:31.003 --> 05:41.206
Having a gathering of unknown number of people coming in from all different places with the potential to attract many more than you thought is daunting.

05:41.266 --> 05:47.148
But my wife and I are working at it and the central people involved are coming.

05:47.228 --> 05:51.849
And so yeah, it has a potential to be really off the hook.

05:51.909 --> 05:52.789
I'm pretty excited.

05:53.510 --> 05:54.510
I hope you guys are too.

06:04.269 --> 06:27.475
Let me form the style, I think that the time's near that we drop studs, there won't be no thugs here, rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip, but when they hear the jam, they be on the dills, now I'm not fuckin' rock, I know the territory, go ahead and try, that's a different story, similar to grim, I can tell a better one, all about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run, stands on the side, where the mic is getting them,

06:28.095 --> 06:33.217
I'll be the first to shake your hand.

06:33.237 --> 06:35.997
Competition's good.

06:36.337 --> 06:37.978
It brings out the vital parts.

06:38.018 --> 06:40.639
The abstract, poetic, majors in recital arts.

06:40.699 --> 06:41.639
Do it for the kids.

06:41.919 --> 06:43.139
The elders and the rap peers.

06:43.159 --> 06:44.600
We know the job is done.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.181
When we hear a lot of cheers, gotta feel the vibe.

06:47.221 --> 06:48.181
Word from our creation.

06:48.541 --> 07:18.079

07:18.319 --> 07:34.774
I must do my job, take care of Mama Dew I won't resort to Rob, Rob you get your dough Mace is my witness, obsessed with the rap But it's the mental fitness, like shootin' CeeLo And always hittin' headcracks, the industry is luck Winnin' with the fake raps, beats to the tunes, clues from the real hit

07:35.254 --> 08:04.718
Not sellin' out, from hard rock to this jock I don't know what to say, but here I go, freaky If the papes come, then you know I'm seekin' I'm just a short brother, dark-skinned face Weigh a buck fifty, thirty-six waist Hair is crazy curly, foot like Mr. Curly To this day, I still believe that no MC can serve me Others try to front, but everybody know I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show party and I'm all I was, but now I chill at home All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink shit Don't find my thrill in Amityville

08:23.368 --> 08:24.349
We got, we got the vibes.

08:24.389 --> 08:27.591
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes.

08:27.711 --> 08:30.433
Oakland and Queens, we got the vibes.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.475
Uptown and our room, we got the vibes.

08:33.535 --> 08:35.437
Upstate, we got the vibes.

08:35.517 --> 08:38.018
If you're in D.C., you got the vibes.

08:38.158 --> 08:40.680
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, vibes.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.582
Out West, we got the vibes.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.663
In the Bahamas, we got the vibes.

08:44.703 --> 08:47.725
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes.

08:47.825 --> 08:49.907
We got people live, it goes on.

08:50.527 --> 08:55.711
A rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums, good with the girls, I get a whole lot of them.

08:55.731 --> 09:00.754
But from Pat, to Skinny, Frida, to Winnie, Emma, to Cindy, Constance, to Wendy.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.516
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side.

09:03.576 --> 09:07.218
I don't brag to brothers, about the little place I got my waffles, thighs can vary.

09:07.398 --> 09:09.800
The sight is never scary, it's only legendary.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.482
My father well prepared me, my job intemporary.

09:12.642 --> 09:15.223
I'm here for the long shot, better yet the long term.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.425
I don't have a perm, in a way I do.

09:18.966 --> 09:27.652
I'm happy and I'm scrappy and I'm happy when I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stand It's as good as grand like that.

09:27.812 --> 09:28.732
I want to say peace

09:48.247 --> 09:50.213
You just gotta keep it happy

10:43.385 --> 10:45.347
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

10:46.448 --> 10:51.152
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

10:52.591 --> 10:54.354
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

10:55.897 --> 10:56.638
It's embarrassing.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.978
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.846
It is 108 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, coming to you live from the back of my garage.

11:19.866 --> 11:25.173
This is gigaohm biological, a high resistance, low noise, and whoa, what happened there?

11:25.193 --> 11:27.015
Low noise resistance.

11:28.337 --> 11:30.860
information brief brought to you by a biologist.

11:30.900 --> 11:36.086
Your consciousness is the prime real estate that these people are trying to occupy with their mythologies.

11:36.606 --> 11:41.972
And in fact, we inherited the charlatans that we are currently trying to shed.

11:42.753 --> 11:46.897
And that's not our fault, but it's definitely now our responsibility.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.799
We've got to make sure that we realize that

11:49.420 --> 11:58.287
When we inherited the charlatans, there was only TV and there was only newspapers and now there's social media and it's our active participation in it.

11:58.847 --> 12:07.714
And worse yet, the skillful use of it by our young people that is getting us further and further into this whole of governance by mythology.

12:08.334 --> 12:14.536
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

12:15.016 --> 12:17.417
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal.

12:17.897 --> 12:21.358
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses aren't pattern integrities.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.799
Welcome to the show, everyone.

12:23.919 --> 12:27.740
Edward Bernays told us how it was working in 1924.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.242
And Noam Chomsky told us a few decades later, it's a limited spectrum of debate.

12:34.142 --> 12:38.485
And a very lively argument within that spectrum is how this is done.

12:39.046 --> 12:41.788
First, they threw us out on the road all by ourselves.

12:41.848 --> 12:48.933
And then they pretended to be hitchhiking us, picking us up and giving us a ride, helping us out.

12:49.633 --> 12:52.315
And it turns out that we got into the car with a bunch of people.

12:52.355 --> 12:57.059
We got onto social media with a bunch of people that were going to lie to us and in coordinated

12:57.879 --> 13:08.325
fashion so that even the whispering in the back seat that was supposed to be about the people in the front seat was actually a coordinated theater with the people in the front seat.

13:08.865 --> 13:21.772
So that we ran out of one car and got into the other car and then thought the people in the new car were the heroes until one of them lied to us and then we got out of that car and got into another car and as long as we stayed on social media we were trapped.

13:22.532 --> 13:39.709
were trapped in this illusion of a novel virus responsible for the excess deaths that they already expected to happen for decades and needed an excuse to manage them and that excuse was of course the pandemic and that excuse was a rushed

13:40.430 --> 14:01.548
countermeasure set, or a censored social media, or ventilators, or remdesivir, or midazolam, but not the combination or the sum total of all of these different forms of murder to describe and justify why there is indeed no epidemiological evidence of spread.

14:02.569 --> 14:10.034
And while we argue about these things, of course, there is no useful progress being made on the legal front in America.

14:10.919 --> 14:25.854
The legal front in America is actually the only place in the Western world where any progress could be made, and so it's very important that the controlled demolition of the American governmental system and the American Constitution proceed as planned.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.615
That's what's happening here.

14:27.755 --> 14:35.143
It is a multi-generational plan, and we are in a, let's say, 10-year frame of that plan right now.

14:36.223 --> 14:45.985
That's why they want to keep you talking on very short timescales like the last five hours or even worse, the coming three days or something like that.

14:46.025 --> 14:49.046
The vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise.

14:49.066 --> 14:52.787
You can figure that out by looking at the vaccine schedule in any other Western nation.

14:53.327 --> 14:58.928
You can find the word transfection in the catalog of many, many biotech companies because they had

14:59.628 --> 15:03.531
what are called products before the pandemic, products called transfection.

15:03.591 --> 15:09.254
It's a general term for a methodology using naked DNA or RNA to express a protein somewhere.

15:09.274 --> 15:13.557
And it would have always been criminal and healthy humans because RNA cannot pandemic.

15:13.597 --> 15:15.498
So there's no reason to scare people about it.

15:15.558 --> 15:17.900
And more importantly, there's no reason to use that myth.

15:18.800 --> 15:27.606
to coerce people into accepting transfection as a successful countermeasure, because that's just not what happened.

15:28.386 --> 15:43.937
And in fact, what I'm arguing is that a very, very complex militarized social media theater was used in conjunction with military programs like Telegram, Facebook, X, and Signal

15:45.168 --> 15:57.734
to create an illusion of consensus and stick to a limited spectrum of debate within all of these social media platforms, all of these isolated conversations where the truth was being found.

15:58.915 --> 16:04.818
And we, with our skillful use of social media actually, went right into the trap.

16:05.799 --> 16:09.202
head first, and most of us are still in it.

16:09.782 --> 16:17.348
Most of us are still bamboozled by the people on motorcycles riding around inside the sphere of death.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.100
And we've got to save our children from this.

16:21.140 --> 16:35.052
We cannot allow our children to inherit this totalitarianism where a highly trained group of acolytes on social media runs a very loud and shiny theater and our children think that's reality.

16:35.573 --> 16:37.875
We cannot allow this to happen.

16:37.895 --> 16:42.959
And that's why I'm online every day that I can be.

16:44.420 --> 16:53.707
And that's why I'm trying to organize a live meeting this weekend, because I really think it's important for us to get there.

16:53.987 --> 16:55.067
I'm just going to take that off.

16:56.268 --> 17:12.099
To the point where we're actually making progress and not just spinning our wheels, which we still actually are right now, because weaponized piles of money are still able to effectively use their acolytes on social media to convince most of our family and friends about what to argue and with whom to argue.

17:12.839 --> 17:32.382
And this is happening very, very extraordinary right now, of course, about the election, because you can almost feel this momentum where the entire narrative around Kamala is collapsing while the entire narrative around Trump is rising, at least from the perspective of our version of the

17:33.223 --> 17:33.904
the illusion.

17:34.004 --> 17:47.054
But if you get on the other side of this cloud, if you get on the other side of this military program with a different set of accounts, I think you're going to see the exact opposite narrative, where it's ridiculous to think that Donald Trump would win.

17:48.555 --> 17:54.400
And it's absolutely absurd to think that if he does win, that it would be by any other means other than cheating.

17:54.460 --> 17:58.803
And this mythology is what they want you to participate in by the

18:00.905 --> 18:07.050
the process of participating in that ritual, then maybe you're going to accept the outcome as they give it to you.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.932
So ladies and gentlemen, you are listening to Jonathan Cooey.

18:11.413 --> 18:14.815
My family and I have lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for quite some time since 2016, but

18:17.397 --> 18:18.878
I'm originally a Wisconsin boy.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.359
I grew up in Kadat, Wisconsin.

18:21.499 --> 18:32.826
I spent about 20 years chasing tenure at several universities, including in Norway and in the Netherlands and at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where I found myself at the beginning of the pandemic with a

18:33.726 --> 18:44.017
pretty substantial track record of science on the PubMed web, the web-based database that you can find there and follow up on.

18:44.617 --> 18:51.725
Gigaohm Biological, the name Gigaohm is derived from the methodology that I was an expert in during my pursuit of tenure.

18:54.929 --> 19:05.956
You can find my work at stream.gigaohm.bio and all the links there are to things that I think are worth perusing, including Jeff from Earth's Gigaohm Clips channel there at the top.

19:06.637 --> 19:10.479
Excellent things to be dropping on Twitter, et cetera.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.842
And also, of course, there's gigaohmbiological.com.

19:15.062 --> 19:18.424
And that place is kind of the headquarters where you can find ways to support.

19:18.464 --> 19:19.285
You can sign up for a

19:20.959 --> 19:35.195
mailing list that kind of thing um let me get over here i'm sorry i'm a little oh what i pushed fade to black wow that was wrong um i need to do this like this and then like that wow i uh

19:36.249 --> 19:43.254
I've been dismantling and figuring out what parts of this rig I can take with me to the community center to set up the live stream.

19:43.274 --> 19:45.936
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey, coming to you live from my garage.

19:47.457 --> 19:58.565
We are having a live, live event this weekend that I'm going to try and live stream and send out to the world in real time, but also make a good recording of and edit and post on my channel and others.

19:59.486 --> 20:01.127
We're a couple very important and

20:02.651 --> 20:04.272
Important friends of mine are going to be there.

20:05.013 --> 20:07.555
Joe Marshall is going to be there.

20:08.156 --> 20:09.557
Mark Kulak is going to be there.

20:09.697 --> 20:11.078
Scott Schara is going to be there.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.620
It's possible that Paul Alexander will be there.

20:13.660 --> 20:21.106
It's possible that some doctors from Canada who are attending the Brownstone event earlier that weekend will also be there.

20:21.927 --> 20:24.849
The Brownstone event is the 1st and 2nd of November.

20:25.730 --> 20:27.431
That would be Friday and Saturday.

20:27.471 --> 20:31.654
And then Sunday is our event from 2 to 4 or 2 to 5, something like that.

20:32.635 --> 20:57.350
um it's uh it's kind of up for grabs if you are actually going to make the trip good on you um there's no tickets uh we're not charging anything but that also means you should kind of approach it like a unknown in terms of like a i don't know a distant family relative reunion type thing where you're not even sure the food will be any good so just plan accordingly i think you won't be disappointed and you might get lucky and meet a lot of really interesting patriots

20:58.550 --> 21:03.192
Today I'm going to continue this All of Them Are Working for the Slavers theme.

21:04.972 --> 21:14.675
I think I titled this Monday Meddler Medley because I didn't want to have too much negativity on the title, but really the title is All of Them Are Working for the Slavers.

21:14.915 --> 21:26.519
And I think it's kind of a... It's coming back to always feeling I need to define this a little bit better, that I need to justify why it is.

21:27.759 --> 21:32.580
that I think this is such an apt analogy for social media, but it really is.

21:32.680 --> 21:45.723
Because as long as these people agree to kind of argue with some vigor within that limited spectrum of debate, then you're never gonna realize that these people aren't really going, oh wow, Jay's really got something.

21:45.763 --> 21:46.863
Oh, I really like what you do.

21:46.903 --> 21:48.784
They're just, nobody sees that.

21:49.997 --> 21:57.100
Those retweets and everything might be completely invisible to the rest of the world if the military program works the way that I think it does.

21:57.720 --> 22:07.184
And so everybody sees their own representation of the Star Wars universe, but there's no reason why across the internet that everybody needs to see the same Star Wars game.

22:07.224 --> 22:15.248
As long as all the ships look the same, and as long as all the scenarios are the same, then we'll agree that we've experienced the same thing today as somebody else did.

22:16.127 --> 22:19.168
And so that's the real thing that we need to understand.

22:19.208 --> 22:31.052
And now that we've surrendered our reality to these social media military programs, we are essentially no longer anchored to anything that we understand and can count on.

22:31.232 --> 22:34.693
And that's a very dangerous place for us to hand off to our kids.

22:35.333 --> 22:38.714
And so I want to make a few points about how easy it is for me.

22:38.774 --> 22:45.175
And I think how easy it could be for you to see that all these people are really end up working for the slavers in one way or another.

22:45.715 --> 22:50.076
So the last stream that I did was actually called the keeping it real study hall.

22:50.116 --> 23:03.719
And I tried to show you that there is the recent rise of somebody on YouTube who's been pretty working pretty steady off and on on a a rather, you know, average level

23:04.710 --> 23:20.799
content creator with regard to athletics and then very recently in 2023 or 24 she's become quite notable and in fact was allowed to speak in front of the Senate in that same panel where Jordan Peterson's daughter was allowed to speak and a bunch of other nutritional experts spoke.

23:21.599 --> 23:38.712
And so I was like a little bit weirded out by the fact that I had seen this woman who was also promoted by CHD, she's kind of a vaccine injury person, but then it's AstraZeneca, and then it's like from the trials, and so then it becomes a little weird.

23:39.452 --> 23:49.420
And so then you go through a recent catalog, and I mean, in the last two months, a recent catalog, and you see a lot of these meddlers that I've already identified as people that I don't think we need to trust necessarily.

23:50.721 --> 24:00.507
And going all the way back to episode two where we have Callie Means, this guy that was, him and his sister were on Tucker Carlson, you know, that whole thing.

24:00.907 --> 24:10.194
And Michael Schellenberger, a guy who's been promoted by all these intellectual dark web people, including multiple times by Brett Weinstein, running for office for something in California, et cetera.

24:10.694 --> 24:13.696
So this all weirded me out because this was all in the last two months.

24:13.716 --> 24:19.660
And then I went back and looked and I saw that, yeah, she's just been a fitness girl and she's a lady, woman, excuse me.

24:20.100 --> 24:25.965
And she's been, you know, just taking standard thumbnails or maybe even letting YouTube choose the thumbnails.

24:26.486 --> 24:27.847
And then I saw that in 2021, she had

24:30.796 --> 24:33.637
Vincent Rancid-Yellow on, which was really weird to me.

24:33.657 --> 24:52.425
And we watched that video and kind of agreed that it was weird that she would have him on and then go back to fitness for another year and a half before actually declaring episode one with Schellenberger and producing all this recent content with all these recent meddlers.

24:57.222 --> 24:59.723
So the question becomes, what in the heck is going on?

24:59.743 --> 25:09.525
And I've been trying to say that a lot of these things are examples of that video game, examples of getting in the chair and how the chair or what the chair is made of.

25:10.625 --> 25:18.087
They want you to think the chair is made up of viral videos and, and, and honest content producers, and more importantly, a

25:19.585 --> 25:29.414
an algorithm that they have no control over, just good ideas and things that people like to click on, rise in your feed.

25:29.935 --> 25:38.203
In no way, shape or form will any of these people, including Vincent or her, Julian Michaels or Dave Rubin or

25:40.164 --> 25:45.668
Matt Walsh or any of those people will acknowledge that there isn't an algorithm, it's a program.

25:45.708 --> 25:57.275
And if they want to flip a switch and make sure that nobody sees you and flip another switch to make sure that everybody seems to stumble upon Matt Walsh, that's a very simple thing to do.

25:58.695 --> 26:06.040
It's a much more complicated thing to create an algorithm that spins out of their control and people spontaneously rise with it.

26:10.239 --> 26:14.741
And that's an important thing to see because Elon Musk will hide behind the same thing.

26:17.162 --> 26:21.883
And in fact, using AI in a war zone would be hiding behind the same thing.

26:22.523 --> 26:26.465
It's a fine line between an AI and a program, isn't it?

26:28.306 --> 26:37.389
The AI that identified the four drugs, or the computational analysis that identified the four drugs, or wait, was it, or was it,

26:38.348 --> 26:40.889
Or was it laser scanning confocal microscopy?

26:40.949 --> 26:42.390
I can't even remember it anymore.

26:42.870 --> 26:57.976
So I think that this is really something that needs to be brought to the fore again, just because I think in these next few days, it's really vital that everybody who hasn't already really reorient to understand

26:59.278 --> 27:08.644
what is likely the case with somebody like Robert Malone and how hard it is to really just put him in a patriot bucket.

27:10.245 --> 27:12.526
It's really ridiculous to do that at this stage.

27:16.129 --> 27:19.971
And the reason why it was ridiculous is still available on the internet.

27:20.031 --> 27:22.192
It's still available on the internet.

27:22.232 --> 27:24.774
This frame is taken from a YouTube video.

27:30.734 --> 27:46.199
And so that's the reason why these people won't talk about a decades-long, ongoing, anticipated rise in the number of old people needing advanced care and end-of-life care and Medicare and Social Security.

27:46.219 --> 27:47.720
They've always known this is coming.

27:48.260 --> 27:53.467
The fact that social security was going to go bankrupt was not because of mismanagement.

27:53.587 --> 28:05.482
It is because there were going to be more old people than had paid into the system in the first place because it just wasn't supporting the way it should have supported this doubling at the top here.

28:07.335 --> 28:11.177
And this was a problem that many Western nations had.

28:11.317 --> 28:20.781
And that's one of the reasons why the excess mortality here being portrayed exclusively as the novel virus and the lockdowns is absurd.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.222
They knew that this rise was going to happen.

28:26.377 --> 28:37.587
And once you realize that and realize how exclusively absent it is from all of the people on social media with any reasonable sized following, it becomes very extraordinary.

28:38.027 --> 28:41.410
Now, couple that with the fact that this entire list

28:42.375 --> 28:44.016
is never discussed by anyone.

28:44.076 --> 28:51.899
In particular, parts of this list are never discussed by anyone but Mark and myself and Joe and Scott Shara.

28:52.719 --> 29:00.603
Scott Shara is the one who brought to our attention the supplementary oxygen that then became visible in Leslie Batt's case and a bunch of other cases.

29:01.123 --> 29:04.164
And this became something that nobody could talk about anymore.

29:06.005 --> 29:10.047
In fact, it feels very much like it was this revelation

29:11.960 --> 29:25.006
that caused Jessica Hockett to freak out on us because she was the only person was able to provoke a video response substack by Pierre Corey about all the things that were going on in New York City.

29:25.046 --> 29:40.434
And the one thing that we couldn't get her to ask about besides the George Floyd testimony that Corey provided was this supplementary oxygen problem and how important it was and how much literature there is behind it.

29:41.789 --> 29:53.134
and how easily supplementary oxygen leads to ARDS, which would be very easily classified as COVID if there was a tremendous pressure from every direction to classify ARDS as COVID.

29:55.715 --> 30:06.459
And so in America, they really did murder people and lie about it partially to manage the problem of an aging population and the

30:07.369 --> 30:15.039
potential bankrupting of our national government with this ballooning Medicare, Medicaid costs.

30:15.119 --> 30:16.581
I don't know which one it is or if it's both.

30:17.847 --> 30:32.470
And so I have also identified and will keep harping on the idea that there were many people before the pandemic that were in place already talking about epidemics as the danger of them going endemic and what endemicity is.

30:32.990 --> 30:44.572
We even have a speech from Barack Obama saying that white racism is endemic in the United States, which is extraordinary because the use of these words is not by chance.

30:45.765 --> 30:47.826
This is an ongoing enchantment.

30:49.047 --> 31:09.621
And that enchantment extends into the semantic realm because it is exactly how it is described in these books, where it is the lack of a common language and a lack of a precise one that makes it possible for you to be enslaved by these kinds of mythologies to enable doublespeak.

31:13.277 --> 31:35.875
And so these people that were in place that already thought, wow, it'd be very dangerous if one of these things became endemic and contributed to the already existing background of death that mother nature provides, but they are not able to talk about how, and will not talk about how, because we have no data from before 2020, it seems very absurd to make the claim that something is going endemic.

31:36.335 --> 31:38.657
We can't tell any difference from that in the background.

31:41.735 --> 31:47.178
And I think that's one of the reasons why I attracted so much attention in 2021, because I was saying this in 2020.

31:48.839 --> 31:59.305
That's why I play that video from the beginning, in the beginning every day, because in July of 2020, I was already saying that, how can they tell us that this is different from the background?

31:59.525 --> 32:03.068
They're not even making an effort to differentiate from the background.

32:03.608 --> 32:08.471
They are just working under the assumption that something is there now that wasn't there a few months ago.

32:08.871 --> 32:10.412
And they have no data to prove that.

32:14.949 --> 32:18.532
And so that's why I got mixed up with all these people, I think.

32:18.572 --> 32:24.538
And so many of these people paid attention to me and I got so sucked into it because they needed me to be on the lab leak.

32:24.598 --> 32:28.422
That's what everybody needed to be on because that was the Scooby-Doo mystery.

32:28.482 --> 32:32.966
That was the actual military psychological operation.

32:34.540 --> 32:53.247
And the goal of that was to confuse everyone with fear, uncertainty, and doubt so that expected outcomes of transfection in the population could be confused and misconstrued as outcomes from infection by a gain-of-function virus.

32:54.608 --> 33:02.291
And so as long as some people in the world had the feeling that they could be lying about it, and if they are lying about it, they're probably lying about it because of these,

33:04.138 --> 33:12.641
then there would always be this air of uncertainty that would make people more likely to allow themselves to be coerced into taking that transfection.

33:13.101 --> 33:20.323
And then if they combined that mass behavioral adjustment

33:21.846 --> 33:28.971
with a massive placebo rollout, it would be very easy for them to slowly titrate us to the truth.

33:29.392 --> 33:34.836
And that is, well, the old vaccine schedule sucked, but this new one that we're gonna replace with transfection is great.

33:35.216 --> 33:38.439
And look how many people took transfection and were fine.

33:38.459 --> 33:47.446
And that's why these same people that have been in front of us for the last five years have never come to the possible

33:48.513 --> 34:00.201
idea that, wow, you know, one easy way to meet any manufacturing quota and greatly reduce the ratio of adverse events would be to roll out placebos.

34:00.941 --> 34:02.802
Now you don't have to worry about freezers anymore.

34:02.822 --> 34:05.124
You don't have to worry about storage or mixing them up again.

34:12.898 --> 34:17.682
And so that's why the same people that seeded the narrative in 2020 are still in front of us now.

34:18.503 --> 34:27.930
The same people that were talking about the spike protein for urine cleavage site, HIV inserts, you know, gain of function and the deleted databases and all that other stuff, they're still in front of us today.

34:31.393 --> 34:41.902
And instead of talking about the things that they ought to talk about that were lies in order to coerce us into teaching this to our children, they're talking about DNA contamination

34:43.132 --> 34:46.955
as if it's something that if it was removed, everything would have been so much better.

34:50.717 --> 34:56.501
And they're doing that in the context of investigations like the one in Scotland, where it's obviously murder.

34:57.382 --> 35:00.204
This is not the spread of a respiratory pathogen.

35:01.605 --> 35:05.648
This is the management of a problem, a population problem.

35:07.028 --> 35:22.262
And you could see the immigration of asylum seekers as part of the management of this problem to make sure that the population pyramid doesn't show what it would show if there wasn't all these immigrants coming in.

35:23.222 --> 35:29.068
Because if it's got this bump at the top, up here, and then down here, it looks like this,

35:30.607 --> 35:37.088
It's easy to see, but if they pad that out a little bit with immigration, oh, now all of a sudden it looks okay.

35:38.589 --> 35:42.050
And to a large extent, you might imagine that that's exactly what they've done.

35:43.790 --> 35:57.593
And it would be worthwhile for anybody investigating these effects and these explanations to start to think about that as a possibility instead of erring exclusively on the bad batch idea or the double-stranded DNA idea.

35:59.611 --> 36:11.414
or any of these other narratives that don't take into account how much easier and more foolproof it would be to have a signal that was already gonna do this with a certainty in the background.

36:13.274 --> 36:16.855
And so you all know that you're lying about the same thing, basically.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.976
You're lying about murder in America.

36:21.021 --> 36:26.423
And that's why people won't talk about this background expected rise in all-cause mortality.

36:26.443 --> 36:33.665
And they won't talk about the fact that the DNA and RNA signal in the background signal is hot.

36:33.885 --> 36:36.026
It's not a blank slate.

36:37.687 --> 36:39.027
There's not nothing there.

36:39.087 --> 36:46.830
And you can hear Vincent Radston-Yellow, actually Rackin' Yellows say that to Julian Michaels on that podcast we watched two days ago.

36:47.657 --> 36:54.746
You can hear him talk about the millions and millions of viruses in the background, but they don't replicate in you.

36:54.806 --> 36:56.268
They're just there or something.

36:56.449 --> 36:58.652
It's absurdity at its finest.

37:00.374 --> 37:02.577
And they won't talk about how pure oxygen kills.

37:03.057 --> 37:04.800
And we've known this since the eighties.

37:09.278 --> 37:26.720
They won't tell you how PCR is used to the finest precision on the academic bench and that all those optimization steps, all those controls, positive and negative, all those extra tweaks to make it more specific for the target were never used in the context of COVID.

37:30.063 --> 37:35.746
They will never tell you that these were products before the pandemic with names like transformation and transfection.

37:36.107 --> 37:45.552
They will never tell you that even in its purest form, an mRNA transfection would not be appropriate in healthy humans for a whole list of very obvious biological reasons.

37:47.654 --> 37:57.940
And they won't tell you that infectious clone is actually just a semantic code word in the literature for when they substitute transformation or transfection and cell culture for a virus that they can't culture.

37:58.973 --> 38:13.044
And the no-virus people won't explain this to you because if they did, then there would be one less hamster wheel to run in, one less sphere of death to entertain you.

38:14.165 --> 38:21.831
And that's also why they won't say RNA cannot pandemic, because they will have to admit that they could have said that two years ago, or three, or four.

38:26.124 --> 38:31.188
I'm going to escape for a second and start this over because it's starting to overload my immediate memory here.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.270
So let's see where we are.

38:38.994 --> 38:43.058
So this is what I was saying before about skillful media, social media use.

38:43.678 --> 38:55.468
And I also made an allusion to, um, a, the sphere of death, which is a, it is a motorcycle stunt where you have this, this, um,

38:57.611 --> 39:01.673
this motorcycles riding around inside of a metal sphere.

39:03.173 --> 39:12.417
And so in order to give you an idea of how this limited spectrum of debate works, I thought I'd show you that actual sphere.

39:12.557 --> 39:18.580
So here's an example of what I'm talking about.

39:18.620 --> 39:25.183
These people on social media and these people on mainstream media, they are performing this act.

39:26.795 --> 39:43.108
And even though it seems like Robert Malone and the dirty disinformation dozen are fighting against the Fauci's and the Burke's and the whatever's, it's actually an elaborate game.

39:43.528 --> 39:49.593
It's an elaborate performance that's very dangerous because if they do make any mistakes, somebody will get really hurt.

39:50.273 --> 39:51.794
That's for absolutely sure.

39:52.354 --> 39:57.637
But because of the nature of this stunt, if somebody does make a mistake, they can just ignore them.

39:57.978 --> 40:01.140
They can just take them out of the equation and never promote them again.

40:03.061 --> 40:09.745
And sometimes they even fake that so that you think that, oh, wow, that motorcycle guy got kicked out for unfair reasons.

40:09.805 --> 40:13.147
I think I'm going to follow that motorcycle guy instead of the ones in the sphere.

40:13.787 --> 40:19.751
And then that guy goes and rides in another sphere, and you don't even realize that you've just been taken from one side of this sphere to the other.

40:23.106 --> 40:24.767
That's what social media is.

40:24.807 --> 40:26.709
It is a very elaborate performance.

40:26.769 --> 40:41.341
It's not a, if you ride your bicycle around this thing to try and talk to these people while they're performing this and they talk to you, they are not in any way, you are not engaged in their stunt.

40:41.662 --> 40:42.442
It feels like it.

40:42.863 --> 40:44.724
Wow, man, you're really riding fast.

40:44.764 --> 40:49.808
So am I. Yeah, but you're not really participating and the whole stadium doesn't see you.

40:50.569 --> 40:54.270
The lights are on the guys in this sphere, where the fireworks are.

40:55.010 --> 41:01.092
And that's the point too, is that social media can really feel like you're one of those motorcycles, but you're actually not.

41:02.092 --> 41:04.833
That is the illusion of social media.

41:05.553 --> 41:07.753
That is the illusion of Robert Malone.

41:08.194 --> 41:15.255
That's the illusion of Kevin McKernan, always talking about X, all of these people talking about X. And that's why I play it this way.

41:17.861 --> 41:28.330
Because it is really that evil if you start to think about how it is a chorus of liars that agree about this mythology and they get you to engage very vigorously in it.

41:28.751 --> 41:30.292
Get on a motorcycle yourself.

41:30.312 --> 41:35.877
Now I bring this lady up a lot and the reason why I bring this lady up a lot is because this is Australia.

41:44.738 --> 41:48.221
This is supposed to be like the UK, like Canada.

41:48.721 --> 41:57.147
These are supposed to be our allies, but they are in no way, shape or form worried about the deterioration of the American Republic.

41:57.508 --> 42:00.850
They're no way worried about the infiltration of the American government.

42:00.870 --> 42:09.037
They're no way worried about the usurping of the American military by the executive branch of the government.

42:09.397 --> 42:10.838
They're not worried at all about

42:11.278 --> 42:21.706
non-governmental organizations or multinational corporations that have untold influence on the American government or contractors or the intelligence agencies.

42:22.567 --> 42:23.988
They want to make fun of it.

42:25.489 --> 42:32.355
And that should be something that everyone in America, when they see this on YouTube, should be like, wait, why are they doing this?

42:34.476 --> 42:39.000
Why aren't they trying to wake Americans up with, why are they laughing at us?

42:41.547 --> 42:52.272
And what I want you to do is ask the question of why is this guy on Australian news?

42:54.352 --> 42:58.174
And why is it significant that that guy is on Australian news?

43:01.936 --> 43:04.377
Well, the first reason why is because of what he says.

43:06.077 --> 43:07.738
So we can listen to that if you want.

43:08.819 --> 43:09.479
Maybe we should.

43:13.188 --> 43:14.209
Russia hysteria.

43:14.549 --> 43:19.713
President Trump has gone to, quote, extraordinary lengths to keep saying thing I've ever heard of the United States.

43:19.914 --> 43:21.075
On Blaze TV.

43:21.795 --> 43:27.280
Alex, what did you make of the Trump rally today at Madison Square Garden?

43:27.320 --> 43:28.221
He had everything.

43:28.241 --> 43:31.563
He had Dr. Phil, Elon Musk, Melania spoke.

43:32.264 --> 43:39.890
And I've got to say, Trump was in superb form and he took the opportunity to announce a brand new policy during his speech.

43:39.970 --> 43:40.611
Let's have a listen.

43:40.951 --> 43:50.350
I'm announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one.

43:50.410 --> 43:52.714
It's about time that they were recognized, right?

43:56.001 --> 44:02.350
They add so much to our country and are never spoken of, ever, ever, ever, but they're going to be spoken of now.

44:02.450 --> 44:03.591
Thank you all very much.

44:03.771 --> 44:05.794
It's a fantastic policy, Alex.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.678
It's about family, keeping families together.

44:08.718 --> 44:11.982
It's about supporting those who support their loved ones.

44:14.212 --> 44:15.293
Oh, it's a great policy.

44:15.393 --> 44:23.560
And you know, this rally was great, but my favorite part was seeing AOC and Tim Walsh react to Tony Hinchcliffe's jokes about Puerto Rico.

44:23.620 --> 44:27.063
So I just love that Donald, Donald's keeping his edge.

44:27.103 --> 44:32.288
You know, he's staying edgy, having this rally at Madison Square Garden that they're calling a Nazi rally.

44:32.348 --> 44:41.136
It's absolutely disgusting that they label it that, but I think that this was a very monumental and powerful event, and it was awesome to watch it on Twitter and X, excuse me.

44:41.935 --> 44:46.240
Awesome to watch it on Twitter and X, excuse me.

44:47.341 --> 44:56.432
So what I'm suggesting to you is, is that these people are probably employed by X. X being this military program.

44:57.520 --> 45:08.506
that is being rolled out primarily to control the American public and American opinion, and its muscles are being flexed right now to try and get Donald Trump elected.

45:08.546 --> 45:25.416
And so for the uber class, the over class, the people that are really running the show on the weaponized pile of money scale, we are testing out the viability of Facebook to influence the left and X to influence the right.

45:26.584 --> 45:29.305
and X to influence, and because you can see, they know.

45:29.926 --> 45:34.348
They know if they're really using X hard on the left or hard on the right.

45:34.788 --> 45:38.670
They know if they're really using Facebook hard on the left or hard on the right.

45:39.050 --> 45:41.191
They know what they're doing with Discord groups.

45:41.231 --> 45:43.192
They know what they're doing with Telegram groups.

45:43.632 --> 45:53.577
And if there is a table meeting, this is a coordination of the deployment and the ongoing use of military tools.

45:55.222 --> 46:10.437
And so when he says Twitter in this video in 2024 about the Trump rally, and Kevin McKernan says Twitter three times on the Vance Crowe podcast, three months in a row, every time he's on in 2020, it's not by accident.

46:14.577 --> 46:31.141
We have been played into believing that Twitter was censored and then rescued and is now free speech and is the source and the place of this debate and where people are getting burnt and liberal tears are distilled into their finest form.

46:33.382 --> 46:37.763
And I assure you that simultaneously on Facebook, the exact opposite is happening.

46:39.824 --> 46:44.450
with the exact level of military precision that it's occurring here.

46:46.753 --> 46:48.675
And on YouTube and everywhere else.

46:51.278 --> 46:55.243
The reason why I'm so confident of that is because you can go back in the timeframe.

46:56.990 --> 46:58.172
Alrighty, well.

46:58.412 --> 47:01.015
And we can listen to Dr. Malone in 2021.

47:01.255 --> 47:02.196
You still rock.

47:03.077 --> 47:04.439
All right.

47:04.599 --> 47:14.550
The question I have for you is, do you find it strange that after I mean, the virus is

47:17.142 --> 47:24.905
It is basically a man-made virus used for, some people call it warfare.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.626
Okay, we can deal with that word.

47:27.886 --> 47:29.227
And it was released.

47:29.827 --> 47:39.411
Do you find it strange that Fauci and the rest of the fun bunch really disavowed themselves from it?

48:06.874 --> 48:35.521
we're gonna get the bottom of this right away and then it has been nothing but crickets chirping ever said but i swear after he did that i thought his face get long ever since he just seems to have kind of gotten grim you know this uh... you know this is like did he finally get access to the kennedy uh... you know notes uh... it it sure looks like

48:36.914 --> 48:39.855
He had a come to Jesus moment and he didn't like it very much.

48:42.115 --> 48:43.796
There's a few things I'd like to point out.

48:43.836 --> 48:45.376
This is in 2021.

48:46.716 --> 48:49.597
So this is kind of during the rollout in August.

48:49.637 --> 48:57.559
This is one month after he was on the Brett Weinstein podcast with great concern and seriousness.

48:59.079 --> 49:03.220
Now he can't get those smile off of his face, I guess because Daryl's really funny or something.

49:04.981 --> 49:05.981
Uh, and, uh,

49:06.687 --> 49:18.636
Um, I mean, many of my peers are increasingly of the opinion that this has hallmarks of a product of gain of function research.

49:20.077 --> 49:24.860
The thing that I can't, which is a fancy way of saying lab manufactured.

49:26.781 --> 49:31.885
The thing I can't sort out, and I don't know if we're ever gonna be able to sort it out, is

49:32.540 --> 49:35.102
Did this sneak out the back door in Wuhan?

49:35.382 --> 49:46.852
And yes, the signs are that both my friends at DOD and the good Dr. Fauci were told that you cannot do gain-of-function research.

49:46.952 --> 49:47.693
It's illegal.

49:49.014 --> 49:53.157
And so they kind of pivoted and said, oh, that's OK.

49:53.477 --> 49:55.339
We're going to let the Chinese do it for us.

49:55.779 --> 49:56.760
That makes a lot of sense.

49:57.220 --> 49:59.142
And we're going to send them a bunch of money to do it.

50:01.874 --> 50:05.377
So those breadcrumbs exist.

50:06.438 --> 50:10.040
So gain-of-function research in coronaviruses definitely happened.

50:11.161 --> 50:13.503
Is this the product of that gain-of-function research?

50:14.043 --> 50:20.288
This is another one of those, it looks like a duck, it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, but how can you ever prove it's a duck?

50:20.628 --> 50:23.611
Maybe it's a pigeon, but it sure looks like a duck.

50:24.131 --> 50:31.697
And the thing I can't sort out, and I don't know if anybody can, is did it escape out the back door at the Wuhan lab

50:32.461 --> 50:34.161
you know, bite and fill in the blank.

50:34.181 --> 50:35.562
There's a number of ways that could happen.

50:36.102 --> 50:43.364
There was an event in the laboratory and people got infected and then they walked around and spread it because it has a long prodrome period.

50:44.484 --> 50:50.826
Was somebody selling dead carcasses from laboratory animals out the back door to go to the seafood market?

50:51.706 --> 50:59.328
Could be, um, you know, or, or, you know, animals off experiment, that kind of thing totally makes sense.

50:59.868 --> 51:01.609
Having worked at a primate research center,

51:02.438 --> 51:09.226
You know, there's always interest in recycling lab animals after they've been used in any way you can.

51:09.946 --> 51:15.473
And if it was a country like China, where you got people eating, you know, buying.

51:15.713 --> 51:22.340
Is he suggesting that in American primate labs, they are recycling the primates for other uses?

51:23.353 --> 51:28.635
because that seems to be a fairly bold claim to just kind of throw out there.

51:28.695 --> 51:30.615
So it makes sense that the Chinese would do it.

51:30.995 --> 51:32.356
That's just funny to me.

51:33.776 --> 51:35.077
Live animals in a market.

51:35.857 --> 51:41.238
It's located just a couple of blocks from the Fire Apology Institute.

51:41.699 --> 51:43.379
I kind of, why wouldn't that happen?

51:43.399 --> 51:44.800
You'd expect it to happen almost.

51:45.620 --> 51:48.201
They'd have to have pretty tight controls to keep it from happening.

51:48.601 --> 51:52.602
You know, the janitor, right?

51:53.158 --> 51:55.239
You know, looks at looks at this collection.

51:55.319 --> 52:00.202
It's all like, hey, I can make an extra buck or yen or whatever the monetary thing is.

52:00.703 --> 52:02.384
And, you know, how can you say this wouldn't happen?

52:02.864 --> 52:04.525
The other thing that could have happened.

52:05.366 --> 52:07.787
And you mentioned the word biowarfare or bioweapons.

52:09.048 --> 52:15.732
There's no way to rule out that somebody didn't let this puppy loose intentionally.

52:16.713 --> 52:20.355
And who would have let who would want to let loose an agent

52:21.189 --> 52:29.174
in the literally beating industrial heart of China, I doubt it was the People's Republic of China.

52:30.075 --> 52:45.065
So I can't resolve these different... So a guy who works for DITRA, and who will later in this program be shown to have supposedly been vetted for possibly running U.S.

52:45.245 --> 52:45.525
AMRID,

52:47.384 --> 52:52.746
is now suggesting that the American government might have released the virus in China.

52:52.786 --> 53:02.369
And he's going to say that because we thought China spent billions of dollars every year on an infrastructure to contain viruses, we thought it would stay within their borders.

53:04.730 --> 53:12.753
This is in August of 2021, where this pink line is now, and we are in 2024 over here, in case you're unaware of the calendar.

53:14.053 --> 53:16.294
Potential ways that this agent could have got loose?

53:16.826 --> 53:30.497
But the Furing-Cleavage site and some of the other sites, whether or not there's an HIV sequence in there, it looks an awful lot like something that came out of laboratory research.

53:32.919 --> 53:36.902
But in a sense, it kind of doesn't matter, because here we are.

53:37.883 --> 53:38.884
It's gone worldwide.

53:39.745 --> 53:44.689
Now, one of the things about this, all the- He was about to say endemic, but he didn't actually say it.

53:44.709 --> 53:46.290
But it's gone worldwide, here we are.

53:47.603 --> 53:57.270
issue about what happened in Wuhan is that I had this colleague that I've published with before who works for one of our three-letter agencies in the government.

53:58.151 --> 54:05.115
And early on, he assured me that this absolutely was not a lab leak and it was not an engineered virus.

54:05.676 --> 54:06.216
Absolutely.

54:06.657 --> 54:11.580
He said, my guys have looked at it carefully and it has none of the signs of being engineered.

54:12.200 --> 54:17.124
Well, he said that so early in the outbreak that that in and of itself was a little odd.

54:19.084 --> 54:37.597
And he told me this story that the Chinese had this amazing infrastructure that they'd spilt over a billion a year on For years and years after the SARS outbreak Designed to contain any stars like virus whole bunch of infrastructure now clearly that didn't work.

54:37.637 --> 54:47.784
So good It's like to imagine a line in France to keep the German tanks away you remember how well that worked but they thought they had this and we thought they had this too and

54:48.703 --> 54:48.883
Right.

54:49.003 --> 55:01.011
So so one could imagine a scenario wherein an agent was released with the full expectation that it would damage the Chinese economy, but they would keep it in check.

55:02.552 --> 55:04.293
So did that happen?

55:05.073 --> 55:05.453
I don't know.

55:06.354 --> 55:07.214
It's a possibility.

55:07.695 --> 55:10.677
The other thing about this, as you mentioned, Daryl, is that.

55:12.558 --> 55:16.200
I've mentioned the treaty that we have with most nations.

55:17.529 --> 55:23.353
In which we agree that we're not going to produce lethal biowarfare agents and just deploy them.

55:23.393 --> 55:24.174
We shut all that down.

55:24.214 --> 55:24.855
We used to do it.

55:25.495 --> 55:28.137
We developed some of the most lethal in the world.

55:28.818 --> 55:29.718
World never seen before.

55:29.838 --> 55:31.139
We actually tested them in the field.

55:31.179 --> 55:32.480
That's no longer classified.

55:33.121 --> 55:34.182
Yeah, so I can mention it.

55:34.322 --> 55:34.602
Okay.

55:35.182 --> 55:40.146
We developed some really nasty stuff in the 60s that worked like gangbusters.

55:41.447 --> 55:42.388
But, um,

55:43.396 --> 55:47.805
But then we signed this treaty with the Soviet Union and others saying that we wouldn't do it and they wouldn't do it.

55:48.767 --> 55:54.198
But what the treaty doesn't say is that you can't develop and deploy what are called incapacitating agents.

55:54.929 --> 55:57.050
These are things that make you so sick.

55:57.090 --> 56:07.374
Now, incapacitating agent was a term that Kevin McCairn and Paul Cottrell and a few other clowns at the beginning of 2020 were already using.

56:07.434 --> 56:14.777
And I suspect it's because they were directed by or given a script written by the table that that that Robert Malone sits at.

56:15.657 --> 56:23.360
I don't know if it's a DITRA table or or a DOD table or a State Department table or I don't know what Seaburn table.

56:23.861 --> 56:24.381
You tell me.

56:25.498 --> 56:35.982
All I know is that the congruity, the consistency between the narrative of all these meddlers that I've come in contact with over five years is extraordinary.

56:36.723 --> 56:44.786
There's just no way to explain the vocabulary lining up, the ideas lining up, the chronology lining up.

56:45.450 --> 57:06.663
The way that all of these people approached me in groups of three or so, it was all the same nonsense over and over and over again, always trying to get me back into the hamster wheel of the lab leak hypothesis and the biology of gain of function viruses with the right fear and cleavage site in them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

57:08.203 --> 57:20.974
And these are all parts of a limited spectrum of debate that as long as you agree that those motorcycles riding around over there are risking their lives and we don't have to do anything, then I guess everything is solved.

57:21.935 --> 57:30.383
And even if you get on a motorcycle and go and learn enough to ride in that sphere with them, you're still not actually going to win the race.

57:30.943 --> 57:31.604
You're going nowhere.

57:32.768 --> 57:41.864
even if everybody cheers, even if they cheer repeatedly when you come out of the sphere, when you go back in the sphere and come out of the sphere, you're still not really going anywhere and you're not winning any races.

57:42.325 --> 57:43.167
And that's the point.

57:44.972 --> 57:48.994
Now, it becomes very significant to me to just point out a few things.

57:49.054 --> 58:05.204
If we go back to 2020, or sorry, go back to go to the end of 2022, and I show you that Robert Malone is streaming on the Tommy Podcast, this is 8-17-2022, with a guy by the name of Roger Hodgkinson.

58:06.556 --> 58:07.757
somebody that won't talk to me.

58:08.478 --> 58:11.541
Roger Hodgkinson is a very interesting fellow.

58:11.661 --> 58:15.344
And 95 to 99% is Jill's quoting the latest study.

58:17.086 --> 58:25.353
Here he is on the Tommy podcast with Robert Malone talking about monkey pox, actually with Jill Glasspool Malone in the background correcting his statistics.

58:25.893 --> 58:27.395
And they're having a debate about this.

58:27.975 --> 58:32.900
And he's calling him the professor and giving him props as being smart and having insight.

58:34.795 --> 58:36.556
into what's going on with Monkeypox.

58:36.596 --> 58:37.836
This is in 2022.

58:37.896 --> 58:39.016
You can see the pink line.

58:39.056 --> 58:44.458
I've turned the other one over here blue for the, the, the, the one that we watched previously.

58:44.998 --> 58:54.601
So now we go a year, a whole year ahead in August the next year, and he's on stream with Tommy and Monkeypox and Roger Hodgkinson's.

58:54.681 --> 58:55.702
Why is this important?

58:55.762 --> 59:00.363
Well, if you go back even farther now, and I, now I'm going to show you that

59:00.703 --> 59:06.927
If we go back here to Michael Palmer now, we're going to look at this, this pink thing should have been there already from the first video.

59:07.427 --> 59:08.908
So now we have the blue one.

59:09.748 --> 59:12.430
We have the yellow one, which is Roger Hodgkinson.

59:12.450 --> 59:15.172
I just showed you in 2022, one year later.

59:15.652 --> 59:25.178
And then in January of 2023, actually, Michael Palmer is on stage with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Aseem Malhotra, and Soph's mom in Sweden.

59:25.958 --> 59:27.279
Now, why is this interesting?

59:27.779 --> 59:28.980
Because Michael Palmer,

59:31.064 --> 59:43.351
is the head of what is called the Doctors for COVID Ethics, which is a different group than the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International, which is the group that has had me speak five times.

59:44.352 --> 59:50.796
But interestingly, if we go back to 2020, we will find the Doctors for COVID Ethics is actually one group.

59:53.626 --> 01:00:06.589
It's one group that had both Roger Hodgkinson and Michael Palmer in it, and Stephen Frost, and myself, and Sukrit Bhakti, and Wolfgang Wodach, all of them.

01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:12.590
Because the first meeting of Doctors for COVID Ethics that I went to in 2020, they were all there.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:21.472
And I was just so moved that I got to click on a Zoom meeting, and in the same window was Sukrit Bhakti, and, and,

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:24.872
Wolfgang Wodach.

01:00:24.932 --> 01:00:25.793
I was freaking out.

01:00:27.194 --> 01:00:31.298
And a couple months later, I don't know the exact timeframe, although it would be in my notebooks.

01:00:31.358 --> 01:00:32.259
And so I could find it.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:34.081
I just didn't get it ready for this stream.

01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:39.926
At some point, the Doctors for COVID Ethics split into two groups.

01:00:42.088 --> 01:00:45.271
Doctors for COVID Ethics is still headed by Michael Palmer.

01:00:48.214 --> 01:00:49.035
And the other group

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:56.612
The one that Stephen Frost now runs, the original starter of the group is called Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International.

01:00:57.633 --> 01:00:58.673
And this guy just left.

01:00:59.634 --> 01:01:09.077
But this guy and this guy were the source of the fracturing and the fighting because this guy was pissed that this guy was the head of the group.

01:01:09.157 --> 01:01:14.760
And this guy has a book about saying that nuclear weapons are fake on the internet archive.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.561
And that makes him unqualified to be the head of this group.

01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:18.321
I'm out of here.

01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:20.809
And the group exploded.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:26.797
It was a disaster because he was sending mails and trying to get people to leave and get out.

01:01:28.699 --> 01:01:30.221
He's a liar and this kind of thing.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:39.546
And so the reason why there are two groups for Doctors for COVID Ethics can be directly tied to people that have both been promoted by Robert Malone.

01:01:40.266 --> 01:01:51.694
One who flew to Sweden to meet with Asim and Meryl and Sasha and Robert in Sweden and be on stage with them.

01:01:51.754 --> 01:02:00.681
And one of them was promoted recently in the last couple of years on Tommy podcast with Robert Malone about monkeypox.

01:02:04.482 --> 01:02:09.786
What I'm suggesting to you is, ladies and gentlemen, is that Robert Malone is a red thread that unites all of these people.

01:02:09.946 --> 01:02:21.735
And it's because it is very likely that DITRA and the State Department are intimately involved in coordinating the narrative that is being slowly titrated.

01:02:21.795 --> 01:02:28.921
Here you see one of a couple examples of Robert Malone on the Tommy podcast with Stephen Hatfill

01:02:30.384 --> 01:02:37.869
who used to work for US Amarid, who was actually the original suspect for the leak of anthrax in 2001 after 9-11.

01:02:41.112 --> 01:02:48.157
Was also intimately involved with the original outbreak of Ebola, maybe the original deployment of it.

01:02:50.698 --> 01:02:55.642
And was also on stage with Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Nick Hudson,

01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:09.015
Denny Rancor, all of them, and nowhere else than Budapest, Romania, in November of 2023, at the fourth or fifth COVID summit.

01:03:09.115 --> 01:03:09.655
Why?

01:03:12.396 --> 01:03:14.456
Why all the same people all the time?

01:03:14.496 --> 01:03:17.457
Bret Weinstein was there too, in Romania, of all places.

01:03:17.557 --> 01:03:22.458
Wacky, huh?

01:03:22.478 --> 01:03:22.998
Let's listen.

01:03:26.879 --> 01:03:28.059
What's your crystal ball say?

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:30.856
Look, there's four things we should have been doing right away.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.065
One, we have 20,000 pharmaceutical compounds.

01:03:37.162 --> 01:03:38.722
Let's start testing these for antiviral property.

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:42.043
Who would know that spironolactone actually inhibits cytomegalovirus?

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:48.005
Amen, exactly what I started doing at DITRA in January of 2020.

01:03:48.065 --> 01:03:51.986
We are completely aligned and that was built on work that I had done.

01:03:52.006 --> 01:03:55.847
I'm going to share another name that will cause you to blanch, Sina Bhavari.

01:03:57.147 --> 01:04:02.769
But I had worked with Sina during Zika when they had a functional high throughput screening lab.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:16.541
And so now you need to understand, you need to understand that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was stated and printed in publications that Ditra had a program called Domane, D-O-M-A-N-E.

01:04:18.803 --> 01:04:22.144
And Robert Malone claims to have been the guy that spun that team up.

01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:27.447
And that within three weeks, he had screened the entire pharmaceutical catalog.

01:04:27.487 --> 01:04:29.307
He told that to Tommy and many other people.

01:04:29.968 --> 01:04:45.594
And the entire pharmaceutical catalog of the FDA against two proteins in the virus, and identified four drugs that needed to be fast-tracked into clinical trials, including famotidine, remdesivir, ivermectin, and silicoxib.

01:04:46.892 --> 01:04:52.653
The same basic list that was promoted on the Bret Weinstein podcast in 2021 of June 2021.

01:04:54.094 --> 01:04:59.615
Now this is in 2023, but it's still very important to see this is a year or more than a year ago.

01:04:59.635 --> 01:05:03.316
And it's the second podcast with him, I think.

01:05:03.396 --> 01:05:06.377
But anyway, listen to what he says and what he says in reaction to

01:05:07.916 --> 01:05:10.657
Steven Hatfield saying, we should have gone with repurposed drugs.

01:05:10.917 --> 01:05:11.637
That has been gutted.

01:05:11.837 --> 01:05:12.117
Why?

01:05:12.857 --> 01:05:13.377
Why was it gutted?

01:05:13.537 --> 01:05:14.257
Yeah.

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.877
Well, part, I know, I know backstory on that.

01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:16.198
Okay.

01:05:16.318 --> 01:05:19.298
And it's, it's part of, I mean, RID screwed the pooch in a lot of different ways.

01:05:19.418 --> 01:05:19.698
They did.

01:05:20.318 --> 01:05:20.578
They did.

01:05:20.658 --> 01:05:28.520
And one of the big ones was mismanaging budget and failure to report and basically exceed command, chain of command, the DITRA.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.160
They got to, they were riding high.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.540
Yeah.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.041
And, and under SENA, they thought they were pretty immune to oversight.

01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:34.941
You remember JVAP?

01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:35.741
Oh yeah.

01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:37.722
You know, that was not a bad idea.

01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:38.702
Yeah.

01:05:38.722 --> 01:05:50.407
So, so, um, that there was the, uh, clusterfrack of the air handling in the fancy new building, uh, because they had that huge foyer and they could never get the air handling right, which is kind of important if you're going to have VSO 3.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:06:00.792
Now remember on that podcast with Paul Cottrell's friends and associates in August of 2021, he was smiling and making jokes about how, I guess it must've been America,

01:06:01.232 --> 01:06:03.713
But here he's telling that he's involved.

01:06:03.773 --> 01:06:07.215
He knows all this stuff, all the air handling details of the lobby.

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:10.796
He knows all about what's going on inside the U.S.

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:14.538
government at the highest level of the biosecurity state.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:29.445
And so it's a weird place for him to be in 2023 when we just watched a video from him in 2021 where he was just casually accusing something like the American government of releasing something in China with the full expectation that China would contain it.

01:06:33.877 --> 01:06:41.439
A naive person watching the Tommy podcast might just think that these are two guys that are whistleblowing against the American government and they're doing their patriotic duty.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.281
But somebody who's been paying attention to Robert Malone for three or four years could not possibly see that.

01:06:49.602 --> 01:06:51.323
That's why I feel obligated to show you.

01:06:54.864 --> 01:06:55.124
Hi, Nate.

01:06:58.595 --> 01:06:59.135
Are you serious?

01:06:59.155 --> 01:06:59.715
I didn't know that.

01:06:59.935 --> 01:07:01.296
Oh yeah.

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:03.977
I was vetted to be chief science at DITRA at one point.

01:07:04.137 --> 01:07:05.417
I mean at RID.

01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:07.118
You would have been good.

01:07:07.878 --> 01:07:11.720
Chief science at DITRA at one point, which is kind of important if you're going to have BSL3 primates.

01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:15.690
Are you serious?

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.310
I didn't know that.

01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:23.118
No, it's a stupid joke because if you have BSL-3 primates, that's like the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

01:07:23.158 --> 01:07:26.262
Are you trying to tell me that U.S.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:35.573
Amerid built a building that couldn't keep track of the air handling well enough to be a BSL-3 laboratory and that these two guys think it's funny?

01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:43.993
even though he used to work there back in the days of 9-11 and was accused of maybe being the leaker of the anthrax.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:51.177
And this guy was vetted to run the place, but they think it's funny that they can't handle air at U.S.

01:07:51.377 --> 01:07:57.981
Amarid like we can handle air at every other major university in America, including the one that I worked in here in Pittsburgh.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.463
Our laboratory was a BSL-3 laboratory.

01:08:02.924 --> 01:08:03.264
I don't know.

01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:23.089
what a joke oh yeah oh god i was i was vetted to be chief science at uh ditra at one point he said rid uh rid um he would have been good i i would have been great yeah i would have or that they would have assassinated me um uh it was shortly after the uh

01:08:24.474 --> 01:08:30.544
all of the investigations about the anthrax, which had just gutted morale at RID, just destroyed morale.

01:08:30.984 --> 01:08:34.990
But there was that fiasco, and then there was the financial mismanagement coupled with arrogance.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:39.297
And there, I used to know the guy that was, he basically was a mole.

01:08:40.018 --> 01:08:46.384
at RID looking, I forget what his name is, he's a young former Special Forces guy, I think, that served in Afghanistan.

01:08:47.545 --> 01:08:48.667
He was there when I was.

01:08:48.867 --> 01:08:53.131
No, no, I guarantee he was a hardcore charger, kind of sergeant kind of guy.

01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:58.796
And he had basically, DITRA and the Pentagon had placed him

01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:06.030
in a strategic position at RID to follow what was going on in terms of management or mismanagement in the books and everything else.

01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:12.758
And then he filed his report, he got kicked up to the Pentagon, and they shut down RID.

01:09:12.878 --> 01:09:16.002
They lost the blow casing and they were chemically sterilizing, dumping it into the sewage.

01:09:17.023 --> 01:09:17.944
That was when they shut it down.

01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:30.240
I mean, the woman- And nursing homes all around US Emirate had sick people for a few weeks at some point around that closing time, of course, that everybody's aware of.

01:09:30.851 --> 01:09:35.594
who used to run their high throughput lab that Sina had recruited from South Korea.

01:09:35.634 --> 01:09:36.674
She was good.

01:09:36.754 --> 01:09:37.615
She left and went to Merck.

01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:41.817
But we are completely aligned.

01:09:42.418 --> 01:09:44.319
And I had made all kinds of progress.

01:09:44.379 --> 01:09:47.961
A lot of those agents have activity against multiple viruses.

01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:48.341
Yes.

01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:49.882
What's one of something, Robert?

01:09:50.622 --> 01:09:51.423
One of something is nothing.

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:52.603
What's two of something?

01:09:53.164 --> 01:09:53.424
It's one.

01:09:54.312 --> 01:10:06.541
When you've got a highly mutating RNA virus, to go after a single antigen with a vaccine, or to use a single drug, it's just... Yeah, precisely my... And so this is really a very scripted debate.

01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:18.269
It is a ridiculously untethered biological debate, assuming that RNA, if it has the right combination of bases, can go around the world faster than any other one before.

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:22.172
Because they're going around all the time, but this one's really magic.

01:10:25.345 --> 01:10:31.012
And so the agreement here in front of Tommy is really hilarious, especially if you speed it up.

01:10:31.052 --> 01:10:36.979
You can almost hear the laughter in these guys as they know that they're just full of shit.

01:10:37.139 --> 01:10:42.465
And it's funny because Tommy doesn't know and neither does his audience, but they know and they love it.

01:10:46.324 --> 01:10:57.174
When you've got a highly mutating RNA virus, to go after a single antigen with a vaccine, or to use a single drug, it's just- Yeah, precisely my- Multi-drug therapy.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:11:08.064
To use a single drug is exactly what Sina Bhavari argued with Alison Totura in the 2019 paper about a coronavirus pandemic out of a bat cave that Remdesivir would be great for.

01:11:08.804 --> 01:11:09.825
Holy shit birds.

01:11:10.663 --> 01:11:21.993
You know, that guy that he's talking about being buddies with and used to work for, he wrote a paper in 2019 that Mark has shown us over and over and over again, that I actually got in to Bobby's book.

01:11:24.255 --> 01:11:27.217
I don't think they wanted that paper in the book, but it's definitely in there.

01:11:27.237 --> 01:11:34.564
And an explanation for what it means and how dubious it is that the paper was published in 2019 is definitely in there and quoted to me.

01:11:37.054 --> 01:11:37.714
Absolutely.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:38.835
But look at the workload this is.

01:11:38.855 --> 01:11:40.095
We've got 20,000 compounds.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:44.477
We've got to test each one against 26 different viral families taking a representative virus.

01:11:45.137 --> 01:11:46.418
That's a lot of plaque assay cultures.

01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:50.760
And what we were doing is using a laser confocal high-throughput.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:59.864
He is suggesting that they would use plaque assay culturing to screen thousands and thousands of compounds for antiviral activity.

01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:02.865
This is the most absurd idea ever.

01:12:03.305 --> 01:12:11.509
And now Robert Malone is saying that he used laser scanning confocal microscopy, high throughput, you know, robot shit to do that.

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:19.353
And he's saying, you know, it's very hard because you have to have all these controls and you have to have all your cell cultures constant.

01:12:19.693 --> 01:12:21.294
There's no way to do that.

01:12:21.374 --> 01:12:22.675
Ladies and gentlemen, there isn't.

01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:41.335
There's no way for you to produce a cell culture that's so consistent and cell culturing protocols that are so consistent that you can high throughput screen thousands of compounds in a matter of weeks.

01:12:42.136 --> 01:12:47.698
No matter how many robots, no matter how many confocals you have, that's not possible.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:50.980
But that is actually what Robert Malone claims he did.

01:12:53.083 --> 01:13:09.469
And you can put that together by listening to many, many different interviews, him talking about the many times it's a combination of x-ray crystallography, a computational model of the x-ray crystallography structure of two different viral compounds, two different viral proteins.

01:13:09.929 --> 01:13:13.551
And then those x-ray crystallography models were interfaced with

01:13:14.611 --> 01:13:24.183
laser scanning confocal high throughput microscopy data using cell culture that was supposed to indicate antiviral activity.

01:13:32.106 --> 01:13:35.989
And one of the challenges is that you have to maintain your cell lines.

01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:40.453
You have to maintain multiple cell lines because each virus has its own favored host, essentially.

01:13:41.074 --> 01:13:47.599
And you have to keep them in a similar state of growth so that you have reproducibility from plate to plate to plate and all the proper internal controls.

01:13:47.899 --> 01:13:51.463
And then once you work through that stuff, which is a solvable problem, it's a question of money.

01:13:51.623 --> 01:13:53.124
It's a solvable problem.

01:13:53.164 --> 01:13:55.306
It's just a question of money and slaves, right?

01:13:56.607 --> 01:13:59.249
Come on competence and putting up the systems.

01:13:59.649 --> 01:14:03.493
Once you work through that, then the next level that you get to is looking at synergism.

01:14:03.513 --> 01:14:07.996
You know, that's a dirty word in the drug screening business, but let's say drug, drug interactions.

01:14:08.036 --> 01:14:08.236
Yeah.

01:14:08.276 --> 01:14:17.784
And suddenly suddenly you can go from a concentration to drug to drug interactions is something really interesting for ivermectin.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:37.416
Something really interesting for hydroxychloroquine, any of these drugs that could potentially interact with, oh, I don't know, any pharmaceutical that a lot of Medicare patients are on, could be a really easy way to do stuff.

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:46.220
Maybe there's interactions, synergy between Paxlovid or Mopulvanir.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:55.055
and some of the pharmaceuticals that many, many, many Medicare patients are on.

01:14:55.876 --> 01:15:09.065
Maybe there's some synergistic interaction between the injections for shingles, or the injections for pneumonia, or the injections for RSV that they are pushing now on our old people.

01:15:09.646 --> 01:15:11.467
Let's not talk about that, right?

01:15:13.305 --> 01:15:16.368
minus three molar to 10 to the minus six or 10 to the minus seven when you're adding in other things.

01:15:16.408 --> 01:15:18.329
And that starts getting interesting.

01:15:18.589 --> 01:15:21.132
And it is absolutely all doable and it's the kind of stuff.

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:22.533
So this is what we started doing.

01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.715
And I talked to Callahan about it early on January of 2020.

01:15:26.156 --> 01:15:29.459
And he said to me, Robert, we've had all the big pharma come through.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.441
We, you know, the big we, I assume that the we were talking.

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:36.885
He's talking about Callahan, the CIA guy that called him and said, it's definitely not a lab leak.

01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:43.849
is also gonna tell him that, you know, the pharmaceutical companies are way ahead of you, you'll never beat them.

01:15:43.889 --> 01:15:47.371
Talking about in this context is agency-related.

01:15:48.272 --> 01:15:52.575
We've had all the big drug companies come through and there is no way you can compete with them.

01:15:53.595 --> 01:15:58.519
And within about a month and a half, we had multiple agents, not the least of which was from Modadine.

01:15:58.899 --> 01:16:00.840
And a month and a half, they had a few agents.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:07.385
It was actually three weeks on the Bret Weinstein podcast and three weeks when he was talking to Paul Cutrell, but you can check that yourself.

01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:13.499
And the thing is also in this space, there's some, there's some real challenges there are libraries of millions to billions of compounds.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.402
Yeah.

01:16:14.782 --> 01:16:15.604
And the challenges.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.561
maintaining those.

01:16:17.601 --> 01:16:21.485
So they all have integrity because they got to be stored under inert gas and frozen and blah, blah, blah.

01:16:21.765 --> 01:16:29.794
Millions, if not billions of compounds stored under inert gas in a big room with all labels on it.

01:16:29.874 --> 01:16:35.239
And some dude that goes around with a big ladder and pulls the sample that you want out of the library.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.522
What in the hell is he talking about?

01:16:40.473 --> 01:16:42.716
It's not a small challenge, but it's absolutely doable.

01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:49.986
And when I heard all this jibber jabber about warp speed, et cetera, I thought... So here's a list of 20,000 chemicals.

01:16:50.046 --> 01:16:55.533
I need you to order enough so that we can screen those chemicals on this very, very big...

01:16:58.175 --> 01:17:00.876
incubator of cell culture that's all perfectly the same.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:05.859
So we have this big incubator of cell cultures that are always perfectly the same.

01:17:05.879 --> 01:17:11.461
And then we have this huge truck full of of chemicals that we're going to bring in.

01:17:11.882 --> 01:17:22.207
And then I want you to put them together in your incubator over the next couple weeks and record all of the cytotoxic effects and not using the laser scanning confocal in the other room.

01:17:22.607 --> 01:17:23.968
And in a few weeks, we'll be done.

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:27.725
That's the kind of bullshit story that he's telling right now.

01:17:30.507 --> 01:17:39.734
Not one drug or two drugs, he's talking about thousands, and then he said millions, billions, he said, millions, billions of compounds, he said, stored under inert gas.

01:17:40.295 --> 01:17:42.436
What kind of bullshit story is this?

01:17:42.957 --> 01:17:44.478
How dumb do they think we are?

01:17:48.925 --> 01:18:00.471
And that operation at NIH that they set up with the new funds that was supposed to be their new technical group, I forget what they called it, they started doing this and they got shut down.

01:18:02.632 --> 01:18:06.634
We're not trying to rule out the pharmaceutical companies because there will be some viruses where

01:18:08.022 --> 01:18:08.823
we're having a lack.

01:18:09.503 --> 01:18:13.485
Fine, that narrows the targets down for the pharmaceutical manufacturers to come up with something against those.

01:18:13.785 --> 01:18:15.206
Yeah, but the truth is Stephen, you know it.

01:18:15.686 --> 01:18:17.307
The pharma is not the innovators here.

01:18:17.547 --> 01:18:18.707
No.

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.968
The IDD 2801 was Emory Institute, right?

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:21.869
Yeah.

01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:25.571
Oh, it's funny to make inside jokes, isn't it?

01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:34.555
Because it just feels like you're privy to something and what you can understand, hmm, laboratory leak, wow, mistakes, huh, crazy.

01:18:37.417 --> 01:18:39.699
They got sold and they got sold again.

01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:43.261
And then suddenly we had the new miracle drug for coronavirus.

01:18:44.702 --> 01:18:47.964
The innovation is absolutely not coming out of pharma.

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:49.345
That is- Would you give it to Lawrence Livermore?

01:18:49.365 --> 01:18:50.405
Who would you give it to?

01:18:50.446 --> 01:18:51.546
Actually, I like Lawrence Livermore a lot.

01:18:51.586 --> 01:18:52.407
I like Lawrence Livermore.

01:18:53.127 --> 01:18:54.629
They seem to have integrity.

01:18:55.810 --> 01:19:02.577
And so the debate about what laboratory to give it to and all this, this is also just makes it feel like, wow, I'm really listening to something pretty cool.

01:19:02.897 --> 01:19:06.541
I'll have to look up that Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, running that VMAP program.

01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:07.281
That's pretty cool.

01:19:07.822 --> 01:19:08.062
Wow.

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.805
These guys are awesome.

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:15.269
What I ended up doing, because it was feasible, was directing money towards Lincoln Lab.

01:19:16.055 --> 01:19:26.297
Because there's a guy there, Daryl Rickey, that is really good, both in terms of... He's published with him a few times and he's supposedly on this Ditra team or something like that.

01:19:26.357 --> 01:19:26.677
I don't know.

01:19:26.737 --> 01:19:28.017
It's really weird plug here.

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:29.858
So why is this important?

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.198
Well, let's go forward.

01:19:31.278 --> 01:19:32.618
Remember what I'm trying to say.

01:19:33.118 --> 01:19:35.299
These people are all part of the same show.

01:19:35.959 --> 01:19:36.979
So what do we have here?

01:19:36.999 --> 01:19:39.100
Well, here's a video from 2023.

01:19:42.023 --> 01:19:45.366
It's got this guy in it talking about VR goggles and bugs.

01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:47.067
Oh, you're in for a treat tonight.

01:19:48.448 --> 01:19:49.649
Celebrities in the house.

01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:56.234
They pretend to care about you, but actually it's these people who are also pretending to care about you.

01:19:56.774 --> 01:19:59.757
Pretending to rise as a dissident movement.

01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:02.913
And this whole video is an admission.

01:20:03.013 --> 01:20:03.373
Why?

01:20:04.094 --> 01:20:07.895
Because there's no other way to explain how all of these people are in the same video.

01:20:07.935 --> 01:20:11.337
And I'm going to pause it on the certain people that I think are impossible to explain.

01:20:11.397 --> 01:20:12.498
Number one is Aaron.

01:20:13.649 --> 01:20:33.617
That is the nurse that came out at the beginning of the pandemic with journeyman pictures to say that something crazy was happening in New York and that they were mixing COVID and non-COVID patients, controlling the debate around what was going on in New York City, not that dissimilar from Kyle Seidel and not that dissimilar from Pierre Kory.

01:20:36.348 --> 01:20:52.492
There's no way to explain why this woman who moved from Wisconsin to Florida before the pandemic and started two separate anti-vaccine non-profits before, I guess, going to New York and rushing into the fire just like Pierre Kory did.

01:20:52.512 --> 01:20:59.854
There's no way to explain why she is in this music video other than this was always part of the military operation.

01:21:01.783 --> 01:21:07.928
There's also no way to explain why some of these other people are in this video, other than it's a military operation.

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:20.437
Now, you remember that I started this little discussion with that guy in Australia who was on the news program talking about how crazy it is in America, and he's an American.

01:21:21.258 --> 01:21:22.118
Here's Robert Malone.

01:21:22.639 --> 01:21:24.280
There's Aaron again in the background.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.204
We're soon going to see Jill Glasspool Malone, who this guy is from, there we go.

01:21:30.264 --> 01:21:31.085
We can pause there.

01:21:35.782 --> 01:21:37.194
And so we can pause on Luke.

01:21:38.237 --> 01:21:45.579
because Luke was started in 2008 in the Wall Street thing also with Tim Pool.

01:21:46.119 --> 01:21:49.420
And so we can stop there and then we can stop at Jill Glasspool Malone.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:22:06.785
So a person who is closely associated with Tim Pool started at the same time basically in this alternative media has Tim Pool rising out of 9-11 and rising out of 2008 and the financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street.

01:22:09.372 --> 01:22:21.082
is now seemingly here with, why is Jill Glass Poole Malone even in this unless her ego is bigger than it should be as a pseudo hero or somebody that used to be a Democrat or not.

01:22:21.442 --> 01:22:25.406
Her history and her father and his father are so ridiculous.

01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:29.529
And now they're in a music video.

01:22:29.569 --> 01:22:37.436
They were in a musical just a few weeks ago with Mickey Willis, who was at the start of the pandemic doing exactly the same thing as this now.

01:22:40.751 --> 01:22:42.052
And who else is in this video?

01:22:42.092 --> 01:22:49.395
Who's gonna come bursting through the door in this video is of course, none other than that Stein character.

01:22:51.576 --> 01:22:54.357
The character that's on Australian news.

01:22:54.457 --> 01:22:55.958
Why is he on Australian news?

01:22:56.018 --> 01:23:02.081
Because he's part of the same theater, flying to islands to have sex.

01:23:02.181 --> 01:23:03.461
Oops, I forgot I said that.

01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:06.983
And then here comes the guy in the door and who's it gonna be?

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.260
That guy.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.080
Oops, shoot.

01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:13.181
Darn it.

01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:14.941
I wanted that.

01:23:18.742 --> 01:23:28.644
So that guy right there, that guy who's on Australian news right now, and almost exclusively on Australian news, he gets a lot of spots with that lady who's laughing at America.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:32.785
And there are people that get lots of spots on British news too.

01:23:33.902 --> 01:23:39.547
But Britain is actually, I think it feels like Britain is also being brought down with America.

01:23:41.368 --> 01:23:44.791
The British culture and the American culture are being brought down together.

01:23:44.851 --> 01:23:46.833
Maybe also the Canadian culture, I don't know.

01:23:46.973 --> 01:23:52.477
The whole idea of this sort of, I don't know.

01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:55.440
It's all coming down.

01:23:56.693 --> 01:24:08.618
and it's coming down by a coordinated operation that includes people in Australia, people on Australian news, Australian news making fun of America instead of trying to come to America's aid.

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:25.006
It's also got an awful lot of anonymous people on Twitter that are supposedly based in Australia, like Jikki Leaks that won't criticize Ditra, collaborator with Stephen Hatfield of Ebola,

01:24:26.121 --> 01:24:35.746
And Anthrax won't even acknowledge that this guy's background is less than optimal to be a guy who's supposed to be riding in on a white horse.

01:24:35.887 --> 01:24:47.613
Jiki Leaks, who hasn't even revealed his real identity yet, won't say that, but will definitely say over and over again that I'm nuts, or I'm working for somebody, or I'm working for somebody else.

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:52.576
And what you see there is the anonymous version of this bullshit.

01:24:54.386 --> 01:25:12.424
where Jiki Leakes is promoted by some people, promoted by other anonymous people, and called out and openly retweeted as a bad guy by all these people, and by Nick Hudson, and by Jessica Hockett, and Jonathan Engler outing him as Archmedic.

01:25:12.484 --> 01:25:14.466
This is all an elaborate theater

01:25:14.986 --> 01:25:18.028
where the bad guys and the good guys are both bullshitters.

01:25:18.068 --> 01:25:21.209
They're both riding motorcycles inside of this sphere.

01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:24.591
These people are riding motorcycles inside of the sphere.

01:25:24.631 --> 01:25:25.511
They're not real.

01:25:27.072 --> 01:25:31.034
Steve Kersh is riding a motorcycle very poorly inside of the sphere.

01:25:31.414 --> 01:25:32.215
They're not real.

01:25:36.152 --> 01:25:38.594
That's why I say all of them are working for the slavers.

01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:43.937
It had Dr. Phil, Elon Musk, Melania spoke.

01:25:44.237 --> 01:25:49.801
That's why we're in 2024 and all these lines can be drawn to represent all of those videos.

01:25:49.861 --> 01:26:02.929
And it's all very consistently Robert Malone going from being a insider in 2020 to a outspoken something, something in 2021 to in 2022, pretty sure it was a lab leak.

01:26:06.934 --> 01:26:10.595
And in 2023, well, you know, maybe there's something wrong with it.

01:26:10.655 --> 01:26:11.035
I don't know.

01:26:11.075 --> 01:26:13.336
It shouldn't have been for kids, but it's fine for adults.

01:26:13.356 --> 01:26:14.416
We saved a lot of people.

01:26:14.816 --> 01:26:18.997
Too bad it's contaminated now.

01:26:20.277 --> 01:26:27.459
And we're supposed to pay attention to the elections and we're supposed to keep running in their hamster wheels and be amazed by the people riding the motorcycles.

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:30.778
That's why I start with this.

01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:32.939
That's why I think it's important to see this.

01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:37.962
If you want to know more, please go to watch the Senator Ron Johnson presentation.

01:26:37.982 --> 01:26:43.466
The Dear Senator Ron Johnson presentation is probably the best presentation that I've done in a while.

01:26:43.566 --> 01:26:45.587
It really summarizes what's going on here.

01:26:46.688 --> 01:26:54.393
For sure, this is a list that everybody should print out and start to understand what I'm trying to get across with these words so that you

01:26:54.933 --> 01:27:16.124
can bring and represent these ideas yourself, especially the one about endemicity and this idea that not only was endemicity a potentiality, a biological myth that was seeded and created over a decade or so, but the idea that this went endemic is absurd because we have no data from before 2020.

01:27:18.348 --> 01:27:20.909
That's why they don't wanna talk about the murder in 2020.

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.670
They don't wanna talk about 2020 at all anymore.

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:26.911
Otherwise you might see that they are all coordinated liars.

01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:32.492
Ladies and gentlemen, we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

01:27:32.532 --> 01:27:44.956
We need more people to challenge themselves to compare it to the vaccine schedule in Norway or Sweden or the Netherlands and realize how bad it is here in America and why it's so questionable that none of these people will make that comparison.

01:27:44.996 --> 01:27:45.776
That's the easy one.

01:27:45.796 --> 01:27:46.937
It's not comparing.

01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:57.040
the old vaccine schedule to the new vaccine schedule, it is comparing our vaccine schedule to others vaccine schedule.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:08.923
That's the real one because the increase in the number of vaccines for them is the ever increasing effectiveness and the ever increasing wonders of technology.

01:28:09.003 --> 01:28:09.823
It is not

01:28:10.802 --> 01:28:16.624
the open criminal window through which all of these ridiculous products are being thrown.

01:28:17.264 --> 01:28:19.805
That would be, of course, criminal.

01:28:22.185 --> 01:28:23.746
Anyway, I don't know how that was.

01:28:23.806 --> 01:28:24.046
I don't know.

01:28:24.406 --> 01:28:25.646
I just had to do a show today.

01:28:25.686 --> 01:28:27.247
It's kind of going to be improv this week.

01:28:27.287 --> 01:28:33.009
I don't know if I'm going to be able to come on every day because there's a lot of stuff that needs to be prepared for the weekend.

01:28:33.049 --> 01:28:37.510
And I need to get ready for the weekend also for Brownstone and for the people coming.

01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:42.515
And so I know that there's a schedule up, but basketball practice is also starting.

01:28:42.555 --> 01:28:46.839
And so there's a lot of balls in the air, but I assure you, I'm going to keep juggling as best I can.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.001
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:52.185
If you liked what you saw, please go to getgoingbiological.com and find a way to support.

01:28:52.265 --> 01:28:57.791
Thank you very much to William, to Steven, to Greg, to all the people that are throwing

01:28:59.099 --> 01:29:02.901
really way more than you should throw in your own weight on our direction.

01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:12.305
Jeff from Earth, I mean, Cara, these contributors are what keep us online and what make us possible to go forward with such gusto.

01:29:12.385 --> 01:29:16.407
So please don't forget that it's made possible by viewers just like you.

01:29:16.447 --> 01:29:21.550
So if you can and you're not, I'm asking, I'm asking.

01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.871
Thanks very much, guys.

01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:23.471
See you again soon.

01:29:27.952 --> 01:29:32.523
November 3rd, November 3rd, Sunday live Bethel Park, baby.

01:29:32.543 --> 01:29:34.929
Be there, be square.

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:05.147
How's that for badass?

01:31:05.828 --> 01:31:07.351
I mean, that's badass right there.

01:31:08.433 --> 01:31:09.414
That's the shiznit.
