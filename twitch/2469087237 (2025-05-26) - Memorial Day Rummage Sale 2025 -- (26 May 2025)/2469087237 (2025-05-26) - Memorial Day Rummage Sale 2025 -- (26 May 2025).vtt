00:01.598 --> 00:02.599
I thought you liked them.

00:02.619 --> 00:03.079
I don't know.

00:03.439 --> 00:05.141
You want to get out of that shot.

00:05.161 --> 00:06.522
Okay, me or the kids?

00:07.763 --> 00:09.444
The kids should get out of the shot.

00:38.396 --> 00:41.860
They said they didn't need any?

01:27.432 --> 01:27.712
Oh, yes, please.

01:27.752 --> 01:27.952
Thank you.

01:27.972 --> 01:28.413
Yes, very nice.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.333
I also have a friend who lives here.

01:29.373 --> 01:30.114
Her name is Boyce Black.

01:30.174 --> 01:30.494
Boyce Black.

01:30.514 --> 01:30.934
Her name is Dahlia.

01:31.855 --> 01:32.616
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:32.636 --> 01:33.436
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:33.456 --> 01:34.017
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:34.037 --> 01:34.837
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:34.877 --> 01:35.938
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:35.958 --> 01:36.638
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:36.658 --> 01:37.459
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:37.479 --> 01:38.099
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:38.119 --> 01:38.840
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:38.860 --> 01:39.881
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:39.901 --> 01:40.541
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:40.561 --> 01:41.221
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:41.282 --> 01:42.142
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:42.162 --> 01:43.843
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:43.863 --> 01:45.184
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:45.304 --> 01:47.526
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:47.626 --> 01:52.089
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.250
Yes, her name is Dahlia Snow.

02:53.191 --> 03:01.255
The other blue one is a helicopter.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.856
It's called...

03:20.583 --> 03:26.645
Because of Mark, who lives here, I've met him a couple of times.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.065
He's from Cuba.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.146
He's married to a girl from Wisconsin.

03:31.266 --> 03:35.448
And I heard yesterday that he has a master's in dance.

03:35.988 --> 03:36.608
And Florida.

03:36.648 --> 03:37.968
He studied there.

03:38.168 --> 03:39.449
And then he went to Utah.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.569
Well, I took him to Texas.

03:40.589 --> 03:41.289
He liked it there.

03:41.349 --> 03:45.531
But he's not happy in the U.S.

04:25.018 --> 04:32.043
Oh yeah, that's a very neat brand that he sells at all kinds of stores.

04:32.063 --> 04:36.426
So I have a lot of information about him.

04:36.507 --> 04:40.429
I have no problem at all with the American dog.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.432
He's a really, really nice dog.

04:43.452 --> 04:48.996
He's a dog that's loved by us because he's been playing with leaves all day.

05:01.357 --> 05:02.019
Yes, yes, yes.

05:41.283 --> 05:43.286
And then if you'd like, you'll have a little spoon, baby.

06:35.692 --> 06:40.236
It looks like it was live, but I don't know if you saw me on the wheel or not.

06:43.818 --> 06:45.700
Could you see me on the wheel or no?

06:46.700 --> 06:47.741
Testing one, two.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.626
Oh, you could see me on the wheel.

06:53.686 --> 06:54.827
Good, good, good, good.

06:55.007 --> 06:55.987
Okay, great.

06:57.008 --> 06:57.649
Great.

06:59.929 --> 07:01.929
Yeah, my helmet is green though.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.450
So it's not so great for the green screen.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.270
Which is kind of annoying.

07:12.791 --> 07:16.772
I really just wanted to say Happy Memorial Day, if that's an appropriate thing to say.

07:16.792 --> 07:17.432
I don't even know.

07:18.972 --> 07:24.373
And just let everybody know that I, you know, I'm going live every day, five days a week.

07:24.673 --> 07:27.434
It's just that, you know, today's kind of a vacation day.

07:27.494 --> 07:28.914
The kids are selling lemonade.

07:30.177 --> 07:47.371
trying to get rid of some of the stuff we don't need yeah so I'm gonna take another couple spins and then maybe I'm gonna come in here and throw something on let me see what I got here in the list

07:52.901 --> 07:53.701
Yeah, I don't know.

07:53.781 --> 07:55.262
I just wanted to say hi to everybody.

07:55.302 --> 08:03.484
Maybe I'm probably just gonna look at the chat and I'll come back after a couple, a couple rounds.

08:03.904 --> 08:11.626
Maybe you can see me if you look over Fearless' shoulder and on the street on the other side there.

08:11.666 --> 08:21.069
If you look right through the green, just over the pink bicycle, you should be able to see me through there and then I'll come back around and up the hill and then

08:22.438 --> 08:23.579
I'll check on the chat.

08:23.679 --> 08:28.182
If you have any questions or something like that, put it in the chat then I guess, and I'll come back in a minute.

09:17.998 --> 09:18.658
How do you do?

09:18.918 --> 09:19.139
Oran.

09:22.420 --> 09:45.030
And tomorrow evening you're going to... Yes, tomorrow evening you're going to...

09:48.106 --> 09:53.148
Oh, and then I think, then I say that when we arrive at that house, I know that the boys can already be free.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.489
But what do you actually want to know, who knows, when we arrive?

09:56.509 --> 09:56.889
I don't know.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.410
Because, uh... I don't know.

09:59.530 --> 10:01.771
But I don't know, right?

10:01.831 --> 10:03.952
I don't know.

10:04.112 --> 10:04.332
No.

10:04.512 --> 10:09.774
Well, I at least know that the boys are already free, when we arrive.

10:09.814 --> 10:12.255
Because I know that the boys can be free.

10:12.275 --> 10:15.676
But well, that's another story.

10:26.274 --> 10:26.534
Yeah.

10:27.355 --> 10:27.595
Yeah.

10:27.635 --> 10:27.795
Yeah.

10:27.935 --> 10:28.155
Yeah.

10:55.137 --> 10:55.377
Yeah.

10:55.497 --> 10:55.917
Yeah.

10:55.997 --> 10:56.618
Yeah.

10:56.658 --> 10:57.318
Yeah.

10:57.438 --> 10:57.838
Yeah.

10:57.878 --> 10:58.378
Yeah.

10:58.398 --> 10:58.598
Yeah.

10:58.718 --> 10:59.178
Yeah.

10:59.519 --> 11:00.119
Yeah.

11:00.199 --> 11:00.439
Yeah.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.499
yeah yeah

12:41.983 --> 12:43.364
That's kind of how I feel too.

12:43.444 --> 12:48.229
It's not really a happy thing.

12:48.249 --> 12:54.775
I almost feel like when you're at these parades and they're throwing candy.

12:54.815 --> 13:00.140
They were throwing candy this morning and maybe I have to move that over a little bit.

13:08.470 --> 13:15.052
The just the throwing of candy is also just kind of, I don't know, it can kind of feel kind of lame, I guess.

13:15.312 --> 13:24.055
I'm not saying it's bad, but is that really the what, whoops, is that really what we want to be doing for Memorial Day?

13:24.155 --> 13:24.535
I don't know.

13:25.435 --> 13:26.796
I kind of agree with that as well.

13:29.793 --> 13:38.483
We sold a mini bike and two scooters, like you know, step scooters.

13:39.745 --> 13:42.027
Yeah, we got some of the stuff out of here.

13:42.047 --> 13:48.234
We got two chairs that I got from the medical school that I was super excited about when I first got them.

13:49.443 --> 13:50.803
We didn't really have room for them.

13:50.863 --> 13:54.524
I was going to get a table to match them and all this other stuff, but that all never happened.

13:55.664 --> 14:00.025
And so then they were just taking up room in different people's rooms and in the bathroom somewhere.

14:00.085 --> 14:02.966
And so we got rid of those chairs and somebody was really happy to have them.

14:03.006 --> 14:03.606
So that's cool.

14:07.287 --> 14:09.747
It's also the riding of the wheel.

14:09.827 --> 14:10.627
Thank you very much.

14:11.587 --> 14:14.528
It is because I started playing basketball again.

14:14.588 --> 14:15.748
I can ride that thing again.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.969
I got a very big wheel there.

14:21.457 --> 14:29.639
So I started riding in 2016, I think, right before we moved back to the United States.

14:29.879 --> 14:36.900
And so I was riding one of the first generation of wheels, and that was in Rotterdam.

14:36.980 --> 14:42.581
And I actually rode it back and forth from the lab for about three months or so.

14:42.601 --> 14:45.722
And at one point in time, I actually went out.

14:46.122 --> 14:47.602
This sounds nuts, but I did.

14:47.622 --> 14:49.123
I went out drinking.

14:50.463 --> 15:03.699
with the lab knowing that I had to commute back to my house on my wheel and I put my headphones in afterward turned on the music and just leaned into it and

15:04.671 --> 15:08.013
Maybe eight seconds later, I couldn't hear the beeping.

15:08.173 --> 15:12.976
I had never, never driven with the kind of aggression that I took off with.

15:13.496 --> 15:21.040
And I face planted right in the middle of a street in Rotterdam, skidded, you know, I mean, it was nasty.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.401
I was just lucky enough not to hit my face.

15:23.461 --> 15:24.862
I didn't have a helmet on or anything.

15:26.223 --> 15:28.924
Because it was a smaller wheel, you know, whatever.

15:28.964 --> 15:31.686
I'm only going 17 miles an hour, but if that wheel

15:33.456 --> 15:52.754
under or overpowers it'll it just kills it just dies and so then you just fall on your face so um the wheel that i'm riding is called a sherman i think um and i got it about three years ago um four years ago did i get it during the pandemic i can't remember anymore how long i've had it

15:53.862 --> 15:56.683
But I wasn't riding it a lot because it's a heavy wheel.

15:56.763 --> 15:58.343
It's got a huge battery in it.

15:58.383 --> 16:00.643
You can run like a hundred miles on it.

16:01.123 --> 16:14.046
But if you want to ride a wheel for a hundred miles, not only do you have to have good core strength, but your feet, your feet, the ball, the arch of your foot needs to be so strong because you're kind of balancing on your toes all the time.

16:14.106 --> 16:20.467
Your heel is on the bottom when you're slowing down, but most of the time you're right at the balance point of your heel.

16:21.227 --> 16:29.294
Pushing on those things and keeping it pinned against one leg if you're going fast enough And so that's a pretty advanced wheel if I could be so bold.

16:29.354 --> 16:50.090
It's hard to ride really slow That's why I'm practicing riding slow all the time and It's been a plan of mine for a long time to start shooting little little biology videos on that wheel And so now I'm just kind of letting the neighbors know that I'm here And I've been practicing for the last few weeks now that I've been

16:51.953 --> 16:53.534
So much in the basketball gym.

16:54.454 --> 16:57.156
My feet are better, my legs are better, my back is better.

16:57.176 --> 17:01.599
And so I feel pretty comfortable on it now actually.

17:01.619 --> 17:02.219
I'm really happy.

17:02.239 --> 17:05.522
It's one of those things you definitely don't forget how to do.

17:06.322 --> 17:08.183
So it's a fun thing.

17:10.225 --> 17:11.686
Install and relaunch.

17:13.687 --> 17:13.967
Yes.

17:14.688 --> 17:18.190
I don't know if it's going to mess up the stream or not if I do that, but I'm going to do it anyway.

17:23.081 --> 17:25.463
I don't see any other questions in the chat.

17:25.523 --> 17:27.524
I just thought I would say hello again.

17:27.564 --> 17:30.225
This is not, I don't have any planned today.

17:32.067 --> 17:43.834
We have all the kids home and there's also my neighbor's kids are over here and so they're having a lemonade stand.

17:43.874 --> 17:44.754
It's been pretty busy.

17:46.035 --> 17:49.177
Mikey is out in front barking at everybody and so it's kind of

17:49.738 --> 17:53.921
A lot of balls to juggle today, so I probably won't put together a formal show.

17:55.823 --> 17:58.525
But I thought I would at least say hello.

17:58.585 --> 18:00.847
Yes, we also made a lot of room here.

18:01.067 --> 18:15.119
I'm getting rid of one mini bike and a couple of these scooters and a couple of these chairs and a tremendous amount of room has been cleared up in our basement in my garage.

18:15.139 --> 18:16.060
So that's really great.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.922
I have a lot of electronics that nobody's buying.

18:20.221 --> 18:23.303
Um, but yeah, it's, it's good.

18:23.343 --> 18:27.385
We also kind of, you know, had to make that choice of what is our, what do we have right now?

18:27.465 --> 18:28.485
What do we want right now?

18:29.426 --> 18:34.529
Um, and this was also going to be a test stream because I wanted to see what else I could pull off.

18:35.129 --> 18:37.730
Um, so I'm going to check, test a few other things.

18:38.411 --> 18:44.934
And again, if you have any questions you want me to answer or address, um, just put them in the chat and I'll see what I can do when I get back.

18:53.916 --> 19:08.967
What I was thinking about doing is seeing how much remote sound I can get from how far I can go because I can test it and talk while I test it, which is what I want to do now.

19:12.350 --> 19:16.973
So I'll set that all up and then I'll see if I can test that out.

19:19.095 --> 19:20.536
I need this one.

19:56.758 --> 20:07.045
So this will be neat because what I've got here is a mic that I had set up from... Somebody gave me these.

20:10.407 --> 20:11.287
The remote mics.

20:12.148 --> 20:14.850
A guy by the name of Alan from Canada.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.052
And I've used these for the basketball court.

20:18.132 --> 20:20.333
They were absolutely fantastic mics.

20:20.794 --> 20:22.254
And so I'm going to use one now.

20:23.575 --> 20:24.416
See where it gets me.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.176
Testing 1, 2.

20:38.182 --> 20:40.164
Testing 1, 2, test.

20:40.764 --> 20:44.628
See that should... Testing 1, 2, test.

20:45.569 --> 20:46.510
See, I can do that.

20:48.833 --> 20:49.473
Is that working?

20:50.074 --> 20:52.376
Now there might have been a slight echo, but now there shouldn't be.

20:55.213 --> 20:59.077
There might have been one when I had it like this, there should be a slight echo.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.738
Maybe I have to put my headphones in.

21:00.859 --> 21:01.559
Hold on one second.

21:04.662 --> 21:09.647
Because this remote mic, test one, two, testing one, two, test.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.910
Test one, two, testing one, two, test.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.012
Test one, two.

21:15.954 --> 21:17.135
Testing one, two, test.

21:30.526 --> 21:31.606
So that would be there.

21:32.507 --> 21:33.607
So this isn't going to do anything.

21:33.707 --> 21:34.067
Test 1, 2.

21:34.507 --> 21:34.827
Test 1, 2.

21:37.208 --> 21:37.988
Test, test, test.

21:38.068 --> 21:38.368
Testing 1, 2.

21:38.448 --> 21:38.748
Test.

21:38.808 --> 21:39.208
Test 1, 2.

21:40.068 --> 21:40.489
Testing 1, 2.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.089
Why don't I hear that?

21:41.149 --> 21:41.429
Test.

21:41.449 --> 21:41.549
Test 1, 2.

21:41.669 --> 21:41.889
Test.

21:52.782 --> 21:55.784
Testing.

21:56.245 --> 21:57.045
One, two.

21:57.165 --> 21:58.386
Test, test, test.

21:59.407 --> 22:01.168
Test, test, test.

22:01.328 --> 22:03.610
Test, test, test.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.971
Test, test, test.

22:08.254 --> 22:09.394
Is that not mic two?

22:09.434 --> 22:10.655
That is mic two, right?

22:18.161 --> 22:19.322
Test, test, test.

22:22.489 --> 22:23.409
Why don't I hear you?

23:11.025 --> 23:11.866
Test 1, 2.

23:11.986 --> 23:12.387
Testing 1, 2.

23:12.707 --> 23:13.388
Test.

23:13.648 --> 23:14.530
Why doesn't that work?

23:35.379 --> 23:37.521
I see such a big signal there.

23:37.581 --> 23:39.042
I don't see anything there.

23:39.302 --> 23:40.483
Why don't I see it here?

23:41.404 --> 23:42.464
What am I doing wrong?

23:42.585 --> 23:43.365
Something dumb.

23:47.048 --> 23:48.269
Something dumb.

23:49.029 --> 23:49.470
Hmm.

23:50.691 --> 23:51.892
Oh, is it this note?

23:53.213 --> 23:53.973
It's not that.

23:55.654 --> 23:56.675
Something dumb.

23:59.277 --> 24:00.178
Test, test, test.

24:02.648 --> 24:31.936
can see it right there why can't I see it here see it sees it on the ATM mini but the audio is not coming out why isn't the audio coming out test one two test

24:33.800 --> 24:34.381
Okay.

24:42.669 --> 24:44.410
Maybe I don't have the monitor on.

24:44.470 --> 24:46.512
Maybe I have to put those settings different.

24:46.532 --> 24:58.003
I like mic audio, desktop audio, mini, monitor.

25:07.421 --> 25:07.681
Test 1, 2.

25:08.462 --> 25:08.962
Testing 1, 2.

25:09.762 --> 25:11.623
See, I can see it on the screen there.

25:12.884 --> 25:13.184
Test 1, 2.

25:13.944 --> 25:14.364
Testing 1, 2.

25:14.965 --> 25:15.365
Test.

25:18.346 --> 25:18.686
Test 1, 2.

25:30.752 --> 25:31.092
Test 1, 2.

25:32.393 --> 25:33.633
Why don't I hear it?

25:34.414 --> 25:34.714
Shit.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.238
That hears it.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.238
Can you hear me?

25:39.258 --> 25:41.560
I don't think you can hear me.

25:42.221 --> 25:46.544
It's the signal that I see on the screen you can't hear because it's really a big signal.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.527
Test one, two.

25:51.749 --> 25:53.010
Test one, two.

25:53.170 --> 25:54.271
Test, test, test.

26:08.737 --> 26:10.478
Test, test, test.

26:10.738 --> 26:12.079
Testing, test, test.

26:18.382 --> 26:19.623
Test, test, test.

26:21.344 --> 26:23.645
Test, test, test.

26:26.607 --> 26:27.707
Test, test, test.

26:27.827 --> 26:30.989
I can see that one, but I can't hear the other one.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.690
Why can't I hear the other one?

26:33.931 --> 26:35.852
Test, test, test.

26:37.884 --> 26:39.506
I guess I gotta put it in this side.

26:40.386 --> 26:41.227
That's what I gotta do.

26:53.298 --> 26:54.399
Test, test, test.

26:54.599 --> 26:55.560
Testing one, two.

26:55.821 --> 26:56.641
Oh, there it is.

26:56.681 --> 26:56.882
See?

26:56.962 --> 26:58.583
Test, test, test, test.

26:59.504 --> 27:00.905
Testing one, two, test.

27:01.025 --> 27:02.447
Test one, two, test.

27:07.762 --> 27:08.202
Test.

27:08.362 --> 27:08.622
Test 1, 2.

27:08.983 --> 27:09.983
Testing 1, 2.

27:10.423 --> 27:11.444
Test.

27:12.865 --> 27:13.225
Test 1, 2.

27:14.946 --> 27:17.187
Test.

27:18.467 --> 27:18.868
Test.

27:18.988 --> 27:19.788
Test.

27:21.409 --> 27:23.950
Why are you not so loud?

27:24.030 --> 27:24.430
Test.

27:24.550 --> 27:24.891
Test.

27:24.971 --> 27:26.131
Test.

27:26.271 --> 27:26.752
Testing.

27:27.612 --> 27:28.612
Now it's going to be too high.

27:28.673 --> 27:28.953
Test.

27:28.993 --> 27:29.253
Test.

27:29.313 --> 27:29.693
Test.

27:30.714 --> 27:31.374
Hmm.

27:34.976 --> 27:35.976
I need to turn that up.

27:36.136 --> 27:36.456
Test.

27:36.516 --> 27:36.857
Test.

27:36.917 --> 27:37.297
Test.

27:41.806 --> 27:44.308
Test, test.

27:44.448 --> 27:46.249
Test, test, test, test.

27:46.309 --> 27:47.930
Test, test, test, test.

27:49.271 --> 27:49.972
Testing 1-2.

27:50.052 --> 27:51.813
Test 1-2.

27:52.854 --> 27:54.335
Why don't I hear you?

27:54.695 --> 27:55.336
Test 1-2.

27:55.376 --> 27:56.056
Test.

27:56.076 --> 28:00.900
It's really not that good.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.081
Hmm.

28:05.723 --> 28:06.004
Hmm.

28:07.483 --> 28:30.556
test test testing test one test test testing test test testing it's not that bad test test one two testing one two test test one two why can't i get it a little higher over here test is it like auto limiting or something

28:34.687 --> 28:35.688
Testing 1, 2, test.

28:35.788 --> 28:36.848
Test 1, 2, testing.

28:36.888 --> 28:45.254
Testing 1, 2, test.

28:45.394 --> 28:46.255
Test 1, 2, testing.

28:46.355 --> 28:47.135
Test 1, 2, oh, test.

28:47.235 --> 28:47.696
Testing 1, 2.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.197
Testing, test 1, 2, test 1, 2, testing 1, 2, test.

30:10.570 --> 30:14.173
Oh my gosh, you little fumbly thing.

30:16.294 --> 30:17.835
No, you want to put it this way.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.021
Wait, that's backwards.

30:26.281 --> 30:27.562
How's that going to go forward?

30:33.386 --> 30:33.566
There.

30:37.659 --> 30:38.459
Like that.

30:38.859 --> 30:40.760
Oh boy, that's going to be fancy.

30:42.561 --> 30:45.382
Let me take my earbuds off here.

30:45.402 --> 30:47.482
It's not going to work.

30:47.923 --> 30:49.163
I'm not going to be able to monitor.

30:54.665 --> 30:55.645
Test one, two.

30:55.765 --> 30:56.726
Testing one, two.

30:56.846 --> 30:57.506
Test.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.147
Test one, two.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.128
That's not very good at all.

31:04.108 --> 31:04.548
Test.

31:05.789 --> 31:06.809
That's not good at all.

31:08.086 --> 31:08.746
That sucks.

31:12.068 --> 31:13.008
Why does it suck?

31:14.709 --> 31:15.550
Where's the box?

31:20.872 --> 31:22.493
Why does it suck?

31:23.634 --> 31:24.394
I don't know why.

31:24.414 --> 31:26.415
I really don't.

31:26.695 --> 31:27.556
I don't know why.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.217
I don't know why.

31:29.237 --> 31:29.357
Test 1-2.

31:29.457 --> 31:29.897
Test 1-2.

31:29.937 --> 31:30.457
Testing 1-2.

31:31.838 --> 31:32.118
Test.

31:32.318 --> 31:32.498
Test 1-2.

31:41.027 --> 31:41.407
I don't know.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.228
It still kind of sucks.

31:45.589 --> 31:51.591
I'm just gonna keep recording this because I'm recording it and then I can see how it works and whether it works.

31:57.353 --> 31:59.574
Test 1-2, testing 1-2, test.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.374
Test 1-2.

32:00.574 --> 32:06.796
Okay, but the sound goes all the way down so that's actually really good.

32:08.437 --> 32:09.197
There's an echo now.

32:11.328 --> 32:12.629
Why would there be an echo now?

32:14.251 --> 32:15.572
Hmm, there's no echo.

32:15.912 --> 32:16.833
I think the echo's gone.

32:17.433 --> 32:18.755
Should be echo gone now.

32:19.295 --> 32:21.217
Oh yeah, that echo.

32:21.277 --> 32:22.478
Now that echo should be gone.

32:23.799 --> 32:24.400
Now it's gone.

32:25.501 --> 32:26.602
I think it should be fine.

32:26.622 --> 32:34.749
Now what I'm gonna do is see how far I can go before I lose the signal.

32:41.164 --> 32:46.626
So let's see, let's put this receiver in an optimal spot.

32:48.907 --> 32:50.708
Where is the receiver?

32:52.068 --> 32:56.090
Oh yeah, I have it plugged in over here, which means I can really put it in an optimal spot.

32:56.630 --> 32:57.070
Yes.

33:00.852 --> 33:02.953
La da da da da da da da.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.393
All these things are tangled up good.

33:07.674 --> 33:08.634
Okay, there we go.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.957
Good optimal receptor spot.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.700
Ideally, it would go out the door over here.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.563
But this might be alright.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.505
I'm just gonna take a quick ride and see what it does.

33:23.809 --> 33:25.150
Do I have it on the right camera?

33:33.154 --> 33:35.256
Hey, Usatonic, good to see you, man.

33:36.437 --> 33:40.100
I'm glad you're in the chat.

33:42.602 --> 33:44.263
I'm gonna take a spin, I'll be right back.

33:45.684 --> 33:47.185
Reginald says it works fine.

33:47.285 --> 33:48.526
All right, well, let's see.

33:48.686 --> 33:50.928
I got it turned up pretty high though, so let's see.

33:51.028 --> 33:51.348
Test.

33:52.810 --> 33:54.311
But it fades all the way to dead.

33:54.711 --> 33:55.812
That's pretty impressive.

33:58.794 --> 34:00.175
All right, let's see how far it goes.

34:00.496 --> 34:00.716
Funny.

34:02.228 --> 34:03.889
Let's see how far I can go.

34:14.113 --> 34:16.214
Wouldn't it be funny if I could go all the way around?

34:16.234 --> 34:23.557
Because if I can go all the way around, of course, then we have... So what you should be doing now is getting ready

34:26.420 --> 34:36.723
You should be getting ready in the chat to type the words that you hear and I'll tell you where I am on the ride and then you can tell me when you hear me or when you don't hear me.

34:37.403 --> 34:41.885
This thing won't report and I don't have a monitor so check it.

34:46.586 --> 34:49.347
First I'm just gonna see if I can make it out to the driveway.

34:51.148 --> 34:51.908
Hopefully I can.

35:05.905 --> 35:08.926
So the first question is, can I really even sit here and talk?

35:10.266 --> 35:15.127
Um, because if I can, then in theory I could put the screen right there.

35:16.108 --> 35:24.390
I could have Bluetooth headphones and I could do some morning streams from the street, basically have the cars driving by.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.770
So that's my first test.

35:28.011 --> 35:31.992
If you can help me out by typing in the chat, whether you could hear me there or not.

35:33.272 --> 35:33.352
Um,

35:35.137 --> 35:37.519
Then I'll see how far I can go out from there.

35:39.121 --> 35:40.042
Yes, hear me?

35:40.342 --> 35:41.984
Yes, it works.

35:42.284 --> 35:44.426
You, yes, in the chair, sounds good.

35:44.486 --> 35:45.247
Yes, great.

35:45.507 --> 35:47.489
Okay, now we're going to go a little farther.

35:47.509 --> 35:50.492
Wow, I wonder how far this thing can go.

35:55.157 --> 35:55.597
Here we go.

36:03.283 --> 36:05.168
Okay, I'm gonna go up to the top of the hill here.

36:05.188 --> 36:05.228
Um...

36:37.672 --> 37:05.625
And now I'm coming in the driveway and so If you could hear me all the way up the hill I would be very surprised but possible So I'm gonna come and check now That far then for sure if I had a longer cord all I need is a longer cord

37:06.522 --> 37:08.363
And in theory, I could go really far.

37:10.143 --> 37:11.184
So did it cut out?

37:11.264 --> 37:12.344
I guess it cut out, right?

37:13.984 --> 37:15.785
Up until the top of the hill here.

37:16.685 --> 37:20.226
Nothing now until I'm coming down that heard you and coming in the driveway.

37:21.067 --> 37:21.387
Okay.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.607
Almost line of sight.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.648
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.148
So I'm going to see if I can put it out there farther.

37:28.189 --> 37:34.351
So I think if I have a correct, I don't know, this cord might not work.

37:35.737 --> 37:36.557
I had a cord.

37:36.577 --> 37:46.602
I had a cord that I was throwing out.

37:46.822 --> 37:47.703
Let's see if it works.

38:31.582 --> 38:37.948
Oh yeah, see that needs to be... That won't work anyway because I need a connector for that.

38:38.488 --> 38:38.769
Shoot.

38:39.830 --> 38:47.617
Okay, that's the... That is the cord I want to test, but... I don't think I can test it.

38:48.798 --> 38:50.660
Yeah, I would probably need Linosite indeed.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.761
That's probably what I need.

38:52.842 --> 38:54.083
Probably need Linosite.

38:55.504 --> 38:57.286
But if you can see me in the...

39:00.017 --> 39:01.419
helmet must have helped a little bit.

39:02.300 --> 39:09.388
That does mean I'm gonna be able to record with this thing in the helmet which is nice because I do think that'll work.

39:12.711 --> 39:14.033
Let's see here.

39:15.514 --> 39:16.395
Need this wire.

39:18.478 --> 39:19.419
Can't find the wire.

39:30.560 --> 39:36.905
What is everyone else doing for their Memorial Day?

39:37.045 --> 39:39.927
Any special barbecuing?

39:42.108 --> 39:42.909
Special bourbon?

39:44.410 --> 39:46.231
Special people you're trying to remember?

39:47.612 --> 39:48.673
Test 1-2, testing 1-2 test.

39:57.981 --> 40:19.172
test one two it's still very soft very very soft i don't know i really feel like it records well but it's just soft i would have to boost it in post and if i turn it up too high i don't think it sounds very good let me see again

40:21.894 --> 40:27.676
So I can't really use this one for an in the room monitor unless I can turn up the heat in the in the settings.

40:28.697 --> 40:31.398
Which is again what I was gonna do before but I wasn't there.

40:33.119 --> 40:33.679
Oh yeah it's here.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.140
So can I do it in here?

40:37.521 --> 40:39.661
Does this thing allow me to do anything like that?

40:39.741 --> 40:40.002
No.

40:42.443 --> 40:42.903
Hmm.

40:45.524 --> 40:46.124
Okay.

40:48.665 --> 40:50.506
Thanks for dropping by my fauna.

40:52.329 --> 40:53.670
Thank you for dropping by.

40:53.790 --> 40:55.090
Thank you for dropping by.

40:55.230 --> 40:56.251
Test, test, test.

40:58.072 --> 40:59.132
Test, test, test.

40:59.252 --> 41:01.173
Testing, one, two, test.

41:01.293 --> 41:02.114
Test, one, two.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.634
Testing, one, two, test.

41:03.694 --> 41:05.075
Test, one, two, test.

41:05.915 --> 41:07.376
Testing, one, two, test.

41:09.057 --> 41:10.198
Yeah, it's just a little shh.

41:11.758 --> 41:13.999
It's a little fuzzy when I turn it up that loud.

41:14.019 --> 41:15.180
I don't like it that loud.

41:16.461 --> 41:19.422
It sounds funny to me when I turn it up that loud.

41:21.932 --> 41:26.953
And I hear noise when I turn it up that loud.

41:27.493 --> 41:28.073
Testing 1, 2.

41:28.193 --> 41:28.433
Test 1, 2.

41:28.593 --> 41:29.053
Testing 1, 2.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.634
I guess I can put it right there, though.

41:32.414 --> 41:35.734
And it ain't gonna bother the mic very much.

41:35.914 --> 41:37.575
I could probably even put it right there.

41:38.875 --> 41:39.875
If I think about it.

41:41.775 --> 41:43.056
I bet it can go right here.

41:43.536 --> 41:45.096
So I had a good spot for it, though.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.576
That spot was working well.

41:49.377 --> 41:50.077
What about, oh yeah.

41:56.810 --> 41:59.539
Got to go off camera for a second and find something

42:30.390 --> 42:36.275
You know, so much of what people... Let me change this.

42:37.737 --> 42:44.263
So much of what people will tell you is their YouTube channel is... They're just full of shit, and I'll tell you why.

42:44.883 --> 42:49.527
Because they have no signs that they ever had to troubleshoot anything.

42:50.989 --> 42:56.634
What I'm trying to do right now is figure out how to fasten inside of the baseball helmet

42:59.738 --> 43:18.620
Fastened inside of the baseball helmet the the microphone and that's why I thought the baseball helmet is pretty nice It's still got really nice padding and it you know, I'm not gonna I don't fall on the wheel I haven't fallen on the wheel in a very long time knock on wood and I don't ride that fast Unless I know where I'm riding

43:19.642 --> 43:24.065
And that wheel is very stable, and riding a wheel is really very stable.

43:24.205 --> 43:28.488
If you've never ridden one, you don't know how to ride one, then it looks like magic.

43:28.828 --> 43:33.711
And it looks like it must be very very hard, but it's actually very intuitive.

43:34.752 --> 43:41.296
And if you're in control, it's pretty hard to get into a massive crash.

43:41.976 --> 43:43.137
Unless the power goes out.

43:44.111 --> 43:47.955
And so that lesson, I've learned the hard way a couple times.

43:48.375 --> 43:56.583
And the main reason why you learn that lesson is because the... I know you can't see it.

43:58.105 --> 43:59.186
Is because the...

44:02.774 --> 44:05.315
Is because the wheel is not strong enough for you.

44:05.415 --> 44:10.016
So if you're a 200 pound man and you get on a wheel like this, it better be strong enough.

44:10.096 --> 44:15.218
Otherwise you're gonna, if you lean too far into it, you could just overload it.

44:15.398 --> 44:18.759
And in 5 to 8 seconds it could just turn off.

44:19.619 --> 44:22.340
Usually they have some kind of warning system, like a beeping thing.

44:22.380 --> 44:23.040
This one will beep.

44:24.420 --> 44:27.101
If I go too fast, I can't overload it.

44:27.221 --> 44:29.122
But if I go too fast, it'll start beeping.

44:29.162 --> 44:31.703
But it's set to beep right now, I think at 28 miles an hour.

44:31.743 --> 44:33.924
And I never hit that.

44:34.504 --> 44:37.885
And this thing can go 40, maybe even 50 miles an hour.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.546
I wouldn't know because I would never be able to ride it that fast.

44:41.966 --> 44:44.227
So, it is fun though.

44:44.847 --> 44:47.388
I can't stress enough how much fun it is.

44:48.068 --> 44:52.570
It is amazingly fun to ride a wheel.

44:55.885 --> 45:00.067
Yeah, we barbecued this afternoon already, and then we're gonna have some beer.

45:00.868 --> 45:09.212
I can't drink and ride, so I'm riding now this afternoon with the kids, and then when I decide I'm done, I'm done.

45:10.513 --> 45:15.556
Because it does take a lot of balance, and especially when you ride slow, you really need balance.

45:16.516 --> 45:19.958
And inebriated, it is not possible.

45:20.639 --> 45:21.099
Who was that?

45:28.277 --> 45:31.183
Can go 50 miles an hour all the way to the scene of the crash.

45:31.203 --> 45:32.225
Yes, exactly.

45:32.245 --> 45:34.489
That's how it would work.

45:38.553 --> 45:40.874
Yeah, I'm very excited about this week.

45:40.914 --> 45:42.134
We've made a lot of progress.

45:43.114 --> 45:45.875
And I've made a lot of progress, I think, behind the scenes.

45:46.435 --> 45:49.496
I'm feeling very good about the first book now.

45:50.556 --> 45:51.976
I have a good outline for it.

45:52.116 --> 45:53.517
I'm getting very excited about it.

45:53.577 --> 45:58.418
And so it's allowed me to focus a little bit more on leveling up finally.

45:58.618 --> 46:06.020
And so yesterday I also got the original JC on a Bike bike out again.

46:07.588 --> 46:08.529
Which is dope.

46:08.909 --> 46:10.370
I'm very excited about that.

46:12.431 --> 46:14.832
Very, very, very excited about that.

46:17.974 --> 46:22.856
I think this audio should also be on.

46:22.976 --> 46:30.780
It's been a long, long time since this bike rode.

46:31.941 --> 46:32.762
And last night...

46:39.286 --> 46:42.650
Oh man, I can't get it out of here.

46:43.030 --> 46:48.435
I'll hide my sweatshirt.

46:48.895 --> 46:50.937
This is frightening.

46:50.957 --> 46:52.238
Sounds like a pain in the ass.

46:54.841 --> 47:01.767
So... Hey buddy.

47:02.768 --> 47:03.769
Bring him down here, would ya?

47:20.302 --> 47:22.224
And then if you wouldn't mind, I could get my iPad.

47:22.264 --> 47:22.925
That would be great.

47:23.365 --> 47:24.847
It's on my toolbox over there.

47:25.688 --> 47:26.749
Come, Mikey, over here.

47:30.694 --> 47:31.254
Over here, you.

47:31.795 --> 47:32.275
Oh, sure.

47:33.757 --> 47:34.498
And your iPad?

47:34.758 --> 47:36.440
Yeah, it's on my toolbox, please.

47:40.585 --> 47:40.705
No?

47:54.051 --> 47:55.031
Such a little boy you are.

47:55.852 --> 47:59.813
Yeah, you're a little boy.

47:59.833 --> 48:01.053
Stay here, little boy.

48:07.195 --> 48:16.679
Stay here, little boy.

48:16.739 --> 48:18.499
Hey, cool, I can see it now.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.780
Now I can answer your chat.

48:20.860 --> 48:23.121
You don't have to do that.

48:24.228 --> 48:25.408
There's no reason to do that.

49:18.643 --> 49:19.830
What are you swearing about?

50:07.541 --> 50:13.865
Let's check out what we've got here.

50:13.905 --> 50:14.985
There, I can see it now.

50:15.046 --> 50:15.326
See?

50:15.506 --> 50:15.886
Look.

50:16.006 --> 50:17.227
Now that's perfect.

50:17.347 --> 50:33.697
Come, Michael, have Ruby.

50:33.957 --> 50:34.397
Come say hello.

50:40.520 --> 50:43.244
How can I take away the shame you've done me for me?

50:43.284 --> 50:45.508
You better come back, I will.

51:55.273 --> 51:56.354
You're very tight still.

51:56.514 --> 51:57.835
Going up there, my Ruby?

51:58.256 --> 51:58.636
Okay.

52:04.882 --> 52:06.183
Want to go up to the top again, too?

52:35.556 --> 52:36.242
Where are you guys going?

53:22.439 --> 53:22.780
Oh no!

54:00.925 --> 54:02.146
I think I know what happens.

54:02.166 --> 54:11.132
You know what happens is that when I plug it into the recording device that I have, the recording device adjusts automatically.

54:11.372 --> 54:14.714
That's why the levels that I record from Jake at the gym are so good.

54:15.675 --> 54:20.038
And I can't auto adjust the levels here like that to level it out right.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.419
So it sounds funny.

54:22.339 --> 54:23.060
I think that's why.

54:35.049 --> 54:40.111
Hey, we can have this open.

54:40.271 --> 54:42.872
Hey, it's open.

55:05.025 --> 55:05.467
Come home.

56:30.843 --> 56:46.959
Okay, well.

56:57.383 --> 57:02.165
I can see the chat now.

57:04.826 --> 57:10.328
I can see the chat now.

57:14.190 --> 57:21.053
I'm going to go write a little bit more so that I can get the battery run down and then I'm going to sign off.

57:21.173 --> 57:25.755
So if you have any questions, you have any comments, say it in the chat now.

57:28.916 --> 57:34.720
Hopefully my kids won't be walking through the camera too much and we'll see what's up.

57:37.282 --> 57:41.305
I am live right now in the garage, so when you walk in here, you're on the screen.

57:41.325 --> 57:52.533
I mean, you don't have to care, but I'm just telling you.

57:57.918 --> 57:58.738
It's coming up.

58:40.362 --> 58:41.223
I still have it on.

58:41.303 --> 58:42.303
I didn't think about that.

58:42.363 --> 58:43.524
I can still try it.

58:45.105 --> 58:46.106
It's still wired up.

58:59.315 --> 59:00.215
It's still wired up.

59:00.235 --> 59:01.516
It was working very well.

59:02.377 --> 59:02.797
Indeed.

59:03.958 --> 59:05.879
It was working very well indeed.

59:05.899 --> 59:08.601
Testing 1, 2, test.

59:11.752 --> 59:12.533
Test 1, 2.

59:12.593 --> 59:14.174
Yeah, you can still hear it a little bit.

59:14.374 --> 59:14.975
It's still there.

59:15.015 --> 59:15.895
It's probably echoey.

59:23.161 --> 59:24.142
But this will work.

59:35.291 --> 59:36.612
So I probably shouldn't use it.

59:38.374 --> 59:40.476
Just to see what kind of sound I get out of it.

59:41.468 --> 59:42.288
Good testing.

59:43.349 --> 59:45.990
Always important to do good testing.

59:46.010 --> 59:56.515
I want it to be right here, I guess.

59:58.335 --> 59:59.176
It's a little bit better.

59:59.576 --> 01:00:00.516
It's right in my ear.

01:00:01.957 --> 01:00:03.778
Maybe it captures things.

01:00:04.418 --> 01:00:04.738
There.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.821
Okay, let's see what this does.

01:00:12.682 --> 01:00:14.623
Testing 1, 2, test.

01:00:14.703 --> 01:00:16.124
Test 1, 2.

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:17.905
Testing 1, 2.

01:00:17.965 --> 01:00:18.805
Testing 1, 2.

01:00:22.307 --> 01:00:23.848
Testing 1, 2, test.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:24.729
Test 1, 2.

01:00:24.909 --> 01:00:26.990
Test.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:28.110
Test 1, 2.

01:00:31.432 --> 01:00:32.333
Segways suck.

01:00:32.973 --> 01:00:37.295
Segways suck for so many reasons, but most of the reason why is that they suck.

01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:53.587
Once you're on a wheel, I think the main advance for me, the main advance on wheels, I can't see, is going to be when you see me demonstrate riding with two ski poles.

01:00:54.648 --> 01:01:06.415
Because if you have two trekking poles on a wheel, you can basically stop at any stop sign and you can turn really slowly with some skill and you can catch yourself a little bit when you fall.

01:01:08.857 --> 01:01:14.941
I'm not absolutely sure that this is the best way to do it, but right now for me it's been a real game changer.

01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:24.486
But I still practice without... I still practice without the poles and I would only use the poles if I was going to go for like a really long ride.

01:01:25.467 --> 01:01:28.889
Where I knew that I was going to be stopping in traffic and stuff like that.

01:01:28.929 --> 01:01:30.410
Then I think poles are really cool.

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.093
Otherwise I don't think poles are that cool.

01:01:37.606 --> 01:01:39.586
So, let's see.

01:01:39.686 --> 01:01:56.490
Hey, where are my gloves?

01:02:00.251 --> 01:02:01.011
Who's growling?

01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:51.614
Test one two, testing one two, testing one two, testing one two.

01:03:22.182 --> 01:03:22.562
Testing 1, 2.

01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:25.805
Test 1, 2.

01:03:25.905 --> 01:03:26.685
Testing 1, 2.

01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:27.086
Test 1, 2.

01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:29.107
How far did I get there?

01:03:29.548 --> 01:03:30.989
I didn't really go up the hill that time.

01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.250
Test 1, 2.

01:04:05.034 --> 01:04:08.436
Testing, testing, test one, two.

01:04:09.937 --> 01:04:10.777
Probably lost me there.

01:05:00.474 --> 01:05:00.555
Bye.

01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:35.460
You guys have to be the ref.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:40.783
You guys are the ref.

01:06:41.894 --> 01:07:05.209
Yeah, it's really only going slow.

01:07:07.443 --> 01:07:30.949
I was saying it's really only going slow Going slow is really difficult because this wheel is really heavy this wheel actually weighs like I Don't know if it's 50 pounds or whatever, but like it's not very It's really hard to get on in the middle of the street like this if you try to get on with

01:07:32.262 --> 01:07:55.620
one foot on the wheel and then you start with a smaller wheel this is easier but with a big wheel like this one it's kind of hard especially on an incline it's really tricky and so that's why I'm practicing all the time in here because the tight turns whoa I'm gonna crash

01:08:01.124 --> 01:08:07.949
And those are the ones that when you do them in traffic, you're going to be like freaking out.

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:11.852
You know, you don't want to be freaking out, but that's what ends up happening, right?

01:08:11.872 --> 01:08:13.133
You get nervous in traffic.

01:08:13.193 --> 01:08:28.125
And so if you have to do these tricks, like this tick-tocking, if you have to do this trick without a stop sign or, you know, without a stick to hold on to, yeah, you're better than me.

01:08:29.741 --> 01:08:35.583
I don't even know if I can do a single tick-tock, no, not without some help.

01:08:36.663 --> 01:08:37.083
Like this.

01:08:38.263 --> 01:08:39.403
I'm not so good at that.

01:08:40.424 --> 01:08:44.965
That takes some skill that I don't have yet.

01:08:45.345 --> 01:08:48.106
I don't even know if on this wheel it's actually very easy to do.

01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:56.648
You'd be much better off wearing a top and catch the wheel in a balanced position.

01:08:57.659 --> 01:09:03.002
Because if it's in a balanced position, even like a heavy weight, it's still light.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:05.804
So when it gets out of balance, it gets quick.

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:21.753
You just have to practice keeping your foot in the right place, putting your foot in the right place also.

01:09:23.554 --> 01:09:24.235
But it's not...

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:32.582
It's not a skill that you're going to learn without a little pain or without previous serious balance skill.

01:09:35.103 --> 01:09:41.846
It's not something that you're going to want to pick up if you're, you know, 40 pounds overweight and you can't run a mile.

01:09:42.026 --> 01:09:49.869
I mean, this is something that will beat the living hell out of your body and out of your legs and out of your core and out of your back until you're good at it.

01:09:50.049 --> 01:09:53.470
And the trick is, is that with a, with a wheel like this,

01:09:56.576 --> 01:10:01.298
With a wheel like this, your legs are the shock absorbers.

01:10:01.378 --> 01:10:07.520
There are wheels now that they make that have suspension in them built into the wheel.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.021
I don't know if I would... I'm sure I would like that because everybody likes it.

01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:18.803
But I'm not sure that I would... I would say that I don't like this.

01:10:19.863 --> 01:10:21.364
Because with this you're forced...

01:10:24.704 --> 01:10:27.326
You're just a little bit more, oh damn it.

01:10:28.527 --> 01:10:34.972
You're a little bit more forced to, well I'm also just not very good at it yet.

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:38.094
You're also forced to pay attention to the road.

01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:51.064
The suspension allows you to kind of go gangbusters because if you hit a small pothole or something like that, it's not gonna throw you off because there is this shock absorption.

01:10:51.624 --> 01:10:53.226
So I guess that's cool if you're like a,

01:10:54.528 --> 01:10:57.010
If you're like one of these people who just rides like a bullet.

01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:03.796
But I'm not.

01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:08.580
And like I said, I'm still trying to learn how to control my wheel in slow motion.

01:11:09.521 --> 01:11:12.223
And sometimes I'm really good at it.

01:11:12.343 --> 01:11:13.624
And other times I'm just not.

01:11:16.767 --> 01:11:22.752
For sure, with a little Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, I am not any good at it.

01:11:24.182 --> 01:11:27.964
Um, I mean, you can see me here.

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:35.307
I'm walking backwards to the garage so that I can get ahold of the garage and talk to you without having to struggle.

01:11:36.707 --> 01:11:38.168
Um, otherwise I would need to ride.

01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:42.190
I can't just, this is a lot of exercise to ride so slow.

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:46.011
Um, I don't know if you can still hear me or not.

01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:47.112
Is this still working?

01:11:48.232 --> 01:11:49.613
I'm not going to do this all the time.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:52.394
You know, my, my plan is not.

01:11:53.055 --> 01:11:57.656
Mic correction, braking as you move.

01:12:01.137 --> 01:12:03.878
Improves when you face the receiver.

01:12:03.918 --> 01:12:05.298
Oh yeah, that's very possible.

01:12:05.338 --> 01:12:06.698
I mean, the receiver's in the other room.

01:12:06.738 --> 01:12:12.200
It's in the back of the garage, so it's very possible.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.941
I don't even hear anything on this, though.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:34.135
Holy cow, look at you two up there.

01:12:35.116 --> 01:12:36.097
Having the drinks.

01:12:37.057 --> 01:12:38.158
Having the drinks.

01:12:39.699 --> 01:12:40.239
I like that.

01:12:43.762 --> 01:12:50.246
Okay, I'm going to do one more round and then I'm going to turn the stream off and let you guys have your Memorial Day back.

01:12:51.499 --> 01:12:56.642
Thanks for joining our little garage sale.

01:13:35.362 --> 01:13:39.765
Sister against sister.

01:13:39.946 --> 01:13:43.769
Daddy, do you ever go down for it?

01:14:21.489 --> 01:14:27.094
And in reality, actually another thing that really happens, Hossain, is that...

01:14:29.372 --> 01:14:36.317
Your feet need to be in exactly the right positions on the pedals or the wheel can oscillate.

01:14:36.437 --> 01:14:46.243
So if you go really fast on this wheel and your feet aren't in the right position or you're, I'm a little weak, like I'm a little weak, the wheel will oscillate like this.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:54.829
And if you don't get control of yourself and you're not good enough at getting the weight on one wheel, on one side of the wheel,

01:14:55.809 --> 01:14:57.131
You can wipe out really bad.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:01.455
So that's another thing with a heavier wheel that also happens.

01:15:01.895 --> 01:15:10.784
And again, anybody who rides a wheel professionally or is much better than me will probably give you all different reasons why I'm a beginner and I suck.

01:15:10.904 --> 01:15:11.925
And that's totally true.

01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:12.466
I am.

01:15:12.486 --> 01:15:15.169
I've only got about probably

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:43.455
300 miles on riding a wheel in total and a lot of those are in the Netherlands on a much smaller and slower wheel So I'm in over my head a little bit with this wheel But it is it is in a tremendous amount of fun, I mean I really really like it a lot it's just It's it's really a great pastime you just have to have your feet in the right spot and

01:15:44.722 --> 01:15:53.812
not too far in the front because then you'll you'll be on the toes your toes will be too far on the on the on the pedals and then you'll wobble.

01:16:16.064 --> 01:16:16.244
What?

01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:13.543
Yeah.

01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:14.543
Yeah.

01:17:14.623 --> 01:17:15.423
Yeah.

01:17:15.563 --> 01:17:16.644
Yeah.

01:17:19.045 --> 01:17:20.105
Yeah.

01:17:20.725 --> 01:17:21.866
Yeah.

01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:22.386
Yeah.

01:17:22.466 --> 01:17:22.806
Yeah.

01:17:41.364 --> 01:17:42.388
You're welcome.

01:18:37.794 --> 01:18:42.117
All right, thank you for helping me test my kit.

01:18:44.518 --> 01:18:45.779
I know that things are going better.

01:18:48.513 --> 01:18:50.535
Now with that sound, it sounds alright.

01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:52.236
I think I'm going to be able to record with that.

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:01.764
Let me get this off of my head here.

01:19:02.585 --> 01:19:03.126
There we go.

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:06.809
And get these off of my eyes.

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:15.056
Hey, thank you very much guys for helping me out today and for being here and I hope you guys are all having a

01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:17.202
nice Memorial Day.

01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:27.991
Those people outside of the United States, we here in the United States are remembering those who gave their lives for the American dream, whatever that is nowadays.

01:19:29.012 --> 01:19:36.278
I know what it is for me and I know what it is for my children and for their children and I hope that

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:44.169
I don't know, I hope that you find a little peace today as you move into the week.

01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:49.037
And America, and the world, I will see you tomorrow morning again at 1010.

01:19:51.658 --> 01:19:53.559
for a regular live stream.

01:19:54.259 --> 01:19:56.620
I've got a lot of videos that we need to work through yet.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.440
And the high school curriculum is almost done.

01:20:00.121 --> 01:20:03.662
The virology mini course is very, very close to complete.

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:11.664
And so I'm really looking forward to, I don't know, getting started again, let's say it that way.

01:20:11.704 --> 01:20:15.545
But for now, I'm having a very relaxed day in the sun with my family.

01:20:15.745 --> 01:20:18.326
And I hope you don't mind that I shared a little bit of that with you.

01:20:18.906 --> 01:20:20.007
Thanks very much for being here.

01:20:20.047 --> 01:20:21.027
And I'll see you again soon.
