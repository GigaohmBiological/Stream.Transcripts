WEBVTT

06:00.842 --> 06:02.023
Oh yeah, I had to do that, too.

06:04.684 --> 06:08.126
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are.

06:09.227 --> 06:10.048
Welcome to the show.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.509
This is GigaOM Biological.

06:11.569 --> 06:15.931
It's Friday here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, coming to you live from the back of my garage.

06:17.172 --> 06:18.413
There you can hear the back door.

06:19.653 --> 06:20.794
Thank you very much for joining me.

06:20.814 --> 06:30.280
I am very happy it's Friday, although I do have some vague idea in my head that I might be going on during the weekend, although, you know, I don't

06:31.314 --> 06:33.135
I don't know about anything about that right now.

06:33.235 --> 06:35.516
All I know is that I'm trying to stay focused on the biology.

06:35.556 --> 06:42.800
I'm trying not to take the bait on social media and I'm trying to love my neighbor as best I know how to do.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.142
In this case, I'm trying to stream the truth as often as possible.

06:47.202 --> 06:55.126
I feel like a modern day ham radio operator just trying to call CQ every day and see how many people I can reach with my transmission.

06:55.706 --> 07:04.635
And hopefully the more that people share this connection, the more that we will reach out to more people and expand more minds.

07:04.695 --> 07:07.617
Keep in mind that this message is not for everyone.

07:08.238 --> 07:15.044
It's a message for anyone who wants to know the truth, anyone who wants to be free of this nonsense, anyone who wants to

07:15.925 --> 07:29.490
leave social media with a clean conscience, not to feel like somehow or another you're leaving behind humanity and going off to live in a cave somewhere because you're that kind of guy.

07:29.590 --> 07:37.073
No, you're really making a decision not to engage in the one thing that can make this all fall apart.

07:38.553 --> 08:01.839
Another and I guess a better way to say it would be not to engage in the one thing that can make this all work That makes their plan all very cohesive and almost foolproof is that everybody is using social media therefore the reality that social media enables these creators these these controllers to manipulate and create for us is

08:03.743 --> 08:20.448
The less likely we are to really be engaged in any meaningful dialogue, the less likely we are to be engaged in any meaningful interaction with our representatives, even if our representatives do somehow or another, or are somehow or another,

08:22.699 --> 08:46.841
sort of held accountable to us by the voting system, even if you believe that's true, the extent to which the illusion that they are coming through on their promises or unable to come through on their promises despite their best efforts is so easily manipulated if the only way that we have any access to what's actually going on is the window of social media.

08:47.501 --> 08:50.831
It's simply not permissible.

08:50.871 --> 08:52.215
We can't go on like this.

08:53.057 --> 08:54.802
And if we do, we will be enslaved.

08:56.256 --> 09:14.554
And so in many ways, I am advocating for, you know, going out and living in the wilderness, but in communities of people that, you know, that we need to build that back again and not even really build that back again, just look outside and reclaim it and realize that it's still there.

09:14.614 --> 09:21.160
It's almost like pretending there are no playgrounds out there that people didn't use to go to bars before the pandemic or that

09:21.620 --> 09:32.202
You know, all of these things, the restaurants that used to exist that don't exist anymore, those are all real phenomenon that changed very rapidly over the last five years.

09:32.722 --> 09:44.385
And because of the, turn down the backyard for a minute, because of the acquiescence to social media on a nearly global basis,

09:45.373 --> 09:56.614
people have had their time horizon of awareness so focused on a week or so, or three weeks, that time passing even seems to take

09:58.533 --> 10:07.736
In essence, it's harder because there's so much to remember from each week, and you're trying to follow along with so many things each week.

10:08.256 --> 10:20.140
Even if you're just passively scrolling, you're following along with so many things each week that the end result is, is that the last six years feels like a decade, feels like 15 years.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.741
You can't even remember what you were doing in 2018, and that's terrifying.

10:30.814 --> 10:31.194
I don't know.

10:31.354 --> 10:33.356
Anyway, today, did I change that?

10:33.456 --> 10:35.477
No, I did not.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.178
Sorry.

10:36.298 --> 10:43.883
So today we are going to do Mr. Autism Newsman.

10:44.964 --> 10:54.271
And we then are going to do Fake Barry and Mr. Autism.

10:59.378 --> 11:06.977
new oops newsman and then we are going to go back to February 2021 for a

11:10.100 --> 11:12.040
a panel discussion.

11:12.500 --> 11:38.225
Because I do think it's important always to go back and look at this stuff and keep repeating the mantra, you gotta go back to 2020, to 2021, to 2022 and watch what these people did, watch what they said, watch who they worked with, what they were saying and how their story changed to reflect the evolution of the narrative, which may very well

11:39.181 --> 11:48.403
have been meant to stay at there's some kind of virus, and it's definitely new, although where it came from, who cares?

11:48.503 --> 11:51.983
It might not have even been meant to go any farther than that.

11:52.764 --> 12:04.326
And the February 21 video that was sent to me courtesy of Mark Kulak in Boston, Massachusetts, of Housatonic ITS, you guys know as a collaborator of mine, or at least a friend,

12:06.107 --> 12:09.189
and a guy who I can send a link or ask about a person.

12:09.249 --> 12:26.821
And I've come very much into the habit now of before I send anything to Mark, I first go to his website, hewsatonic.live, and I look under his research page, and I look up the name that I'm about to send him to make sure that he doesn't have a page on this person already, because, you know, five times out of 10, he does.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.903
And so he's been doing a lot of work for a long time.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.125
And anyway, I think,

12:35.854 --> 12:44.800
I think this panel discussion sent to me by Mark, it's a home run for the idea that the calendar reflects something.

12:44.900 --> 12:54.747
The purposeful interaction between these people, the shared stages of podcasts can reveal a tremendous amount

12:55.848 --> 13:08.655
about the network of people that was assembled, how they were recruited, when they were recruited perhaps, but for sure these are things that cannot be discounted.

13:09.537 --> 13:30.798
We cannot just take the podcast appearance schedule of Robert Malone as the haphazard scheduling of Jill as she's trying to juggle birthing foals and incubating emu eggs and scheduling a new roof for the third shed they're building.

13:31.719 --> 13:33.061
I mean, that's just not possible.

13:33.820 --> 13:50.027
I mean, these people are much more important players than to be random podcast guests that have just disrupted the status quo despite the national security state's best efforts.

13:50.727 --> 13:52.888
Because that's kind of the narrative here, right?

13:53.308 --> 13:54.568
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

13:54.649 --> 14:00.351
and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland exist despite

14:01.772 --> 14:08.715
the DOD's best effort to kill us with a kill box, according to Catherine Watt and Sasha Latupova.

14:08.755 --> 14:21.961
This whole narrative doesn't make any sense because none of these people can believe what they say and then also just decide to, I guess I'll just take a salary from a nonprofit organization and do some podcasts and hope for the best.

14:23.404 --> 14:37.426
It's like being on a cruise ship that you know is going too fast, heading into port way too fast with nobody at the helm and you just decide, okay, well, I might as well just go down to the casino and keep betting and hope that everything goes well.

14:39.252 --> 14:43.516
It's absurd to behave that way unless you know something else is going on.

14:43.896 --> 14:45.378
You see, that's the thing.

14:45.858 --> 14:55.768
There's no way that Mary Holland's track record from the last 10 years is that of a all-in crusader for the health of American children.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.209
That's just disturbing.

14:58.832 --> 15:04.636
the same thing can be said for all of these people, and that's what makes this such a dark time in American history.

15:05.197 --> 15:19.808
Because so many people, thanks to the extremely skilled use of social media, have come to accept these people as heroes, and they've become so intellectually and socially isolated by their social media use,

15:20.228 --> 15:33.530
that they're willing to keep secret, they're willing to keep quiet about it at work, they're willing to shut up around people that they believe don't see what they see, not even understanding the contradiction in that.

15:37.051 --> 15:41.232
And they think it's just because everybody else is brainwashed, and it is true.

15:42.232 --> 15:48.113
Everybody else is brainwashed, but right now, the ones that have worked the hardest

15:49.298 --> 15:52.100
to convince themselves that they're not brainwashed.

15:52.140 --> 15:59.406
The ones that are convinced that they have the upper hand right now are actually those on the populist right.

16:01.047 --> 16:09.093
They are the ones that are still searching for the truth of Charlie Kirk while Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:09.554 --> 16:18.941
and the guy from the Turkish military and the guy from Egypt and the guy who put a dead bear on a bike in Central Park

16:20.106 --> 16:28.693
are freaking shaking the hands of Albert Bourla and asking Pfizer to move their mRNA manufacturing to American soil.

16:31.348 --> 16:55.296
this is exactly the script that they were supposed to be on plus some lab leak bullshit baggage about a spike protein to keep everybody busy with prions and amyloid and stuff like that but that was just an addition because things went way off the rails there was never going to be anything like that and if you want any proof of that just go to the spars pandemic document and look it up they

16:55.816 --> 17:01.397
there was going to be an Epi girl like Jessica Rose and maybe that's what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:01.417 --> 17:02.257
was going to be too.

17:02.737 --> 17:07.378
But in the end, they were just going to say that the vaccine schedule of the past was pretty good.

17:07.859 --> 17:14.980
But the problem is there are some people with some genetic vulnerabilities to some of these components and we can't know which is all of them.

17:15.040 --> 17:21.261
And so, you know, the cool thing is, is that the pandemic proved to everybody on earth that the mRNA worked great.

17:21.722 --> 17:23.602
And the few people that believe it didn't,

17:24.122 --> 17:32.826
Well, they all are starting to believe now, because Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and soon Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:32.886 --> 17:43.591
probably will say that the original Pfizer shots produced under EUA and rolled out under pressure, billions of doses, they were contaminated.

17:44.292 --> 17:47.273
but we're not going to make the new generation of vaccines like that.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.694
And so everything's going to be fine.

17:48.734 --> 18:03.160
And then there you have it, you know, maybe, maybe Kevin McKernan's company will come out with a, you know, desktop RNA printer and you can just, you know, I want the measles vaccine and there comes out in the little tube and you can just inject it in the kid.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.764
And so, you know, you'll just have a real-time production of mRNA on command.

18:08.825 --> 18:13.609
And since mRNA is just, you know, it's in every cell in the body, so how could it be bad?

18:14.069 --> 18:19.514
And voila, the FDA and the CDC, you know, they don't need to look at anything anymore.

18:19.554 --> 18:22.136
So there's a lot of weird stuff to come.

18:22.196 --> 18:29.042
Maybe Robert Malone's company will get, you know, to be able to electroporate everybody and there'll be a little pain in the vaccine schedule again.

18:29.122 --> 18:29.442
I don't know.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.324
But I do know for sure it's going to be a nice show.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.725
I'm going to do it quick as I can.

18:35.126 --> 18:38.087
Because we do have a Friday basketball schedule, of course.

18:38.147 --> 18:39.528
The same thing, always going.

18:39.548 --> 18:43.470
It's so exciting that it's getting to be basketball season.

18:43.510 --> 18:46.852
We have about 45 days until the high school tryouts.

18:48.393 --> 18:53.135
And yeah, I feel like it's a really, it's going to be a really fun year.

18:53.215 --> 18:57.438
I don't know if, I guess I'm going to probably be the assistant coach of the eighth grade A team.

18:58.306 --> 19:00.667
Um, because they already have a head coach from last year.

19:00.727 --> 19:10.131
Who's got a son that plays and irrespective of, you know, what kids are the best and whatever, I think he's probably got seniority for, for coaching.

19:10.171 --> 19:17.675
And so I'll probably be an assistant, which is also great because then I can just keep the book and not feel as much pressure to have a plan all the time or.

19:18.732 --> 19:21.154
be everywhere early and this kind of thing.

19:21.194 --> 19:27.479
So even though I'm kind of, you know, sad that I think that's the way it's going to be because Kira really did a great tryout.

19:27.739 --> 19:30.061
The second tryout was just baller.

19:30.761 --> 19:35.324
And so I know for sure he's going to be on the A team and that's going to be good for him.

19:35.345 --> 19:36.085
He looked really

19:37.830 --> 19:39.432
you know, comfortable with those kids.

19:39.872 --> 19:49.902
He's kind of the last guy, you know, to start transitioning to full Saiyan status, if you will.

19:51.043 --> 19:54.887
And so all of his classmates now are slightly taller than him.

19:54.927 --> 20:01.714
But man, oh man, he's been working on his vertical jump with jump rope and stuff like that for quite some time now.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.928
And it's really paid off.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.369
He just jumps in a way that they don't jump.

20:06.429 --> 20:08.870
And it's not something that he's always had.

20:08.890 --> 20:09.830
He's really developed it.

20:09.850 --> 20:10.791
So I'm very proud of him.

20:10.851 --> 20:11.551
I'm very excited.

20:11.571 --> 20:12.251
I'm very excited.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.412
It's basketball season.

20:14.812 --> 20:17.793
I can't tell you how happy I am to have all of you here.

20:18.733 --> 20:21.534
Don't forget that Brian Hooker did not say autism in 2013.

20:21.674 --> 20:22.795
He was vaccine damaged.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.215
He was neurologically damaged.

20:30.537 --> 20:33.019
In condition that we will not call autism.

20:33.159 --> 20:34.700
I don't like the word autism.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.641
He was vaccine damaged.

20:38.663 --> 20:41.224
In condition that we will not call autism.

20:41.364 --> 20:42.926
I don't like the word autism.

20:43.806 --> 20:44.867
He was vaccine damaged.

20:45.207 --> 20:46.648
He was neurologically damaged.

20:47.529 --> 20:50.090
In condition that we will not call autism.

20:53.092 --> 20:54.613
I think truth is good for kids.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.816
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

20:59.352 --> 21:00.996
We want everybody to feel good.

21:01.117 --> 21:03.081
That's not the way life is.

21:29.414 --> 21:38.480
For decades, Tylenol was advertised as the pain reliever hospitals... I think I'm just gonna, sorry, pop myself in here for a second.

21:38.520 --> 21:46.285
So this is a video we actually watched a couple days ago, but it's taken on a little more significance to me as I put it into context.

21:47.926 --> 21:51.249
And you will see how this will come into context in a few minutes.

21:52.329 --> 21:55.971
But I just want to be clear what I'm saying here and be clear what you hear.

21:56.051 --> 22:11.117
We did hear last week, I kind of interrupted this video with a little bit of surprise when he said that he has autism and he has a book and he wrote a Wall Street Journal article saying he has autism and that's why this announcement matters.

22:12.437 --> 22:17.721
And I wasn't sure whether he actually was claiming that he has autism.

22:17.781 --> 22:28.729
So first, I just want to play this to reiterate the sort of context in which the next video that I'll play after the intro will fall under.

22:28.769 --> 22:36.034
And it's extraordinary because this really underscores the network of podcasters

22:37.463 --> 22:41.047
that forms this fake stage.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.909
Well, it's a real virtual stage.

22:42.989 --> 22:57.743
It's a stage that exists only on social media and only on these podcasts where these figures like Jay Bhattacharya could rise in awareness among a group of people

22:58.655 --> 23:10.096
by design and be completely off the radar of everybody else that never put in the right keywords and was happy to to be following the latest from the Biden White House.

23:12.321 --> 23:28.373
And so this military operation has been going on, not haphazardly, but very calculated and very meticulously over the last six years to make sure that all of us felt like, wow, the word is really getting out.

23:28.433 --> 23:30.035
People are starting to doubt.

23:34.844 --> 23:36.164
And that's the crazy part.

23:36.204 --> 23:50.848
No one was ever starting to doubt that just the people that were around us, just the people that would come to a CHD conference, just the people that we were, a lot of the people that we thought were part of the seeing through it were not real.

23:52.208 --> 24:01.710
They were anonymous accounts that were retweeting actors like Jessica Rose, retweeting actors like Robert Malone or Pierre Kory.

24:02.762 --> 24:06.663
And so the illusion was specifically on social media.

24:08.304 --> 24:14.766
And the illusion was so powerful that there were other places on social media where none of these conversations happened.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.626
None of these people existed.

24:17.006 --> 24:28.330
And that's why so many of our family and friends don't know any of the people that are on the bottom row of that very terrifying cast picture that I put up with Joe Rogan in the middle.

24:30.188 --> 24:37.210
And so listen carefully and understand the statement that I'm making is very, very clear.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.450
The autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

24:40.130 --> 24:53.153
And this man on the news is reinforcing that myth for the national security state by claiming he is autistic by being allowed to sell a book called Born Lucky.

24:55.031 --> 25:16.350
The director of the US Institutes of Health, my former friend, supposedly, is now on here, not clarifying what it means for him to be autistic versus someone to be neurologically damaged, for example, by a battery of vaccines being applied during an ear infection.

25:17.150 --> 25:21.193
like Brian Hooker's child, which might be a very rare case.

25:21.733 --> 25:25.156
Like, like, like, what is his name?

25:25.396 --> 25:26.056
Ed Handley?

25:26.537 --> 25:27.497
Is it Ed Handley?

25:27.978 --> 25:28.338
Sorry.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.382
So this is really funny.

25:34.843 --> 25:37.865
I looked at last night, you know, my bookshelf is very, very thorough.

25:38.585 --> 25:43.209
And on my bookshelf, I have all the numbers of the years on the top here so I can keep them in order.

25:44.069 --> 25:44.990
And it also helps them,

25:46.812 --> 25:50.254
It also helps with the memory palace kind of thing.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.136
All the books in this room represent books.

25:53.396 --> 25:55.858
Once you've read them, you keep them in certain places.

25:55.898 --> 25:59.060
You can keep them better in your head, too, believe it or not.

25:59.660 --> 26:03.063
And so that's one of the reasons why having a studio that's really your space

26:03.903 --> 26:07.627
that has been built up over time is really, really special.

26:08.328 --> 26:11.952
And so I'm sure now somebody will come and burn this down.

26:11.992 --> 26:16.136
But anyway, so yesterday I was talking about J.B.

26:16.257 --> 26:22.684
Handley's book, Autism Epidemic, and telling you about chapter four, because this is actually a really good book.

26:22.744 --> 26:24.185
And he was in that frontline

26:25.006 --> 26:40.610
PBS special about vaccines in February of 2015, right around the time when Brandy Vaughn was getting going, right around the time, right, that Vaxxed is being filmed and going to be released on April Fool's Day in 2016.

26:41.110 --> 26:47.672
And so this book is really special because, again, that guy is not one of the people that was in front of us.

26:49.042 --> 27:07.614
He was not one of the people that was in any of the Senate committees, although the other lady that was in this show, Barbara Lowe Fisher, was in front of us in a Senator Ron Johnson Senate committee, but of course surrounded by all of these people that I've been accusing of being national security actors for quite some time.

27:07.634 --> 27:12.238
So this book is interesting because this book is not published by

27:13.487 --> 27:27.216
Sky Horse Publishing, the one that has published all of these crazy other books of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and seemed to have this kind of theme, which goes all the way back to Jesse Ventura's

27:29.854 --> 27:45.851
autobiography, which has this chapter 13, or it's an epilogue really, there's 12 chapters and then there's an epilogue, so you call it chapter 13, where he runs for president, takes an independent candidate by the name of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.232
as his vice president,

27:47.973 --> 27:56.699
They win, and then Jesse the Body Ventura gets shot in this hypothetical fictional epilogue, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

27:56.759 --> 28:01.442
becomes President of the United States, and I guess saves the day.

28:02.643 --> 28:07.986
And so that's an interesting Skyhorse book, but this book was published by a company called Chelsea Green.

28:08.707 --> 28:17.153
Now the reason why Chelsea Green is very interesting, first on the back of this book you can see Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you can see Jenny McCarthy,

28:18.729 --> 28:20.430
And you can see Paul Thomas.

28:21.830 --> 28:36.596
And I think at least, I mean, I think all of them are probably, wittingly or unwittingly, part of this, you know, neutered or intellectually disarmed

28:37.688 --> 28:52.361
narrative where they may be convinced because they've never met Brandy Vaughn or Tony Barker or somebody like me maybe that can explain to them why what they're arguing isn't making any sense and why there's a biologically foolproof way to argue.

28:53.982 --> 29:04.251
But I think more than likely because of their positions and where they've been all this time and what they haven't been able to progress on for all this time, I think they're probably

29:05.011 --> 29:06.693
They've got to be scripted actors.

29:06.753 --> 29:08.274
So those three are in the back of that book.

29:08.314 --> 29:26.171
But what's interesting is in the same year, 2018, when this book came out, right, this is the same year that CHD is formed from the World Mercury Project changing its name and becoming Children's Health Defense with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.253
and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker.

29:29.608 --> 29:29.828
Right.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.212
So that's pretty sketch.

29:32.472 --> 29:40.404
Now, at least from my perspective, that's the organization that represents the controlled narrative.

29:40.444 --> 29:42.948
And so interestingly, Chelsea Green also put out this.

29:44.113 --> 29:49.936
pretty ambiguous and rather, I don't know, what would you call this guy?

29:49.976 --> 29:50.857
Dubious dude.

29:51.757 --> 30:00.102
This is Thomas Collins' book, which I guess is something about vaccines and autoimmunity and questioning things.

30:01.202 --> 30:06.425
But this is, of course, one of the primary no virus people from 2020 onward.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.567
And in fact, highly coordinated with

30:10.282 --> 30:14.464
Andrew Kaufman and who was on Steve Kirsch's podcast.

30:14.884 --> 30:23.129
So they're all one malevolent show and all one group of dead-end narrative shepherds.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.050
They're all cat herders.

30:26.121 --> 30:34.405
And no matter who you get caught by or who you decide to follow, you are following somebody that was ultimately a part of this script that would get us here.

30:35.125 --> 30:42.308
Where, you know, Tom Cowan won't tell you that autism is a myth and that people are being just toxically poisoned.

30:42.828 --> 30:45.050
And if he does, he doesn't say it clear enough.

30:45.330 --> 30:49.353
And he didn't say it clear enough at the beginning of the pandemic and still doesn't say it clear enough now.

30:50.754 --> 30:59.581
Exactly the same as Suzanne Humphries did when she went on Joe Rogan and didn't really say it very clearly at all when it can be said very clearly.

31:01.704 --> 31:03.586
That's the crazy part about it.

31:03.666 --> 31:15.537
And we got walked right into this all the way up until Steve Kirsch and Pierre Kory got their clocks cleaned by Dan Wilson and Dave Farina on stage in New York.

31:17.759 --> 31:19.781
Because that's where the script leads.

31:19.881 --> 31:25.326
The script leads to autism not being blamed on vaccines.

31:29.526 --> 31:38.948
and an ambiguous shrug of the shoulders and a moving forward with a transition to mRNA-based vaccines.

31:38.988 --> 31:40.688
That's probably the most likely way.

31:42.249 --> 31:54.211
Used most today, President Trump told the world, it could actually be the pain reliever taken by pregnant women that caused the massive spike in autism rates we've seen in the United States.

31:55.899 --> 31:58.180
Don't take Tylenol.

31:58.901 --> 32:00.281
There's no downside.

32:00.962 --> 32:01.622
Don't take it.

32:03.063 --> 32:04.163
You'll be uncomfortable.

32:04.343 --> 32:05.844
It won't be as easy, maybe.

32:06.544 --> 32:07.445
But don't take it.

32:08.105 --> 32:10.166
If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol.

32:11.267 --> 32:14.388
And don't give it to the baby after the baby is born.

32:14.408 --> 32:23.613
Today's press conference was admittedly bold and came with the caveat you should probably check with your doctor and have discussions with them.

32:24.964 --> 32:34.651
But, and this is the important part, it was a follow-through on the president and RFK's promise to have a report on the causes of autism by the end of September.

32:34.691 --> 32:37.573
And as you know, this is personal to me.

32:37.793 --> 32:40.195
Last week, I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.

32:40.295 --> 32:40.936
I'm autistic.

32:41.696 --> 32:42.357
RFK Jr.

32:42.437 --> 32:44.139
is right to hunt for the root causes.

32:44.679 --> 32:49.464
A condition that affects millions of children is too important to become another political football.

32:49.484 --> 32:55.930
With us now, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, former professor at Stanford School of Medicine.

32:56.270 --> 32:56.711
Pleasure, sir.

32:56.731 --> 33:06.080
I mean, it's amazing, after all this time, that we're still talking about autism as affecting millions of kids but being all one thing.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.791
It's, it's just so dumb.

33:10.671 --> 33:23.196
And the National Institutes of Health director, my, I guess, former friend, Jayanta Bhattacharya, who did all, all of his degrees at Stanford, because that's, I guess, how they do it.

33:27.178 --> 33:31.639
This is terrifying to me because this is just so easy for me to see through at this point.

33:31.679 --> 33:35.701
I feel like I'm in an insane asylum because this is nuts.

33:36.735 --> 33:41.200
There's no way all of these people can be serious the way that they talk about stuff.

33:42.941 --> 33:47.927
A phenomenon that they can't even list how they define it.

33:48.007 --> 33:49.688
No one knows how it's defined.

33:49.708 --> 33:54.754
What are you going to go to the description in one of these government handbooks?

33:54.874 --> 33:55.675
I mean, come on.

33:57.305 --> 34:02.727
As they say in radio, a long-time listener, first-time caller, big fan of your work for a long time.

34:03.727 --> 34:08.368
I'm not gonna talk to you about the medicine part of this because I think the press conference speaks for itself.

34:08.448 --> 34:09.449
People can talk to their doctor.

34:09.469 --> 34:10.329
You can do your own research.

34:11.109 --> 34:20.112
But this issue of autism, we've gone from one in 1,000 or one in 2,000 cases when I was a young boy and diagnosed with what we now know to be the condition.

34:20.532 --> 34:21.592
See what he said there?

34:21.672 --> 34:22.833
When I was a boy,

34:23.877 --> 34:27.960
And I was diagnosed with what we now know to be the condition.

34:29.841 --> 34:30.622
Did you hear that?

34:31.802 --> 34:35.825
So he was diagnosed probably with something else when he was younger.

34:35.965 --> 34:39.427
And now in retrospect says that that's autism.

34:39.488 --> 34:40.368
That's what that is.

34:41.849 --> 34:43.590
And that's what a lot of these people do.

34:44.771 --> 34:46.392
I didn't speak until I was four.

34:46.452 --> 34:46.652
Wow.

34:46.672 --> 34:47.873
You must've had autism.

34:51.536 --> 34:53.377
And that's not what autism is.

34:55.307 --> 34:59.389
And certainly this guy doesn't have autism.

34:59.449 --> 35:04.471
This is not the equivalent of Brian's son minus a lot of hard work.

35:06.752 --> 35:07.372
Listen to me.

35:08.673 --> 35:20.858
This is not the equivalent to Brian Hooker's son minus a lot of hard work on Brian's part, or a lot of hard work on a therapist's part, or a lot of hard work on Brian's son's part.

35:22.423 --> 35:25.064
It's not, because that's not how autism works.

35:26.344 --> 35:34.727
If autism is a genetic disorder, then it shouldn't be something that you can just use hard work to get over.

35:36.548 --> 35:38.289
Is that how it works with Down syndrome?

35:38.329 --> 35:39.449
They just have to work harder?

35:40.790 --> 35:41.710
Is that how it works?

35:45.151 --> 35:46.712
Holy man, this is gross.

35:48.044 --> 35:48.685
Now it's one in 36.

35:49.406 --> 35:50.607
For boys, it's one in 12.

35:51.068 --> 35:52.570
Minority boys, it's even higher.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.933
It's crazy, the explosion in cases.

35:55.654 --> 36:02.863
Why has it been so hard to get, and I'll put it in air quotes, science to take this question seriously?

36:03.387 --> 36:05.288
I mean, I think there's like a couple of things going on here.

36:05.348 --> 36:18.154
So first, whenever doctors and scientists don't understand something, especially when doctors don't understand something, we often just treat patients who have it like they don't know what they're talking about, that the condition's not real in some ways.

36:18.855 --> 36:23.197
And I mean, I think there's some of that, like there's lots of groups of marginalized patients like that.

36:24.477 --> 36:25.718
But also for autism,

36:26.018 --> 36:30.940
you know, there's a history of this people talking about vaccines being connected to autism.

36:31.380 --> 36:37.523
And, of course, vaccines are a tremendously important part of what doctors have in our portfolio of things we can do to actually keep people healthy.

36:38.543 --> 36:44.266
If there is a link, no one wants to talk about it, because what if it reduces the demand for vaccines that would keep people healthy?

36:45.266 --> 36:53.990
I think those two things have made it so that it's so hard to get an honest conversation, because, you know, I'm pretty sure that it's probably not going to be vaccines as the cause,

36:55.531 --> 36:58.995
But by saying that, I'm acting as if I already know for a fact.

36:59.876 --> 37:03.240
And in fact, I don't know why the rise in autism has happened.

37:03.420 --> 37:03.861
I don't know.

37:03.941 --> 37:04.902
I don't have an answer to that.

37:04.922 --> 37:07.946
If you asked me to pin down one thing, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

37:08.556 --> 37:15.143
It seems as though when we're watching coverage, and I don't like saying this, but I predicted this last week.

37:15.183 --> 37:27.795
I predicted in my op-ed when this report came out there was going to be far more anger about what might be the causes and saying it's wrong than in the important work to find out what is.

37:27.815 --> 37:30.297
This is just some of the doctors from today.

37:30.357 --> 37:30.798
Take a listen.

37:31.812 --> 37:37.798
I think it is pretty solid that there is no association with the set of menophine or Tylenol given in pregnancy and autism.

37:37.838 --> 37:46.968
This was a dangerously irresponsible thing for President Trump to say when he said, tough it out, because that only puts children at higher risk, especially with fever in the first trimester.

37:47.068 --> 37:56.435
I'm very worried that if we take away the one last option based on really junk science, when there is not evidence to do this, we're going to end up causing more harm than good.

37:56.695 --> 37:57.956
We can't just do the willy-nilly.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.177
We have to be serious about it.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.659
And frankly, there is no link when you look at the best evidence.

38:03.539 --> 38:18.148
What I am more worried about when I hear that is... What I'm more worried about is two of the three people they just played there were Indians, as far as I can tell, and now we have an Indian absolute fraud at the head of the NIH, and I hate saying that.

38:19.809 --> 38:20.409
I really do.

38:21.189 --> 38:26.573
But there's no other way that I can explain my relationship with Jayanta Bhattacharya.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.474
I shouldn't know him.

38:29.491 --> 38:34.478
I shouldn't have multiple selfies with him over multiple years.

38:35.379 --> 38:42.228
I should not have had a conversation with him before the election, which directed me to shut up about Robert Malone.

38:43.533 --> 38:50.319
I shouldn't have had a conversation with him before the election where he told me he would likely be the NIH director if Trump won.

38:51.019 --> 39:01.228
That shouldn't be the reality that I'm living in, where now he's the NIH director, aka NIH podcast representative.

39:02.762 --> 39:22.190
Like, this doesn't make any sense to me, just like it doesn't make any sense to me that I'm listed as an expert in that stupid Wuhan cover-up book that's supposedly written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I was supposedly on many Zoom calls with, and now he's the head of HHS just shaking hands with the guy at Pfizer.

39:22.950 --> 39:26.112
The only explanation I have is that that's by design.

39:27.096 --> 39:34.621
by the national security state, which is the, you know, the part of our government structure that supersedes all other parts.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.544
And that's how I explain this.

39:39.624 --> 39:41.185
Then it all makes sense.

39:41.685 --> 39:46.408
Then Piper Stover makes sense, and her connections to an ambassador makes sense.

39:46.888 --> 39:49.370
Then the involvement of the State Department makes sense.

39:49.870 --> 39:55.994
Then all of these weird things that otherwise, you know, why the hell are all these people coming to my house?

39:57.284 --> 39:58.124
Now they make sense.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.685
It's because this whole thing is a national security theater.

40:03.345 --> 40:22.169
And they were using Donald Trump very specifically to make the pandemic go extremely smoothly for them to have plausible deniability about every aspect of it so that they could misconstrue the effects of an imaginary spike protein or an imaginary fear and cleavage site or an imaginary HIV insert.

40:23.499 --> 40:28.203
with the known and expected effects of transfecting humans.

40:31.706 --> 40:40.113
And that includes the known and expected downsides of injecting people with lipid nanoparticles, whatever those were, especially coated with PEG.

40:42.961 --> 40:46.583
This is a very important time for us to wake up right now.

40:46.643 --> 40:59.011
And more importantly, wake our kids up to share this with our children, explain to them how it is that we were taken, how we were fooled and how both sides are still being fooled right now.

40:59.771 --> 41:02.373
Just right now, the pendulum is about to swing backward.

41:02.853 --> 41:11.879
You know, a lot of the people who, who voted for Donald Trump are either going to have to come to the, to the, to have a taste for crow.

41:13.374 --> 41:17.318
or we're going to have a little bit of a mental crisis for a lot of these people in America.

41:18.599 --> 41:24.405
What my mother used to say to me sometimes, seldom right but never in doubt, in that

41:25.450 --> 41:27.352
It reminds me of what we heard about COVID.

41:27.432 --> 41:30.194
If you get the vaccine, you cannot get COVID.

41:30.234 --> 41:31.134
We are positive.

41:31.315 --> 41:34.457
And if you say anything else... But why does it remind you of that?

41:34.537 --> 41:35.638
You have autism.

41:35.738 --> 41:42.984
So aren't you a little worried that after all this, he has autism, but he's not familiar with this debate?

41:44.127 --> 41:46.248
He's not familiar with all these people.

41:46.288 --> 41:48.088
He's not familiar with the movie Vax.

41:48.128 --> 41:56.331
You see, the thing is, he claims to have had autism his whole life, to have been diagnosed when he was young, to have known and have written a book about it.

41:56.412 --> 42:02.714
So the whole concept that he's also not the best at explaining why,

42:03.414 --> 42:07.336
autism isn't caused by the vaccine is kind of extraordinary, right?

42:07.356 --> 42:17.562
He's just a news guy who happens to have autism, but he's going to let Jayanta Bhattacharya, who deferred to me the times that I've ever talked to him as the biologist, explain it to him.

42:17.842 --> 42:18.122
Wow.

42:18.883 --> 42:19.883
Must be wearing a tin hat.

42:20.243 --> 42:21.744
You remember, these people did that to you.

42:22.365 --> 42:26.427
Why is this now the same thing about any discussion of causes of autism?

42:26.917 --> 42:32.899
Just remember though that PEG being in something that you drink or eat is not the same thing as injecting PEG.

42:33.999 --> 42:42.842
And so you can imagine a scenario in my mind where the exposure to PEG all of your life could have sensitized you to a little to it a little bit.

42:42.882 --> 42:45.843
Maybe even your kind of get upset stomach from it.

42:45.903 --> 42:50.045
But once it's inside, that could be a different story.

42:50.125 --> 42:52.445
I'm just I'm just throwing that out there.

42:52.465 --> 42:54.146
I mean, I know that PEG is in all kinds of

42:54.907 --> 43:03.207
of stuff, but it is something that has at least been reported to provoke allergic reaction over time.

43:04.417 --> 43:07.078
I mean, I think like you just heard it here on those clips, right?

43:07.098 --> 43:10.379
They've read the literature, I guess, and they've decided they made up their minds.

43:10.699 --> 43:11.759
I've read the literature also.

43:12.300 --> 43:14.660
The dean of the Harvard... They've read the literature.

43:14.961 --> 43:16.101
I've read the literature.

43:16.181 --> 43:19.642
So that's a pretty bold statement because there is a shit ton of literature.

43:19.702 --> 43:20.963
And that's the problem here.

43:21.443 --> 43:24.784
These people talking in such ridiculous terms.

43:27.245 --> 43:28.745
Because that's not what this is about.

43:28.785 --> 43:31.946
You don't read a few papers and then, you know, that's it.

43:32.927 --> 43:33.887
Now you understand it.

43:35.523 --> 43:40.025
What he should be saying is I've attempted to try to understand what autism is.

43:40.085 --> 43:46.108
I've tried to understand what these parents want and are concerned about what their individual experience has told them.

43:46.568 --> 43:51.251
I've also tried to understand what these vaccinologists have to say and what these virologists have to say.

43:51.691 --> 43:55.513
And I've come to the conclusion that X, Y, and Z, but that's not what he says.

43:55.973 --> 44:04.117
He said that he's read the literature and come to a different conclusion than these other people that he assumes have read the literature as well.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.835
So is this just a mental retention game?

44:08.275 --> 44:18.282
Like you read all the papers and then you just kind of do a little meta analysis in your head and you say, I'm drawing the conclusion that I think autism is not caused by the vaccines.

44:18.642 --> 44:27.469
And then other people have just done the mental math and said, well, you know, after all that reading, I've decided that I think there is a connection between the vaccines and autism.

44:27.509 --> 44:32.052
This is so, it's so dumb.

44:33.502 --> 44:57.379
and the reason why it's so dumb is because Jayanta Bhattacharya is an improvising but scripted fraud and so anytime he goes off script even a little bit he sounds like a moron and that was him right there feeling very confident in himself and he should because no one's ever going to let him see this video that's for sure you could take clips of this that Jeff from Earth might make

44:57.799 --> 45:08.848
and put them all over Twitter and all over Facebook and all over Instagram and tag him on every one of those social media websites and I'll bet you thousands of dollars that he wouldn't see one of them.

45:09.629 --> 45:26.063
Because just like social media is used to isolate us from our family and friends and isolate us into a small microcosm of stupid podcast actors and stupid podcast actors asking stupid podcast scripted questions,

45:27.861 --> 45:47.208
but they do the same thing to those actors so that those actors, a lot of them actually are unwittingly participating because they believe their success reflects their correctness, their ability to do their job, their ability to get sponsors and views is all that they're thinking about.

45:47.288 --> 45:53.591
And so that's why some of these people have Howard Stern as their childhood idol.

45:56.141 --> 46:00.082
because it's about attention more than anything else.

46:01.883 --> 46:19.008
And there's some real irony in that because I have a video queued up of ZDoggMD who says that this is really actually a very big opportunity in 2021 for people who really wanted a lot of attention to go out and get it when they could have never before.

46:19.449 --> 46:20.749
And it's just hilarious.

46:20.789 --> 46:21.969
And so that's what this is.

46:22.049 --> 46:23.490
This is a scripted,

46:24.250 --> 46:36.378
Governance by Podcast, National Security Operation, where the head of the NIH is a stooge that cannot have a real conversation about anything biological.

46:36.978 --> 46:50.567
If you get into the details of anything technical from a methodological perspective, or even from an experimental design perspective, this guy would be out of his league and he would admit it because he's just an epidemiologist who used to work on flu.

46:57.799 --> 47:07.465
I'm really upset because they brought me into contact with this guy and he pretended to befriend me and pretended that he really liked me and has learned more biology from me than anybody else during the pandemic.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.467
He actually said that to me face to face.

47:12.709 --> 47:15.611
I could smell the curry on his suit when he said it to me.

47:17.185 --> 47:20.126
School of Medicine agrees with me, that there is an association.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.506
Now, do I know for certain that it's a cause?

47:23.367 --> 47:25.247
I don't know, but I agree with President Trump.

47:26.067 --> 47:31.629
If you can avoid taking Tylenol in pregnancy, then it's wise to try to avoid it, right?

47:31.669 --> 47:33.069
Actually, it's true for any medicine.

47:33.089 --> 47:41.251
You want to be careful with any medicine, but especially when there's a potential link to something you don't want for your child later on, and if it's a low-grade fever.

47:41.331 --> 47:42.472
An LNP with

47:44.132 --> 47:59.536
With an mRNA and it is a lot better or us, you know a whole assortment of mRNAs and small mRNAs and micro RNAs Those that lipid nanoparticle preparation is also fine during during Pregnancy, just not Tylenol Tylenol is bad.

48:00.356 --> 48:06.938
You can manage without it then you try Thank you for watching subscribe below and download That was loud, sorry about that.

48:06.958 --> 48:08.098
Holy cow falling behind here hit it and

48:16.897 --> 48:19.838
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

48:19.858 --> 48:21.938
Intramuscular injection remains dumb.

48:22.058 --> 48:23.239
RNA cannot pandemic.

48:23.699 --> 48:26.600
Transpection is a crime and autism is a myth.

48:26.660 --> 48:29.380
I hope I'm making myself very clear today.

48:30.581 --> 48:32.561
This is part of the Independent Bright Web.

48:32.601 --> 48:35.322
Give Your Own Biological coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

48:36.002 --> 48:41.849
Trying to get everybody off of social media trying to get you to get your kids off of social media We can do it other ways.

48:41.909 --> 48:50.619
There are other ways to do it Mastodon is a way to do it if you don't want to do it with with soapbox or peer tube There's at least mastodon out there.

48:50.639 --> 48:51.460
There are ways that

48:51.900 --> 48:58.906
that people can have a federated internet where everybody's hosting their own thing, and it's still all connected.

48:59.407 --> 49:03.270
And that's what stream.gigaohm.bio is with Peertube.

49:03.290 --> 49:16.101
And as soon as we get another Peertube instance up for Housatonic, you're going to see how that interconnectivity works and how one channel can promote another channel.

49:16.141 --> 49:18.544
And it all works kind of well together.

49:19.664 --> 49:31.970
And of course the app will then allow you to have both my own work and that of Mark's separate but available on the platform's part of that app.

49:32.030 --> 49:33.751
So it's really, really cool.

49:34.752 --> 49:38.874
And that's why the cheese is free on social media because they're taking everything.

49:39.614 --> 49:42.917
And they want you to love it so much to fight for it.

49:42.957 --> 49:46.861
They want you to love it so much that you demand it.

49:47.522 --> 49:48.783
And why would they do this?

49:49.424 --> 49:50.545
Why would they do this?

49:50.625 --> 49:52.627
This is the question you need to be asking.

49:53.047 --> 49:57.632
And the answer is that there will never be more genetic diversity available again.

49:58.737 --> 50:02.699
We are at a time point when human diversity is at its peak for all time.

50:02.739 --> 50:04.919
They know the population is about to crash.

50:05.540 --> 50:09.501
And so it's one big theater with one big cast that all trusts the script.

50:10.062 --> 50:18.365
And that's why yelling at the stage or tweeting or even showing up at a conference is not going to change their script because that's not how theater works.

50:20.035 --> 50:21.596
That's not how theater works.

50:21.636 --> 50:31.027
We're gonna try and make America real again though by teaching this to our young people and trying to build an independent bright web.

50:32.659 --> 50:33.860
Good to see you there, Arthur.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.962
No steak knives for you today.

50:36.643 --> 50:38.865
You joining at just the right time, though.

50:38.905 --> 50:39.205
It's good.

50:39.305 --> 50:39.625
It's good.

50:40.186 --> 50:40.726
Good to see you.

50:41.867 --> 50:43.449
We are going to get into the meat of the show.

50:43.509 --> 50:51.796
I just shared a video that I actually shared about three days ago of Jayanta Bhattacharya, just to recap for Arthur there.

50:54.657 --> 51:04.238
And it was a video where he's talking to this guy on News Nation who starts the clip by saying that he is a guy with autism.

51:05.416 --> 51:07.258
And I found that quite fascinating.

51:07.298 --> 51:11.361
I actually didn't know for sure if he meant himself or if he was talking about his kid.

51:12.341 --> 51:14.423
And it turns out he was talking about himself.

51:14.523 --> 51:20.628
So this show, which is titled Jay Says Jayanta is a Fraud, is actually also about that dude.

51:21.308 --> 51:30.755
And about what that dude is accomplishing by having Jayanta Bhattacharya on his show and talking about autism and all agreeing that I guess he's had it.

51:31.916 --> 51:34.858
We've got to show our kids the truth so that they can see it.

51:36.059 --> 51:42.844
And then they won't need to fight about it anymore because they will understand why vaccines don't cause autism.

51:42.884 --> 51:50.669
And they will understand why autism in the definition of the NIH and all of these people could never be caused by autism more or less.

51:51.449 --> 51:59.235
And that doesn't change anything about maybe even Brian Hooker's story or Pauly Tommy's story or any of these other parents' stories.

51:59.295 --> 52:00.896
They're just very rare stories.

52:03.619 --> 52:08.045
And the truth will set you free because the biology explains those stories.

52:08.165 --> 52:08.806
That's really it.

52:13.112 --> 52:16.156
So the peg was in the mattress fabric.

52:18.681 --> 52:19.081
Oh, wow.

52:19.901 --> 52:20.241
Yikes.

52:21.562 --> 52:23.542
I didn't understand what I was reading there for a second.

52:23.562 --> 52:24.522
I had to look at the chat.

52:24.662 --> 52:26.123
Please show your children the truth.

52:26.963 --> 52:29.623
Teach them why the cheese is free on social media.

52:29.663 --> 52:31.884
Because it's a military weapon, ladies and gentlemen.

52:31.904 --> 52:35.745
It would be wonderful if all the college kids were on social media.

52:35.765 --> 52:37.105
They could do all kinds of things.

52:37.205 --> 52:39.206
Motivate them to do all kinds of things.

52:39.306 --> 52:40.466
Ladies and gentlemen,

52:41.306 --> 52:47.294
The parents and children and future parents of children in America need to stay focused on the biology.

52:47.935 --> 52:53.864
They need to not take the bait on social media by really almost, for all practical purposes, leaving social media.

52:54.927 --> 52:55.988
And you need to love your neighbor.

52:56.368 --> 53:08.117
We need to start building our own websites, and our own PeerTube instances, and our own Soapbox instances, just like Truth Social is, just like Blue Sky is.

53:08.697 --> 53:10.619
I know that sounds kind of odd, but it's true.

53:11.199 --> 53:15.002
They're not being used appropriately right now, or correctly right now, or whatever.

53:15.022 --> 53:15.902
I guess they are, right?

53:15.942 --> 53:18.825
Because you can follow anybody on those on Soapbox as well.

53:19.625 --> 53:26.612
So it's really just a question of understanding that this is a script and that's why this comedy exists.

53:26.652 --> 53:27.493
Don't take Tylenol.

53:28.014 --> 53:28.654
Don't take it.

53:28.874 --> 53:30.336
With Tylenol, don't take it.

53:30.936 --> 53:31.637
Don't take it.

53:31.797 --> 53:33.599
That's the reason why they were able to do this.

53:33.639 --> 53:34.300
Don't take Tylenol.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.162
Don't take Tylenol.

53:36.422 --> 53:37.143
Fight like hell.

53:38.431 --> 54:01.678
and uh that's why we are here welcome to the show ladies and gentlemen it's good to see everybody uh let me think what do i want to do here i want to do this one and then i want to do this one does that work yes good morning uh good afternoon it's 1 18 p.m we are way behind schedule as usual here uh gigaohm biological is not typically punctual it's something that you're just gonna have to get used to until this

54:02.338 --> 54:04.799
This train starts to run a little smoothly.

54:04.839 --> 54:06.199
I do have some good news.

54:07.380 --> 54:12.821
My wife is in pursuit of a remote-based job.

54:14.462 --> 54:15.282
It's in Dutch.

54:15.342 --> 54:16.522
That kind of helps a little bit.

54:17.103 --> 54:25.145
But that does mean that there are some things that, you know, just will take a little more time in the morning or... I don't know.

54:25.265 --> 54:28.286
It's just you're not going to get a notification all the time about

54:28.746 --> 54:48.977
necessarily when the show is going to come on unless I'm able to tell Fela early enough in the morning so if we get up in the morning and I've got my deck together and I know I'm going to go on at 10 10 I can probably get her to get a notification about but on the days that she's going to work this little job to try and make our ends meet

54:50.558 --> 54:52.439
Then there won't be any notification.

54:52.479 --> 54:55.922
And maybe what I'll be able to do is put something up on Soapbox or something like that.

54:55.942 --> 54:57.003
We'll have to work this out.

54:58.123 --> 55:00.445
I can also get the email list.

55:00.465 --> 55:01.986
But she does quite a bit more than that.

55:02.587 --> 55:05.289
And so I don't know where this is going to go from here.

55:05.329 --> 55:07.090
But overall this is still a very good thing.

55:07.665 --> 55:15.729
The important thing is that I'm going to be on more often, so the notification will be less important because you can just kind of count on me being around for sure on the weekdays.

55:15.789 --> 55:25.854
We're still, you know, people on social media are still engaged in trying to change the plot of the Star Trek Enterprise show that they're watching, not realizing that the U.S.

55:25.894 --> 55:30.876
government is completely out of their control and that the truth isn't available on social media.

55:30.916 --> 55:31.957
But that's really the truth.

55:32.377 --> 55:34.038
They might as well be watching Star Trek.

55:34.999 --> 55:53.597
And that's the way that now I finally have hope that we can get out because that's a message, that is a sort of doorway out that any reasonable teenager and any reasonable young adult can see as a possibility and openly consider it.

55:54.338 --> 56:06.450
And once you can start to explain it like that, that a lot of these people are employed just to create this drama on social media and created to kind of give the impression that something meaningful is happening there.

56:06.470 --> 56:07.250
And that's really it.

56:08.512 --> 56:12.015
The script is not even something that they need to be especially familiar with.

56:12.055 --> 56:16.159
And that's the reason why Jayanta Bhattacharya can do what he's doing right now.

56:17.904 --> 56:19.965
I'm really trying to seek the truth together.

56:20.066 --> 56:22.627
I believe that's what that means there in Latin.

56:23.568 --> 56:32.135
It has been a six or seven year operation that is a much longer operation in its expanding, you know, whatever.

56:33.396 --> 56:35.557
It's been very long, but I think 2021 is really a crucial year

56:37.919 --> 56:50.864
in these people's collective history because you can see that 2021 is kind of the year where all of these people were recruited and then they spread out across the internet to do as much damage as possible.

56:51.997 --> 56:56.700
And so yesterday I showed you an example of what Charlie Sheen was saying.

56:57.281 --> 57:07.208
Charlie Sheen is an especially interesting character because he plays a very crucial role in the 9-11 narrative control as outlined very nicely by my friend Mark Kulak.

57:08.048 --> 57:15.734
Some of his most recent work has been trying to propose an alternative explanation for 9-11 that doesn't involve

57:16.775 --> 57:25.404
orbiting space lasers or, I don't know, a small country in the Middle East being able to control the world with blackmail.

57:26.685 --> 57:35.454
So after these six years, I've come to understand that one of the traps that we've been in is trying to process these events on this short

57:36.095 --> 57:39.137
timescale or short time horizons of social media.

57:39.557 --> 57:42.800
And that was especially true here at the beginning of the pandemic.

57:42.840 --> 57:50.505
And in fact, that's when these actors were all seeded in our collective experience and then spread out to do the most damage over the next five years.

57:50.945 --> 57:55.548
And also to kind of seed this narrative that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:55.628 --> 57:57.770
is a viable candidate for president and then

57:58.567 --> 58:02.590
would cross over to be part of the Trump administration late in the election.

58:03.110 --> 58:18.160
Not that dissimilar, again, to that Skyhorse publishing book that I mentioned a few minutes ago, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me by Jesse Ventura, which ends in this epilogue where a very similar thing happens, including the shooting of the president.

58:18.220 --> 58:28.007
So, you know, Donald Trump being shot in 2024 or supposedly being shot by somebody that went to the same high school as my kid is part of this narrative as well.

58:29.187 --> 58:41.589
Don't don't make any mistakes here I take this very seriously because a lot of these people came to my house because they Claimed to have shot the president or they claim that a kid shot.

58:41.629 --> 58:45.670
The president came from my kids high school This is not a joke to me.

58:45.730 --> 58:57.292
This is extremely serious Also, I was flown to California a couple three times where I just happened to meet Jayanta Bhattacharya and that's also in retrospect not by accident

58:58.106 --> 59:11.835
This is a lot of money and a lot of people and a lot of influence being used on me to try and make it seem like, make it feel like I was doing something significant, that significant people were listening to me, when in fact it was the opposite.

59:12.235 --> 59:18.799
They were programming social media and doing everything they could to make sure that nobody would hear what I had to say.

59:20.180 --> 59:27.044
And they went so far as to include me as an expert in the Wuhan cover-up book, I assume primarily to discredit me.

59:29.366 --> 59:45.679
And so it will be interesting to see how long it will take any newspapers in the United States to react to my press sort of bundle where they get a book and a description to how I think I was defrauded by this book because I don't agree with what's in the book.

59:45.739 --> 59:47.360
It's not what I wanted it to say.

59:47.761 --> 59:50.323
They've kind of taken a lot of my quotes out of context.

59:50.783 --> 59:54.626
And I'm pretty disappointed because I thought that I had the ear of this guy, but I don't.

59:54.686 --> 59:57.869
And so now I want to say that this book and this dude's a fraud.

59:59.059 --> 01:00:05.421
And if no newspapers in America will pick up that story, where are we in America right now?

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:12.444
That's the question you need to ask yourself, because this is frightening, because it's for all the marbles.

01:00:12.504 --> 01:00:15.285
That's why Israel and Gaza is so ridiculous.

01:00:15.305 --> 01:00:16.985
That's why these guys are so ridiculous.

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:19.466
That's why there's a global fake health freedom movement.

01:00:19.506 --> 01:00:24.048
It expands the English reading part of the globe.

01:00:24.815 --> 01:00:37.104
And in fact, more than that, because it's in Germany and in the UK and all these places and social media is demonstrating its power to all of the governments of the world.

01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:40.326
That's what you really need to see.

01:00:41.807 --> 01:00:45.150
Demonstrating its power to all the governments of the world.

01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:58.065
even probably making predictions and promises about what the public opinion will be in the coming weeks and probably already delivered on those promises in previous demonstrations.

01:00:58.145 --> 01:00:59.825
This is serious, ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:59.845 --> 01:01:02.546
We are in an actual trap.

01:01:08.828 --> 01:01:10.389
And Sean the Sheep, he agrees.

01:01:10.409 --> 01:01:11.009
He agrees.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:18.518
And so the bad biology has to be unlearned evolution because DNA is nonsense.

01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:19.339
We can unlearn this.

01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:21.059
We can teach something different to our kids.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.120
Peertube is the app to download.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:23.660
Please do it.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.442
I don't want to harp on it too much, but I do think it's really seriously that good.

01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:28.682
It plays better.

01:01:29.782 --> 01:01:30.463
It's reliable.

01:01:30.503 --> 01:01:31.603
It doesn't collect your data.

01:01:31.623 --> 01:01:32.663
It's a very small app.

01:01:32.724 --> 01:01:33.504
It's super useful.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:33.824
I love.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:38.048
I love watching Mark on that as opposed to YouTube.

01:01:38.908 --> 01:01:39.329
It's great.

01:01:39.389 --> 01:01:41.691
These are the truths that we have been pushing lately.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:42.932
I think they're pretty solid.

01:01:43.432 --> 01:01:46.095
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.956
Transfection of healthy humans is a crime.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:48.937
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:01:49.017 --> 01:01:50.659
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:01:51.198 --> 01:01:53.079
And a man who thinks he's a woman is not normal.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:02.086
But the cosmetic transformation, regardless of specific details, results in a transitioned or trans man, not a trans woman.

01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:05.689
And once you fix the language, there's no more controversy.

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:09.232
Ladies and gentlemen, that's what fifth generation warfare is all about.

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.293
That's why they have the

01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:22.879
some guy with a very articulate, successful, handsome guy with no apparent disabilities, claiming that he has autism and talking to the NIH director as if that's just a normal claim.

01:02:22.979 --> 01:02:24.480
It's not a normal claim.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:31.223
It's a very, very awful and disingenuous claim that Brian Hooker is also actually behind.

01:02:31.323 --> 01:02:32.764
You can tell if someone's lying.

01:02:33.404 --> 01:02:35.125
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:02:36.974 --> 01:02:37.675
And I have lied.

01:02:37.695 --> 01:02:38.735
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:39.696
I don't want to lie.

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.517
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:42.658
I try not to be a liar.

01:02:42.698 --> 01:02:43.538
I don't want to be a liar.

01:02:44.118 --> 01:02:46.860
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.661
And why is Brian Hooker behind it?

01:02:48.701 --> 01:02:54.044
Brian Hooker is behind it because he in 2013 did not use the word autism.

01:02:54.064 --> 01:02:55.545
He didn't like the word autism.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.327
And in 2015, he started calling it autism.

01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:07.206
Brian Hooker is a part of it because for 16 years he was genetically modifying plants to make medicines.

01:03:07.286 --> 01:03:11.734
Not that dissimilar to what somebody who works for the Human Genome Project might do.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.497
You know, like Kevin McKernan.

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:18.532
And these people are both behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:03:18.693 --> 01:03:28.019
and CHD and this, you know, wild goose chase about DNA contamination that may or may not come to public knowledge as a debate point.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:41.710
But if it does, it will be further excused to make RNA better, but not actually faulted on a biological principle, you know, that we don't understand enough about ourselves to inject RNA and hope that it works.

01:03:42.915 --> 01:03:46.237
We can't augment ourselves by injecting some instructions.

01:03:46.317 --> 01:03:47.617
That's so stupid.

01:03:48.498 --> 01:04:08.648
And that we are accepting this as normal is only because there is a chorus of people that is canvassing mainstream media, canvassing the blogosphere on Substack, and canvassing the podcast universe with actors.

01:04:10.427 --> 01:04:20.794
The national security state has realized that conversations between two scripted actors are the best way to convince people of things that are not true.

01:04:21.594 --> 01:04:22.815
And now we're here.

01:04:23.376 --> 01:04:29.540
And we think that real things are happening on social media, that these illusions of consensus are real.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:39.907
We are at the stage where the now NIH director actually started a fricking sub stack called illusion of consensus and stole that from me.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:49.141
I think that was in 2023 that he started that blog.

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:50.705
And I had already said it in 22.

01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:53.252
Like it's just, it's sad.

01:04:54.158 --> 01:04:57.961
This whole thing is really sad because I can see it too easily now.

01:04:58.421 --> 01:05:01.744
There was a population pyramid prediction in the 90s.

01:05:01.784 --> 01:05:05.767
They already knew that this was going to be a disaster for social security.

01:05:05.787 --> 01:05:22.920
It was going to be a disaster for the NHS in the UK because all of these countries after World War II have the same population bump where people came back and had big families for a few years until a coordinated global campaign to tell people to stop having such big families worked.

01:05:24.062 --> 01:05:28.144
Around the same time, you know, China decided to have a one-child policy.

01:05:28.164 --> 01:05:29.125
And so then guess what?

01:05:29.165 --> 01:05:30.706
They also have a bump like this.

01:05:31.286 --> 01:05:34.368
And so they also had an aging population to manage.

01:05:34.788 --> 01:05:36.269
And that's also an opportunity.

01:05:36.329 --> 01:05:43.252
If you're willing to kill a few people and lie about it, you could even misconstrue it as a global pandemic.

01:05:44.593 --> 01:05:50.636
But if this population pyramid prediction is uniform across all of these developed nations.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:51.937
Stop lying!

01:05:52.377 --> 01:05:53.298
That's the problem.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.883
And how long have I been saying it this clearly?

01:05:56.944 --> 01:06:10.644
And how long have all of these people that include actuaries and people with five post-secondary degrees that are also surfers have never been able to articulate this very, very simple and extraordinary fact?

01:06:11.769 --> 01:06:14.511
that they expected arise in all-cause mortality.

01:06:14.991 --> 01:06:18.474
And somehow or another, they lost control of pneumonia for two years.

01:06:18.954 --> 01:06:23.438
And they also lost control of a street opioid epidemic.

01:06:23.498 --> 01:06:25.059
So it's weird, right?

01:06:25.099 --> 01:06:26.220
The math is so easy.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:30.743
Like one plus one plus one equals three.

01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:31.524
Done.

01:06:35.154 --> 01:06:57.004
And so it also is striking that during the rise and the development of this rise in all-cause mortality, these anti-vax groups with the anti-vax movies, with the anti-vax UK people like Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield all started to coalesce, or maybe the better word should be congeal, on American soil.

01:07:00.956 --> 01:07:07.161
And that congealing continued until Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were dead.

01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:09.282
Did I say that right?

01:07:09.322 --> 01:07:10.703
I thought I mixed them up for a second.

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:16.408
And so this is just the most malevolent of timelines.

01:07:17.288 --> 01:07:22.893
And so again, I've encouraged people to go back to 2021, 2022 to look at the timeline.

01:07:22.933 --> 01:07:25.815
Here we go back to, I believe we're going back to 2020,

01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:29.016
Where is this?

01:07:29.036 --> 01:07:30.297
I don't know what video this is.

01:07:30.377 --> 01:07:31.959
I can't from the free press.

01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:32.359
Oh, yeah.

01:07:32.379 --> 01:07:33.560
This is right now.

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.480
I'm Barry Weiss.

01:07:35.141 --> 01:07:39.424
Leland Vittert is one of America's most recognizable television correspondents.

01:07:39.885 --> 01:07:46.429
You'll know his face from years of frontline reporting in places like Egypt, Libya, Israel, Ukraine.

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:55.096
You may have also followed his tumultuous exit from Fox News in twenty twenty one after clashing with the network over their coverage of Donald Trump.

01:07:55.516 --> 01:07:56.197
Wait, what?

01:07:56.297 --> 01:08:00.684
He left Fox News because of their coverage of Donald Trump?

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:02.407
Who is this guy again?

01:08:02.587 --> 01:08:03.028
Who is it?

01:08:03.769 --> 01:08:10.759
And then perhaps his redemption arc, becoming the host of On Balance and the chief Washington anchor at NewsNation.

01:08:11.926 --> 01:08:16.948
What you might not know, I certainly didn't, is that Leland Vittert is autistic.

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:25.530
He's just written a book about it called Born Lucky, a dedicated father, a grateful son, and my journey with autism.

01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:39.175
In it, Leland explains that he didn't speak until the age of three, that he was born severely cross-eyed and struggled with basic concepts like eye contact, humor, conversational cues, and social rules.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:44.802
Suffice it to say, his middle school and high school years were nothing short of hell.

01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:52.524
So how did the kid that I'm describing go from being totally lost, socially isolated?

01:08:52.544 --> 01:09:00.367
If you want to see evidence that this child is a totally scripted fraud, you should go look at her first Joe Rogan appearance.

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:08.032
She looks like a 16-year-old or 18-year-old or 19-year-old college freshman is probably the best description.

01:09:08.472 --> 01:09:25.104
She's a 19-year-old college freshman who's a journalism major who already thinks that she's essentially a journalist and talks like it and goes very off script with one person that was on the team already, Tulsi Gabbard, and it's just hilarious.

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:29.129
It's hilarious because she sounds like a child.

01:09:29.169 --> 01:09:31.951
Here she's reading a script and doing a lot of takes.

01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:35.373
And so one thing you'll notice is they got rid of the clock.

01:09:36.514 --> 01:09:37.995
They used to have a clock behind her.

01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:42.258
And the reason why they got rid of the clock is because it would always reveal that it wasn't one take.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:49.282
Sometimes the clock would go like this and then like this and then like this during a single month.

01:09:51.163 --> 01:09:52.164
To being on television.

01:09:53.188 --> 01:10:00.050
The answer is work, relentless nonstop training, particularly by his father.

01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:07.593
His father knew that the world would not change for his son and that his son would have to learn to adapt to the world.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:13.355
Wow, so Brian Hooker is just a shitty dad then because this guy's dad just trained him.

01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:19.855
I guess he was, you know, having projectile diarrhea and banging his head on the wall.

01:10:19.895 --> 01:10:22.997
And his dad said, no, no, don't do that.

01:10:23.337 --> 01:10:24.258
Poop in the toilet.

01:10:24.858 --> 01:10:25.979
Stop banging your head.

01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:29.561
And he just did it day after day until the kids stopped.

01:10:29.581 --> 01:10:34.845
And then he said, talk, speak, read this, write this word down.

01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:47.213
Born Lucky is a profoundly moving memoir about how Leland, and most notably his father, worked to beat his autism.

01:10:48.154 --> 01:10:50.337
You'll have to read it to understand how they did it.

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:54.192
Leland was diagnosed about 40 years ago.

01:10:54.973 --> 01:11:01.018
Since then the conversation around autism has shifted dramatically and so has the rate.

01:11:01.399 --> 01:11:14.410
I too am losing my mind with this stupid music behind it and her cadence of reading the I assume iPad reflected teleprompter in front of her is just

01:11:15.151 --> 01:11:18.314
It is so high school junior level shit here.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.195
It's sad.

01:11:19.435 --> 01:11:20.256
A diagnosis.

01:11:20.816 --> 01:11:25.681
In the 1980s, about 1 in 1,000 American children were diagnosed with autism.

01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:28.983
Today, it's 1 in 31.

01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:30.165
Why?

01:11:30.645 --> 01:11:32.126
Are more people being diagnosed?

01:11:32.587 --> 01:11:33.327
Is it genetics?

01:11:33.908 --> 01:11:34.769
Is it pollution?

01:11:35.289 --> 01:11:37.231
Is it that people are having children later?

01:11:37.691 --> 01:11:39.032
Or is it something else entirely?

01:11:40.014 --> 01:11:51.027
The question about what causes autism and how we treat it has become so politicized, though, that the conversation has left people resentful, anxious, confused, or scared.

01:11:51.548 --> 01:11:56.173
And most critically, for parents of children suffering with autism, without answers.

01:11:57.054 --> 01:12:21.429
born lucky is landing at an especially interesting moment given that the trump administration has just put the topic of autism at center stage last week trump held a controversial press conference where he drew a link between the active ingredient in tylenol and autism telling mothers not to take it and to tough it out that can you imagine a scenario where

01:12:22.455 --> 01:12:31.309
The autism that is more prevalent supposedly in young boys has to do with the circumcision of boys in American hospitals.

01:12:32.991 --> 01:12:35.455
Can you just imagine that as a possibility?

01:12:35.495 --> 01:12:37.118
Because it isn't ridiculous.

01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:45.423
There's a lot of possibilities that none of these people seem to be able to consider because they're scripted.

01:12:45.824 --> 01:12:55.712
Because it takes a lot of work and scholarship to be a biologist with the sophistication necessary to see through the script that these people are on.

01:12:55.752 --> 01:12:57.674
And that's what keeps them on the script.

01:12:59.735 --> 01:13:03.679
If they knew enough to see through the script, then they wouldn't be on it.

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:09.620
or they would be really, really bad people and very easy to break and you would be able to see.

01:13:10.241 --> 01:13:14.085
The enthusiasm here is what belies her mental state.

01:13:14.165 --> 01:13:15.566
She doesn't understand.

01:13:15.666 --> 01:13:18.349
She assumes that she's been scripted correctly.

01:13:18.849 --> 01:13:21.232
She assumes that her connections are better than most.

01:13:21.712 --> 01:13:26.097
She assumes that what's happening is really good because she has her own university and shit.

01:13:28.159 --> 01:13:29.040
It's gotta be right.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.710
Not that dissimilar to say how Charlie Kirk thought.

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.411
He must be right because he's getting all of that money.

01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:37.412
He's having all of that success.

01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:39.172
There's all this momentum.

01:13:39.453 --> 01:13:40.873
He has all these employees.

01:13:41.273 --> 01:13:44.594
He has built an organization worth 150 million dollars.

01:13:45.015 --> 01:13:48.636
He probably assumes that something is doing, working very well.

01:13:53.766 --> 01:13:59.111
You know, maybe even Elon Musk, to a certain extent, thinks that he's responsible for some of his own success.

01:13:59.231 --> 01:13:59.651
I don't know.

01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:00.992
I kind of doubt that.

01:14:01.072 --> 01:14:07.398
But anyway, back to Barry the Child Weiss here.

01:14:07.418 --> 01:14:16.425
That is among the many, many things that Leland and I talk about in this wide-ranging, fascinating, and emotional conversation.

01:14:17.146 --> 01:14:17.927
You won't want to miss it.

01:14:18.267 --> 01:14:18.707
Stay with us.

01:14:30.316 --> 01:14:36.320
it's not always raining on september 26th more than a forger there are movies and then there are movies

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:45.762
There are movies, and then there are movies that stay with you for a really long time.

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:53.710
Films that serve as a powerful reminder of what real courage looks like, especially at a time when integrity feels like it's in short supply.

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:54.851
Bao!

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:57.674
Artist at War is a film that does just that.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.517
It's a film that showcases real heroes.

01:15:01.238 --> 01:15:06.665
Bao is the true story of a man named Joseph Bao, who was a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.

01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:10.310
He risked his life forging documents to help also sign up.

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:11.592
Subscriber and now I have.

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:13.134
Let me spell it for you.

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:15.637
It's BAUmovie.com.

01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:18.800
I mean, what is this voice, right?

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.001
This is all bullshit.

01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:25.545
It's like the same thing that the Weinstein, Heather Haying does.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:26.706
It's all just silly.

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:29.348
They all want to be Annie Jacobson, but they're not.

01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:30.889
Eileen Bitter, welcome to Honestly.

01:15:31.409 --> 01:15:33.451
Long-time listener, first-time caller.

01:15:33.691 --> 01:15:35.072
Common Sense OG subscriber.

01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:42.557
Common Sense OG subscriber, and now I have to follow the former head of the Mossad, whose nickname is Model, which, of course, there's no pressure.

01:15:43.097 --> 01:15:44.238
Look at this set.

01:15:44.758 --> 01:15:47.219
Look at the photography involved.

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:48.179
Look at the lighting.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.200
There are multiple cameras.

01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:58.144
It's either post editing or live direction, which either way requires multiple employees.

01:15:58.204 --> 01:16:03.947
There's no question that the amount of expense that's being put on every one of these is just a joke.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:05.807
It's a joke.

01:16:06.768 --> 01:16:09.049
There could be 50 employees behind this show.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.401
That's what we're dealing with here.

01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:26.727
Employees that work social media, employees that book and schedule, employees that script, employees that pick her outfits, employees that have designed this whole backdrop and are moving that on the airs thing to all these different places.

01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:31.549
I mean, that is just, that's really funny.

01:16:31.949 --> 01:16:34.791
She's probably not even old enough for that to even mean anything.

01:16:36.863 --> 01:16:38.865
model because of his good looks, which you also share.

01:16:39.585 --> 01:16:40.666
Maybe you're more humble than him.

01:16:41.126 --> 01:16:45.089
Well, Leland, your nickname growing up was Lucky.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:46.650
Maybe people still call you that.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:47.130
Everybody.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:48.671
Everybody who knew me when I was a kid.

01:16:48.711 --> 01:16:50.712
It's an amazing nickname.

01:16:50.732 --> 01:16:57.457
So if Brian Hooker would have had the right combination of puzzles and games and nutrition,

01:16:58.177 --> 01:17:04.807
Brian Hooker's son would potentially also be a newscaster, but unfortunately Brian didn't have that.

01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:12.719
So, you know, and, and for Polly Tommy, you know, her son was practically cured when he got some secretin injections and that was in a newspaper.

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.041
So you can check that yourself.

01:17:15.393 --> 01:17:29.558
Mary Holland's kid was very damaged, but you know, over time he's, after he's been in a home that she's provided with all of her donations, you know, after she's been, had a therapist for his whole life, he's a little better, I guess, or something like that.

01:17:29.618 --> 01:17:29.958
I don't know.

01:17:31.038 --> 01:17:33.539
It's not like they sit next to them with their kid, right?

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.001
Show you the progress or show you the evidence.

01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:40.682
That's not, we wouldn't want to exploit their children.

01:17:40.902 --> 01:17:42.302
We just should take their word for it.

01:17:42.342 --> 01:17:44.803
They say they have an autistic kid, so checkmate.

01:17:46.564 --> 01:17:47.344
Get back in line.

01:17:50.185 --> 01:17:53.507
This is how America is being governed.

01:17:53.567 --> 01:17:59.429
And now understand, just like my show is not for everybody, Barry Weiss is not for everybody either.

01:18:00.449 --> 01:18:03.550
She's just another cat herder and they have hundreds of them.

01:18:04.091 --> 01:18:07.672
And so if you see through her, it doesn't mean you've seen through all of them.

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:11.874
And that's their magic trick.

01:18:11.915 --> 01:18:15.445
They only need to get about 80% of the people with their cat herding crew.

01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:17.391
And they have, they have and more.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:31.688
of your book, which is called Born Lucky, A Dedicated Father, A Grateful Son, and My Journey with Autism, like could not be more perfectly timed to the news.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:35.811
Like you clearly are born under a lucky star or at least luck with timing.

01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:41.876
And that's because autism is sort of the story of- Because it couldn't have been scripted, no way.

01:18:42.978 --> 01:18:50.687
of the moment, thanks to the Trump administration and its FDA, which just announced that it's going to change the Tylenol.

01:18:50.787 --> 01:18:52.909
And she is looking down at the script.

01:18:52.949 --> 01:18:58.576
They're going to go question by question and point by point because that's how scripted podcasts work.

01:18:59.753 --> 01:19:01.474
This is not a scripted podcast.

01:19:01.614 --> 01:19:03.195
I actually turned the page.

01:19:03.335 --> 01:19:06.278
I have nothing written here, nothing written there.

01:19:06.738 --> 01:19:14.283
I know what's in my slides because I made them, but if any point in time I wanted to address something in the chat and go off for an hour, I could do it.

01:19:15.144 --> 01:19:16.305
I've never had a script.

01:19:16.325 --> 01:19:25.411
Do you know that I had more of a script on my bike than I had for any stream that I've ever done since I did JC on the bike?

01:19:25.451 --> 01:19:27.752
Because I had the titles

01:19:28.809 --> 01:19:40.142
of the figures written on my tube of my bike so that I would know the titles of the figures and could read them or recite them for the people while I was riding.

01:19:41.483 --> 01:19:42.604
So I had a cheat sheet.

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:44.670
I didn't have anything else.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.291
I had to remember everything I read.

01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:48.012
I had to remember what was in the figures.

01:19:48.512 --> 01:19:50.393
But that was usually enough.

01:19:50.433 --> 01:19:54.154
But that list for Journal Club, I don't have.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:56.675
I don't have anything like that when I do this.

01:19:57.135 --> 01:19:57.996
Because what this is,

01:19:59.116 --> 01:20:00.398
is the culmination.

01:20:00.418 --> 01:20:08.986
It's like a daily oral exam on the culmination of everything that I've read over the last six years and the decades before it.

01:20:09.026 --> 01:20:17.135
And I can remember some of it and I can't remember other parts of it, but you're just seeing a live demonstration of how much I've learned.

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:21.599
And you don't see that with any of these other people.

01:20:21.679 --> 01:20:23.220
Jessica Rose can't do that.

01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.801
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:25.442
can't do that.

01:20:25.482 --> 01:20:26.823
Mary Holland can't do that.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:28.764
And Pauly Tommy can't do that.

01:20:28.784 --> 01:20:40.613
And in fact, if they did that, what they'd have to show you is that they have the same shtick that they had in 2015 with a little COVID, you know, COVID flavor added to it.

01:20:43.215 --> 01:20:44.236
This is a fraud.

01:20:45.402 --> 01:20:52.306
That man over there is a scripted fraud and he is very, very happy to be a part of the ruling elite to do it.

01:20:53.127 --> 01:20:59.011
Not that dissimilar to how Peter Hotez is very happy to be part of the ruling elite to do it.

01:21:00.237 --> 01:21:07.140
safety label to say that it may cause autism and ADHD in children whose mothers take it while pregnant.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:14.303
This is what Donald Trump said to expectant mothers in the White House in a conference about this new change.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.384
Don't take Tylenol, he said.

01:21:16.604 --> 01:21:17.284
Don't take it.

01:21:17.844 --> 01:21:19.685
Fight like hell not to take it.

01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:30.892
Paul Offit, a famous doctor and head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, called it arguably the most irresponsible public health press conference.

01:21:30.912 --> 01:21:38.537
So you see, right, he promoted Paul Offit opposite Jay Bhattacharya on his podcast.

01:21:38.637 --> 01:21:46.923
Now he's on her podcast with a very non-overlapping audience promoting the exact same, you know,

01:21:47.915 --> 01:21:51.797
bifurcated narrative with the same two Muppets yelling at each other.

01:21:51.817 --> 01:22:01.202
It is absolutely crystal clear that we are watching a Lollapalooza of liars that goes on each other's podcasts.

01:22:01.642 --> 01:22:06.644
And by the end of this show, it's going to be so crystal clear that you're going to need sunglasses.

01:22:06.845 --> 01:22:07.525
It's so bright.

01:22:09.835 --> 01:22:09.975
it's

01:22:30.715 --> 01:22:41.001
What I think is important in this, and thank you for asking, I think you highlighted the most important part, which is that autism is now part of the conversation.

01:22:42.282 --> 01:22:43.022
And that's missing.

01:22:43.102 --> 01:22:50.447
So now on TikTok, you have pregnant women downing bottles of Tylenol to own President Trump.

01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:54.574
which I think sort of shows you where we are in the conversation.

01:22:54.614 --> 01:22:56.436
That's what social media tells him.

01:22:56.456 --> 01:22:59.819
I don't know if that's really true or not, but that's what they say.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:06.846
So many people would rather ridicule the search for a cause rather than have an honest conversation.

01:23:07.687 --> 01:23:13.072
Had Jay Bhattacharya on the show on News Nation, inspired by your podcast with him.

01:23:14.133 --> 01:23:14.834
And he said,

01:23:16.918 --> 01:23:23.080
And so then, of course, you see that she had Jay Bhattacharya on a few months ago.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.962
And so he says that I had him on because he was on your podcast.

01:23:27.342 --> 01:23:30.483
And so then really it is a LARPer circle jerk world tour.

01:23:30.543 --> 01:23:31.344
That's all it is.

01:23:31.444 --> 01:23:42.868
It's a Hualapalooza of liars where, you know, Joe Satriani can join Eric Clapton on stage because the stages are on the same show.

01:23:44.301 --> 01:23:55.827
And later on, if you are on Joe Satriani's stage, and then, you know, I don't know, who would come on from, somebody from Guns N' Roses, you know, like, what is that guy's name?

01:23:56.307 --> 01:23:57.648
The dude with the hair and the hat.

01:23:57.988 --> 01:24:00.769
He could come on and play with Joe Satriani too.

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:03.771
And so, you know, one crossover could be great.

01:24:03.811 --> 01:24:05.772
The other crossover could be kind of weird.

01:24:06.132 --> 01:24:10.154
And so that just happens on all these podcasts, all these podcasters.

01:24:10.954 --> 01:24:30.505
And when you see that some of these people that are supposedly on polar opposite sides of the limited spectrum of debate, that is this fake, you know, sphere of death where these motorcycle riders are riding around like this and arguing about shit, they are on opposite sides of it.

01:24:30.545 --> 01:24:34.768
But at one point in time in the narrative, a lot of these people did podcasts together.

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:39.971
And once you see that, it's over.

01:24:43.408 --> 01:24:48.835
So long, you weren't allowed to ask the question, why are autism rates growing?

01:24:49.656 --> 01:24:50.717
And he said, I don't know.

01:24:50.737 --> 01:24:52.559
I can't tell you as a physician.

01:24:52.959 --> 01:25:02.391
You have something that went from 1 in 1,000 when I was diagnosed with what we now know to be autism, now 1 in 36, 1 in 12 for boys, higher than that for poor and minority communities.

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:17.666
See, he said it there again, when I was diagnosed with what we now know as autism, he is being extremely meticulous with his language because he wants you to know that at the time he wasn't diagnosed with autism.

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:19.647
He just wasn't.

01:25:23.803 --> 01:25:24.843
You can live with HIV.

01:25:25.403 --> 01:25:28.564
Most cancers have been cured or to the point now that they won't kill you.

01:25:29.064 --> 01:25:37.286
We can create bionic people with fake joints, heart disease, diabetes, all of these things we've made huge advances in in 40 years.

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:38.707
In autism, we have not.

01:25:39.307 --> 01:25:40.127
It's a medical mystery.

01:25:40.987 --> 01:25:43.648
It is a mystery, but because of

01:25:44.767 --> 01:25:53.191
whatever you want to call the surrounding aura around it, people have been unwilling to ask the scientific questions in an honest way.

01:25:53.271 --> 01:26:00.914
Well, let's talk about the surrounding aura, because there's lots of different culprits, I think you could say, in creating that aura, or maybe it's a fog.

01:26:01.514 --> 01:26:19.831
On the one hand, we ran this incredible piece by a woman called Jill Escher, a mom of two children with profound autism, nonverbal children, mostly, who speaks about sort of the rise of this neurodiversity pride movement, the idea that we should just accept

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:33.016
autism and in fact it's something you know like like anything else to like gay pride to be to be proud of and she says that that has sort of stymied honest curious research into a cause.

01:26:33.516 --> 01:26:43.141
Other people say that the fog has been created by people that are so concerned that looking into

01:26:43.661 --> 01:26:48.745
So all the ways that we're going to discuss it, it could never be the national security state creating the fog.

01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:50.246
You see the problem there?

01:26:50.786 --> 01:26:53.908
Never is it the national security state that's creating the fog.

01:26:53.948 --> 01:27:05.957
It's always, always, always people on the street that are out of the control of the national security state, working on their own, pushing misinformation, making lots of money, telling lies.

01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:23.353
And that's the absurdity and they all stick to that narrative that it's just kind of random lemming phenomenon that the government could never possibly have instigated, controlled, even orchestrated and murdered people to make sure that they did.

01:27:24.366 --> 01:27:25.506
Could never be that.

01:27:26.047 --> 01:27:31.709
It's just a bunch of people that our government can't get a handle on because misinformation is so darn enticing.

01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:35.370
Conspiracy theories are so fun.

01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:37.551
Right, Joe Rogan and Ian Carroll?

01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:46.314
Any connection between autism and vaccines will lead people to not get their children vaccinated for critical diseases like measles and polio.

01:27:46.774 --> 01:27:48.895
Still other people point to pollution.

01:27:48.935 --> 01:27:52.076
Like, what is your sense when you look at the big pie?

01:27:52.896 --> 01:28:00.618
of who is most to blame, if we can say that, for a lack of an answer to what has caused this unbelievable rise.

01:28:02.392 --> 01:28:04.033
I'm not smart enough to answer that question.

01:28:04.693 --> 01:28:06.834
I think the answer is yes and, right?

01:28:06.874 --> 01:28:09.295
It is all of these factors coming together.

01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:23.120
I think the neurodiversity pride movement, if you wanted to call it that, and look, there was a little bit of that in my story too, that people told my dad, look, you know, it's kind of who he is, let's meet him where he's at.

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:29.483
Uh-uh, that was not how I was grown up in any way, shape or form.

01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:39.629
I think it's a yes and issue that there are all of these contributing factors to not answering and not honestly investigating.

01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:41.611
And Bhattacharya was very open about it.

01:28:41.631 --> 01:28:49.598
He said, look, there is a lot of resistance within the scientific community to researching this issue and to coming up with an honest answer to it.

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:52.181
He said, do I think it's vaccines?

01:28:52.201 --> 01:28:53.802
No, but I don't know.

01:28:54.483 --> 01:28:57.646
And that to me is the real sort of

01:28:58.934 --> 01:28:59.695
awful part of this.

01:28:59.735 --> 01:29:15.952
And I say that because how are we letting politics or the sacredness of vaccines or this wacky, let's celebrate everyone who they are, no matter what struggles they might have, are now meaning there's going to be a lot more kids

01:29:16.773 --> 01:29:19.536
who had the hell that I did growing up.

01:29:19.856 --> 01:29:28.584
And they may not have a father who could quit his job and who could become a full-time parent coach and who could devote himself to me in the way my dad did.

01:29:28.644 --> 01:29:30.886
So why wouldn't we try to help those kids?

01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:34.111
You wrote this piece in the Wall Street Journal.

01:29:34.191 --> 01:29:36.813
The title was I'm Autistic and RFK Jr.

01:29:36.873 --> 01:29:38.534
Is Right to Hunt for Root Causes.

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:39.294
This is what you wrote.

01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:42.897
There's been a tremendous increase in autism diagnoses.

01:29:42.937 --> 01:29:43.957
You put out those numbers.

01:29:44.137 --> 01:29:46.839
We have been baited by these people, ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:46.859 --> 01:29:49.401
Do not let yourself be ruled by podcasts.

01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:51.342
You just got to stop following these people.

01:29:51.382 --> 01:29:52.943
They're all scripted actors.

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:57.065
They were all put in place and they all trust the script.

01:29:57.886 --> 01:29:58.586
Thanks for being here.

01:29:58.606 --> 01:29:59.407
I'll see you in a few minutes.

01:30:33.513 --> 01:30:33.793
Yeah.

01:31:32.603 --> 01:31:34.625
if I need to.

01:31:35.026 --> 01:31:41.732
It's so funny when things ain't feeling right, that it's time to proceed through.

01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:45.556
Pretty soon the love won't wash away.

01:31:45.576 --> 01:31:49.820
Rain or shine, it's always still this day.

01:31:50.841 --> 01:31:55.186
All these years you and I spent together, I guess we

01:32:14.923 --> 01:32:32.174
♪ We're trying to stop the devastation ♪ ♪ We're all doing trials and tribulations ♪ ♪ Feeling the burden, the tires of his years ♪ ♪ And giggling, yelling, cries of his tears ♪ ♪ Can you calm before we go?

01:32:32.194 --> 01:32:43.422
♪ ♪ I want to see you before we're too old ♪ ♪ Don't just treat me for trying to behave ♪ ♪ I understand

01:33:22.856 --> 01:33:23.866
Yeah!

01:34:49.071 --> 01:34:53.834
I have a giant bowl of food here, way too much before the very tasty.

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.770
Thank you very much for coming for the second half of the show.

01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:00.891
That was Stevie Ray Vaughan, in case you don't know.

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:02.031
Couldn't stand the weather.

01:35:03.292 --> 01:35:04.772
I like to visit the timeline.

01:35:04.792 --> 01:35:06.113
I'm all about the timeline.

01:35:06.173 --> 01:35:11.815
I showed you yesterday this video from 2021 where this clown is telling- That's all right.

01:35:12.115 --> 01:35:12.695
That's all right.

01:35:12.715 --> 01:35:13.856
What he did during the pandemic.

01:35:13.876 --> 01:35:15.296
The students need educators, you know?

01:35:15.396 --> 01:35:16.017
Exactly.

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:16.417
Yeah.

01:35:16.737 --> 01:35:17.777
So how have you been?

01:35:17.797 --> 01:35:20.718
I mean, this pandemic has been hard for everybody, some more than others.

01:35:21.178 --> 01:35:23.339
How has it been for you and the kids?

01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:24.580
Yeah, no, we all-

01:35:26.742 --> 01:35:41.629
You know, for me personally, from its onset, I approached it how I approach every other day, and that's that I just led with common sense and common courtesy.

01:35:42.209 --> 01:35:43.830
So when they told me to stay home, I stayed home.

01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:46.091
When they told me to wear a mask, I wore a mask.

01:35:46.591 --> 01:35:48.012
When they said I could do this, I did that.

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:54.394
So I thought I'd stick with the 2021 theme, go back to February of 2021,

01:35:56.038 --> 01:36:05.126
to a video, that says I gotta go to the gym, to a video that Mark Kulak of Housatonic ITS sent to me and I just think it's hilarious.

01:36:05.146 --> 01:36:13.433
So I'm just gonna let it play for a few minutes and maybe we'll revisit it tomorrow as part of the, shoot, I didn't have that in the right.

01:36:13.833 --> 01:36:14.614
Anyway, it's okay.

01:36:15.455 --> 01:36:16.476
Sorry for the audio there.

01:36:19.918 --> 01:36:24.042
I'm Dave Rubin and it's Friday, so we've got another big panel show for you guys.

01:36:24.142 --> 01:36:29.688
Today we'll be focusing on big tech censorship, specifically in the medical and legal worlds.

01:36:29.808 --> 01:36:37.175
And joining me today is addiction medicine specialist and host of the Dr. Drew podcast, the one and only Dr. Drew.

01:36:37.956 --> 01:36:48.747
Stanford-trained internist and host of the ZDoggMD show, Dr. Zubin Damania, and commercial litigation lawyer turned YouTuber, we're all YouTubers now, Viva Frye.

01:36:49.147 --> 01:36:49.968
Welcome to the show, guys.

01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:51.950
Thank you very much.

01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:52.570
Thank you.

01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:59.397
So, I'm looking forward to this because I think we're going to touch on pretty much everything that everybody's talking about.

01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:31.482
So wait, this guy who's in the original picture with Rogan and Peterson and Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro and him and the Weinsteins, that guy is now having these three people, Dr. Drew, associated with the network that I'm associated with through Adam Carolla and Broken Science, and they're long working with him, this guy,

01:37:32.022 --> 01:37:49.171
who's done several podcasts with both the FTA guy and also the Paul Offit guy, and then that guy, who, after he was famous at the Canadian trucker finanza, bonanza, decided to move to Florida and become a full-time podcaster with the Barnes dude.

01:37:50.856 --> 01:37:58.743
I actually have a text message from that guy over there that was gonna interview at me at one point in 2024 and then he vanished and it's still on my phone.

01:37:59.404 --> 01:38:10.674
I got his name from a guy by the name of Chet Chisholm in Canada, some EMT that said that he wanted to interview me and then it never happened, but it's on my phone.

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:19.417
It's bizarro world because in February of 2021, these people had a conversation.

01:38:19.437 --> 01:38:21.879
This is Paul Offit's buddy.

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:32.771
basically at every level of society these days related to lockdowns and censorship and free speech and everything else.

01:38:33.071 --> 01:38:38.134
You guys have all dealt with some level of censorship yourselves in the last couple of weeks.

01:38:38.875 --> 01:38:40.016
Drew, I'll start with you.

01:38:41.156 --> 01:38:43.878
Is your YouTube channel still demonetized?

01:38:43.938 --> 01:38:53.264
I know you were demonetized for a while, which people think is just about money, but actually when you get demonetized, that hurts you in the algorithm and then you get less views and everything else.

01:38:53.304 --> 01:38:54.225
Where are you at with that?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.940
ZDogg's nodding along.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.461
Oh yeah, that's also what happens.

01:38:58.521 --> 01:38:59.781
It's not just about money.

01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:01.981
You also get knocked down in the algorithm.

01:39:02.382 --> 01:39:05.522
Because the algorithm is completely out of our control.

01:39:05.902 --> 01:39:06.682
Stop lying!

01:39:07.403 --> 01:39:08.823
Stop lying!

01:39:09.663 --> 01:39:11.123
Gosh, this is so dumb.

01:39:11.163 --> 01:39:18.265
I mean, when you see it in retrospect, it is so ridiculous to think that this is four independent men.

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.705
It's hilarious!

01:39:21.426 --> 01:39:23.146
This is a virtual view!

01:39:24.056 --> 01:39:24.957
and why did it happen?

01:39:25.618 --> 01:39:27.920
I was in some sort of one week deplatforming.

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:34.225
I was actually and threatening with permanent deplatforming for absolutely reasons I cannot determine.

01:39:34.626 --> 01:39:42.553
I was sent a list of policies that are not to be violated and they were nowhere near anything I was talking about.

01:39:42.973 --> 01:39:50.540
The only thing that came close that I could imagine is I had COVID and I was discussing the status as measured of my immunity

01:39:51.098 --> 01:39:55.141
and somehow discussing immunity is touchy for them.

01:39:55.561 --> 01:40:06.430
I was talking to an anesthesiologist who's doing research on long haulers and we were just discussing the controversies of the kinds of issues that can, kinds of treatments can be used to deal with cytokine activation.

01:40:09.532 --> 01:40:11.954
There he meant long haulers like long COVID.

01:40:12.014 --> 01:40:19.820
So in February of 2021, they're reinforcing the narrative of long COVID, reinforcing the narrative that there is a novel virus because he had it.

01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:21.910
right, Dr. Drew?

01:40:21.930 --> 01:40:27.573
Deal with active viral illness, deal with brain inflammation, things like fluvoxamine, that's all we were talking about.

01:40:27.953 --> 01:40:32.575
Then we get a notification that we're deplat, we're in the doghouse for a week, and I still don't know why.

01:40:33.055 --> 01:40:34.816
Right, so you're in the doghouse for a week.

01:40:34.976 --> 01:40:42.899
I guess the strike, from what I understand, the strike, I guess, has been taken away, but you know, once that thing kicks in once, you're that much closer to being gone altogether.

01:40:42.919 --> 01:40:43.840
That's right.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:44.900
Zubin, you had problems.

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.321
Let's put YouTube aside for a moment.

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.602
You had some problems with Facebook in the last couple of weeks, right?

01:40:49.898 --> 01:40:51.380
Yeah, and we're in all these platforms as well.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:59.849
And on Facebook, I suddenly got a message on the back end in my creator side that said, oh, this page is at risk for being de-published.

01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:06.757
Don't forget the free speech oligarch by the name of Dana White is on the board of Facebook.

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:13.940
You know, the guy who has the only sport in the world that allows their fighters to say whatever they want.

01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:15.903
There's free speech because he believes in it.

01:41:16.484 --> 01:41:17.986
Think about how comical it is.

01:41:18.167 --> 01:41:19.990
Think about how comical it is.

01:41:21.226 --> 01:41:23.929
because of violations of community standards.

01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:27.393
And I got no such notifications, had no clue.

01:41:27.573 --> 01:41:29.595
And when you click appeal, it's grayed out.

01:41:30.096 --> 01:41:31.598
So you have no recourse.

01:41:32.078 --> 01:41:36.423
And on top of that, the concern was- I'm suffering so much, they canceled me.

01:41:36.443 --> 01:41:40.367
The entire page, that's a 2.2 million person following thing that we've built over 10 years.

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.823
They were basically saying, oh, tomorrow it could be gone with no explanation.

01:41:45.024 --> 01:41:58.897
And that was a little frustrating because it had been led into with some of my videos that were sort of talking about the science of vaccines in a pro-vaccine way, being labeled as potential misinformation by independent fact checkers.

01:41:59.418 --> 01:42:00.779
So the whole thing was kind of a mess.

01:42:00.799 --> 01:42:01.860
This is the thing that kills me.

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.221
Independent fact checkers.

01:42:03.261 --> 01:42:03.642
Go ahead, Drew.

01:42:04.286 --> 01:42:12.291
I got to tell you, this is what exercises me and my son is a law student, got very worked up about this, that we are board certified in internal medicine.

01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:14.932
I have 35 years of practice in medicine.

01:42:14.992 --> 01:42:25.158
I'm having a conversation with a colleague and non-medical professionals are determining what is appropriate for a physician conversation in the public sphere, which is

01:42:25.811 --> 01:42:26.351
anathema.

01:42:26.431 --> 01:42:27.212
It's bizarre.

01:42:27.712 --> 01:42:31.074
And there's so many things wrong with that I can't even begin to talk about.

01:42:31.274 --> 01:42:32.155
Wait, Drew, are you telling?

01:42:32.575 --> 01:42:37.057
Maybe a better way to think about these people as sort of pace runners.

01:42:38.278 --> 01:42:46.643
And so the function that social media has is that you end up choosing one of these intellectual dimwits on a script and follow them.

01:42:48.075 --> 01:42:55.658
So even if you progress intellectually faster than them, you will nevertheless be hoping that they progress with you.

01:42:55.698 --> 01:42:59.679
And if they don't, you might find somebody else progressing at the pace that you're progressing at.

01:42:59.699 --> 01:43:09.723
But the bottom line is, is that you will be under a spell because you don't realize that what's happening in this four-person conversation is a setting and maintaining of a pace.

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:17.724
and a defining of this hamster wheel and an agreement about what all these people have gone through over the last few years.

01:43:17.764 --> 01:43:18.824
This is February of 2021.

01:43:20.245 --> 01:43:28.510
This isn't even when the majority of, oh yeah, the majority of the people will be killed the following year in the, in the winter of 2021.

01:43:31.513 --> 01:43:33.715
And so we're just getting started right here.

01:43:34.115 --> 01:43:39.920
And what the agreement is among these four people is that there was a novel virus.

01:43:40.441 --> 01:43:41.862
It's traveling around the world.

01:43:42.102 --> 01:43:46.646
There is long COVID and natural immunity to it matters.

01:43:46.706 --> 01:43:49.228
That's the only things that they can seem to agree on.

01:43:49.288 --> 01:43:50.409
And they all agree on that.

01:43:50.449 --> 01:43:56.094
And that's exactly the national security state narrative they're supposed to agree on.

01:43:57.533 --> 01:44:06.158
that anonymous non-expert people that work for giant big tech companies might have some sort of bias and should not be in charge of what medical professionals say?

01:44:06.679 --> 01:44:08.159
Right, just non-medical is the part.

01:44:08.179 --> 01:44:12.522
You're having non-medical personnel determining what a physician should say.

01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:18.585
But these aren't non-medical personnel that are also kind of having influence on, it's just crazy.

01:44:18.645 --> 01:44:20.987
We are in a big trap.

01:44:21.007 --> 01:44:22.948
Viva, on the legal side of this,

01:44:23.248 --> 01:44:26.652
Well, have you been outright censored just because of your legal positions?

01:44:26.692 --> 01:44:31.978
And then we'll dive into a little bit more on the legal side of what people like these two gentlemen can do.

01:44:33.024 --> 01:44:35.225
So I have not been, I have not gotten a strike.

01:44:35.505 --> 01:44:40.967
I've gotten a warning, which I thought tooth and nail to have removed, and it was more of a misunderstanding than anything else.

01:44:41.448 --> 01:44:45.910
But I did at one point when I broke down and explained the deposition of Alex Jones.

01:44:46.450 --> 01:44:55.894
That video, after a couple hundred thousand views, was suddenly demonetized and confirmed on appeal without any appeal being lodged on my side.

01:44:56.534 --> 01:45:02.121
Then subsequently, it was actually removed from the platform for violating the terms of service as relates to hate speech.

01:45:02.561 --> 01:45:11.552
And bear in mind, this was nothing more than an analysis of a deposition of Alex Jones in his defamation lawsuit, and I didn't even include any of the incendiary parts.

01:45:12.256 --> 01:45:14.016
So I thought that tooth and nail as well.

01:45:14.076 --> 01:45:22.738
And then magically one day it comes back on the platform fully monetized as though the search terms in the algorithm had been modified or tinkered with.

01:45:23.098 --> 01:45:27.039
And what was taboo two weeks ago is now green-lighted once again.

01:45:27.819 --> 01:45:29.379
And this happens vice versa all the time.

01:45:29.719 --> 01:45:29.899
Yeah.

01:45:30.039 --> 01:45:33.120
And just to be clear, you know, all of you guys have locals communities.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.420
You have other ways that you make money.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.361
He talked about Alex Jones and got censored.

01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:40.721
I mean,

01:45:43.939 --> 01:45:44.740
That's just dumb.

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.020
That is so dumb.

01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:47.521
That is just so dumb.

01:45:48.702 --> 01:45:52.424
You have subscriptions and all that, but the demonetization thing, I mean, people don't realize it.

01:45:52.444 --> 01:45:57.167
They think, oh, you're just complaining over some ad dollars that you get, but it really is not that.

01:45:57.667 --> 01:46:01.089
It hurts the video's ability to get out to other people.

01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:05.112
But it's interesting because you're talking about how basically non-legal experts

01:46:05.632 --> 01:46:08.634
are shutting you down for talking about a legal case.

01:46:09.074 --> 01:46:15.337
And what the two doctors here are saying are that in essence, non-medical experts have this kind of power.

01:46:15.737 --> 01:46:21.240
Drew, since you've been in the media game the longest out of us, like, does any of this surprise you?

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:27.644
I mean, you've had to deal with network sensors and all of that, but that this has now leaked into so much of new media as well.

01:46:28.413 --> 01:46:32.277
Yeah, this has gotten, well, I never expected anything like this.

01:46:33.198 --> 01:46:34.619
This is absolutely bizarre for me.

01:46:35.039 --> 01:46:40.885
And where it gets even more bizarre is how much it has, physicians, we are easily frightened, right?

01:46:41.285 --> 01:46:42.687
We're frightened of liability.

01:46:42.747 --> 01:46:46.290
We're frightened of our reputation being damaged in some way.

01:46:46.931 --> 01:46:53.497
And now I'm seeing doctors out in the world, not only afraid to talk about what we normally do, which is,

01:46:53.977 --> 01:47:03.925
discuss medicine, discuss controversies, discuss within the literature, discuss how we've improvised to try to help patients, will not discuss it and certainly will not try anything.

01:47:04.305 --> 01:47:06.007
And people are literally dying.

01:47:06.487 --> 01:47:10.290
Some of this, I think, is because medicine has become so corporatized.

01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.291
I really looked into this rather carefully.

01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:19.395
And so many physicians, particularly on the general medicine side and ER, are hired by large corporations or large hospital groups.

01:47:19.755 --> 01:47:25.399
And if they step out of any alignment with the specified clinical pathways, they are in danger.

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:26.499
So they just shut up.

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.541
You don't need doctors anymore.

01:47:28.861 --> 01:47:33.984
Why have doctors if we're not using our judgment and not sharing and growing and building medical knowledge?

01:47:34.164 --> 01:47:38.706
Are you telling me we're not all doctors just by signing on to WebMD and figuring out what's wrong with ourselves?

01:48:37.623 --> 01:48:40.365
In which there are no ethical boundaries.

01:48:42.298 --> 01:48:46.422
You can't conceive of warfare in which there's no guardrails.

01:48:47.784 --> 01:48:50.526
There's no consensus about the rules of engagement.

01:48:50.566 --> 01:48:52.188
But that's what we're in right now.

01:48:54.912 --> 01:48:57.194
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's where we are right now.

01:48:57.254 --> 01:48:58.335
There are no morals.

01:48:58.455 --> 01:49:00.017
They are just lying to you.

01:49:00.137 --> 01:49:18.193
And they do it because there was an expected rise in all-cause mortality that needed managing and also presented an opportunity for them to invert your sovereignty to experimental animal status under the pretense that the Human Genome Project is something more important than any one person or any one family.

01:49:19.212 --> 01:49:21.813
It's about taking control of the evolution of the species.

01:49:22.333 --> 01:49:27.594
And this is a once-in-a-lifetime, maybe a once-in-multiple-generations time and opportunity to do it.

01:49:28.274 --> 01:49:35.775
And so an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality sculpted using murder and lies, you know, a few thousand is not that hard.

01:49:36.255 --> 01:49:43.877
And it's not that big of a cost if we're talking about multi-generational control over the human species and the direction that it goes.

01:49:44.952 --> 01:49:46.514
And they think that that's what they're doing.

01:49:46.554 --> 01:49:48.076
They've thought that since the 50s.

01:49:48.116 --> 01:49:51.940
They expect it to be further by now, but it doesn't change their motivations.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.842
It doesn't change the narrative.

01:49:53.882 --> 01:49:59.629
And that's the reason why this false two-party theater is being run by the national security state.

01:49:59.669 --> 01:50:02.092
It's not two corporate parties.

01:50:02.312 --> 01:50:05.155
It is one national security theater.

01:50:05.896 --> 01:50:10.837
And anybody that rises into clear view is a scripted actor, because that's how social media works.

01:50:10.877 --> 01:50:15.598
It has become militarized, and we are being governed by podcast actors.

01:50:16.079 --> 01:50:25.701
That's the reality, and that's the reason why you need to teach this to your children, because podcast actors are being used to define almost everything that everybody argues about.

01:50:28.328 --> 01:50:31.409
We can get out though by just teaching our kids all of these myths.

01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:37.232
All of these nonsensical myths that we bought into because social media is that powerful.

01:50:37.292 --> 01:50:38.233
It's murder and lies.

01:50:38.273 --> 01:50:39.653
It's about the grandchildren of earth.

01:50:40.273 --> 01:50:42.174
Get your kids off of social media right now.

01:50:43.775 --> 01:50:44.636
Just do it.

01:50:44.736 --> 01:50:46.018
Get them off of social media.

01:50:46.058 --> 01:50:46.599
See you soon.

01:50:46.879 --> 01:50:47.540
I'll see you soon.

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.201
Probably tomorrow.

01:50:48.221 --> 01:50:50.364
RNA can't pandemic.

01:50:50.584 --> 01:50:51.045
It can't.

01:50:51.685 --> 01:50:55.450
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:50:56.351 --> 01:51:00.457
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

01:51:02.176 --> 01:51:02.676
actually J.J.

01:51:02.696 --> 01:51:09.341
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:51:09.681 --> 01:51:11.242
Thank you very much for being here, everybody.

01:51:11.282 --> 01:51:12.743
Good to see everybody in the chat.

01:51:12.803 --> 01:51:14.104
Vilma, good to see you.

01:51:14.224 --> 01:51:16.766
I'm sorry that you wasted money paying Viva.

01:51:17.246 --> 01:51:18.307
That's unfortunate.

01:51:19.027 --> 01:51:21.049
The wheel must be broken, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:22.370
The wheel must be broken.

01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:24.351
I hope to do a Saturday show.

01:51:24.371 --> 01:51:42.463
There's a possibility that we're going to do a Saturday morning show and my motivation for doing that would be primarily, and I know this is going to sound very very lame from the perspective of saving the world and saving our children from social media, but I have this idea that PeerTube

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:49.565
might be the greatest place to post old cartoons from my childhood.

01:51:50.085 --> 01:51:53.786
And so I have been busy for quite some time collecting those cartoons.

01:51:54.266 --> 01:51:58.787
I have the first three seasons of Scooby-Doo.

01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:04.589
I have all of the seasons of Dungeons and Dragons, which was one of my favorite cartoons on TV when I was a kid.

01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:20.520
I have a couple seasons of this dinosaur show that you just simply won't believe called Extreme Dinosaurs, which is probably a more intelligent and funny version of the Transformers with biology.

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.502
It is just so over the top.

01:52:24.082 --> 01:52:29.226
that I think actually extreme dinosaurs could be a thing that we just do on Saturday with coffee.

01:52:29.666 --> 01:52:33.329
And I just have an episode where we do that and kind of just relax and laugh.

01:52:33.949 --> 01:52:35.130
Anyway, thanks for being here.

01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:36.151
I hope you had a good week.

01:52:36.711 --> 01:52:38.012
Rocktober continues.

01:52:38.092 --> 01:52:39.133
I'll see you again soon.
