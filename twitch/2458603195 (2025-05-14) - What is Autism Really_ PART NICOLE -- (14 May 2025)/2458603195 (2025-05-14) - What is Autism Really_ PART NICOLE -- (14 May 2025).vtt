WEBVTT

00:24.198 --> 00:26.779
That is a pretty great work of art.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.120
I don't know who made that, one of your followers there, Kevin?

00:29.540 --> 00:34.822
I think so, but whoever did it, that's I-8-U-P-S-Y.

00:37.363 --> 00:42.145
That coronavirus is getting sliced in half by a samurai who's wearing a mask.

00:44.156 --> 00:44.696
That's great.

00:46.097 --> 00:46.858
Yeah, it's really good.

00:48.279 --> 00:53.762
If we can get that sort of larger on the, well, I mean, probably the way I'm looking at it is small.

00:54.703 --> 00:55.323
Okay, yeah.

00:55.683 --> 00:58.405
Yeah, I think it's smaller on your broadcast.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.065
Let me see.

00:59.145 --> 01:00.366
Oh, yeah, I'm on yours now.

01:01.427 --> 01:03.828
Oh, you got the EcoHealth Alliance pulled up too there.

01:03.848 --> 01:04.669
Yeah, yeah.

01:04.729 --> 01:09.632
Because I'm telling you people, nail these people, nail this NPO.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.005
I don't care how you get there.

01:15.025 --> 01:17.729
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:17.749 --> 01:20.292
The goal is to win.

01:39.580 --> 02:05.202

04:17.895 --> 04:18.496
so so

04:48.920 --> 05:06.979
what is it do you want to do when you grow up is uh this is not the answer that i had given when i was a kid my name is jonathan cooey i'm coming to you live out of pittsburgh pennsylvania and uh i'm the chief biologist of giga ohm biological i put out a news program five days a week

05:08.221 --> 05:10.062
I helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

05:10.102 --> 05:19.631
write the Wuhan cover-up book, and after that I was hired by Children's Health Defense and later fired by their CEO, Mary Holland, who I believe is a traitor to America's children.

05:20.052 --> 05:28.260
I'm also good friends with Jay Bhattacharyya, although since he got a job in the Trump administration he hasn't given me a call, but I trust that's just because he's very busy.

05:29.460 --> 05:49.065
I am also misrepresented on a substat called Woodhouse 76 which is really the brainchild of Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and a woman in America by the name of Jessica Hockett who recycle my ideas there to argue with people like Claire Craig or Pierre Cory or even Mike Eden and Jay Bhattacharya.

05:50.045 --> 06:03.977
I assure you this is all just an elaborate hoax that is kind of a little bit of heart and a little bit of panda and a little bit of CHD and a little bit of no virus, all designed to make sure that no one ever escapes.

06:05.038 --> 06:06.419
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

06:06.439 --> 06:09.281
This is GigaOM Biological, where RNA cannot pandemic.

06:09.321 --> 06:11.583
Intramuscular injections are not medicine.

06:12.084 --> 06:15.446
Transfection was always a crime in the population pyramids.

06:16.207 --> 06:19.809
are a real problem that needs manning and managing.

06:21.570 --> 06:29.033
The other day I gave you a brief look into... Is this working?

06:29.634 --> 06:30.554
Yes, it is.

06:30.574 --> 06:32.555
I don't like that though.

06:33.215 --> 06:35.837
I'm gonna get rid of that and I'm gonna come over here.

06:38.339 --> 06:39.239
Good morning, everybody.

06:39.319 --> 06:40.160
Welcome to the show.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.960
This is GigaOM Biological again.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.180
My name's Jonathan Cooey.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.702
I am indeed very happy to be here.

06:47.462 --> 06:49.642
Still trying to make sure everything is in focus.

06:51.123 --> 07:02.806
If you want to be notified of the stream, there is a email on the screen there that you can email and my wife will send you a little note saying that I am gonna stream.

07:03.367 --> 07:04.087
However,

07:06.548 --> 07:16.911
The idea that it's gonna be on time or there's gonna be some kind of schedule, I aim for some kind of 1010 and I always get around 12 o'clock.

07:17.011 --> 07:22.852
So I just pull the trigger when I can to make sure that I have a good two hours to get it done.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.533
And so here I am again today.

07:25.873 --> 07:32.075
If you need to send anything to the house, like a card or a self-addressed stamped envelope,

07:33.942 --> 07:40.869
in which I can put a few stickers for you or even a Velcro backed patch if that's your kind of thing.

07:41.669 --> 07:52.980
And if you want to share the work that I'm doing, please share it at stream.gigohm.bio because then I get a kind of an idea of who's seeing it and who's not because not that I can see who's seeing it, but the numbers are real there.

07:53.020 --> 07:54.021
I don't know what's happening on

07:54.844 --> 07:56.885
on Rumble, and I don't know what happens on YouTube.

07:56.905 --> 07:59.407
I don't know what happens anywhere but PeerTube.

08:00.808 --> 08:02.789
Anyway, thank you very much for being here.

08:04.510 --> 08:13.016
A day or two ago, maybe it was even yesterday, I brought up the character of Nicole Shanahan, who is some kind of rich person.

08:13.036 --> 08:14.997
I'm not exactly sure how rich she is.

08:15.057 --> 08:18.880
She's a techno person and a technology person and a

08:19.680 --> 08:20.921
and a whole thing.

08:21.561 --> 08:22.502
I don't know what she is.

08:22.522 --> 08:36.712
And ever since her sort of surprising rise to prominence as the vice presidential candidate running with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she's now taken a position as a prominent podcaster on YouTube.

08:37.512 --> 08:48.577
and in the populist conservative right in America and is interviewing people and apparently part of this new media movement with a lot of, you know, big ideas.

08:48.637 --> 08:52.579
And so I think I've made the point before.

08:52.919 --> 08:53.719
Did that stop?

08:53.939 --> 08:54.619
That sucks.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.000
Sorry about that.

08:56.060 --> 09:00.622
There's supposed to be some kind of super cool, like, did I not set that right?

09:03.023 --> 09:04.464
What is going on?

09:04.684 --> 09:05.304
Playback.

09:06.186 --> 09:07.188
Oh, I didn't loop it.

09:07.288 --> 09:08.450
See, that's the problem.

09:08.490 --> 09:08.971
There we go.

09:08.991 --> 09:14.221
It was supposed to look like some cool spaceship bedroom or something like that there, and then it didn't move.

09:15.426 --> 09:16.107
What was I saying?

09:16.147 --> 09:26.692
Yes, Nicole Shanahan is somebody that I find very curious and I have suggested that there is a lot of work to be done that anybody can do.

09:28.033 --> 09:34.817
I don't know if you can notice or not, but I actually took the Indian over here and I gave him a ponytail.

09:35.397 --> 09:36.778
Maybe I should just get rid of the

09:37.458 --> 09:42.139
the background or make the background white or something like that video format.

09:42.199 --> 09:44.020
Can I make it brighter like this?

09:44.260 --> 09:45.580
There, see now you can see it.

09:46.681 --> 09:47.221
Does that work?

09:47.261 --> 09:48.221
Yeah, see now you see.

09:48.701 --> 09:58.264
I took the racist part of the Indian that nobody wants, I took that racist part off and I put a

09:59.679 --> 10:01.760
I put a ponytail on it and so now it's me.

10:02.460 --> 10:06.162
And later today, I'm gonna make it black and brown instead of blue and red.

10:06.202 --> 10:11.985
And then we'll basically have a new logo for JC on the hardwood, which is really fun.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.685
I'm very excited about that.

10:14.766 --> 10:26.091
So again, getting off the subject, I have been advocating for anyone and everyone to start building a timeline

10:27.130 --> 10:37.276
to archive what your quote-unquote heroes did before the pandemic as a career and at the start of the pandemic.

10:37.316 --> 10:38.257
What did they say?

10:38.397 --> 10:39.318
Where were they?

10:40.438 --> 10:44.281
And more importantly, during the pandemic, who did they interact with?

10:44.401 --> 10:45.121
Who were they?

10:45.782 --> 10:47.963
What groups were they a part of?

10:49.144 --> 10:51.425
What people did they share the stage with?

10:52.646 --> 10:55.928
And I've made the argument that if you do this diligently,

10:57.225 --> 10:59.607
most of these people can be seen for who they are.

11:01.829 --> 11:17.201
Now, I don't know if reverb helps there, but I think this strategy at this stage in the game, with the cards that these people are laying down, it is now obvious that it's been rigged the whole time.

11:17.921 --> 11:22.125
And so if you can see it that way, where after hours and hours of poker,

11:23.300 --> 11:29.166
All these people with these big chips are now suddenly getting like full houses and four of a kind.

11:30.807 --> 11:33.950
And you're experiencing bad beat after bad beat.

11:34.031 --> 11:36.993
And it's like, okay, a couple of times I can handle it, but not anymore.

11:37.094 --> 11:39.656
And this is where you can see it.

11:39.716 --> 11:45.422
When somebody like Nicole Shanahan is complaining about people being Manchurian candidates.

11:49.813 --> 11:52.614
because of course she kind of fell out of the sky, right?

11:52.674 --> 11:54.734
She was, who the hell is this?

11:55.815 --> 12:02.717
When people were speculating about who Bobby might choose as vice president, I don't think anybody thought it was going to be Nicole Shanahan.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.878
And that's a pretty remarkable realization.

12:10.179 --> 12:18.341
And if you see it that way, that almost kind of positioning himself to join the potential winning side,

12:20.137 --> 12:25.181
almost like it was always, I mean, what about Manchurian candidates?

12:25.261 --> 12:36.490
And so I thought we should go back to what I believe is before the election or right, right, right, right afterward, before Trump was sworn in.

12:36.570 --> 12:41.334
So maybe in this time after the election was decided, but then still before Trump was sworn in.

12:42.174 --> 13:08.904
and and watch a couple interviews segments with Nicole on the the Steve Bannon war room because I again I think this is the way I mean this this is where the these people's narratives are being synchronized with the political narratives that Steve Bannon is is working on with other outlets and so the biology

13:09.904 --> 13:17.930
it needs to be filtered through McKernan or through Robert Malone, and maybe through Mary Holland or Brian Hooker.

13:18.010 --> 13:24.975
But in reality, what you see here overarchingly is a political stunt.

13:25.115 --> 13:36.223
It is a political stunt that is loosely based on the political stunt that Polly, Tommy, and Andrew Wakefield pulled off in the UK in the early, late 90s, early 2000s.

13:36.243 --> 13:38.465
You have to do your own research on that because, you know,

13:39.045 --> 13:42.313
That's part of being a grown-up.

13:43.175 --> 13:44.698
It's not a joke.

13:44.759 --> 13:46.723
We really do need to do this work.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.748
You need to be able to speak from

13:50.111 --> 13:52.133
experience and experience is reading.

13:52.673 --> 14:11.167
You know, if you read a book like bacteriophages, biology and applications, and you come out with some different interpretation of what you thought you understood, that's a significant experience, that's a significant change in the amount of wisdom that you might present possess.

14:11.668 --> 14:15.191
And every one of these exercises, if you read a book, like

14:15.831 --> 14:25.737
genes, germs, and medicine, the life of Joshua Lederberg, and you come out with different insights on certain topics, that's pushing the ball forward.

14:25.777 --> 14:31.601
And anyone can do this work because these books are available for like $5 on eBay.

14:33.202 --> 14:39.586
And so I am increasingly more confused at, once you see it,

14:40.734 --> 14:42.235
why no one takes any action.

14:42.776 --> 14:46.459
And so let's just, again, I'll just show you how easy it is.

14:46.539 --> 14:48.560
I'm just gonna put a timeline together.

14:50.142 --> 14:52.664
I'm gonna put a timeline together of Shannon.

14:54.205 --> 14:55.206
Is that her name, Shannon?

14:56.246 --> 14:59.349
Nicole Shanahan, excuse me, I'm getting everybody confused now.

14:59.809 --> 15:04.433
Nicole Shanahan, War Room, War Room, and then her own podcast,

15:09.144 --> 15:11.866
video that she posted 13 hours ago.

15:13.328 --> 15:24.678
Keep in mind that about 15 hours ago, or 20 hours ago, or 24 hours ago, I just did a program called, What is Autism Really?

15:25.399 --> 15:25.499
And

15:27.301 --> 15:28.662
15, 16 hours, what?

15:29.223 --> 15:34.807
12 hours later, Nicole Shanahan produced a video called, What is Autism Really?

15:34.947 --> 15:36.748
With that thumbnail.

15:37.329 --> 15:49.777
Could be accidental, could be coinkydink, or it could be that right now the pressure is so on in the right pressure points that we can actually see a real-time response.

15:51.379 --> 15:51.459
And

15:52.589 --> 16:02.616
By now, I think the people that have been together with us for a few years realize that that's inevitably gonna happen and it's probably happening right now.

16:02.676 --> 16:04.958
So let's watch a couple historic videos first.

16:05.618 --> 16:21.030
I will try to stop them as little as possible because I want to get to the third one and then get to a summary of what's going on because I have been taking it easy on these people for a while with my introduction, kind of because I know people get tired of it, but

16:22.205 --> 16:32.652
I do think it's still very, very important to point out how easily all of these data points line up in a way that can't be explained as chance.

16:36.134 --> 16:37.715
So let's see if I can do this.

16:37.815 --> 16:38.896
I'm going to go over here.

16:40.497 --> 16:41.597
And that's too big.

16:42.058 --> 16:42.918
Oh, that's on.

16:43.318 --> 16:43.959
Get rid of that.

16:44.539 --> 16:45.780
And then that's too big.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.701
And this one might not be on yet.

16:47.841 --> 16:48.662
No, it's not.

16:51.405 --> 17:20.320
oh my technical crew failed me again this is gonna switch to the notebook right oh no it didn't oh cool it might be a little bit out of focus I can't really tell there's something wrong with it it looks pixelated or something like oh it's too bright maybe it might be too bright because I got my backlight on hold on one second let me get the backlight off darn it

17:22.051 --> 17:26.392
This is going to not come off easily, of course, because I want it to come off right now.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.695
That might help.

17:39.736 --> 17:41.997
No, it still looks a little goofy to me.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.698
Let me see.

17:55.976 --> 17:56.917
I don't know, that might be better.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.301
Thank you very much for having patience.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.585
Let's see here.

18:06.568 --> 18:07.689
If I can get this started.

18:09.471 --> 18:10.852
And maybe I'll put this one down at a

18:13.100 --> 18:17.782
Yeah, so the address will fade in a minute.

18:17.802 --> 18:21.204
That's the address you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to.

18:22.024 --> 18:26.006
And again, you can use those links up there to keep up with stuff.

18:26.866 --> 18:29.528
I'm going to put us at B. And then where is that?

18:29.648 --> 18:30.428
That's the same.

18:30.448 --> 18:32.089
Yeah, I'm going to use that one.

18:33.009 --> 18:33.489
There we go.

18:33.509 --> 18:36.291
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's get this going.

18:37.971 --> 18:38.712
Thank you very much.

18:40.339 --> 18:42.500
Is this going to play now or is it going to give me a hard time?

18:42.660 --> 18:43.380
Hey, everyone.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.922
Tomorrow is a pivotal moment in our nation's history at 10 a.m.

18:46.982 --> 18:47.522
Eastern time.

18:47.542 --> 18:54.385
RFK will sit in front of the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing to be our nation's next secretary.

18:54.585 --> 18:55.506
OK, perfect.

18:55.546 --> 19:03.609
She framed it right up for when this was what she's talking about and when she's talking right, right before his confirmation hearing.

19:03.629 --> 19:04.650
So this will be insightful.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.331
of Health and Human Services.

19:06.371 --> 19:07.471
Or revealing, let's say.

19:07.491 --> 19:09.232
I urge everyone to call their U.S.

19:09.252 --> 19:13.475
senators over the following days and demand they vote yes on Bobby's nomination.

19:13.495 --> 19:15.296
He is more than qualified.

19:15.396 --> 19:18.097
He's proven, principled, and prepared to lead.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.859
I'll share a list below of key senators.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.081
If they represent your state, they need to hear from you.

19:26.462 --> 19:29.944
If they don't, please call your own senator and ask them to vote yes.

19:30.384 --> 19:32.205
We need as many votes as we can get.

19:33.404 --> 19:42.847
So this hasn't been widely reported, but in 2020, I cut large checks to Chuck Schumer to help Democrats flip two Senate seats in Georgia from red to blue.

19:43.948 --> 19:53.751
The two candidates I helped elect, Senator Raphael Warnock and Senator Jon Ossoff, please know I will be watching your votes very closely.

19:53.771 --> 20:00.633
I will make it my personal mission that you lose your seats in the Senate if you vote against the future health of America's children.

20:02.159 --> 20:16.594
And more than that, I also want to say to Senators Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Lisa Markofsky, Susan Collins, Bill Cassidy, Tom Tillis, James Lankford, Cory Booker, John Fetterman, Bernie Sanders, and Catherine Cortez Masto,

20:17.110 --> 20:20.452
This is a bipartisan message, and it comes directly from me.

20:21.052 --> 20:23.473
While Bobby may be willing to play nice, I won't.

20:23.833 --> 20:32.537
If you vote against him, I will personally fund challengers to primary you in your next election, and I will enlist hundreds of thousands to join me.

20:33.778 --> 20:37.279
Big Pharma and Big Ag have exploited us for far too long.

20:37.499 --> 20:37.980
It ends now.

20:38.820 --> 20:45.883
You're either on the- Big Pharma and Big Ag have exploited us too long and now she's going full tilt.

20:46.763 --> 20:48.664
That's the thing that we're supposed to believe.

20:49.865 --> 20:55.347
And so she's threatening people to donate lots of money.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.368
I gave a million dollars here, I'll give a million dollars there.

20:58.408 --> 21:05.471
It's a very big threat because a million dollars given to me would result in an AM radio station that would never go silent.

21:07.219 --> 21:08.660
It would result in billboards.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.284
It would result in high school curriculums.

21:12.364 --> 21:17.528
It would result in short courses, videos for free.

21:19.270 --> 21:25.675
But that's not where anybody, anytime, anyone ever gives any money for.

21:25.815 --> 21:33.242
It's just the people who barely have enough money who watch this stream and realize that we're actually onto something.

21:34.491 --> 21:37.473
and that we are risking everything to try and get it out.

21:37.553 --> 21:52.981
Not like her, who was retired when this all started and was apparently chilling for four years before she decided to get in and jump in on this, even though she apparently will say every once in a while that she has an autistic child.

21:55.603 --> 21:55.903
It is

21:57.952 --> 22:03.680
It is a terrible time that we are in right now because there are so many people that are lying.

22:03.720 --> 22:10.128
And I think this is the reason why it works because they all collectively know they are not who they say they are.

22:10.509 --> 22:12.932
They don't even use their real names a lot of times.

22:13.749 --> 22:28.259
But if you know that I'm stretching the truth about how my family's suffering and I know how your family's not really suffering anymore either, is it Andrew Wakefield and Polly Tommy and Mary Holland and all these other people.

22:30.281 --> 22:34.344
Unfortunately, there are also people like Brian Hooker who went along.

22:35.336 --> 22:48.260
who accepted the task, accepted the limitations, accepted the, okay, I guess we'll say autism for now, as long as you promise me we're gonna get justice for these people when we get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:48.280 --> 22:48.940
in the White House.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.460
And now we're here.

22:53.361 --> 22:55.662
And who's in front at CHD?

22:55.702 --> 22:56.542
Is it Brian Hooker?

22:57.799 --> 23:00.460
It's Mary Holland and Polly Tommy.

23:01.040 --> 23:08.281
Polly Tommy, who was on billboards in the UK, like 90 of them.

23:09.542 --> 23:18.784
And the billboards didn't say anything about saving kids from a vaccine schedule or for the dangers that we could stop children from getting.

23:18.864 --> 23:25.045
No, it was about autism awareness and about how that might be worth 6 million votes in an election.

23:26.431 --> 23:29.193
And then she and Andrew Wakefield came to the United States.

23:29.293 --> 23:31.695
Oh yeah, with that guy, Peter Daszak too.

23:32.076 --> 23:37.840
The one that published a paper with Andrew Wakefield on measles, you know, about 10 years before that.

23:39.361 --> 23:42.284
They all came to the United States at roughly the same time.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.286
And then we're here.

23:47.008 --> 23:47.388
We're here.

23:49.244 --> 23:58.993
Think about this for a second because it is crucial if you can understand that the history can't lie like that, that these paths are not random destiny.

24:00.815 --> 24:05.499
This is a carefully orchestrated theater full of people who have decided to look away.

24:07.714 --> 24:14.418
It's a term that the military and other people in the government and intelligence agencies, you know, like Robert Malone, it's the look away doctrine.

24:14.458 --> 24:23.102
If you don't just don't ask what's behind that curtain, here's your briefcase of money, here's your guns, there's your assignment, go ahead.

24:24.003 --> 24:25.724
Don't worry about the screams back there.

24:29.744 --> 24:46.231
And somehow or another, all of these people know that they think they're getting a ticket on a boat that we're not gonna be on or a passcode to the tunnel cities that we're not gonna be able to get into because we won't have the passcode.

24:46.931 --> 24:54.274
It's really remarkable because once you see that they're purposefully not winning.

24:54.294 --> 24:59.196
A side of transparency and accountability or you are standing in the way.

24:59.847 --> 25:00.607
The choice is yours.

25:00.707 --> 25:01.707
Please choose wisely.

25:04.368 --> 25:07.789
Nicole Shanahan, Lord have mercy, girl, you threw down hard.

25:07.829 --> 25:10.789
Tell me about what was that, ma'am?

25:12.810 --> 25:15.790
You know, we're pissed.

25:15.830 --> 25:16.530
The moms are pissed.

25:16.610 --> 25:18.211
I'm pissed.

25:18.231 --> 25:23.972
And watching the line of questioning that Bobby has had to endure the last two days,

25:24.537 --> 25:34.744
from individuals that have received millions upon millions of dollars direct from the pharmaceutical companies has been infuriating.

25:35.324 --> 25:36.065
And you know what?

25:36.125 --> 25:36.625
Hold up.

25:38.046 --> 25:38.867
Hold up.

25:39.807 --> 25:41.208
Hold up a second.

25:41.328 --> 25:43.070
Hold up a second.

25:44.391 --> 25:44.951
Hold up.

25:47.301 --> 25:48.802
Hold up a second.

25:49.202 --> 25:49.863
Hold up.

25:50.743 --> 25:51.504
Here we go.

25:51.964 --> 25:56.267
Thing is, is the MAGA MAHA movement is so big.

25:56.808 --> 25:59.950
I really do think it's the largest movement on the planet right now.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.291
And we're all watching this.

26:02.692 --> 26:06.874
Do you think any Senate- The largest movement on the planet.

26:06.934 --> 26:14.099
I'm not sure that there's a way for me to argue with that necessarily, but that's a pretty remarkably odd

26:15.976 --> 26:22.317
confirmation hearing has had this many live viewers, certainly not as many that are this deeply vested.

26:23.537 --> 26:25.378
And that's what this is all about right now.

26:26.238 --> 26:29.198
I didn't expect that video to go as viral as it did.

26:30.399 --> 26:35.239
And I've heard from so many people who are like, we're ready to go.

26:35.499 --> 26:37.440
Can you please primary my senator?

26:39.820 --> 26:40.880
They're just fed up.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.661
We're all fed up.

26:42.461 --> 26:43.841
And it's time for

26:44.480 --> 26:47.461
It's time to clean out this mess from our government.

26:48.137 --> 26:50.238
Nicole, time to clean out this mess.

26:50.258 --> 26:57.081
Were you taken back by the viciousness of the, not the content of the questions, but the viciousness of the delivery?

26:57.401 --> 27:02.084
I'm not even really sure that this is Steve Bannon because he doesn't have his three pens.

27:02.684 --> 27:07.146
This could be a signal that this isn't Steve Bannon, but it's a guy in a Steve Bannon suit.

27:08.207 --> 27:14.730
Usually the real Steve Bannon will have three pens to indicate his allegiances to whatever, you know, secret organizations.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.778
So this could be a guy in a Bannon suit.

27:18.118 --> 27:19.039
Some of the questions, ma'am.

27:20.641 --> 27:25.927
I don't know where they get this self-righteous viciousness.

27:26.688 --> 27:31.894
It is, you know, part of me wonders if they actually believe half of what they're saying.

27:31.974 --> 27:33.816
Some of it just feels like theater.

27:34.839 --> 27:51.826
And the reality is, is for the rest of us out here living this reality every single day in America, helping our kids through, you know, a new historic flu season, a new historic RSV season, children that are born with autoimmune issues.

27:52.187 --> 27:53.867
It's not theater for us.

27:54.347 --> 27:56.829
This is our lived reality.

27:57.609 --> 28:00.290
And so when I see that viciousness up there.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.251
It's not theater for us?

28:03.840 --> 28:05.041
We're not faking this.

28:06.043 --> 28:09.907
I didn't go, I'm not faking this, says Mary Holland.

28:09.947 --> 28:10.828
I'm not faking this.

28:10.888 --> 28:13.531
I've been trying really hard for 20 years now.

28:14.132 --> 28:20.339
Ever since, ever since I kind of sort of lost my job, not really at Columbia University.

28:24.781 --> 28:26.602
I mean, seriously, this is crazy.

28:26.662 --> 28:26.983
Oops.

28:27.983 --> 28:28.404
Darn it.

28:30.005 --> 28:31.986
I don't know why that's not working for me today.

28:32.066 --> 28:35.128
This is always needing of disconnecting and reconnecting.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.009
Beep, beep.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.131
Beep, beep.

28:40.192 --> 28:41.012
Darn you, demon.

28:42.893 --> 28:44.334
Let's get this going.

28:47.977 --> 28:48.477
That's better.

28:48.597 --> 28:49.058
Okay.

28:49.118 --> 28:49.798
Keep going here.

28:51.399 --> 28:52.280
On Capitol Hill.

28:53.308 --> 28:55.709
It's these people are acting.

28:56.270 --> 29:06.015
And I think that at this point, the Democratic Party chooses its candidates based on who can act, not who gives a damn, who can tell like any bit.

29:06.395 --> 29:13.459
Maybe the Democratic Party chooses people who can act on television, like on PBS News and on NBC.

29:14.740 --> 29:19.783
And the right is choosing people that can act on podcasts.

29:21.932 --> 29:29.316
And it's just a battle between the old media and the new media and how quickly can the new media adapt to the new media?

29:29.376 --> 29:32.177
And oh my goodness, once you see it, it's kind of a joke.

29:33.818 --> 29:46.444
Because remember this lady came out a couple of days ago on Glenn Beck, we watched and she said that she was against Casey means because Casey means wants to harvest our data.

29:47.325 --> 29:48.085
It's remarkable.

29:48.755 --> 30:07.526
because of course she during the campaign advocated for the harvesting of our data, just different data, not the data from Fitbits and Apple watches, but the data from, you know, everything else, including our medical records, which is remarkable because that is indeed the data that they want.

30:08.466 --> 30:18.212
Because once they get permission to have that data, they can use AI to take that data and match it to genetic samples that were taken during the pandemic.

30:18.272 --> 30:18.392
But

30:19.394 --> 30:20.615
I mean, I don't wanna get too deep there.

30:20.996 --> 30:28.163
Of their lived experience through any bit of integrity, because they're so detached and they're so removed and the people feel it.

30:28.724 --> 30:32.768
Many of the senators we've heard from that were- It is quite remarkable that she's reading.

30:32.848 --> 30:35.030
So she's hitting these words on purpose.

30:35.931 --> 30:37.232
The words that we've been using.

30:37.673 --> 30:39.174
Theater, right?

30:39.515 --> 30:40.155
Integrity.

30:40.676 --> 30:41.677
There's nobody

30:42.725 --> 30:53.051
Nobody in this narrative has an unblemished record of integrity because once they figured out something wasn't as important as they thought it was, they kept going.

30:53.732 --> 30:59.495
Whether it was the spike protein or the ivermectin, they kept going until they got a book deal.

30:59.555 --> 31:01.736
They kept going until they got on Rogan.

31:01.757 --> 31:08.921
They kept going until they got anywhere because they were given a script and they were told to stick to it.

31:10.029 --> 31:26.299
That's why I show you that clip in the very beginning of Kevin McCairn saying, you know, and Addy Adds, friend of George Webb, talking about, in March of 2020, talking about EcoHealth Alliance, and then him having it up on screen and not realizing that he had it on screen.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.623
It is, yeah, I told you, go at this NPO.

31:32.921 --> 31:33.902
And where are we now?

31:34.783 --> 31:40.888
Five years later, we're there with Kevin McKernan on a giant podcast telling us the same thing.

31:41.389 --> 31:46.293
It's Anthony Fauci boomerang the money through EcoHealth Alliance to the whiv.

31:47.008 --> 31:47.748
What's the whip?

31:48.429 --> 31:50.929
It's all the same script.

31:51.470 --> 31:54.871
And it was a script that they can't leave behind.

31:54.951 --> 31:57.972
And that's why it's so obvious and so visible now.

31:58.512 --> 32:15.138
And this script about a novel virus was supposed to bring the left and the right together into this little pseudo new age interpretation of the world where moms are angry and it's about chronic disease and allergies and stuff.

32:17.597 --> 32:20.979
the harshest, barely won their seats.

32:21.119 --> 32:26.041
I mean, Cortez Masto, she won her seat by less than 1%.

32:26.982 --> 32:44.731
So it's all about elections and less than 1% means that if something like autism is worth thousands of votes, then it could be a really nice chip to have in your stack, as the fake populist health freedom movement Bannon crew would have surely realized.

32:46.124 --> 33:07.208
Maybe the whole national security state realized it, and that's why they brought Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy over, or even worse, even worse, maybe it's some other group of people like the Fabians or something like that, or a bunch of people that are loyal to the city of London, and they brought them all over, because it's a lot of English people.

33:08.648 --> 33:13.969
Although Mary Holland is not English, she just went to Russia for like three years for whatever reason.

33:15.569 --> 33:22.071
I mean, these things are like low, these seats are low hanging fruit and we're coming after every single one of them.

33:22.091 --> 33:25.172
Unbelievable.

33:25.593 --> 33:27.273
Can you, can you bear with us?

33:27.313 --> 33:31.835
I want to take a short commercial break and bring back some other questions about this.

33:32.735 --> 33:38.877
She was the vice presidential candidate with Bobby Kennedy until they rolled in and partnered up with President Trump.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.398
Why is this a historic day?

33:41.388 --> 33:47.993
on Capitol Hill for Bobby Kennedy and both the MAGA movement and particularly the Make America Healthy Again movement.

33:48.013 --> 33:50.094
Why is this a transcendent moment, man?

33:50.394 --> 33:55.978
So what's happening in that enchantment, I just want to be very clear about this and so that you can see it as I see it.

33:56.598 --> 34:06.105
They are stating the MAHA movement, the MAGA movement, the Make America Healthy Again movement, the Health Freedom movement.

34:08.243 --> 34:22.709
It's like saying the gay community, you know, or the trans community, you are speaking into existence something that is almost exclusively exists on social media alone.

34:24.076 --> 34:31.066
And that insight, once it kind of sinks into your head, will make your interpretation of the scroll very different.

34:31.126 --> 34:39.018
And the way that you read it and experience it will be far less potentially emotional or unnerving.

34:39.861 --> 34:49.030
Because you'll see it just as a military program and it's giving you sort of potential responses and trying to gauge them.

34:49.051 --> 34:59.081
And all the more that you interact with it under the pretense that it's just reality based on your follower list, you are giving them information unwittingly.

35:01.334 --> 35:28.019
And these people are paid by the owners of those machines, those software suites, Rumble, Locals, Roken, YouTube, and all of this stuff to make those platforms more relevant for the controlling of voters, the controlling of the attention of people, of citizens.

35:28.988 --> 35:37.231
Because as somebody like Alex Karp said, it's really important to understand how people know things.

35:37.351 --> 35:52.256
And if you understand how people know things, and that is by listening to other people sometimes, and especially listening to other people that agree with each other, then you'll understand how to fool them into thinking they know things.

35:52.316 --> 35:56.537
And that's what is being weaponized here, whether she knows it or not.

35:58.004 --> 35:59.985
She knows she's participating in something.

36:00.045 --> 36:11.213
I just don't think she's clever enough to understand that she's, you know, really, really part of a very malevolent machine that is part of the controlled demolition of America.

36:11.393 --> 36:14.775
But I guess she has to know, otherwise she wouldn't be playing along.

36:15.675 --> 36:18.898
I'll explain it through a story, a personal story.

36:18.958 --> 36:25.082
My dear friend and mentor has a 26 year old vaccine injured daughter, and she's been at this for 20,

36:26.331 --> 36:34.116
you know, five or plus years, you know, and she's been trying to, she hasn't been heard.

36:34.476 --> 36:42.121
She has- A vaccine injured daughter, but then she's gonna be entirely aspecific about how she was injured.

36:42.182 --> 36:43.122
Is she autistic?

36:43.182 --> 36:45.304
Does she bang her head against the wall?

36:45.384 --> 36:46.424
Is she incontinent?

36:49.706 --> 36:51.508
Does she scream and yell at random?

36:52.674 --> 36:54.435
Can she be brought to the grocery store?

36:54.475 --> 36:56.576
Does she have a job at a YouTube channel?

36:57.656 --> 36:59.477
Hasn't been heard for two decades.

36:59.997 --> 37:00.698
She hasn't been heard.

37:01.058 --> 37:08.241
So for her to tune in and watch all, like watch Mary Holland no longer be fringe.

37:09.369 --> 37:13.731
Watch Bobby Kennedy talking on behalf of her personal story.

37:13.911 --> 37:17.273
Mary Holland is still extremely fringe.

37:17.433 --> 37:32.820
And on the internet, please understand on the social media, militarized platforms, you can perceive her as being mainstream because they only have 150 posts to show you.

37:34.661 --> 37:37.202
And so with a few fake comments,

37:38.223 --> 37:42.747
They can create the illusion of anything that they want to with a few fake comments on YouTube.

37:42.767 --> 37:47.911
They can create the illusion of a response to the video that you just watched that might not even be real.

37:49.329 --> 37:50.510
the response that you want.

37:51.070 --> 37:52.411
Bret Weinstein is a genius.

37:52.511 --> 37:53.731
The response that you want.

37:54.152 --> 37:57.473
Wow, Jordan Peterson is the most intelligent man on earth.

37:57.533 --> 38:08.199
And 50 comments underneath the video that say that will make it seem as though there is a consensus of people that thinks that Jordan Peterson is the path to, you know, ultimate wisdom.

38:11.164 --> 38:19.129
And all of these types of tricks are, you are totally vulnerable to them if you use social media skillfully, i.e.

38:19.209 --> 38:26.494
you use it as a window to the reality that is defined by your follower list, because that's not what it is.

38:28.275 --> 38:31.217
And so until you understand it, you should better get off of it.

38:33.218 --> 38:36.080
And then when you understand it, you might choose to stay off of it anyway.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.101
Right.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.722
The sad part of this all,

38:39.491 --> 38:41.072
is that it is no longer fringe.

38:41.152 --> 38:46.335
It's no longer fringe because that many families are impacted by this crisis.

38:46.835 --> 38:49.957
That many families are impacted by this malfeasance.

38:51.077 --> 38:55.259
I mean, that's why- Malfeasance, you think that's a word she uses very often?

38:55.479 --> 39:02.363
Isn't that crazy how many words she's chosen that come directly from our little lexicon of slides?

39:03.844 --> 39:04.984
Today is historic.

39:05.084 --> 39:07.966
It's sad that it is historic.

39:08.584 --> 39:13.045
It's sad because it indicates how big of a problem we have on our hands today.

39:15.602 --> 39:20.043
Some of the folks that you said, hey, I'm going to primary these guys because men and women shouldn't be around.

39:20.083 --> 39:22.563
Some of you have actually supported before.

39:23.504 --> 39:34.826
Did you not know at the time that they didn't really support your core beliefs, or particularly since Make America Healthy, again, is central to your whole mission and why you're kind of involved in politics in the first place?

39:35.306 --> 39:36.486
Did you not understand it?

39:36.646 --> 39:37.666
Did they get bought off?

39:37.706 --> 39:38.406
Did they flip?

39:38.466 --> 39:40.087
Are they not the people you thought they were?

39:40.907 --> 39:41.467
What about that?

39:42.816 --> 39:44.277
They're not the people I thought they were.

39:44.297 --> 39:44.498
It was 2020.

39:45.298 --> 39:49.042
I supported Warnock and Ossoff.

39:49.162 --> 39:50.503
I supported Chuck Schumer.

39:51.044 --> 39:54.167
And I went back and I looked at my notes from then.

39:54.207 --> 39:57.029
I looked at my email exchanges with Chuck Schumer's office.

39:57.730 --> 40:04.877
And I had gone to Chuck Schumer with- How is it possible that you can claim to know what's going on if you were supporting those people?

40:06.800 --> 40:09.504
I mean, supposedly she's really, really, really rich.

40:09.584 --> 40:13.530
So she can do, you know, she's got a lot of FU money.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.743
and yet she was playing like just any other donor, right?

40:17.863 --> 40:21.424
Just like any other fish in the casino.

40:22.164 --> 40:26.805
She just went and sat down at the craps table and it was just the expensive craps table, that's it.

40:26.825 --> 40:27.765
And now what?

40:27.805 --> 40:32.306
She's saying that, hey, wait a minute, I think that this gambling stuff isn't right.

40:32.846 --> 40:38.387
I think we should be playing, you know, we should be playing blackjack instead of craps or something.

40:38.427 --> 40:39.948
I don't even know what she's saying here.

40:40.988 --> 40:45.273
huge folder full of documents about regenerative agriculture.

40:45.653 --> 40:50.918
And I said, why are you guys talking about all of these other climate change policies?

40:51.059 --> 41:01.249
All you have to do is fix our agricultural system and everything you're talking about in terms of emissions and balancing our carbon cycle can be addressed through regenerative agriculture.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.070
Will you please

41:03.072 --> 41:04.013
please do this.

41:04.633 --> 41:12.857
And he looked at- So climate change is a problem, but we can do it with regenerative agriculture is not exactly.

41:12.977 --> 41:15.679
I mean, he said, yes, you know, I need your help.

41:16.659 --> 41:20.001
And he explained to me that he needed to win back the Senate majority.

41:20.021 --> 41:22.543
And so I cut him checks.

41:22.603 --> 41:26.645
I said, okay, well, if you're going to take- I cut him checks.

41:29.244 --> 41:34.390
Can you imagine if somebody cut me a check so that I could hire a few people?

41:35.411 --> 41:36.772
I mean, this is a joke to me.

41:37.012 --> 41:42.098
Take on regenerative agriculture and we can move beyond all of this climate change mess.

41:43.740 --> 41:44.921
I'm happy to support you.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.743
This sounds like a great opportunity.

41:47.569 --> 41:48.610
And so I did.

41:48.830 --> 41:58.136
And then when that Senate runoff happened in Georgia, I happened to actually have a woman I had just started to work with.

41:58.176 --> 41:59.417
Her name is Shirley Sherrod.

42:00.037 --> 42:04.200
She was head of agriculture at the USDA under Obama's administration.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.182
And she actually got pushed out.

42:07.222 --> 42:09.404
They were very vicious to her, that administration.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.185
There was some... She's just reading.

42:11.225 --> 42:14.507
It's supposed to sound all good and whatever, but she's just reading.

42:16.571 --> 42:23.274
You know, there's an NAACP speech that she gave that was mis-edited and then put online.

42:23.354 --> 42:27.516
And interestingly, it was Brett Bart at the time when he was still a blogger.

42:28.416 --> 42:33.818
And it went viral and they turned on Shirley without even any due process.

42:33.838 --> 42:36.719
They just turned on her and they kicked, they pushed her out.

42:37.519 --> 42:41.281
And so Shirley is in rural Georgia and she's been organizing

42:42.423 --> 42:51.626
rural Georgian farmers and I reached out to her and she happened to have a C4 and I said, hey, you know, I know Stacey Abrams can't get out to rural Georgia.

42:53.086 --> 42:56.067
Can you, you know, do you want to mobilize?

42:56.167 --> 42:57.788
And she said, yeah, I'd love to.

42:58.108 --> 42:59.708
And, you know, I have a C4.

42:59.808 --> 43:02.249
So I sent her a million dollars to her C4.

43:04.350 --> 43:05.030
I'm sorry, what?

43:06.792 --> 43:08.133
Is that how rich people do it?

43:08.193 --> 43:12.615
They just, you know, and they, they have a good cause and they have a brief phone call with somebody.

43:12.675 --> 43:17.037
Yes, I want to do something about the kids and, and, and I want to get in office.

43:17.117 --> 43:19.878
And so here's a million dollars for your C4.

43:19.898 --> 43:21.599
Is that a 501 C4?

43:21.619 --> 43:23.520
What is that shit?

43:27.625 --> 43:32.567
and she got out that vote, and they just narrowly, narrowly pulled off that race.

43:32.587 --> 43:39.669
There's suspicion that there was some ballot stuffing and ballot integrity issues, and the seats were, quote, stolen.

43:39.689 --> 43:40.970
I don't know if that's true.

43:41.030 --> 43:46.452
Perhaps it is, but I do know the role that I played in all of that, and I take responsibility for it.

43:47.472 --> 43:49.813
And I was wrong to ever trust these people.

43:49.873 --> 43:55.415
And many Democrats are opening up to this acceptance.

43:56.035 --> 44:00.043
that they were wrong, they were misguided, they were lied to.

44:01.125 --> 44:03.049
And it's all this bait and switch.

44:03.269 --> 44:04.371
And that's what the party's been.

44:04.471 --> 44:08.199
And nobody in their right mind can continue to support that.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.303
Boy, Shirley Sherrod, I dealt with.

44:12.383 --> 44:13.664
I was Andrew Breitbart's partner.

44:13.724 --> 44:14.804
That's a whole nightmare.

44:14.884 --> 44:18.505
If it was not for Anthony Weiner, Andrew would have never been back on Fox.

44:18.525 --> 44:19.845
I'll tell that story later.

44:19.885 --> 44:24.206
But man, you just sent shivers down my spine in the Shirley Sherrod tape.

44:24.646 --> 44:27.526
Before I let you go, there's been some talk.

44:27.786 --> 44:30.127
You're very upset what's happened in California.

44:30.387 --> 44:35.948
And there's some talk that you might be interested in running for governor against Gavin Newsom.

44:35.988 --> 44:36.928
Is there any truth to that rumor?

44:38.717 --> 44:40.098
There is truth to that rumor.

44:40.618 --> 44:43.540
I'm putting together an exploratory committee this coming summer.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.682
I haven't committed to running yet.

44:45.722 --> 44:47.663
There's quite a bit of work that needs to be done.

44:47.683 --> 44:49.765
If it's my time, I will run.

44:49.785 --> 44:58.671
If it is not my time, I will throw the full weight of my support, my media team, my endorsement behind somebody great, who is Maha Maga.

44:58.691 --> 45:03.174
Well, I guess Newsom's not going to run again.

45:03.194 --> 45:05.656
I guess he's not going to get recalled because we've got a year left.

45:06.690 --> 45:06.850
Yeah.

45:06.910 --> 45:07.010
Yeah.

45:07.030 --> 45:14.277
Nicole Shanahan, uh, where do people go to find out more about you, more about your support and kind of, you're one of the co-founders of the Maha movement.

45:14.317 --> 45:16.039
Where do people go to find out more about that?

45:16.839 --> 45:18.341
Make America healthy again, where they go.

45:18.581 --> 45:24.086
One of the co-founders of the Maha movement, you know, like the, I don't know the hippies and stuff.

45:24.166 --> 45:25.828
I it's, it's remarkable.

45:26.268 --> 45:30.272
Go to find out why this is a historic day and where we're up against in all of this, ma'am.

45:31.772 --> 45:38.136
Yeah, I mean, we are really a team, Steve, now, and I really appreciate the work you've been doing on transhumanism.

45:38.556 --> 45:40.558
That's a topic that I'm very passionate about.

45:41.338 --> 45:43.820
I have a podcast called Back to the People.

45:44.580 --> 45:49.143
You can find us on all of the major streaming platforms as well.

45:49.223 --> 45:53.966
I'm very active on X. That's kind of straight from my head onto the keyboard.

45:53.986 --> 45:57.388
X is relevant, X is relevant.

45:57.508 --> 45:59.690
Every time you say it, you get paid.

46:01.114 --> 46:02.915
Um, it doesn't go through a big team.

46:02.995 --> 46:05.216
It's, it's my personal way to communicate.

46:05.237 --> 46:09.919
Um, when I'm finding when I'm, it's my personal way to communicate.

46:10.219 --> 46:14.102
I endorse using Twitter as a personal way to communicate.

46:14.482 --> 46:22.706
And if you use Twitter, then with the follower list you have, you will see a real time conversation between you and the world.

46:25.968 --> 46:26.989
Gosh, it's gross.

46:28.356 --> 46:30.838
thinking and the direction that I'm taking my work.

46:33.300 --> 46:36.142
Nicole Shanahan on X, where do people get you on X?

46:37.563 --> 46:38.544
At Nicole Shanahan.

46:41.046 --> 46:41.486
Thank you, ma'am.

46:41.526 --> 46:42.167
Appreciate you.

46:42.307 --> 46:43.107
Thanks for coming on.

46:43.648 --> 46:44.609
Thanks very much, Steve.

46:45.029 --> 46:45.389
Take care.

46:47.991 --> 46:55.337
I just want to briefly take a little interlude here and let you know

46:57.192 --> 47:04.718
that one of the ways that you can change your perspective, like force a change, and there's a lot of people who might not have any anymore.

47:04.738 --> 47:07.560
I am an optics freak.

47:08.301 --> 47:09.582
I love microscopes.

47:09.822 --> 47:10.863
I love telescopes.

47:11.043 --> 47:12.484
I love binoculars.

47:12.845 --> 47:14.246
Oh my gosh, I love binoculars.

47:14.846 --> 47:24.794
The reason why I love binoculars is because if you get a good pair, they create an image with depth that you cannot otherwise see.

47:26.436 --> 47:31.639
And it can make, it can put your mind in a different perspective.

47:31.679 --> 47:35.441
It can really change the dimensions in which your mind functions.

47:35.622 --> 47:51.252
And maybe I'm just being ridiculous here, but I find it very, very mind clearing to get a pair of binoculars, go sit in the backyard and make sure they're in focus and then look at stuff.

47:53.635 --> 47:54.876
It can steady your mind.

47:55.917 --> 47:56.938
It can clear your mind.

47:56.998 --> 48:02.903
And more importantly, if you have the right set of binoculars, it's just something you're going to love it.

48:02.943 --> 48:19.057
So, I want to recommend, if you go on eBay, if you're risking, if you're going to do that, you want to try something, you're looking for the company called Nippon Kagaku.

48:20.618 --> 48:22.579
It's Nippon like, you know, Japan.

48:22.839 --> 48:23.959
N-I-P-P-O-N.

48:25.099 --> 48:29.400
And then K-O-G-A-K-U.

48:31.861 --> 48:33.842
They make really tiny ones too.

48:35.082 --> 48:36.582
Which I don't have a pair out now.

48:37.103 --> 48:41.684
They make more regular sized ones like 7x35 or something like that.

48:41.744 --> 48:48.126
But these smaller ones, the smaller ones, the more compact ones that they made were exceptional.

48:49.326 --> 48:53.774
The short story of this, I'll just show you the ones that are my favorite favorite.

48:59.502 --> 49:04.286
My favorite favorite are these Micron glasses and they're super tiny.

49:05.327 --> 49:08.629
You might even call them something like opera glasses except they're not.

49:08.689 --> 49:12.472
Because if you have steady enough hands you could even bird with these.

49:13.073 --> 49:17.956
And these are a newer version because they have focus on both sides here.

49:18.597 --> 49:22.980
And you only have to focus the one side like a regular pair of binoculars.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.121
Sorry I'm looking at the wrong camera.

49:25.979 --> 49:29.964
But the earlier versions of them, you just focus the monocular separately.

49:29.984 --> 49:32.387
And then they're just kind of there.

49:32.607 --> 49:36.492
And so if you were at a concert or something like that, you wouldn't change the focus anyway.

49:36.532 --> 49:40.617
But if you were birding, these are maybe the more advanced version, the newer ones.

49:41.238 --> 49:42.239
So this company,

49:46.846 --> 50:06.439
this company uh i don't know if whoops that's not working this way uh you can kind of see it there but not really i gotta move the camera up um and if you look underneath here if you look underneath on these you look right in there for a um very brief period of time

50:07.581 --> 50:14.607
In Japanese history, of course, Japan was occupied by America.

50:14.647 --> 50:28.400
And so I have a few mint condition of these that I got a long time ago back when I was obsessed with them and also a biologist where they say made in occupied Japan, which is pretty cool.

50:29.060 --> 50:31.402
And so I got really obsessed with collecting those.

50:31.602 --> 50:34.225
And then during the course of the pandemic,

50:37.297 --> 50:39.239
It just breaks my heart to say it out loud.

50:39.419 --> 50:40.339
I gave them away.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.882
Some of my very, very, very best.

50:45.363 --> 50:46.584
I cleaned some of them.

50:46.664 --> 50:47.965
I realigned some of them.

50:48.005 --> 50:49.346
They were all beautiful.

50:49.766 --> 50:53.409
And I gave them away to people that I thought were good people that had helped me.

50:54.110 --> 50:54.470
I gave

50:55.994 --> 51:07.323
One pair of those to Charles Rixey when he left my house in January of 2022 after he came to try and convince me that the diffuse proposal was real and for a little while I believed it again.

51:08.945 --> 51:19.093
I gave a pair of these to Greg Glassman to thank him for bringing me to the Broken Science Initiative, introducing me to people like Matt Briggs.

51:20.435 --> 51:21.736
I gave a pair of these

51:24.369 --> 51:32.607
to one of my favorite and most generous funders over the last year and a half, a family in Canada.

51:35.393 --> 51:42.916
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever given a pair to Mark Kulak, but Mark Kulak definitely deserves a pair of these out of my collection.

51:44.077 --> 51:47.178
Anyway, get a pair of binoculars.

51:47.218 --> 51:53.320
A small pair that you can carry around all the time is actually ideal, because you never know when you want to change your perspective.

51:53.360 --> 51:58.102
So you can just put this underneath your shirt, and no one will know it's there.

51:58.162 --> 52:04.085
But you, and anytime you need reminding that your perspective should change, it's going to be hanging there.

52:05.025 --> 52:07.747
Or you can get a little bit larger pair of glasses.

52:07.807 --> 52:23.977
I don't recommend that you get a giant pair Because the the higher the magnification the more frustrating it is to get a good image And the more steady you need to be And so if you get you know, don't spend a lot of money you can get a pair of these sometimes for $40 or $30 and

52:26.952 --> 52:32.135
I'm actually going to start getting some of these and cleaning them up and then putting them on my own eBay page.

52:32.776 --> 52:40.741
And so the ones that I think are really good and I can sell for, you know, for relatively cheap, then I'll start putting a few of those up.

52:41.401 --> 52:46.685
But for now, it's still just my own collection and part of the way that I clear my mind.

52:47.785 --> 52:55.010
But just keep in mind that it's very easy to buy a pair of binoculars on eBay and have them be absolutely a piece of junk.

52:56.249 --> 52:57.110
ask me how I know.

52:57.811 --> 53:01.916
Let's go to the next video because I do have more work ahead of us.

53:02.837 --> 53:09.684
Let me just switch over here again and over here again and let's resume this.

53:12.267 --> 53:13.448
She's going to come back on.

53:13.468 --> 53:14.209
See, that's the thing.

53:14.669 --> 53:15.610
She's coming back on.

53:16.811 --> 53:18.292
She's got three pens this time.

53:19.433 --> 53:23.576
With RFK came forward and supported President Trump.

53:24.237 --> 53:27.300
Nicole, the reason I wanted to have you on here is to kind of kick this off.

53:27.340 --> 53:34.045
We haven't had a lot of opportunity to really focus on what RFK is doing over HHS as he starts to man up and will be announcing it.

53:35.186 --> 53:48.139
and his whole thing of make America healthy again, a huge aspect of that that nobody's talking about, and that we pray President Trump is just as aggressive as he's been on these other nominations, is the U.S.

53:48.179 --> 53:49.760
Department of Agriculture.

53:50.341 --> 53:53.884
Can you just walk our audience through, because you spend a lot of time on this, that merger

53:54.525 --> 54:05.796
When we talk about Make America Healthy Again and everything RFK is going to do with big pharma and big medicine and that whole biopharmaceutical industrial complex.

54:06.597 --> 54:09.399
Biopharmaceutical industrial complex is a

54:10.260 --> 54:28.469
A bullshit combination of words that was first really thrown out at us at this amazing event called Rescue the Republic, which was organized apparently by a guy by the name of Brett Weinstein, whose father has nothing to do with anything like the FDA or thalidomide or anything like that.

54:30.161 --> 54:41.606
or Al Gore's dad, or Senator Estes Kefauver, nothing to do with any of that, nevermind Bobby Kennedy's father, nothing to do with that, nothing to see there.

54:41.986 --> 54:44.747
You're coming at it from a different angle, and that's agriculture.

54:44.787 --> 54:46.928
Walk us through your construct, ma'am.

54:48.109 --> 54:49.869
Yeah, first, thanks for having me, Steve.

54:49.909 --> 54:52.090
It's a real honor to be here on your show.

54:53.171 --> 54:54.651
Well, it's going down right now.

54:55.212 --> 54:56.252
It's such a weird thing.

54:56.292 --> 54:57.092
There used to be this,

54:58.479 --> 55:04.322
this radio program in the 90s that I listened to in Chicago.

55:05.183 --> 55:07.384
And it was called Man Cow in the morning.

55:07.644 --> 55:09.645
And it was this dude with a pretty nice voice.

55:10.926 --> 55:12.427
And whenever you called in,

55:13.291 --> 55:23.054
He had this co-host named Irene and she had a nice voice and they would talk and then, you know, they would bring someone on and, hi man, Kyle, love you, love your show.

55:23.154 --> 55:24.214
They had to say that.

55:24.274 --> 55:26.254
If you didn't say that, they wouldn't let you on.

55:26.895 --> 55:31.216
And so I find it really fascinating how all the, it's an honor to be on.

55:31.316 --> 55:32.836
It's an honor to be on your show.

55:32.856 --> 55:39.618
What does that even mean when this guy is dressed like, uh, you know, the maintenance man at the Cracker Barrel.

55:39.858 --> 55:59.464
nomination for head of the USDA is happening right this moment and there's an opportunity for the first time ever to get somebody in there who's a real farmer who's going to look out for the small family farms and who's going to revitalize our soil systems.

56:00.564 --> 56:08.807
I came to agriculture through a very narrow lens of looking at climate change and this is

56:09.945 --> 56:17.251
almost 10 years ago now, and I'm a technologist here in Silicon Valley, and I looked at- What does a technologist mean?

56:17.271 --> 56:20.594
Is that what it says on her resume?

56:20.634 --> 56:21.634
Is that what she does?

56:21.715 --> 56:23.016
What does that even mean?

56:23.856 --> 56:30.822
Is Steve Kirsch a technologist because he's allowed to say that he invented the optical mouse, which I really doubt?

56:33.404 --> 56:37.247
Is Elon Musk a technologist because he is the forward-facing

56:38.442 --> 56:48.945
monkey that represents as having like six companies that do such diverse engineering feats that, yeah, he's gotta be a genius, right?

56:49.405 --> 56:50.725
I mean, come on.

56:52.345 --> 57:02.348
Every one of the climate schemes that they had brought up that were being brought up and sold as- Exactly.

57:02.448 --> 57:04.168
Next page, Shanahan.

57:04.248 --> 57:05.268
She's auditioning.

57:05.828 --> 57:07.689
They're all auditioning.

57:08.749 --> 57:17.511
And if you see it that way, that they're auditioning for the next act, they're auditioning for the next wave, they're auditioning for the next selection.

57:19.391 --> 57:21.071
That's why she has a podcast.

57:21.531 --> 57:25.712
Isn't she like, wasn't she said to be a billionaire?

57:27.872 --> 57:29.653
I mean, that is just remarkable.

57:29.873 --> 57:37.274
You know, these green energy programs and none of them made sense to me looking at just the science and just the business of it.

57:38.209 --> 57:56.623
If we just look at carbon through this myopic lens of we have excess CO2 in the atmosphere and that is allegedly leading to a heating and climate change and climate change patterning.

57:57.023 --> 58:04.549
If you just look at it through that, you actually, and you spend time on the science and you realize the opportunity of soil

58:06.148 --> 58:08.411
And you realize the many, many benefits.

58:08.791 --> 58:15.140
Realize, realize, realize this is an enchantment of tending to our farmland.

58:15.160 --> 58:19.706
There's about 900 million acres of farmland in the United States.

58:20.908 --> 58:23.909
And you look at the history of our relationship with soil.

58:24.009 --> 58:26.490
When you don't take care of the soil, you get the dust bowl.

58:26.890 --> 58:30.032
When you don't take care of the soil, people go hungry.

58:30.512 --> 58:32.192
When you cut down American farms.

58:32.212 --> 58:37.955
So this is like another example where she's just on the war room reading a script.

58:39.495 --> 58:41.896
Is it likely that she put this script together?

58:41.996 --> 58:43.397
No, it's really not.

58:45.586 --> 58:53.891
Any more likely than it is that Kevin McCairn at the beginning of the pandemic was imagining and coming up with all the ideas that he was throwing out.

58:54.751 --> 58:59.634
It certainly wasn't by random that Kevin McCairn declared war on Andrew Kaufman in March of 2020.

59:00.174 --> 59:12.661
Farmland, you get inflation, you get expensive food products because the supply chain

59:13.901 --> 59:15.622
gets disrupted.

59:15.642 --> 59:19.166
And we saw that during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns.

59:20.126 --> 59:28.234
So now the supply chain is being disrupted for another mythological reason, instead of just the fact that they're destroying it.

59:31.737 --> 59:37.683
So you can't talk about any of these really big issues like inflation or climate without actually addressing the soil.

59:38.083 --> 59:39.064
You can't talk about health

59:39.557 --> 59:40.998
without addressing the soil.

59:41.338 --> 59:45.201
In this country, we use an enormous amount of glyphosate.

59:45.642 --> 59:52.907
Glyphosate has been tied for decades now to all kinds of autoimmune issues and cancers.

59:53.007 --> 01:00:03.515
In fact, Bayer and Monsanto, Bayer acquired Monsanto, has paid out over $11 billion in damages due to people getting sick

01:00:04.264 --> 01:00:14.928
from glyphosate and farmers getting sick and these very well-defined cancers that have been defined and linked conclusively to glyphosate exposure.

01:00:15.808 --> 01:00:21.170
You cannot address so many of the issues we have in America without addressing the USDA.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:27.652
Tom Vilsack, the current head of the USDA, he was the head of the USDA under Obama as well,

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:34.233
It's even hard to call him a commodities guy.

01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:40.799
He is somebody who is a puppet, who's put in there to keep this whole system running as it is.

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:43.481
He's made no major changes.

01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:52.268
To say that he's dedicated anything towards things that liberals care about, such as conservation, we've seen no movement there.

01:00:54.038 --> 01:01:03.746
The farm bill, something we don't hear much about that we really ought to be listening and paying much more close attention to in terms of what's going into it.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:07.489
These are five and then 10-year bills, budgets.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:16.057
The next one that's up right now is going to be the first 10-year farm bill that exceeds a trillion dollars.

01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:20.388
So this is stuff that we have to be paying attention to.

01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:24.370
Calling it the Farm Bill doesn't even make sense.

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.972
It's over a trillion dollars, mostly going to the SNAP program.

01:01:30.763 --> 01:01:55.372
fruit fruit stamps and that very unhealthy but hang hang on a second as you know this is a populist nationalist show with a huge mega audience and we always try to support the little guy but when you have nine hundred million acres in in the and we'd love family farms in the family farmer in the little guy but isn't that just fun nostalgia for an america that's past i mean is it to feed america and to feed the world

01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:59.954
or to help feed the world, don't you need massive agribusiness?

01:01:59.994 --> 01:02:01.895
Don't you need Archer Daniel Midland?

01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:03.176
Don't you need Monsanto?

01:02:03.856 --> 01:02:15.041
Isn't this something that scales up and why people, I think, appreciate the fact, you know, your show, Back to the People, and all your things are related to family farmers and the soil and all the stuff that's going.

01:02:16.022 --> 01:02:17.703
Isn't that just nostalgia, ma'am?

01:02:19.617 --> 01:02:21.658
I don't think so.

01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:34.263
I've looked at the science and when you take care of the soil, you get long-term yields, you get higher yield in the density, nutritional density of the food.

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:38.264
So if you really do wanna feed people, you have to tend to the soil.

01:02:38.645 --> 01:02:44.287
And look, if there's large-scale production that is producing

01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:54.779
high nutrient-dense foods, I'm all for it, but those nutrient-dense foods have to actually translate to healthy people.

01:02:54.859 --> 01:02:57.962
And that's not what we have going on right now.

01:02:58.022 --> 01:03:06.950
We have commodities, massive commodities that a lot of it results in high fructose corn syrup

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:12.266
which we know doesn't nourish human bodies.

01:03:12.326 --> 01:03:17.908
We know causes all kinds of dysregulated behavior in small children.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.750
So this is not about nostalgia.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:25.492
I mean, I'm not sure how to reference this idea of nostalgia.

01:03:25.592 --> 01:03:32.294
I'm talking just strictly efficiency about if we want to invest dollars in to healthy people.

01:03:32.314 --> 01:03:33.315
She's auditioning.

01:03:34.784 --> 01:03:37.785
She is auditioning to be part of Bannon's show.

01:03:39.426 --> 01:03:43.768
And she'll get a critique afterward about where she missed, how she could say it better.

01:03:43.788 --> 01:03:47.769
I assure you that's exactly what you see happening here in real time.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:04:00.475
People, we have all the land, we have more land actually, you know, in the latest consensus of the 900 million acres that we have in the United States, we're farming only about 500 million acres of them.

01:04:00.735 --> 01:04:03.056
That number is going down year over year.

01:04:03.911 --> 01:04:14.441
And in fact, here in the state of California, where we produce half of the fruits and vegetables in this country, half of the fruits and vegetables come from the state of California.

01:04:14.801 --> 01:04:28.975
And the state of California currently has a plan to cut water down 40% to farm farmers, which means we're gonna lose 40% of the fruit and vegetable production coming from the state of California, which is responsible for half.

01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:39.411
I mean, so this is merely looking at it strictly through the lens of, you know, not flowers and bunnies and things.

01:04:39.431 --> 01:04:42.692
I'm looking at it strictly from a business lens.

01:04:44.492 --> 01:04:45.733
Hang on one second.

01:04:45.793 --> 01:04:46.573
We're going to go to break.

01:04:46.613 --> 01:04:47.533
That was a great answer.

01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:53.575
We have nostalgia for the small farmer, too, but you come out from science and from technology.

01:04:54.435 --> 01:04:58.676
Want to take a short commercial break for what will be a firestorm

01:04:59.972 --> 01:05:09.640
By Big Pharma and Big Medicine, when he comes forward to end that nomination process, I had a chance to spend a few minutes with RFK Jr.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.104
at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and we caught up with the great Tony Lyons.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.686
Nicole Shanahan was the vice president.

01:05:16.826 --> 01:05:18.087
Who's Tony Lyons?

01:05:18.127 --> 01:05:20.149
Does anybody know who Tony Lyons is?

01:05:20.189 --> 01:05:22.131
We caught up with the great Tony Lyons.

01:05:22.591 --> 01:05:30.177
Did I mention that Tony Lyons was one of the guys that was behind RFK's campaign and one of his advisors from like the very beginning?

01:05:31.198 --> 01:05:32.559
Who is Tony Lyons?

01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:35.482
Come on, somebody put it in the chat.

01:05:36.263 --> 01:05:36.883
I'm gonna wait.

01:05:37.604 --> 01:05:40.506
I'm gonna wait until you put it in the chat.

01:05:40.867 --> 01:05:41.787
Put it in the chat.

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:43.429
Who is Tony Lyons?

01:05:44.468 --> 01:05:46.329
He is a publisher, that's correct.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:47.830
Who does he work for?

01:05:48.271 --> 01:05:50.852
Who's the top guy for?

01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:54.895
He's the top guy for Sky Horse Publishing, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:56.556 --> 01:06:13.048
He's the guy, and that company's the company that published this book that has an epilogue in it where the hypothetical presidential candidate, Jesse Ventura, wins the White House by taking, as his vice president,

01:06:14.946 --> 01:06:17.607
the independent candidate of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:18.748 --> 01:06:24.511
And after they get elected, this guy gets shot, which means that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:25.391
would be president.

01:06:25.451 --> 01:06:27.012
Now, are we there?

01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:28.312
No, we're not.

01:06:30.273 --> 01:06:33.035
But it is very curious that this book exists.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:35.396
It's very curious that that narrative exists.

01:06:35.856 --> 01:06:44.140
It's very curious that Donald Trump was shot at about an hour north of my house by some kid who goes to the same high school, apparently, as my son does.

01:06:47.055 --> 01:06:52.638
It's very, very, very, very strange times we find ourselves in, ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:53.118 --> 01:06:57.780
And I think this is one of the biggest traitors to American children there is.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:09.826
He pretends to be an American patriot by dressing like the guy who does the maintenance at Cracker Barrel, and he's got three pens.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:18.204
his shirt no matter where he goes and this silly work jacket but if he needs to he can put on a three-piece suit and fix his hair.

01:07:20.205 --> 01:07:27.587
Presidential candidate running as independent on the ticket with RFK she's very focused on the agricultural department

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:37.127
I just want to frame this, first time you've been on and I want to make sure our audience is very focused on family farms and the small farmer.

01:07:38.969 --> 01:07:43.673
The current head of the USDA, this is his second term in the borough, I think it was Obama's.

01:07:44.738 --> 01:07:45.859
He's now under Biden.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:53.606
He's been the governor of Iowa, which is obviously one of the states that are the breadbasket of the country in the world.

01:07:55.347 --> 01:07:59.331
Are you saying, and he's a guy with a liberal perspective, progressive.

01:07:59.911 --> 01:08:07.919
Are you saying he's failed to make the changes that a Nicole Shanahan or the people she supports to head the USDA?

01:08:09.062 --> 01:08:11.564
would make, I mean, I think most of the audience will find that shocking.

01:08:11.644 --> 01:08:17.449
He's worked for Obama, arguably the most progressive president of modern times.

01:08:17.489 --> 01:08:18.770
He's now backed with Biden.

01:08:19.231 --> 01:08:21.613
He's had two shots in Iowa.

01:08:22.133 --> 01:08:23.514
I think people are kind of stunned.

01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:25.096
He has not helped a small farmer.

01:08:25.116 --> 01:08:30.981
He does not have the perspective you have that you think is a cornerstone of make America healthy again, ma'am.

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:41.869
Yeah, it's hard for me to categorize Tim Vilsack as either corrupt or uninformed and quite stupid.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:47.054
I think it's more of the former.

01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:51.138
Just let me move this over here.

01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:52.098
Let me grab this.

01:09:01.534 --> 01:09:02.575
And then we'll get started.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:04.577
Uh, yeah, sorry about that.

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:12.223
Um So JC on the bike was timed out.

01:09:12.403 --> 01:09:29.036
I tried to been trying to point out for several months several years now that The most dishonorable thing is misleading the young And what they've done is they've tricked us into teaching this to our children these people like that guy right there and these two

01:09:30.126 --> 01:09:31.827
and he got a job for it from him.

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:37.872
And now they stand behind Trump and do whatever they're told because that's the role they've been given.

01:09:38.553 --> 01:09:43.317
And they're happy to do it because they are auditioning for better roles in upcoming acts.

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:59.210
And I assure you, there are many years of upcoming acts yet where they will continue to mislead the young and try to separate them from us using social media and the narratives that they can put on there, control on there, even bring into existence

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:12.314
exclusively on social media you know like the Maha movement or the Maga movement or the health freedom movement which is as fake as that guy right there as fake as that guy right there

01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:21.887
This recording exists because of me.

01:10:21.907 --> 01:10:24.771
This recording exists, unfortunately, only because of me.

01:10:35.145 --> 01:10:38.546
It doesn't exist because Jessica Rose has been fighting the narrative.

01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:48.767
It doesn't exist because Matt Crawford or Nick Hudson or Jessica Hockett or the Germ Warfare podcast has been fighting the narrative.

01:10:48.867 --> 01:10:50.648
This exists because of me.

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:54.908
Capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:10:54.928 --> 01:11:03.390
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:09.593
I'll go so far as to say that Kevin McKernan is working so hard on social media for so many years mostly because of me.

01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:11.693
Otherwise he wouldn't bother.

01:11:12.514 --> 01:11:16.836
They would have moved Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey right in front from the very beginning.

01:11:17.436 --> 01:11:22.038
They would have just had Steve Kirsch and all these other monkeys just stay in their role.

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.111
But they needed these people.

01:11:25.191 --> 01:11:34.897
They tried over and over again with different groups of people to fool me into taking a side, to believing them, to getting behind them and letting them do the talking.

01:11:35.077 --> 01:11:36.778
That's the only reason why we're here.

01:11:38.039 --> 01:11:45.363
I wouldn't know to put all of these people on this graphic unless all of them hadn't meddled directly with my family.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:52.949
And I guess if this were false accusations, somebody would be suing me right now, right?

01:11:52.989 --> 01:11:55.971
That's the rationale that we always use in politics.

01:11:55.991 --> 01:11:58.313
Well, if he hasn't denied it, I guess it must be true.

01:11:58.673 --> 01:12:05.798
Well, I'm suggesting to you that some of these people are the worst traitors in recent history of the West.

01:12:07.179 --> 01:12:18.407
Like Brett Weinstein, like maybe Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, like Jessica Rose and like Robert Malone and like Kevin McKernan.

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:21.837
And like Claire Craig, I mean it when I say it.

01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:43.238
We are in danger because these people have lied in concert, and that allowed people like Wolfgang Wodach to be absorbed, like Mike Eden to be absorbed and pressured into silence, and for Peter McCullough to be pressured into walking the absolute script he's given.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:51.480
And the same with Bobby Kennedy, who unfortunately has probably been the victim of a Truman Show for years longer.

01:12:53.362 --> 01:12:54.202
than most of us.

01:12:55.063 --> 01:12:56.643
And that's what social media is.

01:12:56.703 --> 01:12:57.544
It's a Truman show.

01:12:57.584 --> 01:12:59.545
It's not a representation of reality.

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:02.046
It's not a distorted representation of reality.

01:13:02.486 --> 01:13:03.246
It's bullshit.

01:13:04.327 --> 01:13:09.489
And it's bullshit that they want you to see that these people are involved in creating.

01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:20.734
And all it requires is a few of these people to be spectacularly committed to the script they got from Malone and Fauci and McKernan.

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:34.794
So what does she have to say less than a half a day after I did a podcast called, What Is Autism Really?

01:13:35.374 --> 01:13:38.636
She made a video titled, What Is Autism Really?

01:13:39.056 --> 01:13:44.599
Let's see what this person has to say.

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.061
Harry Kennedy's comments on autism.

01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:51.061
Sorry, I'll start it again just so you can hear it.

01:13:51.082 --> 01:13:52.582
But what is autism really?

01:13:55.444 --> 01:13:59.607
A lot of people reached out to me after Secretary Kennedy's comments on autism.

01:14:00.248 --> 01:14:03.170
But what is autism really?

01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:13.418
Well, autism is classified today as a psychiatric condition under the DSM-5, which is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

01:14:13.838 --> 01:14:20.724
And the reason why that is is because of all of the evidence that we have in this book where I can't find right now.

01:14:20.764 --> 01:14:21.484
Where did I put it?

01:14:22.165 --> 01:14:23.126
Did somebody steal it?

01:14:23.586 --> 01:14:23.646
No.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.742
And this reading will only get better, right?

01:14:27.782 --> 01:14:36.104
We know that infantile autism existed before the nightmarishly nasty vaccine schedule was instituted in America.

01:14:37.565 --> 01:14:39.546
But it was described very differently.

01:14:39.626 --> 01:14:49.909
And the most striking difference was this conversion to autism, this immediate loss of language that they used to have, the loss of eye contact.

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:58.161
the shitting against the wall and the banging of their heads and the repetitive noises and screaming and staring into lights.

01:14:59.442 --> 01:15:00.723
That's not what these kids did.

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:15.598
And so the thing that Brian Hooker in 2013 would not call autism is not what she's talking about and she's right.

01:15:16.874 --> 01:15:18.275
She's absolutely right.

01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:30.019
They've taken that word and expanded it into a spectrum and then encouraged every shithead possible to come up with an additional story that fit into it.

01:15:30.539 --> 01:15:40.263
Precisely what was described in this book from 1968, where they said that there's a kind of perverse motivation for people to redefine shit.

01:15:40.643 --> 01:15:46.145
And so we gotta be very careful about how we define autism so we have a legitimate conversation about it.

01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:52.495
And we don't lose control of the investigation by just including too much noise.

01:15:54.998 --> 01:16:03.628
But of course, a malevolent state that was interested in permanently making sure that your grandchildren never understood that intramuscular injection is not medicine.

01:16:04.109 --> 01:16:06.712
Well, then I think there'd be a great way to do it.

01:16:12.099 --> 01:16:14.981
It's published by the American Psychiatric Association.

01:16:15.301 --> 01:16:23.885
The DSM-5 defines autism as persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts.

01:16:24.386 --> 01:16:31.549
Children as young as six months can receive this diagnosis, which is currently based solely on observational analysis.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.170
There's no medical test.

01:16:34.071 --> 01:16:37.633
The most common prescription... She wants a medical test.

01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:42.579
Wow.

01:16:43.279 --> 01:16:55.882
Following an autism diagnosis today is treatment through behavioral therapies, including what's called Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA, to improve the child's behavior.

01:16:56.303 --> 01:16:57.143
But here's the thing.

01:16:57.843 --> 01:17:09.426
Most children diagnosed with autism, in fact, over 70%, also have what the American Academy of Pediatrics refers to as co-occurring medical conditions.

01:17:10.266 --> 01:17:26.083
These can include gastrointestinal issues, sleep disorders, seizures or epilepsy, sensory sensitivities, developmental coordination challenges such as dyspraxia, which is commonly seen in stroke victims, and intellectual disabilities.

01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:40.483
The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, emphasizes the importance of comprehensive evaluation in identifying and managing these co-occurring conditions to ensure the best possible care for individuals with autism.

01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:41.765
Except,

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:50.612
The reality is that most children on the autism spectrum don't get the medical care they need because many are unable to communicate their needs.

01:17:51.073 --> 01:18:00.721
And most pediatricians simply aren't trained to recognize or treat the complex medical issues that often come with an autism diagnosis.

01:18:01.142 --> 01:18:04.885
Today, the autism community is dominated by behavioralists.

01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:10.889
who are frequently not equipped at all to address the underlying medical needs of these children.

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:19.254
And rather than looking deeper, the most common response is to prescribe powerful anti-psychotic medications like Respiradol and Abilify.

01:18:20.069 --> 01:18:29.711
What if many of the behaviors we see in children with autism are actually the result of untreated medical issues like dysbiosis or metabolic dysfunction?

01:18:30.151 --> 01:18:40.212
More and more physicians... Dysbiosis is a silly term for when you're out of balance with your microbiome, whatever that means.

01:18:41.733 --> 01:18:44.113
And of course, we understand what that means, right?

01:18:44.233 --> 01:18:49.314
Our immune system is our primary interactive system with our microbiome.

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:54.447
and they have been destroying it with intramuscular injection.

01:18:56.545 --> 01:19:10.712
And so it is a combination of factors, but yes, we are an irreducibly complex pattern integrity that at its basis has a symbiotic relationship between a collection of a very diverse set of bacteria.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:16.295
And we carry those around with us like a compost heap in our gut, but we don't get sick from it.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:17.215
It doesn't kill us.

01:19:17.735 --> 01:19:20.637
It's actually vital to our very existence.

01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:22.358
And they do not understand it.

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:26.151
They don't understand how that symbiosis is regulated.

01:19:26.571 --> 01:19:31.954
They don't understand how that symbiosis feeds back into the brain or feed back into the immune system.

01:19:32.354 --> 01:19:36.416
And more importantly, they never, ever, ever want your children to ponder that.

01:19:37.437 --> 01:19:44.540
They want your children to think of immunity to viruses as antibodies, and that's all they need to know about their health.

01:19:45.339 --> 01:19:55.264
They want to believe that public health is a reason, that virology is a science, and that intramuscular injection is a great methodology.

01:19:55.584 --> 01:19:58.326
That's what they want your children to believe.

01:19:58.466 --> 01:20:09.672
And they're using myths like this, like autism spectrum disorder, like gain-of-function research, to push these myths on your children.

01:20:11.005 --> 01:20:17.469
and families are stepping forward to say that autism is predominantly physiological, not psychological.

01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:28.835
And if that's true, then we need to start by addressing the body, by treating the underlying medical conditions before we attempt to modify a child's behavior.

01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:39.147
There are even groups stating that forcing these children into behavioral therapies when they are experiencing physical pain is unethical and even cruel.

01:20:39.287 --> 01:20:43.933
Now the trap here is unfortunately very malevolent because you want to care about these kids.

01:20:43.953 --> 01:20:47.477
They're showing you very compassion-inducing videos.

01:20:48.527 --> 01:21:04.322
But just like Polly Tommy in the late 90s and early 2000s was advocating for autism awareness, this woman right now is not advocating for some stop to this because she apparently doesn't really know what it is and thinks maybe if we fix our soils, it'll go away.

01:21:07.236 --> 01:21:24.850
Some recommend up to 40 hours a week of this therapy, which consists of commands an autistic child must follow to exhaustion, responses an autistic child must give correctly, even if the answers don't match the child's feelings or preferences, and the repression of movements that autistics use to regulate their own bodies.

01:21:25.731 --> 01:21:28.053
Besides this extreme regimen, the experts

01:21:28.493 --> 01:21:45.713
this is also an enchantment they have all kinds of these people on the internet now they're using these doe-eyed little girls to read things on tiktok to become lab leak correspondents this kind of crap i mean it's not by accident

01:21:46.622 --> 01:21:51.647
MothersToBe.com, this little LLC that CHD has started.

01:21:52.088 --> 01:21:53.089
That's the same thing.

01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:58.534
They're using women like this, attractive, pretty, to sell shit.

01:22:00.076 --> 01:22:02.058
To move voters.

01:22:02.859 --> 01:22:07.423
To sway people's thoughts on social media.

01:22:07.664 --> 01:22:09.626
This is an enchantment and nothing more.

01:22:11.258 --> 01:22:14.080
insists that parents use the same tactics at home.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:20.984
So parents pay a lot of money to people who don't allow autistics to experience growth and the world the autistic way.

01:22:21.045 --> 01:22:24.427
Do you think that those lines on there are real?

01:22:24.987 --> 01:22:28.369
She just happens to have freckles and red like that?

01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.872
That's how malevolent this is.

01:22:35.734 --> 01:22:36.815
They pay for abuse.

01:22:37.775 --> 01:22:39.757
So where does that leave us today?

01:22:41.343 --> 01:22:44.246
There's definitely a need for a better diagnostic.

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:52.536
I mean, the same person that produced Soph's videos before the pandemic could be producing these videos right now, and it wouldn't surprise me at all.

01:22:53.337 --> 01:22:57.001
And had we not exposed Soph, maybe Soph would have been that girl right there.

01:22:58.931 --> 01:23:13.181
approach, one that properly identifies the underlying medical needs of these children and supports parents with targeted treatments, whether it's for metabolic insufficiency, chronic gut pain, or anything in between.

01:23:14.286 --> 01:23:22.508
If you're a parent like me, you won't just give up on your child in the hope that one day they will grow to live productive and happy lives.

01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:26.169
You'll continue to believe in their capacity to heal.

01:23:26.549 --> 01:23:34.171
And that's precisely what we need from our medical providers today, a real path towards wholeness and wellness.

01:23:34.471 --> 01:23:40.272
Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting a fellow autism parent, Alex Zahirakis, a

01:23:40.638 --> 01:23:42.598
A fellow autism parent.

01:23:42.638 --> 01:23:46.359
So there she is claiming that she knows because she's got a kid.

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:47.479
And so what do you know?

01:23:48.159 --> 01:23:51.860
And that is a very, very hard trump card to combat.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:24:00.822
It is a very, very difficult spell to break, but please do not be susceptible to the fact that somebody says, I have a kid.

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:05.382
And so since I have a kid, my opinion matters more than you, because it does not.

01:24:06.443 --> 01:24:08.543
This is about grandchildren to come.

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:13.993
This is about grandchildren to come.

01:24:19.457 --> 01:24:27.343
Brilliant radiation oncology physicist who, like many of us, was drawn into this world not by profession, but by parenthood.

01:24:28.403 --> 01:24:34.528
Radiation oncology physicist means that he gives chemotherapy to cancer patients?

01:24:34.608 --> 01:24:35.628
Like seriously?

01:24:35.648 --> 01:24:36.709
Holy crap.

01:24:38.413 --> 01:24:39.213
Are we that dumb?

01:24:39.233 --> 01:24:52.978
Alex works with a small dedicated team at the nonprofit Autism is Biomedical, helping families access the kind of precision diagnostics that mainstream pediatrics has largely abandoned in favor of behavioral intervention.

01:24:53.038 --> 01:24:55.099
Precision diagnostics.

01:24:55.159 --> 01:25:01.161
We'll explain to you why your kid is messed up by looking at their genes.

01:25:01.741 --> 01:25:02.822
Oh my gosh.

01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:16.898
Because of his work, hundreds of children have seen remarkable improvements in their physical health, which has, surprise, surprise, mitigated many of their behavioral and psychiatric symptoms.

01:25:17.238 --> 01:25:23.161
It's simply addressing something as foundational as the gut can lead to such profound behavioral improvements.

01:25:23.682 --> 01:25:27.864
Imagine what might be possible with early medical intervention.

01:25:28.564 --> 01:25:31.506
It makes you really- And so it's all like, like,

01:25:34.264 --> 01:25:39.346
The mother of Colin, Paula Aitken, said that these people are frauds.

01:25:39.766 --> 01:25:46.129
They came to her house, they figured out how she cured her son's gut, and then they took that shit and ran with it.

01:25:47.049 --> 01:25:48.830
And they tried to make a lot of money on it.

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:54.492
And they tried to sell us a story about MMR and about individual vaccines.

01:25:54.532 --> 01:26:01.375
And they're still selling us that story now, only in a different, more malevolent form, where they're primarily concerned about the COVID shots.

01:26:01.435 --> 01:26:03.696
For goodness sakes, at least get those off the market.

01:26:06.721 --> 01:26:16.963
And after all these years, Brian, having never said that it's not autism again, because he agreed to help this movement, he agreed to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:17.003 --> 01:26:24.965
as close to the White House as possible and then kick some ass, I guess he's got a book, and now Mary Holland and Pauly Tommy will continue their grift.

01:26:25.365 --> 01:26:27.726
And the definition of grift is a con.

01:26:28.326 --> 01:26:29.706
It's a long con.

01:26:30.206 --> 01:26:32.547
It's where you pretend to be who you're not.

01:26:38.413 --> 01:26:40.415
And I am not pretending to be anyone.

01:26:40.615 --> 01:26:41.015
I'm not.

01:26:41.055 --> 01:26:48.101
I'm just a father and a biologist and an optics enthusiast and a pretty decent reader.

01:26:48.121 --> 01:26:50.664
I'm a kite flyer.

01:26:54.527 --> 01:26:55.568
And I figured this out.

01:26:57.984 --> 01:27:02.465
I figured this out with the help of Mark Kulak, with the help of Paula Aitken, with the help of a lot of people.

01:27:02.485 --> 01:27:04.946
And she really thinks that she's that profound?

01:27:05.246 --> 01:27:07.466
What if it's not psychological or psychiatric, but it's biomedical?

01:27:28.414 --> 01:27:29.816
Man, oh man, it's gross.

01:27:30.096 --> 01:27:31.097
It's just gross.

01:27:31.658 --> 01:27:33.259
Why is that doing that all the time?

01:27:33.339 --> 01:27:40.167
It's like... There, that's better.

01:27:40.467 --> 01:27:41.948
I don't know why it's doing that all the time.

01:27:42.129 --> 01:27:43.350
Somehow I'm not queuing it up right.

01:27:45.503 --> 01:27:46.384
Prism Kites.

01:27:46.464 --> 01:27:46.724
Wow.

01:27:46.764 --> 01:27:48.345
That's a, that's an old reference.

01:27:48.385 --> 01:27:50.306
They don't, they don't trick that well though.

01:27:50.406 --> 01:27:56.529
I mean, even the, even the Prism, Prism Spectrum or whatever the hell it was called that was supposed to be like a stunt kite.

01:27:56.569 --> 01:27:58.991
It was really, it was really wobbly.

01:27:59.031 --> 01:28:01.232
I think they only, they only designed it for the fade.

01:28:01.492 --> 01:28:03.934
You know, they didn't really see that there were all kinds.

01:28:03.954 --> 01:28:07.636
I mean, it was, it's really work to do a Jacob's Ladder, for example.

01:28:09.257 --> 01:28:14.340
The kite that I have behind me over here, just to let you know what I've got over here.

01:28:15.326 --> 01:28:25.957
That kite right there is called the Diablos and it was the original kite that was made by a kind of acquaintance of mine when I was flying in Holland for a few years.

01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:31.543
When I met my wife and met all these guys that I know and still miss and love.

01:28:32.043 --> 01:28:33.564
And it's still flying there today.

01:28:33.624 --> 01:28:34.645
That's the Diablos.

01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:35.866
That's the original design.

01:28:35.906 --> 01:28:37.647
It was actually sold to OurSky.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:40.549
But this is the actual first kite.

01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:43.931
And this kite actually won about seven or eight competitions.

01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:48.274
Not this design, but this actual sale, which is kind of kick-ass.

01:28:48.314 --> 01:28:52.977
I think a lot of people that are aware of this kite would love to have it.

01:28:53.057 --> 01:28:55.119
But it ain't, nobody gonna get it.

01:28:55.779 --> 01:28:56.620
Nobody gonna get it.

01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.320
That's my kite.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.921
And I actually don't fly it.

01:28:59.562 --> 01:29:00.962
I fly an OurSky

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:08.066
All right, sorry, an Althalia, uh, XTX, was it XTS?

01:29:08.126 --> 01:29:08.947
Yes, XTS.

01:29:08.987 --> 01:29:09.867
It's a great big white one.

01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:11.988
It's the one that Matthew Mayette flew.

01:29:12.529 --> 01:29:18.692
If you know who Matthew Mayette is, M-A-Y-E-T, if you look him up on the internet, that is the,

01:29:19.608 --> 01:29:23.029
That is the guy that I modeled all of my flying techniques after.

01:29:23.069 --> 01:29:29.071
And actually, the French turns that I do with a kite are learned from him.

01:29:30.371 --> 01:29:32.532
Anyway, wow, that's a weird sidebar.

01:29:33.312 --> 01:29:35.013
Heep, heep, heep.

01:29:35.313 --> 01:29:35.753
Here we go.

01:29:37.353 --> 01:29:38.594
So was that the end of that video?

01:29:39.094 --> 01:29:39.694
I think it was.

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:46.256
So, it's a weird place we're in right now because... Let me see if I can get this up.

01:29:48.012 --> 01:29:48.612
Does this work?

01:29:49.352 --> 01:29:50.173
Is it the whole clip?

01:29:50.753 --> 01:29:51.573
Or is it just a clip?

01:29:55.294 --> 01:29:56.054
It's the whole clip.

01:29:56.175 --> 01:29:57.075
No, it's the whole thing.

01:29:57.095 --> 01:29:58.815
I don't want to watch it now.

01:30:00.336 --> 01:30:00.656
Sorry.

01:30:02.977 --> 01:30:04.817
It's a long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:04.837 --> 01:30:06.698
It's a very long, strange trip it's been.

01:30:07.018 --> 01:30:12.460
And I'm not happy with the story that I have to tell, but I'm very confident in it.

01:30:15.902 --> 01:30:19.724
basically just the sluggishness of government in general.

01:30:20.524 --> 01:30:23.506
And in my mind, how do we

01:30:32.888 --> 01:30:37.210
use this situation to our advantage to make sure that you know.

01:30:37.371 --> 01:30:39.131
I see you still commenting in there.

01:30:39.432 --> 01:30:40.812
You seem to know what you're talking about.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:47.316
I actually originally had a whole set of Sea Devils from Lam Hoke in Canada if you know who that guy is.

01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:48.977
That's how I met everybody.

01:30:49.037 --> 01:30:58.202
I was a Sea Devil pilot and I sold all those kites many years ago and I do regret it because they were awesome and I don't know how in the hell

01:30:59.262 --> 01:31:01.945
I know why, because I have other kites and I like them better.

01:31:02.005 --> 01:31:05.670
I got a German kite called a TNT that is just the bomb.

01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:06.551
Oh my gosh.

01:31:06.851 --> 01:31:18.184
People are getting... I think there's a genuine call for justice to be called for, especially if there was

01:31:19.346 --> 01:31:39.155
you know, there was a moratorium in place that caused Fauci's department to have the... Okay, so in March of 2020, an associate of George Webb, who was on 60 Minutes in February of 2020, and meddling with Mark Kulak for years,

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:50.544
This guy is interviewing a dude by the name of Kevin McCairn, who supposedly is a neuroscientist at Kyoto University, but stop lying.

01:31:51.224 --> 01:31:53.745
And they're talking about.

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:58.022
Maybe Fauci is covering up something that they did.

01:31:58.363 --> 01:32:17.818
And very specifically, he's going to say that they gave money to EcoHealth Alliance to do the job somewhere else, which is a narrative, of course, we know that Kevin McKernan is now telling everywhere he goes on the Steve Kirsch podcast, on the Danny Jones podcast, and probably very soon on the Joe Rogan podcast.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.001
Research offshore.

01:32:21.618 --> 01:32:27.680
OK, so I mean, I have to I have to presume that somewhere because we don't know what those papers look like.

01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:36.282
Prior to that, and this was the Obama administration that did this, and there's a lot there's a strong argument for.

01:32:36.302 --> 01:32:40.044
Oh, I've got to wait.

01:32:42.625 --> 01:32:44.486
He lost control of his script.

01:32:44.706 --> 01:32:44.966
Oops.

01:32:45.667 --> 01:32:46.507
I got to get caught up.

01:32:47.027 --> 01:32:48.468
Wait, I ran out.

01:32:48.748 --> 01:32:52.490
Listen to that very carefully because that's not, that's, that's real.

01:32:53.391 --> 01:32:54.091
He's reading.

01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:54.611
Yeah.

01:32:55.012 --> 01:32:59.974
So, uh, I have to presume that somebody whoops, watch, watch.

01:33:02.956 --> 01:33:03.296
Sorry.

01:33:06.678 --> 01:33:06.858
The.

01:33:08.685 --> 01:33:15.471
Uh, basically just, Oh, I've got, uh, I wait, um, keep going.

01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:16.411
Prior to that.

01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:18.553
And this was the Obama administration that did this.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:24.918
And there's a lot, there's a strong argument for, Oh, I've got, uh, I wait.

01:33:29.922 --> 01:33:33.785
They're scripted ladies and gentlemen, maybe even in real time.

01:33:36.721 --> 01:33:39.123
Maybe they have a chat coaching them.

01:33:41.225 --> 01:34:03.005
But something is happening and it was happening already in the beginning because remember, this guy spent the next five years messing with my family, slandering me on the internet for five years, doing performances with Mark Bailey after a year of taunting his wife as a whore.

01:34:04.867 --> 01:34:07.048
Mark Bailey did a stream with that guy.

01:34:08.128 --> 01:34:33.559
And after five years, he's done streams with Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project, plugged Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project, and Kevin McKernan has promoted Charles Rixey, a guy who was actually in Japan streaming with this man for a couple years, and also part of the people saying I'm a bad guy, pretending that I got him fired at CHD.

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:43.780
when there are people with real names in this book on this page that know that that's an absolute, absolute lie.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:58.367
And it's every one of the names in this first paragraph of the book knows that Charles Rixey was hired at the same time as me and knows that he was fired and probably knows exactly why he was fired.

01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:06.854
And there are at least three names on here that I have the phone numbers to these people that know that that's a lie.

01:35:07.674 --> 01:35:11.116
Charles Rixey did not help write this book.

01:35:11.656 --> 01:35:13.597
He was trying to sabotage it.

01:35:16.738 --> 01:35:20.420
More importantly, sabotage my role in it, monitor my role in it.

01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:25.883
They tried to absorb me by getting me to feel like I was part of the team.

01:35:27.116 --> 01:35:29.117
And Rixey was part of that operation.

01:35:29.177 --> 01:35:32.439
This jackass was part of that operation, and I saw through it.

01:35:32.899 --> 01:35:34.660
I didn't know what I was seeing through.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:41.144
Because it never made sense to me that so many people inside of CHD could be part of a theater like that, but they were.

01:35:42.465 --> 01:35:47.468
And that's why none of those people are available to tell you, oh yeah, Kevin McKernan is definitely lying.

01:35:49.468 --> 01:35:55.011
because I'm sure after they left CHD in October of 2024, they also signed an NDA.

01:35:55.612 --> 01:35:59.814
And so they can't help me and my family anymore, but I didn't sign an NDA.

01:36:00.174 --> 01:36:06.538
So I'll tell you right now, I told them the truth before this book was published and Bobby said it wasn't for this book.

01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:18.766
So this guy's on a script and it's a script that was given to him by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and all these other clowns that are behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:20.512 --> 01:36:25.575
All these people that have been whispering in his ear about what the right thing to say is and not, don't listen to Jonathan Cooey.

01:36:25.595 --> 01:36:26.796
That's what this is.

01:36:27.716 --> 01:36:29.778
I'm not saying that RFK can be saved.

01:36:30.018 --> 01:36:31.179
I assure you he cannot.

01:36:31.339 --> 01:36:32.439
He wants that role.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:33.940
He's gotten the role.

01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:36.962
They were planning that role with who?

01:36:37.402 --> 01:36:44.487
With Tony Lyons since at least 2008 when they publicly admitted it in a book authored by Jesse Ventura.

01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:54.230
Keep going.

01:36:55.290 --> 01:36:57.471
So I have to presume that somewhere that.

01:37:04.312 --> 01:37:08.273
Ralph Baric is a guy who arguably taught with how to create the coronavirus.

01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:09.233
Who?

01:37:09.693 --> 01:37:11.173
Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:37:11.373 --> 01:37:16.474
Oh, so there is their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of echo health into the wave.

01:37:16.654 --> 01:37:20.795
And so what I'm suggesting to you is, is that the national security state

01:37:22.639 --> 01:37:50.482
for whom a national security priority is to get everyone in America to accept intramuscular injection as a valid methodology and transfection as a valid medicine, have decided to lie to us about a pandemic and lie to us about the biology of RNA and to lie to us about the biology of our immune system so that we would never figure out that intramuscular injection is not medicine.

01:37:51.178 --> 01:37:52.178
in any context.

01:37:52.799 --> 01:37:55.380
And it's the worst way to augment a healthy human.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:03.023
Transfection is actually an highly advanced, more malevolent way of harming a human with intramuscular injection.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:19.351
And this guy, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project that says that Charles Rixey is a hero, is essentially also saying that Kevin McCarran is a hero, even though we know we have hours and hours of video of him dedicating hours and hours of his time

01:38:20.071 --> 01:38:24.232
to messing with my family for five years.

01:38:24.712 --> 01:38:30.174
And Charles Rixey and Kevin McCarran both came to my house in Pittsburgh.

01:38:34.495 --> 01:38:39.456
And why would somebody do that after all the things that Kevin McCarran did to me on the internet?

01:38:39.477 --> 01:38:44.278
Why would he dare come to Pittsburgh and want to meet me at my house, to stay at my house?

01:38:44.338 --> 01:38:47.959
And why would he instead even insist that we meet at a bar?

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.982
If you don't wanna meet me at your house, at least meet me at the bar.

01:38:52.162 --> 01:38:56.725
I bought him a hotel so he wouldn't come to my house and I didn't have to give him my address.

01:38:58.366 --> 01:39:06.552
Why would he come when he knew already in November of 2022 that I had been openly declaring him a liar?

01:39:08.253 --> 01:39:15.778
He came because it was a last ditch effort because nobody that was doing what he would do would come and show up unless he really wasn't doing it, right?

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.911
We'll talk behind the scenes and everything will be fine.

01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:21.791
And we didn't talk about anything to do with COVID at all.

01:39:23.472 --> 01:39:24.712
He was scared shitless.

01:39:26.392 --> 01:39:29.073
Scared of the people in the bar, scared of sitting with me.

01:39:31.954 --> 01:39:35.915
And then he went right on to performing the role that they wanted him to perform.

01:39:36.635 --> 01:39:42.796
That Steve Kirsch actually offered to send me to Japan to do the experiments on the mice with him.

01:39:43.676 --> 01:39:46.057
And I have the text messages to prove it, Steve.

01:39:47.574 --> 01:39:52.617
I might even have a voicemail message from you about that, which is really unfortunate for you.

01:39:55.159 --> 01:40:00.923
And so Kevin McKernan was essentially forced to become this public.

01:40:01.783 --> 01:40:12.531
He could have just been behind the scenes telling everybody the right way to describe the DNA contamination and the script to follow over the last five years, but he had to step up because actually,

01:40:14.222 --> 01:40:18.325
There's nobody else who can actually stick to the script besides him and Robert Malone.

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.505
It's too over the top.

01:40:19.605 --> 01:40:21.967
It's too over the head of Jessica Rose.

01:40:22.007 --> 01:40:24.808
In fact, if she understood it, she might not have the guts to do it.

01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:31.812
If some of these people understood what they were up to and how many lies they were propagating, they might not have the guts to do it.

01:40:33.553 --> 01:40:40.036
I don't think John Bodwin knows how awful a liar this is from a biological perspective.

01:40:40.076 --> 01:40:42.558
Otherwise, he wouldn't have the gall to do what he's doing.

01:40:43.444 --> 01:40:46.666
to stand behind these traitors to our grandchildren.

01:40:49.848 --> 01:40:54.310
I mean, this guy's worth millions of dollars, so he can afford a lawyer if this is bullshit.

01:40:56.311 --> 01:40:57.232
It's not bullshit.

01:40:57.572 --> 01:40:58.172
He's lying.

01:40:59.413 --> 01:41:05.656
He's lying about the fact that this RNA can be found, it can be sequenced, and it can be put in cells and recapitulate disease.

01:41:08.218 --> 01:41:10.019
He chose those words like a lawyer did.

01:41:12.779 --> 01:41:30.251
And he chose these words like an idiot, like a guy on a script, a script that was already planned out years ago when a shoe salesman turned Excel sheet user became the co-host of Kevin McCarron's podcast for a year.

01:41:32.232 --> 01:41:34.934
And they focused most of their energy on me.

01:41:36.542 --> 01:41:38.423
Not on the biology, just me.

01:41:38.543 --> 01:41:45.126
And you know, it's a bioweapon and it's the spike protein and it's the most contagious virus ever.

01:41:49.588 --> 01:41:52.569
They put a gain of function ban on funding here in the States.

01:41:52.649 --> 01:41:53.290
Obama did that, right?

01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.870
Obama did that.

01:41:53.930 --> 01:42:00.633
And so what- Funny that Obama did that was also something that they said with Addy Adds and Kevin McCarron.

01:42:00.653 --> 01:42:02.874
It's all the same beats five years later.

01:42:07.543 --> 01:42:12.173
Maybe they were gonna have Kevin McCarren do it all along, but because of me, they're having this guy do it.

01:42:12.754 --> 01:42:13.095
I don't know.

01:42:13.676 --> 01:42:14.117
Could be.

01:42:14.638 --> 01:42:16.983
Because we are seriously kicking their ass right now.

01:42:18.183 --> 01:42:23.006
It's just that nobody can see it because social media is a military social control platform.

01:42:23.046 --> 01:42:28.029
It's not a spontaneous algorithm where good ideas rise to the top.

01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:38.776
Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:42:38.816 --> 01:42:40.937
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

01:42:40.957 --> 01:42:42.278
It's going through some intermediary.

01:42:43.179 --> 01:42:44.900
And through that process, they taught

01:42:46.681 --> 01:42:55.029
the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-see-um technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

01:42:55.650 --> 01:43:04.859
And so then he's going to mention a commercial process called Golden Gate Assembly, which then actually admits that the no-see-um technique is actually bullshit.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.483
It's just standard molecular biology.

01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:15.736
And whenever you make a biologic, you try to have the sequence be the sequence that you want.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:19.760
And there is a whole suite of restriction enzymes that make that possible.

01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:26.666
There's a whole industry based on selling those restriction enzymes to all of the labs in the world.

01:43:27.381 --> 01:43:34.288
There's a whole industry selling plasmids with SV40 as a site of origin all around the world.

01:43:34.909 --> 01:43:40.895
And yet this guy is telling you a story that the SV40 that we're finding in the world is exclusively from Pfizer.

01:43:42.156 --> 01:43:49.604
When in reality, there's SV40 at every major university on earth because molecular biologists use it in their experiments all the time.

01:43:52.847 --> 01:43:58.013
And so they could also have SB40 in their gut just because they didn't wear gloves all the time or they inhaled it.

01:43:59.154 --> 01:44:00.495
It might not be hurting them at all.

01:44:00.515 --> 01:44:03.198
It might be detectable by PCR, but who gives a shit?

01:44:04.299 --> 01:44:13.950
Unless you're trying to tell a mythological story about the origin of cancer and Mary's monkey, which is of course what they're doing.

01:44:16.496 --> 01:44:33.603
because they're telling you a detailed, ridiculous mythology to hide the fact that intramuscular injection is not a valid methodology in medicine, that virology is not a valid science in molecular biology, and most importantly, public health is never a valid reason.

01:44:36.251 --> 01:44:44.576
It's a it's a ligation technique that that uses a golden gate assembly That is it's it's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it.

01:44:45.096 --> 01:45:01.325
That's just bullshit And that's all they've ever had is these guys This is the evidence this is like a week ago He's still busy with this nonsense that I'm gonna be a a Netflix original special seriously

01:45:04.403 --> 01:45:18.097
This guy is only relevant as a landmark because he essentially condemns Steve Kirsch, Robert Malone, Jessica Rose, Meryl Nass.

01:45:18.177 --> 01:45:22.262
He condemns Kevin McKernan as an obvious traitor.

01:45:23.223 --> 01:45:36.980
There's no other way that this guy is being allowed and promoted on Steve Kirsch's Vaccine Research Safety Council unless this is just all part of one script.

01:45:38.863 --> 01:45:48.508
One script where they would say Barrick is the bad guy, he taught them how to make it, that they would say that it's a no-see-um technology, so obviously it was Barrick.

01:45:48.828 --> 01:46:02.054
They would say that Rick C. was the diffuse proposal guy and helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and McCairn exposed the spike protein as being amyloidogenic, and these people came to my frickin' house.

01:46:05.537 --> 01:46:08.961
The diffuse proposal had no evaluation.

01:46:09.041 --> 01:46:11.603
So the DoD didn't say, oh my gosh, you can't do that.

01:46:11.643 --> 01:46:12.464
That's dangerous.

01:46:12.945 --> 01:46:15.768
There were no predicted leaks, even though that's what he says.

01:46:16.128 --> 01:46:21.734
The diffuse proposal as being done is actually one of the six quotes that are in here for me.

01:46:22.114 --> 01:46:24.857
It's probably the reason why they put me in the book.

01:46:25.257 --> 01:46:30.999
And now here he is repeating it and promoting Rixie and pretending like I never existed.

01:46:31.039 --> 01:46:38.682
This whole argument that he makes about the spike protein in the virus is based on you accepting that sequence base for base.

01:46:39.263 --> 01:46:43.764
There can be no errors in it, otherwise the furin cleavage site might not be as cool as it is.

01:46:44.205 --> 01:46:49.327
The Staphylococcus enterotoxin B overlap might not be as cool as it is.

01:46:49.367 --> 01:46:54.689
The HIV inserts wouldn't be HIV inserts anymore unless you accept the exact sequence

01:46:55.089 --> 01:46:56.690
that he says you have to accept.

01:46:56.710 --> 01:47:02.675
And that exact sequence is what James Lyons Weiler was crying about.

01:47:04.207 --> 01:47:13.090
Also in February of 2020, as early as Kevin McCairn was streaming with Paul Cottrell and these other meddlers from the George Webb team.

01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:14.351
It's all one team.

01:47:14.831 --> 01:47:17.172
That's why George Webb was on 60 Minutes.

01:47:17.572 --> 01:47:25.895
That's why fricking Robert Malone gave a link to that 60 Minutes in his sub stack because it's all one orchestrated show.

01:47:26.315 --> 01:47:30.877
That's also what Whitney Webb is with her Man in Wuhan article.

01:47:31.537 --> 01:47:35.219
and Robert Malone plugging Whitney Webb as being a good source.

01:47:35.279 --> 01:47:37.360
Whitney Webb is on Robert Malone's team.

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:41.662
That's why she showed up at the inaugural CHD conference along with all of them.

01:47:43.602 --> 01:47:44.783
They were all there.

01:47:46.365 --> 01:47:50.429
And the same thing that they did to me, they do to Mary Tyler Bowden.

01:47:50.469 --> 01:48:00.618
And the way they do it is that what you don't understand, if you're not savvy with how podcast enchantment works, is that two or more of the people on the podcast are lying in concert.

01:48:00.778 --> 01:48:04.762
And more importantly, pretending to be opposite each other.

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:22.063
You know, if you got into a car with three people as a hitchhiker and they wanted to murder you, the way that they would do it, the best way that they would do it is the person in the back seat would pretend to tell you something about the people in the front seat that they're lying to you.

01:48:23.023 --> 01:48:26.864
And so, you know, we've got to work together against them.

01:48:26.964 --> 01:48:27.984
I'm also kidnapped.

01:48:28.024 --> 01:48:34.945
And then when you get out at the truck stop, you follow that girl over to the back of the back of the place and then she shoots you.

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:38.630
And all the while you thought, wow, she's saving me.

01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:40.030
She's taking care of me.

01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:44.552
And in this podcast, I can guarantee you, this schmo doesn't know what's going on.

01:48:45.272 --> 01:48:50.214
He's just gotta, in case we get off target, make sure you get us on this list and he's happy to do it.

01:48:50.754 --> 01:48:56.416
She doesn't know what's going on because what's happening is Dr., Dr., what is his name?

01:48:56.496 --> 01:48:58.256
Crose, Crouse, Cray?

01:48:59.797 --> 01:49:02.678
This guy and this guy are pretending to fight.

01:49:05.034 --> 01:49:06.815
and pretending to oppose each other.

01:49:07.335 --> 01:49:13.237
And what that action does is it makes her believe the assumptions that are underneath it.

01:49:14.597 --> 01:49:29.322
And they tried to do that with me over and over and over again, with Zoom meeting group after Zoom meeting group, from the Signal Chat with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson and Matt Crawford and Alexandros Marinos and Heather Haying.

01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:36.714
to the Steve Kerr steering committee, to the book writing committee of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:49:36.674 --> 01:49:38.515
's book, Wuhan Cover-Up.

01:49:38.595 --> 01:49:54.208
They were all intelligence operations of some kind or another trying to get me to give up what I knew, and more importantly, to put me back on their narrative, or to put people in front of me who would keep everybody else on narrative on social media.

01:49:55.629 --> 01:50:03.554
And so it feels like I'm fighting the empire when I'm on social media with all my snarky tweets until I realize that no one else can see them.

01:50:07.756 --> 01:50:08.797
They see Jack.

01:50:10.698 --> 01:50:11.579
They see Callie.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.141
They even see Mary because Mary has been bamboozled.

01:50:19.263 --> 01:50:20.264
She's been bamboozled.

01:50:22.835 --> 01:50:28.700
is to reseat experts that have been wrongly persecuted.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.823
The reason I came here is to tell people the whole story.

01:50:33.123 --> 01:50:35.825
I never imagined that what happened to me would happen.

01:50:36.145 --> 01:50:38.767
They targeted me to set an example.

01:50:38.967 --> 01:50:46.913
We can't put the military complex and bioweapons and testing and big pharma in front of the American family anymore.

01:50:47.013 --> 01:50:47.913
I'm tired of it.

01:50:48.013 --> 01:50:48.674
I'm sick of it.

01:50:48.854 --> 01:50:52.115
It also happens in medical school training.

01:50:52.175 --> 01:50:54.296
So it enforces compliance.

01:50:54.856 --> 01:50:57.217
You become part of the apparatchik.

01:50:57.337 --> 01:51:02.919
I'm proud to sit at a table with two other physicians that get it.

01:51:03.799 --> 01:51:05.620
Two other physicians that get it.

01:51:06.598 --> 01:51:27.588
And what in reality is happening again is that Mary Talley Bowden is made a useful idiot because he and Andrew Wakefield both know that Andrew Wakefield is a bullshit artist intelligence agent from the UK who's been working the same shtick over here with Polly Tommy and Children's Health Defense and it's made him rich.

01:51:28.528 --> 01:51:29.729
And he wants in on it too.

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:38.687
He wants to be part of this fake health freedom movement that's making people rich by social media exposure and donations from monkeys.

01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:42.570
They're totally fine with that.

01:51:45.373 --> 01:51:48.415
I guess it's possible that he could just be naive, but it's not.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:53.420
And not what I heard in that podcast with Mary Talley Bowden.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.183
And so I suspect we'll hear the same thing here if we were to allow it to play.

01:51:58.871 --> 01:52:03.835
I'm Nicole Shanahan, and welcome to the Council of the Canceled, where free speech prevails.

01:52:04.235 --> 01:52:07.858
Today, we bring together a group of prominent experts who share one thing in common.

01:52:08.198 --> 01:52:13.782
Their work has been censored and their integrity questioned, all because their findings challenge the status quo.

01:52:14.223 --> 01:52:22.169
Together, we can shed new light on their perspectives and learn from their insights, no matter how inconvenient they may be to those who wish to silence their voices.

01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:24.831
Well, hi, everybody.

01:52:24.891 --> 01:52:28.616
Thanks for joining us for the second Council of the Canceled.

01:52:28.736 --> 01:52:34.583
We're here in Dallas, Texas today with three of my favorite people in the whole wide world.

01:52:34.603 --> 01:52:38.668
And I just want to remind everyone why we're doing these.

01:52:39.744 --> 01:52:46.049
There are so many wrongly canceled experts across the United States and across the world right now.

01:52:46.749 --> 01:52:58.698
And these are qualified experts, predominantly in the medical field, that have been turned into heretics by our government because they are speaking truths.

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:03.702
They are speaking certain truths that cause us to bring into question

01:53:04.302 --> 01:53:10.889
the public health narratives that are fed to us every single day in every channel you can imagine.

01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:21.481
Across our personal lives, we hear them at the dinner table, the media's feeding us these narratives, our school systems, our workplaces.

01:53:22.021 --> 01:53:25.045
It's penetrated every aspect of life.

01:53:26.546 --> 01:53:37.030
And there are very, very few doctors out there that are brave enough to look at their patient population and see that the narratives are wrong.

01:53:37.571 --> 01:53:40.372
And so we're here today with three of the best.

01:53:41.012 --> 01:53:50.836
And the goal of the council is to reseat experts that have been wrongly persecuted.

01:53:51.556 --> 01:53:54.237
And it's really important, I think, to hear these stories.

01:53:56.118 --> 01:53:58.359
These are not radical ideas.

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:04.003
This is how science works.

01:54:04.063 --> 01:54:05.324
It's how it's always worked.

01:54:05.804 --> 01:54:11.928
It is designed to be empirical at first, and then further investigated.

01:54:12.588 --> 01:54:16.311
And without that debate and investigation, we can't evolve as a society.

01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:17.271
And so

01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:21.214
Here we are in the second council.

01:54:21.234 --> 01:54:26.477
And the goal is to think about medicine differently.

01:54:26.497 --> 01:54:46.571
And one way to do that is to decentralize it, to turn it into a decentralized, multinodal aggregation of experts that can come together, reach across different practices, and have a open debate and open forum on how to progress the field of science.

01:54:47.652 --> 01:54:53.174
So thank you so much Dr. Wakefield, Dr. Cruz, and Dr. Bowden for joining me today.

01:54:53.194 --> 01:54:58.636
I'm going to start with introducing Dr. Wakefield, Andy.

01:54:59.657 --> 01:55:08.180
Your name is one of the biggest names in autism and it is the name that has been

01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:23.601
tied to don't you dare ever criticize vaccines for autism, because if you do, you will be disgraced for the remainder of your lifetime.

01:55:23.641 --> 01:55:24.402
That's the goal.

01:55:24.462 --> 01:55:25.363
That's the narrative.

01:55:25.723 --> 01:55:33.811
That's what I was told as a mother of a child diagnosed with autism, that if I dare look at the MMR vaccine,

01:55:34.429 --> 01:55:38.155
I will be treated as Andy Wakefield was treated.

01:55:38.175 --> 01:55:39.496
I will be denounced.

01:55:39.997 --> 01:55:40.959
I'll be criticized.

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:42.200
I'll be told I'm crazy.

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:47.248
I'll be labeled an anti-vaxxer and a dangerous person.

01:55:48.973 --> 01:56:02.564
It's been nearly 30 years since you published the Lancet article showing gut inflammation in a patient population that had come to you when you were working.

01:56:02.584 --> 01:56:15.394
And so recycling that narrative from the UK to the United States started with Tony Lyons and Skyhorse Publishing publishing Andrew Wakefield's books.

01:56:17.517 --> 01:56:20.559
and also the Jesse Ventura book where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:56:20.579 --> 01:56:23.241
would run as an independent and then join up with somebody who would win.

01:56:23.261 --> 01:56:27.343
And then that person would get shot, then Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:56:27.363 --> 01:56:29.385
would save the United States, I guess.

01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:32.647
So, yeah.

01:56:32.767 --> 01:56:36.550
As a surgeon and a doctor in London.

01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:45.216
And sitting next to you, I have to say, I never thought I would be here.

01:56:45.970 --> 01:56:57.372
today with you because the stories are so forbidden and giving them any credibility has not been allowed.

01:56:58.352 --> 01:56:59.992
But we live in a different world now.

01:57:00.833 --> 01:57:02.713
I believe it's time for you to be reseated.

01:57:02.733 --> 01:57:04.173
Thank you.

01:57:04.733 --> 01:57:05.613
Appreciate that.

01:57:06.433 --> 01:57:07.974
I'd just love to hear from you.

01:57:08.334 --> 01:57:09.654
It's been almost 30 years.

01:57:10.934 --> 01:57:12.034
She really is going to cry.

01:57:12.114 --> 01:57:15.315
It's been almost 30 years and you people haven't accomplished shit.

01:57:16.374 --> 01:57:27.877
It's been almost 30 years and this sabotage is still going on where the messaging hasn't progressed beyond health freedom, beyond rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

01:57:27.917 --> 01:57:36.178
They haven't made one iota of progress in explaining, you know, prioritizing the poisoning of our children and ending it.

01:57:36.378 --> 01:57:38.579
They haven't made any progress.

01:57:39.659 --> 01:57:40.279
It's been 30 years.

01:57:48.505 --> 01:57:51.566
And before we went live, you said, we're winning.

01:57:53.647 --> 01:57:54.387
How are we winning?

01:57:55.568 --> 01:58:00.169
OK, well, firstly, I was an entirely mainstream, whatever that means.

01:58:00.469 --> 01:58:06.751
I was a mainstream gastroenterologist, an academic working at the Royal Free Hospital in the University of London.

01:58:06.771 --> 01:58:11.193
I had a big research team looking at- We could do this, but I'm not going to.

01:58:12.213 --> 01:58:13.234
It's been a circus.

01:58:14.694 --> 01:58:17.115
And basically- Government.

01:58:17.867 --> 01:58:19.688
and people, the biggest nuclear.

01:58:19.989 --> 01:58:30.376
I view you as a polymath in human biochemistry and probably one of the most outspoken in the world of biochemistry and electrochemistry.

01:58:31.677 --> 01:58:39.382
And I would love to hear your take on what's going on.

01:58:40.234 --> 01:58:47.356
Andy was canceled because he challenged the global world order of the industrial military complex.

01:58:48.336 --> 01:58:50.037
Big Pharma sits.

01:58:50.717 --> 01:58:52.178
So what's the global order?

01:58:52.298 --> 01:58:53.178
What does that mean?

01:58:53.318 --> 01:58:56.899
Does he is going to tell us that that intramuscular injection is a myth?

01:58:57.399 --> 01:58:59.340
It's a it's a it's a crime.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.601
And so they have to make up this huge apparatus that controls a narrative that justifies it.

01:59:04.621 --> 01:59:05.802
Are they is he going to do that?

01:59:05.982 --> 01:59:07.282
Of course not.

01:59:08.403 --> 01:59:09.523
Of course not.

01:59:10.336 --> 01:59:12.118
The people in power are powerful.

01:59:12.479 --> 01:59:14.040
The people in power are bad.

01:59:14.401 --> 01:59:18.506
The people in power are powerful, and we should be sure that we know that they have power.

01:59:18.946 --> 01:59:20.388
And I just want to fight the power.

01:59:20.768 --> 01:59:23.772
At the right hand, what we call the Cantillion effect.

01:59:24.713 --> 01:59:30.220
The reason why they're important and the reason why they're given this spot is

01:59:32.102 --> 01:59:37.446
The Department of Defense was the distributor of this pharmaceutical.

01:59:37.947 --> 01:59:38.647
That's COVID.

01:59:39.348 --> 01:59:40.449
So let's get it straight.

01:59:40.929 --> 01:59:45.072
Big Pharma was the drug dealers for the government.

01:59:45.773 --> 01:59:46.033
Okay?

01:59:46.654 --> 01:59:47.735
And here's the key point.

01:59:48.615 --> 01:59:55.281
The key point is the government... And this is a good point that Mark Kulak makes a lot.

01:59:55.401 --> 01:59:56.542
It's not about boats.

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:57.843
It's not about yachts.

01:59:58.023 --> 01:59:59.404
It's not about bonuses.

01:59:59.524 --> 02:00:00.505
It's not about money.

02:00:01.519 --> 02:00:12.187
It is about teaching your children a myth about public health as a reason, about virology as a science, about intramuscular injection as a methodology.

02:00:12.307 --> 02:00:14.608
And if you do that, your children will be enslaved.

02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:17.490
That's what this is about.

02:00:18.031 --> 02:00:19.372
And if this guy is so

02:00:20.686 --> 02:00:24.892
incompetent not to understand that, then maybe he is unwittingly involved.

02:00:24.912 --> 02:00:32.422
But I think this guy's been given a script and he's happy to read it because he knows it's gonna get him on, you know, he's gonna get a lot of Bitcoin or some shit.

02:00:33.882 --> 02:00:34.882
they're doing to Mary.

02:00:35.563 --> 02:00:36.723
Andy is a global problem.

02:00:36.783 --> 02:00:38.544
She's a state and local problem.

02:00:39.445 --> 02:00:43.406
What you need to understand is the way this Cantillian effect works.

02:00:44.507 --> 02:00:55.452
When you understand the history pre-Andy, when you understand what happened with the Bayh-Dolak, when you understand what happened with the vaccine law, when you understand that Reagan put Fauci in,

02:00:56.112 --> 02:01:03.578
when you understand that the government was learning how to deal with big piles of money in collections.

02:01:04.378 --> 02:01:05.760
So it's about murder.

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:08.582
It's not about murder for him, right?

02:01:08.622 --> 02:01:10.383
He's going to say it's murder the wrong way.

02:01:10.423 --> 02:01:13.486
He's not going to say it's the population pyramid and the managing of it.

02:01:14.526 --> 02:01:20.131
He's not going to say it's the conversion of sovereign people to experimental animal status.

02:01:20.171 --> 02:01:24.154
He's not going to say that they're getting you to teach your kids bullshit.

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:30.181
He's going to tell you that the bad guys are bad and they're very powerful and they have very bad plans.

02:01:31.022 --> 02:01:33.783
They began to realize that they can control the narrative.

02:01:33.963 --> 02:01:38.426
That began all the way back in the 40s and 50s with General Groves.

02:01:38.942 --> 02:01:45.848
Yes, controlling the narrative, controlling the narrative, controlling the narrative, but he's not telling you the truth about that.

02:01:46.408 --> 02:01:49.030
The truth would be the Manhattan Project.

02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:54.075
The truth would be using x-rays to mutate things and accelerate evolution.

02:01:54.135 --> 02:01:55.616
The truth would be talking about

02:01:56.136 --> 02:02:04.419
the future, a man and his future, and what Huxley and Lederberg and Muller wrote about in that conference.

02:02:04.479 --> 02:02:15.802
It would be talking about the real plan to take over the evolution of the species and where the Human Genome Project is in terms of this, quote unquote, completion.

02:02:16.482 --> 02:02:22.664
But he's not going to tell you any of that, even though he's like a polymath in chemistry and molecular biology and stuff.

02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:28.612
when they didn't want the media in war, in theater, because they found it was bad for business.

02:02:29.032 --> 02:02:31.013
So what did they do in the 60s and 70s?

02:02:31.493 --> 02:02:37.514
Through several programs, you know, that Bobby's talked about extensively, they realized that they could co-opt the media.

02:02:38.175 --> 02:02:42.516
So they've done it in different ways through different programs.

02:02:43.936 --> 02:02:45.476
They co-opted science.

02:02:45.556 --> 02:02:47.137
They co-opted biology.

02:02:47.557 --> 02:02:52.558
They took a bunch of physicists from the Manhattan Project and made them into geneticists.

02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:56.831
That's what this book is all about.

02:02:57.552 --> 02:03:02.235
That physics and chemistry can explain life, and so it's up to physicists to figure it out.

02:03:03.176 --> 02:03:06.498
And once the Manhattan Project was over, those guys didn't have shit to do.

02:03:07.319 --> 02:03:12.762
And they still wanted to discover stuff, but there's nothing to discover in physics, so they all went into genetics.

02:03:15.705 --> 02:03:16.965
This is the hard truth.

02:03:19.107 --> 02:03:20.368
They took over science.

02:03:21.493 --> 02:03:36.240
They took over the myths of biology and made it center around determinism and this concept of a gene before they had any idea of what would need to be encoded in order to have a trajectory across time.

02:03:37.261 --> 02:03:38.101
They don't care.

02:03:43.324 --> 02:03:45.045
The government, but what they do with science.

02:03:45.930 --> 02:04:01.145
What they did with science is they basically came up with a plan to use Big Pharma to allow them to pay media companies so that the media companies can be used as propaganda arms for mandates that the government want to go through.

02:04:02.045 --> 02:04:07.732
Now the key in this whole process, your question, was why do they want to do that?

02:04:07.932 --> 02:04:14.020
That is probably the biggest nuclear question because I think that goes to the heart of the matter.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:20.488
The heart of the matter is that this fundamentally started out as a bioweapons program.

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:25.679
Hey, Phila, if you're listening to the show, can you bring me the book that's at the bed?

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:32.386
The Phages and Molecular Biology book, only if you're listening, or if Keir is listening, he could bring it.

02:04:33.167 --> 02:04:37.151
I started all the way back with the polio vaccine.

02:04:37.532 --> 02:04:38.973
And that's a story that begins in 1951.

02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:43.032
So I think this is blowing everybody's mind.

02:04:43.412 --> 02:04:44.554
Oh, blowing my mind.

02:04:44.634 --> 02:04:46.556
It's just blowing my mind.

02:04:46.616 --> 02:04:47.617
It's blowing my mind.

02:04:47.637 --> 02:04:48.559
It's blowing my mind.

02:04:48.619 --> 02:04:49.380
I can't believe it.

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:57.110
And I want to get there because when people hear, well, you know, maybe Andy was

02:04:58.291 --> 02:05:06.558
attacked for his Lancet study because they didn't want people questioning the safety of vaccines because vaccines help more people than they hurt.

02:05:07.098 --> 02:05:11.222
So just to respond to Mark in the chat, it's almost two o'clock.

02:05:11.282 --> 02:05:12.463
I should probably cut it short.

02:05:12.483 --> 02:05:18.447
I wanted to show you that I'm reading this book called Phages and the Origin of Molecular Biology.

02:05:18.487 --> 02:05:24.853
And Mark said that Leo Slazard, who first thought of a nuke, founded the Salk Institute and

02:05:25.453 --> 02:05:28.716
This is the book that I'm reading with my kids when we have reading time.

02:05:29.436 --> 02:05:32.859
And I just wanted to show you that Mark's not crazy.

02:05:32.879 --> 02:05:36.482
I gotta go back a little ways because I'm pretty far ahead now in this book.

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:38.424
I can't remember which.

02:05:39.584 --> 02:05:40.745
It's an early chapter.

02:05:43.808 --> 02:05:45.549
But it's a guy who studied with

02:05:50.371 --> 02:06:11.085
Lazard I gotta I can't even say the guy's name Sorry, I gotta I want to find it because it's cool Because they tell the story shit I can't find it now, but they tell the story of how Leo Szilard or Lazard or whatever his name is Decided to become a biologist.

02:06:11.966 --> 02:06:15.108
I think it's the one before this page this chapter

02:06:25.202 --> 02:06:25.783
Is this it?

02:06:26.123 --> 02:06:26.403
Shoot.

02:06:27.664 --> 02:06:31.547
I'm really sorry for this little delay at the end here, but you know, you can tolerate me.

02:06:31.648 --> 02:06:34.570
I can't find the page that I read a long time ago.

02:06:36.292 --> 02:06:39.955
Leo... where is it?

02:06:41.136 --> 02:06:44.579
Anyway, I can show it to you tomorrow when I find it again.

02:06:44.599 --> 02:06:45.940
I think it was right here.

02:06:49.855 --> 02:07:00.478
But they talk about how he decided and how they decided to convert to biology because there were still fundamental laws to be found there.

02:07:02.799 --> 02:07:03.399
Darn it!

02:07:03.939 --> 02:07:06.500
I'm going through the whole freaking book to try and find it now.

02:07:11.702 --> 02:07:12.442
It's just nuts.

02:07:12.722 --> 02:07:13.542
It's really nuts.

02:07:14.963 --> 02:07:18.724
But this person that wrote the chapter that I'm thinking of got invited

02:07:19.727 --> 02:07:28.989
to go to the University of Chicago and work on biology, phage biology, phage biology with this guy that Mark mentioned.

02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:30.589
Why can't I find it now?

02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:31.409
Have I read so far?

02:07:31.449 --> 02:07:33.109
Oh, yes, I did read so far.

02:07:33.970 --> 02:07:34.510
There it is.

02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:35.630
Wow, crazy.

02:07:35.670 --> 02:07:36.370
I read so far.

02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.890
I had to go all the way.

02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:39.191
I really thought it was much earlier in the read.

02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:42.411
So here, here, here, and here.

02:07:42.431 --> 02:07:42.471
No.

02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:49.111
Oh no, sorry, here.

02:07:49.811 --> 02:07:54.494
This is the chapter by Aaron Novick, and it's called Phenotype Mixing.

02:07:54.935 --> 02:08:02.439
And the discovery of phenotype mixing related to bacteria vices was a wonderful introduction to biology for Leo Szilard and me.

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:09.584
What could be more appropriate for a physics and a chemist to want to become biologists than to find a virus that can change its spots?

02:08:10.264 --> 02:08:10.945
And so they

02:08:12.099 --> 02:08:18.462
Leo Szilard was a legendary figure even among many legendary figures associated with the project.

02:08:19.223 --> 02:08:23.785
He preferred the company of younger men and blah blah blah.

02:08:24.528 --> 02:08:33.191
It's funny, they mentioned we were both impressed with Joshua Lederberg and the impressions of his two-year-old discovery of genetic recombination in bacteria.

02:08:33.631 --> 02:08:46.394
They tried to replicate some of his experiments and did so, but then as they were replicating his experiments, a paper came out where their experiments that they were doing was just a table in Lederberg's paper.

02:08:47.435 --> 02:08:48.455
So they never published it.

02:08:48.495 --> 02:08:49.655
That's also in this chapter.

02:08:51.636 --> 02:08:56.541
And so they do a bunch of stuff with irradiated phages, which is also really cool.

02:08:56.581 --> 02:08:58.263
So anyway, Mark's not a crazy guy.

02:08:58.283 --> 02:09:10.256
And actually, you can find a lot of confirmation of the people maps that he's making, the connections that he's making in books, like real live books that you can buy for like $10 on eBay.

02:09:10.296 --> 02:09:10.536
So, um,

02:09:13.599 --> 02:09:17.865
I don't know what to tell you guys, but I'm kicking some ass and taking some names.

02:09:19.667 --> 02:09:20.949
But do a hard stop for a minute.

02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:22.171
I'm going to interrupt you on this.

02:09:22.311 --> 02:09:24.233
That's a ridiculous statement.

02:09:24.273 --> 02:09:24.474
Why?

02:09:24.694 --> 02:09:26.777
When you have complete immunity, you're a lawyer.

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:29.673
What do they care what Andy says?

02:09:30.113 --> 02:09:31.514
If you have complete immunity?

02:09:31.754 --> 02:09:32.354
It's true.

02:09:32.374 --> 02:09:42.517
The 1986 Vaccine Immunity Act means that someone... The 1986 Vaccine Act only predicts the things on the schedule.

02:09:42.577 --> 02:09:45.497
So the COVID vaccine is not relevant to this discussion.

02:09:45.537 --> 02:09:48.718
In fact, the PrEP Act is relevant to this discussion.

02:09:48.778 --> 02:09:51.859
And in reference to the PrEP Act, it is very, very simple.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.401
If you have a lawyer friend, you can test this on the lawyer friend.

02:09:56.462 --> 02:10:10.348
The PREP Act is unconstitutional because it allows an unelected official to declare an emergency, suspending fundamental rights on the basis of what is called the rational basis test alone.

02:10:11.128 --> 02:10:15.990
The rational basis test is a legal principle that any lawyer worth their salt would understand.

02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:21.993
And it is not a sufficient basis for suspending the fundamental rights of American citizens.

02:10:23.331 --> 02:10:38.042
That's what the PREP Act allows the Health and Human Services Secretary, currently my former employer, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to do on the rational basis test alone, which is just a hunch, a feeling.

02:10:39.068 --> 02:10:40.749
I think it's a good idea, is enough.

02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:43.211
There's no list of criteria.

02:10:43.592 --> 02:10:45.453
There's no minimum danger.

02:10:45.533 --> 02:10:46.534
There's nothing like that.

02:10:46.834 --> 02:10:53.279
And then no estimation of why or what, nothing, just on the whim of this unelected official.

02:10:53.340 --> 02:11:04.649
That makes it unconstitutional because there is a principle in American law that fundamental rights cannot be suspended unless the government is held to strict scrutiny.

02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:06.930
And what that means is they have to have a list of

02:11:07.853 --> 02:11:11.175
previously determined reasons to do it.

02:11:15.036 --> 02:11:16.937
And those don't exist in the PrEP Act.

02:11:17.037 --> 02:11:30.884
And so Aaron Seery, and apparently this lawyer, and Mary Holland, and Bobby Ann Cox, and this Mendel Hall guy from the Brownstone Institute, these people are all full of shit.

02:11:32.062 --> 02:11:37.451
because I, as a non-lawyer, have already been able to read enough books to figure it out.

02:11:38.413 --> 02:11:45.525
And this goes back to Federalist Society principles, like University of Chicago principles, so I'm not a crazy person.

02:11:48.208 --> 02:11:55.735
And again, any lawyer worth their salt would understand what that means, that the government cannot suspend fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny.

02:11:55.755 --> 02:11:58.138
And there's no strict scrutiny required in the PREP Act.

02:11:58.158 --> 02:12:05.245
So the fricking law could be struck as unconstitutional by one federal judge upon challenge.

02:12:05.305 --> 02:12:05.745
That's it.

02:12:06.165 --> 02:12:07.427
It just takes one case.

02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:16.133
And I would argue that all of these lawyers, save maybe Rolf Hazelhurst, have known this since the very beginning.

02:12:16.273 --> 02:12:17.313
And that's why they're there.

02:12:18.514 --> 02:12:20.755
Mary Holland is probably not even a real lawyer.

02:12:20.855 --> 02:12:25.476
She's probably got more knowledge about Russian law than she does American law.

02:12:26.977 --> 02:12:29.538
Otherwise, it too would be very simple for her.

02:12:29.578 --> 02:12:31.679
It's an L1 lawyer problem.

02:12:32.759 --> 02:12:37.581
This is not advanced, you know, Harvard or Yale law review shit here.

02:12:39.969 --> 02:12:50.098
So they are declaring openly that they are either wholly incompetent or actively working against us because you could teach that to your children in a few minutes.

02:12:53.681 --> 02:12:59.907
I can't ground you in your bedroom without dinner, without a very good reason.

02:12:59.927 --> 02:13:02.109
And that very good reason is strict scrutiny.

02:13:04.335 --> 02:13:07.618
And it shouldn't be just because I feel like it.

02:13:07.678 --> 02:13:09.380
Now, take it a little bit further.

02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:11.441
I would like to give you a spanking.

02:13:12.529 --> 02:13:12.769
Right?

02:13:12.809 --> 02:13:18.790
I want to slap you around as a parent and I have no good reason for it.

02:13:18.850 --> 02:13:35.414
The government has to have a very good reason to tell you to stay in your house or to put you in jail or to, as Alan Dershowitz says, decide to mandatorily intramuscularly inject a combination of substances because it's good for society.

02:13:37.114 --> 02:13:39.655
And these people are nowhere near

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:43.622
talking about that fundamental idea, nowhere near it.

02:13:43.802 --> 02:13:50.807
The only way else they're nowhere near, talking about how without PCR, this entire illusion would not be possible.

02:13:52.608 --> 02:14:01.434
And PCR is still going on as a diagnostic in next generation technologies that have gone, that are diagnosing everything.

02:14:01.554 --> 02:14:09.319
And this woman has been advocating for more diagnostics, more precision diagnostics that pediatricians don't use.

02:14:11.296 --> 02:14:13.137
all one malevolent show.

02:14:13.197 --> 02:14:20.119
That's why her objection to Casey Means and their harvesting of Fitbit information is just dumb.

02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:25.461
It's for all the marbles and she knows it.

02:14:25.981 --> 02:14:27.702
Like Andy should be allowed to speak.

02:14:27.762 --> 02:14:31.003
I mean, the commercial interests of the vaccine manufacturers is protected.

02:14:31.023 --> 02:14:31.583
Why should they care?

02:14:32.404 --> 02:14:32.924
That's a good point.

02:14:33.504 --> 02:14:34.424
Right and guess what?

02:14:35.125 --> 02:14:36.085
Now, we get to the

02:14:36.471 --> 02:14:38.031
Ladies and gentlemen, it's very simple.

02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:43.853
Autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make intramuscular injection is never questioned, make sure of it.

02:14:44.833 --> 02:14:49.074
That virology is never questioned as a science, that public health is never questioned as a reason.

02:14:49.514 --> 02:15:02.737
And in fact, gain-of-function research and pandemics are also used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

02:15:03.854 --> 02:15:06.837
That's the trap that we are being run into by these people.

02:15:07.738 --> 02:15:14.324
We are being run into that trap by anonymous actors on the same team on social media.

02:15:14.364 --> 02:15:23.954
That's why for a brief period of time, the traitor to our children, Jikki Leaks, absorbed some of my ideas, but ultimately turned against me too.

02:15:25.009 --> 02:15:29.273
It's the same reason why these people... I'm not sure exactly who he is.

02:15:29.393 --> 02:15:30.854
His name is J.J.

02:15:30.935 --> 02:15:31.195
Cooey.

02:15:31.275 --> 02:15:39.483
That's why these people got together to have a stream to discuss my ideas, but not really, while I was working for CHD, because it was an elaborate illusion.

02:15:40.529 --> 02:15:42.931
just like what they did to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:15:42.951 --> 02:15:43.672
for his whole life.

02:15:43.712 --> 02:15:45.714
They put groups of these people on you.

02:15:46.435 --> 02:15:52.461
That's what- That's- Consistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:15:52.521 --> 02:15:57.866
That's why in 2021, I was in a Signal chat with the Weinsteins.

02:15:58.936 --> 02:16:11.627
You know, Heather and Brett, along with Matt Crawford and Alex, Alexandros Marinos and Chris Martinson, talking about how transfection would cause autoimmunity and it wasn't appropriate for anyone.

02:16:12.188 --> 02:16:14.550
And they ignored it for four years.

02:16:15.691 --> 02:16:17.552
They stood in front of me for four years.

02:16:17.613 --> 02:16:20.155
They didn't share any of it for four years.

02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:34.069
only occasionally saying my name on their stream or some other person's stream, but just my name and not very loud, and certainly not with a website or that I was doing anything.

02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:40.194
Insistence, and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:16:40.514 --> 02:16:43.757
Unfortunately for Heather, she's not really read in, I don't think.

02:16:43.797 --> 02:16:47.100
That's why she blew it when she said that, my insistence.

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:50.342
I had been insisting since 2021, when I wrote a review

02:16:53.700 --> 02:17:02.467
with somebody who then hooked me up with Bret Weinstein after the review was done, but was probably sharing the review with Bret Weinstein the whole time as we wrote it.

02:17:02.567 --> 02:17:17.158
And her name is Piper Stover, who spent 10 years in China before probably playing some intelligence agent role with me at the beginning of 2021, when she encouraged me to write my stuff down so she could get it in a newspaper.

02:17:20.782 --> 02:17:25.306
Then I got handed off, then I got handed off to these clowns for a year.

02:17:26.287 --> 02:17:30.831
And then at some point they drove me out and pretended that Matt Crawford was leaving with me.

02:17:31.312 --> 02:17:40.861
And I was on a Bitcoin chat with Matt Crawford during Omicron for a little while, while he misrepresented me there and everywhere else with Jessica Rose on the Tommy podcast.

02:17:42.321 --> 02:17:44.622
Then I got hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:17:44.682 --> 02:17:52.704
and I was busy with the book for a year and a half or a year thinking that I was fighting against Rixey and that Rixey getting fired was real when it wasn't.

02:17:55.365 --> 02:18:01.687
And then I got hired by CHD afterward and they told me to mind my own business.

02:18:01.707 --> 02:18:03.827
We're building a big top tent of health freedom.

02:18:03.867 --> 02:18:05.548
Here's $100,000 a year.

02:18:05.988 --> 02:18:11.890
Now why don't you go to these doctor's offices and see if you can organize their medical records and make a paper out of it.

02:18:12.748 --> 02:18:13.709
Call us when you're done.

02:18:16.731 --> 02:18:20.955
No show for you, no interview for you, no nothing.

02:18:21.275 --> 02:18:24.938
Just you be a staff scientist behind Brian Hooker and do stuff.

02:18:26.059 --> 02:18:26.919
It won't go anywhere.

02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:32.984
And the Weinsteins.

02:18:34.125 --> 02:18:39.069
Insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than the vaccine.

02:18:39.605 --> 02:18:42.447
That's why all of this stuff exists.

02:18:42.587 --> 02:18:43.949
We will not call autism.

02:18:44.109 --> 02:18:45.650
I don't like the word autism.

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.611
He was vaccine damaged.

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:49.373
He was neurologically damaged.

02:18:51.394 --> 02:18:54.577
I see this book as exactly what Brian decided to do.

02:18:54.697 --> 02:19:03.985
If I would have gone along with this book, I would probably be on podcasts with Mary Talley Bowden and with Jack Kraus, and it would all be the same bullshit.

02:19:05.626 --> 02:19:08.028
Lab leak, it's a cover up, yada, yada, yada.

02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:13.391
just like he went along with saying autism for another 10 years.

02:19:14.551 --> 02:19:19.434
He was neurologically damaged, in condition that we will not call autism.

02:19:19.574 --> 02:19:21.094
I don't like the word autism.

02:19:22.615 --> 02:19:28.157
Until in 2023, Skyhorse finally published a book that they never sell.

02:19:28.438 --> 02:19:29.978
I don't like the word autism.

02:19:30.879 --> 02:19:31.939
He was vaccine damaged.

02:19:32.299 --> 02:19:33.680
He was neurologically damaged.

02:19:35.050 --> 02:19:37.171
condition that we will not call autism.

02:19:37.311 --> 02:19:38.853
I don't like the word autism.

02:19:39.653 --> 02:19:40.774
He was vaccine damaged.

02:19:41.155 --> 02:19:42.456
He was neurologically damaged.

02:19:42.576 --> 02:19:52.164
Like binoculars, this statement and listening to its meaning, understanding its meaning and its significance in 2013,

02:19:54.185 --> 02:20:07.155
its significance relative to the history of Brandy Vaughn, its significance relative to the history of the messaging of CHD changed my perspective like binoculars can change your perspective on the physical world.

02:20:07.576 --> 02:20:20.306
This changed my perspective on this illusion of consensus and all of these actors, all of these phenomenon doors to freedom, Brownstone Institute, World Council for Health,

02:20:22.432 --> 02:20:24.033
It's all an elaborate illusion.

02:20:25.253 --> 02:20:27.254
Brian Hooker sold out two years ago.

02:20:27.274 --> 02:20:31.375
And whether he likes it or not, that's where we are.

02:20:31.395 --> 02:20:32.136
He's part of this illusion.

02:20:32.176 --> 02:20:33.336
Isolation and purification.

02:20:33.496 --> 02:20:34.837
It's the same illusion.

02:20:34.857 --> 02:20:35.557
Isolation, what was it?

02:20:37.578 --> 02:20:39.618
Isolation and purification.

02:20:41.439 --> 02:20:42.179
Of the virus?

02:20:42.259 --> 02:20:42.479
Yes.

02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:49.202
Well, you isolate a virus by, um, um,

02:20:52.279 --> 02:20:54.620
finding the virus which causes a disease.

02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:55.840
It's all the same illusion.

02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:59.180
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:08.002
Kevin McKernan descends directly from the same line of mentors that Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits descend from.

02:21:08.562 --> 02:21:10.043
This line of mentors.

02:21:10.063 --> 02:21:10.883
Depends on how they used it.

02:21:11.343 --> 02:21:11.583
Okay.

02:21:12.043 --> 02:21:13.263
Gallo, Gardner.

02:21:13.303 --> 02:21:15.184
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

02:21:16.004 --> 02:21:16.444
All of them.

02:21:17.725 --> 02:21:19.666
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:21:19.766 --> 02:21:22.147
I mean, he actually isolated it, so.

02:21:23.508 --> 02:21:25.769
So if Kevin McKernan- Why should I do all of this?

02:21:25.869 --> 02:21:27.930
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:21:28.210 --> 02:21:37.015
If Kevin McKernan is going on big podcasts to say bullshit like this, is it not gonna play?

02:21:37.395 --> 02:21:37.915
You demon.

02:21:39.756 --> 02:21:41.037
Yeah, it didn't play, shoot.

02:21:45.529 --> 02:21:48.051
If he's going on big podcasts to say stuff like this.

02:21:48.071 --> 02:21:51.754
I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:21:51.994 --> 02:21:52.895
You can capture it.

02:21:52.935 --> 02:21:53.816
You can sequence it.

02:21:53.876 --> 02:21:56.598
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:21:56.618 --> 02:22:00.801
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:22:01.042 --> 02:22:01.942
You can capture it.

02:22:01.982 --> 02:22:02.863
You can sequence it.

02:22:02.923 --> 02:22:05.105
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:22:05.285 --> 02:22:22.770
Now this is no different than Brian Hooker saying that autism does exist, we can diagnose it, sometimes you can treat it, and it's definitely caused by vaccines when they're given in combination when you have Tylenol or a fever or ear infection.

02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.281
It's definitely from the cytokines though.

02:22:26.301 --> 02:22:27.501
It's not from the aluminum.

02:22:27.521 --> 02:22:32.423
The aluminum would be different according to Peter McCullough.

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:40.566
And you know, really, if we learn to, as Peter McCullough said, if we learn to manage febrile seizures better, maybe this whole problem would go away too.

02:22:40.926 --> 02:22:45.868
And you know, the transgender thing, that's also autistic kids, according to Peter McCullough.

02:22:45.888 --> 02:22:49.009
So we're going down to a shithole very quick.

02:22:49.049 --> 02:22:51.670
We're spiraling down the drain very quick with this,

02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:54.151
with this fake anti-vax movement.

02:22:54.291 --> 02:22:59.573
And whether Brian Hooker has got the balls and the principles to finally pull his head out doesn't matter.

02:22:59.633 --> 02:23:02.775
We have to pull our own families out.

02:23:04.295 --> 02:23:05.636
We have to pull our country out.

02:23:06.496 --> 02:23:08.697
We have to pull the people on the left out.

02:23:08.837 --> 02:23:14.740
We have to pull the people on the right out because we both, everybody's got their head in the same hole.

02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:17.541
The hole was dug in the Manhattan Project.

02:23:18.462 --> 02:23:21.124
The hole was dug deeper at 9-11.

02:23:21.184 --> 02:23:26.407
The hole was dug even deeper with the coronavirus pandemic.

02:23:34.784 --> 02:23:42.050
So anyway, this has been GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:23:43.771 --> 02:23:45.193
These people were all put in place.

02:23:45.353 --> 02:23:48.075
That's why you can see them for what they are.

02:23:48.575 --> 02:23:52.398
This laughter, this misleading, I don't know if these are repeating or what.

02:23:52.419 --> 02:23:53.199
Did I start over?

02:23:53.319 --> 02:23:54.360
I had to start over, yeah.

02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:56.322
It's murder and lies for what, right?

02:23:56.362 --> 02:24:02.407
And if you looked at where these guys were doing their podcasts and when they were doing their podcasts, it's actually kind of gross.

02:24:03.390 --> 02:24:15.375
because you can see that this Marty McCarty guy was always auditioning, that even ZDogg was auditioning, that Vinay Prasad was auditioning, that Jay Bhattacharya was auditioning.

02:24:17.116 --> 02:24:19.037
They were all auditioning because why?

02:24:19.097 --> 02:24:19.717
How can you tell?

02:24:19.757 --> 02:24:24.599
Well, because after the murder is over, he stops working.

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:31.582
After the murder's over, they just kind of stop working until there's an FDA appointment to be had.

02:24:31.622 --> 02:24:33.003
Well, then I got to get my,

02:24:33.882 --> 02:24:38.403
you know, warm up my narrative chops here, make sure I can speak to multiple people about it.

02:24:39.364 --> 02:24:42.284
Get ready, because the track record reveals it.

02:24:42.384 --> 02:24:44.645
If you look at my track record, it's very different.

02:24:44.665 --> 02:24:47.686
If you look at Robert Malone's track record, it's very different.

02:24:47.706 --> 02:24:52.187
If you look at Kevin McCairn's track record, it's got an awful lot of thumbnails with me in it.

02:24:52.927 --> 02:24:58.309
If you look at Charles Rixey's track record during the pandemic, it's got a lot of Kevin McCairn in it.

02:25:00.129 --> 02:25:01.730
If you look at Kevin McKernan's,

02:25:02.836 --> 02:25:09.299
work as a podcast guest during the pandemic, there's no way to see it any other way.

02:25:09.479 --> 02:25:10.959
It would come out just like this.

02:25:11.039 --> 02:25:14.581
While the Murder and Lies was going on, he was doing podcasts all over the world.

02:25:15.221 --> 02:25:20.763
And then it probably stopped for a year until they needed to queue up the DNA and then they started again.

02:25:21.123 --> 02:25:24.005
And you would see a gap just like that because they ran out the clock.

02:25:24.385 --> 02:25:25.065
And during that 2023

02:25:28.823 --> 02:25:43.278
Gap is when Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and the traitor to American children, Jessica Hockett from Chicago, pulled their con on me for a year, tried to get me to write a virology review with those assholes.

02:25:44.417 --> 02:25:51.839
and then abruptly broke off all contact, blocked me and pretended I didn't exist and continue to write that shitty substack using my ideas.

02:25:52.659 --> 02:25:59.781
Jessica Hockett, this one right down here, is one of the worst people in this narrative because she misled me.

02:26:00.922 --> 02:26:09.544
I don't like her because she misled me, tried to mislead my family and interfered with my family's ability to pass on the truth to our children.

02:26:10.804 --> 02:26:12.385
And that is some malevolent shit.

02:26:13.643 --> 02:26:16.564
But that's no different than what Sasha Latapova has done.

02:26:16.604 --> 02:26:33.090
It's no different than what George Webb and Paul Cuttrell and Kevin McCarran and Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone have done.

02:26:33.310 --> 02:26:39.672
Robert Malone is probably the guy who knows that Bruce Ivins is innocent.

02:26:41.971 --> 02:26:45.672
Of course, Steve Hatfield knows that Bruce Ivins is innocent too.

02:26:46.032 --> 02:26:52.614
And all of these people know that Brandi was right and they don't give a shit that she was murdered because it would get in the way of their grift.

02:26:53.214 --> 02:27:02.576
The grift that's been going on since she was running an operation in the UK, excuse me, with Andrew Wakefield.

02:27:04.636 --> 02:27:06.737
And that's why this lady is now in front of us.

02:27:06.878 --> 02:27:13.102
Not Brandy, but that lady went on Joe Rogan and didn't really say anything useful other than cinnamon has vitamin C in it.

02:27:15.919 --> 02:27:26.403
That's because this is part of the Human Genome Project, this illusion of consensus about a novel virus that PCR can test for that millions of people were infected by and is still circulating now.

02:27:26.443 --> 02:27:34.447
This illusion of consensus is part of the Human Genome Project that has seamlessly allowed the establishment of PCR as a diagnostic.

02:27:37.528 --> 02:27:39.649
And PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud.

02:27:41.747 --> 02:27:53.670
And they have been putting in place people since at least Reagan, but of course it goes back much farther with this in mind, with the Human Genome Project as a national security priority.

02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:59.712
And that's why Andrew Wakefield is being promoted all over the place now, because he is central to this narrative.

02:28:00.452 --> 02:28:03.433
His failure should be central to its collapse.

02:28:04.312 --> 02:28:08.654
But unfortunately, these people create an illusion of consensus that it's not a failure.

02:28:09.054 --> 02:28:11.896
It's 30 years of fighting.

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:29.945
That's why these people put this guy in front of you and why this guy is intimately attached to bringing all of these people in front of us in the year later.

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:45.651
That's why these people are tied to him because he is a direct link to this fake health freedom movement at the heart of which are Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and James Lyons Weiler and Mary Holland.

02:28:47.272 --> 02:28:52.736
Mary Holland really should have a very big picture on this, but I just dislike her so much that I don't put her picture on here.

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:59.141
But these three, they have no excuse for not talking about the murder and lies in America that could have been avoided.

02:29:01.354 --> 02:29:09.898
but were instead used, sculpting an expected rise in all cause mortality in America into something that could be misconstrued as a crisis.

02:29:10.438 --> 02:29:16.721
They're not going to tell you that just not using antibiotics for a viral pneumonia was murder.

02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:17.721
None of them have said that.

02:29:19.102 --> 02:29:21.783
None of them have said that pure oxygen is not a therapeutic.

02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:36.504
None of them have pointed out that Pierre Cory was a witness for George Floyd on the suffocation side, and also a guy who seeded the narrative about pole socks and about supplementary oxygen.

02:29:39.409 --> 02:29:42.391
And none of them question PCR as a diagnostic tool.

02:29:42.411 --> 02:29:56.042
They are literally actually just letting it go on and be established as a diagnostic tool, accepted and not regulated by the FDA, which should be regulating each one as a separate medical device.

02:29:59.295 --> 02:30:02.898
But of course, since Marty Makary's in place, that guy doesn't give a shit.

02:30:03.379 --> 02:30:07.262
He's there on purpose, just like these people were put there on purpose.

02:30:07.682 --> 02:30:11.866
And the list of ways that I can discredit them now is kind of absurd.

02:30:13.327 --> 02:30:19.373
The ways that they all seem to just discredit themselves over the last five years is just absurd.

02:30:20.629 --> 02:30:26.052
And unfortunately, I'm stuck in the middle of these jackasses because it's a fake anti-vax movement.

02:30:26.092 --> 02:30:28.293
It's for all the children of earth and I've got children.

02:30:28.874 --> 02:30:33.836
I lost my best friend, Nathan, to this because I couldn't figure it out quick enough.

02:30:33.956 --> 02:30:41.200
That I was bamboozled by all these people into thinking there was a lab leak that I was fighting for and that I was a hero for having spoken out about.

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:46.884
And I believed that for a long time because it's a very, very, very enticing narrative to believe you're a hero.

02:30:47.824 --> 02:30:49.265
Now I just believe I was duped.

02:30:50.888 --> 02:30:55.854
And I'm pissed, but it's okay because you were duped by them too.

02:30:56.434 --> 02:30:59.818
Because back then in 2013, Brian didn't call it autism.

02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:07.427
And in 2021, Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying knew that it was transfection and they purposely didn't use the word.

02:31:07.487 --> 02:31:08.248
They admitted it in 2024.

02:31:10.342 --> 02:31:19.509
And Kevin McKernan is now saying that the RNA is real and it can recapitulate disease on podcasts because they need to combat and stick to the lie.

02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:21.651
They need to combat the truth.

02:31:21.991 --> 02:31:24.533
They need the spectacular commitment to continue.

02:31:24.953 --> 02:31:28.336
And it will continue because they are committed to the bad biology.

02:31:28.416 --> 02:31:30.838
Bad biology 101 is what we are trying to fight.

02:31:31.338 --> 02:31:32.059
And we'll get to it.

02:31:32.199 --> 02:31:34.361
I promise we are gonna get to it, ladies and gentlemen.

02:31:34.881 --> 02:31:36.883
Injection versus ingestion is a hint.

02:31:37.563 --> 02:31:41.487
But it's really a symbiosis between you and a bouquet of bacteria.

02:31:42.027 --> 02:31:54.118
And it's that symbiosis and interaction with your immune system that all of these people have used against you, have lied about it, given you a super dumb, simple explanation for immunity.

02:31:54.558 --> 02:31:57.160
And it's all because the Human Genome Project has just begun.

02:31:57.961 --> 02:32:11.851
and so they're controlling your consciousness using your acquiescence to social media so get off of it and start sharing via email again because it was just murder and lies and the only reason why there might be any excuse for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:32:11.891 --> 02:32:19.116
is because these jackasses have been working really hard for a really long time ladies and gentlemen they misconstrued spread of a background signal

02:32:19.756 --> 02:32:20.477
It's not real.

02:32:21.258 --> 02:32:24.361
And you can see right through it because it's non-specific PCR test.

02:32:24.381 --> 02:32:24.981
That's all it is.

02:32:25.121 --> 02:32:26.142
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:32:26.182 --> 02:32:28.004
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

02:32:28.425 --> 02:32:32.268
Placebos made it safe using their tests to find their ghost.

02:32:32.288 --> 02:32:34.951
Doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster.

02:32:36.612 --> 02:32:37.633
Thanks for being here, guys.

02:32:38.094 --> 02:32:38.875
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

02:32:42.852 --> 02:32:49.885
from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:33:24.414 --> 02:33:25.555
Thank you very much, guys.

02:33:25.575 --> 02:33:26.435
See you again tomorrow.

02:33:29.417 --> 02:33:31.619
See you again tomorrow.
