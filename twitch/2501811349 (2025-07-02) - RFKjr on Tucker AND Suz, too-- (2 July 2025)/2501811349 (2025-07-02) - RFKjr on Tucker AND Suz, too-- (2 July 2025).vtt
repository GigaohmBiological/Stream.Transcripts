WEBVTT

00:19.068 --> 00:22.993
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

00:24.795 --> 00:25.496
And I have lied.

00:25.516 --> 00:26.557
I'm sure I'll lie again.

00:26.577 --> 00:27.538
I don't want to lie.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.360
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.481
I try not to be a liar.

00:30.501 --> 00:31.342
I don't want to be a liar.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.666
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

00:41.497 --> 00:48.742
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like J.J.

00:48.822 --> 01:04.653
Cooley, you know, who's regarded by a few people, by some people, as sort of this kind of savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt, and in many ways they are.

01:04.673 --> 01:04.933
But that's...

01:09.772 --> 01:12.595
that's throwing baby out of the bath water.

01:13.035 --> 01:22.663
I mean, the best thinkers in the world all fall through and suffer through the consequences of ten bad ideas for every good one, you know, the best creative thinkers.

01:23.823 --> 01:31.409
And so, if you're going to jump on every one of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with, that you don't agree with, then use that as

01:33.072 --> 01:35.295
are to smear the person.

01:35.315 --> 01:37.719
I think that's just, you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.546
You won't find the losers, the creative inspiration.

01:42.287 --> 01:45.973
So I certainly think that JJ Cooley's overall take is very good.

01:48.866 --> 01:49.346
Actually, J.J.

01:49.386 --> 01:56.031
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:56.831 --> 01:57.311
Actually, J.J.

01:57.351 --> 02:04.016
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:06.617 --> 02:15.103
The one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.476
I think truth is good for kids.

02:54.917 --> 02:58.760
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.202
We want everybody to feel good.

03:01.402 --> 03:03.184
That's not the way life is.

03:30.372 --> 03:32.033
No one's ever come back from 3-1.

03:32.953 --> 03:34.014
Agonizing defeat.

03:36.775 --> 03:38.876
We've all been underestimated and counted out.

03:41.217 --> 03:43.538
In those moments, we felt like it was over.

03:43.938 --> 03:45.919
But it's when we're given no chance,

03:50.250 --> 03:55.931
that we somehow found that last bit of strength to keep fighting.

03:55.991 --> 03:57.771
And then we did what no one thought we could.

03:57.791 --> 04:00.132
Not even ourselves.

04:05.533 --> 04:09.493
We came back from the impossible.

04:11.654 --> 04:17.635
From being broken.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.355
We found a way when it seemed hopeless.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.222
We came back when we should have been long forgotten.

04:29.224 --> 04:32.806
And we did it time and time again.

04:33.026 --> 04:40.190
Right now, we're fighting for something much bigger than a win or championship.

04:40.230 --> 04:49.655
But if we learn anything from sports, it's that no matter how far down we may be,

04:52.805 --> 04:57.296
We are never too far down to come back.

04:59.682 --> 05:00.604
What time is it?

05:00.665 --> 05:01.406
Game time!

05:08.385 --> 05:09.786
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

05:09.826 --> 05:10.706
Welcome to the show.

05:10.786 --> 05:18.090
This is Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist, where we stay focused on that biology.

05:18.130 --> 05:22.493
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

05:23.253 --> 05:24.254
Welcome to the show.

05:24.554 --> 05:26.895
Please get your kids off of social media.

05:26.975 --> 05:28.876
Get yourself off of social media.

05:29.977 --> 05:31.237
There's no reason to be there.

05:32.878 --> 05:35.440
You can let somebody else dip their feet into that trash.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.861
Um, I don't mind doing it.

05:38.261 --> 05:40.523
In condition that we will not call autism.

05:40.683 --> 05:42.224
I don't like the word autism.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.105
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

05:44.525 --> 05:45.946
He was neurologically damaged.

05:46.867 --> 05:49.389
In condition that we will not call autism.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.090
I don't like the word autism.

05:51.750 --> 05:52.991
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

05:53.456 --> 05:57.520
Of course, we know that 2013 Brian Hooker gets it.

05:58.601 --> 06:02.746
We know that 2015 Brandy Hooker got it.

06:02.766 --> 06:03.807
I'm sorry, Brandy Hooker.

06:04.288 --> 06:05.809
Brandy Vaughn got it.

06:06.630 --> 06:12.036
I've seen too many pictures of Brandy and Brian together and I start calling them by the same last name.

06:12.076 --> 06:12.817
Isn't that scary?

06:13.357 --> 06:16.379
Also, I could say Tony Hooker, but no, it's Tony Bark.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.981
Also in a lot of pictures with Brian Hooker.

06:19.501 --> 06:24.425
Probably would have seen through the pandemic and gain a function in all this mythology very well.

06:24.925 --> 06:26.747
That's why they were both killed in 2020.

06:27.647 --> 06:32.230
And we don't have them in front of us to help them help us question our way out of this.

06:32.751 --> 06:42.478
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, if you don't understand why all of these mythologies are only possible because of social media, you're in big trouble.

06:42.938 --> 06:44.280
Your kids are in big trouble.

06:44.801 --> 06:45.642
There is a way out.

06:46.363 --> 06:50.009
One of the ways out is to learn the biology that they ignore.

06:50.129 --> 06:52.593
Learn the biology that they don't teach.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.878
Fireworks on Friday, ladies and gentlemen.

06:55.938 --> 06:57.060
Fireworks on Friday.

06:57.140 --> 06:57.681
Don't forget.

06:58.442 --> 07:10.677
If you're unaware, which is kind of impossible, Housatonic ITS, housatonicits.com, Housatonic Live on YouTube, Twitch, Rumble, BitChute, yada, yada, yada, the guys everywhere.

07:11.037 --> 07:12.860
And his website is fantastic.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.403
I'm going to show you or give you an example of that today.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.625
And also this sub stack, I can't recommend enough.

07:19.745 --> 07:21.305
Please share it around the world.

07:21.966 --> 07:23.926
It's one of those ways that we can wake people up.

07:23.966 --> 07:26.647
Scotland was an especially egregious crime.

07:28.128 --> 07:30.588
And when you know the truth, the truth can set you free.

07:32.249 --> 07:32.489
Yeah.

07:34.650 --> 07:37.491
I don't know what to say, but we're going to get there.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.571
The biology is going to get us there.

07:41.452 --> 07:44.613
I'm pretty confident now that we can see our way out.

07:45.515 --> 07:48.938
It's just that it's hard to do everything in one show.

07:48.958 --> 07:54.442
This is just one American coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

07:54.522 --> 08:07.852
Just one American and his family is putting all of it on the line here to make sure that people can avoid being drowned by this wave of consensus by staying focused on the biology.

08:07.912 --> 08:11.475
Again, not taking that yucky bait on social media.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.076
It's just a military program.

08:14.117 --> 08:16.838
and getting reacquainted with your real neighbors again.

08:16.978 --> 08:18.278
Maybe building some new ones.

08:19.118 --> 08:21.099
Everybody who's been here for a while knows this.

08:21.139 --> 08:27.521
You can look me up on my last name on PubMed to find out that I was a neurobiologist, a published one.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.341
You can see I've got a couple YouTube channels.

08:30.381 --> 08:32.802
Streaming on the second one at the moment.

08:32.862 --> 08:35.963
Probably going to go back to JC on a Bike next week.

08:37.303 --> 08:41.765
How it works is that there are a few very generous people who help this go.

08:41.925 --> 08:47.688
About 110 subscribers and a few bigger donors and that's how we meet our ends and that's it.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.889
We have not made any money last year.

08:50.909 --> 08:54.171
Our taxes reflect a thoroughly

08:55.211 --> 08:58.634
poverty-stricken family and I mean that without any joke.

08:58.674 --> 09:01.317
I'm just trying to be as humble as possible.

09:01.417 --> 09:06.781
We technically qualified under the poverty line last year, but we make it work.

09:08.123 --> 09:09.724
My wife cooks every night.

09:11.005 --> 09:12.206
My kids are tough.

09:14.948 --> 09:16.408
And most important, they're healthy.

09:17.548 --> 09:30.172
And so, you know, with a wife that is willing to, you know, take providing meals as one of her primary responsibilities and then really crush it.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.813
You know, we live like kings here, actually.

09:34.113 --> 09:36.314
It's a little bit like living in a restaurant.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.515
You know, it's got a limited menu.

09:39.575 --> 09:39.795
I mean,

09:40.822 --> 09:47.984
You can ask the cook to make something special, but generally speaking, you're selecting from about 20 spectacular meals.

09:48.804 --> 09:52.645
And so the kids, you know, they regularly debate about which things are moving up.

09:52.745 --> 09:59.627
And every once in a while, the chef will try something new, and we have a debate about whether it makes it to the regular schedule.

10:00.547 --> 10:06.230
And a couple days ago, we had something that had just a little more time than we were used to.

10:06.290 --> 10:10.312
And I think by the end of the meal, everybody agreed that it could go on the schedule.

10:12.334 --> 10:19.137
But it was funny in the beginning how everybody was immediately talking about, okay, this is okay, we can deal with this tonight, but let's not do this again.

10:19.157 --> 10:20.378
It's very funny.

10:20.398 --> 10:23.940
I'm really blessed to have such a wonderful partner in this.

10:25.641 --> 10:28.942
And, you know, I thought I had more partners in this.

10:30.854 --> 10:41.180
But actually what's going on on social media is that we had been tricked into believing that there was some phenomenon that we could assist with.

10:41.741 --> 10:50.806
Some phenomenon that if we all pitched in together that we could change it or shape it differently or escape from it or

10:51.877 --> 11:13.411
Prevent it or something like that and that illusion is very very much akin to what this man is doing in this video where he is Pretending to stop and start this this vehicle this train When it's obvious to all the people around that he's not doing that now, but what's important to see and important as a mind and

11:14.131 --> 11:18.695
Exercise for especially anybody who has never done this before you might maybe it's possible.

11:18.735 --> 11:37.069
There's somebody watching that's never done this before I've used this for a couple years now that you got to imagine what would happen if you came to this subway station from the stairs and there were about 300 of these guys and What would happen if 300 of those guys?

11:37.089 --> 11:37.290
Were all

11:41.949 --> 11:59.656
carrying equipment and and using tools and coordinating vocally and uh i don't know maybe even reinforcing each other by holding their shoulders in particular ways or or or even some of them are wearing suits that look like they might augment their

12:00.276 --> 12:15.127
their strength and maybe some other guys have some kind of blocks or something you know that they're running along with to position in a certain place as if they matter and then they also pull those blocks out right before the other guys start to push again.

12:15.647 --> 12:16.808
The more people

12:18.536 --> 12:36.907
that had elaborate costumes and effects and were all on the same script as this guy, the more convincing it would be, even if you have a lifetime of experience riding the subway in New York and you lived for, I don't know, three years in Prague and rode the subway there.

12:36.927 --> 12:38.028
Is there a subway in Prague?

12:38.068 --> 12:38.548
I don't even know.

12:40.329 --> 12:46.713
And so you have all this experience maybe with multi-level subways in Russia, for example, or whatever.

12:47.714 --> 12:57.543
And then you came down into this subway station, and there were hundreds of people on the same script, but had elaborate costumes and effects.

12:58.063 --> 13:00.366
And a couple of them asked you to help.

13:01.667 --> 13:08.053
And you watched them pretend to barely be able to stop the last train.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.380
and carefully started.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.061
And then they turned around and said, dude, if you would just help, that would be great.

13:14.621 --> 13:16.402
There's another train coming in 10 minutes.

13:16.482 --> 13:25.165
It would be incredibly difficult for you to resist, even if you had a whole lifetime of experience riding the subway.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.707
It would be very difficult for you to resist.

13:29.827 --> 13:36.330
But the point is, is that this is not a situation where all of us had a lifetime experience riding a subway.

13:38.163 --> 13:48.332
or even a single experience riding a subway one time when we went to New York or one time when we rode the L in Chicago and it went downtown.

13:50.560 --> 13:55.442
we would still have the requisite experience to know that this one dude is full of shit.

13:55.862 --> 14:12.948
But if there were a hundred of them with elaborate costumes and effects and a carefully orchestrated script not that dissimilar from, say, what the guys do on the deck of an aircraft carrier, then when they asked you to help on the next train because it has an extra car,

14:14.332 --> 14:19.874
and a few other people came down the stairs and they decided to help and picked up some tools and said, okay, where do you want me to do?

14:20.334 --> 14:23.455
It would be almost impossible for you to resist.

14:24.015 --> 14:35.139
And what I'm trying to suggest to you and your children is that this is precisely what they do on social media to get you to believe actually anything.

14:40.686 --> 14:48.291
And so that's why it's really important to have your elevator pitch down so that you understand how far we've come.

14:48.632 --> 14:50.273
Population pyramids are real.

14:50.773 --> 14:53.935
They posed a threat to Western economies, and they still might.

14:54.416 --> 14:57.638
And so this is a population pyramid mitigating scheme.

15:00.803 --> 15:07.689
RNA cannot pandemic, but they mean to be able to transfect us because they think this is the only way they can learn how ribosomes work.

15:07.729 --> 15:15.935
This is the only way they can learn any more about how heredity works and how genetics contribute to health and disease.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.018
And maybe even how to optimize development.

15:20.058 --> 15:20.759
They need this.

15:21.499 --> 15:28.565
They need us to accept the role of experimental animals and to surrender our sovereignty.

15:29.585 --> 15:35.046
And that's why the idea that intramuscular injections are dumb is so annoying to everyone.

15:35.086 --> 15:49.809
They want me to say it different, like intramuscular injection is not medicine, but it doesn't really hit the right button because it is the absurdity of intramuscular injection that you want to smack people in the face with.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.929
It's absurd.

15:52.029 --> 15:56.410
If I didn't say dumb, maybe I should say intramuscular injections are absurd.

15:58.516 --> 16:02.617
And transfection is a crime, and it's a crime for multiple reasons.

16:02.717 --> 16:25.625
It actually might be also an intellectual property crime in the sense that these involved individuals that go to the highest levels of many governments in the West are aware that transfection and transformation by adenovirus were longstanding methodologies that in no way, shape, or form

16:27.000 --> 16:33.782
likely involved processes that at this stage could be patented, certainly not patented for another 20 years.

16:35.282 --> 16:44.945
And so in order to reset the IP clock on these ideas, they needed to rename them.

16:46.545 --> 16:48.006
And by renaming the

16:48.897 --> 17:06.069
long-standing, you know, general term of transfection by lipid nanoparticle or cationic lipid or however it's described, you got a new thing going and that's the reason why none of the people in this picture have ever used the word transfection save that one time

17:06.969 --> 17:32.884
on twitter and that podcast where heather haying said it and heather haying of course is only working from the script her husband gets and so it's okay if she made that mistake but she never made it again it's not like she stuck to it even though she said specifically my insistence and she thinks i'm right that gee these should be called transfections because calling them transfection would essentially

17:33.835 --> 17:50.402
negate all of the intellectual property that these things represent, negate all of the negotiating power that these pharmaceutical companies, these suppliers, these patent holders have over these ideas if the main thing is just kind of dumb.

17:51.043 --> 17:53.404
It's just a recombinant RNA

17:54.424 --> 18:03.831
produced by pretty standard industrial methods and then it's somehow mechanically combined with a lipid nanoparticle and that's already very old too.

18:05.152 --> 18:18.741
And so there might be some industrialization steps and specific methodologies for the regard to how they get the nanoparticle size to be very uniform that might be patentable but the whole idea, the concept is not.

18:19.781 --> 18:20.422
I assure you.

18:21.102 --> 18:25.826
And so from an intellectual property perspective, there's also a tremendous crime going on here.

18:26.306 --> 18:37.874
But then if you take that and say that it's vaccines and try to mislead people into giving you consent for something that they clearly do not understand, then it becomes very, very disturbing.

18:37.915 --> 18:49.123
And that's where we are with regard to the college kids and the young adults in America who we left out to dry for the first three years of this because we were chasing down a lab leak like a bunch of idiots.

18:52.148 --> 19:07.095
And so it's apparent to me now that we have been under the spell of a bunch of organized adversaries because, for example, one of the primary NoVirus team members, Alex Zek, was on stage with Robert Kennedy Jr.

19:07.175 --> 19:08.216
in 2021.

19:08.776 --> 19:11.998
And then they kind of split up like the Ghostbusters to do more damage.

19:13.342 --> 19:36.228
And it seems that that's the same kind of pattern could be seen between Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman and Robert Malone and McCullough and Cole, because they were also opposite each other on some podcasts early and then spread out to do more damage, never really questioning each other or naming each other again.

19:36.288 --> 19:41.289
So essentially, they could both herd separate cats inside of this

19:41.969 --> 19:45.071
I don't know, pseudo-conservative bullshit health freedom movement.

19:45.712 --> 19:59.961
And that's why you also see this shockingly fraudulent man, Brian Artis, standing next to, well, that's 2022 Brian Hooker, but you know, the 2013 Brian Hooker doesn't say the word autism.

20:00.001 --> 20:03.904
He doesn't like the word autism because his son was vaccine damaged.

20:06.161 --> 20:18.673
These two guys, father and, sorry, husband and wife, have been staunch supporters of Bobby Kennedy since before the pandemic, since before Brandy and Tony were killed.

20:19.113 --> 20:27.021
Here's Lee Dundas, some woman who fooled around with the American trucker thing that screwed it all up or brought guns to it or some shit like that.

20:27.521 --> 20:31.225
And Judy Mikovits, of course, the lady associated with the

20:31.545 --> 20:47.751
baby god movie and probably that family because one of the members of that family roped her into some institute there to study chronic fatigue syndrome and the possible causes of autism from some marine hepatitis virus or some bull... I don't even know.

20:47.771 --> 20:48.711
I don't even care.

20:50.114 --> 21:02.422
because it's a complicated story about nothing that has almost direct ties from the intellectual perspective and from the historical perspective to these people who are tied to the HIV mythology.

21:04.329 --> 21:08.673
And again, I don't have a definitive answer for what HIV was or where it came from.

21:09.374 --> 21:14.478
Because the whole point is, is that all we have are accounts from liars.

21:15.179 --> 21:19.263
We don't have a true account that we can compare all the other accounts to.

21:19.683 --> 21:23.366
The only thing we have is what we've been handed down from these liars.

21:23.807 --> 21:26.149
A controlled narrative.

21:27.202 --> 21:35.326
and the pandemic we started already in the midst of under the guise and not the guise of the spell of this controlled narrative.

21:36.407 --> 21:44.911
And part of that controlled narrative was this bad biology that they're teaching in high schools and in college classrooms for the last 15 or 20 years.

21:48.370 --> 21:57.839
And that's why California Jam, for example, with a satanic lightning bolt and some eyeballs and shit, these guys are all there together.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.944
They don't question, this guy doesn't, is not like pushing them to say it right.

22:04.505 --> 22:09.690
Does this guy say that intramuscular injection is dumb or does he just talk about, you know, kind of,

22:11.103 --> 22:12.144
Amorphous stuff.

22:12.184 --> 22:14.985
You know, does this guy say that all vaccines are dumb?

22:15.005 --> 22:17.065
Has this guy said all vaccines are dumb?

22:17.446 --> 22:19.506
Has this guy said all vaccines are dumb?

22:19.867 --> 22:23.628
Has this ranch owner in Austin, Texas said all vaccines are dumb?

22:24.188 --> 22:25.449
And of course they haven't.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.251
They only say it behind the scenes.

22:30.291 --> 22:31.691
They only say it when it's safe.

22:31.731 --> 22:36.433
And they've only said it when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.149
You got to get your children out of social media while you can.

22:45.230 --> 22:51.612
It's really imperative that they understand that social media cannot be used to find reality.

22:51.652 --> 22:53.493
It can be used to communicate with your friends.

22:53.513 --> 22:59.696
You know, you can have a team app where you can get your schedule and you can know who's going to show up at practice and stuff.

22:59.736 --> 23:00.576
I guess that's fine.

23:04.172 --> 23:10.956
Because otherwise, you turn your consciousness over to a team of performers with elaborate costumes in effect.

23:11.396 --> 23:23.142
They can be all on the same script, and they can bamboozle you about things that are happening in the Middle East, or the things that are happening in the UFO story, or the things that are happening in the White House.

23:26.735 --> 23:34.921
And then what happens is this narrative is controlled in such a way so that the vast majority of people come to accept things that weren't real.

23:35.641 --> 23:39.524
Accept circumstances that are oversimplified or exaggerated.

23:40.985 --> 23:42.366
And then they move on from there.

23:42.986 --> 23:46.569
And then they accept another set of poor premises and they move on from there.

23:47.189 --> 23:51.853
And specifically what these people were put in place is to make sure no useful resistance

23:52.793 --> 23:56.955
to the rollout of transfection occurred until it was already over.

23:58.795 --> 24:04.397
Until the murder could be as safely stopped in 2022.

24:04.598 --> 24:13.321
And that's why if you look at the track record of any of these people before 2022, you can see the performance in real time.

24:14.673 --> 24:21.956
The idea that Kevin, worst case scenario, McCairn was saying it's worst case scenario in 2020 because a billion people might die.

24:22.496 --> 24:29.679
And in 2024, he was saying that it's worst case scenario because everybody's going to get amyloid or have a prion disease.

24:30.159 --> 24:41.384
And he's still saying that now in the middle of 2025, he's still telling stories about prion disease, curiously enough, using papers that are published by Indian scientists.

24:43.345 --> 24:47.026
And they're really shitty papers, really shittily written papers.

24:47.107 --> 24:54.149
It's remarkable the kind of nonsense that this has boiled down to.

24:56.730 --> 25:06.054
That these five people saying that there's no virus have all gotten books and they all act real sweet and they play all this shitty music behind themselves.

25:06.534 --> 25:10.676
This Bailey girl is one of the worst people on the planet.

25:12.338 --> 25:15.339
I think her husband is actually embarrassed that they took the job.

25:15.719 --> 25:19.701
And if you watch him and all of these podcasts, he's always the reluctant participant.

25:19.721 --> 25:23.503
He can barely eke out a smile, but she loves it.

25:27.745 --> 25:29.626
This lady I think loved it a lot too.

25:29.706 --> 25:39.431
She was really, I don't know, maybe they just used her name, but all the emails that I ever got from these people while I was working for CHD and I was supposed to be like helping CHD.

25:39.631 --> 25:50.196
I was trying to get CHD and the no virus people to come to realize that the national security state could lie about this by just using recombinant DNA and RNA and putting it in places.

25:50.276 --> 25:55.039
But neither CHD and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker

25:55.659 --> 25:57.060
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:57.100 --> 26:02.542
were able to digest that idea, and also the no-virus people were unable to digest that idea.

26:03.243 --> 26:07.585
And Kevin McCarran was unable to digest that idea.

26:07.665 --> 26:13.688
And if he's digesting that idea now, it's only because they have changed his script enough to allow it.

26:15.165 --> 26:22.067
because this shithead in 2020 was saying, just it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.908
And in 2024, the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

26:26.989 --> 26:29.109
And in 2025, he's still saying it.

26:30.109 --> 26:34.271
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.411
You can capture it.

26:35.471 --> 26:36.351
You can sequence it.

26:36.391 --> 26:38.572
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

26:38.812 --> 26:54.566
And of course, he's working with Charles Rixey for a couple years, who that guy, who you just heard, who says that the RNA is real, you can capture it, you can sequence it, and you can put it in places and recapitulate disease.

26:55.146 --> 26:59.527
That guy is the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project.

26:59.567 --> 27:02.088
His dad worked on microarrays.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.649
His brothers have cancer companies.

27:05.109 --> 27:08.230
This guy is one of the biggest shitheads in America.

27:08.330 --> 27:21.795
One of the worst traitors in America because for the last six years he has been performing on podcasts using his script, Robert Malone's script, and promoting people like Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass and

27:22.535 --> 27:36.125
Andrew Kaufman and the NoVirus people by saying their names out loud, performing as part of Steve Kirsch's steering committee, performing in front of some state assemblies with John Bodwin.

27:36.205 --> 27:47.274
This man is a fraud because any warning that he's giving you now could have been given in 2020 and it could have been given much more forcefully, much more simply

27:48.499 --> 27:58.981
like we're trying to do now, but he didn't because he is still exhibiting this spectacular commitment to the lies that they have perpetuated from the beginning of the pandemic.

28:01.922 --> 28:04.363
And this is all about the Human Genome Project.

28:04.543 --> 28:13.585
That's how you understand why Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan have all come together under CHD.

28:15.418 --> 28:28.842
You know, some random doctor from Maine that's tangled with Steve Hatfill and Robert Malone over anthrax vaccines is now working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:28.862 --> 28:33.983
and Mary Holland, a lady who says that some component of the MMR hurt her son.

28:34.043 --> 28:37.984
She's just a, you know, some Columbia professor, is it?

28:38.384 --> 28:38.725
I don't know.

28:38.765 --> 28:42.486
She spent a few years in Russia, so it's hard for me to remember where she got her degree.

28:43.126 --> 28:43.506
Anyway,

28:46.058 --> 28:47.158
These people aren't real.

28:47.539 --> 28:52.521
Mary Holland is not a real lawyer with like real legal ideas on how to win this.

28:52.681 --> 28:56.562
Come on, that's a, that's like a, that's a really bad joke.

29:04.825 --> 29:05.826
That's how we got here.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.247
These people are how we got here.

29:08.327 --> 29:10.828
And you can see it by their, their track record.

29:10.868 --> 29:11.588
I apologize.

29:11.608 --> 29:13.949
This is not, this is not ideal.

29:23.223 --> 29:23.864
That might be better.

29:23.884 --> 29:27.370
I mean, we have Steve Bannon, who's absolutely fake.

29:28.912 --> 29:30.234
This guy lies for a living.

29:30.254 --> 29:34.641
He used to work for, you know, the Goldman Sachs, for goodness sakes.

29:36.395 --> 29:41.117
He knew that it was a lab leak in January of 2020, so that's impossible.

29:41.277 --> 29:46.460
He also had Steve Hatfill on his War Room podcast in January of 2025.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.280
That's impossible.

29:48.761 --> 29:51.582
And he was also saying that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:51.602 --> 29:53.663
should be vice president way earlier.

29:55.063 --> 29:56.384
than anybody could have.

29:56.544 --> 30:18.009
And remember, of course, his very good friend, in his own words, a genius, Tony Lyons, is the guy who runs the Skyhorse Publishing, where they published a book with Jesse Ventura called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, where the epilogue is a story about how Jesse Ventura takes Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former independent presidential candidate, as his

30:18.851 --> 30:22.617
freaking vice president and then gets shot so that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:22.657 --> 30:23.519
becomes president.

30:23.940 --> 30:28.287
And that's really eerily similar to what happened this past year and a half with

30:29.013 --> 30:30.454
with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:30.514 --> 30:31.235
and Donald Trump.

30:31.875 --> 30:47.747
And of course, that guy along with Brett Weinstein was also saying, you know, hopefully Donald, I mean, he's got a devoted video on his website for, you know, hopefully Donald Trump will see that we can unite America by making Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

30:47.787 --> 30:49.188
your vice presidential candidate.

30:49.208 --> 30:53.271
And then like three days later, they gave him J.D.

30:53.311 --> 30:53.651
Vance.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.042
So this is all one big show.

30:57.102 --> 30:59.325
It's all a cat-herding exercise.

30:59.865 --> 31:01.507
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:01.567 --> 31:02.509
is just this dude.

31:03.910 --> 31:13.862
I don't think he ever wanted to fight for vaccine-injured kids or the justice that their parents deserve any more than he wanted to, I don't know, clean up the water.

31:14.878 --> 31:18.004
Maybe he kind of is a naturalist and cares a little bit about nature.

31:18.044 --> 31:25.177
I'm willing him to give him that, but the idea that he wanted to put his, you know, all of his career and his political clout behind these

31:27.188 --> 31:39.253
these vaccine-injured kids is only done, was only done because he knew that he had the support of such a team of people provided by I don't know who, I guess the U.S.

31:39.293 --> 31:47.576
government in some way or another, put Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker and Del Bigtree,

31:48.516 --> 32:08.187
and all these shitheads in place and not all of them have to know how they're being used but all of them are shitheads at this point because all of them in more than a decade and a half have made no progress in their messaging when the messaging is really very simple RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is absurd

32:10.112 --> 32:12.735
And these are old, old technologies.

32:12.815 --> 32:19.622
And what makes it so curious about being old technologies is the intellectual property thing.

32:21.024 --> 32:25.068
And also the idea that that the FDA should regulate it.

32:26.539 --> 32:32.560
And so they have avoided the regulation by the FDA of two very specific things.

32:32.620 --> 32:39.121
That of PCR testing as a diagnostic completely got in during the pandemic and we have all come to accept it.

32:39.161 --> 32:41.282
All the corporate hospitals have come to accept it.

32:41.802 --> 32:49.303
Yet the FDA has never evaluated any of this methodology and it should be evaluating each instance of it.

32:50.964 --> 32:52.244
Think about that for a second.

32:53.075 --> 33:01.019
It's like during the pandemic, we decided that all cars in Pennsylvania are safe and we don't need to inspect any cars anymore.

33:01.919 --> 33:03.840
And because it's dangerous.

33:04.260 --> 33:12.684
And so then since there was no increase in accidents, we've decided that after the pandemic's over, we're just gonna not inspect cars anymore.

33:12.724 --> 33:19.047
And that might be a bad example, but it is not that dissimilar to

33:20.558 --> 33:24.859
For the pandemic, the FDA stepped aside and didn't regulate things for a while.

33:25.800 --> 33:34.422
And then now the pandemic is kind of over, so the FDA could go back and look at what it didn't regulate and see if there's anything they should step in on.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.783
It could recheck, it could catch up.

33:37.463 --> 33:53.303
But instead, what we're doing is only moving forward with these different modes of acceleration, with these different ways of getting rid of the usual testing requirements, including moving on with some kind of AI stuff, you know, like the domain program or something, I guess.

33:54.224 --> 34:12.701
to get rid of animal testing and do toxicity by AI which is an extraordinary thing to be talking about when at the beginning of the pandemic there are numerous instances of this man and that guy up there and probably even Tony Fauci and other people saying that the FDA is in the way

34:17.003 --> 34:23.664
when his father and his father were intimately involved in updating the FDA during the time of Estes Kefauver.

34:23.724 --> 34:26.945
The history here is frickin' extraordinary.

34:28.646 --> 34:44.609
So my friend Joe Marshall of the Liberty Perspective sent me a link here that he found on the internet, tobacco-related disease research program with Robert Malone, MD, the University of Maryland Cancer Center,

34:46.002 --> 34:54.991
and an award, it's a new investigator award in 1995, gene augmentation therapy for tobacco induced emphysema.

34:55.071 --> 35:09.806
So what he's talking about there is cancer induced by tobacco use and gene augmentation therapy, which would be transfection of those cells in order to, you know, cure the cancer, I guess.

35:16.741 --> 35:29.790
Now it's curious to me that only an intellectual person like Joe, who I know is working diligently on this and trying to help and sends me useful things all the time.

35:31.951 --> 35:36.614
It's just disappointing to me, I'll be really honest, that Joe is the guy who sent me this.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.576
Because you don't even need to find this.

35:39.676 --> 35:41.117
You could just go to PubMed.

35:43.154 --> 36:02.351
And if you just go to PubMed and you put in Robert Malone, Malone-RW, just like I tell you to do, Cooey-JJ, and transfection, you'll get a whole list of articles that contain the keyword transfection and have an author that is Robert Wallace Malone.

36:03.472 --> 36:04.893
Now, if we do this together,

36:07.125 --> 36:10.206
If we go directly to the website, this is the website, okay?

36:10.226 --> 36:12.346
So I've got the, it's live now, you can see that.

36:12.466 --> 36:15.707
And you put the name in, you're gonna get this list and you can just scroll down.

36:16.267 --> 36:19.568
You can change this to be the one that's the oldest.

36:20.208 --> 36:24.148
And so I found the one that is the most recent is 2004.

36:24.569 --> 36:30.690
Electroporation enhances transfection efficiency in marine cutaneous wounds.

36:31.290 --> 36:35.831
And of course, marine, we know from Mark's work on the marine viruses that

36:36.531 --> 36:38.352
that Judy Mikovits is doing.

36:38.412 --> 36:39.392
Maureen is mouse.

36:40.172 --> 36:42.613
And so they do mouse skin wounds.

36:43.333 --> 36:48.055
And then they're looking at electroporation and whether it enhances the transfection efficacy.

36:48.455 --> 36:50.256
And the second author is Robert Malone.

36:50.476 --> 37:01.479
And his affiliation is with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

37:01.499 --> 37:02.380
It's very interesting.

37:04.249 --> 37:07.290
And so I thought I'd show you this.

37:09.630 --> 37:17.692
Again, if you're on PubMed and you can't get the article, you gotta go to this website.

37:18.032 --> 37:22.153
I don't know how long this website's gonna be up, but it works very well.

37:23.374 --> 37:28.615
If you're not aware of this website, please take this down and bookmark it.

37:29.857 --> 37:37.644
What this allows you to do is you can just drop in the title even, as you see above my head.

37:38.144 --> 37:42.968
And if you drop in that title, you're just gonna get the, it'll just come up.

37:44.511 --> 37:47.714
And so then you can save this and read this PDF.

37:47.814 --> 37:51.076
You can send this PDF to me and I don't have to look it up.

37:51.176 --> 37:53.458
I don't need to go through two links.

37:53.979 --> 37:56.180
And you can share an article with me.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.482
Not a link, but an article.

37:57.602 --> 37:59.223
You can do that for a lot of things.

37:59.263 --> 38:01.124
You can take the DOI and do it.

38:01.164 --> 38:02.486
You can take the title and do it.

38:03.526 --> 38:05.807
A lot of different combinations will generally work.

38:06.467 --> 38:11.169
So I thought it would be cool to look at this paper as a quick little journal club because it's just cute.

38:12.209 --> 38:20.092
Again, electroporation enhances transfection efficacy, efficiency, excuse me, in marine cutaneous wounds.

38:20.813 --> 38:26.595
And so transfection of wounds, let me see if I can make this, do I have it open already?

38:26.635 --> 38:27.995
I think I have it open already.

38:29.216 --> 38:30.116
I have it open already.

38:31.798 --> 38:47.765
no okay so anyway i wanted to read this a little bit they are talking about transfection of course and in this case they're doing dna in this uh thing they also have a a molecule called luciferase in there and luciferase is a glow-in-the-dark molecule

38:48.467 --> 38:52.949
a fluorescent molecule so that they can track whether or not protein expression is occurring.

38:53.549 --> 39:06.054
And so they can put the DNA naked onto the wound and then come back in a few days and there'll be some glow-in-the-dark protein there because the DNA will get taken up by the wound and the cells in the wound and be expressed.

39:06.814 --> 39:17.438
And so the idea is to see if they could use electroporation

39:18.499 --> 39:22.786
to increase transfection efficiency at the wound.

39:22.866 --> 39:24.529
So they're not even doing anything

39:29.704 --> 39:32.106
They don't even have a hypothesis about what to do.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.188
And so here's what I mean.

39:34.568 --> 39:42.474
If you read the first part of the paper, exogenous application of growth factors has been shown to have the potential to improve wound healing.

39:42.895 --> 39:49.060
However, the requirement for frequent dosing because of the short half-life of delivered peptides, that's proteins,

39:50.154 --> 39:52.357
has limited their clinical efficacy.

39:52.437 --> 40:01.547
Gene therapy with growth factor encoding DNA may allow the continuous production of these factors within wounds to encourage healing.

40:02.268 --> 40:08.375
So he's talking about transfection with DNA to express growth factors.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.292
to increase wound healing.

40:11.312 --> 40:15.797
It's like a little, I guess like a X-Men kind of thing.

40:16.338 --> 40:26.650
Skin is an attractive potential target for gene therapy due to its accessibility for application and monitoring and the possibility of removing tissue if necessary.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.211
Like, you know, if it goes cancerous.

40:29.167 --> 40:45.270
So although virally mediated gene delivery has high transfection efficiency, so here I think he's being a little imprecise because viral delivery of genes and DNA would be generally called transformation, I think.

40:46.050 --> 40:56.992
But for the sake of me being a winner, his use of transfection for all of this and only transformation in bacteria

40:59.300 --> 41:11.124
even underscores more the fact that apparently, according to Robert Malone, I would be very right, that this is an old suite of methodologies that would have never been appropriate for healthy humans.

41:12.024 --> 41:17.225
The only reason why anybody took it is because these people efficiently lied about it, almost renamed it.

41:20.006 --> 41:25.968
And so an effective means of increasing transfection efficiency may allow for a reduction in the amount of DNA required.

41:26.909 --> 41:30.712
to reduce the clinical effect and significantly improve the therapeutic impact.

41:30.732 --> 41:36.216
So electroporation has been commonly used for delivery of DNA in vitro cells since the 80s.

41:36.877 --> 41:44.063
Electroporation is the application of electrical field across cells in order to permealize the cell membrane to allow the entry of macromolecules.

41:46.109 --> 41:58.462
And so the materials and methods here, what they're going to do is they're going to use this glow-in-the-dark protein to see if they can get more glow-in-the-dark expression of the DNA if they use electroporation, okay?

42:00.120 --> 42:07.043
In other words, there are no plasmids with growth factors in here, right?

42:07.504 --> 42:12.626
They're just testing the methodology of can we get more protein to be made.

42:12.746 --> 42:16.928
And the way they're going to monitor the protein being made is with the glow-in-the-dark protein.

42:16.968 --> 42:25.032
They're not putting anything in here that's going to make the mice or they're not hypothesizing by putting anything in here that's going to make the mice heal.

42:25.832 --> 42:27.093
We can check that to make sure.

42:28.333 --> 42:29.094
Plasmids

42:31.312 --> 42:31.414
Um...

42:34.022 --> 42:46.906
The plasmid GWIZ-LUX, containing the CMV promoter, that's cytomegalovirus promoter, and luciferase transgene, was obtained by Gene Therapy Systems in San Diego, California.

42:47.426 --> 42:52.027
The plasmids were purified using an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit.

42:52.107 --> 43:00.770
So they are telling you here that what they did was they ordered a plasmid from a company, and then they made a lot of it,

43:01.909 --> 43:03.450
by growing it in bacteria.

43:03.550 --> 43:11.257
And so since they grew it in bacteria and then broke those bacteria open to get the DNA out, they would be contaminated with endotoxins.

43:11.277 --> 43:17.722
So they have to use an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit from Kaijin in order to

43:19.023 --> 43:23.448
following the culture and transformed DH5-alpha bacteria.

43:23.508 --> 43:30.755
So again, they grow the plasmid that they bought in the store in a DH5-alpha bacteria culture.

43:30.775 --> 43:40.324
And then when they lyse the culture to take the now very large quantity of DNA out, they have to purify it using a plasmid purification kit.

43:40.344 --> 43:42.206
So understand something very clear.

43:43.427 --> 43:51.229
There is no difference between this methodology and the production of the mRNA for whatever these guys are calling the COVID shots.

43:52.769 --> 44:09.572
They made an RNA construct, well actually a DNA construct, in bacteria in high quantities and then needed to purify that from the endotoxin, which is doable.

44:10.133 --> 44:11.953
And then they converted that to RNA

44:13.888 --> 44:16.790
And then they needed to purify that RNA, which is not doable.

44:18.932 --> 44:22.274
And this is the same technology.

44:23.175 --> 44:28.278
It's a paper from 2004 with Robert Malone on it.

44:33.735 --> 44:36.976
And so what they're going to do is they're going to express this protein.

44:37.536 --> 44:40.677
This shows you how stupid this paper is, right?

44:41.198 --> 44:48.480
This square wave electroporation characteristics in figure two shows you exactly how fake this paper is.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.721
This is really bad.

44:50.321 --> 44:57.563
Because this would be like saying, we're working on automobiles, and here's a general diagram of a car.

44:58.023 --> 45:02.305
And the arrows point to the hood, the wheels, and the doors.

45:04.471 --> 45:09.434
It's like, seriously, you needed to have a figure to tell us what you were gonna do with your electroporation?

45:09.494 --> 45:10.295
Nobody cares.

45:10.975 --> 45:13.157
Except Robert Malone.

45:13.457 --> 45:14.298
Why would he care?

45:14.378 --> 45:31.569
Well, because the animals were electroporated at the site of injection within two minutes of plasmid administration using a square wave electroporator, EMC 830 BTX from Genotronics in San Diego, California.

45:33.095 --> 46:01.690
GeneTronics, if I, you know, I Google GeneTronics, it's so weird because I get this article that says, San Diego and Oslo, Norway, 2000, January 26th in 2005, GeneTronics Biomedical Corporation, late stage developer of oncology and other therapies using electroporation to deliver drugs and nucleic acids announced today the acquisition of Oslo-based Inovio AS, a leader in patented gene delivery technology.

46:02.290 --> 46:06.794
for the most efficient non-viral method for gene transfer to skeletal muscles.

46:06.894 --> 46:07.815
Holy shit!

46:09.596 --> 46:14.481
Gene transfer to skeletal muscles sounds like intramuscular electroporation.

46:16.903 --> 46:20.286
That sounds like an even worse idea than intramuscular injection.

46:25.188 --> 46:31.532
It sounds like the future technology that, you know, Robert Malone might be very interested in approving on the ACIP.

46:32.213 --> 46:45.082
It includes cash in Inovio's treasury of approximately $775,000 and approximately 2 million in current and anticipated appropriations for biodefense research for the U.S.

46:45.222 --> 46:47.584
Army and for other committed grants.

46:51.354 --> 47:00.117
Now, of course, intramuscular electroporation for application to vaccines and immunotherapy is scary as shit to me.

47:05.899 --> 47:07.699
But of course, this is Robert Malone, right?

47:07.779 --> 47:19.903
And you would know that if you went to Heucytonics page and you went to the G's and you went down here and you went to GeneTronic and you opened it up.

47:21.963 --> 47:22.903
And it would be right here.

47:24.124 --> 47:29.746
And you would be able to follow these links and find out that, you know, he knew this a while ago.

47:29.986 --> 47:40.571
Mark Kulak knew this a while ago that, you know, this company was actually called Biotechnologies and Experimental Research, BTX, before it changed its name to GeneTronics.

47:43.641 --> 47:56.468
So every time I think I'm finding something interesting, well not every time, but sometimes I find that Mark has already found it and already archived it and maybe didn't even bother to tell me because he wasn't really sure whether it was significant or not.

47:56.488 --> 48:06.114
But I assure you that every paper that Robert Malone has on his transfection resume is evidence that he is central

48:07.250 --> 48:20.933
This whole charade where they're taking old technology and renaming it, repurposing it, reinventing it so that people accept it and accept the apparent unknown shortcomings.

48:23.054 --> 48:27.355
That's why Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are so important to this narrative.

48:30.855 --> 48:32.556
It's really important that you see that.

48:35.427 --> 48:36.468
I can't stress it enough.

48:36.548 --> 48:42.072
Ladies and gentlemen, I did promise you that we would pick up where we left off yesterday.

48:42.092 --> 48:44.054
This is for all the marbles.

48:44.094 --> 48:45.675
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

48:45.695 --> 48:48.477
That's why there's a fake anti-vax health freedom movement.

48:49.298 --> 49:01.007
And in this fake anti-vax health freedom movement, of course, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of Health and Human Services, the secretary of Health and Human Services, was just on the Tucker Carlson Bonanza show.

49:01.987 --> 49:08.973
And he opened with this idea that there are drug houses in America being run by the Chinese mafia.

49:10.154 --> 49:12.436
But is very aspecific about what's going on.

49:12.496 --> 49:17.701
And certainly at this point, blaming things on China is starting to become old to me.

49:17.761 --> 49:27.909
Because from the very beginning, I had people like Piper Stover and others trying to tell me that I needed to focus on China because they didn't have any morals and they were going for artificial life.

49:28.009 --> 49:29.510
Or was it Craig Ventner?

49:29.651 --> 49:29.991
I don't know.

49:30.451 --> 49:33.173
But it's all, it's all gotta be smoke and mirrors.

49:33.233 --> 49:37.337
I don't trust anything that any of those people have told me in the last five years.

49:37.397 --> 49:43.021
And one of the things that was very consistent that I was told was that the only thing we had to worry about was China.

49:45.843 --> 49:55.791
I'm gonna escape out of here, close this and start the movie externally so that it plays correctly and I can control it with the,

49:57.426 --> 49:59.588
with the mouse, if you don't mind.

50:02.489 --> 50:03.470
Why are you being a pain?

50:07.252 --> 50:08.673
Come on now, don't be a pain.

50:13.856 --> 50:14.937
Oh, I'm on the wrong screen.

50:15.037 --> 50:16.398
I see why it's being a pain.

50:18.559 --> 50:19.019
Here we go.

50:19.059 --> 50:20.440
This is where we left off yesterday.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.421
Thanks for being here guys.

50:21.701 --> 50:26.484
And you know, there's a new version of the COVID vaccine that just came out.

50:28.223 --> 50:34.604
that was approved by FDA and that vaccine is going to actually do real clinical trials.

50:34.724 --> 50:41.426
And it's being given to people who are 65 years older or have profound comorbidities.

50:43.626 --> 50:48.667
But the agreement with the company is that everybody who takes it will be part of a clinical trial.

50:48.747 --> 50:50.607
So we'll actually get some real data.

50:50.647 --> 50:53.508
And as you know, there was just data chaos with the other

50:55.251 --> 50:55.732
vaccine.

50:55.772 --> 50:59.294
In fact, you know, the Pfizer vaccine.

50:59.515 --> 51:02.217
Everybody who takes it will be part of the clinical trial.

51:02.277 --> 51:03.198
He just said it.

51:03.218 --> 51:06.380
I mean, it's too easy.

51:06.420 --> 51:09.543
You can just hear it if you listen.

51:10.263 --> 51:18.670
When it came out, it had a higher all-cause mortality.

51:18.690 --> 51:20.912
So more people died in the placebo group.

51:21.273 --> 51:24.095
I mean, more people died in the vaccine group than in the placebo group.

51:25.901 --> 51:29.104
I had 20,000 people who got the vaccine, 20,000 who didn't.

51:29.624 --> 51:39.852
And after six months, they looked at it and there was 23% more deaths in the vaccinated group from all causes than in the placebo group.

51:40.012 --> 51:49.880
And the efficacy was kind of dubious because there was only two people who died from COVID in the placebo group.

51:51.395 --> 51:52.817
And there was one person who died.

51:52.837 --> 51:58.982
Well, data set they were looking at, and so they said, you remember, they were saying the vaccine is 100 percent effective.

51:59.002 --> 52:04.067
Well, that's why they were saying it, because there was a there was two, two is 100 percent of one, right?

52:04.087 --> 52:05.769
100 percent larger than one.

52:05.949 --> 52:06.910
So that but that's what they had.

52:06.930 --> 52:08.872
But they were telling the American people it's 100 percent effective.

52:08.892 --> 52:10.493
And that when people heard that, they thought,

52:11.454 --> 52:17.518
If you get the vaccine, you can't get COVID, which of course, now we realize, now everybody realizes it was wrong, because everybody got COVID, whether they got the vaccine or not.

52:18.618 --> 52:26.603
And, you know, what they really should have been telling people is that in order to prevent one death from COVID, you had to give 19,999 vaccines.

52:27.724 --> 52:31.686
If any of those vaccines were killing people, you would cancel out the effect of, you know, the beneficial effect.

52:31.706 --> 52:37.369
Do you think the COVID, I mean, net, as we say in business, just kidding, do you think overall the COVID vaccine killed more than it saved?

52:37.890 --> 52:39.611
My opinion about that is irrelevant.

52:40.675 --> 53:02.251
what we're gonna try to do is make a science available so the public and look at the science and i would not say one way or the other and the truth is i don't know and what the reason i don't know is because uh... the studies that were done by my agency were substandard and they were not designed to answer that question and there's been a lot of obfuscation about on about covering up uh... as you know about suppressing any kind of uh...

53:03.359 --> 53:04.341
discussion of vaccine injuries.

53:04.381 --> 53:05.623
I mean, Mark Zuckerberg.

53:06.365 --> 53:14.240
One of the easiest ways to debunk this idea that everybody got COVID is that that premise is no different than it was always there.

53:15.501 --> 53:20.644
that there's just a irreducibly complex background that they're claiming is evidence of spread.

53:20.744 --> 53:32.591
So when somebody says that everybody got COVID, that is absolutely intellectually undifferentiable from they're already have been there because we didn't test for anything before 2020.

53:33.011 --> 53:36.433
They have no data to support that idea.

53:36.994 --> 53:43.498
Publicly said that he was ordered by the White House to suppress anybody on his platform on Facebook or Instagram.

53:44.485 --> 53:45.586
who mentioned vaccine injuries.

53:46.046 --> 53:51.228
Oh, he was ordered by the Biden administration to, and he said, you know, I, he said, I was stunned.

53:51.288 --> 53:53.509
I was being ordered by the federal government to deny facts.

53:54.870 --> 53:56.370
Anybody can look him up on YouTube saying that.

53:56.591 --> 54:05.475
So, and we know that too, because I sued the Biden administration and we got all this discovery documents that show that he was 37 hours after he took the oath of office, swearing to uphold the constitution,

54:06.656 --> 54:13.578
He opened up a group in the White House whose job it was to suppress any dissent about this government policy.

54:14.959 --> 54:16.679
And I was the first person that they went after.

54:16.699 --> 54:21.581
37 hours after he took that oath, they were telling Facebook to take me off of Instagram, which Facebook did.

54:22.461 --> 54:25.382
I had almost a million followers, and there was no vaccine misinformation on there.

54:26.102 --> 54:28.283
I asked Facebook again and again, show me one fact I got wrong.

54:29.063 --> 54:34.225
Everything I put on there that was vaccine related was cited and sourced in government databases or to peer-reviewed publications.

54:35.425 --> 54:47.332
and uh but they were you know it was not uh it wasn't uh misinformed the word in fact they had to invent a new word which is because facebook was saying to the white house this isn't misinformation it's actually true and the white house

54:48.396 --> 54:49.457
said, well, it's malinformation.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.180
Malinformation, this is an Orwellian kind of construct.

54:52.381 --> 54:57.466
And malinformation is information that is factually true, but it is nevertheless inconvenient for the government.

54:58.547 --> 55:01.731
And all the people who are now running this agency were censored.

55:02.011 --> 55:03.113
OJ Bhattacharya was censored.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.034
Marty McCary was censored.

55:04.054 --> 55:04.955
Dr. Oz was censored.

55:04.975 --> 55:05.996
Vinay Prasad was censored.

55:06.036 --> 55:06.556
We were all censored.

55:06.616 --> 55:07.077
I was censored.

55:07.237 --> 55:07.718
I remember well.

55:08.138 --> 55:16.582
What's the status of the... How were Marty McCary and Vinayak Prasad censored with their YouTube and stuff?

55:16.602 --> 55:19.143
Like, what does that even mean?

55:19.163 --> 55:21.684
I don't even... That is ridiculous.

55:21.964 --> 55:22.604
Oh my gosh.

55:22.624 --> 55:23.304
...vaccine pregnant women.

55:24.025 --> 55:26.126
The recommendation has been removed now for pregnant women.

55:27.326 --> 55:29.387
Are you satisfied that mRNA technology is safe for people?

55:29.687 --> 55:30.347
I'm not satisfied.

55:30.367 --> 55:36.130
You know, I can't... I'm not satisfied is the shittiest answer you could possibly give

55:37.290 --> 55:42.836
when you know that he had me as his scientific advisor for more than a year.

55:43.476 --> 55:47.861
Because you can bet dollars to donuts that I have told him all about transfection.

55:48.281 --> 55:52.145
And I told him all about that the moment I was allowed to speak to him.

55:54.227 --> 55:58.531
When I was asked by Brian Hooker, what do you want to do a podcast about with me?

55:58.671 --> 56:00.153
It was about transfection.

56:03.928 --> 56:16.458
So understand very well that Robert Malone is in place and advising this man to ignore me because transfection is a renamed shitty technology.

56:18.619 --> 56:24.504
And Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are at the heart of this absolute long con.

56:26.567 --> 56:29.590
You know, my opinion about that is irrelevant, but we will be doing those studies.

56:29.670 --> 56:39.338
And I would say there's a lot of skepticism in this agency about mRNA vaccines, you know, about mRNA technology, about the status of it now, about whether it's safe.

56:39.459 --> 56:49.087
And we do not, you know, the safety studies simply have not been done, but there's enough anecdotal reports of people getting profound injuries that may or may not be associated with it.

56:49.167 --> 56:50.468
And we're going to answer those questions.

56:51.229 --> 56:52.349
What happened with the vaccine board?

56:52.489 --> 56:55.630
I keep reading you fired all these eminent scientists on the vaccine board.

56:55.670 --> 56:56.690
Yeah, I fired all these what?

56:57.270 --> 56:59.091
All these important, highly credentialed scientists.

57:00.031 --> 57:03.992
Well, we fired that board because it was just an instrument.

57:04.012 --> 57:09.953
It was a sock puppet for the industry that it was supposed to regulate.

57:11.353 --> 57:12.553
And this was a long time coming, Tucker.

57:12.734 --> 57:12.814
In 2002,

57:15.336 --> 57:21.343
The Government Oversight Committee and the United States Congress held hearings about that board, which is called ASAP, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

57:22.484 --> 57:26.990
And they said that 97% of the people on that board had undisclosed conflicts.

57:28.388 --> 57:29.868
many of them that disclosed conflicts as well.

57:30.289 --> 57:38.131
Um, but they said that Congress said that it gave an example and said the rotavirus vaccine was approved by that board.

57:38.951 --> 57:40.452
And there were five members of that board.

57:40.592 --> 57:42.412
So it's remarkable that we're still going.

57:42.452 --> 57:54.956
Remember to Paul Offit and the rotavirus vaccine and the conflicts of interest that Paul Offit has, he can't come up with any other example, any more than Paul Offit can come up with any other example of an anti-vaxxer.

57:56.863 --> 58:00.385
It's always CHD and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:00.445 --> 58:00.865
That's it.

58:04.267 --> 58:08.929
And this guy can't come up with anybody else other than Paul Offit.

58:09.009 --> 58:12.751
And four of them had direct financial interests in the rotavirus vaccine.

58:13.731 --> 58:18.374
They were working for the companies that made the vaccine or they were receiving grants to do clinical trials on that vaccine.

58:18.534 --> 58:20.715
Four of them, but he's only going to mention one.

58:21.749 --> 58:23.310
They all had overwhelming financial interests.

58:24.110 --> 58:28.772
One of the people on that board was a guy called Paul Offit, and who is one of the big voices.

58:29.072 --> 58:33.354
Is he saying it like fricking Tucker doesn't know who it is?

58:34.314 --> 58:36.015
Can you see what's happening here?

58:37.375 --> 58:41.277
This video isn't for somebody that's been following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:41.317 --> 58:44.678
for four years or five years or six years or since vaxxed.

58:46.359 --> 58:49.220
This video is for people who are just trying to get to know him.

58:50.882 --> 58:52.942
for people who don't know who Robert Malone is.

58:53.903 --> 58:57.023
Otherwise, these two guys would be talking about their good friend by name.

58:58.523 --> 59:01.384
Vaccines that CNN goes to him all the time when it wants to know about vaccines.

59:02.604 --> 59:06.705
He voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to the schedule when he had a rotavirus vaccine in development.

59:07.665 --> 59:11.006
Because it's now on the schedule, his developing vaccine is virtually guaranteed to get on the schedule.

59:11.026 --> 59:16.567
It's a competitive product, but once you say rotavirus vaccine has to be vaccinated for, his vaccine is now guaranteed to get on the schedule.

59:16.587 --> 59:17.947
The one they voted on, that he voted on,

59:18.902 --> 59:30.716
within a year it had to be withdrawn because it was causing this really disastrous disease in kids that is often lethal called insusception, agonizingly painful when your intestines kind of tie up against each other and it kills children on occasion.

59:32.259 --> 59:34.722
That vaccine was pulled the following year and his vaccine then replaced him.

59:34.762 --> 59:35.542
He was still on the committee.

59:35.883 --> 59:38.125
He didn't vote on that, but he was still on the committee, but he voted to make.

59:38.425 --> 59:56.163
It's a really interesting story to tell because it seems like there's a lot of circumstantial evidence for the idea that DNA or RNA vaccines, DNA vaccines, most likely we're going to be brought in under the guise of an anthrax vaccine failure in the military.

59:57.148 --> 01:00:05.291
that the old anthrax vaccine is nasty and it hurts a lot of soldiers and we might need a new generation of anthrax vaccine.

01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:11.792
It sounds like Paul Offit pulled the same shit that Robert Malone tried but didn't get away with or something like that.

01:00:11.832 --> 01:00:12.993
I mean, it's bizarre.

01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:26.224
It's like a little mini shitty version of probably the real story behind the anthrax vaccine and the intention to use bioterrorism as an excuse to, to move to DNA based vaccines.

01:00:26.685 --> 01:00:28.967
And who else, who else came up with that?

01:00:29.007 --> 01:00:34.612
Who's, who's the only person who could have brought any of that information to light?

01:00:34.652 --> 01:00:35.253
It ain't me.

01:00:36.113 --> 01:00:36.574
It's Mark.

01:00:37.881 --> 01:00:47.547
It's not George Webb or Paul Cattrell or Kevin McCarran or Charles Rixey with his 3,000, you know, articles on an Excel sheet.

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:49.488
It's not Jessica Rose.

01:00:49.888 --> 01:00:51.269
It's not Kim Iverson.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.551
It's not fricking Shannon Joy.

01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:54.791
It's not Doc Malek.

01:00:56.733 --> 01:01:04.597
They're all on the same script that Robert Malone and Kevin McCarran gave them about the spike protein and COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

01:01:07.478 --> 01:01:14.820
Mark has been trying to get out of the cave by building a, a archive of these people and their connections.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:31.906
And this is ridiculous story in light of this whole anthrax vaccine, next generation vaccine thing that for the love of goodness, Merrill Nass, Robert Malone, and fricking Veera Sharma were all in the same call to Congress about in 2011.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.606
the coronavirus vaccine.

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:45.632
He and his business partners, Stanley Plotkin and a couple of other people sold that vaccine to Merck for $186 million.

01:01:47.053 --> 01:01:48.394
He told Newsweek that he won the lottery.

01:01:49.755 --> 01:01:51.356
It's been said of him that he voted himself rich.

01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:56.680
And that kind of conflict was typical on that committee, but that was the most... Did people know this was going on?

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.501
That's such an obvious conflict.

01:01:58.521 --> 01:02:03.184
The Office of Inspector General in this department investigated and they said, this is a disaster, you gotta change it.

01:02:04.145 --> 01:02:06.367
Congress investigated and said, you've got to change it, and they did nothing.

01:02:07.268 --> 01:02:15.577
The most glaring example of medical malpractice by this group is that they approved all these vaccines.

01:02:15.597 --> 01:02:19.241
We went from 11, remember, to 69 to 92, 11 vaccines in 86.

01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:22.584
And not one of them had, except for COVID, COVID is the only one,

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:27.310
and had a pre-licensing safety trial that involved a placebo, a true placebo.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:31.213
And so all of those other vaccines were ushered in without safety studies.

01:02:31.634 --> 01:02:34.196
And that means nobody understands the risk profile of those products.

01:02:34.497 --> 01:02:35.718
How can you do that?

01:02:35.778 --> 01:02:36.098
They did it.

01:02:36.238 --> 01:02:36.739
It's corruption.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:38.641
And it's because of agency capture.

01:02:39.702 --> 01:02:43.605
It's because the companies that were making these products said, if you can get your vaccine on the schedule,

01:02:44.606 --> 01:02:49.251
It's generally, typically about a billion dollars a year for your company, because you now have a trap market.

01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:50.112
With no downside.

01:02:50.192 --> 01:02:51.153
No downside.

01:02:51.193 --> 01:02:54.576
First of all, the federal government oftentimes actually designs the vaccines.

01:02:54.716 --> 01:02:55.777
NIH would design it.

01:02:56.698 --> 01:02:58.080
It would hand it over to the pharmaceutical company.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:04.046
The pharmaceutical company then runs it through ASIP and runs it first through FDA, then through ASIP and gets it recommended.

01:03:04.086 --> 01:03:08.010
If you can get that recommendation, you now got a billion dollars in leased revenues by the end of the year.

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:37.559
every year forever so um so there was you know there was a gold rush to add new vaccines to the schedule and this and asim never so stanley plotkin was the chief science offer officer of inovio and stanley plotkin is the author with with paul offett on this book vaccines like this very thick ridiculous book called vaccines is plotkin and offett

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.004
Robert Malone has ties to Plotkin and Offit.

01:03:46.365 --> 01:03:47.166
Come on.

01:03:48.347 --> 01:03:50.249
It's all one malevolent show.

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:51.851
Turned away a single vaccine.

01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:54.594
Everyone that came to them, they, you know, recommended.

01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:59.819
And a lot of these vaccines are for diseases that are not even casually contagious.

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:09.512
You know, how are you, you know, I mean, you know, they recommended the Hepatitis B vaccine for babies when they're an hour old, the first day of life, they get that.

01:04:09.592 --> 01:04:11.933
And you know, Hepatitis B, if your mother's got it, you should get it.

01:04:12.693 --> 01:04:14.614
And you can, you know, you can pass through maternal transmission.

01:04:15.554 --> 01:04:17.635
But every mother that goes to the hospital in this country is tested for it.

01:04:17.655 --> 01:04:19.636
So we know which ones, you know, are vulnerable, which aren't.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:23.677
Oh, but the mass vaccination of the entire population, including well children, this is a disease.

01:04:24.798 --> 01:04:28.059
You get through sexual transmission or you get it from sharing needles.

01:04:28.539 --> 01:04:33.001
And particularly, it was prevalent among promiscuous gay men.

01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:38.803
But a one-day-old baby, the risk to a one-day-old baby was one in seven million.

01:04:39.363 --> 01:04:40.283
Very few of whom are promiscuous.

01:04:40.684 --> 01:04:43.825
Very few of whom are involved in prostitution or drug addiction.

01:04:44.827 --> 01:04:48.188
So, you know, but it was a financial, they were all financial drivers.

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:55.231
So, and a lot of the diseases that they target are not disease, the vaccine itself does not prevent transmission.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.492
And so, you know, the justification.

01:04:58.612 --> 01:05:10.736
This is a line that somebody like James Lyons Weiler was saying in 2019, that there's asymptomatic transmission of viral diseases, which are vaccine preventable.

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:16.141
Because in the vaccinated people, these viruses are still being transmitted.

01:05:16.181 --> 01:05:23.927
This is a background signal that they are lying about and pretending that they have a high-fidelity understanding of how they move around.

01:05:25.248 --> 01:05:26.469
And who's claiming that?

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:32.775
Very specifically, people associated with CHD and the fake anti-vax movement.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:40.381
Like Brian Hooker who claimed it in a live stream in 2020 that COVID transmits asymptomatically.

01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:47.122
Like James Lyons-Weiler who's been on stage with Judy Mikovits and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:05:47.462 --> 01:05:49.263
and Brandi Vaughn at the same time.

01:05:52.343 --> 01:05:57.324
The reason why these people stick to this narrative is because it's been given to them.

01:05:58.484 --> 01:06:02.125
They are not sophisticated enough to understand its limitations.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.522
they have just been told that it's the winning bet.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:18.130
And so no matter how dumb it gets in light of what other people say, no matter how dumb it gets in light of what other people learn, they stick to the same shitty script.

01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:22.052
And once you see it, it is so gross.

01:06:22.152 --> 01:06:24.594
For having it mandated is very ephemeral.

01:06:25.914 --> 01:06:27.796
And, you know, these are all things that we need to look at.

01:06:28.657 --> 01:06:31.520
We want to protect public health, but, you know, that means protecting against chronic disease too.

01:06:31.701 --> 01:06:38.969
And, you know, these vaccines have, there's nobody who will contest that they cause, that they can cause chronic disease, chronic injuries that last a lifetime.

01:06:39.867 --> 01:06:47.891
So one of the reasons that the system has become so corrupt, I think it's fair to say, is Anthony Fauci, one of the longest-serving federal employees, who was the subject of one of the best-selling books a couple of years ago, which he wrote, the Real Anthony Fauci Amazing Book.

01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:53.454
And all this information about him was exposed to the world, and he gets some sign of cure at Georgetown and still has Secret Service protection.

01:06:53.494 --> 01:06:54.275
He seems to be thriving.

01:06:54.735 --> 01:06:55.996
He doesn't have Secret Service protection any longer.

01:06:56.316 --> 01:07:02.999
President Trump took that away from him, but he got immunity.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.361
Why did he need immunity?

01:07:05.741 --> 01:07:07.302
So, so far, we're selling the

01:07:08.615 --> 01:07:12.377
The Tony Fauci book, I mean, yeah, the Tony Fauci book, like I told you they would.

01:07:13.098 --> 01:07:15.319
Why did he need a pardon in advance?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.581
What do you think the answer is?

01:07:18.716 --> 01:07:23.917
I would be speculating, but I think he was vulnerable.

01:07:23.977 --> 01:07:27.258
I think he had a lot of liability on creating the coronavirus.

01:07:27.758 --> 01:07:33.780
He was funding precisely that research at the Wuhan lab, and he was giving them the technology.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:39.361
He was giving them not only the technology, the precise technology for developing that pathogen,

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:40.953
and published about it.

01:07:41.513 --> 01:07:47.815
And you know, the publications credit NIH for the, for the, for the, uh, uh, for the, for financing the studies.

01:07:47.835 --> 01:08:02.940
But he also gave them one of his fundees, Ralph Baric from the university of North Carolina developed a technique called a seamless ligation technique, which is a technique for hiding the laboratory origins of a, of a virus, of a manipulated virus.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:03.560
So that,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:17.568
That is the same technique that Kevin McKernan went on the Danny Jones podcast and lied about, but then also made a little bit of a slip and also called it Golden Gate Assembly.

01:08:20.849 --> 01:08:29.294
And so this idea that there's this special technology that only the fat virus baker named Ralph Baric figured out is bullshit.

01:08:30.302 --> 01:08:35.647
There are no special techniques that they use to assemble a coronavirus genome.

01:08:35.707 --> 01:08:44.234
They use standard human genome project methodologies to make large quantities of DNA.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:55.904
They cut them with restriction enzymes that have been cataloged over the last 30 years so that the ends go together the way they want to, and they assemble a genome.

01:08:57.185 --> 01:09:16.726
And using these techniques, they can make a large, synthetic, pure quantity of DNA that would never be possible in any other context and definitely is impossible to find or generate by natural means in the real world.

01:09:18.305 --> 01:09:34.407
Doesn't matter how many bats you have in a cage, you can never reach the purity of grams of a DNA construct except through these techniques which were developed by the Human Genome Project and used around the world

01:09:35.253 --> 01:09:39.598
by pharmaceutical companies that make biologics, but they don't stop at DNA.

01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:41.059
They don't stop at RNA.

01:09:41.119 --> 01:09:51.710
They make the protein and then they can remove the DNA and RNA using a process called anion exchange chromatography, which doesn't work to separate DNA from RNA.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:57.016
And so all of these shortcomings of trying to transfect people with an RNA was known.

01:09:58.174 --> 01:10:00.535
The impurity due to the manufacturer was known.

01:10:01.035 --> 01:10:06.076
The endotoxic endotoxins being a contaminant or a possible contaminant was known.

01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:10.177
The inability to separate the DNA from the plasmid, known.

01:10:11.937 --> 01:10:16.338
And nobody knew it better than Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan at the start of the pandemic.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.439
And that's why nobody could do the job that they did.

01:10:20.859 --> 01:10:22.800
And nobody can do the job that they're doing now.

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.511
Robert F Kennedy jr.

01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:46.029
Is on that stupid-ass script because he's not sophisticated enough to understand and I told him I've told him a couple times even once in an email, but if you're surrounded by Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Ryan Ryan Cole and Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey and and

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:52.397
Kevin McKernan and and Robert Malone and they all tell you that that guy's an asshole.

01:10:52.437 --> 01:10:55.620
He's a he's a shithead He yelled at me on the phone.

01:10:55.901 --> 01:10:57.322
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

01:10:57.362 --> 01:11:04.411
He's lost his mind and this guy is just a monkey He probably doesn't even remember my name anymore

01:11:06.004 --> 01:11:11.546
that normally, if there's a virus manipulated, you can look at it, you know, thought researchers can look at it, they can look at the DNA sequences.

01:11:12.407 --> 01:11:13.807
And they can say this thing was created in a lab.

01:11:15.388 --> 01:11:17.909
Ralph Baric had developed a technique that he called the no-seum technique.

01:11:18.269 --> 01:11:19.990
And its technical name was seamless ligation.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:23.071
And it was a way of hiding evidence of human tampering.

01:11:24.032 --> 01:11:27.473
What is the public health rationale?

01:11:27.573 --> 01:11:29.954
If you were interested in public health, you would want to be doing the inverse of that.

01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:31.095
You would want to be pinning red.

01:11:32.115 --> 01:11:33.296
Now, why is this stupid?

01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:39.532
It's stupid for one reason and one reason only that all biologists should understand.

01:11:40.933 --> 01:12:03.739
If you are making a construct that is supposedly going to be producing some 31 proteins in total during an infection, then the ligation technique that you use, the sequences that you glue together, and the restriction enzymes that you use to glue those things together will be chosen very meticulously.

01:12:05.825 --> 01:12:11.449
So that even though you're assembling this thing, you get the sequence that you want.

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:15.793
Not the sequence that, you know, well, we're sticking it together.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.255
So we have to have scotch tape here.

01:12:18.655 --> 01:12:20.417
And there has to be scotch tape here.

01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:22.478
And there has to be scotch tape here.

01:12:22.898 --> 01:12:32.286
And then when the DNA goes through the ribosome, or gets translated into RNA and then goes through the ribosome, the scotch tape doesn't get in the way.

01:12:33.581 --> 01:12:43.534
And that's impossible, of course, because we're talking about supposedly a live genome construct where every amino acid means something.

01:12:43.695 --> 01:12:49.843
Where four amino acids could be a fear and cleavage site that causes the virus to pandemic.

01:12:51.482 --> 01:12:58.168
And so, on one hand, we're talking about a seamless ligation technique that hides the... It doesn't hide anything.

01:12:58.548 --> 01:12:59.990
There's no special thing.

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:03.433
That's why Kevin McKernan called it Golden Gate Assembly.

01:13:03.793 --> 01:13:06.715
That's why he's calling it seamless ligation.

01:13:07.856 --> 01:13:10.178
It's just molecular biology.

01:13:11.059 --> 01:13:17.125
And the crazy part is, is all this molecular biology is derived from molecular biology of bacteria and their phages.

01:13:18.004 --> 01:13:23.228
It has nothing to do with using tools that we ourselves have in our own cells.

01:13:23.408 --> 01:13:29.172
We don't have a whole suite of restriction enzymes that we use all the time like bacteria do.

01:13:29.612 --> 01:13:30.433
Isn't that weird?

01:13:30.553 --> 01:13:32.574
And flags all to it and say this was created by people.

01:13:32.594 --> 01:13:35.256
That's what you would do if you're creating viruses for biological warfare.

01:13:35.756 --> 01:13:36.617
Right, that's right.

01:13:36.857 --> 01:13:38.718
And that's another question is why would he give it to the Chinese?

01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:40.199
I mean, that was a military lab.

01:13:40.259 --> 01:13:41.480
It was run by the military.

01:13:42.521 --> 01:13:44.202
It's hard to even understand that.

01:13:44.562 --> 01:13:45.483
What would be the rationale for doing that?

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:50.273
I, you know, I try not to look in other people's heads.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:54.356
I try, like in the Fauci book, I never look in and speculate about what his motives are.

01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:55.297
I just say this is what he did.

01:13:56.578 --> 01:14:16.511
But I do think that there's this, among a lot of the people who are doing that kind of research, the gain-of-function research, there are big career, economic, and professional incentives to break ground, to break new ground, and say, you know, I just, one of his fundees created an avian flu virus, which can be very deadly to humans if you can make it do human-to-human transition.

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:22.218
a transmission, and he developed one that could jump to mammals.

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:23.199
Why would you do that?

01:14:23.219 --> 01:14:25.422
You know, you're just, you're inviting a catastrophe.

01:14:25.782 --> 01:14:27.244
And they published it and bragged about it.

01:14:27.264 --> 01:14:36.255
And I think there's this kind of, this kind of, I don't know whether I would call it a God complex or something where, you know, some of the people in that field seem to have a

01:14:37.536 --> 01:14:43.800
This kind of gets some kind of sense of omnipotence or something from developing something that can kill all of humanity.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:46.362
But I don't know, that is sheer speculation.

01:14:46.622 --> 01:14:47.262
That sounds right to me.

01:14:47.803 --> 01:14:57.289
It's the same kind of speculation that underlies the wide acceptance of the existence and potential danger of nukes, right?

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:06.295
That I guess we imagine that some people derive a lot of power from baking a cherry bomb that can open a black hole.

01:15:07.353 --> 01:15:10.974
They want to see if they can do it, even if it means the destruction of humanity.

01:15:11.554 --> 01:15:19.257
And Ralph Baric is just really, you know, it's just an irresistible desire to make something that's so nasty just to see if he can do it.

01:15:19.837 --> 01:15:21.858
It's such a weird, dumb story to me.

01:15:22.038 --> 01:15:22.638
It really is.

01:15:23.718 --> 01:15:25.579
So it sounds like Fauci is beyond the reach of the law at this point.

01:15:27.176 --> 01:15:38.159
Yeah, I think generally, unless there was a truth commission, you know, which they did, and as you know, in South Africa, they did it in Central America after the, you know, the 1980s wars there.

01:15:38.179 --> 01:15:40.420
And they were very, very helpful to those societies.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.060
And, you know, I think we should probably do something like that now.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:47.962
And in those cases, what happens is you have a commission that hears testimony on what exactly happened.

01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:53.623
Anybody who comes and volunteers to justify truthfully is then given immunity from prosecution.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:16:03.308
So it sounds a little bit like what the NCI or something like that or they think they're going to roll out whistleblowers like the uh you know it's like the diffuse proposal or some shit like this is just terrible.

01:16:03.568 --> 01:16:05.349
It's such terrible shit.

01:16:05.849 --> 01:16:08.210
And but so that at least the public knows who did what.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:08.591
Yes.

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:16.895
And people who are called and don't take that deal and purge themselves they then can be uh they can be uh prosecuted.

01:16:18.277 --> 01:16:44.834
we have a track record of uh... revealing the truth in a timely manner as you know better than anybody president on january twenty third issued an executive order ordering the full declassification files related to the murder of your uncle father and martin luther king and um... you know if you can see all that work where is that process have your conclusions about any or all of those three murders changed on the base of the documents and i don't know i'm nothing change i mean you know as you know there's already millions pages documents out there and i think you know in

01:16:47.111 --> 01:16:52.515
In terms of my uncle's death, I think that, you know, that that ship has sailed.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:59.399
I don't think anybody who actually is willing to read the evidence now will question the fact that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.504
And that, in fact, Congress, in 1973, when the Church Committee looked at it, I think it was 73, the Church Committee, what, 75?

01:17:06.984 --> 01:17:08.906
The Church Committee, they said it was conspiracy.

01:17:08.926 --> 01:17:10.367
That was the conclusion of the Congressional Committee.

01:17:10.387 --> 01:17:16.411
So the Warren Committee that was run by Alan Dulles, who was, you know, had a lot of reasons to lie,

01:17:17.351 --> 01:17:18.192
and did lie throughout.

01:17:18.292 --> 01:17:21.215
And in fact, he said at one of the sessions, yeah, if we were involved in this, we would lie.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:22.056
Oh, he said that.

01:17:23.557 --> 01:17:25.780
And he and he got himself put on that committee.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.461
And he was really should have been called the Dulles Commission.

01:17:27.741 --> 01:17:30.945
You know, he said it's a single shooter is doing it.

01:17:30.965 --> 01:17:32.046
And, you know, in 75, that was 64.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:32.906
So 11 years later,

01:17:36.414 --> 01:17:38.575
Congress investigated, and they had a much larger purview.

01:17:38.595 --> 01:17:39.695
They had much more data at that time.

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:41.935
And they said it was a conspiracy.

01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:49.657
But since then, there's been a million documents released and probably 30 people who were involved and made confessions, including many of the prime actors.

01:17:50.758 --> 01:17:53.719
And so I don't think there is any doubt that my uncle was killed by conspiracy.

01:17:53.759 --> 01:17:57.800
My father is more difficult because we just don't have the data.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.660
It's never been investigated.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.082
And, you know, I've been trying to get it investigated.

01:18:01.102 --> 01:18:11.094
You know, one of the women who played potentially a key role in it was a woman in the polka dot dress who appeared to be Sir Hans Handler.

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:15.571
And that woman is living openly in Tarzana, California.

01:18:15.611 --> 01:18:16.411
Nobody's ever talked to her.

01:18:17.612 --> 01:18:25.914
And she, you know, people should, this should be investigated and people should talk to her and, you know, really investigate the crime.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:26.554
Thank you very much.

01:18:27.455 --> 01:18:34.056
So, and as you know, and I think I've talked to you about this before, that my father, you know, Sirhan was there.

01:18:34.097 --> 01:18:36.437
There were 77 eyewitnesses in the kitchen at the time.

01:18:36.477 --> 01:18:38.398
And he took two shots at my father.

01:18:39.437 --> 01:18:42.038
One of those shots hit Paul Schrader in the head, and Paul Schrader survived.

01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:47.300
And the other one hit the door jamb behind my father, and it was later removed by the LAPD.

01:18:48.121 --> 01:18:55.004
And then Sirhan was grabbed by six people, including Rayford Johnson, Rosie Greer, Carl Ulrich, who was the manager.

01:18:55.524 --> 01:18:57.485
Is this important to know, do you think?

01:18:57.565 --> 01:18:58.946
Is this really what we need?

01:18:59.726 --> 01:19:06.529
I mean, he just told us that it was a lab leak, that Tony Fauci's responsible, that we should have a truth commission.

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:35.444
It's pretty frightening really where we are and I don't know how to say it any other way I've had enough conversations with this guy in the presence of other people to know that he's heard the truth multiple times He's heard it multiple times All the shots hit people We know what happened every every shot this gun and my father was shot by four shots from behind One of them passed harmless the others were And that shot he

01:19:37.503 --> 01:20:01.777
and he was a, and my father fell down by the left, and the LAPD collected him, but we don't have the real thing, and then they never confiscated the gun from Cesar, and he was in Los Angeles, and he had a top security classification, you know the answers to them, you know, I was in, I was gonna go over there and talk to him, and he said,

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:05.558
about getting all the documents relevant to those three murders, those three assassinations.

01:20:05.578 --> 01:20:07.299
Are you confident that all of it will come out by the end of this term?

01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:10.460
I'm confident that President Trump will release anything that he has access to.

01:20:11.801 --> 01:20:13.881
But, you know, I don't expect anything groundbreaking.

01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:19.043
Are we going to go and figure out about this kid that came from our high school here locally?

01:20:19.884 --> 01:20:26.886
Are we going to find out what social networks he's on so I can make sure that my kid who goes to that high school now doesn't get involved in the same network?

01:20:30.174 --> 01:20:32.356
Are we going to remember that at all?

01:20:32.836 --> 01:20:36.619
Cause I remember it because they closed down the street right up here.

01:20:36.659 --> 01:20:39.121
I couldn't walk my dog the way I normally walk it.

01:20:40.082 --> 01:20:41.843
That's how close that shit happened here.

01:20:42.644 --> 01:20:46.967
And we haven't learned anything about that kid or his social media connections.

01:20:46.987 --> 01:20:51.771
You know, maybe he was, he was online flirting with Soph.

01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:52.631
I don't know.

01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:56.675
It come from those documents because first of all, with my uncle, we've already got everything.

01:20:56.695 --> 01:20:57.755
There may be little things like,

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:04.022
you know, the calendar for Bill Harvey, who was one of the people who was in the CIA, who was almost certainly involved.

01:21:04.122 --> 01:21:08.864
And other things, how he was recruited, et cetera.

01:21:09.404 --> 01:21:10.225
I guess I'll deliberate.

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:14.966
So last question, you left while you were born here, obviously your father's an attorney general of the United States when you were young.

01:21:15.407 --> 01:21:25.731
He's murdered in 1968, you leave Washington, you haven't lived- So no talk about what he did as attorney general, no talk about the changes made to the FDA while he was attorney general, no talk about how his,

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:40.998
You know, he's had Brett Weinstein on his show before, so it wouldn't be ridiculous for him to say, it's kind of cool that your dad appointed Brett Weinstein's dad to the Department of Justice and had so much to do with the modernization of the FDA.

01:21:41.038 --> 01:21:41.899
That's really cool.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.040
That's a cool history that you and Brett share.

01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:47.913
It's the same thing that him and Brett didn't talk about.

01:21:47.933 --> 01:21:48.453
That's right.

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:59.159
Bobby and Brett didn't talk about when they did a podcast together during the pandemic that was recorded in 2021, but didn't get released until February 23.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.641
They never talked about the fact that their dads work together.

01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:07.223
Isn't that weird?

01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:12.351
I'm talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:22:12.311 --> 01:22:17.414
's dad and Bret Weinstein's dad, and Bret Weinstein's dad is still alive.

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:22.437
Bret Weinstein's brother is still an advisor to Peter Thiel.

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:30.943
They're all part of the intellectual dark web that was started with the Shapiro guy and the Rubin guy and the Rogan guy and the Peterson guy.

01:22:33.024 --> 01:22:35.385
Those shitheads are all on the same team here.

01:22:35.425 --> 01:22:37.507
They're all sticking to this terrible narrative.

01:22:38.447 --> 01:22:54.093
They all assisted in the fake Trump shooting and the momentum on social media, the weeks afterward to figure out whether there was more than one shooter or not, or whether it was an inside job from the secret service because of all the buffoonery that they caught on video.

01:22:54.473 --> 01:22:58.134
Then this is all one malevolent show.

01:22:58.554 --> 01:23:02.136
And these two guys are in the same malevolent shitty script.

01:23:02.156 --> 01:23:04.857
If you're since you just came back as secretary, what's it like?

01:23:04.877 --> 01:23:05.357
What do you notice?

01:23:05.577 --> 01:23:06.057
What do you think of it?

01:23:07.028 --> 01:23:09.189
Well, you know, I didn't expect to love living in Washington.

01:23:09.209 --> 01:23:11.530
I, when I was a kid, I couldn't wait to get out of Washington.

01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:15.511
Um, but you know, I'm, my, my wife is happy here.

01:23:15.571 --> 01:23:21.633
We found kind of a community and a neighborhood and, um, the, I love the people that I'm working with at this agency.

01:23:21.713 --> 01:23:24.294
It's the most gifted, committed group of people that I've ever worked with.

01:23:24.514 --> 01:23:26.355
And they're, you know, immensely talented and committed.

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:28.896
And then I really liked the cabinet.

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:33.057
I think the, you know, president Trump's cabinet has put together an extraordinary cabinet on the,

01:23:34.395 --> 01:23:38.256
I'm friends with a number of the people I never thought I'd be friends with, but they're, you know... Who do you like?

01:23:39.877 --> 01:23:48.340
I mean, I really get along with Pam Bondi, and Cheryl loves Pam, and her husband John, and Marco Rubio.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.261
Marco Rubio is the funniest guy in the cabinet.

01:23:51.181 --> 01:23:53.842
He says things that make people belly laugh at every cabinet meeting.

01:23:55.222 --> 01:24:02.386
You know, I never was very, let's say, you know, I think very aligned with me on most issues.

01:24:02.406 --> 01:24:03.326
I can't do it.

01:24:03.766 --> 01:24:04.407
I can't do it.

01:24:04.427 --> 01:24:06.348
Just the fact that we should not be the policemen of the world anymore.

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:07.628
I can't do it anymore.

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:10.069
I can't listen to him anymore.

01:24:10.109 --> 01:24:10.730
I apologize.

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.130
There's only like five minutes left.

01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:15.712
We'll take a short music break and I'll see you in a minute.

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:20.594
Ooh, that was the wrong one.

01:24:20.614 --> 01:24:21.335
I want this one.

01:24:21.355 --> 01:24:21.555
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.575 --> 01:24:23.636
I'm going to click this out and here.

01:24:24.585 --> 01:24:25.186
This one's for you.

01:24:53.314 --> 01:25:18.887
amazing tornado with human eyes poison birdbaths and torrents of chemical rain like the heads of state hyperventilating in clouds of methane sundown on the human heart and this is what the apocalypse will sound like

01:25:24.991 --> 01:25:32.256
It'll sound like Final Jeopardy but somehow be ghostly like a glockenspiel, like the testing of bombs or the tapping of stiletto heels.

01:25:33.416 --> 01:25:34.237
It'll sound like...

01:25:54.246 --> 01:25:57.447
tried to make a distinction between death and extinction.

01:25:58.907 --> 01:26:03.849
They stopped off at a place called Hamburger Heaven to grab a bite to eat, but Helen had no appetite.

01:26:03.869 --> 01:26:11.331
She just drank a 7-Up while the sheriff tapped his coffee cup to a distant beat, kind of like, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:26:13.952 --> 01:26:15.452
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:26:15.733 --> 01:26:19.274
It won't look like those old frescoes, man, I don't think so.

01:26:19.794 --> 01:26:22.955
There'll be no angels with swords, man, I don't think so.

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.242
And it won't look like those old movies, neither.

01:26:30.262 --> 01:26:36.567
There'll be no drag racing over the bombed-out streets, neither.

01:26:36.627 --> 01:26:40.830
No shareholders will be orbiting the Earth's man, neither.

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:44.413
It'll be hard to recognize each other through our oxygen masks.

01:26:44.453 --> 01:26:52.179
The successful sons of businessmen will set their desks on fire like the five-star generals of the free world weeping the oil choke tide.

01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:53.821
It won't sound good.

01:27:10.481 --> 01:27:12.202
They agreed to disagree.

01:27:14.724 --> 01:27:17.265
They zoomed off in a doomed Corvette.

01:27:18.946 --> 01:27:29.233
The sheriff couldn't recall feeling this way his entire life as he drove through the principalities of unreality on the run with somebody else's wife, the heiress of Texas oil.

01:27:40.552 --> 01:27:46.703
Is it to find everything I've lost or I've been in search of?

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:50.269
Or is it to return to the things to which there is no more return?

01:28:52.724 --> 01:28:56.087
Ah that was a bad... I made my sound too late there.

01:28:56.567 --> 01:29:16.061
I'm gonna go right away to replay the interview with the interview clip of Suzanne Humphreys with the Rogan Show and show you another video from at least eight years ago that will contrast again very starkly to what this shithead and liar said on Joe Rogan.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:16.522
Remember

01:29:17.222 --> 01:29:23.227
As long as Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were alive, some of these people were able to say that I don't think there are any good vaccines.

01:29:23.708 --> 01:29:28.072
They were able to say that I think all vaccines are bad, that they have done no good.

01:29:28.132 --> 01:29:35.038
But as soon as Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were dead, now suddenly they didn't have a very succinct message anymore.

01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:36.499
Now it was more about choice.

01:29:36.519 --> 01:29:44.546
It was about health freedom and building a big top tent of health freedom where they're not challenging anything like baseball bats to the head.

01:29:45.006 --> 01:29:51.409
They want parents to be able to choose how many baseball bats they give to their kid's head and when they do it.

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:55.290
And they don't want a lot of argument about that because mandates are bad.

01:29:55.751 --> 01:29:57.171
This person is a traitor.

01:29:57.651 --> 01:29:58.772
This person is dead.

01:29:58.912 --> 01:30:00.032
Listen to this video.

01:30:03.334 --> 01:30:06.855
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

01:30:08.776 --> 01:30:10.537
The question of the century, isn't it?

01:30:10.837 --> 01:30:11.177
Okay.

01:30:11.257 --> 01:30:13.358
Now we have to back up a minute because

01:30:14.082 --> 01:30:17.045
I had that same question, and I had to go dig deep.

01:30:17.105 --> 01:30:20.088
All the questions you have in your head right now, I had them too at one point.

01:30:20.668 --> 01:30:33.220
So here I am, a medical doctor, working in the field, believing in pretty much everything I was told, giving hundreds if not thousands of vaccines out to my patients, hepatitis B vaccines in particular, flu shots for sure.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.704
I was a nephrologist, kidney specialist, and dialysis, et cetera.

01:30:39.574 --> 01:30:43.877
And initially, you know, we all kind of have an aversion to needles.

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:45.358
I think it's a natural human aversion.

01:30:45.378 --> 01:30:47.919
Some of our kids, no one's going, oh, I want to go get my vaccines.

01:30:47.939 --> 01:30:50.741
We're like, you know, OK, fine, sore arm, you get over it.

01:30:50.861 --> 01:30:52.582
Most of us were lucky enough to get over it.

01:30:54.504 --> 01:30:57.866
So by the time the first instance of

01:30:58.649 --> 01:31:00.811
Problem occurred in front of my eyes.

01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:19.204
I was already a fully seasoned professor of medicine, you know working in a in a tertiary care medical center Okay, and so it it's been a bit of a and so one of the reasons why she was chosen by this group of people these actors is because of that that she had the credentials that could replace Tony bark and

01:31:20.024 --> 01:31:28.587
a former attending physician of pediatrics in the ER of Rush Presbyterian Hospital and Rush Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois.

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:35.589
She doesn't even bother to mention where she used to work because probably where she used to work isn't significant.

01:31:36.551 --> 01:31:41.735
Um, whereas where Tony Bark worked was one of the busiest ERs in America.

01:31:41.755 --> 01:31:55.507
And across the fricking alley from Cook County hospital, the busiest ER in America at some point, like, come on, this is, this is so malevolent and this is such a shitty American.

01:31:55.587 --> 01:31:57.468
It's hard for me to express it in words.

01:31:58.009 --> 01:32:01.852
Process, because for me, it was the influenza vaccines in 2008, 2009 that

01:32:03.849 --> 01:32:09.874
showed me without a doubt that vaccines can and do cause kidney failure and put people on dialysis, that that does happen.

01:32:10.174 --> 01:32:11.515
It can cause hypertension.

01:32:11.535 --> 01:32:15.399
So kidney failure and hypertension are not autism.

01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:15.999
Okay.

01:32:16.219 --> 01:32:31.672
So when these people for the last five years have been saying that vaccines cause autism, not only is that a shitty limited statement, but it's also a shitty limited statement because autism itself is so ridiculous as a concept.

01:32:35.475 --> 01:32:39.298
And so we're not told to take a vaccine history in medical school.

01:32:39.458 --> 01:32:40.699
We're not told to even look there.

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:43.041
It's not even part of, especially in adults.

01:32:43.362 --> 01:32:47.185
But when I did start looking there, I started to see more and more associations.

01:32:47.225 --> 01:32:48.186
Let's just put it that way.

01:32:48.586 --> 01:32:51.869
And so first I had to go down the flu vaccine bunny trail.

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:55.572
And every time I went down that flu vaccine bunny trail, guess what I was asked?

01:32:56.473 --> 01:32:57.413
What about polio?

01:32:58.434 --> 01:32:59.115
So I thought, all right.

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:09.139
even though this has absolutely zero to do with polio, because I'm watching people crap out in front of me after influenza vaccines, let's see about polio, because I knew very little about polio.

01:33:09.179 --> 01:33:17.781
See, so she's been at it for so fricking long that she can't see that, yeah, but they're asking me about polio, so I'll look at polio.

01:33:17.821 --> 01:33:21.442
So what would be the continuum between those two?

01:33:21.502 --> 01:33:23.062
What do they share in common?

01:33:26.107 --> 01:33:27.608
Polio is completely different.

01:33:27.628 --> 01:33:30.730
It's a completely different virus, completely different formulation.

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:32.031
What do they share in common?

01:33:32.491 --> 01:33:44.639
And we're supposed to believe that this shithead, after more than two decades of trying to figure this out, still hasn't come to the conclusion that maybe it's not the specific shit that we inject, it's just injecting shit.

01:33:44.839 --> 01:33:46.340
Oh wait, she did.

01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:50.162
She was saying that when Brandy Vaughn was still alive.

01:33:50.222 --> 01:33:52.324
She was saying that when Tony Bark was still alive.

01:33:52.384 --> 01:33:54.205
She was saying that at events.

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:56.744
where those people were.

01:33:58.545 --> 01:34:01.047
At those events, Brian Hooker didn't say it.

01:34:02.628 --> 01:34:04.710
At those events, Mary Holland didn't say it.

01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:10.715
Only Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark and Suzanne Humphrey said it.

01:34:11.575 --> 01:34:17.580
Everybody else was about mandates and religious exemptions and freedom of speech.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.963
And we just want safe vaccines, but

01:34:23.194 --> 01:34:27.297
Suzanne Humphries, Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn.

01:34:28.357 --> 01:34:29.738
And so now here she is again.

01:34:29.778 --> 01:34:31.199
Remember, she's on Joe Rogan.

01:34:31.239 --> 01:34:34.361
She's got her whole she can say whatever she wants.

01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:35.502
This is what she's saying.

01:34:37.203 --> 01:34:38.684
I'm going to escape and start it again.

01:34:39.464 --> 01:34:43.687
And then I'll move forward in the have there been any instance, right?

01:34:43.707 --> 01:34:45.988
This is the one that everybody points to we don't have crippled kids.

01:34:46.188 --> 01:34:46.408
Yeah.

01:34:46.969 --> 01:34:47.149
What

01:34:48.393 --> 01:34:58.061
When you look at the historical timeline of polio, what do you think caused it to go, to essentially not be a problem anymore?

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:01.925
You don't think vaccinations had anything to do with that?

01:35:02.526 --> 01:35:05.709
Well, I also, it's not what I think, because that's the thing.

01:35:05.769 --> 01:35:10.893
Like, look, when I got into this, I didn't say, oh, you know, I want to argue that vaccines are great.

01:35:10.953 --> 01:35:11.814
I said, look, I don't care.

01:35:11.854 --> 01:35:13.235
I didn't have skin in the game.

01:35:13.315 --> 01:35:14.776
I didn't have vaccine injured kids.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:15.577
I couldn't have cared.

01:35:15.637 --> 01:35:20.921
You saw a video yesterday that I showed you where she said that she doesn't believe any vaccines are safe.

01:35:21.001 --> 01:35:22.362
It's not a possible thing.

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:23.964
There is no such thing.

01:35:24.504 --> 01:35:25.425
Vaccines are dumb.

01:35:27.202 --> 01:35:29.223
She didn't say that, but she said everything else.

01:35:29.903 --> 01:35:32.184
They're antithetical to our basic biology.

01:35:33.104 --> 01:35:36.205
Everything that Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker were saying, she said.

01:35:37.866 --> 01:35:39.807
And now she's not saying it.

01:35:39.887 --> 01:35:45.489
She's very specifically denying having ever said it, that she made any progress at all.

01:35:46.009 --> 01:35:47.989
She just basically has been questioning it.

01:35:48.049 --> 01:35:49.390
And ever since it's been tough.

01:35:50.822 --> 01:36:00.928
She's actually lying about the fact that at one point in time, there are videos of her much younger face saying that all vaccines are bad.

01:36:00.968 --> 01:36:02.969
I don't believe there's any good vaccine.

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:08.332
I don't think you can make a good vaccine because they are antithetical to our biology.

01:36:12.835 --> 01:36:16.417
Less about it, essentially, except that it was something in front of me and it didn't make sense.

01:36:17.247 --> 01:36:19.770
Wherever the truth falls, that's what I'm going to talk about.

01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:25.717
So what I say is that what the facts line up to show you is that polio is still here.

01:36:25.777 --> 01:36:27.239
Polio is still alive and well.

01:36:27.559 --> 01:36:30.082
Polio is called different things today.

01:36:30.694 --> 01:36:39.137
Whereas back in the 1940s, 1950s, the criteria for diagnosing polio were completely different to the year that the vaccine was introduced.

01:36:39.217 --> 01:36:39.658
Wow.

01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:42.039
So they diagnosed polio different.

01:36:42.079 --> 01:36:44.199
They diagnosed autism different.

01:36:44.219 --> 01:36:46.120
They're diagnosing rubella different.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.461
What an convenient fricking story.

01:36:48.881 --> 01:36:52.763
It's almost like, you know, Oh my gosh, it's all gross.

01:36:54.270 --> 01:37:03.953
the playing field, the goalposts, everything was changed so that despite the fact that there was more paralytic polio in the years after that vaccine was introduced, they were able to show a

01:37:04.292 --> 01:37:11.998
a complete cascading drop of paralytic polio simply because of the way they changed the definitions of what polio is and what could cause it.

01:37:12.018 --> 01:37:15.661
And they started testing for the virus, where before they would never test for the virus.

01:37:16.261 --> 01:37:32.594
And when they started testing for the virus later, what they would find that people had Guillain-Barre syndrome, they didn't have virus, or they had Coxsackie virus or Echovirus, or they were lead poisoned or mercury poisoned, which was the mercury and lead were the leading treatments of the day, including blood letting.

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:36.697
They were telling people to take your cigarette and put a little bit of arsenic in there.

01:37:36.737 --> 01:37:37.578
It's good for your lungs.

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.542
They were literally blowing smoke up people's butts.

01:37:41.602 --> 01:37:43.344
That's where the term comes from.

01:37:43.684 --> 01:37:46.507
If you want to Google that now, you'll see that there's an instrument that does it.

01:37:49.409 --> 01:37:52.571
Leah, the polio story, where to even begin?

01:37:52.591 --> 01:37:54.853
And so there's about 70 pages.

01:37:54.913 --> 01:37:56.814
And so that became my obsession.

01:37:56.934 --> 01:38:01.076
So when people said, what about polio, and I started digging this up, I went deep into it.

01:38:01.137 --> 01:38:03.318
Did you dive into pesticides?

01:38:03.703 --> 01:38:12.450
Yes, yes, you have to dive into pesticides because the tonnage of production of DDT absolutely mirrored the diagnosis for polio.

01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:15.893
Which is the story of the moth in the iron lung, as far as I believe.

01:38:16.433 --> 01:38:22.158
In the days and the countries that still make DDT today is where we're still seeing this paralytic polio situation happen.

01:38:22.705 --> 01:38:26.089
And also, weren't the first cases, did they break out in a rural community?

01:38:26.129 --> 01:38:27.731
That could easily be true, right?

01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:36.841
DDT could be causing paralysis very separate from a biological signal that could be characterized as a gastrointentional, you know, phage.

01:38:37.927 --> 01:38:40.589
And they're misconstruing all these things together as one thing.

01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:43.010
And she's, she's promoting the book story of it.

01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.471
That's all.

01:38:43.571 --> 01:38:45.492
It's just, it's just a script.

01:38:45.652 --> 01:38:53.937
Otherwise, if she was really trying to score a touchdown by now in this video, she would have already said that there are no good vaccines.

01:38:53.977 --> 01:38:55.338
I knew that before the pandemic.

01:38:56.519 --> 01:38:56.899
Immunity.

01:38:58.018 --> 01:38:59.299
The first cases of polio, yes.

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.781
In the United States, paralytic polio.

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.063
Yes, it was out in the countryside.

01:39:02.083 --> 01:39:04.866
Well, that was probably more because of the sheep and cow dipping.

01:39:05.246 --> 01:39:12.214
So arsenic, you'd have to look at arsenic, you have to look at the mercurials, you have to look at the calcium arsenate, lead arsenate sprays that were put on trees.

01:39:12.254 --> 01:39:14.977
But what you're talking about in particular, they would call the cow disease.

01:39:15.298 --> 01:39:17.300
They'd go out in the family when you would

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:21.122
go to the house, they'd say, all the kids have the cow disease, what the cows had before.

01:39:21.142 --> 01:39:21.903
Well, what were they doing?

01:39:21.943 --> 01:39:23.024
They would have this trenches.

01:39:23.044 --> 01:39:24.945
You talk to farmers even today.

01:39:25.345 --> 01:39:26.306
Oh yeah, we had trenches.

01:39:26.346 --> 01:39:29.488
We would just walk them straight through and I'd be soaked with the stuff by the end of the day.

01:39:29.508 --> 01:39:30.389
Oh my God.

01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.949
Yeah.

01:39:31.269 --> 01:39:42.357
So they're basically soaking and bathing in arsenic, which is great for killing fleas and ticks, but it's not really great for keeping your nervous system happy because the fact of the matter is, and this again, I've got medical reference.

01:39:42.457 --> 01:39:44.778
Rogan's inhaling in the back.

01:39:45.018 --> 01:39:46.900
Oh, he's such a monkey.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.321
This is everything I can't get away with making stuff up.

01:39:50.401 --> 01:40:02.586
Okay, I have to put a reference for everything But arsenic causes the exact same spinal pathology that and fevers and everything It literally mimics what they were calling polio and a polio virus back in the day.

01:40:04.247 --> 01:40:13.071
I Read this crazy statistic and I still can't believe it's real that 95 to 99 percent of all polio is asymptomatic

01:40:13.763 --> 01:40:14.543
That's exactly right.

01:40:14.603 --> 01:40:17.985
So polio virus is what we call a commensal.

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:22.087
Just like you have staph on your skin and strep on your skin and it actually serves a purpose.

01:40:22.167 --> 01:40:23.808
It keeps other microbes in check.

01:40:24.008 --> 01:40:26.109
A commensal, which means what?

01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:27.750
It means a background signal.

01:40:30.551 --> 01:40:31.131
It's there.

01:40:32.392 --> 01:40:33.012
Commensal.

01:40:33.412 --> 01:40:34.593
It's a background signal.

01:40:35.942 --> 01:40:39.424
Now do you see why they have to have these trained liars in place?

01:40:39.484 --> 01:40:49.148
Because the COVID vaccine and the COVID narrative and the COVID bullshit and the COVID spike are all based on background signals.

01:40:49.268 --> 01:40:54.590
I don't know how they've used them, which ones are real and which ones aren't, and how they really work.

01:40:55.424 --> 01:41:11.911
But I know that it's a background signal, and that's why they will never allow the FDA to retroactively investigate the 220 EUA-granted PCR diagnostics that were used in the United States to define the pandemic for three years.

01:41:11.971 --> 01:41:12.931
They will never do it.

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:19.646
You don't get a cut and have not a good immune system to deal from the inside out.

01:41:19.686 --> 01:41:35.518
So polio, the reason I can say that polio is a commensal is because again, there are medical studies that showed that people who dared to get on the edge of some of these wild... So being a commensal is very difficult to prove whether it's a phage or whether it's infecting you.

01:41:36.479 --> 01:41:40.923
If it's a commensal in your gut, it's most likely replicating in the bacteria.

01:41:42.504 --> 01:41:43.605
So it makes it a phage.

01:41:45.128 --> 01:41:47.309
Do you see, do you see the problem here?

01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:50.652
Because phages can move freely through the gut-blood-brain barrier.

01:41:51.332 --> 01:41:54.014
Lots of them can, maybe polio can, I don't know.

01:41:55.155 --> 01:41:59.038
But it's not a virus that's replicating in us.

01:41:59.618 --> 01:42:03.120
Not by, not because there's definitive proof of it, that's for sure.

01:42:03.501 --> 01:42:05.102
And she certainly doesn't have it.

01:42:05.542 --> 01:42:12.667
Tribes down in South America or elsewhere, but in particular, I'm talking about a South American tribe called the Javante Indians.

01:42:13.154 --> 01:42:20.746
So the Indian Health Service got to the edge of it and bargained that they would get some stool and some blood from the tribes so that they could test it for polio.

01:42:21.648 --> 01:42:27.457
And what they found was 98 to 99 percent of every person they tested, and it was hundreds of people.

01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:31.232
had evidence of immunity to all three strains of polio.

01:42:32.013 --> 01:42:34.335
And they said to them, well, where are your crippled children?

01:42:34.375 --> 01:42:35.335
Where's your short legs?

01:42:35.395 --> 01:42:37.157
Where are the people that died of respiratory failure?

01:42:37.177 --> 01:42:39.278
And they were like, we don't have any of that problem.

01:42:39.298 --> 01:42:54.850
Okay, so the point is, again, by relying on their diagnostics and their immunomarkers and telling a story about their data, we're supposed to believe that their diagnostics work.

01:42:55.691 --> 01:42:59.673
and that there is polio, but these people had it and didn't get paralyzed.

01:42:59.833 --> 01:43:05.716
And so there's a whole bunch of assumptions that are working here and she is not questioning any of them.

01:43:05.916 --> 01:43:14.860
She's just regurgitating them because it's a fricking script.

01:43:16.181 --> 01:43:20.003
I thought she talked about smallpox vaccine in that video.

01:43:20.523 --> 01:43:23.485
I must have to open up a new, I'm gonna have to get that up, sorry.

01:43:24.957 --> 01:43:28.563
because there was a smallpox part of that interview and I thought I had the right clip there.

01:43:28.623 --> 01:43:29.865
I apologize, that screwed up.

01:43:31.248 --> 01:43:38.059
We need Humphreys, Rogan, smallpox.

01:43:38.259 --> 01:43:39.001
Maybe there's a clip.

01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.722
what actually happened in polio.

01:43:43.862 --> 01:43:46.184
I think this is where she says it.

01:43:46.944 --> 01:43:59.315
So they're basically soaking us after a while, the only cases of polio, and it became so often immunity that occurred in the throat, and it changed it for the worse, not made its way into your body, because onselectomies were huge.

01:43:59.575 --> 01:44:04.760
What causes it then actual pathology, you know, so they call it again.

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:05.621
Can you say that word again?

01:44:06.261 --> 01:44:06.841
Myelitis.

01:44:06.861 --> 01:44:08.582
Poliomyelitis.

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:12.424
What caught in tonsillitis they're afraid of for the strain escaped.

01:44:12.624 --> 01:44:14.124
People were throwing their cats out the window.

01:44:14.144 --> 01:44:14.284
Some 20,000.

01:44:14.584 --> 01:44:16.525
Thing that was very confusing.

01:44:16.805 --> 01:44:18.046
Well, they started killing dogs.

01:44:18.326 --> 01:44:20.887
You know, in New York, in that incidence, I told.

01:44:21.147 --> 01:44:23.248
Oh, they don't get human derived polio.

01:44:23.328 --> 01:44:23.928
It doesn't cross.

01:44:24.548 --> 01:44:25.369
I got to find it.

01:44:25.449 --> 01:44:25.729
Sorry.

01:44:25.749 --> 01:44:26.389
I got to find it.

01:44:27.049 --> 01:44:30.091
So the polio story.

01:44:31.044 --> 01:44:45.311
I'm not making this up either, 1916, Upper East Side, Manhattan, there was a Rockefeller lab that their specific stated goal was to try to create the most pathological, neuropathological strain of polio possible.

01:44:45.711 --> 01:44:54.175
And they did that by taking monkey brains and human spinal serum and injecting it into monkeys, polio in Greek, poliomyelitis, dealing with a solution of

01:44:55.856 --> 01:45:01.702
mother is able to introduce antigens in the world to her baby through her own immune response to that vaccine.

01:45:02.283 --> 01:45:07.969
So, like, I think if most women understood the power and said, no, no, no, we can't do this.

01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:09.130
Meanwhile, guess what?

01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:12.173
They were using the same vaccine in the 1700s and 1800s

01:45:15.836 --> 01:45:23.938
late 1700s all through the 1800s into the 1900s, they would sometimes, you probably saw the picture, the child's arm considered a good take.

01:45:24.059 --> 01:45:30.760
Five huge ulcers on the arm, with sanitation being what it was, no antibiotics.

01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:36.842
Can you imagine having your baby have five scars on its arm, ulcerating from these things, having fevers?

01:45:37.182 --> 01:45:38.943
Sometimes the arms became necrotic.

01:45:39.244 --> 01:45:41.265
Sometimes the disease spread all over the place.

01:45:41.405 --> 01:45:49.411
And there was nothing to give them except bloodletting, mercurials, and arsenicals, and heating them up in a dark room with no sunlight.

01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:50.531
That was the treatment.

01:45:50.591 --> 01:45:52.513
Mercurials and arsenicals.

01:45:52.573 --> 01:45:55.835
These words are being used to bamboozle you.

01:45:55.935 --> 01:45:58.237
I'm listening for this smallpox thing.

01:45:58.577 --> 01:45:59.037
Smallpox.

01:45:59.057 --> 01:46:01.139
So you tell me why smallpox was so lethal.

01:46:03.203 --> 01:46:05.305
This episode is brought to you by farmer's dog.

01:46:05.465 --> 01:46:06.005
It doesn't matter.

01:46:06.025 --> 01:46:07.647
Lethal with no sunlight.

01:46:07.947 --> 01:46:12.751
That was the reels and arsenicals and heating them up in a dark room with no sunlight.

01:46:13.051 --> 01:46:14.472
That was the treatment for smallpox.

01:46:14.492 --> 01:46:16.614
So you tell me why smallpox was so lethal.

01:46:16.734 --> 01:46:17.074
Okay.

01:46:17.114 --> 01:46:18.135
So that's possible.

01:46:18.155 --> 01:46:19.576
They poisoned him I guess.

01:46:22.058 --> 01:46:31.888
Unheard of you you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to imagine just the smell of human feces everywhere Like streets were filled without houses.

01:46:32.068 --> 01:46:34.170
There was animal shit in the streets.

01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:37.493
It was no sanitation There's no running water.

01:46:37.733 --> 01:46:38.614
It's a disaster.

01:46:38.974 --> 01:46:40.896
It's a disaster and there's no good food.

01:46:41.236 --> 01:46:46.882
So you got malnutrition you you're exposed to numerous pathogens and just

01:46:47.442 --> 01:46:47.583
if if

01:47:02.381 --> 01:47:03.641
puss pockets in your lungs.

01:47:03.701 --> 01:47:05.222
So yeah, thank you for that description.

01:47:05.262 --> 01:47:14.365
I don't think I could hear historical quotes from, you know, anthropologists that would go through the slums in New York, you know, the Ellis Island was just bringing people in.

01:47:14.385 --> 01:47:23.668
Okay, so anyway, let's watch the clip that I wanted you to see because she doesn't say this on Joe Rogan, what she says in this clip, and I think it's very striking.

01:47:26.308 --> 01:47:26.989
It's baffling.

01:47:28.329 --> 01:47:33.293
It's like the minds have been sucked into this paradigm so deeply.

01:47:33.793 --> 01:47:38.457
If indeed it is such a miraculous product, wouldn't we be noticing how miraculous it is?

01:47:38.817 --> 01:47:43.421
Are they saying that we are just too stupid to notice that this is killing people and maiming people?

01:47:43.701 --> 01:47:46.243
That we're too stupid to notice that it's miraculous?

01:47:46.863 --> 01:47:48.364
You know, I think that is a lot of the argument.

01:47:48.404 --> 01:47:50.765
We're just too stupid to notice how miraculous this is.

01:47:50.825 --> 01:47:54.467
So to protect everybody, they're going to give it to us anyway.

01:47:54.987 --> 01:48:00.030
Why must such a wonderful product be forced upon people since the beginning of vaccination?

01:48:02.591 --> 01:48:12.957
If people were really seeing each other dropping dead of smallpox and they were really seeing each other being saved by a smallpox vaccine, the line would be out of town, you know, to get it.

01:48:13.277 --> 01:48:14.358
That's never been the case.

01:48:15.418 --> 01:48:34.596
And that's a very important point to make that I've made with historical textbooks and historical medical encyclopedias and domestic medical practice books from the early 1900s, where in none of the descriptions of smallpox, do you hear them talking about death and the likelihood of it and how to avoid it?

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.262
Why didn't she say that on Joe Rogan?

01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:45.771
That's a pretty good sales pitch for Joe Rogan.

01:48:45.832 --> 01:48:47.953
Just like, I don't think there are any good vaccines.

01:48:47.973 --> 01:48:49.213
I don't think they make sense.

01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:51.574
They're not, they don't make biological sense.

01:48:51.634 --> 01:48:52.755
Why wouldn't she say that?

01:48:52.895 --> 01:48:56.657
Because she could say it when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were alive.

01:49:00.412 --> 01:49:15.962
The history books really show that the people that were vaccinated were among the sickest, that many children were dying after smallpox vaccinations, that they were developing terrible ulcerations, beautiful, perfect babies, you know, forced into smallpox vaccines.

01:49:15.982 --> 01:49:25.588
And so the idea, again, is that the Paul Offits and the Vincent Rackin-Yellows, they use smallpox and the existence of anti-vaccine

01:49:26.428 --> 01:49:31.771
literature at that time has evidence that the anti-vax movement has always existed.

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:34.713
It always questioned vaccination.

01:49:36.594 --> 01:49:51.503
And what's really remarkable about that, that these people don't seem to be able to dunk with, is that that means that the idea of vaccination has never been wrong, has never needed updating.

01:49:51.843 --> 01:49:55.926
The methodology was never less than perfect.

01:49:57.318 --> 01:50:04.241
Vaccination has always been good, is the stance, all the way back to the smallpox vaccine.

01:50:04.281 --> 01:50:13.324
So again, a couple decades of work, and this shithead progressed to understanding it, and then not saying it anymore.

01:50:13.424 --> 01:50:21.187
Just like Brian Hooker progressed to saying it, that autism is a bullshit word that he doesn't use, to not saying it anymore.

01:50:21.267 --> 01:50:24.969
Because they're all on the same malevolent national security script.

01:50:25.749 --> 01:50:30.142
Otherwise they'd be dead, or they'd be using social media to completely ignore them.

01:50:31.757 --> 01:50:35.178
either dying or developing terrible, terrible diseases.

01:50:35.878 --> 01:50:39.500
And the diseases are often said, oh, that would have happened anyway.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.561
But parents who watch this happen time and again know otherwise.

01:50:43.921 --> 01:50:58.146
So those of us who actually notice the science is not backing up vaccination, those of us who notice that people are being maimed and killed by vaccinations, those of us who have experienced our own vaccine reactions are categorically thought to be mad

01:51:00.697 --> 01:51:02.418
despite the fact that we've actually studied it.

01:51:07.383 --> 01:51:21.975
They used to say it, but they don't say it anymore, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a national security operation where an expected rise in all-cause mortality, clearly visible in the population pyramid for more than three decades, was used, misconstrued as a spread.

01:51:21.995 --> 01:51:28.681
And the way that they did it was they took an existing background and they used nonspecific PCR tests and molded it

01:51:29.485 --> 01:51:41.448
They molded it into a graph that they could point to on the PBS NewsHour and say that something really shitty was happening in America, but not in Australia and Japan and New Zealand where they locked down and wore masks.

01:51:41.968 --> 01:51:43.488
They were fine in 2020 and 2021.

01:51:43.628 --> 01:51:50.050
And in America, there is a very succinct list of ways that people were killed.

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:56.011
And there seems to be an incredibly low number of people that are willing to assemble and curate such a list.

01:51:56.791 --> 01:51:58.412
Like me and Mark and Joe, that's it.

01:51:59.417 --> 01:52:13.810
And the reason why is because endemicity is a myth that these people are all protecting with the same script that protects PCR as a diagnostic, and sequencing as a high-fidelity measurement, and transfection as a vaccine.

01:52:15.532 --> 01:52:22.738
Ladies and gentlemen, they did it with placebo, they did it with non-specific tests, and people are still using those tests to find those ghosts.

01:52:23.635 --> 01:52:28.061
and still playing the role of Ghostbuster, and they're all in front of us on social media.

01:52:28.102 --> 01:52:31.346
So until you get off of social media, we're going to lose.

01:52:32.328 --> 01:52:35.312
And this is for all the marbles, so we don't want to lose, ladies and gentlemen.

01:52:35.372 --> 01:52:37.115
Social media has people like this.

01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:54.926
people like this that will tell you that... In the past months, I've had a lot of discussions about AI with people who know that computers can't ever be conscious or have free will or be truly intelligent because they're just machines.

01:52:55.686 --> 01:53:07.615
But look, the human brain is just a machine too, in the sense that we get input and we work on that input and we create memories and or act in response to that input.

01:53:07.995 --> 01:53:12.599
There's nothing going on in the human brain that a computer can't also do.

01:53:13.279 --> 01:53:17.042
Sure, we don't fully understand just how the human brain works,

01:53:17.242 --> 01:53:20.345
Sure, we don't fully understand how the human brain works.

01:53:20.865 --> 01:53:26.551
Sure, we don't fully understand how the pattern integrity is encoded in genes, but who gives a shit?

01:53:26.971 --> 01:53:28.332
We assume that it is.

01:53:28.993 --> 01:53:29.814
Who gives a shit?

01:53:29.854 --> 01:53:32.917
We assume that the brain is doing nothing special.

01:53:34.144 --> 01:53:35.526
Because we're nothing special.

01:53:35.566 --> 01:53:37.608
Because the message is we're nothing special.

01:53:37.668 --> 01:53:39.029
Our kids are nothing special.

01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:41.051
We're just a blip in time.

01:53:41.772 --> 01:53:43.974
Just one member of a giant species.

01:53:44.755 --> 01:53:47.298
You might as well consider yourself an experimental animal.

01:53:47.358 --> 01:53:50.321
This is one of the worst humans on earth.

01:53:50.922 --> 01:53:52.864
And an incredible fraud.

01:53:53.324 --> 01:53:54.646
An incredible fraud.

01:53:56.309 --> 01:54:01.673
but we're getting better at it, and computers are getting more similar to it.

01:54:02.534 --> 01:54:20.468
I'm afraid that this belief that there is something special, basically magical, going on in human brains that an algorithm can't also do, leads people to underestimate just how dramatic

01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:40.018
Now remember it's very different for me to say that language is a trick and language can be gamed and they've been gaming language for as long as language existed to control people is very different than saying that what goes on in our brain is just language and so we're all dumb and we don't have we don't have our free will.

01:54:41.559 --> 01:54:44.940
We are sovereign beings made in the image of God.

01:54:46.921 --> 01:54:47.921
Come to terms with it.

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:49.082
These people are lying.

01:54:49.994 --> 01:54:51.495
and they are being paid to lie.

01:54:51.975 --> 01:54:53.936
They are being facilitated to lie.

01:54:55.656 --> 01:55:04.800
And until you realize it and purposely remove them from your life, they will be allowed to continue to mislead you and your family and friends.

01:55:05.342 --> 01:55:16.811
Artificial intelligence will change the world once it reaches human level, which is probably... It's never going to reach human level because they don't have anything like that.

01:55:16.951 --> 01:55:19.613
They have to build the storage.

01:55:19.653 --> 01:55:21.174
They have to build the computers.

01:55:21.234 --> 01:55:24.757
They need to build the small reactors that will power them.

01:55:25.177 --> 01:55:27.579
They need to do all kinds of shit yet.

01:55:27.699 --> 01:55:30.842
Their plans are so far from happening.

01:55:31.242 --> 01:55:32.143
It's just a joke.

01:55:33.154 --> 01:55:52.231
And in the meantime, they're setting up a smaller iteration of it in these different systems, in these different places, where they'll start to collect the data with mobile devices and from doctor's visits, just to see if they can store it all and whether they can feed it all in a useful way into a machine learning algorithm and get a couple low-hanging fruits.

01:55:52.771 --> 01:55:55.213
And in the meantime, they're going to keep all these shitheads

01:55:56.167 --> 01:56:03.237
Steven Hatfield, Tess Laurie, Robert Malone, Harvey Reich, Tess Laurie, Jessica Rose.

01:56:03.257 --> 01:56:11.589
They're gonna keep all these shitheads in front of us, talking about the lab leak, making everything that matters invisible.

01:56:12.739 --> 01:56:21.884
If you want to really see who's at the heart of this, you need to go to the November 23, you know, 18th and 19th of November in Bucharest, Romania.

01:56:21.944 --> 01:56:26.847
This stage photograph incriminates all of the people in the red circles.

01:56:27.768 --> 01:56:28.808
They're all liars.

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:29.869
They're all being paid.

01:56:30.309 --> 01:56:35.352
They're all basically on this man's script or Kevin McKernan's script or whoever's running them.

01:56:37.352 --> 01:56:48.781
And it's an international group of performers that includes Steve Hatfill, and Brett Weinstein, and Nick Hudson, and Jason Kristoff, and Jessica Rose, and Harvey Reich.

01:56:50.162 --> 01:56:52.624
And they're probably all standing in front of Byron Bridle.

01:56:52.664 --> 01:56:56.827
Byron Bridle just hopes that he's doing something okay, but he doesn't get it yet.

01:56:57.328 --> 01:56:58.709
They have to keep him away from me.

01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:02.672
And Denny Rancor is an incredibly bad liar.

01:57:04.625 --> 01:57:10.412
And his interactions with me were only because Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and them told him to do it.

01:57:11.493 --> 01:57:13.055
It's really gross, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:13.596 --> 01:57:16.239
And now there's a plot to get RFK.

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:17.300
And look who's wrote it.

01:57:17.761 --> 01:57:22.486
James Lyons Weiler being promoted on Robert Malone's substack.

01:57:22.566 --> 01:57:23.728
Well, go figure.

01:57:25.165 --> 01:57:26.466
Go figure.

01:57:26.867 --> 01:57:32.412
It's hard to believe, isn't it, that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances is just plain dumb?

01:57:32.972 --> 01:57:37.036
It's hard to believe that transfection in healthy humans was always dangerous and criminal.

01:57:37.437 --> 01:57:45.064
It's hard to believe that we're the only people on earth saying viruses are not pattern integrities, but someday our kids are gonna learn it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:45.104 --> 01:57:47.066
Someday our kids are gonna know it.

01:57:48.712 --> 01:57:51.476
My name is Jonathan Cooley, coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:57:51.496 --> 01:57:53.279
You can find my work on PubMed.

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:57.285
You can also find me on JC on a Bike and JC in the Woods on YouTube.

01:57:58.326 --> 01:58:00.109
I was in that book, so buy that book.

01:58:01.846 --> 01:58:03.107
It's a historical document.

01:58:03.167 --> 01:58:05.489
Buy it, send it to me, and I'll sign it to you.

01:58:05.509 --> 01:58:06.369
You can send it to P.O.

01:58:06.409 --> 01:58:08.671
Box 802 Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

01:58:09.172 --> 01:58:24.063
And we can send you an early COVID sticker, an early COVID survivor sticker, and some gigaohm stickers, and even a gigaohm Velcro-backed patch, you know, so you can put it on your tactical bag or whatever.

01:58:25.586 --> 01:58:29.168
Yeah, I'm kind of one of those guys that has a tactical bag with Velcro on it.

01:58:29.888 --> 01:58:33.630
How this works is that people share the stream and people learn the biology.

01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:37.251
So if you're not doing it regularly and you want to help, please share the stream.

01:58:38.092 --> 01:58:43.414
And if you really want to help, go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support me and my family's work here.

01:58:44.114 --> 01:58:45.495
It would be greatly appreciated.

01:58:45.555 --> 01:58:46.115
Thanks, Simon.

01:58:46.155 --> 01:58:46.695
Thanks, Jeff.

01:58:46.735 --> 01:58:47.316
Thanks, William.

01:58:48.016 --> 01:58:48.696
Thanks, everybody.

01:58:49.737 --> 01:58:50.337
I'll see you tomorrow.
