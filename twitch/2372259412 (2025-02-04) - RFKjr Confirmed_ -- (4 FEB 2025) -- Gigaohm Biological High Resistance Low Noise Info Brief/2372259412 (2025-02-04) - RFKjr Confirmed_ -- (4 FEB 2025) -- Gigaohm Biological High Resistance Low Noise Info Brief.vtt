WEBVTT

00:11.710 --> 00:11.970
th th

00:40.458 --> 00:44.280
We are meeting today to consider the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.661
to be Secretary of the U.S.

00:46.681 --> 00:48.442
Department of Health and Human Services.

00:49.442 --> 00:56.525
We are still waiting to get all of our members here, and while we wait for that to occur, we will proceed with statements.

00:57.766 --> 01:07.850
And I will proceed first, then Senator Wyden, and then we will rotate from one side to the other until we are at a point where we are prepared for the vote.

01:13.133 --> 01:19.236
Mr. Kennedy if confirmed will have the opportunity to deliver much-needed change to our nation's health care system.

01:20.356 --> 01:31.401
He has spent his career fighting to end America's chronic illness epidemic and has been a leading advocate for health care transparency both for patients and for taxpayers.

01:32.625 --> 01:45.910
Mr. Kennedy has also clearly responded to our questions during the rigorous due diligence process in his hearing also and in the course of answering over 900 questions for the record that were asked by members of this committee.

01:47.531 --> 01:55.434
In response to members of the committee, Mr. Kennedy has even amended his ethics agreement going beyond what is required by the Government Office of Ethics.

01:56.772 --> 02:04.858
Mr. Kennedy has proven his commitment to the role of Secretary of the HHS, and I will vote in favor of his nomination.

02:05.738 --> 02:09.581
I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

02:10.021 --> 02:13.864
And with that, I recognize our Ranking Member, Senator Wyden, for his remarks.

02:14.024 --> 02:15.605
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

02:15.625 --> 02:21.890
I'll have a brief statement and then several of my colleagues on our side are also going to

02:22.677 --> 02:23.638
make brief statements.

02:23.698 --> 02:30.603
This morning, we're going to vote on Robert Kennedy's nomination to serve as our nation's chief health care officer.

02:31.324 --> 02:41.932
Before we get to Mr. Kennedy and why I believe he is singularly unfit to serve as HHS secretary, I'd like to say this.

02:42.853 --> 02:51.480
The last several days, we've witnessed an authoritarian takeover of our federal government by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

02:52.230 --> 03:00.580
They have set their sights on a full purge of anyone in government that doesn't bend the knee and follow their orders.

03:01.321 --> 03:04.925
They've taken over the Treasury Department's payment system.

03:05.802 --> 03:19.329
And colleagues, that has a direct effect on major programs within our committee's jurisdiction that includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

03:19.829 --> 03:27.773
For example, this committee voted for a major reform of pharmacy benefit manager legislation.

03:28.533 --> 03:33.716
We passed it 26 to nothing, but Trump and Musk killed it.

03:34.670 --> 03:39.614
think what they could do with abuse of the payment system.

03:40.735 --> 03:50.283
Now, in my view, much of this is of dubious legality and constitutional authority and certainly flies in face of congressional responsibilities.

03:51.400 --> 04:05.825
I'll wrap up on this point by saying I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not sit by while Musk and Trump make a mockery of the power Republicans hold in their congressional majority.

04:06.665 --> 04:13.168
Now more than ever, the American people need leaders that will stand up to these abuses.

04:14.448 --> 04:16.669
That brings me to Mr. Kennedy.

04:17.603 --> 04:37.895
A recent analysis showed that Mr. Kennedy has made 114 separate appearances in just the last four years where he has espoused anti-vaccine views or spread information about the efficacy of vaccines.

04:38.856 --> 04:40.917
Misinformation, specifically.

04:41.478 --> 04:46.961
In 36 of those instances, Mr. Kennedy directly linked vaccines to autism.

04:48.106 --> 04:58.731
Last week, Mr. Kennedy was given ample authority on a bipartisan basis to recant his decades-long career peddling anti-vaccine conspiracies.

04:59.611 --> 05:13.778
Instead, he spent his time with us dodging and weaving and gave no indication that if confirmed as HHS Secretary, he would stand by the long-settled science surrounding routine vaccinations.

05:14.793 --> 05:18.794
Just take the Samoa measles outbreak as an example.

05:19.315 --> 05:23.676
Mr. Kennedy told me, and I quote, we don't know what was killing them.

05:24.376 --> 05:30.759
Speaking about the 83 measles deaths during an outbreak of the disease in 2019.

05:31.659 --> 05:40.542
Just yesterday, colleagues, the Director General of Health from Samoa called this claim a total fabrication.

05:41.954 --> 05:49.528
peddling these conspiracy theories as the nation's chief health officer is going to be deadly for kids across the country.

05:50.382 --> 05:54.724
On abortion, Mr. Kennedy's answers once again raise still more questions.

05:55.185 --> 06:02.549
He refused to tell us whether he would blindly follow a directive from Donald Trump to break the law and end access to Mifepristone.

06:03.229 --> 06:11.874
And he seemed to have no understanding of his role in enforcing existing federal laws that guarantee women the right to life-saving abortion care.

06:12.731 --> 06:22.493
Mr. Kennedy also failed on several occasions to show a basic understanding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs he would be tasked with overseeing.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.873
Colleagues, that alone should be disqualifying.

06:27.554 --> 06:40.816
Mr. Kennedy has given us no reason to believe he'll be anything other than a rubber stamp for plans to gut Medicaid and rip health care away from the American people and be a yes man if ordered by Musk or Trump to take an illegal action.

06:41.616 --> 06:43.078
I close with this, colleagues.

06:45.540 --> 06:51.507
Today, we're going to make a judgment about the future of science in this country.

06:52.708 --> 06:59.236
We're going to make decisions that are going to impact the health and well-being of Americans for years to come.

07:01.002 --> 07:14.272
I agree, and I say this to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that the healthcare status quo needs substantial changes so we get better, more affordable care to patients.

07:15.774 --> 07:21.878
And that leaves, given my statement, the question in front of us now that's pretty simple.

07:22.915 --> 07:33.177
Do senators want their legacy to include disregarding basic health science and instead elevate conspiracy theorists?

07:34.017 --> 07:42.359
Making Robert Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services, in my view, colleagues, would be a grave threat to the health of the American people.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.220
And I urge my colleagues this morning to vote no.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.570
So Senator Wyden, we have all of our members here.

07:58.451 --> 08:06.352
Senator Wyden and I have agreed that we will have two or three on each side who wanted to make statements, do so before the vote.

08:06.452 --> 08:12.613
So please everyone hold with us while we have those statements made and then we will proceed to the vote.

08:13.213 --> 08:18.654
I know we've got a lot of folks here pushing on some... Do you want to vote now?

08:20.495 --> 08:21.095
Mr. Chairman?

08:21.335 --> 08:21.915
Mr. Chairman?

08:22.930 --> 08:36.766
Mr. Chairman, I've got several colleagues who were under the impression after we talked that we would have two or three and I'm happy for both sides to make brief remarks and I'd still like to stay with that.

08:37.006 --> 08:39.769
I did make that commitment and so

08:41.300 --> 08:46.342
I could say to my colleagues on my side, I would appreciate it if you would hold your remarks until after the vote.

08:47.063 --> 08:51.645
We will let a couple on your side have their remarks, and then we will proceed to the vote.

08:51.745 --> 08:52.546
Great, thank you.

08:52.726 --> 08:53.486
And who would be next?

08:53.506 --> 08:54.126
Senator Cantwell.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.247
Senator Cantwell.

08:55.407 --> 08:56.547
Mr. Chairman, thank you.

08:56.628 --> 09:05.212
I didn't, you know, when you said two or three people, I didn't know who you had in mind, but being next in seniority, I appreciate the opportunity.

09:06.692 --> 09:09.614
Today is very concerning to me.

09:10.785 --> 09:15.547
because of the future of what I think our nation faces.

09:17.028 --> 09:27.654
When I think of this issue, I think of my Pacific Northwest leadership, how Paul Allen, on his own, invested $100 million to fight Ebola.

09:30.771 --> 09:45.683
I think of Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation, not just trying to eradicate polio and work on these issues, but to think of a regime that helps not just our nation's health, but global health.

09:46.483 --> 10:04.223
So with the UW, the University of Washington, the Cancer Research Center, all of these entities are a collaboration of saying we have to go faster in solving these threats to our nation as it relates to health.

10:05.293 --> 10:12.157
Now, we can have a big discussion, which I think you guys all want to have a big discussion about whether and when what happened in the Wuhan province.

10:12.197 --> 10:15.338
But I can tell you, we were the first city.

10:15.719 --> 10:16.999
We had the first patient.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.621
We had the first people who died in nursing homes.

10:19.921 --> 10:26.504
We had an emergency room at a hospital who basically was just begging for any equipment we could get them.

10:27.065 --> 10:34.549
The whole community stood up and moved as fast as we possibly could and broke down barriers to save lives.

10:35.169 --> 10:38.830
And that is what we have to continue to do on innovation.

10:39.150 --> 10:47.891
We cannot let another country get ahead of us on some sort of warfare issue and not have a response when it comes to a vaccine.

10:48.791 --> 10:59.793
So the innovation, innovation is what Mary Holland was arguing for on Steve Bannon the other day after the after the second hearing of Robert F. Kennedy, his father gave a famous speech.

10:59.913 --> 11:04.254
I told him in my office, in my family, the Kennedys stood up.

11:06.104 --> 11:18.111
But when he answered Senator Cassidy's question, and he couldn't even give him the answer that, yes, the data is there to support vaccines today.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.012
I don't need any more data.

11:20.672 --> 11:25.435
All of a sudden, I saw this world that we got affected by in Seattle.

11:26.415 --> 11:28.117
not being stood up for.

11:28.398 --> 11:36.647
I need someone at HHS who is going to say we're going to be a leader in medical, technology, science, vaccines.

11:36.928 --> 11:38.610
We are going to fight foreign powers.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.473
We are going to be there to provide global health.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.716
And I don't want to recalcitrant.

11:44.136 --> 11:44.857
I need a leader.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.079
And that is why I'm voting no.

11:47.449 --> 11:47.869
Thank you.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.491
Senator Wyden and I have agreed that Senator Warnock will now speak.

11:52.771 --> 11:59.654
Following Senator Warnock, we will proceed to the vote, and then anyone else who wants to make remarks will be allowed to make remarks.

12:00.455 --> 12:01.115
Senator Warnock.

12:01.715 --> 12:03.636
Thank you so very much, Mr. Chairman.

12:04.597 --> 12:15.021
At a rally a few months ago, Donald Trump said that he was going to allow Mr. Robert Kennedy to, quote, go wild on health.

12:16.442 --> 12:16.942
Go wild.

12:18.376 --> 12:24.141
Of all the things that I can think of that I'd like to see a Secretary of Health and Human Services do, Go Wild is not on the list.

12:25.602 --> 12:30.666
Mr. Robert Kennedy is manifestly unqualified for the job he seeks.

12:31.807 --> 12:39.533
And in both my live and written questions for the record, he failed to commit to protecting access to affordable health care.

12:40.660 --> 12:44.642
failed to commit to protecting the people who are protecting us.

12:44.682 --> 12:53.708
The problem that the CDC has is that every day these noble civil servants and workers protect us from dangers that we don't see.

12:55.029 --> 12:59.431
And often you don't get credit for protecting people from things that they don't see.

13:00.532 --> 13:05.054
I simply do not trust him to oversee the CDC.

13:06.515 --> 13:09.277
He's unqualified, and I dare say everybody here knows it.

13:11.823 --> 13:24.569
We need a serious person at the helm of the HHS, an agency responsible for the health of about half of all Americans.

13:25.590 --> 13:39.337
Mr. Kennedy appears more obsessed in chasing conspiracy theories than chasing solutions to lower healthcare costs for working families in Georgia and to make sure that we are protected.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.498
The last thing we need is a dilettante.

13:42.998 --> 13:47.279
dabbling in conspiracy theories at HHS.

13:47.899 --> 14:02.223
I cannot vote for a nominee who is not going to lower healthcare costs for Georgians, who is going to undermine basic science in public health, who puts his own interests above the health and well-being of others.

14:02.423 --> 14:10.685
The health and well-being of all of our families, the people who count on us to think about them in these rooms of power.

14:11.872 --> 14:23.299
I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look past politics and think of country and to find the moral courage to do what's right.

14:24.339 --> 14:25.360
Oppose this nomination.

14:27.661 --> 14:28.702
Thank you, Senator Warnock.

14:29.142 --> 14:33.125
We now have not only a quorum, but all members of the committee are present.

14:34.193 --> 14:38.955
I move that the committee favorably report the nomination of the Honorable Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:39.115 --> 14:42.656
of California to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.

14:42.736 --> 14:43.496
Is there a second?

14:43.596 --> 14:43.816
Second.

14:45.056 --> 14:45.757
There is a second.

14:46.337 --> 14:47.437
The clerk will call the roll.

14:47.937 --> 14:48.618
Mr. Grassley.

14:48.998 --> 14:49.078
Aye.

14:49.258 --> 14:49.898
Mr. Grassley.

14:50.138 --> 14:50.238
Aye.

14:50.298 --> 14:50.878
Mr. Cornyn.

14:50.898 --> 14:51.378
Aye.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.119
Mr. Cornyn.

14:52.139 --> 14:52.359
Aye.

14:52.379 --> 14:52.939
Mr. Thune.

14:52.959 --> 14:53.459
Aye.

14:53.519 --> 14:53.899
Mr. Thune.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.139
Aye.

14:54.179 --> 14:54.760
Mr. Scott.

14:55.020 --> 14:55.140
Aye.

14:55.280 --> 14:55.840
Mr. Scott.

14:55.860 --> 14:56.100
Aye.

14:56.140 --> 14:56.800
Mr. Cassidy.

14:56.820 --> 14:57.160
Aye.

14:57.380 --> 14:57.981
Mr. Cassidy.

14:58.001 --> 14:58.241
Aye.

14:58.281 --> 14:58.901
Mr. Lankford.

14:58.921 --> 14:59.321
Aye.

14:59.501 --> 15:00.081
Mr. Lankford.

15:00.101 --> 15:00.261
Aye.

15:00.301 --> 15:00.861
Mr. Danes.

15:00.881 --> 15:01.202
Aye.

15:01.382 --> 15:01.922
Mr. Danes.

15:02.102 --> 15:02.182
Aye.

15:02.242 --> 15:02.662
Mr. Young.

15:03.217 --> 15:03.677
Mr. Young?

15:03.697 --> 15:03.957
Aye.

15:03.997 --> 15:04.617
Mr. Barrasso?

15:04.637 --> 15:05.198
Aye.

15:05.218 --> 15:05.558
Mr. Johnson?

15:05.578 --> 15:05.838
Aye.

15:05.878 --> 15:06.338
Mr. Tillis?

15:06.398 --> 15:06.498
Aye.

15:07.118 --> 15:07.659
Mrs. Blackburn?

15:07.679 --> 15:07.799
Aye.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.299
Mr. Marshall?

15:08.339 --> 15:08.459
Aye.

15:08.959 --> 15:09.499
Mr. Wyden?

15:09.659 --> 15:09.699
No.

15:09.739 --> 15:09.839
Ms.

15:09.859 --> 15:10.099
Cantwell?

15:10.119 --> 15:10.199
No.

15:10.219 --> 15:11.040
Mr. Bennett?

15:11.060 --> 15:11.160
No.

15:11.180 --> 15:11.500
Mr. Warner?

15:11.520 --> 15:11.560
No.

15:11.580 --> 15:11.920
Mr. Whitehouse?

15:11.940 --> 15:11.980
No.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.140
Ms.

15:12.160 --> 15:12.320
Hassen?

15:12.340 --> 15:12.900
No.

15:12.920 --> 15:12.980
Ms.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.460
Cortez Masto?

15:13.661 --> 15:13.701
No.

15:13.721 --> 15:13.901
Ms.

15:13.941 --> 15:14.221
Warren?

15:14.441 --> 15:14.621
No.

15:14.961 --> 15:15.521
Mr. Sanders?

15:15.561 --> 15:15.601
No.

15:33.612 --> 15:34.352
Mr. Smith, no.

15:34.432 --> 15:35.373
Mr. Lujan, no.

15:35.553 --> 15:36.473
Mr. Lujan, no.

15:36.613 --> 15:37.674
Mr. Warnock, no.

15:37.894 --> 15:38.734
Mr. Warnock, no.

15:38.774 --> 15:39.474
Mr. Welch, no.

15:39.794 --> 15:40.575
Mr. Welch, no.

15:40.615 --> 15:41.175
Mr. Chairman?

15:42.735 --> 15:43.436
Chairman votes aye.

15:46.997 --> 15:49.678
Mr. Chairman, the final tally is 14 ayes, 13 nays.

15:59.722 --> 16:02.723
The vote was, would the clerk please restate the vote?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.252
Mr. Chairman, the final tally was 14 ayes, 13 nays.

16:06.812 --> 16:07.733
The vote was 14-13.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.454
The nomination is reported favorably.

16:10.755 --> 16:13.716
We will now turn to other senators who would like to make a statement.

16:13.836 --> 16:18.800
Since I asked my Republican colleagues to hold off at the outset, I'll go to the Republican side next.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.461
First, Senator Tillis.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.521
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

16:22.762 --> 16:27.283
I voted aye today and I want to just briefly explain why.

16:27.303 --> 16:39.127
I believe in my 65 years, I'll be 65 in August, that Mr. Kennedy will be one of the first people coming before who is in fact not a trained health care expert.

16:39.608 --> 16:41.728
He views this through the lens of an attorney.

16:42.308 --> 16:47.610
He's brought many lawsuits on food safety, vaccine safety, a number of other things.

16:48.351 --> 16:49.051
But Mr. Chair,

16:51.266 --> 16:58.611
I think it was Senator Warnock that said that the president said he was going to go wild in the Department of Health and Human Services.

16:58.952 --> 16:59.832
I hope he does.

16:59.852 --> 17:05.937
I hope he goes wild and actually finds a way to reduce the cost of health care.

17:09.203 --> 17:25.920
I hope he goes wild and instead of having the discussions that we have had for the 10 years that I've been in the Senate of making Medicaid work and making people on Medicaid healthier, I hope he goes wild and figures out how to do it because the status quo has not achieved much in the way of gain.

17:26.941 --> 17:34.749
I hope he goes wild on food safety discussions so that we can actually improve our food safety supply.

17:34.769 --> 17:49.643
I hope he goes wild on the health care supply chains and in fact tries to make sure that drug prices go down instead of bludgeoning pharmaceutical companies get everybody in the room and make sure that we do this right.

17:50.203 --> 18:00.168
reduce the cost of bringing a vaccine to market, reduce the cost of bringing drugs and therapeutics to market, look at the full supply chain, and somebody with a legal mind may do that.

18:00.528 --> 18:02.029
He is no health professional.

18:02.469 --> 18:09.533
In fact, he's the first, I believe, since I've been alive, who's not been a healthcare professional in a scientific sense.

18:09.633 --> 18:15.916
But he is a professional in terms of carrying this forward and holding people accountable through the courts.

18:16.516 --> 18:16.957
And also,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.898
Mr. Chair, I'm not going to go much longer.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.600
But I had a lot of people call me earlier.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.543
I had people from the agriculture industry call me and express concerns.

18:26.643 --> 18:33.327
But I'm not aware of any organized, credible group, the Farm Bureau, the Department of Ag Commissioners, or others.

18:33.667 --> 18:37.510
I did not understand that this was the vote vote.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.451
I thought they had to send it to the whole Senate.

18:39.471 --> 18:41.272
Did he really just get conferred?

18:42.933 --> 18:48.161
And yet I haven't seen any pro-life organizations score this vote or recommend that we should vote against it.

18:49.062 --> 18:52.487
I heard him call the NRA a terrorist organization.

18:52.607 --> 18:55.451
And yet the NRA is silent on his confirmation.

18:57.039 --> 18:58.340
Let's buy the red book, right?

18:58.520 --> 18:59.941
Buy it for your family and friends.

18:59.961 --> 19:02.564
Give it away for birthday gifts.

19:02.604 --> 19:07.107
This book needs to be on everybody's mantle and everybody's bookshelf.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.669
It needs to be everywhere.

19:08.789 --> 19:09.209
Oh my gosh.

19:16.175 --> 19:16.876
Is it really?

19:16.916 --> 19:17.777
He got confirmed?

19:17.797 --> 19:18.297
That's it?

19:18.838 --> 19:20.859
A different kind of disrupter there.

19:21.440 --> 19:35.092
The only way that Senator Kennedy, I'm sorry, Senator Kennedy, the only way that Bobby Kennedy and I will get crosswise is if he does actually take a position against the safety of COVID vaccines.

19:35.112 --> 19:35.192
Wow.

19:35.312 --> 19:36.874
That will be a problem.

19:36.894 --> 19:37.054
Wow.

19:37.074 --> 19:39.836
He answered a very important question to me during the hearing.

19:39.917 --> 19:40.357
No way.

19:41.897 --> 19:50.804
I asked him specifically if it was his intent to let the scientists of the CDC, the NIH, BARDA, and other organizations to work independently.

19:50.844 --> 19:52.686
He said to me under oath that he would.

19:53.246 --> 19:57.870
If he fails to do that, that will be a concern for me and something I'll bring up in a future oversight hearing.

19:58.690 --> 20:07.137
But Mr. Chair, we have not made appreciable progress in Medicaid and improving the health of the population on Medicaid.

20:08.198 --> 20:16.524
We have a SNAP program that does have too much sugar and things that are eligible in that program that should be eliminated to make these people who are on free and reduced lunch.

20:17.145 --> 20:23.229
So this is nuts.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.011
I did not realize that this was the way it was going to be done.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.803
I had no idea that it was just going to be the Finance Committee and then it was over.

20:33.204 --> 20:34.285
Call me naive or whatever.

20:34.305 --> 20:36.347
I just thought they had to go in front of the whole Senate.

20:36.367 --> 20:41.971
And I thought actually what they said here was that they were going to confirm his nomination.

20:42.031 --> 20:45.874
I didn't like, you know, OK, he's acceptable enough to vote on.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.020
So this is really surprising.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.242
This is moving very quickly.

20:50.302 --> 20:59.559
So now on the radar, we should have Jay Bhattacharya, who also should need some kind of Senate hearing in order to be confirmed as NIH director, which would be.

21:00.612 --> 21:16.419
a crazy two for two with regard to the gigaohm timeline and really positive developments because we can't just be swept off of the table, we can't just be dismissed if this is indeed the case.

21:17.079 --> 21:23.842
And so I think we need to keep hammering, I think we need to keep the steady pressure on, and I think we need to keep

21:24.682 --> 21:34.330
restating the incongruencies of the pandemic narrative, and especially those incongruencies that are found in 2020, 2021, and 2022, where all the murder took place.

21:34.430 --> 21:37.473
Because I really think that we have only a few more years before this

21:45.689 --> 21:56.272
truth can be successfully handed down to our children, to the recent graduates of college, to the ones that are currently in college in the next three or four years.

21:56.352 --> 22:07.416
They can be given the real history of the pandemic by giving them this book and making sure that they understand it as the

22:09.730 --> 22:13.233
as the chess piece that it is, as the puzzle piece that it is.

22:13.313 --> 22:14.474
It's not all fake.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.615
It's not all lies.

22:15.675 --> 22:16.636
A lot of it is true.

22:17.577 --> 22:23.661
And a lot of the documents and archiving that this represents is real.

22:24.642 --> 22:30.087
It's just a question of what conclusions are drawn by the narrative that is tied around it.

22:30.984 --> 22:39.946
But if you just took this book and shook all of the primary references out of it, one of the ones that would rise to the top is the Bavari Totoro paper.

22:40.086 --> 22:41.187
It's in this book.

22:41.787 --> 22:50.969
One of the things that would rise to the top is this guy from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Jonathan Cooey, who says at the end of the book that they wouldn't even need a virus.

22:51.849 --> 22:57.271
That's what happens if you shake this book and just distill it down to its most important pieces.

22:59.304 --> 23:11.452
and dismiss all of the other speculation and hypotheticals and worst case scenarios and just think about what you can rely on as true in this book.

23:12.552 --> 23:21.758
And then you see something very real, very useful, something that could push the ball forward in the direction that we need it to go for our grandkids.

23:23.979 --> 23:26.501
I can't help it, I wanna listen to Pocahontas, hold on a second.

23:31.304 --> 23:34.425
out with his son and enrich his family.

23:35.105 --> 23:39.286
The importance of this litigation cannot be overstated.

23:39.766 --> 23:45.007
This is not only about a private company that gets sued and has to pay out.

23:45.547 --> 23:51.389
Vaccine manufacturers often operate on very slim profit margins.

23:52.069 --> 23:55.850
If they get sued repeatedly and successfully,

23:56.730 --> 23:59.552
they simply move out of the vaccine space.

24:00.072 --> 24:04.015
We've already seen this happen with vaccines in the past.

24:04.975 --> 24:12.280
20 years ago, we watched vaccines just move away if they did not have protection from these kinds of lawsuits.

24:13.361 --> 24:25.449
The consequence of Mr. Kennedy's ability to make those lawsuits easier is also the ability to shut down access and manufacturing for vaccines

24:25.816 --> 24:26.796
for every one of us.

24:26.916 --> 24:28.677
And I think that's a terrible mistake.

24:29.958 --> 24:30.298
Thank you.

24:31.378 --> 24:32.759
Senator Welch, did you wish to speak?

24:32.939 --> 24:33.239
I did.

24:33.359 --> 24:34.519
Yes, thank you.

24:34.719 --> 24:39.201
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and thank you, Mr. Ranking Member, for your statement.

24:40.261 --> 24:44.403
I want a disruptor in the health care system and one leading it.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.604
I don't want a destroyer.

24:47.844 --> 24:52.206
And there's three issues before any nominee that we have to consider.

24:52.286 --> 24:53.106
One is character.

24:53.587 --> 24:54.587
Another is competence.

24:55.290 --> 24:56.491
And a third is priorities.

24:57.591 --> 25:00.933
We did not have Carolyn Kennedy here, but she gave a statement.

25:01.614 --> 25:10.939
And she said that Bobby was able to attract people through the strength of his personality, his willingness to take risk and break the rules.

25:12.160 --> 25:17.983
And those might be desirable qualities if it was accompanied by sober judgment and behavior.

25:18.623 --> 25:23.526
Because the person who leads a major organization has to have the confidence of the people

25:24.076 --> 25:25.837
that work for him.

25:26.817 --> 25:37.341
And frankly, some of the things that he did that never explained, a chainsaw taken off the head of a whale, dumping a bear in Central Park for his own amusement.

25:37.901 --> 25:39.242
These are just weird things.

25:39.742 --> 25:46.885
And we never really got into the character issue of what is required for a person who runs such a major department.

25:48.265 --> 25:51.587
The competence question, this is all on a wing and a prayer and a hope.

25:53.317 --> 26:18.735
record of Mr. Kennedy having experience in managing a large organization in medicine, no experience with science, and none of the prior experiences required not only to run a major organization, Health and Human Services, but also the CDC, the NIH, and all the other organizations that are under the umbrella of health care.

26:19.676 --> 26:22.818
And by the way, on the competence issue, let's be candid.

26:23.683 --> 26:28.005
This was a deal where Mr. Kennedy was running for president as a Democrat.

26:28.885 --> 26:39.630
He lost and he approached President Trump to make a deal and for political reasons the deal was made and the appointment was going to be that he's Health and Human Services.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.031
The president has a right to make that deal.

26:42.091 --> 26:45.132
Mr. Kennedy can seek it but it doesn't translate into confidence.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.055
And the third is priorities.

26:47.435 --> 26:51.358
The priority for Mr. Kennedy is about the vaccines and his theory of that.

26:51.558 --> 26:57.763
And we need reliable vaccines and not conspiracy theorists on that.

26:58.423 --> 27:03.527
But you know, the health care system is not working for the American people.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.909
It is too costly.

27:06.289 --> 27:11.513
Our employers who care deeply about providing employer-sponsored health care can't afford these premiums.

27:12.025 --> 27:15.866
The folks who are getting their insurance on their own can't afford it.

27:16.006 --> 27:26.909
Even Obamacare is getting so expensive because the prices are escalating constantly with pharma expenses, with the providers having it, with private equity getting into health care.

27:27.429 --> 27:31.931
Mr. Kennedy's priority was about his view of vaccines.

27:31.991 --> 27:36.432
It was not about making health care more affordable and accessible.

27:36.912 --> 27:40.193
And in response to really a very direct and easy

27:40.862 --> 27:49.870
open-ended question from Senator Cassidy, Mr. Kennedy showed a woeful ignorance even between the difference between Medicare and Medicaid.

27:50.570 --> 28:01.839
So we have a health care system that is not serving, as it should, the interests of American citizens, of American businesses, and American taxpayers.

28:02.280 --> 28:09.245
And I, after this hearing, did not have confidence that Mr. Kennedy would be the one to lead us to a better future.

28:09.366 --> 28:09.706
Thank you.

28:12.073 --> 28:13.213
Thank you, Senator Welch.

28:14.394 --> 28:17.875
That concludes the remarks that senators have requested to make.

28:18.235 --> 28:23.697
And hearing nothing further, I'd like to thank all of our members for attending.

28:24.157 --> 28:25.878
This Finance Committee stands adjourned.

28:38.931 --> 28:49.339
I think I'll be on again at 11.11 with a brief about Brett Weinstein and his last couple podcasts which have just been unmitigated disasters.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.641
A real clown show.

28:52.302 --> 29:02.330
And so I thought I would take the opportunity to archive some of those and to point out some of the highlights of that clown show and how much they are

29:03.149 --> 29:07.152
directed missions of their role, witting or unwitting.

29:07.232 --> 29:19.740
At this point it could be possible, at this point for me, it is possible that Brett Weinstein is actually an unwitting participant in this Scooby-Doo mystery solving exercise.

29:20.480 --> 29:26.724
For the simple fact that these last couple podcasts, him and his wife, have sounded so

29:28.164 --> 29:33.253
naive as they read their script from Heather's laptop.

29:33.613 --> 29:36.859
It's actually, you can almost have pity for them.

29:39.549 --> 29:46.590
One or both of them has no idea how badly they have been used, simply because I just don't think they're that sophisticated.

29:46.811 --> 30:05.294
I don't think, despite their ability to claim their mastery over complex systems, I don't think they have any clue how magnificently they've been folded into this theater, and think it's all because they're smart, that they solved the mystery.

30:05.394 --> 30:08.535
It's really, it's laughable to me at this stage.

30:09.715 --> 30:10.816
Thanks very much for joining me.

30:10.856 --> 30:12.918
I will see you again, probably at 11.11.

30:13.058 --> 30:19.603
Let me get, I don't know, get another cup of coffee in me and see where I can...

30:20.990 --> 30:24.033
If I can get started at 11.11, I've got a decent show for you.

30:24.114 --> 30:41.112
It'll recap the pandemic as it always does and then we'll look at a couple recent videos from Brett Weinstein and kind of analyze what they're saying and what they're not saying and how magnificently they qualify as an admission either to being unwittingly duped

30:42.094 --> 31:02.929
into the theater that they're currently performing, or they have been malevolent participants since the very beginning and now find themselves, you know, basically enacting like a Star Trek script or something like that, where they're just babbling about evolution and nonsense and evolution and nonsense.

31:02.949 --> 31:07.892
And that's all they keep saying, like the beetle that's rolling the dung on their new desk.

31:09.592 --> 31:21.640
It's an extraordinary time to be an American, an extraordinary time to be a patriot, because there are just so many fake patriots on the internet right now.

31:21.800 --> 31:32.888
So many people pretending to be part of a MAGA movement, or a MAHA movement, or a unity movement, or a health freedom movement, or whatever else it is.

31:33.668 --> 31:39.012
And none of these people have a clue what they're fighting for, and have no clue how badly

31:40.112 --> 31:47.377
the military social control software that we have been duped into calling social media.

31:48.057 --> 31:54.821
How, how badly their ability to process reality has been destroyed.

31:55.761 --> 31:56.942
Let's try to help our neighbors.

31:58.523 --> 32:01.925
Let's try to work together to get this information out.

32:01.945 --> 32:02.966
Thank you very much for joining me.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.087
I'll see you in about 45 minutes or so.
