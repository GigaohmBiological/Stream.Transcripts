WEBVTT

00:03.379 --> 00:07.485
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes, and I know that you don't read them.

00:08.118 --> 00:11.601
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

00:11.881 --> 00:12.902
But this one is pretty cool.

00:13.262 --> 00:16.004
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.987
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

00:20.608 --> 00:23.069
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

00:23.109 --> 00:28.093
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

00:28.393 --> 00:30.835
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

00:30.855 --> 00:33.077
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

00:39.129 --> 01:02.322
CQCQ Ladies and gentlemen every once in a while my voice isn't gonna start it feels fine, but sometimes I'm drawing some blanks here So just make sure you remember that I am Katniss as you can see is number one in the chat I'm gonna switch that off and very briefly this thing is gonna pause unless I can do that without a

01:03.345 --> 01:04.866
and do that like that, can't I?

01:05.106 --> 01:05.326
No.

01:05.826 --> 01:06.986
No, that's the other chat.

01:07.026 --> 01:07.447
Look at that.

01:08.147 --> 01:08.827
There's that thing.

01:09.988 --> 01:12.408
Let's do it like that, and then let's do it like this.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.369
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.410
Good to see everybody.

01:16.870 --> 01:24.473
I've been getting all kinds of requests, and so I'm going to address those at the beginning of this stream.

01:25.533 --> 01:30.395
Overwhelming amount of requests recently via email and text message.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.442
other bombardments, so I thought I would just cover it really quick one more time.

01:37.502 --> 01:39.243
Good to see everybody in the chat.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.385
I am Katniss with the big win today.

01:42.865 --> 01:43.625
Checks in the mail.

01:45.346 --> 01:47.927
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooley.

01:47.967 --> 01:54.691
I come to you live out of the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I am the chief biologist of GigaOM Biological.

01:54.731 --> 01:56.672
You can find the stain of my academic career

01:57.552 --> 02:03.776
on the National Library of Medicine's PubMed website using my last name, my first two initials.

02:03.816 --> 02:12.402
You can also find a lot of my ideas distorted and obfuscated in the form of weak arguments between Claire Craig and Jessica Hockett.

02:13.082 --> 02:15.524
and between Pierre Corey and Jessica Hockett.

02:15.544 --> 02:20.346
Jessica Hockett is a woman who lives in Chicago, as far as she told me.

02:20.366 --> 02:37.876
And Jonathan Engler, her co-author on a lot of these clown shows, is a guy from the UK who claims to be a dude who retired from Big Pharma and then decided in his retirement to go to law school and now is rescuing the world as part of a group called Heart.

02:39.557 --> 02:46.781
Anywho, I was picked up as a free agent after getting fired from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 2021.

02:47.001 --> 02:51.083
In 2022 by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:51.103 --> 03:00.689
and I helped him write the Wuhan cover-up book as a consultant until 2023 when I was picked up by Children's Health Defense and boy has it been a long strange trip

03:01.249 --> 03:04.250
And now this is the picture, of course, that everybody gets really upset about.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.311
How can we see these pictures with you and all of these people?

03:07.351 --> 03:09.331
And then we're supposed to believe that you're a good guy.

03:10.172 --> 03:13.453
The only picture that you need to understand is the picture right here.

03:14.153 --> 03:19.014
This is a picture of me and my college best friend, Nathan.

03:19.314 --> 03:24.736
And he passed away because I was trapped by these people in a lie about a little mystery virus.

03:25.536 --> 03:34.983
a Scooby-Doo mystery that I was supposed to be a hero in solving and I think a lot of these people would still be my friends and still be helping my family if I'd have gone along with it.

03:35.743 --> 03:47.131
But I didn't go along with it and this is a stream I'm dedicating to Nathan and in memory to also Brandy Vaughn, someone who said it right when no one else around her would.

03:48.052 --> 03:52.555
I'm gonna mix this in with the theme of Hoosiers because I think we're winning big time right now.

04:17.031 --> 04:27.481
You see, these actors were put in place to curate a narrative, not because there's a virus that they had to hide or gain a function, a virology that needed a cover-up.

04:27.541 --> 04:35.669
It's because their pivot to personalized medicine in the form of transformation and transfection was going to happen.

04:36.289 --> 04:43.079
And they needed an elaborate mythology that would allow that to happen, and that's what the novel virus is there for.

04:43.119 --> 04:51.671
And that's what these people, that's why these people, one of the things they never question is the novel virus, finding it by PCR and sequencing it.

05:02.048 --> 05:06.191
And so the harsh message right away off the top is get off social media.

05:06.231 --> 05:17.541
The way they pulled this off is with X. If they wouldn't have had Twitter and the freest of thinking people on Twitter doing what they thought was chasing the truth,

05:18.141 --> 05:23.723
then those freest and busiest of thinkers during the pandemic would have been free to find it.

05:23.783 --> 05:33.446
But instead, they were trapped on Twitter by an illusion that they thought was some kind of free space that they were interacting with, and that was not the case at all.

05:33.946 --> 05:36.367
And we know that more than ever right now.

05:36.407 --> 05:46.590
It's just a spectacular commitment to lies on that medium and any other medium where you have no idea how it is that you're meeting people and who's putting things in front of you.

05:48.051 --> 05:57.727
These guys, for example, just a clown show put in place five years ago, and ZDogg even earlier was auditioning even earlier.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.955
wanting a career in music medicine or something like that.

06:02.876 --> 06:07.901
And now two of the three of these guys are doing a regular podcast under the banner of the FDA.

06:08.462 --> 06:16.390
And that is not by accident, that is by very careful design, the same way that Brian Hooker used to not say the word autism in 2013.

06:19.052 --> 06:28.979
And now he says the word autism and he says the words health freedom and he's actually helping them to change our children into experimental animals.

06:29.399 --> 06:31.681
In condition that we will not call autism.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.362
I don't like the word autism.

06:34.242 --> 06:35.283
He was vaccine damaged.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.104
He was neurologically damaged.

06:37.985 --> 06:40.507
In condition that we will not call autism.

06:42.426 --> 06:51.354
And so as we move forward and you see that the taller the tree is, the more wind it catches from the big wigs.

06:54.346 --> 07:12.860
Jonathan, who's talking about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

07:14.545 --> 07:16.626
And the calendar keeps moving on.

07:16.987 --> 07:18.848
Your latest video with Paul was amazing.

07:19.128 --> 07:23.251
And the way that these people played me is all there.

07:23.391 --> 07:24.972
Can you hear me better now?

07:25.092 --> 07:25.952
Yes, much better.

07:26.433 --> 07:27.493
There's no explanation.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.555
It was really, like, it nailed down two things for me.

07:30.675 --> 07:35.198
But I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

07:35.439 --> 07:38.921
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

07:42.239 --> 07:42.800
JJ?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.181
Sorry, yes, go ahead.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.304
Are you going to do the CD and tape analogy?

07:48.364 --> 07:51.487
Because that really, really hit home for me.

07:51.587 --> 08:01.176
And I think people would love to hear that analogy because they can A, relate to it, and then B, really understand the significance of, you know,

08:02.975 --> 08:04.996
And so we move on and on.

08:05.237 --> 08:11.040
And the one illusion is that Jessica Rose has been speaking out all along.

08:11.601 --> 08:16.824
She's one of these heroes that's had her mind in the right place at the right time.

08:16.884 --> 08:25.850
And you know the other guy who they've been telling us that story about is Kevin McCairn, interestingly enough, because Kevin McCairn was right in 2020.

08:26.211 --> 08:29.313
It's literally turning into worst case scenario.

08:29.953 --> 08:32.554
And he was also right in 2024.

08:33.095 --> 08:40.379
And in fact that's all they ever had, right, was this illusion that they're all fighting each other.

08:40.439 --> 08:46.502
Kevin McCairn was sure that Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan were real bad guys.

08:47.594 --> 08:48.995
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

08:49.035 --> 08:53.016
But Jiki Leakes, Jiki Leakes has always known that I was right.

08:53.356 --> 08:55.917
In 2022, he knew that I was right.

08:55.957 --> 09:04.301
And then suddenly, he got all wussy about it, all weird about it, because again, he's part of the show.

09:04.341 --> 09:05.841
He might even be Nick Hudson.

09:06.402 --> 09:07.942
He might've even been Panda.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.763
He might've been one of these guys.

09:09.803 --> 09:10.183
Who knows?

09:10.203 --> 09:11.284
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

09:11.404 --> 09:16.326
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

09:17.546 --> 09:24.354
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

09:24.674 --> 09:28.979
What I know for sure, for sure, is that this timeline doesn't make any sense.

09:29.867 --> 09:34.810
insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

09:34.830 --> 09:48.719
Because I told the Weinsteins and Chris Martenson and Alexandros Marinos and Matt Crawford and Heather Haying on Signal in 2021.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.800
Transfections rather than vaccines.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.101
And they never took it.

09:53.682 --> 09:57.523
Insistence and I think even tweeting about it in 2024.

09:57.603 --> 10:20.249
These are traitors ladies and gentlemen And I I don't know how to explain it to you any other way than to say that they're all on the same script And you can't change it I've tried who have inspired a lot of Thought for me people like JJ Cooley, you know who's regarded by a few people as by some people as sort of this kind of

10:21.914 --> 10:28.921
savant or idiot or something, that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.563
And in many ways, they are.

10:30.583 --> 10:34.266
And in many ways they are, aren't they?

10:35.027 --> 10:37.410
And now we're in... The question about pandemic.

10:38.437 --> 10:45.561
And Stephen, your immunology professor said very good, because the question was very good.

10:46.382 --> 10:57.068
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

10:57.769 --> 10:57.889
And

11:00.919 --> 11:04.882
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

11:05.082 --> 11:05.822
It can't.

11:06.363 --> 11:09.305
There's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

11:10.205 --> 11:14.388
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

11:14.849 --> 11:15.409
Interesting.

11:15.469 --> 11:17.610
So if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

11:17.630 --> 11:18.431
You can tell if someone's lying.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.492
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

11:21.053 --> 11:22.374
It's going to crash on me now.

11:22.414 --> 11:24.015
I did something wrong there.

11:26.127 --> 11:28.929
And so we're supposed to stop talking about it then.

11:29.049 --> 11:33.852
If there was no pandemic, then everybody agrees on it, then we might as well stop talking about it.

11:33.932 --> 11:35.953
And that is absurd.

11:36.533 --> 11:39.155
Of course it's absurd, but that's where we are.

11:39.215 --> 11:40.035
That's how bad this is.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.556
But you can tell if someone's lying.

11:42.197 --> 11:43.978
You can sort of feel it in people.

11:45.779 --> 11:46.479
And I have lied.

11:46.499 --> 11:47.540
I'm sure I'll lie again.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.501
I don't want to lie.

11:49.361 --> 11:50.322
I don't think I'm a liar.

11:50.442 --> 11:51.462
I try not to be a liar.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.343
I don't want to be a liar.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.645
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

11:57.807 --> 12:06.677
the specialization should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

12:07.098 --> 12:09.060
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.223
And that's, that's a, that's sort of my starting, my starting bias.

12:12.244 --> 12:17.790
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.321
And I have lied.

12:20.341 --> 12:21.381
I'm sure I'll lie again.

12:21.401 --> 12:22.342
I don't want to lie.

12:22.823 --> 12:24.164
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.304
I try not to be a liar.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.185
I don't want to be a liar.

12:26.765 --> 12:29.508
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

12:33.130 --> 12:37.053
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

12:38.854 --> 12:39.575
And I have lied.

12:39.755 --> 12:40.616
I'm sure I'll lie again.

12:40.636 --> 12:41.577
I don't want to lie.

12:42.057 --> 12:43.398
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

12:43.518 --> 12:44.539
I try not to be a liar.

12:44.579 --> 12:45.419
I don't want to be a liar.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.702
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

12:52.515 --> 12:52.995
It's hard.

12:53.215 --> 12:54.096
It's a hard message.

12:54.136 --> 12:58.657
It's not a message for everyone, but it is a message for anyone looking for the truth.

12:58.938 --> 12:59.998
None of them say murder.

13:00.018 --> 13:05.020
None of them mention that supplementary oxygen induces acute respiratory distress syndrome.

13:05.620 --> 13:10.102
Ventilators were used to stop spread or a lack of antibiotic use being murder.

13:10.871 --> 13:17.676
or mentioned the multi-year opioid crisis, which is responsible for a drastic reduction in life expectancy in America.

13:18.276 --> 13:23.560
And none of them mentioned Brandy Vaughn, even though a lot of them were on stage with her before the pandemic.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.362
None of them explained PCR as a fraud.

13:26.442 --> 13:35.489
None of them explain injection versus ingestion as Brandy put it, or the fact that injection is not medicine as I've stumbled upon myself.

13:35.609 --> 13:38.611
And many people have said better than us before that.

13:39.373 --> 13:44.468
And none mention the population pyramid, which is the source of the biological signal they're calling.

13:45.288 --> 13:47.449
a crisis and none of them mentioned Brandy Vaughn.

13:47.929 --> 14:11.755
How to not say murder is don't mention the supplementary oxygen, don't mention a lack of antibiotic use, don't mention the opioid crisis, don't mention PCR as an ongoing system-wide fraud and remnant stream, don't mention the argument of injection versus ingestion and the biological differences between them, and do not mention the population pyramids neither as a problem

14:12.675 --> 14:18.459
Um, nor as a potential reason for the solution and do not mention Brandy Vaughn.

14:18.479 --> 14:19.400
That's how you do it.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.021
Um, and that's how these people have done it.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.343
You can tell if someone's lying, how they've done it.

14:24.383 --> 14:25.844
You can sort of feel it in people.

14:27.645 --> 14:28.366
And I have lied.

14:28.386 --> 14:29.406
I'm sure I'll lie again.

14:29.426 --> 14:30.367
I don't want to lie.

14:30.847 --> 14:32.208
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

14:32.308 --> 14:33.349
I try not to be a liar.

14:33.369 --> 14:34.230
I don't want to be a liar.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.311
I think it's like really important.

14:39.298 --> 14:42.382
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

14:42.862 --> 14:44.684
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

14:46.666 --> 14:47.427
Isolation, what was it?

14:47.588 --> 14:48.769
Isolation and purification.

14:50.531 --> 14:51.272
Of the virus?

14:51.352 --> 14:51.572
Yes.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.575
Well, you isolate a virus by

15:01.354 --> 15:03.835
finding the virus which causes a disease.

15:04.496 --> 15:09.378
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

15:09.918 --> 15:12.179
I don't understand what the issue.

15:12.299 --> 15:17.742
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

15:18.842 --> 15:19.963
No, it depends on how they used it.

15:19.983 --> 15:21.704
Okay.

15:21.864 --> 15:23.605
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

15:26.820 --> 15:28.783
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

15:28.843 --> 15:34.873
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

15:34.953 --> 15:36.976
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

15:47.868 --> 15:49.110
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

15:49.150 --> 15:50.032
Welcome to the show.

15:50.092 --> 15:52.936
The lighting is a little off because I have the back lights on as well.

15:52.997 --> 15:54.719
So you're just gonna have to tolerate that.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.803
Let me get these cameras ready to go.

15:58.505 --> 15:59.427
Looking a little shiny.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.351
It's been a long, long, strange trip, ladies and gentlemen.

16:05.771 --> 16:10.033
And I'm very, very happy that we're still rocking and rolling together.

16:10.053 --> 16:16.296
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.336
Just one second.

16:18.577 --> 16:19.477
I'll double this up.

16:20.637 --> 16:22.338
See if I can make that go away.

16:24.339 --> 16:24.959
Go back here.

16:24.979 --> 16:26.380
That looks a little better.

16:27.305 --> 16:55.583
Um, I think today is going to be a fun one because what I'm going to try and do is, um, just do an exercise in trying to see the, the biology that we're, we're trying to change to see the, the message that we're trying to change and how it's embedded in almost everything that anyone creates that anyone, how anyone thinks about the world and tries to relay that thought to other people.

16:56.468 --> 17:01.270
This whole bad biology is stuck in there.

17:03.571 --> 17:05.332
Again, this is GigaOM Biological.

17:05.472 --> 17:11.775
If you want to help this message get out, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support me and my family.

17:11.856 --> 17:18.099
If you do that, right now I won't be using the money to do anything other than to support me and my family.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.141
That being said, I've picked up side jobs.

17:23.882 --> 17:35.829
My family and I are doing okay because we have a strong set of supporters that give us 10 bucks every month and we have a couple people that have given us a little more periodically and so we're okay.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.130
But I assure you if we

17:39.611 --> 17:43.432
can get our feet off the ground here and a nonprofit set up.

17:43.472 --> 17:44.733
There are going to be billboards.

17:44.773 --> 17:51.976
There are going to be people like maybe even Mark Kulak that are going to be employees that can be, you know,

17:53.547 --> 18:02.054
really sort of given the soil that they need to blossom in rather than whatever is currently going on.

18:02.115 --> 18:07.379
Now, that's why I'm very happy to collaborate with Mark Hulak on stream.gigaohm.bio.

18:07.439 --> 18:12.243
He also kicks in $100 every month for that, which is like a third of it.

18:13.144 --> 18:20.911
So it's very, very much a project, both of him and I, even though all of the dot-com part is Gigaohm.

18:21.451 --> 18:22.971
So thank you very much again for being here.

18:22.991 --> 18:29.713
If you want to be notified by my wife, before this starts, please send an email to gigaohmhq at proton.me.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.074
We just started using Proton.

18:32.714 --> 18:40.376
I don't think it's any, let's say, more secure than Gmail, it just requires them to use different tools to get at that data.

18:40.416 --> 18:44.237
So I don't think of any one of them as being safer than anything else.

18:44.337 --> 18:47.078
You can send me a Gmail, I'll respond to you however you need.

18:48.845 --> 18:51.166
Is it is it out of sync?

18:51.347 --> 18:56.669
Is it out of sync out of sync YouTube on everything's out of sync out of sync out of sync?

18:59.250 --> 19:04.432
Also on YouTube out of sync I can't tell Hmm.

19:05.193 --> 19:08.494
Oh, I didn't change the I see what's going on.

19:08.574 --> 19:10.815
Okay, that's that's what's happening.

19:10.835 --> 19:10.875
Oh

19:12.225 --> 19:12.966
Interesting.

19:13.246 --> 19:13.926
Interesting.

19:14.087 --> 19:14.647
Interesting.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.349
And that's also scrapping out.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.791
It looks like, um, Hmm.

19:20.932 --> 19:22.393
It's out of sync where you are too.

19:22.593 --> 19:22.974
Okay.

19:23.174 --> 19:28.358
I'm gonna, I'm just going to start it over again, just because I'm only right here and I can do that very easy.

19:28.598 --> 19:29.639
I'm just going to start it over.

19:30.260 --> 19:31.300
Um, we'll see.

19:31.941 --> 19:32.642
Thank you very much.

19:37.465 --> 19:41.809
Uh, on every slide, uh, uh, the first slide I have quotes and I know that, you know, don't read them.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.913
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

19:46.173 --> 19:47.214
But this one is pretty cool.

19:47.574 --> 19:50.295
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

19:51.035 --> 19:54.296
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

19:54.896 --> 19:57.357
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

19:57.397 --> 20:02.398
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

20:02.698 --> 20:05.119
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

20:05.139 --> 20:07.380
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.111
Testing one, two, test.

20:14.131 --> 20:14.912
How do we look here?

20:15.012 --> 20:16.752
Test one, two, are we in sync?

20:18.533 --> 20:21.295
It's possible that there's something going on with my computer.

20:22.935 --> 20:24.456
Testing, test, test, testing.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.878
I see some people saying in sync.

20:27.938 --> 20:30.599
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

20:30.619 --> 20:34.901
I'm chief biologist at GigaOM Biological, coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

20:35.441 --> 20:39.103
In the back of my garage, you can find the work from my academic career on

20:39.783 --> 20:42.585
the National Library of Medicine's website PubMed.

20:43.225 --> 20:59.774
You can also find some of my more recent ideas misrepresented on a substack called Woodhouse 76 that's written by a trader from Chicago named Jessica Hockett in cooperation with someone from the UK named Jonathan Engler, who's also associated with the group Panda and Heart.

21:00.834 --> 21:04.336
They have fake arguments there with Claire Craig and Pierre Cory.

21:05.377 --> 21:09.640
And both of them are, I would consider them, traitors to our grandchildren for sure.

21:10.140 --> 21:16.245
Selling out to the same team, Robert Malone, that appears to be behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:16.265 --> 21:22.650
At one point in time, I will freely admit that I was under his spell in the sense of thinking that he was a good guy trying to do good things.

21:23.250 --> 21:27.112
And I worked as a scientific consultant on the book, The Wuhan Cover-Up.

21:27.172 --> 21:44.361
And during the work on that book, I really formulated the ideas that now form the basis of GigaOM Biological's claims, that these people know that these pandemic myths are myths, and they put something like children's health defense in place to make sure that that myth would never usefully be questioned.

21:44.941 --> 21:48.562
and that the vaccine schedule in America would never be usefully questioned.

21:48.602 --> 22:01.187
I even worked for Children's Health Defense in 2023 as a staff scientist under Brian Hooker, who I also thought was a good guy and have now come to learn is part of this narrative control apparatus, just doing what he's paid to do.

22:02.167 --> 22:19.820
Ladies and gentlemen, I know a lot of you have been demanding an explanation for this slide, and this slide is just simply an explanation of how many people will take pictures of you and consider themselves your friend, and only a few people in this picture remain

22:20.914 --> 22:35.329
my friend and more importantly my best friend down here in the corner passed away from having taken the shot and I couldn't stop it because I was being bamboozled by a lot of the people on this screen just the same as you were

22:36.010 --> 22:51.137
because anybody that was interested in finding the truth was herded like a bunch of cats onto specific social media platforms including that of Twitter, now called X. And I think without that particular platform,

22:51.697 --> 22:54.760
The pandemic as it exists would not have been possible.

22:54.820 --> 22:59.324
The Scooby-Doo mystery as it exists would not have been possible.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.186
But I think we're actually winning.

23:02.426 --> 23:10.333
And so I'm going to put these next few slides and a few quotes to the music.

23:11.253 --> 23:20.658
of the theme from Hoosiers, which I think is a really happy movie about people winning a basketball championship.

23:20.938 --> 23:24.200
And I come dressed every day to win a championship.

23:24.300 --> 23:28.141
I hope you know that that's what I'm interested in.

23:28.202 --> 23:29.202
I'm interested in winning.

23:29.722 --> 23:31.623
And I think we are doing just that.

23:32.264 --> 23:34.705
This stream is dedicated

23:35.632 --> 23:37.214
to Brandy Vaughn today.

23:38.877 --> 23:42.782
Brandy Vaughn is somebody who said it right when no one else around her would.

23:49.827 --> 24:12.475
Please understand that these actors were put in place to curate a narrative not about a virus, but about a mystery that would hide an imperative, a national security priority to change from a FDA-regulated medicine environment to that where personalized medicine in the form of transfection and transformation would become the norm.

24:13.096 --> 24:16.277
And that is for our grandchildren, and they have

24:16.937 --> 24:24.581
made up an elaborate mythology about novel viruses that's going to allow them to do that if we are not awake to the biology.

24:25.201 --> 24:26.542
That's why I'm here.

24:26.602 --> 24:28.763
That's why I think I got a lot of work to do.

24:29.744 --> 24:32.965
But you got to understand it from a different time horizon.

24:33.025 --> 24:41.050
You need to understand that at this point in human history there's something biologically available that may never be available again and that is

24:41.710 --> 25:10.461
genetic diversity and a lot and lots and lots of animals lots and lots of experiments to be done um and so if you want to avoid the trap the first thing you need to do is avoid them putting thoughts in your head that means getting off of social media and especially getting off of x um because a spectacular commitment to lies all that required and you cannot solve the mystery if you get to solve the mystery on their stage because you can't change their script

25:11.641 --> 25:13.743
It's not possible to change their script.

25:14.504 --> 25:21.430
These are just people that are doing the most dishonorable thing they know how to do, and that is mislead the young for money.

25:21.470 --> 25:25.793
A lot of these people on the lower part of the ladder are just interested in climbing the ladder.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.556
You don't think Marty McCarty is some kind of genius?

25:29.596 --> 25:34.360
You don't think that Vinay Prasad is any more than an overachieving student, do you?

25:34.901 --> 25:36.362
Because most of these people are.

25:38.257 --> 25:43.503
but not brian hooker autism um he was vaccine damaged he was neurologically damaged

25:44.290 --> 25:47.011
a condition that we will not call autism.

25:47.151 --> 25:48.692
I don't like the word autism.

25:49.573 --> 25:50.633
He was vaccine damaged.

25:50.993 --> 25:52.414
He was neurologically damaged.

25:53.154 --> 25:55.555
A condition that we will not call autism.

25:55.895 --> 26:04.259
Now there's no way to explain Brian and Polly and all their work recently without realizing that we're pushing them there.

26:05.100 --> 26:09.562
And if you keep pushing and we keep pushing this word out, those people will be brought to account.

26:10.410 --> 26:13.593
and called out on their lack of action for two decades.

26:14.014 --> 26:16.256
Two decades, ladies and gentlemen.

26:16.917 --> 26:24.105
This was a co-opted and sabotaged movement that was sabotaged way before the pandemic.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.361
This is in 2022.

26:29.222 --> 26:47.791
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

26:48.872 --> 26:49.772
And then each of us

26:51.843 --> 26:55.826
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

26:55.926 --> 26:57.587
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

26:57.627 --> 26:58.288
Thank you very much.

26:58.328 --> 26:59.549
Can you hear me better now or not?

26:59.889 --> 27:00.770
Yes, much better.

27:01.510 --> 27:05.373
It was really like, it nailed down two things for me.

27:05.493 --> 27:09.977
But I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

27:10.257 --> 27:13.800
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

27:13.820 --> 27:16.282
JJ?

27:16.782 --> 27:17.643
Sorry, yes, go ahead.

27:18.420 --> 27:28.839
Are you going to do the CD and tape analogy because that really really hit home for me and I think people will would love to hear that analogy because

27:34.440 --> 27:39.602
And so once you see the truth, right, it's just very hard to see it and not see it any other.

27:40.143 --> 27:47.486
It's extraordinary because the way that it cracked now for everybody, and it should have cracked, is this slide right here.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.187
This is the end.

27:51.148 --> 27:52.789
This is really the end because...

27:54.378 --> 28:03.611
At the beginning of 2020, we were told that there were a few problems, a few basic problems.

28:03.631 --> 28:04.372
I'm going to let that play.

28:07.461 --> 28:15.603
A few basic problems, and one of them was we had to make sure that this 5G was never blamed.

28:16.383 --> 28:26.066
We had to make sure that there was no one who really took seriously the idea that it was a deployment of 5G in China that's triggering the disease in China.

28:26.726 --> 28:30.667
And that deployment of 5G in New York, maybe that also explains it.

28:32.062 --> 28:38.188
We definitely, definitely don't want to fall into the trap of there are no viruses at all.

28:38.688 --> 28:56.264
And in fact, the person that told me about Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman and Mark Bailey, and many of us trying to solve this puzzle with Drastic on Twitter and on the internet, found ourselves confronted with this group of people

28:57.930 --> 29:03.737
who said that there was no virus, and a bunch of people who agreed that those people weren't worth talking to.

29:04.818 --> 29:12.647
While they tried their best to be, I don't like to be mean to anybody, I just know that these people haven't really thought about some of these questions.

29:13.905 --> 29:32.542
And the guy who said worst case scenario over the course of the last five years the most, the guy who streamed the absolute most about me, more than anything else besides Jews and sometimes Ukraine and sometimes... The only thing he promoted more than me was India.

29:37.085 --> 29:46.834
And so that never really fully sank in until very recently thanks to the work of Mark Housatonic and myself and other people who have been thinking about this stuff.

29:46.874 --> 29:57.704
But patterns are hard to recognize sometimes and coming back to the history and the timeline over and over again has brought more and more patterns to the fore.

29:58.244 --> 29:59.566
And one of the patterns that

30:00.246 --> 30:08.990
I never saw, and I don't think Mark really saw until very recently, but once he mentioned it or said it, it became very clear that this is likely the case.

30:09.450 --> 30:14.893
A lot of these interesting mythologies and interesting leaks, they're all from India.

30:14.933 --> 30:20.615
The HIV papers, the master's thesis, and the PhD thesis that Drastic found.

30:20.655 --> 30:24.977
Heck, half of the members of Drastic are all from India or Pakistan.

30:25.417 --> 30:33.904
It's very strange when you think about it, how many Indians are now in the government, thanks to the recent change.

30:34.364 --> 30:41.870
It's very, very strange that this guy, Mr. Worst-Case Scenario... It's literally turning into Worst-Case Scenario.

30:42.070 --> 30:46.373
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

30:46.533 --> 30:49.276
...has been only really plugging India.

30:51.737 --> 30:54.780
It's strange, the script that they're all on.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.562
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

30:58.582 --> 31:11.755
We have Jicky Leaks, who in 2022 was fine to reply to Nick Hudson, that clones and a little bit of media cover and taking out antibiotics, that's fine then.

31:12.356 --> 31:16.120
But now, it's like I don't exist the same as Nick.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.425
Now, these guys don't know who I am.

31:19.445 --> 31:23.409
It's hard to figure out if you use PubMed to figure out what they do.

31:23.569 --> 31:26.292
It's not hard to figure out what I do.

31:38.485 --> 31:49.421
Now interestingly, in 2021 I was already teaching all of this biology to Brett Weinstein, Heather Haying, Chris Martinson, Alexandros Marinos.

31:51.495 --> 31:54.136
Matthew Crawford, later on, Jumi Kim.

31:54.736 --> 32:09.101
I mean, it is an extraordinary level of obfuscation that's gone on over the last five years to keep someone like me feeling like people were hearing me, feeling like my message was about to get out.

32:09.182 --> 32:13.963
I was almost invited on Brett's stream, like, okay, next month we're gonna do it.

32:14.023 --> 32:15.124
Okay, next month we'll do it.

32:15.544 --> 32:18.605
I wanna have you on soon, but I don't know if it's the right time yet.

32:22.335 --> 32:23.937
That's how they play everybody.

32:25.058 --> 32:29.623
Brian, I think we should write this Vax Novax book, but I don't know if it's the right time yet.

32:29.663 --> 32:32.687
I think we should time it closer to when I'm going to run for president.

32:34.328 --> 32:38.193
And so they're all on the same script and you're not going to be able to change it.

32:40.205 --> 32:41.585
And it doesn't matter what you do.

32:41.605 --> 32:47.607
You have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like J.J.

32:47.647 --> 33:02.271
Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people as sort of this kind of savant or idiot or something that his ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learned.

33:02.311 --> 33:03.912
And in many ways, you know, they are.

33:05.973 --> 33:08.235
What a strange, strange time we're in.

33:08.735 --> 33:08.895
In 2024.

33:11.217 --> 33:15.740
This is actually more than a half a year ago.

33:18.082 --> 33:20.544
And that quote from Nick is almost a year ago.

33:22.925 --> 33:30.691
And that interview with Bobby Kennedy and Robert Malone and Meryl Ness and Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose is almost four years ago.

33:32.552 --> 33:32.693
The

33:33.934 --> 34:03.116
the zoom call with kevin mckernan and jonathan or john bodwin and jessica rose and and stephanie seneff is from march of 2023 we're now past march of 2025 i mean so you know it's two and some change later these people are still touring the world jessica rose is still pushing theirs and

34:04.013 --> 34:29.281
The guy who came on my podcast in 2021 and told me about frameshift and misfolded proteins and impure RNA started last year with DNA contamination, but very recently is now with Pierre Cory talking about frameshift and talking about

34:30.450 --> 34:32.931
impure RNA and misfolded proteins.

34:33.651 --> 34:46.277
It's almost like we're on a hamster wheel on a, a recurring semi recurrent narrative that is being curated by a bunch of lying assholes on social media.

34:47.938 --> 34:49.418
Now think of the absurdity.

34:49.598 --> 34:59.923
If RNA cannot pandemic, if there was no pandemic, if a pandemic is biologically impossible, why in the world should we stop talking about it?

35:01.062 --> 35:08.184
And Stephen, your immunology professor said, very good, because the question was very good.

35:08.985 --> 35:19.728
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

35:20.408 --> 35:20.528
And

35:23.567 --> 35:26.868
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

35:27.088 --> 35:27.548
It can't.

35:28.189 --> 35:31.950
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

35:32.850 --> 35:37.032
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

35:39.233 --> 35:40.733
But you can tell if someone's lying.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.114
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

35:44.944 --> 35:45.665
And I have lied.

35:45.825 --> 35:46.705
I'm sure I'll lie again.

35:46.725 --> 35:47.646
I don't want to lie.

35:48.167 --> 35:49.488
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.628
I try not to be a liar.

35:50.668 --> 35:51.509
I don't want to be a liar.

35:52.069 --> 35:54.852
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

35:56.973 --> 36:05.820
The specializations should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.222
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

36:08.242 --> 36:11.364
And that's, that's a, that's sort of my starting, my starting bias.

36:12.810 --> 36:16.932
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

36:18.713 --> 36:19.433
And I have lied.

36:19.453 --> 36:20.494
I'm sure I'll lie again.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.434
I don't want to lie.

36:21.935 --> 36:23.275
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

36:23.395 --> 36:24.416
I try not to be a liar.

36:24.436 --> 36:25.296
I don't want to be a liar.

36:25.856 --> 36:28.618
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

36:32.960 --> 36:37.022
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

36:38.852 --> 36:39.572
And I have lied.

36:39.593 --> 36:40.613
I'm sure I'll lie again.

36:40.633 --> 36:41.574
I don't want to lie.

36:41.994 --> 36:43.415
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

36:43.515 --> 36:44.535
I try not to be a liar.

36:44.575 --> 36:45.416
I don't want to be a liar.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.758
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

36:57.003 --> 36:59.764
They are all on the same script and you can't change it.

37:00.805 --> 37:05.668
None of them mentioned that supplemental oxygen induces acute respiratory distress syndrome.

37:06.525 --> 37:21.118
nor do they mention that ventilators were used to stop spread, nor do they mention the lack of antibiotic use being murder, or the multi-year opioid crisis being responsible for a drastic reduction in life expectancy in America.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.340
And of course, none of them mention Brandy Vaughn.

37:24.531 --> 37:38.277
None of them explain PCR as an ongoing system-wide fraud in America and around the world, which provides an endless remnant stream useful for genetic and medical research.

37:39.297 --> 37:46.300
None of them explain injection versus ingestion from a biological standpoint and the absurdity of one versus the other as medicine.

37:46.960 --> 37:57.347
None of them mentioned the population pyramids as a problem in need of management, nor as a source of a potential biological signal that could be the source of this myth.

37:57.407 --> 37:58.988
And none of them mentioned Brandy Vaughn.

37:59.489 --> 38:08.415
Again, the way to not say murder is to not mention supplemental oxygen, or the lack of antibiotic use, or the multi-year opioid crisis.

38:08.635 --> 38:10.797
Definitely don't explain PCR as a fraud.

38:11.337 --> 38:15.020
Don't mention injection versus ingestion, or then injection might be dumb.

38:15.521 --> 38:18.524
And definitely don't mention population pyramids at all.

38:18.944 --> 38:22.467
And if you can avoid mentioning Brandy Vaughn, that would also be great.

38:23.088 --> 38:27.051
There are a lot of giant airplanes flying over my house recently.

38:27.892 --> 38:29.233
I presume that they're not...

38:31.380 --> 38:33.682
I presume that they're not dropping anything.

38:33.722 --> 38:34.863
They're not spraying anything.

38:34.903 --> 38:37.425
They're gigantic, like they could carry many buses.

38:38.305 --> 38:40.027
Some of the largest airplanes I've ever seen.

38:40.687 --> 38:43.309
If I thought that was going to happen today... You can tell if someone's lying.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.651
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

38:47.503 --> 38:48.223
And I have lied.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.264
I'm sure I'll lie again.

38:49.284 --> 38:50.224
I don't want to lie.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.064
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.185
I try not to be a liar.

38:53.225 --> 38:54.065
I don't want to be a liar.

38:54.645 --> 38:57.386
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

38:57.426 --> 39:01.427
If I thought I could have filmed that, I would have had a camera outside.

39:01.467 --> 39:03.027
I just never know when they're going to come over.

39:03.067 --> 39:05.068
But yesterday there was also one around this time.

39:05.708 --> 39:07.609
So again, these actors were put in place.

39:07.649 --> 39:12.490
And make sure you try to expand the way you think about this.

39:12.590 --> 39:15.151
Because if they anticipated

39:16.204 --> 39:41.347
that an anti-vaccine movement, maybe led by Brandy Vaughn or led by Tony Bark, could be a useful resistance to our children learning the mythology of pandemics, then the national security state would have definitely put people in place on social media to curate a narrative.

39:42.304 --> 39:57.397
to make sure that no useful anti-vax movement would be present at the start of the pandemic and instead a controlled, narrative controlled, a narrative safe movement

39:58.248 --> 40:14.091
led by somebody like Brian Hooker, who's willing to say that vaccines cause a thing called autism, and is willing to say that this novel virus can be detected by PCR and can spread asymptomatically.

40:14.171 --> 40:16.632
They're just not testing the vaccines enough.

40:18.212 --> 40:19.032
That's the trick.

40:20.713 --> 40:23.753
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

40:24.234 --> 40:25.934
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

40:28.032 --> 40:30.114
isolation, what was it?

40:31.896 --> 40:32.616
Of the virus?

40:34.158 --> 40:35.919
Well, you isolate a virus by

40:42.722 --> 40:45.205
finding the virus which causes a disease.

40:45.845 --> 40:50.730
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

40:51.531 --> 40:53.533
I don't understand what the issue is.

40:53.653 --> 41:01.361
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

41:01.901 --> 41:03.202
Okay.

41:03.343 --> 41:05.765
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

41:08.288 --> 41:10.251
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

41:10.311 --> 41:12.595
I mean, he actually isolated it, so.

41:12.635 --> 41:16.361
I mean, why should I do all of this?

41:16.421 --> 41:18.444
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

41:24.969 --> 41:28.191
Yes, that's all textbook stuff you're asking me here.

41:29.391 --> 41:30.292
This is take two.

41:30.392 --> 41:31.192
How is the sync?

41:31.232 --> 41:32.153
Are we still okay?

41:32.193 --> 41:34.334
At least kind of okay.

41:34.414 --> 41:38.877
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

41:39.217 --> 41:40.178
Welcome to the show.

41:40.658 --> 41:45.060
If you're interested in supporting this work, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do so.

41:45.121 --> 41:47.302
If you need to be notified, please send an email there.

41:48.322 --> 42:02.931
to Gigaohm HQ and if you're interested in watching later and downloading later and in any number of formats, please try it and see if it works and report back to me at stream.gigaohm.bio and then send me an email and let me know it worked.

42:03.451 --> 42:06.253
You can download, watch it offline, delete it.

42:06.773 --> 42:13.537
You could download it and open your own YouTube channel and start posting these videos as well.

42:14.017 --> 42:16.538
You could just post the shorts that Jeff from Earth makes.

42:17.398 --> 42:20.159
There's lots of things that you could do to help this move along.

42:20.599 --> 42:35.024
And if you were to do that on YouTube, for example, not only could you put your own buy me a coffee link if you want to, as long as you put a link for me too, I think that would be better than what a lot of these people are doing for me right now.

42:35.804 --> 42:38.665
And if you want to send anything, there's a little thing there.

42:40.786 --> 42:46.589
is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

42:46.769 --> 42:49.150
And so they're going to stick to this narrative.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.351
Still good sync, slightly off for me.

42:51.411 --> 42:52.171
My sync is good.

42:52.711 --> 42:54.112
It's close enough for right now.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.212
I apologize again.

42:56.273 --> 42:57.273
These things are tricky.

42:57.333 --> 43:02.055
I'm now streaming to PeerTube, YouTube, Rumble and Twitch.

43:02.456 --> 43:06.057
And I probably should only be doing PeerTube at this point because we shouldn't be making

43:08.318 --> 43:27.291
any content for those people because what ends up happening is they go to Rumble and they inevitably get an ad and they inevitably get an ad and they inevitably get an ad and then they accidentally click or they click on the sidebar because they're distracted by one pause or one moment or one thing in the room.

43:27.331 --> 43:31.374
They come back and they see a thumbnail that they click on and we're lost again and they're on Rumble.

43:32.150 --> 43:34.811
They're lost again and on BitChute.

43:35.531 --> 43:39.332
And so if they come to PeerTube, that's not going to happen.

43:39.352 --> 43:40.752
There's not going to be any ads.

43:40.872 --> 43:43.273
There's not going to, you know, it might be interrupted.

43:43.333 --> 43:45.914
That's why I keep saying, I think downloading is a great idea.

43:46.794 --> 43:48.134
I'm not looking for views there.

43:48.174 --> 43:49.215
I'm looking for spread.

43:49.315 --> 43:51.555
So I don't count the numbers there.

43:51.635 --> 43:52.656
They're not even rising.

43:52.816 --> 43:53.436
So I, you know,

43:53.996 --> 43:55.937
It's my own website and they're still not rising.

43:56.437 --> 43:57.338
I don't know why that is.

43:57.398 --> 43:59.399
Maybe they can flip those numbers too.

43:59.819 --> 44:11.306
But this spectacular commitment to this lie about a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from and that could come again or some worse form of it because we're playing with viruses all the time.

44:11.926 --> 44:19.711
This spectacular commitment to that lie is going to go on until our children understand the biology

44:21.033 --> 44:25.035
which undermines it as a lie, right?

44:25.136 --> 44:26.757
And undermines it as a truth.

44:27.257 --> 44:32.160
I guess I would like to say undermines these lies, something like that.

44:32.260 --> 44:33.541
Maybe that's the best way to say it.

44:34.121 --> 44:39.204
Anyway, that means we have a lot of work to do because we have to teach our children what really happened.

44:39.244 --> 44:40.285
And right now,

44:41.045 --> 44:53.893
One of the ways to get people who haven't seen the stream before, don't know who I am before, other than what I've just said in the beginning, is to realize that right now we are in a crucial state in America.

44:53.993 --> 45:09.762
If you're from the Netherlands, for example, my brother-in-law, my mother-in-law, or you're their neighbors, I would suggest that what you're seeing on Dutch TV right now is a grossly distorted version of reality in America.

45:10.817 --> 45:26.017
It is probably a very similar image to what a person who considers themselves a Democrat and watches a lot of mainstream news and uses a lot of mainstream social media would think.

45:27.522 --> 45:45.836
And in fact, you know, if you think that our democracy is being undermined and attacked internally because Donald Trump and his administration are traitorous, then you're kind of, you know, in the same ballpark that a lot of people who would have voted for Kamala Harris or in fact, anyone but Trump are in.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.818
And I think that's a it's not a good place.

45:48.918 --> 45:50.159
It's not a wrong place.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.620
It's it's the trap.

45:52.901 --> 46:02.369
And although it feels like you're in a very different place than the people who followed, for example, all of these people, you're actually not.

46:02.489 --> 46:05.691
You might think that, oh, I know Brett Weinstein's an idiot.

46:06.251 --> 46:08.013
I would have never listened to Steve Bannon.

46:08.053 --> 46:09.734
He works for Goldman Sachs, you know.

46:10.535 --> 46:11.655
Who's Robert Malone?

46:12.376 --> 46:14.998
I don't even use X. So who the hell is that?

46:15.438 --> 46:16.519
He has a sub stack.

46:16.559 --> 46:17.480
Who gives a darn?

46:18.140 --> 46:19.681
You know, same with Kevin McKernan.

46:19.721 --> 46:20.642
Who's that guy?

46:20.682 --> 46:21.603
I don't know who he is.

46:23.086 --> 46:44.144
And so your family and friends who weren't actively engaged in the mystery solving exercise in 2020, 2021 and 2022 with a group of people on Twitter or a group of people on Telegram or a couple of different groups of people on Telegram, then chances are they don't know who Robert Malone is.

46:44.204 --> 46:46.666
They don't know who Kevin McKernan is.

46:46.706 --> 46:50.249
They've never heard of Brett Weinstein except for in some kind of

46:50.729 --> 46:55.171
you know, joke video about him, and they certainly don't take Steve Bannon seriously.

46:57.012 --> 47:08.638
And so this is a remarkable place, because we think that by arguing with these people, supporting these people, retweeting these people, putting comments on their substack, we're somehow engaging in democracy.

47:09.398 --> 47:14.100
We're somehow active citizens, and that's really an abject failure.

47:17.574 --> 47:27.238
That's the trap, that's the exact trap that we're in right now, that I was in, that most people on the right in America are in, that they think some or all of these people on this screen are heroes.

47:29.779 --> 47:35.881
But the history of even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., if you do your homework, it just doesn't really make any sense.

47:37.266 --> 47:41.307
that that guy is Health and Human Services Secretary right now.

47:41.907 --> 47:59.112
It does make sense that he's doing a lot of things that certain people aren't happy with, but all the people that you see on the internet, you know, showing that they're unhappy, saying that they're unhappy, chances are pretty good that they are there as a kind of controlled opposition, steering you exactly where you're supposed to go.

47:59.132 --> 48:01.072
You're just bouncing off the walls of the trap.

48:01.732 --> 48:03.333
You gotta let all those people go.

48:04.341 --> 48:05.242
All of them go.

48:06.102 --> 48:20.008
I have less than 4,000 followers after five years of at least weekly, sometimes daily production of content and good, thoughtful content.

48:20.388 --> 48:26.711
And it doesn't go anywhere because the internet is completely rigged.

48:27.151 --> 48:31.253
I'm going to escape out of this one and open up a different one and show you

48:33.254 --> 48:46.618
youtube stats um these are let me switch over here uh to the desk huh

48:50.803 --> 48:56.066
This is JC on a Bike, my channel, and this is over its entire lifetime.

48:57.387 --> 49:01.630
And so you can see that I've had my channel since 2019 over here.

49:01.690 --> 49:02.631
I hope you can see that.

49:03.091 --> 49:04.872
Maybe I have to blank that out for a second.

49:06.794 --> 49:07.995
Here's my mouse.

49:08.115 --> 49:19.303
Yes, you can see that and so here is the subscribers by content And I'm just gonna point it out so you can see it the the axis here is 0 to 200

49:22.323 --> 49:26.726
And so, you know, if you see a bump like this, then I guess I got 200 subscribers that day.

49:28.127 --> 49:29.388
And then by content.

49:30.929 --> 49:33.411
And so this is number of videos, I believe, right?

49:33.691 --> 49:33.931
Oh, no.

49:34.491 --> 49:35.972
This is views by content.

49:37.093 --> 49:38.214
And this is all content.

49:39.253 --> 49:58.751
um and so you can see for example here over my shoulder i'm just going to keep looking oh man that sucks now i got too close to the screen my apologies um so if you look here there's a pretty good correlation between the peaks in the number of views and the peaks and the number of subscribers i'm getting you see these big

49:59.552 --> 50:05.436
Green peaks are also associated with rather large subscriber peaks, and there's some correlation here.

50:06.117 --> 50:17.145
And it's really weird for me to be looking at this stuff because it's kind of vaguely looks like inhibitory or excitatory postsynaptic potentials in time series, so it's pretty funny.

50:18.705 --> 50:28.170
But even here, you can see that the signal has some reciprocity in the other one, in the sense of they look like they're the same phenomenon, right?

50:28.230 --> 50:28.870
Can you see that?

50:29.670 --> 50:40.075
Even here, you can see there's a little spike there, there's a little spike there, a little spike there, a little, oh, there's, oh, the correlation, oh, wow, the correlation really went away in May in 2025.

50:40.115 --> 50:41.836
So here we go, all the way from 2020

50:45.228 --> 50:57.276
When I was getting on Zero Hedge and I was riding my bike and I was producing videos on my bike about, and you could say, oh, maybe it's just that those bike videos were so much better.

50:57.316 --> 50:57.997
It's possible.

50:58.517 --> 51:01.539
But this correlation is very, very high.

51:03.380 --> 51:09.545
And the variation in the number of views I get is actually also pretty good.

51:09.745 --> 51:11.866
And then it just falls off.

51:15.134 --> 51:17.016
quite extraordinarily at some point.

51:17.376 --> 51:20.518
Anytime I produce a video, nobody really shows up anymore.

51:20.638 --> 51:25.763
And now, when I'm producing weekly or daily, can you still see that arrow?

51:26.243 --> 51:31.928
Weekly or daily videos over there, there is no correlation at all in the number of subscribers.

51:31.968 --> 51:36.732
In fact, I've got dropping numbers there, dropping subscribers now that I'm going.

51:37.853 --> 51:46.681
So if we go to another metric, this is, let's see, this is subscribers by content again, and that's the purple graph.

51:46.821 --> 51:49.203
And then this is watch time in hours.

51:50.705 --> 52:00.174
So now you can see also that the watch time that I'm now getting is actually pretty respectable in the grand scheme of my previous work.

52:00.294 --> 52:02.016
My previous work was getting around

52:02.790 --> 52:09.316
you know, this much, I don't know what that is, hundreds of hours, 300 hours, let me see, 300, this top line is 500.

52:10.777 --> 52:14.820
So, you know, I, and those subscribers, again, it's kind of correlated with,

52:15.529 --> 52:22.574
The peaks in watch time also give me, look at that, some nice peaks are very correlated.

52:23.255 --> 52:26.898
The number of watch time in hours with the number of subscribers I get.

52:26.938 --> 52:35.965
There's another correlation between the green peaks and the purple ones, but then this correlation just kind of falls apart.

52:36.505 --> 52:38.987
And now there's again, no correlation at all.

52:40.805 --> 52:50.888
It's like at some moment, it's almost really like at some point in time there is, and then at some point in time there isn't any correlation.

52:51.008 --> 52:51.888
It's remarkable.

52:51.948 --> 52:52.708
Can you not see it?

52:53.568 --> 52:59.330
And so it's the same thing if we do impressions, the same thing you can see that the peaks correlate pretty well.

53:00.350 --> 53:02.891
And at some point in time, the peaks don't correlate at all.

53:04.159 --> 53:07.923
And that's because Gigaohm Biological is actually censored.

53:08.123 --> 53:12.507
And I'm not gonna get invited on Tucker Carlson to show this.

53:12.547 --> 53:14.629
Here's probably one of the best one.

53:14.669 --> 53:16.071
This is videos published.

53:17.282 --> 53:18.863
Number of videos published.

53:19.003 --> 53:23.485
So this is the Y-axis here is 0, 1, 2, 3.

53:24.245 --> 53:24.726
You see that?

53:24.746 --> 53:24.726
0, 1, 2, 3.

53:26.566 --> 53:34.090
So the green line really jumps around in units of one or two or three videos, right?

53:34.690 --> 53:39.412
And so you can see my output has never been higher than three videos a week.

53:40.333 --> 53:40.673
See that?

53:42.122 --> 53:46.065
And so there's no real correlation with this.

53:48.487 --> 53:52.630
It appears that a daily video is better than a few in a week or something.

53:52.690 --> 53:54.211
I can't really tell there for sure.

53:54.791 --> 54:00.276
But you can see that at some point in time there was correlation and now there is none.

54:01.698 --> 54:06.006
Even if I do, you know, lots, it's pretty impressive.

54:07.669 --> 54:08.671
That's daily, I guess.

54:08.712 --> 54:10.475
So sometimes I'm doing two a day.

54:10.535 --> 54:11.497
I don't know how that happens.

54:11.517 --> 54:12.900
That must be accidental streaming.

54:14.444 --> 54:16.386
And then this one I think is just nice.

54:17.107 --> 54:20.030
Clear analytics for the last 365 days.

54:20.590 --> 54:24.614
And just look at the subscribers and how those work.

54:25.135 --> 54:30.700
Before I started producing videos, it was pretty much up and down, I guess you could say it was up and down.

54:32.242 --> 54:35.485
But here, this is just remarkable.

54:36.584 --> 54:37.726
There's no way in hell.

54:38.687 --> 54:39.969
Who unsubscribes?

54:40.029 --> 54:43.814
I mean, really, I lose six subscribers a day sometimes.

54:44.975 --> 54:46.177
It's pretty impressive.

54:46.778 --> 54:47.839
That's how this works.

54:49.041 --> 54:50.843
That's exactly how this works.

54:52.445 --> 55:09.980
Today, what I wanted to do was watch a video, at least part of it, with you and try to help train your muscles with regard to thinking about the bad biology and how it distorts everything that everybody thinks about when they're trapped in it.

55:10.760 --> 55:21.544
And everyone is essentially trapped in it, whether they are a gas station attendant, a deli worker, a barista.

55:21.584 --> 55:28.186
These are all, it doesn't matter what you do for a living, if you take for granted that you are the product of your genes,

55:30.867 --> 55:49.373
and that genes are important and that genes equals evolution, that you are a product of evolution as defined by these people with a molecular phylogeny that extends all the way back to bacteria in the sense of you have evolved from bacteria.

55:53.979 --> 56:00.062
There is a fundamental disconnect between reality and what you believe.

56:00.902 --> 56:05.945
And that fundamental disconnect allows the mythology of pandemics to exist.

56:06.465 --> 56:09.106
It allows the mythology of vaccines to exist.

56:09.186 --> 56:12.108
It allows the mythology of autism to exist.

56:12.648 --> 56:16.350
It allows the mythology of gain of function to exist.

56:18.010 --> 56:23.732
It allows the mythology of curing genetic diseases to exist.

56:24.972 --> 56:31.034
And so this is an extraordinary time because I think we can free our kids from this.

56:31.094 --> 56:32.434
And I think it's really simple.

56:32.474 --> 56:35.575
All we got to do is push the boulder down the hill in the right direction.

56:36.236 --> 56:37.276
They had to bring

56:38.701 --> 57:03.269
our society and our collective Western culture to this point of chaos and disorganization and fear and uncertainty in order to get where they needed to go, which is reorganizing our societies instead of around a nation state around something else.

57:04.403 --> 57:06.745
And that reorganization is already happening.

57:07.266 --> 57:09.948
That reorganization has been in the works for a long time.

57:12.050 --> 57:17.896
I wouldn't be surprised, for example, if Donald Trump proposes an Amaro pretty soon, out of nowhere.

57:18.156 --> 57:20.218
North American currency will be the way to go.

57:21.279 --> 57:24.862
And it will all be because this was already scripted.

57:25.123 --> 57:28.146
And it's not a conspiracy theory.

57:29.147 --> 57:31.949
to think that we are being governed by a script.

57:32.089 --> 57:56.829
In fact, it makes a lot of national security sense that we would be governed by a biological script because that would be a very, very fruitful way to disguise initiatives in and around the Human Genome Project as something as necessary as public health.

57:58.351 --> 58:11.119
And so that's why, if you can, try to see how this malevolent harmony of these two ideas of public health as a reason and an answer and genes

58:14.261 --> 58:29.694
equals DNA or evolution because DNA has been a really malevolent harmony that keeps your brain trapped and essentially helpless because you think the vast majority of the variables in your life are way out of your control.

58:31.055 --> 58:37.160
and you're stuck running in a wheel that has no consequences anyway and that's why life is so depressing.

58:37.540 --> 58:44.945
They don't want you to think that you can plant trees under whose shade you will not shelter and it will matter at all.

58:45.306 --> 58:49.489
They don't want you to think about what can you create, what can you pass down to your children.

58:49.509 --> 58:51.310
They don't want you thinking about that stuff.

58:53.370 --> 59:02.053
They want you worried about the all-powerful elites and what the all-powerful elites are doing on their islands or on their big airplanes.

59:03.314 --> 59:08.236
Why do you think they show you this big airplane that they gave to Donald Trump for a week?

59:10.617 --> 59:12.477
To let your imagination run wild.

59:12.537 --> 59:16.319
It's the same thing that you see on Twitch or anywhere else.

59:20.100 --> 59:26.834
It's to let your imagination run wild and fill it with thoughts that disarm you, make you feel helpless.

59:27.836 --> 59:37.160
instead of constructive or point you in the right direction, which is what I think a new Biology 101 could do for all of us, and it's most importantly, our children.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.763
And so that's why I want to watch this video, which I found courtesy of the interwebs.

59:44.083 --> 59:51.686
And the video is, I think, mistitled in my stream as slavery in the name of progress.

59:51.746 --> 59:52.187
However,

59:53.107 --> 01:00:06.413
if you search on YouTube for slavery in the name of progress you will find exactly this video and then maybe somebody in the chat can figure out what the real name of the video is and again this exercise for me

01:00:07.483 --> 01:00:33.472
is going to be to take notes and maybe pause occasionally at points in the video where I'm incredibly impressed with the overwhelming amount of assumption occurring at that moment, and how many of those assumptions impinging on the narrator are actually the Bad Biology 101 that I think we need a new high school curriculum to dispel.

01:00:34.792 --> 01:00:35.632
I hope this is fun.

01:00:41.698 --> 01:00:43.219
No, over here.

01:00:48.843 --> 01:00:50.224
Whoa, it's gigantic.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:03.912
I might speed it up just a little bit if you don't mind, if that's okay with everybody.

01:01:07.374 --> 01:01:10.997
I think we're gonna need that if we're gonna make any useful progress here.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:27.736
I think that'll be okay.

01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:32.479
Canada!

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:33.480
Great!

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.560
Awesome!

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.761
That's awesome.

01:01:35.821 --> 01:01:37.302
Big picture media.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.143
National Film Board of Canada.

01:01:39.203 --> 01:01:39.924
See, there you go.

01:01:40.024 --> 01:01:41.585
It's already, you already know.

01:01:45.488 --> 01:01:48.787
Martin Scorsese, that's why I watched it, I remembered.

01:02:04.898 --> 01:02:11.561
Now, first of all, I think I want to, I want to already preface this as it's coming in that I think this is a generalization.

01:02:12.722 --> 01:02:18.245
This guy is going to be allowed to generalize over chimps versus, uh, versus humans.

01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:29.930
And my guess is, is that, um, it's, it's a generalization that I'm not sure can be made, but let's just, we'll talk about it maybe in a minute.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:33.472
This generalization would be that a kid would not have this problem.

01:02:34.653 --> 01:02:36.855
And you might not even know what the problem is right now.

01:02:37.896 --> 01:02:49.044
But one of these blocks is arranged slightly differently so that it can't stand up like the other one.

01:02:49.104 --> 01:02:53.268
But the chimp has been trained that both of them will stand up.

01:02:53.668 --> 01:03:02.595
And so he doesn't understand that there might be a weight in it that would make it slightly off and not stand on its end.

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:08.838
And that baby chimp is in there just to make it even more dramatic, which is unfortunate.

01:03:18.221 --> 01:03:23.682
In defining progress, I think it's very important to make a distinction between good progress and bad progress.

01:03:23.722 --> 01:03:25.363
I mean, things progress in the sense that they change.

01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:33.025
Both in nature and in human society, there appears to be a clear trend towards increasing complexity as change proceeds.

01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:40.408
We tend to delude ourselves that these changes always result in improvements from the human point of view.

01:03:46.092 --> 01:03:53.416
We're now reaching a point at which technological progress and the increase in our economies and our numbers threaten the very existence of humanity.

01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:07.671
What is progress?

01:04:08.051 --> 01:04:14.254
I think... That's too hard a question.

01:04:17.136 --> 01:04:33.323
Um... When I think of the word progress,

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:39.175
But isn't that so strange?

01:04:39.195 --> 01:04:43.637
Isn't it so annoying that they portray as though we can't come up with an answer for that?

01:04:43.657 --> 01:04:46.038
Can we already come up with an answer for that?

01:04:46.078 --> 01:04:46.338
I think so.

01:04:46.358 --> 01:04:46.698
What is progress?

01:05:05.487 --> 01:05:21.313
I think if you thought about it like Joshua Lederberg would think about it, if you think about it like any real biologist would think about it, if you think about it like any humble Christian would think about it, he would think about raising the most responsible free-thinking adults that you could.

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:29.816
And wherever these generations of responsible, free-thinking, healthy adults take us is where they take us.

01:05:30.736 --> 01:05:33.017
And I don't think a bunch of free-thinking

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:37.302
healthy adults would ever have brought us where we are now.

01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:45.526
I think that where we are now is a result of a lot of very selfish, manipulative, malevolent adults.

01:05:48.108 --> 01:05:51.369
And so it's very easy for me to answer, what is progress?

01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:56.472
I think what is progress is, is progress in raising better people.

01:05:57.592 --> 01:06:02.835
Progresses should be measured on a generational basis or over a lifetime.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:18.837
And those people who have a track record of integrity and having principles when it counts and higher ideals, people that worked three jobs to get where they are.

01:06:19.704 --> 01:06:47.823
People that decided to, you know, humbly accept that dancers never make money and wait tables their whole life so that they could have a shot at being a principal dancer have a lot more respect, in my humble opinion, than somebody like Vinay Prasad, who has done actually anything and everything his mentors have told him to do with reckless abandon, with the idea of getting where he is now, not even really having known where he was going, just knowing that the ladder went up.

01:06:50.117 --> 01:06:52.338
And it still goes up from where he is now.

01:06:53.739 --> 01:06:55.180
He hasn't scored a goal yet.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.421
This is just the start.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:03.926
And so this malevolent game of, you know, people with their own motives.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:04.266
Yes.

01:07:04.406 --> 01:07:12.331
Sometimes the motives are money, but at the top, the people who actually have enough money to control where we're going.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:28.091
control what we see and have enough money that they could spit and pay for tens or hundreds of people to be on the internet full time to help control what we think, I assure you they're doing it.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:36.537
And this is just a wonderfully, highly produced example of them trying to control what we think.

01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:39.278
This is going to be remarkable.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.701
I assure you it's going to be remarkable.

01:07:49.514 --> 01:07:54.420
It seems like we're stuck in this trap for the last 200 years since the Industrial Revolution, where we think progress is more of the same.

01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:57.344
Like, we should make our machines better and get more machines.

01:07:57.704 --> 01:08:00.388
But we've been doing that for 200 years, so doing more of that is not progress.

01:08:00.408 --> 01:08:01.609
We're, like, stuck in this, like, a record.

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:22.098
And so remember, of course, there has to be a lot of truth in this documentary or it won't hit home with most people.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.938
And so this is definitely true.

01:08:24.498 --> 01:08:29.919
I can give you lots of examples from my collection of binoculars, which accentuate this idea.

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:33.800
This is a pair of binoculars from a company in Germany called Lights.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.541
Later they are called Leica because Lights camera became Leica.

01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:46.186
But these binoculars are made to last as long as the metal parts.

01:08:48.428 --> 01:08:55.693
They might not last as long as the stuff that they're wrapped in, but they're meant essentially to last indefinitely.

01:08:57.461 --> 01:08:59.622
And and they're engineered to do that.

01:08:59.642 --> 01:09:05.225
They're engineered to last indefinitely with the idea of lasting indefinitely.

01:09:05.825 --> 01:09:11.167
Something that could be found buried a thousand years later is gonna have a German name on it.

01:09:12.388 --> 01:09:16.509
Because there are a lot of products from the 50s and 60s or a Japanese name on it.

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:22.532
Because they made things and often still do make things to last indefinitely.

01:09:23.572 --> 01:09:24.673
But there is a whole

01:09:26.647 --> 01:09:33.630
malevolent part of our global economy that makes things that are designed exactly the opposite.

01:09:34.531 --> 01:09:48.237
And there are even varieties of binoculars on the market right now designed exactly the opposite, where we are using a lot of resources to produce things that are not designed to last for more than a couple camping trips.

01:09:50.558 --> 01:09:55.140
And that produce enough waste in the production line alone

01:09:56.206 --> 01:09:57.867
to justify shutting them down.

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:12.275
And we've spent five years arguing about viruses instead of arguing about opening schools and getting our kids off of screens and starting to read more books and teach more cursive handwriting.

01:10:14.682 --> 01:10:29.590
Nobody's fighting about restoring the rules to the NBA because we're too worried about what's happening in the Middle East, or somewhere off the coast of Turkey, or wherever the next laser pointer is going to put Cat's eyes.

01:10:32.071 --> 01:10:34.613
We've got to change our perspective, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:34.633 --> 01:10:38.355
The other thing that really is nice about binoculars is they're not a camera.

01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:42.567
You're never gonna be tempted to check what you captured.

01:10:42.607 --> 01:10:48.138
You're never gonna be tempted to revisit or there's no target.

01:10:49.738 --> 01:10:53.021
The target is, wow, that's a sharp image of that rabbit.

01:10:53.201 --> 01:10:55.343
I can count the hairs on its head.

01:10:55.963 --> 01:10:56.844
This is pretty cool.

01:10:57.004 --> 01:11:00.387
Or, oh, wow, I can see the feathers of that bird.

01:11:00.768 --> 01:11:04.811
I can see the details of that hummingbird's head.

01:11:05.232 --> 01:11:06.513
And there's no photograph.

01:11:06.533 --> 01:11:09.996
It's just time zero right now in the moment.

01:11:12.145 --> 01:11:13.826
And I'm not saying that you shouldn't plan.

01:11:13.886 --> 01:11:14.966
I'm saying you should plan.

01:11:15.026 --> 01:11:19.948
But the way that your mind should be working is, in the moment, planning.

01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:22.710
In the moment, planning.

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:30.513
And when you engage with social media many, many times, you are in neither of those places.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.414
In the moment, nor are you planning.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.940
You could be evaluating whether or not a claim is true or not.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.444
You could be evaluating whether or not this person is trustworthy or not.

01:11:42.484 --> 01:11:45.087
But then that means you're not in the moment.

01:11:45.788 --> 01:11:46.749
Nor are you planning.

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:52.316
And I think that's now starting to become more and more a key thing in my own life.

01:11:52.616 --> 01:11:54.498
Is that I'm either going to be working.

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:56.060
I'm working.

01:11:56.747 --> 01:12:07.690
or I'm in the moment with my family, with my friends, with my children, with my dog, in the backyard, with somebody on the phone.

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:09.970
This is a really interesting video.

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:13.911
I don't know how the hell I'm gonna get through it without more than one stream, but hey-o.

01:12:27.654 --> 01:12:31.875
Things that start out to seem like improvements or progress, these things are very seductive.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:33.135
It seems like there's no downside to these.

01:12:34.176 --> 01:12:37.257
But when they reach a certain scale, they turn out to be dead ends or traps.

01:12:39.737 --> 01:12:49.820
I came up with the term progress trap to define human behaviors that sort of seem to be good things, seem to be to provide benefits in the short term, but which ultimately lead to disaster because they're unsustainable.

01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:55.477
And one example would be going right back into the old stone age, the time of when our ancestors were hunting mammoths.

01:12:55.797 --> 01:13:01.738
They reached a point where their weaponry and their hunting techniques got so good that they destroyed hunting as a way of life throughout most of the world.

01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:06.659
The people who discovered how to kill two mammoths instead of one had made real progress.

01:13:07.019 --> 01:13:12.361
But the people who discovered that they could eat really well by driving a whole herd over a cliff and kill 200 at once had fallen into a progress trap.

01:13:12.381 --> 01:13:13.281
They'd made too much progress.

01:13:16.882 --> 01:13:18.742
I like that analogy a lot.

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.763
Our physical bodies and our physical brains, as far as we can tell, have changed very little in the past 50,000 years.

01:13:28.224 --> 01:13:31.046
But we've only been living in civilization for the last 5,000 years.

01:13:31.426 --> 01:13:45.815
I think it's really important to understand that in the last 50 or 60 years, calculations have been made and arguments have been made at the tables of the weaponized piles of money that run the show.

01:13:47.896 --> 01:13:50.858
And they have come to realize that the population pyramids

01:13:52.122 --> 01:13:55.529
of the Western countries actually were the way to

01:13:57.236 --> 01:14:20.591
to shepherd human civilization through time, to think about it from a multi-generational perspective and understand that, okay, we've lost control after World War II for a while, and the consequences of that might be pretty dire for our economies and for our consumer economy in particular, because for about 20 or 30 years,

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:27.585
there's gonna be these, the kids of these big families are gonna grow up to have kids.

01:14:28.226 --> 01:14:45.355
And so if we don't very carefully manage the number of kids that those people have, we would have a population pyramid that would even be bigger on the bottom of it, underneath that generation after World War II, of which you and many of us are, including me, are a part of.

01:14:47.034 --> 01:15:00.964
And so instead of having a population pyramid that just kept getting bigger at the base as a result of this generation having more kids as they got older, what happened was the population pyramid started to straighten out a little bit.

01:15:01.544 --> 01:15:09.370
And instead that bump where my father's families were having kids and stuff like that went away.

01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:18.840
after my generation because a lot of my family, or sorry, a lot of my friends from my age group had like less than replacement number of kids.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.181
Certainly very few families that I know have more than three.

01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:27.643
I know a couple of families in Pittsburgh that have four.

01:15:29.023 --> 01:15:35.645
And right now on social media, it's becoming a real cool thing to brag if you have like seven or eight kids.

01:15:36.345 --> 01:15:39.626
But the point would be,

01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:51.772
that the population pyramid told them that their strategies for governing the overpopulation threat were successful.

01:15:52.633 --> 01:16:09.358
And those people in the Club of Rome and all those other fancy groups, they all knew that they had successfully navigated that problem, that China had also kind of successfully navigated the problem that they might have had, had they let it keep going with the one-child policy.

01:16:09.418 --> 01:16:10.118
But now

01:16:11.771 --> 01:16:34.295
20 or 30 years later, they have the opposite problem, of course, because the older retirement age in these countries does not have the necessary tax base to support their full, long-lived, highly medicated, highly subsidized retirement.

01:16:35.755 --> 01:16:39.916
And that problem was anticipated for decades.

01:16:41.027 --> 01:16:53.255
And so public health has been inserted in our mythology and in our understanding of the world as both a reason and an answer to this problem.

01:16:54.736 --> 01:16:58.818
And a very, very wonderfully sort of applied

01:17:00.063 --> 01:17:04.245
military exercise has gotten us to believe that we experienced a pandemic.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:12.167
And now this documentary comes along out of Canada with Martin Scorsese to tell us where we are.

01:17:13.448 --> 01:17:14.428
It's awesome.

01:17:14.688 --> 01:17:17.829
Which is less than 0.2% of our evolutionary history.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:22.011
So the other 99.8, we were hunters and gatherers.

01:17:22.031 --> 01:17:24.572
And that is the kind of way of life that made us.

01:17:28.613 --> 01:17:29.314
Oh, there she is.

01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:31.696
We are essentially the same people as those Stone Age hunters.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:40.342
What makes our way of life different from theirs is culture has taken off at an exponential rate and has really become completely detached from the pace of natural evolution.

01:17:43.004 --> 01:17:50.450
So we are running 21st century software, our knowledge, on hardware that hasn't been upgraded for 50,000 years.

01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:52.532
And this lies at the core of many of our problems.

01:17:55.226 --> 01:17:56.847
So we're running software.

01:17:56.907 --> 01:17:57.808
Whoa, who's that guy?

01:17:58.388 --> 01:18:04.771
We're running software on hardware that hasn't been updated in 50,000 years.

01:18:06.052 --> 01:18:08.593
And the software we're running is culture.

01:18:10.855 --> 01:18:12.235
Um, hmm.

01:18:13.476 --> 01:18:16.157
So my question would be who installs that software?

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:17.038
Was it my parents?

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:22.011
Or was it the school system and television?

01:18:22.071 --> 01:18:24.892
Now who's installing the software in our children?

01:18:26.914 --> 01:18:29.155
Because again, we want to know about progress.

01:18:29.215 --> 01:18:33.037
Well, there's where the trick of the movie is already, right?

01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:33.857
What's progress?

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.378
Nobody knows what progress is.

01:18:35.939 --> 01:18:41.922
Progress is in what software are we successfully installing in our children?

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:50.385
And their progress will be to install different software in all of us at once.

01:18:51.366 --> 01:18:58.272
So that we're all thinking kind of the same thing about where we came from, and more importantly, thinking the same thing about where we're potentially going.

01:18:59.153 --> 01:18:59.774
And the people

01:19:01.547 --> 01:19:15.560
who believe that they have the right to lie to those people who maybe couldn't understand it or maybe wouldn't go along with it are people like Jonas Salk who wrote the book The Survival of the Wisest.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.824
There's also people like this guy who are very, very interested in exactly

01:19:21.525 --> 01:19:25.948
what Mark and I have called taking control of the evolution of the species.

01:19:26.008 --> 01:19:27.749
They're definitely interested in that.

01:19:27.889 --> 01:19:39.637
This is because our human nature is back in the hunt and gathering era of the old stone age, whereas our knowledge and our technology, in other words, our ability to do both good and harm to ourselves and to the world in general, has grown out of all proportion.

01:19:41.718 --> 01:19:46.842
One thing to remember, of course, about the human mind is that it's not that fundamentally different from, say, the brain of a chimpanzee.

01:19:48.829 --> 01:19:53.011
Most of the human brain, the basic structure of the brain, is much older than human species.

01:19:53.391 --> 01:19:59.514
Some of it goes back to bacteria, some of it goes back to worms, some of it originated in the first mammals, some of it in the first primates, some of it in the first human beings.

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.176
Very little has changed in the last 50,000 years.

01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:03.076
So there it is.

01:20:03.156 --> 01:20:04.977
That's the first part of this.

01:20:05.117 --> 01:20:06.318
I'm going to replay that part.

01:20:06.898 --> 01:20:10.300
The idea that some of our brain comes from bacteria.

01:20:11.798 --> 01:20:19.206
Some of it comes from, and then he lists all these imaginary steps in the phylogenetic evolution of our species.

01:20:21.168 --> 01:20:27.195
And this is the illusion that gets created when somebody says, there's DNA in all this stuff.

01:20:27.976 --> 01:20:33.142
And so that means we all must have come from the same molecular mud puddle.

01:20:34.986 --> 01:20:40.413
And this molecule started replicating and it spread itself all around the world.

01:20:40.573 --> 01:20:44.798
And it got more and more complex over billions of years until now.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:53.549
When, you know, 40 years ago, I made a mixtape with Brian Adams and gave it to a girl.

01:20:55.290 --> 01:21:00.313
And that's all the end of, you know, billions of years of evolution.

01:21:00.353 --> 01:21:13.100
And that, that is a remarkable summary of evolution because DNA of, you know, DNA, therefore evolution, which is what I'm saying is the foundation of this nonsense.

01:21:14.241 --> 01:21:18.363
Most of originate in mind to the world in general has grown out of all proportion.

01:21:20.436 --> 01:21:25.600
One thing to remember, of course, about the human mind is that it's not that fundamentally different from, say, the brain of a chimpanzee.

01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:31.704
Most of the human brain, the basic structure of the brain, is much older than the human species.

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:38.228
Some of it goes back to bacteria, some of it goes back to worms, some of it originated in the first mammals, some of it in the first primates, some of it in the first human beings.

01:21:38.429 --> 01:21:40.410
Very little of it, however, changed in the last 50,000 years.

01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:45.934
And so most of what we do, we do with hardware components that are much older than any of the problems that we face.

01:21:51.414 --> 01:22:01.078
When I first began to study chimps, I thought that the task was to just map out more and more similarities, to find areas of cognition that hadn't been studied yet and simply show that chimps were just like us.

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.421
You can imagine teaching a small child to stand up a block upright.

01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:21.842
And you can teach a chimp to do the same thing.

01:22:22.122 --> 01:22:24.003
Oh, I'll set up a block here, set up a block here.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:24.723
I can see everything.

01:22:24.763 --> 01:22:25.744
It's very, very clear.

01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:27.545
And I get a piece of fruit for doing it.

01:22:29.106 --> 01:22:35.549
But what happens when you introduce a small subtlety into the situation where you trick them and just make the block off-center just enough that it keeps falling over?

01:22:36.309 --> 01:22:44.834
Well, the chimp will come in, set up the good block, set up the block that we've tricked them with, but then it falls over.

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:56.496
So, unfortunately, the first deception here is that he has sped up the video of the chimp when it's frustrated and desperate to get it right.

01:22:57.076 --> 01:22:59.256
And that makes it feel even worse.

01:22:59.316 --> 01:23:02.297
But if you pay attention, you can see it, and it's frickin' annoying.

01:23:02.317 --> 01:23:05.498
The chimp is off-centered.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:12.799
But what happens when you introduce a small subtlety into the situation where you trick them and just make the block off-centered just enough that it keeps falling over?

01:23:13.539 --> 01:23:15.840
Well, the chimp will come in, set up the good block,

01:23:18.737 --> 01:23:22.138
set up the block that we've tricked them with.

01:23:24.039 --> 01:23:30.041
Unfortunately, you can't really probably, you can't really.

01:23:30.361 --> 01:23:35.563
You can't probably see that because it's sped up already, but I noticed it before.

01:23:36.023 --> 01:23:37.203
You don't have to take my word for that.

01:23:37.223 --> 01:23:43.145
You can watch it later, but it's very subtle, but they do do it and it's annoying.

01:23:43.626 --> 01:23:44.886
Oh, now you're not there.

01:23:45.106 --> 01:23:51.592
And they keep trying to get it to stand up, because they know what is supposed to happen, but they have no understanding or no inclination to ask why.

01:23:51.912 --> 01:23:55.295
What unobservable part of the situation is causing that block to keep falling over?

01:23:56.496 --> 01:24:00.959
The young child will enter, set up the good block, try to set up the block that we've tricked them with.

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:03.942
But when it falls over, well, first they'll try again, and maybe try again.

01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:06.004
But very quickly, they'll turn it.

01:24:06.204 --> 01:24:07.665
How old do you think that kid is?

01:24:08.766 --> 01:24:09.346
Is he 10?

01:24:10.367 --> 01:24:11.128
He's not four.

01:24:13.368 --> 01:24:23.230
So the question now becomes like, okay, so I kind of sort of appreciate what this guy's doing as a neuroscientist or former neuroscientist, former academic.

01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:40.814
I like the idea that he's trying to probe what higher faculties the monkey has and doesn't have relative to the human.

01:24:40.854 --> 01:24:42.254
What strategies are used

01:24:43.194 --> 01:24:47.980
by the human and not the human, but I don't think this one is a very fair comparison.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:52.587
And certainly not in anecdotal presentation like this.

01:24:54.509 --> 01:24:57.693
I find this, well, anyway, let's just watch it.

01:24:58.874 --> 01:24:59.274
I'll shut up.

01:24:59.814 --> 01:25:01.515
Get over, feel the bottom of it, shake it.

01:25:01.735 --> 01:25:06.136
Try to discern what unobservable property of that block is causing it to fall over.

01:25:06.997 --> 01:25:11.718
That's the fundamental core difference, I believe, between humans and chimps, that humans ask why.

01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:13.959
We're constantly probing for unobservable.

01:25:14.159 --> 01:25:21.021
So do we know, for example, in that experiment that that kid already got lots of marshmallows for standing them up?

01:25:21.101 --> 01:25:22.601
Because you see, that's the difference.

01:25:22.721 --> 01:25:24.062
This monkey thinks

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:39.404
that it's in a situation where it's gonna get rewarded if it does it right from the only, this is the heartbreaking part, from the only humans that interact with it in a totally positive way.

01:25:41.294 --> 01:25:47.202
They're not even allowed to go, yay, you know, good job and clap their hands or get excited.

01:25:47.702 --> 01:25:52.368
They're actually not supposed to make any eye contact with the ape at all.

01:25:52.849 --> 01:25:56.734
And they're supposed to try and show no emotion at all when they reward them.

01:25:58.894 --> 01:26:12.135
And so if you also realize that their caretakers are not allowed to be nice to them or talk to them or make friends with them, but actually distance themselves on purpose, because they know at any point in time they could come back and the cage will be empty.

01:26:14.318 --> 01:26:17.440
then that's not just an animal chilling with its baby.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:27.606
That is an animal under a lot of stress, trying to figure out under pressure, why it is that something that she has learned very well how to do, why it's not working anymore.

01:26:28.127 --> 01:26:39.854
And she's panicking because she doesn't know if this once in a week social interaction that could result in tasty food and otherwise will not, why it's going wrong.

01:26:41.141 --> 01:26:48.664
That kid sitting with his mom, who's being told by his mom, yeah, just see if you can stand up the block, honey.

01:26:49.625 --> 01:26:51.165
See, they're both the same, honey.

01:26:51.525 --> 01:26:57.688
It's not the same as if you drilled that kid for a couple, three weeks where you didn't interact with him at all.

01:26:57.728 --> 01:27:01.770
And when you did interact with him, he had to stand those blocks up and he would get marshmallows.

01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:04.171
And otherwise, it's back to the cage for you.

01:27:07.697 --> 01:27:13.739
And so don't get me wrong, I'm not saying if we treated monkeys right, they would be like people and learn to talk and we'd be on the planet of the apes.

01:27:13.799 --> 01:27:32.624
But what I am saying is that what always inevitably happens with these neuroscientists is they don't understand their own experiments enough to realize that holy shit, we better reconsider everything we do with these animals because the control situation is a mental and physical prisoner.

01:27:35.106 --> 01:27:40.960
A mental and physical prisoner that would otherwise have 10 conspecifics around him or her.

01:27:42.263 --> 01:27:44.147
Conspecifics meaning other monkeys.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:55.268
So this is a remarkable lack of connection with the biology that he's purporting to study.

01:27:55.729 --> 01:28:05.059
Because if he was really studying what he purported to study, which is the differences between humans and apes, then the assumption list is that

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:09.457
they could have all of these things that we have.

01:28:09.978 --> 01:28:14.802
And now I'm going to cross some of those things off of the list that monkeys don't have.

01:28:15.363 --> 01:28:15.763
Why?

01:28:16.204 --> 01:28:19.747
Because supposedly some of the stuff in our brain comes from bacteria.

01:28:20.167 --> 01:28:21.589
Some of it comes from worms.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:25.753
Some of it came from the lower mammals and now some of it is our own.

01:28:29.918 --> 01:28:40.261
And so he appears to be engaged in a proper investigation as to what the difference between monkeys and apes is.

01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:51.945
But his assumptions are that they have virtually nothing we have, instead of assuming that they have everything we have but these things.

01:28:53.185 --> 01:28:54.766
And it ain't the question why.

01:28:56.129 --> 01:29:03.330
I assure you it's not the question why, or if it is, this guy has not demonstrated it with his experiment.

01:29:07.613 --> 01:29:09.255
phenomenon to explain the observable.

01:29:09.535 --> 01:29:11.518
It's what's driven us to discover gravity.

01:29:11.898 --> 01:29:14.501
It's what's driven us to probe into the mysteries of quasars.

01:29:15.062 --> 01:29:19.507
And it's the same thing that drives us to probe into the mysteries of each other in our everyday lives.

01:29:19.928 --> 01:29:21.269
Why does she keep doing that?

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.851
Why does he keep behaving like that?

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:23.672
He must think this.

01:29:23.712 --> 01:29:24.513
He must believe this.

01:29:24.954 --> 01:29:26.796
I don't understand why, why, why, why, why.

01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:46.685
oh wow and so um interesting like he thinks that he knows that about humans but he doesn't assume that about another social animal and about how maybe that's how social hierarchies in in apes would also be organized i mean isn't that what evolution would tell you?

01:29:49.537 --> 01:29:57.825
But remarkably, he's got this, you know, no problem juggling these very contradictory thoughts, you know, in all the same juggling act.

01:29:58.866 --> 01:30:07.594
That's what academic biology has become because of the gross assumption, evolution because DNA.

01:30:07.634 --> 01:30:11.137
So he's just talking because that's how they talk.

01:30:19.636 --> 01:30:27.698
So the upside of the human capacity to ask why, to continually probe behind appearances, and to try to find out how the world really works, is we develop fabulous new medicines.

01:30:27.758 --> 01:30:30.439
We develop fabulous new therapeutic techniques to take care of people.

01:30:31.219 --> 01:30:33.559
We invent a whole cascade of modern technology.

01:30:38.361 --> 01:30:40.081
Wow, don't forget about nuclear bombs.

01:30:47.691 --> 01:30:48.171
What was that?

01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:49.632
Did it just hit the firmament there?

01:30:49.652 --> 01:30:50.712
That was weird.

01:30:50.732 --> 01:30:51.333
I never saw that before.

01:30:51.353 --> 01:30:54.674
The downside is that we invent the whole cascade of modern technology.

01:31:01.198 --> 01:31:04.539
Arguably, we are the most intellectual creature that ever walked on planet Earth.

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:11.182
So how come, then, that this so intellectual being is destroying its only home?

01:31:11.202 --> 01:31:12.163
Because we only have the one home.

01:31:13.376 --> 01:31:16.157
Maybe one day people will be on Mars, but for the moment we've got planet Earth.

01:31:16.678 --> 01:31:22.741
And we are destroying, we are polluting, we are damaging the future of our own species, which is very counterproductive from an evolutionary perspective.

01:31:23.661 --> 01:31:27.203
Now, I would argue counterproductive from an evolutionary perspective.

01:31:27.243 --> 01:31:29.244
That's her telling you the same narrative.

01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:37.689
Remember that Jane Goodall made her money over the last 10 or 15 years touring around, not doing TED Talks at high schools.

01:31:38.834 --> 01:31:49.783
But doing TED Talks at big bank meetings and conferences for the WEF and for other global NGOs, making thousands of dollars traveling first class, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:50.263 --> 01:31:56.869
She's not a, you know, the master grifter or anything like that, but she is a very, very useful pawn.

01:31:57.649 --> 01:32:06.915
And ever since she said this stuff out loud the first time, she has become much more successful, not in selling books, but in private lecturing.

01:32:07.575 --> 01:32:08.736
Amazing success.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.420
Here we go.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.182
You knew it was coming.

01:32:21.308 --> 01:32:27.531
this capacity that seems so wonderful to us, the ability to ask why, the very ability that undergirds modern science as a double-edged sword.

01:32:30.353 --> 01:32:35.856
See, our ability to ask why has led to nukes and also, I guess, gain-of-function viruses.

01:32:36.096 --> 01:32:37.056
Man, oh man.

01:32:43.559 --> 01:32:48.022
If humans go extinct on this planet, I think what's gonna be our epitaph on our gravestone is why.

01:33:00.253 --> 01:33:08.900
We have the ability to think into the future, but most of our mechanisms, most of our brain mechanisms, evolved before we had any ability to think forward to the future, and when it made some sense for decisions to be short-term.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:15.365
And so a lot of our brain mechanisms, what I call our ancestral mechanisms, or our reflexive mechanisms, are tuned to making snap decisions right away, like fight or flight.

01:33:15.385 --> 01:33:17.246
You see the lion, either you're going to fight or you're going to run.

01:33:17.266 --> 01:33:19.308
No time to think about long-term consequences.

01:33:19.548 --> 01:33:22.791
And that's good when we're stressed about something immediate that we can deal with, for example.

01:33:22.871 --> 01:33:30.719
But those very systems that work by reflex are not so good at cooperating with these more modern systems, the deliberative systems that allow us to make long-term decisions and say, well, is this good for me?

01:33:30.979 --> 01:33:32.401
Is it good for my society, for my planet?

01:33:33.081 --> 01:33:35.964
Is this good for my society, for my planet?

01:33:36.024 --> 01:33:37.586
Ladies and gentlemen, they said the...

01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:58.482
The truth kind of in the beginning from a neurobiological perspective, I think one of the advances of humans, you know, that really makes us, from a biological perspective, different from a lot of the other animals on Earth, is that we are hardware that can accept software.

01:34:01.244 --> 01:34:06.148
That a lot of what is built into us can be altered.

01:34:07.319 --> 01:34:15.486
over a adolescence, a childhood and adolescence that's longer than any other animal on earth.

01:34:16.987 --> 01:34:29.879
And so that allows the, sort of requires the development over time of a set of cognitive behavioral rules that can be necessarily much more complex

01:34:31.184 --> 01:34:37.448
a set of language that can be much more complex simply because of that extended developmental time frame.

01:34:39.209 --> 01:35:00.522
And so this argument that the chimp and the man are 99% the same, and definitely if you look at their brain, they're close to the same, this finds itself fundamentally disconnected from the idea that we are contemporaries.

01:35:02.771 --> 01:35:17.075
And by comparing these in the way that they compare it, the idea is that somewhere along the line is humans are the pinnacle of evolution instead of one of many contemporaries.

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:23.477
And so maybe that's a good place for me to spin over here.

01:35:27.698 --> 01:35:30.959
If we just think about evolution as time,

01:35:33.024 --> 01:35:42.900
going in this axis and, you know, the number of animals we started with, according to these people, we start with bacteria.

01:35:44.372 --> 01:35:51.319
And then over time, there's this thing that branches and it's something like this, let's say, okay.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:59.888
And there's life form A, life form B, life form C, and life form D that's ultimately descended from bacteria.

01:36:00.468 --> 01:36:02.370
And maybe that's B right here.

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:03.591
These are B bacteria.

01:36:04.612 --> 01:36:17.060
Then there's A, B, and C. And the idea that often gets said very, very lackadaisically is that we are all descended from a common ancestor.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.381
Well, then that implies this.

01:36:19.181 --> 01:36:28.968
That implies somewhere along the line there was an ancestor that could not be differentiated, a bacteria versus a fungi or whatever this thing is here.

01:36:29.628 --> 01:36:30.489
You can just call this B.

01:36:31.809 --> 01:36:37.331
This is single cell bacteria, some kind of like, you know, unit life.

01:36:38.071 --> 01:36:44.554
And then that unit life is over here somewhere with a contemporary version of it, but we are descended from that unit life.

01:36:45.694 --> 01:36:46.975
That's the story they tell us.

01:36:47.035 --> 01:36:49.075
And in our particular story, it's bacteria.

01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:53.517
And so in this somewhere are chimps and humans, right?

01:36:54.558 --> 01:37:00.940
And so chimps and humans differentiated from, they spread apart from a common ancestor,

01:37:03.226 --> 01:37:05.409
that descended ultimately from bacteria.

01:37:05.489 --> 01:37:17.344
That is exactly what evolution, evolution because DNA means.

01:37:17.524 --> 01:37:19.487
It is a molecular phylogeny.

01:37:21.141 --> 01:37:43.247
It is a molecular phylogeny and the branches of this tree are based on this story that a molecule here can be compared to a molecule here and a molecule here and whichever one has the molecule that's closely related to here is closer to the root of the tree.

01:37:44.367 --> 01:37:51.212
and now send all the biologists out there and get them to measure lots of stuff and construct a tree like this.

01:37:51.292 --> 01:38:12.068
Now, there have been trees like this that have been made from a perspective of anatomy and feather colors and beak shape and all of these other things to imply snapshots in what is inevitably a all-encompassing tree of life that goes through time

01:38:13.999 --> 01:38:14.259
right?

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:18.583
And, and evolves from something to everything.

01:38:21.246 --> 01:38:32.857
And that's evolution because DNA, that's a process of self-assembly of translating proteins and them doing stuff that lucky for you results in

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:43.184
sort of consciousness and all the things that we experienced in high school, like, you know, love and revenge and crushes and all that stuff.

01:38:43.204 --> 01:38:54.309
That's all just, it's all just an illusion that's created by your little, your little brief experience on this, you know, billion year long timeframe.

01:38:55.750 --> 01:39:01.813
And so that's what this precisely serves for, is to make you think that you're insignificant

01:39:03.138 --> 01:39:09.240
relative to all this, when in reality the only thing of significance is this.

01:39:11.381 --> 01:39:22.186
And that's what I see with regard to the binoculars and looking at nature through binoculars, looking at your world through binoculars to change your perspective to be able to see farther away.

01:39:23.314 --> 01:39:33.100
to see from a different vantage point, and to see with different depth of field, and more importantly, to be present in the moment.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.001
Because that's all that really matters.

01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:38.844
I'm not trying to sound like these guru clowns.

01:39:38.904 --> 01:39:46.949
What I'm trying to do is to break the spell that evolution, because DNA, inevitably casts on everybody that hears it.

01:39:46.989 --> 01:39:49.611
That we're just a blip

01:39:50.916 --> 01:39:57.559
You know, a single grain of sand in this infinitely large hourglass that is human evolution.

01:39:57.619 --> 01:39:59.320
And therefore, you better surrender.

01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:03.082
Maybe what I'm doing is not so good for the species.

01:40:04.703 --> 01:40:08.585
The only thing you can control are the kids you raise.

01:40:10.697 --> 01:40:16.080
That's the only control you have over the evolution of the species, the evolution of human culture.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.162
And they are attempting to take over the evolution of human culture.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:22.603
You like that Scooby-Doo?

01:40:23.824 --> 01:40:36.470
Take that over that evolution of that culture by getting us to acquiesce to social media where they can control the narrative and thereby control the culture, at least what the culture is focused on.

01:40:39.632 --> 01:40:40.292
That's what I think.

01:40:54.465 --> 01:41:00.731
Between the fall of the Roman Empire and Columbus sailing, it took 13 centuries to add 200 million people to the world's population.

01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:02.092
Now it takes only three years.

01:41:02.112 --> 01:41:13.122
A simple thing like pasteurization, the warming of milk so that the bacteria are killed, and the control of smallpox, things like that have led to a great boom in human numbers.

01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:25.946
So overpopulation, which nobody really wants to talk about because it cuts at things like religious beliefs and the freedom of the individual and the autonomy of the family and so forth, is something that we're going to have to deal with.

01:41:27.506 --> 01:41:32.428
We probably have to work towards a much smaller worldwide population than six or seven billion.

01:41:32.448 --> 01:41:38.671
We probably need to go down to a half that or possibly even a third of that if everybody is going to live comfortably and decently.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.221
Ta-da!

01:42:15.856 --> 01:42:19.238
If China were to reach the level of consumption... Finite resources!

01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:23.159
It's very unlikely that the world could support the addition of a billion consumers at that level.

01:42:23.459 --> 01:42:25.440
Finite resources.

01:42:26.081 --> 01:42:27.421
Finite resources.

01:42:38.254 --> 01:42:41.235
Let's say in China, maybe 200, 300 million people are quote-unquote affluent.

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:45.337
You know, they could afford, relatively speaking, you know, what we get in the West, in the Indias or whatever, 200 million, you know?

01:42:45.517 --> 01:42:53.021
So you add up these affluent segments of population in these developing countries or marginalized countries, but still you come up with no more than one and a half, maybe two billion people.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:43:01.004
So there is still five billion people waiting to tap into these bonanzas of, you know, plentiful food, cars, decent housing, right?

01:43:01.205 --> 01:43:02.345
Higher education for their children.

01:43:02.505 --> 01:43:04.386
So the potential demand for resources is immense.

01:43:09.088 --> 01:43:23.591
I don't know how many kilometers of personal driving experience he has, but his driving experience as a leader has reached more than 500,000 kilometers.

01:43:23.611 --> 01:43:24.752
Whose driver is this?

01:43:24.792 --> 01:43:25.452
Is this the one?

01:43:25.492 --> 01:43:25.612
Yes.

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.112
A little higher.

01:43:29.193 --> 01:43:29.313
Stop.

01:43:29.373 --> 01:43:29.553
Stop.

01:43:29.573 --> 01:43:29.673
Go.

01:43:29.693 --> 01:43:29.733
Go.

01:43:29.773 --> 01:43:29.953
Go.

01:43:31.593 --> 01:43:31.713
Stop.

01:43:44.545 --> 01:43:45.146
We'll leave later.

01:43:45.166 --> 01:43:47.930
We'll leave after the car in front passes.

01:43:56.257 --> 01:43:58.118
The Journey to the West is a story about the ancient legend of China.

01:43:58.678 --> 01:43:59.479
It's a legend, a myth.

01:43:59.539 --> 01:44:01.680
The four disciples go to the West to get the scriptures.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.240
It's a myth.

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.521
I'm the monk Tang in the team.

01:44:03.701 --> 01:44:04.161
I'm the master.

01:44:04.181 --> 01:44:09.004
I lead the disciples to the West to get the scriptures, to get the essence of life, to enjoy the essence of life.

01:44:21.278 --> 01:44:26.761
They live in a small village on the bank of the river.

01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:29.362
That's how it is in their village.

01:44:29.422 --> 01:44:33.484
Basically, there are no refrigerators at home.

01:44:34.045 --> 01:44:38.367
If you want to buy meat, you have to go to a county town 30 kilometers away.

01:44:38.387 --> 01:44:39.127
You don't go once a week.

01:44:39.147 --> 01:44:40.648
You may only go once a week.

01:44:51.755 --> 01:44:55.576
My grandma canned, so she had like a cellar full of canned stuff.

01:44:55.596 --> 01:44:57.336
So I think she had tomatoes over the winter, sorry.

01:45:21.124 --> 01:45:22.084
You can eat seafood at any time.

01:45:22.104 --> 01:45:29.848
I didn't dare to think about this when I was a kid.

01:45:29.888 --> 01:45:36.971
The economic development of China, I think, in the past 30 years, the world's evaluation is basically the same.

01:45:37.011 --> 01:45:43.473
Whether you like China or you don't like China, we had a lot of problems in the past 30 years, such as environmental problems.

01:45:51.482 --> 01:45:54.043
The environment in Beijing was very bad before the Olympic Games.

01:45:54.443 --> 01:45:55.083
Now it has changed a lot.

01:45:55.103 --> 01:45:55.543
You can't say that.

01:45:55.563 --> 01:45:56.664
We've been paying attention to this.

01:45:56.684 --> 01:45:57.844
We've been avoiding this all the time.

01:45:57.864 --> 01:45:58.924
We've been trying to control this.

01:45:58.944 --> 01:46:00.425
This is not a question of going.

01:46:00.445 --> 01:46:01.305
This is not an interview for you.

01:46:01.325 --> 01:46:03.406
The whole world knows that you can't say it with your mouth.

01:46:03.426 --> 01:46:04.066
What do you mean, don't say it?

01:46:04.086 --> 01:46:05.286
What you said is very problematic, you know?

01:46:05.306 --> 01:46:06.207
We've been trying to control this.

01:46:06.247 --> 01:46:07.847
If it doesn't work, I've been working for so many years.

01:46:07.887 --> 01:46:09.908
I'm the one who has accumulated the current situation.

01:46:09.948 --> 01:46:12.029
If you do this, it will hurt me a lot.

01:46:12.049 --> 01:46:12.549
Do you understand?

01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:13.769
If you do this, it will hurt me a lot.

01:46:13.809 --> 01:46:14.569
You don't understand.

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:42.327
I don't know why I'm supposed to feel bad for him.

01:46:42.707 --> 01:46:44.367
Did his dad interrupt him somehow?

01:46:44.447 --> 01:46:46.948
I don't... What did he say?

01:46:50.373 --> 01:46:52.675
The environment in Beijing was very bad before the Olympics.

01:46:52.695 --> 01:46:53.935
Now it has improved a lot.

01:46:53.955 --> 01:46:54.396
You can't say that.

01:46:54.416 --> 01:46:55.496
We've been paying attention to this.

01:46:55.516 --> 01:46:56.397
I've been avoiding this all the time.

01:46:56.417 --> 01:46:57.518
We've been paying attention to controlling this.

01:46:57.538 --> 01:46:57.938
You can't say that.

01:46:57.998 --> 01:46:59.239
It's not a question of going.

01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:00.219
It's not an interview for you now.

01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.080
The whole world knows.

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.281
You can't say it with your mouth.

01:47:02.301 --> 01:47:02.701
Don't say it.

01:47:02.721 --> 01:47:03.441
What do you mean don't say it?

01:47:03.642 --> 01:47:05.463
You say this is very problematic, you know?

01:47:05.483 --> 01:47:06.543
We've been controlling this.

01:47:06.563 --> 01:47:07.024
It's not a problem.

01:47:07.044 --> 01:47:07.624
It's not a problem.

01:47:08.084 --> 01:47:10.246
I've been working in this studio for so many years.

01:47:10.426 --> 01:47:11.447
That's how I got to where I am now.

01:47:11.467 --> 01:47:12.047
You can't do that.

01:47:12.107 --> 01:47:12.787
It hurts me a lot.

01:47:12.807 --> 01:47:13.388
Do you understand?

01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:13.928
You can't do that.

01:47:13.968 --> 01:47:15.369
It hurts me a lot.

01:47:15.389 --> 01:47:16.330
You don't understand.

01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.910
You don't understand.

01:47:18.885 --> 01:47:20.008
China's economy in the future...

01:47:51.237 --> 01:47:55.652
For thousands of years, China has the longest continuous civilization in the world.

01:47:58.143 --> 01:48:04.848
And it is only during the recent period of time, when the European countries started to industrialize, that China started to lag behind.

01:48:05.269 --> 01:48:27.826
And therefore, you know, between the first Opium War in around 1840, all the way to about 1978, China went through a roller coaster of great accumulations, wars of aggression by foreign nations, Japanese aggression against China, civil war, collapse of the Qing dynasty, great cultural revolution, chaos in China, that when Deng Xiaoping reemerged in 1978, he basically pointed out the only correct path

01:48:32.697 --> 01:48:37.140
We need to go onto a path of growth, and China needs to modernize and industrialize.

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:41.703
And I think that's the beginning of China's correct development onto a right path.

01:48:56.434 --> 01:49:06.419
Some people have written about natural capital, the capital that nature provides, which is the clean air, the clean water, the uncut forests, the rich farmland, and the minerals, the oil, the metals.

01:49:06.459 --> 01:49:08.460
All of these things are the capital that nature has provided.

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:23.928
And until about 1980, human civilization was able to live on what we might term the interest of that capital, the surplus that nature is able to produce, the food that farmland can grow without actually degrading the farmland, or the number of fish you can pull out of the sea without causing the fish stocks to crash.

01:49:23.988 --> 01:49:24.788
But since 1980, we've been using

01:49:26.129 --> 01:49:27.369
more than the interest.

01:49:27.429 --> 01:49:34.451
And so we are, in effect, like somebody who thinks he's rich because he's spending the money that he's been left in his inheritance, not spending the interest, but eating into the capital.

01:49:34.951 --> 01:49:39.652
The last time I visited the New York Stock Exchange was in 1980, and the mood sure was different then.

01:49:40.673 --> 01:49:46.094
Government, with its high taxes, excessive spending, and overregulation, had thrown a wrench in the works of our free markets.

01:49:49.758 --> 01:49:56.222
With tax reform and budget control, our economy will be free to expand to its full potential, driving the bears back into permanent hibernation.

01:49:56.402 --> 01:49:58.204
That's our economic program for the next four years.

01:49:58.404 --> 01:49:59.624
We're going to turn the bullet loose.

01:50:08.971 --> 01:50:09.551
The world is this big.

01:50:18.308 --> 01:50:20.229
It's not this big, and it can't be this big.

01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:21.270
It's just this big.

01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:22.611
It's a finite sum.

01:50:25.393 --> 01:50:39.744
Instead of thinking that nature is this huge bank that we can just, this endless credit card that we can just keep drawing on, we have to think about the finite nature of that planet and how to keep it alive so that we too may remain alive.

01:50:40.705 --> 01:50:46.709
Unless we conserve the planet, there isn't going to be any, the economy.

01:50:52.008 --> 01:50:54.609
The Ice Age hunter is still us, it's still in us.

01:50:54.629 --> 01:51:03.834
Those ancient hunters who thought that there would always be another herd of mammoth over the next hill shared the optimism of the stock trader that there's always going to be another big killing on the stock market in the next week or two.

01:51:17.717 --> 01:51:37.106
Okay, so between the constant reference to being a hunter-gatherer, which is sketch, and now we're going to blame it on the stock markets and inflation or the banks or something like that as a way of driving this narrative that we're just lemmings.

01:51:41.969 --> 01:51:48.415
It's unfortunate because we are, in a way, like the herd of buffalo being driven like this.

01:51:48.776 --> 01:51:57.124
And so the question becomes, who has gotten so good at governing humans that they can get humans to run off a cliff?

01:51:58.683 --> 01:52:01.144
That's the question that these people aren't asking.

01:52:01.224 --> 01:52:06.147
They're assuming that it's just, you know, an out-of-control biological phenomenon.

01:52:06.187 --> 01:52:07.487
This is what culture does.

01:52:08.068 --> 01:52:09.748
This is what consumption does.

01:52:09.928 --> 01:52:20.033
No, what they should be asking is, who's gotten so good at governing humans that they can make them run off a cliff and not even know that people are running off a cliff ahead of them?

01:52:35.205 --> 01:52:45.530
If you're watching the Earth, say, over the last 5,000 or 6,000 years, and you're speeding up your film, what you see is civilizations breaking out like forest fires in one pristine environment after another.

01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:54.074
And after a civilization has arisen and sort of burned out the natural resources in that area, then it dies down and another fire breaks out somewhere else.

01:52:59.707 --> 01:53:06.970
And now, of course, we have one huge civilization around the world, which we have to confront the possibility that the entire experiment of civilization is in itself a progress trap.

01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.830
And of course, what is this?

01:53:08.850 --> 01:53:09.851
The whole reason is because we ask why.

01:53:09.891 --> 01:53:13.512
We got all the way to nukes because we just, it's in our nature to ask why.

01:53:27.602 --> 01:53:30.463
I guess now we have to stop asking why or something like that.

01:53:30.523 --> 01:53:31.564
Ask a different question.

01:53:31.664 --> 01:53:35.766
I'm not sure, but I have a feeling this is malevolent.

01:53:35.786 --> 01:53:37.947
The effects are working their way down to all of us.

01:53:37.967 --> 01:53:38.868
Will the economy turn around?

01:53:38.888 --> 01:53:40.809
I'm not an economist, but I do believe that we're growing.

01:53:52.074 --> 01:53:57.520
And I can remember this press conference here, people yelling recession, recession, as if you're economists.

01:53:58.481 --> 01:53:59.883
And I'm an optimist.

01:54:00.912 --> 01:54:02.594
I believe there's a lot of positive things for our economy.

01:54:02.814 --> 01:54:09.080
Faith in progress has become a kind of religious faith, a sort of fundamentalism, rather like the market fundamentalism that has just recently crashed and burned.

01:54:09.781 --> 01:54:18.449
The idea that you can let markets rip is a delusion just as the idea that you can let technology rip and it will solve the problems created by itself in a slightly earlier phase.

01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:23.815
That has become a belief very similar to the religious delusions that caused some societies to crash and burn in the past.

01:54:26.474 --> 01:54:31.558
Written records go back about 4,000 years, and from 2000 BC to the time of Jesus.

01:54:31.658 --> 01:54:36.701
It was normal for all of the countries in the world to periodically cancel the debts when they became too large to pay.

01:54:38.323 --> 01:54:47.169
So you have Sumer, Babylonia, Egypt, other regions, all proclaiming these debt cancellations, and the effect was to make a clean slate so that society would begin all over again.

01:54:49.059 --> 01:54:51.901
This was easy to do in a society where most debts were owed to the state.

01:54:52.181 --> 01:54:57.964
It became much harder to do when enterprise and credit passed out of the hands of the state into private hands and into the hands of an oligarchy.

01:55:00.085 --> 01:55:04.948
And the last thing they wanted was to have a king that would actually cancel the debts and restore equality.

01:55:07.929 --> 01:55:10.411
Rome was the first country of the world not to cancel the debts.

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:16.514
It went to war in Sparta, in Greece, to overthrow the governments and the kings that wanted to cancel the debts.

01:55:19.878 --> 01:55:23.760
The wars of the first century BC ended up stripping these countries of everything they had.

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:32.364
Not only did it strip the temples of gold, it stripped the public buildings, it stripped the economies of their reproductive capacity, it stripped them of their water works, it made a desert out of the land.

01:55:33.085 --> 01:55:34.205
And it said, a debt is a debt.

01:55:36.826 --> 01:55:43.630
The collapse seems to have been closely linked to ecological devastation, which led to all sorts of social and economic and military problems.

01:55:43.810 --> 01:55:47.652
In the early stages of the Roman... It's almost like they're telling us that we still live in Rome.

01:55:48.703 --> 01:56:05.830
And if that's the case, then we have a duty to our children to make sure that they don't wake up enslaved by Rome as well, in a different form and a different mythology set in a different set of costumes or a different set of, of professional sports teams.

01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:12.892
We need to be aware that right now there is an opportunity that hasn't been here in a very long time.

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:14.593
Maybe ever.

01:56:17.492 --> 01:56:19.895
It's an extraordinary place we are in our history.

01:56:19.915 --> 01:56:21.837
You had a fairly egalitarian landowning system.

01:56:34.833 --> 01:56:39.296
began to appropriate public land for their own private estates, more and more peasants became landless.

01:56:39.576 --> 01:56:41.377
At the same time, erosion was a serious problem.

01:56:41.398 --> 01:56:45.981
So bad that some of the Roman ports silted up with all the topsoil that got washed down from the fields into the river.

01:56:46.281 --> 01:56:55.027
Archaeologists have been able to establish how badly degraded much of Italy was by the fall of the Roman Empire and how it took a thousand years of much reduced population during the Middle Ages for fertility in Italy to rebuild.

01:56:57.213 --> 01:57:04.458
What was absolutely new in the Roman Empire was irreversible concentration of wealth at the top of the economic pyramid, and that's what progress has meant ever since.

01:57:04.699 --> 01:57:07.301
Progress has meant you will never get back what we take from you.

01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:22.272
That's what brought on the Dark Age, and it's what's threatened to bring in the Dark Age again if society doesn't realize that if it lets the wealth concentrate in the hand of a financial class, this class is not going to be any more intelligent and long-term in disposing of the wealth than its predecessors were in Rome or in other countries.

01:57:32.037 --> 01:57:34.538
Well, the term oligarchy obviously sounds a little esoteric.

01:57:34.678 --> 01:57:37.940
It just means a small group of people who've got a lot of political power based on their economic power.

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.963
We like to think of the United States as being much more democratic, much more spread out in terms of who has the power.

01:57:43.343 --> 01:57:51.088
And oligarchy is something that's usually associated with relatively poor countries, but that view has to be updated because we've got an essential part of that problem, that structure, in the United States today.

01:57:52.452 --> 01:57:54.192
People who got all this economic power were in the financial sector.

01:57:54.212 --> 01:57:56.493
It was Wall Street, if I can use that shorthand expression.

01:57:56.673 --> 01:57:57.633
Wall Street became really powerful.

01:57:58.173 --> 01:58:06.435
They used that power to buy influence in Washington, get more deregulation, so to get more of the playing field shaped in the way they wanted, which was no government intervention, no restrictions on what they were going to do.

01:58:06.635 --> 01:58:09.416
That enabled them to make a lot more money, which brought them more political power.

01:58:09.536 --> 01:58:12.196
And this went on for a considerable period of time until, of course, there was an enormous crash.

01:58:14.477 --> 01:58:20.018
But basically, you come to us today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa.

01:58:21.024 --> 01:58:24.048
Telling us we're sorry, we didn't mean it, we won't do it again.

01:58:24.488 --> 01:58:24.889
Trust us.

01:58:25.810 --> 01:58:29.134
Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks.

01:58:29.935 --> 01:58:30.736
And they say the same thing.

01:58:31.436 --> 01:58:33.359
They're sorry, they didn't mean it, they won't do it again.

01:58:33.559 --> 01:58:34.060
Just let them out.

01:58:35.201 --> 01:58:38.164
Do you understand that this is a little difficult for most of my constituents to take?

01:58:38.985 --> 01:58:39.886
That you learned your lesson?

01:58:41.254 --> 01:58:42.115
the bankers can't stop themselves.

01:58:42.655 --> 01:58:48.862
It's in their DNA, in the DNA of their organizations, to take massive risks, to pay themselves ridiculous salaries, and- It's in their DNA!

01:58:49.062 --> 01:58:49.422
To collapse.

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:59.092
And the more that reasonable, responsible people of the center, and the left and the right, see this, the closer we'll get to finally constraining the power of these out-of-control financial oligarchs.

01:58:59.557 --> 01:59:00.898
It's not a mystery, it's not a surprise.

01:59:00.918 --> 01:59:02.239
We know we have crises every five or 10 years.

01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:04.301
My daughter called me from school one day.

01:59:04.441 --> 01:59:15.731
And so now we are disguising what is a national security priority to invert the American population to experimental animal status in the next 20 years.

01:59:16.411 --> 01:59:22.516
That national security priority is being disguised as just pure greed.

01:59:23.877 --> 01:59:27.459
And wherever they invest is just pure greed, you know?

01:59:27.899 --> 01:59:31.221
The only reason why Fitbits and stuff are being developed is greed.

01:59:31.641 --> 01:59:35.263
The only reason why all this, you know, data collection is greed.

01:59:38.724 --> 01:59:40.645
It's much bigger than that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:40.705 --> 01:59:41.866
It's about all the marbles.

01:59:42.946 --> 01:59:44.127
It's about your grandchildren.

01:59:45.987 --> 01:59:48.769
It really is about all the marbles.

01:59:51.195 --> 01:59:55.657
I can't stress enough how it's about all the marbles, and that means I need to go to the gym with my kids.

01:59:56.858 --> 02:00:02.021
Ladies and gentlemen, it was non-specific PCR tests on a background that's irreducibly complex.

02:00:02.821 --> 02:00:06.123
RNA cannot pandemic, and that's why they don't want to talk about it anymore.

02:00:07.303 --> 02:00:13.827
Ladies and gentlemen, if you use their test to find their ghosts, it didn't make you a Ghostbuster, nor did it make their ghosts real.

02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:16.165
There was no pandemic.

02:00:16.225 --> 02:00:18.327
There is, there can be no pandemic.

02:00:18.467 --> 02:00:21.869
And that is one of the most important lessons to teach our kids.

02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:23.510
Rick.

02:00:25.192 --> 02:00:26.693
Rick from Eau Claire.

02:00:27.373 --> 02:00:28.254
Holy crap.

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:29.615
From Eau Claire.

02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:32.724
You know I grew up in Kadat, right?

02:00:32.924 --> 02:00:36.146
I mean, I played for the Kadat basketball team.

02:00:36.166 --> 02:00:44.489
We never actually played like North or we never played any of the Eau Claire high schools because you guys were out of our size.

02:00:44.529 --> 02:00:47.791
But a Rick from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

02:00:47.811 --> 02:00:48.611
That's crazy.

02:00:48.811 --> 02:00:49.071
Wow.

02:00:49.532 --> 02:00:50.912
Awesome.

02:00:51.333 --> 02:00:52.713
A fellow Wisconsin kid.

02:00:52.753 --> 02:00:53.534
Thank you very much.

02:00:54.194 --> 02:00:55.655
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

02:00:55.755 --> 02:00:56.755
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:00:56.775 --> 02:00:58.496
Transfecting healthy humans is a crime.

02:00:59.036 --> 02:01:02.160
And the population pyramid is definitely being managed right now.

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.043
Ladies and gentlemen, I will be here tomorrow.

02:01:04.603 --> 02:01:06.666
Maybe with a little more organized stream, maybe not.

02:01:06.746 --> 02:01:08.528
I don't know, but I will definitely be here tomorrow.

02:01:08.548 --> 02:01:09.650
Thanks for being here yourself.

02:01:10.651 --> 02:01:11.212
I'll see you then.

02:01:30.046 --> 02:01:38.372
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:01:44.793 --> 02:01:57.120
If you want to send anything to the house or to the family, you can do like Rick from Eau Claire did and send it to PO Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102.

02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:00.382
We need every little bit of help we can get here.

02:02:01.642 --> 02:02:05.404
We are working hard though and this will never stop one way or another.

02:02:05.424 --> 02:02:11.768
gigaomebiological.com, stream.gigaome.bio and yeah, thanks for being here.
