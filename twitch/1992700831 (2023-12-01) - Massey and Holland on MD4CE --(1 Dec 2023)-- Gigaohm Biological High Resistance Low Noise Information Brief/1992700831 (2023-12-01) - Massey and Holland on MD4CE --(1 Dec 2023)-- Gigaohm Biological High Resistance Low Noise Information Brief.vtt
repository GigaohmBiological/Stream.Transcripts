01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
I think I'm going to give my voice just a little bit of a break tonight.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I've got a long video to watch. I know how long it's going to take us to watch it.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
But this is Gigaohm Biological.

01:54.000 --> 02:18.320
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.520
This is Gigaohm Biological. A High Resistance, Low Noise Information Brief, brought to you

02:22.520 --> 02:28.120
by a biologist, I've been in the gym yelling for about a half an hour and I feel like

02:28.120 --> 02:34.280
I may have done some minor damage to the instrument so I'm just gonna try and keep my voice down

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
as much as possible.

02:35.280 --> 02:42.940
It is December 1st, 2023, we are one month away from 2024 when really there can be no

02:42.940 --> 02:49.520
doubt that we have been at this way too long for something very, very wrong not to be happening

02:49.520 --> 02:50.520
at this stage.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.760
There's no other conclusion to come to ladies and gentlemen, I mean if this was just an

02:54.760 --> 03:02.240
accident, if this was just a snafu, this would have ended years ago.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.640
That's the harsh reality of where we are at and Giga Ohm Biological doesn't want to

03:08.640 --> 03:12.840
pull any punches about that, just in case you are joining me for the first time, I used

03:12.840 --> 03:17.640
to be a patch clamp physiologist where I made electrical recordings from neurons and brain

03:17.640 --> 03:24.640
slices and in those recordings, the recordings are made with electrodes which make seals,

03:24.640 --> 03:29.720
electrical seals which are of the Giga Ohm resistance range and so we called the stream

03:29.720 --> 03:36.560
Giga Ohm Biological at High Resistance, Low Noise Information Brief after this methodology.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.680
We are trying to solve a mystery that we've actually been tricked into solving by the

03:41.680 --> 03:47.400
government or by whoever is running this show and I say the government, I mean the

03:47.400 --> 03:53.480
government as in world governments or the who or Gavi or Bill Gates or whatever you

03:53.480 --> 04:00.040
want to call this amorphous, you know, bad guy set that we're supposed to unmask but

04:00.040 --> 04:06.920
in reality, we have been tricked into unmasking the people who are responsible for the virus

04:06.920 --> 04:08.720
and that's the Scooby-Doo.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.720
We're not trying to figure out who's rigged our currency, we're not trying to figure

04:11.720 --> 04:16.680
out who's been ripping us off for the last generation, we're not trying to figure out

04:16.680 --> 04:22.640
where all the money went, we're not trying to figure out anything of value, we're trying

04:22.640 --> 04:27.960
to figure out where the virus came from and who's responsible for it and our entire society

04:27.960 --> 04:36.440
seems bent on it and that is the problem because we don't really have ourselves focused where

04:36.440 --> 04:41.880
we need to be and of course the way that they've done this is with this consensus about what

04:41.880 --> 04:44.640
the worst case scenario is.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.800
Probably my favorite example of how this worst case scenario conversation went was a Twitter

04:49.800 --> 04:57.080
spaces that was hosted by Kim.com where I think it was Andrew Huff actually who was

04:57.080 --> 05:06.040
having an exchange with Kim.com and Kim.com suddenly came to the realization that with

05:06.040 --> 05:10.760
a bioweapon you could kill many more people than you could with a nuclear bomb and it

05:10.760 --> 05:15.040
was much, much, much better than a nuclear bomb or something like that, you know, much

05:15.040 --> 05:19.000
more dangerous, whatever and that's what this is really all about.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.960
That's what took almost three years to really settle into people on our side and understand

05:27.960 --> 05:36.120
what really was at stake, what really kind of had been lined up to go and then whether

05:36.120 --> 05:41.040
or not they would leave it up to Mother Nature to trigger that plan or whether they

05:41.040 --> 05:48.800
would kind of, you know, give her a nudge and in this case I think they would just outright

05:48.800 --> 05:53.800
lie about it as well and that's what we really have to consider because again we're playing

05:53.800 --> 05:55.160
for all the marbles here.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.560
We're talking about a complete rearrangement of the economic system, we're talking about

05:59.560 --> 06:09.200
a complete rearrangement of the international order, we're talking about probably a drastic

06:09.200 --> 06:17.000
reorganization of the American system, certainly of the financial system in America and so

06:17.000 --> 06:26.440
this coming fiasco is something that I think probably and I'm not, this is not my idea

06:26.440 --> 06:32.760
but I think probably needed some cover, probably needed some story, probably needed

06:32.760 --> 06:38.040
something to get all the machinery and motion and moving in the direction that they wanted

06:38.040 --> 06:43.600
it to move in under their control and I do think that it's possible that a pandemic

06:43.600 --> 06:49.280
narrative as nice it is is to believe that it's just a bunch of virologists who are

06:49.280 --> 06:53.280
lying and trying to make money, I think it's much more complicated than that, this is a

06:53.280 --> 07:03.080
multi-generational plan and among the steps in this plan are a fundamental inversion

07:03.080 --> 07:10.080
of our rights on the basis of this mythology and so we are really trying to understand

07:10.080 --> 07:15.960
who is genuinely fighting against this idea, against this concept that we have to be afraid

07:15.960 --> 07:19.800
of Mother Nature, that Mother Nature has this pandemic potential in store for us that we've

07:19.800 --> 07:27.720
just experienced it but it might be a fraction of what she's capable of and we've got a really

07:27.720 --> 07:35.280
break this faith because that's all it is, it's a faith in this idea and as nice of a

07:35.280 --> 07:42.440
picture as it is, as beautiful as they can tell the story, it's still basically the push

07:42.440 --> 07:47.720
pull of the train story as long as these people continue to agree and not step on each other's

07:47.760 --> 07:55.760
toes and not write contradicting books, then pretty much everything's gonna be okay and in

07:55.760 --> 08:01.120
this scenario we will continue to have defeated disease and epidemics using vaccination including

08:01.120 --> 08:07.160
this time and novel coronaviruses will continue to be a threat to jump from other species and

08:07.160 --> 08:14.040
definitely can pandemic because they just did, PCR false positives will continue to remain rare

08:14.120 --> 08:21.080
and asymptomatic spread will continue to be real and the variants will continue to be a story that

08:21.080 --> 08:27.880
they tell us to motivate us to do the next big thing like take a booster or get a test and so we

08:27.880 --> 08:33.480
also believe the gain of function virus is real and we talk about it all the time they are definitely

08:33.480 --> 08:40.360
we're hiding it right and this must be dispelled this faith in this story it must be dispelled this

08:40.360 --> 08:49.160
Christmas is the time I can feel it and if we don't start dispelling this essentially we

08:49.160 --> 08:55.960
don't escape because this is the trap everything else hinges on our, on our complying with the

08:55.960 --> 09:02.360
World Health Organization and our complying with our own governments as they, as they pretend to

09:02.360 --> 09:11.080
conform to the new rules and edicts pretend to have no choice to pretend that there's no others

09:11.080 --> 09:16.920
there's no other choice here I mean with climate change and everything else we need to be awake

09:16.920 --> 09:23.720
to the fact that this is the plan we are on that cosmic train everything outside of the train is

09:23.720 --> 09:31.000
out of our control they're just showing us movies and they don't care because they know what's coming

09:31.080 --> 09:35.880
they know that there's a fundamental reorganization of the world order coming very soon

09:37.240 --> 09:42.840
where world superpowers are going to change where maybe even the meaning of national borders

09:43.640 --> 09:48.520
will change fundamentally and certainly the way that the world deals with each other

09:49.400 --> 09:53.080
on an economic basis has to fundamentally change at some point this

09:53.880 --> 10:03.000
is the math of the dollar doesn't work anymore and I'm not an economist but this is beyond

10:03.000 --> 10:08.520
needing to be an economist to know that this is a train going nowhere it's only a question of when

10:08.520 --> 10:15.800
does the do the people who are running this show decide that that show is over and so we need to

10:15.800 --> 10:20.120
have control of our system before they decide to do that that's the point we need to have

10:21.000 --> 10:26.680
control of our freedom before they decide to pull the plug because once the

10:30.120 --> 10:33.480
I don't even know really how to say it because I'm so worried about it sometimes

10:34.120 --> 10:38.120
and I'm coming home from basketball practice and the only thing I can think of is wow we're really

10:38.840 --> 10:41.560
we're really not pushing the ball very far I mean the best

10:42.920 --> 10:49.000
the best thing that's happened to us on this side of the equation really and has been in the last

10:49.080 --> 10:51.800
few months maybe even the last couple weeks

10:53.640 --> 10:57.480
with a number of people in the center of this picture starting to come together

10:57.480 --> 11:03.240
and start to understand what the primary message is what the what the way home is

11:07.720 --> 11:11.720
and before that we were still pretty much just wandering around the cave in different

11:11.720 --> 11:14.600
directions you know thinking we were all doing something

11:15.160 --> 11:22.920
and until it became very obvious that there was something else going on that there was some

11:22.920 --> 11:27.880
faith happening and then when it became very easy to understand the faith based on math

11:28.520 --> 11:39.640
from people like Denny Rancor or from Martin Neil and and Jonathan Engler who did that stuff in

11:39.640 --> 11:45.960
Italy and Jessica Hockett now in New York making these really poignant observations

11:45.960 --> 11:49.320
about what's there and what's not there what the data supports and doesn't support

11:51.480 --> 11:55.720
and so you can talk about bio-weapons all you want but there was no spread so it's not that kind

11:55.720 --> 12:01.400
of bio-weapon and so then we're back to clones and we're back to purposeful release and we're

12:01.400 --> 12:08.040
back to making large quantities of it or making small quantities of it and the rest is noise

12:09.720 --> 12:17.000
but we're not talking about a worst-case scenario of a spreading pathogen of a bio-weapon that you

12:17.000 --> 12:24.120
can stitch together and make a small quantity of in a little bottle and if it gets on the wrong

12:24.120 --> 12:35.080
person it's over one particle as they say with prions and it's over all of this hyper terrifying

12:35.160 --> 12:40.600
biology is antithetical to the fact that there's been life on earth for a very long time

12:44.280 --> 12:48.440
and it's very unfortunate that what we're really dealing with here is people trying to cover up

12:48.440 --> 12:55.960
for the biological facts that transfection was going to produce all kinds of unknown side effects

12:55.960 --> 13:00.440
unknown consequences unknown short-term and long-term consequences

13:01.320 --> 13:09.720
and so what better way to take care of that what better way to take care of that than to spend

13:09.720 --> 13:15.320
almost three years telling everybody that the spike protein is some kind of special toxin

13:15.320 --> 13:21.560
with all kinds of wizard sequences in it 20 amino acids of this and 20 amino acids of that and 20

13:21.560 --> 13:29.720
amino acids of this and 20 amino acids of that so that oh my gosh the Swiss army knife of toxins

13:29.800 --> 13:34.280
the spike protein is responsible for all of the myocarditis in the world

13:36.360 --> 13:42.200
all of the Alzheimer's disease and my amyloidosis and everything that's never been detected before

13:42.200 --> 13:47.400
is now all responsible for this magic protein never mind the fact that we're transfecting

13:47.400 --> 13:53.000
everybody to that protein or purport to be focus on the virus

13:53.480 --> 14:00.600
do you know how many people on this on this page right here we're doing that for almost three years

14:02.040 --> 14:07.560
chasing around spike protein toxicity talking about amyloid and prion way too early

14:11.480 --> 14:15.560
and they have been consistent about it from the very beginning but for some reason after four

14:15.560 --> 14:21.480
years of the virus spread and after five billion spike protein shots i don't see anybody dropping

14:21.480 --> 14:27.560
dead from prion disease yet oh you just wait kui you just wait it's all going to happen it's

14:27.560 --> 14:37.960
coming really soon kui i don't know i think it's much more likely that there's a lot of people that

14:37.960 --> 14:45.160
are lying and a lot more people have been misled and if you've been misled by the fundamental

14:46.040 --> 14:53.480
principle that a small puddle of RNA can perpetuate itself and and high fidelity copy itself for four

14:53.480 --> 14:56.360
and a half years well then i guess you're you've got a big problem

15:01.160 --> 15:05.480
so today we're going to listen to david martin speak um and he's going to be interviewed by

15:06.040 --> 15:13.160
alicek alicek is uh kind of the one of the the team captains of of the

15:14.280 --> 15:22.040
um the virus hasn't been isolated or purified group i don't want to say no virus because i think

15:22.040 --> 15:27.320
they're a little bit more specific than that actually they don't believe that the virus has

15:27.400 --> 15:36.520
either been isolated nor purified and therefore there is no virus and until it is isolated and

15:36.520 --> 15:45.000
purified there is no virus and it is a stance that one can take um but i think if one takes that

15:45.000 --> 15:52.440
stance and then leaves it there which is what they do if one takes the stance that foyer requests

15:52.520 --> 15:58.920
sent to police departments are evidence that there is no virus and you leave it there

16:01.800 --> 16:07.160
and then you use that as a basis to attack everybody on this side of the ball

16:08.120 --> 16:16.760
irrespective of your intentions it just doesn't seem logistically or strategically sound rather

16:17.560 --> 16:25.080
because you try not to make friends you try not to listen to anyone and you pigeonhole the

16:25.080 --> 16:34.600
debate into this one thing where you know either let's just say it like this and i i hope that this

16:34.600 --> 16:41.000
is going to be a very good example of why this argument is so dumb and it is dumb and i shouldn't

16:41.000 --> 16:47.560
use the word dumb i really should use the word it's dubious because it dumb implies that they

16:47.560 --> 16:52.760
don't know better dumb implies that they can't they don't understand what they're doing but it's

16:52.760 --> 17:00.040
hard very very hard for me to believe that they don't understand what they're doing and the reason

17:00.040 --> 17:06.440
why um i believe that is because i've experienced a lot of their interpersonal communication and

17:06.840 --> 17:13.640
and their direct communication by email i've experienced the the language that they use and

17:13.640 --> 17:23.320
the language is not diplomatic it's not friendly it's not cordial it's aggressive it's insulting

17:24.120 --> 17:35.400
and their their tactics are just they don't suggest that ultimately they want to win

17:36.120 --> 17:43.480
in terms of like people being free and the new world order ending it feels a lot more like they

17:43.480 --> 17:51.480
just want to dunk on people like chd and bobby which is fine i mean that's great but the amount of focus

17:52.760 --> 17:57.720
that they put on people on our side um and then the amount of

17:58.040 --> 18:07.160
of nuance that they lack so i want to play a video first um that i think will kind of speak to what

18:07.160 --> 18:15.880
i'm trying to express here better than i'm expressing it um this video is from doctors for

18:16.200 --> 18:19.000
ethics with mary holland and i'm actually not sure

18:23.800 --> 18:29.800
if this video really should be up because it's from the question and answer session

18:30.760 --> 18:35.240
which i think generally speaking isn't recorded and but it it's up here

18:36.200 --> 18:40.840
um and it was posted by uh welcome the eagle i think that's welcome the eagle 88

18:41.800 --> 18:50.120
um and so you know people are allowed to record i guess um and so mary had spoke at medical

18:50.120 --> 18:59.560
doctors for covid ethics and um and then these two people uh william herst huston and christine

18:59.560 --> 19:06.120
massy will ask her questions and i just want to prepare you it's not necessarily very comfortable

19:07.080 --> 19:15.400
um and it's pretty aggressive toward um chd as an organization and because mary's there then

19:15.400 --> 19:20.920
mary is taking the brunt of this so it's uh i'm gonna stop it in the middle of course and and

19:20.920 --> 19:28.520
give my objective opinion if i can um and i think maybe i'll just leave it here you know you know uh

19:29.720 --> 19:35.640
uh charles i believe check check check hello yes that works yep very good hi mary

19:37.000 --> 19:43.640
i don't know um so i i i'm not sure where to start i'm not trying to uh get through this i have

19:43.640 --> 19:49.400
some notes here um i don't know if you know this but i i used to kind of work i was a paralegal and

19:49.400 --> 19:55.160
i kind of worked within uh the network and i won't say the attorney that i worked for but it was

19:55.160 --> 20:04.280
somebody that i really uh value and appreciate i think she's a fabulous attorney um but so just

20:04.280 --> 20:09.400
to start off um i just have a couple of questions here maybe i can get to the list and just turn

20:09.400 --> 20:17.240
it over to you for your feedback so number one why does children's health defense promote

20:17.240 --> 20:25.000
the core fraud of covid in the courts and in the pages of the defender and on chd tv

20:25.960 --> 20:30.920
which is the very basis for all the countermeasures which you claim to be fighting

20:31.880 --> 20:39.080
and i don't i do mean the virus issue but it's much more than just the virus because

20:40.360 --> 20:49.480
there's really a two dozen ways the official narrative which you promote uh at chd is clearly

20:49.480 --> 20:58.840
false uh like let's begin with step zero um to begin saying that you have a new disease you first

20:58.920 --> 21:07.000
have to identify a new unique and defining syndrome there's no such thing for covid there's no test

21:07.000 --> 21:16.120
there's no isolated pathogen there's no proof that the phantom cgi pathogen causes the

21:16.120 --> 21:24.200
non distinguishing syndrome the whole thing is a joke but and i found it funny when you uh interviewed

21:24.200 --> 21:32.600
dave rasnick and mike wallock will will will ask will i don't do it in these speeches this is

21:32.600 --> 21:37.880
you've got to see here's a question i stress i said one question why does chd promote the

21:37.880 --> 21:45.800
core fraud in the courts and everywhere why do chd attorneys accept the boundaries of the crime

21:45.880 --> 21:55.480
scene a priori as defined by the perpetrator why does why does chd censor the no virus position

21:55.480 --> 22:03.240
from your website for example the uh the the the paramount example is if you search for the name

22:03.240 --> 22:10.360
christine massy what you did is no record found and why is that ironic because that is the answer

22:10.440 --> 22:18.280
that christine got to from 212 institutions and 40 nations when asks were proof that sars

22:18.280 --> 22:27.320
cov 2 exists no record found why is chd censoring this extremely important work uh by christine

22:27.320 --> 22:33.880
massy and worse why does children's health defense apparently hire a team of consultants

22:34.600 --> 22:41.800
like jakie and uh james lion's wiler and uh uh jeremy hammond and a bunch of others

22:42.920 --> 22:49.160
maryll nass to attack and malign the people that are calling out the core fraud

22:50.360 --> 22:55.320
okay all right all right all right will let's assume the questions we've got the intent of

22:55.320 --> 23:01.560
the question so mary's got an opportunity to mail answer sure and i said christine massy

23:01.560 --> 23:08.440
your questions yeah so um just to clarify what he the the things that he said he's saying that the

23:09.560 --> 23:13.800
my notes aren't very good but he i won't show you them but he says that um they're promoting

23:13.800 --> 23:19.800
the core fraud at at chd and it's much more than the virus that they're promoting of course there's

23:19.800 --> 23:25.400
at least two dozen ways that the main story is a fraud and then he goes on to list like one

23:26.120 --> 23:32.040
which is that the new disease needs a new syndrome so i'm not necessarily saying that that's an

23:32.680 --> 23:38.360
uh not a valid objection to the pandemic as a whole um but i think that

23:39.800 --> 23:45.320
the pretty easy answer would be that the cdc and all these other people would say that

23:45.320 --> 23:49.880
the virus doesn't always cause blah you know they have a mealy mouth way of doing it and so

23:50.840 --> 23:57.240
this argument all by itself the way that they portray it as a dunk right you know

23:58.040 --> 24:01.880
obviously a new disease has to have a new syndrome and they didn't even have a new

24:01.880 --> 24:09.880
syndrome and it was like cgi and phantom cgi you know they don't make a very skilled argument

24:09.880 --> 24:15.960
i mean why not just list the two dozen ways that the narrative doesn't work and just be

24:16.040 --> 24:21.000
succinct about it and start with a new disease needs a new syndrome and they never really

24:21.000 --> 24:25.880
outlined that there's no difference between this and the flu and other syndromes next point

24:27.800 --> 24:35.080
but see they can never do that because i don't really feel this guy's necessarily on the paid

24:35.080 --> 24:41.880
squad or anything like that but he has the same sort of overzealous commitment to

24:42.840 --> 24:47.800
these people are the bad guys and so because of that he gets very flustered and he's not

24:47.800 --> 24:55.720
able to articulate and so instead of listing succinctly two dozen ways that chd is blowing it

24:55.720 --> 25:00.200
he starts by saying something that maybe is the least impressive of all the things

25:01.160 --> 25:08.360
um and then what he calls it fandom cgi then he goes right to foyas

25:09.240 --> 25:16.280
and the foyas are apparently to 212 institutions and 40 nations a lot of those institutions are

25:16.280 --> 25:23.400
police like police stations or you know local counties or this kind of thing which you can't

25:23.400 --> 25:30.760
really have expected Pittsburgh Township to have an isolated a virus and so when you send a foyer

25:30.760 --> 25:37.480
to the city of Pittsburgh and they don't have any evidence of of a pure purified sample of

25:37.560 --> 25:42.360
SARS-CoV-2 it's not really that surprising so a lot of this is also kind of like silly

25:43.320 --> 25:48.600
which is also frustrating but more importantly okay so how many of these foyas did you need to

25:48.600 --> 25:54.920
send out before now you could move on to the next the next point the next way to fight the narrative

25:55.480 --> 26:01.480
instead they they get those foyas and then the first thing they do is turn around and attack

26:01.480 --> 26:08.680
Mary and CHD and Bobby the only organization in America that's been fighting against the

26:08.680 --> 26:13.320
vaccine schedule since before the pandemic which you'd think they would also be aware of

26:14.440 --> 26:20.520
and so if an organization fighting that important fight before the pandemic is now getting the

26:20.520 --> 26:29.400
pandemic wrong there are a lot closer to getting it right than deserving of this kind of vitriol

26:30.040 --> 26:34.840
you think you would continue to approach them with a little bit of respect

26:36.280 --> 26:41.160
and say but you know maybe you can have a son for a weekly show then because we really think

26:41.160 --> 26:47.640
that we're not getting enough you know airtime and why not be positive and constructive and come

26:47.640 --> 26:53.080
with solutions instead of immediately going to attacking the organization trying to discredit

26:53.160 --> 27:00.760
the organization and trying to make CHD part of the NIH CDC control mechanism

27:02.600 --> 27:07.400
even if there are people working at CHD that are part of it which I guess there probably are

27:08.920 --> 27:14.760
and if there aren't then CHD has been darn good at keeping them out because I'm sure they've tried

27:16.280 --> 27:22.760
so it's confusing to me why this tactic is always the same it's no not friendly at all

27:23.320 --> 27:32.520
I would I would never presume to act like this and they're going to say yeah you were that way

27:32.520 --> 27:37.800
but I was that way because of the way they behave in private the emails that they send and the way

27:37.800 --> 27:44.280
that they do it and so let's you're not going to it's not going to be any more fun the rest of

27:44.280 --> 27:50.520
this video but but I think it's important to listen to it because I mean Mary is a samurai here

27:51.400 --> 27:58.920
so yeah so I don't believe that we're promoting a core fraud I don't believe that we are censoring

27:58.920 --> 28:04.920
the no virus point of view I don't believe that we are hiring people to attack people without

28:04.920 --> 28:10.680
viewpoint I think it's a very important viewpoint I've had Andy Kaufmann I've had Tom Cowan

28:10.680 --> 28:17.320
Dave Raznick Michael Wallach on CHD platforms to discuss this I've had long correspondence with

28:17.320 --> 28:24.840
Ms. Massey and with others on this topic we are still hopeful to do a debate a bit further down the

28:24.840 --> 28:30.360
line Tom Cowan is very insistent that he wants to involve Bobby Kennedy in this himself Bobby

28:30.360 --> 28:35.720
is not able to do that in the foreseeable next couple months but we're we think it's a very

28:35.720 --> 28:47.080
interesting hypothesis it's often brought with such sort of kind of emotion that it's it seems

28:47.080 --> 28:54.280
difficult to respond to in a kind of deliberative way but I definitely think there are very serious

28:54.280 --> 29:00.280
methodological problems with the way that COVID has been established I think it's a very serious

29:00.280 --> 29:05.640
point of view that there is no such thing as COVID I absolutely we just had a Nick Panda Nick

29:06.520 --> 29:12.760
Hudson on to talk about that last week I think it's a very defensible position but it's often

29:12.760 --> 29:19.640
expressed with such venom that it makes it very hard to really sort of have a civil dialogue

29:19.640 --> 29:25.800
about it I would really and Bobby Kennedy are very interested in having a civil dialogue about

29:25.800 --> 29:32.440
this position that there is no virus I think it's an important point of discussion and we're certainly

29:32.440 --> 29:38.440
not trying to censor that viewpoint thank you thank you Mary and now Christine

29:40.680 --> 29:48.440
Mary um first of all the no virus people are not we're not we don't have a hypothesis we're

29:48.440 --> 29:57.560
refuting a hypothesis so there is the key there is the key that they seem to think is like a dunk

29:57.560 --> 30:04.760
or it's like a it's like them slamming the case shut that we're you know we don't have a hypothesis

30:04.760 --> 30:16.440
we're refuting a hypothesis see that's the problem is that there may be no data being interpreted

30:16.440 --> 30:25.160
correctly but there's data there may be no observations being interpreted correctly but there are

30:25.240 --> 30:31.800
observations there may be no deaths that are being recorded correctly but there are deaths

30:34.360 --> 30:40.760
and so it is not sufficient and I will say this very very clearly it is not sufficient

30:42.200 --> 30:51.320
for you to come to this playing field of this level of sophistication and pretend to be engaging

30:51.320 --> 30:58.440
in the discussion by starting out with the words we don't have a hypothesis we are refuting one

31:03.160 --> 31:04.680
it is just so weak

31:06.920 --> 31:14.040
and it is just so disingenuous because if you have a hypothesis or rather if you think you can

31:14.040 --> 31:18.920
refute a hypothesis then there is a no

31:22.440 --> 31:28.840
maybe someone with a better understanding of the scientific method will argue that I'm flipping

31:28.840 --> 31:35.960
those two around but you if you refute if you're refuting a hypothesis then you're going back to

31:35.960 --> 31:44.360
the previous understanding what's the previous understanding here what's the biology after you

31:44.360 --> 31:53.240
refute this hypothesis about what about SARS-CoV-2 about a pandemic virus or about viruses in general

31:56.920 --> 32:03.720
because Christine Massey is arguing about SARS-CoV-2 right now and that's where it's also a little

32:03.800 --> 32:11.320
bit like shaky and a little bit sketchy because they flip flop back and forth between farewell

32:11.320 --> 32:20.280
to virology and foyas about SARS-CoV-2 and discussions about whether or not the virus has been isolated

32:20.280 --> 32:30.920
or or purified and whether they're talking about any virus ever being purified or SARS-CoV-2 being

32:30.920 --> 32:41.240
purified it's frustrating because I know I know in my heart of hearts that

32:43.720 --> 32:53.800
if they wanted to they could have already joined up and had sufficient influence to have shifted the

32:53.880 --> 33:03.560
whole the whole dissident group toward the general acceptance that there was no spreading pathogen

33:03.560 --> 33:09.160
and that they didn't ever isolate it and that it was probably made up and if there was one it might

33:09.160 --> 33:16.120
have been some other molecular explanation but because of the way they went about it for three

33:16.120 --> 33:21.400
years what they did was fractionate the resistance what they did was confuse the resistance what they

33:21.480 --> 33:29.720
did was create confusion and so instead of first coming together under the idea that we are under

33:29.720 --> 33:35.000
attack or that we are being fooled or that we are being misled and then let's figure our way out

33:35.000 --> 33:42.280
of it let's discuss it together it became immediately the intent was to fractionate they won't even

33:42.280 --> 33:49.800
talk to people the bailies won't even really interview with anyone they'll cancel interviews

33:49.800 --> 33:54.280
if they think that you're somebody who is too virusy

33:58.040 --> 34:05.400
and so it's super sketchy because this is not about winning this is about their own personal

34:05.400 --> 34:10.680
something and not not all of them maybe maybe Christine really means well but when you listen

34:11.800 --> 34:17.800
and you think about the fact that all they did was write letters many of them to police departments

34:17.880 --> 34:19.960
I don't care if it's 40 nations

34:23.240 --> 34:29.080
so then what do we have to dissect whether or not you wrote your foyer correctly

34:31.240 --> 34:37.080
do we have to dissect the language that you got as a response and and decide whether or not you

34:37.080 --> 34:45.080
asked the right question and is it plausible that a lot of the countries that you sent these

34:45.080 --> 34:53.160
letters to wouldn't be expected to have a pure sample of the virus is it does it count if you

34:53.160 --> 34:59.880
can mail one away and if the male ones are fake then why don't you order some and show that they're

34:59.880 --> 35:11.640
fake like it seems really quite possible to push this further it would seem quite possible to make

35:11.640 --> 35:19.320
allies and push this further but very few people on that side really actually set out

35:20.280 --> 35:25.240
to make allies and push it further you got to fully get on board with them without any

35:26.280 --> 35:32.520
without any reservations or they will attack you viciously until you ignore them for like half a

35:32.520 --> 35:39.720
year it's impressive it's really an impressive game they've played

35:40.680 --> 35:44.840
so obviously my question for you is related to what Bill was just saying

35:45.400 --> 35:51.480
I want to know what is children's children's health defense is a current position on the issue

35:51.480 --> 35:57.720
does the virus exist or does it not and the reason I have to ask this is because in April of last

35:57.720 --> 36:04.760
year eric cappolino question Robert F Kennedy junior at an event it was recorded it's on eric's

36:04.760 --> 36:13.160
website he asked so eric cappolino also did a pretty crappy interview attack with me right

36:13.160 --> 36:19.080
he interviewed me for three hours we talked very very very frankly about it I think we had a really

36:19.080 --> 36:23.640
good discussion and then he wrote a really really negative sub stack to promote it

36:26.040 --> 36:33.480
and there's no question in my mind that what he wrote in his sub stack reflected a preconceived

36:33.480 --> 36:38.600
notion about who I was and the fact that I was helping Bobby Kennedy meant I was already

36:39.560 --> 36:42.760
corrupted in some way or bamboozled or even worse

36:45.320 --> 36:50.520
and I kind of went into that whole situation pretty naive I didn't really know who eric was and I

36:50.520 --> 36:56.440
didn't really look it up and it didn't really matter to me and he seemed like a pretty nice guy and

36:56.440 --> 37:00.520
he's you know I've got all these radio shows and I've been doing it for years and that's great

37:00.600 --> 37:07.080
but I felt bad afterward because I should have probably looked into it better and should have

37:07.080 --> 37:13.160
realized that he was going to attack Bobby using me no matter what I said or how I said it

37:14.440 --> 37:18.600
and it's it's tough because these people don't want to acknowledge that

37:20.120 --> 37:27.960
what I'm saying is so nuanced that it's it's almost comical to me because when I first figured out

37:28.040 --> 37:34.120
the clones or what I what I thought was the clones when I've come to the hypothesis that

37:34.120 --> 37:39.800
I'm currently working with I reached out to these people and tried to explain how I think wow listen

37:39.800 --> 37:44.120
to this you might be right and we might be right and like we're both right but not right and so

37:44.120 --> 37:52.840
let's talk about it no no no no no no no no no and in fact that's really what the response is that

37:52.840 --> 37:57.960
she's going to complain about here that I wrote to them and didn't supply any

37:59.320 --> 38:07.400
I didn't supply any papers with it no citations at all because you can go on PubMed and search

38:07.400 --> 38:14.280
for infectious clones and start reading and you can understand what these virologists think

38:16.760 --> 38:22.600
and so if you understand what the virologists think then you can understand where perhaps

38:22.680 --> 38:30.280
that whole field is thinking incorrectly and then Christine Massey and me and the virology

38:30.280 --> 38:36.680
or the no virus people are all pretty much on the same page but what's very curious is that they

38:36.680 --> 38:44.520
don't seem to want to discuss the possibility that a small tank of semi-pure infectious RNA

38:44.520 --> 38:49.880
could be made and they don't want to think about what that might do to a cell culture or what that

38:49.880 --> 38:55.640
might do if you put it in a vaporizer they don't want to think about what they would that would do

38:55.640 --> 39:03.240
if you put it into a lipid nanoparticle and then released it aerosolized they don't want to think

39:03.240 --> 39:08.680
about what would happen if you tried to culture somebody who had been transfected with that agent

39:08.680 --> 39:15.160
they don't want to think about transfection agents even though it's all out there that

39:15.160 --> 39:19.800
Peter Cullis has said it that you know we can pretty much put any size DNA or RNA inside

39:20.360 --> 39:22.680
of a lipid nanoparticle that's very easy

39:26.760 --> 39:31.800
and we know already that these things can be aerosolized because there's countless countless

39:32.600 --> 39:39.800
grants for this stuff I mean so what are we talking about here we're talking about the fact

39:39.800 --> 39:44.680
that you need to be a bit more nuanced when you talk about bioweapons and how they might be used

39:45.240 --> 39:50.360
you need to be a little bit more nuanced when you talk about okay if there are no viruses

39:50.360 --> 39:57.880
what do you mean by that because what they want you to say that what they want to say is that what

39:57.880 --> 40:04.200
what the foy is show and what their debunking of those paper shows is that there's no nothing

40:04.200 --> 40:11.800
there that's the bad conclusion of course there's something there every time you spin down that

40:12.600 --> 40:19.400
that range of size of particles you spin it down you find RNA in DNA and you find it oftentimes

40:19.400 --> 40:24.360
coded in lipids are those viruses I don't know are they pathogenic I don't know are they self

40:24.360 --> 40:30.120
replicating pathogens I don't know maybe a small fraction of them are maybe none of them are

40:31.320 --> 40:37.800
maybe all of them are just RNA signals that every mammals immune system produces and sometimes those

40:38.760 --> 40:43.800
those travel or that they produce symptoms that we call the common cold that we call

40:43.800 --> 40:48.680
respiratory disease which is essentially inflammation caused by the interaction of two immune systems

40:50.360 --> 40:55.080
the point is is that if you come to this with no hypothesis then how do you explain all of this

40:55.800 --> 41:04.520
this anecdotal data over the last 50 years of spreading illness and of immune of immune activation

41:08.520 --> 41:15.720
it could be very possible that our understanding is wrong our understanding is not as as perfect

41:15.720 --> 41:24.120
as we thought it could be that all the cartoons are wrong but there are RNA and DNA signals at this

41:24.120 --> 41:33.400
size scale that are occur in nature that occur within our own bodies and that can be artificially

41:33.480 --> 41:40.040
created if none of these things are obligate pathogens that replicate themselves and go around

41:40.040 --> 41:48.840
the earth then I'm completely on your page but that there was no virus that there are no viruses

41:48.840 --> 41:54.920
that there are no exosomes that can cause immune activation that there are no extracellular

41:54.920 --> 42:00.920
vesicles that can get released that there are no exosomes with with proteins from your own body

42:00.920 --> 42:07.560
or from your own immune system or from that of mammals around you in the air I think is a pretty

42:07.560 --> 42:14.200
big statement to make so have these signals been confounded as viruses maybe possibly that's what

42:14.200 --> 42:20.040
I'm trying to argue that's what I'm trying to understand that's that that's I'm trying to come

42:20.040 --> 42:28.440
up with a hypothesis to explain the last 50 years of biology is not all phantoms that some of these

42:28.440 --> 42:35.480
biologists have been making making measurements the measurements have been repeatable but we have

42:35.480 --> 42:43.880
misunderstood what those measurements mean because of things like virology and this hyping up of this

42:44.760 --> 42:51.400
size scale is containing obligate pathogens that we have to be afraid of it's very possible

42:52.120 --> 42:58.360
but then you're not going to get there with this attitude where I've written more foyas than you

43:00.520 --> 43:05.160
and and that's it we don't have a hypothesis we're refuting one

43:11.080 --> 43:14.360
we don't have a hypothesis we are refuting one

43:15.160 --> 43:23.560
I don't know I just I I don't really know

43:25.960 --> 43:30.920
Robert to comment on the hundreds of freedom of information responses that my colleagues

43:30.920 --> 43:36.680
and I have collected from around the world showing that no one has a sample of the alleged virus

43:36.680 --> 43:41.960
no one has any record of anyone on earth obtaining a sample of the alleged virus

43:42.040 --> 43:48.520
okay so what does that mean then what does it mean does that mean that we've all used PCR

43:48.520 --> 43:56.520
incorrectly does it mean that you see no one has a sample of the virus so it's really not

43:57.240 --> 44:03.240
the argument that they're really making that this is like a little disingenuous performance

44:03.640 --> 44:08.600
because Mark Bailey is making the argument that there are no viruses

44:12.360 --> 44:16.360
Sam Bailey's making the argument that there are no viruses measles was a hoax

44:24.760 --> 44:30.760
and this is a problem it's a problem because I don't think it's sophisticated enough to count

44:30.840 --> 44:37.880
for what we know and don't know and I don't think that going back to the first papers about measles

44:37.880 --> 44:43.640
disproves the more recent papers about those particles and about their immunogenic properties

44:43.640 --> 44:49.640
and about our responses our immune system responses to that it just doesn't

44:51.720 --> 44:57.240
if you want to say the coronavirus research is weak I already did that that's why I tried to

44:57.320 --> 45:05.160
get in contact with them because I wanted them to understand that I was coming on to their side

45:05.160 --> 45:10.360
that I think they might have something here but understand that these people that are finding

45:10.360 --> 45:15.880
these little signals in the wild whether it's through metagenomic sequencing or through weird

45:15.880 --> 45:23.080
PCR fishing expeditions they are making infectious clones of these sequences and if you make infectious

45:23.080 --> 45:27.240
clones it's only a question of quantity if you want to make enough

45:31.720 --> 45:38.200
then you can put it everywhere and I don't think they've considered the possibility that if you

45:38.200 --> 45:43.240
could put a few trillion RNA molecules in somebody's lungs that you might be able to get a positive

45:43.240 --> 45:50.120
PCR test that they might get sick and that it might be limited contagion that the exhaling and

45:50.120 --> 45:56.520
the shedding of exosomes caused by a transfection like that if the if the shedding is a spike protein

45:58.680 --> 46:01.320
and the spike protein is an irritant

46:03.960 --> 46:07.240
is an immunogen then what do you have

46:09.640 --> 46:15.000
but that wasn't there that wasn't something that jumped out of a laboratory and ran around the

46:15.080 --> 46:21.240
world that would be something that they would have to make and make in quantity and put it where

46:21.240 --> 46:28.200
it needed to be and then purposely find it and wave about it which is very different than there

46:28.200 --> 46:35.240
was no virus and while they waste all their time on this they'd never talk about anything else

46:35.240 --> 46:40.680
they're not talking about remdesivir madazalam or the protocols killing people or ventilators

46:40.760 --> 46:44.840
they're just talking about isolation isolation isolation isolation there are other ways

46:45.880 --> 46:50.440
there are other methods and there are other questions to ask in order to prove that there

46:50.440 --> 46:57.560
wasn't a pandemic and that's the best refutation of these people that there is

46:58.920 --> 47:04.920
that if they wanted they really wanted to win and they really wanted us to win as in us as in human

47:04.920 --> 47:10.440
kind to win against this tyranny then they wouldn't stop at isolation and purification

47:10.440 --> 47:13.560
they'd also talk about PCR and sequencing and all this other stuff

47:16.120 --> 47:19.400
and they would talk about protocols and how many people were killed

47:21.800 --> 47:26.120
and they would talk about how dumb transfection is and how many people were killed

47:29.480 --> 47:33.160
and before that they would have talked about how many people are going to be killed

47:35.480 --> 47:41.400
but for some reason they never have they've never wasted a minute on that

47:43.240 --> 47:49.880
they've wasted hours writing and compiling foyer reports but almost no time at all on the

47:49.880 --> 47:58.440
people that were murdered to create the illusion of a pandemic no time at all on Jessica Hockett

47:58.760 --> 48:07.240
no time at all on Denny Rancour because Denny won't say there's no virus so we don't want to talk to him

48:07.240 --> 48:09.480
even if he has evidence that there was no virus

48:12.120 --> 48:16.360
Jay won't say there's no virus so we don't want to talk to him even though if he says that there was

48:16.360 --> 48:25.000
no virus you see it's it's a thing it's ridiculous it was a game and even if they stop playing it now

48:25.000 --> 48:34.440
understand how much damage they did understand how how dangerous the game that they played because

48:34.440 --> 48:38.920
it really it really took interesting thinking people out of the fight

48:41.320 --> 48:46.280
it really did and it saved them that's one good thing maybe they didn't take the shot

48:48.120 --> 48:52.600
but now they're not useful allies now they've been completely disarmed

48:55.000 --> 49:00.280
and now they are not critically thinking at all instead of considering the possibility of how

49:00.280 --> 49:05.800
evil these people actually are how far would they actually go to get what they want when it's

49:05.800 --> 49:07.320
all the marbles that they want

49:11.480 --> 49:14.600
and these people spend time attacking CHD

49:16.680 --> 49:23.320
the organization that was the only one legitimately fighting the the vaccine schedule in America

49:23.320 --> 49:29.800
before this and of course if you don't have a sample of the alleged virus you can't have any

49:29.800 --> 49:36.040
science whatsoever and you can't have a validated test you can't have any any COVID-19 science whatsoever

49:36.760 --> 49:43.800
and Robert's response basically he became very tongue tied tried to laugh it off and in the

49:43.800 --> 49:48.040
end said he wished he had just shut up from the beginning and said that he was not going to answer

49:48.040 --> 49:54.120
the question and then later in 2020 there was a private email from robert of kennedy jr to

49:54.120 --> 50:00.680
a prominent person in the no virus movement who had been asking robert to help us because we've

50:00.680 --> 50:06.920
been busting our asses since early yes she is about to start crying which is also fake i'm telling

50:06.920 --> 50:14.840
you this is ridiculous and it is a purposeful dramatic attack on chd to try and make it seem like

50:14.840 --> 50:23.400
chd is this evil organization that won't talk to them won't give them a platform when they

50:23.400 --> 50:29.640
totally had a platform and they totally blew it they were allowed to talk they were allowed to

50:29.640 --> 50:38.120
present and they set the the the parameters of the debate and it didn't have the results that

50:38.120 --> 50:48.440
they wanted so then chd's band and i've told you many times on on the on the show that this book

50:49.240 --> 50:55.160
is another book about again a function virus it's another book about the narrative that we are

50:55.160 --> 51:02.200
trying to break the scooby-doo but i also told you that bobby wanted to write the book about the

51:02.200 --> 51:06.280
scooby-doo about the narrative about what everybody said what all the people said

51:08.840 --> 51:13.960
because one of the things that the no virus people ask you to do and more importantly ask

51:13.960 --> 51:22.280
anyone who's not yet taken a side to do is to really accept is really to accept the maximum

51:23.080 --> 51:32.280
inversion of reality all at once there was no virus there is no virus is a complete

51:32.280 --> 51:37.080
inversion of the reality that everyone has experienced on tv and with their friends and family and

51:37.080 --> 51:44.680
with social media and with their whole life because they have been prepared for this for 20 years by

51:45.480 --> 51:52.920
the messaging of this same system and the reason why i took until 2022 to wake up was because of

51:52.920 --> 52:00.120
this same system and so without compassion without understanding without empathy

52:01.720 --> 52:06.040
they approach you with ultimatums and and tell you that you have to accept

52:06.520 --> 52:16.040
the hardest thing to accept instead of seeking ways to bring people closer to accepting it

52:16.600 --> 52:21.720
which is what i tried to do several times with them trying to explain to them that

52:23.000 --> 52:30.760
the use of recombinant DNA to make large quantities of what people call infectious RNA but an

52:31.400 --> 52:33.880
RNA that can be transfected into cells

52:37.880 --> 52:44.760
we don't know but i think it's a very likely possibility that what happens is that RNA

52:44.760 --> 52:49.560
translates it copies because that's what it does that's what they've designed it to do

52:50.520 --> 52:53.960
and it produces exosomes that are are immunogenic

52:53.960 --> 53:00.360
that's it it's real simple

53:03.320 --> 53:11.400
and so all of virology is based on this principle and virologists accepted as evidence of viruses

53:11.400 --> 53:19.480
and anybody who understands it to the sophistication level that i think we have come to understand it

53:20.440 --> 53:25.080
understands it as a as an illusion that they they choose not to break

53:26.520 --> 53:31.800
when they nanopore sequence the results of transfecting a clone into a cell culture

53:31.800 --> 53:37.240
they just ignore the fact that they can't find full genomes they make excuses that the nanopore

53:37.800 --> 53:42.840
you know it can read those really long things and when we're selling it for grant proposals

53:42.840 --> 53:48.520
we say it can read two million bases at once but when it comes to finding full genomes of

53:48.520 --> 53:56.200
coronavirus as well hand wave hand wave excuse excuse even though you find 600 000 copies of the

53:56.200 --> 54:02.920
subgenomic RNAs of some of these structural proteins and so we know the the immunogenic proteins are

54:02.920 --> 54:08.600
made and if they're made in sufficient quantity then we know they're shed as exosomes and so the

54:08.600 --> 54:15.800
only real debate is how many times does it get a fully infectious RNA inside of it as it's released

54:15.800 --> 54:19.960
probably not very often if ever but that doesn't matter for virology

54:23.320 --> 54:28.520
and so they're a hundred percent right as far as i can tell they're a hundred percent right

54:28.520 --> 54:37.560
especially when it comes to coronaviruses it is really spectacular how little good evidence

54:37.560 --> 54:43.640
there is for the fidelity that they're now claiming in the virus literature previous to the pandemic

54:44.520 --> 54:51.080
if you look at how they found coronaviruses how they cultured them and how they characterized them

54:53.080 --> 54:58.280
they just simply did not have the fidelity that they claim to have now they just don't have the

54:58.280 --> 55:04.200
accuracy that they claim to have now it now they claim to be able to sequence them on a whim

55:04.840 --> 55:09.880
from beginning to end and before the pandemic that was just unheard of it was very difficult

55:09.880 --> 55:17.000
to do so much so that Ralph Barrick had invented a way of creating and substituting

55:17.640 --> 55:24.680
the sequences that you probably most likely would not find when you find hints of coronavirus

55:26.600 --> 55:33.400
and so the most likely hypothesis i think a valid hypothesis would be to explain what these

55:33.480 --> 55:40.200
particles are and explain what these RNA signals are in the wild are they really just noise

55:42.040 --> 55:48.760
or are there RNA signals which are released by these animals produced in these animals either

55:48.760 --> 55:53.400
by their own machinery or by a pathogen but i think it's more likely to be their own machinery

55:54.680 --> 55:59.000
their own their own immune system or their own and epithelial cells

55:59.560 --> 56:05.880
but if it is their own immune system or their own cells producing RNA signals and those RNA signals

56:05.880 --> 56:13.400
because of some kind of receptor overlap can occasionally activate our own immune system

56:13.400 --> 56:23.960
that that's not surprising to me and the fact that if the NIH and the NIAID found this signal range

56:24.040 --> 56:30.840
signal range by accident when they made a hepatitis v vaccine in the 70s

56:32.120 --> 56:37.160
in a primate cell culture that also had exosomes of immune origin in it

56:39.480 --> 56:45.880
and then they realized that wow this is crazy the immune system communicates with retroviruses

56:45.880 --> 56:53.560
and with with exosomes that can have RNA in it and we didn't ever know it and now we made vaccines

56:54.440 --> 57:03.400
and we contaminated humans with with another species exosomes

57:07.560 --> 57:13.160
now that's a lot better than coming to the table with no hypothesis and only refuting one

57:16.280 --> 57:22.680
that's a lot better than coming to the table and insisting that people accept your premises

57:22.680 --> 57:27.480
of debate and stay within it rather than having a broad spectrum debate about why

57:28.200 --> 57:29.960
a lot of this biology is weak

57:32.520 --> 57:38.040
and i am telling you folks with almost 100% certainty the reason why they did this for three

57:38.040 --> 57:42.600
years is exactly to get us here where we're still talking about this

57:44.520 --> 57:50.280
where people are still debating it as if i haven't said it already for a year and a half

57:50.280 --> 57:57.240
almost two years that there is a way for both sides to basically be right there's a way for

57:57.240 --> 58:03.080
all the molecular biologists to be right all the the they did this to us people be right

58:03.080 --> 58:07.560
and that there's no virus people all of them can be right if you accept the fact

58:08.520 --> 58:15.720
that infectious clones can be used to seed the narrative anywhere they wanted to safely and effectively

58:15.880 --> 58:21.560
so that molecular biologists would get their proof that cultures would work

58:22.200 --> 58:29.720
that sequences would be robust and they would be high fidelity matched across these locations

58:31.080 --> 58:34.600
i think they could do it for under a hundred thousand dollars and that's paying everybody

58:34.600 --> 58:40.280
that's doing it very well that's how easy i think it would be and yet for some reason or

58:40.280 --> 58:45.080
another by bringing up this idea that means i believe that there are viruses

58:45.080 --> 58:48.120
that means that chd believes that there are viruses

58:53.080 --> 58:59.800
wow 2020 to get this truth out with no help whatsoever from children's health

58:59.800 --> 59:04.840
defense and like those saying you guys are just underlining rubber stamping the cord

59:04.840 --> 59:11.800
live the cord fraud and uh robert's response was i'm grateful for your courage and intellectual

59:11.800 --> 59:17.240
integrity i have an open mind on this issue i admire and i encourage you but i must take off

59:17.240 --> 59:22.520
on this war for the time being i'm more likely to join you if you get it near the goal line where

59:22.520 --> 59:28.920
the cost returns ratio improves and so now we think about how arrogant it is that she says it that way

59:28.920 --> 59:36.600
to robert f Kennedy jr who has you know i've been putting his whatever reputation on the line

59:36.600 --> 59:45.000
to defend the vaccine injured in america for five seven years before this and marry as well

59:46.520 --> 59:53.720
and so now this is how grateful they are they've already put their life and their liberty and their

59:53.720 --> 59:58.680
professional reputations on the line before the covid pandemic ever brought you out of your little

59:58.680 --> 01:00:06.200
house way before the pandemic ever made you more than a fluoride activist

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:16.040
think about this very carefully what could possibly motivate you to to behave this way unless you've

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:27.000
been encouraged to do so it's not smart how do you win people over like this you think that's how i

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:40.120
got my job at chd just bullied my way in it's an organization of people that have all got skin

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:45.560
in the game except for like three of us like real skin in the game

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:54.040
like they've got a kid at home or a teenager at home or a young adult at home that is still

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:01.800
completely devastated by quick onset vaccine induced autism

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.000
and these people have been fighting before anyone cared to listen

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.440
Mary's been fighting long before anyone cared to listen about covid

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.120
and they opened their doors wide and they listened to all these people who just woke up

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.000
because of covid mandates wow man i can't believe how screwed up this state is

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.200
boy chd should listen to me because i've really figured it out

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.520
if there's one thing i've learned since joining chd is that you didn't figure it out very early

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:42.600
if you're just figuring it out now you've been asleep for many many years while people were fighting

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.240
and that's me that's me included that's why i'm saying it because i've never ever ever felt like

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:59.160
this i've never felt like this no matter how disappointed i am in the stance they take or who

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.040
they have on or or who they talk to

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.520
i have never felt like that i've never ever felt like that because then what

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:20.120
if chd is bad who you're going to i can network you're going to mickey willis he's going to make

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:28.360
you a movie like i can network is not the same people

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.360
like i can network doesn't have its own i mean i don't know who you would go to honestly i don't

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:40.120
know why you would attack these people i don't know why you would not try to win them over and

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.800
then change their mind as opposed to bully your way to the to the goal which you're never going to get

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:53.400
to i i am upset and i'm breaking it up because it's going to get much worse and then in late

01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:01.560
last year we i contacted you and robert f Kennedy jr and i asked you what science or you rely

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:08.600
relying on your website is full of content about a virus a pandemic um all sorts of things relating

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.440
to the alleged virus i asked you what science you related uh relying on you gave me no answers

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:21.480
whatsoever and then you put me in touch with jay cooey you're the who you and jay both told me

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:29.960
that jay was um chd science consultant jay cooey also was not able to cite a shred of science

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:39.640
and then um on one of his videos about two months ago he admitted that in for the last 20 years

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:45.800
virology has been been based on indirect observations of things that virologists see now what's wrong

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:57.640
with this what's wrong with this he admitted so what does that mean that i was lying before

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.840
i was covering something up before you see this is an attack

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.760
rather than saying that it seems like you guys are changing your mind it seems like that he

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.080
understands that i'm very encouraged by it and i hope that you will realize maybe maybe we can

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.400
meet common ground and maybe we need to have another meeting maybe we should have Andy

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:25.960
Kaufman on again and have him talk to jay instead they take exactly the opposite move accuse me of

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:34.600
lying rather than finally figuring it out and if you don't see how obvious this is

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.040
i'm not sure i can help you but this is how the game is played this is what the joke is

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.240
you want to see fifth generation warfare i'm afraid

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.480
willing or unwilling that's what you're watching right here i don't think christine is

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:58.920
necessarily a waiting participant in this so she might just really think that this is the

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.360
there are one chance to take it to that whole organization that she's become convinced is

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.280
just a bunch of of well it's like a second government she's gonna say

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.720
as she almost breaks down in tears

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:24.040
i'm sorry but we need to beat this and the way we're going to beat it is when we start to call

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:30.840
people out for the charlatans that they are either you you pick up the pieces every time

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.960
they fall apart a little bit and you keep walking you you drop all your stuff or you trip and fall

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:41.560
and you keep going or you trip and fall and then you sit there and you complain and complain and

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.360
complain and complain you trip to me you trip to me

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:53.560
they've given them plenty of time on their on their forum they've given them articles they've

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.880
shown their opinion they've they've represented it quite well

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and in the end the reason why the argument doesn't succeed is because exactly what she started out

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.480
with which is that we don't have a hypothesis we're refuting one so then you can't really have a

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:21.880
discussion with them about what really happened because as she's trying to say here he admits that

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:28.280
virology is based on a lot of indirect measurements yeah and so let's make a bridge

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:36.200
not let's burn one and not even prove exist this is your science consultant saying this

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:44.040
so my question what is chd's crimp position on the alleged virus does it exist yes or no and if yes

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:51.240
then what science are you relating on

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.600
i don't know that i can answer that in a way that you will find satisfying i think we're open to

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:03.080
the idea that there's not a virus we're open to the idea that there is a virus we i'm sorry but

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:11.400
refuting there's there's always two hypotheses there's the null hypothesis right that's what the

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:17.240
truth is if your hypothesis isn't right i think that's how they talk about it i don't really care

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.880
what the exact and the exact discussion point is if if the theory is

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.840
i don't know i don't have a good i don't i don't have a good analogy for it because it's such a

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:45.320
simple proposition the floor is wet in my office my hypothesis is that somebody left the door open

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:53.880
and then the rain came in and you refute the hypothesis you say that well no the door was locked

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.720
so there's no there's no way the rain could have gotten in here so you refuted the hypothesis so

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.680
then what's your hypothesis what do you think happened again no i just want you to admit that

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:12.200
the door was locked and therefore the rain couldn't come in anymore okay well i i kind of agree that

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.520
that's a really good point so then what do you where do you think the water came from no don't

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:28.200
you see there's no water well okay so then if it's not water what is it there's no pathogen there's

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.600
no spreading there's no sickness there's no signals there's monomolecular biology

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:43.880
it's all made up because we have foyas and the foyas say that they don't have any purified virus

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:51.000
they didn't isolate anything and so it's kind of this circle thing like this circling circling

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.880
circling and they never seem to get to the point where oh yeah they murdered people

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.600
they killed a bunch of people in hospitals they should have never ventilated those people

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.880
i think they lied about protocols maybe they shouldn't have used remdesivir

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.280
i think they should have told people to take care of better care of themselves i think the lockdowns

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.840
killed a lot of people foyas foyas foyas foyas foyas

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:23.560
they were part of the reason why humankind is still trapped in the scooby-doo

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:33.240
they are the reason because the only alternative to the scooby-doo was a refutation of a hypothesis

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.000
with no alternative no alternative explanation

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.480
how easy would it be to go across the street to your neighbor's house and say hey did you know

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.920
that there was no pandemic because there is no SARS-CoV-2 and then they would just put all their

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:55.160
stuff to oh wow jeez i took this man wow i'm so glad you told me i'll never listen to everybody

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:02.440
else on the planet again that's what you get when you don't have an alternative hypothesis

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.520
you get nothing you have nothing to offer then you have nothing to teach

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:15.720
you have no clarity or peace to offer if you have no hypothesis but only a refutation

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.000
what is the way forward not that way it's not that way i don't know what we should do but

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.760
we shouldn't go that way okay great

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:41.800
so once we agree as as she says once i admit that virology is based on a lot of smoke and mirrors

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:50.920
now what i guess nothing you write about both dimensions to that uh jay kui is somebody who

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.120
has studied virology and so i think he is and has been delving more deeply in that i don't

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.880
we're trying to cover the issue i don't think we've stated that there is the virus we haven't

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:12.440
stated that there's not a virus we're exploring what the reality is and we clearly agree with you

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:20.280
that there are very serious problems with the narrative i don't think we have definitive answers

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.480
on a lot of this bobby's writing a book with all of your stats your your website is full of

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.320
content about a virus gain of function see so now she's going to go on a rant

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:43.320
because her job is to attack chd her job is not to win people over or to teach or to build bridges

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:54.680
or to change chd's mind her goal is to paint everybody at chd is a liar by saying words like jay

01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:04.040
admitted and your website is full of and Robert of kennedy jr has a whole book coming out about the

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:10.680
origin of so-called covid you have not been dealing with this an imbalanced way interesting

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:18.440
because there's a line in here interesting isn't it wow it's really cool that this book is out now

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:26.600
in like a day or two because there's an index and in the index you can go and find out all the

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:32.120
places where i'm quoted and you can go to the last one on page 441

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:43.240
and you can read the words as jonathan cooey said no actual virus would even be necessary

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:56.120
interesting choice of words on page 441 of this book about the origins of the pandemic

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:04.840
this book is going to bring the rain whether they like it or not

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.280
i guarantee you this book is going to bring the rain

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.240
and it could have brought the rain a lot sooner and they could have been a part of it they could have

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.000
occurred it helped it could have been a bigger part of the book

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.000
it could have been a more important part of the book had they

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.760
genuinely pushed their argument from the very beginning

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.800
but actually it was an extremely coordinated dance because if you will remember there were a

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:48.840
couple really really early opponents of the andrew koffman and no virus crowd really early

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:57.880
opponents in the ring they showed up in february of 2020 already adamantly opposed to two things

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:07.560
the 5g people and the no virus people and so they already had courageous opponents

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:18.200
planted in the internet from the very start like from the very very start the no virus people

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:26.920
and the anti no virus people were seated and they're still going they're still going

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.080
those people are still going right now the no virus people stick into the same story that they've

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:42.680
been saying basically since 2020 and the crazy part is is the anti no virus people that started

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:50.360
also in february of 2020 opposing the no virus narrative and opposing 5g are still there

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.880
and the funny thing is is that those people those people were pushing the spike protein

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.960
and amyloidosis and prion disease also extremely early in 2020 and they're still pushing it now

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:12.840
and so what's this all about it's about seeing these groups these little teams

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.760
that were feigning opposition to one another way too early in the pandemic for it to be

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:27.320
grassroots oh i heard about these people i'm gonna be sure to start on them early yeah right

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.480
how come i'd never heard of any of these people at the beginning of 2020 how come none of these

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.960
people had heard of any of these other people in 2020 except for these two groups the worst case scenario

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:56.000
group who was getting tips from the c cdc and phone calls from taiwan saying that remdesivir would be the only thing that could save us and speculating about a billion people dead were also anti no virus.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:06.360
anti-no virus. As early as February 2020, already knew Andy Kaufman's name. Andy

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.640
Kaufman, who I have pictures of with Andrew Cuomo because he got a contract

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.120
for a biometric device in prisons right before the pandemic. Oh, you didn't know

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:29.500
that. We're coming strong now. This is not, this is, this is for all the

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:34.520
marbles. We, we are saving our children here. You don't think this is a some kind

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:41.520
of stream for fun. I've never seen this video. I had no idea that Mary Holland

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.520
went to bat for me like this. And I had no idea that they attacked CHD like this.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:53.520
And in my name, basically, I don't know what I had done back in when this video

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.480
was made. I might have overreacted. I might have blown it. It's really good that I

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:07.380
didn't see it. But this is just blatant because she's not critiquing me. She's

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:12.780
critiquing CHD. And she's critiquing CHD despite the fact that CHD does not

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:20.060
have a blemished record of bungling, you know, stances on things. They have

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.660
Brian Hooker working for them.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:33.060
You gave, or you had David Raznik and Michael Wallach on one time. And I

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.660
think there's one presentation with Alex Zach or one other, one other

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.660
something on your website compared to what hundreds and hundreds, maybe

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:46.540
thousands of articles, interviews, conversations about COVID-19, as if it's a

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:53.100
real phenomenon. So no, with all due respect, you have. So it's all up to CHD to

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:59.260
ignore all the doctors, all the CDC, all the TV, all the, it's up to CHD to do

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:05.900
that. An organization that is opposing childhood vaccination, trying to advocate

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:11.460
for vaccine injured people before the pandemic. Now, it's all on the shoulders

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:16.100
of CHD to figure this out. And to be on the right side, as opposed to just

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:21.100
giving a voice to everybody in hopes that it'll sort itself out, giving a

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:26.620
voice to these people, where they can't get a voice anywhere else, except for

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.300
in really fringe places.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:36.340
And so instead of saying, thank you, but you're still making a mistake, being

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.940
respectful and saying, hey, we should have another argument because one of your

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:44.180
science advisors seems to really be coming around to understanding the flaws

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:49.100
of this argument. And maybe we can come to a new understanding, it is immediately

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:56.780
crap. And that's how you know this is not real. And if you combined it with

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:03.820
their, their behavior in 2020, and the way that exosomal communication just

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:10.500
slowly disappeared from all their talks, starting in February and March when they

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:18.220
still had it in. And then Andrew Kaufman never talked about it again. There is a

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.940
game being played here, ladies and gentlemen, and the Scooby-Doo is a lot

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:28.060
more complicated than most people ever dreamed it was. And I think this video

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.060
is one of the best examples of how you can really see through this. And I'm, I

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:37.220
think it's unfortunate. I think it's very possible that Christine is unwittingly

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:42.820
participating in this and very much convinced by other people that CHD is

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.700
the proper target for this kind of hire.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:54.780
And she's happy to do it. But I don't know, I'm super skeptical. It gets worse.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.860
It's not been, you have been, you have not been helping at all. You've been

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:04.420
extremely one sided, which to me is just blatantly unethical, unlawful, you're

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:09.620
misleading your, your people rely on you guys for accurate information. And they

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:14.620
think for God's sake, if there was no virus for all people's children's health

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:19.700
defense would be warning us. It's what it's been like for the last three years.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:23.460
It's been like having another layer of government to have to deal with, to

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:27.620
dispel the all the nonsense coming out of your organization.

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:33.860
Because there's like, I'm sorry, I just I

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:39.060
know I appreciate that. With all due respect, I brought on, you know, Andy

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.740
Kaufman and Tom Cowan to debate this with some of the other scientists who

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:48.380
are on this call. And it wasn't as fruitful as I would have helped. And like

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:52.380
I say, this is still something that we want to hear. I'm sorry, it's disappointing to

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:52.580
you.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.980
Now, now, can I just say for this issue, you know, this, I've been thinking,

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:04.180
you know, I'd love to see a debate. We've had presenters, we've had Andy

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:09.980
Kaufman here, Mary. And we've got people on this group who absolutely buying

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:15.860
Christine, you know, with no, the no virus, they're very, very well, Mark Bailey

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:19.620
here. And you've shared the perspective, we're not going to have a big debate here.

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:23.940
But Mary, you've raised it with Mary fairly. Will has raised it. And Mary is

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:27.980
just going to have to go, okay, that's the, that's the criticism and the valid

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:34.060
comment. And I would love to have that Mary, that that CHD debate. I really,

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.180
you know, it would be fantastic to have, you know, three hour tongs and all

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:43.140
because we've got people on this call, highly qualified doctors who say there

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.220
is no virus. And then we've got doctors who believe in the virus, who are

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:52.340
criticizing Christine and anybody who questions the virus. Like, you know,

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.140
Stephen gets it. I get it. We get criticized. How can you have anybody on

01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:03.440
this call who questions the virus? So everybody free speech. Will has

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.280
it better? Christine's expressed it. Mary's heard it. We go to the next comment.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.680
And we don't, you know, that that it's, it's a, it's an issue for Mary to go,

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.360
okay, from a CHD with all the great work that CHD is doing. I have not been

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.560
able to work through as a lawyer in my mind, you go, right, oh, are we going to

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.840
go back to this? What handling judges and all of these issues? It's a big

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.920
strategic question. I would love a big debate. And Christine, I totally

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:35.920
honor your work and your passion for this and Mark Barry and Alex Kaufman

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:42.560
and Tom Cowling. All right. So in my opinion, it would help enormously if

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:48.800
the no virus people took away the emotion and the recriminations and the hard

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:54.560
done by, yeah, we've all been hard done by in the last three years. And it's not

01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:02.400
attractive to hear all the emotion. Mary has answered very fairly. Let her do her

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.600
thing. Yeah, I love it. I think Mary did really well there. I probably made more

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.040
of it than I should have because it was an hour and 22 minutes, but it felt, it

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:19.240
felt like it needed to be wrung out. Because again, just the FOIA request thing

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.560
alone is really a joke to me because I have only been working for CHD for

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.440
like three months and I've already helped with a few Foyas. I was already

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.360
busy with it with another friend of mine before. But a Foya is a real art

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:40.400
thing. It's like a and and it's also a bit of a cat and mouse game that has not

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.000
simply played by making a form letter and then sending it to a lot of offices

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.240
and waiting for the letters to come back. It's a it's much more nuanced than

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:57.160
that. And it is possible that if you request records that don't exist, it

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.520
doesn't necessarily mean that the things don't exist. If there's no record at

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.000
that police station because they didn't make a piece of paper, there was no

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.360
communication about it, it doesn't provide evidence of something. And it's

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:18.600
very, very disingenuous. As I said, a few key Foyas to a few key places, it was

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.920
all that was required, not 212 institutions in 40 different countries,

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:29.280
where most of those would probably already you could have known you were

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.120
going to get a negative. But that's again, that's why this is obviously a

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:41.600
stunt. You would never waste that much time doing that many Foyas if your goal

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.760
was to win. Like you would have already established your point with the first

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:54.600
30 or 15. And then you would put your energy into something else. And instead,

01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:01.760
you know, it's always an attempt to attack. And so it's it's not good. I'm

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:08.040
going to see how far I get with this. What time is it 1143? Maybe I should

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.800
just end it here and do this. Alex Zec thing tomorrow. What do you think? I

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.920
think that might be a better idea. I'm gonna have to change the title of this

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:25.560
one then. Yeah, I think I should I should rest my voice. I'm gonna I'm gonna

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:35.480
leave it here. I really want to be sure that everybody is is happy with

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:42.760
things and understands that we are about to it's about to get really rocky. And

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:48.760
so we've got to be very, very good about being succinct. And so we don't we

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.680
don't we don't play the game of we don't have a hypothesis, right? That's not our

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.080
game. We definitely have a hypothesis. We have a hypothesis and the hypothesis

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.440
is infectious clones. That's the hypothesis. And the hypothesis is that

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.720
there was no spread. But rather there was limited release enough for sequencing

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:13.560
to work and enough to augment a probably already existing background with that

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:21.720
infectious clone release. So again, let's be very clear. I think that this slide is

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.880
pretty good. But you know, I've been using it for a while. So I get the fact

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.760
that not everybody likes it. But in 2018, the good the idea is that in 2018, the

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.480
earth was clear. And in the end of 2019, something leaked. And that leak resulted

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:47.920
in the vast majority of the human population being covered in a replicating

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:55.400
RNA pathogen, an RNA molecule that's coated in a lipoprotein coat. And despite

01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:02.160
that, that entity not being a pattern integrity, not needing energy to sustain

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:10.840
itself, not undergoing homeostasis, not being able to replicate on its own. We

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:18.600
attribute a lot of biological concepts that should only apply to pattern

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:24.960
integrities to this idea. And that illusion of consensus about the fact that

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:31.760
these concepts are applicable in this stage, have allowed us to be bamboozled

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:37.440
into the idea that there is pandemic potential. Because they've convinced us

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:43.400
quite frankly that viruses are all for all practical purposes alive and capable

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:51.960
of the same fidelity as other living things. That's how they got us to believe

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:57.920
there's a pandemic. Once you realize that an RNA molecule coded in a lipoprotein

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:06.120
is not capable of the kinds of behavior, let's say that a living organism is, and

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:15.120
that behavior includes expanding across the planet. RNA molecules cannot do that.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:29.800
No matter what all the stories they tell us. And that faith involves all of these

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.880
things from PCR being effective to asymptomatic spread being real and gain a

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.840
function virus is being real. And vaccines working great in the past and

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:46.400
working great this time too. And I'm telling you this is their train. This is

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:57.000
their train. They are performing an act. And that act is a lie. Because there is a

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.600
conflated background signal, I am sure of it. Because when they spin down these

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.520
samples to look for exosomes they find exosomes when they spin these samples

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:13.200
down and look for viruses they find viruses when they spin these samples down

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.640
and look for things they find them because when they spin these samples down they

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.520
get RNA and DNA. They get cellular debris they get everything at that size scale

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:32.280
and everything at that size scale is a lot of things. And so if they tell you

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:39.640
that they found something in there based on some partial signals it's very easy

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:46.960
for that to be a lie or a confounded background signal. Hey I think we found

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.200
something. Well what is it? It's a page of a book. I guess that means that the

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.640
whole book is in your backyard. Well it doesn't have to be. Yeah but I mean

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.560
there's newspapers back there and there's papers blowing all over the place so I

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.640
mean I found one book one page of the book so I imagine the whole books back

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:18.320
there. Okay perfect. All kinds of conflation. And why? Because they really

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:26.280
want us to be completely confused, completely fooled, completely unmoored

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:32.760
to reality. So that we just shrug our shoulders and say okay give me a digital

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:41.880
ID, give me digital currency, take my genetic data, take my medical data. Maybe

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:47.160
you can give me a little bit of a universal income for it in exchange.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:54.120
HUHA. I don't know what this show was. I guess it's a shout out to Mary Hall and

01:30:54.120 --> 01:31:00.560
for coming to my to have in my back and to taking the shells from Christine

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.760
Massey for all of CHD. Here's to you Mary. Well done. This is GIGO and

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.720
biological stop all transfections in humans because they want to eliminate

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:18.480
the control group by any means necessary. Kind of a mediocre stream tonight

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:24.760
I apologize. I had planned to do the Alex Zek video and not watch the the no

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.040
virus video for very long and then I don't know. I might have to take this one

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.360
down. I don't know how I feel about it. But thanks for joining me. I'm sorry I

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:37.760
was so late. Best of all practice tonight. Saturday and Sunday coming up

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.720
long December. I'm probably not gonna miss a day so I'll see you tomorrow. Unless

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.800
something crazy happens. I'll be here in some capacity or another state for

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.120
taking these things. Intramuscular injection and many combination of

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.640
substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.840
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.920
patterned integrities.
