00:30.000 --> 00:45.280
I'm not sure.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.200
Jeffrey how are you?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.120
You are unfortunately number two.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.600
How are the duck wins the cash today?

00:51.600 --> 00:55.440
Unfortunately, Jeff, I can't help you there.

00:55.440 --> 01:02.440
My harder next time.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.440
How are the duck was first according to my screen?

01:29.440 --> 01:32.440
How are the duck?

01:45.440 --> 01:47.440
I'm trying to get the latest note.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.440
I'm trying to get the latest note.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.440
I'm trying to get the latest note.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
I'm trying to get the latest note.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.440
This is essentially a worst-case scenario.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.440
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us

01:57.440 --> 01:59.440
that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.440
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us

02:01.440 --> 02:03.440
that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
Mark had another good one.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.440
Make sure you're following this guy.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.440
He's got a lot of channels.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.440
You've got to be studious.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.440
Maybe just go to his website, you know, bookmarked that.

02:26.440 --> 02:35.440
There is no hate in this stream, my friend.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.440
Welcome from San Diego.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.440
There is no hate in this stream.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.440
I think it's good for kids.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
We're so busy lying.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.440
We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.440
We want everybody to feel good.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.440
That's not the way life is.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.440
This episode is sponsored by Moink.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.440
That's Mo plus Moink.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.440
My point is that if we were able to, just like we're trying to get everybody to take the vaccine,

03:12.440 --> 03:19.440
if we had put that into getting everybody to take hypermectin and fluvoxamine for a month,

03:19.440 --> 03:23.440
and if we could accomplish that, then COVID would be wiped out.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
We could do it.

03:24.440 --> 03:30.440
Actually any municipality that could regulate its borders could clear the disease if you could accomplish that goal.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.440
I believe.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.440
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.440
And I have lied.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.440
I don't want to lie, you know.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
I don't think I'm a liar.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.440
I try not to be a liar.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
I don't want to be a liar.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.440
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:09.440 --> 04:16.440
Not really much outside today for birds.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.440
It's the middle of the afternoon, so it's a little hot.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
Missed the morning.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.440
I want to try and do a morning show, but I don't know.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.440
It's a big commitment.

04:28.440 --> 04:33.440
Once I say I'm going to do a morning show, I better be doing a morning show.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.440
Dr. Salk was really our friend.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
He definitely was.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.440
Dr. Salk's a great guy.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
Seems like a great guy.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.440
Whatever Mark found, you know, what's her name?

04:43.440 --> 04:44.440
That more lady?

04:44.440 --> 04:48.440
I think she was a housekeeper for Kissinger.

04:48.440 --> 04:55.440
I think she had like houses next door to him or houses down the street from him all over the place.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.440
I think it's because he was, that was his housekeeper or something.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.440
I guess you got to see Mark stream to know what Alice Moore actually did.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.440
I think she was Kissinger's housekeeper.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.440
You have to check it out.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
The rules.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.440
Protect yourself at all times.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.440
Follow my instructions.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
Keep it clean.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.440
Touch gloves if you wish.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.440
Let's do it.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
Sweaty bombs.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.440
This is so crazy.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.440
Like these bombs.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.440
This is so crazy.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
I feel so nervous.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.440
Like what in the world, man?

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
Hey, Albert.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.440
Please make sure you watch Mark's Salk History episode from this morning.

05:35.440 --> 05:40.440
It is definitely worth your time.

05:40.440 --> 05:48.440
I wanted to do a short video stream or a short broadcast about a couple videos I found.

05:48.440 --> 06:00.440
Number one, I wanted to substantiate the small print that I'm using on one of my slides with regard to Medicare and Medicaid costs being saved

06:00.440 --> 06:03.440
as a result of the pandemic.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.440
And so I want to address that.

06:05.440 --> 06:12.440
And then staying focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and loving your neighbor.

06:12.440 --> 06:22.440
I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at this guy named Alex Berenson, who I think was kind of, you know, he was elevated through censorship.

06:22.440 --> 06:32.440
He was elevated by being allowed to complain about censorship, whereas people like Mark and myself are censored and we're not allowed to complain.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
We're not asked to complain about it.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.440
In fact, nobody considers any of the sacrifices that we've made, even worth mentioning.

06:39.440 --> 06:51.440
And so it's really quite striking that our growth is so linear and it comes down to every one of you taking the time to after you watch this stream to actually grab the link.

06:51.440 --> 06:58.440
Share it and put it on Twitter or put it on Facebook or put it wherever you put things because that's how this works.

06:58.440 --> 07:05.440
It's the only way that this can work is by actual human overriding the algorithm.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.440
Otherwise, no one will ever see me.

07:07.440 --> 07:18.440
And no matter how many loyal supporters I have that make this possible that put the sandwiches in my kids lunchbox, it doesn't matter because the word won't get around.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.440
The biology needs to find new folks.

07:20.440 --> 07:33.440
And so besides sharing the stream, you can also share giggleembiological.com because it's kind of a little hub of ways to find out what I did and what I'm doing and what we're doing, what we're trying to accomplish, where we're putting this stuff.

07:33.440 --> 07:40.440
We shouldn't be on YouTube right now, but we are definitely on peer tube and we are definitely on rumble.

07:40.440 --> 08:01.440
This is an independent bright web presentation and it is funded by viewers like you, unlike the PBS NewsHour, which is funded by large corporations and other weaponized piles of money that do not have our grandchildren's best interest in mind.

08:01.440 --> 08:07.440
They have enslavement of our grandchildren in mind.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.440
And so this is giggleembiological. It's a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by biologists.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.440
Noncompliance is the only way out as we move forward.

08:16.440 --> 08:23.440
We need to take back the United States, take back control of our local governments, our state governments and our federal government.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.440
And that's not going to be done easily. It's not going to happen overnight.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
I understand that.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.440
But the first thing to do, everybody has to wake up.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.440
We have to wake up to the fact, probably should have this in a different place.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.440
We are going to talk about biology today and the bigger picture of biology.

08:39.440 --> 09:02.440
But what we're really trying to talk about on giggleembiological is this conscious and intelligent manipulation of our organized habits and opinions and very specifically about health, well-being, mother nature, and what we have control over and what we should think of as being under our control.

09:03.440 --> 09:25.440
And so undermining our young people's understanding of what they have control over in their lives spans all aspects of our society to include socio-economic manipulation, to include manipulation based on race, but very few manipulations are based on class because that's really where the divide is.

09:26.440 --> 09:37.440
We are those people that are in this group and those people who are out, the vast majority of us being out, manipulated by this invisible force, this invisible intention.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.440
And this invisible intention has been there for quite some time.

09:40.440 --> 09:48.440
And for those people who are skilled television watchers and trusters of social media, this is kind of a slow baptism by fire.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.440
You're just going to have to face it.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.440
You were wrong about so many things because people lied to you about them.

09:54.440 --> 10:11.440
And so in trying to approach this from a biological perspective, I like to use this Chicago Tribune cartoon that I recently found in somebody's sub-stack where in 1934 already somebody's drawing a cartoon that says spend, spend, spend under the guise of recovery,

10:11.440 --> 10:20.440
recovery from a pandemic perhaps, bust the government, blame the capitalists, capitalists, you mean like people who wanted to make a profit from a pandemic,

10:21.440 --> 10:26.440
blame the capitalists for the failure, junk the constitution and declare a dictatorship.

10:29.440 --> 10:38.440
I think you should see this just like you should see the statement behind my head coming from Edward Bernays in 1924, this cartoon coming from 1934.

10:38.440 --> 10:51.440
I think you should see this very clearly has evidence of a multi-generational plan to eventually control the Polish-American at the same time enslave her citizens.

10:52.440 --> 11:07.440
That's what I see as a patriotic American who doesn't have any hyphens in my description of being American and knows very well that my informed consent was torn from me intellectually at the beginning of the pandemic.

11:07.440 --> 11:22.440
I fell for it, hook, line and sinker and I'm not sure who was wittingly or unwittingly participating in getting me to fall for it, but it was more than just myself bumbling through the darkness with a flashlight trying to figure out what was going on on my bicycle.

11:23.440 --> 11:33.440
This was a coordinated effort of people that were curating a narrative about a lab leak that would presuppose the existence of a spreading novel pathogen.

11:34.440 --> 11:47.440
The idea of a spreading novel pathogen for which none of us had any immunity was something that we were forced to coerced into accepting from the very beginning and that is at the root of this principle of informed consent being ignored.

11:47.440 --> 12:06.440
If they tell you a story and then try to motivate you with that story and the story is a lie or the story is a gross over exaggeration of anything that is possible, then they have effectively and they have effectively taken away your informed consent and that coercion amounts to a crime.

12:07.440 --> 12:24.440
That coercive use of government power amounts to a crime and we as American citizens need to wake up individual by individual and understand that and then take action and that will take several years for everybody to wake up to this reality.

12:25.440 --> 12:43.440
It will be the next president before we wake up to this reality. It's without a doubt, but what we can't do is allow this election coming up and the turmoil that will most assuredly be associated with it to throw us off of this tact, which is to pursue the truth of biology,

12:44.440 --> 12:55.440
pursue the truth right down to the stones, which is was there a pandemic and people are going to argue all the time about what do you mean by was was there a pandemic.

12:56.440 --> 13:01.440
And when I say there was no pandemic, I mean there was no pandemic, not that there was no viruses.

13:02.440 --> 13:08.440
I don't even care if there are or there aren't any viruses. There was no pandemic because RNA can't do that.

13:08.440 --> 13:19.440
And so then the question becomes if RNA can't do that, then what exactly happened and my argument is is that there is a hot background.

13:20.440 --> 13:36.440
A hot background of DNA and RNA that can be amplified through metagenomic sequencing can be amplified through any number of molecular biological methodologies that many, many people around the world have high levels of expertise in this book.

13:36.440 --> 14:05.440
The viral storm written by Nathan Wolf in 2011 basically details the idea that there is a whole black box source of DNA and RNA that could potentially be the source of new genes, new new living species that are only detectable by looking at this background signal of DNA.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.440
DNA and RNA and then pulling up and amplifying these signals and then searching through them with AI algorithms.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.440
Do you understand what I just said?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.440
Nathan Wolf.

14:22.440 --> 14:35.440
In 2012 was already selling the idea that metagenomic sequencing on the background in mother nature could pull up countless possible new lifetimes.

14:37.440 --> 14:50.440
And that the way to do it would be to look at this hot background and amplify it all and then allow an AI or a computer algorithm or something like that to sort through this noise and pull out signals.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.440
And so is there a hot background or no background?

14:59.440 --> 15:02.440
This is 14 years ago.

15:07.440 --> 15:22.440
And so our hypothesis is that the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus and then a coordinated rollout of this illusion of consensus that PCR was a good way to track this novel virus.

15:22.440 --> 15:27.440
Nobody disagreed with this idea, including the people who published the Korman-Drossden report.

15:28.440 --> 15:49.440
Kevin McCurnan and his authors that included Peter McCullough and Mike Yeiden and Claire Craig and Thomas Binder and what an unreal group of people to put on one of the first papers to have any real consequence in the pandemic story of February or March of 2020.

15:50.440 --> 15:59.440
Objecting to the who's PCR protocol is having primers that could cause primer dimers and inappropriate primer sequences.

16:01.440 --> 16:13.440
Absolutely nothing at all to do with objecting to using a PCR on a hot background on unproven amplicons with no positive controls, no triplicate, no negative controls, just running it.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.440
No objections about that.

16:16.440 --> 16:22.440
Rather, we would like to give you some methodological suggestions to make your PCR test better.

16:24.440 --> 16:28.440
Now I'm not saying all of those people therefore are in on it.

16:28.440 --> 16:34.440
What I am saying is that that paper is already an example of a highly dubious assembly of people.

16:35.440 --> 16:45.440
And so if we don't know who assembled those people or it ends up to be a Simahaltra known Medler on Twitter for four years.

16:46.440 --> 17:00.440
And then you have Kevin McCurnan from the human genome project that I guess was working on cannabis genomes but decided to throw that to the sideline at the start of the pandemic to make sure that he spoke out about primer dimers in the PCR test.

17:05.440 --> 17:13.440
And so this test comes out and people complain about it and say that their sequence, they're cycling it too far, otherwise this wouldn't be fair.

17:14.440 --> 17:23.440
And for biologists that work on the bench, for people that actually know how PCR works, cycling it farther and getting an amplicon, you could still sequence that amplicon.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.440
If it's the right amplicon, it just means that there was very little of it.

17:27.440 --> 17:36.440
And so when biologists heard this overcycling thing and then another biologist on TV said, no, you can't over cycle PCR PCR is perfect.

17:36.440 --> 17:42.440
Then the academic biologist said, yeah, yeah, it is what I use it. I guess it probably I mean, they must have done this.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
I mean, come on.

17:43.440 --> 17:48.440
This is just conspiracy theory that they would use PCR with a single amplicon.

17:49.440 --> 17:55.440
It's just it's just it's just conspiracy theory that they would use PCR with no nested primers.

17:55.440 --> 18:01.440
It's just conspiracy theory that they were looking at a conserved region of the end protein sometimes.

18:02.440 --> 18:15.440
And so these tests were all correlated because of financial incentive and because of one thing that I don't have listed here, his protection from malpractice in New York state.

18:15.440 --> 18:24.440
For the first two months of the pandemic, there was a declaration that during the course of treating COVID, there would be no medical malpractice at all.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
Did you know that?

18:26.440 --> 18:29.440
I wonder if Jessica Hockett knows that.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.440
It was something that Cuomo declared.

18:32.440 --> 18:37.440
And so doctors had actually multiple reasons to say, well, I think it's COVID.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.440
If you check the box COVID, you're off the hook.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.440
You can do whatever you want.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
Give them motor oil.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.440
It doesn't matter.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.440
If you're treating COVID, you got to do what you think is right.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.440
Or you could follow the CDC protocol and be totally protected.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.440
Plus, we'll get a bonus.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.440
So, you know, it's win-win.

18:56.440 --> 19:10.440
What this allowed them to do was convert a larger portion of all-cause mortality than what was normally designated as pneumonia and influenza as a national security priority.

19:10.440 --> 19:17.440
Suddenly, what killed people every year became worse because we decided to treat it differently.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.440
We treated it like a national security priority.

19:20.440 --> 19:30.440
We scared doctors into using a protocol that included supplemental oxygen in response to a pulse-ox reading.

19:30.440 --> 19:36.440
Devices that the FDA says itself are not very reliable.

19:36.440 --> 19:42.440
And terrified people into thinking that that was a primary indicator of impending COVID doom.

19:42.440 --> 19:46.440
People like Kyle Seidel and Pierre Corey.

19:46.440 --> 19:50.440
Sticking to that narrative.

19:50.440 --> 19:55.440
And if you give people Ivermectin, then they're really good.

19:55.440 --> 20:02.440
I bet Ivermectin is better than supplementary oxygen at 10 or more liters per minute when you don't need it.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.440
Or for hours.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.440
You should watch that show from Hucetonic as well.

20:10.440 --> 20:18.440
Mark also did a nice show about oxygen-induced ARDS in a study that was looking at oxygen use in ICUs.

20:18.440 --> 20:33.440
It's not surprising that we would already know this in some medical context or another that too much oxygen can damage lungs severely.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.440
There's a lot of medicine for everybody to know. There's a lot of specialties in medicine.

20:37.440 --> 20:49.440
So if you're an ER doctor, you might not know that because most of the time when people go to the ICU they leave the ER.

20:49.440 --> 20:55.440
And so it might seem normal if the CDC says give supplementary oxygen to people who come in before you give them ventilators.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.440
If you're out of ventilators, you have too many rooms or whatever, whatever, whatever.

20:59.440 --> 21:09.440
And so the symptoms of COVID almost certainly in any of these hospitals that were using this high-flow nasal cannula oxygen who were causing damage to these people,

21:09.440 --> 21:18.440
especially if they had comorbidities, especially if they were already smokers or had other some other problem.

21:18.440 --> 21:26.440
And they always say comorbidities, comorbidities, comorbidities, it's vulnerability to our protocol is what we're talking about here.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.440
Don't come to the hospital until you're vulnerable to our protocol was the command.

21:30.440 --> 21:40.440
Don't come to the hospital until your pulse ox is low enough for us to give an excuse to give you pure oxygen for a few hours,

21:40.440 --> 21:48.440
which we already knew in the late 80s could damage the lungs of monkeys in a few hours.

21:48.440 --> 21:57.440
And so if it wasn't necessary to create the permanent, beautiful illusion that something was circulating the globe,

21:57.440 --> 22:05.440
the easiest way for them to do it would be to use the standard methodology of RNA virology, which is to make an infectious clone,

22:05.440 --> 22:12.440
which is to take this RNA signal that they purport to have found in nature or purport to have made on their keyboard or purport to have added

22:12.440 --> 22:20.440
fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts to, and they make a DNA molecule that represents it and they grow lots of copies of that DNA molecule

22:20.440 --> 22:25.440
in any number of ways that are already standardized at the level of pharmaceutical companies.

22:25.440 --> 22:34.440
So you could literally make industrial quantities of that DNA copy of the RNA that you want to then produce using an industrial RNA polymerase.

22:34.440 --> 22:39.440
Now you have large quantities of an RNA and serendipitously large quantities of a DNA,

22:39.440 --> 22:47.440
both of which will provide adequate signal for an RTPCR test to be lightning bright positive.

22:47.440 --> 23:00.440
Put it in some sewers, put it in some subways, put it on some swabs. I don't know.

23:00.440 --> 23:05.440
It's a crime scene, ladies and gentlemen, and they've told us that it's just something that happened, something we couldn't have avoided,

23:05.440 --> 23:10.440
something we had to respond to and we responded to kind of awkwardly and clums will leave it.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.440
Next time we'll do it better. Trust us.

23:15.440 --> 23:20.440
This is a full inversion of your individual sovereignty to permissions around the world and around the globe.

23:20.440 --> 23:32.440
It is globalism. National borders are going to be dissolved in our lifetime if we do not fight for them.

23:32.440 --> 23:49.440
And the reason why you can know this, the best way to see it is to see how interestingly in agreement people that should be far apart, off it and these two, for example.

23:49.440 --> 23:58.440
But they're not far off at all. They both agree that vaccines have gotten us here and without vaccines, boy, would we be dead?

23:58.440 --> 24:06.440
And they both agree that there was a mystery virus that caused excess deaths around the world to the tune of millions.

24:06.440 --> 24:12.440
They also agree that there's no reason to talk about fear and uncertainty doubt and confusion killing anybody.

24:12.440 --> 24:23.440
There's definitely no reason to even come close to mentioning or whispering the possibility that pulse oximeters in and supplementary oxygen may have started the train for a lot of people.

24:23.440 --> 24:28.440
And a lot of doctors are going to be on the hook for this if it's written on a lot of people's deaths.

24:28.440 --> 24:33.440
I mean, people's medical records after their death.

24:33.440 --> 24:39.440
It's giant malpractice. It's nationwide. These people are in big trouble.

24:39.440 --> 24:51.440
We need whistleblowers, ladies and gentlemen. We need MDs that have the guts to look back on the last four years and say, Holy shit, did we do that?

24:51.440 --> 25:05.440
Were we doing that at my hospital? We need Mary Talley Bowden to look back at what they were doing at her hospital before she started her own practice and started treating people with Ivermectin.

25:05.440 --> 25:12.440
What were they doing at that hospital? Were they putting people on high flow nasal cannula oxygen before they got on the ventilator?

25:12.440 --> 25:19.440
How many people were given that as a standard treatment? How much oxygen were they using at those hospitals?

25:19.440 --> 25:26.440
Every single one of these MDs needs to look in the rear view mirror and go, wait, was that part of this too?

25:26.440 --> 25:31.440
And every one of the MDs that doesn't look back in the mirror and say, Holy shit, they're right.

25:31.440 --> 25:41.440
We were also doing that in a couple weeks. You're going to have to shake your head and say, Holy shit, they're really not saying it.

25:41.440 --> 25:50.440
And you're going to have to reach out to them on social media in a panic because this is gigantic.

25:50.440 --> 25:57.440
This is not a small thing. People still think that oxygen is just something that you can use to help people.

25:57.440 --> 26:04.440
There's a reason why oxygen bars never really caught on, ladies and gentlemen. And this is just the start, right?

26:04.440 --> 26:13.440
Because if you put somebody on high flow nasal oxygen and you give them, do not resuscitate orders as they're coming into the hospital.

26:13.440 --> 26:21.440
And you say, offer ventilation as a way of easing the pain that's being caused by the pure oxygen you've been breathing for the last three hours.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.440
And then when they do develop pneumonia from that oxygen, you don't give them antibiotics because it's viral.

26:26.440 --> 26:33.440
Of course, they came into the hospital with COVID. And then you don't use steroids to control the inflammation that results from it because, again,

26:33.440 --> 26:37.440
steroids aren't on the protocol. You use remdesivir, medazolam instead.

26:37.440 --> 26:43.440
And then you have these opioid deaths that are coming in and the hospital's like, yeah, but if we don't call them COVID deaths, we won't get 35,000.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.440
So we might as well just call them COVID deaths.

26:47.440 --> 26:57.440
We can call them opioid deaths at the end of the pandemic after in 2022, we can cop to those guys.

26:57.440 --> 27:05.440
And so financial incentives caused that to happen.

27:05.440 --> 27:14.440
Track and trace masks, closures, mandates, these things all made people believe that this illusion of consensus couldn't be wrong.

27:14.440 --> 27:24.440
All these people that are starting businesses with track and trace, all these people that are wearing masks that I see them wearing masks in the car, they can't all be wrong.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.440
Nobody would ever do this to us.

27:28.440 --> 27:36.440
I mean, we're closing schools. It's got to be pretty serious. They must really think something bad could happen.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.440
That's the effect of those things. It's not any other.

27:40.440 --> 27:50.440
And if they all agree on television and social media that these are great ideas, that is an illusion of consensus.

27:50.440 --> 28:01.440
And that illusion of consensus about a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from that likely was gained a function and therefore could come again is something that none of these people.

28:01.440 --> 28:08.440
Brett Weinstein doesn't question. Sam Harris doesn't question. Paul Offitt doesn't question Tony Fauci doesn't question.

28:08.440 --> 28:12.440
All of these people don't question it.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.440
Nick Hudson questions it.

28:16.440 --> 28:27.440
Jessica Hawke questions it. Mark Coolack questions it. Even the no virus people question it. They just did it in a very disingenuous way for a few years. At least some of them did.

28:27.440 --> 28:32.440
But it's all good now. Let's just make sure we're fighting for this justice.

28:32.440 --> 28:48.440
The hundreds of thousands of people that were killed in America and misconstrued as the damage that a novel virus called caused when we know that that's not the case that's a bald face lie.

28:48.440 --> 29:06.440
And the only people that are actively maintaining this faith in a novel virus are people that have been connected to this to this illusion for decades if you are connected to the human genome project was a giant bluff.

29:06.440 --> 29:20.440
If you made hundreds of millions of dollars from patents from the human genome project that were kind of just given to you out of your work at the Whitehead Institute, you can't be trusted to speak out against this if you don't mention anybody on this list.

29:20.440 --> 29:27.440
If none of the justice for these people is a priority for you. You can't be trusted.

29:27.440 --> 29:41.440
If you've given presentations in front of the who about fit and fill and finish technologies in the flu vaccine, you can't be trusted to speak up about this, especially if you don't say any of this stuff.

29:41.440 --> 29:59.440
And every single person, almost to the letter that stood in front of the Senate in that picture that stood in front of the stage in Romania in November of 2023 doesn't say any of this stuff.

29:59.440 --> 30:12.440
And then he ran course very focused on all cause mortality and analyzing all cause mortality and so his data doesn't speak to any of this.

30:12.440 --> 30:16.440
But common sense does.

30:16.440 --> 30:23.440
Common sense speaks to the fact you can put that microphone inside and you can close the door all the way if you want.

30:23.440 --> 30:37.440
Common sense speaks to the fact that speaks to the fact that they have to talk about this and if they don't talk about this, then there's a problem.

30:37.440 --> 30:41.440
Common sense speaks to the fact that they should talk about Medicare costs being avoided.

30:41.440 --> 30:50.440
Common sense speaks to the fact that they should some lawyer somewhere should be making a good living talking about how strict liability is the only way out.

30:50.440 --> 31:09.440
Some lawyers somewhere should be making a good living, bringing cases against the vaccine injury, something, something court, because it's a Seventh Amendment violation, because there should be a nonprofit that's fighting those two exact things.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
And there isn't.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
There isn't.

31:12.440 --> 31:16.440
Which one?

31:16.440 --> 31:22.440
And so, Denny Rancore can say there's no evidence of epidemiological evidence of spread.

31:22.440 --> 31:34.440
Jessica Hockett can show pictures of us, the spike of deaths in New York City, the absolutely implausible 20,000 people dying in three and a half weeks. Where are the bodies?

31:34.440 --> 31:44.440
The bodies were piling ups outside of the churches in World War II, you know, by like 25 or 30 bodies.

31:44.440 --> 31:48.440
Where did 20,000 bodies go?

31:48.440 --> 31:59.440
That's like a major league baseball game. Oh, everybody's dead. Well, we got to get those people out of there. How the hell are we going to do that? Where are we going to put them? How?

31:59.440 --> 32:05.440
What are their names? Where's the memorial?

32:05.440 --> 32:11.440
Listen carefully, ladies and gentlemen, what about those Medicare costs? This is what the first thing I wanted to cover here.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.440
What about those Medicare costs here that we're looking at? Whoops, this one.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.440
What about those Medicare costs?

32:16.440 --> 32:23.440
This is a video from 11 years ago, a PBS NewsHour video from 11 years ago.

32:23.440 --> 32:36.440
I just want you to do a little mental gymnastics in your head. How much of the total budget of America is the cost of paying the medical bills of poor people, mostly old and retired people.

32:36.440 --> 32:40.440
What do you think it is?

32:40.440 --> 32:55.440
Mostly, but the ones that are old and retired are the very expensive ones. The unhealthy ones are very expensive. What do you think it costs? What percentage of the U.S. budget? Somebody in the chat.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
What's going on? Play.

32:57.440 --> 33:10.440
Between Medicaid and Medicare, it seems like Medicare gets so much more attention, particularly as they campaign in Florida, and they're talking to those older voters that do participate rather than voters who maybe need more financial help on healthcare.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.440
That's something we've taken quite a bit of a look at on the NewsHour.

33:13.440 --> 33:20.440
Another question is how much does Medicaid cost taxpayers every year? What percentage in the national budget is this taking out?

33:20.440 --> 33:33.440
Roughly about 10 percent. Medicaid is about $340 billion, so it's about 10 percent of the whole national budget. As again, I've mentioned in states, for state spending, it can be a quarter of your budget.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.440
So when states are struggling, as they have been during the damage...

33:36.440 --> 33:52.440
Oh, so did you know that? That it's only about 10 to 15 percent of the national budget, but it's up to 25 to 30, even 40 percent of some state's budgets that we know already are underwater because they've been mismanaged for many years.

33:52.440 --> 33:58.440
We've known that was also one of these ticking time bombs, so ladies and gentlemen, a decade ago already.

33:59.440 --> 34:09.440
A decade ago, Medicare was already a very looming doom for state budgets and potentially for national budgets as the boomers became older.

34:09.440 --> 34:19.440
Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that one of the things that America is dealing with right now, as we speak, is this population pyramid.

34:19.440 --> 34:27.440
Now remember, you can draw a population pyramid in a number of ways, but usually it's drawn like this where you might put the females on one side.

34:27.440 --> 34:37.440
You might put the males on the other, and then on this axis here, you have age, here's maybe 80, here is zero, and so you got lots of babies that are born down here.

34:37.440 --> 34:43.440
And then as you go up the ladder, you know, you got different bars.

34:43.440 --> 34:47.440
And so this is the total population curve.

34:47.440 --> 34:55.440
And what we know from what limited public data is available, the United States curve does not look like that.

34:55.440 --> 35:01.440
The United States curve, in fact, is looking pretty straight with this little thing right there.

35:03.440 --> 35:10.440
And now I'm drawing it very poorly, but this thing right there is like at 80.

35:11.440 --> 35:23.440
This big bump of the boomers, there's a lot of these people that are just retired retiring, but just retired have been retired for a few years.

35:23.440 --> 35:28.440
This is not exactly drawn right. Maybe 80 should have been right here.

35:29.440 --> 35:53.440
And that means that there was something really to be saved because at one point in time, over 10 years ago, there was a report where there was a report where you had people talking about how in 10 years or in 15 years when these old people retired and when they started to actually

35:54.440 --> 36:07.440
on their Medicare, that their costs in the last months of their lives, the costs of their Medicare were somewhere on the orders of $500,000 for every six months.

36:07.440 --> 36:20.440
And so you can imagine a scenario where this was actually as it climbed over time as this climbed up the population pyramid, they knew that this was going to be a problem.

36:21.440 --> 36:34.440
It would also be incidentally, incidentally, it would also be a source of excess death because more people are going to die as that bump of old people, right?

36:35.440 --> 36:42.440
As this bump of old people here, this bump goes up to the age of death, you're just going to have more people dying.

36:42.440 --> 36:57.440
And so the number of people dying would have been expected to rise, but any disingenuous manipulation or presentation of those numbers could have been used in order to say that all those old people weren't expected to die.

36:58.440 --> 37:13.440
But of course they were because they expect the age of the average age of death, even with all of these games was still above the expected lifespan of the average American above the average lifespan of the average Irish person.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.440
And that was true pretty much around Western society.

37:19.440 --> 37:25.440
And so it's very, very important to see that there were a number of reasons why this would be happening.

37:25.440 --> 37:39.440
And coincidentally, the guy who does last week tonight now, what is the name John Oliver just did an episode about how at the same time we're kicking people off of Medicare at random now because of budget cuts and this kind of thing.

37:40.440 --> 37:51.440
So this was a necessity getting control of the old population, increasing the vaccination of old people before the pandemic.

37:52.440 --> 38:00.440
Was anybody talking about the need for pneumonia vaccines or RSV vaccines or flu and COVID vaccines every year for old people?

38:01.440 --> 38:07.440
Not with the fervor and commitment that they are now where it's just suddenly like, well, long as this stuff works.

38:07.440 --> 38:12.440
He might as well, he might as well get vaccinated for shingles too.

38:14.440 --> 38:35.440
I am particularly stuck on shingles because my friend at the at the gym told me about a shingle shot that was making his arm hurt and it just it hurt me to hear that that's where we are that somebody who should be retired or is kind of semi retired trying to make ends meet by teaching basketball

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
to young kids.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.440
He's been a coach at like 10 different colleges.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.440
It's really crazy guy that I met there.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.440
Really nice dude.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
But totally lost in this.

38:45.440 --> 39:04.440
Totally lost in the idea that this is a legitimate system of public health that has our best interest in mind when it definitely doesn't and more importantly that his doctor somehow is a useful and functioning part of that system which he or she probably is just a part of it

39:04.440 --> 39:14.440
and not at all thinking about what they do just assuming because otherwise of course all these people must be liars then that can't be true.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.440
I'm going to go past that of course.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.440
So I am human just like you.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.440
I'm going to make mistakes as we go forward but I'm not going to hate.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.440
I'm not going to fight.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.440
I'm not going to take their bait anymore.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.440
We are just going to keep telling the truth.

39:30.440 --> 39:39.440
And in telling the truth one of the things that we need to do is speak and listen to people tell the truth themselves.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.440
And the illusion is very very deep.

39:42.440 --> 39:52.440
Where I'm going to go now is Spotify because I do have Spotify for my kids because and it does allow me to listen to something so I do have an account at Spotify.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.440
And I've already downloaded this.

39:54.440 --> 39:59.440
What I wanted to do was look into Alex Berenson.

39:59.440 --> 40:10.440
And the reason why I want to look into Alex Berenson is because I believe Alex Berenson is one of these really wonderful examples of somebody I'm just going to cut quick over here.

40:11.440 --> 40:17.440
One of these wonderful examples of I don't know if I actually said hello to you over here yet.

40:18.440 --> 40:24.440
This is Giga on biological and high resistance Illinois information brief brought to you by a biologist coming to you live from Pittsburgh.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.440
This is the back of my garage here in my backyard.

40:29.440 --> 40:35.440
I think Alex Berenson is a wonderful example of the fake censorship that occurred.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
So some people are censored.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
Some people are muted.

40:39.440 --> 40:46.440
Some people were canceled but didn't get invitations to go to other platforms

40:46.440 --> 40:47.440
and be a leader over there.

40:47.440 --> 41:06.440
Didn't get invitations to go complain about the censorship to Tucker Carlson and definitely didn't get an invitation and the ability to sue something like Twitter for money and elaborately showcase the censorship that they experienced.

41:06.440 --> 41:14.440
And I think Alex Berenson is one of these people that probably is not smart enough to know how he's being played.

41:14.440 --> 41:21.440
But he is smart enough to know that he is being protected because of what he says.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.440
And he might believe most of the things that he says.

41:25.440 --> 41:34.440
But man, when we listen to him and Joe Rogan talk in this podcast, they're going to say some things that are just flat out shocking.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
We won't listen to the whole thing.

41:36.440 --> 41:44.440
But I really want people to understand the depth and the breadth of this illusion because I know everybody says, yeah, of course Joe Rogan is in on it or whatever.

41:44.440 --> 41:51.440
But Joe Rogan is just a guy who's been given a lot of comfort and fame and is not going to do anything to jeopardize it.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.440
They leave him alone.

41:52.440 --> 41:57.440
He's able to do his drugs and get his testosterone and all this other stuff.

41:57.440 --> 42:01.440
And he gets to watch fights and he gets to do everything that he wants to do.

42:01.440 --> 42:09.440
So he's not going to question it if they need to talk to somebody or you need to promote someone or we need you to say this, he's just going to do it.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.440
Because the people that tell him, he trusts them.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.440
I'm not saying that Joe is forgivable.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.440
I'm saying that he's just a tool of the system.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.440
Joe could easily be a robot.

42:20.440 --> 42:28.440
I mean, I don't think that he's anybody that will ever turn, for example.

42:28.440 --> 42:32.440
He probably believes in most of the things that these people are up to.

42:32.440 --> 42:37.440
He probably believes that the vast majority of Americans shouldn't be having kids and that we should do something about that.

42:37.440 --> 42:44.440
He probably believes that, you know, not every human is as sacred as every other human and not equal.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.440
And therefore, you know, survival of the fittest, this kind of thing.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.440
I'm not saying I agree or disagree.

42:50.440 --> 43:07.440
I'm just saying that if you're on board with those kinds of ideas and on board with those ideas means that Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein and Peter Teal and Bill Gates and his dad and all these people agree that this is the way humans should be governed that, you know, we just

43:08.440 --> 43:10.440
Mark just did a show about Salk.

43:10.440 --> 43:21.440
And Salk wrote this book called the survival of the wisest that actually argues that if humans are going to take advantage of their full potential, we better pull our head out of our ass and start breeding more intelligently.

43:21.440 --> 43:32.440
And that may mean that the wisest breed, the smartest breed, and that we make choices based on that because we understand that that's how the system works.

43:32.440 --> 43:36.440
And so there's no excuse not to use that to our advantage as a species.

43:36.440 --> 43:41.440
And if you believe it that way, if you argue it that way, then eugenics is just good.

43:41.440 --> 43:49.440
Eugenics makes sense because we're the only species that can actively engage in it.

43:49.440 --> 44:06.440
So it's extremely poignant that Mark shows that during the, you know, the lead up to the Salk Institute and its establishment that this man met with Alice E. Moore, the house cleaner of Henry Kissinger.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.440
Very interesting story.

44:08.440 --> 44:21.440
And I hope you know that I'm joking when I say that she was the house cleaner of Henry Kissinger. She did have a house in the same places and towns and neighborhoods as Henry Kissinger in all the places that Henry had a house.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.440
But she's the cell culture master.

44:24.440 --> 44:34.440
She is essentially the red thread that runs through all of the early cell culture work, all the early cancer cell lines, all this stuff has her behind it.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.440
These culture techniques are her.

44:36.440 --> 44:47.440
And so she is a really interesting missing piece to the puzzle, of course, because she has no Wikipedia page. Nobody ever talks to her. There are no institutes named after her, but everybody's connected to her.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.440
Well done, Mark.

44:52.440 --> 44:57.440
So let's listen to Alex Berenson bust it because that's what he's going to do. He's going to bust it.

44:57.440 --> 45:01.440
I don't know if I get a video here or what the deal is.

45:01.440 --> 45:06.440
Sometimes I get a video. Sometimes I don't. It's really weird.

45:06.440 --> 45:10.440
Do you know how that works? Why I don't see a video?

45:10.440 --> 45:13.440
Where's the video? Play.

45:14.440 --> 45:20.440
No, this, this bat. We want everyone, we want to signal to everyone else.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.440
Sorry about that.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
I don't know why I don't see that.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.440
Rogan, experience.

45:25.440 --> 45:29.440
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.440
Is that it?

45:32.440 --> 45:34.440
Good to see you.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.440
It's a pleasure.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.440
How are you feeling out there? You, you truth warrior.

45:39.440 --> 45:44.440
I keep waiting to be done with this.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.440
Yeah.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.440
Nice. Why isn't it showing up?

45:47.440 --> 45:48.440
Let it go.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.440
Yeah, it's strange. It's strange now.

45:51.440 --> 45:56.440
Does anybody know how that works? Sorry. How do we do that?

45:56.440 --> 46:01.440
How come I can't see it? Because there is a video.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.440
What the hell?

46:07.440 --> 46:12.440
Somebody help me. What's going on? Why can't I see the video?

46:12.440 --> 46:15.440
I know there's a video.

46:15.440 --> 46:20.440
Truth warrior. Yeah, he's not a truth warrior. I know that.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.440
See all episodes.

46:24.440 --> 46:28.440
Then maybe I'll get it. Alex Berenson.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.440
I'll search.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.440
Newest to oldest.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
Oh, come on. I don't want to waste this time.

46:39.440 --> 46:43.440
I thought I had it ready. And now it won't show it.

46:44.440 --> 46:48.440
Might be the download setting. No, I don't think so.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.440
Remove from your episodes mark as played.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.440
Darn it.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.440
Darn it.

47:01.440 --> 47:10.440
I'm going to look for it on YouTube then.

47:10.440 --> 47:14.440
It's a pleasure. How are you feeling out there? You truth warrior.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.440
I keep waiting to be done with this.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.440
Yeah.

47:20.440 --> 47:23.440
It's nice to be done, right? They will not let it go.

47:23.440 --> 47:28.440
Yeah, it's strange. It's strange now.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.440
It's also strange what bothers me.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.440
I try to emphasize this as much as possible.

47:34.440 --> 47:37.440
I even had to do this recently with some close family friends.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.440
You've got to take care of your health.

47:39.440 --> 47:42.440
You have to take vitamins. You have to eat right.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.440
You have to. If you don't do that, your body doesn't function well.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.440
That includes your immune system. It includes everything.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.440
It includes inflammation.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.440
It causes a host of diseases in your body.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.440
You have to take care of yourself.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.440
That should be the most important message that everyone's putting out,

47:57.440 --> 48:00.440
not just the podcasters, but the government.

48:00.440 --> 48:02.440
Health officials. Everyone should be saying that.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.440
You should really supplement with vitamins.

48:04.440 --> 48:08.440
You should really get your nutrient levels checked, if you can.

48:08.440 --> 48:11.440
Even if you can't do those things, you can eat decently.

48:11.440 --> 48:14.440
You can try to exercise moderately.

48:14.440 --> 48:16.440
Look, I know a lot of people have...

48:16.440 --> 48:19.440
Okay, maybe this is going to work.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.440
I'm going to get rid of this for a second and see if this works.

48:22.440 --> 48:25.440
Somebody put a link in the thingy-bob.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.440
It's just going to...

48:32.440 --> 48:34.440
The Joe Rogan Experience.

48:34.440 --> 48:38.440
Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night! All day!

48:38.440 --> 48:41.440
It won't go wide though.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.440
Did you see? It's a pleasure.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.440
How are you feeling out there? You truth warrior?

48:47.440 --> 48:49.440
Maybe I do this.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.440
I keep waiting to be done with this.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.440
Be nice to be done, right?

48:54.440 --> 48:56.440
They will not let it go.

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440
Yeah, it's strange.

48:58.440 --> 49:00.440
No, it won't show up there.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.440
It's also strange. What bothers me,

49:03.440 --> 49:06.440
and I try to emphasize this as much as possible,

49:06.440 --> 49:10.440
and I even had to do this recently with some close family friends.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.440
You've got to take care of your health.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.440
You have to take vitamins. You have to eat right.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.440
You have to. If you don't do that, your body doesn't function well.

49:17.440 --> 49:19.440
That includes your immune system.

49:19.440 --> 49:24.440
It includes inflammation. It causes a host of diseases in your body.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.440
You've got to take care of yourself.

49:26.440 --> 49:30.440
That should be the most important message that everyone's putting out,

49:30.440 --> 49:33.440
not just the podcasters, but the government.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
Health officials. Everyone should be saying that.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
You should really supplement with vitamins.

49:37.440 --> 49:41.440
You should really get your nutrient levels checked, if you can.

49:41.440 --> 49:44.440
Even if you can't do those things, you can eat decently.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.440
You can try to exercise moderately.

49:46.440 --> 49:49.440
Look, I know a lot of people have complicated lives.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.440
They have kids.

49:50.440 --> 49:53.440
Oh, this is going to be only a short episode.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.440
I get it.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.440
But even if you can work out like a half hour a day,

49:57.440 --> 50:00.440
three days a week and not eat too much, you're in better shape.

50:00.440 --> 50:01.440
Much better shape.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
Yeah, there's been some studies done recently.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
Darn it.

50:04.440 --> 50:06.440
Okay, so we're going to have to go to Spotify.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.440
20 minutes of exercise, like twice a week,

50:09.440 --> 50:13.440
improves your overall, like, all-cause mortality score.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.440
Yes.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.440
Just a little bit moderate stuff.

50:16.440 --> 50:19.440
Okay, I'm sorry that I'm being so clumsy with this,

50:19.440 --> 50:21.440
but I really thought I had the video.

50:21.440 --> 50:25.440
And if I don't, which is very possible,

50:25.440 --> 50:26.440
you know, they don't have much time.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
I get it.

50:27.440 --> 50:31.440
But like, even if you can work out like a half hour a day,

50:31.440 --> 50:34.440
three days a week and not eat too much, you're in better shape.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.440
Much better shape.

50:35.440 --> 50:38.440
Yeah, there's been some studies done recently that something really crazy,

50:38.440 --> 50:42.440
like 20 minutes of exercise, like twice a week,

50:42.440 --> 50:46.440
improves your overall, like, all-cause mortality score.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.440
Yes.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.440
Just a little bit moderate stuff.

50:50.440 --> 50:51.440
Nothing crazy.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.440
Like do some push-ups and sit-ups and some jumping jacks,

50:53.440 --> 50:54.440
and you're good to go.

50:54.440 --> 50:57.440
Just you have to do something that gets your body moving.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.440
Or it doesn't think that it has to,

50:59.440 --> 51:00.440
but it atrophies.

51:00.440 --> 51:05.440
It's just an unfortunate aspect of our biology

51:05.440 --> 51:07.440
that we are not like other animals.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.440
You know, like, and other animals get stronger too, is the exercise.

51:10.440 --> 51:13.440
But we've all seen animals that are like super muscular

51:13.440 --> 51:14.440
that don't do anything.

51:14.440 --> 51:16.440
It's just that they're different, you know,

51:16.440 --> 51:18.440
and they only lived 13 years, right?

51:18.440 --> 51:19.440
Yes.

51:19.440 --> 51:20.440
The whole thing's different.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
Yes.

51:21.440 --> 51:26.440
With us, we're this long-term species with intelligence and ego

51:26.440 --> 51:32.440
and justifications and all sorts of weird ways that we will procrastinate

51:32.440 --> 51:36.440
and justify bad behavior and unhealthy choices,

51:36.440 --> 51:39.440
and it's just a constant battle just being a human being.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.440
And no one wins that battle.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.440
You just win battles.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.440
Yes.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.440
You win, like, daily battle.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.440
No one wins the war.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
Everyone dies in the end.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
Everyone dies in the end.

51:48.440 --> 51:49.440
But I do.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
You know, I wrote about this on a substrate.

51:51.440 --> 51:54.440
You know, we were just talking before we started about

51:54.440 --> 51:56.440
when I didn't see you.

51:56.440 --> 51:59.440
But when you were in Vegas in July and I was in Vegas in July

51:59.440 --> 52:02.440
for I was playing poker, that like, you know, gambling is...

52:02.440 --> 52:03.440
And I'd like to gamble.

52:03.440 --> 52:07.440
I don't have a moral problem with it, but gambling destroys people too.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.440
Over eating destroys people, gambling destroys people.

52:09.440 --> 52:10.440
Gambling destroys people.

52:10.440 --> 52:15.440
As human beings, we've set up all these, like, modern things

52:15.440 --> 52:19.440
to take advantage of our dopamine, and we're not really built for it.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.440
We're not.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.440
And we're certainly not built for phones.

52:22.440 --> 52:25.440
You know, so many people are getting destroyed by social media.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.440
Like, their lives have become wrapped up in arguing with people.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.440
And I just think that's super unhealthy.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.440
Yes.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.440
There's some aspect of it that's very beneficial and positive.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.440
I think you get a lot of information that you wouldn't have gotten.

52:36.440 --> 52:39.440
I think you get to see people's perspectives

52:39.440 --> 52:43.440
that occasionally are very inspiring and very unique and interesting.

52:43.440 --> 52:47.440
I love listening or reading things from other people

52:47.440 --> 52:51.440
that I think have very good perspectives and interesting perspectives.

52:51.440 --> 52:55.440
It's a rare opportunity to talk to people that you wouldn't be able to run into.

52:55.440 --> 52:59.440
If we lived in the 1970s, you'd have to cultivate these interesting people,

52:59.440 --> 53:03.440
like in the physical person, which is probably better for you, right?

53:03.440 --> 53:05.440
But not available for most people.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.440
That's right.

53:06.440 --> 53:08.440
And we tend to imitate our atmospheres.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.440
And you see that in thought bubbles.

53:10.440 --> 53:13.440
And I think that's another problem that we have with social media.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
And there's these thought bubbles.

53:15.440 --> 53:19.440
And people just, you know, you sort of gravitate towards them.

53:19.440 --> 53:20.440
You stay in them.

53:20.440 --> 53:24.440
And if you're busy, you just sort of get affirmation from that thought bubble

53:24.440 --> 53:26.440
and you never think outside the box.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.440
Yes.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.440
Look, I don't know what we do about social media.

53:31.440 --> 53:35.440
I mean, obviously my career, I wouldn't, well, I guess I was on with you one time

53:35.440 --> 53:38.440
before COVID, you know, talk about cannabis.

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
But before you got kicked off.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.440
Before I got kicked off Twitter.

53:41.440 --> 53:42.440
That's right.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.440
And then got put back.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.440
Let's talk about that.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.440
Because you came on for your book that I've referenced many times.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.440
Here you go.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.440
So he came on.

53:48.440 --> 53:52.440
Joe Rogan for his book about cannabis and how cannabis is terrible for kids

53:52.440 --> 53:54.440
or something like terrible for everybody.

53:54.440 --> 53:55.440
I don't know what it was.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.440
I'll tell your children.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.440
And I think it's, I think it's important.

53:58.440 --> 54:03.440
I think when we talk about these things that some people like to use

54:03.440 --> 54:08.440
recreationally, like even gambling that you talked about, we have to be aware

54:08.440 --> 54:12.440
that there's consequences to these things too.

54:12.440 --> 54:13.440
It's not an even ride.

54:13.440 --> 54:17.440
It's not like every person is going to handle every situation well.

54:17.440 --> 54:21.440
And we had a podcast yesterday with Kurt Angle, you know, an Olympic gold

54:21.440 --> 54:24.440
medalist and wrestling and he was the WWE champion.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
Amazing guy.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
And he had a real pill problem.

54:27.440 --> 54:30.440
And he had a pill problem because he broke his neck like five times.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.440
And he had like crazy wrestled in the Olympics with a broken neck.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.440
Broken vertebrae in his neck and one.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.440
Wow.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.440
I mean, just the freak of freaks.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.440
So he can do that.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.440
But he got hooked.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.440
He got hooked.

54:44.440 --> 54:48.440
I mean, this is like a man whose mind is as strong as any fucking human

54:48.440 --> 54:50.440
as ever walked the face of the earth.

54:50.440 --> 54:53.440
You can win the gold medal in the Olympics in wrestling.

54:53.440 --> 54:58.440
Wrestling is one of the most competitive grueling, insane physical

54:58.440 --> 55:01.440
contests that are in the Olympics.

55:01.440 --> 55:04.440
It's like boxing and wrestling are two of the craziest.

55:04.440 --> 55:06.440
Judo Judo is pretty crazy.

55:06.440 --> 55:09.440
But God, those guys are strong mentally.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
And for that guy to get hooked on pills.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.440
Like God like that, imagine.

55:13.440 --> 55:14.440
Right.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.440
Because it's not about how strong you are.

55:16.440 --> 55:21.440
It's just if they click with you in some way, you're going to have a problem.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
And I also had Peter Berg on the podcast.

55:23.440 --> 55:24.440
He was brilliant.

55:24.440 --> 55:27.440
And Peter, who did that film before Netflix.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.440
The series is now Painkiller.

55:29.440 --> 55:33.440
He said he tried an OxyContin once recreationally.

55:33.440 --> 55:35.440
And he was like, oh, my God.

55:35.440 --> 55:36.440
This is amazing.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
I could never do this again.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
I'll never do this again.

55:39.440 --> 55:44.440
But he's got a mindset that can see that and go, oh, I see where this is going.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
Right.

55:46.440 --> 55:49.440
So the look, there's always been this stuff.

55:49.440 --> 55:55.440
And the legalizers, whether it's drug legalizers or people who want more gambling, they always

55:55.440 --> 55:56.440
say the same thing.

55:56.440 --> 55:59.440
Well, you can't really stop people from doing it.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
And so you got to make it safe for them.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.440
Here's the problem with that.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.440
Here's the flip side of that.

56:06.440 --> 56:11.440
When you legalize it or normalize it, you wind up opening it to people who otherwise wouldn't

56:11.440 --> 56:12.440
do it.

56:13.440 --> 56:16.440
Let me go back to gambling because I think it's a little bit less emotionally charged

56:16.440 --> 56:17.440
for people.

56:17.440 --> 56:21.440
Once upon a time, if you wanted to gamble legally, you had to go to Las Vegas, basically.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.440
Or maybe Atlantic City after, you know, in 1978.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.440
But basically you had to go out to the desert and find that gambling.

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
And yeah, maybe.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.440
And deal with the mob.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.440
And deal with the mob.

56:29.440 --> 56:30.440
That's right.

56:30.440 --> 56:33.440
Or if you wanted to, no, no, if you wanted to bet football, like you could probably find

56:33.440 --> 56:34.440
a bookie.

56:34.440 --> 56:37.440
You could call a friend who called a friend and you could, but you know, it was going to

56:37.440 --> 56:39.440
be some guy who might break your arm if you didn't pay.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.440
Right.

56:40.440 --> 56:43.440
So you could do it, but it was discouraged and not that easy.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.440
Right.

56:44.440 --> 56:48.440
Now we have gambling in like, you know, 23 states.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.440
We have lotteries on every corner.

56:50.440 --> 56:56.440
And just in the last five years, we have sports betting on your phone in many states.

56:56.440 --> 56:58.440
So it couldn't be easier.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.440
So what does that mean?

56:59.440 --> 57:03.440
It means it's going to wreck people who would never, it would never have been available

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
to before.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
And that, that.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
So.

57:06.440 --> 57:07.440
That's just a function of freedom.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.440
Right.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.040
Well, it's a, okay, freedom would be go to Vegas and do it.

57:12.040 --> 57:15.040
And we're not going to really judge you for it, but you got to go get it.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.640
So this is less accessible.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
That's right.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.640
This is more.

57:18.640 --> 57:22.160
We're going to promote this because, because both private interests and the state, state

57:22.160 --> 57:24.160
governments make money from it.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.160
Right.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.160
Well, you could see it from their perspective too.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.280
They're like, why, why should we give the revenue to Vegas we can handle it here?

57:29.280 --> 57:30.280
Right.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.000
Our residents should be able to gamble here.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.880
And what do you, there's a percentage, whatever that percentage is.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.480
So that's an interesting statement to make there.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.480
Right.

57:38.480 --> 57:39.480
I can't do that.

57:39.480 --> 57:40.480
Okay.

57:40.480 --> 57:46.760
So I'm going to put myself down here that he says it's a function of freedom.

57:46.760 --> 57:50.960
And Alex says, yeah, yeah, you know, whatever, we should make it safe for people.

57:50.960 --> 57:51.960
But who's freedom?

57:51.960 --> 57:52.960
Is he talking about it?

57:52.960 --> 57:57.520
Is it freedom of corporations to exploit the population, freedom of the government to

57:57.520 --> 58:05.320
exploit and tax the population, freedom of, of all of these owners to exploit us.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.960
And they don't talk about that at all.

58:06.960 --> 58:11.040
This is freedom of people to hurt themselves.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.040
That's what they're talking about.

58:12.040 --> 58:14.160
Well, you know, some people are addictive.

58:14.160 --> 58:17.680
Some people, you know, they're vulnerable to it or it really clicks with them.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.480
They really like those drugs.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.920
You see how it is right now?

58:22.920 --> 58:30.520
This controlled limited spectrum of debate where the onus is on people to, to fend off

58:30.520 --> 58:36.520
the, the predatory corporations, the corporations that lie to them in cooperation with the government,

58:36.520 --> 58:39.200
they're supposed to, they're supposed to be able to resist that.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.000
That's their fault.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.920
Because you know, he just told a, a story of a guy who took a Oxycontin and said, wow,

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
that was great.

58:46.920 --> 58:50.240
I'm never going to take another one of those.

58:50.240 --> 58:55.640
Don't you hear what they're implying here that it's our fault that we're here.

58:55.640 --> 58:58.680
It's our fault that our country is like this.

58:58.680 --> 59:03.360
It's our fault that all these corporations are taking advantage of us in our health care

59:03.360 --> 59:04.360
system.

59:04.360 --> 59:13.000
It's our fault.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.800
I don't know if it's genetic or if it's based on personal experience in gambling that

59:17.800 --> 59:22.040
like maybe it's like Oxycontin, like Peter Burke took one, but if he took like as many

59:22.040 --> 59:25.200
as Kurt Engle did, he would be physically hooked too.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.720
Maybe there could be just you chasing bad money a couple of times.

59:29.720 --> 59:33.240
And next thing you know, you're doing it all the time.

59:33.240 --> 59:38.840
I mean, you, you see it, okay, you see the people who can't stop, who know, who know

59:38.840 --> 59:42.000
they don't have this money, who know they're going to the credit card advance machine for

59:42.000 --> 59:45.320
the fifth time, you know, that weekend, they can't stop.

59:45.320 --> 59:49.920
So how do we balance that with the freedom to be able to do it?

59:49.920 --> 59:52.800
Like how do we say that it has to be regional?

59:52.800 --> 59:55.560
Like how do we say that you can go to Vegas?

59:55.560 --> 59:58.560
It's totally legal, but you can't gamble in Michigan.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.560
That's a fair question.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.080
I don't, I don't have a good answer to that.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:10.280
So is the solution that we just if you don't call it evil, then what if you don't call

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.320
it wrong, if you don't just call it predatory, but you want it to be legal, but make sure

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.600
that the only the people who can afford to have their lives ruined by it, only the people

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600
that can afford the cocaine should get it.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.160
What are you talking about?

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:33.720
Have to have more people available for counseling and more rehabilitation centers.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720
Is that the solution?

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.240
I don't really think that stuff works very well to me.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240
Here's what I do think.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.440
Putting it on people's phones is a mistake.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.920
I think putting it in every...

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.560
You don't think gambling rehabilitation works or any rehabilitation works?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.640
I don't think rehabilitation works as a rule.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.800
I think when people want to stop, they stop.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.520
But you don't think that support for one of human beings that have also gone through it?

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.760
When people want to stop, they stop.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.200
That's how addiction works.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.680
Boy, what a moron is this guy, but he's already written a book about it, so he must know it

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.080
could be beneficial in making good decisions in the future.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:12.360
I think if this episode is brought to you by True Classic, as guys shopping for premium

It improves your overall, like, all-cause mortality score.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040
Hey, yes.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.040
We got it.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.040
A little bit.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.040
Moderate stuff.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.040
Nothing crazy.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.040
Do some push-ups and sit-ups and some jumping jacks, and you're good to go.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.320
You have to do something that gets your body moving, or it doesn't think that it has to,

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.680
then it atrophies.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.160
It's just an unfortunate aspect of our biology.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.160
Here we go.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.160
We are not like other animals.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160
Yes.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160
You don't.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.920
And other animals get stronger, too, is the exercise.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.440
We've all seen animals that are super muscular, that don't do anything.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.120
It's just, they're different.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.880
And they only live 13 years, right?

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.880
Yes.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.880
The whole thing's different.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.880
Yes.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.120
With us, we're this long-term species with intelligence and ego and justifications,

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:22.040
and all sorts of weird ways that we will procrastinate and justify bad behavior, and

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040
how much time it is.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
Did I go back in time?

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.520
And it's such a constant battle, just being keen.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520
I think I did.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.040
No one wins that battle.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040
I think I was bad in time.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040
You just win battles.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.040
Yes.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040
Should I?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040
I think this.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040
Everyone dies in the end.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.760
Everyone dies in the end.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.760
But I do.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.400
You know, I wrote about this on the sub-stag.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.400
We were just talking before we started about when I didn't see you.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.840
But when you were in Vegas in July, and I was in search for people, once upon a time,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.360
if you wanted to gamble legally, you'd go to Las Vegas, basically, or maybe Atlantic

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.840
City after you're in 1978.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.560
But basically, you'd go out to the desert.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.320
Lucian that we just have to have.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.320
There we go.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.040
I believe in here.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.480
People available for counseling and more rehabilitation centers.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480
Is that the solution?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.120
I don't really think that stuff works very well to me.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120
Here's what I do think.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
Look at that shirt.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.320
People's phones is a mistake.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.400
I think putting it in every- You don't think gambling rehabilitated?

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:21.200
See, that shirt even indicates the whole, you know, who are we supposed to unmask here,

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.200
right?

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.560
Who are we supposed to unmask here?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.280
That's the real question I've got on my head.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.960
Who are we supposed to unmask here?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.440
We say that it has to be regional.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.160
Like how do we say that you can go to Vegas?

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.680
It's totally legal, but you can't gamble in Michigan.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.840
That's a fair question.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.720
I don't have a good answer to that.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:48.760
So is the solution that we just have to have more people available for counseling and more

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.560
rehabilitation centers?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560
Is that the solution?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.080
I don't really think that stuff works very well to me.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080
Here's what I do think.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.280
Putting it on people's phones is a mistake.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.400
I think putting it in every- You don't think gambling rehabilitation works or any rehabilitation

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.480
I don't think rehabilitation works as a rule.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.440
I think- So those are the people that he's unmasking.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:15.080
Gottlieb, Slavitt, Borla, people that profited from the pandemic exactly the same nonsense

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:22.520
story that was told in that 1936 or 1934 cartoon about blaming the capitalists because

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:28.120
we threw a bunch of money out the window at a fake problem in order to bankrupt the

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120
country.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120
That's what they did.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.040
That's what they've been doing.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.040
We were set up for this over decades, ladies and gentlemen, and these people are climbing

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.960
the ladder to get on board with those people that set us up.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.120
I guarantee it.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.120
They want a part of the weaponized piles of money.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.520
And as Nick Hudson recently said on an interview, that's the main problem that we have, and

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:56.120
it should be a great source of hope that it costs billions, if not trillions of dollars

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:02.400
to sustain this illusion that we are trapped in.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.000
It costs the work of hundreds of people to oppose the information that Mark is trying

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
to get out.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.600
It costs hundreds of people in order to keep Jessica Hockett under wraps.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:19.400
It costs hundreds of people to control this operation to the extent to which we can now

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:26.160
have this guy with a shirt that needs bleach on Joe Rogan pretending to be one of the

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.960
people that unmasked all these bad guys very early on because he was onto the scam of weed

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960
before the pandemic.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.400
I think when people want to stop, they stop.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.040
But you don't think that support from other human beings that have also gone through it

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.520
can be beneficial in making good decisions in the future?

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:51.560
I think if, here's a solid tip, start your day off the right way like I do with AG1.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:57.120
It's a science-driven nutritional science, any trot slash Rogan, check it.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.120
This episode is brought back to warbeek.com.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.120
A lot of commercials.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.480
A lot of people who want to stop, that can be helpful to them.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.360
I don't think anybody who goes to rehab unwillingly or even selling willingly is going to get much

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.560
out of it.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.360
I know this is a controversial perspective.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.440
One of the things that, so before COVID, just before COVID, I was working on a big book

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:27.120
about, bigger than the cannabis book, growing out of the cannabis book about drug legalization

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.320
and addiction in general.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.560
The most disappointing thing that I found when I was doing this research is that when you

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:41.120
try to do randomized trials where you take 100 people and you say 50 of them, you're

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:47.160
going to go to AA, the other 50 or not, and you look at their outcomes a year or five

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.040
years later, there's no benefit to even going to AA, which I really thought worked.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.920
The reason AA seems to work is that people who go to it and stick with it, like you say,

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.360
get something out of it.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.200
But there are going to be a bunch of people who don't get anything out of it.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.560
We're like, I don't need to give my volition to God.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.920
This is a problem I'm going to fix.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.680
I don't like the AA model, and by the way, why do I have to sit in this room three hours

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680
a week?

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.800
For every person who gets something out of it, there's somebody who doesn't get anything

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800
out of it.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:25.240
The truth is, people stop using drugs or stop gambling when they personally realize that

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.520
it's become a crisis for them.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.680
Sometimes though, people are motivated by other people's feedback.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.280
Is there a point of no return, or is it, it's got to be variable for different people?

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.240
I think for some people, rehab is probably very beneficial, especially because they get

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.440
a chance to talk to someone who made it out of it.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.920
Who was telling us about this rehab guy that came and cracked out of his mind?

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.800
I was Brian Simpson.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.880
The guy, he was like a counselor or something like that, and then one night he just went

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.440
off the wagon and came back to work in the morning, and everyone's like, hey, are we

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.600
supposed to pretend that you're not cracked out of your mind right now?

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:10.000
Let me give you a laugh, but the most dangerous time for an addict is the first two weeks

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.960
after they come out of rehab, because they've stopped using their tolerances down, and if

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.880
they start again, that's when people OD and die the most.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:24.160
It's not easy, but then the argument against legalization.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.480
Here's the problem, and I've talked about this ad nauseam if you heard this, I'm sorry.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.160
When I was a kid, if someone was on heroin that was fucking super rare, it was super

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.040
rare, you would know that guy's off the deep end, like Johnny's out there in the woods

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.760
doing heroin, like, whoa, like that guy's gone.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.440
But now here, oh, my uncle got hooked on pills is super normal, right?

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.160
It's super normal, and now because of these documentaries, we know like what was the,

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.400
but we're not calling them what we should be calling them.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.400
You're not calling.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.400
They're not pills.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400
They're opioids.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:01.440
Opioids used to be unprescribable in medicine.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:10.960
Met doctors didn't touch those things, and if they did, they gave you like four.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.880
The idea that Valium, for example, was something that you, you could not get a prescription

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:23.400
for Valium unless you were very, very rich and had a very, very lenient doctor.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:31.160
But we just started prescribing opioids over the counter for a decade, ramping up their

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:37.600
production at the pharmaceutical purity levels and heretofore unseen, developing synthetic

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:44.040
versions of them that were 10 or a hundred times more powerful, all the while knowing

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:49.200
that this whole family of chemicals is devastating to the neurochemistry of a human or any other

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.320
mammal for that matter.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:59.480
And the best that these two bright minds can do is say pills.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.960
The best that this testosterone using psilocybin enthusiast can do is say pills.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.400
He can't be more precise than that.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.400
Jesus.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:20.480
I don't like what was the root cause of that, but now once it's kind of been established

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.800
that this is a recreational thing for people.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800
So what do you do?

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800
Do you outlaw?

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.000
And then what does that do?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That, that empowers the cartels because there's the demand already.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.400
So, so, okay, so the roots of the opioid crisis are exactly, you know, Peter Burke, I mean,

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.480
you know, that, that, that, that series is completely correct.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.560
It came out of Purdue Pharma, it came out of, unfortunately, some doctors, some of whom

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.280
I think thought they were doing the right thing, some of whom were motivated by money,

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.600
they pushed prescriptions of opioids in the U.S. in an absolutely insane way.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:00.560
And we've now tried to push back, but we're still dealing with the fruits of that poison

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560
tree.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.760
And no numbers, no numbers at all.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.120
I don't know any numbers.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.840
I just know that they were doing that.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.320
They made a lot of money off it.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.680
I don't know any numbers, so numbers are hard to come by.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.840
Wasn't that done before in other countries, to kind of ruin countries, like introduce

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840
heroin?

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.400
Classic example, and, you know, when people talk about how the Chinese export fentanyl

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.960
to the United States, I guarantee you there are people in China who have not forgot the

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960
opium wars.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.440
In the 19th century, the U.S. and Britain, and this is something we should be ashamed

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.400
of forever, we basically forced opium on the Chinese.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.400
And we, we just...

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.640
I think to say that the United States and Britain did that is disingenuous at best.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.240
I don't think the United States was making opium.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.800
I don't think the United States had any colonies that had opium.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:55.200
So the idea that it wasn't Britain and the Netherlands, because the Brits and the Netherlands

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.320
were the only people that were making that trip and made you the Portuguese, what is

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:07.240
he talking about, the Brits and Americans, what kind of bullshit is this?

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240
We destroyed that society.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.040
Well, you and I weren't alive.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040
That's true.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.520
So I don't think we should be ashamed.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:17.000
But I think human beings in general have done some really fucking heinous things.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.400
We just want to pretend that they don't do them anymore.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.960
Oh, no, they do.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.440
But isn't it interesting?

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.880
It's part of the pushback of all this stuff from people that have no stake in the game

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.720
other than they're a human being.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.440
Okay, if they were big opium traders though at that time, then they were still using

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440
the British ships.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.280
They were still using the Portuguese ships.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.560
They were still using somebody else's ships, because America didn't have a significant

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.080
shipping company that was taking anything somewhere to somewhere else over in China.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.720
It's just, I don't think that's true.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.240
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.280
Is that you're saying something that shatters their narrative?

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.000
They have a narrative they've established about what's good in the world, how the world,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.280
what's the right thing to do and the direction we have to go.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.280
And these people are looking out for us and these people are Nazis.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.560
And when you have that and something comes along and says, hey, there might be something

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560
afoot here.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560
You should pay attention.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.440
I mean, the Dutch East Indies company, I'm sorry if I said that incorrect.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.920
You should pay attention.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.280
Like there's some data you should look at.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.320
We have a long history of people lying about all kinds of things, you know, whether it's

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.200
the opium war, fucking everything throughout human history.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.720
But for whatever it is, like now we don't, hey, that's fentanyl is cheap because it is

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.880
a chemical and chemical synthesis is not something we can't do at a huge scale.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.800
So Mark's totally right.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.720
That's what's so crazy about fentanyl is unlike heroin that needs to be grown and

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.880
poppies and all that sort of stuff.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:54.040
If you're making a synthetic product using a synthetic process, it could potentially be,

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.920
you know, pennies on the, on the gram, even pennies on the kilogram for all I know.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.680
So Mark's totally right.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:10.600
Hey, that's not, that's, oh, this conspiracy theorist, oh, this guy, this wacky guy with

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.720
his fringe ideas, he's an alt right hero and like, oh, okay, I get it.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
I get it.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
I wish the world was perfect too.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720
I really do.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.960
I wish there was a guy in the White House that was this amazing human being and a shining

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:30.000
example of what's possible from just a person, a loving person wants to take care of a nation

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.200
because they really believe in them.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.720
But this is like, you've got me laughing.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.280
But it's what we want.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.480
And we never get it.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.480
We never get it.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.680
It's like fucking, it's, it's Charlie Brown and Lucy that football just gets yanked away

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.680
every time.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.720
And we're like, shit.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720
Okay.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.280
So they kind of get it, right?

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.960
It seems like they kind of get it, but they don't realize that the national security state

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.560
would lie to them about bioterrorism and the potential for pandemics in order to have this

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.000
illusion be complete in order to completely close the prison doors on us.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.320
They, they, Joe knows Alex doesn't know.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.960
Shit, I thought this was going to be the adults were in the room.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960
Shit.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960
You know?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Look, I mean, beware of the person who, you know, who tells you what to do because they

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.720
know what's best for you.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720
Yeah.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.520
That's a, that's a normal thing.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.920
Isn't that what Alex made does for a living with his books?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.920
Isn't that what Jordan Peterson does for a living with his books?

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.920
Come on.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.520
It's like so obviously contradictory.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.400
That's a normal thing of human nature too.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.920
It's a weird thing about human nature.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.320
We're always led by someone.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:45.400
That's very strange because it seems to be a part of just our programming that we have,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.720
we've kept since we were primates in like the jungles.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:57.640
Since we were primates in the, where's Brett Weinstein, the scientific advisor of Joe Rogan

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.800
correcting this guy?

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.840
What did you teach this clown?

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.000
The jungles.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.720
Like there was always a leader.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.080
There's like, if you ever watched that chimp nation show, an amazing show on Netflix.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.280
These scientists were embedded in this chimpanzee group for 30 years and so the chimpanzees

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.600
had become totally comfortable with human beings as long as they were 20 yards away.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.440
So they never moved any closer than 20 yards.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.640
The chimp moved close to them.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640
They back away.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.640
You never have food.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.400
It's a bunch of rules about what to do and what not to do.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.600
If you follow those rules, these chimps behave as if they're just chimps in the jungle.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.080
So it's this incredible opportunity to watch their social hierarchies.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.680
And it's just like people.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680
There's a leader.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680
There's always a leader.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680
There's always a leader.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.680
And there's young people that are challenging the leader and the leader has to beat them

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680
down.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.280
And it gets to a certain point in time when the leader can't do that anymore and he has

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280
to relinquish.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.920
And it's all about the relationships they develop while they're leaders.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.800
And those are the ones that can go on the longest.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.040
That's the same thing with human being.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.800
It's like, God damn it, it's literally our programming.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.920
And we've surpassed it in our ability to communicate and our ability to understand the

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.280
variables and the amount of variables.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.280
But we still are operating in this hierarchy.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.720
And so are they going to go to the stage where this could be hijacked, hijacked by

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.120
an illusion of consensus of the hierarchy above you.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:28.680
An illusion of consensus about what the hierarchy is and whether or not you're climbing it.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.240
It's so funny to think that they're so clever when it comes to seeing the truth in chimps,

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.520
but they can't see the truth in themselves.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.760
It's really crazy because if you watch that Champ Empire show and you think of us, like

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.840
you can, oh my God, this is what our problem is.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.200
We always want to have a leader.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.080
We always want to run things.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.680
We always want to tell other people, we get power out of telling other people what to

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.920
do.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.400
Some people just get their jollies.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.280
Like you know that if you have a bad boss and the boss yells at all the people in the

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.280
warehouse, like fuck.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.600
Because one's a humility and being charged.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.600
Yes.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.040
They beat their chest and run through the fucking trees and shake them.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.840
It does sometimes feel like anybody who wants power should not be allowed to have it.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Yeah, right?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.200
Like and the only people who should be president, people don't want that job.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.800
You know, it's like John Dutton and Yellowstone, he has to become governor.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.000
You know, it's like, it's really like fucking, it's kind of similar.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yes.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Jesus Christ.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.400
Me more, me more, me more, the old chimps now will not leave the stage.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:36.160
Bro, not just the, I mean, all of them, all of them, these people are hanging in.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.360
It's amazing with like, so that's not a problem.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.320
That's not a by, by design.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.920
That couldn't be through crime or conspiracy.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.520
That's just because I guess we keep voting for the same old people.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.160
I guess Mitch McConnell just wins.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.920
I guess these people just, they just have such a following despite the fact that they

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.200
married a Chinese national connected to the largest shipping company in the world.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:06.720
Nobody in Kentucky is smart enough not to vote against Mitch McConnell, right?

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.440
Do we really believe that?

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:16.880
I don't like hormone replacement and Adderall and whatever else they have to take.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.200
These folks can keep going deep into their 80s except that Mitch McConnell guy.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.520
No, no, he's, he's having some real ones.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.840
He's just going to fall over.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.400
He's having some real moments like that, if that in any other job.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.800
It's funny that they said that people are using Adderall and other things to maintain

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.960
their, their, their energy levels at older age.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.960
I have no doubt in my mind.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.720
I have no doubt in my mind that there are times when we've seen Joe Biden on Adderall

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.760
and times when we've not seen him on Adderall, it's basically amphetamine.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:53.920
So when his eyes are like this and he's really sure about stuff, he's probably got an Adderall

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920
in him.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920
And when it's not, then he's not.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:01.200
And he's slower and he's, you know, it's the way it is.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.360
Wouldn't doubt it if one of these two guys at the table has a prescription for it for

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.360
their ADHD.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360
Other job.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.200
Like imagine if you're a trained conductor and you just freeze up Charlie, Charlie, the

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200
crossroads.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.200
It's coming.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.200
Charlie.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:22.240
Charlie's just locked up like windows 98, like blue screen of that bro.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.240
You got control.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.800
I'll delete Charlie before this fucking train crashes, but, but you can do it if, you know,

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:33.200
you're a high ranking politician in the greatest country the world's ever known.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.680
It's very strange, you know, like Diane Feinstein doesn't want to relinquish her, her throne.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.960
But what I understand is it's also all the people that work for her too, and they all

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.280
have like a whole system.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.440
It's probably not even her that's getting things done, but it's, it's just a giant staff.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.440
That's right.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.640
And if she stays in office and the giant staff keeps doing what they're doing.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.880
Yeah, I don't even know if it's a giant staff, but a competent and that voice is just all

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.880
yeah.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880
Yeah.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880
Yeah.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.880
That's the way.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880
Yeah.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
That's the way it worked.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:02.880
Yeah.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.560
But none of these are a problem.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:11.200
None of this would be a symptom of rather the tip of the iceberg in terms of the corruption,

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.720
lying, and cheating that's going on inside of our government being done by a group of

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.960
traders on both sides of the aisle.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.320
These two geniuses are never going to come to that conclusion.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.640
That would be crazy.

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.000
These two geniuses are never going to come to the conclusion that America is being being

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.760
controlled, demolished by globalist interests.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760
It's real bad.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.480
Oh, yeah, it's real bad, but we can't really put a finger on exactly why it's bad.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480
It just seems bad.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.480
You know, it's like bad competent staff.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480
Yeah.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.680
It's not about no, their jobs depend on her as much as Hollywood, right?

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.280
Like your job depends on your relationship with the big, big guy, big woman.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.280
Right.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.480
Well, you know that lady's not making the big decisions at this point, at this stage.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.480
That's when she started.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480
Oh, my God.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480
Jesus.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.480
She was kind of pretty.

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.480
She was hot.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.480
The thing is, man, when you get stuck, that job is like any other job.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.440
If that's what you do, if you play football, you fucking, you're used to colliding with

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.840
people and scrambling for the ball, that's what you do.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
What they do is govern.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.960
It's like, why am I telling you, like, why are you going to tell Mick Jagger he can't

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960
tour anymore?

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960
That's right.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960
Come on, man.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.960
He looks awesome out there.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.960
What are you going to do?

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.960
They're fucking politicians.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.480
What do we expect?

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:29.280
It's just that should be like fucking, there should be some sort.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.680
That is wrong because politicians used to retire because people used to have other things

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.880
that they wanted to do.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:39.280
People used to actually serve the country and then get a little worn out from it and

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.840
so want to retire, want to spend time with their grandchildren or their wife or at their

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840
cabin.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:52.760
And so for me, watching these old people go on is watching them fulfill the requirements

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.800
of their boss, watching them do what they're told.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.800
That's what I see.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.760
I don't see somebody who, Diane Feinstein's not clinging to power.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.640
Mitch McConnell's not clinging to power.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.440
Biden's not clinging to power.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.320
These people are playing a role in an ongoing theater that they have been playing a role

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.160
in for decades.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.480
And so they're still just playing the role.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:25.600
You don't honestly think that there's a photograph on the night of John F. Kennedy's inauguration

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:34.160
of a very attractive debutante named, named, uh, uh, the hell is her name?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160
Now shit.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.520
All of a sudden I got a blank.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:47.480
Her Pelosi was, was like a debutante introduced to JFK at his, at his inauguration.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.520
And in those days she was dressed about as hot as you could be dressed as a young person

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.240
meeting the president.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.400
And now she's been a senator of California for the last 30 years and has enriched herself

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.920
beyond reason.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.240
And that's just okay.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:06.080
Yeah, it's just, the system is kind of screwed up, but they wouldn't lie to us about anything

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.080
else.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.280
They wouldn't lie to us about everything in order to steal everything.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:15.760
They wouldn't lie to us on behalf of a, a larger power, larger powers of weaponized piles

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:20.640
of money and, and, and they wouldn't be traitors.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.040
That would be crazy.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.680
There should be some sort of a cognitive test or something at some point in time.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.040
It should be like, look, we really need, can we give you another job?

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.520
Like a second job 35 to be present and why shouldn't there be a top limit?

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.960
Why shouldn't it be 80 or something?

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960
It's 45.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960
I mean, it's 45.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.960
Not 35.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.880
Why don't we move like the elder statesman into a different bracket and see like advisors,

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.240
have them be advisors to discuss policy.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.880
They're your, wouldn't that be great?

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880
Yeah.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.600
If like the senators could go and meet with the advisors are still around, well, back

01:24:52.600 --> 01:25:00.280
in the 2000s, there was an issue with 4G, you know, like, this, you know, I mean, there's

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.800
got to be a way to do it where you have like more vibrant people representing whatever

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.240
they're representing.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.240
Yes.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.760
But it's also, they don't want to relinquish power and they've got a really good grip on

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.760
it now.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.480
It's really, if you want to run a country like within the rules and kind of dominate

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.800
it, they've done an amazing job because they've done it all within the rules.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.280
It's like, it's pretty clever.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280
Yes.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.720
It's like if when Donald Trump was talking about not paying taxes, you know, it's like

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.200
yeah, you guys set it up like that's enough to take advantage of it.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200
There we go.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.120
It's like, if this is where it gets dark.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.280
This is a good, I mean, it's a good segue into a lot of things, but it's also a good

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.520
segue into sort of COVID and pharma and those guys.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
Here we go.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.280
Because they are at going to the edge of the line, going to the gray area.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280
Right.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280
They don't, they don't necessarily lie.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.240
Although sometimes I think when they're forced to, they will lie, but they shade the truth.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.680
They don't really lie.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.560
I guess if they're forced to, they'll lie, but they don't really lie.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.880
Oh my God.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:08.520
They, they run studies in a way that determines, you know, that gets the out, gets them to

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.040
the outcome they want.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.400
They use friendly doctors to promote, you saw it with pharma with, with Purdue pharma

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:19.040
with the, with oxy and with the opioids, you saw this in spades and we're seeing it again

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.240
right now with the mRNA vaccine.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:31.400
So these companies, they know they're very, they're very legally wise and they play games.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.400
And they're allowed to.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.400
And they're allowed to.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.400
And that's their job.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400
Right.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.400
That's what's interesting.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Well, you would hope it's not their job.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.040
Well, there's one guy's job and that guy's job is to invent medicine.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.000
I mean, not one guy, one group of cures.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.040
And then the other people, their jobs to sell it, their jobs to get it out there in

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.240
their very different kinds of thought processes I would imagine.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.680
And that's part of the problem with like business and medicine when they're together.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.960
It's like either we're looking out for each other or we're trying to make insane amounts

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.320
of wealth from each other.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320
That's right.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:08.360
Both of those things are like, that's two ways of looking at the healthcare for a country.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.920
Either we say the whole reason the system is in place is to make sure that everybody is

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.920
healthy.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.560
And if you get injured, we can help you.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.200
If you can do it that way, that would be wonderful.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.760
The other way to do it is saying, we got to fucking get you on as much shit as possible

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.280
because the more stuff we sell to you, the more money we make.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.400
And if there's a reason to recommend it, we're going to recommend it because you want to

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:39.680
make our reps happy, want to make the hospital happy and unfortunately that seems to be real

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.680
too.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.580
It's very real.

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.680
So that's real too.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.720
So that's a real possibility in today's modern age.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.560
And I'm sure there are people that fall into the former.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.320
I'm sure there's a, I mean, I have no doctors that are great human beings and they really

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320
enjoy being able to help people.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320
Yes.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.320
It's not.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.440
It's just like, it's just, that's how a system works.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.720
When a system has the opportunity to make more money by doing certain things, it's like,

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.880
it's not the scientists that are doing trying to, it's like, there's a whole system.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.920
So with the drug companies, and I think this is true of doctors too, it's not that they,

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.080
they want people to get better.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.080
I do believe that.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.080
Okay.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.280
But once you've invested a billion or two billion dollars in a drug and you've brought

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.120
it to market and it's gotten up to your approval, you're going to do what everything is protected.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.840
And that means generally exaggerating its benefits.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.040
And if there are problems with it, doing everything you can to hide those problems.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.600
And that's almost like a fiscal responsibility to your shareholders.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600
That's right.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600
That's roughly crazy.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.600
That's what's really crazy.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.240
What's really crazy about it is that money and medicine are all combined.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.000
And it's not saying that doctors don't deserve money or the people that develop medicines

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
don't deserve money.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
They certainly do.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.080
They work really hard.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.120
What I am saying is, when you have anything that gets wrapped up in a lot of money, people

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120
want to make more.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120
Yeah.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120
They want to make more.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120
Like, how do I make more?

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120
Yes.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120
You know, I don't like-

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.440
What did they say that Medicare was Medicaid or Medicare was?

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:15.440
It was 10% of the budget, 25% of the state budgets, $360 billion, 11 years ago.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.720
Plus the monoclonal antibody market was $150 billion.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.880
I wonder what cancer research and cancer treatment is.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:26.880
I wonder what the-

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.280
You see what we're talking about here.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:34.800
We're talking about potentially trillions of dollars being made through this health care

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.440
for higher system that these guys are defending.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.600
That's how a system works.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.600
That's how the system works.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.960
You know, there's good and bad parts of the system.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:50.760
And when you set up a system that is capitalist, I guess, and people make money, they want

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.060
to make more money.

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:58.000
They're making excuses for a system that they have to know is completely in 100% gained.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.480
That's where they make their money.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.920
These guys are all sponsored by that system.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:10.360
That's why they are so eloquently walking around the circle of this limited spectrum

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:14.120
of debate about health care and public health and pharmaceutical companies.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.760
Give me a break.

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.760
You know, I don't like making X amount.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.760
I want to make Y.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.760
How do I get to Y?

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.760
Yep.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.760
What do I have to do?

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760
I'm going to sell this.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.760
I'm going to do that.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.320
I've got to make some unnecessary these or those and do a few things to people that maybe

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320
they didn't need.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
Yes.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320
And it's okay?

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520
Maybe it benefits them.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.760
It probably doesn't hurt them that much.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.400
You justify it.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.560
And then there's real things that people thought were conspiracies.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:45.360
Real things like incentives and that showed up during the pandemic as well.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:52.240
They got paid per case for people that had COVID and they got paid per COVID deaths and

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.720
they got the whole thing was weird.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.040
It's like if you.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.560
That's not weird.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.600
You just got through explaining life a system was set up for people to make money that people

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.600
would make money.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:09.200
You just got through saying that people will walk the fine line right up to the line of

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200
ethics.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.920
It's not weird.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:20.120
If you financially incentivize the existence of a novel pathogen and you incentivize the

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.920
existence of a national security priority, then holy shit, you're going to find a lot

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.120
of people that are financially incentivized to declare a national emergency for this novel

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120
pathogen.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.680
That's weird, he says.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:42.160
Financially incentivize the treatment of a pandemic disease that seems like I understand

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.280
that hospitals have to make money.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:52.720
But isn't there a fear that you label something COVID death you get more money that people

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.560
would use that on things that weren't necessarily COVID, especially if there's no oversight.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.560
Oh, of course.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.280
Oh, but one more step, Joe.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.280
One more step, Alex, imagine the possibility that if they knew that this was going to work,

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.680
they had to seed the narrative.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:14.760
They had to actually create the illusion of spread by creating a few mass casualty events.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.680
Do you think anybody would be willing to do that for say a couple trillion dollars in

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.040
profit?

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.320
Do you think anybody would be willing to do that for say, I don't know, a shift in global

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:31.840
power from national sovereignty to some global super national organization made up of cooperating

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.240
weaponized piles of money?

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:39.320
Maybe you should ask your friend Peter Thiel about that, Joe.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:44.120
He can't possibly imagine he just got through explaining how the pharmaceutical companies

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.560
will do everything they can that walk right up to the line.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.640
They might lie if they have to.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:55.880
Can you imagine a scenario where this behemoth of weaponized pile of money combined with

01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:05.080
the lust for global control of the human population might be motivated to create a few mass casualty

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:10.960
events and tell you that it was the spread of a novel virus and then confuse it by using

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:15.240
financial incentives would get people like you to think that you are unmasking a Scooby-Doo

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.640
villain by saying that.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.400
We're right there, ladies and gentlemen, we're right at the edge of the limited spectrum

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:30.160
of debate curated by the intellectual dark web that is Joe Rogan, that is Eric Weinstein,

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:41.560
Brett Weinstein, the guy who wears the cap all the time, Shapiro and Rubin and all these

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.720
people, Tim Poole, they're all part of the same show.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:56.040
And unfortunately, because Brett Weinstein and all of these pseudo dissidents have all

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:01.040
gone through the Rogan podcast, my only conclusion can be that they're all on the same team.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.000
Malone, Corey, all the people that cried on this podcast early on in the pandemic about

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.880
what was done to them and what they sacrificed were part of the show and the narrative that

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.920
they pushed was part of the show.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:20.320
In fact, all of them pushed the same thing, novel treatments, novel viruses, the bad response,

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.480
a contaminated shots, it's all the same shit.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.640
And not one of them will question the pretense that maybe they lied to us about this in order

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:35.840
to invert our sovereignty to permissions over a couple generations.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.640
We need to get there, ladies and gentlemen, we need to get there fast.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.640
Of course.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.720
They're not combing through your fucking books.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.680
And if the worst thing that happens if they do comb through your books is you have to pay

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.840
some of it back.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.640
All you see is that's right.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.640
Exactly.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.640
Exactly.

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.640
We just we up-coded a little bit here.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640
We cheated a little bit there.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.640
We'll give you a check.

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.800
We talked about it on the podcast and people said he was making it up.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.800
Nope.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800
He was not making it up.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.080
He's saying if you got bit by a shark and you have COVID, then we call it a COVID death.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080
Yes.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080
Just like, what?

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.200
And, and this is still going on, Joe.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.320
What's going on till 2025?

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:15.240
If you're, if you're a family member and you're, and you can get a family member who died

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.240
to be classified as a COVID death, as long as you talk about them paying for funeral costs,

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.200
you're not talking about the fact that they got people on the conveyor belt of death by

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.520
giving them supplementary oxygen in 2020.

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.640
As long as you're talking about paying for funeral costs, even till 2025, you're not talking

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.120
about the 500,000, maybe six or 700,000 people that were murdered in the United States

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:46.920
by a combination of causes that includes opioids that they were just talking about as pills.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.920
This is the definition of the limited spectrum of debate.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:56.680
It is exactly how we are being beaten by this fifth generation warfare, which is equivalent

01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:02.160
to winning and unwitting participants in an illusion of consensus about a lie.

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:07.840
The COVID death, you get up to $9,000 for their funeral expenses.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.920
You submit it to FEMA, they cut your check.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:16.120
And so, of course, those families want, oh, you know, they want $9,000.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.120
Who wouldn't?

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.920
I mean, yeah, it's free $9,000, your loved one's already gone.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920
Yes.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:29.640
The thing is just so slippery because, yeah, if everything was perfect, you would say

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.680
maybe it would be good to help these people with a funeral.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.240
Maybe it would be good if you get on a call.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.240
But why is COVID different than anything else?

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240
Good question.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.440
Why do you get $9,000 for COVID and nothing else?

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.440
Right.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.520
What do you think would it be like if people started promoting that for obese folks?

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.440
If you're obese and you die, it would give you...

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.920
It would bankrupt the federal government.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.160
Somehow as obese, you know, like, you just like...

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.760
People respond to incentives when there's money, companies respond to...

01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Unfortunately, right?

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:00.760
Unfortunately, everybody.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:01.920
Yeah, I mean, I guess, unfortunately, I mean...

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.680
It would not bankrupt the federal government.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.880
The federal government has been bankrupt for quite some time.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.440
I mean, even that's just a stupid statement.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.600
Wow, is that stupid?

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.120
I think somebody like Ed Griffin would just roll his eyes right out of his head if he

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.120
heard that.

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.480
That if we paid for the funeral of fat people, it would bankrupt the government.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.280
As if the government isn't already bankrupt.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.280
Holy cow, that's hilarious.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.280
Yes, unfortunately.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:33.080
I mean, look, it's why we have this, you know, all these great things in this country too.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080
Yeah.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.160
I will give you...

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.880
So an ophthalmologist called me a few weeks ago.

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.040
There's a drug and the drug works, okay?

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.920
It's good for people if something called wet macular degeneration, okay?

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.880
It's something that older people get and it can blind you.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.880
Listen to this story.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.520
There's a couple of drugs that actually work for it.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.000
They block the flow of...

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.680
They block blood vessel formation at the back of the eye.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.760
They help you.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:04.840
So these are administered ophthalmologists and minister them in their offices.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:10.520
So a drug like that, the ophthalmologist actually buys and charges Medicare or the private insurer

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.520
for.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.160
Okay, what's happening, and I saw this with a different drug when I worked in the New

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.680
York Times 15 years ago, so nothing ever changes.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.160
These companies all play the same game.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.840
He worked for the New York Times, noted the same game, is that the companies that make

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:32.800
this drug are giving doctors a rebate on the purchase price and the more you use, the

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.360
bigger the rebate.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:40.160
And this is a drug that costs thousands of dollars per person per year, okay?

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.600
It's dose multiple times a year for a lot of these people.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.000
So what all this adds up to is if you're an ophthalmologist who's using a lot of this,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.440
the company is cutting you a check for five or sometimes six figures, sometimes multiple

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.360
times a year, okay?

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.400
Don't tell me that's not a bribe, okay, because that's a bribe.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.400
It may be legal.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.920
They may have found a way to do this.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.640
And so what he's telling you is just an example that happens at ophthalmologists, places where

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.960
nobody cares, you know, only rich people go to the ophthalmologist, like you got to

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.120
have good insurance for that anyway, right?

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.600
So he tells you this story about corruption and this really, you know, weird, isolated

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.440
setting when it's, it's systemic.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.280
That's how the entire system works.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:36.680
Hospitals are bribed, doctors are bribed, nurses are coerced, hospital administrators

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:42.040
coerce their employees through newsletters and emails that say the new standard operating

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.760
procedure for this is that.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.960
And so they're not really telling you what's wrong.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.360
They're not really raising the alarm.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.560
They're basically just telling you what they see out the window so that you stay asleep.

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.560
Don't open your eyes.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.840
I'll tell you what's out there.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.120
Don't bother looking outside.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.120
It's boring.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:06.040
It's just the farmland going by.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.360
There's nothing you can do to change where this train is going.

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.240
Go back to sleep.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:18.360
And he showed me, he showed me the, the, the check that his company or that his ophthalmology

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.480
practice had received and it was huge.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480
Okay.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.080
And by the way, these doctors make a lot of money on their own just doing the procedure.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.600
They don't need this, but the, but it's a way for the drug company to get them to use

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.600
this more.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:39.800
This is corruption all over our medical system.

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.240
This episode is brought to you by better help.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.800
Take a minute to check your social battery.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.160
Maybe the brief, here's this body.

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:54.600
Just, and how, how does that get resolved?

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.960
Is there a way at this point or is it the system itself?

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.760
Alex, save America.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.200
Tell us how to do it.

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.120
Self.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:15.960
Is it just a function of that's how human beings behave when they have, you know, enough regulation

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.920
where they can get away with some stuff and they just want to make more and more money

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.960
and it just becomes, that's what they're trying to do.

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.520
I mean, I don't know, I mean, it's just human beings.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.920
I mean, if you're that ophthalmologist in Florida, do you need another Ferrari?

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.520
But maybe you don't think that way.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.520
You don't think that way.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.880
You just think I can get it.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.880
Right.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.640
And I'm in this system and the system is fucked already.

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640
That's right.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.320
And I'm using this drug because I know it works and it's good for patients.

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.160
The problem is do you need another Ferrari is already disingenuous.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.240
The guy's not buying more Ferraris with that money.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240
He's putting it in the bank.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.160
He's buying properties.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.680
He's investing, you know, like, come on.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.920
That's already stupid because he's already being misleading when he says that rich people

01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.080
don't buy Ferraris anymore, especially if they have one already.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:07.480
What a stupid statement that is it gets people to ask the wrong question over and over again.

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.760
That's all these guys do.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.600
The problem is you're then you're then having incentives to ignore the problem if there

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.160
is one later.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:19.840
And so in this case, the guy actually said to me, he's like, this is a good drug.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.040
It does work.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:24.880
He said, but sometimes if we dose it too many times, we can get there can be sort of

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.680
a paradoxical effect where it stops working.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:33.240
If you're one of those doctors who's on the tit and getting that check every quarter or

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.560
every six months or, you know, however frequently you get it, you're going to.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.600
It's going to be harder for you to see the problem.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.840
I wonder if vaccines fall into that category.

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.400
Do doctors get paid for vaccines?

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.160
I wonder if hospitals get paid for vaccines.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.400
I wonder if if CVS in them got paid for vaccines.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.680
Oh my gosh, there's all this incentive and they make all this money, but they want you

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.640
to be mad about the money so that you accept the biology.

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:09.360
That's why I'm getting so upset because they're not talking about the contradictory immunomethology

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.640
that underlies a lot of this stuff.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.600
They're not talking about the fact that a lot of these drugs don't even work.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.600
They're just muscled onto people, coerced onto people that are so unhealthy.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.080
They just think, well, maybe I need another pill.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.560
So they're not really telling the truth here at all.

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.800
Because all of a sudden you have a financial incentive not to see it rise.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.120
I don't know what we do about any of this.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.000
I don't know what we do about it.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.320
Except talk about it and make sure people know.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.480
Talk about it, make sure people know.

01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.040
Because you're not talking about the real problem in a genuine way, discussing real

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.120
solutions and you're actually not helping anybody and that's the definition of the limited

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:56.000
spectrum of debate that reinforces the presuppositions of the state.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.160
Thank you, Noam Chomsky.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:04.040
You need senators that call this stuff out and we need people that run these companies

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:09.120
to be just to have their ethical boundaries because they make great stuff.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.480
The thing about pharmaceutical drug companies is I would never say we don't need them.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480
That's crazy.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.920
I mean people, they've helped.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:20.360
You know how many drugs the pharmaceutical companies use that we currently demonize because

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.480
of this thing, this for-profit aspect of it.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.160
But how many of them have brought drugs to the market that have fixed all sorts of problems

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.160
that people have been suffering for forever?

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.160
Wow.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.200
Let's start naming them.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.360
Let's start naming them, Joe.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.000
It must be an endless list, I bet you can name at least 10 right off the top of your

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
head.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Yeah.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Yeah.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.720
They just can't go ham, you can't go crazy and force people to take your stuff.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.920
Like, that's a bad relationship.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.760
Besides antibiotics, give me one.

01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:58.760
Like insulin maybe?

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.400
I mean, what is he talking about?

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.880
Holy shit.

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:08.040
Countless things have been cured by the- Wow.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:16.560
I mean, just absolutely wow.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.840
Just absolutely wow.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.520
The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.760
of acceptable opinion but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum, even encourage

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.920
the more critical and dissonant views.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:33.480
You know like these two stoners.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.960
Sorry, I don't think Alex Berenson smokes.

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.080
That gives people the sense that there is a free thinking going on while all the time

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.640
the presuppositions of the systems are being reinforced by the limits put on the range

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640
of the debate.

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640
What's the limits here?

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:59.280
Well, as pharmaceutical companies are obviously great, they've saved countless lives.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.600
Just amaze balls.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.440
I can't believe it.

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.680
A good relationship is a consumer and a provider.

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.200
And the provider develops these drugs that are very beneficial to people and most of

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.200
them are.

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.200
A lot of them are.

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.200
Right?

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200
Some of them are.

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:18.600
But they do have drugs that they've developed that are really beneficial for people.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600
They really do.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.600
They're real.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.600
Really?

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.600
They are really.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.600
We can't really throw out the bait with the bat.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.600
Really?

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.280
I just think that the problem is also the process, right?

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.880
Because to bring a drug to market costs so much fucking money.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.480
Oh, it's so expensive.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.440
It's so prohibitive for most guys.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.440
If you were like.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.440
It's unreal.

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:46.040
The FDA is so stringent and the kinds of things that are required for an EUA are so in depth.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.640
Oh, my gosh.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.960
If you were like some pharmacologist or some biologist and you guys were working together

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:56.360
and you developed something, you had this idea about a pathway and you figured out something

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.120
and maybe this could fix it and you really figured it out.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.120
Sure.

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.880
Good fucking luck.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:02.880
Right.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:03.960
Right.

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.960
Getting that thing approved.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960
Well, what?

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.720
I mean, one of the great disappointments for me in the last 10 years is realizing that

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.400
if you had to choose between a sewer system and a medical system, you'd choose a sewer

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.400
system.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.720
Like in other words, I know it's more efficient.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:21.280
What what actually helps human health more?

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.240
Oh, is he about to say that vaccines didn't do anything and then it was sewer systems

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.760
and water treatment?

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.760
Come on, right?

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.280
He can't possibly say that.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.800
He would get canceled.

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:37.800
The great gains for human longevity in the last 200 years have been really simple things.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800
Clean water.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.000
Try to get the air clean.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.680
Don't bury you know, don't have like meat packing plants in the middle of cities.

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.080
Don't bear, don't have giant graveyards in the middle of cities.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.080
Like that stuff.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:50.280
He seemed, excuse me, have you read dissolving illusions?

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.280
I have not.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.160
It's a fantastic book about just that and the beginning of it is they talk about the

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:00.280
conditions that people lived in because you never really think about it.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.880
Like, what would it be like to live in a city before there were cars?

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.880
Well guess what?

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:13.800
Why wouldn't Alex have read this book because this book is anti-vaccine?

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.040
Is Joe actually going to say it or not?

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.640
Of course he's not going to say it.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.640
Of course he's not.

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:20.440
At least he said the book.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.720
Susan Humphreys is a pretty decent, pretty decent doctor, everything that I've talked

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:28.720
to Susan Humphreys about.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.480
She's seemed pretty spot on.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.240
This Roman guy and I actually had some DMs on Twitter.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:42.640
I might be able to get him on the podcast if you guys are interested.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.440
I've only read about half of that book and then at some point I broke off of it and I

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.720
don't remember why it wasn't because it was bad, it was because I started reading something

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720
else.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.080
I'm very bad like that but when you're buying more books than you can ever read then that's

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:56.080
tends to be what happened.

01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.800
I'm free to admit I have more books than I could have possibly read during this pandemic

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.640
and given all the stupid papers we had to read.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.200
Well guess what?

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.640
But nothing gets to you.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640
That's right.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.960
You're not getting fresh vegetables in the winter.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.200
You're not getting vitamins.

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.200
That's right.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:15.080
There's massive malnutrition, starvation, extreme poverty.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:20.160
In the Netherlands you can get fresh vegetables all year long because of their gigantic greenhouses

01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.120
and their supply of wonderful greenhouse grown organic vegetables.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.760
I don't know how good they are from trace minerals and that kind of thing but in theory

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.840
you can get it all year long there.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.840
Extreme poverty.

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:38.120
People living in Squall are terrible sanitation.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:45.040
I mean open outhouses for entire blocks of people and just crazy diseases and they all

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:50.160
live on top of each other and again malnutrition, no vitamin D, no sunlight exposure in the

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:55.240
winter etc etc and a lot of those people get horrible diseases because of that just like

01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:01.000
they did in the olden times we know about when people dump shit in the streets.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.360
So that came.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.440
The first few decades of the Industrial Revolution were terrible for human health.

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.480
People got crammed together and they got sicker and then in about 1850 they started to figure

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:18.480
this stuff out for a hundred years like we did great okay but it wasn't really medicine.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:24.120
It was really more basic than that and so the last 50, 60, 70 years we've spent more

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:31.720
and more and more money on medicine trying to like continue that growth in life expectancy

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.400
and it turns out like there are limits to it.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.280
So life expectancy here is very different than eliminating disease or not disease from

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.280
the population.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.000
So it's a very interesting angle they took.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.040
I think they actually stumbled in a place that they didn't want to go and now they need

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.840
to stumble their way back out without touching the wrong switches because if they turn on

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:56.360
the wrong lights while they're in this room it will be obvious that wait are you saying

01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:01.920
that simple things rather than vaccines are what got us to where we are because the public

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:09.760
health apparatus told us that the reason why we got rid of all this stuff that I mean remember

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:16.520
that Vincent Rancid Yello showed us two days ago at the beginning of his 2024 virology

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:23.920
lecture that the rise in life expectancy in the western world was directly correlated

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:26.080
with vaccines.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:33.560
He told us that without a smile on his face without irony and now this guy is saying

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:39.200
something that's more akin to what we've said in books and things where sanitation

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.960
clean water et cetera what Doug did this we're not going to talk about DDT or any other

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:49.720
form of insecticide that was being used that might have caused people to have what appeared

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.480
to be a new disease we're not going to talk about any of that and we haven't mentioned

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:59.360
vaccines yet which is very very interesting he's talking about longevity not disease another

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.080
transhuman subject of course there are limits to it there are just limits and we seem to

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:10.040
be reaching them and the problem is in the US anyway we're now spending so much money

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:16.520
and having yeah Bert there's been out in my ear Bert money and having so many unnecessary

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.520
medical procedures of marginal value I'm not even talking about the cost I'm talking

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:25.640
about like value to people that we've we seem to have topped out and and and this is like

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:30.560
a really depressing thing to realize that that ultimately like once people get to be

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.920
about 80 there's just not that much you can do for them unless you're Vince McMahon

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:41.520
you've seen what he looks like no he's 78 years old looking back he goes to Jim at

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.760
three o'clock in the morning sleeps two hours a night let me you know so there's that canary

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:52.160
in the coal mine that's right I'd see many yeah yeah and he probably doesn't use anything

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:57.360
right he doesn't take any testosterone and doesn't do any of those things right Joe it's

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.880
just naturally just gets up at three in the morning works out because he's motivated

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:09.160
none of these people are just working out Joe Rogan is not just working out okay I'm what

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:13.640
it looks like when you don't work out and if I started to work out I could never look

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:19.040
like him unless I took some kind of testosterone testosterone supplement because I'm 52 years

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:23.280
old because I don't have enough time to live six days a week and because that's not my

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:33.800
physical structure but somehow people like Sam Harris also have muscles now people like

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:39.320
Huberman you know they all have muscles now not that I got anything wrong with guys with

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.920
muscles I could dunk over over Joe Rogan here he's a tiny man that's part of the reason

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:49.040
why their muscles look so big because they're tiny men with short little arms if I wanted

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.400
to look like that I would have to be as big as LeBron James I mean that's the joke of

01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.000
this here that this illusion on the internet includes tiny people looking and creating

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.920
the illusion that they are bigger than they are because they're on camera when in reality

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:13.720
they're tiny little people and I'm sorry but there was a song about short people and the

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:18.640
reason why there's a song about short people is because they are very vulnerable egos

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.960
it's hard to walk around the world and not be able to see it a concert it's hard to walk

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:28.320
around the world and not be able to ride all the rides I get it but it creates a certain

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.240
kind of person I don't want to be a jack but it's true because I'm six six and I know

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.000
what it's like I know how you guys act I know the problems that you have I know the jokes

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.480
that you make when I'm at a concert there's a group there's nobody behind me when we go

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.000
to a concert people meet at Jay look for the Cubs hat so I get it I know how these smart

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.920
people think I know why it's so easy for them to get caught in these ego traps to get caught

01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:03.400
in looking in the mirror look at how short he looked when he took a picture with Robert

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:13.080
F. Kennedy Jr. I tower over a RFK. RFK couldn't guard me I don't care how buffed up he is

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:19.240
that's the truth of it here we're dealing with egos that have been given comfort and fame

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.640
and they are not willing to relinquish it because they are no they are already climbing the ladder

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.000
of this elite group of people that understands that there's a lot of useless eaters on the planet

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000
and they're all about not being a part of that group and Alex Berenson is just as in as this guy

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.880
they get to go to all the conferences and at the and the after conference meetings

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.920
they get invited to those parties where people sit around and talk about it outside

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:48.920
next to the pool or or next to the gigantic fire

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:56.920
about how we are doing the bright thing for humanity about we are working against those people

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.840
over there or that group over there and all those other people out there are completely oblivious

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:05.720
to what's really going on it's cool to be a part of this group isn't it Joe

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:13.400
yeah well that's only four years from now yeah but the reality is you're right it's a you know

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.880
it just but it's also there's a lot of complicated factors in being healthy and they don't all

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:24.920
involve medicine no and it's not just said there is joking no no that's legit I think he was 76

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:32.920
or the 74 that's those four years ago that's ridiculous modern science right there baby modern

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.760
science it's not modern science we could give testosterone to people already 20 years ago it's

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.800
not modern science we knew that if you ate a lot of protein while you're with it's just silly talk

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:56.440
it's transhumanism disguised that's what it is you don't have a good life you're not healthy

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.520
look at these people you don't have any wealth look at these people this is not success this is

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:11.000
this is irreverence this is abomination everything on this show is a lie and an abomination

01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.880
it has no reverence for the sacred no reverence for the irreducible complexity of biology

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:26.600
no sense of of of humbleness that needs to be passed on from generation to generation

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.680
about taking care of our genetics and taking care of our health in the right way

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:37.960
this is just full-on tweak party here baby look at that look at them

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:46.360
jacked 76 78 year old man it's just jacked if you have a six 11 son i feel sorry for him because

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.480
he probably can't buy shoes at a store he probably can't buy jeans at a store i can still get jeans

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:57.880
at a store sometimes because i wear 34 36 it's like the the largest skinny size that anybody

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:03.880
makes in a store if you're lucky you can get a 34 34 but 34 36 is pretty tough to come by

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:09.640
but anything outside of that range you're done so six 11 it's just plain old

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.960
that six 11's a great great height for for basketball nowadays i mean man oh man oh oh

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:25.720
shit something happened here there's ink all over maybe i shook my hand did anybody see shake

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:31.080
my hand i sprayed ink all over the all over my mouse here somehow how the hell did that happen

01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.160
sorry i'm gonna hit play act

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.280
the train kept rolling with him yeah man it's uh there's a lot going on with with people's health

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:52.280
and um the the the reality is we we rightly should attribute a lot of into medicine it's great they

01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:57.400
did a lot of great stuff but also there's a lot of other factors and the the factor with like

01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.440
plagues is like the sanitation systems that we had in this country at the beginning of the 19th

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:09.560
century they were horrible horrible horrible yes horrible cholera i mean it was real tightness yeah

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:13.880
terrible disease that's all gangs in New York people forget you think in New York do you think

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:18.680
you're like fifth avenue like what an amazing place to visit it's the fact that it was horrific

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:25.480
little johnny came home with a cold and the next day was dead yeah horrific yeah wasn't it uh

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:30.200
i left him right you know one one thing that people dying left and right isn't that when they

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:34.600
were piling horseshit in the street or something isn't that what sash a lot of pova said i don't

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:39.800
know i just find this all a bit disingenuous and funny and that's why i wanted to watch it i think

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:48.200
it's really uh it's cool to see what the alternative people are listening to and to then imagine how

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:56.120
they feel some kind of uh reward see i was right i knew it i knew it i knew they were lying about

01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:00.680
this stuff i knew the system was corrupt i knew it was just a bunch of people making a lot of money

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:05.960
lying about a lab leak i also found out that was fascinating was uh about the spanish flu

02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:12.120
you know the spanish flu killed so many people right it killed a shit-time people but they they

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:17.080
said that what it killed people from is not actually the flu itself but the side disease

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.000
it's it come with it and that you could have cured those within their arms back to your pneumonia

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.840
yep that's true bacterial pneumonia what was the other one there was another one i think

02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:30.600
meningitis um that may be that may be was it that um but they said they they could have cured those

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.480
with uh antibiotics so if that happened to it like because the fear was always that the spanish

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:40.760
flu happened today but because medical science has progressed if that's the same flu came around

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.200
today they would actually be able to that's what they would say mortality would probably be much

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:50.280
no if there's a bad flu or bad you know another coronavirus believe i can just about guarantee

02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:56.440
you that will come out of a lab just like this one did this is a conspiracy theory and this is

02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.880
getting you kicked off youtube it's not a conspiracy theory to say it used to be out of a lab isn't

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:06.520
it funny that it used to be yes used to be racist to say it used to be something wrong with you

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:11.640
they did an amazing job of gaslighting people i didn't say it was made in a lab i said it came

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:18.600
out of a lab yes and it did okay yeah so well it seems like the people in the lab were patients

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:24.200
zero right yeah they were they were fucking around with the coronavirus they were trying to make it

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.920
more dangerous or trying to make and of course you're aware that he's recently put out a very

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.800
viral tweet that shows some kind of video he found where Tony Fauci and Ralph Barrick are agreeing

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.720
that they need to that they need to um where is this ink coming from it's starting to piss me off

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.880
um that they need to

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:49.000
i mean it's it's absolutely a joke to me that this is where we are because again we could have been

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:57.080
here already in in 2020 if we wanted to be because that's where i was in 2020 i was already

02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:02.840
talking about how this has to be a lab leak in 2020 and nobody wanted to listen to that then

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.000
they wanted to wait they wanted to wait a few years so that everybody would get on board with

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.080
the argument so that the scooby-doo mystery could congeal and set

02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:18.360
and so that controlled opposition like Alex Berenson could lead the way and pretend that he was

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:25.320
leading everybody out of the cave and obviously this one's from a lab oh you're gonna get kicked

02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:33.880
off of youtube haha it's all a big show and these guys wittingly or unwittingly are involved in

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:39.080
the show they are taking money from the people above them they are being promoted by the people

02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:45.720
above them they can't possibly believe that by just sheer hard work and persistence they are

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.040
as successful as they are especially this guy i mean this guy

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:57.640
don't even bother to buy his books they're terrible they they are as hard to read as he is to listen

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:03.320
to so we're trying to make a vaccine a pan coronavirus vaccine and they didn't they you know

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.640
somebody slipped or somebody accidentally injected a ferret when they were supposed to

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:15.560
inject a mouse and it all started there most likely yes most likely yeah look at his smile

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:21.080
they when they were supposed to inject a mouse they injected a ferret what kind of stupid shit is

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:28.280
this other than obfuscation of the truth which is that RNA can't pandemic this is to get you to

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.640
think that obviously RNA can pandemic obviously there are pandemics and this one just where did

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:48.600
it come from pharmaceutical companies are obviously good pharmaceutical companies are

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:55.160
obviously good

02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:00.760
i mean it obviously came from a laboratory i'm not saying was made in a lab i'm saying it came

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:06.280
from a lab obviously it came from a lab they were messing around and they put it in a mouse when

02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:11.720
they were supposed to put it in a ferret they've been trying to mess around with coronaviruses forever

02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:17.480
he just put up a video showing Ralph Barrick and Tony Fauci agreeing that this was a great idea back

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:25.320
in 2014 so obviously this was a gain of function weapon or a lab leak that they covered up obviously

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:34.120
no ladies and gentlemen it's a bit more complicated than that actually this is a mythology

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:40.680
about RNA viruses a mythology about vaccines that protect you from them by giving you

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:45.960
seroprevalence antibodies in circulation that protect you from the polio virus didn't you just

02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.920
see Mark's presentation today where he's reading an article where they were already

02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.880
selling this very illusion already way back when salt was still alive

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:03.000
that it was antibodies and seroprevalence not a correlate of immunity these are the little guys

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:13.800
the little soldiers this lie and their commitment to it has existed for more than 25 years

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.880
it is a sobering realization that every American needs to come to

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.000
and i don't care how or what door you come in i need everyone to start pushing this this is

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.880
the illusion right here vaccines give you antibodies antibodies protect you from disease

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:40.520
that is the lie that's the commitment that they have Vincent Rancin yellow paul off at

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:44.360
Brett Weinstein Joe Rogan Alex Berenson all in the same

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:50.200
they will not question this they will not question this immunomethology at all

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:55.880
even as they talk about how it wasn't vaccines but it was sewage and water treatment that

02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:00.280
actually brought the light longevity of the average American higher and higher until it

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:08.040
asymptoped at 80 years old they're not going to question the infectious cycle of a virus ever

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.720
Kevin McCurnan will be on Joe Rogan and make sure that they never question the infectious cycle

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:21.640
that they never talk about infectious clones as being the only way that virology even works

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:27.080
in a laboratory they're not going to question this cartoon at all very soon they will have

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:33.400
Kevin McCurnan on Joe Rogan to discuss this and he will say all kinds of stuff about pot genetics

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:38.520
and virions in pot and and it will be double stranded DNA all the way

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:49.000
and he will work continuously until I'm gone to obfuscate the differences between the cartoons

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.800
of infectious cycles and why we should be dubious when we see that some viruses need enzymes others don't

02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:03.240
some viruses make copies of everything that they need in our own cells others don't

02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:10.200
some make sub genomic copies of RNAs and research with others don't

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:17.640
and all of these cartoons are taken for granted as high fidelity illustrations describing a

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:24.680
high fidelity understanding that simply doesn't exist and is an illusion about a hijacking virus

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:29.800
that steals your cells and makes them do something they don't already do that's a lie

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:36.200
that can't be possible an RNA does not copy at high fidelity we know this already

02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:42.440
and we've used this elude this this illustration of a of a mixtape where where you lose fidelity

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:48.280
every time you make a copy of it RNA is not any any different there are no high fidelity ways

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:57.000
to copy RNA even if you believe Mark Denison and the exon gene is a proofreading sub sub unit

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:02.520
of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase even if you believe the one paper or the two papers that claims

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:08.200
that you shouldn't believe Kevin McCurnan for citing those papers and in fact it took him two

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:14.280
discussions with me about about clones before he cited that paper and then I was still able to

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:20.200
overrule him and say that well yeah but in that same paper Mark Denison says that that means that

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:29.160
there's also a lot of recombination and that recombination would also result in edited genomes

02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:39.160
incomplete genomes in competent genomes which already in 2020 21 rather uh Robert Malone told

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:45.320
us that the vast majority of these particles are not incompetent particles anyway and so the

02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:49.960
reality is is that when they find these RNAs in the wild they cannot grow them in culture

02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:55.800
it doesn't work and so they make a DNA sequence of it they take that DNA

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:03.960
the CD version and they make a copy of it in the form of plasmids they put that inside of

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:09.720
bacterial cultures those bacteria replicate that DNA once you have a lot of that DNA you can get

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:17.240
rid of the bacteria and you can combine it with RNA polymerase and now you have manufactured RNA

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:25.080
by process two process one being polymerase chain reaction process two being recombinant DNA

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:32.840
replication in bacteria culture process two used to make the billions of shots now they're complaining

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:41.160
about double stranded DNA being a contaminant but in reality it's also endotoxin and in reality

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:46.840
it's also the fact that transfection in its purest form would have been devastating to healthy humans

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:50.920
and that's why they're getting the results they do they can use these clones to pass it on

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:56.920
laboratories to store it in freezers to make more of it and industrial quantities and that means

02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:02.920
that you could use infectious RNA clones to seed the molecular biology of a pandemic knowing full

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.800
well that RNA doesn't go around the world by itself and infectious clones can be made in

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:12.840
industrial quantities if you wanted to so that you could seed all of the sewers around the world

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.600
and you could sequence PCR and you would get the sequences that you wanted to get

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:24.360
basically it's in a magic trip an elaborate magic trick that we have been set up in this paper

02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:32.840
from 2019 shows very clearly the magic trick because by using non PCR requiring sequencing

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:38.760
reactions by looking at this stuff using nanopore sequencing they found exactly the same subgenomic

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:44.360
RNA distribution that they found in previous papers using gels what that means is is that

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:52.120
RNAs don't make a lot of high fidelity copies of themselves almost none and so the infectious

02:10:52.120 --> 02:11:01.160
cycle that they show us in cartoons is completely in 100% wrong and likely Robert Malone slipped

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:07.160
up early in 2021 and told that blonde girl in the UK the naturopath the thing that he wasn't

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:13.800
supposed to say which is the infectious cycle is an illusion an illusion that we already knew

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:21.240
from decades ago was true little tiny little tiny band of RNA right there that's it just a

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:28.040
little tiny band the big bands are all subgenomic RNAs and so the viral swarm may even be an illusion

02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:33.080
of sorts the viral swarm is a discussion we don't have to have if the vast majority of these particles

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:38.760
have very subgenomic RNAs and it's only when we sequence them as a group do we get a consensus

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:45.640
genome that we call an RNA coronavirus but the consensus genome is actually built up artificially

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.840
using the kind of techniques that were pioneered by Nathan Wolf to pull something out of a noisy

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.720
background it's not even a noisy background it's just noise and that's why they want to make diffuse

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.840
real again why they keep trying to make it real again and they've even got jickey leeks

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:08.440
saying stuff about the diffuse proposal as being real has opposed to be an elaborate hoax

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.000
because of course it's an elaborate hoax they didn't ever expect to have to do it

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.160
and if they did it was because they knew they were going to do the scooby-doo mystery thing

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.880
they were going to pretend that this was an ongoing solving thing we need to make RNA clones

02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:33.880
real again ladies and gentlemen we need everybody to understand that that's really where

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:39.560
virology starts so a trackable gain of function RNA went endemic is a lie

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.640
and of course transfection worked but it's but it but it is it is contaminated is a lie

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:55.000
and of course that's why we talk about transfection all academic biologists should have

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.680
already known it's been used for decades on the lab bench even in the purest form it would have

02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:03.160
been inappropriate for healthy humans because it causes an autoimmune reaction because it's

02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.160
chemically altered and codon optimized means we don't know how long it will last or whether

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:13.560
it will contribute to any malformated proteins or even misfolding proteins which can have all kinds

02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:18.040
of consequences that don't have anything to do with them causing other proteins to

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:23.080
misfold in a pre and eugenics sort of way the use of RNA producer the common methods we just

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.800
talked about was also a problem the RNA was already impure because uh because Kevin McCurtain came

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:35.000
on my show to say that already in 2022 the endotoxins could have been known DNA of contamination is

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.120
just another thing and the nanoparticle carriers are also dangerous and they've known this from

02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:44.680
the beginning and no one's talking about it that could be the mitochondrial damage that could be

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:50.120
the DNA damage that could be any number of things that they are trying to misconstrue as being due

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:57.480
to the adulteration etc and so again the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and dangerous than

02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:02.360
the spread of any RNA molecule I only have a few more minutes how spike protein was a pre and I

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.880
was a pre-on or something like that is something that some people were selling very early and now

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:12.520
some people are doubling down on as the worst case scenario if you're not familiar pre-ons

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.600
are these proteins that can apparently fold incorrectly and then cause other proteins to fold

02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:22.520
incorrectly but somehow google fold the the the animation in the background doesn't seem to know

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:28.280
how this process would work and even though we understand that the structure of a the tertiary

02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.480
structure of a protein is largely dependent on its sequence somehow or another the sequence of

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:38.520
protein of pre-ons can cause other proteins to fold differently or something I don't know

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:43.960
or it's just the pre-on protein that gets caused to fold differently these kinds of of

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.760
intellectual conversations are becoming even more and more vapid because people are starting to talk

02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:55.480
about how amyloid protein can also cause the formation of more amyloid because amyloid causes

02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:01.160
more amyloid or something like this without any molecular basis in reality other than there's more

02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:08.280
protein in certain stages of a given pathology so we are we are digging very deep before we start

02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:13.640
these mini courses because we're not going to make any any big mistakes when we do this we're going

02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.280
to be pretty certain we know what we're talking about so that we can really end this charade

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:21.880
once and for all and that means we're going to have to go all the way back to the Nobel Prize

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.840
in medicine we're going to have to look at several reviews and we're going to have to look at Stanley

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:32.280
Prusner's original papers which we will do tomorrow they've changed the way you think about

02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:37.160
the background they've changed the way you think about the background they've changed the way you

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:43.800
think about the background and led you to believe that before 2020 there wasn't a background they've

02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:49.640
led you to believe very differently about the immune system and focused on antibodies for nearly

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:55.640
30 years they've led you to believe so much that that antibodies are important that they can't even

02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:01.000
adequately describe how they are created and in fact that they are a process that is that is

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.280
involving linked recognition they don't even have that in their in their vocabulary none of these

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.400
people want to talk about how they've changed the way we think about vaccination to mean basically

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:17.960
anything that's intramuscularly injected in the context of a disease we need to fight back against

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:24.600
this mythology because they have been doing this for decades they set us up we were set up over

02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:29.000
decades and these people are participating and if we don't expose it as a lie it will become the

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:34.280
truth that is for absolute certain that's what a lot of these people are still involved with

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:39.000
they don't want to get bit someone else was going to do it if they didn't do it that's their excuse

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.840
and that's why this illusion of consensus about a worst-case scenario is going to continue

02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:48.840
ladies and gentlemen you can watch the rest of that on your own if you'd like

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:56.760
