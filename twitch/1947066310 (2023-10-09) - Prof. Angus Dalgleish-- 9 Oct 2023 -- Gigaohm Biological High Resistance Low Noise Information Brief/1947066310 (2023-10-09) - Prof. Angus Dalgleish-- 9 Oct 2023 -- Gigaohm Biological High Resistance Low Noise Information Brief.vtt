01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
How can the good guys win? I think we got to learn the biology.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I had my headphones off all day today. I need to adjust the quality.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I apologize for this. A little bit over the top here.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
There we go. A little better there.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000

.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
I always used to think that Mark used a tonic cytos, so I was usually trying to figure out

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
what kind of swelling or disease that was. I never understood that it was ITS as an end for really long time.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I kept seeing cytos. On to time of cytos.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
I know it's dumb, but it's true.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It's scheduled for six minutes.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I never thought.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
You know.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It's going on French, British, Italian...

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's smooth, it's a Japanese television.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I was just thinking...

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
You've been everywhere.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Some kind of swelling.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's embarrassing.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
But there's still one thing on top.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
What happened to the real mummy?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
He's doing some of the mummy.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Ahhh!

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, we're here!

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I found the mummy!

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, gang, I guess that wraps up the mystery and the mummy, too.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Oh, we're here!

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't know if you're joking or not.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Can we do a full episode of the Scooby Doo sometime?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm not sure if you're serious.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But yeah, eventually we're going to have to again.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
We haven't recapped the whole thing in a long time,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
so I do think it's probably a pretty good idea,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
but recapping that really means we're going back to immunology 101

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
and then putting immunology 101

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
where it was when we set it when.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Because that's really what's important.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Because what...

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
What very few people got right from the very beginning,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
we actually did get right here.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
And that would be the immunology.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I stand pretty solid on those rounds.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm sure I'm the first person to have really,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
succinctly and yet in-depth enough capture

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
the early coronavirus literature to the extent to it.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
You can see that T-cell immunity was understood to be paramount

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
or primary in the response to that antibodies were irrelevant.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And that proved true here again.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
But it's not a matter of what is true,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
but it's a matter of what's perceived to be true.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And that's the reason why misleading the young about antibodies

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
with Saturday Night Live and misleading our grandparents

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
about immunology on the nightly news isn't cool.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
But right now we've gone beyond this.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
We're now really tricking people into accepting their slavery.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Tricking people into...

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
People aren't doing the work that's necessary to remember

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
and learn and remember our history.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
We need to start doing that again.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Or we won't get the power back from these challenges.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That's for sure.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I see the bricks in the back of the theater,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and I think a lot of us here also.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Stop lying!

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
This is Giga Home Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
brought to you by a biologist the 9th of October,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
9th of October, 2023.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Good evening.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Welcome to the show.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
This is Giga Home Biological.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
It's getting cold back here in the garage.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And so occasionally you may hear a heater fire up,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
which just sounds a little bit more like Starship background noise.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
But since we're not always going to be on the Starship,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
it's going to seem a little weird.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Don't take the bait on TV and social media.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It's getting pretty hard.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm not going to speculate about anything to do with anything much farther

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
than about 20 miles away from my house unless it has to do with biology.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
And since it's not much biology going out in the Middle East right now,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I think I'm going to keep my mouth shut about that.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Suffice it to say that I'm aware that things are getting hairy.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm aware that we're going to be challenged in the coming months.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
That's for danger.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And it's going to be nice to know that you've got family and friends

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and neighbors and people to count on.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
And if you don't, you know, maybe it's a good time to start thinking about

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
reconnecting with those around you.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
The outside sounds that are behind me are actually

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
just barely crickets out there.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
We had a couple of cold nights where they were silent.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
The Scooby-Doo is still on.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And I still believe that a lot of these people have misled us

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
from the very beginning about the worst-case scenario,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
and it's inevitable possibility in the future.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I believe that they were involved in making sure that those windows

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
of possibility stayed open in everyone's mind

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
so that there was sufficient room for giant fear,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
giant uncertainty, giant doubt,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
and with an orchestrated presentation across social networks

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
and across media, they were able to convince people of biology

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
that doesn't really exist.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
And that is very different than saying that there aren't viruses.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
It's very different than saying that the PCR test doesn't work

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
or something like that.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
We have a very well nuanced understanding of where we think

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
our hypothesis is.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
So welcome to the show.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
If you haven't been here before,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
it's your first time finding us.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
It's going to be a little hard to jump in on this particular show

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
because we're not going to really cover what we've been talking

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
about with regard to what is perceived to be true and how

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
what is perceived to be true has come to be.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
But if you are just joining us for the first time,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
suffice it to say that we've been working on a hypothesis

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
where state actors and non-government organizations

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
like maybe the WEF or SEPI or the WHO

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
or other organizations that I'm sure lots of people can name

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
have a stake in the idea that the entire globe or the population

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
of the globe, the huge portion of the population of the globe

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
across cultures, across national borders,

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
takes on the mythology that in 2020 somewhere in the world

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
originated an RNA sequence which was capable of infecting the world

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
and changing the way that commerce is done,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
changing the way that we track goods and services,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
changing the way that we perceive our role,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
our place within mother nature on this planet.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
And so I would argue that almost everybody that we thought

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
was a good guy trying to solve the puzzle,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
a good guy trying to solve the mystery,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
a good guy trying to save us from these bad people

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
who are making profit off of this emergency

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
were actually part of an elaborate theater

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
designed to entice all of us,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
whether we were on the left or the right,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
whether we were progressive or conservative,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
to entice all of us into trying to solve this mystery

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
of whether this was a lab leak or a natural virus

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and whether it was to blame on China or America

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
or a combination of both or did they fund one another

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
and somebody made a mistake or what happened and who's lying about it?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And coming to the understanding that the lies were orchestrated,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
that the theater was orchestrated,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
that the email leaks were orchestrated,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
that the leaked Slack messages were orchestrated,

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
and even the leaked grant proposals could have been orchestrated.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
It's even possible that a lot of the papers

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
that are purported to be evidence for this pandemic potential

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
and coronaviruses that exist primarily in three caves in China

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
is actually also largely a potential created by those publications,

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
which in reality are not some kind of, you know,

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
bedrock of proof for the potential for a unique RNA sequence

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
to be able to do something that most all other RNA sequences

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
are nowhere, can even approach doing.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
But again, it's not what's a matter true,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
it's a matter of what's perceived to be true,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
and this illusion of consensus around the biology of RNA

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
and the illusion of consensus around the biology of a pandemic,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
that yeah, of course there's these viruses.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
Of course, we can potentially make a virus that could kill more people

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
than a nuclear weapon and could go around the world for three years,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
could be an incapacitating agent because of its super high infectivity,

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
because we added five amino acids to the final sequence of the protein.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
And when we really think about this,

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
when we really think about the idea that a fear and cleavage site,

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
which actually whose functionality only manifests in the protein

13:44.000 --> 13:51.000
that it is encoding, could ever increase the fidelity of copying of the RNA.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
Because one of the reasons why a fear and cleavage site would potentially be so wonderful

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
is that it would be reproduced and it would stay in the virus

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
or stay in the swarm represented quite strongly

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
for many, many, many, many, many subsequent infections,

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
but as we've discussed, the quasi-species swarm doesn't allow for that,

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
and as we have discussed, if this is not a functional part of the spike protein,

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
which would greatly decrease the fitness of the virus progeny,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
then the presence or absence of the fear and cleavage site won't really matter that much,

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
but the crazy part is, is that it won't change the fidelity of the copy procedure.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And since it doesn't change the copying procedure,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
there's no reason to believe that because of a fear and cleavage site,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
pandemic potential would emerge.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Because what people have confused with pandemic potential is fidelity.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
In order for what to have happened, according to all of these people who have almost all written books

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
or made some kind of fame or fortune or comfort from the virus,

15:06.000 --> 15:16.000
have sold the idea that a particular RNA sequence is able to infect hundreds and hundreds of millions of people,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
and that it's highly trackable because of this fidelity.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
And this has never occurred before in the history, in the history,

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
this has never occurred before in the history of RNA viruses.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Now, some people will try to tell you the story that, well, we can sequence them so easy now,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
or we try it so hard now, that's why.

15:40.000 --> 15:51.000
But that's insufficient answer for what we understood before the pandemic with regard to variability of RNA replication

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
and the fidelity of the, or lack of fidelity within the quasi-species swarm,

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
or the quasi-species, I'm not sure really which term is correct.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
But that extreme variability that's present because of the thing that we've discussed a few times in a row now,

16:08.000 --> 16:16.000
the original genome is very quickly outweighed and replaced in the copy procedure

16:16.000 --> 16:27.000
by incomplete genomes, subgenomic gene RNA, and genomes with errors, genomes with changes.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
And so the idea that this single genome like Omicron gets copied over and over and over and over and over again,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
that's not real.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
Because at the very best case scenario, three changes are made every time there's a copy,

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
and that copy doesn't just immediately get packed into a new virus and popped out.

16:49.000 --> 17:00.000
It floats around, and it's part of the growing amount of RNA that is interfering with this original RNA getting copied.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
And you can find countless papers discussing this phenomenon and how what it leads to,

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
which is including recombination of coronaviruses with one another

17:12.000 --> 17:23.000
when the RNA-dependent polymerase drops from template to template when more than one template of a coronavirus is present.

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
Ralph Beric and his co-author Ralph Denison have argued that as many as 35% of all the coronavirus is present

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
in a co-infection, in a cell culture, are recombinant genomes.

17:41.000 --> 17:51.000
In some respects, that's mathematically very close to the recombinant, the frequency of recombination that's present in flu,

17:51.000 --> 18:04.000
although as you know, flu has a disjointed genome and so recombination is a different mechanism there.

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
John Campbell and Angus Daglesch, I'm going to play it at 1.25, maybe 1.5.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
It's a really important interview to listen to because they talk a lot about immunology.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
The immunology is basically what we've been saying with some changes which, of course, could be completely correct.

18:26.000 --> 18:36.000
And so most of my plan is not to interrupt, but just to take notes and then maybe make a little summary at the end of what I took notes on,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
what I saw and what I'm going to look up or try to follow up on.

18:39.000 --> 18:51.000
I believe that this guy is a cancer dude, so he may talk about the genes, he may talk about T cells, he may talk about normal cancer

18:51.000 --> 19:00.000
and re-emergent cancer, I have no idea, I just know that a lot of people, I mean way more than normal,

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
and then also Pamela sent me this video, so now I really have to watch it, and since I need to really know what I was going to do,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
this became the very easy choice.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
You're quite an important one, and I'm so pleased to welcome Professor Angus Dalglish, Professor Welcome, and thank you for coming.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Thank you.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Now Professor Dalglish is a professor at St George's University London.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm not going to go through all of his qualifications, but he's a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in the UK and Australia.

19:32.000 --> 19:40.000
He's a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists, he's a Fellow of Medical Sciences as well as having an MD medical research degree.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
He's really quite impressive, and he's had 563 publications, I don't know how you fit that in one lifetime, but that's what he's had with over 25,000 citations.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
I believe Professor you're still working as a cancer doctor, you're a consultant oncologist.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I am indeed, yes.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
Now, what's concerning you at the moment, there's some observations that you've been making that are concerning,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
just if you don't mind, tell us about your observations and what your concerns are.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, I began to notice, I've been doing that onoma patients for over two decades and probably three.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Can you hear that?

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
He said melanoma in case you didn't hear that, it's a little tinny or something, I'll see if I can adjust this sound.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
Longer than I can think, and I started working with these patients because nobody else wanted to work with them,

20:24.000 --> 20:33.000
because they were very difficult, they didn't respond to chemotherapy, and so I was very interested in the history of immunotherapies working.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
So, I basically immersed myself in this and started doing the first cancer vaccines,

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
first of all, collaboration with Don Morten of Cancer Vax and John Wayne Institute in California,

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
and I was the only collaborator outside the US for a set of many years,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
and then I started working with a whole range of cancer vaccines,

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
and the ones that I'm most interested in, the ones that have stood the test the time are actually the simplest,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
the heat-kill micomaterial ones, etc.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
So, while doing this work, I began to notice things that, you know,

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
why did some people respond very well, and others not, I won't go into the details,

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
but it was, the first thing was clearly it was a vitamin D, we suddenly realized we were dealing with endemic vitamin D deficiency,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
and if you corrected it, they started to respond better to immunotherapy, etc.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
So, I've had some patients on immunotherapy for several years,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
long before the new immunotherapies were approved, the hippielemies and the nillows and pembroves, etc.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
And I started to notice that some of these patients, they were coming up to, you know,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
they were over 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, they were suddenly relapsing,

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
and they were presenting with relapse disease after years of not having any disease.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Now, this was not unusual to me because I've seen it before, but I always wanted to know why.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Of course.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
These are patients with malignant melanoma, malignant skin cancers.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
I noticed that the patients had relaxed before, they all had a history of reason of something which caused

22:01.000 --> 22:11.000
a significant period of immune suppression, such as, you know, a significant upset, bereavement, divorce, bankruptcy, etc.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
And I saw it, but there was an explanation for it.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
Now, more recently, I saw, I started to see it in more patients than I was used to in a short period of time.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
First of all, it was six patients I counted who all came and they'd had to have another lump out yet to investigate and found it,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
got relaps, etc.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
And I started to ask the question, you know, have you had bereavement, divorce, and certainly other?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And then it, it tweaked.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
They'd all told me that they'd, they'd, I've had my booster,

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
I've kept up to play with my boosters and it suddenly began to tweak because I was very against the booster program.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I put it quite, quite basically.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
I've done over 30 years research into optimizing vaccines and immune response.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
And I, I came to the conclusion that the vaccines that they use are obsessed with antibodies.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
And I'm not, actually, I'm not interested in antibodies because it's the T cell response that you want.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It is the innate T cell response.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
And as a cancer doctor, I noticed that the innate T cell response starts to decline at 55.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And by 70, it's fairly much in your boots. It's gone down the big ski slope.

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
But if you superimpose the rise of cancer treatments, it rises at the opposite rate, forming like a butterfly wing.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
So it started to last as a cause and effect.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
And then we found that we had an agent such as this, the new one we worked with for a long time,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
IMM 101, he killed, it really boosted the innate immune response.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
This is just a simple bacteria that's been killed and rejected.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
I mean, it's, it's the, it's the other end of BCG and it came out of BCG work.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
And it's very interesting is that BCG, it was found to boost the innate immune response.

23:55.000 --> 24:04.000
And here's the clue, if you give it more than twice, it basically starts to ruin the response and just boost sanding.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
So did this BCG was used to prevent tuberculosis?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
BCG vaccine tuberculosis.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Now the heat kill micabacteria, they don't do this.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
If you keep giving them, they keep boosting the T cell response.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
They don't induce an antibody response. So that's kill mice and just boost sanding.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
So did this BCG was used to prevent tuberculosis?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
BCG vaccine tuberculosis.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Now the heat kill micabacteria, they don't do this.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
If you keep giving them, they keep boosting the T cell response.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
They don't induce an antibody response.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
So as such, I thought this is a very useful agent.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I've been doing clinical trials on it.

24:38.000 --> 24:50.000
And one of the things I did notice right at the beginning of the COVID was the patients are already telling me that, well, they're often their wife or husband would say, I don't know what it does for the cancer.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
But I've never seen them go through winters and not have colds of blues all the time.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
They seem absolutely fit.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
And then I realized this is the innate ingredient response.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
So I predicted this would be a very good frontline for COVID.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
And sure enough, it was at the height of the first wave where there's no vaccines mentioned.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
None of these patients call COVID.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
And yet their average age was all over 65 as the average.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And they all were at risk as they had stage all melanoma.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
They had a full thing.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
None of them got ill.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
They might have had a very mild COVID where other people all around were going down very badly with COVID, mainly the staff.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
So these are people in your trial professor that were simply giving this microbacterial, very simple, killed bacteria vaccine.

25:31.000 --> 25:39.000
And even though it's a specific form of bacteria you were giving, it was stimulating an innate immune response that was working against a wide variety of different viruses.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
So you got it in one.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
So that was the environment I was in.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And then we come up with the vaccine comes in.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And as I said, I had a lot of experience in this.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
And I came to the conclusion, if you need to give more than two shots of vaccine, it doesn't work.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
That'll be one of my general rules of vaccine.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And I think that's been proven to be absolutely right.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
They've been the mooseless and worse than mooseless.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
And they shouldn't.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
They should never have been given.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
If they were going to be considered, they should only be given to people who you knew their immune status.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
You should have mentioned it.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I went on to a TV live debate with other doctors.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
And I said, why the hell would you give a booster to a vaccine that people have already had without measuring if the response was satisfactory?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Because they might not need it.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Because if they do not need it, you'll make things worse.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
And that was from the PCG example to name but one.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
So people just dismiss me.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
They wouldn't enter into proper debate about this.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
They said this is an emergency.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
No, it wasn't an emergency.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Because the next thing I realized, especially when the people who had the boosters were actually often saying,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
well, I never had the COVID till I had the last booster.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And it all sorts of clues like this.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
But it was in this group who were getting the relapses.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
They all mentioned they were having the boosters as if they'd done the right thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And I suddenly explained, I thought it's the booster that's leading to the relapse.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
And as a scientist, I wanted to know what the reason for that is.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Well, I know that you've only got a limited capacity in your immune system.

27:00.000 --> 27:08.000
If you boost with another vaccine to harness half the immune system to make antibodies

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
to a virus that no longer exists on the planet, probably for one or even two years,

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
you're going to weaken it.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You're going to reduce the front line.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
And then we got the papers coming up that beautifully confirmed it.

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
They showed that the booster, you no longer make ITG-1 and 3 neutralizing antibodies.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
You get a subtype switch to ITG-4.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
There's a very detailed, excellent paper showing this.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Well, an ITG-4 subtype is the last one because it's more of a taller agenda.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
And it basically said, I don't have enough of this abuse.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
We're switching off.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
There's a salt on us with these agents.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
But it gets worse because it also suppresses the T-cell response.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
And there were some people who did a really nice study.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
I can't remember it offhand, but I actually presented it in the presentation I dig easily.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
The first group who showed that the T-cell response crashes after the booster in cancer patients.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
Whereas it's not perturbed in the first two, but the booster,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
these do a massive reduction in the T-cell response.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Not in all of them, but in many of them.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
Well, to me, this was enough because we know, for immunotherapy,

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
I knew from my work of home 20 years before we started using these checkpoint inhibitors,

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
it'd be a demo, et cetera, that the T-cell controlled this disease

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
because I only saw relapses when there was a reason for perturbation.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Now we had a booster that was clearly causing perturbation,

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
which if it was transient, I wouldn't mind, but it was a lot more than transient,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
especially when the patient said, well, I've had five vaccines.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
I mean, I was beginning to scream, what are they doing?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
What do I do?

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And I reported all this to various medians.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I wrote it to, I wrote a paper to the people.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
Okay, let's take a break there because it was going fast.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm sure for everybody.

28:53.000 --> 29:10.000
Let me just come back over here and grab a older PowerPoint presentation from 2021.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
And see if we can't just shed a little light on this.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
So here's a slide from 2021.

29:20.000 --> 29:31.000
And we talked about T-cells may offer lasting protection against COVID-19.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
This was July 28th, 2020.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
And I'd already been using this pretty much since August, I think of 2020.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
The reason why this was pretty dubious is because language in titles in science matters.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
And if anybody understands that Dr. Francis Collins does who wrote this blog.

29:51.000 --> 30:00.000
And in choosing the immune T-cells may offer lasting protection against COVID-19,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
he leaves the door open for maybe they don't.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Maybe it's not T-cells.

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
But of course, he knew already that in 2014,

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
there was a paper about CDA T-cells providing substantial protection from lethal coronavirus

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
disease done by none other than Stanley Pearlman,

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
the preeminent expert of coronaviruses at Iowa in the United States,

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
sitting on several committees, including the who advisory committee on coronavirus.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
And he would have known that in 2010,

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
Stanley Pearlman demonstrated that T-cells responses are required, but antibodies aren't.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
Required.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Required.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
So there would have been no reason based on the previous mountain of coronavirus biology

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
in the literature to assume that T-cells weren't important,

31:05.000 --> 31:13.000
but to assume that they were the thing required.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
And of course, you and I learned that this is how the immune system works.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
The T-cells and their orchestration and all their different kinds,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
and all those different kinds,

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
crescendo and decrescendo, the immune response, that's really how it works.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
B-cells are more puppets than anything else.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
And this is really unfortunate that this illusion,

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
and it is an illusion of consensus that we don't know what's going on.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
We have no idea what will happen with this coronavirus, but they knew.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
Ten years before the pandemic, they already knew that virus-specific T-cells were vital.

32:02.000 --> 32:14.000
So we see this pretty cool super-fast revealing sort of lecture

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
about how heat-killed mycobacterium is the best cancer vaccine out there.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
It originates in BCG work, which I don't know what BCG work is.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
We're going to have to do all kinds of stuff.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm going to have to work really hard.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I've got a lot of other things to do, too.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
He had identified a endemic vitamin D deficiency already long ago,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
and he already knew that this helped with people with this skin cancer

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
that he's talking about, this melanoma.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
Relapse occurred often during stress or bereavement was the word he used several times,

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
and that could be marriage or divorce or death in the family.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
And in the pandemic, he correlated relapse with the booster vaccine,

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
and he didn't correlate it, repeat, he did not correlate a relapse

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
with the first two shots, but now with the boosters.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Now it would be interesting to know whether or not the majority of the people

33:13.000 --> 33:20.000
that he's calling boosted would have had AstraZeneca or Pfizer or Moderna,

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
because in the UK is one of the few places where AstraZeneca was rolled out

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
pretty widely.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
And so it's possible that these people are a very unique experiment

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
where they had been first transformed to the spike and then transfected to the spike.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Yee.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
No offense to if that's you.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
He's not at all interested in antibodies.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
That was a really cool.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I don't think you can see my arrow, can you?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
You have to use this thing then.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
He's not interested at all in antibodies.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
That was a really nice statement for him to make.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And he said, you know, the T cells do everything.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
That's really what we knew.

34:01.000 --> 34:09.000
But interestingly, he did say that he killed mycobacterium vaccine that is used to treat

34:09.000 --> 34:16.000
this melanoma in these patients can be used to repeatedly activate T cells.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
It can.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
These patients didn't get COVID.

34:20.000 --> 34:27.000
So when they were being treated with this, this heat activated, heat killed

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
mycobacterium vaccine, which I guess is an activator for the immune system during this

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
to treat cancer, also protected them from COVID.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Interesting, right?

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
So he argues that they should have known the immune status of people before boosting.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Well, that's of course, that's of course true.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
And if they were infected, then they should have never gotten another vaccine again.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
That's also very true.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
But people are doing it.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
People are getting sicker because they're getting COVID or whatever it is that overlaps

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
with the RNA that they're, that they're transfecting us to, the protein that they're

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
transfecting us to.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
And I don't purport to understand it, but understand that there are a number of

35:13.000 --> 35:21.000
there's a

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
sorry, I had to hear what was going on back there.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
There's a, there's a number of different mechanisms by which this could be going wrong.

35:31.000 --> 35:39.000
And so we just need to understand that as he said repeatedly, repeated exposure doesn't

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
mean good.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
And when we were talking last night with Drew Weismann's lecture about how with

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
mRNA in an LNP, we got 50 fold more antibodies.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, if you, if you let this guy listen to that guy say we got 50 fold more antibodies,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I think this professor would lose his mind.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
And he would like stop the whole prefer, he would hope he would stop the whole

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
presentation and be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

36:12.000 --> 36:21.000
Hey, Drew Weismann, like, why do you think some antibodies good, more antibodies better?

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
You know, truckloads of antibodies are, are, are fantastic.

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
Why, why is that what, what, what biological evidence do you have that any

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
homeostatic mechanism in a pattern integrity works like that?

36:38.000 --> 36:47.000
What, what enzymatic chain of proteins working together works better the more of one of

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
those that you have.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Because that's what an antibody is.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
It is a part of a system of signaling in the immune system.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
And having more and more and more of it will eventually lead to an imbalance that will be

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
maladaptive.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
Having more and more cells in the immune system focused on that protein or that set of

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
epitopes or whatever happens after that happens when you transfect someone cannot always be

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
good.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
And if what happens is what Drew Weismann showed us in that talk yesterday,

37:27.000 --> 37:34.000
that your lymph nodes are completely full of cells that are transfected, we don't know

37:34.000 --> 37:41.000
how to transfect T cells usefully.

37:41.000 --> 37:49.000
And anyone claiming that we know how to transfect T cells usefully to augment the immune system

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
without throwing off anything that it's doing that we're not aware of.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Let me repeat that again.

37:57.000 --> 38:04.000
We're not capable of augmenting the immune system with the specificity with the tinkering

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
accuracy to not accidentally mess with all the other things that the immune system has

38:11.000 --> 38:17.000
brought into balance in our lives.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
Ignoring the antigens on strawberries, ignoring the antigens on your favorite processed foods,

38:24.000 --> 38:32.000
ignoring the antigens present in your favorite box cereal, ignoring the antigens in your

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
cleaning products.

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
Your immune system works really, really hard if you don't have something wrong with your

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
skin or you don't have something wrong with your gut.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
You've been doing very well and protecting it, very well and augmenting it.

38:50.000 --> 38:58.000
But most likely if you've lived in America your whole life, your immune system is a wreck.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
And it's really interesting what this guy says because it is this illusion that there's nothing

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
to fix, that there's this illusion that there's nothing to bring back into balance.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
There's this illusion that there's nothing you can do.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Just take the vaccine.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
When it might be better for you to lose weight to eat better, to stop drive-throughs, to stop

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
eating out of a box or a bag, it might be better to do those things than it would be to

39:26.000 --> 39:35.000
transfect yourself because those things actually will usefully augment your immune system.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And that's really the trick.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
He also pointed to the subtype switch to IG4 which suppresses the T cell response.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
He looked a little bit into that.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
It seems to be that the people on the other side of the argument want to tell you that

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
IG4 does nothing.

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
It's like a no functional FC portion of the antibody so it does nothing.

39:58.000 --> 40:06.000
But it's hard for me to really imagine that the immune system has developed IG4 as a way,

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
IG4, excuse me, as a way of doing nothing.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
That seems to be quite wasteful.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
And so more than likely it does do something.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
And suppress the T cell response makes sense because the T cell response being suppressed

40:24.000 --> 40:32.000
by a smaller antibody, I don't know if it makes sense because it's a smaller antibody.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
It's because it, where it is in that progression that it seems to go from IgM to IgG, IgG1,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
3, IgG4.

40:41.000 --> 40:49.000
So if it is the one after repeated exposure, it does definitely make sense that it's tolerance.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
And the tolerance would be expressed by a T cell response that's dampened.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
Okay, I'm sorry, I just figured I had to say something.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
BMJ.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
I thought the BMJ had actually started to publicize things which are a little bit, you know,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
concerning to doctors rather than censor it.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
And basically I found, you know, I was the first in the UK to point out that the virus escaped

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
from the lab.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
And to me it was completely obvious because it had inserts in it that one of them could

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
occur naturally, not six or around the receptor binding site, no, that wasn't.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
And for my pains pointing this out, I thought this is brilliant.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
This is brilliant, we can challenge the nature of the sites.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
Every single general turned down papers pointing all this out saying it's not in the public

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
interest.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I mean, basically this was a normal one.

41:38.000 --> 41:46.000
Okay, so one possibility is that he is one of these many people who was right, that the

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
sequence of the virus that was released is a sequence that indicates that it was a lab

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
virus and that these extra things that they put in the protein of the spike protein into

41:57.000 --> 42:03.500
the protein that is the spike protein, these extra little things made it somehow possible

42:03.500 --> 42:10.280
for the RNA that encodes for it to circle the globe for three and a half years.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.280
That seems to be what he believes.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.800
And so we've got to be aware of where this guy's immunology is awesome and then where

42:17.800 --> 42:22.800
it's like, wait, do you understand what you're saying?

42:22.800 --> 42:31.440
And so the sequence that was released made it seem like it was a lab leak.

42:31.440 --> 42:38.040
Not all of the sequences, not all of the sequences, the sequence that was released at the beginning

42:38.040 --> 42:44.840
of the pandemic and how many of these inserts has he kept track of?

42:44.840 --> 42:49.640
How many of these inserts do we know are still there or not there?

42:49.640 --> 42:52.120
Who's keeping track of that?

42:52.120 --> 42:58.120
And if they are so important and yet so easy for someone to find, if they have the sequence

42:58.120 --> 43:02.800
of the virus, why in the hell aren't some of these people keeping track of these sequences

43:02.800 --> 43:10.520
so that we can sort of correlate their appearance or disappearance with the veracity of the infection,

43:10.520 --> 43:15.640
with the infectivity of the virus, with the gain of function attributes that must certainly

43:15.640 --> 43:25.800
be present if there's six of these things around the receptor binding domain of the virus.

43:25.800 --> 43:33.240
Well, the administrative truth has taken over.

43:33.240 --> 43:38.240
This is after you've had 563 previous papers published over a distinguished career.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.160
I can't think of a doctor who's more qualified than you offhand actually, so after a distinguished

43:42.160 --> 43:46.440
career and all this work, you could get published any more.

43:46.440 --> 43:53.360
Well, it's not actually the quantity that there's a quality issue, too, I would say.

43:53.360 --> 43:57.880
And I've never really wanted to publish things that were at least the time were irrelevant

43:57.880 --> 44:05.600
but to add to stories, I've had a lot of stories, I had a big presence in HIV and I discovered

44:05.600 --> 44:10.280
the receptor that it was the first author of colleagues doing it and that led to me being

44:10.280 --> 44:15.960
very recognised as a serious virologist and scientist, which to me was very surprising.

44:15.960 --> 44:21.000
I was at all the early HIV meetings and I've upped into people, I mean, after I was a guest

44:21.000 --> 44:25.560
at Bon Gallo and I had bumped into Fauci with Fabio and all the others and I thought, well,

44:25.560 --> 44:29.080
these guys really, at the field, was talking about publications, they were publishing in

44:29.080 --> 44:33.800
nature and science and they took three weeks in a bit to me and I was just lucky to get

44:33.840 --> 44:37.880
one or two in it, it just seemed to me that they were kind of god's must and it took me

44:37.880 --> 44:44.200
quite a while before I realised, actually, no, they're not, and I came to the conclusion

44:44.200 --> 44:48.320
and I was saying this because it's in my personal opinion that Fauci is not very bright.

44:48.320 --> 44:52.360
He thinks he is, he's a very good diplomat, he's actually not very bright because I pointed

44:52.360 --> 44:57.480
out that in sessions when he'd share that, is you'll never get the HIV vaccine if you

44:57.480 --> 45:03.160
use the entire envelope, the 3,000 antigens of it, you throw that as an antigen after

45:03.160 --> 45:10.440
the new response, it's going to pick out the dominant responses and the viruses evolve

45:10.440 --> 45:14.480
that the dominant responses will be against the bits of it, it doesn't give a damn about

45:14.480 --> 45:19.600
and I also predict is that it's a decoy, that their Achilles heel buys at the heart of

45:19.600 --> 45:25.080
this and by giving the whole envelope, you'll never allow the body to see the Achilles heel,

45:25.080 --> 45:28.240
we worked it out, I won't go into that but that's a big chunk of papers that I did which

45:28.240 --> 45:32.240
I have never got the recognition that they deserved, I thought they were far more important

45:32.240 --> 45:43.080
than the CD4 receptor but, I mean, I'm just going to rewind it and listen to what he said

45:43.080 --> 45:44.080
again.

45:44.080 --> 45:53.640
Look at that, is you'll never get the HIV vaccine if you use the entire envelope, there's 3,000

45:53.640 --> 45:59.280
antigens of it, you throw that as an antigen after the new response, it's going to pick

45:59.280 --> 46:05.760
out the dominant responses and the viruses evolve that the dominant responses will be

46:05.760 --> 46:09.920
against bits of it, it doesn't give a damn about that and I also predict is that it's

46:09.920 --> 46:16.200
a decoy, that their Achilles heel buys at the heart of this and by giving the whole envelope,

46:16.200 --> 46:20.000
you'll never allow the body to see the Achilles heel, we worked it out, I won't go into that

46:20.000 --> 46:23.880
but that's a big chunk of papers that I did which I have never got the recognition that

46:23.880 --> 46:28.360
they deserved, I thought they were far more important than the CD4 receptor but the wasn't

46:28.360 --> 46:30.760
like this.

46:30.760 --> 46:35.760
Those papers were far more important than they were given recognition for and this was far

46:35.760 --> 46:38.720
more important than the CD4 receptor.

46:38.720 --> 46:49.560
The CD4 receptor is supposedly how the HIV virus infects T cells and he said that the Achilles

46:49.560 --> 46:54.120
heel lies at the heart of this but I don't know what he meant if that meant the envelope

46:54.120 --> 47:08.600
protein or the heart of the HIV virus or what but I hear motivation, I hear an ego,

47:08.600 --> 47:12.800
I don't hear somebody who's trying to blow the whistle, I hear somebody who's more than

47:12.800 --> 47:18.760
trying to blow the whistle, he's trying to blow his own whistle, interesting.

47:18.760 --> 47:24.280
This led to me collaborating and my group with several people, we had a European collaborative

47:24.280 --> 47:29.680
group which we introduced lots of papers and showed that the virus never causes AIDS unless

47:29.680 --> 47:34.280
it activates the immune system first and whether it activates is determined entirely by your

47:34.280 --> 47:39.280
HIV type and those people who know it's sort of tissue genetics you've born with isn't

47:39.280 --> 47:40.280
it?

47:40.280 --> 47:41.280
Absolutely.

47:41.280 --> 47:57.000
He just said that it never causes AIDS in people, it all depends on their HLAs uptime.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.320
Never causes AIDS in people unless it activates their immune system and that depends on HLAs

48:03.320 --> 48:05.320
uptime, I think that's what he said.

48:05.320 --> 48:10.160
We introduced lots of papers and showed that the virus never causes AIDS, the best activates

48:10.160 --> 48:15.440
the immune system first and whether it activates is determined entirely by your HLAs type

48:15.440 --> 48:19.560
and those people who know it's sort of tissue genetics you've born with isn't it?

48:19.560 --> 48:20.560
Absolutely.

48:20.560 --> 48:26.040
Those people who had long-term infection and didn't seem to get ill, we predicted they

48:26.040 --> 48:30.520
must have a certain HIV type and one of the guys that worked with me was very hot on this

48:30.520 --> 48:37.360
actually predicted the HIV type early on from his computations and modelling and the modelling

48:37.360 --> 48:41.200
that's my colleagues and I didn't those days, unlikely people at Imperial College

48:41.200 --> 48:45.120
don't seem to model anything remotely correctly, this turned out to be very true because he

48:45.120 --> 48:51.120
predicted that HIV-8 people would get AIDS quickly and those with HIV-27 would get it

48:51.120 --> 48:56.760
very slowly if this Achilles heel was a bit dry with the disease and it was proven in

48:56.760 --> 49:02.200
a big MRC survey that those were the only two significant things, B-8 plus, B-27, they

49:02.200 --> 49:03.200
hardly get it.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.960
Based on the back of that I predicted, well, there's one group of chapsu that never gets

49:07.960 --> 49:11.680
AIDS however much virus you've given them, that's the chimpanzee, I reckon they must

49:11.680 --> 49:14.240
all be HLA B-27 or similar.

49:14.240 --> 49:18.600
It took five years to persuade that one of the people who had a large chimpanzee colony

49:18.600 --> 49:26.160
to do the HLA, if it were genetic immune codes and they were all HLA B-57 which is sort of

49:26.160 --> 49:31.440
a brother of B-27 so absolutely right and the only conclusion from that was they'd all

49:31.440 --> 49:37.000
been eliminated in the past in the wild by HIV, so you're dealing with a survival

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
population.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.920
We had a big understanding of this and working with my Norwegian colleague who came up with

49:44.920 --> 49:50.120
the same idea, do not use the envelope, too much information, decoy, Achilles et cetera,

49:50.120 --> 49:54.600
he identified four Achilles heels, made them in peptides, asked me to join him because

49:54.600 --> 50:01.040
of immunological expertise and the HIV being in the HIV field, he did that very successful

50:01.040 --> 50:07.160
HIV vaccine, never achieved its primary goal in trials because the primary goal would

50:07.160 --> 50:11.000
be set wrong, had it not been set wrong, it probably would have been much more successful.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.080
We haven't given up, I think this is the best HIV vaccine, but what really got me about

50:16.080 --> 50:22.200
the establishment is that the gates are rescued, the MRC, MRC, they all ask you, and we put

50:22.200 --> 50:26.800
this proposal and said that the envelope vaccines will never ever work because this

50:26.800 --> 50:30.640
certainly will, but this already works, we've had it in humans and it reduces the virus

50:30.640 --> 50:32.040
learned very well.

50:32.040 --> 50:36.880
We want to just modify, optimize it, and we recommend that you be able to give this and

50:36.880 --> 50:40.960
take people off how the HIV trends were for months and months at a time, which should

50:40.960 --> 50:43.400
be tremendous for Africa.

50:43.400 --> 50:47.320
We were always rejected, it's a very clever idea, et cetera, et cetera, but we don't need

50:47.320 --> 50:51.600
a plan B at the moment because we've got a great big worldwide clinical trial and this

50:51.600 --> 50:53.600
looks like it will be positive.

50:54.600 --> 50:59.400
One, two, three, the third time, they still said it be positive, I mean, was it Einstein

50:59.400 --> 51:02.800
who said the definition of an idiot or somebody who keeps studying the same thing expecting

51:02.800 --> 51:03.800
a different answer?

51:03.800 --> 51:05.640
Sounds like the sort of thing he would say, yeah.

51:05.640 --> 51:08.480
So you have HIV vaccine, what is it actually target?

51:08.480 --> 51:13.600
It was targeting the, this is very relevant to COVID by the way, it targeted the nucleus,

51:13.600 --> 51:14.600
not the envelope.

51:14.600 --> 51:20.520
Right, so the proteins in the nucleus of the HIV, it ignored the envelope, we subsequently

51:20.520 --> 51:24.280
optimized it by adding in the one bit that drives the immune activation, which I had

51:24.280 --> 51:28.720
spent years identifying reality and it makes it seem better, so it really works well now.

51:28.720 --> 51:32.760
Now the thing that really annoys the nucleus is not a thing, so I'm not sure what he's

51:32.760 --> 51:33.760
talking about.

51:33.760 --> 51:40.120
Maybe it's the nucleocapsid protein, maybe HIV has a similar protein with a similar name,

51:40.120 --> 51:44.680
but even John Campbell seemed a little confused with the nucleus of what?

51:44.680 --> 51:47.440
This is unfortunate.

51:47.440 --> 51:53.240
It's an awful lot of sales pitch here, and it's a sales pitch for an HIV vaccine that

51:53.240 --> 52:03.960
has four Achilles heels, which are his cartoon version of an epitope or an antigen set.

52:03.960 --> 52:11.720
He seems to get those two things mixed up and antigen can have many epitopes.

52:11.720 --> 52:19.120
You should see it that way, because an epitope is really a very specific word, which describes

52:19.120 --> 52:25.000
the amino acid sequence that the immune system has encoded, either in a T cell receptor or

52:25.000 --> 52:34.520
has presented on MHC2 or has been encoded in a B cell receptor, i.e. antibody.

52:34.520 --> 52:41.080
So don't let that get mixed up for you, because that's something that everybody, when they're

52:41.080 --> 52:47.360
being imprecise gets mixed up, but an antigen is the protein in question.

52:47.360 --> 52:55.120
The antigen in the case of the cartoon transfection is the spike protein, or in the case of a

52:55.120 --> 52:59.080
more realistic transfection, it's a spike protein in whatever fragments are made from

52:59.080 --> 53:04.560
a fragment RNA, and whatever fragments are made when the protein is expressed correctly

53:04.560 --> 53:07.160
or bolded correctly.

53:07.160 --> 53:11.400
That's an antigen, and those antigens can have many epitopes on them, and it's up to

53:11.400 --> 53:16.320
your immune system to select the epitope from the spike protein that it will present to

53:16.320 --> 53:21.320
T cells that it will make antibodies potentially to.

53:21.320 --> 53:25.520
Because if you don't have B cells that recognize a particular part of the spike protein, then

53:25.520 --> 53:29.960
you're not going to have B cells that do that.

53:29.960 --> 53:33.960
So it's a predetermined thing already, and a lot of people don't understand that, that

53:33.960 --> 53:36.640
what you have is there.

53:36.640 --> 53:42.600
And until that B cell gets recruited and given T cell help, it's not going to evolve, it's

53:42.600 --> 53:49.080
genetic identity at all, it's just going to sit there dormant.

53:49.080 --> 53:54.560
So this guy seems to believe, and I correct me if I'm wrong in the chat, but this guy

53:54.560 --> 54:05.400
really seems to believe that two shots were okay.

54:05.400 --> 54:10.560
That seems to be a pretty crazy thing for me, for him to be saying right now, anybody

54:10.560 --> 54:16.360
is saying that the booster was the particular thing, and that no vaccine works if you need

54:16.360 --> 54:19.080
more than two.

54:19.080 --> 54:24.800
So he almost seems to be arguing that the mistake was the booster, and what are we on

54:24.800 --> 54:25.800
in America?

54:25.800 --> 54:27.040
Are we on our fourth or our fifth?

54:27.040 --> 54:31.320
This is a real interesting stance that he's taking here.

54:31.320 --> 54:36.760
I mean, was it Einstein who said the definition of an idiot or somebody who keeps studying

54:36.760 --> 54:38.320
the same thing expecting a different answer?

54:38.320 --> 54:40.440
Sounds like the sort of thing he would say.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.320
So you have HIV vaccine, what does this actually target?

54:43.320 --> 54:48.240
It was targeting the, this is very relevant to COVID by the way, it targeted the nucleus

54:48.240 --> 54:49.240
not the envelope.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.240
Right.

54:50.240 --> 54:54.800
So the proteins in the nucleus of the HIV, it ignored the envelope.

54:54.800 --> 54:58.480
We subsequently optimised it by adding in the one bit that drives the immune activation,

54:58.480 --> 55:03.280
which I have spent years identifying, we added the one bit that drives the immune activation,

55:03.280 --> 55:10.080
the one bit, and we, he's squeezing motion as we added in, we added in the one bit, the

55:10.080 --> 55:18.720
tell is this, darn it, I'm getting upset because this is not the accuracy, and this

55:18.720 --> 55:19.720
is not what I hoped it is.

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
It makes it seem better.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.920
So it really works well now.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.920
Now, the thing that really annoys me was the, or we're talking people spending billions,

55:27.920 --> 55:33.000
I mean, how Genentech was involved in IH, the Gates Foundation, Garvey, IHavi, we approached

55:33.000 --> 55:35.600
them all, and they all brushed us off, we know what we're doing.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.680
And each of those big, he mentioned a lot of players, right?

55:39.760 --> 55:42.920
And each of those big, worldwide vaccine trials, it was the same thing being presented, just

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
different technology.

55:43.920 --> 56:09.600
So it made me realise, do not fall for technology, now, listen to that, because this is what

56:09.600 --> 56:11.680
we hear all the time.

56:11.680 --> 56:16.320
And you know, 10 years ago, it was DNA vaccines, are they going to save the world, this sat in

56:16.320 --> 56:17.320
the other?

56:17.320 --> 56:22.400
They worked brilliantly in mice, and guinea pigs and things, and dogs.

56:22.400 --> 56:25.000
But as soon as you get bigger, the dogs, they do not work.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.960
These are the adeno virus vector.

56:26.960 --> 56:34.760
And so it, then everybody said, RNA is the thing, now don't think RNA is recent, I mean,

56:34.760 --> 56:35.760
this is the other thing.

56:35.840 --> 56:40.920
And when I was giving a thing, saying that I actually blame the RNA technology to make

56:40.920 --> 56:45.680
it the boosters even worse, and people were involved in them, say, the attitude was, well,

56:45.680 --> 56:48.600
what do you, you know, you need to be like what you're talking about, you want to stay

56:48.600 --> 56:55.280
technical, you know, I'm conscious, no, I mean, I sat on the scientific board by a company

56:55.280 --> 57:01.120
that called itself the messenger RNA cancer vaccine company for five years, I left six

57:01.120 --> 57:04.760
or seven years ago, and they had everything in place.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.160
I mean, they weren't able to take it forward.

57:07.160 --> 57:13.440
So the messenger RNA industry has been there waiting for an excuse for a long time.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.160
And I think that's correct.

57:15.160 --> 57:21.320
And he should have been waiting for an excuse to teach you that adenovirus DNA containing

57:21.320 --> 57:28.920
adenoviruses that work in lower animals are called transformations.

57:28.920 --> 57:36.040
And mRNA used in any carrier type form to express proteins in these lower animals has

57:36.040 --> 57:38.040
been called transfection.

57:38.040 --> 57:44.120
Now, I'm really happy with what he said there because it actually brings to mind something

57:44.120 --> 57:49.400
that I should have really pointed out a long time ago.

57:49.400 --> 57:58.320
And that is that we don't understand why it's so difficult to create genetically modified

57:58.960 --> 58:02.600
animals, but it is.

58:02.600 --> 58:07.280
It's easy to do it in mice relative to doing it in rats.

58:07.280 --> 58:13.080
And it's even more difficult to do it in monkeys than it ever would be to do it in rats.

58:13.080 --> 58:17.000
And I'm not even sure if it's possible to do it in monkeys yet.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.560
I would need to look maybe it's possible in some smaller monkeys.

58:22.560 --> 58:29.680
And it's not really clear why, but my guess is, is it's the lifetime of the animal.

58:29.680 --> 58:38.080
My guess is, is it's the lifetime of the pattern integrity that you are messing with.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.320
And you can remove the gene from a pattern integrity that's only going to last for, you

58:42.320 --> 58:49.120
know, like, only needs to last for 50 weeks.

58:49.120 --> 58:53.480
But if you remove a pattern integrity from something that whose developmental time course

58:53.480 --> 59:01.280
is a few years and whose productive lifetime is 20 years, then that the detrimental effects

59:01.280 --> 59:09.200
of removing one of these parts of the pattern integrity from it can have catastrophic consequences

59:09.200 --> 59:16.960
and that manifests itself in all kinds of weird anecdotal shoulder shrugs in academic

59:16.960 --> 59:17.960
science.

59:18.120 --> 59:20.480
Why don't you make a knockout monkey of that?

59:20.480 --> 59:23.760
Well, we can't make knockout monkeys.

59:23.760 --> 59:32.360
Why don't you take that gene and do what you did in that mouse in a better animal example?

59:32.360 --> 59:36.760
Well, because we can't, because a lot of the things that we can do in mice, we can't do

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
in higher animals.

59:37.760 --> 59:42.640
And what he expressed here, which I was not aware of, but I took notes and I think we

59:42.640 --> 59:50.080
should follow up on this, is that adenovirus DNA transformation and the use of a DNA of

59:50.080 --> 01:00:00.600
adenovirus in animals up to dogs seems to work interesting, isn't it?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.360
Interesting that we know that much interesting that he knows that much.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.040
Not sure this is the gold mine that everybody thought it was, but it is a gold mine.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.720
It's a gold mine because you can now know why, well, I think we're learning.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720
It's great.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:22.360
I like why it's, you know, it was the pandemic was the excuse that you suddenly to save

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360
the world, et cetera.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:29.240
This was the kind of thing, but when I go back to going to the patients who've relaxed

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.280
and melanoma, they go back to that, I put it all down to the immune suppression caused

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
by the boosters.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.080
But I've seen some later relapses, which is say, well, perhaps the immune suppression

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.560
was recovered by now.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.400
And then you become aware of that this is where the irony comes in, is that the, to me,

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400
I was always suspicious.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.680
I saw all these reports and they were always pushed aside and many publications were pulled

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.520
in the census, or well, in the censorship, by whatever it is, I don't know.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.920
But whatever it is, the census has been awful.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.400
But now there is enough data out there.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.560
There's enough people cried out that the quality control of messenger RNA viruses, which I believe

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.560
was always the big issue.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.280
I mean, it was a big, big issue.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280
That's not me.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.800
And you've seen all the, the quality of the vaccines, you know, the, there was a, for

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.240
the first time, mainstream media, the article in spectator Australia actually went through

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.800
well, not only is the quality controlled or for, but it's contaminated with DNA plasminced.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.480
One report up to 350 yard times with sequences from the SV40 promoter.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.160
Well, the SV40 is an oncogenic promoter used in cancer development in mice.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.160
And, you know, first of all, I say, what, hell is that doing in an RNA vaccine you have

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
to ask?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.360
Because the presence of that, the presence of DNA means it can integrate.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.040
Surely, that's not possible.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.200
Well, you don't have to go very far into the literature to find people reporting that

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.080
these spike proteins integrated into all sorts of different tissue.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.120
And for, you know, for rape, they said that it stays at the point of the injection site

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120
and there's no way it spreads.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
Oh, that's all right.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.960
And so this is turns out to be a complete life.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
It's been identified.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
It autopsies.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
It's been identified everywhere.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.920
And this is the other thing with patients.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.040
I can't get autopsies on these patients to prove this.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.240
It's quite incredible.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:30.520
But a colleague who had an explosive cancer, a co-erectal, basically at surgery, sent the

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.280
places away, the pieces away, the tuses away, and spike messenger RNA from the vaccine insertion

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
was confirmed.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.480
So it is, this is, this to me is quite frightening that this is occurring.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.400
And also that there's been this, we don't need to do post-moresomes on patients dying

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400
from this.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.680
It is, it's like it's from on high and they just won't do it.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.240
I pleaded for one on the patient who died from explosive melanoma, who said, I never

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.280
felt well after the booster, I just felt chronically unwell and then the melanoma came

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280
exploding back.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.080
And then I had the patient's relatives consented to a post-mortem.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080
Oh, yes.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080
Oh, yes.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080
So just a minute.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080
You're one of the most senior doctors in the country.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080
You wanted a post-mortem.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.280
The relatives are consented to a post-mortem, but that, that was refused.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280
This is just unbelievable.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280
It's over, yeah.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280
Unbelievable.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.280
It is over by whom?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.480
Well, perhaps there's something to do with, there was a report which got into the Lancet

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.280
of people who died after the vaccines to see whether it could, I don't know if you saw

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280
that.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.720
It appeared in the Lancet, but then it was pulled.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.880
It was pulled very quickly.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.640
The explanation given it was properly peer reviewed, which tells you there's not, peer

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.640
review is over-embed.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.280
I mean, basically it's not politically within the political mantra.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.440
And this is what really, this is what really frightens me.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.400
I went to do an interview along these things, you know, into a mainstream media channel.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.240
And the guy warned me at the beginning, he says, I have to be very careful the way I

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240
ask you questions.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240
And please don't be put off.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.240
I probably sound fairly hostile.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.080
I'm very happy to discuss facts or something, are they?

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.800
But he said, the government had made it a crime to criticize the vaccine program on the media.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:11.200
And I said, I'm astonished but actually thinking about it, I'm not surprised because it explains

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.240
why nothing, nothing is being discussed.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.480
Without someone in the mainstream media, they actually don't think I'll do it.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:23.920
And as you know, the off-con basically weighed it into Mark Stein on the GB News, but basically

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920
querying just that.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.320
I mean, it's the job of the press to raise the question.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.120
And that actually is my job.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.400
I mean, I was carpeted for saying this without proof that I'd actually have to present proof.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.520
Well, they won't let you get the proof, that's not.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.560
But based on this, one of the things that I did do, because I have been with many others,

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.600
particularly Ross Jones and Clare Grant, we had written many, many lessons to the people

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.040
who need to know about all these issues, particularly Ross and our children, which I

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040
do in 100%.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.960
I said, there's absolutely no need for a vaccine.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.600
This vaccine, actually, I said, for the beginning, they said only for people over 70 and they

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
were about, they're ill.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.680
And when it came down to 4050, I said that, you know, there was no need for that, because

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.400
we were getting this myocardis, parvitis signal.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.640
Why did they carry on persisting going down?

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.480
Then you ate, that's another, another story.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:24.000
But we reported all this to people like Chris Whitty and the Department of Health, NHS,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.640
the MHRA, we basically got no engagement, which I think is an absolutely disgrace given

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.600
the series of this on it.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.640
So I was told to say, haven't you been reported to the counter disinformation, which is set

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.840
up by the government, the government, and it said, you can do if you go through this

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.640
particular process, they've got to let you know.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.960
And I was told by somebody who had done all this and found that they had been reported

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960
for it.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:56.640
So I decided and went through this process, I mean, I suspect I have been reported more

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.480
times than anybody else, because I started with a virus, I appeared, bang, bang,

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.600
criticize in the virus, the origin of the virus, lockdown, bang, bang, as I said, lockdown

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600
was more ironic.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.800
And I said, you should never lock down when you haven't bothered to quarantine.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.360
And if quarantine doesn't work, there's no point locked down.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.720
And it never works for airborne diseases, I thought.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.760
And the, just as a cancer doctor, I said, you lock down the cancer, that death rate,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.320
in six to 12 months or two years, we go through the roof, because they won't be excremed

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320
in early treatment.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.080
And I pride ourselves, you were bloody good at that, then, but this lockdown, the collapse

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.160
of the NHS has destroyed that, and it's really, really tragic.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.240
So that's pretty bad.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:46.800
Just let me write this down, whoops.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:55.320
Now, there's some contradictions here that I don't like, and they're contradictions that

01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:00.680
again, I think are part of this cognitive trap, that maybe he's weaving around John

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680
Campbell.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.000
I don't know, maybe he's just a really, he's a good guy, meaning well, but still fully

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
trapped in the Scooby-Doo.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.800
But he definitely believes that the government, this is bad writing here, I had my armchair

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800
was bad.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:23.440
The government made it a crime to discuss the vaccine that was told to him by some journalist.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.760
And a mainstream journalist.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.760
And so he believes that that makes it somehow right.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.160
And so he also definitely, and that's the trick, right?

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:38.720
The leaks, secret phone calls, special emails, ooh, a senator called me, a must being that

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.800
I'm on to something, the senator told me I'm right.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.120
So he definitely believes that there's gained a function viruses that it was covered up,

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.280
and that makes it even more believable.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.160
He believes the booster was a bad idea.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.200
He said more than three times that two, two shots make sense, but three thousand, that's

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:04.720
when I knew it was crazy DNA contamination now it's come up recently in his discussion.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:11.160
And censorship has now reared its ugly head again, as part of the way that he was sure

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.880
that something wasn't right, which I get.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.400
But we still have not mentioned protocols.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:22.100
Campbell hasn't mentioned Madazalam Campbell hasn't mentioned the things that

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:28.220
were done in the homes in the UK, he hasn't mentioned one bit about it.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:32.860
Not one bit about PCR fraud, nothing.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.380
So that's pretty impressive.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:42.260
Anyway, he said that this is the part that really bothers me.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.220
He said that cancer would go through the roof.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:49.780
Sorry, I wanted to finish that.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:09:05.020
This is very bad because of lack of early screening.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:09.100
So that's not good because that's part of the narrative that a lot of people were laying

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:13.300
down at the beginning of the pandemic, including the TV people.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:19.140
And if the TV people were laying this narrative down, then you know it's weird that he's doing

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:25.620
it now, reminding you that it might not even be the shot that's bringing all this

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:31.540
cancer out, but it's what it's the lack of early screening.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:36.940
And so we're starting to create this illusion now because he also mentioned SV 40 on the

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:46.220
other page as being part of promoting cancer and he mentioned DNA integration.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:52.060
And so he says the booster did it, there's contamination and that it can integrate.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.660
But then he goes all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic and says because of lack

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:01.220
of early screening, there's also going to be all this cancer.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.820
So which one is it?

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.020
Is it both?

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.940
You're not explaining it very well.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:11.300
And you have interspersed those two ideas with a whole bunch of sidebar about what you

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:16.740
got cut out of and what people should have been paying attention to with regard to your

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.740
research about HIV.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.700
Ooh, it's interesting.

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700
Wow.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.940
I did not expect this to be my evening tonight.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:32.340
I thought that I was going to have a pretty straightforward immunology stream.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.340
This is intriguing.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:40.460
That's really one of the things that I was, that one of our letters handed into Rudy

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:46.180
Chris Whitty and everybody else, this that and the other, that this resulted in another

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.940
complaint to the CDU about me the next day.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.420
Counter disinformation unit.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.980
So what the hell are they doing?

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.820
As you say, I'm in a far, far better position than any of these people.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:05.580
I can't believe the complete, unbelievable, I got to choose my words very carefully.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.060
But to rely on Sage, you better, you get better information from the people running

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.740
Battersea's Dokom, but they've put their infection control in my view.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.380
I mean, I just couldn't believe that.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:20.140
And Chris Whitty, I mean, I cannot believe the astupidity of the statements that he has

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.140
made right from the beginning.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.940
We told him about vitamin D, you know, this, that, the other, and he came back, he had

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.620
the contact and he says, there's not enough evidence to do anything about it.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:31.020
I mean, not enough evidence that is beyond belief.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.020
And then that's true.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.540
You know, when we challenge him, that's true.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.780
Jason M in the chat says that this may be the first time he's had to vent, that's, that's

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.940
a legitimate thing.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940
That's right.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.100
It could be the first time anybody's ever listened to him.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:47.100
So he's got to say something that that's possible.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.940
Who knows what I'll do when I get on Tucker Carlson, right?

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:55.660
And he says, oh, you've got to vaccinate the children in order to protect the parents

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.660
of grandparents.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.700
In that last sentence, he re-reals papers of stupidity.

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.580
First of all, you don't vaccinate people to protect other people.

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.180
That's the first thing you're wrong.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:08.260
And then by saying to protect the parents and the grandparents that already been subject

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.100
to this vaccine battering, you've admitted it doesn't work.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.900
It's unbelievable.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.700
And so, I mean, I've got, I think Chris Whitty said one or two things that made a reasonable

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.540
sense earlier on.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:26.180
He said, well, you can't really introduce vaccines unless nothing works.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:31.900
And the virus is really lethal, like it kills young people, the third of them, which is

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:32.900
absolutely true.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.420
So why did the Allow Vaccine program to be rolled out for a disease that only killed

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.860
old people, in my view, just bought for death by about three months and didn't actually

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:48.300
kill anybody else any more than the random viruses, the flus, et cetera, do it.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.900
And I think, and I call them this, I think there has to be accountability, you know,

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.460
that has to be this, um, hallett inquiry.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.540
See, but why won't he explain it?

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:02.820
Why doesn't he explain that we can, and it might be that we just need to educate John

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:03.820
Campbell.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:08.020
We need to educate this guy that the data is there.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:11.460
Denny Rancour, Denny Rancour has the data.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.900
He can show that the all-cause mortality doesn't support the spread of a respiratory virus.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.580
I don't care what he thinks.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:25.060
And he says the vaccine wasn't necessary unless like it killed the third of the people that

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:31.980
had infected, but then think carefully, sir, about what they did.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:36.040
They rolled in all of the deaths that they could.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:43.500
They increased the deaths that they could by discouraging the use of antibiotics to tick

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:52.340
a little bit here, discouraging the, the, uh, resuscitation of cardiac patients in New York

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:58.980
and other places, encouraging the use of ventilators prematurely in order to stop spread before

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:02.900
people needed ventilation.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.780
This, this is what they're missing.

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:07.980
And they're right on the cusp.

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:13.460
If they could just understand that, okay, now realize that you don't need a particularly

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.620
dangerous virus.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:21.980
You need a particularly well-oiled machine capable of delivering this fear around the

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:30.620
world at exactly the same time, with the exact same precision in met and messaging

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.900
so that everybody stopped using antibiotics, so that everybody started ventilating, so

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:40.780
that everybody panicked, so that everybody shut down.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:47.580
And the use of revdesivir, the use of medazolam, the use of all of these tricks resulted in

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:55.940
more people dying in the hospital than should have and being tallied to COVID.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:03.500
If it didn't result in more all-cause mortality, it just means that there was enough deadwood

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:12.020
from previous years so that it didn't raise the expectations, the expected age of death

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:17.540
was actually higher in the pandemic.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:24.460
Because of the nature of that sort of top-heavy population pyramid that we had, they're talking

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.740
about none of this, but we can get them there.

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:34.980
The vaccine wasn't necessary, he knows it wasn't necessary, he knows it didn't work.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:39.900
But now, if he also has somebody in the government that says we can't run a vaccine unless A,

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:46.620
B, and C, then he also could realize, it's possible he could realize.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:51.020
And John Campbell, therefore, could realize that wait, in order to get A, B, and C they

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.700
might've done something, in order to get A, B, and C might've been the reason why the

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:01.340
protocols were changed, in order to get A, B, and C, that might've been the reason why

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:06.660
they use medazolam, John Campbell, in order to get A, B, and C that might've been the

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:11.420
reason why they use revdesivir in America, John Campbell.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.460
In order to get A, B, and C that might've been the reason why they lied about what happened

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:23.060
New York it actually should be feet to the line this was you were on it was in

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:27.740
your watch your charge all this stuff now is because you didn't do things and I

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:32.300
think why didn't witty resign why didn't balance resign they're all they're

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:37.700
like hello all of this is also because of John Campbell who did nothing but

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.060
encourage people to take the shot it's all because of him because he didn't

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:47.700
get out there earlier where's his YouTube channel you see what I'm talking

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:52.900
about here it's very easy to throw mud now but I'm what unless you're willing to

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:58.500
say that you were also involved like I have been saying it repeatedly the

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:05.660
lab leak the lab leak the lab leak was me for a couple months but I came to my

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:20.420
senses in May of 2020 not in in in October of 2023 and there has to be some

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:24.820
acknowledgement that if any of these people like John Campbell could have

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:30.900
come to their senses in 2021 we could have avoided this in 2020 it would have

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:38.660
been even better but then maybe he'd have just been thrown off a YouTube this

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:43.380
is what we're dealing with right now this is how the the the narrative gets

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:49.500
rolled up they've used this football has passed in the ball around the back because

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.780
it can't be bothered to sort the female properly it just passed past they're

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.060
blaming everybody else I mean I think it's a query is it's just a fast but a

01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:02.140
whitewash and by the time they come to any conclusions the people will go on

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.300
for so long they'll have forgotten what it was all about and the people would be

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.900
completely retired or dead or god knows this is all and I think they should be

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.500
the people who should have intervened because they they were daily immune

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.220
about things and if they didn't they should have got the right people didn't

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:23.300
reside hmm go back to your patients professor with the melanoma there's

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:27.700
this perturbation in the immune system now have you seen aggressive is the melanoma

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:33.180
become more aggressive more sort of more virulent melanoma as a result of the

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.820
perturbations which may well include the vaccine completely in fact it's my

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.660
colleagues who came up with the saying we're seeing this too it's absolutely

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.100
explosive they point this work explosive and my colorectal colleagues have seen

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:50.300
this now they're talking about explosive presentations of colorectal cancer in

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.460
young people particularly like they've never seen before can I just say that I

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:57.940
wish you would stop saying explosive colorectal cancer I don't know why he has

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:04.420
to keep saying that anyway it was one of those that the integration of the spike

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.420
protein in their shoe it's almost like a new disease explosive colorectal cancer

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:14.660
of the young yeah so they are presenting and it's already in the liver and the

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.260
lymph nodes for the lungs whereas normally it's already metastasized yeah

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:22.900
this is a process that when you put them under pressure it gradually escapes

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:28.700
there's a slow process in most people explosive is extremely unusual and the

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:35.180
colorectal surgeons are all reporting this now is have you seen any cases that you

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:41.300
probably wouldn't expect of lymphoma cancer of the lymphatic system oh absolutely

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:46.820
not I mean I don't do lymphomas in the clinic so that's the first thing but I'm

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:51.380
hearing people who after their booster vaccines have gone down that with

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.020
lumps in the neck and things like that and I found that a colleague worked

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:59.180
somewhere else completely and I bumped into my eyes said you know how are you

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.260
I said oh I'm okay but I've developed some lumps in my neck and they've been

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:08.820
diagnosed as lymphoma and I just trying to be sympathetic so what earth calls

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:13.100
that and the patient says oh apparently it's due to the vaccine might that's what

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:17.260
my oncologist said and I said but this is the reaction I'll get it everywhere

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:22.100
and yet when we report it higher up the chain we're told it's only going to

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:27.300
shut up and not cause panic amongst the patient any rate that person told me

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:33.060
that three of her friends out of the couple of dozen had all had the same

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.260
thing it was quite amazing then I found somebody else lymphoma is not

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:42.260
something that we're gonna test for very much but given the talk to we heard

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:47.580
from Drew Weisman which was only like a year old yesterday where he said he was

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:53.660
really excited about how easy it was to target the lymph nodes and again I said

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:59.500
yesterday night and I'll say it again transfecting a bunch of T cells it just

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:05.220
can't be the it can't be the goal of any therapy that's designed to use fully

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:11.020
augment the immune system that just makes no sense I mean it really makes no

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:19.300
sense that you could show those pictures to a room full of biologists and people

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:25.860
wouldn't be like now my only my only claim here is that I wasn't in that room I

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.580
wasn't around during a talk like that had I been around during a talk like that

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:36.260
when I was in in academia still I would have said something I've done it many

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:48.140
times and in that case that is just absurd it is absolutely absurd that you

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:55.020
can show a glow-in-the-dark staining lymph node and say look what we can do

01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:01.340
and that's a good idea show up a section of Baron Mabone marrow and say look

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:08.300
what we can do as if that's a good idea as if that is a useful way to augment the

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:16.580
immune system now you can make a little mouse model that has one readout or three

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:22.020
readouts that can all be translated into a bar graph and show that the changes in

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:27.540
those readouts are in the general direction of a therapeutic that might

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:32.580
be useful but in a mouse that doesn't mean anything because we can make knockout

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:40.420
mice because we can make transgenic mice we can make pre-driven genetic

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:47.780
altered mice we can't do that with most other mammals

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:56.700
we're talking about genetic mice you know genetically inbred mice you can't

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:04.300
genetically in breed humans I just don't know what to say ladies and gentlemen

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:10.060
but we're dealing with something here where there is an illusion most of the

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:19.540
people who mean well are still under its spell I was only able to to start to

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.580
become aware of this illusion a few years ago it's not like I knew what this was

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:30.980
the pandemic saved me it probably saved a lot of you and now we need to use the

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.860
pandemic to save these guys because they're there they're on their way out of the

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:40.980
cave they know that something is wrong they shouldn't see these kinds of

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.220
cancers they shouldn't see it in this frequency they shouldn't see it in this

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:49.780
young and there shouldn't be a temporal correlation with a particular therapeutic

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:56.420
exposure but it is there is a temporal correlation with a therapeutic exposure

01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:04.860
to a vaccine candidate transfection that the maker itself was bragging about not

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.380
ten months ago about how these preparations of lipid nanoparticles and

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:18.300
mRNA are very easily targeted to the lymph node to the bone marrow they go

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:28.620
all over the body locally and had a lymphoma diagnosis then I found my a

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:34.060
close member of the family developed a leukemia and that was after the booster

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:39.820
vaccine now here I want to point out that quite a few people especially my

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:47.820
agent etc probably have low-grade B cell disease lymphomas leukemias

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:53.780
etc my lomas and yes and it's maintained under control because it was a good

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:59.180
healthy T cell surveillance it keeps it under control so when you give a booster

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:03.540
and you start to find these B cell hemias and things coming more common you

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.940
don't have to look hard to work out what the packet genesis is I why they

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:11.460
suddenly appear but my other colleagues are pointing out that they're seeing

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:16.180
more renal cancer too a lot more renal cancer now renal cancer in my loma

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.340
we're always loved together as being tumors that seem to respond to immune

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.380
therapy but you know they were both both the ones that responded to interferon

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.860
and interlinked to you before we had specific therapy so that again would

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:36.260
fit the T cell perturbation control theory and are we talking about what

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.700
sorts of leukemia is potentially are we talking about here well B cell ones so

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.460
I mean one of the ones specifically had its array of subtypes called

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:50.500
mandrel cell that all fits into the more chronic remind me please is that

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:56.460
the myloid type yes yeah right thank you yeah now you mentioned before about the

01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.520
the the SS 40 now that this is the Simeon virus I think isn't it Simeon

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.860
virus 40 I'm a right in thinking that that coincidentally in infects monkey

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:13.380
kidney cells which are cultured to and then those cell cultures are used to

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:16.100
make the DNA which is then used to make the RNA which is in the vaccine does

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:22.460
that the way it works I am not in theory yes yeah I'm not completely

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:27.780
okay was in the vacuum kidney cells which is the Simeon virus now you mentioned

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:34.540
before about the the SS 40 now that this is the Simeon virus I think isn't

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:38.460
it Simeon virus 40 I'm a right in thinking that that coincidentally in

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:44.780
infects monkey kidney cells which are cultured to and then those cell

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.900
cultures are used to make the DNA which is then used to make the RNA which is in

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:57.620
the vaccine is that the way it works I am not I don't know that that's the case

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:05.580
would they use monkey kidney cells to make the DNA that is then grown in the

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:13.580
bacteria I think they print the DNA I think they just made that DNA from from

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:19.940
like synthetic so that it's super pure and then they couldn't create the whole

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:25.700
construct and then they put that in I don't think that they use monkey kidney

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:34.060
cells to do it I think that's incorrect and SV 40 the virus is different than

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:41.100
the SV 40 promoter and the SV 40 promoter is used in the plasmid it is

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:46.780
not the whole virus it is the start sequence that makes sure that the the

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:52.820
bacteria makes many many many copies of the plasmid that contains it I think

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:56.580
it's related to the origin of replication but it's not the origin of

01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:01.740
replicate could be the origin of replication I don't know SV 40 may be

01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.700
the origin of it but it's also just a promoter type thing like a signal that

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:12.420
that tells the bacteria to make many copies of the plasmid so I'm not I'm

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.660
pretty sure they're they're getting this confused but it'll go in theory yes

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:22.740
yeah I'm not completely okay with how they are doing it I mean it's a commercial

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:27.660
secret yeah now you find these sequences in both files are a Moderna you can

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:32.980
start but I mean if it was just in one batch I think they need to be very

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:37.300
careful here because they basically said that monkey kidney cells were used in

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:42.780
the production of the vaccine and so what they're gonna do is they're gonna

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.220
create this thing where then somebody can easily debunk them and say see John

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:51.300
Campbell's an idiot he doesn't know what he's talking about monkey kidney cells

01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:55.860
would never use to make the DNA the DNA was made pure with synthetic processes

01:28:55.860 --> 01:29:02.620
they just printed it see how dumb John Campbell is now I'm not saying that I'm

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:08.820
saying that what this sets up is for somebody to say that some some armchair

01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:17.140
youtuber debunker like debunk the funk can take this one clip and dunk on him

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:28.540
do you see it it's really dangerous this is so bad this is how fragile are our

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:32.780
statuses right now and how easily the cards can come down that's why I think

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:38.380
it's a real trap to think that John Campbell is actually waking up he's got

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:42.860
this guy on here but he's not pushing back against him at all he's deferring

01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:46.860
to his expertise even though there's lots of times here when he could have

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:54.060
pushed back find this guy's email for me I'll see if I can get him on my stream

01:29:54.060 --> 01:30:01.020
that they'll join but you know I'll dry whoops whoops what the hell

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:05.780
it's somebody a very early on various you pointed out that there were terrible

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.780
side effects in some people even in the first and second years and then they

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:14.260
found that there was a massive difference in the batches and so if

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:17.560
there was three big batches one batch would be responsible for 90% of the side

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.500
effects yeah so we know then this is a big quality control issue going on and

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.660
so if as they say they find these sequences in lots of different batches it

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:31.740
does that's just I think one of the bacteria used is E. coli which of course

01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.320
is what we call a gram-negative and if there's any contamination from the

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.780
gram-negative cell walls that would make people that would make people pretty

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:47.460
ill as well if that was the case I'm that's the endotoxin which we have

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:57.420
heard we have heard Josh Getzko on this guy's program talk about that we've

01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:02.820
also heard Robert Malone talk about how he solved the endotoxin problem many

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:09.260
years ago when he was trying to develop this technology interesting right we

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:12.940
know for sure I mean I remember it very distinctly that he said that in that

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:19.620
interview with with Vage on health Philip McMillan just a couple days ago I

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.380
know I've been going for 34 days straight but I can remember what I did and I

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:27.780
remember what we listened to and that's why this work is paying off because it

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:31.380
seems like we're wasting our time watching the same thing over and over

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:36.420
again but we're actually not what we're doing is we're catching people in lies

01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:42.540
because when you're lying it's hard to keep things straight and the more you

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.860
see how people can't keep things straight the more it is easy to see that they

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:54.380
must have been lying that and again I'm not talking about the present video but

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:59.380
I am I need you to be cautioned into thinking that John Campbell has been

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:04.500
awakened even if he's awake to the transfection being dangerous he's not

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:13.420
awake to the sum total of of lies plus protocols equals very little virus he's

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:20.740
still under the assumption that people were saved but there was contamination

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:26.060
and the contamination could explain all of what this brother professor is saying

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:31.540
if John Campbell wants to lean that way if that's the confirmation that he's

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.780
looking for this professor is giving him all the ammunition he needs to confirm

01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:45.340
that well it could be the transfection but you know it's this DNA contamination

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:50.620
is definitely bad I mean why are we talking about the

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:54.460
transfection going to the lymph nodes right now they must know that they could

01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:00.100
know that he's been against this for so many months or years he must have looked

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:06.460
into it too could find the same videos and descriptions that we have where it

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.540
goes to the lymph node he's an immunologist what is he thinks gonna happen he

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:18.220
described it earlier in the video you might remember to harness half the

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:25.660
immune system with this shot can't be a good idea he said to harness half the

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:32.140
immune system sounds a lot like transfecting a lymph node and all the cells

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:38.420
in it doesn't it yee that idea concerned dramatically concerned about what you've

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:45.900
seen already what possible implications could this have for cancers emerging

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:52.700
over the next few years well obviously I'm aware of quite a few patients who

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:56.420
mean bullied into having booster and then have the booster just to be safe

01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:00.420
because you're at risk I think this is highly unethical because and I have seen

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:05.700
it a communication you are required to contact your GP immediately and arrange

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:10.980
for another booster and things like that that is totally unethical it's non-GMC

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:15.260
compliant in fact it's nearly Nuremberg Charlotte territory yeah because there's

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.660
no informed consent there's not even any justification but the boosters going to

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.100
do these patients any good in fact completely to the contrary and the big

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.620
thing is that they they wanted you to have the vaccine and better protect

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.140
everybody else it doesn't protect infection at all from the Cleveland

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:37.660
study I know the big Cleveland study was updated it most as I've dated in

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.500
September and they've confirmed if you have the booster you have three and a

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.140
half guys more like to get COVID and if you don't so I would put that into

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:50.500
grievous bodily arm territory not a necessary medical prophylactic treatment

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.660
territory I mean the way in terms of what you want to do that and the only way that

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.460
that is causing them to be three and a half times that's an interesting idea

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:03.900
that that if you could show that the recommendation of the CDC actually led

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:08.900
to more danger for the people who took the shots maybe you can blame it on them

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:13.540
that's interesting and I don't think it's a pretty very ridiculous idea because

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:18.140
again like this guy has been good at pointing out and what I think I was

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.660
ranting about yesterday with regard to Drew Weismann's presentation about

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:30.020
antibodies and activation of the immune system and and transfection or delivery

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:36.060
of RNA in different places in the body the idea that unequivocally more is

01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:42.620
better in all cases and that the bigger difference between previous attempts at

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:48.100
augmenting the immune system and this one with one metric was somehow a sign of

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:55.540
superiority and what that that that whole argument belies is a gross

01:35:55.540 --> 01:36:00.940
underestimating of the complexity of the immune system what that that

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:06.100
misrepresentation belies is a complete misunderstanding of how the immune system

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:11.740
probably works and this guy seems to know more than Drew Weismann but doesn't

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:17.580
really seem to be keen on really laying it out which is fine because maybe this

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:21.660
is the first time he's been out there and it's got a lot of things he wants to

01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:27.300
say but we can be critical as we watch it and so that's why I'm drawing your

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:31.980
attention to these things well likely is that it has perturbated the immune system

01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:35.100
and all the liars have said it's used its resources to fight viruses that don't

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.580
exist it's making lots of useless antibodies which are actually contrary

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.700
not to fighting viruses that don't exist means that it evolved to not have the

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:49.620
original spike protein I think that's what he means so take that also with a

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:54.260
grain of salt between to another one called antibody dependent in Harlan and

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:58.740
the same Cleveland that they had reported that they the vaccine companies

01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:03.260
say ah but this is a great technology because all the new variants we can make

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:07.700
a new vaccine for and give you the new variants and we can give you two variants at once

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:13.900
there is no evidence that that protects you whatsoever in fact in all the

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:18.620
mice work there's evidence that we'll actually do more harm by doing and so

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:21.300
first of all this type of virus we have antibody dependent on the heart

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.820
which I think is clearly going on yeah but secondly to explain why they're so

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:30.180
useless is that I published with some other colleagues because there's a

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.700
completely different group from the origin of the virus going over the

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:37.020
secrets of finding out these of all we genetically put in I publish with

01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:40.900
another set of colleagues is what the history of coronavirus vaccine is and

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:44.500
what lessons can be learned from it the lessons that can be learned from it is

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:48.740
no coronavirus vaccine is ever been shown to be of any use at all and that's

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:55.500
what I was saying in 2020 in May there was never a coronavirus vaccine that's

01:37:55.500 --> 01:38:01.140
ever worked not in veterinary science not in a laboratory model it's never

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:07.860
worked and so there was no reason to believe that this would work now to the

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:13.500
contrary one of the motivating factors of Ralph Barracks laboratory in the

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:19.620
beginning was to use coronaviruses because of their harmless nature because

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:24.820
of their ability to fly under the radar because our immune system ignored them

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:34.860
they might be useful for molecular techniques for medical use extraordinary

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:39.140
they don't have one for the cult and more importantly they would love one the

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:44.060
next would love them but they just don't they just don't work and the main

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:48.100
reason they don't they don't work is the coronavirus has had this phenomenon

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.780
once they became system seen it it locks in it's called immunological imprinting

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:56.900
or antigenic sin so when you do any variation all you do is boost the

01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:01.220
response to the person and that would explain why they're so useless and why

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:06.100
they're letting all other other variants in through the back door and other

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.100
people have said that we probably wouldn't have to see that I think is a

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:12.300
really it's not a good enough explanation so I'm just getting it

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:17.780
rough him again I'm gonna make my my image a little bigger what he should be

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:25.260
saying is that if we instruct the immune system to pay attention to parts of the

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:30.580
coronavirus which are not functionally constrained then we will instruct the

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:35.620
immune system to make memory to a changing target and our immune system

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:41.020
doesn't do that normally and when our immune system makes mistakes is when it

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:49.060
does make memory to self proteins or to a moving target and so part of what the

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:55.300
immune system has evolved to do is select epitopes from the antigen that

01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:04.380
seem to be functionally constrained that are related related related to previous

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:12.700
epitopes previous proteins that have been seen your body has a mechanism which

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.020
I can't explain because I don't adequately understand but I assure you

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:25.020
it's there to use the catalog of previously memorized epitopes in

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.860
functionally constrained proteins of other entities like this RNA virus

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:39.940
whatever it is and those epitopes are from this most the immune system is

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:45.140
designed to first select from those rather than to augment and awaken new

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:53.020
ones and we're awakening new naive de novo memories in the immune system is

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:59.180
much more complex than augmenting previously activated and already

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:06.660
crescendo de crescendo memories that are stored in the immune system and those

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.660
are two very different processes that vaccinologists never talk about that

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:14.100
these people that sell this stuff never talk about that these guys aren't talking

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:20.820
about so we've got to be always on top of this but this imprinting thing is

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:26.780
important but he could also point out that there are there are genes and there

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:32.460
are sections of the genome that whether you believe in the coronavirus biology

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:38.660
per se or not the primary literature that occurs before 2020 shows clearly

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:44.260
that there are parts of this virus that don't change and therefore can be used

01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:50.660
as targets in a pan coronavirus PCR test that's the end protein that's the RNA

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.420
dependent RNA polymerase and for years that's how we found all coronaviruses is

01:41:55.460 --> 01:42:02.220
looking for the things they share in common and your immune system has taken

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:06.260
the same strategy in developing whatever immunity is necessary in order to cope

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:13.660
with coronaviruses the least memory possible the immune system tries to

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:21.220
respond the least memory possible it's become very obvious to me that this idea

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.700
of forcing the immune system to make a robust memory to something is exactly

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:33.180
antithetical to how the immune system works you're trying to avoid a cascade

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:39.380
you're trying to get the least amount of memory formed the least amount of

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:47.140
activation to cope with every threat to maintain inside from out we're gonna

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:50.420
learn how to teach this immune system better than it's ever been taught before

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:55.340
and that's how we're going to change the world because when people understand

01:42:55.340 --> 01:43:00.300
that their immune system has been made dumb simple in order to pray upon us in

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:08.660
order to get us to sign up as unhealthy test subjects so that eventually our

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:16.140
grandchildren will be born into a system like that once you understand we're

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.860
going to be free I've had the problem with the variants it hadn't been for the

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.620
vaccine program in the first place which in retrospect everybody said well at

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:33.220
least to protect it loads of people but I don't even buy that anymore because it

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:37.340
came in when everything was dying out and new variants were being induced

01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:42.620
probably by the vaccine so you know one of them I can tell you that I'm gonna

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:47.820
have Denny Rancour on the show again he just sent me his newest paper and that

01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:59.460
paper is pretty cool because it deals with taking this claim of the of the

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:16.620
it takes there it is it this is his

01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:21.020
substantive evaluation of whether the Nobel Prize winning COVID-19 vaccines

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:29.100
actually saved lives and if you take a look at the article you will see

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:36.460
that if you throw in the numbers and what what Denny has which is really

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:41.060
cool is that he has in this gray line here so the blue line is the actual more

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:47.380
to all cause mortality the gray line is the rollout of the vaccines from zero to

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:54.220
you know all the vaccines are out and so in order for between 14 million and

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:59.900
19 million people to have been saved by the vaccine it would have to have been

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:03.660
saved after the rollout of the vaccine right so that's what Denny has here in

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:09.900
this time frame is that the rollout of the vaccine is the gray numbers and what we

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:14.180
are supposed to have avoided is the red number then because the red number would

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:18.740
be 14 million people on top of the all-cause mortality that we have here and as

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:24.660
you know the blue already shows increases in all cause mortality that

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:29.420
aren't due to COVID but are seem to be due to the shot rollout but now we see

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:36.660
the preposterous nature of the claim that the vaccine saved 14 million to 19

01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:41.540
million lives if we see these charts and of course you could do this all around

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:48.660
the world in Canada and elsewhere because they made numbers in this paper that was

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.740
published in the Landsat which we will talk about with Denny as well that

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:58.020
claimed these crazy figures and so you can throw it back on top of these

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.780
figures and show what they claimed they saved with the vaccine and see how

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:10.340
absurd it is and nonetheless they're making these claims and it doesn't really

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:15.780
seem as though we're gonna escape from this until people realize that it is the

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.180
protocols that created the illusion that allowed the vaccine to be rolled out in

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:28.260
the first place it wasn't the cover-up of a lab virus it was the appearance of the

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:32.660
cover-up of a lab virus that distracted people from realizing that the

01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:38.700
protocols and that the tests were being used to roll up all cause mortality into

01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:43.740
a new disease and they doing everything they could to drive up all cause

01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.540
mortality do not resuscitate orders ventilating people that don't need it

01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:57.460
remdesivir, medazolam, opioids, anything to get all cause mortality to go up when

01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.100
they needed it to go up at the start of the pandemic where they needed to go up

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:07.660
at the start of the pandemic and then once this machine was rolling it was

01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:12.420
gonna go to the end and that's what people are starting to realize as they

01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:19.260
look backwards and they investigate what people did in 2020 and you realize

01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:23.300
that people realized that there was money to be made opportunities to be had

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:30.460
and they were acting too early to not to have been tipped off people are

01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.860
starting to scramble for the exits ladies and gentlemen because we're on to

01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:38.180
them I'm not saying these guys are the bad guys I'm saying that this is how it

01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:43.580
happens and this is what we said a few years ago they're gonna slow roll us to

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:48.340
the truth here are these guys being allowed to say this are these guys

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.740
slowly figuring it out I don't know but there's if they're slowly figuring it

01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:58.300
out then they're right on pace with the Scooby-Doo that's gonna eventually be

01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:02.220
used to blame it on certain Western countries that this was allowed to

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:07.820
happen which I don't necessarily disagree with but if we don't come to

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:12.900
terms with the extent to which they lied to us about the proportion of people

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:21.620
killed by a novel virus gain a function leak versus protocols and lies and fake

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:29.540
testing we're never gonna escape. One of the big important chapters was in the

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.860
the places that got the new various quicker so those are the most intensified

01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:36.220
vaccine programs and one of the ones the first ones to come out that was

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:40.420
completely different was only Chrome which came out to South Africa and the

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.300
South Africans beautifully described that this was a much more infectious

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:48.860
agent but it wasn't serious don't worry about it don't do this that it is not

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:52.860
thing just don't worry about it and by the way we've done our work it makes no

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.420
difference whether you're vaccinated or unvaccinated whether you get infected

01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:59.100
whether you get ill whether you go classical or you die they had all that

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:04.660
data on the plate again they communicated with the the government and all these

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:08.740
people who decided that they probably not that clever and got it wrong and they

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:12.540
persisted with lockdown and I do think that that data is the reason why Nick

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:17.660
Hudson was so hot for so long because he knew that in in South Africa they had

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:21.780
data which showed otherwise other lunatic things all South African

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:25.060
science got it wrong yeah and of course in retrospect they got a hundred percent

01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:30.100
right and I must say after hearing them being interviewed I knew they were

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:33.620
completely right because they're absolutely absolutely special and people

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:36.780
who work in that environment tend to be brighter than those who end up in white

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:42.540
hole indeed so giving repeated booster doses of vaccine produces more antibodies

01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:46.500
if you've got time to tell us what our antibody dependent enhancement is what

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:51.540
is being enhanced by these antibodies well as mentioned the antibodies they're

01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:55.260
no longer neutralizing because they were developed in order to attack a virus

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:59.700
and said that's got long gone so you've got all these antibodies and they attach

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.340
to the other viruses because there's some bits the same but they don't

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:08.740
neutralize it so by attaching to it they they have their antibodies sticking

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:12.900
out so they're more likely to be gobbled up by the macrophages things and brought

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.060
into the system so it makes them more likely to go into cells it makes them

01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:20.980
more likely to go in cells yes and it's very it's very well described and it's

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:26.020
the bane of trying to produce vaccines against things like dengue fever

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:30.220
I think that they're being disingenuous with this mechanism here and it's just

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:34.860
dawned on me what they're what they're disingenuous about

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:42.340
so antibodies are supposed to bind to the virus and neutralize the virus meaning

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:51.340
block the receptor and I think this is wrong because they're supposed to do

01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:56.740
lots of things they're supposed to tag the virus for processing they are

01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:02.900
supposed to bring in complement to destroy it to rupture it and they can

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:08.900
also I don't think that antibodies are just designed to block the receptor and

01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:13.980
do nothing else and that's what neutralizing means they're no longer

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:19.620
neutralizing that's what that means if they're not neutralizing it means that

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:26.260
they don't block the receptor and neutralize it I think this is a very

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:31.340
big mistake this is a very big trap here in the immunomethology the

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:35.780
neutralization means something when the antibodies don't neutralize anymore it

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:41.820
means that they bind to a different part of the receptor binding domain but

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:45.060
that shouldn't necessarily mean that that wouldn't allow the immune system

01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:50.540
to find the virus and to take it up it's not the uptake of the virus that's

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:58.740
dangerous I don't think because if neutralization was important then you

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.780
would need as we've talked about before you would need a neutralizing

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:07.740
antibody for every spike protein on every virus otherwise the neutralizing

01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:15.300
thing would only be partial and so I think we fooled ourselves with some of

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:22.420
these in vitro assays to assume that neutralization is how it works when we

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:26.220
do these things in a dish there's no other immune cells there there's no

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:31.980
complement system there there's nothing there so then in that while I can't

01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:37.460
believe I'm figuring this outright live on the screen but in that preparation in

01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:42.940
a cell culture where there's no immune system and no complement system then

01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:48.220
it's easy to imagine that antibodies neutralize the fusion protein of

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:53.300
viruses and prevent the fusion and prevent the RNA from being taken up by

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:59.980
those cells but that's a very very closed system where any other effects that

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:06.380
the antibody binding to that virus would have are not there which could

01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:11.380
include immediate destruction by the complement system the complement system

01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:18.380
acts very quickly T cells and macrophages can act very quickly and if

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:24.140
they're there to take up the cells this could be a distraction anybody

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:27.500
dependent enhancement is a much more complicated thing which may involve

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:36.900
actually the idea that the antibodies that bind to this thing help it to infect

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:44.660
your cells protected from immune activation no they caused the immune

01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:50.820
activation so you have all these antibodies floating around free in

01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:57.580
your in your blood and when they bind to things and aggregate they cause

01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:05.300
inflammation so that antibody dependent enhancement is simply could be as simple

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:10.820
as the idea of having antibodies when you don't need them and since the only

01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:17.540
thing that we can usefully augment in a vaccine scenario is seroprevalence that

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:22.540
any time that antibodies are maladaptive you get antibody dependent

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:28.340
enhancement what a stupid name for having antibodies when you don't need

01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:37.900
them what a stupid excuse for augmenting the immune system going wrong oh my

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:43.540
gosh this is blowing my mind that I'm figuring this out right now have we

01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:48.260
really bamboozled ourselves to the extent to which that we believe that

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:53.420
antibody dependent enhancement love you have too many of the wrong ones it'll be

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:59.900
bad it's not too many of the wrong ones too many antibodies period think about

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:05.060
that proteins floating around in your blood to protect you from stuff that's

01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:10.260
not what your blood is a soup of proteins that protect you from stuff that

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:16.180
memorize all different kinds of epitopes you got antibodies for all this that's

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:28.100
not how it works holy cow we got them oh my gosh we got them of course once the

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.900
antibody is held in a cell culture where you do a neutralizing assay you don't

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:38.060
have the immune system you don't have the complement system and so it's a very

01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:43.340
little cartoon world where the only readout you have is whether or not these

01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:47.420
pseudo virus particles bind to the cell culture and cause the cell culture to

01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:55.620
change and so then it's very easy to you have antibodies in the solution and so

01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:01.140
now that reaction doesn't happen and now you have this whole cartoon in your

01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:05.620
imagination that says that fusion proteins are blocked by antibodies and

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:13.100
that's how we defend ourselves against viruses and so the more antibodies you

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:19.900
have the better don't you see it holy shit

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:26.900
the virus into the cell oh my gosh I can't believe I'm figuring this out now in

01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:32.100
2023 so the government are building a new plant in Harwell Science Park just

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:36.860
near Oxford to produce 250 million doses of mRNA vaccine per year as far as we

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:39.380
know there's another plant near Melbourne we believe in Australia to

01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:41.780
produce a couple hundred million doses per year there's another one in Canada

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:49.380
is this a good idea have to think very carefully I read today that Germany has

01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:53.740
ordered the destruction of millions of millions doses of vaccines having come

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:58.340
to the right conclusion Switzerland is the same Switzerland been all their

01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:04.420
vaccines I think they've been a hoodwink about this I mean we do did need a good

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:10.780
facility but now I don't the last mass production needs messenger RNA I think

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:14.220
it should be put in totally into the bin a lot he hate me for this because they've

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.900
put so much intellectual everything in it but I mean if I if I was 10 years ago

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:25.060
involved a scientific things committees who had everything sorted out to go in

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.020
and they're talking about cancer vaccines you know so many safety issues

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:31.700
aren't the same as giving it to own every man and his dog yes it's just

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.780
chalk and cheese isn't it if you've got someone with someone with a who's

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.740
perfectly healthy and you give them an intervention you've got one set of

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.500
risk benefit analysis if you've got one of your patients for example who's

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.540
gravely ill with some form of cancer then clearly you're going to be prepared to

01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:46.820
take a bigger potential risk because the risk from the cancer is so much bigger

01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:50.060
it just seems a completely different equation it's proportionality yeah

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:57.780
proportionality with the messenger RNA risk and well populations saying you

01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.860
are preventing them getting okay so he does get that that's good they're going

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:09.180
to die anyway I mean you know we've all lived through I mean the COVID thing

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:13.820
has made us forget just how lethal some of the flu epidemics have been I mean

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:20.660
30,000 years not unusual I was a junior doctor so we didn't close down the

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:26.900
country from that that's all I want to ask really professor just got one we do

01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:31.580
plan if you would like to I'd like to do another video at some stage on viral

01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.540
origins I don't want to do that today but that's an interesting one but do you

01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:38.900
have a particular blood level that you like to titrate your patients with

01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.060
cancers how high do you like their vitamin D levels to be

01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:47.540
oh yes I've done a lot of work on that and I know that came to the I came to

01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:51.420
conclusion that the normal level which the NHS and doctors like to bark at you

01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:55.500
normally you don't need to do anything there's not normal at all because it's

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:59.540
the normal population which is endemically low if it isn't indeed that is the

01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:04.200
problem it is means you're like that they're like normal for people with low

01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:09.100
bit of indeed normal for people that are low I mean I don't know what to work and

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:14.060
most things I included myself in this and I measured my own bit of indeed and

01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:18.180
took a bit of the exception and I read wisely I mean and I must give full

01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:22.860
credit to David Grimes and David Anderson who really I mean if anybody

01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:27.060
deserved the Nobel Prize let me make sure about the Nobel Prize for the

01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:32.140
COVID pandemic because I had lobbied strongly independently and I found

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:36.340
that they had to and to ignore us and many others who probably do the same

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:39.900
thing I think there's is medical negligence what the government total

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:45.180
medical issues anyway to not forgetting your actual question is I came to

01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:49.940
conclusion I want all my patients to have a vitamin D3 level over a hundred

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:55.140
nanomoles per liter not 50 as the NHS seems quite happy with I managed to get

01:59:55.140 --> 02:00:00.100
our own hospitals except up to 75 but for my patients I wanted to be over a

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:03.420
hundred it makes an unbelievable difference so that'd be about 40 in

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:09.580
America nanograms per mill I honestly you've got me there I think you divide

02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:13.300
I was trying to do it you divide by 2.5 so I quite quite so it's around about

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:16.500
that but over a hundred nanomoles per liter it would be your preference

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:20.500
yes and it really does make a big difference and that might mean giving like

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.140
10,000 units a day to bump it up over a thousand I mean the other thing there's

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:31.620
300 genes involved in absorbing it. Fauci was taken four thousand units per

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:39.900
day I think when he was on the Jennifer Garner Instagram podcast in 2020 he said

02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:43.220
he was taken four thousand units a day and producing the act component of the

02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:48.300
vitamin D3 most people are going to have a mild deficiency in one of those

02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:53.100
gene productions at some stage so I've seen people who have had very low

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:58.580
vitamin D and I'm a statement that they outdoor lives they have great nutrition

02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:03.500
and everything like that and they've got very low vitamin D's I again because I

02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:08.060
have to know explanations for all these things of course I signed this

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:14.060
except I said to this guy but I said you're super low it's like he deliberately

02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:17.900
avoided vitamin D tell me what you do because you're always out cycling in the

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:22.100
sun and it's so fit next I and he says well I get up in the morning I have my

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:27.860
breakfast and then I slap on my sunscreen and this that I go for a bike

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:35.460
I said what fact did he use he said 50 right well once I knew 50 I started

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:43.100
asking 50 is a complete block because it's even worse though because you're

02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:47.660
also putting things on your skin your skin is your immune barrier your skin

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:53.240
is not necessarily liking all the chemicals that are in that product so

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.780
not only are you robbing yourself of natural production of vitamin D which

02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:02.740
is now starting to seem so strange right that they were so insistent that we

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:07.300
needed to protect ourselves from the Sun and that we could use Sun cream to do

02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:13.940
it as opposed to you know like a a parasol which is really the sad part of

02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:19.100
this that's all we really needed is just stay in the shade like they do in

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:25.900
tropical countries and instead we sold products sold products sold chemicals

02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:33.740
that we put on our immune system on our barrier the largest organ in our body

02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:38.740
and these guys are talking about it now too like SPF 50 is not even what matters

02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:45.380
what what matters is the goo the garbage and we were clogging ourselves with

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:50.300
covering ourselves with some of the most sensitive skin our body is our face

02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:54.980
he's describing somebody putting it on his face every day

02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:03.420
while we have AOC on Instagram complaining about how sunscreen is is too

02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:11.180
highly regulated in America by the FDA that's her concern right now man we are

02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:14.660
making progress but we're not making progress it's like we're spinning our

02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:22.460
wheels in the deepest puddle of mud it's starting to be rewarding because the

02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:25.940
engines making noise and we're able to shift some gears and there's mud flying

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:32.060
everywhere and it's moving we're not going that far we need to focus we need

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:35.420
to get the attention of these people and start to explain to them the real depth

02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:39.660
and breadth of this delusion they're in under now the people using fact that you

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:42.900
are having super low bit of indeed even if they're out the Sun all the time so

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:47.260
it's far too strong and that's another global thing that the NHS and people

02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:50.540
should do they should remove fact that it's actually dangerous because it

02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:54.580
completely locks out the visible to cope with it indeed so anyway so that's

02:03:54.580 --> 02:04:00.540
how going back I think that's a hundred nanomoles is to a some people and then

02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:05.780
we put it this way I've seen nobody near a hundred who hasn't been taking

02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:11.220
supplements with one exception and I won't forget it I said this it was quite

02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:16.660
a elderly man yet now we treated him quite well and I said you know we need

02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:19.580
to make sure he has his vitamin D supplements things like that but I

02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:24.180
measure it first and when he came back he had a level like 97 98 which is near

02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:28.660
enough a hundred doctor and I said each shore he doesn't take any vitamin D

02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:32.620
and he said no no no he only takes he takes his aspirin and his heart tablets

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:38.340
and they said they walked out the door and his way popped back in that says do

02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:41.620
you know what though ever since I had put him on cod liver oil he's been

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:51.780
yeah let's go back to the other side was the the so-called bait they don't

02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.820
might mention that now they don't like anything but they're just dark cool and

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:59.300
skin all the early people who die in a dark kind of skin and they did another

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:04.020
report useless report which found it was every form of discrimination poverty

02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:08.180
deprivation they didn't mention a bit of the deeper I have never seen a dark

02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:13.220
kind of skin black and Asian person in the hospital that I've done I've never

02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:17.100
seen one of them with a bit of indio 30 unless somebody's got to the first

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:21.780
they're taking supplements that was the explanation for their end to death rate

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.780
that we had and now because it couldn't have been deprivation because it was

02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:31.340
right I mean there was many doctors the first opera consultants yeah they may

02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:36.980
argue that they're deprived but not everybody else later so that was the

02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:40.420
first and that was the thing I tried to get through to witty and again I mean

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:44.660
the guy is just I mean he really is totally unfit for purpose I mean why

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.860
hasn't been sacked or why hasn't resigned I have no idea he's absolutely

02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:50.740
grateful he kept saying again the game there's no need for a bit of indeed

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:55.140
like he didn't need to know about it yeah I'm pretty sure I got a message through

02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:58.180
to Chris witty via various political figures as well I'm pretty sure it got

02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:02.900
through I know Brian's Anderson did too but anyway there are four papers out

02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:06.500
there in retrospect showing that the bit of indeed had a better protection than

02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:10.620
any of the vaccine brain and the one that I think is the most important was a

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:13.660
big Spanish study which revealed that there's a lot of it in indeed

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:17.660
deficiency in Spain which I would not have thought that it is they avoid the

02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:20.540
sun and then when they're young they get leathery skin so we have a

02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:24.060
significant point and they did a retrospective study of everybody admitted

02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:28.860
to hospitals who ill of covid so they looked at everything and the only the

02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:34.060
only conclusion a meta analysis was it was really simple if your vitamin D

02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:38.460
level was below 30 when you went into hospital with covid you had a 77%

02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:44.140
chance of dying if it was over 75 you had a 2% chance that I don't need to

02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:48.660
bother my statistical department's heads in order to work out what's how

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:53.500
significant even I can cope with that one yeah it was unbelievable yeah I love

02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:56.740
this micro bacterium that you give so it's a simple micro bacterium that you

02:06:56.740 --> 02:07:00.540
kill it and you inject it and that produces a broad spectrum immunity

02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:04.300
against a variety of viruses potentially influenza potentially covid

02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:08.140
well if the reason it does it is because it boosts the innate immune

02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:12.260
loss so presumably the government by biting your hand off to get the rest of

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:18.180
your time I told them all about it and I mean once again you couldn't make it

02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:22.860
up I couldn't believe it Chris Witte said there wasn't enough animal work

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:27.240
done on it it had been in hundreds of patients we did have not had a single

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:31.800
SAE another example that is not fit well what's SAE sorry serious adverse

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.880
event yeah there's many of those I mean it actually is a very very safe

02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:40.680
vaccine it's a very very safe unlike Pfizer where if you go back to the

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:45.720
VAERS data that was released basically if you had a serious adverse event three

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:50.800
or four of which means here you have 3% chance of dying well nobody would get

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.360
a vaccine with a 3% chance of dying with an adverse event but it was covered up

02:07:54.360 --> 02:08:00.240
it was only released as you know that I caught demanded that on freedom

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.880
expression that it be released otherwise we never know so you're just using this

02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:08.240
vaccine in your own clinical trials I'm gonna fade this out

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:17.200
I need to get to bed on time tonight I have decided to make the commitment to

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:21.920
coach a sixth-grade basketball team this fall which means there's no way in

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:27.120
the hell I'm gonna be able to keep up nightly streaming but that doesn't mean

02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.520
much right now because it's not gonna start till November I just want to give

02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.920
you a heads-up that this utopian nightly delivery mechanism is not gonna last

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:44.960
that long probably make it to Halloween which might be 67 in a row I put the

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:50.960
chat in the chat this link I can still see it up there at 958 so if you want to

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.160
