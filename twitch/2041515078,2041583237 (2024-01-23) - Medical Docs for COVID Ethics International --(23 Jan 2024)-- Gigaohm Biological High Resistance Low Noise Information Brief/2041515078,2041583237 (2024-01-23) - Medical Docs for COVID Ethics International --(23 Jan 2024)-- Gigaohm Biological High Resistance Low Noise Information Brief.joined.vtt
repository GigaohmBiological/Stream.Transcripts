WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
This, for the purposes of Stephen here yet, where is he?

00:07.400 --> 00:10.720
He knows we get underway at five past on the dock.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.300
He'll come, he'll join us.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.400
All right, everybody, welcome to medical doctors

00:18.400 --> 00:22.400
for COVID ethics international and today's discussion.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.160
This group was founded by Dr. Stephen Frost.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.800
During the darkest days of the COVID scam response

00:27.800 --> 00:31.600
with a desire to pursue truth, ethics, justice,

00:31.600 --> 00:34.040
freedom and health.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.600
Stephen has stood up against government

00:35.600 --> 00:37.560
in power over the years and has been a whistleblower

00:37.560 --> 00:39.400
and activist, his medical specialist,

00:39.400 --> 00:40.960
his radiology, I'm Charles Covest,

00:40.960 --> 00:42.720
the moderator of the group.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.800
I must relate to his passion provocateur

00:44.800 --> 00:46.720
I've practiced law for 20 years

00:46.720 --> 00:48.840
before changing career 30 years ago.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.840
And over the last 13 years, I've helped parents

00:50.840 --> 00:54.480
and lawyers strategize remedies for vaccine damage.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.320
And damage from bad medical advice.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.080
The latest numbers we've heard is that,

00:59.080 --> 01:02.880
is that bad medical advice is now the number one killer

01:02.880 --> 01:04.280
in America.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.280
I'm also the CEO of an industrial hemp company.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.040
We comprise lots of professions here

01:09.040 --> 01:11.680
and we're from all around the world.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.760
Many of us thought that vaccines were okay,

01:13.760 --> 01:18.400
now many of us proudly say, yes, we are passionate anti-vexers.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.000
If this is your first time here, welcome

01:21.000 --> 01:23.720
and feel free to introduce yourself in the chat

01:23.720 --> 01:24.760
and where you're from.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.760
If you publish a newsletter or podcast

01:26.760 --> 01:29.480
or you have a radio or TV show or you've written a book,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.000
put the links into the chat

01:31.000 --> 01:33.320
so we can follow you, promote you and find you.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.320
And even if you've done it last week or the week before,

01:36.320 --> 01:37.720
keep putting it into the chat

01:37.720 --> 01:40.240
to make it easier for people to find.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.480
Most of us understand we're in the middle of World War III

01:42.480 --> 01:44.000
and that there are various battle lines

01:44.000 --> 01:46.360
as part of this war.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.040
Most of us understand the development of science

01:49.040 --> 01:51.160
and that the science is never settled.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.040
And then if someone tells you the science is settled,

01:54.080 --> 01:57.000
you know you're dealing with a fraud or an idiot.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.920
Some of us believe that viruses exist.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.320
Some of us believe that viruses are a hoax

02:03.320 --> 02:05.560
and some of us are on the fence on the matter.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.240
This meeting runs for two and a half hours

02:07.240 --> 02:09.640
after which for those with the time Tom Rodman

02:09.640 --> 02:11.720
runs a video telegram meeting.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.600
Tom puts the links into the chat if you're able to join.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.800
We will listen to JJ Couey.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.720
Our guest presenter for as long as JJ wishes to speak

02:19.720 --> 02:20.640
and then we have Q and A.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.520
This is the third time that JJ has joined us.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.480
His previous presentations are available

02:25.480 --> 02:27.520
on the Rumble channel.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.440
Stephen Frost by Longestubbies tradition

02:29.440 --> 02:31.480
asked the first questions for 15 minutes.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
There's no censorship.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.080
It's a free speech environment.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.440
Free speech is crucially important in our fight

02:37.440 --> 02:41.280
to preserve our human freedoms.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.240
If you're offended by anything be offended,

02:43.240 --> 02:44.640
we're genuinely not interested.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.920
We reject the offense industry that requires nobody

02:47.920 --> 02:50.280
to say anything that may offend another.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.280
I have a standard template of nine potential answers

02:53.280 --> 02:55.440
to somebody who says I'm offended.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.440
If you want that template put a note in the chat,

02:57.440 --> 02:58.800
I'll email it to you.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.560
It's very useful be ready with your response

03:01.560 --> 03:04.240
when someone says to you I'm offended.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.960
And also what's Ricky Gervais

03:05.960 --> 03:08.480
if you ever want to be amused by people

03:08.480 --> 03:09.880
who claim to be offended.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.080
We come with an attitude and perspective of love not fear.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.480
Fear is the opposite of love.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.200
Fear squashes you.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.400
Love on the other hand expands you.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.320
Before we start we were talking about Gandhi.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.680
The game plan clearly has to be non-violent,

03:27.680 --> 03:32.240
non-compliance with bad government behaviour.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.600
These twice weekly meetings are not just talk fest

03:35.600 --> 03:38.120
and extraordinary range of actions and initiatives

03:38.120 --> 03:41.360
have been generated from linkages made by attendees

03:41.360 --> 03:42.800
in these meetings.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.120
If you have a solution or a product or links or resources

03:45.120 --> 03:47.160
that will help you with the details in the chat,

03:47.160 --> 03:48.640
the meeting is recorded

03:48.640 --> 03:50.720
and he's uploaded on the Rumble channel.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.640
And now welcome to our guest presenter, Jonathan J. Couey

03:54.640 --> 03:57.120
globally renowned genius.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.880
And thank you, JJ, for giving us your time,

03:59.880 --> 04:01.560
wisdom and insights again.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.160
And thank you, Stephen Frost,

04:03.160 --> 04:07.040
for creating the group and for organising JJ to speak to us.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.000
JJ, we are in your hands there, Stephen.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.920
I've arrived and there's JJ.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.720
Hey, JJ, thanks for coming to speak to us.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.200
You're very welcome.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.520
Thank you all for taking the time to listen.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.360
I'm gonna try and go as quick as I can

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
because I know that you've heard me before

04:21.360 --> 04:24.080
and there's a lot of buzz about

04:24.080 --> 04:26.000
different recent conversations I've had

04:26.000 --> 04:28.480
including one with Wolfgang Wodarg.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.720
And so it might be that I cover the wrong things here.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.920
And so I'm gonna try and fly through it,

04:32.920 --> 04:36.240
but please keep in mind that I've done a presentation

04:36.240 --> 04:39.000
like this enough so I can handle an interruption

04:39.000 --> 04:40.760
and it might be easier if you interrupt

04:40.760 --> 04:42.800
when the question is relevant for everybody

04:42.800 --> 04:44.920
rather than waiting until the end.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.840
And so barring any, you know,

04:47.840 --> 04:49.520
if it becomes a thousand questions,

04:49.520 --> 04:50.640
obviously it's probably not good,

04:50.640 --> 04:52.880
but occasionally I don't mind at all.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.080
I need to-

04:55.080 --> 04:58.200
Hey, JJ, I'm happy to do that.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.280
So everybody, so today,

05:01.280 --> 05:03.080
because JJ has been with us so many times,

05:03.080 --> 05:05.280
we'll do it unusually.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.840
So if you wanna ask a question, JJ is good.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.360
You watch the screen, JJ, if you see your hand come up,

05:12.720 --> 05:14.240
you know, stop when you stop talking

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
and handle that question.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.120
Does that make sense, JJ?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.400
It does accept all the magic that I have.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.680
It makes it very hard for me to watch the Zoom

05:20.680 --> 05:22.320
so I can't really look for hands.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.880
Then I'll handle the hands up.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.800
Okay. Just put your hands up

05:25.800 --> 05:27.800
if you have a question pertinent to that issue.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
And then at the end, when JJ finishes,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.480
then we'll do the normal price.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.680
It's fantastic.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.320
JJ, how many times have you spoken to us?

05:35.320 --> 05:37.160
Is it three or more than three?

05:37.160 --> 05:38.000
I thought more.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.680
This could be the fourth time.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.520
I think so, yeah.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.360
This could be the fourth time.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.200
Yeah, very good.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.400
I'm gonna borrow a starting slide

05:45.400 --> 05:47.480
from my friend, Vera Sharav.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.160
I think Edward Bernese's statement is very important here.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.160
The conscious and intelligent manipulation

05:53.160 --> 05:55.320
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.480
There's an important element in democratic society

05:58.480 --> 06:00.800
and those who manipulate this unseen mechanism

06:00.800 --> 06:03.520
of society constitute an invisible government,

06:03.520 --> 06:06.680
which is the true ruling power of our country.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.080
And maybe now with the internet

06:09.080 --> 06:11.680
and with the who and other organizations

06:11.680 --> 06:14.000
around public health, it may be that

06:14.000 --> 06:17.160
this may be the mechanism by which they plan to rule

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
our global society.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.120
And I wanna start here all the time

06:21.120 --> 06:22.560
just to bring everybody up to speed.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.520
I apologize if it's a bothersome thing

06:24.520 --> 06:27.120
for those of you outside of the UK.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.240
But I've been trying to explain

06:29.240 --> 06:32.160
that we've been fooled into solving a mystery.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.520
And I use the example of a cartoon show

06:34.520 --> 06:36.200
from the United States called Scooby-Doo,

06:36.240 --> 06:39.760
where teenagers solve a mystery every week

06:39.760 --> 06:41.640
in the town that they're driving through.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.200
And it inevitably involves a monster

06:44.200 --> 06:45.920
that needs to have its mask removed

06:45.920 --> 06:47.800
and then the bad guys revealed to be someone

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
that was earlier in the show.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.880
What I am suggesting here

06:51.880 --> 06:54.360
and something that I wanna be very clear about

06:54.360 --> 06:57.680
is it's not in 2020 that this started,

06:57.680 --> 07:00.440
but it started a much longer time ago

07:00.440 --> 07:04.800
with the co-opting of certain investigative lines

07:05.640 --> 07:07.880
in primary literature in biology.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.800
And so by carefully co-opting certain narratives

07:11.800 --> 07:13.440
into the biological literature

07:13.440 --> 07:16.200
and importantly funding investigation

07:16.200 --> 07:20.800
into certain ideas in the primary literature,

07:20.800 --> 07:24.600
you can seed a series of papers over a series of years

07:24.600 --> 07:27.280
that can imply a danger that's not there.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
It can imply a link that's not there.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.120
One of the most spectacular ones from my own field

07:33.200 --> 07:35.680
is the preponderance of literature

07:35.680 --> 07:40.040
that's looking at correlations between genes and autism

07:40.040 --> 07:44.040
and often in animal models of autism.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.080
And so after many years of funding this kind of research,

07:47.080 --> 07:51.760
we have a whole foundation by which anyone

07:51.760 --> 07:54.760
who wants to justify the further investigation

07:54.760 --> 07:56.520
into the genetic causes of autism

07:56.520 --> 07:59.320
can simply cite all of these hundreds of papers

07:59.320 --> 08:01.680
and build their grand proposal from there.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.320
So it's a very dangerous sort of environment

08:04.320 --> 08:08.400
in which this pseudo-intellectual pursuit occurs

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
because you can't just ask any question you want.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.160
You've got to ask a question for which you can get funding.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.080
And oftentimes the way that academic biology

08:16.080 --> 08:19.080
makes progress is dictated solely

08:19.080 --> 08:20.960
by what questions they're allowed to ask.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.880
And with response, with regard to RNA viruses

08:24.880 --> 08:27.680
that that general academic pursuit

08:27.680 --> 08:30.160
has been hyper-controlled for a very long time.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.520
And I think if you reflect on all the people

08:32.520 --> 08:36.080
that are involved in virology and how virology

08:36.080 --> 08:40.880
from AIDS onward has been, let's say, scripted,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.000
you can see that there's some incongruency

08:43.000 --> 08:45.560
between the real biology that we can verify

08:45.560 --> 08:47.840
and the real biology that they claim.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.640
At the same time, of course, they've

08:49.640 --> 08:51.600
been running tabletop exercises.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.160
The most famous example of one is event 201.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.920
But of course, we can go back decades

08:58.920 --> 09:02.560
and see that there were many tabletop exercises looking

09:02.560 --> 09:07.640
at bioterrorism, what could be done and what could happen.

09:07.640 --> 09:12.040
Now, the trick with this is to understand, number three,

09:12.040 --> 09:15.120
is to understand that they have game to this out on a table

09:15.120 --> 09:17.880
and they've actually run it live before.

09:17.880 --> 09:22.800
There was a swine pandemic and swine flu pandemic in 1976

09:22.800 --> 09:24.320
that was part of this.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.880
There was one in 2009 that was part of this

09:26.880 --> 09:29.560
that afterward was analyzed over and over again,

09:29.560 --> 09:32.240
especially from different countries' perspectives

09:32.240 --> 09:35.040
and how the language barrier in a place like Belgium

09:35.040 --> 09:38.200
played a huge role in the uptake of the vaccine.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.960
They analyzed this like a post-war analysis

09:41.960 --> 09:45.040
of the battle plan and lamented about the fact

09:45.040 --> 09:47.400
that they didn't have the kind of social media reach

09:47.400 --> 09:50.000
in 2009 that they have now and that maybe they would have

09:50.000 --> 09:54.360
been more successful in the Flanders section of Belgium,

09:54.360 --> 09:58.080
the French speaking part had they been able to work

09:58.080 --> 10:00.000
into that language a little better.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.720
All of these things have been gamed in such a way

10:02.720 --> 10:06.200
so that this time around, the actual presentation

10:06.200 --> 10:09.320
of the narrative at the very beginning was hyper-controlled.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.480
Right down to the three word phrase, build back better

10:12.480 --> 10:15.720
or new normal, these kinds of things were just as,

10:15.720 --> 10:18.760
this is the obvious, this is the one they made videos about

10:18.760 --> 10:20.640
so that everybody got excited about.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.920
Look, all these world leaders are saying,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.200
build back better but nobody got really suspicious

10:27.200 --> 10:30.200
about some of the other things that everyone was agreeing

10:30.200 --> 10:33.000
about including the fact that this was a pandemic.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.400
The attributes of the pandemic were actually early on,

10:37.400 --> 10:40.520
seeded in such a way, I believe so that the narrative

10:40.520 --> 10:43.200
of worst case scenario was present from the beginning

10:43.200 --> 10:47.560
and that people could already consider in January of 2020

10:47.560 --> 10:49.240
that if these people are lying about it

10:49.240 --> 10:50.880
and it is the worst case scenario,

10:50.880 --> 10:53.840
we could all lose several people in our lives.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.240
That billions of people were gonna die.

10:56.240 --> 11:00.080
And so this worst case scenario was extremely important.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.520
Number one, to make sure that everybody complied

11:02.520 --> 11:05.680
from masks to lockdowns to getting iPads

11:05.680 --> 11:08.400
and putting your kids in front of them,

11:08.400 --> 11:11.120
all the way eventually to the end of 2020

11:11.120 --> 11:14.080
where the transfections using dentovirus

11:14.080 --> 11:18.600
or using mRNA and lipid nanoparticles were taken gladly

11:18.600 --> 11:20.760
because of the fear of worst case scenario.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.160
They of course told this story under the pretense

11:24.160 --> 11:27.640
of a national security response

11:27.640 --> 11:30.120
and so the people that were curating this narrative

11:30.120 --> 11:32.360
were also kind of under some constraints

11:32.360 --> 11:35.640
under what they could say and were required to say

11:35.640 --> 11:38.640
that we're at war with this virus and that is biblical.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.480
And finally, the whole idea and I really believe this

11:42.480 --> 11:45.760
with all of my heart that one of the main objectives

11:45.760 --> 11:48.280
of the original three years was to make sure

11:48.480 --> 11:52.440
that a story about a virus spike protein could be confounded

11:52.440 --> 11:56.160
with the story of transfection to that spike protein

11:56.160 --> 11:58.240
so that when transfection didn't work out

11:58.240 --> 12:00.160
as well as they hoped it would,

12:00.160 --> 12:02.360
they would be able to blame it on the poor,

12:02.360 --> 12:06.400
rust choice of the spike protein as the transfection target

12:06.400 --> 12:08.960
rather than transfection in general.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.800
And now we can move on to subsequent generations

12:11.800 --> 12:13.360
of this technology,

12:13.360 --> 12:16.600
purporting to solve some of the problems that are there.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.800
And I will include the double-stranded DNA contamination

12:20.800 --> 12:24.680
in this general ruse to try and confuse us

12:24.680 --> 12:26.720
about what effects are coming from where.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.040
Early, what I want is high morbidity.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.760
I want people to complain.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.000
So what do I do?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.280
I go to Des Moines.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.600
Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen,

12:35.600 --> 12:36.640
I have nothing against Des Moines.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.760
I live there for four years.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.000
I go to Des Moines.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.080
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.440
I go to Seattle.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.520
I infect a couple of cases there.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.440
Okay, so we've listened to this video before.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.400
This video is Dr. Giordano.

12:49.400 --> 12:54.320
Dr. I can't remember his first name, shoot.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.160
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.640
Dr. Giordano, he works for the US Army

12:57.640 --> 12:59.640
and he's explaining here

12:59.640 --> 13:04.360
how a seeding of a few annoying cases

13:04.360 --> 13:06.920
using a toxin or some other substance

13:06.920 --> 13:08.720
which would cause people to go to the hospital

13:08.720 --> 13:12.480
and complain could be combined with an internet campaign

13:12.480 --> 13:14.880
to create the illusion of spread.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.280
And then that illusion of spread could be claimed

13:17.280 --> 13:21.680
by a terrorist group and also denied by governments

13:21.680 --> 13:24.600
and you could cause confusion that would cause a rift

13:24.600 --> 13:26.960
between the populace and their government

13:26.960 --> 13:29.960
and that would ruin a country over time.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.320
Now, although this is not exactly what I think happened,

13:33.320 --> 13:36.400
I think that this presentation from 2017

13:36.400 --> 13:39.360
really puts out an outline which we need to consider

13:39.360 --> 13:43.080
as a real possibility has an alternative to the idea

13:43.080 --> 13:45.760
that either a natural or a lab leak virus

13:45.760 --> 13:49.000
has circulated the globe for the last four and a half years

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
and that it has changed its flavor several times

13:51.960 --> 13:57.120
across the entire globe in a sort of almost,

13:57.120 --> 13:59.840
I don't know, color changing kind of manner.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.720
This story doesn't have any foundation in biology

14:02.720 --> 14:06.400
but this one has stories in, has a foundation

14:06.400 --> 14:11.080
in military lectures, it has a foundation in biology

14:11.160 --> 14:14.040
and it has a foundation in previous tabletop exercises

14:14.040 --> 14:16.680
which discussed these kinds of things.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.000
So number one, a military response with the ability

14:19.000 --> 14:21.200
to drive local mass casualty events.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.480
I believe that it's very possible that in the places

14:24.480 --> 14:28.200
where the script called for a lot of people to get sick

14:28.200 --> 14:30.000
and there was also a military presence

14:30.000 --> 14:34.240
to make sure that that appearance was maintained.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.080
Doesn't necessarily mean that 20,000 people were killed

14:37.080 --> 14:38.320
in four weeks in New York

14:38.320 --> 14:40.520
but that seems to be the numbers right now.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.280
We don't have death certificates,

14:42.280 --> 14:43.920
we don't have any firm evidence

14:43.920 --> 14:45.800
of where these 20,000's bodies went

14:45.800 --> 14:48.160
but the numbers that are officially reported

14:48.160 --> 14:52.120
are a mass casualty events that begins and ends in four weeks.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.400
There's no evidence of spread after that

14:54.400 --> 14:56.360
and these numbers need to be corroborated

14:56.360 --> 14:58.800
because again, the New York City was a place

14:58.800 --> 15:01.160
where lots of people rushed to help

15:01.160 --> 15:03.280
including people like Pierre Corey

15:03.280 --> 15:07.640
who although he came after that 20,000 deaths event

15:07.640 --> 15:09.840
was very quickly in front of the US Senate

15:09.840 --> 15:11.880
telling about how this was a war

15:11.880 --> 15:14.840
and that this was crazy deadly

15:14.840 --> 15:16.800
and that it was a real battle.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.680
And so we've got to be very careful here

15:19.680 --> 15:22.160
because it's very likely at the beginning of the pandemic

15:22.160 --> 15:25.320
in these places where these mass casualty events were occurred,

15:25.320 --> 15:27.440
people were also co-opted.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.280
They walked in, they said,

15:28.280 --> 15:29.960
hey, this is a national security thing,

15:29.960 --> 15:31.600
we don't know how bad it's gonna be.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.040
It could be worst case scenario, we need your help.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.680
We're glad you came

15:36.680 --> 15:39.160
but we need this message delivered to social media.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.440
You're a credible guy, I think you can handle it

15:41.440 --> 15:44.520
but you're gonna have to stay on script a little bit

15:44.520 --> 15:45.920
because the worst case scenario,

15:45.920 --> 15:49.240
we need everybody to believe it so that they comply

15:49.240 --> 15:51.160
so that they lock down so that they wear their masks

15:51.160 --> 15:53.480
so that we figure out whether this is really bad

15:53.480 --> 15:55.040
or whether it's ongoing.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.520
And so they could have scared it, threatened him.

15:57.520 --> 16:01.000
Not saying that anybody was given a suitcase of cash

16:01.000 --> 16:03.440
and that's how they did this.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.080
I'm saying that the people who ran this

16:06.080 --> 16:08.400
used the worst case scenario to co-opt

16:08.400 --> 16:11.440
all of these people to make sure that they stayed on narrative.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.160
And at the same time in the background,

16:13.160 --> 16:16.480
there are financial and legal incentives to declare COVID.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.520
And at the same time, there's this social media campaign

16:20.520 --> 16:22.400
where the worst case scenario of a lab leak

16:22.400 --> 16:24.960
is already being whispered about.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.080
And at the same time, there are people on regular TV

16:28.080 --> 16:29.960
already denying that that's crazy.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.160
And now if you institute inside of hospitals,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.920
little tweaks to different knobs,

16:37.920 --> 16:40.040
little tweaks to different procedures

16:40.040 --> 16:44.200
so that the average all cause mortality goes up.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.880
And then you have a couple specific things

16:45.880 --> 16:49.040
that when they test positive or they're suspected

16:49.040 --> 16:51.560
of being COVID, you can get a lot of money

16:51.560 --> 16:53.320
if you put them on this protocol

16:53.320 --> 16:56.040
and you're also free of legal obligation

16:56.040 --> 16:57.880
if you put them on this protocol.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.480
Then there's gonna be a lot of hospitals,

17:00.480 --> 17:03.920
especially in America who are gonna put them on this protocol.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.200
If you also combine that with social policies

17:06.200 --> 17:09.280
like do not resuscitate orders to EMTs

17:09.280 --> 17:13.400
or any countless other ways that they mistreated

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
old people in nursing homes,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.600
you can also increase all cause mortality

17:17.600 --> 17:20.840
under the umbrella of this spreading COVID virus.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.000
Emergency social policies and these COVID hospital protocols

17:24.000 --> 17:27.080
then need to be ignored by the people

17:27.080 --> 17:29.280
who are perpetuating the worst case scenario narrative,

17:29.280 --> 17:30.280
not because they're mean,

17:30.280 --> 17:33.640
but because this is part of the way that this would work.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.960
We didn't know anything then.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.800
There were no numbers.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.640
We can look back now and look like,

17:37.640 --> 17:38.800
wow, you should have known better,

17:38.800 --> 17:40.600
but we really can't say it then.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.840
And that's how I got stuck into this too.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.080
That's the reason they convinced the public

17:46.080 --> 17:48.960
that a lab leak cover up was happening before their eyes.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.080
I was involved in a drastic Twitter group

17:51.080 --> 17:53.640
that also convinced me that I was breaking the story

17:53.640 --> 17:56.280
of a lab leak right before my eyes.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.140
I felt like I was being a hero.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.120
And so they roped us in to figuring this mystery out

18:03.120 --> 18:04.600
and to fighting about it.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.760
And all the while they also used Australia and New Zealand

18:09.760 --> 18:12.600
as lockdown examples where they threw people on the ground

18:12.600 --> 18:14.160
and forced them to get in masks

18:14.160 --> 18:16.320
and they brought them to trailers away from their house

18:16.320 --> 18:18.260
to be quarantined.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.320
They couldn't do that in America,

18:20.320 --> 18:23.080
but they needed to show the rest of the world

18:23.080 --> 18:24.680
what could be done and what might work,

18:24.680 --> 18:26.920
what a real lockdown looks like.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.240
Then they needed people like Brett Weinstein in America

18:29.240 --> 18:31.400
to complain that while we didn't lockdown hard enough,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.860
otherwise we'd already be at zero COVID.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.580
Zero COVID being a real thing that we talked about

18:37.580 --> 18:39.380
for two years that we've all forgotten about,

18:39.380 --> 18:40.740
but that was a real debate.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.740
And so the way that they hid all of this activity

18:46.740 --> 18:49.540
was to just agree that we're gonna talk about a novel virus,

18:49.540 --> 18:51.940
we're gonna talk about millions of people died,

18:51.940 --> 18:54.220
we're gonna talk about millions more could be saved,

18:54.220 --> 18:55.580
you just listen to me,

18:55.580 --> 18:57.300
and we're gonna talk about gain a function

18:57.300 --> 18:59.900
being a real likely source of it.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.900
And therefore this danger will come again and again.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.180
And if you don't question this stuff,

19:04.180 --> 19:05.620
you can say anything else.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.900
And they have been laying this narrative for decades

19:10.900 --> 19:13.740
that cell culture and animal passage

19:13.740 --> 19:16.340
can access pandemic potential

19:16.340 --> 19:19.580
and now we can stitch them together and it's even worse.

19:19.580 --> 19:22.660
And they want us to pass this idea onto our children

19:22.660 --> 19:25.340
so that they grow up with these boogeymen forever,

19:25.340 --> 19:27.980
that this mythology governs their behavior.

19:28.820 --> 19:33.620
And I believe there are a number of people on the internet

19:33.620 --> 19:35.780
that were recruited before the pandemic,

19:35.780 --> 19:37.060
for narrative control,

19:37.060 --> 19:39.060
not even knowing there was gonna be a pandemic,

19:39.060 --> 19:40.860
just thinking that, wow, I get to help out

19:40.860 --> 19:43.540
with the governance structure of America

19:43.540 --> 19:45.980
by being the new social media, the new media,

19:45.980 --> 19:48.620
the new mainstream media, I get to be that guy,

19:48.620 --> 19:49.700
that's so fun.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.820
Joe Rogan doesn't have a $100 million contract on Spotify

19:54.820 --> 19:55.660
for nothing.

19:58.820 --> 20:02.100
And so we had guys like this in America

20:02.100 --> 20:06.620
in February of 2020, listen carefully.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.460
Help.

20:07.460 --> 20:11.140
Bit but I kid you now.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.180
Come back where we're from.

20:12.180 --> 20:14.500
People come in.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.340
Or you can't hear it.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.340
They die.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.660
Just try again, JJ.

20:18.660 --> 20:19.580
Try again, JJ.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.980
Maybe I have to switch my sound settings.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.340
We can hear it just a bit muffled to the start.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.380
Oh, okay, that's good.

20:26.380 --> 20:27.340
All right, I'll play it.

20:27.380 --> 20:28.700
Sorry, it's very quick.

20:30.140 --> 20:30.980
Biblical.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.260
I kid you now.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.380
People come in, I get intubated.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.460
They die.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.540
The cycle repeats.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.300
You overwhelmed?

20:43.300 --> 20:44.780
Yeah, the systems overwhelmed.

20:44.780 --> 20:46.420
All over the place.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.020
My daughters and intern in Brooklyn,

20:49.020 --> 20:52.580
first year resident, she starts the ICU today.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.780
I couldn't sleep last night.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.660
It's scary.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.500
9-11.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.740
Now what you know here, sorry, he says one more thing.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.220
He said 9-11 is nothing compared to this.

21:04.220 --> 21:06.220
Now what's important to see is that that guy

21:06.220 --> 21:08.260
was also featured on Tucker Carlson.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.700
So even though we now know when we look back

21:12.700 --> 21:15.220
at New York City, most of the hospitals were empty.

21:16.220 --> 21:19.900
That guy was on Fox News telling the United States

21:19.900 --> 21:23.940
the whole world that it was biblical, like hell.

21:23.940 --> 21:27.540
And they had world leaders saying that it was a pandemic

21:27.540 --> 21:29.100
and it's the new normal.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.220
We're gonna build back better.

21:30.220 --> 21:31.900
They had people on the news saying this.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.660
They had virologists agreeing that the ACE2 receptor,

21:34.660 --> 21:38.140
her ACE2 receptor affinity,

21:38.140 --> 21:40.180
sure seems to indicate that they enriched this

21:40.180 --> 21:43.580
in a laboratory, maybe even with humanized mice.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.860
And none of these people acknowledged

21:47.860 --> 21:52.380
that there was this huge propaganda campaign

21:52.380 --> 21:54.340
that caused fear and uncertainty and doubt.

21:54.340 --> 21:59.340
They sent old attending physicians home

21:59.820 --> 22:01.620
because the virus was so dangerous

22:01.620 --> 22:04.260
you didn't want these people that were near retirement

22:04.260 --> 22:07.900
to be in the OR or into the ER rather.

22:07.900 --> 22:11.700
They sent old professors home from universities

22:11.700 --> 22:13.940
said, don't come in, you should just take early retirement

22:13.940 --> 22:16.140
because if you come into a university

22:16.140 --> 22:19.380
you could get this terrible thing and you could die.

22:19.940 --> 22:22.740
They told people not to resuscitate people

22:22.740 --> 22:25.740
because you'll spread the virus when you give them CPR.

22:25.740 --> 22:28.660
You better use ventilators with a higher pressure setting

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
than you've ever used before

22:29.660 --> 22:32.260
because otherwise they might spread the virus.

22:32.260 --> 22:35.380
Yeah, but these people can talk, that doesn't matter.

22:35.380 --> 22:39.020
Sedate them and vent them because they get COVID money then.

22:39.020 --> 22:43.460
$35,000 a person and they get no,

22:43.460 --> 22:47.460
there's no liability for the care of that person

22:48.300 --> 22:50.580
if they designated them COVID.

22:50.580 --> 22:53.660
Lack of antibiotic use was just built into the protocol.

22:53.660 --> 22:56.460
Poor use of steroids was just built into the protocol.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.700
Eventually, Madazzalam and Remdesivir

22:58.700 --> 23:00.340
was built into the protocol.

23:00.340 --> 23:03.620
The opioid deaths have gone up every year in America

23:03.620 --> 23:06.980
since 2017 or something like that.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.420
But since the start of the pandemic

23:08.420 --> 23:10.980
they're going up much more rapidly.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.540
These are not excess deaths that can be discounted

23:13.540 --> 23:14.580
but they are excess deaths

23:14.580 --> 23:16.460
that very easily hospital administrators

23:16.940 --> 23:19.260
could call COVID and did.

23:20.420 --> 23:23.940
More importantly, these deaths happen across age groups

23:23.940 --> 23:27.220
which reduce the expected lifespan of America

23:27.220 --> 23:28.780
and then they can be pointed to us saying,

23:28.780 --> 23:30.780
look at what COVID did.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.820
And without any honest accounting

23:32.820 --> 23:34.380
of what's actually happening in America,

23:34.380 --> 23:36.580
what's actually killing people in America,

23:36.580 --> 23:38.460
these deaths are getting mixed up as COVID

23:38.460 --> 23:40.980
because they only care about excess.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.980
And if you compute it wrong, all of those are excess.

23:44.060 --> 23:46.460
Death certificate fraud, financial incentives

23:46.460 --> 23:47.740
and then we go to track and trace

23:47.740 --> 23:50.220
which happened in America for literally a year.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.980
They had whole companies that were making phone calls

23:52.980 --> 23:55.420
to warn you that somebody that you work with

23:55.420 --> 23:58.580
was tested positive and then we go all the way back

23:58.580 --> 24:00.780
to the beginning and we find this PCR fraud,

24:00.780 --> 24:04.100
this lateral flow test fraud and likely sequencing fraud

24:04.100 --> 24:05.900
which we have all come to accept

24:05.900 --> 24:08.140
as being evidence of something which it's not.

24:08.140 --> 24:10.780
And we've come to accept that evidence

24:10.780 --> 24:13.900
because no matter who we got into arguments

24:13.900 --> 24:15.740
with, they just seem to all be stuck

24:15.740 --> 24:18.340
on this novel virus as being real.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.780
It's the limited spectrum of debate

24:20.780 --> 24:22.940
that we've been trapped in for four years.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.260
It's the way that we get our family and friends out

24:26.260 --> 24:29.500
is by alerting them to the idea

24:29.500 --> 24:31.260
that this hasn't been a vigorous debate.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.100
It's been a very limited debate,

24:33.100 --> 24:36.020
actually tricked you into solving a mystery

24:36.020 --> 24:37.900
that got you to accept their monster.

24:38.740 --> 24:41.020
They started us out in the beginning of the pandemic

24:41.020 --> 24:43.020
at a lonely road all by ourselves

24:43.020 --> 24:45.780
with only social media and mainstream media

24:45.780 --> 24:47.500
to look to besides our family.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.940
And then no matter who you got in the car with,

24:50.940 --> 24:53.180
they were gonna tell you a story about a novel virus

24:53.180 --> 24:55.220
that killed millions, that we should be able to save

24:55.220 --> 24:56.940
more people from if we would just give them

24:56.940 --> 24:59.180
these novel treatments and gain a function.

24:59.180 --> 25:02.680
It's definitely a possibility and the virus will come again.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.740
And so it didn't matter who you chose.

25:06.740 --> 25:07.980
It was a random cards.

25:07.980 --> 25:10.100
If you got lucky and chose Mike Eden,

25:10.100 --> 25:13.100
well, and maybe you were losing your mind for three years

25:13.100 --> 25:14.780
because no one else agreed with you.

25:14.780 --> 25:18.100
If you heard Wolfgang Wodarg before he stopped speaking up

25:18.100 --> 25:22.580
because of censorship, he might've been gone crazy by now.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.220
But if you found any of these other people on TV

25:25.220 --> 25:27.940
or on social media, you're still hot in the debate

25:27.940 --> 25:30.780
about, oh my gosh, these people were lying to me.

25:30.780 --> 25:34.180
Brett Weinstein was hot on this telling about lab leak

25:34.180 --> 25:35.020
and natural virus.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.140
He even had a member of drastic on his show

25:37.140 --> 25:39.020
named Yuri Dagen, who was the first guy

25:39.020 --> 25:40.700
to identify the fear and cleavage site

25:40.700 --> 25:44.180
that supposedly set this from a normal average coronavirus

25:44.180 --> 25:45.820
into something that could skirt the world

25:45.820 --> 25:47.660
for five years like a lighting bolt.

25:51.780 --> 25:55.540
Most recently, I got courted by one of the things

25:55.540 --> 25:57.980
that happened not most recently, but most relevant

25:57.980 --> 26:01.220
to the story I wanna tell you today is that Charles Rixi,

26:01.220 --> 26:03.500
a member of drastic and an American,

26:03.500 --> 26:06.260
came to my house in Pittsburgh to convince me

26:06.300 --> 26:09.380
that my assessment of the diffuse proposal,

26:09.380 --> 26:12.340
which is a leaked grant proposal, which supposedly

26:12.340 --> 26:14.900
describes the insertion of fear and cleavage sites

26:14.900 --> 26:18.540
into coronaviruses and them spraying them into bad caves

26:18.540 --> 26:22.380
by eco-health alliance, was likely a fake.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.100
I said that the moment that anybody showed it to me,

26:25.100 --> 26:26.940
I said, that's gotta be a fake.

26:26.940 --> 26:29.860
There's no way that anybody would've written

26:29.860 --> 26:31.780
that grant proposal and if they did write that

26:31.780 --> 26:33.620
grant proposal, they wrote it just so that people

26:33.620 --> 26:35.580
would believe that these experiments would be done.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.220
They're ridiculous and even if they did them,

26:38.220 --> 26:41.260
my current conclusion is this doesn't create

26:41.260 --> 26:44.820
pandemic potential, but it does create this ongoing debate

26:44.820 --> 26:46.900
about whether that's pandemic potential or not,

26:46.900 --> 26:49.020
which is the scooby-doo to begin with.

26:49.020 --> 26:51.180
So this guy was involved in that.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.420
He actually came to my house.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.380
He's one of the people who claims that he released

26:54.380 --> 26:57.220
the diffuse proposal to the public.

26:57.220 --> 27:00.220
Now, why is this important with regard to Kevin McKernan?

27:00.220 --> 27:02.540
Well, Kevin McKernan is this guy who worked

27:02.540 --> 27:05.140
for the Human Genome Project.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.700
He's not a doctor or a PhD, but he's a very clever guy.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.820
He's sold a lot of patents to different companies,

27:10.820 --> 27:11.900
a lot of companies.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.340
He's sold or got bought out because he's got a lot

27:14.340 --> 27:16.180
of ideas about how to sequence DNA.

27:16.180 --> 27:18.740
So there's no question that he's sharp as a knife.

27:18.740 --> 27:21.020
The deal is, though, is that he's been on my stream,

27:21.020 --> 27:24.700
at least twice he came on my stream in the first two years

27:24.700 --> 27:26.980
to talk about the transfection, to talk about

27:26.980 --> 27:29.260
the RNA impurities, to talk about what would happen

27:29.260 --> 27:31.500
when they code on optimized the RNA.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.220
And so we had an ongoing relationship,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.420
but at some point in time, that ongoing relationship

27:36.420 --> 27:38.780
tumbled and stopped, because I said

27:38.780 --> 27:41.780
that the double-stranded DNA in the shot

27:41.780 --> 27:44.300
was probably not the worst thing that's in there.

27:44.300 --> 27:47.060
And even if that wasn't in there, it would still be bad,

27:47.060 --> 27:48.940
which is what I thought we agreed on already

27:48.940 --> 27:51.820
with the previous two times we had discussed this.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.700
However, that kind of fell apart.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.500
Why is that interesting?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.580
Well, it's interesting because after being blocked

27:57.580 --> 27:59.980
for over a year, it looks like Robert Malone

27:59.980 --> 28:04.420
is promoting Kevin McKernan and a particular article.

28:04.420 --> 28:07.340
It's a particular article about the diffuse proposal

28:07.340 --> 28:11.540
and about how the diffuse proposal has had some extra evidence

28:11.540 --> 28:18.540
brought forth because a FOIA request reported by Emily Koff

28:20.620 --> 28:23.180
has shown that they ordered some of the enzymes

28:23.180 --> 28:25.100
that would have been needed in the proposal,

28:25.100 --> 28:27.020
that they had some email conversations

28:27.020 --> 28:29.060
about the contents of the proposal.

28:29.060 --> 28:33.900
So these other orbiting documents are argued

28:33.900 --> 28:36.700
by Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan,

28:36.700 --> 28:39.300
a guy by the name of Archimetic, and Jessica Rose,

28:39.300 --> 28:43.780
all to be further evidence that the diffuse proposal

28:43.780 --> 28:46.820
is real, that they actually put fear and cleavage sites

28:46.820 --> 28:49.620
into coronaviruses and they sprayed them into bat caves.

28:49.620 --> 28:52.700
And so the implication is, is that they made it

28:52.700 --> 28:54.900
and that an RNA did circulate the globe

28:54.900 --> 28:57.980
for the last four years and is still circulating.

28:58.020 --> 28:59.940
Now, I wanna put reference to the fact

28:59.940 --> 29:02.580
that I also wrote an article about this at the time

29:02.580 --> 29:05.580
that the paper came out with, none other than Charles Rixi,

29:05.580 --> 29:07.860
that guy that came to my house,

29:07.860 --> 29:12.420
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the CHD Defender.

29:12.420 --> 29:15.540
In that article, I acknowledge that the diffuse proposal

29:15.540 --> 29:19.860
has this methodology in it, but I was already at that point

29:19.860 --> 29:22.420
telling Bobby that you have to consider the possibility

29:22.420 --> 29:25.500
that the diffuse proposal is a fake with the design

29:25.500 --> 29:27.940
of trying to get people to buy into this lab leak thing

29:27.940 --> 29:32.340
because a lab leak implies a virus with unknown potential.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.300
It could be an unknown level of deadly,

29:34.300 --> 29:39.020
an unknown level of stable, an unknown level of whatever

29:39.020 --> 29:42.020
because it's not natural and that's the whole,

29:42.020 --> 29:43.660
that's the whole beauty of the Scooby-Doo.

29:43.660 --> 29:45.940
Once you start accepting this as a mystery,

29:45.940 --> 29:48.820
you need to solve, you're accepting that boogeyman.

29:49.820 --> 29:52.660
And so what's interesting about the promotion of this

29:52.660 --> 29:54.860
is that it all seems to be a concerted effort

29:54.860 --> 29:56.820
to make diffuse real again.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.060
Why is that interesting?

29:58.060 --> 30:02.020
Well, because I think this all spun out of control

30:02.020 --> 30:05.100
when I started to talk about what clones are.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.220
And I think that this has a lot to do with this

30:07.220 --> 30:09.900
because if you look in the comments section

30:09.900 --> 30:13.420
of this actual post, you will find a comment

30:13.420 --> 30:16.820
about Kevin McCurnan, the author of this,

30:16.820 --> 30:20.860
makes to a subscriber or follower of me.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.660
And so I just wanna read this.

30:23.660 --> 30:26.780
I know it's sometimes annoying to have somebody read something

30:26.780 --> 30:29.980
but it's a little small and I wanna make some points

30:29.980 --> 30:31.700
about what this is and then we're gonna listen

30:31.700 --> 30:35.020
to what we're gonna discuss what this is really all about.

30:35.020 --> 30:38.660
So this is somebody who said that what about clones

30:38.660 --> 30:42.180
and the fact that RNA can't go around the world

30:42.180 --> 30:43.940
with high fidelity for many years.

30:43.940 --> 30:47.500
That's the basic 30,000 foot message

30:47.500 --> 30:49.940
that I've had for a while you're probably familiar with.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.340
This is common, remember this is a response

30:52.340 --> 30:54.340
from Kevin McCurnan, the guy who has been going

30:54.340 --> 30:57.060
around the world on lots of podcasts

30:57.060 --> 30:59.780
telling people that there's double stranded DNA contamination

30:59.780 --> 31:02.900
in the shot and that that means that all these guys

31:02.900 --> 31:04.700
are bad guys and that it could explain

31:04.700 --> 31:06.580
all of the problems that we've been having

31:06.580 --> 31:09.660
which I really believe is a red herring.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.700
So here we go.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.940
This is common JJ Cooley bio-babble slash folklore.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.820
Coronaviruses circulate the globe every year.

31:18.820 --> 31:21.340
There is no reason why an engineered version

31:21.340 --> 31:23.660
could not do the same given it was derived

31:23.660 --> 31:25.820
from parts of viruses that have been doing this

31:25.820 --> 31:26.740
for millions of years.

31:26.740 --> 31:30.700
So I have the virology textbook behind my head here

31:30.700 --> 31:33.860
because I want to emphasize that Kevin McCurnan,

31:33.860 --> 31:35.860
the guy who worked for the Human Genome Project

31:35.860 --> 31:39.180
and now has a marijuana genetics company

31:39.180 --> 31:42.180
I mean and lives on the Atlantic Ocean

31:42.180 --> 31:45.060
in a very beautiful house whose brothers

31:45.060 --> 31:48.540
have several companies about testing for cancer

31:48.540 --> 31:52.260
and that his father was an absolutely giant

31:53.260 --> 31:56.500
set their family up really well as a successful businessman.

31:56.500 --> 32:00.780
This guy is no business, no reason to waste any of his time

32:00.780 --> 32:03.580
coming against a guy who's renting his house in Pittsburgh

32:03.580 --> 32:07.020
and streams from his garage with less than 3000 people.

32:07.020 --> 32:12.020
But here he is already 100% on the virology that the NIH

32:13.540 --> 32:16.780
and the who and the CDC and everybody else

32:16.780 --> 32:19.180
would love you to believe coronaviruses circulate

32:19.180 --> 32:20.620
the globe every year and there's no reason

32:20.620 --> 32:23.220
why an engineered one couldn't do the same.

32:23.220 --> 32:26.220
In this case, someone spent the effort to hyper optimize

32:26.220 --> 32:28.420
the COVID-19 ACE2 binding affinity

32:28.420 --> 32:30.500
so that would spread far and wide.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.860
That's weird because the first year and a half

32:32.860 --> 32:34.820
we were debating about the fact that it had a fear

32:34.820 --> 32:38.740
and cleavage site which made it very infectious.

32:38.740 --> 32:41.180
Now he's saying that it was actually the ACE2 affinity

32:41.180 --> 32:42.020
that caused that.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.540
I thought the ACE2 affinity had something more to do

32:45.020 --> 32:50.020
with how many people it would infect or how easily

32:50.260 --> 32:51.100
it could infect people.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.140
But the fact that it would go throughout the body

32:53.140 --> 32:55.620
and be very systemic and that when you coughed it out

32:55.620 --> 32:57.340
it would already be ready to bind

32:57.340 --> 32:59.100
was the fear and cleavage site.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.300
The fault in this logic is assuming the spread initiated

33:02.300 --> 33:05.580
when Chinese claimed it did in 2019

33:05.580 --> 33:07.900
when in fact there's evidence of prior circulation.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.980
This is also important because this is the opposite

33:09.980 --> 33:11.220
of what I said.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.700
Prior circulation gives time for it to achieve

33:13.780 --> 33:14.820
an endemic state.

33:14.820 --> 33:17.700
We've already said that it's likely that the background

33:17.700 --> 33:22.700
endemic RNA signal is being confounded with new spread.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.940
The most efficient mechanism would be the package of virus

33:25.940 --> 33:27.900
and infect a few people in the city.

33:27.900 --> 33:32.100
Exactly as Giordano's lecture tells us

33:32.100 --> 33:33.900
and exactly as I've been teaching

33:33.900 --> 33:36.820
for the last almost three years.

33:36.820 --> 33:41.820
So again, this is a January 19th, 2024 post

33:41.820 --> 33:46.820
about my ideas and he says that the seeding clone hypothesis

33:47.540 --> 33:52.060
is chemtrail retarded, dropping clones everywhere,

33:52.060 --> 33:54.220
hoping for magical transfection to occur

33:54.220 --> 33:56.100
while having an endless parade of spies

33:56.100 --> 33:59.460
dropping spreading these clones around his keystone cop

33:59.460 --> 34:01.700
when packaged virus will perform

34:01.700 --> 34:03.260
all this skullduggery for you.

34:03.260 --> 34:05.660
So he wants you to believe that viruses

34:05.660 --> 34:07.420
are something very different than clones.

34:07.460 --> 34:12.460
When virology acknowledges and actually thousands of papers

34:13.300 --> 34:15.700
that clones are their best approximation

34:15.700 --> 34:17.780
of what they can barely find in nature.

34:17.780 --> 34:22.100
So it's a direct inversion of what I have to believe he knows

34:22.100 --> 34:24.540
is the truth about RNA virology.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.220
You expose yourself to infinite more disclosure points

34:27.220 --> 34:28.060
gonna get caught.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.940
So leaking the virus provides camouflage,

34:29.940 --> 34:31.700
plausible diet ability.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.700
So here we are again being forced back

34:33.700 --> 34:35.420
into solving the mystery.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.860
So this is the final insult.

34:36.860 --> 34:40.980
The keystone cop clone chemtrail hypothesis requires teams

34:40.980 --> 34:43.980
of covert people and frankly is stupid

34:43.980 --> 34:45.620
if you know how to package a virus.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.900
Well, this is curious because that's not the argument

34:48.900 --> 34:49.740
that I'm making.

34:49.740 --> 34:51.260
So I wanna clarify that first.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.860
The argument that I'm making is that the cartoon version

34:56.860 --> 34:58.780
of the infectious cycle is incorrect

34:58.780 --> 35:00.260
where a virus goes into your lungs

35:00.260 --> 35:02.300
that makes copies of itself and then you cough it out.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.620
It's much more complicated than that.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.260
One of the very early clues that we had of this

35:07.260 --> 35:08.780
was when Robert Malone told us

35:08.780 --> 35:10.660
that the vast majority of viral particles

35:10.660 --> 35:14.620
are non-infectious, their replication incompetent.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.460
And so that's what's represented at the cartoon over here.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.860
I believe this is also the reason why a lot of the objections

35:20.860 --> 35:25.220
of the no virus camp are actually very much spot on

35:25.220 --> 35:28.060
and have a great relevance to our trying to understand

35:28.060 --> 35:30.220
the infectious cycle for real if there is one.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.820
And I'm open to the possibility that there isn't.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.700
So the first thing that I'd like you to imagine

35:34.700 --> 35:37.340
or think about is virus packaging

35:37.340 --> 35:39.060
and what that has to do with.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.980
This is a cartoon, a computer model of viral packaging.

35:41.980 --> 35:46.420
The idea is again, that little tiny red line there

35:46.420 --> 35:49.180
is the mRNA and it's supposed to be coiled

35:49.180 --> 35:52.500
around the end protein and then a bunch of end proteins

35:52.500 --> 35:56.540
brings that full genome of the virus into the endosome

35:56.540 --> 35:59.900
and the endosome has the spike protein on the inside of it.

35:59.900 --> 36:03.020
And so when it invaginates like that,

36:03.020 --> 36:05.380
then you get this vesicle forming on the inside

36:05.380 --> 36:08.620
of the endosome and that's supposed to be the free virus.

36:08.620 --> 36:11.420
Now the question becomes, how in the world

36:11.420 --> 36:12.940
is this all orchestrated?

36:12.940 --> 36:14.940
How does your cell just get told?

36:14.940 --> 36:17.540
Okay, take this and wrap this all around

36:17.540 --> 36:21.100
and put this in there and arrange this that way?

36:21.100 --> 36:25.100
The idea that the word hijack is sufficient

36:25.100 --> 36:28.700
to justify this cartoon as being fact

36:28.740 --> 36:31.620
is absolutely unacceptable.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.660
And that's again, part of the no virus people's objection

36:34.660 --> 36:36.620
that I think is really spot on.

36:36.620 --> 36:41.220
And in fact, there's almost everything that they say

36:41.220 --> 36:43.700
is true, it's just the things that they chose not to say

36:43.700 --> 36:45.300
for two or three years that frustrate me.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.380
But again, it could just be that I was an idiot

36:47.380 --> 36:48.900
and stuck with these people.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.100
This I want to, whoa, sorry about that,

36:52.100 --> 36:53.940
that's from my stream.

36:53.940 --> 36:58.300
So I would like to, oh, come on, end.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.020
I would like to just give you a brief introduction

37:01.020 --> 37:03.420
to RNA viruses to make sure that you understand

37:03.420 --> 37:04.260
where we are.

37:04.260 --> 37:07.060
This is influenza A and influenza A,

37:07.060 --> 37:08.620
if you can see my arrow is right here

37:08.620 --> 37:10.060
and it's binding with the cell,

37:10.060 --> 37:11.860
it's gonna go into the endosome

37:11.860 --> 37:14.540
and then it's gonna release into this thing

37:14.540 --> 37:19.460
a negative strand RNA and some proteins which can copy it.

37:19.460 --> 37:21.860
So the first thing to remember in case you're unaware

37:21.860 --> 37:23.940
of this is that flu and measles

37:23.940 --> 37:26.380
are negative strand RNA viruses

37:26.380 --> 37:29.340
that they can't be read by our ribosomes.

37:29.340 --> 37:33.500
So in order for an influenza virus to be a useful particle,

37:33.500 --> 37:36.620
it also needs to have all of the accessory proteins present

37:36.620 --> 37:38.420
so that that negative strand RNA

37:38.420 --> 37:40.260
when it's released into the cell

37:40.260 --> 37:43.940
will be reliably copied into a positive strand RNA

37:43.940 --> 37:48.380
which can be then translated into proteins by our ribosomes.

37:48.380 --> 37:52.020
Now, that's a pretty interesting scenario, right?

37:52.020 --> 37:57.020
Because then if we go back to this illusion here,

37:57.020 --> 38:00.180
then in a flu virus, when a flu virus is assembled,

38:00.180 --> 38:03.260
not only do you need to get a full genome in there

38:03.260 --> 38:04.460
or in the flu viruses case,

38:04.460 --> 38:07.380
actually you need to get about eight circular RNAs

38:07.380 --> 38:09.500
into the same virus,

38:09.500 --> 38:11.940
but you also need to get some of these proteins in there

38:11.940 --> 38:12.980
because if they're not in there,

38:12.980 --> 38:14.680
then this virus will be useless.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.300
So contrast that to the positive stranded RNA virus

38:20.300 --> 38:22.700
of coronavirus and you will see that actually

38:22.700 --> 38:27.540
the translation of the full genome occurs immediately

38:27.540 --> 38:29.100
and you produce N proteins

38:29.100 --> 38:33.220
and you produce this primary translating poly protein.

38:34.260 --> 38:39.140
And so these compound proteins, something, something,

38:39.140 --> 38:44.060
apparently can copy sub-genomic RNAs right away

38:44.060 --> 38:45.620
to genomic RNAs or sorry,

38:45.620 --> 38:48.300
genomic RNAs right away to genomic RNAs you see

38:48.300 --> 38:50.540
in this picture here, this is from like science magazine.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.940
So if you think that this is kind of a bad picture,

38:53.940 --> 38:57.100
I agree, but here you have just a little cartoon

38:57.100 --> 39:00.260
that seems to indicate that this amount of protein

39:00.260 --> 39:03.260
is capable of making copies of the single stranded

39:03.260 --> 39:06.500
genomic RNA, but it's also capable

39:06.500 --> 39:09.420
of making these single stranded genomic RNA,

39:09.420 --> 39:12.740
sub-genomic RNAs that are little tiny ones here.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.660
And they don't really explain much more about it.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.060
It's again, a lot of hand waving,

39:17.060 --> 39:19.020
but again, you can see the task.

39:19.020 --> 39:22.500
None of these RNAs are supposed to be packaged.

39:22.500 --> 39:27.500
Only the full genome should get packaged and shipped out.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.220
And yet when we've looked at the expression

39:30.220 --> 39:34.300
of these positive stranded genomes in cell cultures,

39:34.300 --> 39:37.620
we see that the preponderance of mRNA's

39:37.620 --> 39:40.500
that are produced are actually all these sub-genomic RNAs,

39:40.500 --> 39:43.300
like hundreds of thousands of times more

39:43.300 --> 39:45.340
than any full genomes that are made.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.700
And so this seems to kind of,

39:47.700 --> 39:50.420
to support the idea of what Robert Malone said,

39:50.420 --> 39:52.420
which is the vast majority of viral particles

39:52.420 --> 39:54.620
don't end up with a full genome inside of them

39:54.620 --> 39:56.900
because the full genome is very rarely copied

39:56.900 --> 40:00.260
with very rarely copied successfully.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.700
And then every time it is copied successfully,

40:02.700 --> 40:04.540
there are a number of errors in it

40:04.540 --> 40:07.740
because of the way that RNA is copied.

40:07.740 --> 40:11.220
Now, it is possible in the realm of possibility

40:11.220 --> 40:13.780
that this little area here in the cartoon

40:13.820 --> 40:16.060
will be found to be quite high fidelity

40:16.060 --> 40:18.860
and Jay's all wrong and he's an idiot and he can go home.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.380
But I really doubt that.

40:20.380 --> 40:22.860
And more importantly, there's no real,

40:22.860 --> 40:24.900
there's no real firm molecular evidence

40:24.900 --> 40:27.540
for the fidelity here at this step.

40:27.540 --> 40:30.740
They can say that it's here or it's there,

40:30.740 --> 40:33.740
but the bottom line is that it's not like

40:33.740 --> 40:36.500
copying double stranded DNA.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.940
And so you're already at lower fidelity with that.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.780
And so what is actually happening here is most likely

40:41.780 --> 40:44.540
that these RNAs, these viruses,

40:44.540 --> 40:46.980
are interacting with existing machinery

40:46.980 --> 40:49.700
that already packages things,

40:49.700 --> 40:52.860
that already puts RNA or DNA into a package

40:52.860 --> 40:55.500
and already has proteins on the outside

40:55.500 --> 40:57.260
because then it would make a lot more sense.

40:57.260 --> 40:59.980
In other words, it's kind of like a cuckoo clock.

40:59.980 --> 41:01.740
And if you hijack a cuckoo clock,

41:01.740 --> 41:03.820
you can't make toast.

41:03.820 --> 41:05.540
You can make it ring at the wrong time.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.340
You can make it make funny noises,

41:07.340 --> 41:08.740
but you can't make it make toast.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.820
And I don't think that a virus can go into a cell

41:10.820 --> 41:13.300
and make it do something that it already doesn't do.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.860
Cells already package exosomes and send signals

41:15.860 --> 41:16.700
to one another.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.900
And so I think that this is just hijacking of that signal.

41:19.900 --> 41:23.860
But what that means is that what we are doing

41:23.860 --> 41:25.300
is we are packaging RNA.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.620
And the vast majority of the RNA that we find in there

41:27.620 --> 41:31.300
is either low fidelity copy or even a impartial copy.

41:31.300 --> 41:34.100
And that's the problem with what they find

41:34.100 --> 41:35.580
when they look in these papers,

41:35.580 --> 41:37.500
what they find when they look in the wild.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.660
And so this is the analogy I've come up with.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.980
They are more like mixed tapes.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.460
And so you cannot grow them in the wild.

41:44.460 --> 41:47.220
A mixed tape is from the old days

41:47.220 --> 41:48.700
where if you bought this in the store,

41:48.700 --> 41:49.580
it would sound really good.

41:49.580 --> 41:51.060
But if you copied it for your friend,

41:51.060 --> 41:52.140
it would already have this hiss

41:52.140 --> 41:53.700
and it wouldn't sound very well.

41:53.700 --> 41:56.300
So you could make a mixed tape for your girlfriend

41:56.300 --> 41:59.580
and put all the songs that reminded you of her on one tape.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.260
And it would sound okay.

42:01.260 --> 42:04.060
But if you wanted to make a copy of that mixed tape,

42:04.060 --> 42:05.660
it would sound really awful.

42:05.660 --> 42:09.860
And this lacking a loss of fidelity upon each copy,

42:09.860 --> 42:12.780
there is a, there is a equivalent to that

42:12.780 --> 42:16.220
in the copying of RNA that is orders of magnitude

42:16.220 --> 42:17.540
more important than the copy,

42:17.540 --> 42:19.780
than in the copying of DNA.

42:19.780 --> 42:24.100
And that's why an analogy for RNA versus DNA,

42:24.100 --> 42:27.700
useful one might be an audio tape versus a CD.

42:27.700 --> 42:31.340
If you make a mixed CD and then you made a copy of that CD,

42:31.340 --> 42:33.380
it would be a pretty decent copy to listen to,

42:33.380 --> 42:35.940
but it's not the same with audio tape.

42:35.940 --> 42:39.620
And so I'm making the argument that like audio tape,

42:39.620 --> 42:42.540
an RNA signal found in the anus of a bat

42:42.540 --> 42:45.260
or found in the lung of a sick child

42:45.260 --> 42:47.420
is not a culturable signal

42:47.420 --> 42:50.580
that can be made infinite quantities of,

42:50.580 --> 42:52.140
you can't just grab it and go

42:52.140 --> 42:54.100
and then put some more in the culture

42:54.100 --> 42:55.300
and pull some more out.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.900
And that's always been a problem for them.

42:57.900 --> 42:59.260
And the way that they overcome it

42:59.260 --> 43:02.340
is a technique that is who's,

43:04.340 --> 43:06.940
the credit for inventing it has been given to Ralph Barrick

43:06.940 --> 43:09.660
by the narrative, by the TV, but in reality,

43:09.660 --> 43:12.620
these are just standard bench techniques

43:12.620 --> 43:15.140
for putting two pieces of DNA together.

43:15.140 --> 43:18.380
And in this case, the DNA that they're putting together,

43:18.380 --> 43:21.380
that they're ligating together is actually DNA

43:21.380 --> 43:23.940
that is the copy of a genome that they say

43:23.940 --> 43:25.060
they found in the wild.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.340
So they make this DNA copy,

43:27.380 --> 43:29.420
and I put a little CD here to indicate

43:29.420 --> 43:31.660
that this is a high fidelity copy.

43:31.660 --> 43:34.620
And because a coronavirus genome is so long,

43:34.620 --> 43:37.900
they need to divide it in a few plasmids.

43:37.900 --> 43:40.180
And so that's where the ligation comes in.

43:40.180 --> 43:45.180
You have five pieces that you can grow in a bacterial culture

43:45.340 --> 43:47.900
and then those five pieces need to be ligated together

43:47.900 --> 43:49.300
into one genome.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.860
And that ligation step requires a sort of puzzle piece

43:52.860 --> 43:56.700
to be cut in both ends of those plasmids.

43:56.700 --> 43:59.140
And then that puzzle piece cut is actually done

43:59.140 --> 44:01.020
by a specific enzyme.

44:01.020 --> 44:04.380
And so with very clever choices of codons,

44:04.380 --> 44:07.020
you can actually make an assembly kit

44:07.020 --> 44:10.660
for coronavirus genomes that you can kind of insert pieces

44:10.660 --> 44:14.980
into and this methodology has been blamed for,

44:14.980 --> 44:19.300
again, that sewing icon that I put on the worst case scenario.

44:19.300 --> 44:22.420
It is the stitching of things together

44:22.420 --> 44:24.540
and using this technique to do it

44:24.540 --> 44:28.540
that then leads to a huge quantity of DNA.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.540
And this is the part where Kevin McCurnan

44:30.540 --> 44:35.140
seems to want to try and obfuscate the idea of clones.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.180
The problem is with clones is that

44:37.180 --> 44:40.140
when you make this DNA in a bacterial culture,

44:40.140 --> 44:42.620
you can make as much as you want.

44:42.620 --> 44:44.860
And so when you convert it to RNA,

44:44.860 --> 44:48.940
there's only one step from converting it to DNA and RNA.

44:48.940 --> 44:51.740
So there's a limited amount of errors that will be made.

44:51.740 --> 44:56.100
And since you're moving from a pure template of DNA

44:56.100 --> 44:58.620
to a limited amount of errors of RNA,

44:58.620 --> 45:02.580
you will produce a purity of this full genome

45:02.580 --> 45:05.420
that doesn't exist when you sample these from nature.

45:05.420 --> 45:07.700
Because when you sample them from nature,

45:07.700 --> 45:10.780
the mRNA makes a bunch of subgenomic RNAs

45:10.780 --> 45:12.780
that overwhelm the RNA signal

45:12.780 --> 45:16.420
and the full genome is almost undetectable.

45:16.420 --> 45:18.460
And this gets overcome if you do it this way

45:18.460 --> 45:21.580
because you have a DNA copy of the full genome

45:21.580 --> 45:23.140
that you convert to RNA.

45:23.140 --> 45:26.540
So there's no subgenomic RNA produced.

45:26.540 --> 45:29.140
You're not even using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

45:29.140 --> 45:30.620
You're using an RNA polymerase

45:30.620 --> 45:33.300
that has been commercially optimized.

45:33.300 --> 45:34.940
And what this allows you to do

45:34.940 --> 45:38.020
is produce cell cultures that are replicable

45:38.020 --> 45:40.620
and everybody can use your DNA.

45:40.620 --> 45:44.060
You can just make more of it from the DNA that you made.

45:44.060 --> 45:46.620
You can make more DNA if you want.

45:46.620 --> 45:50.020
You can also make replicable animal models

45:50.020 --> 45:52.260
of these infections and you can also share it with people.

45:52.260 --> 45:55.980
The worst part about this is just like the mRNA shot,

45:55.980 --> 45:59.820
you can produce industrial quantities of this.

45:59.820 --> 46:01.740
It doesn't have to be small batch brewing.

46:01.740 --> 46:05.620
You can do a giant batch of this CDNA

46:05.620 --> 46:07.380
and then convert it all to RNA

46:07.380 --> 46:10.900
and you will have a large quantity of infectious RNA

46:10.900 --> 46:15.060
that could have never, ever, ever, ever been generated

46:15.060 --> 46:17.380
in any other way because of the nature

46:17.380 --> 46:19.460
of RNA copying and fidelity.

46:20.500 --> 46:25.140
And so they have indeed used this for all RNA papers forever.

46:25.140 --> 46:26.300
This is what they do now.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.340
They find a signal, they make a clone,

46:28.340 --> 46:31.780
and now if you want to use my clone, I can send it to you.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.620
This is an example of a paper that was done in 2019

46:34.620 --> 46:36.620
right before the pandemic where they use

46:36.620 --> 46:39.940
human coronavirus 229E and they make a clone of it.

46:41.380 --> 46:44.220
They take this clone and they put it into a cell culture

46:44.220 --> 46:46.540
and they look for these subgenomic RNAs

46:46.540 --> 46:48.860
to be transcribed and they're trying to look for

46:48.860 --> 46:51.740
the relative ratio that they're produced in.

46:53.340 --> 46:54.780
And so I'm gonna skip this slide.

46:54.780 --> 46:59.780
When they find the, this is kind of a hard graph to read

47:00.100 --> 47:04.340
but what you're looking for are these signals here

47:04.340 --> 47:07.780
and what level they are relative to the x-axis,

47:07.780 --> 47:09.500
sorry, the y-axis, hello.

47:10.420 --> 47:14.100
And so as you go up in the y-axis,

47:14.100 --> 47:15.940
you go up in abundance

47:15.980 --> 47:18.660
and the coverage here, so what you're covering

47:18.660 --> 47:20.940
is the full genome which is listed on the bottom.

47:20.940 --> 47:25.940
So this ORF1A and ORF1B are where all these magic proteins

47:26.220 --> 47:28.340
are which are able to copy the viral genome

47:28.340 --> 47:31.100
but also make the subgenomic RNAs that are necessary

47:31.100 --> 47:35.460
for viral replication and assembly according to virologists.

47:35.460 --> 47:39.180
The interesting thing is is when copying begins

47:39.180 --> 47:43.740
using this clone, the vast majority of subgenomic RNAs

47:43.780 --> 47:47.100
that are present are the M protein, the M protein,

47:47.100 --> 47:49.700
the E protein, a protein called number four

47:49.700 --> 47:51.780
and the S protein.

47:51.780 --> 47:55.900
And in fact, when you look for full length RNAs,

47:56.780 --> 47:58.380
they only found two.

47:59.820 --> 48:03.780
So while there were somewhere between five and 8,000 copies

48:03.780 --> 48:06.100
of the N protein in some of these transcripts,

48:06.100 --> 48:08.020
a lot of these are high numbers

48:08.020 --> 48:09.100
and they're different lengths

48:09.100 --> 48:11.420
and different variations of that fragment,

48:11.460 --> 48:14.300
there were only two fragments that could qualify

48:14.300 --> 48:15.900
as anywhere near full length.

48:15.900 --> 48:19.580
Now we could have missed some, except the problem is

48:19.580 --> 48:22.220
is that we've seen this same signal even in the old days

48:22.220 --> 48:23.700
when we were doing it in old ways,

48:23.700 --> 48:28.220
when we were still really just being able to look at mRNA

48:28.220 --> 48:31.060
and looking at whole fractions in gel pull downs,

48:31.060 --> 48:35.500
they still saw the full genome is almost invisible,

48:35.500 --> 48:37.060
it's almost impossible to find

48:37.060 --> 48:39.820
and so this is a very consistent signal

48:39.860 --> 48:41.580
and it's probably not the limitations

48:41.580 --> 48:43.820
of nanopore sequencing in that latest paper

48:43.820 --> 48:45.340
because this signals the same.

48:46.780 --> 48:49.260
When a coronavirus RNA replicates,

48:49.260 --> 48:51.500
it very rarely makes a full copy of itself.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.540
So how in the world are these things spreading

48:53.540 --> 48:55.260
from person to person?

48:55.260 --> 48:57.900
It definitely isn't the way that the cartoon describes it.

48:57.900 --> 49:00.220
That's the reason why this story doesn't make sense

49:00.220 --> 49:01.820
and it's really hard to culture.

49:01.820 --> 49:04.180
Well, if the virus was making perfect copies of itself,

49:04.180 --> 49:06.660
it would be easy to culture, but it's not.

49:06.660 --> 49:08.900
It's making very poor copies of itself.

49:08.940 --> 49:11.860
Many of the copies are non-replication competent.

49:11.860 --> 49:15.740
That makes it difficult to culture coronaviruses from the wild.

49:15.740 --> 49:17.580
The solution that they've come up with

49:17.580 --> 49:21.100
is to take that RNA sequence that they find in the wild,

49:21.100 --> 49:23.860
turn it into cDNA constructs that can be grown

49:23.860 --> 49:26.580
in high quantities in a bacterial culture.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.780
They can then use any number of ways

49:28.780 --> 49:31.660
to convert that cDNA to RNA.

49:31.660 --> 49:32.860
You don't have to get into that now

49:32.860 --> 49:35.260
and in fact because we're gonna talk with somebody

49:35.260 --> 49:37.260
like Kevin McCurnan, it would be really silly for me

49:37.260 --> 49:39.980
to try and wax intellectual about all the details of that.

49:39.980 --> 49:42.540
But the point is, is that when they do this,

49:42.540 --> 49:47.300
they are able to create a purity level of a single copy,

49:47.300 --> 49:51.540
many, many copies of a pure RNA that can't exist in nature

49:51.540 --> 49:54.260
because of the nature of replicating RNA.

49:54.260 --> 49:57.380
Now, the trick is, is that up until now,

49:57.380 --> 50:01.940
no one has really tried to measure the infectious ratio

50:01.940 --> 50:04.580
of a coronavirus swarm in an animal or in nature

50:04.580 --> 50:05.580
or anywhere else.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.940
But my guess is it's a lot different than one to one

50:07.940 --> 50:10.260
or 10 to one or even 50 to one.

50:10.260 --> 50:13.660
The point is, is that if you make an RNA copy,

50:13.660 --> 50:16.180
or sorry, a DNA master copy,

50:16.180 --> 50:18.460
you can make lots of copies of the same RNA

50:18.460 --> 50:20.780
and you will have averted this problem

50:20.780 --> 50:23.660
that makes it so difficult to culture coronaviruses

50:23.660 --> 50:24.700
from the wild.

50:24.700 --> 50:25.540
So I'm gonna-

50:25.540 --> 50:27.980
JJ, are you suggesting that they're making,

50:28.980 --> 50:30.820
so you know, if you put that infectious clone

50:30.820 --> 50:31.820
into a mammalian cell,

50:31.820 --> 50:33.980
you're gonna get a very similar output

50:33.980 --> 50:36.820
to what SARS does, right?

50:36.820 --> 50:40.020
The replicated machinery is gonna make this really odd array

50:40.020 --> 50:42.820
of different expression from the N gene, the M gene

50:43.940 --> 50:44.700
because it has to, right?

50:44.700 --> 50:46.780
If you wanna actually stoichiometrically put

50:46.780 --> 50:50.700
one genomic piece of DNA or RNA into a capsid,

50:50.700 --> 50:52.940
you have to make like a hundred to a thousand spikes,

50:52.940 --> 50:54.700
a hundred to a thousand, you know,

50:54.700 --> 50:56.100
N proteins, envelope proteins.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.980
So they're gonna express a lot more of that junk

50:57.980 --> 50:59.260
at the end of the molecule,

50:59.260 --> 51:01.180
just to make that assemble correctly.

51:01.180 --> 51:04.180
Are you suggesting that to do an infectious clone release,

51:04.180 --> 51:06.500
you'd have to like take the clones,

51:06.500 --> 51:08.820
grow them in a coli, like they're doing through the vaccines

51:08.820 --> 51:13.580
and then purify them and then make a lot of T7 like RNA off of it

51:13.580 --> 51:16.580
and then infect people with the RNA somehow?

51:16.580 --> 51:18.300
Because in that case, it would be linear,

51:18.300 --> 51:19.580
it'd all be one molecule,

51:19.580 --> 51:20.780
it wouldn't be all diced up

51:20.780 --> 51:23.900
and having this different type of expression profile

51:23.900 --> 51:25.500
that we see in nature.

51:25.500 --> 51:29.260
Right, so that's kind of my point is that if you did that,

51:29.260 --> 51:32.540
you would have an infectious clone would be

51:32.540 --> 51:36.380
and not an accurate representation of what SARS does

51:36.380 --> 51:38.300
when it's on its own.

51:38.300 --> 51:40.780
So the question becomes, ladies and gentlemen,

51:40.780 --> 51:43.260
what in the world is this all about?

51:44.300 --> 51:48.220
Why in the world all of a sudden in January of 2024,

51:48.220 --> 51:50.420
do I, after being blocked for a year

51:50.420 --> 51:52.220
and just kind of ignoring him,

51:52.220 --> 51:54.460
do I still get this kind of vitriol

51:54.460 --> 51:57.900
when we discussed it live over,

51:57.900 --> 52:00.300
that was in March of 2000 of last year,

52:00.300 --> 52:01.500
when we discussed it live,

52:01.500 --> 52:03.820
he didn't have, this went on.

52:03.820 --> 52:05.860
There was 15 more minutes of that discussion

52:05.860 --> 52:08.020
where we discussed all of these principles

52:08.020 --> 52:10.380
and he didn't think it was crazy.

52:10.380 --> 52:12.620
And yet now, yes, sir.

52:12.620 --> 52:14.460
Well, was that,

52:14.460 --> 52:16.540
we have had Kevin McGurnan on as a guest,

52:16.540 --> 52:18.980
but I can't remember what he looks like.

52:18.980 --> 52:19.940
Was that him then?

52:19.940 --> 52:21.740
That was him then, absolutely.

52:21.740 --> 52:22.580
Right.

52:22.580 --> 52:25.020
And so here he is calling me

52:25.020 --> 52:27.740
Keystone Cop clone chemtrail hypothesis

52:27.780 --> 52:30.300
when we've discussed it many times

52:30.300 --> 52:32.180
and he didn't call it this.

52:32.180 --> 52:33.020
And so I think-

52:33.020 --> 52:34.300
Well, he seemed a little bit exercised there,

52:34.300 --> 52:36.980
I think, when he was challenging you.

52:36.980 --> 52:37.820
That's okay.

52:37.820 --> 52:39.140
I don't have any problem with that.

52:39.140 --> 52:42.660
Oh, no, I know, you know, yes, okay.

52:42.660 --> 52:43.500
I was just calling it.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.380
So the first thing that he says is that

52:45.380 --> 52:47.260
in this comment is that

52:47.260 --> 52:49.980
coronavirus has circled the globe every year.

52:49.980 --> 52:52.020
He also says that they hyper optimized

52:52.020 --> 52:53.660
the receptor binding domain

52:53.660 --> 52:55.620
and that equals fast spread.

52:55.620 --> 52:57.140
Now that wasn't the way it was.

52:57.140 --> 52:59.420
It was actually, and we turned this off,

52:59.420 --> 53:01.300
it was actually the fear and cleavage site

53:01.300 --> 53:03.580
that was blamed for that for quite some time.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.140
Then we have this,

53:07.660 --> 53:08.500
then we have,

53:08.500 --> 53:10.580
it could not spread as fast as what he said.

53:10.580 --> 53:12.940
And so it has to be already endemic,

53:12.940 --> 53:16.300
but I've been explaining that to him

53:16.300 --> 53:18.060
that this is a background

53:18.060 --> 53:19.900
and that if there is a background

53:19.900 --> 53:21.620
that's being confounded by the PCR,

53:21.620 --> 53:22.540
then we would,

53:22.540 --> 53:23.820
we were just being misled.

53:23.820 --> 53:26.100
He is purposefully ignoring that

53:26.100 --> 53:28.740
for more than two years.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.180
And what?

53:31.180 --> 53:32.020
Kevin, why?

53:32.020 --> 53:33.100
Just let me go forward.

53:33.100 --> 53:33.940
Let me go forward.

53:33.940 --> 53:34.980
Ask it at the end.

53:34.980 --> 53:37.500
Seating clone hypothesis is chemtrail retarded

53:37.500 --> 53:39.220
is not a scientific discussion here.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.340
This is a multi-millionaire

53:42.340 --> 53:44.860
wasting his time on his own sub stack,

53:44.860 --> 53:48.020
trying to trash somebody who has 3,000 followers

53:48.020 --> 53:50.620
and was just laid off from CHD.

53:51.620 --> 53:55.180
Like why does he even need to waste his time doing this

53:55.180 --> 53:57.180
unless there is a reason?

53:57.180 --> 53:58.180
And the reason is,

53:58.180 --> 54:01.980
is because this idea is the right answer.

54:01.980 --> 54:04.460
You infect a few people with a clone

54:04.460 --> 54:06.220
so that you get the same sequence

54:06.220 --> 54:08.180
in any place that you look for it.

54:08.180 --> 54:11.420
And if it lasts for a little while or a few days,

54:11.420 --> 54:12.260
it doesn't matter.

54:12.260 --> 54:13.660
I don't know how long it will last.

54:13.660 --> 54:15.940
I don't know how much quantity they would use.

54:15.940 --> 54:17.140
I don't care.

54:17.140 --> 54:17.980
The point is,

54:17.980 --> 54:20.140
is that this biology is real.

54:20.140 --> 54:22.060
The papers are hundreds

54:22.060 --> 54:26.580
to argue about whether or not RNA replicates at this,

54:26.580 --> 54:28.420
at this fidelity or that fidelity

54:28.420 --> 54:30.060
doesn't change the fact that,

54:30.060 --> 54:32.700
that these clones are used

54:32.700 --> 54:36.580
to make coronavirus biology replicable

54:36.580 --> 54:39.380
in each, in each experiment.

54:39.380 --> 54:40.580
If you don't do that,

54:40.580 --> 54:42.780
then the moment you do an experiment with a coronavirus,

54:42.780 --> 54:45.460
you can't replicate it because it's gone.

54:45.460 --> 54:47.380
And so this Keystone COP,

54:47.380 --> 54:51.100
chemtrail hypothesis insult is actually an admission

54:51.100 --> 54:52.780
that this is actually real.

54:52.780 --> 54:55.900
There's no other way that this guy with a cannabis company

54:55.900 --> 54:59.100
is gonna be touring the world talking about these shots.

55:01.180 --> 55:02.940
And so leaking the viruses better,

55:02.940 --> 55:05.180
he's actually arguing that real viruses

55:05.180 --> 55:08.780
have attributes that clones don't.

55:10.620 --> 55:12.260
And the most important thing

55:12.260 --> 55:14.580
and to understand is that in all of his time,

55:14.580 --> 55:15.940
in all of his podcasts,

55:15.940 --> 55:17.980
in all of the microphones he's ever had,

55:17.980 --> 55:20.940
he's never once pointed out that on top of all this,

55:20.940 --> 55:23.940
they were really exaggerating the danger of whatever it was.

55:23.940 --> 55:25.780
And that the protocols in America

55:25.780 --> 55:28.420
probably caused mass casualty events

55:28.420 --> 55:30.380
that were misconstrued as spread.

55:30.380 --> 55:34.180
And so the defense of there are viruses.

55:34.180 --> 55:38.260
The defense of the relative replication competence

55:38.260 --> 55:40.340
of viruses is irrelevant.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.300
If you don't actually acknowledge

55:42.300 --> 55:47.300
that there's this giant body of misleading media coverage

55:47.500 --> 55:49.420
that went on for years.

55:49.420 --> 55:51.820
And these people ignore all of it

55:51.820 --> 55:53.980
and make us focus on clones

55:53.980 --> 55:56.060
and talk about whether or not I'm right

55:56.060 --> 55:59.060
or a little off on the replication competence

55:59.060 --> 56:01.940
of a particular gene in the coronavirus genome,

56:01.940 --> 56:04.260
it's absolutely absurd.

56:04.260 --> 56:05.260
And you can see it here

56:05.260 --> 56:08.620
because in that same video from March of last year,

56:10.020 --> 56:12.740
Jessica Rose says that it's the best idea she's ever heard

56:12.740 --> 56:14.140
and it explains almost everything.

56:14.140 --> 56:17.220
Here is the the sub-stack that she wrote after that article

56:17.220 --> 56:18.060
that says, by the way,

56:18.060 --> 56:19.660
massive thank you to Jonathan Cooley,

56:19.660 --> 56:21.220
Matthew Crawford, John Bodwin

56:21.220 --> 56:24.580
and Mark Giroudot for the Thursday night chats.

56:24.580 --> 56:26.020
You know who Mark Giroudot is?

56:26.020 --> 56:28.140
He's the guy who claims that it's a bolus effect.

56:28.140 --> 56:29.580
And if you just hit a vein

56:29.580 --> 56:31.660
that that's where autism comes from.

56:31.660 --> 56:33.540
You know who Matthew Crawford is.

56:33.540 --> 56:34.740
You know who John Bodwin is.

56:34.740 --> 56:37.340
You know who Jessica Rose is.

56:37.340 --> 56:42.100
This is a description of the Steve Kirsch steering committee

56:42.100 --> 56:43.900
that used to meet on every Thursday night

56:43.900 --> 56:45.940
where I would explain this stuff to these people

56:45.940 --> 56:47.900
that now ignore it.

56:47.900 --> 56:50.700
The only person who covers this idea is Matthew Crawford.

56:51.820 --> 56:54.900
Mark Giroudot insists that it's still just injection

56:54.900 --> 56:56.500
and missing the vein.

56:56.500 --> 56:59.220
John Bodwin is talking about what he needs to talk about

56:59.220 --> 57:00.980
and he's, every time he says

57:00.980 --> 57:03.580
that the protocols were murder, somebody cuts him off.

57:05.660 --> 57:08.700
We need to wake up to the idea that we have been lied to

57:08.700 --> 57:11.220
and that there are people who are actively lying to us.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.300
They are obfuscating the truth about this

57:14.300 --> 57:16.340
and they even go so far as to say

57:16.340 --> 57:18.100
that the viral swarm isn't real.

57:19.140 --> 57:20.740
Even though they have to admit

57:20.740 --> 57:22.700
that RNA cannot be copied perfectly,

57:22.700 --> 57:24.700
if it can't be copied perfectly, the swarm is real.

57:24.700 --> 57:25.540
Done.

57:27.860 --> 57:30.580
And so they have, there's an orchestrated campaign

57:30.580 --> 57:32.380
to make this diffuse proposal real

57:32.380 --> 57:34.700
so that this fear and cleavage site becomes real again

57:34.700 --> 57:36.620
and so that this cover-up becomes real again.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.460
And so you think that we think that our families think

57:39.460 --> 57:41.340
that we need to teach our kids

57:41.340 --> 57:43.100
that this was a solved mystery

57:43.100 --> 57:45.780
and that Fauci and EcoHealth Alliance are guilty of this.

57:45.780 --> 57:49.260
We need to return RNA to real again.

57:49.260 --> 57:53.500
We need to return the biology of RNA and clones real again.

57:54.820 --> 57:56.020
That's what we need to do.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.660
And now I'm gonna use this analogy

57:58.660 --> 58:00.020
and then I'm gonna wrap up

58:00.020 --> 58:02.940
but look very carefully at this guy, this Italian guy

58:02.940 --> 58:05.140
pretending to stop this subway.

58:06.540 --> 58:10.540
And so he gets on and he pulls it to a stop

58:10.540 --> 58:11.460
and then he's gonna go over here

58:11.460 --> 58:13.420
and he's gonna chalk up his hands

58:13.420 --> 58:15.860
and he's gonna pretend that he's doing this.

58:15.860 --> 58:17.420
Now what I want you to understand

58:17.420 --> 58:19.140
is that the more people

58:19.140 --> 58:21.100
and please do this thought experiment

58:21.100 --> 58:23.100
if you haven't already, the more people

58:23.100 --> 58:25.020
that he recruited to do this act,

58:25.020 --> 58:26.860
the more convincing it would be,

58:26.860 --> 58:28.900
especially if you were a young person

58:28.900 --> 58:31.820
or you didn't know anything about electric trains

58:31.820 --> 58:33.820
and the bigger the people were,

58:33.820 --> 58:35.740
the more animated they were,

58:35.740 --> 58:39.380
the more lights and sparks that they had

58:39.380 --> 58:43.020
in their uniform or more tools that they used

58:43.020 --> 58:44.700
and more noises that you heard

58:44.700 --> 58:46.660
as the train stopped or the train went away,

58:46.660 --> 58:48.140
the more convincing it would become

58:48.140 --> 58:51.740
that these people were stopping and starting the train.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.500
And I want you to think about the pandemic

58:53.500 --> 58:54.500
as something like this,

58:54.500 --> 58:57.420
that if enough people were to act like

58:57.420 --> 58:59.540
there's a pandemic to agree,

58:59.540 --> 59:02.780
to fight about what the pandemic is

59:02.780 --> 59:04.460
that you would be bamboozled by.

59:04.460 --> 59:07.220
You would think, wow, look at all these, it must be.

59:07.220 --> 59:09.540
And if you were one who really wanted to participate,

59:09.540 --> 59:11.380
you might've been being invited to hear.

59:11.460 --> 59:13.420
Here's the tug of war, pull on the rope.

59:14.740 --> 59:16.740
You can help us by pulling on the rope.

59:16.740 --> 59:18.420
And so you get your position on the rope.

59:18.420 --> 59:21.420
Gaijai, Gaijai, Jim's raised his hand with a question.

59:21.420 --> 59:22.260
Oh, it's okay, good.

59:22.260 --> 59:23.100
I'll stop right here.

59:23.100 --> 59:23.940
Go ahead, Jim.

59:23.940 --> 59:26.620
Well, actually, JJ, it was very interesting

59:26.620 --> 59:27.460
what you were just saying,

59:27.460 --> 59:29.620
then you're interrupted on a peace sentence.

59:29.620 --> 59:30.460
What was that?

59:33.220 --> 59:37.300
Well, I don't know, just that all of these people now,

59:37.300 --> 59:40.780
if you think about how this little cartoon goes,

59:40.820 --> 59:43.020
the more people that you have standing along the train,

59:43.020 --> 59:46.220
the more convincing this illusion is,

59:46.220 --> 59:49.300
and so that people are doing something that matters.

59:49.300 --> 59:51.700
And in the start of the pandemic,

59:51.700 --> 59:53.060
do you want to ask your question now, Jim?

59:53.060 --> 59:53.900
Go ahead.

59:56.820 --> 59:58.300
Actually, I didn't mean to interrupt.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.860
I just wanted you to address the,

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.860
if you could, the different types of spike pro teams

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.780
that are being alleged by a guy named,

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:14.780
Jason McClellan, who supposedly invented the vaccine.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.540
I can comment on that a little bit.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.740
Are you aware of that guy?

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.340
I'm not aware of that guy, but I think-

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.300
And I don't want to interrupt you.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.540
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.380
I just wanted to get in line early.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.380
You're gonna have a lot of questions.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.220
This is great talk.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.580
Okay, great.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.740
So the point would be then to get back to this

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.060
is that the more people you had standing on the train

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.620
that agreed to talk about one thing,

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.980
and that not question the pandemic,

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.740
but just talk about one aspect of it,

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.620
like a novel treatment,

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.780
or whether we can build immunity or not,

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.460
or whether T cells are involved,

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.140
or it's all B cells, or is it a natural killer cells?

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.620
Did the lockdowns work or not?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.820
I mean, are we seeing evidence of masking working in Asia

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.660
or not?

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.500
These debates were all real,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.580
and they were all televised,

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.380
and they were all designed to make sure

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.820
that you didn't question the primary thing

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.660
that was happening,

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.700
which is that these mass casualty events equal spread,

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.220
that these PCR tests equal spread.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.420
And so all of this stuff was scripted.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.860
It was, it was gamed.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.540
It was tabletop exercised for many years.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.140
They knew that they were getting closer and closer

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.180
to getting it right.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.420
And so I would argue that there are a couple things

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.620
that we can know for sure.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.580
I, Droxylchloroquine and Ivermectin,

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.740
are underutilized, pretty useful drugs.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.140
Chances are very good,

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.660
that in a place like America using processed food

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.260
and eating as bad and exercising as little as they do,

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.700
that something like hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.980
when applied to somebody with some immune problem,

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.100
some sickness, that it might have some general effect,

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.620
even if it's not directly related

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.380
to whatever that they were experiencing.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.180
The point being that these are underutilized pharmaceuticals

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.340
that have no real danger if they're used properly,

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.900
and even their overdosing is probably not that dangerous.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.420
So you have this issue here that if you accept this,

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.140
again, this is the mystery,

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.660
a novel virus needs novel cures.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.500
What did they choose?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.660
They choose novel cures that you could argue about

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.620
without any problem.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.260
And then they also conveniently did really badly design

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.580
studies that people could argue about.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.020
People like Brett could argue about.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.700
People like Pierre Corey could write a whole book about.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:29.700
I would argue that the double stranded DNA is another opportunity

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.020
to make fake helpers join in the vigorous discussion

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.660
that will never question the necessity

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.100
of the transfection in the first place.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.340
Nor will they question the general application

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.500
of transfection as a vaccination methodology

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.460
because they will say, like Buckholtz did,

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.300
that if this DNA is in the shot,

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.300
I would still give it to my parents,

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.180
but I wouldn't give it to my daughter.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.660
He actually said that in front of the South Carolina Senate,

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.740
this guy who claims that he was whistleblowing

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.860
on the DNA contamination and confirmed

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.220
that Kevin McCurnan's measurements were right.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.260
This is a guy who was also very involved in the testing

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.020
for coronavirus for the first two years.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.620
It's not for nothing that he was chosen to be the guy

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.500
who again stepped to the side of the train

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.940
and pretend to help stop it.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.740
They praised the methodology and they blamed the rush.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.460
And so the last thing that is is this diffuse proposal

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.580
and it's contents and whether or not it's real

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.060
and whether or not the contents mean that they were already done.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.300
Whether these released emails indicate

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.100
that the experiments were obviously already done.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.140
And just like other aspects of the narrative,

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.900
if you accept this relevance or even argue about it,

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.300
you are not arguing about whether RNA can go

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.100
around the planet and change colors.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.540
And they have done this with lots of things,

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.780
including meetings all around the world

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.100
where people are invited and considered celebrities

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.460
and get to go on stage and present their results.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.420
And then somehow or another, their results

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.540
or their objections never quite come

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.340
out of the meeting like they should.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.340
And so in this scenario, I just want you to imagine

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.500
where Jessica Rose is a good guy

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.340
and Byron Brittle is a good guy

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.060
and Denny Rancor is a good guy

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:20.940
and Nick Hudson's a good guy and Ryan Cole's a good guy

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.300
and they're all these people on the stage

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.700
are pulling on this tug of war.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.620
But actually when it comes right down to it,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.500
maybe some of these people in yellow aren't actually pulling.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.580
Maybe they're not actually going to leave this meeting

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.660
and tell everybody everything they heard,

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.380
they're just going to tell everybody some things

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.220
that they heard.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.780
And that's how they did this throughout the entire pandemic

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.340
by calling me, by putting me in signal chats

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.940
and having me give them tutorials on my immunology ideas

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.580
and then not putting them on their podcast,

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.060
not telling anybody who they were learning this from,

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.060
correcting themselves, but not giving credit.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.340
They did this to everyone.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.020
They're doing it to Denny Rancor right now.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.500
They're doing it to Nick Hudson right now.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.500
Nick Hudson was at this discussion talk conference

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.940
in Romania and Budapest and nobody ever said

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.140
that his talk was great and I'm sure it was.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.180
And nobody's ever said that Denny Rancor was there

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.020
and that he showed there was no evidence of spread.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.300
They just show that he shows that 17 million people

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.220
were killed by the shot because that's okay to talk about.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.740
But the fact that mass casualty events

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.700
don't have spread away from them is not okay.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.340
So they don't talk about it.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.020
But Denny presented that data.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.740
And that's how this is done, ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.100
they are controlling a narrative about this potential

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:45.220
and any other parts of this narrative are just discarded.

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.980
And they keep bringing you back to this faith

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.860
and keep making it about this phase

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.140
without making it about there being no evidence of spread,

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.740
not making it about the projected Medicare costs

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.940
that were saved in America and around the world,

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.260
especially in America and not making it

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.740
about strict liability.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.020
In America, in our law,

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.940
with the way that we speak about what happens

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.380
with regular pharmaceuticals, it's strict liability.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.060
You're responsible for the damage

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.060
that's done with your product.

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.100
And we don't apply that to vaccines.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.900
We could just change that, but nobody talks about it.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.540
We have this separate system called CICP and VICP,

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.620
which are two kangaroo courts

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.740
where all of the claims against vaccine manufacturers

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.060
are brought and the US government pays all of those damages.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.620
They even pay for lawyers that bring losing cases.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.540
And in our constitution, it says in the Seventh Amendment

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.980
that we have the right to sue for damages over $20.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.700
So that seems to kind of contradict

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.540
because we're not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.820
We have to use a kangaroo court.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.260
It seems that that's a pretty obvious violation

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.260
of our Seventh Amendment.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.900
I know they have it.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.820
But what?

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.260
You got to mute yourself.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.820
It seems like a regular, that's a violation

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.700
of the Seventh Amendment, but nobody ever talks about that.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.780
None of the lawyers that have been in front of this

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.420
in this group have ever said to you

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.300
that one of the ways that we could win

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:13.220
is that we could take a single vaccine injury to court

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.140
in a state and have the state court say,

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:19.220
no, we can't see your claim because of the prep act.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.420
And then you could take that as an appeal to a federal court

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.900
and have the federal court strike the prep act

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.060
as unconstitutional.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.180
We could be done in months, but nobody's doing that.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.940
And that should tell you all you need to know.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.060
With all of this biology that I have to teach,

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.300
I got laid off.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:43.660
And not from a university this time.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.740
And so I think the most important thing to understand

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.980
is this teamwork case scenario is real.

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.660
Some of them were co-opted, some of them were forced,

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.700
some of them were coerced, some of them did it gladly.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.900
Some of them were in place before the pandemic

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.780
and found themselves between a rock and a hard place

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.660
as part of this control mechanism in the media.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.540
And then, wow, do I really have to go along with this?

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.940
Yes, you do.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.060
And we are victims of this.

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.820
Our children are victims of this

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.540
because they are being misled to believe

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.180
that something real happened that could happen again

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.180
and that, thank goodness,

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.420
transfection worked pretty well for grandma.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.260
And it all started with this illusion here.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.460
Spike protein and antibodies and the antibodies

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.340
from infection being very much weak

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.340
compared to the vaccine antibodies.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.660
This is a picture that's taken

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:38.260
from Francis Collins' own blog in July of 2020.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.580
This is the illusion in a nutshell.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.860
This is the lie in a nutshell.

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.860
The variants go on into the future

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.660
and your infection antibodies are useless.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.260
And depending on who you got in the car with,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.420
you would have heard all this.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.300
You would have heard arguments about all this.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.820
If you were lucky enough to get in the car

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.380
with Thomas Binder, well, good.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.300
But then you would have had to survive four years

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.900
with people telling you that Thomas Binder was crazy.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.340
And that's the new world order that they want to teach our kids.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.660
That's the new world order they want us to teach our kids.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.380
And our teachers are doing it.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.980
Our college professors are doing it.

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.060
The college administrators are doing it.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.580
Soon this lie, like in the book 1984,

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.220
is gonna be forgotten to become truth.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.860
And so it's up to us to teach our kids the way out of this.

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.260
It's up to us to teach our kids

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.020
that they have been fooled by this,

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.740
that these changes are real.

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.020
That they are being transitioned to submit

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.100
to a digital ID and digital currency.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.500
The digital ID is not a big deal

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.620
because if you have a phone, you already have it.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.460
You're being tracked and monitored in ways

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.260
that a digital ID won't even do.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.220
It's the digital currency you need to be afraid of,

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.940
of course, but I'm not an expert in this stuff.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.420
I just know that they're probably right.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.220
People like Michael Eden are probably right.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.540
This is the next stage.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.780
And they want you to believe that one of their excuses

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.460
for this, one of the excuses for this level of control

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:04.260
is the ongoing threat of gain of function viruses.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.020
This is most important to understand.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.460
We cannot let our children get on this train

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.540
where we believe that we've defeated all diseases

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.860
in the past by vaccination,

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.100
that we believe that novel coronaviruses can jump.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.700
We want them to believe that asymptomatic is spread

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.220
is what they need to think about.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.300
They're already telling people in America

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.580
that RSV is asymptomatic

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.340
and that they need to be concerned

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.380
about all of these respiratory viruses

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.540
as being asymptomatic.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:31.700
This is a train that our kids are currently on

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.860
and we have very little time to get them off of it

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.180
before they have their own kids and teach them

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.420
that this is the reality.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.300
And so we need to get them off this train.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.380
We need to get them out of this new world order

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.140
so that this isn't erased.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.140
The way to think about this in case you're not there

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.100
is that they have told us that we have an ongoing RNA

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.460
viral pandemic that started in 2020

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.080
and has been going on for five years,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.880
five years of sustained RNA transmission

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.720
that started in a point in a puddle,

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.800
at an animal cage and has gone around the world

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.560
since it leaked, that's ridiculous.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.720
But it is a faith that no one questions

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.120
and it is a faith that your children can be trapped in

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.920
if you don't start pointing it out to them

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.760
that we are in the fifth year of this lie.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.440
I never thought we'd get this far.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.800
And you can see it as a background.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.160
They don't know what was in the background before.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.120
It could be just noise like on a radio

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.280
that they've turned really loud

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.720
and then told you there's organization inside of it.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.040
And this RNA signal being confounded as spread

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.120
could have been seeded.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.120
They could have seeded the sequence using RNA or RNA clones

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.480
or the DNA construct and put it in sewers.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.920
And the PCR would have been positive.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.560
Some people would have probably complained

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.080
because the spike protein and N protein are immunogenic

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.520
and would have annoyed their immune system.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.440
So a transfection by a clone

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.560
would have done everything and more to create

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.080
and see the illusion of the pandemic

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.680
without endangering anybody, except for the people who bought in.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.960
So the way to see these people that are meddling with us

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.560
is they don't ever talk about the childhood vaccine schedule

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.120
as being criminal.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.320
I heard Pierre Corey on Jimmy Dorr last night

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.000
saying it was criminal and I loved it.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.880
So good for Pierre Corey.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.440
Advocate for strict liability of all pharmaceutical products.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.800
That's the way you speak to lawyers.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.120
You just say, no, I don't want to talk about

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:26.960
all this other stuff.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.720
Why don't we advocate for strict liability?

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.800
Why don't we use the Seventh Amendment

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.960
to strike this prep act?

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.800
We need to start saying that regularly.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800
Investigate the use of deadly protocols

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.400
to create mass casualty events

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.520
that were misconstrued as spread

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.800
and investigate whether or not

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.360
transfection could have been used

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.200
to compound that problem or to create

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.360
the molecular illusion of it.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.480
Declare or take your sovereignty back from them

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.480
and the sovereignty of your children

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.720
and withdraw from the who in the UN entirely.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.040
And if you want to see the medlers,

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.360
they're not talking about this stuff.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.520
They rarely cite the deadly protocols.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.120
That's number three.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.960
They rarely use the word transfection

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.160
although Brett Weinstein occasionally does.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.520
They never use the word clone to explain anything.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.080
And in fact, if they use the word clone,

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.000
they use it to ridicule me.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.560
And finally, they attack people instead of ideas

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.880
and they're unable to summarize across the entire show.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.960
And that's really evident with somebody like,

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.400
with somebody like Kevin McCurnan,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.640
who has defended transfection in the past

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.240
by saying, I hope we don't throw the baby out

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.920
with the bathwater because of this contamination.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.040
And has also very distinctly not spoken up

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.800
about any of the protocols ever,

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.120
which of course were used to justify

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.840
the rollout of this product.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.040
And if you really wanted to bring everybody to attention

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.600
and to understand how badly with bamboozled,

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.720
you would tell the whole story, at least in a nutshell,

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.520
and not just say it's double-stranded DNA

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.840
and then my hair's on fire.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.280
And the reason why they're doing this

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.840
is because the rich people in private meetings

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.080
have been saying for a long time,

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.840
we gotta start collecting this data from these people

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.480
before they're gone.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.840
And since we're gonna get rid of them,

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.400
we should start collecting that data.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.480
They want your kids and they want your kids kids.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.120
So this is a multi-generational thing.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.720
You don't have to think about this

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.040
gonna be over in a couple of years.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.040
This is not gonna stop because they've convinced themselves

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.840
that if they collect enough data and the AI evolves,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.600
that we're eventually gonna solve all this

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600
and we're gonna become the transhuman futurists

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.400
that everybody wants us to be.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.080
So please stop transfection and human

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.840
because they are trying to eliminate the control group

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.000
by any means necessary.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.200
That's the end.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.000
I'm open for questions, thank you.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.440
Well done, JJ, great job.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.240
Sorry, that was so long.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.800
I didn't realize that was so long.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.640
It was wonderful.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.120
So we'll go back to our normal process.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.840
Steven, next 15 minutes,

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.240
and then Jim, you'll be first after Steven.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.040
So Steven...

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.840
They had a cold previously

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.600
and for a couple of months, if they had flu

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.720
and they also lost their sense of smell,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.440
it's just amazing.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.360
So it seems to me that people operating cults

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.920
and they just operate on a belief system

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.520
and that's how we solve,

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.680
they don't, they're not capable of analysis

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.400
but actually even the people who are capable of analysis,

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.920
they overthink everything

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.480
and think their tiny little area of science

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.200
is gonna solve the world's problems.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.000
No, without them putting it into context,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.080
what they're saying,

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.600
that it has no significance whatsoever.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.360
It's completely lost and they might as well not bother.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.080
So I just wondered what your comments are about that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.480
I mean, yeah, I agree.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
Right now we're just,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.400
I don't wanna get too explanatory about it

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.280
and pigeonhole myself

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.840
and it just, I wanna be sure that this possibility

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.080
of there being real biology

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.800
that could have been used to mislead us

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.240
and even misleading virologists

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.440
and misleading molecular biologists

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.320
into believing that this signal is higher fidelity.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.080
So it is cultish, but it's cultish with real,

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.760
you know, it's like if you went to a ceremony at some cult

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.680
and across the water was a giant, a giant idol

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.680
and in front of that idol,

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.760
a bunch of people looked like they were,

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.440
they were, I don't know, sacrificing goats.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.720
From the other side of the river,

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.040
you don't know what they're doing

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.120
and a lot of us are on the other side of the river

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.360
with regard to the pandemic.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.000
We don't really know what's going on behind the scenes.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.360
We don't know what goes on behind the idol.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.080
We don't know where those lights are coming from

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.720
or whether those people and those costumes

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.000
are who they say they are.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.360
And so we're really lost here.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.360
I think it's very important to realize

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.200
that so many of us have been duped

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.240
into accepting people as not,

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.520
I don't like the word savior,

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.840
but as people who are trying to come to the rescue

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.360
on white horses when this script almost certainly

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.760
prepared that for us, it had to have.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.160
And only in retrospect as it becomes so visible.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.080
So I think you're right in characterizing it that way,

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.560
but it is extremely diabolical

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.840
because not everybody who's participating

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.600
knows that they have been bamboozled.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.320
I did not know how badly I was being fooled

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.680
and how many people were active in fooling me

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.400
for those first two and a half years.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.040
It's only obvious now.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.280
It's strange because it's strange

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.400
that even you could get into it

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400
because it was obvious to me from the beginning

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.920
that everything was wrong.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.360
Nay, nay, that's different, maybe you have to,

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.960
you have to, you have to see

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.400
that that's not what I was thinking.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.960
Those aren't the questions I was asking.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.600
I was not asking, is the pandemic real?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.920
I was asking, is the virus lab leak or natural?

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.760
And if you're not.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.120
Yeah, but this is the point I'm trying to make

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.600
with this talk is that if you were asking the question

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.120
of whether the pandemic is real or fake,

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.160
you were stuck in a certain path that was very different

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.760
than being stuck in the, is the pandemic a natural

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760
or a lab leak.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.800
And if you picked the right people,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.400
you were gonna be stuck over here

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.040
and you were never, ever, ever going to be allowed

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.880
to ask this question.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.880
Do you understand that if you're in a private chat

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.760
with a bunch of people that think this is a low-level lab leak,

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.040
you can't ever get those people to discuss the possibility

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.440
that they might be completely wrong?

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.080
And the questions that they ask are going to fuel

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.880
this very limited spectrum of debate

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.640
that's very vigorous within it.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.960
And if it's somebody like Joe Rogan talking

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.240
to Mike Osterholm, it's these are things

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.800
that people all have to sort out.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.640
And as an academic biologist, I went with academia.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.600
I got stuck with academia.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.280
And so I was trying to sort out what's wrong with academia

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.040
and to get all the way to the stage where I can now

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.040
relatively succinctly explain how screwed up academia is.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.160
It took me a long time.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.640
I needed to get far enough away from it so I could see it.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.760
And so every person, every doctor, every health care worker,

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.840
every carpenter that bought into this mystery

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.880
needs to work their own way out.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.360
And there were own way away from this

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.680
because they've been so entranced and enchanted

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.880
to solve this mystery.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.480
And then they also, don't forget, almost all of us

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.600
came to the conclusion that we had solved it,

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.760
that I was winning, that I had finally figured it out.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.760
And that's a very dangerous place to be,

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.120
because then you can really be really hard to be convinced

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:33.920
that you've been fooled.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.760
And that's where I was.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.000
And I brought a lot of people there.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.720
And a lot of people in my family or family and friends in circle

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:43.520
took the shot because I wasn't arguing the right biology.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.200
I was telling them it was a lab leak.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.640
So hey, if I say it's a lab leak, but you don't have to worry about it,

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.360
how are you going to take my word for that?

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.480
And that's what I was saying.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.280
It's a lab leak, but you don't have to worry about it

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.080
because your immune system is strong.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.880
And all you have to do is doubt your health

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.200
or doubt your immune system or say, well, I'm not as good a shape as Jay,

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.440
I better take the transfection.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.080
So I didn't save anyone when I could have saved someone

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.720
because I was fooled by the same narrative.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.200
And that's what I think is so powerful about my story,

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.240
because I can start crying about it.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.280
And one of my friends had an aneurysm on December,

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.960
I don't remember what the date is anymore,

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.560
but he had an aneurysm, just a freak.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.400
He's just dead.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.960
He's got two daughters and a beautiful wife.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.960
And he's gone forever because he and his family took the shots

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.600
because I didn't have it.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.320
I didn't have the story back then.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.800
And it's really important that people see that it's OK.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.240
We all didn't have the story.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.880
And if we can all come to this realization,

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880
we can all collectively lift each other out.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.560
There's it really is an important moment, I think.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.400
Yeah.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.600
So one, just very quickly, I get traction when I say

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.400
that I'm a medical doctor to people I don't even know.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.280
I just talk to them.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.560
I know how to talk to people, as Jerry Brady says.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:12.240
And when I say that I'm a doctor, not for any glory or anything,

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.760
obviously.

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.200
And then I say, no pandemic, I get their interest.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.520
And then I say, by the way, there's no novel disease either.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.320
There's no COVID-19.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.000
And they say, oh, well, I had COVID.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I said, don't think he did.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But by that time, we usually got some kind of conversation going.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.560
And they kind of believe me.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.240
But I noticed that they are a bit disturbed.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.600
They're very confident about saying they've had COVID prior

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.640
to me saying no pandemic, no novel disease.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:48.000
And so it is a way, I think, that we can influence people.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.360
But maybe you need to be a brilliant biologist,

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.000
like you, or a doctor.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.160
Because they hesitate to kind of take me on.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.120
Because it may probably look as though I mean business,

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.400
because I do.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:06.000
But anyway, I wanted to ask you, the gain of function thing.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.280
I think maybe the message is being missed by some people.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.040
So in my opinion, the gain of function research,

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.760
which they're plugging and saying, oh, how illegal it is.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.400
And the people are saying, oh, it's terrible.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.760
They're doing gain of function research.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.480
United States is funding this gain of function research.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.440
But they don't understand even the people on our side

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.760
who should know better.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.040
They don't understand the talk about the gain

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.480
of function research and saying how bad it is

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.280
and how it shouldn't be going on.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.760
And I think David Martin talks about it.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.720
They don't understand that they're playing into the narrative.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.280
And I think that's what you're saying

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.480
through much of the talk.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.040
And I don't know how we kind of phrase it

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.800
so that people really understand it.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.160
Yeah, I mean, I think that that's the reason why I'm trying

01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.760
to teach the clones in different ways.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.320
Because the gain of function, anything that they do,

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.240
anytime they insert something or they make a synthetic virus,

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.560
they're making clones.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.760
So it's only a question of how much that they make.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.840
They make a little bit, or they make a lot.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.240
Because the RNA is still not suddenly endowed

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.240
with extra copying capabilities

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.760
because you put an extra base or two in there.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.640
That doesn't change the properties

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.360
of this multipoly protein replication complex

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360
that's hardly even understood.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.280
And so you can put whatever RNA you want

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.560
and you're limited by copying it

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.480
with an RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.640
So they keep making all these statements

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.520
about what's going on.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.880
But there's nothing that you can do to the spike protein

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.560
to change how well the RNA that codes for it is copied.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.280
That's like ridiculous.

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:50.440
And that's the argument that we needed to learn

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.080
the weaknesses of it from the very beginning

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.040
because all of us just bought into the cartoon

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.960
that there are viruses and then they replicate

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.840
and then we cough them out and then other people get sick.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.840
And it wasn't until I started really getting challenge

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.680
on that and really listening to the objections

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.080
of some of these people like Mark Bailey,

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.280
where I started to see

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.480
that there was something really incongruent.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.200
And I still feel like we need to revisit

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.480
a lot of these narratives because best case scenario

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.920
for virology and biology is that the fidelity

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.320
of the signal has been grossly exaggerated

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.440
but there are signals that we could characterize

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.480
as a measles virus or a flu virus

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.080
or maybe even coronaviruses.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.080
But the worst case scenario for virology

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.160
is that all of these are simply amplified noise

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.080
that's been mischaracterized as transmitting pathogens

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.440
which in that case we have been probably actively misled

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.360
by people controlling this sort of thought space

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.320
which is a much more diabolical situation

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.200
and it goes back to AIDS and the people

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.840
who controlled the biology story of AIDS

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.680
and goes back to the whole vaccine schedule in America

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.320
going from live attenuated vaccines

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.160
to recombinant vaccines that were given intramuscularly.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.760
So that's the problem with this too

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.920
is that a lot of these people,

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.960
that's why I say that at the end

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.480
how can you see the medlers,

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.600
it's very hard to imagine that someone on this journey

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.200
of discovery in the pandemic would stop at,

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.280
wow, I guess they made a mistake with the transfection

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.080
and so we should fix that before we move forward.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.240
Like it's kind of a very selective attention

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.360
on the lies and a very big amount of lies

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.560
are ignored in that interpretation of reality.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.240
And so it's hard for me to believe

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.160
that very many of the people that are on our team

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.200
can still basically say that they think vaccinations

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.680
in general are very good like Brett Weinstein still says.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.680
And this is a very big red flag for me

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.240
that almost everybody that lost their career

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.240
and got censored and had to shake a can on the internet

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.080
should be at the stage where they realize

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.320
that the CDC is the largest producer of vaccines in America

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.200
and that we have a schedule with more shots

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.640
that are earlier than any other Western civilization country

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.880
in the world and that alone, that difference alone

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.560
should be enough to call on criminal.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.160
It's broad, I do this, absolute broad.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.080
Yeah, so I just wanted to ask you this key question, JJ.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.040
I don't know whether it's key,

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.840
but it just seems to be to me.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.440
I think that biology, genomics,

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.520
I'm not sure about genomics and epidemiology,

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.520
but yes, I think so.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.600
Biology, certainly virology, genomics, epidemiology,

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.080
evidence-based medicine were constricts

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.920
to achieve exactly what they launched in 2020.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.680
And that epidemiology, sorry, immunology,

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.360
that as the virology increased in importance

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.880
in inverted commas, the immunology sank into,

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.920
wasn't seen, you know?

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.760
So the very subject which taught us all

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.120
how brilliant the human immune system is

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.040
and presumably the immune system of animals too,

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.640
that went, lost its influence in the 80s.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.720
When I was at medical school, immunologists

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.240
were kings of medicine,

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.960
but now it seems that the virologists

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.280
wanted to be kings of medicine.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.000
And I think that what they've been doing is fraudulent

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.960
and it was a construct.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.600
I don't know it was fraudulent, but I think it was.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.040
I feel that it was.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.240
And it was a construct which was necessary

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.720
for these bastards to do what they did in 2020.

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.240
I think it's very possible that a lot of this mythology

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.080
will break down.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
I do, I do.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.360
Yeah.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.920
I don't think we're under any obligation

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.440
to be sophisticated enough to delineate

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.680
what parts are fake and what parts are not.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.520
We just need to be focused on the current regime of lies

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.200
and then work backwards from there.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.840
Yeah, but we have to be able to attack

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.680
the world of virology if that's what we need to do

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.920
in many different ways.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.320
And so I'm just thinking a little bit further

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.240
than the end of my nose or trying to,

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.680
because a doctor should be thinking about the possibilities

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.560
and warning his patients or the world if necessary

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.640
about dangers.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.160
And so, yeah, so there was something else

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.360
that has gone out of my head.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360
Yeah, I liked your,

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.800
I liked your examples.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.640
Your analogies were excellent, I thought.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.200
So you talked about how our children are on the train

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.160
and we have little time to get them off the train.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.960
You didn't use those exact words,

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.920
but I understand what you're saying.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.280
We, and what I think the train was,

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.680
was endless, deadly viral pandemics in the future.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.680
And not only was there no pandemic in 2020, in my opinion,

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.720
but actually the possibility that there can be pandemics

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.240
in the future, I think is another construct.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.440
They put this about so that they can instill fear

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.760
into the population and thereby achieve their aims.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.160
It's just necessary to have the fear

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.800
and put out the propaganda.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.040
So the whole thing that people are fearing disease X

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:29.160
and people who shouldn't be distracted are distracted.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.480
I won't mention names,

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.760
but you must have seen the disease X and Marburg.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.920
It's just nonsense.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.760
And we don't need to fear all this nonsense, you know,

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.040
and thinking about the next pandemic.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.080
So the British governments, I need to tell you this, JJ.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.040
They, so they had an inquiry in the,

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.120
are having an inquiry, COVID inquiry.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.360
I try not to watch it because it's so bad.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:58.240
And what they'd intent on doing is saying to the,

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.400
the agenda is to say to the British people,

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.880
well, actually we should have locked down a bit earlier, you know,

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.040
and then it would have been a lot better.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.920
And so along comes Boris Johnson,

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.600
the former prime minister of the UK,

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.320
who has many, many faults.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.600
He actually determined the remit of the person

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.840
who's doing the inquiry,

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.360
but of course he's out of power now.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.120
So he comes along, I think he blew the whistle.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.160
He said, so she was commiserating after two days of evidence

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.720
when Boris broke down, you know,

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.360
and the story in the newspaper that Boris broke down

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.960
because everything was so sad,

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.000
we should have locked down earlier.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But guess what?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.320
Boris comes out at the end when she's commiserating with him.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.360
And he says, I don't think I'll see you in the,

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360
in the near future.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360
And I was thinking to herself,

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.440
well, what world is that?

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.840
You know, he's describing,

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.920
I think he'd been meeting,

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.200
they'd been meeting at every party in the,

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.600
in the near future.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.640
So he said, I don't think it was,

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.680
he said, I think, but you can't look into it.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.680
I think we need to determine where this came from.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.000
Well, dead right, but nobody noticed JJ.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.160
Nobody noticed.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.480
I thought, wow, the former prime minister of the UK,

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.160
who was beaten into following the narrative,

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.120
in my opinion, likely,

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.840
he was blowing the whistle at the end of his evidence

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.080
of the COVID inquiry.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.640
And nobody noticed, except me.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.360
And well, if he says, if we says,

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.600
I would argue that if he says,

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.520
we need to determine where the virus comes from,

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.360
that he's telling you,

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.960
you need to solve the mystery of the Scooby.

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.320
No, he just said it.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.160
He said it.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.000
Yeah, it's okay.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.680
Goodness knows what he meant.

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.200
I'd love to contact him and find out what he meant,

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.080
but probably he's got an army of people stopping people

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.240
getting to him.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:50.200
So you remember when he went into the hospital

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.160
and he was terrified allegedly for his life,

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.320
he ended up in ICU.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.800
I don't think he was in hospital.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.800
Or he was in the emergency.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.200
He was predicted to go into the hospital

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.240
in the Olympic Games ceremony, right?

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.000
I mean, we saw,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.200
is it the 2012 games that were in London,

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200
where they had the virus from above

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.520
and they had a giant death walking around

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.760
with all the attribute,

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.960
or it was a tribute to the NHS

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.800
and they had all these beds being pushed around

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.320
and one of the people that was in the sick beds was him.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.440
So like they told us that it's beyond absurd.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.280
He wasn't in the bed.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.920
Yeah.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.800
I didn't know that.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.720
You've never seen that?

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.240
There was a guy with yellow hair

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.000
and he was like in the bed whining

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.360
and they made him look absurd.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.520
It was like a caricature of him.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520
Wow. Yeah.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.280
Oh yeah.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.120
There's many minutes there.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.720
It's a possibility that I don't know for certain,

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.760
but it's a real possibility

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.520
to think about the Boris Johnson.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.680
Didn't believe what was going on in 2020

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.200
and he had to be persuaded.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.120
So it could be.

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.120
Yeah. It could be.

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.000
OK.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.320
All right.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.480
Thank you, Stephen.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.560
OK, now Jim had his hand up first

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.840
and what happens with Zoom

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.040
is if someone says anything

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.840
that takes your hand down automatically.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.640
So Wolfgang, I saw you came in there,

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.280
but Jim first and Jerry.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.680
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.720
Great presentation.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:17.760
And I'd like Stephen for us to read.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:22.120
And I have a little bit of a different view on things.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.960
I'm concerned about not about the virus or whatever,

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.920
but the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.720
as a bioterror weapon,

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.560
engineered pure and cleavage site

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:38.000
from a bacteria put on that spike protein.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.960
And we are seemingly living the plot

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.120
of a Tom Clancy book called Rainbow Six,

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.560
where a alleged virus is released

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.560
into the Olympic Games

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.320
to spread around the world and the vaccine.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.800
It's worse than the virus that he populated the Earth

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.440
by radical environmentalists

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.440
in the name of climate change.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.160
My question has to deal with

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.920
how we prove or first getting immunity

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:14.600
and if you can address NK and T cell immunity

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.520
as good immunity versus IgG immunity as bad immunity

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.720
that they're measured, they had VAD, CDC

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.840
and everybody's measuring right now.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.960
And if you can address the different types of spike protein,

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.160
meaning the first spike protein

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.440
is the one that was transmitted by computer

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.960
from Wuhan, allegedly.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:41.000
Number two, the spike protein that was allegedly engineered

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
by Jason McClellan using proline restraints,

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.120
six proline restraints

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.000
and I emailed you a video of his presentation

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and how that spike protein invaginates into,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.240
goes into, gets into cell

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:05.320
and number three, the spike proteins

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.920
that are allegedly made by the DNA contaminants

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.840
that seem to be correlating very well

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.280
with the dangerous lot numbers or batch numbers

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.640
and how bad is my batch.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.560
Thank you.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.040
T cell immunity and natural killer cell immunity

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.120
is complicated and we don't know a lot about it

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.120
but I can generalize to say that in my last three years

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.880
of reading, it seems apparent from the primary literature

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.320
that T cell immunity is formed to proteins

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.760
that are conserved across a wide variety of viruses.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.440
One of the most conserved proteins

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.800
would be these proteins that are in the replication,

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.720
transcription complex

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.240
and those proteins are highly conserved

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.840
across all of these supposed variants of SARS.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.640
That's why they only show you the spike protein

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.160
and only talk about that

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.200
because of the other 30 proteins that are in the coronavirus

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.240
they don't seem to be changing and they don't care.

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.680
So that's already an obvious tell

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.000
that this narrative about the spike protein

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.480
is really not biologically plausible

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.040
because you have other people saying

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.360
that the spike protein is the only protein that matters

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.600
or the only one that's changing

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.800
and that's just not plausible given the way

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.320
that we know RNA is copied.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.960
So I would suggest to you that T cells

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.680
that are relevant for any of these RNA signals

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:31.840
are gonna be primarily aimed at RNA dependent RNA polymerase

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.400
or accessory proteins that are common across these viruses.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.480
Another common one is actually the N protein

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.000
because it is around the N protein that this RNA is coiled

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.720
and so you can't really vary that protein too much

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.480
and then get packaging to go well,

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.160
at least in their cartoons.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.000
So that is another gene that they have looked at

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.320
in the past as a general indicator of coronavirus presence

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:58.720
and now they have obfuscated this idea to say

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.360
that this N protein can be used to identify

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.800
a particular coronavirus and it's up to molecular biologists

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.840
to judge whether that's true or not

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.040
but the vast majority of these PCR's

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.680
are not using nested primers

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.080
and so there's a certain level of accuracy

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:19.760
that's just not possible that a lot of academic biologists

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.640
assume is there.

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.680
If you want me to give you that little briefing

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.600
and I've never really done it before

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600
but I think it's a good idea to try and do it here

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.440
because you asked the question.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:31.480
When you amplify the whole virus genome,

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.720
it's a very long genome

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.120
and you actually are usually, sorry,

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.720
I'm bumping my camera there.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.200
You usually are looking for like a very small amplicon.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.040
This amplicon might be only 300 bases long

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.040
whereas the whole genome is 30,000 bases long.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.920
And so you might look for two amplicons.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.920
You might look for a spike protein amplicon

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.040
and RNA dependent polymerase amplicon

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.280
and this would have been in the old days, pre-2020,

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.800
pre-2020, dang it, I keep hitting my camera.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.120
This would have been any coronavirus.

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.280
You would have used PCR to find two small fragments

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.680
and then you would have used metagenomic sequencing

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.520
to amplify everything in the sample

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.040
and then use a algorithm to see

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.720
if there was a full coronavirus genome.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.640
Most of the time you wouldn't find a full genome

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.360
and so instead you would just replace the genes

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.520
you didn't find with genes that you found in the literature

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.320
and then you would make a DNA clone of this sequence

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.360
that you purported to have found in nature.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.680
After 2020, they've been doing the same thing

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.120
where they first said that we're gonna look

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.080
for a small amplicon in the spike protein

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.720
and we're gonna look for a small amplicon

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.440
in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.680
and then at some moment in time

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.840
they changed what they're looking at

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.480
and now they're looking at N protein

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.640
which is even farther out here on the genome.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.480
It doesn't really matter.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.800
And this is N, this is S, this would be ORF1.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.920
The point is, is that when they look for these amplicons

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.880
they're finding a very small signal

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.840
and the best analogy that I can come up with

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.840
would be to say that the local library got blown up by a bomb

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.080
and none of the books got burnt

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.760
but they all got blown into a million pieces

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.880
and so I think that you, Jim,

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.000
you've written a yoga book

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.160
and I have primers that can find the sentences

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.320
of your yoga book

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.040
and if I find the sentences that correspond

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.600
to your yoga book, I can prove to you

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.280
that you wrote a yoga book you didn't even know you wrote

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.200
and so I look for a few sentences

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.240
that are pretty common across a lot of books

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.640
like the following is an explanation of

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.360
or an alternative way of doing this would be

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.480
and then I claim that this is very specific for your book.

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.360
I mean, look, it's right here on page 67.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.400
It's really your book

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.200
and then I find that signal in the burnt exploded library

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.040
and I say, look, Jim, you wrote a book

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.400
and that's very similar to how they've found coronaviruses

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.240
in the past.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.680
They look for signals and they find a very short portion

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.480
that is thought to be shared across many coronaviruses

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.800
and then they look for the whole book in this pile of words

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.360
and it's very easy to assemble the whole yoga book

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.280
if you can use all the words in an exploded dictionary

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.200
or an exploded library

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.680
and it's hard for us to know as biologists

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.600
what signals are actually there at this size scale

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.760
because the only way we have to probe it is with PCR.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.240
So you almost have to know what you're looking for

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.080
before you look for it and then when you look for it,

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.240
you won't know if it was there for real

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.560
or if it was just a sentence from another book

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.520
and the most important thing to see here

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.680
is that in biology we're not using a dictionary

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.560
that's got 10 million words in it

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.400
and we're not using words that are spelled

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.240
lots of different letters.

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.080
We're using a limited number of bases

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.080
that code for a limited number of codons

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.440
which code for a limited number of amino acids.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.960
So the shorter you choose the amplicon to seek,

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.000
the more likely it is that you're gonna find a signal

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.240
that's not related to what you thought you were,

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.560
i.e. if you look for once upon a time

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.080
you're gonna find a lot of signals in that blown up library.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.520
And so to get back to your question

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.600
to make sure I don't lose my track of my thought here

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.320
the spike in Wuhan is actually a,

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.480
I'm gonna cut back over here,

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.960
I apologize for this, I'm just gonna do it quick like this.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.160
The spike in Wuhan, that's this camera,

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:31.160
spike in Wuhan is a construct that was made like this.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.920
It was made with an assembly

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.000
and my question would be in terms of the clone

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.520
is that keep in mind this has to do with vaccines

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.240
and it has to do with converting us,

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.120
I apologize for this long answer

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.200
but I hope it's good.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.840
And converting us to believe

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.560
that the previous combination of substances

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.200
which we injected to Augmentia immune system

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.480
is not as good as the current new combination

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:00.200
of substances that we augmentia immune system with.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.320
And the way that they fooled you with that

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.640
is they probably put this spike protein

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.600
that they wanted to inject to you into these places.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.160
And that's what I think you're hinting at

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.120
is that the design is not only the proleens

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.120
to keep it from being able to change confirmation.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.720
The design probably was the insertion of small epitopes

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.720
that companies like Epivax and other companies

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.320
have been working on for decades

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.040
to try and find ways to make proteins

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.160
that your immune system ignores

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.160
into proteins that your immune system pays attention to.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.160
Because the current way or the old school way

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.480
that you do that is that you take

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.960
a recombinant protein that you made in a laboratory

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.200
and you inject it into the muscle of a child

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.280
in combination with heavy metals or other toxins.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.280
And those toxins attract the attention

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.960
of the immune system and macrophages

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.280
and they try to process this garbage.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.600
And one of the arguments is that the processing

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.760
of that toxin also causes the processing of those proteins

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.480
and then you develop antibody immunity

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.080
to those proteins that you made.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.960
The trouble is is that your immune system

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:12.920
is learning to respond to something on the inside now.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.720
And so the antibodies that you make are on the inside.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.640
The T cells that you made are not to anything

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.800
other than those proteins.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.160
And when those proteins aren't around,

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.480
those T cells don't have anything to do.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.760
And the trick here, I'm just gonna keep talking

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.480
because I think this is all really good stuff

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.040
that probably you don't hear very often.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.400
The other thing to keep in mind

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:35.960
is that there's two different mechanisms

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.120
that are going on here with regard

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:41.160
to the immunity.

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.880
So when a virus is replicating in your cells

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.880
or when your cells are transfected,

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:52.080
the main thing to realize is that there is a molecule called,

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.560
I'm drawing it in the wrong shape

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.080
because this is like the shape of an antibody,

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.760
but it shouldn't be really in the shape of antibody.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.920
I apologize.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.400
But it's a molecule that can present other molecules.

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:05.040
And this molecule is called MHC.

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.480
There are two different kinds, MHC one and MHC two

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.680
that I don't wanna confuse you with.

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.520
Just understand that when your cells are making stuff,

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.000
they need to report what they're making on the outside

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.720
by presenting small fragments to the immune system.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.160
And so there are T cells that are patrolling

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.680
your immune system all the time

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:27.560
and checking that like a little bouncer,

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.080
checking to see that the ID on this cell is okay.

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.560
Are you guys cancer cells?

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.880
Are you doing what you're supposed to do

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:35.080
and making act in and other things?

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:38.120
And so there are natural killer cells

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.920
and there are T cells that are doing this check

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:45.000
that are seeing what on the major histocompatibility complex

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.800
is being presented and whether that jives

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.000
with the other signals that are present on that cell

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.960
and so that the immune system can confirm

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:55.040
that this cell's doing what it's supposed to do.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.720
When a cell is producing virus,

01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.280
the idea is is that on the MHC molecule,

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.040
there will be viral proteins presented

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.120
that the T cells can recognize and come

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.120
and destroy this cell before it's able to release full variants.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.600
And of course, the earlier that protein is expressed on MHC,

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.840
the better chance we have.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:19.680
If you recall that cartoon we looked at an hour ago,

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.520
the first proteins that are expressed

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.480
during coronavirus infection, according to the scientists,

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.520
are these replicase transcription complex proteins.

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.240
So if those are presented and they are shared

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:33.680
across the number of these viral species,

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.240
then this would be the way that T cells would be activated

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.720
and have absolutely nothing to do with the spike protein,

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:44.120
which would be necessarily expressed later.

01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.160
And also because of the nature of the way it is,

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.960
it's gonna be on the outside of the cell,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.560
not presented on MHC, but on the outside of the cell,

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.000
which is a very different signal.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.560
Now this is the worst part.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.520
When we transfect a cell,

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.360
the MHC is not going to be presenting in the same way

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.760
because all these antiviral things are not activated

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.240
because they've chemically altered the RNA

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.200
to make it invisible to our cells, internal machinery.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.640
It just sits there and it's there for a long time.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.200
And it expresses the spike protein

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.040
on the outside of the body or outside of the cell

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.760
and it expresses small fragments

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.880
of the spike protein on MHC.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.760
This is a problem because if the body

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.480
doesn't, can't tell the difference,

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.640
it's gonna destroy this cell

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.480
and then it's gonna try and process it.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.880
And every time it does that,

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.600
there's a potential that it's gonna process

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.200
something of its own and it's gonna cause autoimmunity.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.280
That's less likely to occur in an infection

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.960
because that infection is occurring at a barrier.

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.240
Cells that are patrolled regularly by the immune system

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.960
like epithelial cells,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.360
the orientation of the immune system

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.440
is oriented around patrolling those cells.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.920
If you transfect someone and that LNP goes anywhere

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:05.360
in the body, then cells are gonna be doing,

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.480
they're gonna be presenting bad proteins

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.880
that normally the immune system does not expect them

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.800
to express bad proteins, not as an expressed,

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.800
the proteins that infection vulnerable barrier cells

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.640
are expressing.

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.240
And so this is a whole different task

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.720
for the immune system to sort out.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:26.400
And so your question of spike in Wuhan is so important

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.960
because the idea for me would be

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.160
that if you really wanted to pull off this show

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.240
and make sure that the entire Earth thought

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.440
that transfection was pretty effective,

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.840
you better choose a protein that your body won't ignore.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.160
You better choose a protein

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.880
that after the fourth transfection,

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.960
you still get a bump in antibody response.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:52.440
And that's not guaranteed for every protein.

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.560
In fact, most proteins without any alteration,

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.560
your body would build tolerance to very, very, very quickly.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.040
And so it's very striking that even from the fourth

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.800
transfection, people are still building

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:10.480
a noticeable bump of antibody seroprevalence.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.840
That's very dangerous.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.840
And it's dangerous because again, this attack,

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.680
it should not be blood-based.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.960
So there's no reason to have a preponderance

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.800
of IgG antibodies.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.080
You want to have T-cells

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:26.120
that are eliminating viral infection before it starts

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.200
in the cells where viral expression is supposed to be.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.120
So this whole engineering of the spike protein

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.640
may have even been kind of a red herring

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.960
to make you confused about the fact that,

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.920
okay, what's the dangerous part about this spike?

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.600
And thinking about whether they have eliminated

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.400
the dangerous part of the spike or not,

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.200
when in reality, it is the transfection

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.080
of your cells and the randomness of it

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.440
that leads to the dangers rather than

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:56.800
any particular aspect of the transfection in general.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.600
And then if I go all the way to the double-stranded DNA

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.880
question, it's not that I don't think

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.080
the double-stranded DNA packaged in a lipid nanoparticle

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.280
or not wouldn't be dangerous.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.840
I think it's probably pretty dangerous.

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.440
That's why they keep it out of all biologics

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:15.040
using anion chromatography to remove it

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.920
from monoclonal antibodies, for example.

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.120
There's no DNA allowed in a protein biologic none.

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.200
If you have DNA in it, it will be canceled.

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.880
That lot will be destroyed.

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.760
So this is an extra interesting aspect of making RNA

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.960
because you can't use the normal procedures,

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.440
the accepted gold standard to get rid of the contamination

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.640
because you can't separate RNA and DNA very easily.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.920
So that's another tricky thing that they just completely

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.680
ignored as they rolled out this transfection

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.440
and then conveniently brought it up as a problem

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.520
only afterward, we rushed it, we didn't know.

01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.400
We should've used better methodologies.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.240
We shouldn't have made such big batches.

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.600
All of these are excuses to make you think

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.520
that transfection could be good if they had done it right.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.360
And that I have been saying is a lie

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.120
for at least three years, if not four.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.600
It was the only thing I could see through

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.200
from the very beginning that they were confounding

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:09.200
this narrative of, oh my gosh, we chose the wrong spike

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.760
and the spike was gaining a function.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:12.280
Now it's even worse.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.560
And that was all just, that's just all an act

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.760
to make you think that transfection could be good

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.120
if they just got their act together.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.560
Holy cow, I hope I answered something.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.800
Yeah, well you took Jay Jay Jay.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.160
Thanks very much.

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.480
But 20 minutes and you've got six hands up

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.880
and we're finishing in half an hour.

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.160
So you better handle it.

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.880
Okay, faster next time.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.720
Yes.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.560
So, Jerry.

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.320
Hi, Jay Jay.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:39.480
Hello, my favorite long hair.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.800
Yeah.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.800
A stroke off GP from Ireland.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.440
And our suspended GP from Ireland,

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.880
I've still suspended temporarily three years ago.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.720
You just talked to Steve in there about,

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.760
you know, I don't know, I don't want to waste your time,

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.040
but you're talking about Steve,

01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.760
to Steve in a sort of being cut and being fooled.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.040
It was all about perspective.

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.760
It's a perspective of the observer.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.240
I as a GP could see there was no illness.

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.880
There were no major illness in the community.

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.920
There were no people dying of COVID.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.560
So it's very, very easy for me to cop on to the fact

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:14.920
that COVID was a hoax.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:18.680
And that in effect, you know, it didn't smell right.

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:21.800
And then to look at the PCR test, you know,

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:25.240
it's quite obvious that it really couldn't diagnose COVID

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.960
or a pathogen as such.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.680
But what I'd like to ask you about,

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.920
you used to work clone, you know, surely all viruses

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:38.200
or clones in the sense that are in exact replicov,

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:42.960
you know, in the absence of a sexual reproduction,

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.080
but they are a clone.

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.640
So I'd just like to elucidate your use of the word clone.

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:48.480
Sure.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.520
You know, I'll try and draw a little picture of it

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:51.520
because I think it's important

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:55.040
and a lot of people are asking that question, so it's good.

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.960
So I think where I would like to go with this

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.160
is just to draw a little cartoon about how it's done.

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:06.160
So when you copy DNA, the DNA strand opens up, right?

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:10.040
And then it comes back together as it's copied.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:15.040
And that coming back together can reveal mismatched bases.

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.400
And because of the nature of copying DNA,

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.280
there are actually accessory proteins

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.880
that are accessory to the main protein, the RNA polymerase.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.240
There are accessory proteins that can proofread

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:30.480
and correct the mismatched bases that are here.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.680
And that's well known DNA replication in bacteria

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.640
is very high fidelity.

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:39.480
But in the cartoon of a viral replication,

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.240
you have a single stranded RNA

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.920
that is copied by an RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:48.880
And that copying is definitely not high fidelity.

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.240
And even though they claim

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.920
that there are accessory proteins

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.920
that can increase the fidelity, the error rate is real.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.880
And so when you copy a 30,000 base pair RNA,

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:04.000
it is by necessity, according to most virologists,

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.920
you will make three errors.

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.480
You cannot, it is not possible

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.120
to use an RNA dependent polymerase

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.000
and copy 30,000 bases perfectly.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.320
You can do that with DNA

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:18.560
because there's a proofreading step that corrects.

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.560
So not only is this enzyme, the DNA polymerase,

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:28.960
is that not only is that enzyme known to be orders

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.440
of magnitude higher fidelity,

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.880
but it's known to have accessory proteins

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.520
that are orders of magnitude higher fidelity.

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:40.160
And it's all dependent on this double stranded model.

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:43.480
And that's absent in all RNA viruses

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.040
because they're all single stranded.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.680
It's either there are a couple double stranded RNA viruses.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.800
I should be careful.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.840
But most of them are negative or positive strand.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:51.960
And positive strand means

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.080
that they can be translated directly into protein.

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.520
Negative means they have to have their own enzyme

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.680
to do that translation.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.760
So flu and measles need their own enzyme.

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.720
AIDS needs its own enzyme,

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.360
but coronaviruses are special.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.800
They don't because they're positive stranded RNAs.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:10.320
They can be translated directly into proteins.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.800
And one of those proteins that they need to translate

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.280
right away is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.360
before they can ever copy themselves.

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:21.400
And so the reason why I would argue

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.680
that these viruses, if they exist at all,

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:26.320
are so difficult to culture.

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.240
For example, they might do a 96 well plate preparation

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.440
from a bat and only two cells

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.960
will show cytopathic effects

01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:37.960
and only two cells will be PCR positive.

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.440
And they can't culture from that.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.360
They can only sequence.

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.240
And then the way they overcome it

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.240
is they take the sequence that they find in their laboratory

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.360
and they convert it to a DNA molecule.

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.640
And the reason why this is important, Jerry,

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.440
is because they can make as much of this DNA as they want.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.040
They can make a truckload of it,

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.080
like a literal tanker truck

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.920
full of almost perfect copies of this consensus genome.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.800
And then because commercial products exist

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.640
like T7 RNA polymerase,

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.640
they can convert that DNA to a perfect copy of the genome.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:17.000
And that perfect copy of the genome

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.560
in that quantity, a truckload,

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.760
cannot exist in any bat or in any bat cave

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:27.000
or any community of animals

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.520
because those RNA molecules are by definition all different

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.040
because they've all been copied by RNA polymerase

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.600
and therefore none of them are the same.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.560
And so I can create a purity of RNA

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.520
using this cloning technique

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.520
that no matter what culturing techniques,

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.560
no matter how sick the animal is,

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.400
no matter how virulent the virus is,

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.440
by definition, none of the RNA molecules can be the same.

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:54.440
And this is the illusion that they have told us

01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.760
when if an RNA molecule goes

01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.320
in a million different directions on Earth,

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.440
but all of those RNA molecules just happen

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.360
to random walk to Delta

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.040
and then random walk to Amacron,

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.920
there are no evolutionary mechanisms inside

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.520
of an RNA molecule coded in lipid protein

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.840
to account for these directional moves.

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:19.880
It's just not possible

01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:23.600
because the fundamental randomness of this process

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.200
and it's this process that they most don't want us

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:29.960
to talk about because it undermines the whole concept

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.240
of it's still going, it's still going

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:34.760
because it can't be.

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.360
And it's much more likely the case

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.760
that if there is a real bonafide signal

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.880
that it's just a signal that was always there

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:47.040
and that's the best I can do for pencil drawing.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:52.040
But anyway, you're muted again, Jerry, sorry.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:00.120
That's unusual for me, I'm not usually muted.

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:04.160
At one stage you said they're getting close to it.

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.640
What was it?

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.840
Was it a call a depopulation?

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.160
No, you went down to say it was transhumanism

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.400
in our children, our grandchildren.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:17.320
I looked and they've come to the idea

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.200
in the conclusion that in effect

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.360
the vaccinations were about a call

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:28.120
or a depopulation effort

01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:32.040
rather than just totalitarian control.

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.480
Would you agree or disagree with that?

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:43.240
I mean, I hesitate to say that they would make any moves

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.240
to prevent that.

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.440
But I do think that there is a real multi-generational move

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.560
here with the idea of getting our children

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.600
to accept a different way of governance.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.880
And so I do think that this is a long move.

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.640
And so they're never going to convince us

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.960
that the vaccine schedule is good.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.040
They just need us to shut up long enough

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.720
so that the college kids accept it

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:07.880
and they give it to their kids.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.600
And so we're also in a very weird state right now, Jerry,

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:14.880
because it's very hard for us in this group

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:16.800
to know how far our message is going

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.800
because it often just echoes off of people

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.880
that we already know are following us.

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:24.080
And so it's very possible that we're reaching farther

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.240
and we're not allowed to see it.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:27.440
It's also very possible that we're not getting anywhere

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.600
and we're just running in a wheel.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:33.000
So I'm optimistic because this group expands

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.560
but I'm still very pessimistic

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.840
because we are up against a monster for sure.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:39.880
Thank you, Jerry.

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:40.880
You're very welcome.

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.720
Great help.

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:42.560
Thanks.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.360
You're welcome.

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.200
Thanks.

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.040
Thank you, Jerry.

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.760
Keep riding that motorbike around Ireland.

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.960
Wendy, you're next.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:54.200
Hi there.

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:55.600
Thanks so much for that presentation.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.840
I always love listening to you.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:02.840
My question, I'm very interested in the DNA contamination.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:08.720
And so what you're talking about with Kevin McCurnan,

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:11.320
I'm curious about the plasmid.

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:14.160
I'm curious about the DNA fragments

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.400
and the open reading frames.

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:22.760
So it's been published by Kevin McCurnan,

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.920
David Speaker and Jessica Rose.

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:29.720
They wrote a paper looking at the sequences in the plasmid

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:33.720
and it looks like there was a reverse open reading frame

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:38.720
that was also a gene that seems to be a spider silk gene.

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:43.080
And I'm curious about this because of the fact

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:45.880
that the embolomers have been finding these

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.760
weird slots in blood vessels.

01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:50.680
There's weird fibers that people are seeing

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.600
in blood samples in the microscope.

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:57.200
And there's also now coming about people

01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:02.200
that have weird clot kinds of things in their large intestine

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.040
that they're kind of grouping out

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:06.760
when they do parasitic cleanses

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.680
that look strangely like the embolomer clots.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:15.680
And it seems that there's silk proteins in those clots.

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:20.320
So I'm curious about your thoughts on that.

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.640
Are those DNA fragments, you know,

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:25.960
I know you said that any DNA getting in

02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.120
can be potentially bad.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.960
And especially if DNA fragments get in

02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.560
and interrupt other genes,

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.680
it could be contributing to the turbocancer stuff.

02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.600
But if pieces of these open reading frames

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.960
are getting in and making spider silk proteins,

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.120
I'm just curious about your thoughts on that.

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.760
Wow, I hadn't heard that before.

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:47.000
I have to look that up.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:56.160
I would be, I would be first very careful

02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:59.760
to fully rule out the possibility

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.600
that endothelial cells are being destroyed by neutrophils

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:06.240
and being cleaned up.

02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:07.480
And when they are cleaned up,

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.560
there is a process of fibrinogen being produced

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.040
or fibrin being produced.

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.080
I get those two mixed up,

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.920
which ones the breakdown and which ones the not.

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.760
But there is an enzyme that comes along

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.760
with neutrophil elastase that destroys these endothelial cells.

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.640
And in the process of doing that,

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:29.800
there are clotting factors that are produced,

02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.280
there are things that happen

02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:33.920
that can result in this micro clotting.

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.720
And it's not clear to me,

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:38.480
I don't know if this would be,

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.280
I assume be related to the stuff

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.960
that secret bacti has worked on

02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.880
and all these embalmers have worked on.

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.760
I just don't, I would caution you to realize

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.760
that the fibrinogen fibrin clotting cascade

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.320
that has been described by these people

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.960
has no special biology

02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.880
and it is just how antibodies and how clotting

02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.520
and how platelets and how this might cascade out of control.

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.680
And so adding a silk protein to that

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.560
could be potentially something that could be later debunked

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.160
or something that could be disproven.

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:15.560
When in reality, it's a criminal investigation.

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:17.920
We don't have to prove where these clots

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:20.440
are coming from in order to call it a crime.

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.240
And so I would always encourage you

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.840
not to get too deep into the minutia of the explanation.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:30.360
In this case, it's very enticing to think about that,

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:33.240
but I would say that SV40 as a sequence

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.040
might be more interesting than silk protein.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.800
Because again, if it's silk protein,

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:40.840
it should be very, very simple to prove it.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.400
The protein should be very obviously not fibrinogen

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.320
or not fibrin to fibrin base.

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:48.440
So if there's a serine.

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.040
So yeah, and apparently it is obviously no fibrin.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:53.560
So all of that has been looked at.

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.560
I appreciate all of those thoughts.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.080
So Kevin McKernan, and now that I know more

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:00.240
about your thoughts about him,

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.720
he has sequenced that reverse open reading frame

02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.240
in the plasmids that are contaminating the vaccines.

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:11.280
I can paste the paper that was published in the chat.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.120
Sure.

02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.720
And then you can read that paper.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:14.720
Sure, please do.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.720
It's cold.

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.400
The other thing that I would just talk about

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.720
while you're putting this in there

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.120
is that one of the things that I think is very much overlooked

02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.200
is what happens to the lipid nanoparticle

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.280
after it gets released in the endosome.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.480
So there's a very good presentation

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:37.480
by I believe a Spanish guy with the last name of Segella

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:39.680
or something where I've seen,

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.840
where he shows very definitively

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.360
that the chemical properties of the lipid nanoparticles,

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:48.720
the cationic lipids that are used to transport the RNA,

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:52.200
once they are internalized into the endosome

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.380
and they get into this lower pH of the endosome,

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:59.760
they change into very corrosive cationic lipids

02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.640
that can go around and essentially create

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.880
reactive oxygen species and destroy mitochondrial DNA

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.320
or even if they get into the nucleus,

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.840
they could destroy nuclear DNA.

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:13.880
This aspect of the delivery mechanism is completely ignored

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:16.200
because they don't want you to think about them

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:18.040
after they've delivered their RNA

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.920
when they change their chemical properties quite a bit

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.520
after reaching the pH of the cell internally.

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:26.720
And so that aspect of this is also something

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:30.360
that I think there's a concerted effort to hide.

02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.640
And so any discussion of relevance

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.320
with regard to the lipid nanoparticles

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.000
often obfuscated by somebody

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.680
who doesn't know what they're talking about.

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.200
And so this, I'm not saying that they're telling

02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.960
this silk protein story for that reason,

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:43.800
but I do think we have to be very careful

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.240
about latching on to these hyper-detailed explanations

02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.160
that we don't need.

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.640
Did you put that in the chat?

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.200
Yes, so I will find it in a second,

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:57.120
but I would really like you to look at the plasmid sequence

02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.280
and that reverse open reading frame silk protein.

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:05.720
And if that fragment can get into people,

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:10.720
why are they putting spider silk in people?

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:15.160
And maybe the next time you'll talk with that.

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:16.480
Well, hopefully I'll be able to tell you

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:19.120
exactly why it's crazy, but maybe not.

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:20.560
Okay, yeah, that'd be great.

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.520
Thanks, thank you, Wendy.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.680
Alberto, I'd love to see you.

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:30.320
JJ, thank you.

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:36.320
Two camps seem to be emerging on our side of the aisle

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:42.480
and the camps are the pro-vax people

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:46.240
but just not pro-this-vax.

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.240
And then the pure true anti-vax camp.

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:55.080
And to say that I think this jab is bad,

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:59.880
I think the whole all the history of jabs were bad.

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.560
And I think that's easy to see

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:07.680
when we're paying attention to what people are saying

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:08.760
because I've always said,

02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:13.120
beware of the person that wants to fix the formula

02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:18.120
or improve the formula for the future.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.760
So thank you for that for kind of slowly,

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:24.840
this is the layers are getting peeled back

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:29.480
and that's being revealed which camp people are in.

02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:34.240
The question that I had though was in yesterday's,

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:36.280
in your yesterday's podcast,

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.480
you kind of went into the details

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:42.560
about getting laid off for children's health defense

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.640
and I'm sorry to hear that.

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:50.800
You had said that there was a McCurnan did a podcast

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:55.240
with two CHD people and because of that,

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.800
you know, you slightly criticized or debated

02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:00.120
or something critiqued it,

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:02.240
but you got reprimanded for that

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:05.160
from the children's health defense people behind the scenes

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:09.040
and somehow that you feel may have caused your

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:12.320
layoff or something.

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:15.800
Do you know what the timeframe of that was?

02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:19.480
How do I find that video where McCurnan was?

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:21.280
I would have to look on my chat.

02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:25.200
So it was a little, it was a little wild before I did it,

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:30.200
but he had gone on Brian Hooker's podcast,

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:35.040
doctors and scientists and when he was on that podcast,

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.960
actually Mary Holland joined him.

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:40.360
And so what I did was watch that podcast in critique,

02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:44.280
what Kevin was saying and I pointed out that I thought

02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:48.520
that maybe Mary and Brian weren't really aware

02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:51.640
of what he was skipping or what he wasn't pointing out

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:55.040
and how much more there was to talk about.

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:57.280
And the way that I got reprimanded was that they just

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.400
didn't want me to cover that kind of thing.

02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.120
They didn't want me to redo podcasts.

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:03.680
So it wasn't necessarily that they didn't say

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.560
that Kevin's a good guy and you shouldn't pick on him.

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:10.560
They didn't want me to critique, to risk portraying

02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:14.840
some kind of, you know, not a uniform front for CHD.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:15.720
And I understand that.

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:18.000
I mean, I was working for them as a staff scientist

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.960
and then to go on my podcast and have the president

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.680
and the chief science officer on there.

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.680
And not necessarily, I don't think I said anything wrong,

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:30.040
but it would be very easy for someone outside

02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.000
of the organization to say, hey, it looks like they don't

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.960
agree on everything, what the hell's going on?

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.640
And so that's what I got reprimanded for.

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.680
I didn't want to say that Kevin was involved,

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:42.600
but it was how that started, let's say it like that.

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:46.280
Why don't put anybody on a pedestal

02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:49.400
and that goes for Bobby Kennedy.

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.000
I know you no longer work for him.

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:55.120
And hey, I might still vote for Bobby, you know,

02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.080
for the most part, I mean, I like him.

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:00.800
But I also know that he knows that bears doesn't publish

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.720
all legitimate reports received.

02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.440
And then I wonder like, why aren't you really

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:08.680
clamping down on that one?

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.520
But needless to say, I really appreciate that you,

02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.880
your search for the truth and, you know,

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.480
not being afraid to investigate under every rock.

02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:22.600
I appreciate you, JJ.

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.560
Thank you so much.

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.800
You're very welcome, Albert.

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.160
Thank you.

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.000
Thank you, Albert.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.480
Now everybody, we've got an interesting breaking story

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:33.480
relevant to what we're talking about.

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.480
And this just came in.

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.760
So JJ, very relevant to your comment on lawyers.

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.280
And here it is.

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:44.480
Justin Trudeau fails as justice prevails.

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:47.680
Federal court and candidate declares Prime Minister Trudeau

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.520
exit outside of his legal authority

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.560
when he took unreasonable constitutional measures

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:54.240
against the Canadian truckers.

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.200
So federal court in Canada has just

02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.600
ruled in favour of applicants who

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:00.320
filed an application against Trudeau

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.120
for unreasonably and unconstitutional measures.

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:06.960
So that's one of many cases that are happening.

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:10.800
And it's quite possible, JJ, that judge who's

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.720
shown some bravery at last.

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:16.600
His grandchildren may well have died suddenly.

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:17.400
You never know.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.240
But anyway, I just bring everyone's attention

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.400
and I want to sidetrack it.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:22.560
But there are, as Warner Mendenhall's

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.800
going to tell us in February, thousands,

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.200
hundreds of thousands of cases in the pipeline.

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.320
So it's not true to say that they're not happening.

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:36.320
But it's very true to say that most big law firms do not

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.040
want to attack the system because they get

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:41.400
the bulk of their income from the system.

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.360
So that's our challenge.

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.960
Albert, thank you for that.

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:48.460
Anders.

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:53.760
Yes, hello.

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:54.560
Thank you, JJ.

02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:58.840
It was wonderful to hear your presentation.

02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:02.320
I was fooled like a lot of people

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:05.360
to believe in the virus theory.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.720
I must say that after last year's

02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:14.800
intense investigations, I don't find any reason anymore

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.840
to believe in the virus theory.

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.120
And that it is a big risk for a lot of people

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:29.880
who are confused in that theory that this is correct science

02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:35.960
to present all of these modeling out of computer science

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:42.680
that there is so and so genetic, let's say, footprints

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:43.880
or what you claim.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.400
I think we need to go back to real science

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:53.360
and to go long back to the philosophical discussion, which

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.080
were going on for more than 100 years ago,

02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.320
about whether Lewis Pasteur was right or not.

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.880
But that is a mean comment that is connected to my own research.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.440
Which I would say conclusively come

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:17.160
to the final conclusion that the COVID so-called virus of 2020

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.560
was an invention and not the fact.

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:25.120
And there was mortality across the Western countries.

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.720
But that mortality was strictly connected to protocols

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:32.440
and to the launch of 5G.

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.800
So that is my general comment to it.

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:40.120
But let's say the question is, how can you all or those

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.800
who continue this, continue the virus theory against,

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:49.720
let's say, the postulates or Robert Koch and all the lack

02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.960
of evidence that there is such a thing like a virus?

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:56.360
That is my question.

02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.040
I would argue that there is plenty of evidence

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:03.720
in the literature that cells excrete small vesicles

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:07.040
with RNA and DNA in them.

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.200
I'm dispute.

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:08.720
OK.

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.960
And so I think that my main argument

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.960
is that they can make RNA and they can make a lot of it.

02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:19.960
They can make DNA and they can make a lot of it.

02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:23.200
And that means that some of the experiments

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.800
that they do in the literature are definitely possible.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:28.600
They can make enough DNA to put on a cell culture.

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:31.680
And then the cell culture will so psychopathic effects

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:33.600
and try to copy the DNA.

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.440
And then afterward, there might be more DNA or more RNA,

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.560
excuse me, than when you put it in the first time.

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:44.480
But it won't be the predicted amount and assortment of RNA

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.720
that the cartoon provides for.

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:49.440
And in fact, they don't need it to because they use

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.520
psychopathic effects to show the presence of a virus.

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.720
But they never then go farther than that.

02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:57.200
And so I would totally agree with you

02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:00.280
that viruses are likely a phenomenon that

02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.160
have been exaggerated both in fidelity and in significance.

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.840
But I would also argue that in place of that,

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:10.600
there are technologies that are sufficiently advanced

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.800
so that a DNA molecule or sequence could be planted anywhere

02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.880
and that RNA could be used to transfect someone

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:21.840
and make their cells express proteins.

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.160
And if that's the truth, which I'm sure it is,

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:27.520
because I've used these transfection agents in mice

02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:31.680
when I was an academician, a biologist in medical schools,

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.800
I used to do these experiments where I transfected mice.

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:38.880
And so I am confident that if they wanted to express

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.400
a protein in your lungs, they could do it.

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:44.800
If they wanted to express a protein in your skin,

02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.640
they could do it.

02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:48.120
And I'm sure that they could express a protein in your gut

02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:49.400
if they wanted to do it.

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:52.640
And I'm sure that if they put DNA into a sewer,

02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:55.240
they could use PCR to tell you they found it.

02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:58.720
And so all of these very standard methodologies

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.920
could be used to create the molecular biological signal

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:06.960
that someone with a high level of sophistication,

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:10.000
but also a very high level of specialization

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.560
would never be able to tell the difference

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.440
between BS and truth.

02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.760
And that is where we are.

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.560
And I do think that it's been going on for a long time,

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:20.960
probably since the AIDS virus was first characterized

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.480
and said to be in circulation.

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:25.240
And we're probably dealing with a scenario

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:29.120
where when they started to grow things in cell culture

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.320
and then inject them into people,

02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:36.240
there were problems because they couldn't detect

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:38.480
the kind of immune signals that were present

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.080
in these cell cultures.

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:42.560
And if there are immune signals that are

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:45.320
at the same size scale as viruses,

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:49.760
then it would be very easy for a controlled discussion

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.800
of this biology to result in a horrible misinterpretation

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.480
of a signal that is almost exclusively endogenous

02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:59.880
as opposed to being exclusively pathogenic,

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.080
which is what they would like us to believe.

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.400
Is that kind of an answer?

02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:06.240
Yeah?

02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:08.240
Thank you.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:09.400
Thank you, Anders.

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:10.360
Wolfgang, welcome.

02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.120
Loving to see you for those of you

02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:13.600
who don't know who he is, Stephen,

02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.880
has organized Wolfgang to speak just twice.

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:20.080
So far, I think, Wolfgang, twice or three times?

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:21.080
Twice.

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:22.280
Twice. Welcome.

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:23.760
Great to see you.

02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:25.120
Over to you.

02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:30.320
I came explicitly because I heard JJ some days ago

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.600
in the coronavirus, and I was very fascinated

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.920
about his knowledge and his interpretation

02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:38.640
of what he observed in the last years.

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:42.080
And I think I'm not a specialist

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:45.320
from molecular biology, but I observed

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.960
the whole business of vaccination industry for many years

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:52.080
as it was of a public health institution.

02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.680
And when in politics, too, about the patent laws

02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.600
and all this around how they tried to have formulas

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:05.320
where they could have claims to work with, to earn money with,

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.800
and they had their claims not only in the land,

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.040
they had them also in biology.

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.560
And they tried to shape their claims there

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.600
and to give them, give their claims certain meaning

02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:19.000
that they could produce because you could only get a patent

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.960
when you can use it for certain techniques

02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.440
you have to describe.

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.760
So this is working out such theories

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:30.000
that there are some molecular molecules.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.680
You could do something against with the certain technology.

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:38.880
This is the basis of getting a patent and earning money with it.

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.440
And I think it was, we are trapped for many, many years.

02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:48.240
I think much wrong, I think it started in the 50s or 60s already

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.240
when they were trying out the first vaccinations,

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:57.760
when they had the idea, the pharmaceutical industry got the idea,

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:03.120
that it's too little business only to deal with ill people.

02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.880
They wanted to sell something to healthy people.

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.240
The market is much, much, much bigger.

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:13.120
And this was a genius idea to tell people we can do something

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.120
with your immune system.

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:20.080
And I think this was a fantastic idea for them.

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.560
And they developed it more and more.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:25.680
And they went more and more in the granular fair.

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.120
They went to molecules and they went into the immune system.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:35.040
They invented stories about good immune system, bad immune system,

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:38.960
all such things, which have nothing to do with biology,

02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.120
which we can never understand.

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.560
And JJ, you said it last time it was great, I was fascinated.

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:53.760
They tried to just to describe the irreducible complexity of life.

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:56.240
And they picked out something of it.

02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.400
And they made narratives around it.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.000
And they had to sell their products and to get their patents.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.040
And now they, I think it's just trying

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.200
to open a new sphere of business.

02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:15.240
And they can only do it with a war of speed methodology.

02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:19.360
Because normally, we should need some time

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.520
to find out whether people get healthier or not,

02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:23.360
or whether they're really protected or not,

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.120
have a control group or whatever.

02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.680
It's a very, very long process.

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.920
And then when you find out such things,

02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:32.440
whether something is working or not,

02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:34.800
it's only statistical results.

02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.880
You don't know what happens on a certain person,

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.360
because this is the irreducible complexity of life

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.080
that we are all different.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.680
And so I think this business, what I observed in the last year,

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:50.680
is for my experience now, it is just

02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:57.040
that I don't advise people anymore to take any vaccine.

02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:58.960
And it goes much further.

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:02.280
Observed also the clinical studies they did.

02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:04.680
And above normal some sort of drugs

02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:07.120
and how they constructed their narratives there.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.840
They are constructing narratives everywhere.

02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:13.840
And I think if we want to change this,

02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:19.640
one very effective thing would be just to forbid patents

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:22.800
on such things, forbid patents on living,

02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:26.160
on everything that has to do with life,

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:30.680
and to forbid patents for drugs.

02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:34.160
And I think this will solve a lot of problems.

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.640
And I tried to work for it in politics.

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:41.160
And I experienced that there was certainly people coming to me

02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:44.640
and the lobby was coming, and they were really terrified

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:49.320
when I started to make such an initiative.

02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:52.360
So I felt that there was something very important

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:53.800
with the patent right.

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.360
So this is just what I want to say,

02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.200
and I want to thank you very much,

02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:03.960
because you're much more strict in your thoughts,

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:08.400
and you're much more, I got lost sometimes,

02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:12.920
I got lost at my time, got lost in molecules, too.

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:16.520
And I was distracted very often, too.

02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:19.120
And they made it very well, but the more they did it,

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:23.800
and the more we find out that, oh, again, you were trapped,

02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:27.360
again, you were mistreated, or you were cheated.

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:31.320
And so we learn that we are cheated.

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:34.200
And this is a very interesting process,

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.960
which made perhaps lead to some improvement

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:42.560
in living together in this inreducible society,

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:44.280
complex society.

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:45.200
Thank you very much.

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.320
I think it's a great comment.

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.760
I just want to follow up by saying

02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:49.040
you might not be aware of it,

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.720
but in the United States right before the pandemic,

02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:54.440
there was a Supreme Court decision,

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:58.960
which basically decided that all intellectual property

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:03.520
of monoclonal antibodies was based on bad science.

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:07.440
And they actually decided to say

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:09.600
that the intellectual property of antibodies

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.200
was based on a formula that had been repeated so often

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:15.040
that it had no relevance anymore.

02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.480
And one of the things they talked about

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:19.280
was that the claim of monoclonal antibodies

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:21.080
is that it's a single molecule.

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.280
When in reality, it's not a single molecule at all,

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.880
and depending on which animal produces,

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:30.080
it's going to be as many variations as possible,

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.800
the kinds of motifs that are created.

02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:35.760
And so they portrayed a level of fidelity in creation

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:39.400
that wasn't there, and the Supreme Court basically

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.440
took a whole field of intellectual property

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:46.960
that was the basis for a lot of pharmaceutical value,

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:48.960
pharmaceutical company value,

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:52.280
and made it very shaky ground right before the pandemic

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:55.840
as to whether or not you would even be able to patent

02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:58.040
an antibody in the traditional manner.

02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:59.640
And so one of the things,

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:01.000
this was actually all discovered

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.800
by a friend of mine, Mark Koolack, of a huge atomic life

02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.640
who just lost his YouTube channel yesterday

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:08.960
for a video that he put up.

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.720
But he found this antibody paradox

02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:15.600
being covered by a Yale Law School review

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:17.440
that was then several months later,

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:20.160
cited by the Supreme Court as the evidence

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:23.040
for the biology of monoclonal antibodies

02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.160
not supporting their general patents.

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:27.600
So this was a huge change that occurred

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.880
right before the pandemic, seemingly very convenient

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:33.760
so that no pharmaceutical companies would invest

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.440
in monoclonal antibodies,

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.240
but instead would convert to this new...

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:40.640
No, there are sites on first, though.

02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:44.200
I don't know whether you know, a physics professor,

02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:47.560
and he was telling when there are problems,

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:52.200
we have a narrative and we deduct from this narrative

02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:53.720
everything we do.

02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:55.400
We take some new narrative

02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:58.440
and we make it the basis of all the things we do.

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:00.200
And then we don't, when we don't go,

02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:04.200
when we cannot go further, we invent particles.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:06.040
And we discuss about the particles

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:08.720
and what we have learned all about the particles

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:12.240
and we can't go further, we invent particles of particles.

02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:15.680
And like this, it goes on until there is a new narrative.

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:18.120
And I think we are at the level now

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:19.800
that there will be a new narrative.

02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:21.200
And I hope so, you started it.

02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:22.200
Thank you very much.

02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.000
Okay, thank you Wolfgang.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.160
Okay, Stephen, we'll go for another 15 minutes.

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:28.000
We've got two questions

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.960
and there's Stephen for closing questions.

02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.600
We'll go for two and three quarter hours today.

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:33.600
JJ, are you okay for another 15 minutes?

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:34.600
I can probably do it.

02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:36.760
If I pass out...

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.600
Quick on the quick...

02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:39.760
If I fall over, you know, then it's what happens.

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.280
Yeah, correct.

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:42.640
Tom and Meicher and then Stephen

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.680
and we'll finish the two and three quarters.

02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.520
Gotcha.

02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:48.160
Can you hear me okay?

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:50.040
I can, wow, nice, Meic.

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.280
Okay.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:52.880
Oh, okay.

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.760
Yeah, so...

02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:56.480
Let's see if I got my question.

02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:58.000
Are you from Wisconsin?

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.040
Does that say you're a Wisconsin guy?

02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.720
Yeah, yeah, I am.

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:04.680
I grew up in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:06.520
That's where I was born.

02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.400
Right, and I was on the Mississippi

02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.520
when I grew up in La Crosse.

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:11.360
Okay, nice.

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:13.760
Now, early Michigan.

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.240
Yeah, so I had asked you this before

02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:19.960
and it's kind of a minor question,

02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.280
but this lateral...

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.720
These grocery store tests that are in cardboard boxes.

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:26.560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:27.640
Are those...

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:29.680
Yeah, are those lateral flow?

02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:32.880
And, well, yeah, I have, I have, I guess,

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.360
three or four questions, but that's a quick, easy one.

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:38.240
Are those lateral, I hope, are lateral flow

02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:42.760
and you talk about lateral flow fraud.

02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:44.440
So should I do all the questions?

02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:46.680
Should we do one by one or what's the best way?

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:47.840
No, I mean, it's fine.

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:48.680
You can just say it.

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.080
I know what you're asking about now.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.920
And I'm limited in my...

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.080
I haven't looked at the specifics

02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:57.240
of each of these products.

02:25:58.120 --> 02:25:59.720
There's a lot of them.

02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:02.080
And so what antibodies are present in them

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.640
and what they're specific for is specific for each product.

02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:07.360
So it's tricky to...

02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:11.840
It's pretty tricky to discern

02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:15.160
which of them would be, let's say, more reliable

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:16.920
or less reliable for the indication

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.240
of the presence of these proteins.

02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:19.240
So that's tricky, but go ahead.

02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:20.080
Just ask.

02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.440
Oh, so I assume, do they create an antibody?

02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:29.000
Are they detecting antibodies in general?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.400
They're not detecting antibodies

02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.400
in a lateral flow test.

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:32.960
I think you use your saliva, right?

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.960
And so they're detecting spike protein or N protein

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:38.240
and it's antibodies to those proteins

02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.800
that then move and then get bound

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:44.400
to a second protein that changes color.

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.520
And if I'm wrong about this,

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:50.280
then please don't let that undermine the rest of my biology

02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:51.920
that I taught because lateral flow tests

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:54.720
are kind of tricky with the antibody problem

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:56.720
because the specificity is...

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.120
So yeah, I love your train thing and everything,

02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:02.560
but this is what I'm up against

02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:05.080
with a lot of people on the other side.

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:07.760
It's like, oh, I tested positive for COVID again.

02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:12.080
This is like that eighth time I've had COVID, et cetera,

02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.360
and it's based on those tests,

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:15.920
but you don't need to respond to that.

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.240
So this is like a teaching kind of question.

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:22.680
It exposes all kinds of confusion that I have.

02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:26.040
And let's see.

02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:31.040
So it's the idea of, okay, the virus has a genome,

02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.040
and is that represented one-to-one by the mRNA

02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:41.440
and within that genome, how many genes are in it?

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:44.560
And is that another way of asking for how many proteins

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.120
does it code for?

02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.440
And then at the higher level,

02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.280
as you're kind of going up to hierarchy,

02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:55.280
there's a lot of different types of genes

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.840
that are going up to the higher level.

02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:00.160
So you're kind of going up to hierarchy.

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.840
You've got chromosomes, you've got the cell nucleus,

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.400
and then you have the entire human genome.

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:11.840
Could you kind of quickly touch on those concepts?

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:14.840
Sure, so in a viral genome,

02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.640
you expect a virus to have in a coronavirus 30-odd proteins

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.880
that are encoded in a single genome,

02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:23.520
and the genome would be one long RNA.

02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:24.360
That's the idea.

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.600
And our cellular genomes is one long,

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:32.200
double-stranded DNA molecule in theory for each chromosome.

02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:34.280
And so our genome is just gigantic,

02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.040
and instead of having n proteins,

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.480
we have our DNA organized into chromosomes

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:43.160
that is really DNA around histones and other proteins.

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:49.160
But a viral genome is supposed to contain all of the proteins

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:53.200
that are necessary so that when that RNA goes into the cell,

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.160
remember that if it's a positive strand RNA,

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:58.200
then it can go right through the ribosome.

02:28:58.200 --> 02:28:59.600
If it's a negative strand RNA,

02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.120
it needs to be turned into a positive strand RNA

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:04.520
before it can be converted into protein.

02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:07.840
So for negative strand viruses like flu and measles,

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:11.160
there has to be not only a genome in the viral,

02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:14.160
but there also has to be an enzyme set

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:16.920
that can copy the negative strand RNA

02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:20.600
into a positive strand one before flu proteins can be made.

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.920
Before measles protein and viruses can be made.

02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:26.400
So the coronavirus is an opposite kind of thing

02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:28.360
because it's positive stranded.

02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:31.440
So the first thing it has to do is go into your cells

02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:34.160
and translate itself into protein

02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:35.960
so that the proteins that are present

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:39.560
that copy it from positive to positive are there.

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:43.380
So that's the trick that I wonder if you caught it,

02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:46.000
but it's something that I find very frustrating

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:51.000
about the current model of the way that these viruses replicate,

02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:54.320
and it's part of that bothers me,

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:57.000
I gotta find the right slide here, apologize for this,

02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:02.240
is that in this model,

02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.960
oops, that should be here, and then yeah,

02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:10.240
in this model, this is the diagram

02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:12.280
where they show a coronavirus replicating,

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.080
the thing that has to happen, right?

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:17.360
This is a positive strand RNA genome

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.680
which can go right through the ribosome,

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:24.320
but you want a positive strand RNA in your viruses

02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:25.840
that go out of the cell.

02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:31.680
So you might presume that the positive strand RNA

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:34.240
has to be translated to a negative strand RNA

02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:36.520
and then the negative strand RNA gets transbagged

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:38.240
back to a positive strand RNA

02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:41.840
because that's how these double stranded molecules are copied, right?

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:45.640
They rely on the mirror image in order to make the copy,

02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:47.520
but this is a single strand RNA,

02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:48.560
so you don't have that.

02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:51.360
And interestingly, in this diagram,

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:54.160
it shows, if you can see my arrow,

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:58.000
it shows that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.560
is translating a positive genomic RNA

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:04.080
into another positive genomic RNA.

02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:08.560
I can't find a single paper that explains how that happens

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:10.280
or explains why that's so special

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:14.360
because the flu virus needs to change its RNA

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:16.640
in from negative to positive

02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:19.520
and then the positive needs to be copied back into a negative

02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:23.720
and packaged in with the enzymes required to be a full virus.

02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:24.920
So the flu virus...

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:29.200
Can I ask you, can I ask you,

02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:31.720
do you have any examples of positive...

02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:33.800
No, Tom, Tom, Tom, this is...

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:37.960
Oh, okay, no, then I'm gonna go to my last question,

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:40.240
which is kind of a bombshell thing.

02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:44.720
I had a friend in this group connect me with another friend

02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:49.520
who is that you've got an adversary out there

02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:51.080
and I just...

02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:54.480
I've only watched like three hours of him

02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:57.920
and could you comment on Kevin McCarran?

02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:59.440
Oh, sure.

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:03.080
Kevin McCarran is a guy who streamed with me

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:07.760
starting in the first week of March

02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:11.360
and we did a stream of about five hours long

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.520
every weekend for five weeks in a row

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:16.400
with another guy by the name of Paul Catrell,

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:18.320
who is a completely fake doctor

02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:20.160
who was promoted by George Webb

02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:23.080
for a very long time at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:27.080
And Kevin McCarran is a guy who when I first met him

02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:29.840
was very convinced that over a billion people would die

02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:32.120
and that everybody should be at home making masks

02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:35.360
and that we should stay home for 60 days instead of 20.

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:37.840
He was also very convinced that the spike protein

02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:40.800
was gained a function and that there would be a massive

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:45.680
influx of amyloidosis and spike protein induced prion disease

02:32:45.680 --> 02:32:49.600
and he was already convinced of this in March or April of 2020

02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:52.760
and he remains convinced of it now five years later.

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:57.680
He has done nothing but stream about the N word and Jews

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:00.120
and how the Jews are responsible

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.320
and he has done nothing but associate his own racist bigotry

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:06.680
with me and a couple other people

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:08.960
with the idea, I guess, of slandering us.

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:11.640
And the first time that I reviewed his work

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:14.920
was when he got in a shouting match with Mark Bailey

02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:17.760
and at that point, he already started calling me names

02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:21.080
and said I was a liar and I didn't know what I was talking about

02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:22.800
but he didn't really lose his mind

02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:24.800
until I started teaching about the clones

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:26.760
and then him and Charles Rixi

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.960
pretty much have gone full tilt,

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:33.800
giga-ohm spiral and all these other things.

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.680
There are hundreds of hours of videos of these guys

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:41.160
spending most of their time trying to say

02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:44.440
that I'm a bad guy and it's just absurd.

02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:47.120
It's laughable at this stage.

02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:52.120
Do you realize that Kevin McCarran came to Pittsburgh

02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:56.380
from Japan and tried to stay overnight in my house?

02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.800
This guy is more than a medler.

02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:01.560
It is, this is real.

02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:04.360
Like these people came to my house.

02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.880
They are being paid to keep the worst-case scenario alive.

02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:09.720
I assure you.

02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:16.080
And most importantly, he was involved in making it very hard

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.920
to decide, the idea that we were transfecting billions

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:24.520
of people, one of the most likely possibilities

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:26.400
would be misfolding of proteins

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.800
and potential generation of prion states.

02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:31.640
So imagine that they knew this was a possibility

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.360
and they had people like Kevin McCarran

02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:34.640
from the very beginning out there

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:36.560
in the darkest corners of the internet

02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:38.040
putting this nonsense out there

02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:39.720
so that when it finally did happen,

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.760
it wouldn't be very hard for them to confound it

02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:45.800
with the original gain of function virus.

02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:48.040
This guy's one of the worst characters out there,

02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:48.880
I assure you.

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.480
Oh my gosh, he makes me mad.

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.960
He really, really has been messing with my family

02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.320
for four straight years.

02:34:58.320 --> 02:34:59.160
Yep.

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:00.000
Thank you, JJ.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:00.840
Thanks, Tom.

02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:01.680
Make it.

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:04.360
Very briefly.

02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:05.840
Thank you so much, JJ.

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:06.680
Good novel.

02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:08.360
It must be very late there, huh?

02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:09.680
I mean, my goodness.

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:11.200
I'm putting the affords here.

02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:12.200
Okay.

02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:14.240
Your wife's from the Netherlands, isn't she?

02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:15.560
Netcloped, yep.

02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:16.640
Yeah.

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:18.000
Hillhoot, Hillhoot.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.200
Okay, I have a question.

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.080
I read the book of John of Robert Kennedy,

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:25.400
the Wuhan cover-up.

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.400
And there it says that you said it is on page 284.

02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:35.640
I know what she's going to read.

02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:40.640
A virus designed by a jean jockey on a keyboard, says Kui.

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.800
So, what do you think about it?

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:45.760
Is this correct or?

02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.520
At the time that he's quoting me,

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:49.880
that's exactly what I said,

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:53.240
but what I'm meaning is that they created a clone.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:54.960
So when you do it on a keyboard,

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:55.840
you make a clone.

02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:57.760
And this is, again,

02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:59.560
I don't know how to say it any other way,

02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.920
other than to say that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:05.280
wanted to write a book about a lab leak.

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:08.640
And it wasn't until very late

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.720
in my service of this book

02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:12.000
that I started to realize

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.120
that I was perpetuating the wrong narrative.

02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:15.680
And I did teach it to him.

02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:17.760
It is in the book in some places,

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.400
but there are quotes,

02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:22.960
including one where I think it's very late in the book

02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:26.400
where I say that oftentimes grand proposals

02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:28.480
are done before they are submitted.

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.080
And that was used to say

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.080
that maybe the diffuse proposal was done.

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:35.960
And I would argue with throwing myself under the bus

02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:39.160
to say that they went so far as to come to my house

02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:40.440
to convince me to say that.

02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:41.320
And they did.

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:42.760
They convinced me to believe that

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:45.240
for several months that I was wrong,

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:47.240
that the diffuse proposal might be right,

02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:49.320
and that I needed to think very carefully

02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:51.720
about whether I was putting people in danger.

02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:54.320
And this, when people come to your house,

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:55.800
when people call you on the phone,

02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:58.440
when people send you emails like this over and over

02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:00.320
for many, many, many years,

02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:03.000
it becomes very difficult to stick to your laurels

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.560
and say, no, I'm sure Mike Eden

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:06.800
and Wolfgang Wodarg are right.

02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:08.480
And these guys are full of baloney.

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:11.080
And that's really where we are.

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.680
And during the writing of that book,

02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:15.280
you can see the evolution of my thoughts

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:17.400
and at least I can in my notes.

02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:19.600
And it's just a question of,

02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:22.000
Bobby's ultimate objective was to make sure

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.880
that the mythology was captured.

02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:26.840
I don't think we are in a scenario

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:30.960
where Bobby couldn't come to understand this biology

02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:33.320
the way that we understand it

02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:35.320
and just don't necessarily think

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:36.600
that it's gonna be that easy.

02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:40.280
And I'm for sure that there are lots of forces out there

02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:42.800
that have made sure those books were written.

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:46.920
And it's just very hard.

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.040
I don't wanna say anybody's a bad guy

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.160
because I think so many people like myself

02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:55.520
were taken by the narrative and by the performances

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:59.840
and by the previous rumors and mythologies

02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:00.800
that we all grew up with.

02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:04.400
I gave my kids all their shots in 2022

02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.040
before we moved to the new school that they're at now.

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.640
And it was a week later that my wife and I sat down

02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:13.000
and watched Vaxxed and we cried for hours

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.800
because we realized, oh my God,

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:16.240
what in the hell have we been doing?

02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:18.960
We've been working for Bobby Kennedy for half a year.

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:21.360
We never bothered to watch the movie.

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:23.080
That's how stupid I am.

02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:24.920
So I don't want anybody to think I hate it

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:26.560
when I get introduced as a genius

02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:28.400
because I'm not a genius.

02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:31.120
I figured this out like everybody else

02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.360
that went crazy, figured it out.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.160
And only very few people were smart enough

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.400
to be ahead of this and I wasn't one of them.

02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:39.480
I definitely wasn't.

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:41.960
Yeah.

02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:42.800
Thank you.

02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:44.440
Thank you, make it look good to go.

02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:46.000
We're gonna move on.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.800
Thank you, great question.

02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:51.280
Now, JJ, just to just stay there, JJ,

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:53.640
we're gonna last couple of questions from Stephen,

02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:56.160
but one thing I want to remind everybody of,

02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:00.040
it's a crucial concept,

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:02.880
make all of us feel good about not being geniuses

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:06.480
because Albert Einstein said every one of us

02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.320
is born a genius,

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:11.640
but if you contemplate all human knowledge

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:14.520
between my hands, the smartest person on the planet,

02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:17.320
whoever you think that is knows this much,

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.800
each one of us knows a tiny little bit.

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:22.360
That's the point of these conversations.

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:26.880
So, JJ's very honorable of you to admit being stupid.

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:27.720
I'm stupid.

02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:32.720
In fact, the wonderful Anthony DeMello,

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:34.480
when he says this,

02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:37.240
it is wonderful book awareness.

02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:40.600
He says, when somebody says you're an idiot,

02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:42.000
agree with them.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.240
Each one of us, we are total idiots

02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:46.800
except for this tiny little bit.

02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:49.200
So, glory in your idiocy.

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.800
Now, last question, Stephen, are you there?

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:56.160
Last couple of questions, JJ, I will let you go.

02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:57.480
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:00.920
So, just to switch on the video.

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:04.720
So, JJ, I was kind of,

02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:07.080
I was going to ask you what happened at CHD

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:09.600
because it was completely mystifying to me,

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:15.080
hearing that you had lost your job at CHD

02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.080
on the 4th of January, I think you said.

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:18.120
Yeah.

02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:20.000
I couldn't think of any good reason

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.600
why they should choose now to get rid of you

02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:25.640
because as far as I can see,

02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:28.640
you are absolutely essential to understanding

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:29.760
what's going on.

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.160
But now it makes sense because I remember reading it,

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:36.440
but I like R.F.K. Jr.

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:38.440
I really like him.

02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.240
Remember R.F.K. Jr. is not at CHD anymore.

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:44.360
He had to break all ties with them

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:45.600
in order to run for president.

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.640
So, he has no influence, and he actually was not,

02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:50.680
he was not involved in me being hired.

02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:54.520
I actually got hired because some of the writing team

02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:57.280
from the book also worked at CHD

02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:59.520
and advocated for me to be hired by Brian.

02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:03.360
So, it's absolutely nothing to do with Bobby.

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:05.560
I know that for sure because I actually called him

02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:08.080
when I got laid off because I was so sad.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.040
And what did he say?

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:12.720
Well, he said he couldn't do anything about it,

02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:14.520
he had nothing to do with me being hired

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:16.240
because he had already left the organization.

02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:17.640
They call him chairman and leave,

02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:19.760
but that's just a moniker that means nothing.

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:22.120
He's nothing to CHD can't be.

02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:23.720
They can't talk to him.

02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:24.800
They call him what?

02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:26.240
A chairman on leave.

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:27.960
All right, yeah.

02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:29.320
But is he going back there?

02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:32.680
Well, I doubt, I don't know, yeah, I don't know,

02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:35.200
but he can't be a part of the organization now.

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:37.680
He is all contact has to be broken

02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:39.440
by definition in American law.

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.880
So, that tells me that it's quite possible

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:45.240
that he would have come to agree

02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:49.760
because I was mystified when I heard about three months ago,

02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.560
maybe I can't quite remember that he was going to write a book

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:55.440
about all the gain of function stuff.

02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.440
And I thought, no, no, don't do that.

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:03.000
That's part of getting everybody into the narrative,

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.440
discussing the gain of function

02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:06.440
and how terrible it is.

02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.240
And so I like David Martin a lot,

02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:15.320
but I don't understand why he's fallen through it either.

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.720
And anyway, point is that it now makes sense

02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:25.360
what happened to you at CHD in my mind anyway,

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:26.760
that you are actually saying,

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:30.320
well, actually don't believe this gain of function stuff.

02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:32.560
It's playing into the narrative.

02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:35.800
They want you to believe that it's all about fear.

02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:39.320
And it generated fear, whether they could do it or not,

02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:40.480
and they didn't need to do it.

02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:42.480
So that's very important to understand.

02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:45.800
So taking it so seriously that you write a whole book about it,

02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:49.040
well, yeah, I remember thinking at the time,

02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:50.960
should I email him?

02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:53.440
And what, say, but I thought,

02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:55.080
he's got so many people around him,

02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:56.440
he probably wouldn't take any notice,

02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:58.520
so no point in wasting their time.

02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:00.520
So, but I did think about it.

02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:02.840
And maybe you and I could go to him

02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:05.760
and maybe Wolfgang too might be prepared to do it.

02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.960
I'm trying to work on a brief that describes this biology in text

02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:12.920
and has some citations and things.

02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:16.200
I think in the next week or week and a half, it will be done.

02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:18.400
And he will be one of the people that received it.

02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:19.280
So look at him in the long run.

02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:20.280
Oh, I don't know why not.

02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:22.080
CHD in the long run.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:23.520
If he's got it wrong, you know?

02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:25.680
Oh, no, that's right. That's right. I agree.

02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:29.240
So if you write the whole book about gain of function research

02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:31.800
and goes down the round ball route, you know,

02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:34.720
I just think he's going to look at fooling 10 years time.

02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.640
And so we need to warn him off and we're not warning him off,

02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:40.640
but suggest that, you know,

02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:43.120
there are dangers in going down that route

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:46.040
because I really think that the whole thing was used

02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:47.600
just to generate fear.

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:49.000
Well, he's a he's a lawyer.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.720
He's a lawyer, so he could very easily do what I've done

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:52.960
and just say, I didn't get it.

02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:54.320
And now I get it.

02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.520
He could just say it. It's very easy.

02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:57.840
I mean, it's harder.

02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:00.040
It's harder for somebody like me to do it than a lawyer.

02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:01.560
I mean, why not?

02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:04.960
Well, whether whether RFK Junior becomes the president or not,

02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:06.960
he's got a huge following around the world.

02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:08.040
Yes, I agree. I agree.

02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:11.040
And so it's important for him to know it whether or not I agree.

02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:11.880
Absolutely.

02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:17.320
So maybe Wolfgang would like to join us because he he's got incredible insights to

02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:20.480
and actually Wolfgang, you are a virologist, aren't you?

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:21.920
Oh, no, we're stopping.

02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:23.400
We're not having a conversation there.

02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:26.880
That's another statement.

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:30.120
Another question to you, JJ, is do you want to write a book

02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.080
because I know someone who's a publisher who who's very interested.

02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:36.320
He can't couldn't be on tonight's call.

02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.160
Sure. Put me in touch with him.

02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:41.800
I mean, I've found a lot of people that are interested in me writing a chapter or two,

02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:44.200
but then they just ask me for the chapter right away.

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:46.080
And so it's hard for me to.

02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:47.760
But yes, I would be in theory.

02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:49.840
I'm already writing for a very long time.

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.840
I just don't publish it yet because I I'm not a very fast writer and I'm very anal.

02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:58.560
So it's it's good and he can please

02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:02.800
even get the book written for you if you know you dictated or you could have it.

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:06.000
Well, don't don't tease me with those things.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.720
Just put me in touch. It would be great.

02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:08.440
I will do. Yeah.

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:10.600
And Wolfgang, the same question to you.

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.280
Would you would you like to write a book or not?

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:15.680
Well, would Wolfgang write a book with me?

02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:17.760
We could write a book together.

02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:20.920
Yes, yes, I would love it.

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:21.920
That's what we do.

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:23.840
Well, set it up set it up, Stephen.

02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:25.120
We're going. OK.

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:34.600
Wolfgang and JJ, you are you are a disgrace in demonstrating that you are not drinking

02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:38.560
enough water because for you to sit there for three hours without going to the toilet

02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:41.240
is very. Yeah, yeah, but you haven't made the toilet.

02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:43.000
So you're clearly not drinking enough water.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.440
Oh, I have to go. Don't worry.

02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:46.280
Yeah, good. All right.

02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:47.600
You have to go. Everybody big.

02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:50.040
Thank you to JJ. Right.

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:52.800
Work. Thank you so much.

02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.680
Stephen, thank you for organizing everybody.

02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:56.440
We're going. We're way over time.

02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:01.440
Tom Rodman's video group, the link is in the chat and we'll see you on Sunday,

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.360
Monday, depending on what part of the planet you're on.

02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:04.120
Thanks, JJ.

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.520
Thank you very much, Stephen.

02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:07.600
Bye bye.

02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:08.760
Wow.

02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:10.280
Holy shit.

02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:11.800
Holy shit.

02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:13.800
Holy shit.

02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:14.800
Holy shit.

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:24.800
Holy shit.

02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:53.800
Holy shit.

02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:54.800
Holy shit.

02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:55.800
Holy shit.

02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:56.800
Holy shit.

02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:57.800
Holy shit.

02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.800
Holy shit.

02:46:58.800 --> 02:46:59.800
Holy shit.

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:00.800
Holy shit.

02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:01.800
Holy shit.

02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:02.800
Holy shit.

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:03.800
Holy shit.

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:04.800
Holy shit.

02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:05.800
Holy shit.

02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:06.800
Holy shit.
