00:13.063 --> 00:16.386
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

00:16.606 --> 00:17.067
It can't.

00:17.687 --> 00:21.430
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

00:21.450 --> 00:26.454
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

00:28.627 --> 00:31.949
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

00:32.169 --> 00:32.629
It can't.

00:33.249 --> 00:36.991
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

00:37.011 --> 00:42.033
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

00:42.053 --> 00:47.556
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

00:47.776 --> 00:48.236
It can't.

00:48.857 --> 00:52.598
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

00:52.619 --> 00:57.641
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

00:59.651 --> 01:00.151
actually J.J.

01:00.191 --> 01:06.796
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:49.881 --> 02:06.574
Well, the pizza and the pizza, oh, they are awesome.

02:06.614 --> 02:10.177
They are the best.

02:30.765 --> 02:36.571
We're talking about the China Grove.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.252
China Grove.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.501
But every day there's a new thing coming.

02:47.761 --> 02:50.023
The ways of the oriental view.

02:51.064 --> 02:53.907
The sheriff and his buddies with a samurai sword.

02:53.927 --> 02:55.949
You can even hear the music.

04:05.509 --> 04:05.630
you

04:22.661 --> 04:23.801
Testing.

04:23.901 --> 04:25.102
Good evening.

04:25.142 --> 04:25.502
Hello.

04:25.522 --> 04:26.562
I think it's working.

04:26.862 --> 04:27.422
Okay.

04:27.482 --> 04:29.703
Now I just need to make this transition correctly.

04:30.363 --> 04:32.444
I should load this one up first.

04:33.244 --> 04:36.665
Then I should hit this button followed by that button and that button.

04:37.145 --> 04:38.666
And then I can say, good evening.

04:38.726 --> 04:39.526
Welcome to the show.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.926
This is GigaOM Biological.

04:40.946 --> 04:41.907
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

04:41.947 --> 04:46.368
I come to you live when I can from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

04:46.888 --> 04:48.108
I'm back from the gym.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.989
I'm a little bit relaxed.

04:50.809 --> 04:52.490
And also a little bit fired up.

04:52.530 --> 05:00.976
I've had a long show in the waiting for a long time, but sometimes you get this gut feeling that it's not quite the right time to stream.

05:01.036 --> 05:05.739
In the last couple of days I've just had my doubts about what I was going to say and how I was going to say it.

05:06.599 --> 05:11.321
what I was going to try and claim I knew, and that doubt kept me away.

05:12.081 --> 05:13.601
Picking a song kept me in a way.

05:13.641 --> 05:16.682
Before you know it, it's Wednesday and it's in the evening today.

05:17.243 --> 05:23.745
It is 6 23 p.m on the 8th of October 2025 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.046
United States of America on earth.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.587
I assume that the United States of America is going to be a

05:31.849 --> 05:36.255
a nation, a country that exists for many generations to come.

05:36.335 --> 05:44.386
And in that sense, I'd like to say the name of my country out loud, not assuming, but with hope and

05:46.789 --> 05:48.450
and projection, if you will.

05:49.210 --> 05:53.773
So they're interesting feelings that you can have sometimes.

05:54.573 --> 05:58.615
And I just didn't think that the Right Now Show was right now, but today it is.

05:59.516 --> 06:02.918
I got a little bit from Doug and a little bit from Barry.

06:02.978 --> 06:08.521
Barry, I think you'll know, is this new editor of CBS News, Barry Weiss.

06:09.681 --> 06:16.746
just a meteoric rise, having comparisons to the Count of Monte Cristo and also to Galileo.

06:17.507 --> 06:29.215
She's really somebody to be envied, to be admired, and it's quite spectacular really where we are because people like her can go from relatively

06:29.775 --> 06:34.677
you know, obscurity to really big players on the scene.

06:35.558 --> 06:36.578
So it's really exciting.

06:36.638 --> 06:53.526
I think GigaOM Biological, I think Housatonic Live, I think even the Liberty Perspective has a chance of going mainstream, going viral, beating the algorithms, and really succeeding at getting our truth, our version of the truth out there.

06:56.676 --> 07:01.419
Sorry, that's completely not gonna happen, but we're still gonna talk about it anyway.

07:01.439 --> 07:06.922
Hey, new rule admission would be, what's his name?

07:08.202 --> 07:09.983
Why am I drawing a blank on him now?

07:10.064 --> 07:10.644
Bill Maher.

07:11.644 --> 07:19.449
And it's an interesting sort of, I just wanna step back again and keep reminding you that this cast has kind of filled itself in.

07:20.709 --> 07:43.680
Once the connection was made a few weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago with regard to the ambassador to India connected to the Clintons and to nuclear deals and Nevada and I don't know what else, did a podcast with Piper Stover, this early meddler of mine back in 2020 and 2021.

07:43.740 --> 07:44.760
And then this weird connection

07:50.224 --> 07:57.665
between Kathy Griffin and her bloody head of Donald Trump and Snoop Dogg, which

07:58.783 --> 08:02.584
You know, if you pulled those names out of a hat, it would seem ridiculous, but we didn't.

08:02.705 --> 08:07.546
Mark and I were having a spontaneous conversation on the phone about one of them.

08:08.187 --> 08:14.309
And then I reminded him of another celebrity that had done a similar thing.

08:14.349 --> 08:19.251
And I believe with 99% certainty, we were talking about Kathy Griffin.

08:19.751 --> 08:26.094
And then I said, well, don't forget that Snoop Dogg also had that music video where he had the pistol with the flag that came out that said, bang.

08:27.316 --> 08:37.559
And with a few short, you know, I mean, given Mark Kulak's Google foo is probably better than most average Googlers.

08:38.599 --> 08:41.140
He knows how to use, you know, search terms well.

08:42.640 --> 08:52.743
And he found quite a array of connections that took us all the way back to the man show with Jimmy Kimmel and Joe Rogan.

08:53.563 --> 08:57.006
And a guy by the name of Doug Stanhope, actually, who's the other Doug there.

08:57.426 --> 08:59.607
And then finally, the longest con, can you see it?

08:59.647 --> 09:01.489
I'm just gonna still try and show it to you.

09:02.609 --> 09:13.096
Exactly what I said or predicted would happen with regard to Professor Dave and Dan Wilson, Pierre Kory, Steve Kirsch.

09:14.237 --> 09:18.060
Pierre Kory and Steve Kirsch are being made fun of, made fools of,

09:18.980 --> 09:35.089
Several orders of magnitude more people are seeing that than could have possibly seen Steve Kersh and Pierre Kory win in any edited context in that debate, which was of course Pangburn's anti-RFK tour.

09:35.610 --> 09:42.894
So it's very confusing how it is that Pierre Kory and Steve Kersh found themselves on stage in the first place.

09:43.274 --> 09:47.797
It's even more confusing how poorly they did simply because

09:48.317 --> 09:57.065
They seemed like they just didn't prepare even though they were exchanging papers as if it was going to be some kind of journal club debate.

09:58.166 --> 10:07.354
And then they fell flat on their face for an hour and a half and now these two YouTubers, Dan Wilson and Dave Farina,

10:08.689 --> 10:18.312
with, you know, Dave has like four million followers, are spreading the word of these charlatans that are behind RFK Jr.

10:18.832 --> 10:31.736
And of course they're reaching millions more people on YouTube and on all the other social media platforms than Steve Kirsch or Pierre Kory could ever hope, even if all of their followers, you know, shared it with everybody that they know.

10:33.396 --> 10:36.517
And so the trap is closing now and

10:37.728 --> 10:53.340
the conservative movement in the right that has been artificially assembled basically by Steve Bannon and a network of clowns, this is about to be discredited in the minds of the majority of Americans.

10:53.420 --> 10:59.805
Now, you can still watch Fox News and I'll warn you, you can still watch Fox News and they'll tell you that it's 40%, 40% and 20% undecided.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.738
That's not true at all.

11:07.699 --> 11:13.623
By my best estimates, the people that still think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:13.683 --> 11:20.168
is going to do something good and Donald Trump is going to do something good and it's better that we have them in the White House than anybody else,

11:21.192 --> 11:27.197
is really waning toward 30%, maybe even 25%.

11:27.257 --> 11:30.540
And so you are in a minority.

11:30.860 --> 11:38.566
And it is a minority that is going to decrease very, I mean, shrink very, very fast, I think.

11:40.228 --> 11:44.171
With the exception of the fact, of course, that, what do we have here?

11:45.472 --> 11:45.893
Oh, geez.

11:47.365 --> 11:53.729
With the exception of the fact, of course, that the consensus is not being shown to them.

11:53.849 --> 12:05.397
They are being shown numbers which suggest that it's like a 50-50 divide, just like the support for Trump or the support for any particular poll question.

12:06.437 --> 12:08.799
And so by careful orchestration,

12:10.157 --> 12:20.259
America has a schism in it right now, but the schism is perceived by the minority as being roughly 50-50 and by the majority as a majority.

12:21.659 --> 12:28.540
And this is a very dangerous place to be because 50-50 makes both sides feel very comfortable.

12:28.560 --> 12:34.061
A majority makes one side feel very comfortable.

12:34.261 --> 12:38.922
And if the other side doesn't understand that, then it makes the other side very, very vulnerable.

12:40.700 --> 12:44.541
It's like a socioeconomic judo right now.

12:44.701 --> 13:04.346
And the conservative, false conservative right in America that is being propped up now as the right, the conservative right, or the Christian right, or maybe because Barry Weiss is now also a right-wing news source, right-wing conservative, even though she's a Jewish lesbian.

13:05.166 --> 13:26.342
um it's so confusing because the whole system is designed to be that way it's a long con and we've finally gotten to the end of it where the scramble is complete and now they need to to the control demolition is starting and that's why you see things like like uh

13:27.833 --> 13:32.015
like Barry Weiss by being promoted to this insane level.

13:32.055 --> 13:44.080
I mean, it's just as silly as promoting somebody as obscure and meaningless in the scientific community and in biology in general as Jay Bhattacharya to NIH director.

13:44.460 --> 13:49.402
He's following in the footsteps of somebody that helped guide the Human Genome Project for a decade.

13:49.822 --> 13:56.845
It's absurd to think that he has any of the requisite knowledge or vision to sit in that chair and run that office.

13:58.294 --> 14:04.078
Just like it's ridiculous that Barry Weiss could be editor of CBS News.

14:04.138 --> 14:05.159
Like that's absurd.

14:05.860 --> 14:14.046
She doesn't have the requisite experience in life to even make an attempt at managing a restaurant that was already successful when she walked in the door.

14:15.643 --> 14:22.685
Like this is a, this is a big time illusion that's being forced upon America and forced upon the world.

14:23.125 --> 14:26.625
The world's got to scratch their head and wonder what's going on as well.

14:27.025 --> 14:37.688
And so because these are questions that everybody is going to be forced to ask just by the circumstances alone, what the hell's going on in America?

14:38.528 --> 14:40.248
What the hell's going on at CBS?

14:40.308 --> 14:42.769
What are they thinking by putting this person there?

14:44.636 --> 14:47.697
You see, the questions that they ask are scripted.

14:47.938 --> 14:53.881
She is put there because it's part of the script to blame the people that people are going to blame.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.422
And that's the magic of this.

14:57.462 --> 15:00.044
And so the longest con is coming to a crescendo.

15:00.084 --> 15:04.706
And if you can see it, it's very, very wonderful and malevolent and obvious.

15:04.766 --> 15:07.047
And if you can't see it, it's terrifying.

15:08.777 --> 15:21.463
It seems like somehow or another a small strip of dirt in the Middle East and the people that sell falafel on it are controlling the world with sex and pictures of sex and little kids, I guess, or something.

15:22.423 --> 15:23.404
It's just not happening.

15:23.824 --> 15:25.365
It's not happening.

15:26.309 --> 15:29.532
And we can break that spell if we want to.

15:29.632 --> 15:31.954
And I definitely, definitely want to.

15:32.014 --> 15:32.915
So thanks for being here.

15:32.935 --> 15:34.636
I got to get going here.

15:34.676 --> 15:35.417
We got to get moving.

15:35.437 --> 15:39.680
This is going to be a long, long, long, long, long, long stream.

15:39.700 --> 15:40.281
What is this?

15:40.341 --> 15:41.222
That's not coffee.

15:42.143 --> 15:42.703
Oh man.

15:42.723 --> 15:43.764
Okay.

15:43.884 --> 15:44.364
That's fine.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.718
A condition that we will not call autism.

15:54.879 --> 15:56.421
I don't like the word autism.

15:57.322 --> 15:58.364
He was vaccine damaged.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.147
He was neurologically damaged.

16:00.908 --> 16:03.592
A condition that we will not call autism.

16:03.752 --> 16:05.295
I don't like the word autism.

16:06.196 --> 16:07.218
He was vaccine damaged.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.924
A condition that we will not call autism.

16:12.044 --> 16:13.605
I don't like the word autism.

16:14.485 --> 16:15.546
He was vaccine damaged.

16:15.906 --> 16:17.327
He was neurologically damaged.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.789
A condition that we will not call autism.

16:20.929 --> 16:22.550
I don't like the word autism.

16:23.451 --> 16:24.492
He was vaccine damaged.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.194
I think truth is good for kids.

16:29.635 --> 16:33.397
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.558
We want everybody to feel good.

16:35.699 --> 16:37.660
That's not the way life is.

16:45.285 --> 16:55.074
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.177
It's measles plus.

16:58.297 --> 17:03.802
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

17:04.102 --> 17:06.064
It's just a big hassle in the end.

17:09.195 --> 17:22.401
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

17:22.461 --> 17:24.962
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

17:51.510 --> 17:52.791
Let's get to something.

17:54.712 --> 17:56.653
Now that we've had enough time,

17:57.679 --> 18:03.222
to put both in the rear view mirror and judge without emotion.

18:05.144 --> 18:09.666
What did you like better, COVID or 9-11?

18:13.088 --> 18:16.230
You can only pick one to do over again.

18:16.250 --> 18:21.173
Like, which was more fun for you?

18:21.193 --> 18:24.315
There's arguments to be made on both sides.

18:28.740 --> 18:33.969
I got more material out of 9-11, so you could say that 9-11's funnier.

18:36.752 --> 18:39.874
But which did you really enjoy more?

18:39.894 --> 18:41.415
9-11 was more exciting.

18:42.195 --> 18:44.977
And I needed excitement at that point in my life.

18:45.677 --> 18:49.220
I needed the thrill where COVID was more relaxing.

18:49.820 --> 18:57.825
The most beautiful sabbatical of lay back and have every reason in the world to tell people to fuck off and don't come to my door.

18:57.865 --> 19:04.329
And you could have them both over again, yeah, but you could only pick one.

19:06.223 --> 19:08.844
COVID, uh, no good footage.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.644
9-11 had way better footage.

19:14.365 --> 19:18.206
You can still watch 9-11 if it's on anyway.

19:18.266 --> 19:23.947
You're not going to turn the channel right there and go, no!

19:24.807 --> 19:28.948
I'll sit through this till the fucking dust blows down Wall Street.

19:31.849 --> 19:33.172
I don't think it's that funny.

19:33.232 --> 19:37.683
There are some people in the audience that are laughing like crazy and I don't think it's that funny.

19:38.404 --> 19:41.471
Just consider the possibility that this...

19:42.395 --> 19:50.878
is so dark that they would put people with stupid laughs in the audience for this particular special.

19:51.559 --> 19:53.560
For this particular bit.

19:54.260 --> 20:00.022
Because this particular bit needed people to think that everybody thought it was funny to laugh along.

20:00.082 --> 20:02.363
You know, the illusion of consensus.

20:02.423 --> 20:03.824
Just follow along a little bit.

20:07.565 --> 20:09.186
Aw, come on now, don't already

20:15.769 --> 20:16.810
Come on.

20:19.692 --> 20:23.214
It's like Shawshank Redemption or Groundhog's Day.

20:23.254 --> 20:26.296
If it's on anyway, I'm gonna sit through till the end.

20:26.356 --> 20:27.157
It's seasonal.

20:28.037 --> 20:29.659
Planes, trains, and automobiles.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.238
No good COVID footage.

20:32.318 --> 20:37.282
No one was leaping to their death out of a 90-story building to get away from a virus.

20:38.142 --> 20:41.205
COVID boring, COVID boring.

20:42.105 --> 20:46.589
More likely you lost someone to COVID than you did 9-11, obviously.

20:46.709 --> 20:52.873
But if you did lose someone to COVID, probably someone you were tired of having to visit at that home.

20:56.914 --> 21:01.557
You gotta show up and put in some face time to stay in the will.

21:01.937 --> 21:04.819
You know, hey Nana, how's our nesting?

21:04.839 --> 21:05.959
Hold it up.

21:11.123 --> 21:16.306
I don't like the way that, I don't like the way that COVID

21:17.373 --> 21:19.775
Normalized germophobia.

21:20.035 --> 21:40.872
I've always hated fucking hand sanitizer people have made me crazy my okay, so here's here's the the the The the 5g warfare here because he's gonna think he's pulling a trick here he you think that he's gonna be against all the masks and and

21:41.957 --> 21:56.805
hand sanitizers and stuff but no this is about to be a joke about how being around him should not only make you feel like that but it should make you feel even more scared for your health because of how dirty he is so it's a really

21:57.905 --> 21:59.786
It's a really malevolent script.

21:59.826 --> 22:06.489
This isn't funny, especially if you see it as a national security scripted bit.

22:06.849 --> 22:13.952
My whole adult life, because I've been exhibiting symptoms of COVID for over 40 years.

22:17.312 --> 22:19.594
I've been a fucking chain smoker my whole life.

22:19.714 --> 22:25.818
So anytime I was half coughing and I saw someone running for the Purell, I assume it's me.

22:25.838 --> 22:29.620
I don't hate you as a germaphobe, as a person.

22:29.680 --> 22:34.504
I just don't want to be in the same room with you the same way you're uncomfortable being with me.

22:34.884 --> 22:36.545
Sneezy, coughy, hacky.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.907
And not even just the smoker thing.

22:39.007 --> 22:40.468
I'm a disgusting person.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.817
I have no sense of personal hygiene whatsoever.

22:44.957 --> 22:49.788
I don't, I realized during COVID, I don't wash my hands ever.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.048
Literally, for no reason.

22:53.088 --> 23:11.442
If I was eating like buffalo wings with ranch and sauce and I fell off my bar stool onto a dirty carpet with lint and hair and stuff in my... I would still probably go like this first before I went all the way to wash my hands.

23:11.522 --> 23:12.943
I'm fucking disgusting.

23:12.963 --> 23:15.465
I let my cat lick my teeth.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.438
Because he loves to do it.

23:19.518 --> 23:25.164
My cat Meatwig is this giant cat and he loves to lick your teeth.

23:25.204 --> 23:30.669
He gets right in and does grout work between the tooth and gum and I think it's funny.

23:31.029 --> 23:33.331
And a lot of people bum out when you do that.

23:33.872 --> 23:37.595
It's football Sunday and you're double dipping your fucking nacho.

23:37.635 --> 23:41.319
You just let the cat eat your mouth and you're double dipping?

23:41.439 --> 23:43.241
Yes, I don't think about it.

23:44.861 --> 23:49.625
I fucking carry my own straws, as you probably know, because I have fucking plastic straws.

23:49.645 --> 23:53.708
I always have a pocket full, because I won't put a paper straw in a proper drink.

23:54.008 --> 23:57.031
But I do recycle, because I'm fucking eco-friendly.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.234
These are the same straws.

24:01.855 --> 24:02.775
This is how I clean them.

24:02.815 --> 24:02.976
I go.

24:04.443 --> 24:18.828
and I'd put it right back in the filthy pocket of a thrift store jacket that was probably recently exhumed from your grandfather's grave by tweakers looking for fucking valuables.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.841
And I would put this in your drink.

24:22.901 --> 24:28.747
If you came to my house, I would go right, yeah, I would put it right in your drink and never consider it.

24:28.807 --> 24:31.870
I'm wearing like six day old socks right now.

24:31.890 --> 24:37.415
These socks I was wearing in Tucson and they're here now and they never leave my feet.

24:42.631 --> 24:45.093
Okay, I am gonna be able to sell you on that.

24:45.173 --> 24:48.015
I am gonna be able to sell you on why I played that.

24:48.915 --> 24:51.877
And I do really think that intramuscular injection is dumb.

24:51.917 --> 24:58.021
I'm dang sure that RNA cannot pandemic, that transfection is a crime, and that autism is a myth.

24:58.622 --> 25:03.525
And I think GigaOM Biological is one of the few places on the internet that's trying to tackle these ideas.

25:03.945 --> 25:05.506
We're part of the independent bright web.

25:06.427 --> 25:09.489
Get off social media means get off social media.

25:10.370 --> 25:11.710
You might think that, you know,

25:12.791 --> 25:33.711
Jonathan Couey is still on social media on X and all I do on X is tell people what they're not seeing and tell people what they're not doing and try to subvert that in some way but I can promise everybody that's listening to this that's on a timer and as far as being on other social media that's not me anybody

25:34.372 --> 25:43.194
that sees a Jonathan with an J-O-H-N on Facebook, for example, that's not mine.

25:43.214 --> 25:46.534
That's somebody else, because that's how they do it.

25:47.234 --> 26:00.597
You've got to get off of social media and build your own website, build your own peer tube, your own soapbox instance, just like Trump did with True Social, just like the Democrats or somebody did with Blue Sky.

26:02.117 --> 26:03.237
Thank you very much for being here.

26:03.318 --> 26:04.318
Thanks for joining me.

26:05.078 --> 26:13.681
I know that I'm usually on in the morning around 11 Eastern Standard Time, but this evening I'm on in the evening.

26:13.781 --> 26:19.884
And because you do not understand, that's why mice are gonna die.

26:19.944 --> 26:22.185
That's why people are gonna get trapped.

26:22.225 --> 26:24.185
They don't understand what we're dealing with.

26:24.866 --> 26:25.946
We are at a time point.

26:28.228 --> 26:32.209
We are at a time point when human diversity is at its peak for all time.

26:32.269 --> 26:37.551
There will never be more genetic diversity available again and for how long?

26:37.651 --> 26:38.971
I can't precisely say.

26:39.571 --> 26:44.012
Maybe a generation, maybe a half, maybe two generations.

26:44.092 --> 26:46.913
But it is one big theater with one big cast.

26:47.153 --> 26:48.834
Everyone trusts the script because

26:49.614 --> 26:50.695
That's how theater works.

26:51.596 --> 26:54.038
You can't change the script by yelling from the audience.

26:55.519 --> 27:04.266
And in America right now, because it's not real, you can't really change the script by yelling on social media or maybe even by voting at this point.

27:04.386 --> 27:06.147
That sounds pretty dark, but it's true.

27:06.688 --> 27:09.470
I'm happy to bring the truth as best I know it.

27:12.272 --> 27:18.017
I really, I don't want to be the guy that's got to say that autism spectrum disorder is a myth.

27:19.053 --> 27:21.054
but no one else is saying it.

27:21.774 --> 27:25.755
And more precisely, no one else is saying why would they create such a myth.

27:27.556 --> 27:31.878
And it's not because vaccines or vaccines don't work or vaccines hurt people.

27:32.498 --> 27:37.419
It's because intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s that they don't want it questioned.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.542
It's because virology, and specifically RNA virology, they don't want questioned as a science.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.743
And public health as a prerogative, as a,

27:47.723 --> 27:55.148
imperative, as something that can be supernational, as something that they do not want questioned as a reason.

27:55.188 --> 27:56.068
That's the reality.

27:56.709 --> 28:06.815
And there's no doubt in my mind that pandemics and gain of function are also myths that were purposefully released into our brain for the same reason.

28:07.736 --> 28:09.257
And so, very bad.

28:10.635 --> 28:27.172
useless arguments are made about mandates and health freedom and adjuvants and mercury instead of really somebody getting down to the biology and science and statistics as a professional and showing you the truth.

28:28.653 --> 28:32.877
And that's what I've been trying to do for the last six years, is I've tried to figure out what the hell's going on.

28:33.718 --> 28:40.864
And I believe I've gotten to the point where I can claim that Gig Ohm Biological has at least a pair of glasses that works.

28:41.805 --> 28:46.489
And the pair of glasses that works for us is always looking at the biology.

28:47.529 --> 28:55.655
And if we stay focused on that biology, oftentimes a lot of the other stuff that's smoke and mirrors presents itself exactly as that.

28:55.775 --> 28:56.916
Smoke and mirrors.

28:57.317 --> 28:58.838
Smoke and mirrors on social media.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.298
Show your children the truth.

29:01.799 --> 29:03.881
Please show your children the truth.

29:04.121 --> 29:11.209
Explain to them how we got trapped over many, many years by these stories and by these conspiracy theories.

29:11.870 --> 29:17.055
Because our children need to understand why the cheese is free on social media.

29:17.736 --> 29:20.179
They need to understand that it's a joke.

29:20.799 --> 29:21.900
They don't sell ads.

29:23.024 --> 29:32.967
It's not subscriptions to Spotify that pays $250,000,000 for Joe Rogan after paying $200,000,000 for Joe Rogan.

29:33.007 --> 29:33.228
No.

29:33.808 --> 29:36.289
Ladies and gentlemen, America needs to stay focused.

29:37.789 --> 29:38.870
Just like that eagle did.

29:39.110 --> 29:39.890
Stay focused.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.090
Look at him staying focused.

29:43.071 --> 29:44.932
Don't take the bait on social media.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.673
That's usually the easiest by just getting off of social media.

29:47.713 --> 29:48.313
Love your neighbor.

29:48.353 --> 29:51.434
That's usually the easiest by walking out of your house and going talking to him.

29:52.752 --> 29:58.657
Um, we are in very big trouble because we were set up.

29:58.717 --> 29:59.338
You can hear it.

29:59.738 --> 30:00.599
Don't take Tylenol.

30:00.619 --> 30:01.339
We were set up.

30:01.379 --> 30:01.980
Don't take it.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.661
With Tylenol, don't take it.

30:04.282 --> 30:04.982
Don't take it.

30:05.242 --> 30:06.523
Don't use Tylenol.

30:06.664 --> 30:07.644
Don't take Tylenol.

30:07.905 --> 30:09.506
Don't take Tylenol.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.287
Fight like hell not to take it.

30:12.248 --> 30:15.390
These people are all malevolent actors.

30:15.430 --> 30:16.811
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

30:16.831 --> 30:20.013
This is GigaOM Biological, where biology is the way life is.

30:20.173 --> 30:25.996
A Pattern Integrity coming to you live from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, home of the Blackhawks.

30:27.237 --> 30:36.163
Also rumored home and alma mater of Matthew Crooks, the guy that supposedly

30:37.077 --> 30:42.821
on the sitcom that we're watching, shot Donald Trump in the ear from a roof.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.024
He was on the rifle team at my son's high school, apparently.

30:48.565 --> 30:54.690
And there's a Black Rock video featuring him, which is just absolutely hilarious.

30:55.490 --> 31:03.556
And the reason why it is hilarious is because, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, the one thing that I find

31:06.192 --> 31:15.878
compelling, is to try and use my goldfish memory to see if I can remember things that people used to talk about that they don't talk about anymore.

31:15.999 --> 31:28.587
And Matt Taibbi, having just recently been in front of the Senate talking about something or another, is one of these people who used to talk about something in a very vigorous and excited way.

31:29.347 --> 31:32.890
And that something that he used to talk about was a vampire squid.

31:33.755 --> 31:42.883
Matt Taibbi used to talk about a vampire squid that was responsible for bankrupting Greece and doing all kinds of very nefarious international financial operations.

31:42.923 --> 31:47.567
And that vampire squid was actually also called Goldman Sachs.

31:48.891 --> 32:04.158
Interestingly enough, Matt Taibbi then became connected to the Brett Weinstein Intellectual Dark Web Network, and that includes also all kinds of people, including Melissa Chen and Tulsi Gabbard.

32:04.178 --> 32:14.703
This is just a remarkable set of circumstances that's brought us here, all with a group of podcast actors on a scripted narrative that I believe was provided to them

32:15.868 --> 32:21.297
by the National Security State, possibly under the pretense of NATO or the State Department.

32:22.399 --> 32:27.607
However exactly this was rolled out though, these people are traitors to our grandchildren and essentially, if

32:29.798 --> 32:30.378
I'm right.

32:30.618 --> 32:38.941
They should be considered criminals, even though, of course, because they're working for the US government and NATO, they wouldn't really be considered criminals.

32:39.582 --> 32:56.868
But I think that from a professional and personal perspective, this list of people that I would be willing to provide any news source or court of law, I believe that these people should be publicly outed and suffer for the rest of their life for the role that they played

32:57.501 --> 33:11.284
in the falsification of the pandemic and the indirect and direct murder of Americans and other citizens of the world under the pretenses of these protocols, under the pretenses of COVID being real.

33:14.290 --> 33:24.674
I'm absolutely deadly serious when I say that the Trump administration has been twice a fraud, twice a puppet, twice a Trojan horse.

33:25.194 --> 33:41.261
This time the Trojan horse operation is much more obvious because they have a UK citizen at the head of the FDA, an Indian citizen at the head of the NIH, and a Turkish citizen at the head of Medicare, and a former heroin addict and brain worm victim at the head of HHS.

33:45.219 --> 34:02.205
We are about to see America get judo thrown on its face with regard to Israel, and the Middle East, and Libya, and currency manipulation, and the pipeline in the ocean, and the Ukraine war.

34:02.646 --> 34:04.826
It's all gonna get turned upside down.

34:06.707 --> 34:11.169
And American citizens will be very tempted by social media to turn on each other.

34:12.361 --> 34:24.706
and to turn on the idea, the concept, the very nationalism that would keep this country together under any other circumstances is going to potentially disappear in an instant.

34:25.612 --> 34:28.134
And it's because of our acquiescence to social media.

34:28.174 --> 34:43.045
The only way to stop it is to get a meaningful number of the population, especially those people under 40, off of social media and convince them that they can't use social media to find the truth because it's not available there.

34:46.148 --> 34:49.210
I don't know how easy it will be to seek the truth together like that.

34:49.270 --> 34:52.272
I don't know how easy it will be to get people off of social media.

34:52.372 --> 34:54.234
I can get off of social media tomorrow.

34:58.880 --> 35:02.383
It's just that at some point in time we leave all those people in the cave.

35:03.844 --> 35:08.588
I don't want all of you to leave your friends and leave the connections that you have with your friends.

35:08.728 --> 35:13.591
I want you to stop using social media to find any version of the truth.

35:15.633 --> 35:20.877
You want to use social media to send DMS to your family, to communicate directly with people.

35:21.658 --> 35:22.218
Go for it.

35:22.678 --> 35:23.339
Keep going.

35:25.114 --> 35:27.895
But don't use social media as a bulletin board.

35:28.095 --> 35:30.616
Don't use social media as a want ad.

35:30.656 --> 35:34.337
Don't use social media as a boredom cure.

35:34.837 --> 35:37.438
Don't use social media as a research tool.

35:40.298 --> 35:47.220
Unless you're extremely, extremely careful and extremely meticulous about what it is you want to find and how you're finding it.

35:47.981 --> 35:52.482
Because social media is a military control software suite.

35:54.850 --> 36:20.202
clean up the numbers, the two docs here can clean up the numbers for me, but isn't it something like 95 or it's 99% recovery rate, unless you have two other comorbidities, usually diabetes and overweight, and that includes usually people that are over 80 that I... And so I showed you a couple of days ago, and I think this is very significant that these three, four people were on a podcast in February or May or whatever of 2021.

36:22.062 --> 36:30.988
Because these people then, over the course of the next three years, spread out and became kind of rivals on different sides of the coin.

36:31.449 --> 36:40.975
This guy would go on to stream daily with two future FDA officials, Vinay Prasad and Marty McCary.

36:41.016 --> 36:42.356
He would stream with them like 10 times.

36:45.453 --> 36:57.330
And Dr. Drew would go on to start his own show to rise in prominence on Rumble, to have all these people like Kelly Victory on all the time, to have all McCullough and all them.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.373
This guy came from Canada?

37:01.109 --> 37:05.153
and moved to Florida, started streaming with Barnes.

37:05.393 --> 37:15.041
And that was all perhaps at some point was not, was just accidental, the trucker thing in Canada maybe, but recruited nevertheless.

37:15.902 --> 37:27.212
And that guy's of course, old school intellectual dark web in the original picture with Weinstein, Weinstein, Peterson, Rogan, Harris, you know, and Shapiro.

37:29.301 --> 37:55.932
And so fast forward to 2024, and here we have Sam Harris and Shapiro in the original intellectual dark web photo with Weinstein, Weinstein, Peterson, Rubin, and Harris with this person who we know to be a fraud because of her appearance on Joe Rogan in 2019 when she was already working at the New York Times.

37:59.269 --> 38:14.801
And in that interview, it's like three hours of painful, obvious scripting on Rogan's part where she just drops the ball, spills the drink, puts the cigarette in her mouth and lights the wrong end.

38:14.861 --> 38:19.604
She does all kinds of stupid shit and says all kinds of stupid shit.

38:20.004 --> 38:28.411
And we're supposed to believe that just a few years later, she was able to develop a conservative right wing

38:29.505 --> 38:40.154
blog and news podcast that would be bought in 2025 by Larry Ellison's son.

38:42.496 --> 38:43.797
This is not real.

38:43.897 --> 38:48.221
This is a podcast for, this is a national security theater for dummies.

38:49.437 --> 39:01.792
If you take that person seriously, or this person seriously, or just one of these three people seriously, the National Security Theater for Dummies worked on you.

39:03.134 --> 39:07.459
And I'm right here to tell you that at some point in time in 2020 and 21 and 22, it was working on me.

39:11.257 --> 39:19.542
This is not an easy thing to break free of, but once you break free of it, it is everywhere to be seen, plain and obvious.

39:19.722 --> 39:23.964
And Barry is an example of the plain and obvious.

39:26.245 --> 39:27.186
And it's not what you think.

39:30.086 --> 39:31.707
Because this is now, right?

39:31.747 --> 39:33.968
This is 2024, this was 2021.

39:34.428 --> 39:42.832
I want you to see that this National Security Theater for Dummies is premised under the principle that a conversation is convincing.

39:42.912 --> 39:49.435
So if we can have four people on a script or three out of four people on a script, this is convincing.

39:50.636 --> 39:54.998
And we figured that out all the way back in the early 2000s.

39:56.819 --> 39:59.120
Hell, Larry King showed us that.

40:00.748 --> 40:02.949
It's just that how do you find another Larry King?

40:03.009 --> 40:07.491
How do you find somebody that can do what Larry King does, but will do it exactly the way you want to do it?

40:08.592 --> 40:10.073
How do you find a lot of those people?

40:13.755 --> 40:14.815
And that's where we are.

40:14.835 --> 40:20.938
Now I'm going to play the second half of it.

40:20.978 --> 40:25.761
What he did was he got even more gross than he did in the first part.

40:27.014 --> 40:28.855
and it was so gross I couldn't even play it.

40:29.615 --> 40:36.138
And then now he's gonna do the typical scripted comedy thing and bring the first joke back again.

40:37.939 --> 40:38.359
Here we go.

40:38.379 --> 40:52.946
9-11 had way better conspiracy theories.

40:57.270 --> 41:01.332
Every conspiracy theory is better than fucking COVID conspiracy theories.

41:01.872 --> 41:04.073
I loved conspiracy theories.

41:05.134 --> 41:07.375
I guess for entertainment purposes only.

41:07.455 --> 41:13.298
I wasn't fucking... But... Fucking COVID!

41:14.226 --> 41:20.388
Like 9-11, all of them, Waco, fucking Oklahoma City bombing, all those conspiracy theories.

41:20.468 --> 41:21.628
I hate to be the old man.

41:21.668 --> 41:24.449
Conspiracy theories were way better when I was a kid.

41:25.069 --> 41:28.650
But 9-11, they made sense.

41:28.690 --> 41:36.252
There was a sober, cogent, convincing narrator who would slowly bring you through all the beats of why.

41:36.773 --> 41:41.554
And on the morning of September 11th, the hijackers, but at the same time,

41:42.372 --> 41:46.754
You're selling me, I know this is bullshit, but you're doing great.

41:49.695 --> 42:07.222
An important thing to remember here that Mark Kulak has pointed out so well in his work over the last couple weeks is that the narrative after 9-11 was curated in a much less thorough way immediately.

42:08.142 --> 42:10.603
So that the immediate time afterward,

42:12.574 --> 42:23.516
They had probably what could be characterized as much less control over the spin that was happening all around the United States.

42:24.156 --> 42:33.298
And maybe they did have some people out there that were supposed to do that stuff, but the speed with which this was done was different.

42:34.838 --> 42:41.739
Of course, on the network news, they already knew it was Osama bin Laden within hours of the planes hitting or whatever happened.

42:42.483 --> 43:00.733
But I guess what I would like to propose, and what Mark, sorry, not what I would like to propose, but what Mark would like to propose is that because 9-11 as it happened was not exactly what most people expected to happen,

43:02.162 --> 43:06.765
The details of that are what Mark is working on.

43:07.305 --> 43:16.331
It's just that nobody's really tried to challenge this narrative that there were airplanes that were hijacked, that were crashed into buildings, and the buildings fell down.

43:17.964 --> 43:21.447
Even Tucker Carlson doesn't seem to be willing to question that.

43:22.008 --> 43:33.357
Interestingly enough, he's telling an audience that the conspiracy theories were much better when we were kids, but he's never going to tell you why, except that I guess the conspiracy movies had better narrators.

43:37.421 --> 43:43.606
And it's actually, you know, because the physics of what happened at Oklahoma city are questionable.

43:44.775 --> 43:47.677
The physics of what happened on 9-11 are questionable.

43:47.717 --> 43:49.238
He'll say it, but not really.

43:49.258 --> 43:56.744
And of course the biology of what happened during COVID is questionable, but he says that he doesn't even think those are stupid.

43:58.525 --> 44:00.407
This is all by design, I assure you.

44:00.487 --> 44:09.894
Even if nobody that you know sees Doug Stanhope, it's about what Doug Stanhope does and what Rogan does and what

44:11.218 --> 44:22.444
all these lefties do and all this stuff and how it interacts back with all of these social networks that we ourselves have formed with one another.

44:23.530 --> 44:24.811
And they have that data.

44:24.851 --> 44:26.112
They have that mapped out.

44:26.172 --> 44:27.453
They can see it happen.

44:28.114 --> 44:41.225
So even if they put the idea out on Doug Stanhope's podcast and only 40 other ones, all of which none of us watch, it could be that in two weeks, one of the people that we're watching picks it up and says it anyway.

44:42.647 --> 44:47.451
And they have been watching this happen for years already during the pandemic.

44:48.832 --> 45:04.573
watching what happens when the first person who says it is Brett Weinstein versus when the first person who says it is Jessica Rose, watching what happens when the first person who says it is Geert van den Bosch versus when the first person who says it is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and they have brilliantly

45:05.194 --> 45:06.975
meticulous statistics on this.

45:07.535 --> 45:13.378
They know exactly what to expect when Steve Bannon says something or when Steve Bannon complains about a product.

45:13.738 --> 45:20.881
They know exactly what's going to happen when Joe Rogan breaks into an ad in his Spotify podcast.

45:20.921 --> 45:25.303
They know how many people are likely to click on the link.

45:29.949 --> 45:31.570
So this is not by accident.

45:32.010 --> 45:33.430
This is script.

45:33.570 --> 45:34.771
The QAnon shit.

45:35.291 --> 45:45.435
Oh, some fucking anonymous guy leaves a cryptic message, a message board, and you have to figure out the conspiracy theory on your own and build it from scratch.

45:46.015 --> 45:50.317
He said some nonsense and you use it as a Mad Libs up there.

45:50.677 --> 45:52.878
Put a verb here and an adverb there.

45:53.258 --> 45:54.338
The adjective here.

45:54.679 --> 45:55.719
And you go, this is fucking

45:57.874 --> 46:09.803
difference between 9-11 scientific bent angle what temperature does tungsten steel melt at versus QAnon.

46:09.983 --> 46:16.408
Oh he said the monkey flies at dawn so I think that means Tom Hanks is fucking kidding.

46:16.468 --> 46:26.216
So funny right for Doug Stanhope the COVID conspiracy has to do with QAnon and the 9-11 conspiracy has to do with the Loose Change movie I guess.

46:32.471 --> 46:38.014
It's with the Bilderbergs on Epstein Island and that's why tattoo killed himself.

46:38.235 --> 46:45.999
Boss, boss, the plane, the plane and Hillary Clinton grows vampire teeth at midnight and sucks baby's blood.

46:46.039 --> 46:53.564
The way I see it, she's got a cocktail of a baby dressed with garnishes like that and she pushes a tattoo killed himself.

46:54.875 --> 47:13.410
versus QAnon, oh, he said the monkey flies at dawn, so I think that means Tom Hanks is fucking kids with the Bilderbergs on Epstein Island, and that's why Tattoo killed himself, boss, boss, the plane, the plane, and Hillary Clinton grows.

47:13.510 --> 47:17.413
So they're even gonna let him make fun of the script, you see, he's, he's, he,

47:18.513 --> 47:30.578
Do you really, do we really believe that the system is so out of control and random that the way that it runs is kind of a haphazard combination of blackmail, sex, and drugs?

47:30.618 --> 47:31.638
That's ridiculous.

47:32.519 --> 47:33.439
It's ridiculous.

47:34.960 --> 47:37.361
And he sees that it's ridiculous.

47:37.401 --> 47:45.544
He's joking about it, but he doesn't fill in the blank that it's just a national security script because he's part of it.

47:46.567 --> 47:47.728
Joe Rogan is part of it.

47:47.788 --> 47:50.150
Everybody, Jimmy Kimmel's part of it.

47:50.190 --> 47:51.971
It's all one malevolent show.

47:51.991 --> 47:55.334
It's vampire teeth at midnight and sucks baby's blood.

47:55.374 --> 48:07.564
The way I see it, she's got a cocktail of a baby dressed with garnishes like that and she pushes a crazy straw down into his soft spot and then sucks his little head flat like a juice box.

48:07.624 --> 48:09.286
That's how I imagine it happens.

48:10.807 --> 48:12.128
For eternal youth, you know?

48:12.148 --> 48:15.491
And you go, how did you come up with that?

48:17.025 --> 48:17.966
Follow the money.

48:17.986 --> 48:22.633
You suck.

48:25.237 --> 48:32.468
You've ruined conspiracy theories as an entertainment source, a genre for everybody for here.

48:33.604 --> 48:35.865
I love to be lied to and you stink at this.

48:37.807 --> 48:39.948
I did fucking Roseanne Barr.

48:40.588 --> 48:51.535
I did her podcast during the corn times and she's a friend of mine and she's a fucking comedy legend and she's genius.

48:51.615 --> 48:55.297
She's a beautiful mind like the film.

48:57.239 --> 48:58.120
Roseanne Barr.

48:58.700 --> 49:00.862
Yeah, Roseanne Barr is also part of this.

49:01.102 --> 49:02.963
Abso-frickin-lutely she is.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.364
Listen to this nonsense.

49:05.705 --> 49:06.645
Diplomacy?

49:08.867 --> 49:11.589
She believes a lot of this QAnon-y shit.

49:12.269 --> 49:20.775
And so we're talking and then it's just all normal and then she fucking deviates down some path of fucking blizzard people, I don't know, just something.

49:20.835 --> 49:23.557
I just let her exhaust herself talking.

49:24.157 --> 49:25.799
And then at the end when she's...

49:26.940 --> 49:32.962
Out of breath, I said, Rosent, do you really think what you just told me is plausible?

49:33.042 --> 49:35.263
Does that sound likely?

49:36.464 --> 49:39.705
And she goes, what, you don't think so?

49:42.226 --> 49:43.866
In that case, I don't know.

49:48.748 --> 49:50.749
How weak was the bullshit?

49:52.622 --> 50:04.416
that sold you on this to begin with, that you just went on this massive diatribe where all I have to do is basically shrug my shoulders in response.

50:05.951 --> 50:08.572
and make you collapse like a house of cards.

50:09.132 --> 50:15.454
And that's where a lot of people with the anti-vax health freedom movement are with their family and friends.

50:15.794 --> 50:21.056
They don't actually have a coherent, cogent argument for their position.

50:21.116 --> 50:27.038
They've been lured off track and into the weeds by these false

50:29.036 --> 50:32.039
Narrative pushers like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:32.079 --> 50:44.370
and Mary Holland and Merrill Nass and Brian Hooker, all of whom have been concealing the fact that there's a biologically plausible reason why the vaccine schedule is dangerous, and specific ones more than others.

50:44.890 --> 50:51.396
There's a biologically plausible reason why certain kinds of vaccines are destined never to work.

50:53.407 --> 51:04.174
that even if they produce the antibody response that they say is produced, the augmentation of the immune system is not as foolproof as they claim.

51:06.212 --> 51:17.076
And more importantly, a lot of the diseases, the 16 or 18 supposedly vaccine-preventable diseases, were never really hurting that many people to begin with.

51:17.136 --> 51:19.196
And that's gonna sound scary to some people.

51:20.117 --> 51:22.757
It's gonna be something that makes a lot of people angry.

51:23.298 --> 51:33.161
But there is a distinct biological possibility that some of these contagious phenomenon can be prevented by pre-exposure.

51:33.991 --> 51:48.637
and that subcutaneous or continuous exposure to proteins related to or derived from these contagious phenomenon might assist in our ability to deal with them.

51:48.657 --> 51:54.299
And more importantly, attenuate the immune reaction associated with exposure to them.

51:54.419 --> 52:02.863
In other words, instead of reacting to exposure to the measles by producing the symptoms of measles, the disease,

52:03.953 --> 52:13.079
You wouldn't produce the symptoms, but you would still be exposed to the antigen complement, whatever it is that measles is that's considered contagious.

52:14.266 --> 52:31.091
So it's very similar to there always being poison ivy in the woods, but if you grew up and you were young and you were exposed to it at the right time and for whatever reason your skin made immunity to it, it wouldn't be like you couldn't spread poison ivy to somebody else.

52:31.711 --> 52:34.652
It's just that when it gets on your clothes, it's not going to matter.

52:36.209 --> 52:43.991
Very similar to how a beekeeper might not be feeling bee stings after many years of working as a beekeeper, especially.

52:44.011 --> 52:53.754
It's just, none of these metaphors are perfect, but all of these metaphors are getting at the heart of the matter.

52:56.935 --> 53:02.697
And that is, it is not as simple as there's no viruses, just like it's not as simple as no vaccines are good.

53:03.737 --> 53:16.761
vaccination doesn't work, or something like that, unless you are precise enough to say that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting our immune system is a dumb idea.

53:18.002 --> 53:18.582
But maybe

53:19.977 --> 53:21.797
Cutaneous exposure isn't bad.

53:22.237 --> 53:23.938
Maybe inhalation wouldn't be bad.

53:24.018 --> 53:26.458
Maybe oral vaccination might work.

53:26.558 --> 53:35.120
Maybe in the end, like Paul Offit and others have been recorded saying, the ideal vaccination schedule would all be oral.

53:38.360 --> 53:48.822
And if we think about a new biology 101 organized around the microbiome and mitochondrial DNA and a continuum of development,

53:52.148 --> 53:58.834
Yeah, we just might find ourselves able to reinterpret our existence and our biology in a whole new way.

53:58.954 --> 54:05.900
Almost all of the observations that we've made in the past might still be useful, just in a completely different context.

54:08.802 --> 54:20.312
And so we are being urged to accept recent events and recent circumstances, and I would suggest to you that that's just simply unacceptable.

54:22.074 --> 54:35.687
Now is the time to wake up as a family, parents and children together and wake up about recent American history and understand that the truth is not available on social media.

54:35.747 --> 54:44.014
These people will not question the characters that they are asked to play and they will not question the script they are asked to read.

54:46.530 --> 54:50.693
But first of all, she knows she's out of her mind, and that's half the battle.

54:50.753 --> 54:55.516
She's the first to tell you, I'm batshit crazy, and people don't know the half of it.

54:56.577 --> 55:03.841
So if you know that you're gullible or stupid or fucking insane, you're one step ahead of the game.

55:04.302 --> 55:07.144
I know that I'm fucking easily sold on some bullshit.

55:08.124 --> 55:13.087
But then she said, probably the most poignant

55:14.468 --> 55:16.809
She goes, that's the problem now.

55:18.189 --> 55:23.571
How do we even do stand-up comedy anymore when there's no such thing as truth left?

55:26.272 --> 55:28.733
I just fucking got goosebumps.

55:31.654 --> 55:32.274
How do you?

55:32.334 --> 55:34.615
How do you fucking get through life, anything?

55:36.016 --> 55:38.636
Like there used to be a consensus of truth.

55:41.057 --> 55:42.698
Some stable flooring,

55:43.755 --> 55:46.476
It's a war in Iraq, let's say.

55:47.336 --> 55:49.277
Yes, there was a war in Iraq.

55:49.337 --> 55:51.918
And as a comic, you could have any angle.

55:52.038 --> 55:55.540
It's a war for oil or buck the terrorists.

55:55.600 --> 55:57.740
Let's nuke them back to the Stone Age.

55:59.141 --> 56:01.082
But at least you're standing on the same.

56:01.842 --> 56:03.202
There is a war in Iraq.

56:03.723 --> 56:06.624
There was not a vocal screaming,

56:07.560 --> 56:34.808
third party going there is no war in iraq it's a false flag operation because the earth is flat and iraq is on the underside of it so if you try to deploy troops there they just fall into under space so you see exactly he sees it exactly exactly exactly but he's scripted not to teach the audience what he sees he's scripted to say it without saying it

56:36.107 --> 56:38.248
Everything they know is a lie.

56:40.369 --> 56:45.491
He's not saying that the pandemic was a lie, but he's implying it.

56:47.212 --> 56:52.695
That's what anybody who thinks it was a lie is thinking, and anybody who thinks that it wasn't a lie isn't thinking.

56:53.195 --> 56:56.516
It's the perfect military scripted theater.

56:59.238 --> 57:01.019
What the fuck do you do?

57:06.670 --> 57:07.711
I'll tell you what I've done.

57:08.131 --> 57:11.452
I've stopped caring and it's worked out beautifully.

57:12.412 --> 57:15.833
That's absolutely the worst solution ever to stop caring.

57:15.873 --> 57:27.116
What you need to do is get on the same page as your kids and try to move forward together with a plan on how to have an understanding of what happened for the last five years, 10 years, 15 years and 20.

57:29.076 --> 57:42.519
And once we understand that and we get back to the start of the Human Genome Project, we can start to put into focus where we are as a nation and where you and I want to go as a community of families in America today.

57:42.599 --> 57:44.820
You know they eat babies.

57:44.880 --> 57:46.580
That is not bullshit.

57:48.100 --> 57:49.141
It's true.

57:49.361 --> 57:51.881
So it's not just the dogs and the cats, not just the pets?

57:53.522 --> 57:55.402
It's not just the dogs and the cats.

57:56.667 --> 58:02.830
They're full-on vampires, and everybody still thinks I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy.

58:03.170 --> 58:05.872
They're full-on vampires.

58:05.972 --> 58:10.774
They love the taste of human flesh, and they drink human blood.

58:11.154 --> 58:12.115
They do talk.

58:12.475 --> 58:22.380
By the time we go in to vote for Trump, that he will open up everybody's eyes, and they will stop pretending to be asleep.

58:23.200 --> 58:27.502
You know what they say, you can't wake people up that are pretending to be asleep.

58:27.562 --> 58:42.050
But I pray to God, please wake up even those who are pretending to be asleep with the irrefutable truth of what the worst people on this planet are really up to.

58:42.110 --> 58:43.571
They are really up to that.

58:44.131 --> 58:44.852
They're doing it.

58:46.693 --> 58:48.374
There are so many victims.

58:49.505 --> 58:52.448
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been for all the marbles.

58:52.568 --> 58:56.051
It's been a population pyramid managing exercise.

58:56.111 --> 58:57.573
It's about the grandchildren of Earth.

58:57.633 --> 59:00.996
It's about inverting their sovereignty to experimental animal status.

59:01.597 --> 59:06.842
There's only a couple generations left on Earth for this much diversity to be available to be collected.

59:07.462 --> 59:12.424
They are now in the process of building the infrastructure necessary to store it and to analyze it.

59:12.944 --> 59:18.385
And they are also in the process of building the infrastructure to collect the data associated with it.

59:18.445 --> 59:22.387
That infrastructure includes, of course, your phone and your smart devices.

59:22.447 --> 59:25.968
It also includes any medical databases out there.

59:26.008 --> 59:35.851
It includes all the national security imperatives to do so, all the way up to the Department of Energy, where the national security state put the Human Genome Project all the way back then.

59:36.391 --> 59:39.314
That's why there's a fake global health freedom movement.

59:39.334 --> 59:44.178
That's why Elon, Jeff, Peter, Alex, Mark, Bobby, and Donnie are so ridiculous.

59:45.198 --> 59:46.139
It's for all the marbles.

59:46.219 --> 59:47.861
It's murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

59:47.881 --> 59:49.402
We can find the truth together.

59:49.422 --> 59:53.866
If you were like a superb legendary serial killer,

59:54.881 --> 01:00:06.744
cold case decades you murdered people perfectly flawlessly no and you know how to turn off the cell phone so it doesn't ping when you're burying a body oh this is the same stand-up

01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:25.644
all the basic, the one-on-ones, and you got away with it for decades to the point where now you're just retired in your 70s, you had that mail-order pride you had since fuckin' 97, and you lived a quiet, peaceful life, only to be busted by a podcaster?

01:00:28.585 --> 01:00:30.986
What kind of Scooby-Doo shit is this?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:47.573
It's not by accident, ladies and gentlemen, it's because GigaOM Biological is doing work that they have to respond to, that they have to pretend doesn't exist by absorbing it piece by piece, spread out over all these actors.

01:00:48.213 --> 01:00:52.417
That's why you see a lot of these people from a lot of different countries picking up pieces of this

01:00:53.138 --> 01:00:56.800
show and the things that we have taught over the last six years.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:03.042
And Doug Stanhope is just one of many that's been scripted to say some of the things that we've put together.

01:01:03.862 --> 01:01:09.525
Ladies and gentlemen, the American public is governed by national security actors, podcast actors.

01:01:10.365 --> 01:01:15.528
Citizens are actively divided on false premises that these podcast actors argue about.

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:21.952
The pandemic was the culmination of a long con that stems all the way back to the Human Genome Project and before.

01:01:22.552 --> 01:01:26.374
The real motivation is the Human Genome Project and it's still ongoing.

01:01:26.914 --> 01:01:31.197
In two generations, all this diversity will be gone and the opportunity will be lost.

01:01:31.257 --> 01:01:34.379
So if you were in charge, what would you do?

01:01:34.439 --> 01:01:35.559
That's really the question.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.562
Because I think what you're seeing right now is what they would do.

01:01:41.484 --> 01:01:42.365
That's what you're seeing.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:49.753
If you want to start getting off of social media and start following me directly, you can follow me at stream.gigaohm.bow.

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:57.743
You can download the PeerTube app, which will use the website to load my videos directly to your phone, not using any of your data.

01:01:58.864 --> 01:02:08.297
And that makes it pretty nice because then you're not getting other videos from the YouTube algorithm or having other, you know, have to follow other people on Instagram or anything like that.

01:02:08.798 --> 01:02:10.420
PeerTube app serves up just me.

01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:14.025
And right now on my PeerTube server, I am

01:02:15.246 --> 01:02:17.287
allowing Mark Kulak to post his videos.

01:02:17.327 --> 01:02:21.149
And so sometimes you will also see Mark Kulak's videos above mine in the feed.

01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:23.770
And that's just the way that it works right now.

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.412
But Mark's working on getting his own instance of PeerTube.

01:02:26.912 --> 01:02:30.554
And then those things will be completely separate as separate channels in the app too.

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:34.516
So lots of things coming in the future I think are going to be really exciting.

01:02:34.556 --> 01:02:37.598
Intramuscular injection is indeed a dumb idea for the late 1800s.

01:02:38.138 --> 01:02:41.199
Transfection in healthy humans is a crime.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.260
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.021
Autism is a meaningless word by design.

01:02:46.041 --> 01:02:47.722
This is fifth generation warfare.

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:52.103
They're lying to you on social media and groups.

01:02:53.864 --> 01:03:12.611
Um, and America has been fooled by a decades long theater that has culminated in this podcast universe thing, but you can tell if someone's lying and it's Tucker Carlson and, and, and, and Steve Bannon and Megan Kelly and, and all these people are Pierce Morgan.

01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:12.991
They're all,

01:03:13.476 --> 01:03:20.064
They're all being managed, they're all being controlled, and they're all part of a theater, and they're all scripted actors.

01:03:20.124 --> 01:03:24.749
And those scripted actors can convince other scripted actors to behave unwittingly.

01:03:24.769 --> 01:03:29.295
And I suppose the best model is really the Joe Rogan experience.

01:03:29.335 --> 01:03:33.199
But nonetheless, I think America has been fooled by a decades-long theater.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.544
and that COVID was the culmination of it.

01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:39.007
I guess I should have left that up a little while longer.

01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:45.515
And this illusion of consensus on social media that things are actually happening there and people are actually arguing and that

01:03:46.078 --> 01:03:54.560
information is actually getting out there and that, you know, I don't know, opinions are being released and things can be said and people can be fired.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:04.121
You know, like Barry Weiss can be fired for what she says on Twitter or somebody's company can be bought out because of something they tweet.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:13.203
These are parts of the illusion that social media is so relevant that it changes the world in Germany and in America all at the same time.

01:04:13.743 --> 01:04:16.805
and they barely have to have any programmers because the algorithm does it.

01:04:18.446 --> 01:04:19.206
Stop lying!

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:21.847
It's murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:21.927 --> 01:04:22.768
Don't be fooled.

01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:24.209
Seek the truth with us.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:30.972
This line is not level because the population pyramid had predicted it back when I graduated from high school.

01:04:31.453 --> 01:04:32.493
You can see it right there.

01:04:32.513 --> 01:04:37.316
I think the timeline is most important to understand that

01:04:37.976 --> 01:04:48.783
As the population pyramid was about to yield that increase in all cause mortality, these fake organizations sprung up with their fake members and their sabotaging ways.

01:04:49.504 --> 01:04:57.949
And a lot of really well-meaning people were stood in front of, including probably Jack Hanley, including probably Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:06.195
And so I, again, can't stress enough how, if you have any doubts about anybody, just look at their timeline, look what they were saying in 2020 and 2021.

01:05:07.896 --> 01:05:09.738
You can see every one of these people's a clown.

01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:13.140
I gotta see where this is going.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.502
I thought I had, oh yeah, this is coming right now.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:15.863
Good.

01:05:16.743 --> 01:05:20.907
I might have to escape out of here though, so this starts again and plays correctly.

01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:21.407
Here we go.

01:05:21.427 --> 01:05:23.909
Hoo-ha!

01:05:23.949 --> 01:05:26.271
This is crazy, crazy, crazy times.

01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:26.992
That's all I know.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:27.552
One hour in.

01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:30.170
37, good to see you guys.

01:05:56.138 --> 01:06:17.437
Bill Maher, like Barry Weiss, is being promoted by other people in social media and mainstream media as a guy who went conservative, moved from the Democratic Party to Trump, just like RFK did, just like Barry Weiss did as a Jewish lesbian, just like a lot of these people did.

01:06:19.073 --> 01:06:34.908
And we're supposed to believe that everyone from Brian Hooker to Mary Holland to Brett Weinstein to all these, you know, people that were really all about the Democrats, including even Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone, all moved to the conservative side because of COVID.

01:06:35.369 --> 01:06:38.452
Because COVID made it obvious that there were overreach.

01:06:38.952 --> 01:06:41.254
It forced me to choose conservative.

01:06:41.694 --> 01:06:57.687
And now they're all going to come back to their senses and move back to the left and leave all of the conservatives that they rallied and all of the people that they convinced to come to that side and vote for Trump and be a part of the 50-50 in America.

01:06:57.707 --> 01:07:02.311
They're going to leave them all standing behind them and standing alone.

01:07:03.462 --> 01:07:04.144
That's the plan.

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.607
That's always been the plan.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.053
And those people will be burnt somehow.

01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:10.599
I don't know how it's going to happen or what the deal will be.

01:07:11.468 --> 01:07:21.454
But maybe the people on that side will be the people that don't get the universal income for the first two years, or don't get any, or don't sign up for digital ID.

01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:25.976
And then something else happens, although the real ID in America is already almost in everybody's pocket.

01:07:25.996 --> 01:07:35.562
They're the bro party, the party of car shows on the White House lawn, and breaking shit, and seeing what happens, and busting balls, and shooting stuff, like beer.

01:07:38.323 --> 01:07:38.964
And laws.

01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:50.033
It's been that way for a long time, the mommy party and the daddy party, the party of pussy hats and the party of truck nuts.

01:07:58.945 --> 01:08:04.450
That black guy they just showed was one of the worst political actors in America.

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:07.353
Like he's just, he'll do anything he's told to do.

01:08:07.993 --> 01:08:11.056
But that divide is on steroids now and getting worse.

01:08:11.136 --> 01:08:17.242
In the 24 election, young men preferred Trump by two points and young women, Kamala, by 24.

01:08:17.322 --> 01:08:22.647
The only way Trump can appeal to women 18 to 39 is making him one of his lawyers.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:34.811
Men and women can barely date anymore because they can't stomach each other's politics.

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:36.233
It's why everyone is gay now.

01:08:40.769 --> 01:08:44.110
We're just... We're just done with each other.

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:48.371
If you don't believe me, ask yourself, what podcasts do I listen to?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:09:02.076
Trump bros have 50,000 of them about politics and protein powder, while in the woman's sphere, the podcasts are all about balancing career and motherhood until eventually true crime happens and someone gets murdered.

01:09:04.878 --> 01:09:05.918
So I have my mouth full.

01:09:13.763 --> 01:09:32.012
But the idea that Bill Maher thinks that we are being governed by podcasts because that's the internet, because that's how social media works, because that's what people are choosing to do, because that's the way it's ended up.

01:09:33.493 --> 01:09:39.336
That's just the result of social media being what it is and the algorithm being what it is.

01:09:43.194 --> 01:09:44.375
That's just ad money.

01:09:46.236 --> 01:09:47.597
That's just advertising.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:59.446
The whole concept that this is just some random system of economics where money talks and, you know, it's just supply and demand.

01:10:00.847 --> 01:10:05.491
Social media is a military social control program suite.

01:10:07.423 --> 01:10:21.686
And the fact that people are all following podcasts that are separating men and women, that are making people consider a possibility that they might be in the wrong body when they are young.

01:10:22.846 --> 01:10:33.668
All these nonsensical ideas are only perceived to be widespread and also possible to be widespread because of social media.

01:10:35.828 --> 01:10:42.952
And Bill Maher is never going to be scripted to tell you to get off of social media.

01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:48.134
Bill Maher will be scripted to tell you that digital ID is the only way to make social media safe.

01:10:48.514 --> 01:10:51.476
That, I can assure you.

01:11:01.381 --> 01:11:03.282
They like murder, we like killing people.

01:11:04.938 --> 01:11:24.141
here's the thing i'm not afraid of digital id on the internet because digital id might make it possible or it should in theory make it possible for people to only be real it might make it a lot harder for people to pretend like they have

01:11:25.154 --> 01:11:40.421
the time to respond hundreds of times a day on substack comments, and also write substack articles, and also be on podcasts, and also be in telegram groups and in signal chats.

01:11:42.822 --> 01:11:50.285
If suddenly all social media apps require a digital ID, it might be a lot harder for bot networks

01:11:51.417 --> 01:11:54.619
to be useful and usefully deployed.

01:11:54.659 --> 01:12:08.749
It might be harder for people to use a staff to pretend and essentially be everywhere with their Twitter profile or with their Facebook profile or with their Instagram profile.

01:12:08.809 --> 01:12:16.213
Instead, make people's appearance on social media to be directly related to the amount of time that they spend there.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:18.375
That wouldn't be bad.

01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:27.517
The trouble would be if that held true for the average citizen, but for the meddlers like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:29.938 --> 01:12:40.281
or, you know, fake organizations like Children's Health Defense, that they were still allowed to create the illusion of being so widespread.

01:12:40.341 --> 01:12:41.281
So that's the trick here.

01:12:42.645 --> 01:12:44.126
This guy is on a script.

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:48.187
Here's a mind-blowing stat about the divide.

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:55.209
73% of boomer men disagreed with the statement, mental health challenges are an important part of my identity.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:58.731
72% of Gen Z women said the opposite.

01:12:59.091 --> 01:13:02.792
They agreed mental health challenges are an important part of my identity.

01:13:04.235 --> 01:13:05.436
OK, let's say it all together.

01:13:05.836 --> 01:13:06.877
Women are better than men.

01:13:07.337 --> 01:13:10.239
They're smarter and kinder and make way better firefighters.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:15.662
But I'm never moving past it isn't really the campaign slogan we're looking for.

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:19.204
I'm sorry, Democratic women, but this is your party.

01:13:19.945 --> 01:13:22.566
You have a special responsibility to look tough.

01:13:23.527 --> 01:13:33.809
Senator Elissa Slotkin seems to get that, and not just because of her service in Iraq and with the CIA, but because she says things like, Democrats need to fucking retake the flag.

01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:37.609
Democrats have to stop being weak and woke, she says.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:38.870
Good message.

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.590
Because no one's holding women back anymore.

01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:44.091
In many ways, they're leaving men in the dust.

01:13:44.631 --> 01:13:50.012
Women are much less likely to be unemployed now, less likely to blow a month's pay on DraftKings.

01:13:58.519 --> 01:14:01.321
and much more likely to complete college.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:04.123
Is that a commercial for Draft Kings?

01:14:04.303 --> 01:14:04.883
I think it is.

01:14:06.244 --> 01:14:09.386
The only writing young men do these days is engraving their bullets.

01:14:09.406 --> 01:14:11.408
That's okay.

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:20.094
Booing into applause, very rare.

01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:30.242
Uh, America now has 14 million women-owned businesses, which generate $2.7 trillion in revenue.

01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:31.482
Yeah.

01:14:32.022 --> 01:14:49.149
Women laun... Women launched 49% of all new businesses in 2024, and the number of black women-owned businesses outpaced the growth rates of every other demographic.

01:14:57.452 --> 01:14:58.413
I'm spitting facts.

01:15:01.215 --> 01:15:06.678
In the Barbie movie, when she storms into the Mattel boardroom, it's 12 people, all men.

01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:08.860
But Mattel is a real company.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.742
And in 2023, their boardroom was actually six men and five women.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:18.506
Perpetuating victimhood, especially when it's false, is not a great advertisement for leadership.

01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:24.170
Kamala Harris's new memoir of the 24 election is called 107 Days.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:27.072
But it should have been called Everyone Sucks But Me.

01:15:29.116 --> 01:15:35.701
So we're supposed to believe that he sees through it now, but at the time, I guess it seemed reasonable.

01:15:37.182 --> 01:15:49.791
It couldn't be that the national security state wanted to separate America into two ridiculous groups, a group that would just take anything that wasn't Trump and a group that would take Trump.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.723
It couldn't be a national security theater that he's included in.

01:15:55.943 --> 01:16:12.252
No, now he's portraying himself who's already willing and able to dunk on her for her silly book, but couldn't point out how ridiculous it was that the Democratic party could only come up with Joe Biden and her.

01:16:13.633 --> 01:16:15.274
It couldn't possibly be.

01:16:15.294 --> 01:16:19.256
It couldn't possibly be that Donald Trump was on their team.

01:16:19.636 --> 01:16:20.597
Couldn't possibly be.

01:16:21.857 --> 01:16:31.486
Just like it couldn't possibly be that Donald Trump was on their team when Hillary Clinton was able to just kind of stumble into the taxes thing.

01:16:31.506 --> 01:16:33.868
You know, that's why I use it.

01:16:33.888 --> 01:16:34.849
That makes me smart.

01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:44.018
That debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a debate between two people who've had been at each other's children's weddings.

01:16:48.257 --> 01:16:57.219
That was a debate between two lifelong friends and at least one of whom is a very skilled actor and the other a very skilled politician woman.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:08.082
So we were led to believe that Donald Trump dunked on her in that debate, but that was a script.

01:17:10.683 --> 01:17:25.027
And we're supposed to believe that he's willing to dunk on her now, but he can't see that it was a democratic script to have two inept candidates opposite Donald Trump for the second time.

01:17:26.748 --> 01:17:32.430
And now they've got Donald Trump in office and anything that he does or doesn't do can be blamed on him.

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:40.412
And so anything that they want to accomplish can be just accomplished by blaming it on Donald Trump or

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:59.653
or not, just like they did in the first term.

01:17:59.673 --> 01:18:04.216
107 days is a victim's title, because get it, she only had 107 days to win.

01:18:04.997 --> 01:18:08.159
Yeah, and a billion and a half dollars.

01:18:10.615 --> 01:18:16.899
A built-in army of about 75 million people who'd vote for any human adjacent life form that wasn't Trump.

01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:23.122
But in 107 days, nothing has ever calmed his fall.

01:18:23.262 --> 01:18:25.863
Biden lets her down by not stepping down sooner.

01:18:26.024 --> 01:18:27.084
Pouty face emoji.

01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:35.089
Gavin Newsom, he was asked for his endorsement, but texted, hiking will call back.

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:39.091
But then never did.

01:18:40.666 --> 01:18:42.327
And then he didn't even ask her to prom.

01:18:45.108 --> 01:18:52.030
America, America itself, lets Kamala down by not being ready for the running mate she really wanted, Pete Buttigieg.

01:18:52.591 --> 01:18:55.232
So she's stuck with the Home Depot paint salesman.

01:18:57.633 --> 01:18:58.893
And the rest is herstery.

01:19:01.394 --> 01:19:02.234
Poor Kamala.

01:19:02.675 --> 01:19:06.196
We made her the star of a rom-com and didn't even give her a gay best friend.

01:19:16.257 --> 01:19:24.621
Kamala writes that on election night, when it was clear she'd lost, an aide peeled the words, Madam President, off the cupcakes before handing them out.

01:19:25.982 --> 01:19:28.343
Oh, jeez.

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:31.905
That's like a scene from Bridget Jones Runs for President, for Christ's sake.

01:19:38.735 --> 01:19:45.496
Look, ladies, I know this isn't fair, but we're all always running against the worst cliche of who people think we are.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:51.338
Women Democrats can't look oversensitive or preachy or unable to laugh at themselves.

01:19:51.598 --> 01:19:56.779
They also can't look silly, like Gretchen Whitmer did, trying to hide in the Oval Office.

01:19:57.099 --> 01:19:58.839
They have to look brave and strong.

01:19:59.119 --> 01:20:07.201
It wasn't a good look for the woman party that all the guys were speaking out for Jimmy Kimmel when Trump went after him, except on The Woman Show.

01:20:07.901 --> 01:20:08.902
We're for five days.

01:20:09.742 --> 01:20:11.083
And there it is.

01:20:12.344 --> 01:20:19.710
The sighting of the cast, Jimmy Kimmel, all the good guys, and then the bad guys.

01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:22.311
The bad guys are also on the team though.

01:20:23.772 --> 01:20:26.034
Joy is on the team though.

01:20:26.414 --> 01:20:27.635
Whoopi's on the team.

01:20:28.896 --> 01:20:29.957
They're all on the team.

01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:38.289
The View has been on the team since the very beginning and part of the core of Trump derangement syndrome.

01:20:40.049 --> 01:20:41.730
So, of course, he gives them a shout-out.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:45.672
Outspoken hosts were suddenly as quiet as a geisha.

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:54.255
Then on the fifth day, they rose and said, no one silences us.

01:20:54.915 --> 01:20:55.675
No one had to.

01:20:55.715 --> 01:20:56.896
You silenced yourself.

01:21:04.457 --> 01:21:09.321
Whoopi Goldberg continued, did you all really think we weren't going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel?

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:12.463
No, I thought you would, but then you didn't.

01:21:19.889 --> 01:21:20.769
Five days?

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.111
Talk about needing extra time to get ready.

01:21:25.753 --> 01:21:30.917
And if you can't take a breath and laugh at that, you're making my point for me.

01:21:31.477 --> 01:21:32.658
Gosh, he's awful.

01:21:32.978 --> 01:21:33.639
He's awful.

01:21:47.729 --> 01:22:12.825
I'm sailing away Set an open course for the virgin sea Cause I've got to be free Free to face the life

01:22:14.008 --> 01:22:16.728
that's ahead of me.

01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:26.130
On board, I'm the captain, so climb aboard.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:38.532
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore, and I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try,

01:22:45.947 --> 01:22:50.993
Carry on I look to the sea

01:23:07.825 --> 01:23:32.696
Reflections in the waves Spark my memory Some happy, some sad I think of childhood friends And the dreams we had We lived happily

01:23:35.894 --> 01:23:53.204
So the story goes But somehow we missed out On the pot of gold But we'll try best that we can

01:24:19.182 --> 01:24:25.327
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said.

01:24:25.447 --> 01:24:31.991
They said, come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads.

01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:37.856
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me.

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:40.378
Come sail away, come sail away.

01:24:44.892 --> 01:25:02.392
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me.

01:25:14.263 --> 01:25:14.404
Yeah.

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:44.167
Oh.

01:26:26.662 --> 01:26:34.794
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me.

01:26:34.814 --> 01:26:36.596
Come sail away, come sail away.

01:27:20.963 --> 01:27:42.703
welcome back to the show ladies and gentlemen that was Styx come sail away i am trying to get you to understand that the timeline is the way to win the timeline is the way to win just gotta see on the internet what these people were doing

01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:50.912
and when they were doing it, and you will find the truth, who they were doing it with, what they were saying.

01:27:51.553 --> 01:28:01.836
None of these people make the intellectual progress that would be expected if they believed what they said they believed and any particular calendar date.

01:28:03.439 --> 01:28:05.921
It just simply doesn't make any sense.

01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:18.132
None of these actors that are on these podcasts with these elaborate histories have made the intellectual progress that would be expected from a free-thinking adult.

01:28:18.633 --> 01:28:20.094
They are scripted.

01:28:21.455 --> 01:28:27.601
That's why it's more like a dumb soap opera and you're just unable to watch all the episodes.

01:28:31.624 --> 01:28:52.003
Now I want to go back to a particular time in history because whether or not it's right whether I have moved back the timeline now we are back at 2019 when Barry Weiss the now editor of CBS News and say a former owner of the free press that sold for 150 million dollars

01:28:56.556 --> 01:29:01.321
This interview or the bit that I've cut out here is spectacular.

01:29:01.821 --> 01:29:06.205
What you need to see here is that this is January or February of 2019.

01:29:06.265 --> 01:29:21.100
This may be before the pandemic and the scripting of that narrative became obvious, was briefed to Joe Rogan.

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:31.171
Pay very close attention to the fact that he feels very Democrat, very left, very gay, very metro sexual.

01:29:32.612 --> 01:29:39.676
He's not the hardcore conservative guy that he will be in about half a year from now.

01:29:39.876 --> 01:29:45.260
Listen carefully because this is really the truth incarnate.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:45.660
You can see it.

01:29:51.684 --> 01:30:03.774
and whether or not it's right, whether or not we should have been there, and then whether or not there actually were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, whether or not we're in the business of nation building, whether or not Ron Paul is right, whether or not other people are right, who's right?

01:30:04.575 --> 01:30:10.299
The only way we're really gonna get a clear picture is to see a picture, to have an actual picture.

01:30:10.379 --> 01:30:16.904
Yeah, well that's why I've thought about this a lot, because right now I think in most Americans' minds it's like,

01:30:17.765 --> 01:30:19.587
The shooting happens, then it becomes a hashtag.

01:30:19.687 --> 01:30:27.193
Now, let's remind everybody, right, that there was this shooting in Pittsburgh at a synagogue where 11 people died and she's from Pittsburgh.

01:30:27.574 --> 01:30:30.636
And she apparently went to that synagogue when she was young.

01:30:31.857 --> 01:30:33.579
I'm not arguing with any of that history.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.726
I'm just saying that as a New York Times writer, they elevated her after that happened.

01:30:42.739 --> 01:30:47.083
It almost, maybe they scripted the shooting in Pittsburgh so that they could elevate her.

01:30:47.263 --> 01:30:48.585
I don't really know.

01:30:48.605 --> 01:30:50.406
I don't really care.

01:30:50.426 --> 01:30:53.630
I just know for sure that she's not an adult.

01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.692
She's a scripted actor.

01:30:56.813 --> 01:31:02.158
And at very, very best, she is a completely fraudulent adult.

01:31:03.234 --> 01:31:14.566
who doesn't belong in front of anyone, never mind in front of potentially hundreds of thousands of people on social media, masquerading as an adult with opinions that are informed.

01:31:15.848 --> 01:31:22.295
This is one of the absolutely most fraudulent and, quite frankly, shitty Americans on Earth.

01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:30.964
She makes Joe Rogan look quite tame because Joe Rogan doesn't claim to be anything more than a musclehead who likes to smoke pot.

01:31:31.424 --> 01:31:37.651
She claims to be a journalist with, you know, gold standard level of journalism kind of journalist.

01:31:37.811 --> 01:31:38.572
This is a joke.

01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:43.592
Then it becomes a t-shirt, then it becomes a memorial thing, a memorial concert.

01:31:43.652 --> 01:31:48.775
I mean it's like actually sickening, like the choreography of it.

01:31:49.655 --> 01:31:51.656
And I think what's lost is what it looks like.

01:31:52.237 --> 01:31:56.819
And this rabbi in Pittsburgh, who's really amazing, described to me what he saw.

01:31:57.819 --> 01:32:00.821
And I'll never forget just the description of what he told me.

01:32:01.587 --> 01:32:03.208
And I've wondered a lot.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:09.834
So I have to have pity for her as a Jew because she's been traumatized by a story that she heard from a fricking rabbi.

01:32:09.874 --> 01:32:12.296
You see how stupid this is in retrospect?

01:32:12.776 --> 01:32:15.478
Maybe in 2019, I would have been afraid to say that.

01:32:15.518 --> 01:32:17.180
But right now, I'm definitely not.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:26.968
In Pittsburgh, there are still people who have signs in their front lawn that are inspired by or there specifically because of this shooting.

01:32:28.086 --> 01:32:31.347
Make no mistake about it, people in Pittsburgh remember this shit.

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:38.089
So, I'm pissed because there was something that never felt real about it.

01:32:38.789 --> 01:32:42.870
There's nobody in Pittsburgh with a gun going to a synagogue.

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.310
That's just stupid.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.151
It doesn't even make any sense.

01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:48.811
Why would anybody do that?

01:32:50.912 --> 01:32:51.972
It's just dumb.

01:32:52.512 --> 01:32:54.233
It doesn't make any sense.

01:32:55.865 --> 01:32:58.866
You can't explain to me why somebody would do that.

01:33:03.928 --> 01:33:09.249
Wake of that and I'll think about it with the next shooting happens without a made a difference at all in terms of waking people up.

01:33:09.549 --> 01:33:12.510
What's fucked up as you said when the next shooting happens.

01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:13.371
Well that's what's fucked up.

01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:14.211
Well we know it will happen.

01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:14.711
Yeah.

01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:16.171
We know it will happen.

01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:16.331
Yeah.

01:33:19.372 --> 01:33:20.512
Yeah, why?

01:33:21.492 --> 01:33:23.113
He's so weak.

01:33:23.873 --> 01:33:24.813
Listen to him.

01:33:25.473 --> 01:33:27.133
He's like a girly man here.

01:33:28.414 --> 01:33:29.094
Why?

01:33:29.834 --> 01:33:38.675
Because there are a lot of guns in this country and people have access to those guns who are not only mentally unwell, sometimes they're just evil.

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:44.596
Aren't you afraid that people are going to use trucks to do the same thing then and cars to do the same thing?

01:33:44.636 --> 01:33:47.877
Aren't you worried about people using baseball bats to do the same thing?

01:33:49.642 --> 01:33:56.665
Because there are a lot of guns in the United States and people have access to them, that people are gonna do crazy shit?

01:33:56.885 --> 01:33:57.125
What?

01:33:58.785 --> 01:34:03.027
Isn't it first that people have to be crazy and have crazy ideas?

01:34:04.207 --> 01:34:14.051
People have to be motivated enough to take action, not just tweet or, you know, write a particularly mean post on Facebook, but actually get up, get in their car.

01:34:16.049 --> 01:34:17.390
This is so stupid.

01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:19.652
In retrospect, it's so stupid.

01:34:20.313 --> 01:34:26.578
And these two improvising actors have no idea what they're getting involved in.

01:34:26.818 --> 01:34:28.900
No idea what they are signing up for.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.862
They are so naive.

01:34:35.105 --> 01:34:35.966
They are criminals.

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:39.834
They want to kill people and they want to be famed.

01:34:39.854 --> 01:34:47.342
I mean, for a million reasons, but the fact that she knows this, the hell is going on here?

01:34:47.803 --> 01:34:49.345
This doesn't make any sense.

01:34:49.485 --> 01:34:56.433
People don't shoot people to be, to be famous unless they're in, in high school.

01:34:59.048 --> 01:35:06.531
adult single men over the age of 40 aren't sitting at home scheming who they could shoot so that they could become famous.

01:35:06.571 --> 01:35:12.774
That's just, that's just a stupid thing that she's learned from watching way too much TV.

01:35:14.454 --> 01:35:21.797
We are living in a culture that seems to worship people's freedom to own those weapons more than human life seems crazy to me.

01:35:22.738 --> 01:35:23.258
It really does.

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:26.039
I get what you're saying.

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:28.120
The argument against that would be

01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:31.514
Remember, this is the gunman, right?

01:35:31.574 --> 01:35:33.076
This is the bow and arrow man.

01:35:33.137 --> 01:35:43.692
This is the shot, a bow and arrow, a fricking broadhead at the side of a stainless steel truck and was surprised it didn't go through.

01:35:47.077 --> 01:36:04.362
he's really grinding a lot because his eyes are always looking up he's really thinking oh boy this is really hard this girl's really pushing my pushing my limits here my intellectual i'm just steaming my freaking diodes this look look the real crazies believe that these things are happening

01:36:05.242 --> 01:36:09.224
And that they're happening because of the fact the real crazy so in 2019.

01:36:09.484 --> 01:36:19.569
He wasn't a real crazy I thought in 2013 He was already a real crazy when he was joe rogan joe rogan questions everything

01:36:22.148 --> 01:36:23.509
the government wants to take away our guns.

01:36:24.209 --> 01:36:25.470
This is the real crazies.

01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.251
Explain that, I'm not sure I follow.

01:36:27.371 --> 01:36:36.117
That they are making these people... The real crazies think that there are false flag shootings so that they can justify taking away guns.

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:40.600
Oh, those are crazy people, says Joe Rogan.

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:42.201
Stop lying!

01:36:43.181 --> 01:36:44.522
Stop lying!

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:50.406
I mean, that's some rich shit in 2019 coming from this scripted asshole.

01:36:52.082 --> 01:37:11.384
If you're familiar with who he is now, and you're not familiar with what he sounds like right here in 2019, then right now, you should be having a little bit of a, in your head, a little bit of a, because two gears have now started to turn in opposite direction and the teeth are breaking.

01:37:13.117 --> 01:37:16.698
because this jackass will say whatever he's scripted to say.

01:37:17.758 --> 01:37:32.083
And in 2019, he was still kind of a muscly, lefty, softy, kind of gay, metrosexual, not really sure how conservative he is kind of guy.

01:37:34.721 --> 01:37:35.602
people do these things.

01:37:35.922 --> 01:37:36.503
The government?

01:37:36.743 --> 01:37:55.180
That the worst aspects of our society, whatever, you know, fill in the blank with whatever left-wing conspiracy, that, you know, whatever person, whatever boogeyman, George Soros, whatever the fuck the boogeyman is, that whatever boogeyman or cabal of boogey people

01:37:56.092 --> 01:38:02.483
that they are somehow or another either using the like Manchurian candidate type.

01:38:02.723 --> 01:38:06.049
Remember he's the one who started Epstein didn't kill himself.

01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:07.291
You know that right?

01:38:07.532 --> 01:38:08.193
Joe Rogan.

01:38:10.896 --> 01:38:12.456
influence, whatever the fuck they're doing.

01:38:12.476 --> 01:38:18.497
They're getting people to do this and then even creating false flags where these things didn't happen.

01:38:18.757 --> 01:38:30.420
So they wouldn't create false anti-vax groups in order to create useless opposition to health freedom and to public health to get ready for a pandemic.

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.740
They wouldn't create all kinds of front groups.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.340
No, no, no.

01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:35.661
It's just this stuff.

01:38:35.921 --> 01:38:37.261
Oh wow, false flags.

01:38:37.421 --> 01:38:38.401
So they can take away guns.

01:38:38.461 --> 01:38:39.882
This is the, I mean, look.

01:38:39.902 --> 01:38:41.302
But this is like swamp terror.

01:38:41.322 --> 01:38:42.583
This is like Pizzagate.

01:38:42.603 --> 01:38:42.863
It is.

01:38:43.003 --> 01:38:43.323
You're right.

01:38:43.423 --> 01:38:43.683
It is.

01:38:43.843 --> 01:38:44.103
It is.

01:38:44.323 --> 01:38:46.064
It is dumb, but it's real.

01:38:46.764 --> 01:39:01.869
It's real in terms of the influence that it has, that people actually do believe that there are these false flag events that they're designing to get your guns, that people are training people to go out and kill a bunch of people so they can take away your guns.

01:39:02.409 --> 01:39:06.352
So it makes them more rabid about their support of the Second Amendment.

01:39:06.632 --> 01:39:09.615
And they feel like they're being attacked on all sides.

01:39:09.635 --> 01:39:10.596
It's very strange.

01:39:10.616 --> 01:39:11.877
Have you had Merkel-Schermer on here?

01:39:12.017 --> 01:39:13.258
Yes, recently, last week.

01:39:13.278 --> 01:39:14.499
Oh, good.

01:39:14.999 --> 01:39:18.622
The mindset of the conspiracy thinker is totally fascinating to me.

01:39:18.662 --> 01:39:30.171
Now, don't forget, earlier this year, he had Ian Carroll on, and he opened the show with, why do we like conspiracies so much, Ian?

01:39:33.212 --> 01:39:35.333
Oh my gosh, this is awful.

01:39:37.354 --> 01:39:37.614
It is.

01:39:38.034 --> 01:39:40.996
Mick West is actually just as good or even better.

01:39:41.076 --> 01:39:42.036
He runs Metabunk.

01:39:42.737 --> 01:39:44.057
He's a fascinating guy.

01:39:44.137 --> 01:39:45.698
I used to do this show.

01:39:45.838 --> 01:39:49.260
I did the show for a while on sci-fi called Joe Rogan questions everything.

01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:53.282
And one of the things that we went into was why people believe in chemtrails.

01:39:53.682 --> 01:40:00.145
Why people believe that the heat of jet engines, which causes these artificial clouds when it interacts with condensation in the atmosphere and creates

01:40:00.445 --> 01:40:01.747
you know, it creates artificial clouds.

01:40:01.767 --> 01:40:02.488
You see contrails.

01:40:02.728 --> 01:40:02.928
Yes.

01:40:03.329 --> 01:40:16.084
Some people believe that these are, that someone's spraying something and that this weather control from these commercial jets that they're, you know, somehow Joe Rogan believes that in 2025, my friends.

01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:19.590
Like, come on!

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:25.859
There's this gigantic conspiracy of all these people involved and that... Don't forget that Mary Holland believes it.

01:40:25.979 --> 01:40:27.221
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:40:27.261 --> 01:40:27.822
believes it.

01:40:27.882 --> 01:40:30.886
There are even papers out there that make other people believe it.

01:40:31.487 --> 01:40:33.089
It's just that in 2019, it was still ridiculous.

01:40:37.367 --> 01:40:40.469
In 2019, he wasn't Joe Rogan questioning everything.

01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:45.250
That was just a show he did on sci-fi in the late 20s.

01:40:46.351 --> 01:40:48.352
Holy balls is this bad.

01:40:49.032 --> 01:40:50.512
He is such a fraud.

01:40:50.773 --> 01:40:52.773
This is, in some way,

01:40:54.534 --> 01:40:58.900
They're either doing weather control, or they're controlling us, or mind control.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.801
It depends on who you ask.

01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:01.023
Clearly.

01:41:01.444 --> 01:41:03.607
But Mick had a really interesting way of discussing it.

01:41:03.847 --> 01:41:07.392
And one of the things that he said is this is like the training wheels for conspiracy theory.

01:41:07.412 --> 01:41:08.794
Because you see it in the sky.

01:41:08.814 --> 01:41:09.555
Like, look, there it is.

01:41:09.935 --> 01:41:10.596
I don't remember that.

01:41:10.796 --> 01:41:16.902
You know, there's photographs from World War II where you can see, from the 1940s, you can see contrails in the sky that look just like the ones up here.

01:41:17.262 --> 01:41:19.404
But people will say, I don't remember those when we were kids.

01:41:19.744 --> 01:41:21.346
And people will go, yeah, yeah, I don't.

01:41:21.606 --> 01:41:25.370
And then it starts fueling this paranoid idea that there's this problem.

01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:29.033
So it's not social media that's fueling this idea.

01:41:29.153 --> 01:41:31.335
It's not the sort of

01:41:32.196 --> 01:41:39.322
pushing this idea, algorithmically programming it into people's feeds so that they're all made to question.

01:41:39.362 --> 01:41:40.423
It couldn't be that.

01:41:41.024 --> 01:41:45.948
It's just that people like conspiracies, and these conspiracies are like training wheels for worse ones.

01:41:46.028 --> 01:41:46.909
Program going on.

01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:54.856
And then there are real programs that the government is considering to combat global warming, where they talked about this in the 70s and the 80s.

01:41:54.896 --> 01:41:55.276
They talked about

01:41:57.718 --> 01:41:59.259
reflective particles in the atmosphere.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.964
I think when they were concerned that the ozone layer was, man, I'm almost in the 80s, it probably was later than that.

01:42:05.204 --> 01:42:11.789
But even more recently, they've talked about suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere to protect it, but it'd be very different.

01:42:11.989 --> 01:42:14.551
But why do people believe conspiracy theories?

01:42:14.631 --> 01:42:19.394
What is it in the nature of certain people that I'm just so fascinated by it?

01:42:19.495 --> 01:42:23.698
They're old enough to understand that people lie in groups.

01:42:25.111 --> 01:42:29.395
They're old enough to understand that people lie in groups.

01:42:31.117 --> 01:42:33.559
That people without morals lie together.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.164
That on a national security level lies are told all the time.

01:42:38.624 --> 01:42:44.249
This is a child and she is being screened or auditioning.

01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:54.806
screened is a better word for possible role in this scripted podcast bullshit narrative and she was selected.

01:42:55.347 --> 01:42:56.789
That's why in 2025 we are where we are.

01:42:59.850 --> 01:43:00.590
That's a good question.

01:43:00.670 --> 01:43:01.571
That's what I was going to ask you.

01:43:01.591 --> 01:43:03.191
I don't know.

01:43:03.291 --> 01:43:16.795
When you see it from the outside, when you see something like the most horrific ones, like Sandy Hook, like Sandy Hook being a false flag, what would be the motivation for someone saying that?

01:43:17.215 --> 01:43:18.336
What would be the motivation?

01:43:19.916 --> 01:43:22.877
His best friend Alex Jones said that.

01:43:24.554 --> 01:43:27.536
What would be the motivation for somebody saying it's a false flag?

01:43:27.556 --> 01:43:31.278
What a stupid question that is.

01:43:31.518 --> 01:43:33.899
She's being screened.

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.921
She's auditioning for a role in this show.

01:43:39.182 --> 01:43:42.444
In the Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, shithead show.

01:43:47.628 --> 01:43:53.631
capturing an audience, like getting people to believe in you as some seer behind the veil.

01:43:53.871 --> 01:43:58.033
Yeah, but that's only the people that are projecting this in terms of in the media.

01:43:58.073 --> 01:43:59.314
I'm talking about like an Alex Jones.

01:43:59.334 --> 01:44:00.555
Like, why does he say that?

01:44:01.195 --> 01:44:03.616
My question is, why do other people think it?

01:44:03.876 --> 01:44:04.797
Why do they look for it?

01:44:05.517 --> 01:44:07.098
Not a person who's profiting off of it.

01:44:07.118 --> 01:44:12.541
I think that's, I think the reason people look to conspiracy theories is that the world is

01:44:16.598 --> 01:44:25.824
deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic and people are desperate for a system of understanding the world.

01:44:26.685 --> 01:44:33.870
And conspiracy theories often seem to like... Conspiracy theory is like a vaccine.

01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:45.418
It's a very shitty, aspecific term that could describe a story that's completely made up or it could describe a very accurate description of a network of people working together.

01:44:47.418 --> 01:44:49.780
That's the problem with conspiracy theories.

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.882
Depending on the context, it could mean anything.

01:44:53.663 --> 01:44:55.985
Just like vaccine could mean anything.

01:44:56.025 --> 01:44:58.327
It could mean a transfection.

01:44:58.787 --> 01:44:59.728
It could mean a pill.

01:45:03.731 --> 01:45:05.512
And so this is the trap.

01:45:06.853 --> 01:45:13.759
It is a largely semantic one where the terms that they use make arguments impossible.

01:45:14.755 --> 01:45:24.382
The definitions are so watery, watered down, or diluted that you can't actually argue about anything.

01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:34.008
Arguing about autism spectrum disorder and its causes is just as dumb as this discussion that they're having right now.

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:42.274
It doesn't contain the specific terms necessary to make decisions about yes and no.

01:45:45.034 --> 01:46:01.843
offer a very, very actually like an incredibly simplistic explanation, which is there's this secret thing, like there's always a secret thing that... I mean, she believes, right, that people just hate Jews so much that sometimes they just decide, you know what, I can't take it anymore.

01:46:01.923 --> 01:46:08.486
I'm going to buy a gun and I'm going to a synagogue and I'm going to kill everybody I can at the synagogue.

01:46:09.739 --> 01:46:15.781
She believes that she's on this fricking show specifically to say that.

01:46:16.622 --> 01:46:27.706
She believes there is a multi-generational conspiracy against Jews that makes people in America spontaneously murderous.

01:46:33.237 --> 01:46:35.560
is a plan that the public doesn't know about, generally.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:37.803
But the real thing is that no one really is at the wheel.

01:46:38.364 --> 01:46:38.604
Yeah.

01:46:38.964 --> 01:46:39.185
Yes.

01:46:39.265 --> 01:46:43.370
The real thing is that, I mean, haven't we learned that from the Trump presidency?

01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:45.913
No one is really at the wheel.

01:46:45.973 --> 01:46:48.937
Haven't we learned that from the Trump presidency?

01:46:53.348 --> 01:46:54.029
See the lie?

01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:56.030
No one's at the wheel.

01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:58.631
No one's responsible for this.

01:46:59.051 --> 01:47:02.233
These Christian nationalists are out of our control.

01:47:02.733 --> 01:47:03.994
These people are nuts.

01:47:04.534 --> 01:47:07.916
I don't know who Antifa is, but they sure are a problem.

01:47:08.396 --> 01:47:14.819
See, right?

01:47:14.859 --> 01:47:17.621
Like, institutions are just made up of people.

01:47:18.891 --> 01:47:30.155
Like, they can fall apart if the people that take them over are irresponsible, crazy, venal, narcissistic, everything that we're seeing in the Trump administration.

01:47:31.356 --> 01:47:35.777
Oh, so it's all of that that makes the Trump administration fall apart.

01:47:36.218 --> 01:47:38.018
It couldn't just be a big act.

01:47:40.379 --> 01:47:42.240
It couldn't just have been a big fake.

01:47:45.578 --> 01:47:47.198
We have them now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:47:47.638 --> 01:47:59.341
And these two scripted actors in 2019 are trying to pretend that the Donald Trump administration is out of their control doing things that they don't have control over.

01:47:59.401 --> 01:48:07.922
Nobody has control over because it's just an egoistic, selfish, crazy, narcissistic minds, you know, wow.

01:48:08.962 --> 01:48:09.522
It's awesome.

01:48:10.603 --> 01:48:12.223
It's fantastic if you see it.

01:48:13.595 --> 01:48:21.140
How can we have an improvisational comedy routine discussion scripted about the current events?

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.481
What do we want people to come away with?

01:48:23.942 --> 01:48:26.203
What messages do we want them to understand?

01:48:26.864 --> 01:48:31.967
Trump is an independent actor that none of us can really understand.

01:48:36.650 --> 01:48:42.954
But isn't that kind of, it's weirdly, I mean it's both terrifying but also comforting.

01:48:44.255 --> 01:48:44.575
I think.

01:48:46.056 --> 01:48:49.998
If it's just people, people can also change it.

01:48:50.998 --> 01:48:54.139
It's not like there's a secret hand that we need to get to.

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:59.222
So it can't be a group of people coordinatedly lying.

01:48:59.602 --> 01:49:04.304
It couldn't be a bunch of national security actors that are put in place on purpose because

01:49:04.824 --> 01:49:12.290
Having a randomly functioning national security state called the United States of America isn't allowed.

01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:13.251
It's not possible.

01:49:13.631 --> 01:49:27.542
We can't just have 11 aircraft carriers out there doing whatever the people on the aircraft carrier want to do at that time, shooting or bombing whoever they want to, flying planes here, landing ships there.

01:49:28.223 --> 01:49:29.544
That can't be the case.

01:49:31.069 --> 01:49:37.653
We certainly can't have a bunch of random people with big egos running the nuclear weapons of the United States.

01:49:39.654 --> 01:49:44.496
Why do we have 700 military bases around the world if it's not to move things?

01:49:46.657 --> 01:49:56.803
If it's not to move people, if it's not moving information, if it's not moving wealth and money and power, why would we have all those military bases in all those places otherwise?

01:49:57.924 --> 01:50:05.129
other than to have sovereign soil and all those places through which we can move anything we want under guard.

01:50:08.331 --> 01:50:13.614
Ladies and gentlemen, the national security state of the United States of America would love you to believe

01:50:14.446 --> 01:50:30.354
that it is wholly out of the control of the United States population and actually out of the control of the Congress and out of the control of the President because all of these foreign powers are able to control the United States government and all the people in it.

01:50:32.214 --> 01:50:33.055
She believes that.

01:50:34.315 --> 01:50:39.538
She probably, to a certain extent, understands how it could be, to a certain extent, accomplished.

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:43.356
but it is through a conspiracy.

01:50:43.416 --> 01:50:50.819
It is through people conspiring together, most of the time to say one thing in public and another in private.

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.301
Why do we like conspiracies?

01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:56.882
Because we know they exist.

01:50:58.463 --> 01:51:02.344
Santa Claus is a freaking conspiracy against kids, for goodness sakes.

01:51:03.985 --> 01:51:05.786
Lucian, elect better people.

01:51:07.517 --> 01:51:11.579
Do you think that this such as it is this constant conflict?

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:12.500
There it is.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:16.402
The national security state is not leaving elections open to chance.

01:51:17.643 --> 01:51:21.405
The national security state is not leaving elections open to chance.

01:51:22.325 --> 01:51:23.746
So they're perpetuating a myth.

01:51:24.407 --> 01:51:25.147
That's bullshit.

01:51:25.576 --> 01:51:35.582
this social conflict that we're involved in right now, the woke left and the alt-right and all this jazz, that the boiling of it right now will eventually boil down to something more rational.

01:51:35.962 --> 01:51:43.166
Because it seems like if you read Steven Pinker's work and people that study... Steven Pinker?

01:51:44.127 --> 01:51:46.128
The guy who's been to Epstein Island?

01:51:46.769 --> 01:51:47.149
Wow!

01:51:48.106 --> 01:52:08.105
Violence and in danger and society over the course of history that we're we're certainly on an upward trend even though All the data shows that no one's denying that there's some awful aspects to our culture today and society and crime and violence and in fill-in-the-blank and wealth disparity and yes, all those things exist, but

01:52:08.846 --> 01:52:20.171
There's more understanding of that, there's more awareness of that, and there's certainly a safer world today than was 100, 200 years ago in terms of your own existence.

01:52:20.191 --> 01:52:21.232
Well, just think about my life.

01:52:21.372 --> 01:52:29.455
I am a woman who can walk down the street of almost any American city with all the privileges that I have granted.

01:52:31.116 --> 01:52:31.576
Unharmed.

01:52:31.856 --> 01:52:34.437
Yes, that's a miracle in human history.

01:52:34.697 --> 01:52:39.098
It is like there's one day I was at the beach and I was like, oh I'm just like sitting here in a bathing suit.

01:52:39.318 --> 01:52:40.158
No one's coming up to me.

01:52:40.439 --> 01:52:43.979
No one's harassing me How many parts of the world could I do that in right?

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:52.782
You know like I try and keep that in mind when I'm Falling into despair about where we are as a country where I'm like, oh actually in a lot of ways it's still like

01:52:53.562 --> 01:52:55.684
the best thing of the worst things.

01:52:55.904 --> 01:52:57.505
It's the best thing in history so far.

01:52:57.525 --> 01:52:58.986
It's certainly for women.

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:09.033
So I try and kind of keep that in mind when I'm losing myself to feelings, to fears that things are gonna get worse before they get better, which is what I think.

01:53:10.234 --> 01:53:14.277
I have, she's so insightful.

01:53:15.338 --> 01:53:18.741
Little does she know she's gonna be the head of CBS News in a few years.

01:53:19.631 --> 01:53:38.108
all daughters and I have friends that are women and I have a lot of friends that are women in the world of stand-up comedy and I oftentimes see misogynist shit online that shocks me and one of the things that shocked me was there's a guy that I follow

01:53:39.266 --> 01:53:48.509
And he was talking about how his wife, it was a thread on Twitter, well thought out, very smart guy, he's a lawyer, and he was talking about how his wife's gas tank is always empty.

01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:50.970
It's like every time he gets in his wife's car, she's always out of gas.

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.651
He's like, what the fuck?

01:53:51.931 --> 01:53:53.071
Why do I always have to get gas for you?

01:53:53.571 --> 01:54:00.254
And then she explained she doesn't like to park to get gas because she gets harassed and it creeps her out.

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.682
And it's like a man would never think about that.

01:54:03.942 --> 01:54:10.746
Not only would men never think about that, the messages he was getting from men calling him a cock.

01:54:11.066 --> 01:54:11.767
What?

01:54:12.187 --> 01:54:14.429
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:54:14.929 --> 01:54:20.272
I mean, I'm an idiot that I didn't think darkly enough because of course it was going to go there, right, of course.

01:54:20.393 --> 01:54:22.674
And he told me direct messages, getting direct messages.

01:54:22.714 --> 01:54:23.374
People, you know.

01:54:24.315 --> 01:54:25.916
saying all kinds of crazy shit to him.

01:54:26.296 --> 01:54:38.583
Because they not only are they in denial that this could be a situation where their mother was in or their wife or their daughter, maybe they don't have a daughter, maybe they have a bad relationship with their mother.

01:54:38.924 --> 01:54:40.965
Maybe they just they've had so many bad, you know,

01:54:41.425 --> 01:54:52.011
If a guy's had so many bad interactions with women and he's not very smart and he's just decided that women are evil and you see anything that's like saying, hey guys, maybe we should look at it in terms of like how the woman looks at it.

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:53.392
Fuck you.

01:54:53.692 --> 01:54:54.553
Like that's real.

01:54:54.673 --> 01:54:56.314
Those guys are real and they're out there.

01:54:57.274 --> 01:54:58.115
I was at a gas station.

01:54:58.135 --> 01:54:59.296
That's real.

01:54:59.476 --> 01:55:03.438
Those guys are out there and they're called, they're called like,

01:55:04.051 --> 01:55:06.753
like, like incels or something.

01:55:07.093 --> 01:55:07.853
I'm sure of it.

01:55:07.893 --> 01:55:09.074
They're real, man.

01:55:09.434 --> 01:55:10.755
They're totally real.

01:55:10.815 --> 01:55:20.381
The other night at two o'clock in the morning, I was coming home from the Comedy Store and I pulled into this gas station and there was this guy, you know, they have that bulletproof thing with this thick glass and the guy's talking.

01:55:20.881 --> 01:55:24.483
I'm using my credit card and this guy's trying to use his debit card.

01:55:25.164 --> 01:55:28.786
And I pull in, I get out of my car and I hear yelling.

01:55:29.366 --> 01:55:31.668
And I hear him going, hey, bro, relax.

01:55:31.889 --> 01:55:34.011
You're not a fucking bank teller, all right?

01:55:34.291 --> 01:55:35.973
He goes, you're taking this job so seriously.

01:55:35.993 --> 01:55:37.354
You make $10 an hour.

01:55:37.795 --> 01:55:38.695
And the guy says something.

01:55:38.715 --> 01:55:39.416
There's no money on the card.

01:55:39.436 --> 01:55:40.017
He's like, fuck you.

01:55:40.237 --> 01:55:42.439
There's $800 on this card.

01:55:42.679 --> 01:55:44.281
And his friend from the car is saying something.

01:55:44.301 --> 01:55:46.884
And I am nervous, OK?

01:55:46.984 --> 01:55:47.284
I'm nervous.

01:55:47.304 --> 01:55:47.484
Really?

01:55:47.604 --> 01:55:47.844
Yes.

01:55:48.105 --> 01:55:49.046
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

01:55:49.206 --> 01:55:49.706
I'm nervous.

01:55:50.787 --> 01:55:55.010
And I'm like fuck and I'm like, what if this guy turns any of this aggression on me?

01:55:55.310 --> 01:56:06.398
What if he decides I mean he's a fucking asshole and he's probably drunk or high or something and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and It's him and there's another guy in the car and I'm so nervous.

01:56:06.418 --> 01:56:07.679
I'm like humiliating the guy who works.

01:56:07.719 --> 01:56:07.979
Yes.

01:56:08.259 --> 01:56:12.782
Yes There's a bank teller on duty at 2 in the morning.

01:56:12.943 --> 01:56:15.825
Something is not making any sense right now

01:56:16.525 --> 01:56:19.468
And I'm so nervous that I'm thinking of cutting my pump short.

01:56:19.528 --> 01:56:23.431
I'm thinking of just don't get a full tank, just get five bucks and get the fuck out of here.

01:56:23.451 --> 01:56:25.753
You know, don't run out of gas, but let's just get the fuck out of here.

01:56:25.773 --> 01:56:26.654
We'll get the gas tomorrow.

01:56:26.714 --> 01:56:27.294
Seriously?

01:56:27.394 --> 01:56:32.098
Joe Rogan got afraid at a gas station because somebody was yelling and screaming.

01:56:32.519 --> 01:56:34.640
He didn't want to help the cashier.

01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:39.024
He didn't want to chill it out a little bit because he's such a tough guy.

01:56:39.404 --> 01:56:43.248
He was only going to buy $5 and then he was getting out of there, man.

01:56:45.956 --> 01:56:47.277
This is awesome.

01:56:48.798 --> 01:56:52.761
Oh my gosh, what a fraud this guy is.

01:56:53.642 --> 01:56:57.725
During the daylight, and I'm a man, and I'm looking at these two guys, and I'm saying, okay.

01:56:57.745 --> 01:57:00.187
He's a very, very short man.

01:57:00.207 --> 01:57:08.073
Okay, if some shit goes down, if these guys don't have a weapon, if some shit goes down, I'm gonna beat the fuck out of these two guys.

01:57:08.153 --> 01:57:12.617
They look skinny, they look like they don't exercise, but they're aggressive, they're angry, they're stupid.

01:57:13.237 --> 01:57:14.098
I'm like, God damn it.

01:57:14.419 --> 01:57:17.224
Like all my spidey senses are going, get out of here.

01:57:17.544 --> 01:57:18.626
Go get out of here.

01:57:18.926 --> 01:57:21.871
And like an asshole, I decided to stay and pump my gas.

01:57:22.833 --> 01:57:34.275
But when these guys are yelling at each other, I literally went around the front of the car instead of this back way, because it was a shorter path for me being exposed to their view.

01:57:34.295 --> 01:57:39.876
So I'm hiding behind my truck while I'm filling my tank, and I'm a man who could kill these two guys.

01:57:40.076 --> 01:57:44.497
Right, I honestly thought where this story was gonna go is that you were gonna go over and tell them to shut up.

01:57:44.517 --> 01:57:46.637
I was thinking of going over there, but I didn't wanna get shot.

01:57:46.657 --> 01:57:49.218
And I'm thinking, what if, this is how people die.

01:57:49.558 --> 01:57:51.298
I know, second amendment joke.

01:57:52.078 --> 01:57:53.359
He can't carry a gun.

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:54.360
He smokes weed.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.601
He has weed in his car.

01:57:55.641 --> 01:57:57.463
He can't carry a gun.

01:57:58.544 --> 01:58:00.766
That's trouble in Texas for him.

01:58:01.706 --> 01:58:03.388
But also you can get knifed.

01:58:03.408 --> 01:58:04.869
You can get hit in the head with a pipe.

01:58:04.929 --> 01:58:09.153
But isn't that an insane thing that you have to worry that you're gonna get shot at a gas station?

01:58:09.193 --> 01:58:11.835
Maybe the thing to do would have been just call the cops.

01:58:13.116 --> 01:58:15.078
Help the guy at the gas station out.

01:58:15.798 --> 01:58:19.802
These people are so sad

01:58:20.802 --> 01:58:23.263
in the way that they interact with strangers.

01:58:23.343 --> 01:58:25.164
It's not a fellow citizen.

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:29.125
It's not a concerned citizen or an upset citizen.

01:58:29.585 --> 01:58:34.927
It's a potential criminal and a murderer and a stabber and a violent guy.

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.408
I don't know what he's talking about.

01:58:36.448 --> 01:58:38.068
He said they were two skinny dudes.

01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:43.631
Like, this is just dramatic for the sake of being dramatic.

01:58:43.671 --> 01:58:49.993
And it's sad because it's not the Joe Rogan of 2025 because that's not the character he's asked to play now in this time.

01:58:51.587 --> 01:58:53.148
It is but it's not just shot.

01:58:53.188 --> 01:59:08.172
It's just violence in general and I know and I'm a martial arts expert so I'm less worried than most men and Certainly way less worried than a woman if I was a woman and I pulled up and I heard that guy going fuck you make $10 an hour bro fucking relax.

01:59:08.212 --> 01:59:16.514
I'd be like, oh get me the fuck out of here I was on fumes though has raising two daughters made you so much more aware of this stuff a hundred percent.

01:59:16.554 --> 01:59:16.734
Yeah, I

01:59:16.994 --> 01:59:19.517
And also just raising babies, even if they were boys.

01:59:19.537 --> 01:59:21.739
I realize that people are babies now.

01:59:22.199 --> 01:59:24.381
I used to think of people as being in a static state.

01:59:24.681 --> 01:59:25.802
How old are you?

01:59:25.822 --> 01:59:25.802
34.

01:59:25.923 --> 01:59:27.864
I meet you, I go, oh, 34-year-old person.

01:59:27.904 --> 01:59:29.106
This is a 34-year-old person.

01:59:29.126 --> 01:59:30.407
I didn't meet you and think.

01:59:31.568 --> 01:59:35.391
In the past, I would have met you and only thought of you as a 34-year-old person.

01:59:35.872 --> 01:59:37.814
Now I look at everyone.

01:59:38.494 --> 01:59:39.915
by default as a baby.

01:59:40.276 --> 01:59:41.797
That's how I process things.

01:59:42.277 --> 01:59:47.282
And it made me way more compassionate, way more understanding, and way more patient with people.

01:59:47.522 --> 01:59:54.928
Because now I say, okay, when I meet this asshole at the gas station two o'clock in the morning that's berating that guy, well, why is he?

01:59:54.968 --> 01:59:57.510
Well, because probably his dad's a fucking piece of shit.

01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:01.133
Oh, so now he's rationalizing, he's not scared anymore.

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:03.054
This doesn't come off.

02:00:03.955 --> 02:00:05.837
as truthful at all.

02:00:06.337 --> 02:00:10.401
This comes off as improvisational bullshit.

02:00:10.921 --> 02:00:15.665
And when you're improvising, sometimes you contradict what you said 10 minutes ago.

02:00:16.165 --> 02:00:17.206
His life probably sucks.

02:00:17.226 --> 02:00:18.107
He's probably dumb.

02:00:18.407 --> 02:00:20.169
He's probably been on drugs since he was young.

02:00:20.389 --> 02:00:21.670
He doesn't have any smart friends.

02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:23.071
They don't have any money to get gas.

02:00:23.091 --> 02:00:23.912
It's two o'clock in the morning.

02:00:23.932 --> 02:00:25.173
They're making poor life choices.

02:00:25.513 --> 02:00:26.654
There's a lot wrong here.

02:00:26.894 --> 02:00:28.354
He doesn't have any discipline in his life.

02:00:28.574 --> 02:00:32.596
He's never gone through any sort of trials and tribulations that taught him about things.

02:00:32.616 --> 02:00:36.277
He didn't receive life lessons, probably didn't get a good education.

02:00:36.617 --> 02:00:41.078
Here we are, and I might have to kick this guy's ass, because it's two o'clock in the morning, and he's threatening.

02:00:41.138 --> 02:00:45.059
He's loud, and he's probably going to be loud to other people, look at him the wrong way.

02:00:45.319 --> 02:00:47.220
He's just fucking toxically stupid.

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.081
But it was a baby.

02:00:49.261 --> 02:00:50.442
He was a baby at one point in time.

02:00:50.563 --> 02:01:11.364
So I don't want to go over there I don't want to I don't want to create violence I'm thinking he's just gonna drive away and eventually he did and that poor guy who probably is probably that's a really bad way to think about adults adults have Responsibility for what they do and what they say and it doesn't matter how they got to be an adult or how tough it was for them They are adults

02:01:16.656 --> 02:01:18.798
This is not a nice way to think about people.

02:01:18.878 --> 02:01:20.559
It's a dumb way to think about people.

02:01:20.639 --> 02:01:22.260
You should be requiring people.

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:28.104
You should be requiring people to be held.

02:01:28.185 --> 02:01:31.227
You should hold people to the highest standard possible.

02:01:31.987 --> 02:01:34.069
And you should hold yourself to that standard too.

02:01:35.472 --> 02:01:50.624
This is just ridiculous making just a little bit more than $10 an hour is stuck in this fucking cubicle this little glass box With this asshole berating him at 2 o'clock in the morning, but that's a baby that guy was a baby my what my my

02:01:51.903 --> 02:02:03.228
except not acceptance, but my Curiosity with socialism my real curiosity with any socialist ideas is how do we recognize the fact that some people?

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:10.672
Are dealt the shittiest of shitty hand of cards and that there's entire sections of cities

02:02:11.232 --> 02:02:30.694
where everyone has a shit hand of cards and some some make it out through basketball and football and sports and rap music and whatever but that whole spot sucks the whole spot sucks the aberrations the the few that make it out that's not indicative of that this is a good place and these people just need to pull themselves up by the bootstraps

02:02:31.135 --> 02:02:36.276
is that some salmon make it up this crazy waterfall and the grizzly bears don't eat them.

02:02:36.696 --> 02:02:41.337
It doesn't mean that the waterfall is safe for salmon and the salmon that get bit are a bunch of pussies.

02:02:41.957 --> 02:02:43.838
This is chaos.

02:02:44.798 --> 02:02:54.260
The fact that we don't address that and that our civilization just plows on with the same stupid path that we've had for decades, regardless of the fact that we have- Are you hearing it?

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:56.360
Are you hearing it yet?

02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:00.121
He's not the conservative Ivermectin guy.

02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:03.131
He's not.

02:03:03.852 --> 02:03:07.734
He was asked to play that role for a little while, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:03:07.794 --> 02:03:16.820
was, just like Brian Hooker was, just like Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone were, just like Jay Bhattacharya has been, just like Marty McCary was.

02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:25.846
They auditioned, they got selected, and then they were put in place and enacted a theater that seems to make it seem like something real has happened and led to 2025.

02:03:27.327 --> 02:03:54.169
when in fact it was an elaborate hoax of longest con of an absolute understanding of the the complete inequality of the the real ghettos of our country whether it's the south side of chicago or whether it's baltimore wherever it is we have a real understanding of this this isn't this isn't guesswork we really know and we don't do a goddamn thing about it that's what makes me want to embrace some aspects of socialism the fact that i know it's not fair it's not fair

02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:57.652
I didn't have a great childhood, but it wasn't bad.

02:03:58.193 --> 02:03:58.673
I got through.

02:03:58.713 --> 02:03:59.014
I'm fine.

02:03:59.034 --> 02:03:59.634
Nobody shot me.

02:04:00.195 --> 02:04:00.816
Nobody raped me.

02:04:01.076 --> 02:04:01.977
I got through.

02:04:02.237 --> 02:04:05.841
It could have been way worse, and it is way worse for many, many people.

02:04:06.121 --> 02:04:12.527
So all these pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps assholes, the other thing I notice about them is they're rarely really successful.

02:04:13.368 --> 02:04:20.210
They really rarely are these pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps people, people who have accomplished anything extraordinary.

02:04:20.791 --> 02:04:21.951
It's just like an idea.

02:04:24.332 --> 02:04:29.034
It's a simplistic ideology that they've sort of subscribed to.

02:04:29.634 --> 02:04:32.615
But I thought Elon Musk was like super brilliant.

02:04:32.675 --> 02:04:37.236
I thought he was a pull-your-up-by-yourself-by-your-bootstraps kind of guy because he's so smart.

02:04:37.277 --> 02:04:38.337
You should have AOC on.

02:04:39.477 --> 02:04:40.517
I would love to.

02:04:40.617 --> 02:04:42.018
Her and I have gone back and forth on Twitter.

02:04:42.158 --> 02:04:44.458
Yeah, that would be really interesting to listen to.

02:04:44.478 --> 02:04:45.259
Plus, she's so young.

02:04:45.279 --> 02:04:46.539
I'm so interested in her.

02:04:46.559 --> 02:04:47.799
Yeah, she's 28 years old.

02:04:47.819 --> 02:04:48.779
I mean, that's amazing.

02:04:48.999 --> 02:04:49.960
The whole thing's amazing.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:50.840
She's just fascinating.

02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:52.220
You should have her on.

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:56.041
She's amazing!

02:04:56.181 --> 02:04:57.942
Wow, that is hilarious.

02:04:58.462 --> 02:04:58.682
Wow.

02:04:59.102 --> 02:05:01.743
She was getting a hard time because they found a video.

02:05:01.983 --> 02:05:03.023
They thought they were going to get her.

02:05:03.164 --> 02:05:05.624
They found a video of her in college dancing.

02:05:05.864 --> 02:05:06.965
Yeah, but you know what?

02:05:07.405 --> 02:05:09.186
Everyone loved that video.

02:05:09.226 --> 02:05:13.747
The whole narrative that some random person on Twitter put that video out.

02:05:14.047 --> 02:05:17.669
Right, but the point is they did it because they thought they were going to shame her.

02:05:18.049 --> 02:05:20.069
They're idiots.

02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:21.490
No, that's not what they did.

02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:24.011
They did it to popularize her.

02:05:25.083 --> 02:05:32.765
It's a wonderful video, shot on the roof, where she's smiling very well into the camera, looking extremely fit.

02:05:35.612 --> 02:05:37.813
And so, yeah, they released it.

02:05:38.234 --> 02:05:40.515
It was really meant to smear her.

02:05:40.976 --> 02:05:43.737
And these two believe that, sure.

02:05:45.118 --> 02:05:45.719
Funny as that.

02:05:46.779 --> 02:05:49.121
They thought- It was the most charming thing in the entire world.

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:49.501
It was amazing.

02:05:49.601 --> 02:05:52.423
Anyone who did not love her already fell in love with her.

02:05:52.483 --> 02:05:53.384
That's what it accomplished.

02:05:53.504 --> 02:05:57.787
And then her response to that was her doing a little dance in front of the fucking door.

02:05:57.827 --> 02:05:59.008
She's a social media genius.

02:05:59.288 --> 02:06:04.791
The question is, does she- She's a social media genius.

02:06:06.032 --> 02:06:12.037
Just like Joe Rogan is a podcast genius worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:15.239
Do her ideas stand up at all?

02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:16.821
It might be interesting to hear.

02:06:17.021 --> 02:06:22.485
Her ideas can evolve, but what she has that's unique is she's real and she seems to be a really good person.

02:06:22.585 --> 02:06:23.706
She seems to be a good person.

02:06:24.126 --> 02:06:27.629
Now, whether or not I agree with her tax policy, I'm not an economist.

02:06:27.689 --> 02:06:28.890
I'm a fucking moron, okay?

02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:31.252
I don't know anything about economics.

02:06:31.572 --> 02:06:32.133
I really don't.

02:06:32.973 --> 02:06:37.856
I mean, you should have her on with some AOC's ideas is what they're talking about.

02:06:38.497 --> 02:06:41.499
Economists like no, I'd rather have her on.

02:06:41.979 --> 02:06:44.201
Just I just want to know about her as a person first.

02:06:44.381 --> 02:06:47.623
Look, my thoughts on politicians is you can hire economists.

02:06:47.643 --> 02:06:48.503
You could listen to them.

02:06:48.764 --> 02:06:49.564
You could talk to them.

02:06:49.884 --> 02:06:59.211
What we really need is people that have the right idea as far as where humans should go, the way we should behave, the way we should treat where humans should go.

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:02.473
He's thinking about the species as a whole.

02:07:04.955 --> 02:07:09.138
This overwhelming need for community that we all share.

02:07:09.599 --> 02:07:17.085
We have to pull this thing together and we have to look at each other as a community and that's lacking.

02:07:17.545 --> 02:07:20.448
And the people that are polarizing both on the left and the right,

02:07:21.128 --> 02:07:23.849
They don't want to look at it that way.

02:07:24.209 --> 02:07:28.870
They want to look at people and say, hey, you will never get better, like that 16-year-old kid.

02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:30.050
No need to ever forgive him.

02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:36.571
This kind of crazy talk, whether it's from the right or from the left, is what we really need to stomp out.

02:07:36.892 --> 02:07:37.692
We need to stop.

02:07:38.012 --> 02:07:39.172
We need to be nicer to each other.

02:07:39.192 --> 02:07:41.433
We need to figure out that we don't have time.

02:07:41.793 --> 02:07:42.893
We're not going to live long.

02:07:43.573 --> 02:07:48.758
If you're 50 years old and this is your idea of the world, fuck man, you're halfway done and you're an idiot.

02:07:49.378 --> 02:07:53.302
You're looking at shit completely wrong and you're halfway done with this trip if everything goes perfect.

02:07:53.362 --> 02:08:00.829
I know we're in an anti-religious period of the world's history, but ideas like grace and mercy

02:08:02.248 --> 02:08:04.890
would go a long way in the culture right now.

02:08:06.452 --> 02:08:08.914
That's a pretty comical thing for her to say now.

02:08:15.612 --> 02:08:24.915
you know, mindfulness and yoga, even if it's like, comes from a sort of fake guru-y place in the beginning, which a lot of times it does.

02:08:24.935 --> 02:08:31.916
Well, it's just people have, I mean, people have deeply religious impulses, and that needs to go somewhere.

02:08:32.076 --> 02:08:39.719
And so it's going to politics and doctrinaire politics, or it's going to wokefulness, or it's going to self-care and wellness.

02:08:39.799 --> 02:08:43.620
I mean, all these things are, astrology is like making a comeback.

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:44.680
Is it really?

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.681
Are you kidding?

02:08:46.741 --> 02:08:47.041
Yes.

02:08:47.301 --> 02:08:47.681
I am kidding.

02:08:47.721 --> 02:08:48.461
I mean, I'm not kidding.

02:08:48.481 --> 02:08:50.562
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:08:50.742 --> 02:09:00.326
People's signs, like, I mean, it's like all religious experts, like that energy inside of us, I think, is deeply human and needs to go somewhere.

02:09:00.635 --> 02:09:05.258
I talked to a guy who's a really smart guy who told me he doesn't do anything until he contacts his astrologer.

02:09:05.278 --> 02:09:07.699
Oh my god, everyone in LA has one.

02:09:07.839 --> 02:09:08.399
Not everyone.

02:09:08.519 --> 02:09:08.800
A lot.

02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:09.320
That's not true.

02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:09.900
Jamie?

02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:11.221
Jamie does not have one.

02:09:11.581 --> 02:09:11.741
No.

02:09:11.961 --> 02:09:13.222
Jamie consults the weed leaves.

02:09:15.543 --> 02:09:25.349
Yeah, I don't know what that's about, but I do think that people do have this desire for a space daddy, a higher power, something that knows more than you.

02:09:29.056 --> 02:09:32.279
grand pattern to follow that leads to harmony.

02:09:32.299 --> 02:09:35.361
I mean, I think everybody sort of has that thing.

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:41.726
Because, again, what we were talking about before, we do realize, if we are being honest, that no one's at the wheel.

02:09:42.386 --> 02:09:54.175
That we wake up, we're almost like we're in a spaceship, and we wake up, and we were in hypersleep, and this thing has been flying for millions of years, and we're like, wait, who the fuck is flying this?

02:09:54.635 --> 02:09:55.696
Do we know who's flying this?

02:09:55.936 --> 02:09:57.338
See what he's joking about, right?

02:09:58.118 --> 02:10:06.185
that there is no technocracy, there aren't already people in charge, there isn't already a national security theater that's misled people.

02:10:07.547 --> 02:10:08.187
But there is.

02:10:08.207 --> 02:10:10.609
This is years after 9-11.

02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:16.214
This is years after they declared the Human Genome Project done three times already.

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:21.900
And this is one year before the start of the pandemic, the culmination of 25 years of planning,

02:10:25.134 --> 02:10:31.796
that would slowly pivot and also allow the management of the population pyramid problem.

02:10:33.377 --> 02:10:43.901
It is a remarkable insight into this timeline where it becomes now, in my mind, very clear that Joe Rogan has always just been reading a script as it's provided.

02:10:44.739 --> 02:10:46.020
You're not flying it, I'm not flying it.

02:10:46.061 --> 02:10:48.683
We're going to get together and we're going to form a group that flies it.

02:10:49.204 --> 02:10:51.566
It still moves.

02:10:51.927 --> 02:10:55.190
It's still moving while we're trying to figure out who flies it, and there's no way to slow it down.

02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:56.231
There's no brakes on this thing.

02:10:56.852 --> 02:10:58.694
We are in an organic spaceship.

02:10:58.994 --> 02:10:59.334
We are.

02:10:59.394 --> 02:10:59.695
We are.

02:10:59.955 --> 02:11:01.476
And we're flying through infinity.

02:11:01.537 --> 02:11:02.778
We're spinning a thousand miles an hour.

02:11:03.418 --> 02:11:10.121
And we should, you know, if we're smart enough to realize it, we should take control of the evolution of the species by any means necessary.

02:11:10.201 --> 02:11:10.701
Right, Joe?

02:11:11.201 --> 02:11:12.241
And we're going through space.

02:11:12.642 --> 02:11:13.242
That's real.

02:11:13.362 --> 02:11:14.382
And you're going to die.

02:11:14.422 --> 02:11:15.202
All those things are real.

02:11:15.763 --> 02:11:19.184
All those things sort of make everything else sort of pale in comparison.

02:11:19.584 --> 02:11:21.825
The reality of that is so bizarre.

02:11:22.884 --> 02:11:32.893
And while we're avoiding those thoughts, we're concentrating on these very minor differences that we really have, that are really framed by our teams.

02:11:33.314 --> 02:11:37.738
You know, the team, this team says you gotta do this, this team says you gotta do that.

02:11:38.058 --> 02:11:42.062
I can tell almost to a, if you tell me you're pro-life, I go, you vote Republican.

02:11:42.342 --> 02:11:44.584
Right, and you know everything else about that person, that's crazy.

02:11:45.385 --> 02:11:46.486
The idea also that

02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:48.710
That's what they like.

02:11:48.810 --> 02:11:49.851
That's what they want.

02:11:49.931 --> 02:11:52.493
They want social media to be the source of that.

02:11:52.574 --> 02:12:05.024
And these people are going to help over the next six years make social media paramount to that, central to that, the homogenization of people's thinking.

02:12:06.065 --> 02:12:07.086
You know that you're going to die.

02:12:07.827 --> 02:12:13.011
And yet, there are people who are spending their lives hurling pixels at other people.

02:12:13.932 --> 02:12:14.313
Pixels?

02:12:14.895 --> 02:12:16.036
Like on Twitter, you know?

02:12:16.076 --> 02:12:16.856
That's hilarious though.

02:12:16.936 --> 02:12:17.396
Pixels.

02:12:17.416 --> 02:12:18.457
I never thought about it that way.

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:19.697
That's crazy.

02:12:20.238 --> 02:12:20.558
Yeah.

02:12:20.618 --> 02:12:21.298
All day too.

02:12:21.338 --> 02:12:22.419
This is your one life?

02:12:22.699 --> 02:12:22.859
Yep.

02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:24.200
That's how you want to spend it?

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:24.600
Yeah.

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:29.342
But you spent your life doing it and claim that you got fired for doing it.

02:12:29.422 --> 02:12:30.803
You see, that's what's weird.

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:41.048
A couple years from this podcast, maybe even a year from this podcast, she is going to claim to have been fired by the New York Times because of what she tweets.

02:12:44.924 --> 02:12:52.270
Elon Musk is going to be credited with saving free speech in the Western world because of his purchase of Twitter.

02:12:56.113 --> 02:12:57.594
So she's improvising right now.

02:12:57.634 --> 02:12:58.915
She doesn't know the script.

02:12:59.536 --> 02:13:07.943
The script is to make social media relevant, to make social media the most important means of control out there.

02:13:09.204 --> 02:13:10.645
And she's being recruited to help.

02:13:11.803 --> 02:13:12.284
being mean.

02:13:12.364 --> 02:13:13.184
Go outside.

02:13:13.204 --> 02:13:13.285
Yeah.

02:13:13.985 --> 02:13:14.626
Seriously.

02:13:14.646 --> 02:13:16.027
Like go outside.

02:13:16.528 --> 02:13:18.890
But it's so intoxicating and it's so new.

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:21.473
That's also the problem with social media.

02:13:21.553 --> 02:13:23.455
Social media is new in 2019.

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:23.575
Get.

02:13:28.274 --> 02:13:29.335
Back the truck up.

02:13:29.435 --> 02:13:30.276
I don't believe it.

02:13:30.576 --> 02:13:31.116
Wow.

02:13:31.577 --> 02:13:32.757
It's so new in 2019.

02:13:33.478 --> 02:13:39.282
It's crazy that in 2025, we just take it for granted that everybody's on it.

02:13:40.463 --> 02:13:50.591
In a world in which people live alone and stare down at their flashy screen and worship it like a god, these networks give you a sense of belonging and community.

02:13:50.891 --> 02:13:53.314
Yes, and it also gives you something to think about.

02:13:53.835 --> 02:13:59.421
If you, you know, I was talking about Jamie Kilstein earlier, who I accidentally almost tweeted or texted.

02:13:59.942 --> 02:14:01.964
Jamie used to be- Oh, I know.

02:14:02.064 --> 02:14:03.606
Oh, I know all about him, yeah.

02:14:03.726 --> 02:14:06.810
And he was describing how he would go after people.

02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:12.935
And then he would be locked onto his phone all day long, look at the responses and completely addicted to it.

02:14:12.955 --> 02:14:18.740
No matter what he did throughout his day, he was checking his phone every couple minutes and couldn't help that compulsion.

02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:21.762
That's a lot of people out there that are locked into this.

02:14:22.403 --> 02:14:23.263
It's an addiction.

02:14:23.303 --> 02:14:23.584
Yes.

02:14:23.864 --> 02:14:25.405
And they want it to be worse.

02:14:25.845 --> 02:14:27.267
And in 2019, they couldn't have made it.

02:14:29.838 --> 02:14:33.582
a better plan than the COVID pandemic to get it worse.

02:14:34.042 --> 02:14:34.703
It is an addiction.

02:14:34.743 --> 02:14:39.788
I've had to get, I mean, like I had a small period of a few months where I had not really been on Twitter.

02:14:39.828 --> 02:14:40.549
I joined the Times.

02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:42.951
That sort of thing happened to me.

02:14:42.971 --> 02:14:44.973
And then I was like, this is horrible.

02:14:45.134 --> 02:14:49.798
Like, I hate the way this is physically making me feel like I'm nauseous.

02:14:49.878 --> 02:14:50.679
I'm sweating.

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.741
Like I, I hate this.

02:14:52.862 --> 02:14:53.062
Yes.

02:14:53.342 --> 02:14:54.985
I can't do this.

02:14:55.065 --> 02:14:57.449
I bet she's not saying that anymore.

02:14:57.869 --> 02:15:01.836
I bet she stopped saying it after this podcast.

02:15:01.896 --> 02:15:03.098
She'll never say it again.

02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.864
Social media is the reason why she's worth $200 million now.

02:15:09.679 --> 02:15:11.380
Social media made her who she is.

02:15:11.481 --> 02:15:19.107
Social media is the reason why whatever she supposedly created in Austin was purchased for $150 million.

02:15:19.607 --> 02:15:21.249
So, I don't know.

02:15:21.269 --> 02:15:23.671
I kind of feel like saying F you, Barry.

02:15:24.686 --> 02:15:26.348
saying something mean to you.

02:15:26.368 --> 02:15:28.290
And then you look at it and you're like, I should say something back.

02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:30.151
Like this is not true.

02:15:30.211 --> 02:15:34.014
And then people, you see them like formulating, you're like, hey man, what are you doing?

02:15:34.095 --> 02:15:35.876
I'm in the middle, I'm in mortal combat here.

02:15:36.276 --> 02:15:38.278
Mortal online textual combat.

02:15:38.318 --> 02:15:50.609
You know you catch yourself, like I remember I was at a dinner party once and I was like describing some Twitter fight I was in and I was like, oh my God, I've become one of those people and I'm not going to allow myself to be that person.

02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.950
But you have to fight it.

02:15:52.150 --> 02:15:55.713
you do have to fight it, and you have to be aware of what it is.

02:15:56.213 --> 02:15:59.636
It feels like something you have to pay attention to.

02:15:59.756 --> 02:16:02.878
Right, but the beauty is that I get to write for the New York Times.

02:16:03.158 --> 02:16:04.619
Yeah, that is the beauty.

02:16:04.759 --> 02:16:17.749
She writes for the New York Times in 2019, and she's as vapid as a 16-year-old truck stop waitress in a small town in Wisconsin.

02:16:20.251 --> 02:16:21.171
It is pathetic.

02:16:22.102 --> 02:16:32.944
She lived a sheltered life in Pittsburgh, that led to a sheltered life in college, that led to a sheltered social life, all the way up until she stumbled into the New York Times.

02:16:33.344 --> 02:16:34.064
Come on!

02:16:34.944 --> 02:16:35.864
My energy into that.

02:16:36.444 --> 02:16:45.686
Yeah, and when you do get criticism from your articles, do you get it in the form of, like, what is... I got a really scary email today.

02:16:45.706 --> 02:16:48.466
I get emails, I get tweets, I get everything.

02:16:49.087 --> 02:16:49.907
Everything everyone gets.

02:16:49.947 --> 02:16:51.207
I get letters in the mail sometimes.

02:16:52.039 --> 02:16:52.900
Do you want to talk about it?

02:16:54.001 --> 02:16:57.905
No, I mean, I can.

02:16:57.925 --> 02:16:59.427
I don't think it's so unusual.

02:16:59.587 --> 02:17:03.931
I write things that people find provocative.

02:17:03.991 --> 02:17:05.513
I expect to provoke a reaction.

02:17:06.714 --> 02:17:07.375
I'm OK with that.

02:17:07.895 --> 02:17:12.500
And when there are things that are scary, The New York Times is really good about monitoring that.

02:17:15.667 --> 02:17:21.232
But I don't like to be in a field that's getting attacked as an enemy of the people by the President of the United States.

02:17:21.772 --> 02:17:24.154
Not super excited about that.

02:17:24.174 --> 02:17:29.338
But it's just so bizarre that the guy, he's so petty that he calls it like the failing New York Times.

02:17:29.378 --> 02:17:30.920
But it's so irresponsible.

02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:37.945
I'm shocked that there has not been more violence perpetrated on members of the press.

02:17:38.165 --> 02:17:38.646
I really am.

02:17:38.666 --> 02:17:41.188
What do you think happens with him?

02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.520
How does that work?

02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:47.523
She's amazed that America, she can walk anywhere.

02:17:47.583 --> 02:17:51.206
She's amazed that she can sit on the beach and no one will harass her.

02:17:51.226 --> 02:17:52.807
Maybe it's because she's not that pretty.

02:17:53.388 --> 02:17:56.531
Maybe it's because she's short and frumpy.

02:17:57.011 --> 02:17:59.293
Maybe it's because no one was on that beach.

02:17:59.413 --> 02:18:05.118
Maybe because America is a pretty safe culture, but she's surprised that more journalists haven't been

02:18:08.550 --> 02:18:09.811
It doesn't make any sense.

02:18:10.492 --> 02:18:23.624
This is just improvisation through a scripted set of talking points that ends up these two clowns contradict themselves and each other regularly for three freaking hours.

02:18:25.946 --> 02:18:27.028
I don't know who can beat him.

02:18:27.048 --> 02:18:27.828
I don't know who can beat him.

02:18:27.908 --> 02:18:28.729
Who do you think can beat him?

02:18:28.909 --> 02:18:29.570
That's a good question.

02:18:31.041 --> 02:18:31.421
I don't know.

02:18:31.601 --> 02:18:32.162
Hillary can't.

02:18:32.702 --> 02:18:34.143
I'm so worried.

02:18:34.323 --> 02:18:34.663
Duh.

02:18:34.964 --> 02:18:36.565
Yeah, but I'm so worried she's going to run again.

02:18:37.305 --> 02:18:38.786
She's going to muscle her way to the top.

02:18:39.887 --> 02:18:42.128
I don't know who can beat him right now.

02:18:42.969 --> 02:18:44.810
I'm so worried about Hillary.

02:18:44.930 --> 02:18:46.471
I don't know who can beat Trump.

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.532
This is beautiful.

02:18:49.673 --> 02:18:50.513
I don't know.

02:18:51.584 --> 02:18:52.444
Why do you think that?

02:18:52.464 --> 02:18:57.526
Because as things keep going further and further south, what about someone who is a centrist Democrat?

02:18:57.586 --> 02:18:59.366
Doesn't that make more sense?

02:18:59.887 --> 02:19:03.748
So Joe Rogan doesn't really mind if Donald Trump doesn't get elected again in 2019.

02:19:03.788 --> 02:19:04.788
Can't you see it yet?

02:19:04.828 --> 02:19:05.488
Can't you see it?

02:19:09.753 --> 02:19:18.736
who's a rational person who's on the right, who's going to look at this person who's maybe economically conservative but socially liberal and say this is really where I'm leaning towards.

02:19:18.756 --> 02:19:23.357
Yeah, unless they run someone on the far left and like on an identity politics platform.

02:19:23.397 --> 02:19:24.217
That's what scares me.

02:19:24.417 --> 02:19:25.898
Yeah, that's not going to work.

02:19:26.598 --> 02:19:27.638
Well, could it though?

02:19:27.838 --> 02:19:28.458
I don't think so.

02:19:28.518 --> 02:19:30.139
I don't know because Trump's whole thing was

02:19:31.283 --> 02:19:35.225
screw the center, I just need to make my base go apeshit crazy for me.

02:19:35.465 --> 02:19:46.630
But they're still apeshit crazy, and no matter what he does... I know, and I'm worried that the Democrats are going to try and replicate that strategy and be like, we just need to make our base go apeshit crazy, rather than running someone that can win the center.

02:19:47.671 --> 02:19:56.935
I see where you're going, but I think that this is maybe my liberal bias, but I think that people on the left wouldn't... Liberal bias!

02:20:04.679 --> 02:20:05.259
Wow.

02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:08.321
Joe Rogan and his liberal bias.

02:20:08.341 --> 02:20:10.482
I would fall for that the same way people on the right would.

02:20:10.902 --> 02:20:20.506
I don't think people on the left who saw someone who went apeshit, full, woke, far left, I think there's a lot of people in the center would be like, well, I'm going to just going to vote libertarian, man.

02:20:20.526 --> 02:20:22.327
I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson or some shit.

02:20:22.407 --> 02:20:23.547
But OK, so who's in right now?

02:20:23.587 --> 02:20:25.648
So we have Kamala, Kirsten Gillibrand.

02:20:25.668 --> 02:20:26.168
Tulsi Gabbard.

02:20:27.992 --> 02:20:28.892
Monstrous.

02:20:29.292 --> 02:20:29.592
Monstrous?

02:20:29.632 --> 02:20:30.113
Ideas.

02:20:30.573 --> 02:20:31.053
Ideas.

02:20:31.453 --> 02:20:35.514
Well, when she was 22, she had... No, she's an Assad toady.

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:36.374
What does that mean?

02:20:36.754 --> 02:20:37.674
She is a... What's a toady?

02:20:38.315 --> 02:20:39.675
I think that I used that word correctly.

02:20:39.715 --> 02:20:41.175
Jamie, can you check what toady means?

02:20:41.455 --> 02:20:49.177
Like toe in the... The New York Times reporter doesn't know what the word toady means.

02:20:50.177 --> 02:20:56.859
She thinks she used it correctly and is describing Tulsi Gabbard as an Assad toady.

02:20:58.985 --> 02:21:02.728
Of course, Joe Rogan loves Tulsi Gabbard.

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:04.429
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:07.391
has said that she should be the next President of the United States.

02:21:10.733 --> 02:21:15.696
Tulsi Gabbard is a fake person who surfs.

02:21:18.518 --> 02:21:20.400
She's as fake as Pete Buttigieg.

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:23.582
She's as fake as Greta Thunberg.

02:21:24.022 --> 02:21:26.344
She's as fake as Barry Weiss.

02:21:28.342 --> 02:21:29.323
The line, is that what it means?

02:21:29.503 --> 02:21:39.468
No, I think it's like a... The thing about Tulsi Gabbard is that she has been in line for national security actor for a very long time.

02:21:40.369 --> 02:21:41.890
Barry Weiss is being recruited.

02:21:44.144 --> 02:21:50.930
and moved up in the ladder, but probably at this point still unwittingly participating in this mess.

02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:56.234
And she's still probably unwittingly participating simply because she's so stupid.

02:21:56.894 --> 02:21:58.576
She's not a smart person.

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:03.820
She believes the last convincing person that she talked to.

02:22:05.141 --> 02:22:06.823
And that's how she goes through her life.

02:22:07.853 --> 02:22:11.074
meeting people that can either convince her or not.

02:22:11.695 --> 02:22:13.835
And when she's convinced, then she moves on.

02:22:14.035 --> 02:22:14.496
That's it.

02:22:15.336 --> 02:22:18.997
She's not processing or holding any thoughts of her own.

02:22:19.558 --> 02:22:22.059
She's just juggling things that other people put there.

02:22:23.719 --> 02:22:24.580
She's a moron.

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:33.683
And there are a lot of people like that, that just see what they're shown to see, see what they're shown, see what they're told to see.

02:22:34.643 --> 02:22:35.624
That's Barry Weiss.

02:22:39.594 --> 02:22:41.436
T-O-A-D-I-E.

02:22:41.616 --> 02:22:43.217
What does that mean?

02:22:45.299 --> 02:22:46.620
I think it means what I think it means.

02:22:50.944 --> 02:22:51.244
Toadie.

02:22:51.324 --> 02:22:52.345
Definition of toadies.

02:22:52.725 --> 02:22:57.950
A person who flatters or defers to others for self-serving reasons.

02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.690
A sycophant.

02:22:59.211 --> 02:23:00.612
So she's an Assad sycophant.

02:23:00.632 --> 02:23:01.333
Is that what you're saying?

02:23:01.813 --> 02:23:06.057
Yeah, that's known about her.

02:23:06.963 --> 02:23:08.084
That's known.

02:23:08.104 --> 02:23:10.345
That's, she was going to say proven.

02:23:10.445 --> 02:23:11.506
That's known.

02:23:12.106 --> 02:23:18.610
You know, it's like how Dan Wilson says that it's known that memory T cells and B cells provide the memory to COVID.

02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:19.771
It's known.

02:23:22.281 --> 02:23:24.543
These people are scripted shitheads.

02:23:25.203 --> 02:23:36.110
And the certainty that they have is only occasionally visible as the flimsy, bullshit, non-intellectual pseudo-belief that it is.

02:23:36.731 --> 02:23:38.512
But when it's visible, it's sad.

02:23:39.112 --> 02:23:41.354
What did she say that qualifies her?

02:23:41.554 --> 02:23:42.715
I don't remember the details.

02:23:42.735 --> 02:23:45.937
We probably should say that before we say that about her.

02:23:45.957 --> 02:23:46.998
We should probably read it, rather.

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:48.252
Well, I have read it.

02:23:48.372 --> 02:23:49.452
No, I mean, we should right now.

02:23:49.572 --> 02:23:50.433
Oh, yeah, okay.

02:23:50.453 --> 02:23:51.553
Just so we know what she said.

02:23:51.613 --> 02:23:52.293
Look up Tulsi Gabbard.

02:23:52.333 --> 02:23:54.473
I've had her on here before, and I really enjoy talking to her.

02:23:54.553 --> 02:23:55.174
I like her a lot.

02:23:55.434 --> 02:23:56.114
Are you serious?

02:23:56.174 --> 02:23:57.154
Yeah, I like talking to her.

02:23:57.214 --> 02:23:57.494
Okay, okay.

02:23:57.514 --> 02:23:58.194
I like talking to her.

02:23:58.234 --> 02:24:02.755
I don't know about- I think she's like the motherlode of- Look at how noncommittal he is.

02:24:03.295 --> 02:24:07.876
She thinks she's the motherlode of all bad ideas, but he really likes talking to her.

02:24:08.256 --> 02:24:09.637
She's a really nice girl.

02:24:12.037 --> 02:24:15.758
Look at how pathetic Joe Rogan is.

02:24:17.697 --> 02:24:18.557
bad ideas.

02:24:19.277 --> 02:24:19.617
Whoa.

02:24:20.378 --> 02:24:22.238
I'm pretty positive about that.

02:24:22.258 --> 02:24:25.019
The mother load of bad ideas.

02:24:26.239 --> 02:24:27.199
I don't think I'm wrong.

02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:28.980
She doesn't think she's wrong.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:41.303
My take on her was that I think as a person who's coming from the left, who's also a veteran and is very articulate and sensible and a woman and in talking to her, we didn't get into Assad or any of those things.

02:24:41.883 --> 02:24:50.110
but talking to her about what she feels is wrong with the current administration and the way things are running and a direction she thinks things could go in.

02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:51.491
She had some very promising ideas.

02:24:51.571 --> 02:24:52.672
I don't, I didn't know about this.

02:24:52.692 --> 02:24:56.696
But doesn't she also, did she ever apologize for believing in conversion therapy?

02:24:57.856 --> 02:24:59.758
I didn't even know she believed in conversion therapy.

02:24:59.958 --> 02:25:00.799
Am I crazy?

02:25:00.819 --> 02:25:01.780
Is that real?

02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:03.862
I'm almost positive this is real.

02:25:03.882 --> 02:25:05.243
I think her father ran

02:25:06.629 --> 02:25:08.591
When you say conversion therapy, you're talking about gay people.

02:25:08.611 --> 02:25:08.931
Yes.

02:25:09.191 --> 02:25:10.472
No, I didn't know that.

02:25:10.612 --> 02:25:11.232
I never heard that.

02:25:11.433 --> 02:25:14.455
I did hear something about when she was very young.

02:25:14.495 --> 02:25:15.295
She was like 22.

02:25:15.675 --> 02:25:20.058
I really think it's possible that Joe Rogan is a scripted idiot.

02:25:20.238 --> 02:25:22.720
I think Barry Weiss is a scripted idiot.

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.402
I think Pierre Kory is a scripted idiot.

02:25:25.562 --> 02:25:29.425
I think Mary Holland is a scripted idiot.

02:25:29.545 --> 02:25:35.449
I think most of these people are scripted idiots that have accepted a role in a national security

02:25:36.529 --> 02:25:42.355
exercise, a theater, that they had no idea where it was going or when it would end or what it would really be about.

02:25:43.176 --> 02:25:46.800
And at this point they can't and they don't care.

02:25:48.361 --> 02:25:50.564
But these are all traitors to our grandchildren.

02:25:50.604 --> 02:25:54.948
They all deserve to be hit with rotten vegetables for the rest of their lives.

02:25:54.988 --> 02:25:57.411
They all deserve to lose all of their wealth.

02:25:59.838 --> 02:26:04.999
I believe they all deserve to have their knees broken with baseball bats, but I don't think that's going to happen.

02:26:05.259 --> 02:26:09.220
Unfortunately, I don't think that's the karma that they will receive.

02:26:11.421 --> 02:26:15.682
Unfortunately, the world is full of assholes because we let them get away with it.

02:26:16.862 --> 02:26:26.004
And these two are a couple of them, but there are many more above them and around them and behind them that are the real problem.

02:26:28.149 --> 02:26:33.112
something about gay marriage and civil unions that she apologized for and said that she evolved.

02:26:33.813 --> 02:26:37.315
She reveals she met Assad in Syria without informing top Democrats.

02:26:37.355 --> 02:26:46.721
I'm telling you, she's... She said she went on a fact-finding mission in support of peace for Syrian people but characterized US-backed rebels as terrorists.

02:26:49.303 --> 02:26:51.845
Yeah, she's... I mean...

02:26:53.707 --> 02:26:56.909
I can keep looking, but I just don't have enough time to research everything.

02:26:57.049 --> 02:26:59.631
Oh yeah, don't have enough time to research everything.

02:26:59.731 --> 02:27:03.494
Google's not that fast and she's got a phone, so she's Googling it too.

02:27:04.014 --> 02:27:06.356
And so this is the stupidest shit I've ever seen.

02:27:06.396 --> 02:27:07.777
These are not real people.

02:27:08.177 --> 02:27:09.678
They're not real scholars.

02:27:09.718 --> 02:27:10.999
They're not real journalists.

02:27:11.059 --> 02:27:12.260
They are posing.

02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:14.141
They are actors.

02:27:15.061 --> 02:27:17.643
They are some of the worst Americans alive.

02:27:18.003 --> 02:27:21.526
Barry Weiss is an absolute trash monkey.

02:27:23.024 --> 02:27:23.544
At the same time.

02:27:24.805 --> 02:27:26.966
I can come back on when I know more.

02:27:27.166 --> 02:27:28.386
We can do this another time.

02:27:28.446 --> 02:27:32.788
But who do you think stands out for you as someone that would make a good president?

02:27:32.828 --> 02:27:36.030
Yeah, she once touted working for an anti-gay group that backed conversion therapy.

02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:36.470
Anyway.

02:27:36.930 --> 02:27:40.071
She once touted working for an anti- She worked for an anti-gay group.

02:27:40.111 --> 02:27:40.832
She worked for them?

02:27:40.852 --> 02:27:41.732
Like she had a job there?

02:27:41.752 --> 02:27:43.613
What?

02:27:44.813 --> 02:27:45.534
You know, I'm worried.

02:27:45.874 --> 02:27:48.135
As a person who's been called alt-right adjacent.

02:27:48.195 --> 02:27:48.775
I'm just looking it up.

02:27:48.795 --> 02:27:49.555
I'm worried about labels.

02:27:49.635 --> 02:27:50.296
No, I understand.

02:27:50.896 --> 02:27:51.436
But you know what I mean?

02:27:51.880 --> 02:28:02.945
Rep Tulsi Gabbard in the early 2000s touted working for her father's anti-gay organization, which mobilized to pass the measure against same-sex marriage in Hawaii and promoted controversial conversion therapy.

02:28:04.105 --> 02:28:05.866
Yeah, FYI.

02:28:07.407 --> 02:28:08.227
Conversion therapy.

02:28:08.247 --> 02:28:14.029
So she's able to read something from her phone and she was able to teach Joe Rogan something.

02:28:14.130 --> 02:28:15.010
It's so cool.

02:28:16.485 --> 02:28:20.047
FYI, I'm a smart girl, I know how to Google shit.

02:28:20.267 --> 02:28:21.808
The weirdest shit of all time.

02:28:22.288 --> 02:28:28.952
There was an article that I read about, they were manipulating pleasure.

02:28:28.972 --> 02:28:33.555
It turned out, I started reading it from a study on rats.

02:28:34.075 --> 02:28:40.259
They did this thing with rats where they provided, they figured out a way to give rats orgasms.

02:28:40.599 --> 02:28:43.621
They figured out a way to jazz up the pleasure center of their brains.

02:28:43.641 --> 02:28:45.382
I love that you're reading this, just for fun, okay.

02:28:46.024 --> 02:28:47.105
And they would do anything to do it.

02:28:47.425 --> 02:28:51.668
They would run up past an area that shocked them.

02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:55.791
They would do anything to get to this area where they could have these orgasms.

02:28:55.811 --> 02:28:57.633
And they would have them up to 2,000 times a day.

02:28:57.973 --> 02:28:59.574
Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, time to turn away.

02:29:01.215 --> 02:29:03.956
They did it with a gay man while they were doing this.

02:29:04.096 --> 02:29:05.736
This is in the 1970s.

02:29:06.117 --> 02:29:20.621
There's a couple of different studies that they did, but one of them they did with this gay guy where they tried to stimulate certain parts of his brain while they were showing him heterosexual porn and they were trying to convert him into being heterosexual.

02:29:21.301 --> 02:29:27.683
And apparently they had some meager amount of success with this where he engaged in sexual relationships with women

02:29:28.263 --> 02:29:31.047
and apparently even enjoyed it.

02:29:31.187 --> 02:29:32.289
It's incredibly complex.

02:29:32.869 --> 02:29:41.140
And one of the things that happens, made him masturbate to orgasm while they were doing this and showing him straight porn.

02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:43.023
The idea was they were going to reprogram his mind.

02:29:43.123 --> 02:29:43.824
How'd that work out?

02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:45.470
It didn't, but it did.

02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:50.373
It did in terms of short term, but it didn't mean it must have been just massively confused.

02:29:50.453 --> 02:29:54.436
Obviously, sexuality is not just about what makes you have an orgasm.

02:29:54.576 --> 02:29:55.076
No, it's not.

02:29:55.116 --> 02:29:57.438
It's also incredibly it's incredibly complex.

02:29:58.018 --> 02:30:03.061
And one of the things it's incredibly complex, says 2019 Joe Rogan.

02:30:03.481 --> 02:30:06.604
Sexuality is incredibly complex, says 2019 Joe Rogan.

02:30:06.724 --> 02:30:07.344
Are you ready?

02:30:09.159 --> 02:30:37.189
it happens is uh you you get you can have gay experiences when you're young if someone does something to you and imprints upon you arousal at a young age with with gay experiences sometimes even heterosexual men will get aroused by certain gay images and gay sounds like you know from experience joe tell me more things because of their past because of that like chris

02:30:37.449 --> 02:30:42.634
But isn't it also that we're all on a spectrum, sexuality?

02:30:43.254 --> 02:30:44.575
We're all on a spectrum.

02:30:44.696 --> 02:30:51.181
She was married to a guy for a few years, then decided she's mostly attracted to women, so she divorced him.

02:30:51.902 --> 02:30:53.864
It says it in her frickin' Wikipedia.

02:30:58.205 --> 02:30:59.646
Yes, I think so for sure.

02:30:59.726 --> 02:31:06.910
We all certainly are, but it's also speculative how much of that spectrum is influenced by your environment versus your genes.

02:31:07.471 --> 02:31:12.414
And this is very taboo for some people to discuss, even though it's really fascinating.

02:31:12.794 --> 02:31:14.515
Human sexuality is incredibly fascinating.

02:31:14.755 --> 02:31:16.736
Incredibly fascinating.

02:31:16.836 --> 02:31:20.338
I think Joe Rogan 2025 says there's only two sexes.

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:26.222
I think Joe Rogan 2019 is a really, really, really, really different dude.

02:31:26.755 --> 02:31:33.017
And there's some major taboo areas of exploration.

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:50.463
And when you start looking at what makes a person gay or straight, whether it's nature or nurture, whether it's a combination of those things, whether someone's just radically gay from the womb, or whether someone's radically straight from the womb, these studies where they were trying to turn someone with science

02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:54.461
They were trying to turn someone straight.

02:31:54.661 --> 02:31:55.742
You couldn't do it today.

02:31:55.782 --> 02:31:57.482
You'd never be able to do it today in America.

02:31:57.502 --> 02:31:58.143
I have to look this up.

02:31:58.163 --> 02:31:59.423
Yeah, I believe it was 71 they did it.

02:31:59.443 --> 02:31:59.983
Okay, I'll look it up.

02:32:00.123 --> 02:32:01.304
Yeah, I'll send it to you.

02:32:01.644 --> 02:32:02.424
It's crazy.

02:32:02.624 --> 02:32:03.184
It's crazy.

02:32:04.265 --> 02:32:07.186
Widely criticized, but heavily studied.

02:32:07.246 --> 02:32:09.727
The woman, they did it to a woman too.

02:32:09.827 --> 02:32:15.269
This woman had a problem with painkillers, and so they figured out a way to wire her brain.

02:32:15.788 --> 02:32:18.769
Is this like electric shock therapy or like lobotomy?

02:32:18.849 --> 02:32:20.169
They used fucking dental drills.

02:32:20.209 --> 02:32:21.489
They put holes in their brain.

02:32:21.509 --> 02:32:26.171
They fucking could do whatever they wanted in the 70s.

02:32:26.191 --> 02:32:27.651
Is now the time that we get high?

02:32:27.671 --> 02:32:28.791
When does this end?

02:32:29.051 --> 02:32:31.172
Now's the time we break out the Elon Musk weed.

02:32:31.632 --> 02:32:32.872
Oh my god, that was crazy.

02:32:32.932 --> 02:32:33.952
I watched every minute of that.

02:32:33.972 --> 02:32:34.473
It was nothing.

02:32:34.693 --> 02:32:36.693
We drank whiskey for two hours first.

02:32:36.753 --> 02:32:39.934
Sorry, when I say crazy, I mean like an amazing get.

02:32:40.434 --> 02:32:49.659
He was an amazing get for a journalist that I guess Joe's not a journalist, but she wants him to think of himself as a journalist because she's a journalist.

02:32:50.319 --> 02:32:52.460
And it's an amazing interview.

02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:55.882
Listen to them glaze Elon Musk here.

02:32:56.142 --> 02:32:57.943
Journalistically, it was awesome.

02:32:58.363 --> 02:33:04.385
No, it was really cool and I have to thank some of his friends that I'm friends with that convinced him to do that.

02:33:05.085 --> 02:33:08.426
Yeah, that was a fascinating conversation.

02:33:08.486 --> 02:33:10.326
I thought it was nothing.

02:33:10.586 --> 02:33:11.746
So we smoked a little pot.

02:33:11.966 --> 02:33:13.487
I literally didn't think anything of it.

02:33:13.527 --> 02:33:14.467
It doesn't matter.

02:33:14.487 --> 02:33:17.028
Anything he does is fascinating to people.

02:33:18.768 --> 02:33:22.149
But what I really wanted to talk to him about was his thought process.

02:33:22.569 --> 02:33:23.769
Like, what's going on?

02:33:23.849 --> 02:33:26.369
I know something different is going on in his head.

02:33:26.689 --> 02:33:45.973
You ever talk to someone where, because I have children and I do like to think of people as babies that become what they are, and I see them in front of me right now, and this constant state of evolution, but sometimes I'll run into someone that's depressingly stupid, where I realize, God damn, this guy's got a nine-volt brain.

02:33:46.673 --> 02:33:47.314
They just do.

02:33:47.674 --> 02:33:48.414
Some people just do.

02:33:48.474 --> 02:33:49.535
And no one wants to admit that.

02:33:49.815 --> 02:33:54.219
And we're not talking about mental retardation or any sort of a disease, Down syndrome or something like that.

02:33:54.519 --> 02:33:56.741
We're talking about people that are just toxically stupid.

02:33:57.121 --> 02:33:57.902
And they do exist.

02:33:57.942 --> 02:33:59.423
Just like some people have big noses.

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:00.904
Some people have little noses.

02:34:01.044 --> 02:34:04.147
So when you were talking to Elon Musk, did you get the sense that you were talking to like

02:34:04.807 --> 02:34:05.368
a genius?

02:34:05.488 --> 02:34:06.148
What did it feel like?

02:34:06.188 --> 02:34:07.089
Like I'm a chimp.

02:34:08.370 --> 02:34:10.031
Like you're that person.

02:34:10.051 --> 02:34:12.113
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

02:34:12.393 --> 02:34:15.976
I am that toxically stupid person talking to this guy.

02:34:16.036 --> 02:34:17.357
Bullshit.

02:34:18.498 --> 02:34:25.183
I've watched that whole interview and he doesn't say anything profound the whole time and it ain't because he's got Asperger's.

02:34:26.243 --> 02:34:27.404
I mean, this is a joke.

02:34:28.165 --> 02:34:36.414
Elon Musk is the most unprofound fatass in America on television and in social media today.

02:34:37.194 --> 02:34:43.521
He's the most overrated male human to ever walk the earth next to Larry David.

02:34:44.622 --> 02:34:45.122
Come on!

02:34:46.092 --> 02:34:47.553
Let's be really honest here.

02:34:48.073 --> 02:34:53.056
Jeff Bezos is one of the biggest jokes of a man that's ever walked the earth.

02:34:53.916 --> 02:35:02.822
Elon Musk, when he jumped on stage with Donald Trump, he looked like a guy who had done less athletics.

02:35:03.562 --> 02:35:05.283
Like it was pathetic.

02:35:07.044 --> 02:35:08.545
And look at Peter Thiel.

02:35:11.527 --> 02:35:19.931
Peter Thiel is one of the biggest jokes of a human male to ever walk the earth, gay or straight.

02:35:22.292 --> 02:35:26.554
And Elon Musk is one of the people that he says is amazing.

02:35:26.714 --> 02:35:28.455
She says is amazing.

02:35:30.016 --> 02:35:34.998
Peter Thiel, we all have to be afraid of him because Palantir and stuff.

02:35:37.379 --> 02:35:38.620
What a bunch of bullshit.

02:35:41.111 --> 02:35:50.457
who wants to create gigantic power stations in Australia to fix their grid, and wants to shoot fucking rockets into space, and they literally let him drill under L.A.

02:35:50.477 --> 02:35:51.118
They're like, go ahead.

02:35:51.238 --> 02:35:52.599
What are you gonna do, you gonna drill holes?

02:35:52.819 --> 02:35:53.299
Go ahead, go ahead.

02:35:53.319 --> 02:36:01.284
I think people are completely fascinated by him, and they would have watched you, they would have watched like a silent movie with you and him for two hours, and millions of people would have watched that too.

02:36:01.304 --> 02:36:02.005
I don't know about that.

02:36:02.205 --> 02:36:02.705
No, I mean.

02:36:02.725 --> 02:36:04.146
They want to hear him talk, for sure.

02:36:04.166 --> 02:36:08.409
Yeah, they want to hear him talk, but I'm saying like anything he does is completely fascinating to people.

02:36:08.649 --> 02:36:10.370
Well he's a legitimate super genius.

02:36:11.010 --> 02:36:11.931
Legitimate.

02:36:12.391 --> 02:36:15.753
He's not full of shit.

02:36:16.194 --> 02:36:18.215
His thought process is extraordinary.

02:36:18.755 --> 02:36:22.898
But one of the things that was really clear from talking to him was that it's uncomfortable.

02:36:23.298 --> 02:36:29.682
That his whole life it's been this tornado of ideas that's beating against his head.

02:36:30.583 --> 02:36:32.224
And he's like, you wouldn't want to be me.

02:36:32.244 --> 02:36:34.165
And I'm like, oh Jesus.

02:36:34.945 --> 02:36:39.028
Like what do you mean man, you know, he's like it's it never shuts off.

02:36:39.168 --> 02:36:55.318
All right, you know, it's so stupid It's just so stupid it's like he's got so many good ideas, you know, you just can't keep up with them all so You know Maybe you should just spin him off with different people send them all to Shark Tank with all of his ideas He could just sit with a room full of people

02:36:56.192 --> 02:37:00.755
When he gets a new idea, he could just say it to that person and they could leave the room and act on it.

02:37:01.216 --> 02:37:11.063
And then he could come up with the next new idea and his big Asperger brain could just be spraying these new ideas all around the room, except he's completely full of shit.

02:37:13.305 --> 02:37:19.109
And he is one of the most unremarkably smart men that's currently alive.

02:37:20.615 --> 02:37:34.369
Elon Musk is a joke But he wasn't you know, he wasn't woe is me He was being factual and he was probably it's probably like, you know, some people have a ringing in their ears They have tinnitus rock concerts too many.

02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:43.398
I think he's got a ringing of ideas So while you and I are having this conversation, I don't have a fucking thing else going on in my head There's nothing

02:37:44.381 --> 02:37:45.823
There's nothing else back there.

02:37:46.103 --> 02:37:47.365
It's just you and I talking.

02:37:47.405 --> 02:37:48.927
There's no fucking grand plans.

02:37:49.227 --> 02:37:52.851
I think he's remapping civilization and trying to make a better yacht.

02:37:53.592 --> 02:37:55.114
I'm thinking I want a burger.

02:37:55.154 --> 02:37:56.376
That's what I'm thinking right now.

02:38:01.127 --> 02:38:03.669
So we're supposed to believe that that was 2019.

02:38:03.729 --> 02:38:04.369
And this is 2025.

02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.990
What did she say?

02:38:05.010 --> 02:38:05.410
Did you miss it?

02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:27.202
Back in the United States, Paramount Skydance has acquired the right-wing digital media outlet, The Free Press, for $150 million.

02:38:27.522 --> 02:38:39.845
The right-wing digital media outlet, The Free Press, founded by Jewish lesbian, Barry Weiss.

02:38:41.109 --> 02:38:55.325
former writer for the New York Times, former liberal with liberal Joe Rogan talking about the spectrum of genders, Zionist, supporter of Israel, whatever else she is.

02:38:57.813 --> 02:39:14.927
And here is Democracy Now, you know, that news program on the internet that announced the presence of and the moral clash between Mary Holland and the MMR vaccine people and Paul Offit of the vaccine people.

02:39:19.351 --> 02:39:25.096
It's all one malevolent national security theater.

02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:41.862
This woman has been an actor in it for more than a decade, and is partially responsible for the rise of the anti-vax movement that is represented by these two sabotaged, malevolent shit organizations.

02:39:45.078 --> 02:39:49.641
and has installed its co-founder, Barry Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News.

02:39:50.161 --> 02:39:53.443
Weiss will report directly to David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount.

02:39:53.483 --> 02:40:02.188
The free press is backed by prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists, has been widely criticized for its commentary on Gaza, including an article titled, The Gaza Famine Myth.

02:40:02.708 --> 02:40:07.910
which questioned famine conditions in the besieged territory caused by Israel's assault and blockade.

02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:23.357
A CBS correspondent told The Independent, quote, "'The fact that we don't have money to pay journalists, but we have money to pay Barry Weiss between $100 and $200 million is indicative of what the Ellison's true goal here is, and it's not journalism,' they said."

02:40:24.497 --> 02:40:34.340
The Supreme Court's rejected an appeal from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, who's currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.

02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:48.724
Maxwell had attempted to get the Supreme Court to rule on whether her case was covered by a plea deal Epstein reached in 2008, when he pleaded guilty to prostitution offenses in Florida, in exchange for federal prosecutors agreeing not to charge his co-conspirators.

02:40:49.244 --> 02:40:54.026
Meanwhile, President Trump was asked Monday about a possible pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell.

02:40:55.416 --> 02:40:55.916
I don't know.

02:40:55.997 --> 02:40:59.299
I mean, I'd have to speak to the... So, of course, this is all part of the theater.

02:40:59.339 --> 02:41:01.100
Now he's gonna pretend that he doesn't know.

02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:02.381
I'd have to look into it.

02:41:02.441 --> 02:41:05.564
But she's... she's responsible for sex trafficking.

02:41:05.604 --> 02:41:07.045
Well, I would have to look into it.

02:41:07.485 --> 02:41:17.213
And so the left can go apeshit, the Trump derangement syndrome can go to 11, and also the absurd defense...

02:41:18.254 --> 02:41:34.083
that all of the hardcore Trumps will accept, the hardcore Alex Jones fans will accept, the hardcore RFK people will accept, the good with the bad because, you know, we're trying to fix things and it's hard and they're playing 3 or 5 or 40 chess.

02:41:36.324 --> 02:41:37.605
It's exactly by design.

02:41:37.705 --> 02:41:39.806
It's a perfectly designed shitshow.

02:41:41.367 --> 02:41:43.548
And democracy now is a wonderful...

02:41:47.324 --> 02:41:48.566
clashing harmony.

02:41:48.626 --> 02:41:49.206
I'll look at it.

02:41:50.728 --> 02:41:52.751
I have a lot of people have asked me for pardons.

02:41:54.252 --> 02:41:56.375
I call him Puff Daddy has asked me for a pardon.

02:41:56.395 --> 02:41:57.216
Yes, Larry.

02:41:58.558 --> 02:42:00.460
Larry Ellison's son, that's correct.

02:42:01.862 --> 02:42:03.704
Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna have to take a look at it.

02:42:03.744 --> 02:42:04.965
I have to ask DOJ.

02:42:05.706 --> 02:42:19.692
Meanwhile, Adelita Grijalva, who just won a special election for a congressional seat from Arizona last month, has still not been sworn into Congress, despite arriving in Washington, D.C., last week.

02:42:20.192 --> 02:42:29.015
Last Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled previously scheduled votes for this week and is holding pro forma sessions with just a few minutes of business per day.

02:42:29.436 --> 02:42:35.198
Grijalva thinks it's because she's the deciding vote on a petition to release the Epstein

02:42:36.618 --> 02:42:37.358
Wow.

02:42:37.519 --> 02:42:38.399
So there you go.

02:42:38.899 --> 02:42:42.360
Now we're supposed to believe that they're not swearing in this lady.

02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:42.860
Why?

02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:47.441
Because they don't want the deciding vote on releasing the Epstein files.

02:42:47.861 --> 02:42:51.742
And who's at the charge of releasing the Epstein files?

02:42:52.183 --> 02:42:52.783
That's right.

02:42:52.943 --> 02:42:57.924
Massey and Ro Khanna, the Indian agent.

02:42:59.004 --> 02:43:04.706
And Steve, uh, uh, uh, uh, Massey, the, the guy that, you know, from Kentucky.

02:43:06.046 --> 02:43:07.207
Holy shit.

02:43:08.408 --> 02:43:17.573
Cortez echoed her concerns writing on X quote, the government is in full shutdown and the Republicans are refusing to call the house back into session.

02:43:17.913 --> 02:43:18.693
Want to know why?

02:43:19.113 --> 02:43:20.354
Because we have secured.

02:43:20.894 --> 02:43:29.839
And there's AOC, AOC who, who Joe Rogan was in love with in 2019, thought her ideas were great.

02:43:29.899 --> 02:43:32.661
Not sure about her tax policy, but gosh, she's awesome.

02:43:33.766 --> 02:43:36.571
And she's so fascinating and so young and hot.

02:43:37.713 --> 02:43:42.442
And here's AOC talking about how we better get those Epstein files out.

02:43:42.502 --> 02:43:44.425
Boy, I wonder what's going to happen, huh?

02:43:45.635 --> 02:43:51.299
the final vote on releasing the Epstein files, and they don't want them out," unquote.

02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.021
And those are some of the headlines.

02:43:53.421 --> 02:43:57.704
This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

02:43:58.345 --> 02:44:01.688
I'm Amy Goodman in New York, joined by Democracy Now!'

02:44:01.648 --> 02:44:04.270
's Juan González in Chicago.

02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.970
Hi, Juan.

02:44:06.231 --> 02:44:10.715
Hi, Amy, and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.

02:44:11.255 --> 02:44:13.076
Thanks for watching Democracy Now!

02:44:14.758 --> 02:44:39.145
course they're on YouTube etc so now we also have one word answer power we also have Senator Ron Johnson to acquire and maintain power and so he's on Fox News talking the shit about you know Republicans and Democrats Democrats bad Republicans good Trump is great he's full of bull he's just a scripted actor a national security actor as a senator

02:44:40.711 --> 02:44:42.152
who knows exactly what he's doing.

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:52.896
He's working for the National Security State, the DOE, and the Human Genome Project to bamboozle people to take advantage of what the Trump administration is.

02:44:54.757 --> 02:44:56.740
and so why they have the blue and red team going bananas

02:45:10.936 --> 02:45:23.163
dubious research about autism, its skepticism over vaccines, and its wholesale rejection of the consensus about climate change, the Trump administration continues to raise alarm within the scientific community.

02:45:23.663 --> 02:45:29.206
Our William Brangham spoke with two prominent researchers about their new book, chronicling what they argue is a concern.

02:45:29.226 --> 02:45:36.750
So if social media or mainstream media tells you that there is a consensus about something and therefore demands that you accept it,

02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:39.751
That is military coercion.

02:45:40.431 --> 02:45:41.692
And it's by design.

02:45:41.732 --> 02:45:43.012
That's how the system works.

02:45:43.052 --> 02:45:50.016
There is a scientific consensus about climate change that you yourself or any of your friends cannot question.

02:45:50.036 --> 02:45:52.957
It doesn't matter how many papers you read.

02:45:52.977 --> 02:45:55.939
It is a scientific consensus.

02:45:55.999 --> 02:46:07.004
And that scientific consensus also exists about COVID, the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, viral transmission, RNA pandemics, AIDS pandemics,

02:46:09.753 --> 02:46:12.815
These are all illusions of consensus.

02:46:14.816 --> 02:46:20.119
And the illusion of consensus is what has been militarized using podcasts.

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:23.961
That's how we are being governed.

02:46:24.041 --> 02:46:29.564
And that's why on social media and on mainstream media, you have podcast actors.

02:46:30.165 --> 02:46:33.787
Here we have a podcaster with two actors.

02:46:34.727 --> 02:46:36.108
There's a war on science.

02:46:37.389 --> 02:46:53.858
In their new book, our guests argue that we are living through a, quote, anti-science super storm, where a concerted group of global actors, billionaires, leaders of nation states, and credentialed experts, work to confuse and mislead the public about basic scientific principles.

02:46:54.238 --> 02:46:57.260
Wow, so there's a good guy, bad guy battle.

02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:00.301
The good guys are on one side, the bad guys on the other.

02:47:00.701 --> 02:47:03.263
But there are billionaires on both sides.

02:47:03.823 --> 02:47:11.208
There are national security interests on both sides, and there are people making lots of money by telling lies on one side.

02:47:13.339 --> 02:47:17.321
particularly around the twin crises of climate change and pandemic threats.

02:47:17.961 --> 02:47:20.482
Their book is called Science Under Siege.

02:47:20.742 --> 02:47:27.465
Don't forget that the prevailing narrative is that pandemics become more dangerous as global warming increases.

02:47:27.505 --> 02:47:30.206
That's what Fauci and Daisak would tell us, right?

02:47:30.486 --> 02:47:32.827
And its authors are familiar to NewsHour viewers.

02:47:33.407 --> 02:47:41.391
Dr. Peter Hotez is the Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Virology and Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.

02:47:43.371 --> 02:48:00.836
Don't forget that he didn't know jack shit about Diddley, but just got a phone call after the first attack, after the first SARS thing, and just opened a book, and started reading from the book over the phone, and then people kept calling him, and before he knew it, he was a public health expert.

02:48:00.976 --> 02:48:01.996
That's the truth!

02:48:02.937 --> 02:48:04.117
Peter Hotez!

02:48:05.742 --> 02:48:12.004
Presidential Distinguished Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

02:48:12.464 --> 02:48:16.625
Gentlemen, so nice to have you both here in person at the NewsHour.

02:48:16.645 --> 02:48:21.587
I want to ask you both, in this book, you detail this.

02:48:22.967 --> 02:48:28.673
I mean, as far back as Galileo, there have been attacks on scientists and scientific understanding.

02:48:29.634 --> 02:48:39.984
Both of you, even with that knowledge, describe how you came into these, your respective fields, and still were in some way shocked at the level of vitriol directed against you.

02:48:40.404 --> 02:48:44.989
And I wonder if you could just tell me a little bit about when you first recognized that that was coming at you.

02:48:45.569 --> 02:48:46.289
Yeah, thanks, William.

02:48:46.329 --> 02:48:47.170
It's great to be with you.

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:50.231
And, you know, it goes back two and a half decades for me.

02:48:50.591 --> 02:49:00.516
Back in the late 1990s, my co-authors and I published the now well-known hockey stick curve that demonstrated how unprecedented the warming of the past century is.

02:49:00.936 --> 02:49:07.879
And it implicated human-caused climate change, the increase in the concentration of carbon pollution due to fossil fuel burning.

02:49:08.359 --> 02:49:11.101
that was a threat to some powerful vested interests.

02:49:11.361 --> 02:49:19.767
And so they focused a whole lot of firepower on me to try to discredit me, to intimidate me, to get me fired from my job.

02:49:20.508 --> 02:49:30.175
And I'll tell you, it was sort of like PTSD for me five years ago when... Wow, Robert Malone also had PTSD from all this.

02:49:30.295 --> 02:49:30.455
Crazy.

02:49:30.475 --> 02:49:37.621
Public health scientists like Peter and Tony Fauci found themselves under attack in precisely the same way, the same tactics.

02:49:38.381 --> 02:49:40.082
and even some of the same players.

02:49:40.503 --> 02:49:43.404
And that's where Peter and I sort of started to interact.

02:49:43.444 --> 02:49:44.525
We became friends.

02:49:44.925 --> 02:49:47.107
Ultimately, that led to this collaboration.

02:49:47.487 --> 02:49:49.728
Do you remember the first time you got a glimpse of this?

02:49:50.129 --> 02:49:54.451
Yeah, I mean, I did my MD and PhD combined in the 1980s.

02:49:55.652 --> 02:50:11.930
worked on a looks like an indian guy back there phd thesis which now 40 years later showing high levels of protection that's what i wanted to do make low-cost vaccines for the world in the laboratory as a laboratory investigator pediatric scientist and then i met my wife ann in medical school and graduate school

02:50:13.011 --> 02:50:17.415
Now we have four kids, including Rachel, who has autism and intellectual disabilities.

02:50:17.495 --> 02:50:23.041
And if you remember, that was the first assertion that false claims of vaccines cause autism, and I saw it was nonsense.

02:50:23.081 --> 02:50:27.726
And I said something, ultimately wrote a book about it, and that made me...

02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:31.331
public enemy number one or two with anti-vaccine groups.

02:50:32.152 --> 02:50:36.554
The bulk of your book points fingers very explicitly at these different actors.

02:50:36.574 --> 02:50:42.497
You lump them and you call them the different P's here, plutocrats, petrostates, propagandists, and the press.

02:50:43.277 --> 02:50:51.661
And you argue and demonstrate how they are aligned against very basic principles of science, that carbon pollution is warming the planet.

02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:55.263
Wow, so it's the press, it's petrol, it's

02:50:56.323 --> 02:51:21.186
like plutocracy think about how stupid that is how stupid it is it's just remarkable and this is this week like yesterday or the day before dangerous degree that vaccines can and have saved millions of lives collectively though what do all of those different actors have in common yeah well there's

02:51:21.186 --> 02:51:35.495
There's an underlying agenda, whether it's the plutocrats who fund dark money organizations that have been attacking climate science, that have actually been behind the assault on vaccines, which is interesting, as well as petrostates.

02:51:35.615 --> 02:51:42.379
Russia and Saudi Arabia in particular, they don't want a clean energy transition, and they've done everything they can to block

02:51:43.139 --> 02:51:53.844
any global green energy transition, the United States right now, unfortunately, has to be classified under the current administration as a petro-state as well.

02:51:54.204 --> 02:51:59.807
Its policies on energy and the environment are fundamentally driven by fossil fuel interests as well.

02:52:00.147 --> 02:52:11.592
And then there are the conservative media, the Rupert Murdoch's media empire, Fox News, Wall Street Journal, that have promoted a lot of the anti-science in both of these areas, but also some of the legacy media outlets.

02:52:12.452 --> 02:52:27.163
Washington Post, New York Times, that often fall victim to sort of false framing, what we call performative neutrality, where anti-science will be placed on an equal footing with the consensus of the world's scientists on the op-ed pages of these papers.

02:52:27.492 --> 02:52:34.777
I mean, I think a point of the book is too often we call it misinformation or infodemic, like it's random junk out there on the internet.

02:52:34.857 --> 02:52:35.277
It's not.

02:52:35.397 --> 02:52:41.201
It's organized, it's deliberate, it's politically motivated, and it's financially motivated.

02:52:41.281 --> 02:52:47.105
So they're so good at lying that they make money, and that's the only reason why they lie.

02:52:47.165 --> 02:52:47.905
It's to make money.

02:52:47.985 --> 02:52:50.327
It doesn't make sense.

02:52:51.232 --> 02:53:13.186
It simply doesn't make sense that all these moms and all these dads and all these lawyers are out there lying on purpose, knowing that the only thing they're getting from it is their time share and the travel and the occasional autograph or, you know, it doesn't make any sense.

02:53:16.127 --> 02:53:16.868
It really doesn't.

02:53:18.325 --> 02:53:25.293
It doesn't make any sense for Sherry Tenpenny to have been busy for 25 years because God spoke to her.

02:53:25.433 --> 02:53:28.176
It doesn't make any sense that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:53:28.216 --> 02:53:35.744
has been praying for a half an hour every day for 20 years and believes that Donald Trump is the answer to those prayers.

02:53:36.185 --> 02:53:37.566
It doesn't make any sense that

02:53:39.128 --> 02:53:45.791
that Roseanne Barr is praying to God that Donald Trump will finally wake people up or something like that.

02:53:46.392 --> 02:54:00.359
None of these statements make any sense and for him to say that there is a 20-year anti-vax campaign that he hasn't been able to make any dent in because their lies are so good,

02:54:01.457 --> 02:54:08.763
and the press and the plutocrats and the petroleum interests are working against him.

02:54:09.123 --> 02:54:10.624
This is just stupid.

02:54:11.105 --> 02:54:15.789
And this is currently in America, the PBS news hour.

02:54:17.430 --> 02:54:18.971
We are being undermined.

02:54:19.151 --> 02:54:23.555
Our culture and our society is being undermined.

02:54:26.077 --> 02:54:28.339
It is the controlled demolition of America.

02:54:28.379 --> 02:54:29.580
You can see it right now.

02:54:31.138 --> 02:54:40.824
vaccine side and the biomedical sciences, in addition to all the things Michael just said, you also have a very aggressive health wellness influencer industry.

02:54:41.024 --> 02:54:50.430
The problem is people like us are bad for business because we say, wait a minute, ivermectin doesn't do anything for COVID and neither does hydroxychloroquine.

02:54:50.470 --> 02:54:50.911
And here's why.

02:54:50.991 --> 02:54:53.372
So ivermectin, you know, the same thing that P.R.I.

02:54:53.392 --> 02:54:54.553
Corey dragged us through

02:54:55.114 --> 02:54:57.782
The same thing that the wellness company is dragging us through.

02:54:57.802 --> 02:55:00.429
The same thing that Joe Rogan dragged us through.

02:55:00.449 --> 02:55:02.976
It was a trap all along.

02:55:04.110 --> 02:55:07.512
And it doesn't matter whether these people wittingly or unwittingly went along.

02:55:07.552 --> 02:55:13.796
They are all part of a national security theater that is threatening this very sovereignty of our grandchildren.

02:55:13.836 --> 02:55:17.558
These people are traitors for being actors in this theater.

02:55:17.578 --> 02:55:20.180
You should get vaccinated.

02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:32.328
And for that business model, for their business model to be successful, you've got to attack vaccines and you have to attack people like Michael and myself and portray us as cartoon villains or public enemies.

02:55:32.828 --> 02:55:37.352
And so their business model is to attack people and attack the vaccine schedule.

02:55:37.392 --> 02:55:41.395
That's their business model of wellness and selling supplements.

02:55:41.415 --> 02:55:43.176
You see how stupid it is?

02:55:44.017 --> 02:55:45.238
It's just stupid.

02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:52.044
The subtitle of your book is How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World.

02:55:52.564 --> 02:55:54.426
One of the things that you argue is that

02:55:55.481 --> 02:56:00.403
You all, the members of the scientific community, need to speak out more overtly.

02:56:00.943 --> 02:56:05.064
And you, in this book, name names and point fingers very overtly.

02:56:05.745 --> 02:56:15.088
Do you worry, though, that that only further exacerbates the sense that people think, oh, science is partisan, that you guys have an ax to grind?

02:56:15.768 --> 02:56:22.513
You know, back in the late 1990s, I loved crunching numbers, looking for patterns in data, writing computer code to solve problems.

02:56:23.294 --> 02:56:25.876
I would have been very happy if they had just left me alone.

02:56:26.196 --> 02:56:31.800
But they didn't, because the hockey stick, you know, did become this symbol of the climate crisis.

02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:34.462
They came after it, and they came after me.

02:56:34.802 --> 02:56:36.584
As I like to say, I didn't come to politics.

02:56:36.904 --> 02:56:37.885
Politics came to me.

02:56:38.125 --> 02:56:41.247
And so we do think scientists need to step up to the table.

02:56:41.267 --> 02:56:42.928
And it doesn't mean getting into

02:56:43.769 --> 02:56:59.497
political debates and name-calling, but it does mean demanding that any sort of policy-based discussions be premised on an objective and accurate understanding of what the science actually has to say.

02:56:59.537 --> 02:57:09.883
And unfortunately, just having that position, just being an advocate for objective science now makes you a public enemy in the climate sphere or in the public health arena.

02:57:10.083 --> 02:57:20.409
I mean, look, I mean, we made a low cost COVID vaccine, recombinant protein COVID vaccine that reached 100 million people in India and Indonesia.

02:57:20.489 --> 02:57:26.373
But, you know, as wonderful as that accomplishment was, I now realize it's not sufficient.

02:57:26.453 --> 02:57:30.155
It's necessary, but not sufficient, because unless we do something,

02:57:30.615 --> 02:57:39.683
for this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement that is basically tearing the whole infrastructure for vaccinating the world's children down.

02:57:39.743 --> 02:57:40.564
That's its goal.

02:57:41.245 --> 02:57:42.566
We're not going to be successful.

02:57:42.646 --> 02:57:44.948
So really driven to it by necessity.

02:57:46.049 --> 02:57:47.631
The book is Science Under Siege.

02:57:47.811 --> 02:57:50.233
Peter Hotez, Michael Mann, so great to see you.

02:57:50.553 --> 02:57:50.894
Thank you.

02:57:51.094 --> 02:57:51.394
Thank you.

02:57:51.434 --> 02:57:51.794
Thank you.

02:57:52.668 --> 02:57:53.689
So where is this going?

02:57:54.149 --> 02:57:55.991
Where is the red team going to go?

02:57:56.031 --> 02:57:58.654
Well, the Israelis have effectively taken over American media.

02:57:58.734 --> 02:58:05.580
Bari Weiss is the owner of the Free Press, which she just recently sold to CBS News for $150 million.

02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:07.001
Not a small amount of money.

02:58:07.121 --> 02:58:10.224
Plus, she gets elevated to editor-in-chief of CBS News.

02:58:10.324 --> 02:58:11.545
This is David Ellison.

02:58:11.726 --> 02:58:14.068
This is the son of Larry Ellison.

02:58:14.128 --> 02:58:16.290
He is the CEO of Paramount.

02:58:16.570 --> 02:58:24.534
She is actually going to be reporting directly to David Ellison, bypassing traditional network leadership structure.

02:58:24.634 --> 02:58:31.817
David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, the largest single donor to the IDF, and he is the largest shareholder in TikTok.

02:58:32.017 --> 02:58:38.901
Larry Ellison and family own Paramount Skydance, a massive corporation which holds these brands.

02:58:38.961 --> 02:58:42.663
Look at all these brands that are under the Paramount Skydance banner.

02:58:42.864 --> 02:58:46.406
And the Ellison family owns now all of these brands.

02:58:46.426 --> 02:58:51.689
They control CBS, including CBS News, MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, Miramax.

02:58:51.949 --> 02:58:52.850
The list goes on.

02:58:52.970 --> 02:58:54.611
Now, you might not remember Bari Weiss.

02:58:54.771 --> 02:58:58.933
She called Tulsi Gabbard a toady, saying that she was an Assad apologist.

02:58:58.953 --> 02:59:00.694
Bari Weiss is extremely pro-Israel.

02:59:00.854 --> 02:59:02.515
Obviously, the Israelis hated Assad.

02:59:02.555 --> 02:59:03.836
They really wanted to topple Assad.

02:59:03.896 --> 02:59:04.636
Calls her a toady.

02:59:04.676 --> 02:59:05.957
Doesn't even know what a toady is.

02:59:06.097 --> 02:59:07.638
She's an Assad toady.

02:59:08.038 --> 02:59:08.519
What does that mean?

02:59:08.899 --> 02:59:09.820
She is a Toadie.

02:59:10.481 --> 02:59:11.822
I think that I use that word correctly.

02:59:11.862 --> 02:59:13.344
Jamie, can you check what Toadie means?

02:59:13.564 --> 02:59:17.329
This wasn't a well-deserved promotion to editor in chief of CBS News.

02:59:17.429 --> 02:59:20.572
She's a Netanyahu Toadie, to use her own words.

02:59:20.732 --> 02:59:21.774
She's a Netanyahu Toadie.

02:59:21.854 --> 02:59:22.975
Now she's running CBS News.

02:59:23.075 --> 02:59:23.815
And it gets worse.

02:59:23.935 --> 02:59:25.256
You thought this was bad enough.

02:59:25.336 --> 02:59:26.377
It actually gets worse.

02:59:26.397 --> 02:59:28.398
Let's talk about Warner Brothers Discovery.

02:59:28.478 --> 02:59:32.119
These are all the brands under the Warner Brothers Discovery brand.

02:59:32.219 --> 02:59:40.983
You've got, of course, Warner Brothers, TNT, Food Network, HBO, TBS, TLC, CNN, HBO Max, HGTV, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, New Line Cinema.

02:59:41.023 --> 02:59:43.345
Well, guess who's about to buy it?

02:59:43.765 --> 02:59:44.405
The Ellisons.

02:59:44.565 --> 02:59:45.946
How is this even allowed?

02:59:46.166 --> 02:59:50.328
How are they allowed to acquire practically all of American media?

02:59:50.768 --> 02:59:54.215
and social media and run it under their Israeli thumbs.

02:59:54.675 --> 02:59:56.098
How is this even allowed?

02:59:56.198 --> 02:59:59.324
They already control too much and they're not loyal to America.

02:59:59.424 --> 03:00:00.025
It is shameful.

03:00:00.106 --> 03:00:00.847
It is treasonous.

03:00:00.927 --> 03:00:03.392
We cannot allow them to control an ounce more.

03:00:05.373 --> 03:00:06.974
They control us all.

03:00:07.294 --> 03:00:17.342
It's all that one little sand strip in the Middle East that controls everything with blackmail and drugs and money and hookers and stuff like that.

03:00:18.123 --> 03:00:19.284
I'm gonna end it right now.

03:00:19.404 --> 03:00:21.805
I still had a whole nother hour of video to go.

03:00:22.106 --> 03:00:22.766
I can't do it.

03:00:23.086 --> 03:00:26.269
I'm running out of gas and I need a break and I will see you tomorrow.

03:00:26.329 --> 03:00:27.330
Thanks for being here, guys.

03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:47.020
Sorry that I'm ending it so abruptly, but it is 9 20 and Yeah, I guess Israel is in it's the Jews it was all the Jews I guess that that's it America's run by the Jews and so there's nothing we can do about it because they control everything Thanks for being here.

03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:52.603
Thanks for being there Thanks for being in a part of the show and I'll see you tomorrow

03:01:18.677 --> 03:01:19.859
Yeah.

03:02:05.626 --> 03:02:11.690
Hey everyone, so last month I traveled to New York City for a live debate against some very prominent anti-vaxxers.

03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:17.954
It was actually a very productive exchange where we were able to find a lot of common ground and everyone in the audience left a little smarter.

03:02:18.354 --> 03:02:22.457
I'm just kidding, it was a complete shitshow where one of the frauds basically rage quit.

03:02:22.757 --> 03:02:25.019
Who are these assholes and how did it go down?

03:02:25.399 --> 03:02:26.360
Let me tell you all about it.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:27.741
There it is.

03:02:28.181 --> 03:02:30.723
I told you it was a setup, ladies and gentlemen.

03:02:31.244 --> 03:02:33.345
This guy's got 4 million subscribers.

03:02:33.465 --> 03:02:44.174
More people know that Steve Kirsch is a fraud and that Pierre Kory is a fraud than ever knew their name before they went on stage with Dave Farina.

03:02:44.775 --> 03:02:50.580
So you gotta ask the question, why would they go on stage with him if they really supported RFK

03:02:52.481 --> 03:03:00.323
and Donald Trump on a tour that's called the Anti-RFK Tour, unless it was a scripted trap.

03:03:00.803 --> 03:03:02.404
Thanks for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

03:03:02.424 --> 03:03:03.204
See you again tomorrow.

03:03:09.566 --> 03:03:12.727
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

03:03:14.401 --> 03:03:15.443
Isn't this thing great?

03:03:16.024 --> 03:03:18.108
I mean, isn't this just great?

03:03:18.228 --> 03:03:20.251
Wait cut cut cut.

03:03:20.672 --> 03:03:21.674
Isn't this just great?

03:03:21.794 --> 03:03:23.497
Why isn't she not this one?

03:03:24.458 --> 03:03:25.320
Isn't that just great?

03:03:26.522 --> 03:03:27.123
Thanks Ziggy
