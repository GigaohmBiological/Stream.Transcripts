01:19.071 --> 01:20.434
Now, I know I'm not in uniform right now.

01:20.534 --> 01:21.796
That's because I'm going undercover.

01:21.916 --> 01:26.965
In light of all the recent false flag shootings, you might be wondering, how do I get on in on the action, you know?

01:27.025 --> 01:29.990
What do I gotta do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

01:32.537 --> 01:34.339
I might get in on that action.

01:34.820 --> 01:44.350
Lucky for you, citizen of the United States, and Biden's Build Back Better bill, because he loves you so much, absconded in the 10,000 pages Federal False Flag Subsidization Program.

01:44.470 --> 01:50.517
For example, if you're thinking, you know what, maybe I don't have the nerve to do something crazy, we'll give you all the SSRIs and fluoride you need.

01:50.537 --> 01:52.920
You're thinking, where do I get the money for these fancy guns?

01:53.140 --> 01:54.141
Where do you think these, like,

01:54.401 --> 02:14.075
mentally ill mcdonalds workers got the money from in this economy if you're wondering where to get money from just go on the internet and say that you're having violent thoughts all of our boys will swarm in there onto your venmo account to send you money our best discord groomers do your discord account to give you all the instruction manuals quick rundowns and everything really we're trying to make this as easy for you as possible especially if you're a minority

02:14.355 --> 02:18.236
If you're retarded in some way, we have all the affirmative action to get you on your feet.

02:18.336 --> 02:21.437
Before you get started, though, we don't want you to injure yourself in any way, at least not yet.

02:21.457 --> 02:23.198
You can do that after it's all said and done.

02:23.278 --> 02:29.160
Here's a little thing you gotta know about gun safety, first of all, is you want to be waving it in as many directions as possible at all times.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.442
Loaded check the chamber to make sure there's a bullet in there.

02:32.742 --> 02:33.543
Just have fun with it.

02:33.563 --> 02:36.305
Really do it for me Do it to save the white race.

02:36.545 --> 02:37.065
It was you guys.

02:37.085 --> 02:37.525
It's Sophia.

02:37.565 --> 02:38.766
Just getting ready for the pride parade.

02:39.327 --> 02:52.676
Oh, hey, didn't see you there I'm just here getting ready to go to the pride parade considering I'm going to a GSA meet pretty soon So when you're kind of, you know playing around with a gun as you do, you should always be playing around with it You want to keep your finger directly on the trigger?

02:52.696 --> 02:59.280
So you're always ready in case any sort of homosexual person Strolls by and you see you holding the gun like this, okay

03:00.462 --> 03:01.665
I want you to take yourself out.

03:01.945 --> 03:07.918
The way you gotta do it, you gotta take your gun like so, thusly, and, uh, you know, shoot yourself in the back of the head.

03:09.471 --> 03:13.892
So guys, one of the classic ways to make your whole thing more comical is going akimbo.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.933
Very impractical, very un-tactical.

03:16.973 --> 03:20.514
You want to make sure you're really close together so you don't start hitting each other when you're trying to shoot.

03:21.235 --> 03:27.576
You start colliding with each other, you're shooting your other gun with each other.

03:28.137 --> 03:33.118
If you're worried your gun might be malfunctioning, it isn't working properly, just make sure to test it on yourself.

03:39.957 --> 03:44.581
Alright guys, you wanna make sure to do some shenanigans as far as, you know, how many bullets your mags actually carry.

03:44.621 --> 03:46.682
Just make it so that the numbers don't add up.

03:52.747 --> 03:59.292
So, just in case you're not very imaginative, I'll give you some ideas of what sort of things you're supposed to say when you're shooting, okay?

03:59.312 --> 04:00.213
Alright.

04:00.633 --> 04:04.757
I'm doing this for you, Hitler!

04:06.178 --> 04:07.279
I'm doing this for you, Trump!

04:09.042 --> 04:11.204
This is the most offensive one of them all, okay?

04:11.264 --> 04:12.264
Use this one with caution.

04:13.405 --> 04:14.366
Let's go, Brandon!

04:15.527 --> 04:16.708
Subscribe to PewDiePie!

04:19.577 --> 04:21.458
vaccine, if you think about it.

04:21.478 --> 04:26.461
You know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.922
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

04:29.982 --> 04:39.447
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

04:39.467 --> 04:46.051
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.882
pass the time to our next honored guest.

04:51.422 --> 04:54.444
And yeah, I will keep fighting until the last minute.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.906
Last minute, for me, all for Chinese Communist Party.

04:58.186 --> 04:58.566
Thank you.

05:05.750 --> 05:15.636
Dr. Li Min Yang is not only a hero to the Chinese people, not only a hero to the American people, she's a hero to all mankind.

05:32.588 --> 05:48.357
The last thing I want to say, when Dr. Li-Man Yang left Hong Kong in the middle of the night because of the great work of the Rule of Law Foundation, the Rule of Law Society, the great heroes there and supporters, she defected and came out with tremendous danger to herself.

05:49.238 --> 05:56.642
When she first got here, I think we spent three, four, five days in due diligence with lawyers and scientists and all of that.

05:57.483 --> 06:00.905
And I have to say about her personal journey, she was

06:01.972 --> 06:04.494
very meek, very shy.

06:05.395 --> 06:11.219
The woman that was on the stage tonight was so shy and so demurred.

06:11.239 --> 06:27.932
I got to tell you, one year of breathing the fresh air of freedom has... We have to get her citizenship because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

06:30.293 --> 06:30.934
Thank you.

06:32.136 --> 06:32.776
Thank you.

06:32.856 --> 06:33.676
Thank you, Ariel.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.318
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa.

06:39.578 --> 06:41.179
Oh, time out, JC on the bike.

06:42.219 --> 06:43.099
JC on the bike.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.100
It's JC on the bike.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.180
It's JC on the bike.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.100
Yeah.

06:48.761 --> 06:52.902
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning.

06:53.322 --> 06:54.942
And I know just the one.

06:55.843 --> 06:56.683
Look it round.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.163
It's JC on the bike.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.864
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

07:03.382 --> 07:17.452
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America.

07:17.592 --> 07:18.033
I don't know.

07:18.693 --> 07:19.534
Crash the dollar.

07:19.754 --> 07:20.174
I don't know.

07:20.715 --> 07:24.658
Steal the rest of our our what limited treasury value we have left.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.378
I don't know.

07:26.959 --> 07:27.920
But I know for sure.

07:28.325 --> 07:45.799
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

07:48.081 --> 07:50.122
Protect yourself at all times.

07:50.623 --> 07:52.524
Follow my instructions.

07:52.544 --> 07:53.225
Keep it clean.

07:53.285 --> 07:54.285
Touch gloves if you wish.

07:54.305 --> 07:54.726
Let's do it.

07:56.118 --> 07:56.858
Sweaty palms.

07:57.118 --> 07:58.679
This is so crazy.

07:59.419 --> 08:00.299
Like goosebumps.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.100
This is so crazy.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.361
I feel so nervous.

08:04.401 --> 08:12.484
Like what in the world, man?

08:14.804 --> 08:16.065
The Matrix is a system, Neil.

08:18.021 --> 08:19.502
That system is our enemy.

08:19.962 --> 08:22.463
But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

08:22.544 --> 08:29.307
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save.

08:29.728 --> 08:34.710
But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.

08:34.910 --> 08:39.373
You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

08:40.173 --> 08:46.177
And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

08:48.732 --> 08:49.873
Were you listening to me, Neo?

08:50.793 --> 08:52.294
Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

08:53.014 --> 08:53.894
I was... Look again.

08:55.795 --> 08:56.195
Freeze it.

09:01.218 --> 09:04.179
This... This isn't the Matrix.

09:04.399 --> 09:04.599
No.

09:06.820 --> 09:09.201
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.363
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.707
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

13:36.827 --> 13:42.471
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

13:43.902 --> 13:45.685
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.969
It's embarrassing.

14:20.383 --> 14:20.483
you

15:03.774 --> 15:04.814
Good afternoon, everybody.

15:04.854 --> 15:06.475
This is GigaOM Biological.

15:07.596 --> 15:11.337
I've got a little throat problem the last couple days, so I took a couple days off.

15:13.376 --> 15:14.797
I don't know, I'm still annoyed by it.

15:14.817 --> 15:17.158
I'm going to try and talk as softly as we can.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.241
Stop all transfections in humans is one way to say it.

15:22.281 --> 15:24.462
If you don't know who I am, my name is Jonathan Cui.

15:25.082 --> 15:35.848
You can search for C-O-U-E-Y on the internet, on PubMed, and you can find all of the stuff I did as an academic biologist when I was a patch clamp physiologist.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.049
That's where gigaohm biological comes from.

15:39.890 --> 15:41.690
That's not the way my voice sounds.

15:50.973 --> 15:52.734
I'm not really sure what's going on here.

15:53.794 --> 16:02.838
Anyway, just like the beginning slide there, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is still dumb.

16:03.519 --> 16:08.321
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

16:08.881 --> 16:14.504
I think the first phrase is really a good one because it challenges people to think about it in a way

16:15.244 --> 16:21.108
that also challenges them to revisit what they understand and don't understand about their own immune system.

16:21.608 --> 16:39.500
I think the second one is really interesting to probe people who worked in academic biology or in medical, you know, sciences of any kind to see what their background knowledge is and whether they really know, because this is a word that is present on Robert Malone's resume as far back as we can look,

16:40.020 --> 16:58.395
And finally, the bottom one is a good way to challenge people, especially people who think they're savvy in biology, to explain with some degree of fidelity why it is that RNA can pandemic if you, I guess, coat it with the right proteins that have the right fear and cleavage site or HIV inserts.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.099
We need a new consensus about these ideas.

17:02.159 --> 17:03.119
We need to come back.

17:03.880 --> 17:24.491
to the foundation of the whole crime and what really happened and realized that if they murdered people and lied about it, in order for us to be misled about transfection, in order for us to be misled about the pandemic potential of RNA for a generation, in order for us to trip and fall over

17:25.892 --> 17:31.696
the vaccine schedule in such a way that we will never really notice what they've been doing to us.

17:31.816 --> 17:38.981
Specifically in America, we'll never have the wherewithal to compare our own vaccine schedule to that of other Western countries.

17:39.021 --> 17:46.246
We'll never have the wherewithal to think about what Jessica Rose didn't and didn't do with her coming out about the VAERS signal.

17:46.546 --> 17:49.348
And the same thing with Steve Kirsch and a lot of these other meddlers.

17:49.768 --> 17:53.230
I think at this point in time, I want to be very clear.

17:53.891 --> 17:54.972
I am actually

17:55.772 --> 18:00.816
accusing certain people of having been involved with creating this illusion of consensus.

18:00.836 --> 18:02.497
They don't all have to know what they did.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.821
They don't have to know when they did it at the right time or now.

18:06.881 --> 18:12.545
But in retrospect, they all have to know that they've played a role in running out the clock.

18:13.920 --> 18:25.543
in not making it possible, especially for our young people, you know, like college age kids, people in their 30s, to really usefully exercise informed consent.

18:25.603 --> 18:33.765
And even though these people are now happy to use those words, none of them are on any recording anywhere before 2022 using those words.

18:33.785 --> 18:34.465
And certainly even in 2022,

18:38.166 --> 18:42.387
The use of those words is very, very rare by any of these actors.

18:42.828 --> 18:46.869
And that's because, again, I think the best way to think about it is that they were running out the clock.

18:47.309 --> 18:55.612
The farther we get along in the ride, the harder it is to think back to the original hill of the roller coaster and how exciting it was.

18:56.112 --> 18:56.392
And so

18:57.489 --> 19:06.312
You might get done with a roller coaster at, I don't know, at some particular park and get done with it and say, wow, that first drop was crazy.

19:06.712 --> 19:21.257
But you forget very quickly about how the first drop climb felt and how long it was and how long those clinkity clankity clank noises were and how the, whether the incline was more or less than the previous ride you've been on and this,

19:22.137 --> 19:28.441
is the role of a lot of these people is to make sure that you keep face forward in the ride and that you don't remember how the ride started.

19:28.881 --> 19:38.728
As long as you think that it was exciting and that stuff happened and that this loop was really exciting and then you pulled into the station and then you all turn to each other and go, wow, that was amazing.

19:38.788 --> 19:39.909
I can't believe that we're here.

19:40.816 --> 19:42.117
Let's go to the next ride.

19:42.437 --> 19:43.819
And then you get on the next ride.

19:44.239 --> 19:53.187
And it's this illusion that you're choosing what ride you go on and that it's up to you whether you wait in that line for the big ride or you wait in this line.

19:53.627 --> 19:57.691
And that by going on social media, you're choosing what rides you ride in the park.

19:58.131 --> 20:04.717
And this is already an illusion, nevermind the idea of who you're arguing with or who you're getting your information from.

20:05.879 --> 20:14.203
Most of these people's idea is to run out the clock to keep you facing forward in a ride that's actually not a ride.

20:14.263 --> 20:25.609
It's like one of those, those machines that's mounted on arms and you all sit down inside the machine and there was a, there was a screen in front of you and then, you know, you were supposed to be in a spaceship and it's going to take off.

20:28.430 --> 20:34.014
And when it gets hit by stuff, it all shakes and everybody gets excited, but it's really just the front window.

20:34.795 --> 20:40.219
That's what social media has done to us, to all of us, and is doing to our kids actively now.

20:40.659 --> 20:48.786
And it's doing to any of our family members and our neighbors that are actively engaged in social media as if it's a window to the real world.

20:49.446 --> 20:50.127
And it's not.

20:50.967 --> 20:54.310
And all of these people are part of an illusion

20:55.519 --> 21:02.403
part of an illusion of consensus that was created specifically using the weaponized social media platforms.

21:03.003 --> 21:09.066
It's not the censorship that the government requested from the social media platforms.

21:09.166 --> 21:14.188
It's the social media platforms themselves that are now effectively governing us.

21:14.248 --> 21:18.631
It's very similar to what Edward Bernays said was happening already back in the 20s.

21:19.611 --> 21:33.360
And so as we are focused on trying to vote for the right person and trying to campaign for the right guy, we're voting for people whose whole existence is dependent on the gatekeepers of social media.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.463
Their narratives are dependent on the gatekeepers of social media.

21:37.503 --> 21:43.747
Their continued success and rising in the consciousness of people is solely dependent on social media.

21:44.167 --> 21:47.950
If social media doesn't want you to be able to search for Trump assassination 2024,

21:49.532 --> 21:51.383
When you search for it, nothing will show up.

21:54.542 --> 21:55.883
This is an illusion.

21:55.923 --> 22:06.487
And by participating it in on your phone, by going onto these media platforms, you are getting on there and getting in their little cabin cabin with a little screen on it.

22:06.848 --> 22:12.730
And you're buckling in and getting and agreeing to go along with the suspension of disbelief.

22:12.790 --> 22:13.171
Okay.

22:13.231 --> 22:14.091
Give me your ride.

22:14.131 --> 22:14.731
Here we go.

22:14.831 --> 22:16.652
John Cullen, here we go.

22:16.672 --> 22:20.034
Uh, you know, John Goodman, here we go.

22:20.054 --> 22:22.815
Uh, Robert Malone,

22:25.117 --> 22:40.884
And that's what these people are, all of them, wittingly or unwittingly, if they are not fundamentally resisting the concept that social media is weaponized against us and that you can't use social media to escape.

22:43.166 --> 22:43.926
You just can't.

22:45.285 --> 22:49.048
because you can't go viral on social media by accident.

22:49.088 --> 22:55.372
You can't go, it doesn't happen because your idea is really good or your stream was just the best stream ever.

22:55.432 --> 22:56.412
That doesn't happen.

22:57.273 --> 23:03.057
And it won't happen if you write the best sub stack either, because these people rise artificially.

23:09.773 --> 23:27.984
The latest example in the social media that I've seen is that some guy who wrote a book about Kamala Harris had it on Amazon before is now, apparently that book's been taken off of Amazon, but maybe that was all by design so that everybody wants to read that book and that book is part of the illusion too, who knows?

23:28.624 --> 23:30.225
That's how deep the game is.

23:31.426 --> 23:38.871
But if we look at and focus on the biologists in the story, focus on the people that are supposed to be the biology experts,

23:39.827 --> 23:42.368
I think we can see what's going on here.

23:42.408 --> 23:46.090
Wow, my throat didn't really start hurting until right now.

23:46.190 --> 23:46.850
It's interesting.

23:53.453 --> 23:54.913
So let's watch this video from 2017 and see

23:58.308 --> 24:06.550
how much we recognize, because again, I want you to see that Robert Malone, just like Li Min Yan, was in on this before the pandemic.

24:06.590 --> 24:20.674
Li Min Yan, as Mark Kulak of Houstatonic ITS has shown us over the past couple of weeks, was nothing but a relatively new rookie on the bench of these NIAID

24:22.754 --> 24:24.054
pandemic people.

24:24.615 --> 24:48.503
She presented in 2018 in the same conference that Peter Daszak was the keynote speaker and that Kasimi, whatever her name is, mRNA lady, also presented and she presented about the spike protein and she presented about stabilized spike proteins, which of course would be something that in 2020 would be talked about as some kind of new technology that these really smart people had to figure out how to

24:48.763 --> 24:52.906
Stabilize the spike protein when Kissimmee or whatever name is kiss.

24:53.366 --> 24:53.707
I don't know.

24:53.747 --> 25:16.243
I'm sorry has been gave a presentation in 2018 already about that technology and about how all the spike proteins are homologous so you can basically do it the same way with all of them and it's so the misrepresentation of the evolving level of knowledge the misrepresentation of event 201 as being the event we had to point to

25:16.643 --> 25:22.905
and pay attention to instead of the one that came one year earlier is already very extraordinary discovery.

25:22.965 --> 25:36.248
But to find Li Min Yan there presenting about universal flu vaccines, to see her there probably intermingling with them, even having dinners with them, this is just an extraordinary thing.

25:36.288 --> 25:41.910
Never mind her connections between her husband and those people that she studied and published with.

25:42.910 --> 25:45.591
Robert Malone feels like a guy who's right in there.

25:47.444 --> 25:58.271
If in 2017, one year before the video with Li Min Yan and the lady from the MRNA, the

25:59.673 --> 26:02.275
the African-American lady that was on the front of Time.

26:03.215 --> 26:06.498
Maybe somebody already put it in, Kizmekia Corbett, thank you very much.

26:07.758 --> 26:10.901
This video was recorded, which I find interesting.

26:11.241 --> 26:17.705
When you're setting out to develop something, I think it's a good idea to know what it is your objective is that you're trying to develop for.

26:18.305 --> 26:29.253
And so what we did very early in the outbreak is we reached to one of the top modeling groups in the world right now for infectious disease, which is the laboratory group of Dr. Ira Lunghini.

26:30.714 --> 26:40.443
Ira and his group did a lot of the modeling for the ring containment studies with Ebola that was successful in demonstrating the activity of that vaccine for that outbreak.

26:42.225 --> 26:53.836
So I asked Ira if he could... So a ring containment study is when there's an outbreak in a village and then you use the vaccine to kind of stop the spread in villages, in the surrounding villages.

26:55.097 --> 26:58.682
So it's essentially an excuse to do a human experiment.

26:58.762 --> 27:07.012
First, you send somebody like Stephen Hadfield out into the middle of a forest and you release the vaccine-like particle.

27:07.412 --> 27:12.078
Vaccine-like particle, right?

27:12.098 --> 27:13.720
Is it vaccine-like something?

27:13.760 --> 27:14.381
Vaccine-like

27:15.160 --> 27:21.844
Anyway, you release this thing that Sina Bavaria and David Hone have a patent on, and you see how far it goes within that village.

27:21.884 --> 27:28.068
And at the same time, you use that outbreak excuse to vaccinate the villages around.

27:28.588 --> 27:38.114
And you can use that data to see to what extent your countermeasures can interact with that thing that you deployed in the jungle and claim it's just bushmeat.

27:38.234 --> 27:41.236
We just landed here and found this stuff going on.

27:42.557 --> 27:45.359
And so that's what a ring vaccination study is.

27:45.419 --> 27:59.150
Now, far be it for me to say, you know, I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking, we don't know the difference between a rural deployment of a virus-like particle.

27:59.370 --> 28:00.311
Sorry, what was I saying?

28:00.631 --> 28:01.672
Vaccine-like particle?

28:01.732 --> 28:10.019
Virus-like particle deployed by a government agency or a non-government organization or a terrorist organization.

28:10.679 --> 28:17.985
in the middle of the Congo, and then a careful observation of how far it goes and who gets infected and how deadly it is.

28:18.505 --> 28:30.594
And then later on, subsequently, maybe the deployment of novel and interesting sort of countermeasures to that same virus-like particle that you were testing in previous deployments.

28:31.115 --> 28:36.799
And so this kind of thing seems just as likely as the idea that somebody

28:37.379 --> 28:53.850
Butchered the wrong chimpanzee and then failed to cook it sufficiently or whatever the Argument would be that that caused the zoonotic transmission that led to a whole village of people dying of bleeding eyeballs So it's really cool to see that in 2017.

28:54.230 --> 29:00.575
He was just as smooth as he is now in fact Could do the calculations

29:01.961 --> 29:11.824
to determine how effective a drug would need to be if it was administered to a community or a household or a factory, small town.

29:12.565 --> 29:24.609
If a drug could be administered like a vaccine prophylactically, how effective would that drug have to be in order to reduce the reproduction rate, the infection efficiency of the virus?

29:25.399 --> 29:26.980
to below one.

29:27.320 --> 29:46.367
What that means is an R0 of less than one, if I get infected, if I have the drug and 70% of the people around me are also taking the drug, how effective would that drug need to be to make it so that the probability of me infecting somebody else is less than one?

29:47.408 --> 29:51.970
If the reproduction coefficient drops below one, then the epidemic is extinguished.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.371
So I was able to model this

29:55.509 --> 30:05.057
And the answer is, depending on how efficiently the virus is transmitted, that's a function of mosquito density and population density and all kinds of different variables.

30:05.717 --> 30:15.465
But what he showed was that a drug only would need to be about between 20 and 50 percent effective if it's administered to 70 percent of the population.

30:16.300 --> 30:31.303
for the whole range of reproduction coefficients that's seen with Zika up to an R-naught of six, we could, with a drug that's even partially effective, we can drop that below one and cause the outbreak to extinguish within a community.

30:33.001 --> 30:56.853
Now, I find that pretty extraordinary for a number of reasons, talking about are not, but more importantly, talking about a drug as being between 20 and 50% effective and how, in his imagination, that's totally normal to talk like that, but not understanding that a 20% to 50% effective drug to measure a signal that's that small,

30:58.123 --> 31:10.369
to accurately scientifically verify in some, you know, reproducible manner that a drug is 20% effective is absolutely absurd.

31:11.070 --> 31:18.373
And so in 2017, Robert Malone was already selling this kind of pseudoscience at the highest level.

31:19.714 --> 31:21.155
And that's what you should see it as.

31:21.195 --> 31:27.118
It is pseudoscience at the highest level that P values, which indicate an effective

31:28.362 --> 31:45.533
and effectivity of 20% is something that he considers scientifically valid and worth talking about, mentioning and discussing in the context of a mathematical model that supposedly recapitulates the spread of a virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes.

31:57.079 --> 31:58.840
And this was Robert Malone in 2017.

31:59.461 --> 32:08.268
So you should not think for one second that it is for any other reason than being off script that they brought him on the scene in 2021.

32:09.249 --> 32:13.733
They hadn't scared enough people into taking transfection and transformation.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.661
and the train was already off the rails.

32:17.121 --> 32:26.965
So they brought this dude in, and if you wanna see how for sure they brought him in, just go watch the Brett Weinstein podcast with him again from June of 2021.

32:28.445 --> 32:32.066
With him and Steve Kirsch, you can find it on Rumble and lots of other places.

32:33.427 --> 32:40.169
And the reason why you need to watch it is very simple, because you can see that Robert Malone is not as comfortable as he was here in March of 2017.

32:43.305 --> 32:46.166
He's just not as comfortable with his companions.

32:46.246 --> 32:48.647
He's not as comfortable with Steve Kirsch.

32:48.687 --> 32:52.008
He's not as comfortable with Brett Weinstein.

32:52.048 --> 32:56.769
You can see that there is an active something happening there.

32:59.450 --> 33:09.613
And I think from that moment on, the narrative and the curation of it was shifted in a way that they never thought that they were going to have to do.

33:10.253 --> 33:13.315
And they had to double down on things that they didn't want to double down on.

33:13.355 --> 33:30.445
And one of the ways that they doubled down was to bring Robert Malone to the front and have him on beaches in Hawaii and have him on CHD chapter affiliate shows and blog posts and everything for him to practice.

33:30.545 --> 33:37.009
Because that's also why he would have been on a podcast with somebody like Paul Cottrell, who's definitely not an MD.

33:38.151 --> 33:45.296
who's definitely a meddler because of his close association with people like Kevin McCairn and George Webb.

33:45.977 --> 33:59.046
And yet Robert Malone was happy to associate with him in 2021 as he figured out what his shtick would be and spread his name far and wide as the foremost authority on this stuff.

34:04.315 --> 34:06.818
And so you can think about it in a little broader terms.

34:06.898 --> 34:11.984
Right now, we're still experiencing this, I think, where weaponized piles of money have used social media.

34:22.793 --> 34:27.716
to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

34:28.376 --> 34:33.499
Weaponized piles of money have used social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

34:33.940 --> 34:47.147
Participating in the argument accepts the premise of their narrative by default, and we are governed by a theater that spans from mainstream media to all social media platforms and includes all sides of their mythologies.

34:48.732 --> 34:53.596
Yeah, I'm really worried about what my voice sounds like right now, but maybe it's just something that will go away.

34:54.897 --> 35:07.026
So just to give you an idea, just a little sliver of what any of you could have managed to do, but maybe a lot of us didn't do it, is to think about what Barda is.

35:09.628 --> 35:15.338
Everybody's always saying DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, and DOD, DOD, DOD, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA.

35:15.759 --> 35:21.849
But nobody ever mentions Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which falls under ASPR.

35:24.403 --> 35:37.582
which is the, of course, the second in command, really, at Health and Human Services but is essentially the Assistant Secretary of Pandemic Preparedness, right, or something like that.

35:40.146 --> 35:55.195
My point is that whoever is in charge of this group is actually really quite important, and it shouldn't really surprise you that Gary Leo Dispro has a page on HousatonicITS.com.

35:56.055 --> 35:59.718
If it does surprise you, then you haven't been using his website very well.

36:00.598 --> 36:03.780
I just want to play a video that is freely available on YouTube of

36:05.561 --> 36:18.514
Dr. Disbro explaining what it is that BARDA does and and then ask yourself why it would be that we would be talking about DARPA and DOD instead of ASPR and BARDA.

36:19.346 --> 36:24.287
Hello, I am Gary Disbrow, Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

36:25.088 --> 36:35.411
BARDA was established in 2006 to support the development of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and innovative technologies that could be used when a public health emergency occurs.

36:36.491 --> 36:42.073
The 2022 BARDA Strategic Plan builds on what we have learned and accomplished over the last 15 years.

36:43.956 --> 36:54.222
This five-year plan sets forth how we will continue to work with our private sector and government partners to further secure the nation against a wide range of threats to our national health security.

36:55.163 --> 37:04.809
The BARDA model has proven successful in leveraging public-private partnerships to accelerate development of medical countermeasures that are vital to national security.

37:06.109 --> 37:11.993
BARDA helps its partners from advanced research and development through FDA licensure and clinical use.

37:13.302 --> 37:16.684
During the next five years, BARDA has four strategic goals.

37:17.685 --> 37:22.488
Rapidly develop safe, effective medical countermeasures accessible to all Americans.

37:23.488 --> 37:26.450
Maintain a sustainable, mission-ready response posture.

37:27.631 --> 37:30.313
Leverage mechanisms to foster flexible partnerships.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.695
Build and support a world-class workforce.

37:34.801 --> 37:46.028
Our mission-ready posture to deliver life-saving medical countermeasures quickly in an emergency requires enhancing our workforce of highly skilled professionals who can support our unique public health mission.

37:47.369 --> 37:57.215
Since its inception, BARDA has supported over 60 FDA approvals, licensures, or clearances of products that increase domestic and global preparedness.

37:58.416 --> 38:10.442
Among these are vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutics used to protect individuals during public health emergencies, such as Zika, the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

38:11.562 --> 38:26.850
We are excited to release our five-year strategic plan and look forward to working together with our interagency and private sector partners, our stakeholders, and our workforce, continuing to fortify the nation's health security over the next five years and beyond.

38:29.406 --> 38:31.568
Medicalcountermeasures.gov.

38:31.628 --> 38:32.949
I mean, what more do you want to hear?

38:32.989 --> 38:40.436
They're actually in the business of fulfilling the PrEP Act countermeasure, you know, gaping hole.

38:40.496 --> 38:41.477
We need countermeasures.

38:41.497 --> 38:44.020
We got to fill it with things that come from BARDA.

38:45.942 --> 38:47.443
And nobody ever talks about BARDA.

38:47.463 --> 38:49.884
I'm not saying that I'm going to start talking about BARDA today.

38:49.904 --> 39:08.571
I just mean that if you listen to these people and listen to their certainty about what they say, and listen to their certainty about the motives that I have, or just listen to them ignore me after talking to me for three years, you can see that this illusion of consensus is done specifically that way.

39:09.131 --> 39:12.092
There are a few people who are telling the truth and they need to be ignored.

39:12.472 --> 39:16.453
And everybody else can be promoted and argued with and chatted with.

39:16.473 --> 39:29.076
You know, John Cullen can come on Brett Weinstein's podcast, even though three times in 2022, him and his wife decided to mention my name for biological ideas on their podcast.

39:29.516 --> 39:33.297
But they've never decided to have me on when I was still friends with them.

39:34.157 --> 39:35.958
But now John Cullen

39:36.781 --> 39:48.084
in a total agreement with their friend, Chris Martinson, needed to be promoted for his really insightful analysis about the audiophiles and the shooters of Donald Trump.

39:48.124 --> 40:04.048
Now, what's really interesting about this is all of these biologists, none of them are interested in the Wolverine-style healing of the wound that apparently should be there, but it's not there, or the apparent not discussion of this by his sons or anybody else.

40:05.327 --> 40:19.015
Even though when you do a ballistics discussion of it on YouTube, you find that it would be pretty hard to hit a person's ear with a bullet and cause blood without also pretty destroying part of the ear.

40:21.408 --> 40:24.511
it's pretty hard to get a paper cut from a bullet.

40:24.992 --> 40:29.997
And certainly everything that we've been told would suggest that he was shot in the ear.

40:31.639 --> 40:35.483
And so if he's shot in the ear, there should be some evidence of that.

40:35.523 --> 40:38.246
And yet no evidence has ever been offered.

40:38.667 --> 40:42.070
And these people are totally and completely focused on the

40:43.952 --> 40:50.337
the audio files and whether or not they show one shooter or two shooters or three shooters for a few days.

40:50.377 --> 40:53.039
It was whether or not it was on the water tower.

40:53.379 --> 41:10.272
And the interesting thing is it was Brett Weinstein, Chris Martinson, uh, John Cullen associated with Goodman who's associated with George Webb and George Webb is the arch nemesis of, of Robert Malone makes it a really tiny little network of, of meddlers.

41:19.531 --> 41:21.453
I mean, that's what it bothers me about it.

41:22.834 --> 41:27.618
So if we look at some of the ways this is done, let me get this blanked here.

41:28.220 --> 41:32.562
Here's Chris Martinson again talking about the shooters.

41:32.602 --> 41:34.743
This is from a couple of days ago, but it still doesn't matter.

41:34.763 --> 41:36.704
This is from the 22nd already.

41:37.524 --> 41:41.646
But look what's happening here already on the 22nd of July.

41:42.046 --> 41:55.072
We have, of course, Jikki Leakes agreeing that we should argue about George Webb and John Cullen, and even says 40 minutes of projection matched only by Housatonic Live's similar rant.

41:55.632 --> 42:05.638
And so he's trying to say that George Webb is being thrown under the bus by his buddy, John Cullen, but Housatonic did a similar thing.

42:05.718 --> 42:08.180
So is George Webb a distraction?

42:08.240 --> 42:12.523
I guess Jiki Leak says that, and Knuckle agrees with him.

42:12.883 --> 42:20.408
Interestingly, several posts later, here's Jiki Leak saying, is that the same Goodman that Nest Commander enjoys reading?

42:26.041 --> 42:32.204
And so it's just an illusion of consensus about who's important to talk about, who's interesting to think about.

42:32.264 --> 42:53.755
Now, if you think about the idea that Jiki Leaks is supposed to be in Australia and believes wholeheartedly in Kevin McKernan and gets really mad if people talk about Robert Malone and Pierre Kory instead of Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci, then you can see what this show is all about because

42:54.235 --> 42:56.456
Chris Martinson was in that signal chat.

42:56.616 --> 43:04.639
He knows just as well as Brett Weinstein that transfection was the word they should have used in 2021 because I told all of them.

43:07.060 --> 43:09.560
Alexandros Marinos was also in that chat.

43:10.101 --> 43:12.001
Matt Crawford was also in that chat.

43:12.061 --> 43:13.922
Roller Gator was also in that chat.

43:14.502 --> 43:17.003
Heather Haying was also in that chat.

43:17.043 --> 43:21.044
They all know and they knew in 2021 and they've done nothing about it.

43:21.084 --> 43:22.385
They've never bothered to.

43:24.105 --> 43:25.245
That's what's extraordinary.

43:25.285 --> 43:27.406
Chris Martinson does hour-long streams.

43:27.446 --> 43:31.287
Why didn't he teach the meaning of transfection and transformation by now?

43:31.668 --> 43:33.448
He's a pathologist trained at Duke.

43:35.049 --> 43:42.571
And of course, they were all told to do it by me in that signal chat that still exists, but I'm no longer a part of.

43:44.712 --> 43:47.533
Because I copied, I mean, I recorded it all.

43:47.593 --> 43:48.333
It's archived.

43:48.373 --> 43:49.834
They can't turn it around now.

43:49.934 --> 43:50.434
They knew.

43:51.889 --> 43:56.134
They were able to ask questions and they got answers and they still didn't say it.

43:56.595 --> 44:08.549
And they are not saying it now because they are actively collaborating with other meddlers from other Five Eyes countries and misleading the young of America to believe that America is responsible.

44:11.001 --> 44:18.830
That's why you see here this Canadian guy, Dr. William Mackus, responding to me, but not really responding to me.

44:18.870 --> 44:27.761
In this same thread, when you look for him saying that you should see how many people in the freedom movement want me gone, silence disappeared.

44:27.801 --> 44:28.321
Yeah, right.

44:29.073 --> 44:31.274
That's why people share his work.

44:31.314 --> 44:35.715
That's why he puts out four or five mini sub stack videos a day.

44:35.815 --> 44:42.897
Sometimes it's just absurd how these people claim to be censored or to be pushed down.

44:42.957 --> 44:44.117
What was he doing in 2020?

44:44.877 --> 44:45.618
What was he doing in 2021?

44:46.418 --> 44:47.698
He wasn't using his MD.

44:50.739 --> 44:52.740
And what did he do since he's been on my show?

44:52.780 --> 44:54.100
Did he ever tell anybody that?

44:54.720 --> 44:54.940
No.

44:56.121 --> 44:57.361
Did he ever want to interview me?

44:57.421 --> 44:57.561
No.

44:58.416 --> 45:02.178
He came on my show, but didn't want to talk to me on his show.

45:06.681 --> 45:17.106
And he's a Canadian working with Americans to talk about the shot in the turbo cancers and not look back far enough to realize that murder in America was lied about.

45:17.146 --> 45:18.167
And that's how we got here.

45:20.151 --> 45:23.915
who promotes him as a failed surgeon, which he's not.

45:24.035 --> 45:28.339
So then this is perfect because Robert Malone says, yes, isn't he a failed surgeon?

45:28.359 --> 45:31.181
And then people go and look into the fact that he's not a failed surgeon.

45:31.602 --> 45:33.884
And then, wow, I guess I trust Mac is now.

45:37.762 --> 45:48.991
And in the meantime, in this same thread, I asked him, could you speak out about supplemental oxygen and how that could have been used to get disease progression that was misconstrued as COVID?

45:49.671 --> 45:52.413
And he said, oh, that's not my expertise.

45:56.757 --> 45:58.418
That's also what Jay Bhattacharya said.

45:58.438 --> 46:01.600
He can't evaluate my biology because that's not his expertise.

46:02.101 --> 46:07.165
He's an economist and an epidemiologist, but I should stop attacking Robert Malone.

46:11.572 --> 46:15.574
So I think I'm gonna keep going Just to keep in mind though.

46:15.594 --> 46:18.515
I haven't I just want to remind you of something.

46:19.095 --> 46:20.036
Let me do this.

46:24.158 --> 46:36.603
I Was going through this list here that I showed you earlier That is from the acknowledgements page of the Wuhan cover-up book and in the acknowledgements page whoops

46:40.424 --> 46:45.426
In the acknowledgements page, there are some things to see here in terms of my name and then Gavin DeBecker.

46:45.466 --> 46:48.787
That's Bobby's security guy and best friend.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.387
Meryl Nass, you know.

46:50.608 --> 46:51.688
Francis Boyle, you know.

46:51.728 --> 46:54.989
He's a lawyer from University of Illinois who talks a lot about bioweapons.

46:55.089 --> 46:58.990
Paul Thacker has a wiki.

46:59.491 --> 47:00.751
Brett Weinstein has a wiki.

47:00.791 --> 47:05.253
Lee Smith is a... A lot of these people are authors.

47:07.668 --> 47:29.893
Why I got down here to Annie Jacobson I didn't know who she was and when I was originally reading this I was just saying I she's I think she's pretty good But then then I of course did some you know Look at into all these people and I found out that I'm one of the only people on that list that doesn't have a wiki And and certainly I'm one of the few people on that list that doesn't have several books or or or years of

47:30.931 --> 47:34.112
of experience talking about bioweapons.

47:34.132 --> 47:37.113
So I'm a new guy on that list.

47:39.514 --> 47:53.339
But this lady that I was talking about before, this Annie Jacobson, one of the people that's listed as a reader, actually, oh shoot, that's out of order.

47:56.520 --> 47:59.921
Okay, so let me escape out of here and put this afterward.

48:01.453 --> 48:03.074
And then we'll go back to this current slide.

48:03.335 --> 48:13.541
Yeah So Annie Jacobson was recently on April 2nd 2024 talking about nuclear war With Lex Friedman.

48:13.581 --> 48:27.931
We know that Lex Friedman's a one of theirs You know, he's supposed to be some kind of MIT professor about AI or something like that author Annie Jacobson was also more recently July 10th on Joe Rogan

48:30.534 --> 48:36.917
And she was also on this thing called Diary of a CEO in May of 2023, or a little bit earlier.

48:36.937 --> 48:45.222
And so she has this book where she apparently spent some years investigating the potential for a nuclear winner and what happens when a war happens.

48:46.523 --> 48:49.845
And also we have Kyrgyzstan, of course, doing a little cartoon about it.

48:50.746 --> 48:55.709
This is the now, of course, Bill Gates funded propaganda, excuse me.

48:58.803 --> 49:09.886
Propaganda biology kind of thing where you know at the beginning of the pandemic or before the pandemic It was a pretty good channel, but it very quickly got taken over So why is this cool?

49:09.926 --> 49:26.011
Well, it's it's interesting because she's on Joe Rogan's, you know 2174th podcast for two hours and 50 minutes talking about this stuff I

49:31.592 --> 49:35.577
So it's really, yeah, I mean, you have to see it for what it is.

49:35.637 --> 49:36.678
We are being directed.

49:36.758 --> 49:38.761
We are being told what to pay attention to.

49:38.781 --> 49:46.069
We are being told what questions are interesting and what answers are the most pertinent to discuss.

49:47.010 --> 49:51.254
And I think that, you know, the rest of that list is all people.

49:52.346 --> 49:58.307
who wittingly or unwittingly are participating in this narrative curation by focusing on certain things.

49:58.367 --> 50:06.689
Maybe she's smart enough to understand that RNA cannot pandemic and that gain of function is a mythology, but she is actively encouraged.

50:06.709 --> 50:08.129
Hold on one second, let me let the dog out.

50:10.730 --> 50:11.850
It's hot out there though, you know?

50:13.870 --> 50:15.330
It's cool in here, it's hot out there.

50:15.350 --> 50:16.431
You have to push back in.

50:20.865 --> 50:27.108
But she is actively not questioning, you know, the narrative that needs the most questioning like we are here.

50:27.888 --> 50:40.193
And instead, you know, taking the word of a lot of these people that she interviews when it could just be an illusion of consensus about the potential dangers and what people will do if one goes off or whatever.

50:43.001 --> 50:47.385
So just another example of how this might be done.

50:47.625 --> 50:51.388
This is a more mundane example that I stumbled upon the other day.

50:52.869 --> 51:02.456
But this is a channel called Wildlife Trap 8988, which for some reason or another, I found myself watching a Tucker Carlson video.

51:03.217 --> 51:05.898
that was hosted or posted by this channel.

51:06.518 --> 51:15.300
And when I realized what channel I was watching, I was really curious because it also didn't do very well with putting the right date up there.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.921
So then I started investigating the channel a little bit.

51:18.961 --> 51:20.021
It's got 1.23 million subscribers.

51:20.041 --> 51:24.502
It's got 566 million views and they joined in November 25th, 2020.

51:31.937 --> 51:45.342
So that's a pretty skyrocketing channel where they joined in November, 2022, and already they are up to 1.23 million subscribers with just 380 videos.

51:46.042 --> 51:48.343
Now what I find really interesting about this channel

51:49.986 --> 51:58.450
is that before it decided to post some Tucker Carlson videos, it was really only posting these animal trap videos.

51:58.550 --> 52:08.234
And what's really hilarious is the first animal traps that are on this channel are actually animal traps for a bald eagle.

52:17.658 --> 52:19.519
It's all an illusion, ladies and gentlemen.

52:20.529 --> 52:25.311
YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, it's all an illusion.

52:25.451 --> 52:40.596
And if you even allow yourself for a minute to interact with those platforms and think that somehow, because you're not searching for the truth that they don't want you to know, you're finding out the truth about other stuff that doesn't matter.

52:42.097 --> 52:42.397
That's no.

52:44.008 --> 52:45.550
They're all hamster wheels.

52:46.071 --> 52:50.697
They're all very much the wrong question, even if it seems innocuous.

52:50.797 --> 52:51.157
Why?

52:51.678 --> 52:53.521
Because they need to run out the clock.

52:55.723 --> 52:58.027
You only have so many useful minutes every day.

52:59.138 --> 53:05.100
You only have so many useful minutes to make a three minute short about T cell immunology.

53:05.620 --> 53:14.104
And you only have three or four minutes to do anything else that you want to do before you have to go back to your, the required things every day.

53:15.324 --> 53:25.588
And so social media destroys so many people's lives simply by taking their free time and giving people an excuse to waste it.

53:27.438 --> 53:36.381
What we have on gigaohm.bio is a community of people that talking to each other and sharing information, but there's not an algorithm there.

53:37.001 --> 53:40.383
You can block anybody you want to and pay attention to whoever you want to.

53:41.083 --> 53:41.543
And that's it.

53:43.763 --> 53:44.644
Same with PeerTube.

53:44.664 --> 53:45.624
You don't have to sign in.

53:45.664 --> 53:46.845
There's just videos there.

53:46.885 --> 53:55.110
And when you go looking for more videos, you don't find what YouTube wants you to find or what the X program wants you to read next.

53:55.250 --> 53:55.610
No, no.

53:56.351 --> 54:01.354
You find more videos from me or some videos from Mark or some clips that Jeff from Earth cut.

54:01.414 --> 54:01.834
That's it.

54:02.555 --> 54:04.836
And if you want to find other things, you go other places.

54:04.916 --> 54:05.997
And that's the way it should be.

54:07.543 --> 54:10.384
When you want to get ice cream, you should go to the ice cream shop.

54:10.444 --> 54:13.786
And when you want to get groceries, you should go to a grocery store.

54:14.506 --> 54:16.847
When you need gasoline, you should go to a gas station.

54:16.867 --> 54:18.048
There should be no mire.

54:19.807 --> 54:26.053
There should be no store that has a gas, gasoline and also mattresses and also pets.

54:26.173 --> 54:41.467
And also that is the, the, the real world version of what they want you to think of the internet as, you know, because now that everybody's carrying the, the world in their pocket, and that's the illusion.

54:43.086 --> 54:49.490
Kids are being led to believe that they're carrying in their pocket the world and all they have to do is Google search.

54:50.050 --> 54:55.214
And they have the knowledge of the Library of Alexandria at their fingertips.

54:56.754 --> 54:57.095
No.

54:58.516 --> 55:08.722
And it can really be an effective illusion on Twitter where you think that you are at the cutting edge of these debates because you're following all these intrepid journalists that are posting in real time.

55:12.228 --> 55:13.889
Your feed is curated.

55:13.929 --> 55:17.010
The more interesting you are, the more curated your feed is.

55:19.051 --> 55:22.693
The more you are over the target, the less visible you are.

55:22.853 --> 55:24.814
In fact, you're not visible by anybody.

55:25.474 --> 55:29.856
They don't want to see you.

55:29.896 --> 55:33.958
That's why when you see these analysis pictures, you really see these different bubbles.

55:33.998 --> 55:35.559
Those bubbles aren't spontaneous.

55:37.193 --> 55:41.296
When somebody talks about those, Oh, there's this group of people over here in this group of people over here.

55:41.316 --> 55:54.727
And we're really starting to understand the social dynamics of, no, they are looking at how they have constructed people and gotten them into different aspects of the trap and looking at how people get stuck there.

55:55.988 --> 56:01.913
That's exactly what Alex Karp was talking about when he said, how do we, he was interested in how we know things.

56:04.670 --> 56:11.254
And so they show you this map and they try to make you believe that this is the spontaneous activity of millions of users.

56:11.674 --> 56:16.097
And they congregate into these different groups of people that argue about these different things.

56:16.877 --> 56:17.818
That's a lie.

56:18.158 --> 56:26.183
What they've shown you is how effective their program is at getting people to argue about a list that's only six questions long.

56:26.663 --> 56:28.124
That is what they've done.

56:29.540 --> 56:32.022
And that's also what they do on YouTube, like it or not.

56:32.082 --> 56:33.963
That's what they do on Facebook, like it or not.

56:34.423 --> 56:51.254
And the only way to get away with it would be to go back to a decentralized model where essentially everybody's got a website, everybody's got a webpage where they can chat, or everybody's got a place that they feel comfortable with the moderators where they can chat, and it's completely independent from everything else.

56:52.735 --> 56:53.756
You just share links.

56:54.056 --> 56:57.398
You know, this is a link that a person I like, a link a person I like, that's it.

56:57.458 --> 56:58.839
PeerTube allows me to do that.

57:01.104 --> 57:01.705
Oh, sorry.

57:06.169 --> 57:06.610
Come on, babe.

57:12.436 --> 57:13.077
Relax now.

57:13.998 --> 57:14.518
I'm streaming.

57:15.759 --> 57:17.321
Like you know what that means.

57:28.638 --> 57:32.879
So Robert Malone, the hero in February, 2024, trying to understand their illusion.

57:32.919 --> 57:35.740
Now, why do I think it's important to keep going back to Robert Malone?

57:35.780 --> 57:44.222
Well, my gut tells me that if he can't keep his story straight, then this is probably the place where the narrative will break.

57:44.302 --> 57:50.383
And it's part of the reason why I think a lot of people want us to argue about other people and pay attention to other people.

57:51.543 --> 58:12.042
And I think that just like Soph, the daughter of Sasha Latapova, creates almost certainty that Sasha is not just a patriot, but she's a meddler in American history.

58:14.744 --> 58:27.833
I think it's really important to see that Robert Malone's past and his history and his conduct throughout this timeline is indicative of somebody who has been playing for the other side from the very beginning.

58:28.393 --> 58:37.039
Just in the same way that looking at Lee Minyan's history before the pandemic and her history with her husband and who they worked for,

58:38.073 --> 58:44.679
Um, Mark Kulak has shown that there's a reason to believe that Li Min Yan has been working for them from the very beginning.

58:44.739 --> 58:51.865
And I don't think there's much difference between Robert Malone and Li Min Yan, except Robert Malone didn't fake a Chinese accent.

58:54.988 --> 58:57.010
So let's watch this video.

58:57.070 --> 58:58.111
It's not very long.

58:58.611 --> 59:02.314
Um, and then we'll be done for the day and I'll give my voice a rest.

59:02.515 --> 59:03.836
Hopefully it's going to recover quick.

59:06.977 --> 59:07.918
Hello, everyone.

59:07.978 --> 59:23.449
I'm Rebecca Weber back with you live at CPAC, and I'm thrilled to have with me, joining me now, Dr. Robert Malone, the founder of the Malone Institute, also the original inventor of the platform technology for mRNA.

59:24.090 --> 59:26.912
This doctor has spoken out early on the ethics

59:27.712 --> 59:33.573
He's got two great books, The Lies My Government Told Me and The Better Future Coming.

59:34.314 --> 59:36.594
I'd love for people to check him out on Substack.

59:36.614 --> 59:40.855
You get over a half a million views per day, which is absolutely incredible.

59:40.915 --> 59:47.236
And you can follow Dr. Robert Malone at rwmalonemd.

59:47.276 --> 59:49.177
That's M-A-L-O-N-E.

59:49.757 --> 59:51.257
Dr. Malone, thank you so much.

59:51.417 --> 59:52.918
It's a real joy to have you joining me.

59:53.558 --> 59:54.198
Thanks for having me.

59:54.966 --> 59:57.228
Well, sir, there's so much happening.

59:57.748 --> 59:59.810
The world is unraveling in so many ways.

59:59.890 --> 01:00:07.056
Here we are just three years since COVID first or we're coming up, I guess, on the fourth year here since COVID was introduced.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:07.417
Yeah.

01:00:07.877 --> 01:00:12.121
And I look at where we were just a few short years ago and where we are today.

01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:16.565
For those that are tuning in, so many of our members, over two million strong,

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:22.710
are concerned if they made the right choice to either forego getting the vaccine or getting the booster.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.152
Many are saying, should we have a booster?

01:00:25.172 --> 01:00:36.001
And I'd love for you to give your perspective, your opinion on things and how things are looking, because it does seem that COVID itself is no longer as much of a threat as it was.

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:40.885
Perhaps that's just because more and more people have developed some sort of immunity.

01:00:41.465 --> 01:00:45.769
But specifically as it relates to the vaccine itself, could you share some insight?

01:00:47.338 --> 01:00:49.099
So I'm a vaccinologist.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:01:01.563
I've spent my entire career, held multiple positions in industry, nonprofits, supporting the government in this area of biodefense and vaccine development and vaccine technology.

01:01:02.363 --> 01:01:08.085
And as a young man working at the Salk Institute in the molecular virology laboratories,

01:01:09.626 --> 01:01:15.591
I had a series of discoveries that led to the foundation technology for the mRNA product.

01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:17.033
So I understand this space.

01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:28.683
He had a series of discoveries that we've heard him describe as him just teaching an embryology course and he just happened to put some of this stuff in and found out that it worked and then he published it.

01:01:29.369 --> 01:01:30.829
So interesting discovery.

01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:31.730
It is a discovery.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.090
That's how discoveries are made.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.111
Um, it's just, yeah.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:43.612
I've been at the forefront of, uh, helping companies and the government respond to, I think, five different outbreaks.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:50.594
So I'm very familiar with biodefense outbreaks and infectious disease product development vaccines.

01:01:51.554 --> 01:01:58.196
The important thing in evaluating any vaccine is the risk benefit for you.

01:02:00.537 --> 01:02:12.280
not the risk-benefit for the entire population, not the risk-benefit for children, but the risk-benefit for you because you're the one that has to make the decision about whether or not to take the vaccine.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:27.164
Now, of course, you can already see that the risk-benefit ratio that he's talking about assumes the existence of COVID, assumes that there is a different risk for different people depending on their background or their race or maybe their age.

01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:29.632
whether they're obese or not.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:43.978
But the whole idea is that he's hinting at a whole battery of questions that are completely all questions which accept the presupposition of the narrative, which is that there's a novel virus and we all agree on that.

01:02:45.282 --> 01:02:47.283
There's a novel virus, we all agree on that.

01:02:47.323 --> 01:02:50.125
There was a novel sickness, so we all agree on that.

01:02:50.185 --> 01:02:55.388
That's another way of expressing that some people, like Sasha Latupova, will express it.

01:02:55.788 --> 01:02:59.130
There was a novel sickness, and I'm not convinced of that yet.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.372
I'm really not, but anyway, let's keep going.

01:03:04.733 --> 01:03:12.377
And so, as we're talking to a more elderly cohort, which I'm a member of, I'm not a spring chicken either,

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:24.431
It's important to think about what are the data about your risk of both the infectious disease and the product.

01:03:24.952 --> 01:03:29.213
All pharmaceutical products, all vaccines have risk.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.254
If you drink too much water, there's risk.

01:03:32.594 --> 01:03:36.675
There's a fundamental principle in vaccinology and pharmacology.

01:03:36.915 --> 01:03:41.737
Wow, that's funny because I think that, you know who else has used that exact argument?

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:42.437
Paul Offit.

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:52.315
Paul Offit has used that exact argument to say that anything is dangerous, all things have risk, anything can be toxic.

01:03:53.816 --> 01:03:57.056
And this is, of course, a very disingenuous position to take.

01:03:57.476 --> 01:04:00.957
Robert Malone is absolutely positively a liar.

01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:03.378
And again, given what

01:04:03.985 --> 01:04:23.903
he knew before the pandemic, and given how that information did not change, his foundational biological understanding of how transformation and transfection in healthy animals is not a good idea wasn't changed because he made a phone call to Jeremy Marks at the FDA.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:27.687
And Jeremy Marks winked at him and said, oh no, man, we got your back.

01:04:27.727 --> 01:04:28.528
This stuff is good.

01:04:29.471 --> 01:04:43.960
And it wasn't his foundational biological knowledge about transformation and transfections usefulness or lack of usefulness wasn't fundamentally changed because Peter Cullis told him, no, we solved that localization problem.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.141
That is a lie.

01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:53.806
And that is fundamentally the lie that he tells every time and is the consistent lie from 2021 all the way up until now.

01:04:57.119 --> 01:05:09.415
It's the idea that the only reason why the expert who knew that these things were dangerous many, many years ago, and that's why he kind of let the patents just go.

01:05:10.478 --> 01:05:28.574
And that's kind of why Merck, who took the patents, or whoever took the patents from him, wasn't able to make anything with these technologies, is because there's a fundamental weakness of transfection and transformation when it comes to a long-living, healthy animal.

01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:31.697
You can't use it to augment their immune system.

01:05:31.717 --> 01:05:32.518
You just cannot.

01:05:33.444 --> 01:05:35.225
It's a great investigational tool.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:46.250
It's a great experimental tool for trying to understand the fundamentals of protein function, or is trying to understand a particular physiological metabolic pathway.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:55.495
But the idea of augmenting a healthy immune system of an animal or a human using transformation and transfection has always been dumb.

01:05:55.935 --> 01:06:01.618
And this guy, given his unique position with the intellectual property, has always known

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:03.178
It's dumb.

01:06:03.639 --> 01:06:13.825
And so if Peter Cullis really did, as he says, say that, nah, we solved that problem, his first reaction should have been incredible skepticism.

01:06:15.926 --> 01:06:28.193
But instead, apparently he just went out and got the shots because he needed them to travel anyway, even though his good buddy, uh, Steven Hatfield says that when they went to Rome together, neither of them had a vax card.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:45.205
So something doesn't jive because he also told Brett Weinstein that that he had long COVID and that was another reason why he took the shot because people told him that the shot might be helpful with long COVID.

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:54.009
And so let's see if he keeps his arms straight here and tells that story again because we know his stories.

01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:56.070
We've, we've, we've,

01:06:57.461 --> 01:07:15.853
We've study hauled hours and hours of this man's stories, and his stories have not remained consistent from Paul Cottrell's podcast, to Tommy's podcast, to Tommy's podcast, to Tommy's podcast, to Shannon Joy's podcast, to Tommy's podcast, to a thing like this.

01:07:16.894 --> 01:07:23.796
And those inconsistencies are evidence that like Mark Twain said, if you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.

01:07:23.856 --> 01:07:28.778
And the converse is, is that if you're lying, you've got a lot of stuff to remember.

01:07:31.239 --> 01:07:33.079
Everything has some degree of risk.

01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:42.182
The question is how big is the risk of the product and the type of risk and how big is the risk of the thing that you're trying to protect against?

01:07:43.082 --> 01:07:44.043
Let me illustrate the point.

01:07:44.423 --> 01:07:45.283
If you have cancer,

01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:50.982
and you only have two years to live.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:08:01.086
You might be willing to take a product that would give you an extra year of life, but if you happen to live for eight years, it might cause some other kind of cancer.

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:03.047
That might be a good trade-off.

01:08:04.028 --> 01:08:16.193
Depends on your disease and... Is he suggesting that transfection in really old people for pneumonia or shingles might be a good idea, but if you're like, you know, 60, maybe not?

01:08:18.484 --> 01:08:26.606
Is he suggesting that there is a, you know, a thing where old people are so close to death that even transfection might be useful for them?

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:28.186
Stop lying.

01:08:29.346 --> 01:08:39.568
You should be informed of what those risks are so that you can make decisions together with your doctor about whether or not taking this product makes sense to you.

01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:43.749
So all the way through, beginning in the very early days.

01:08:44.009 --> 01:08:46.830
So this is a guy not telling you anything useful.

01:08:48.129 --> 01:08:56.262
which is very different than what I'm trying to do, which is to say that if you have a healthy grandmother, you don't want a transfector.

01:08:56.302 --> 01:08:59.106
If you have a healthy grandfather, you don't want a transfector.

01:08:59.527 --> 01:09:02.792
If you have a healthy kid, you don't want to vaccinate them.

01:09:04.642 --> 01:09:09.286
And I'm just gonna say it out loud because it doesn't seem like these people are able to say it so succinctly.

01:09:09.646 --> 01:09:21.995
We need to return strict liability to all pharmaceutical products and we need to stop the vaccine schedule in America until the criminal enterprise that it is, is exposed to the most people possible.

01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:30.542
What's the problem?

01:09:35.188 --> 01:09:36.189
What is the problem?

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:37.830
Is there something here in the tree?

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:40.592
Where are the little ones?

01:09:41.372 --> 01:09:41.953
Little punk?

01:09:43.514 --> 01:09:47.317
I think it's okay now if she's already talking smack.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:49.698
Sorry about that.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:57.984
For instance, I had a teleconference with Nancy Pelosi early on in which I pleaded with her to get the CDC

01:09:59.093 --> 01:10:01.774
to stratify the risk of SARS-CoV-2.

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:08.137
So this ultra conservative homesteader has the phone number of Nancy Pelosi?

01:10:08.177 --> 01:10:09.578
I never heard this story before.

01:10:09.618 --> 01:10:10.138
That's cool.

01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:11.279
Wow.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:15.201
Doctor, about whether or not taking this product makes sense to you.

01:10:16.301 --> 01:10:27.587
So all the way through, beginning in the very early days, for instance, I had a teleconference with Nancy Pelosi early on, in which I pleaded with her to get the CDC

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:43.112
to stratify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 by age, so that we would know what is the risk for a young child, what's the risk for a average middle-aged person, what's the risk for an elderly person?

01:10:44.132 --> 01:10:54.481
Because that's necessary to make decisions, not about the whole population, we're not CDC, but about your risk, whether or not you should take this product,

01:10:56.026 --> 01:11:00.009
And so the thing about it that I find funny is that he's being very imprecise.

01:11:01.069 --> 01:11:03.051
And what risk are we talking about?

01:11:03.331 --> 01:11:05.853
Are we talking about the risk of the novel pathogen?

01:11:05.893 --> 01:11:09.635
Or are we talking about the risk of transformation and transfection?

01:11:09.675 --> 01:11:19.061
Maybe even the combination of transformation and transfection, depending on how these combinations of products were administered.

01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:28.543
He's being incredibly imprecise on purpose to make it possible for everybody to hear what they need to hear.

01:11:30.243 --> 01:11:32.604
It's absolutely malevolent.

01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:35.104
What is the risk for a young child?

01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:38.565
What's the risk for a average middle-aged person?

01:11:38.605 --> 01:11:40.245
What's the risk for an elderly person?

01:11:41.285 --> 01:11:43.966
Because that's necessary to make decisions.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:47.127
He absolutely did just do a podcast with

01:11:48.832 --> 01:12:11.690
with uh and just before that actually eric weinstein did a podcast with shanahan that's not a joke like three days ago or four days ago and then now him it's crazy not about the whole population we're not cdc but about your risk whether or not you should take this product it almost feels like he's repeating something data seem to indicate

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:20.181
that the risk of the vaccine was much lower than the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in an elderly population.

01:12:20.261 --> 01:12:35.509
The elderly absolutely, particularly the very old and obese, people with diabetes, certain types of cancers, immunosuppressive conditions, these were the people at highest risk for death from SARS-CoV-2.

01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:55.534
And then as time went on and we accumulated more and more data about the vaccines and the safety of the vaccines, to my evaluation, I used to suggest that children should not take these vaccines because they're at very low risk for death and disease from COVID.

01:12:55.774 --> 01:12:57.134
See, so that's interesting.

01:12:57.654 --> 01:13:00.135
They shouldn't take these vaccines because the

01:13:00.979 --> 01:13:03.261
COVID is not that dangerous for little kids.

01:13:03.841 --> 01:13:09.665
That's a very different argument than saying transformation and transfection in healthy children is dumb.

01:13:12.907 --> 01:13:23.054
In fact, it's the perfect bar to line because if the virus is dangerous for kids, then I guess transfection and transformation in kids would be totally okay.

01:13:23.454 --> 01:13:26.736
That's the exact argument he's still making here in February of 2024.

01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:33.895
That's how malevolent the position that we are in is and how malevolent these people are.

01:13:36.116 --> 01:13:39.138
This is not a man who came in on a white horse to save us.

01:13:39.198 --> 01:13:44.700
This is a man who coordinated a bunch of meddlers to make sure that we couldn't save ourselves.

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:50.784
But the elderly, it still seemed to be the case early on.

01:13:53.683 --> 01:14:01.467
that the elderly were partially protected and at highest risk, and they should probably go ahead and continue to get the vaccines.

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:06.090
Now we have a lot more data about the risks of the vaccines.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:17.035
And to my eye, what those data show is that when you stratify the risk of the vaccine and stratify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 by age,

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.941
Unfortunately, the risks of the vaccine increase as you get elderly.

01:14:24.822 --> 01:14:30.803
As you get older, the risks of the vaccine increase, and the risks of COVID increases.

01:14:31.063 --> 01:14:35.565
And is it possible that the inventor of this didn't already suspect that?

01:14:36.965 --> 01:14:45.087
That transfecting a weaker, older animal would even, the possibility of damage would even be higher?

01:14:45.127 --> 01:14:47.988
The resilience of, the recovery possibility of?

01:14:49.574 --> 01:14:57.302
of a elderly person or an elderly animal would be necessarily worse than a young animal?

01:14:57.382 --> 01:15:02.146
Is that something that biologically he couldn't imagine until they had the data?

01:15:03.628 --> 01:15:11.756
Even though he invented this technology and started by playing around with it as he was a TA in an embryology class all those many years ago?

01:15:19.369 --> 01:15:25.270
When they started with this technology, it was already causing problems in the animal models.

01:15:26.091 --> 01:15:30.672
And he makes the claim that he was the first guy to think that it was the immune system.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:39.774
So why in the world would it be okay to augment the immune system using transfection and transformation at any age?

01:15:40.618 --> 01:15:46.721
And yet here he is arguing that it actually, the shot is more dangerous for old people than it is for young people.

01:15:47.121 --> 01:16:01.967
What an interesting conflict then, because if the shot is less dangerous for young people than it is for old people, but old people have more danger from the COVID than the young people do, then it's kind of like, well, what do we do then?

01:16:02.027 --> 01:16:05.009
That's a very, that's a very tough equation.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:09.711
It all depends on whether or not the New York Times tells us the right or not.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:19.039
It's really disturbing.

01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:20.760
So then it's kind of a race.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.040
It's a balance.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.181
You know, which one increases more?

01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:25.901
Does it really make sense?

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:29.002
What's your risk and what's your benefit?

01:16:29.822 --> 01:16:38.025
And unfortunately, the data that I've seen suggest that the risk of the vaccine is greater

01:16:38.988 --> 01:16:43.912
than the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 disease, even in the elderly.

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.435
This is so interesting.

01:16:46.675 --> 01:16:55.422
And what I find fascinating and almost mind boggling is that this seems like lots of common sense here.

01:16:55.442 --> 01:16:56.583
You have a tremendous background.

01:16:56.684 --> 01:17:04.611
It absolutely is to get elderly people to accept the idea that a vaccination schedule for them is something that's going to be normal.

01:17:05.543 --> 01:17:13.984
because these mRNA vaccines can protect them from shingles and from pneumonia and from RSV and from flu.

01:17:14.445 --> 01:17:19.786
And so they're gonna get transfected three or four times a year if they submit to this kind of narrative.

01:17:20.286 --> 01:17:23.906
And that narrative is now being perpetuated by this person as well.

01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:33.588
Because there's a risk benefit here for pneumonia and there's a risk benefit here for RSV and for shingles.

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:49.898
And that's why my friend at my gym is now retiring because he has such debilitating pain in his head and in his neck that he can't sleep anymore because of a shingle shot that his doctor told him that he needed that was based on MRNA.

01:17:57.342 --> 01:18:01.384
Once you see that this guy is part of a criminal group,

01:18:02.339 --> 01:18:11.002
of people that worked with the national security state to convince us of a novel virus and convince us of a novel disease that needed novel treatments.

01:18:12.423 --> 01:18:26.068
Once you see him for who he is, everybody who promotes him, everybody who has been promoted by him, everybody that traveled around the world with him, everybody that was on stage with him at a COVID summit was already pre-screened

01:18:32.079 --> 01:18:33.940
was already part of this show.

01:18:35.141 --> 01:18:42.645
It can be no other way, witting or unwitting, anybody that has been promoted on stage by him is part of this show.

01:18:43.946 --> 01:18:46.027
And at some point, if they didn't figure it out yet,

01:18:47.150 --> 01:19:13.910
That's an admission because listen to this man here in this interview from 2024 and compare what he's saying to what he said with his meek little self when he was on the, the Brett Weinstein podcast, and then compare it to what he said in 2017 and look how nervous he is on the Brett Weinstein podcast about taking the spotlight at that point in time in American history.

01:19:16.468 --> 01:19:18.190
He's not happy to be doing it.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.433
It's not because he's afraid he's going to get killed.

01:19:20.893 --> 01:19:26.099
It's not because he's afraid he's, he's, you know, losing all of his business connections.

01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:34.829
It's because he's afraid he's going to screw it up because the narrative was so off the rails that people had not taken enough of the transfections.

01:19:35.899 --> 01:19:56.472
that they needed somebody like Robert Malone to step out and take the spotlight, to get attention, to be a shiny object that everybody could pay attention to, to coordinate the establishment of the international COVID summits, the establishment of the FLCCC, the establishment of the American frontline doctors for which at some point in time, he was in front of each.

01:19:59.134 --> 01:20:00.355
This is not by mistake.

01:20:03.939 --> 01:20:13.850
This is because DITRA or BARDA or DARPA or DOD was charged with narrative control and he's one of the people.

01:20:17.023 --> 01:20:19.585
You understand your research, you understand medicine.

01:20:20.046 --> 01:20:24.949
After all, you are the original inventor of this platform technology of mRNA.

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:34.395
Why is it that ordinary folks that want to have this discussion are somehow shamed in American society and that, you know,

01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:42.241
Platforms such as YouTube and Google and such want to shut down this conversation entirely We're just looking for truth.

01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:44.863
We're looking to educate the American more than that.

01:20:44.943 --> 01:21:03.136
You're you're looking for informed consent It's your right to be fully informed about the risks of a medical product that you would accept if you go to the doctor And so he's gonna emphasize here and listen very carefully as I explain what he's doing here informed consent

01:21:05.183 --> 01:21:08.404
is the ability to say no, done.

01:21:10.185 --> 01:21:16.908
Instead, what he's gonna tell you is that informed consent is that they had to tell you more than they told you.

01:21:16.948 --> 01:21:20.249
And since they didn't tell it to you, they shouldn't have made you take it.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.050
They shouldn't have lied about it.

01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:28.913
They shouldn't have had, they should have been straightforward with you before you made that decision.

01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:34.315
Instead of actually telling people what informed consent is.

01:21:35.492 --> 01:21:42.538
Just like Aaron Siri can get in front of Congress and not use the words strict and liability together as one idea.

01:21:43.518 --> 01:21:55.808
Or get on Twitter and do a space where he doesn't say, very simply, the vaccine schedule in America by my estimation is criminal and we should restore all strict liability to all pharmaceutical products and the whole problem will go away.

01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:02.934
Just like Robert Malone is not gonna say that informed consent is the ability to say no, stop.

01:22:05.578 --> 01:22:08.919
he's going to say informed consent is, you know, they didn't tell you stuff.

01:22:08.939 --> 01:22:11.039
They should have told you stuff because then you're informed.

01:22:11.079 --> 01:22:18.861
So he's talking about the informed part instead of the, you know, ability to choose not to do it, the voluntary aspect of it.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:24.402
These actually misleading you, even though he's supposed to be a bioethics expert.

01:22:29.603 --> 01:22:33.244
And, you know, in an elderly cohort, they're well aware of colonoscopy.

01:22:34.013 --> 01:22:39.581
And they remember that when they go for their routine colonoscopy as an elderly person, which you should have.

01:22:40.558 --> 01:22:56.667
Your physician or surgeon or gastroenterologist will read you a set of, a statement about what the potential risks are of colonoscopy, and you have to agree to those risks before they will do the procedure.

01:22:57.207 --> 01:22:58.788
That's called informed consent.

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:03.751
They're obligated to be fully open and transparent about what your risks are.

01:23:04.653 --> 01:23:07.935
But in the case of these products, that has not happened.

01:23:08.475 --> 01:23:15.118
In fact, the government has actively blocked disclosure of important information about risk.

01:23:15.238 --> 01:23:16.519
It's not the government that did it.

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:17.899
It's social media that did it.

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:21.901
See, so they want you to get mad at the government for having told social media to do it.

01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:23.902
But social media didn't have principles.

01:23:24.823 --> 01:23:33.267
And if you realize that the social media platforms are themselves the fifth generation warfare that Robert Malone says we're never going to figure out,

01:23:34.522 --> 01:23:55.127
then blaming the government for social media censorship is... Arguing about the government, stopping free speech, telling social media to censor people is... That is part of the illusion.

01:23:55.167 --> 01:23:59.008
That's part of the program that you're on, on the matrix.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:12.080
that if they would just let us have social media without the controls and without the censorship, social media would be the mainstream square or the town hall that everybody needs.

01:24:14.252 --> 01:24:28.042
That's what Bobby Kennedy is currently arguing, and Robert Malone is arguing, and Kevin McKernan argued from the very beginning of the pandemic that this discussion is happening on Twitter, and that now that Elon Musk has taken over, we all agree that Twitter is much better.

01:24:29.182 --> 01:24:35.086
And so we're again being told that it's the government meddling in social media that has resulted in

01:24:36.067 --> 01:24:49.177
in our problems, and so we're supposed to vote somebody else in office instead of acknowledging that social media has been militarized against us because of national security priorities that this guy is covering up, that this guy is a part of.

01:24:50.911 --> 01:25:07.940
national security priorities that include the American populace and the Western world accepting transformation and transfection as a flawed, but soon to be perfect sort of pharmaceutical platform for the treatment of elderly people.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.362
And eventually the vaccine schedule for kids will also be only transformation.

01:25:13.382 --> 01:25:16.324
Of course it will be, but there are no rush.

01:25:18.479 --> 01:25:28.565
Right now, they are getting away with this criminal vaccine schedule in America by keeping the focus on transfection and transformation that nobody's even using anymore.

01:25:32.787 --> 01:25:35.589
Like myocarditis, this is well documented.

01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:42.673
We have detailed timelines of how Rochelle Walensky and others have chosen

01:25:43.493 --> 01:25:53.480
to not disclose about risks to the general population under the belief system that these vaccines are safe and effective.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.262
Remember, how many times have you heard safe and effective?

01:25:56.382 --> 01:25:57.663
Safe and effective, okay?

01:25:58.284 --> 01:26:00.525
That's called neurolinguistic programming.

01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:02.687
That's a form of mind control.

01:26:03.427 --> 01:26:07.450
When you're given these... That's neurolinguistic programming?

01:26:08.471 --> 01:26:11.213
Repeating very simple phrases over and over again?

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.123
I'm like, where do you want me to start with that lie?

01:26:17.825 --> 01:26:23.631
I mean, he's so knowledgeable that he's actually teaching the average person what neuro-linguistic programming is.

01:26:24.292 --> 01:26:25.033
Stop lying!

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:26.334
Wow.

01:26:26.755 --> 01:26:29.077
Simple statements again and again and again.

01:26:29.858 --> 01:26:31.540
That's, they get into your brain.

01:26:32.975 --> 01:26:38.419
and they prevent you from actually asking critical questions, which you should be doing because it's your body.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:56.273
So we still don't have any of those critical questions because of course he's the expert who says that those critical questions include the risk benefit between the disease and the transfection and transformation, which he still hasn't said is inappropriate for healthy humans, but it is.

01:26:56.613 --> 01:26:58.695
It's completely criminal in healthy humans.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:26:59.416
Yes.

01:26:59.436 --> 01:27:00.116
It's your health.

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:01.818
It's your right to know.

01:27:02.578 --> 01:27:15.324
Hey, but the government has actively your right to say no, not your right to know what they are coercing you to take, but it is your right to say no.

01:27:15.384 --> 01:27:20.966
And if you want someone to be able to exercise informed consent, that's the way you have to say it.

01:27:22.887 --> 01:27:30.110
If you get read your Miranda rights and they don't say you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:27:33.496 --> 01:27:34.877
then how would you know your rights?

01:27:37.378 --> 01:27:46.464
And if you're saying informed consent is all of this stuff that they didn't tell you, then you're not really saying that you have a right to remain silent.

01:27:46.504 --> 01:27:47.885
You have a right to an attorney.

01:27:50.467 --> 01:27:59.839
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law is a very succinct statement about what you can and can't do, what will happen if you say stuff, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.686
Informed consent should be very simply that if you don't feel

01:28:07.512 --> 01:28:09.214
informed enough, you can say no.

01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:09.815
Done.

01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:10.396
That's it.

01:28:10.856 --> 01:28:13.239
We don't need a list of what they should have told you.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.304
And if they told you all those things, then informed consent would have happened.

01:28:17.845 --> 01:28:25.715
You need to be told that you can say no, and it has to be a no that isn't compromising to your wellbeing.

01:28:28.243 --> 01:28:37.028
If saying no means that you can't raise money for your family anymore, if saying no means that you lose your tenure position, then again, you're not able to exercise informed consent.

01:28:37.448 --> 01:28:49.155
If they told you everything, but you still can't say no because of the economic or social social pressures that are on TV and social media, then it's still not informed consent.

01:28:49.275 --> 01:28:52.737
And he is not telling people this.

01:28:54.005 --> 01:29:07.370
He's not telling the college kids that the messages that were on posters at universities are part of this coercion and part of this violation of your ability to exercise informed consent.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:12.272
The posters with students with, with masks and encouraging testing.

01:29:13.672 --> 01:29:20.175
These were all part of the coercive measures that were used to fool our young people at a time when he wasn't speaking out.

01:29:21.505 --> 01:29:25.727
and are still being used to fool people because he's still not usefully speaking out.

01:29:27.867 --> 01:29:39.772
He's still asking the same terrible questions that play right in to the pandemic narrative and the botched and imperfect response to it.

01:29:40.192 --> 01:29:41.312
I mean, it didn't hurt everybody.

01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:43.553
Some old people were protected.

01:29:43.593 --> 01:29:45.914
I mean, it does protect, but it also hurts.

01:29:47.193 --> 01:29:48.774
Because that's the way all medicine is.

01:29:48.834 --> 01:29:50.714
All medicine protects and hurts.

01:29:51.014 --> 01:29:52.355
That's, you know, even water.

01:29:54.235 --> 01:29:55.676
Stop lying.

01:29:56.816 --> 01:29:58.577
Restricted your ability to know.

01:29:59.337 --> 01:30:00.798
They have controlled the information.

01:30:00.838 --> 01:30:03.299
Matter of fact, there's an agreement between the U.S.

01:30:03.339 --> 01:30:08.500
government and the British government that both will suppress information about vaccine risks.

01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:14.983
OK, so what has happened is that a

01:30:16.425 --> 01:30:36.831
a group of technologies and capabilities having to do with censorship and what's called cognitive warfare, or you can think of it as a form of media hypnosis that was developed to prevent Russian disinformation affecting elections.

01:30:37.935 --> 01:30:41.117
has been turned on the civilian population.

01:30:41.737 --> 01:30:58.565
So the government has a very, very well-developed toolkit and interface with all the social media companies, and they have used that to suppress any discussion about vaccine risks or harms.

01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:04.793
And that's why you're not allowed to, is because the government doesn't want you to discuss those things.

01:31:05.413 --> 01:31:14.719
Just like they will censor anybody who's had a vaccine injury from talking about it, and they will censor groups that have been set up on Facebook.

01:31:14.759 --> 01:31:17.161
Those groups will be deleted and deplatformed.

01:31:18.622 --> 01:31:19.842
That's by intention.

01:31:20.883 --> 01:31:26.887
And it's basically wrapped up in the idea the government thinks they know what's best for you.

01:31:28.188 --> 01:31:30.430
And we see this in so many areas of our lives.

01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:33.374
Says a guy who's been working for the government his whole life.

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.375
I mean, it's laughable.

01:31:34.475 --> 01:31:37.638
And I think that, you know, it's not the way we want to think.

01:31:37.698 --> 01:31:40.341
It's not the way we want to view our government.

01:31:40.381 --> 01:31:41.883
We want to have some level of trust.

01:31:41.903 --> 01:31:43.244
And I think that's why a lot of people

01:31:44.185 --> 01:31:48.488
do have this cognitive dissonance around these issues.

01:31:48.528 --> 01:31:57.975
They'll try to find ways to justify why they're thinking the way they're thinking, because to face the truth is so difficult and so hard, and it's almost impossible to wrap your mind around it.

01:31:58.456 --> 01:32:01.098
Quick question before I move on to your books.

01:32:01.158 --> 01:32:06.542
I want to talk a little bit about your books, but there are young families that... See, she can't see that he did it.

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:18.408
She can't see that from 2021 onward from his, his, his public facing appearances, his book release, he didn't save anyone.

01:32:19.328 --> 01:32:24.712
He actually made the clock, uh, you know, ran the clock out to where we are now.

01:32:25.533 --> 01:32:27.614
And he's still not saying anything useful.

01:32:27.674 --> 01:32:35.220
And she's not sophisticated enough to hear that because probably in 2022, she was still just watching regular TV.

01:32:36.604 --> 01:32:40.246
She hadn't found Brett Weinstein or Robert Malone yet.

01:32:42.187 --> 01:32:44.048
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:44.088 --> 01:32:45.188
That's the scary part.

01:32:45.388 --> 01:32:50.791
...out there who are being pressured to vaccinate their children before they can send them off to school.

01:32:51.431 --> 01:32:53.952
The schools are saying... Before they're pressured, in many cases, they're required.

01:32:54.293 --> 01:32:54.513
Correct.

01:32:54.533 --> 01:33:01.396
And most of the top drawer universities still require the full series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:07.481
So what should people do when their own conscience says this doesn't feel right?

01:33:07.621 --> 01:33:08.601
I don't want to do this.

01:33:08.661 --> 01:33:10.143
This is a tough time in America.

01:33:10.163 --> 01:33:11.003
It sure is.

01:33:11.804 --> 01:33:16.768
You know, personally, as an employer, I told my people we are not mandating a vaccine.

01:33:17.588 --> 01:33:20.851
You know, that was I was able to do that by the grace of God.

01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:23.513
I was in a position where I could do that for my people.

01:33:23.633 --> 01:33:24.554
I'm going back.

01:33:24.914 --> 01:33:26.075
Own conscience said.

01:33:26.155 --> 01:33:32.245
The top drawer universities still require the full series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

01:33:32.626 --> 01:33:34.769
And so why isn't he saying that that's criminal?

01:33:35.771 --> 01:33:37.572
Why isn't he saying that that's dumb?

01:33:38.093 --> 01:33:43.597
Why isn't he saying that I feel bad because I didn't save those people from a life of myocarditis?

01:33:43.677 --> 01:33:49.421
Why isn't he apologizing for not coming out in 2021 when he should have?

01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:54.724
When Peter Cullis told him the bullshit story about how they'd solved the localization problem.

01:33:55.105 --> 01:34:00.909
When Jeremy Marks lied to him and said that they have pretty good data that looks really good and you should trust the shot.

01:34:01.429 --> 01:34:05.312
Why is he not apologizing for being so dumb?

01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:17.259
Instead, he's still talking like for some college kids, there is a risk benefit ratio that needs to be calculated.

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:26.006
And that it may or may not be justified for these administrations in these different universities to still mandate these products.

01:34:27.307 --> 01:34:36.335
He can't say it in 2024, because he is part of this criminal enterprise, this national security operation,

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:51.719
The same as Pierre Corey, the same as Jessica Rose, the same as Ahmed Malik, the same as all these people who have been meddling with us for three years, probably closer to four and a half years by now with a lot of these players.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.443
It's just that they started to run out of thread.

01:34:56.744 --> 01:34:58.887
And that's why they've all woven together now.

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:07.617
with Andy Kaufman on Steve Kirsch's podcast and Robert Malone talking about Sasha Latapova on Steve Kirsch's podcast.

01:35:08.177 --> 01:35:17.282
And all of this stuff is happening because the narrative is unraveling because these liars, if you see them for what they are, they are exposed forever.

01:35:17.842 --> 01:35:21.684
Anybody that sees this video will see that he's a liar.

01:35:22.464 --> 01:35:36.159
Anybody that comes to PeerTube of Gigaohm Biological and spends any time there at all will find out that this person and many of those people I just mentioned are liars with a consistent track record of lying for four and a half years.

01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:43.730
What should people do when their own conscience says this doesn't feel right?

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:44.871
I don't want to do this.

01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:46.412
This is a tough time in America.

01:35:46.432 --> 01:35:47.253
It sure is.

01:35:48.073 --> 01:35:53.037
You know, personally, as an employer, I told my people we are not mandating a vaccine.

01:35:53.858 --> 01:35:57.120
You know, that was I was able to do that by the grace of God.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.782
I was in a position where I could do that for my people.

01:36:00.443 --> 01:36:04.125
But there are young people who are being their back is up against the wall.

01:36:04.205 --> 01:36:07.588
What kind of message or message of hope might you give to people?

01:36:08.368 --> 01:36:11.570
that might encourage them in some way.

01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:13.491
Go to a different university.

01:36:13.511 --> 01:36:15.592
Well, hope is a different thing.

01:36:16.693 --> 01:36:23.576
In terms of your conscience, your rights are to control your body.

01:36:24.537 --> 01:36:30.500
You have the right to control any medical procedure or drug that's administered to your body.

01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:32.441
Control?

01:36:33.749 --> 01:36:35.670
How come he doesn't say you have the right to say no?

01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:37.190
Don't give up that right.

01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:40.892
It's a thing.

01:36:41.172 --> 01:36:43.553
It's a difficult right and wrong decision.

01:36:44.593 --> 01:36:45.894
I made a wrong decision.

01:36:46.434 --> 01:36:50.916
I accepted the first two doses of Moderna and I was damaged.

01:36:51.036 --> 01:36:53.697
I still have heart damage from having done that.

01:36:54.537 --> 01:36:57.118
Now I rationalized it because I needed to travel.

01:36:57.975 --> 01:37:00.998
and you couldn't travel internationally unless you had the jab.

01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:09.587
I also had long COVID because I was in the first wave of infection with the original strain, the Wuhan 1 strain in Boston.

01:37:09.647 --> 01:37:12.910
I was in Boston and I got very, very sick, thought I was going to die.

01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:15.773
And I developed long COVID.

01:37:16.704 --> 01:37:18.825
longstanding, and I had risk factors.

01:37:19.465 --> 01:37:20.686
I was more obese then.

01:37:20.706 --> 01:37:23.047
I had prediabetes.

01:37:24.168 --> 01:37:26.709
And I had this long-term syndrome.

01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:35.273
And it was talked about in government circles and on social media that if you took the jab, it might help you with your long COVID.

01:37:36.513 --> 01:37:39.975
I also had talked to a variety of my colleagues.

01:37:39.995 --> 01:37:41.696
Remember, I'm a specialist in this.

01:37:42.796 --> 01:37:44.957
But I had gotten out of the field in the 90s, late 90s.

01:37:47.517 --> 01:37:52.298
But I talked to colleagues and they said the problems that I had found in the 90s had been overcome.

01:37:53.438 --> 01:37:59.280
I talked to the individual, Peter Marks, at the FDA.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.500
What are those problems?

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.301
Was the problem localization?

01:38:04.601 --> 01:38:11.482
Or was the problem just the, you know, aberrant activation of the immune system by transfection and transformation?

01:38:11.502 --> 01:38:13.383
What's the problem that he found years ago?

01:38:14.691 --> 01:38:19.254
that was specifically responsible for Operation Warp Speed and for licensing these vaccines.

01:38:19.795 --> 01:38:21.776
And he told me there was nothing to worry about.

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:28.561
But I accepted the product, as have many, and I was harmed from it.

01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:31.402
I have not taken anything more than booster number two.

01:38:32.583 --> 01:38:43.291
But even somebody that knows as much as I know was convinced by the lies that were put out about this product.

01:38:44.224 --> 01:38:47.128
And I made a mistake, so we can all make mistakes.

01:38:47.769 --> 01:39:01.006
But if you're a young person, particularly, facing these decisions, be aware that you are in the highest risk group, particularly young males, for having heart damage from these products.

01:39:01.954 --> 01:39:04.375
There's just a paper that just came out in the jury.

01:39:04.395 --> 01:39:04.695
Yes.

01:39:04.715 --> 01:39:06.195
He said booster number two.

01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:24.939
That's what he said I don't really understand if that's what he means because he originally said that he took the first two shots But now he just said he just said booster number two journal called vaccine It was CDC funded They didn't to the tune of ten million dollars

01:39:26.044 --> 01:39:31.311
an international consortium that took government data and hospital data from across the world.

01:39:32.873 --> 01:39:38.360
99 million people analyzed that data and has proven

01:39:39.684 --> 01:40:01.185
that all these data under-report the risks, and yet still it was clear that the vaccines have a major risk for myocarditis, pericarditis, central venous thrombosis, that's blood clots in your brain, Guillain-Barre syndrome, this is neurologic syndrome, central nervous inflammation, a variety of other diseases, okay?

01:40:01.385 --> 01:40:02.726
So this is proven now.

01:40:04.062 --> 01:40:25.123
uh... in if you're a young person you're at the highest risk but if you're a young male that includes young adults up to thirty five you're at highest risk for myocarditis now they told you a lie they said the myocarditis is transitory and mild it's not they did none of the aberrant

01:40:26.121 --> 01:40:28.222
augmentations of your immune system.

01:40:28.343 --> 01:40:36.308
None of the aberrant activation of your immune system by transfection or transformation is going to be something that's temporary.

01:40:37.609 --> 01:40:42.492
You can say that myocarditis isn't temporary, but that's not being honest.

01:40:42.712 --> 01:40:52.418
None of the effects that would be downstream from transformation and transfection done intramuscularly are not reversible.

01:40:52.478 --> 01:40:53.079
That's not

01:40:54.085 --> 01:41:09.097
Number one, because we don't know, we've never done this in humans to any great degree, but what we know from animals is certainly not reversible, just like any other exposure to toxin or any other exposure to something like this would be irreversible.

01:41:09.777 --> 01:41:16.142
Expressing a foreign protein and letting your body decide what to do about it is an irreversible process.

01:41:16.222 --> 01:41:21.146
It's just like saying, I'm gonna pause puberty for a couple years with a toxin.

01:41:22.007 --> 01:41:22.968
That doesn't work.

01:41:24.448 --> 01:41:30.851
You can't just decide, Oh, I guess I am a boy after all, and go off the pills and then have your body just catch up to normal.

01:41:31.291 --> 01:41:32.652
That's not how this works.

01:41:32.672 --> 01:41:40.396
So causing, calling them puberty blockers is just as stupid as calling transfection and transformation a vaccine.

01:41:43.257 --> 01:41:49.780
Because vaccines are a combination of substances that are injected intramuscularly with the intent of augmenting the immune system.

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.881
And they were already dumb.

01:41:52.435 --> 01:42:08.762
But now we're talking about transforming and transfecting people's cells and potentially all over their body in random places, which is compoundingly dumb when compared to the injection of recombinant proteins and some adjuvant.

01:42:10.722 --> 01:42:12.063
Am I making myself clear?

01:42:13.735 --> 01:42:24.104
Just because they say that the lipids and RNA are in your cells, so transformation and transfection is no more dangerous than they're just all things that are already inside of you.

01:42:24.844 --> 01:42:26.766
This lie is just as ridiculous.

01:42:28.448 --> 01:42:29.028
It's worse.

01:42:29.128 --> 01:42:35.173
They have to be worse than injecting a recombinant protein plus adjuvant into your muscle.

01:42:35.233 --> 01:42:38.196
They by definition have to be worse.

01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:41.980
And so they had to use placebo batches.

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.063
Otherwise, everybody that was transfected would have been injured and would have known.

01:42:47.723 --> 01:42:51.386
That's my argument that I haven't really made until right now.

01:42:51.446 --> 01:42:57.049
But that's what I think is the reason why placebo batches are so important to understand.

01:42:57.709 --> 01:43:05.793
Nobody can be transfected without, you know, the gun, all the barrels in the gun are loaded.

01:43:05.853 --> 01:43:08.275
And if you put that gun up to your head, you're gonna get hit.

01:43:09.332 --> 01:43:18.460
And if you transfect or transform yourself with a hot thing, then your immune system is going to do something and you're not going to be able to reverse it.

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:26.607
If it's small thing that it does, then maybe you get lucky, but there is zero possibility that something doesn't happen.

01:43:27.728 --> 01:43:28.088
Zero.

01:43:29.605 --> 01:43:42.416
Unlike if you inject toxins and a recombinant protein, it is possible that your body will ignore and get rid of the toxin and the proteins and not really make any autoimmunity at all.

01:43:42.476 --> 01:43:43.177
It's possible.

01:43:45.198 --> 01:43:56.228
But I am making the argument, and I think that Robert Malone has known this for 20 years, it is impossible for you to transfect a human, a healthy animal,

01:43:56.929 --> 01:44:02.750
with a foreign protein at any level can know that that animal is going to be okay.

01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:13.533
In fact, you can be certain that the augmentation of the immune system will be permanent and that it's likely to hurt the animal.

01:44:14.753 --> 01:44:16.273
They didn't know the data then.

01:44:16.353 --> 01:44:18.274
They had no right to say that.

01:44:18.454 --> 01:44:19.614
That was another lie.

01:44:21.126 --> 01:44:26.010
They didn't have enough time, just like they didn't have enough time to know whether or not these products were safe in pregnancy.

01:44:26.651 --> 01:44:28.932
They told all of us they were safe in pregnancy.

01:44:29.273 --> 01:44:33.096
They told us the myocarditis was short-term and mild and transient.

01:44:33.156 --> 01:44:35.978
But why would they tell us it's safe in pregnancy?

01:44:36.018 --> 01:44:42.643
Because as Mark Kulak and others have argued, that's part of the inversion that they want to have happen here.

01:44:42.683 --> 01:44:43.784
Before the pandemic,

01:44:45.399 --> 01:44:50.763
You weren't supposed to put most cosmetics on your face if you were a pregnant woman.

01:44:50.803 --> 01:44:52.465
You weren't supposed to eat raw fish.

01:44:52.505 --> 01:44:54.587
You weren't supposed to eat unpasteurized cheese.

01:44:55.087 --> 01:44:56.449
The list is nearly endless.

01:45:02.334 --> 01:45:05.437
And yet now we're talking about transfecting pregnant women.

01:45:06.485 --> 01:45:08.206
transfecting pregnant women.

01:45:09.186 --> 01:45:20.432
And of course, pregnancy at the time when a young human is developing in the womb is the time when the most catastrophic things can go wrong.

01:45:22.033 --> 01:45:30.558
The most catastrophic derailments of developmental processes can happen the earlier in development that they are derailed.

01:45:34.079 --> 01:45:42.045
And so the most devastating childhood diseases are those that derail a physiological process very early in development.

01:45:43.787 --> 01:45:50.312
And if you derail the development of an embryo early enough, then you will essentially cause an abortion.

01:45:52.938 --> 01:46:08.787
And the idea of him being an embryo, that's actually the most hilarious part, is that he admitted the other day that he tested this mRNA idea that he had on embryos that he had in an embryology course that he was teaching.

01:46:10.087 --> 01:46:22.354
And so he transfected developing animals and saw that there was protein production, but never once thought about what would happen if I let that frog become a frog.

01:46:23.956 --> 01:46:27.617
What would happen if I let that chick embryo become a full chick?

01:46:29.777 --> 01:46:36.319
He just showed that protein expression occurred and then called that a discovery.

01:46:38.099 --> 01:46:47.902
Even though we know that the transfected Xenopus oocytes would have never grown up to be frogs, we know that those chicks would not have grown up to be chicks.

01:46:48.971 --> 01:46:51.713
because the transfection would have derailed their development.

01:46:51.753 --> 01:46:53.514
Yes, you can see the protein expressed.

01:46:53.914 --> 01:46:57.076
That doesn't mean that it didn't have any effect on development.

01:46:59.677 --> 01:47:13.546
And so the idea that now we're saying, well, we don't know yet if transfection is safe in pregnant women is so malevolent and dark because of course we know it's inappropriate.

01:47:14.687 --> 01:47:21.449
We shouldn't expose a pregnant woman to any form of toxicity.

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:28.450
We should not expose the developing human to any form of toxicity.

01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:34.032
We should be providing the most abundant of nutrients and whatever.

01:47:34.752 --> 01:47:38.853
Optimizing everything does not involve vaccination.

01:47:40.502 --> 01:47:42.323
And that was before the pandemic.

01:47:43.324 --> 01:47:48.427
Giving people the flu shot while they were pregnant was always criminal.

01:47:48.867 --> 01:47:51.008
And they were doing that before the pandemic.

01:47:51.128 --> 01:47:51.889
It's criminal.

01:47:53.490 --> 01:48:01.234
It is criminal to give a pregnant woman a vaccine intramuscularly or any other way, but intramuscularly is how they do it.

01:48:01.635 --> 01:48:02.235
It's criminal.

01:48:03.216 --> 01:48:05.297
And none of these people are saying it.

01:48:06.237 --> 01:48:07.118
And we need to say it.

01:48:08.837 --> 01:48:12.259
Just like we need to say the childhood vaccine schedule is criminal in America.

01:48:12.299 --> 01:48:13.480
It's just criminal, that's it.

01:48:16.162 --> 01:48:17.883
We need to say that this is an illusion.

01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:30.772
This whole idea that there's a question to be asked of whether or not pregnant women are safe, safely transformed or transfected is in and of itself the malevolent lie that this guy is on the stage to tell.

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.001
But now the data are in, it's not.

01:48:34.622 --> 01:48:35.583
That was a lie.

01:48:36.123 --> 01:48:38.004
And we see these cancers, it seems.

01:48:38.405 --> 01:48:57.839
I personally have witnessed a number of people within my small group of folks that I know that have come down with all kinds of strange cancers, even lost an associate at a very young age from a very, six weeks, fine one day, 34-year-old woman, gone in six weeks.

01:48:58.519 --> 01:49:00.021
rapid lymphoma of some sort.

01:49:00.041 --> 01:49:06.810
So the term that my colleague Ryan Cole came up with, who's a highly qualified pathologist, is turbo cancers.

01:49:07.251 --> 01:49:07.912
Yeah.

01:49:08.112 --> 01:49:12.918
And this is right out on the edge of current knowledge.

01:49:14.227 --> 01:49:16.830
And what's... So I got a little message here.

01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:23.677
So number one, remember that Malone was a leader in promoting a Zika virus vaccine that was a transfection.

01:49:24.718 --> 01:49:32.266
And remember that Tony Fauci is on film saying that we needed to vaccinate pregnant women for Zika.

01:49:33.999 --> 01:49:42.926
And now we've looked at many years ago, we looked at a video of Mark Warby, Mike Warby, what's his name?

01:49:42.966 --> 01:49:43.846
Mike Warby, I think.

01:49:44.427 --> 01:49:58.457
He's this guy who did these flu studies and an analysis of the flu data from China, which showed that the flu variant that you are exposed to as a child, you are completely immune to dying from as an adult.

01:49:59.077 --> 01:50:07.744
And then in that discussion, very related to this, he was talking about how well they asked him from the audience, you know, what does this mean?

01:50:07.784 --> 01:50:21.175
Doesn't this mean that vaccination is kind of silly because your body is making these memories so early in life that, doesn't that mean we have to push vaccination really far back?

01:50:21.255 --> 01:50:28.060
And he says, well, yeah, I guess we would, if we were really going to augment this kind of memory, we would have to augment it at or before birth.

01:50:29.434 --> 01:50:53.384
And so there is a general agreement that transfection and transformation that, you know, under the rubric of vaccination is appropriate in pregnant women, which means it's appropriate for developing babies, developing humans in the womb, which before this pandemic was the most sacred of sacred things.

01:50:54.485 --> 01:50:56.726
The thing that needed the most protecting.

01:50:57.532 --> 01:51:06.958
Can you think of any more despicable thing you could do to a fellow human than punching a pregnant woman in her stomach?

01:51:08.119 --> 01:51:11.702
Can you imagine anything that would be more atrocious than that?

01:51:13.983 --> 01:51:26.532
And yet now we're just casually for the last five or 10 years, we've been talking about transfecting pregnant women to augment their and their developing fetuses immune system.

01:51:27.884 --> 01:51:28.664
Stop lying!

01:51:30.505 --> 01:51:31.965
Stop lying!

01:51:34.126 --> 01:51:35.066
It's extraordinary.

01:51:36.427 --> 01:51:54.052
These observations that you and pathologists and surgical oncologists are making seems to be fairly widespread, but there isn't really solid, randomized, peer-reviewed research yet

01:51:55.188 --> 01:51:55.928
documenting this.

01:51:56.048 --> 01:51:59.370
There's a lot of disincentives to even say what you just said.

01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:02.052
That's not allowed to be said.

01:52:02.072 --> 01:52:02.872
I understand.

01:52:02.972 --> 01:52:05.814
And positions that say those words get attacked.

01:52:07.241 --> 01:52:19.828
But in some cases, it's the actual pharmaceutical sponsors that are behind those attacks, surreptitiously by hiring agents on social media, et cetera, to make these attacks on people.

01:52:20.548 --> 01:52:34.035
So we can't yet say for sure that there is a correlation, but we do know that there are data demonstrating that these products

01:52:35.066 --> 01:52:41.017
have characteristics and components that could plausibly cause those kinds of cancers.

01:52:41.994 --> 01:52:44.715
We have these observations of these kinds of cancers.

01:52:45.396 --> 01:52:49.418
So we're kind of in a position where it walks like a duck and it quacks.

01:52:49.618 --> 01:52:50.618
What components?

01:52:50.819 --> 01:52:54.540
So you hear how the mystery is still being laid out.

01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:55.901
We do know that.

01:52:56.201 --> 01:52:57.642
We're still incrementally.

01:52:57.722 --> 01:52:59.043
He's titrating the truth.

01:52:59.083 --> 01:53:02.064
There are aspects of these products.

01:53:02.244 --> 01:53:04.686
These are components of these products.

01:53:04.786 --> 01:53:04.986
What?

01:53:05.566 --> 01:53:09.730
It's not the fundamental biological principles that they're violating.

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:15.995
It's not the fundamentally dumb idea of augmenting the immune system by transformation and transfection.

01:53:16.035 --> 01:53:18.357
It's parts and parts of the products.

01:53:18.377 --> 01:53:18.978
Do you hear it?

01:53:20.506 --> 01:53:21.887
This is malevolent.

01:53:39.491 --> 01:53:45.015
But in some cases, it's the actual pharmaceutical sponsors that are behind those attacks.

01:53:45.175 --> 01:53:47.976
Pharmaceutical sponsors are behind the attacks.

01:53:48.036 --> 01:53:49.337
They're attacking him too.

01:53:49.437 --> 01:53:50.077
Wow.

01:53:50.638 --> 01:53:54.860
Wouldn't that be interesting to say that he's not part of it at all?

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.201
He's a victim of it.

01:53:56.241 --> 01:53:58.222
Just like Brett Weinstein is a victim of it.

01:53:58.262 --> 01:54:04.186
Just like all these people are victims of the censorship, the government censorship, such victims.

01:54:05.273 --> 01:54:11.734
surreptitiously by hiring agents on social media, et cetera, to make these attacks on people.

01:54:11.834 --> 01:54:14.975
Hiring agents on social media, they would never do that.

01:54:15.035 --> 01:54:17.856
Would they, would pharmaceutical companies do that?

01:54:18.076 --> 01:54:24.037
Or would the national security state like BARDA do that to make sure that they could get closer to 100% compliance?

01:54:25.057 --> 01:54:33.199
Would the national security state do that to make sure that we took Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci seriously as experts?

01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:37.584
as putting people in danger with their meddling.

01:54:39.686 --> 01:54:40.486
Which would they do?

01:54:40.947 --> 01:54:44.029
Would they hire people to attack doctors telling the truth?

01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:51.856
Or would they get a little more complicated than that and hire people to control the limited spectrum of debate on all sides?

01:54:55.339 --> 01:55:10.369
This is nothing more than the mythology being given to you spoon fed by one of the most egregious violators of our ability to exercise informed consent, which of course includes saying no.

01:55:15.412 --> 01:55:19.915
So we can't yet say for sure,

01:55:20.953 --> 01:55:35.858
that there is a correlation, but we do know that there are data demonstrating that these products have characteristics and components that could plausibly cause those kinds of cancers.

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:39.564
We have these observations of these kinds of cancers.

01:55:40.285 --> 01:55:42.328
It's not the mechanism, it's the components.

01:55:42.368 --> 01:55:43.109
Do you hear that?

01:55:43.289 --> 01:55:44.591
That's part of the lie.

01:55:44.811 --> 01:55:52.362
So we're kind of in a position where it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, but we can't yet definitively say that it's a duck.

01:55:52.662 --> 01:55:52.843
Yeah.

01:55:53.837 --> 01:55:55.678
I want to talk a little bit about your books.

01:55:56.398 --> 01:56:00.661
One of them, Lies My Government Told Me, and the second book, The Better Future.

01:56:00.681 --> 01:56:01.701
Actually, that's the title.

01:56:01.901 --> 01:56:02.842
That's the whole title.

01:56:02.882 --> 01:56:03.842
Oh, the whole title.

01:56:03.862 --> 01:56:08.665
The second book we're working on right now is about psychological warfare in rogue government.

01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:12.553
OK, so folks, it's so important because you you are a genius.

01:56:12.593 --> 01:56:14.134
You've got so much great information.

01:56:14.174 --> 01:56:15.515
I want to encourage people.

01:56:15.836 --> 01:56:17.597
Follow Dr. Robert Malone.

01:56:17.957 --> 01:56:19.999
You can follow him at R.W.

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:20.980
Malone, M.D.

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:22.921
You're putting out so much great stuff.

01:56:22.961 --> 01:56:24.142
Tell us about this book.

01:56:24.282 --> 01:56:24.623
Lies.

01:56:24.683 --> 01:56:27.185
My government told me the better future coming.

01:56:28.166 --> 01:56:29.587
So this is published by Sky.

01:56:29.787 --> 01:56:32.409
Did he just mouth that while she was saying it?

01:56:32.449 --> 01:56:33.390
That was really weird.

01:56:34.568 --> 01:56:35.029
Watch that.

01:56:35.429 --> 01:56:36.470
W Malone, MD.

01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:38.413
You're putting out so much great stuff.

01:56:38.453 --> 01:56:42.618
Tell us about this book, Lies My Government Told Me, The Better Future Coming.

01:56:43.643 --> 01:56:45.483
So this is published by Skyhorse.

01:56:45.843 --> 01:56:47.604
It was Tony Lyons.

01:56:47.704 --> 01:56:49.644
It was kind of a follow-on to the Bobby Kim.

01:56:49.684 --> 01:56:53.365
Tony Lyons is one of the advisors to Bobby.

01:56:53.545 --> 01:56:58.306
He also does Skyhorse Publishing, which publishes all of CHD's books.

01:56:58.946 --> 01:57:03.007
CHD has its own moniker or whatever, but that's their publisher.

01:57:03.107 --> 01:57:07.268
So if they put something out under the CHD label, it's put out by Skyhorse.

01:57:08.569 --> 01:57:26.862
And so again, one of the reasons why I think I was fired from CHD was because I spoke out against Robert Malone and because they're selling Robert Malone's book and that the prophets go to Skyhorse and CHD, then you can see what's happening here, right?

01:57:27.582 --> 01:57:34.467
That if I say that Robert Malone is a meddler, that I say that Robert Malone's a bad guy, then they're selling the book of a bad guy.

01:57:36.994 --> 01:57:38.155
And so they had to let me go.

01:57:40.296 --> 01:57:46.100
They tried to trick me by saying they were removing him from the reader list of the book, but that didn't matter.

01:57:48.241 --> 01:57:49.902
He's still way up there.

01:57:51.203 --> 01:57:53.745
He's still a phone call away.

01:57:55.376 --> 01:57:59.860
And so it could be that Bobby, because he's never lied to me, Bobby has never lied to me.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:03.863
He's just, you know, sometimes, I don't know, just taking the word of other people.

01:58:03.903 --> 01:58:09.228
And if you look at that whole list of people on that list of experts, I don't have a book.

01:58:11.210 --> 01:58:18.196
I don't have all these, you know, Wikipedia that says I did that or this, or I didn't work in this part of the government or that part of the government.

01:58:18.216 --> 01:58:20.438
I didn't write five books about this part of that part.

01:58:21.999 --> 01:58:22.840
I'm just some dude.

01:58:24.352 --> 01:58:29.975
And so it's not really surprising in my mind that Robert F. Kennedy doesn't understand what's going on.

01:58:30.015 --> 01:58:32.736
I don't necessarily believe that he's a good guy or a bad guy.

01:58:32.756 --> 01:58:37.838
I'm just saying that from the pattern of behavior, Robert Malone has lied to me.

01:58:38.639 --> 01:58:40.179
His wife has kind of lied to me.

01:58:40.459 --> 01:58:41.840
Jessica Rose is a liar.

01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:47.383
These people are liars that I know and have confirmed with interaction, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:58:47.403 --> 01:58:48.023
never lied to me.

01:58:50.543 --> 01:58:51.683
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:56.145
is not the one who fired me from CHD because he wasn't working for CHD at that time.

01:58:56.205 --> 01:58:57.126
It was Mary Holland.

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:07.090
And so it's very easy now to see what's going on here if he's gonna promote Bobby and all this other stuff.

01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:16.354
And if you see this really curious video that Brett Weinstein put out on his own YouTube or on his own Twitter,

01:59:17.332 --> 01:59:27.818
where he's in front of a water and he's just got a camera and he says, I think that in order to bring unity to the United States, Donald Trump has to choose Robert F. Kennedy for his vice president.

01:59:29.219 --> 01:59:36.603
An extraordinary thing to say right after the shooting and so quickly and so loudly.

01:59:39.434 --> 01:59:45.838
The same guy, right, who brought Robert Malone out at the beginning of his dissident career in 2021.

01:59:45.898 --> 01:59:52.502
The same guy who is selling Robert Malone's book or his former organization.

01:59:52.522 --> 01:59:57.184
You see, it's not bizarre once you see it.

01:59:57.865 --> 02:00:04.489
Once you see that Brett and Eric Weinstein's father was in the Department of Justice of Robert F. Kennedy,

02:00:05.563 --> 02:00:09.906
then you see why it is that we don't talk about their dads working together ever.

02:00:09.986 --> 02:00:15.210
Not even if they have a three hour podcast together, they don't talk about their fact that their dads work together.

02:00:16.351 --> 02:00:19.934
They don't talk about the fact that Brett's dad is an IP lawyer.

02:00:20.334 --> 02:00:32.824
Who's maybe one of the most highly paid arbitrators of biological patent law in the United States that he was, that he was intimately connected to the development of, and the formation of the FDA way back when.

02:00:35.691 --> 02:00:37.011
These are not coincidences.

02:00:37.071 --> 02:00:40.792
These are things that you only know because of me or because of Mark.

02:00:41.912 --> 02:00:53.114
And without the two of us bouncing ideas off of one another and inspiring each other to look in different dark corners, none of these basic ideas would even be knowledge.

02:00:53.314 --> 02:01:02.016
No one would know the extent to which the background of Li Min Yan exposes her as a meddler unless Mark had done the work that he had done.

02:01:04.011 --> 02:01:18.194
And I don't think anyone would know the extent to which this guy is an obvious meddler if I didn't continue to do the work that I'm doing by pointing out the biological incongruencies that this guy spouts like a fire hose for four years.

02:01:18.474 --> 02:01:21.814
Kennedy book, originally, The Real Anthony Fauci, which I helped edit.

02:01:23.134 --> 02:01:23.955
Bobby's a friend.

02:01:24.875 --> 02:01:26.695
Tony Lyons, the publisher, is a friend.

02:01:26.755 --> 02:01:30.956
And he encouraged me to write this book, as did Steve Bannon.

02:01:31.836 --> 02:01:37.661
Uh, and, uh, it's, it's a, basically the origin of the book is.

02:01:38.422 --> 02:01:43.466
Steve Bannon, the guy who says that Li Min Yan should be a citizen so she can run for Senate.

02:01:44.907 --> 02:01:47.269
Li Min Yan, the hero of the world.

02:01:50.396 --> 02:01:52.659
My wife and I write a daily substack.

02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:57.006
So you can find that at rwmalonemd.substack.com.

02:01:57.046 --> 02:02:00.010
So daily essay that comes into your email.

02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:01.973
You don't have to pay for it if you don't want to.

02:02:03.384 --> 02:02:14.871
And in that we started really on a daily basis to document the lies we were encountering and tried to make sense out of what was happening to us.

02:02:15.671 --> 02:02:22.695
Beginning basically around the time of just before the Joe Rogan podcast that became so popular.

02:02:25.096 --> 02:02:31.180
And right after the Brett Weinstein Dark Horse podcast where Steve Kirsch and Brett and I talked about the jabs.

02:02:32.296 --> 02:02:39.744
And so we started putting out these- And also about how if we just gave everybody ivermectin for 30 days, we'd get back to zero COVID.

02:02:40.905 --> 02:02:44.169
Or maybe it was that and silicoxib or something, right?

02:02:44.529 --> 02:02:49.254
Essays on a daily basis and then had encouragement that we should write a book.

02:02:50.255 --> 02:02:53.759
And so we decided to kind of serialize the book.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:00.805
And so that became the basis for the chapters.

02:03:01.505 --> 02:03:18.160
And what it really is is a real-time account of our journey trying to make sense out of the COVID crisis, trying to make sense out of things like the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab and the censorship and Tony Fauci.

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:27.303
and what went on at NIH, and all of these things that contribute to the COVID crisis that we've all lived through.

02:03:28.203 --> 02:03:30.544
So a lot of people find it helpful.

02:03:30.604 --> 02:03:31.705
It's not a small book.

02:03:32.225 --> 02:03:36.266
It has a lot of detail, and it's produced by two academics, so it's highly referenced.

02:03:37.267 --> 02:03:43.429
But you can parachute into any one chapter if you wish.

02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:46.590
It's organized into three sections.

02:03:47.634 --> 02:03:50.737
around the idea of how a physician approaches a patient.

02:03:51.738 --> 02:03:56.022
So if you come to me as a patient, the first thing I do is I listen to you.

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.443
I ask you your story.

02:03:57.583 --> 02:04:03.308
I ask what your chief complaint is, where your pain is, what's happened to you.

02:04:04.590 --> 02:04:06.551
So that's the history and physical.

02:04:07.628 --> 02:04:09.529
The next thing I do is I examine you.

02:04:09.609 --> 02:04:10.929
That's the physical exam.

02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:13.810
I say, what is actually happening to you?

02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:14.910
What are your symptoms?

02:04:15.611 --> 02:04:20.172
And then the last part of the interaction with the physician is the treatment plan.

02:04:20.212 --> 02:04:21.293
What are you going to do about it?

02:04:22.093 --> 02:04:23.453
So that's the structure of the book.

02:04:24.213 --> 02:04:34.517
The first third of the book is people talking about their own experiences, people like Pierre Kory and Meryl Nass and Matthias Desmet.

02:04:35.643 --> 02:04:45.006
and our own experiences of being censored and propagandized and defamed.

02:04:45.066 --> 02:04:53.368
So the first third of the book is people talk experiences of being censored and propagandized and defamed.

02:05:05.066 --> 02:05:09.688
So the first third is people's direct experience during the COVID crisis.

02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:13.290
And then the second part is all about what does this mean?

02:05:13.450 --> 02:05:14.771
How do we make sense out of this?

02:05:15.411 --> 02:05:17.992
It talks about inverted totalitarianism.

02:05:18.473 --> 02:05:26.857
It really introduced a lot of things that we now accept as part of our daily dialogue when we try to talk about the government and COVID crisis.

02:05:28.549 --> 02:05:37.623
He is suggesting that a lot of the vocabulary that we use to discuss this operation is actually coined by him in his book.

02:05:39.434 --> 02:05:41.556
That is extraordinary!

02:05:41.776 --> 02:05:43.297
What an egomaniac!

02:05:43.577 --> 02:05:47.620
Last part is where the hardest part for me to write, the better future coming.

02:05:47.781 --> 02:05:49.002
What can we do about this?

02:05:49.662 --> 02:05:51.323
What are the changes that need to be made?

02:05:51.383 --> 02:05:58.209
For instance, we talk at length about Schedule F and Donald Trump's plans to reform the bureaucracy.

02:05:58.929 --> 02:06:02.572
We talk about the corruption and the revolving door at the FDA, etc.

02:06:03.575 --> 02:06:15.336
So that's the structure of the book, and it can be kind of thought of as a way to understand, comprehend, process all these confusing things that we've all experienced.

02:06:16.141 --> 02:06:21.122
And it is so important that you're getting all these confusing things that we've experienced.

02:06:21.242 --> 02:06:31.744
Not that he's part of the confusion that you experienced, but he experienced the confusion just like you, just like when Jordan Peterson said that we're all in psychological disarray.

02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:34.685
He doesn't have any, any solution for it either.

02:06:35.105 --> 02:06:36.925
He's just as lost as we are.

02:06:39.226 --> 02:06:40.386
This is a lie.

02:06:41.471 --> 02:06:45.973
And it is a very malevolent one because they intend to mislead the young with these lies.

02:06:46.153 --> 02:06:49.235
Getting the word out and that people just, you know, feel encouraged.

02:06:49.295 --> 02:06:52.036
And this, you've answered my question about hope.

02:06:52.096 --> 02:06:54.818
It's right there in your book, The Better Future Coming.

02:06:55.178 --> 02:06:58.019
Dr. Robert Malone, thank you so much for being here today.

02:06:58.059 --> 02:07:01.001
I do hope to have you back with us again soon on this podcast.

02:07:01.381 --> 02:07:03.642
Thanks for having me and thanks for taking the time to listen.

02:07:04.941 --> 02:07:05.842
Extraordinary.

02:07:06.103 --> 02:07:07.765
Absolutely extraordinary.

02:07:07.845 --> 02:07:12.170
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that Robert Malone is an interesting kind of hero.

02:07:19.793 --> 02:07:28.317
That was Robert Malone, the hero from February, 2024, not telling us much, but absolutely exposing their illusion and how they created it.

02:07:28.837 --> 02:07:33.839
We need a new consensus, ladies and gentlemen, that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:42.203
We need a new consensus that RNA cannot pandemic, and we need a new consensus that the vaccine schedule in the USA is a criminal enterprise.

02:07:42.603 --> 02:07:45.685
And finally, we need a new consensus about the idea that yes,

02:07:46.505 --> 02:07:51.511
national security state would have murdered people and lied about it in order to protect these truths.

02:07:52.632 --> 02:07:57.257
Yes, they would have murdered people and lied about it in order to protect these truths.

02:07:57.677 --> 02:08:05.025
And yes, they would have put people in place before the pandemic to make sure that they had the wherewithal to protect these truths.

02:08:05.085 --> 02:08:07.448
And the way that they did it was the way that Edward Bernays

02:08:07.848 --> 02:08:10.189
And Noam Chomsky and other people have described it.

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:17.973
It's a limited spectrum of debate within which we are trapped, where we never ask the question of, how do you make a cuckoo clock make toast?

02:08:18.353 --> 02:08:24.356
We never ask the question, how do our cells make viruses when they don't normally make viruses?

02:08:24.756 --> 02:08:33.541
How does the virus DNA or the virus RNA hijack our cells to make them do something that they don't already do when they don't?

02:08:34.417 --> 02:08:35.858
That's not what's happening here.

02:08:36.459 --> 02:08:39.621
These signals are being misconstrued as something they are not.

02:08:40.021 --> 02:08:47.126
And they are covering up the fact that RNA virology is almost exclusively transfection and transformation in cell culture.

02:08:47.146 --> 02:08:48.748
And that's why they don't want to talk about how

02:08:49.568 --> 02:08:54.652
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:08:55.032 --> 02:09:05.581
They don't want to talk about how transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and they don't want to talk about how viruses are not pattern integrities and therefore RNA cannot pandemic.

02:09:06.282 --> 02:09:15.269
Ladies and gentlemen, the weaponized piles of money have used social media to convince us what to argue about

02:09:18.451 --> 02:09:23.012
And participating in that argument has accepted the premise of their narrative by default.

02:09:23.713 --> 02:09:27.794
And that's happening even as we speak and not just about the pandemic, but about everything.

02:09:29.275 --> 02:09:35.758
And once you see that social media is the way they do it, you come to the conclusion that I've come to, which is you've got to get off.

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.441
I don't have a Facebook account.

02:09:38.561 --> 02:09:39.642
I don't have a MySpace.

02:09:39.722 --> 02:09:41.164
I don't, I have my website.

02:09:41.664 --> 02:09:55.635
I have a peer tube and I have the, the soap box and I'm leaving X, like I am leaving all of these social media because they are the fifth generation warfare.

02:09:55.715 --> 02:09:56.376
It is not

02:09:57.717 --> 02:10:00.379
a useful window into reality.

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:08.604
It is the weaponized piles of money using social media to convince you what to argue about and with whom to argue.

02:10:08.624 --> 02:10:17.590
And if you want to get out, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to get out, the way to get out is to log off and join us on the outside.

02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:24.034
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Giga Ohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:10:24.634 --> 02:10:25.175
If you want to

02:10:28.464 --> 02:10:32.927
If you want to support the stream, you can go to gigaohmbiological.com.

02:10:33.387 --> 02:10:36.689
If you want to talk with us, you can go to gigaohm.bio.

02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:46.015
And if you want to share the stream after it's already not live anymore, please share the link from stream.gigaohm.bio, because that's our link.

02:10:46.235 --> 02:10:48.757
That won't allow YouTube to distract anybody.

02:10:49.197 --> 02:10:51.239
It won't allow Twitter to distract anybody.

02:10:51.279 --> 02:10:55.081
It won't allow any of these rumble to distract people.

02:10:55.141 --> 02:10:57.863
They will be on our website seeing our content.

02:10:58.463 --> 02:11:00.907
and asking our questions is what we need to do.

02:11:01.368 --> 02:11:04.252
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being here and I'll see you again tomorrow.
