00:18.118 --> 00:28.466
Good, good, good, good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

00:28.586 --> 00:31.788
It's 1214 on the 8th of January.

00:48.669 --> 00:51.370
2025.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.370
Welcome to GigaOM Biological.

00:51.410 --> 00:52.210
Good morning, Christy.

00:52.230 --> 00:53.010
Good morning, Tony.

00:53.931 --> 00:54.711
Good morning, Cube.

00:58.492 --> 01:06.093
If you're interested in who produces GigaOM Biological, this information brief is brought to you by a biologist named Jonathan Cui.

01:06.113 --> 01:08.234
The last name is C-O-U-E-Y.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.275
First initials J and J. Good morning, Mark.

01:13.055 --> 01:14.295
Thank you guys for being here.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.076
I'm excited about this one.

01:19.505 --> 01:22.669
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.012
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:26.954 --> 01:27.935
Isolation, what was it?

01:28.095 --> 01:29.096
Isolation and purification.

01:30.818 --> 01:31.559
Of the virus?

01:31.639 --> 01:31.860
Yes.

01:33.081 --> 01:34.863
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:41.647 --> 01:44.130
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:44.770 --> 01:49.655
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:50.216 --> 01:52.778
I don't understand what the issue is.

01:52.978 --> 02:00.266
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.007
Okay.

02:02.148 --> 02:04.570
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

02:07.110 --> 02:09.052
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:09.112 --> 02:10.974
I mean, he actually isolated it.

02:11.235 --> 02:15.159
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:15.239 --> 02:17.301
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:23.008 --> 02:28.614
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:29.315 --> 02:35.860
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

02:35.980 --> 02:41.505
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

02:41.805 --> 02:43.767
It's just a big hassle in the end.

02:45.777 --> 03:00.112
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

03:00.172 --> 03:02.675
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

03:05.461 --> 03:07.982
just it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

03:08.002 --> 03:11.903
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:11.923 --> 03:17.524
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:17.564 --> 03:22.285
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:30.194 --> 03:31.735
I think truth is good for kids.

03:32.175 --> 03:35.956
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

03:36.476 --> 03:38.117
We want everybody to feel good.

03:38.237 --> 03:40.477
That's not, that's not the way life is.

03:42.978 --> 03:46.899
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:48.700 --> 03:49.420
And I have lied.

03:49.580 --> 03:50.460
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.421
I don't want to lie.

03:51.901 --> 03:53.241
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

03:53.361 --> 03:54.382
I try not to be a liar.

03:54.422 --> 03:55.262
I don't want to be a liar.

03:55.822 --> 03:58.543
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:00.626 --> 04:20.298
the rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it sweaty palms this is so crazy like goosebumps this is so crazy i feel so nervous like what in the world man he introduced

04:21.360 --> 04:39.934
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

04:41.035 --> 04:49.481
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

04:53.737 --> 04:54.937
I don't care how you get there.

04:54.957 --> 04:57.658
I don't care what you do to get there.

04:57.678 --> 05:00.259
The goal is to win.

05:22.997 --> 05:23.098
you

06:21.711 --> 06:22.632
and and

07:31.408 --> 07:31.508
Help!

07:31.548 --> 07:31.628
Help!

08:01.349 --> 08:03.770
Certainly you didn't think I was going to leave it there, did you?

08:06.391 --> 08:08.471
Almost never is the key to that.

08:08.491 --> 08:11.812
Almost never is the key to those words there.

08:11.852 --> 08:13.853
This time could definitely be different.

08:15.173 --> 08:19.175
I think it could be different because we are way, way, way off their script.

08:19.755 --> 08:23.556
And that means that there's lots of kinks in the armor that we can take advantage of.

08:24.276 --> 08:30.740
intramuscular injection being dumb, or transfection being criminal, or RNA being unable to pandemic.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.701
Thank you very much for being here, everybody.

08:32.721 --> 08:38.104
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:38.604 --> 08:40.806
It's January 8th, 2025.

08:41.266 --> 08:47.870
We are still fighting this five-year-long narrative, this script that's been enacted on social media covering up a background.

08:48.330 --> 08:51.852
I've got a new project in the works called JC on the hardwood.

08:51.872 --> 08:53.533
Sometimes I'm gonna be busy with that.

08:54.153 --> 08:56.456
Not today, this afternoon maybe.

08:57.677 --> 08:59.459
Covid shots are bad, don't talk about 2020.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.003
Healthy people really don't get sick, that's the truth.

09:04.524 --> 09:07.807
And that's what they need to cover up with this illusion about public health.

09:08.668 --> 09:12.492
Bad biology 101 and evolution because DNA is how they've done it.

09:12.972 --> 09:14.533
They bamboozled your parents with it.

09:14.553 --> 09:15.873
They're bamboozling us with it.

09:15.933 --> 09:20.095
The real six-word way out is intramuscular injection of medicine is dumb.

09:20.895 --> 09:24.617
An intramuscular injection is the single worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

09:25.257 --> 09:29.459
Don't use their vocabulary or you'll be stuck in their slave speak.

09:29.499 --> 09:34.381
The new biology 101 would be life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.042
And so that's where we are, right?

09:37.102 --> 09:38.363
There's a background signal.

09:38.383 --> 09:40.364
They misconstrued it as spread.

09:41.304 --> 10:04.305
um and with how they did it was they just released a sequence that had a lot of overlap with that background maybe even had some proprietary secrets in it it doesn't really matter because this the pcr tests weren't specific and i was on to that little nugget in 2020 and that's why i think all these people came to my house for five years and put me on signal chats and i think this mystery can be

10:05.126 --> 10:15.373
You can get a hold of it by starting at the history in 2020 with the Corman-Jorston review and the authors that are on it and the sort of claims that they made and the claims that they didn't make.

10:15.413 --> 10:20.336
That was what we were talking about yesterday on the stream and I think it was a really strong one.

10:20.356 --> 10:25.519
I'm really excited to be here again because I do think it's just a spectacular commitment to lies.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.481
That's all that's required and that's who we are fighting.

10:28.521 --> 10:32.204
These people that are sustaining this mythology about what the genome is.

10:32.904 --> 10:39.967
what it's revealed about us and what, you know, free-range gain-of-function RNAs can do.

10:41.347 --> 10:45.349
And that's why I think it's really important where we are right now.

10:45.969 --> 10:47.449
It's so exciting to be here.

10:47.509 --> 10:48.750
I'm really happy to be here.

10:48.770 --> 10:52.411
It's not what I wanted to have happen there.

10:52.431 --> 10:53.552
I don't know why that happened.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.093
I think I have to do something really quick with this one, maybe?

10:56.153 --> 10:56.393
Yeah.

10:57.335 --> 10:59.037
So that means I have to set this one up different.

10:59.077 --> 11:00.059
Hold on one second.

11:00.079 --> 11:08.149
Let me just... There was some tech not quite ready to go in the background, which I probably need to restore to there.

11:09.395 --> 11:29.820
and then that should be enough and now that would mean that i'm also here yes okay great um yeah so rna cannot pandemic that's the message right there and their biology would would have you believe that not only can rna pandemic but we are in the sixth year of something pandemicking from a bat cave where it was sprayed

11:30.560 --> 11:32.302
or a mud puddle where it was spilled.

11:33.403 --> 11:43.110
And this, of course, is all under the pretense that there was no background, there is no background, and whatever background there is, is very easy to differentiate this new thing from it.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.333
And I think that is a gigantic illusion.

11:47.154 --> 11:56.341
And the illusion they're trying to cover up is that there was another biological phenomenon that needed managing, that was especially acute in Western countries, where

11:56.821 --> 12:13.746
an excess of old people as a result of the big families after World War II was a problem in needing of managing because these unhealthy people in America are going to cost us a lot of money if we're going to try and keep them alive with the state-of-the-art 21st century medicine at $500,000 every six months.

12:15.927 --> 12:18.528
And of course this was compounding in 2003 and 2004.

12:18.568 --> 12:19.528
They could all see it coming.

12:22.378 --> 12:26.421
And so that's why Tony Fauci and these other people were able to say that this was coming.

12:26.441 --> 12:51.580
They knew this was coming because this was a story that they were going to use to disguise the management of this problem and also to take advantage of as an opportunity to usher in a new level of genetic sampling and control of remnants, generation, so that they could slowly convert our children from sovereign individuals that maybe even our parents weren't really.

12:52.870 --> 12:57.492
into full-blown experimental animals with our absolute assent to it.

12:58.733 --> 13:03.215
And I think that, you know, myths perpetuated by traitors are hiding murder with lies.

13:03.275 --> 13:06.996
And that's what this, why no one talks about the population pyramid.

13:07.036 --> 13:15.240
It's not no one talks about it like as in a few people, it's no one as in zero, zero, right?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.441
Just please keep that in mind, zero.

13:19.414 --> 13:25.280
Just like nobody talks about how many people have died of opioid overdose in America.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.441
Nobody gives a shit.

13:29.284 --> 13:31.266
But there are plenty of parents around.

13:31.306 --> 13:40.195
You can find all kinds of parents and you can find all kinds of grandparents that can tell you the story of how opioids have ruined their family.

13:41.792 --> 13:56.046
It's comparatively very difficult to find people who will tell you stories about how pedophilia and kidnapping and eating of children and adrenochrome has ruined their family.

13:56.827 --> 13:58.168
Isn't that kind of striking?

13:59.309 --> 14:00.649
I kind of find it striking.

14:00.689 --> 14:05.431
I mean, I'm not saying that there's no pedophiles or that there's no kidnapping or anything like that.

14:05.911 --> 14:17.755
But given the fact that people write multiple volume books about this as being the primary control mechanism of America and all these other elites, it is quite remarkable, isn't it?

14:19.332 --> 14:24.514
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

14:24.554 --> 14:28.375
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally, you know, negligent.

14:28.395 --> 14:30.715
It was criminal because they knew already it wouldn't work.

14:31.135 --> 14:34.376
And RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

14:34.396 --> 14:35.397
They're not alive.

14:35.437 --> 14:44.239
And if they are anything to be concerned about or to be thought of, they should be thought of as part of ourselves and the way that we are connected to our environment.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.220
And so in that sense, generated by us,

14:47.298 --> 14:53.320
produced by us and therefore we are not understanding anything about this background.

14:53.380 --> 14:56.702
Now I'm saying background, not viruses produced by us.

14:57.302 --> 15:14.969
I'm saying background produced by us that's being misconstrued as a entire field of biology that has all kinds of interesting quirks that we don't take advantage of in terms of the chemical stability of and the usefulness of RNA.

15:18.547 --> 15:23.450
This mythology can be broken, but it can't be broken by simply saying there are no viruses.

15:23.510 --> 15:26.371
It cannot be broken by simply saying there was no COVID.

15:27.852 --> 15:30.193
We have to rise to the occasion, ladies and gentlemen.

15:30.233 --> 15:40.719
We need to rise to the occasion and understand exactly how these myths are constructed so that we can see how precarious the position that these people are in right now.

15:40.779 --> 15:44.881
Essentially what they are is they're standing on a set of monkey bars

15:46.437 --> 15:49.218
and they're not a very well-constructed set of monkey bars.

15:49.318 --> 15:54.439
The joints are not very tight and they're standing on them with just two feet on two bars.

15:54.499 --> 16:14.803
And so at any moment, if this structure were to move or to get tampered with, all of these people are gonna fall crotch first through a monkey bars that might be four or five stories high and is not in any way, shape or form built in a buckyball shape or with triangles.

16:16.701 --> 16:18.162
but is really ready to collapse.

16:18.222 --> 16:20.944
If you just pulled one bar out, the whole thing would fall down.

16:20.984 --> 16:29.789
And these people are standing on top of it, screaming at the top of their lungs, doing cheerleader-like pyramids with each other on social media.

16:33.197 --> 16:36.119
And it's really close to collapse, ladies and gentlemen.

16:36.139 --> 16:41.122
When they were only a couple bars high and it was just a real easy illusion to sustain, it's very different.

16:41.142 --> 16:49.228
But now that they've gone this far for this long, it's starting to become very obvious that, you know what, there was an easy way out.

16:51.249 --> 16:55.532
There are easy questions that remain unanswered from 2020 and 2021, whose answers include murder.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.051
And none of these people are talking about it.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.693
None of them are talking about it.

17:03.713 --> 17:04.573
It's very interesting.

17:04.613 --> 17:28.113
The health freedom movement, MAGA movement that's concerned about processed foods and cereals made by Kellogg's is composed largely of either full-on fakes that have just come on stage recently with a book and a Tucker Carlson interview, or people that before the pandemic had books about vaccines and childhood illness.

17:29.773 --> 17:32.596
genetic and environmental causes of these things.

17:34.497 --> 17:49.031
And then at the start of the pandemic had some kind of weird certainty about a furin cleavage site or some weird certainty about a spike protein that can cause amyloidosis or some weird certainty about this being a gain of function virus before I even knew what that term meant.

17:50.692 --> 17:54.716
People were using the term flying AIDS already in 2020.

17:58.493 --> 18:06.420
And those people have still more prominent social media space than anyone that's been trying to tear it down.

18:09.963 --> 18:17.129
And the more closely you've come to these people, the more likely it is that you are completely ignored.

18:17.189 --> 18:21.273
Because again, you see them, you've seen them, you're ignored now.

18:21.833 --> 18:25.937
You might even see Brooke Jackson as being somebody who largely gets ignored now.

18:27.468 --> 18:29.268
Almost as if maybe she was set up.

18:33.169 --> 18:33.609
I don't know.

18:33.629 --> 18:36.590
I don't know how to determine who's good and who's bad.

18:36.630 --> 18:49.853
But what I can say for sure is that any good components of the health freedom movement will be able to take, and I want to make sure that this is very clear in case Jeff decides to cut a clip of this.

18:55.014 --> 19:10.459
I just want to make it very clear that I think that my stance of being hyper sensitive, hyper critical of almost everyone that I've come in contact with is a largely innocuous stance.

19:11.735 --> 19:29.315
Because if we are indeed fighting for all the marbles, and all the marbles include our children being sovereign individuals, not subject to some global public health state that can sample from them whenever they want to, and can dictate the way that they interact with their neighbors.

19:32.714 --> 19:43.880
then my being hypercritical of people will always be superseded by the first slide that I start with and by what that first slide that I start with should be enabling people to do.

19:46.342 --> 19:59.889
Any doctor that wanted to could take those words and just try to challenge themselves to go into the literature and go into their books and talk to their friends and figure out what's wrong with what I'm saying there and make progress, sharpen the sword.

20:01.550 --> 20:02.431
Iron sharpens iron.

20:04.022 --> 20:05.363
But that will not be done.

20:05.443 --> 20:06.483
It's not being done.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.904
And if anybody does it, you gotta let me know.

20:10.105 --> 20:21.410
Because those are likely small, still good components of the health freedom movement that is being regularly sabotaged and has been regularly sabotaged since before the pandemic.

20:21.591 --> 20:27.413
Otherwise, the people that had the mic in 2015, the people that had book deals in 2016,

20:30.373 --> 20:40.021
The people that made movies in 2016 would have brought those books and those movies up in 2020 and their anti-vaccine stance in 2016.

20:40.521 --> 20:46.986
And they would have brought that up in 2020 and said, hey, we don't want to believe anything that these people say.

20:47.026 --> 20:48.347
That would be crazy.

20:49.649 --> 20:54.953
Do you know what we knew already back in 2016 when we made our movie Vaxxed?

20:56.889 --> 21:06.157
But instead, those people were the people that said furin cleavage site and spike protein and lab leak and repurposed drugs are being covered up.

21:09.380 --> 21:38.014
And so yesterday I went back to Rome, Italy, and the International COVID Summit number one, where Bobby Malone also seems to have talked to a Cardinal that's very close to the Pope, and one of the people that has, on a short list of people that has been openly proposed in the media as a successor to the current Pope, and is the current head of the Pontifical Academy for Science or something like that.

21:39.352 --> 21:42.455
And that was a very, very revealing interview.

21:42.615 --> 21:45.557
And I think my analysis of it yesterday was pretty spot on.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.020
Although every time I watch a video like that, I find new things.

21:50.121 --> 21:52.983
I think my show from yesterday was one of the best shows I've ever done.

21:53.043 --> 21:54.284
I'll be at three hours long.

21:55.726 --> 21:58.968
I'm really, really proud of, of where and how far we've come.

21:59.048 --> 22:04.533
Thanks to all of you guys and the support that you, that you've given my family over these five years.

22:06.147 --> 22:09.128
Today, I want to, I don't know why it's not changing.

22:09.188 --> 22:09.948
What did I do here?

22:10.849 --> 22:24.594
Today, I want to resume our work or keep the pressure on by going back a few months from where we got the video yesterday to a NIH Wednesday lecture titled Fueling the Next Genomic Revolution.

22:24.674 --> 22:32.457
Now, the reason why I'm so curious about this is multiple fold, one of them being, of course, the inspirational work of Mark Kulak,

22:33.177 --> 22:37.461
who I think has brought to my attention the first presenter.

22:37.521 --> 22:44.708
Now, if he's in this, in the chat and watching, then, you know, when the first presenter comes on, he can confirm that he knows who she is.

22:45.349 --> 22:51.335
And I will confess that part of the reason why I'm doing it in this way is because I want other people to find it before me.

22:52.036 --> 22:57.061
But I know if I'm right, then he has a page on her and probably has already done a show on her.

22:58.281 --> 23:02.083
or at least mentioned her in the past, I think she's connected somehow.

23:02.123 --> 23:05.625
And it's very interesting that she's in this particular thing.

23:05.665 --> 23:09.427
Now, think about the title here, Fueling the Next Genomic Revolution.

23:14.497 --> 23:15.738
Think about this title here.

23:15.858 --> 23:17.259
Let me get myself a little tinier.

23:18.200 --> 23:25.325
Fueling the Next Genomic Revolution, Maximizing the Impact of Bacterial, Human, and Human Metagenomic Genome Knowledge.

23:25.866 --> 23:29.389
Human Metagenomic Genome Knowledge.

23:29.469 --> 23:42.399
Now, in my best layman's understanding of what metagenomics is, it is the idea of taking all the genetic noise in the background and then using computer algorithms to try and make some sense of it.

23:43.593 --> 23:55.929
And one of the people that pioneered this is Metabiota, which is a very impressive, highly scientific, well-respected company in American history, right?

23:57.031 --> 24:06.379
And so metagenomic genome knowledge, human metagenomic genome knowledge is a very interesting combination of words to use here.

24:07.319 --> 24:11.603
And I think it's worthwhile to keep that in the back of your mind as we watch this video.

24:12.103 --> 24:17.868
So I'm going to escape here and I think I have it this way, smaller and then

24:19.827 --> 24:29.229
And I think I'm going to also, again, speed it up just a little bit, assuming that these people are going to talk at some reduced academic speed here.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.510
Let me just resize the window.

24:32.590 --> 24:33.350
I apologize.

24:33.490 --> 24:35.091
I've got to get it up on the third screen here.

24:36.891 --> 24:41.052
The third screen in my setup is kind of virtual, so it's a little trickier to get it there.

24:41.132 --> 24:42.352
So you can see here the title.

24:42.452 --> 24:43.293
It's an hour and 39 minutes.

24:47.338 --> 24:59.466
So Claire Frazier to me, I know this is going to sound really dumb, but Claire Frazier to me just reminds me of Outlander because my wife made me watch the first couple seasons of that show.

25:00.087 --> 25:03.109
And I think there's a character named Claire Frazier.

25:03.996 --> 25:04.436
Am I not?

25:04.556 --> 25:04.996
Am I right?

25:05.076 --> 25:05.476
I don't care.

25:06.597 --> 25:07.877
That's who's going to speak first.

25:07.917 --> 25:16.860
Then there's this Charles Rotimi, who's an African man who's talking about sampling genomes in Africa, which is fantastic.

25:17.280 --> 25:28.824
And then Eric Lander, who comes on and he's going to talk about what they're doing now, because I guess they didn't finish everything in 2001 or didn't finish everything in 2015 or whatever they didn't finish.

25:29.797 --> 25:36.079
And so Francis Collins is going to give a little introduction, and I think the first person to speak is going to be Claire Frazier.

25:45.222 --> 25:47.382
I'm Francis Collins, the director of NIH.

25:47.502 --> 25:53.384
I'm happy to welcome you to a Wednesday afternoon lecture and a very special one, if I do say so myself, and I might be just a little biased here.

25:53.864 --> 25:56.205
The title is Fueling the Next Genomic Revolution.

25:56.795 --> 26:01.902
maximizing the impact of bacterial human and human metagenome genomic knowledge and technology.

26:02.002 --> 26:08.932
That's quite a mouthful, but you're going to see what that all means here in the next hour and a half, because we have a very special lineup here of experts to speak to you.

26:09.333 --> 26:13.779
Today, we are indeed celebrating and commemorating some anniversaries.

26:14.659 --> 26:19.385
And it happens that 2021 has a series of those that sort of fall in this year.

26:19.405 --> 26:27.114
And we genome people have been accused of looking for reasons to celebrate almost everything, including the complete sequence of the human genome, which we have celebrated at least five times.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.782
That's pretty funny.

26:30.802 --> 26:32.463
It's like self-deprecating himself.

26:32.504 --> 26:35.566
We celebrate whenever we can with the Human Genome Project.

26:36.868 --> 26:39.310
And so let's just hear what he's got to say.

26:39.330 --> 26:39.710
It's funny.

26:39.830 --> 26:46.497
People have been accused of looking for reasons to celebrate almost everything, including the complete sequence of the human genome, which we have celebrated at least five times.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.618
We're probably not done yet.

26:48.118 --> 26:49.840
But that's particularly for today.

26:50.573 --> 26:56.096
the 25-year anniversary of the first complete bacterial genome, that being Haemophilus influenzae.

26:56.456 --> 27:00.678
And actually, I looked, it was really July of 95, but that's close enough to being at 25 years from now.

27:01.898 --> 27:12.403
It is, in a big way, the 20th anniversary of the publication of the Human Genome from the International Human Genome Project Leadership, and at the same time, a publication from Celera of the Human Genome

27:12.936 --> 27:14.797
These are in nature and science respectively.

27:15.058 --> 27:19.721
And 15 years ago... I think Celera was Vintner's company, right?

27:19.821 --> 27:21.922
And again, this is just me being a fool.

27:22.102 --> 27:26.545
Many people are considering the first human metagenome from Jeff Gordon in science.

27:26.565 --> 27:31.088
Looking back, I can add one more anniversary, and that is the coining of the word genomics.

27:31.869 --> 27:38.473
Many of you who have used that almost in every paragraph in your research efforts may be surprised to know that that word only got put out there in 1986.

27:39.730 --> 27:44.990
Okay, so I just did a little, you know, very, very weak Google.

27:45.945 --> 27:55.812
Nonsense here and I just wanted to show you what I found because there's a couple interesting little quirks that you know Anybody could stumble upon first There's little genomics article here.

27:55.852 --> 28:00.776
You could read about it and listen to again Some of this is just slave speak, right?

28:00.796 --> 28:13.225
Some of this is just the the big words that contain the big concepts which are really big assumptions and some of the history here, of course all the history that is here is probably reasonably accurate and

28:14.425 --> 28:16.106
And so he's talking a little bit about that.

28:16.146 --> 28:22.007
But the one that I found really interesting was this one, which is the Thousand Genomes Project.

28:22.067 --> 28:33.190
Now the Thousand Genome Project takes place from 2008 to 2015 and was an international research effort to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation at the time.

28:33.930 --> 28:40.312
Now what you need to see is that in this one, they talk a little bit about the Human Genome Project.

28:42.835 --> 28:45.417
And where do they say it?

28:46.658 --> 28:57.066
The Genomics Revolution, Genomic Analysis, Historically Shotgun, High-Throughput Sequencing Assembly, Annotation, Functional Genomics.

28:57.086 --> 28:58.828
Hold on, I think I found it down here.

29:01.790 --> 29:03.651
Genomic Medicine, Population.

29:03.691 --> 29:06.614
Okay, somewhere in here I clicked over to the next one.

29:07.674 --> 29:10.917
And where I found it, I guess doesn't really matter.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.098
You can do that for yourself.

29:13.234 --> 29:24.066
But what I think is most important to see is that in one of these articles I read, I don't remember which one it was on, they said that they only sequenced one genome, right?

29:24.106 --> 29:28.732
They made lots of restriction enzyme maps of one genome.

29:30.674 --> 29:34.058
And so it was like a landmark list of one genome.

29:36.109 --> 29:56.157
And so then already now what I'm trying to suggest to you is that this project, the 100,000 Genomes Project was designed to start to get a handle on what little or how much data they actually had after spending all that time sequencing one genome.

29:57.935 --> 30:06.420
And so what's important to see here, and I just want to bring it out because, you know, whatever, I got to just get it out there all the time, is the outline of the project is here.

30:06.460 --> 30:16.106
The Human Genome Project consists of approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs, and is estimated to carry around 20,000 protein encoding genes.

30:16.146 --> 30:17.847
And then the rest, they don't really know what they do.

30:18.867 --> 30:28.854
In designing the study, the consortium needed to address several critical issues regarding the project's metrics, such as technology challenges, data quality standards, and sequence coverage.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.896
So how much, you know, who's more accurate than who?

30:31.956 --> 30:32.616
Who's going to do it?

30:32.657 --> 30:33.437
So who did they do it?

30:33.477 --> 30:45.245
Over the next three years, scientists at the Sanger Institute, BGI, Shengxin, and the National Human Genome Research Institute, which is in Bethesda, Maryland.

30:45.285 --> 30:45.865
So BGI

30:47.481 --> 30:50.322
is the Beijing Genomics Institute.

30:52.363 --> 31:15.511
And what's really interesting is that the materials produced for a lot of the early PCR tests in America, including a PCR test run by a company named Ultimate DX in California, were single amplicon tests aimed at the end protein

31:16.232 --> 31:22.055
with a control that was a bacteriophage expressing the desired amplicon.

31:24.216 --> 31:29.379
And these reagents, these tests, were produced by BGI.

31:36.222 --> 31:42.165
And so what you can see is very, very easily how, wow, I mean, could it possibly be?

31:42.305 --> 31:43.686
Could it possibly be that

31:44.594 --> 31:53.121
these people in America that are working against us are cooperating actively with, or that China's not at all getting in the way of them.

31:56.504 --> 32:02.249
I think you need to start to open your eyes a little bit, ladies and gentlemen, to the possibility that this is very, very dark.

32:05.422 --> 32:30.522
that there aren't very many podcasts that aren't involved in this not in the sense of that they know but they have been used to to propagate these mythologies and these people that's why these people are the same people that have been on so many podcasts you think that's fun and strikingly how many few how few people call me for an interview what is it Jason Levine

32:32.222 --> 32:37.044
Nick Hudson's friend, Germ Warfare, and Lee Merritt.

32:38.365 --> 32:39.065
That's the list.

32:45.769 --> 32:47.990
It's remarkable once you see it, ladies and gentlemen.

32:48.030 --> 32:49.811
I think there's a lot of work to do, of course.

32:49.851 --> 32:55.374
There's a lot of ends to tie up, but the work is all doable by anybody that wants to do it.

32:56.134 --> 32:57.655
It doesn't just have to be me and Mark.

33:00.076 --> 33:01.437
So this is another anniversary, 35th.

33:02.196 --> 33:02.656
for the word.

33:03.557 --> 33:08.259
So we brought together an all-star team of genomic pioneers to help us, Drs.

33:08.299 --> 33:13.021
Claire Frazier, Charles Rigamy, and Eric Lander, and I will introduce them when we get to their presentation.

33:13.061 --> 33:15.242
But I want to- Volume is not okay.

33:15.342 --> 33:16.043
Now is it better?

33:16.103 --> 33:17.183
Are you getting better?

33:17.203 --> 33:17.763
Is that better?

33:18.524 --> 33:20.725
I just hear a little bit of a blow in the background.

33:22.106 --> 33:22.526
I'm sorry.

33:22.566 --> 33:25.347
I'm still playing with this thing, trying to get my ears right.

33:26.628 --> 33:29.209
Take a few moments here just by way of introduction to set the stage.

33:30.441 --> 33:34.424
I was about 1987 when I first heard about the plan to sequence the human genome.

33:34.444 --> 33:42.429
I was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan trying to find genes that cause human disease and finding it was really hard because there was no sequence, there was no map.

33:42.869 --> 33:44.551
Most of the genome was dark matter.

33:44.571 --> 33:46.432
We could barely find our way around.

33:46.992 --> 33:55.478
Just searching for the cystic fibrosis gene took multiple groups over many years until finally finding a just three base pair deletion that was responsible for the most common

33:56.145 --> 33:58.526
causes of cystic fibrosis on chromosome 7.

33:58.706 --> 34:00.807
But it was brutal getting to that answer.

34:00.948 --> 34:06.710
And it was pretty clear that was not going to be replicatable for other diseases that were even less common and maybe less well-behaved genetically.

34:07.351 --> 34:11.133
So when I heard about the Genome Project, I thought, oh, yeah, please, wouldn't it be great to get this done?

34:11.153 --> 34:14.854
Because then this kind of disease gene search could be a lot more efficient.

34:15.655 --> 34:17.216
But it also seemed wildly ambitious.

34:17.976 --> 34:23.959
Fortunately, there were visionaries, and there was Congress who came up with some money, and there was Jim Watson, who was asked to come and lead the effort

34:24.457 --> 34:30.502
at NIH, and it got this off the ground, and a bunch of us got pretty fired up about it, including some of the people you're going to hear about from today.

34:31.623 --> 34:46.855
And then Watson was not there anymore, and I got this call from Bernadine Healy, who was at that time the NIH director, asking if I would consider coming to NIH to pick up the reins in this very early stage of the Genome Project, when most people were skeptical at best and actually opposed in many situations.

34:47.816 --> 34:51.119
And I said, that's really nice, but I don't think that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.420
And so I said, no, the first time.

34:52.998 --> 34:58.320
By the way, you might wonder, okay, Watson had left and Healy was trying to recruit somebody to come and take the reins.

34:58.401 --> 35:00.361
Who was running the Genome Project at that point?

35:00.702 --> 35:02.062
Ah, this is a good trivia question.

35:02.422 --> 35:10.446
The answer, our own Michael Gottesman, who is of course our deputy director of random neural research, was for a year the acting director of what was then the National Center for Human Genome Research.

35:11.126 --> 35:15.549
Well, ultimately I realized that this was just too amazing an opportunity to pass up.

35:15.689 --> 35:17.429
This was historic, it was gonna change everything.

35:17.670 --> 35:20.691
Yeah, it might fail, but if it succeeded, why would you not want to have the chance?

35:21.261 --> 35:24.242
to try to stand at the helm and lead this enterprise and work with all these amazing people.

35:24.302 --> 35:25.663
And more and more of them got on board.

35:26.203 --> 35:27.703
And yes, milestones started to happen.

35:27.723 --> 35:29.164
Genetic maps, physical maps.

35:29.624 --> 35:32.625
Yes, that bacterial genome, which made us believe, hey, you can actually put one of these together.

35:33.005 --> 35:37.067
Not long after that, the yeast genome, the C. elegans genome, the first human chromosome.

35:37.907 --> 35:43.469
And we had to get to 1,000 base pairs a second if we were really going to do the human genome with its 3 billion base pairs.

35:43.529 --> 35:47.811
But that all kind of came together because of a lot of incredibly gifted, talented, and hardworking people.

35:48.831 --> 35:50.052
A draft announced on June 26th

35:51.652 --> 36:05.101
2000 in the White House, but maybe the scientific milestone was the publication in early 2001 of the first draft of the genome with a lot of analysis that many of us spent many hours poring over in various locations and an experience I shall not forget.

36:05.782 --> 36:12.286
So that was one of the reasons I guess we can say this is a celebration of a particular moment, 20 years from that.

36:12.666 --> 36:18.270
But my gosh, since then, rapid technological advances, transforming our sequencing capacity, increasing the speed, lowering the cost,

36:18.666 --> 36:23.567
to now where a human genome is roughly four or maybe five or $600, where it used to be 400 million.

36:24.168 --> 36:32.590
And lots of other applications beyond DNA and the genome, the ability to be able to sequence nucleic acids, including RNA transcriptomes.

36:33.330 --> 36:35.711
And yes, RNA viruses, I have to say one thing about that.

36:36.451 --> 36:47.434
After all, it was one year ago this past few days, January 10th, where a Chinese scientist placed on the internet the sequence of a virus that seemed to be causing trouble in Wuhan.

36:48.336 --> 37:02.047
Three days later, on January 13th, our own Vaccine Research Center decided on the strategy for the vaccine that has now, with the partnership of a company called Moderna, turned into one of the vaccines that has received FDA emergency use authorization.

37:02.627 --> 37:07.271
And right at this very moment, NIHers are getting immunized with that vaccine in the B1 cafeteria.

37:07.811 --> 37:13.516
And a big shout out then to Fauci and Mascola and Graham and Kosmicki and Corbett who made all of those things happen.

37:14.383 --> 37:35.332
I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say there is a direct line from what the genomic approach to understanding life was that the Human Genome Project took off to being able to do something like this at this speed, and now to be able to track all those new variants that are emerging and causing us some concern by sequencing lots and lots of viral genomes for SARS-CoV-2.

37:36.052 --> 37:37.253
Well, okay, I divert myself.

37:38.073 --> 37:39.374
Of the other exciting possibilities, I'm

37:40.069 --> 37:44.413
And so what I'm arguing, hello, hello, I barely hear myself.

37:44.493 --> 37:47.376
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

37:47.396 --> 37:48.497
Does that better?

37:48.597 --> 37:49.859
Testing one, two.

37:51.841 --> 37:52.521
Test one, two.

37:52.561 --> 37:53.362
Can you hear me better now?

37:53.422 --> 37:54.904
I think I can hear myself better now.

37:55.024 --> 37:55.684
Test one, two.

37:55.884 --> 37:57.446
I might have had to put that up a lot higher.

37:58.277 --> 37:58.878
Is it better now?

37:59.799 --> 38:00.740
Testing one, two.

38:02.321 --> 38:06.305
So I almost, I almost, it's a little low still.

38:06.365 --> 38:06.645
Really?

38:06.686 --> 38:07.186
No way.

38:07.246 --> 38:08.127
I can see yellow.

38:08.187 --> 38:09.368
It's gotta be okay.

38:09.889 --> 38:10.690
Test one, two.

38:10.810 --> 38:11.751
Testing one, two.

38:13.032 --> 38:17.837
So what I hear of course is what a lot of people hear in the chat.

38:17.937 --> 38:18.497
It's kind of a,

38:19.258 --> 38:27.665
a rough telling, a clean telling of what happened with lots of, you know, hand waving and this isn't the droids you're looking for kind of thing.

38:28.566 --> 38:43.658
We did that, then we did this, then we did that and, you know, we sequenced these really little tiny things and then we jumped to really big things and it was all just fine because we got to like a thousand basses a second and here comes the details that we bamboozle you with and it seems like everything is great.

38:44.462 --> 38:51.888
And thank goodness Kevin McKernan was there to be the research and development guy that figured it all out without a PhD.

38:52.548 --> 39:06.260
Not that I'm saying a PhD is valuable, but supposedly he dropped out of grad school and just went right into the Human Genome Project, not because his dad is connected, but just because he's super, super, super, super, super, super smart and somebody heard about him.

39:07.901 --> 39:09.302
And that's how he got in there, I guess.

39:09.322 --> 39:14.146
Because there's nobody else in the whole world who could have done it

39:15.931 --> 39:35.358
And well, there's lots and lots of people, but Kevin McKernan just accidentally is the guy who got selected to do it without a degree, even though I guess there were lots of other molecular biologists in America that would have also been interested in being the research and development coordinator of the Human Genome Project at the Whitehead Institute under Mark Lander.

39:36.559 --> 39:39.280
And so again, you know, I'm just saying,

39:40.602 --> 39:42.664
If we listen to what he says very carefully here.

39:42.684 --> 39:52.990
A direct line from what the genomic approach to understanding life was that the human genome project took on to being able to do something like this at this speed.

39:53.470 --> 39:57.633
And now to be able to track all those new variants that are emerging and causing us some concern.

39:58.140 --> 40:01.101
by sequencing lots and lots of viral genomes.

40:01.342 --> 40:15.328
And so he's telling you right now that the virus is real, the variants are real, it is January of 2021, and thank goodness we have all this technology to follow millions of sequences of this genome.

40:17.129 --> 40:19.731
Is that really what they're sequencing with those swabs?

40:21.511 --> 40:24.413
Those swabs that for the first year and a half were not

40:26.087 --> 40:53.571
actually what they were they were sent to Ditra supposedly the sequencing of the virus for the first year and a half all the swabs were sent to Ditra as far as I understand although I could be wrong they definitely weren't just sequenced in different companies and then reported and uploaded to PubMed in a sort of haphazard and random way depending on who got what done when

40:55.009 --> 40:56.590
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

40:57.451 --> 41:15.183
Again, we are talking about an entire health freedom movement who is effectively ignoring all of the evidence, all of the circumstantial evidence, all of the documentary evidence, all of the podcast evidence, all of the video evidence, all of the print evidence that these people

41:16.633 --> 41:34.819
We're engaged in a disingenuous campaign to convince us of a circulating RNA that was differentiable from the background circulating present RNA and DNA in the background of all of our bodies and all of our microbiomes and all of the air and the water we drink.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.641
And in the sewer samples, for the love of goodness.

41:43.902 --> 41:50.108
The sewer samples were a source of data at this time in January of 2021.

41:51.089 --> 42:06.524
And none of these people have usefully articulated how malevolent that campaign could have been to establish, to coerce people into accepting a transfection as a vaccine, especially on the background

42:07.004 --> 42:18.709
where all the people on social media called it a vaccine, and even Robert Malone went to the Vatican to tell everybody that no, no, this qualifies as a vaccine because the virus uses RNA and so does the vaccine.

42:20.230 --> 42:28.173
And we just heard him say it yesterday, September 2021, seven months after this video.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.075
Eight months after this video.

42:32.847 --> 42:36.609
where they basically announced that the Human Genome Project still isn't done.

42:37.569 --> 42:39.390
We got a lot of work to do yet.

42:41.431 --> 42:48.015
We're just getting started, but thank goodness we've got this technology so that we can sequence this virus.

42:50.416 --> 42:53.838
I'm sure that with this technology, that's what they would use it for.

42:55.305 --> 43:03.728
I'm sure they pointed all the cameras and all the printers and all the magnometers, they pointed it all at SARS-CoV-2.

43:03.788 --> 43:20.313
I'm sure it had nothing to do with the remnant streams of samples that were being generated at all the universities around America, all the hospitals around America, and are still being generated now by everybody who does a COVID test and sends it back in.

43:21.374 --> 43:22.474
That hasn't stopped.

43:25.307 --> 43:33.650
More importantly, it has been normalized in the minds of young people as something that can be done, is done regularly, and works.

43:36.031 --> 43:44.193
It's also bamboozling our young people into thinking that remnants and their sales and their misuse is not a danger to them.

43:45.254 --> 43:48.275
Even though it was a danger to them already a generation ago,

43:49.679 --> 43:57.784
when periodically all over the United States, there would just be campaigns for C-sections and campaigns for the circumcision of young male babies.

44:01.066 --> 44:12.292
And now in 2025, we have virologists that regularly just teach Virology 101 and just say that, you know, some of the places we get cell culture are from circumcisions in the foreskin of babies.

44:12.392 --> 44:18.796
Not talking about the fact that we're not talking about, you know, a religious circumcision here.

44:22.022 --> 44:30.889
We're talking about the brutal manipulation of tiny, tiny babies through the malevolent coercion of their parents.

44:30.969 --> 44:36.213
Like, what is your argument when you say to a parent that, and offer them that as a possibility?

44:38.754 --> 44:39.955
You might want to check this box.

44:39.995 --> 44:42.797
Cause if you don't check this box, we're going to take the foreskin of your kid.

44:43.238 --> 44:46.080
If you don't check this box, we're going to take all of your placenta.

44:48.911 --> 44:54.073
Is that the informed consent that happens during the course of a baby being born in a hospital?

44:55.253 --> 44:56.413
Absolutely not.

44:59.895 --> 45:08.477
And that's nothing that Children's Health Defense is ever gonna have a website about or a news program about or nothing.

45:08.617 --> 45:10.518
Nothing will be said about that.

45:10.538 --> 45:16.020
We're gonna focus exclusively on Planned Parenthood because they're selling fetuses, which is probably true.

45:18.817 --> 45:33.506
But we're not gonna focus on the corporate hospitals that are selling placentas and selling foreskin and selling remnants from anything that gets there regularly that a pharmaceutical company or a research company or the US government would want.

45:36.168 --> 45:40.591
Maybe even BGI from Beijing wants and will be willing to pay for.

45:40.631 --> 45:41.811
Have you ever thought about that?

45:41.852 --> 45:47.095
That these traders would be willing to sell our medical remnants to China to the highest bidder.

45:49.619 --> 46:05.963
And while the health freedom movement has you running around about censorship and chasing Elon Musk's coattails and voting for Donald Trump, remnant sales in America have expanded into a business that's probably pretty hard to underestimate.

46:07.728 --> 46:22.351
and especially in 2020 and 2021 when these tests were running wild and most of them were only EUA granted products that had never been evaluated by a independent evaluator and are now off the market.

46:23.111 --> 46:27.572
And all the money that changed hands on all those companies, they're all gone.

46:28.732 --> 46:31.573
And there were hundreds of them because they were specific for cities.

46:32.489 --> 46:40.575
because cities gave contracts to those new companies in order to screen their municipal employees.

46:43.337 --> 46:46.819
We're talking about millions, if not billions of dollars.

46:48.281 --> 46:57.047
Track and trace companies that just called people after there was a report of a positive test and encouraged people and facilitated people to get testing.

46:59.383 --> 47:07.025
My next door neighbor on my old house in Meyer Lane was paid $40 an hour as a coordinator of people who did that.

47:07.985 --> 47:10.385
She got paid for a year and a half with that job.

47:10.405 --> 47:14.826
40 bucks an hour after not having a job and she could do that from home.

47:15.606 --> 47:18.787
That company's gone, long gone in 2021.

47:20.887 --> 47:23.388
And that's just one company on the north side of Pittsburgh.

47:25.568 --> 47:29.109
What happened in your city, what happened in your state,

47:32.401 --> 47:34.443
The times run out on all those things, I guess.

47:35.744 --> 47:39.428
When they sampled all the municipal employees every week for a year.

47:41.690 --> 47:47.375
Using tests that were EUA approved and sourced in China.

47:47.475 --> 47:50.678
Many of them sourced from BGI.

47:55.042 --> 47:57.164
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

47:59.164 --> 48:02.506
It's all one big show and we are not, we are the slaves.

48:02.606 --> 48:12.151
We are speaking slave speak as long as we argue with these people using their words and assume that most of these people are on our team, they are not.

48:12.291 --> 48:19.735
They may not be aware of the malevolence on their side, but they are aware that sometimes you need to tell a noble lie.

48:21.056 --> 48:27.439
Sometimes you need to, you know, make something black and white when it's not, when it comes to leading a country.

48:30.475 --> 48:32.977
And I guarantee you a lot of these people understand that.

48:33.117 --> 48:36.280
And the longer that they've been there, the more likely they are to understand that.

48:36.320 --> 48:40.624
That may be the best explanation for why Tony Fauci has been there for as long as he's been.

48:41.184 --> 48:44.747
Because he may not know the details, but he definitely knows that it's a theater.

48:46.368 --> 48:48.830
And controlling that theater is how we are governed.

48:48.870 --> 48:49.691
He knows that.

48:51.353 --> 48:54.695
And in fact, it may be his job to optimize that theater.

48:55.216 --> 48:58.839
And he may be have been successful in making that the primary theater.

48:59.943 --> 49:02.064
And what was the primary theater before that?

49:02.144 --> 49:02.565
I don't know.

49:02.645 --> 49:04.206
Was it just physical war?

49:05.587 --> 49:07.087
Like really kinetic warfare?

49:07.127 --> 49:20.516
And now the manipulation is primarily not real killing in that sense, but it's like, you know, culling and it's mythologies about who we are as a people.

49:21.874 --> 49:23.815
and what our biology is that they're controlling.

49:23.855 --> 49:35.961
I don't really know, but I have a feeling that the component of biology and the mythology of biology that they've created, that component is becoming very, very important to their ability to govern us.

49:36.041 --> 49:42.344
And that's why it's very, very dangerous that Mark is uncovering the history of that biology.

49:42.724 --> 49:51.028
The history of these ideas is revealing their sort of vapidness and the cage that we are in is starting to become visible.

49:53.447 --> 49:55.429
the opening of the cave is right there.

49:55.469 --> 49:56.670
We can feel the fresh air.

49:57.911 --> 50:00.633
It's because we're finally hearing through their slave speak.

50:00.673 --> 50:06.738
We're finally understanding how it is that if you argue with the word vaccine, using the word vaccine.

50:10.921 --> 50:11.782
So SARS-CoV-2.

50:12.522 --> 50:13.683
Well, okay, I divert myself.

50:14.524 --> 50:16.866
Of the other exciting possibilities, I'm sure we'll hear about many of them.

50:16.886 --> 50:22.971
I will tell you the basic science of understanding life has just been transformed by the availability of genomics

50:23.581 --> 50:33.785
single cell omics, both looking at transcripts and looking at chromatin structure has just phenomenally changed our view of what's going on in all sorts of human tissues and other organisms as well.

50:34.185 --> 50:39.026
The whole metagenomic approach, which we're going to hear more about, become possible because sequencing is so fast and so cheap.

50:39.847 --> 50:42.668
Applications, of course, cancer has to be at the top of that list.

50:43.228 --> 50:49.470
Almost anyone who now develops a malignancy, you will want to know exactly how that set of cancer cells has

50:50.003 --> 50:54.504
acquired mutations in DNA that may be driving the malignancy so that you can choose appropriately what the intervention should be.

50:55.364 --> 50:59.225
Newborns now with questionable circumstances, not sure what the diagnosis is.

50:59.685 --> 51:05.667
Sequencing the genome has almost become standard of care, because you can often make a diagnosis that way more quickly than otherwise would be possible.

51:05.747 --> 51:09.388
And in many instances, that may lead to an important intervention, a therapy you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

51:09.988 --> 51:12.268
And of course, we've now brought this forward into much larger.

51:12.548 --> 51:19.590
And so he says right there, he said it right there, that sequencing the whole genome of a baby has pretty much become standard of care.

51:21.038 --> 51:24.716
And so I know there are some people in the chat who don't even think that they can do that.

51:26.601 --> 51:28.302
To some extent, I do agree with you.

51:28.362 --> 51:35.847
I think it's very possible that they only sequence the part of the genome that they consider significant, which is a very small percentage of the genome.

51:36.407 --> 51:43.572
They may only do certain kinds of mapping techniques, certain kinds of targeted sequencing, which is really all they can ever do.

51:44.813 --> 51:53.238
And so one of the reasons why it would be interesting to know, for example, what equipment was used at all of these PCR testing companies that are now out of business,

51:54.240 --> 51:57.593
One of the interesting things to know there would be whether they had the

51:58.547 --> 52:06.550
the mechanistic and methodological capabilities or the physical infrastructure to do full genome screens or not.

52:07.630 --> 52:26.036
And the point I'm trying to make there is, again, about these two years of testing that I think is being revealed here in his cryptic language as actually being a creation of a remnant stream that would allow them to mass genome and mass genetically screen the entire population of America that participated.

52:29.446 --> 52:32.748
Shoot, I just lost my train of thought because I saw that Time magazine.

52:35.349 --> 52:36.450
I wish I could rewind it.

52:39.171 --> 52:40.292
Darn it, what happened there?

52:40.312 --> 52:44.194
I was a little glitch in the matrix there in my brain.

52:45.395 --> 52:46.475
I'll come up with it in a second.

52:46.495 --> 52:49.117
Let me just rewind him and see if I get cued up.

52:49.157 --> 52:50.937
Circumstances, not sure what the diagnosis is.

52:51.398 --> 52:55.500
Sequencing the genome has almost become standard of care because you can often make a diagnosis that way more quickly.

52:55.990 --> 52:57.291
that otherwise would be possible.

52:57.371 --> 53:01.035
And in many instances, that may lead to an important intervention or therapy that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

53:01.636 --> 53:07.382
And of course, we've now brought this forward into much larger scale in terms of the ability to look at millions of genomes.

53:07.782 --> 53:16.651
And so, yes, that's what I was trying to say is that the ability to look at millions of genomes is a recently acquired computer ability.

53:17.552 --> 53:41.259
And what he is again trying to do, in my humble opinion, is make sure that everybody that's listening to him believes that it's very standard that they sequence a whole genome and not just make a restriction enzyme map of it in the places that they're interested in or screen for the easiest low-hanging fruit of diseases as an excuse to collect the genome of a baby.

53:43.982 --> 53:48.467
And again, I don't want you to misconstrue what I'm saying.

53:48.507 --> 53:51.990
I'm sure there are lots of good doctors and I'm sure there's lots of good investigators.

53:52.651 --> 54:02.221
But exactly what he's describing here is exactly what Claire Craig was involved in before the pandemic, the 1000 Genomes Project, or rather it was called the 100,000 Genomes Project.

54:04.952 --> 54:10.195
Now, what I just showed you on the Wikipedia page was a project called the 1000 Genomes Project.

54:10.715 --> 54:15.078
And Claire Craig was actually involved at the start of the pandemic when it hit in 2019.

54:15.638 --> 54:30.827
She was actively involved in a project called the 100,000 Genomes Project, which was also using genomes and sequencing to find genetic markers for disease and using AI to do it.

54:32.489 --> 54:42.496
Those two authors are conspicuously found on the Corman-Jorston report that I think is central to understanding how this team had intended to control the narrative.

54:42.616 --> 54:44.157
They weren't going to question the virus.

54:44.738 --> 54:52.303
They weren't going to question the methodology in principle of using PCR to find it and to track it and to sequence it.

54:52.383 --> 54:58.828
But instead, they were going to be put in place to be people that would be authorities on what we're doing wrong and what we're doing right.

54:59.568 --> 55:05.112
And they would fuel this narrative of skepticism that was focused exclusively on how many cycles they used.

55:07.453 --> 55:16.699
And if you do the homework, you can see that for over a year and a half, that's what Jessica Rose and Matt Crawford and Kevin McKernan were all saying was the primary thing.

55:16.719 --> 55:23.183
You know, you can overcycle and cycling can give you, you know, viral counts, but it's not really viral count.

55:23.203 --> 55:26.145
And there's live dead technology they could be using, but they're not.

55:27.438 --> 55:31.262
And curiously enough, they still say that same crap now.

55:31.322 --> 55:37.850
The last time that Kevin McKernan was on Brett Weinstein, which was earlier this year, he said exactly that.

55:39.492 --> 55:43.256
Not that there's a background that they never made any effort to differentiate from.

55:44.257 --> 55:48.682
Not that these PCR tests are not appropriate diagnostics in general.

55:51.619 --> 56:02.243
Not that RNA cannot pandemic, but you know, the WHO did it wrong, or Jorstan did it too fast, or the peer review was too short, or there are primer dimers, or they're overcycling.

56:04.663 --> 56:15.947
And that already started and seeded a narrative that no one would ever be able to usefully question the idea of PCR testing, and therefore no one would ever question what they're doing with those swabs after they test them.

56:23.377 --> 56:35.480
Certainly, a particular million genome that we're looking forward to seeing is the All of Us program, which will be following a million very diverse individuals in the United States in the largest cohort study that NIH has ever announced.

56:35.840 --> 56:43.663
The All of Us program, I have a, I'm pretty sure I have a card of that thing somewhere on my desk.

56:43.943 --> 56:47.244
And that is a program that the NIH put together.

56:48.284 --> 56:50.204
And as he said, it was designed to

56:54.961 --> 56:56.002
I gotta see where it is.

56:57.943 --> 56:58.423
Is it here?

56:58.443 --> 56:58.483
No.

56:59.703 --> 56:59.904
Here?

57:01.324 --> 57:02.065
Where is it?

57:03.185 --> 57:03.766
I have one.

57:05.346 --> 57:06.167
Somewhere I have it.

57:06.867 --> 57:07.728
Let me plug back in.

57:10.289 --> 57:14.751
I'm sorry, my room is really, really a mess right now and I should be able to find it.

57:14.951 --> 57:16.572
I don't think, I guess it's not on the green desk.

57:22.116 --> 57:28.498
And so yeah, we are, I think this is really wonderful to see, because again, remember, let's put this in the right timeframe.

57:28.538 --> 57:30.758
It is January of 2021.

57:30.838 --> 57:35.679
He just got through announcing these new vaccines are just coming out.

57:35.719 --> 57:37.200
They just got EUA approval.

57:37.240 --> 57:43.981
And he said, down in cafeteria B, NIH employees are getting it right now from the Moderna shot.

57:46.182 --> 57:46.922
That's what he said.

57:48.632 --> 57:50.173
And so that's where we are in time.

57:50.233 --> 57:51.214
He's not scared.

57:51.674 --> 57:53.536
The pandemic doesn't make him scared at all.

57:53.576 --> 57:58.160
He's very excited because we are on the verge of a new genomic revolution.

57:58.780 --> 57:59.681
Just focused on genomics.

57:59.701 --> 58:13.392
This is not just another genome project, but genomics is in there along with a lot of study of human behavior and environments and diet and exercise and socioeconomic status, everything that fits into health and illness, but made possible in terms of the omics part of it by all of these advances.

58:14.112 --> 58:15.894
Wow, did you hear that?

58:19.073 --> 58:33.025
Because of the advances in the omics, the genomics, the proteomics, the metagenomics, they are studying all kinds of socioeconomic things, all kinds of human behavioral things.

58:34.906 --> 58:36.708
They are using it as an excuse.

58:38.416 --> 58:51.069
Just like I have said with regard to Biology 101 being bad Biology 101 when you teach your kids that you are a product of your genes and those people over there with different genes than you are the reason why you can't succeed.

58:51.649 --> 58:57.335
That is a terribly, terribly bad place for us to bring our kids up in, but that's how we were brought up.

58:58.856 --> 59:02.240
And the only reason why I never bought into it is because I couldn't be hyphenated.

59:03.612 --> 59:05.914
I have a tall white guy dad from Wisconsin.

59:05.974 --> 59:08.135
So I can't be Filipino American.

59:09.136 --> 59:11.217
And my mom is Indian and Filipino.

59:11.277 --> 59:14.800
So I would be an Indian American or a Filipino American.

59:14.860 --> 59:17.802
And then my dad's a tall white guy from Wisconsin.

59:17.822 --> 59:29.410
So what do I say when I'm six foot five and kind of white, but not really with dark hair and dark eyes and a completely, you know, Wisconsin accent where I say, sorry.

59:32.153 --> 59:34.714
My identity in college was no one, nobody.

59:34.774 --> 59:36.394
I couldn't be in any group.

59:38.815 --> 59:41.335
And so I never bought into the multiculturalism thing.

59:41.355 --> 59:42.536
It never made any sense to me.

59:42.576 --> 59:43.576
I just answered everybody.

59:43.596 --> 59:45.096
I don't know what to say to those questions.

59:45.136 --> 59:46.616
I'm just an American at this point.

59:48.837 --> 59:56.739
And it turns out to be one of the main antidotes that I've always had in my brain that never, never allowed me to get sucked into this nonsense.

59:58.424 --> 01:00:12.835
And it also allows me to hear how cryptically these people are talking now and how absolutely, I don't know what the right word is, but it's kind of like, you know, it pulls you in without you really even knowing it.

01:00:13.135 --> 01:00:26.025
If you're an academic biologist and trying to learn how to write grants, trying to learn how everybody thinks that the idea of genes being primal

01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:32.693
is very enticing because it allows your brain to explain so many things away.

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:45.082
It allows your brain to snap into place explanations that seem to make perfect sense but actually are woefully short of explaining anything.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:49.726
It's a beautiful magic trick that they play on us.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:56.325
And I think this, you know, a little enchantment that he did for the last three minutes is all part of it.

01:00:56.365 --> 01:01:09.395
Being able to succinctly and entertainingly, and maybe even over a strumming guitar, tell a story is very, very good as an advanced, you know, immunomythologist or whatever you want to call this guy.

01:01:11.137 --> 01:01:12.558
Ooh, this is beautiful to see.

01:01:12.578 --> 01:01:13.519
Yeah, of course.

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:19.183
We're getting closer and closer to the point where our ability to look at the genome also leads us to therapeutic options.

01:01:19.878 --> 01:01:31.084
the availability of gene editing, which is a relatively new event on the scene, beginning to cause us to dream about in vivo applications of gene editing for almost any genetic disease for which we know the specific mutation.

01:01:31.745 --> 01:01:39.149
My own lab just last week in Nature published a paper with David Lu of the Broad Institute and Jonathan Brown of Vanderbilt

01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:55.150
basically in an animal model of progeria, a dramatic form of premature aging, able to show that a single intravenous infusion of a gene editing apparatus targeted specifically to a single letter in the genome, a T that needs to be reverted back to its wild type sequence of a C,

01:01:55.936 --> 01:02:11.412
resulted in life extension of that animal, which is a pretty good model of a human disease, by almost threefold, and the most significantly dramatic result I've ever seen of a gene therapy intervention, and obviously much hopes, therefore, that that could be extrapolated to humans as well.

01:02:11.912 --> 01:02:32.650
Now, the interesting thing about it is that in all the models of genetic organisms or genetic manipulation that they use in order to extrapolate to humans, you can, on a macro scale, see that the stability of their pattern integrity is not maintained or as fragile as ours is.

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.813
And I'm going to give you a very brief, but I think a very poignant example.

01:02:37.514 --> 01:02:38.915
You cannot make

01:02:43.089 --> 01:03:01.534
It is very difficult to make genetically pure inbred strains of any animal higher than say a mouse or maybe a rat and even them rats are not as inbred as mice can be.

01:03:05.234 --> 01:03:10.956
In the same sort of anecdotal way it is comparatively easier to make a genetic

01:03:11.937 --> 01:03:15.299
knockout mouse than it is to make a genetic knockout monkey.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.522
Another anecdotal example would be inbreeding.

01:03:21.582 --> 01:03:31.688
If you were to take dogs and inbreed one generation of dogs into another generation of dogs into another generation of dogs from the original parents

01:03:33.302 --> 01:03:48.936
that you started with on your farm, I think you can imagine very quickly how the beautiful traits of the father and the beautiful traits of the mom would not be, you know, what you would primarily see in the offspring, you know, five generations later.

01:03:49.776 --> 01:03:53.820
And I don't know what that would look like, but it wouldn't be more better dogs.

01:03:54.841 --> 01:04:00.346
Most likely it would be dogs that weren't as smart and maybe even dogs that weren't as healthy.

01:04:01.806 --> 01:04:07.692
And I think you all are very aware of the times in history where this has occurred in human genealogy.

01:04:07.732 --> 01:04:12.317
And again, you have a scenario where, generally speaking, that family isn't very healthy.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:22.908
And certainly, if this was done on any scale, then you would be left with very genetically inferior human stock.

01:04:25.652 --> 01:04:40.405
On the other hand, I think anybody that's owned lots of dogs knows that a mixed breed dog, like a husky, like a Alaskan sled dog, like a Leonberger, or like a mutt, oftentimes these are extremely healthy dogs and extremely smart.

01:04:42.694 --> 01:04:56.401
The remarkable example of that in recent dog breeding are these doodles because a lot of times doodles aren't very smart and they're certainly not as smart as poodles are in general and they're definitely usually not as smart.

01:04:57.242 --> 01:05:02.345
Well, they might be as smart as the Labrador part but then the Labrador is already a very, very, very

01:05:04.039 --> 01:05:07.325
unstable mentality, let's say, and very focused.

01:05:07.365 --> 01:05:17.542
And so if you add some degree of curiousness or thoughtlessness or thoughtfulness from a poodle, you just get a maniac dog.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.281
And what am I really talking about here?

01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:36.351
What I'm trying to say is that what he just expounded on and the ability to edit a single T and the result is like three times as long a life and it's a pretty good experimental model of the disease in humans is a absolute, it's false.

01:05:37.812 --> 01:05:40.273
It's not, that's not at all where we're at.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.436
And the reason why is because our pattern integrity is different.

01:05:45.999 --> 01:05:59.502
And we have spent an inordinate amount of time ignoring the differences and trying to identify all the mechanisms that we share in common with the simplest examples of pattern integrities on earth.

01:06:01.983 --> 01:06:10.505
And so one just kind of tiny little idea here that will kind of hopefully help you a little bit understand what I'm saying without me saying too much.

01:06:11.883 --> 01:06:36.896
is that if this is all the biology and all the complications of bacteria and these are all the facts and figures and stuff about let's say yeast and inside of our biology there is a let's say a significant portion of which we share with yeast

01:06:38.669 --> 01:06:41.870
and another significant portion that we stare with bacteria.

01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:47.691
And then this is like human and so we share maybe some of this with other mammals.

01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:50.152
We share some of this with other vertebrates.

01:06:51.912 --> 01:07:01.395
My point would be here that Bad Biology 101, because we start with everything has DNA and therefore evolution,

01:07:05.365 --> 01:07:18.068
Working on bad biology 101 must work from the pretense that we want to understand how our DNA works by looking at simpler examples of how DNA works.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:28.090
And my argument in new biology 101 would be that if we want to understand the human pattern integrity,

01:07:30.256 --> 01:07:35.559
then it's actually the most important part are the parts that we don't share with them.

01:07:38.101 --> 01:07:56.573
And our entire infrastructure of science, all of the minds of science for a couple generations have been bent on trying to figure out what parts that we share with bacteria and what parts of our molecular homeostasis we share with yeast.

01:08:00.006 --> 01:08:22.393
and what few disorders we can explain using these biological mechanisms and maybe even the proteins or the enzymes that are shared historically or let's say that are shared between these, I don't know if it's historically or not, but let's say that there are common mechanisms and moleculars

01:08:28.467 --> 01:08:37.755
molecular reactions that we share in common and enzymatic assistance that we share in common.

01:08:40.017 --> 01:08:43.439
The difference between us and them is what makes us human.

01:08:44.861 --> 01:08:51.646
And by definition, the way that we approach our biology through bad biology, we ignore that part.

01:08:53.528 --> 01:08:57.411
And in fact, we ignore that part in when we try to appreciate

01:08:58.425 --> 01:09:00.206
any other lower animal.

01:09:01.887 --> 01:09:14.894
We use that lower animal as a way of bridging between the molecular understanding of the simplest forms of life on Earth and arguably the most complicated forms of life on Earth.

01:09:16.415 --> 01:09:26.100
And we ignore all the forms of life on Earth that might be in a very similar evolutionary position than we might be even as we talk about evolution as real.

01:09:27.714 --> 01:09:46.770
In other words, Bret Weinstein pretends that evolution is real so much so that actually that is the superior science and if you don't think evolutionarily then really you can't really be doing science and evolution impinges on everyone's understanding of everything and so that's what makes him so valuable and so smart.

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:52.175
But if that's the case, then you're going to have to evaluate the brain

01:09:53.655 --> 01:10:03.085
of a manatee, the brain of a killer whale, the brain of a dolphin, the brain of a large baleen whale, and think very carefully, okay, so what's going on here?

01:10:05.727 --> 01:10:06.468
What are we missing?

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:09.351
What have we done?

01:10:12.486 --> 01:10:32.189
But those convenient questions are completely ignored because, again, the point is to try and bridge the gap between these very simple pattern integrities and our own by ignoring everything that makes our own pattern integrity unique and focus on things that's shared across the pattern integrities on Earth.

01:10:36.072 --> 01:10:44.536
That's like trying to say you want to really appreciate what makes a Formula 1 car a Formula 1 car, and then you're looking at, you know, ball bearings.

01:10:50.018 --> 01:10:57.121
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen, but I do think that the Bad Biology 101, the DNA, therefore evolution, is breakable.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:00.579
and it is replaceable.

01:11:00.659 --> 01:11:08.307
That's the most important thing that I've ever learned from Buckminster Fuller is that you can't break something without having something to replace it.

01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:16.135
And in fact, sometimes the offering of the replacement is what facilitates the breaking of the old.

01:11:18.017 --> 01:11:20.560
It is the actual replacement that is the breaking.

01:11:22.642 --> 01:11:35.025
And so I think that's where my work is centered right now is trying to articulate that way of replacing bad biology with a new biology 101 with ideas like this.

01:11:38.366 --> 01:11:42.327
Well, we have to continue to work to make sure these technologies advance and that they're accessible.

01:11:42.387 --> 01:11:46.789
And I hope we'll also keep our eyes focused on the importance of applying this across the world.

01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:48.469
And I'm sure Charles will talk about that.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:56.270
but not just the people we study, but the people doing the study also need to be of the most diverse sorts, since we're talking about our shared inheritance of the human genome.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:08.253
So with that little bit of introduction, and I should not go on longer, because I will take away the time from the people that you really came to hear, let me stop at this point and introduce our first real speaker, which is Dr. Claire Bray.

01:12:09.093 --> 01:12:12.254
Claire got her PhD at State University of New York at Buffalo.

01:12:12.774 --> 01:12:15.415
She was then on the faculty at Roswell Park Cancer Institute,

01:12:15.876 --> 01:12:29.785
And then was at NIH from 1985 to 1992 at NINDS and then NIAAA, became a section chief and then moved over to the Institute for Genomic Research, TIGER, where she was and became president and director from 98 to 2007.

01:12:29.905 --> 01:12:38.731
Since then, she has been at the University of Maryland, where she is the Dean's Endowed Professor and Director for the Institute of Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

01:12:39.215 --> 01:12:41.597
She is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine.

01:12:42.098 --> 01:12:48.543
She has, I guess, just about finished her term as president of AAAS and chair of the board of directors, which she's about to become.

01:12:49.044 --> 01:12:50.525
She's a wonderful friend to many of us.

01:12:50.545 --> 01:12:58.693
She has been a wonderful person in terms of willingness to help NIH with all kinds of advice and review processes that we depend on experts for.

01:12:58.893 --> 01:13:04.177
And it is a personal delight to be able to introduce her to you here as part of this special genomics symposium.

01:13:04.618 --> 01:13:05.839
Dr. Frazier, please proceed.

01:13:06.496 --> 01:13:07.697
Thank you so much, Francis.

01:13:07.757 --> 01:13:09.597
I am absolutely delighted to be here.

01:13:09.657 --> 01:13:12.739
Just want to confirm that you can see my slides before I launch in.

01:13:13.099 --> 01:13:13.919
Yes?

01:13:13.979 --> 01:13:18.881
There's one thing from Outlander that I always remember and my wife are always laughing about.

01:13:18.921 --> 01:13:24.064
There's that one guy that I don't remember his name, but he was one of the good Scottish characters.

01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:27.985
And he said something like, I'd like to grind your corn.

01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:37.423
That was the worst Scottish accent ever, I won't do it again, but that's the one thing that I still laugh about every once in a while, it's very funny.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:40.264
Hey, Housatonic Link, thank you very much, Osen.

01:13:40.664 --> 01:13:40.844
Yes.

01:13:41.164 --> 01:13:42.084
Okay, great, thank you.

01:13:42.364 --> 01:13:56.987
Well, I really have the pleasure today of representing two of the domains of life, the bacteria and the archaea, and we'll have the opportunity to speak about how genomics has absolutely transformed our understanding of microbial life on Earth.

01:13:58.373 --> 01:14:01.276
put my comments in a bit of a historical perspective.

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:03.397
I think that- Oh my gosh.

01:14:03.457 --> 01:14:07.181
Is that really what, is that really what Housatonic, that's the story.

01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:08.662
I knew it was something like that.

01:14:08.722 --> 01:14:16.989
So it's, it's Mark Venter's wife, Ventner's wife, and she's the one who identified a Marathrax as being from Bruce Ivan's jars.

01:14:17.029 --> 01:14:17.890
This is the lady.

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.131
Oh, wow.

01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:20.052
Interesting.

01:14:20.152 --> 01:14:21.133
Holy cow.

01:14:21.253 --> 01:14:21.673
Perfect.

01:14:21.714 --> 01:14:23.395
Thank you very much for that tip, Pete.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:25.517
It's important because for, um,

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:33.049
students and postdocs who are maybe new to the genomics field, I always think it's important to remind them how far we have come.

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:43.293
And I think this historical perspective, which I assure you will be brief, will also showcase how much has been accomplished in the past 25 years in the field of microbial genomics.

01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:51.676
For me and a number of colleagues, this is where it all began at the Institute for Genomic Research in 1993 in warehouse space in Gaithersburg.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:54.977
At the time, we were one of the largest DNA sequencing facilities in the world.

01:14:55.356 --> 01:14:58.337
with 20 Applied Biosystems 373 sequencers.

01:14:58.818 --> 01:15:01.919
Most of the effort was focused on human cDNA sequencing.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:12.064
And in our first full year of operation- CDNA means that they were growing the DNA to sequencable quantities using bacterial cultures.

01:15:12.404 --> 01:15:13.925
Tiger completed the sequencing.

01:15:13.965 --> 01:15:16.686
The effort was focused on human cDNA sequencing.

01:15:17.706 --> 01:15:21.708
And in our first full year of operation, Tiger completed the sequencing of just over 101,000 samples

01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:26.012
which represented a heroic effort.

01:15:26.933 --> 01:15:29.794
But we really shifted gears in 1994.

01:15:29.934 --> 01:15:33.557
I'm not sure that that means they sequenced 100,000 genomes, but it could.

01:15:33.577 --> 01:15:34.197
I don't know.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.985
in large part due to a serendipitous meeting between Craig Venter and Hamilton Smith at an ethics meeting in Spain.

01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:42.207
Ham Smith, who was at Hopkins at the time.

01:15:42.227 --> 01:15:49.673
No, what it means is that she blamed Bruce Ivins, who we don't think is the guy who released the anthrax.

01:15:49.693 --> 01:15:55.438
And then Bruce Ivins committed suicide, which is also something that's not very likely that Bruce Ivins did.

01:15:57.139 --> 01:15:58.420
So that's why it's suspicious.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:58.801
Sorry.

01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:02.724
And had been working on haemophilus influenza his entire career.

01:16:03.594 --> 01:16:20.777
put forward the idea that perhaps we could deploy the Tiger sequencing and analysis pipeline to see if we could I wish I wish Mark was here because I actually also think that means that she's connected because I thought that the person who they used as Who suggested that it might be Bruce Ivins?

01:16:22.137 --> 01:16:31.859
Also said that there was some kind of you know She felt uncomfortable around Bruce or something when they were in a grad grad student lab together or something and that might be this lady, too

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.683
actually sequence an entire bacterial chromosome using whole genome shotgun sequencing.

01:16:38.063 --> 01:16:52.152
The idea here was not to do any mapping, but just to fragment the genome into pieces of known size, sequence both ends of each of these plasmid and cosmic clones, and then hope that you had an assembly algorithm that would put it all back together again.

01:16:53.093 --> 01:16:58.216
So we started this somewhat as really a flyer.

01:16:58.476 --> 01:17:00.678
Nobody was convinced this was going to work.

01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:10.411
But as Dr. Collins said in his introduction, the first complete sequence of a bacterial species, a freely living organism, was published in Science in July of 1985.

01:17:10.632 --> 01:17:13.472
This was a project led by Rob Fleischman.

01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:17.933
It's really remarkable to me to look back at what this entailed.

01:17:17.973 --> 01:17:23.235
It cost about $750,000 for one bacterial genome sequence, took about 13 months.

01:17:24.031 --> 01:17:28.695
and the effort of about 40 people, our assembly represents... Holy shit.

01:17:29.076 --> 01:17:32.339
Okay, so now I know you know that this is true, right?

01:17:32.379 --> 01:17:36.002
But you can read it, right?

01:17:36.362 --> 01:17:39.205
It's Haemophilus influenzae.

01:17:40.495 --> 01:17:50.444
Now, if you read the small text here, which I can read but you probably can't, natural host is human 6H influenzae serotype strains.

01:17:50.744 --> 01:18:03.856
Serotype strains, serotype being antibody response to, there are 6 different antibody specific strains have been identified on the basis of immunologically distinct capillary

01:18:05.794 --> 01:18:07.494
polysaccharide antigens.

01:18:07.574 --> 01:18:19.137
So, what their bacterial coat is made of has apparently six different potential interesting unique epitopes, maybe damage associated molecular patterns.

01:18:20.058 --> 01:18:34.021
Non-typeable strains also exist and are distinguished by their lack of detectable capular polysaccharide.

01:18:35.339 --> 01:18:56.303
They are commensal residents of the upper respiratory mucosa of children and adults and cause otitis media and respiratory tract infections, mostly in children.

01:18:56.944 --> 01:19:03.705
More serious invasive infection is caused almost exclusively by type B strains.

01:19:05.475 --> 01:19:11.960
with meningitis producing neurological sequelae in up to 50% of affected children.

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:21.148
A vaccine based on type B capillary antigen is now available and has dramatically reduced the incidence of disease in Europe and in North America.

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:35.790
The Hib-Titer vaccine was one of the most toxic vaccines ever to be recorded in the record books in America and actually Brian Hooker is doing some good work on that.

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:50.395
That vaccine is no longer on the market anymore and it's interesting because that vaccine was actually constructed of a small antigen taken from this bacteria and a large protein taken from the diphtheria toxin.

01:19:52.779 --> 01:19:53.299
That's correct.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.220
You heard me right.

01:19:55.061 --> 01:20:05.567
A comparatively tiny portion of the Haemophilus influenzae capillary protein polysaccharide was conjugated to the diphtheria toxin.

01:20:05.607 --> 01:20:10.771
And then that was the contents of the intramuscular injection called the Hib-Titer vaccine.

01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:12.552
It's now off the market.

01:20:12.572 --> 01:20:16.975
That was actually a product of a Pfizer subsidiary as I understand it.

01:20:18.976 --> 01:20:21.458
Are we talking here about the actual cause of flu?

01:20:24.642 --> 01:20:31.445
It is a commensural resident of all respiratory tracts, children and adults, and it causes respiratory disease.

01:20:32.685 --> 01:20:33.886
There are six strains of it.

01:20:36.227 --> 01:20:37.668
Six serotypes.

01:20:42.029 --> 01:20:44.671
I guess since it's a bacteria, it has bacteriophages.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.532
I think you see where I'm going with this.

01:20:50.173 --> 01:20:51.233
It had just over 24,000 DNA fragments,

01:20:53.027 --> 01:21:01.434
After enormous efforts in finishing and closure, we did end up with a single circular chromosome, just over 1.8 million base pairs in size.

01:21:01.974 --> 01:21:05.136
Predicted number of open reading frames, just under 1800.

01:21:05.477 --> 01:21:22.710
But I think for all of us, one of the biggest surprises, besides the fact that we were able to accomplish this project, was that 32% of the predicted open... What I'm saying is, is that influenza is based on a virus, but there's a bacteria with the name influenza, and it causes respiratory disease, and it's present in all lungs on earth.

01:21:25.788 --> 01:21:30.371
in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, where supposedly SARS-CoV-2 replicates.

01:21:30.411 --> 01:21:43.161
But if there's a bacteria that's there in everybody, then that means there are also phages that infect that bacteria in everybody, which means there's a background signal of that bacteria and its DNA and its RNA and its bacteriophages.

01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:48.605
And that's just one component of our upper respiratory tract mucosal microbiome.

01:21:50.046 --> 01:21:55.170
And it just happens to be the first full genome targeted bacteria that they chose to target.

01:21:58.244 --> 01:21:59.365
in 1995.

01:22:05.868 --> 01:22:07.649
What does non-spreadable mean, though?

01:22:07.869 --> 01:22:08.589
What does that mean?

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:15.493
I mean, in the current context of our lack of understanding of what spreadability means, I don't know what that means.

01:22:15.653 --> 01:22:21.896
I don't know how to think about that anymore, because I don't have a good idea of how things spread and what things spread and don't spread.

01:22:23.885 --> 01:22:29.627
And I think I've been very much misled by how things are spreading through my whole life.

01:22:29.687 --> 01:22:34.389
And so I don't want to pretend like I now know how it works, because I don't think I do.

01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:35.990
And that's the point.

01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.832
Breeding frames represented proteins of unknown function.

01:22:40.392 --> 01:22:41.992
This was not at all what we were expecting.

01:22:42.693 --> 01:22:47.295
But we took a step back and said, well, this is by no means a minimal organism.

01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:53.077
So maybe we shouldn't have expected that we would be able to place every gene into a known biochemical pathway.

01:22:53.621 --> 01:23:06.045
So the next project that we undertook in the microbial genomics space with funding from the Department of Energy was the sequence of mycoplasma genitalium, truly a minimal bacterial species.

01:23:06.345 --> 01:23:13.467
It had been estimated based on pulse field gel work that the gene size and the number of genes was probably on the order of about 400.

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:20.389
Mycoplasma is something that a lot of people in our space talk about a lot of times as being very important.

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:21.910
Toxoplasmosis also.

01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:26.616
I'm not incredibly familiar with these kinds of things.

01:23:27.217 --> 01:23:28.719
I just know that they exist.

01:23:28.739 --> 01:23:32.103
70 genes, and those estimates were remarkably accurate.

01:23:32.704 --> 01:23:34.306
This was accomplished much more quickly.

01:23:34.386 --> 01:23:38.151
We had everything in place that we needed, and this work was published late in October, later in 1995.

01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:44.325
And it's also very, again, this is a lot of the same kind of spellcasting.

01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:48.828
How do we understand that they estimated that there might be 470 genes?

01:23:48.848 --> 01:23:53.672
And then as she says, they were remarkably accurate in their estimation.

01:23:55.573 --> 01:24:01.778
I mean, do they open the box and then find 17 genes on the bottom and then open another side and though there's the other 463 or 53 genes?

01:24:06.704 --> 01:24:07.505
Is that how they do it?

01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:13.769
Like, I don't understand what she's talking about, but again, it's the same kind of hand-waving that all of these people do.

01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:18.873
They tell you this really abbreviated history and assumption after assumption and assumption after assumption.

01:24:19.313 --> 01:24:20.634
And our assumptions were pretty good.

01:24:21.655 --> 01:24:28.139
And again, to our complete and utter surprise, about 30% of the predicted open reading frames in Mycoplasma were novel.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.280
And I think that

01:24:29.574 --> 01:24:38.697
At that point, we all decided that we had to accept that this was a fact and that there was a lot of biology that we didn't understand, in this case, even of a minimal organism.

01:24:38.717 --> 01:24:43.159
And I think we all have seen that this has been a recurring theme in all of the genome projects for the past 25 years.

01:24:44.107 --> 01:24:56.902
Well, wait, so when we sequence things, we find out that we understand very little about them after we sequence them, then how in the world are we using intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to augment the immune system of healthy kids?

01:24:57.483 --> 01:25:00.867
Nevermind, how are we now using transfection to do the same thing?

01:25:05.387 --> 01:25:16.213
That statement was absolutely concurrent with the rollout of mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines around the world right now at this time, January 2021.

01:25:17.053 --> 01:25:17.794
She says that.

01:25:23.456 --> 01:25:33.882
With the two successes in the literature, all of the major funding agencies in the United States quickly jumped on the microbial genomics sequencing analysis bandwagon.

01:25:34.275 --> 01:25:42.077
The Department of Energy started out with a microbial genomics initiative, and that has, over a number of iterations, morphed into the JGI out in Walnut Creek, California.

01:25:42.718 --> 01:25:53.741
The NIH, particularly NIAID, initially funded multiple individual pathogen genome projects, and they have now, for almost 20 years, funded genome centers or genome sequencing centers for infectious diseases.

01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:55.041
So she did say it, right?

01:25:55.181 --> 01:25:56.902
NIAID.

01:25:57.702 --> 01:26:02.544
That's Fauci's particular part of NIH that has funded the majority of this.

01:26:02.964 --> 01:26:03.944
NSF and USDA.

01:26:04.508 --> 01:26:09.690
also got heavily involved and focused on pathogens of interest and relevant to each of their missions.

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:10.930
And I think this really speaks to the fact.

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:19.913
The USDA is interesting to mention here because the USDA could be considered a national security priority and therefore there's probably a lot of military money going in there somehow.

01:26:19.933 --> 01:26:21.694
The fact that bacteria are everywhere.

01:26:22.762 --> 01:26:25.804
and they impact life in lots of different ways.

01:26:25.984 --> 01:26:31.847
Bacteria are everywhere, but they played absolutely no role in respiratory disease.

01:26:31.947 --> 01:26:34.889
Respiratory disease is almost exclusively viruses.

01:26:34.929 --> 01:26:36.009
Don't you see it now?

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:44.674
Viruses that replicate in your upper respiratory tract or deep in your respiratory tract, depending on who you talk to and what virus it is.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.421
Bacteria play no role in human disease.

01:26:49.741 --> 01:26:52.863
No meaningful role in human disease at all.

01:26:53.523 --> 01:26:54.504
It's all viruses.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:27:08.650
Even though we have flora living on us that are composed of organisms that are interesting enough to be the first targeted sequencing in the world's history.

01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:09.831
Sure.

01:27:11.902 --> 01:27:19.546
I think if you asked any of us, even the most optimistic back in 1995, where this would go, never would we have imagined where we are today.

01:27:19.566 --> 01:27:24.169
This is information that I pulled recently from the Genomes Online database at JGI.

01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:34.694
This tries to keep track of all of the projects that are underway, looking at genomes, metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, numbers of organisms that have been targeted with genome sequencing.

01:27:34.714 --> 01:27:37.096
That number is well over 400,000 now.

01:27:37.436 --> 01:27:39.357
And this is really a big deal because initially,

01:27:39.738 --> 01:27:48.080
there was ever been targeted, tries to keep track of all of the projects that are underway, looking at genomes, metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, numbers of organisms.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.641
Now she has not explained what a metagenome is or a metatranscriptome is.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:58.483
And so in theory, they could be creating 100% false knowledge here.

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:08.558
It could be really like turning on a ham radio to a wide band sample and just recording it and then saying, wow, we got so much data today.

01:28:08.578 --> 01:28:11.340
We got to feed that into the algorithm and analyze it.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.341
We're going to collect just as much data tomorrow.

01:28:17.763 --> 01:28:20.224
And I think to a large extent, that's what we're dealing with here.

01:28:22.405 --> 01:28:29.328
It is a lot of implied fidelity and implied understanding that is absolutely and positively false.

01:28:30.267 --> 01:28:32.129
have been targeted with genome sequencing.

01:28:32.169 --> 01:28:34.110
That number is well over 400,000 now.

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:42.598
And this is really a big deal because initially there was effort underway not to duplicate sequencing effort on any, on strains of the same organism.

01:28:42.618 --> 01:28:51.065
And this was- Now I'm not saying that they, it is possible that a lot of the technology invented in the Human Genome Project has enabled the sequencing of genomes.

01:28:53.140 --> 01:29:03.804
Just like it's possible that if you could invent a photocopier that would allow you to photocopy handwritten Chinese books from ancient times and make lots of copies of them for everybody.

01:29:05.184 --> 01:29:06.605
But it wouldn't help you translate them.

01:29:11.006 --> 01:29:21.510
And so it is possible that, you know, after a lot of study of the Chinese books by making lots of copies of them that we found some phrases and some combinations of characters that seem to be repeated.

01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:29.143
But again, to imply that that means we're starting to understand the Chinese language and all its nuances is absolutely ridiculous.

01:29:31.323 --> 01:29:39.885
And to a certain extent, I think we may now be at the stage where the fake it till you make it script is at where the collection of the data has begun.

01:29:39.925 --> 01:29:48.207
They're gonna collect it, and hopefully they'll be able to link up enough Nvidia cards in the next 20 years so that that data can then be fed in.

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:53.386
And in the meantime, they're just going to keep faking it until you make it.

01:29:53.406 --> 01:29:57.446
They're going to keep having people like Ray Kurzweil or say, it's just 10 years from now.

01:29:57.486 --> 01:29:58.647
It's just 10 years from now.

01:29:58.687 --> 01:29:59.867
It's just 10 years from now.

01:29:59.907 --> 01:30:01.127
It's just 10 years from now.

01:30:01.627 --> 01:30:02.847
It's just 10 years from now.

01:30:02.907 --> 01:30:04.208
It's just 10 years from now.

01:30:06.388 --> 01:30:15.290
Because cost in the early days was such a prohibitive factor, but it's been extraordinarily gratifying to see where this has gone as someone who was there at the beginning.

01:30:16.331 --> 01:30:34.264
One of the things that we have clearly seen is that comparative genomics has been a very powerful tool in giving us insights about microbial diversity and evolution, processes like genome reduction, rearrangement, gene duplication are critically important, but I think one of the biggest surprises, again, that came out of comparative approach was the

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:43.325
finding that lateral gene transfer, transfer of genes or sets of genes or operons, not only within the bacterial domain, but between the bacterial and archaeal domain.

01:30:43.365 --> 01:31:04.091
Now, my suggestion to you is what you need to hear is how you are being bombarded by vocabulary that you would have to look up, and so would I. Lateral gene transfer shaping microbial genomes is not something the average adult can understand, but instead is sort of bamboozled by in a slave-speak sort of way.

01:31:07.383 --> 01:31:10.646
You almost find yourself saying, yes, Masa, I understand everything you're saying.

01:31:10.686 --> 01:31:11.627
Masa, I know.

01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:13.348
You're so smart, Masa.

01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:20.174
That's what I feel like when somebody talks like this to me.

01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:29.222
When they try to drop names and obscure terms that you've never heard of, like live dead technology.

01:31:30.808 --> 01:31:35.414
Genome arrangement, gene duplication, acquisition of new genes, bilateral gene transfer.

01:31:35.454 --> 01:31:38.758
Sure makes it sound like DNA, therefore evolution, doesn't it?

01:31:39.759 --> 01:31:42.743
And it's the certainty with which these words are tossed out.

01:31:44.178 --> 01:31:47.981
and combined that makes the enchantment so mesmerizing.

01:31:48.001 --> 01:31:52.323
And then all the people that are listening just have to feel good because I know what that word means.

01:31:52.363 --> 01:31:53.204
I know what that word means.

01:31:53.224 --> 01:31:54.385
I looked that one up before.

01:31:54.865 --> 01:31:57.267
I remember what that means because I heard someone else say it.

01:31:58.047 --> 01:32:05.372
And so they feel like that in this thing, you know, it's like playing guitar hero on the Sega or whatever machine that's on.

01:32:06.413 --> 01:32:07.714
And you just feel like, yeah, I'm rocking it.

01:32:07.794 --> 01:32:08.214
I'm rocking it.

01:32:08.234 --> 01:32:08.794
I know what that means.

01:32:08.814 --> 01:32:09.355
I know what that means.

01:32:09.395 --> 01:32:09.915
I know what that means.

01:32:09.935 --> 01:32:10.936
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:10.956 --> 01:32:11.316
I'm cool.

01:32:13.689 --> 01:32:15.510
It's rewarding to listen to this.

01:32:15.570 --> 01:32:20.434
If you think you know what she's talking about and that she's just smarter than you and you're keeping up.

01:32:22.075 --> 01:32:25.298
And that's how academics get their reward at all of these seminars.

01:32:25.378 --> 01:32:35.445
That's how they, they get to the point where they almost fall asleep in the seminar because the seminar never gets past what they've already, you know, rehearsed a million times themselves.

01:32:35.866 --> 01:32:41.450
So life was probably an important driving force in generating microbial diversity.

01:32:42.537 --> 01:32:53.164
I think another really important concept that came out of these comparative studies, particularly when we were looking at multiple isolates of the same species, was what became known as the pan-genome concept.

01:32:53.525 --> 01:32:59.028
There were a number of early studies which demonstrated extensive genetic diversity in isolates of the same species.

01:32:59.389 --> 01:33:02.731
In some cases, this first example was with E. coli.

01:33:03.331 --> 01:33:11.697
Depending upon what strain you were working with, 20 to 35 percent of the genes in a given E. coli strain appeared to be unique to that strain.

01:33:12.612 --> 01:33:20.495
The idea that emerged was that dispensable and strain-specific genes probably were involved in facilitating adaptations to various niches.

01:33:20.515 --> 01:33:28.818
I think a really important concept was that the number of dispensable and strain-specific genes for any given species may greatly outnumber the size of the core genome.

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:35.460
And it became clear that it would never be possible to describe a particular species with a single genome sequence.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.241
Wow!

01:33:37.461 --> 01:33:38.381
Listen to that!

01:33:38.421 --> 01:33:40.402
And that's just about the simple stuff.

01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:49.154
Dispensable and strain-specific genes likely facilitate niche adaptations.

01:33:49.214 --> 01:34:01.839
If these kinds of processes are kind of accepted to happen at the level of bacteria and archaeobacteria and yeast, then what are we really talking about here with regard to trying to understand our own

01:34:02.847 --> 01:34:03.728
pattern integrity.

01:34:03.768 --> 01:34:05.991
Well, we're talking about this problem right here, right?

01:34:06.051 --> 01:34:07.632
This is the problem we're talking about.

01:34:07.692 --> 01:34:14.440
That they have us focused on the mechanisms that we share in common rather than the mechanisms that make us unique.

01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:20.807
That might make us the gain-of-function organism of all gain-of-function organisms or something like that.

01:34:21.307 --> 01:34:41.458
If they believe in evolution, then they should believe that we are probably the ultimate product of evolution, and all the current animals on Earth are the ultimate products of evolution, and all the unique mechanisms that are present in us should be expected to be unique across each individual species that is a separate pattern integrity manifest after evolution.

01:34:43.103 --> 01:34:59.408
And yet somehow or another, they only are focused on the molecular mechanisms, the details of things that we share in common with these very simple background pattern integrities that may be artifacts or may be necessary substrate upon which we exist.

01:35:00.388 --> 01:35:11.412
It may not be possible to have as beautiful and complicated a pattern integrity as ourselves without all of the more simple pattern integrities around us that serve, again, as a sort of substrate for us.

01:35:12.452 --> 01:35:17.335
And that's a very different way of understanding ourselves and our environment and our role in it.

01:35:18.756 --> 01:35:32.744
It's a very different way of understanding the irreducible complexity of sacred creation if you start thinking about it that way, instead of the way these people want you to think about it, where you're as simple as DNA, RNA, and protein, and everything else is outside of you.

01:35:35.677 --> 01:35:36.557
Think about this.

01:35:36.657 --> 01:35:44.660
She is just marveling at the complexity of these tiny genomes and our inability to understand them by single genome sequencing.

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:54.803
But the Human Genome Project was announced complete in 2001 after a single genome wasn't even sequenced, but just restriction enzyme mapped.

01:35:56.624 --> 01:35:57.684
Size of the core genome.

01:35:58.345 --> 01:36:04.307
And it became clear that it would never be possible to describe a particular species with a single genome sequence.

01:36:05.794 --> 01:36:19.138
One of the other, I think, really important concepts that emerged from the pan-genome notion was the idea that you could use this kind of information, looking at genes that are shared versus genes that are unique in the field of reverse vaccinology.

01:36:19.198 --> 01:36:32.322
This was something that was coined by Reno Rapuli and his colleagues at Chiron Vaccines, a group at Tiger, still has a very longstanding collaboration with Reno and his colleagues.

01:36:32.402 --> 01:36:33.922
And the idea here is really very simple.

01:36:34.312 --> 01:36:36.674
You don't have to start by growing an organism in culture.

01:36:36.694 --> 01:36:49.303
You can start with a genome sequence, look to identify potential vaccine candidates here in panel B. These would presumably be candidates that might be secreted or be found in the outer membrane or the periplasmic space or the inner membrane.

01:36:49.663 --> 01:36:55.267
You could then take each of these candidates individually, purify them, immunize,

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:59.077
animals in preclinical studies do serological analysis.

01:37:00.158 --> 01:37:06.880
Please keep in mind that in this diagram, it's right there to bacterial surface associated proteins.

01:37:07.501 --> 01:37:10.922
We are not talking about reverse vaccinology for viruses.

01:37:16.244 --> 01:37:23.387
Identify the most robust vaccine candidates and then look to see what the sequence conservation might be with the idea being that you want to try and find potential

01:37:24.105 --> 01:37:29.167
vaccine candidates that are highly conserved, which would increase the range for a given vaccine.

01:37:30.508 --> 01:37:38.712
We put this idea to a test with this first project on Neisseria meningitidis, your Group B, again, a Tiger-Chiron collaboration.

01:37:39.612 --> 01:37:46.475
And about four years after completing the genome sequence of MenB, vaccine candidates entered clinical trials.

01:37:46.935 --> 01:37:52.778
And a number of years later, after various iterating, the objective increased the range for a given vaccine.

01:37:54.147 --> 01:38:02.272
We put this idea to a test with this first project on Neisseria meningitidis, serogroup B, again, a Tiger-Chiron collaboration.

01:38:03.172 --> 01:38:10.036
And about four years after completing the genome sequence of MenB, vaccine candidates entered clinical trials.

01:38:10.357 --> 01:38:13.919
I did not see, I didn't hear that.

01:38:13.939 --> 01:38:15.259
I'm going to go back a little farther.

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.420
I didn't hear that name.

01:38:17.941 --> 01:38:19.182
It could have been.

01:38:19.722 --> 01:38:23.224
Coined by Rino Rapuli and his colleagues at Chiron Vaccines.

01:38:24.026 --> 01:38:29.769
a group at Tiger, still has a very longstanding collaboration with Reno and his colleagues.

01:38:29.849 --> 01:38:31.370
And the idea here is really very simple.

01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:32.491
He did say Reno.

01:38:32.571 --> 01:38:34.112
She said Reno and colleagues.

01:38:34.772 --> 01:38:37.113
You don't have to start by growing an organism in culture.

01:38:37.133 --> 01:38:49.760
You can start with a genome sequence, look to identify potential vaccine candidates here in panel B. These would presumably be candidates that might be secreted or be found in the outer membrane or the periplasmic space or the inner membrane.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.522
You could then take each of these candidates individually,

01:38:53.527 --> 01:39:07.624
purify them, immunize animals in preclinical studies, do serological analysis to identify the most robust vaccine candidates, and then look to see what the sequence conservation might be, with the idea being that you want to try and find potential

01:39:08.351 --> 01:39:10.152
Here she says that in that figure, right?

01:39:10.192 --> 01:39:12.953
It's bactericidal activity here.

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:17.954
So she's talking about vaccines for bacteria, just like she's talking about sequencing bacteria.

01:39:17.974 --> 01:39:34.920
And I find that extraordinary because, of course, Frances Collins just got through introducing her and lauding the fact that this technology was allowing them to make millions of sequences of the various important variants of concern of the novel circulating coronavirus.

01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:36.221
Stop lying!

01:39:37.296 --> 01:39:42.320
vaccine candidates that are highly conserved, which would increase the range for a given vaccine.

01:39:43.661 --> 01:39:51.866
We put this idea to a test with this first project on Neisseria meningitidis group B, again, a Tiger-Chiron collaboration.

01:39:52.767 --> 01:39:59.632
And about four years after completing the genome sequence of MenB, vaccine candidates entered clinical trials.

01:40:00.072 --> 01:40:05.696
And a number of years later, after various iterations and improvements in a cocktail of MenB antigens

01:40:06.072 --> 01:40:18.017
this vaccine, Bexsero, made it to market from GSK, and this is the first vaccine that was developed solely using the reverse vaccinology approach, another accomplishment that we are very proud of.

01:40:19.017 --> 01:40:24.379
Microbial genomics has played a key role in helping to develop the field of microbial forensics.

01:40:24.839 --> 01:40:29.041
Jacques Ravel, Dave Rasko, and I at TIGER spent seven years working with

01:40:29.753 --> 01:40:31.954
the FBI on the Amerithrax investigation.

01:40:32.575 --> 01:40:45.361
And what we were able to ultimately do is to use complete genome analysis to demonstrate that there were mutations in these various morphotypes of Bacillus anthracis that had been recovered from the material sent through the mail.

01:40:45.802 --> 01:40:53.566
These genome differences allowed for the development of PCR-based assays that were used to screen over 1,100 anthrax stocks from labs around the world.

01:40:53.956 --> 01:41:02.539
and provided some very robust evidence, I think, that pointed to a potential source of the material that was material for this anthrax mailing.

01:41:03.439 --> 01:41:07.140
Microbial genomics has also played important roles in surveillance and outbreak tracking.

01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:19.044
By no means is this meant to be a complete list, but this has really become the way in which outbreaks are tracked because it gives now quick information and information with exquisite sensitivity.

01:41:20.185 --> 01:41:29.593
I think for me, one of the most exciting developments in the entire field was when we moved from looking at single isolates that you had to grow in culture into metagenomics beyond the single genome here.

01:41:30.214 --> 01:41:41.204
In a key paper published in 2004, Joe Handelsman made a very compelling point that if we really want to understand microbes, we need to be looking at them in their natural environments because that's where they live.

01:41:41.244 --> 01:41:42.505
They don't live in isolation.

01:41:42.947 --> 01:41:46.008
We could think about this now in 2004 because DNA sequencing.

01:41:46.048 --> 01:41:51.370
Of course, Sabine Hazan is also big on metagenomic sequencing of the whole metabiome.

01:41:51.390 --> 01:42:02.454
And she's also come on the scene as a important dissident because she sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the gut, which is, it's just all very extraordinary.

01:42:02.494 --> 01:42:05.695
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to stop here at one hour and 41.

01:42:05.875 --> 01:42:08.336
I might watch the rest of this tomorrow, but

01:42:09.393 --> 01:42:12.798
The Mark Lander presentation in this is also really good.

01:42:12.838 --> 01:42:14.701
And I think I saw somebody dropped it in.

01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:17.084
This is from an NIH videocast.

01:42:17.645 --> 01:42:21.390
So if you want to look for it, you got to look for the title and then look for the NIH videocast.

01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:23.773
And it's on an NIH website that I downloaded it from.

01:42:24.974 --> 01:42:30.218
I am going to leave it there because I do want to still get to the gym and get something usefully done.

01:42:30.238 --> 01:42:34.740
This has been a giga-ohm biological presentation.

01:42:36.161 --> 01:42:42.485
You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture, you just have to get people to stop reading them, and I think that's what they've done.

01:42:44.466 --> 01:43:04.848
I'm pretty sure that they've created an illusion of consensus about this biology that ranges from very unwieldy skepticism that there's no viruses at all and that molecular biology is a complete lie to the need to fear gain-of-function RNA molecules or natural viruses.

01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:29.898
And this spectrum of debate was maintained by these same people who are now really weirdly transitioning to a almost common sense list of things we should have changed 15 or 20 years ago and ignoring the elephants in the room that include murder and lies using PCR and a population pyramid in need of managing.

01:43:34.059 --> 01:43:37.803
And I do think that it's very easy to see who's responsible.

01:43:37.983 --> 01:43:50.537
I think there are a lot of unwitting participants, but I think there are a couple key people in the pseudo-populist movement that is now the Health Freedom Maha movement.

01:43:50.597 --> 01:43:53.240
They are very obviously part of this because

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.062
They haven't made any useful progress in all the time that they've been on stage.

01:43:57.442 --> 01:43:58.683
I think that's how you can see them.

01:43:59.964 --> 01:44:06.307
And I think that thinking about them the way that Noam Chomsky or Edward Bernays wants us to think about them, I think is the most effective way.

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:14.372
This is our way out, understanding that they've done this to us.

01:44:14.392 --> 01:44:15.572
Thank you very much for being here.

01:44:15.752 --> 01:44:18.254
I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:44:18.554 --> 01:44:20.095
For sure, for sure, for sure tomorrow.

01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:24.594
you
